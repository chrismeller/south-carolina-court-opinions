Dept. of Social Services, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nRalph Mangle, Pro se, of Simpsonville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â South Carolina Department of Social Services, Child Support Enforcement (DSS) appeals the family courtâ€™s denial of its motion to continue child support until the childâ€™s graduation from high school.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRalph Mangle is the father of Toran Mangle.Â  On October 31, 1991, custody of Toran was given to his mother, and Mr. Mangle was ordered to pay child support directly to the mother.Â  On January 17, 1996, Mr. Mangle was ordered to pay child support through the court.Â  Neither order addresses the termination of the child support obligation.Â  \r\nIn the fall of 2004, Toran began his senior year of high school and turned eighteen on September 14, 2004.Â  In March of 2005, Mr. Mangle informed the family court that Toran had turned eighteen.Â  On March 11, 2005, the family court terminated Mr. Mangleâ€™s child support obligation and dismissed the arreareage that had accrued after Toranâ€™s eighteenth birthday.Â  Neither DSS nor the mother was given an opportunity to be heard on the issue of termination before the courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nDSS filed a motion for reconsideration on March 22, 2005, seeking modification of the March 11th order to provide child support until Toranâ€™s high school graduation in June 2005.Â  The motion for reconsideration was heard on April 21, 2005.Â  At the hearing, DSS presented evidence showing Toran was in his senior year of high school, was an A and B student, and had perfect attendance.Â  On June 1, 2005, the family court denied DSSâ€™s motion to continue the child support obligation because there was no existing order for child support beyond the eighteenth birthday.Â  DSS appeals this denial.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nDSS argues the family court erred in not finding the child support order continued as a matter of law beyond Toranâ€™s eighteenth birthday until his graduation from high school or his nineteenth birthday.Â  We disagree. \r\nChild support awards are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge and, absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 92, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984). Â Prior to the 1996 amendment to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420, child support obligations generally ended by operation of law when the child reached majority. See Thornton v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 109, 492 S.E.2d 86, 93 (1997). \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (A) (17) (Supp. 2005) gives family courts jurisdiction to make orders of child support and states, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n(A) The family court has exclusive jurisdiction: (17) To make all orders for support run until further order of the court, except that orders for child support run until the child is eighteen years of age or until the child is married or becomes self&#8209;supporting, as determined by the court, whichever occurs first or to provide for child support past the age of eighteen years if the child is in high school and is making satisfactory progress toward completion of high school, not to exceed the nineteenth birthday unless exceptional circumstances are found to exist or unless there is a preexisting agreement or order to provide for child support past the age of eighteen years. \r\n\r\nDSS argues this requires child support obligations to continue as a matter of law beyond the childâ€™s eighteenth birthday where the child is in high school and making satisfactory progress towards graduation even if the original support order is silent as to support past the eighteenth birthday. \r\nIt is undisputed that the family court can order child support to continue beyond the age of eighteen for children who are in high school and are making satisfactory progress towards completion.Â  However, a lack of jurisdiction was not the basis of the family courtâ€™s denial.Â  The family courtâ€™s denial was based solely on procedure.Â  The authority to grant a specific form of relief does not mean that form of relief will automatically be granted.\r\nChild support like all relief must be properly pleaded, noticed, and specifically granted by the court.Â  There was no existing order granting child support past the age of eighteen.Â  Neither the mother nor DSS had ever filed an action seeking the continuation of child support beyond Toranâ€™s eighteenth birthday.Â  See Dake v. Painter, 288 S.C. 118, 118, 341 S.E.2d 620, 620 (1986) (holding the family court had no authority to reduce amount or frequency of child support payments where neither was requested in the pleadings). Â The court dismissed the motion to reconsider without prejudice and informed DSS that the mother would need to seek a new order granting child support to cover the remaining period until the childâ€™s graduation or nineteenth birthday.Â  Accordingly, judgment of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.[1]\r\nKITTREDGE, SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n[1]We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4131","title":"Town of Hilton Head Island v.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4131\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed July 3, 2006\r\n\r\nVACATED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMarshall H. Waldron, Jr., of Bluffton, for Appellant.\r\nMontgomery Godwin, pro se, of Bluffton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this action, the Town of Hilton Head Island (the Town) appeals the order of the circuit court denying its motion to dismiss and granting a new trial in favor of Montgomery Godwin.Â  We vacate.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn July 1995, Godwin received a citation charging him with criminal domestic violence.Â  The uniform traffic ticket set a trial date for August 8, 1995.Â  When Godwin failed to appear, the Hilton Head Island municipal court found him guilty, in absentia; assessed a $304 fine; and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.[2]Â  Godwin neither appealed the conviction nor took any other action to set aside the conviction.Â  On September 29, 1995, police arrested Godwin in connection with three outstanding arrest warrants, including the warrant issued following his CDV conviction.Â  That same day, Godwin, or someone on his behalf, paid the $304 fine in connection with the CDV conviction to obtain his release from custody.Â  Again, Godwin took no action related to the conviction. \r\nOn August 11, 2003, Godwin applied for a gun permit pursuant to an employment opportunity.Â  A subsequent SLED investigation revealed the 1995 CDV conviction on his record.Â  Then, on March 26, 2004, approximately eight years after the CDV conviction, Godwin sent a letter to the Hilton Head Island Municipal Court, which the court treated as a motion to set aside the conviction and/or a motion for a new trial.Â  At the hearing before municipal court Judge James Herring, Godwin claimed the first notice he received of the CDV conviction was on August 11, 2003, and that the Town committed several procedural and clerical errors relating to his conviction for CDV that warranted his conviction be set aside or a new trial granted.Â  The Town argued the municipal court lacked the jurisdiction to entertain Godwinâ€™s motion because the motion was untimely.Â  The municipal court agreed and denied the motion, finding Godwinâ€™s actions were untimely.\r\nGodwin appealed the municipal courtâ€™s order to the circuit court.Â  The Town filed a motion to dismiss, arguing the circuit court and the municipal court lacked jurisdiction to hear Godwinâ€™s motion.Â  At the motion hearing, Godwin again argued he did not receive notice of his 1995 CDV conviction until August 11, 2003, and that he discovered many procedural and clerical errors that warranted his conviction be set aside or a new trial granted.Â  The circuit court agreed with Godwin, denied the motion to dismiss, and granted a new trial based on â€œsubstantial justice.â€Â  The Townâ€™s motion to reconsider was denied, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court must always take notice of the lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Amisub of S.C., Inc. v. Passmore, 316 S.C. 112, 114, 447 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1994).Â  The lack of subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time, can be raised for the first time on appeal, and can be raised sua sponte by the court. Â See, e.g., Lake v. Reeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 248, 498 S.E.2d 650, 653 (Ct. App. 1998) (holding issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time).Â  â€œThe acts of a court with respect to a matter as to which it has no jurisdiction are void.â€Â  State v. Guthrie, 352 S.C. 103, 107, 572 S.E.2d 309, 311-12 (Ct. App. 2002). Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Town argues the circuit court erred in denying its motion to dismiss and in granting Godwinâ€™s motion for a new trial.Â  Specifically, the Town argues the circuit court lacked the jurisdiction necessary to entertain Godwinâ€™s motion.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 29(a) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure governs post trial motions from a conviction in magistrateâ€™s court and states, in part:\r\n\r\nIn cases involving appeals from convictions in magistrateâ€™s or municipal court, post trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment disposing of the appeal.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the supreme court has noted that â€œa partyâ€™s time to appeal from a judgment in a magistrateâ€™s court or move for a new trial therein ... begin[s] [when] he has notice of the judgment.â€Â  State v. Martin, 352 S.C. 32, 33, 572 S.E.2d 287, 288 (2002) (citing Brewer v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 261 S.C. 52, 56, 198 S.E.2d 256, 257 (1973)).Â  A party who fails to timely appeal or take any other timely action necessary to correct an error is procedurally barred from contesting the validity of the conviction.Â  Martin, 352 S.C. at 33, 572 S.E.2d at 288.\r\n Martin is analogous to the present case.Â  Because of a series of administrative errors, Martin was notified in December 1997, that she had been convicted, in absentia, of driving under the influence on August 26, 1997.Â  Martin, 352 S.C. at 33, 572 S.E.2d at 287.Â  A bench warrant was issued for Martinâ€™s arrest, and she paid the fine assessed by the municipal court.Â  Id.Â  Shortly thereafter, Martin notified the State, via her attorney, of the disposition of the ticket.Â  Id. at 33, 572 S.E.2d 288.Â  The State took no action at that time.Â  Nearly six months later, in June 1998, the State sought to reopen the case on the ground that the traffic ticket had been â€œsigned offâ€ in error.Â  Id. Â The circuit court ruled the Stateâ€™s efforts to set aside the conviction were untimely.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court agreed, finding the state took no action between December 1997 and June 1998 to rectify the situation or to notify Martin that her conviction had been erroneously entered.Â  The court, relying on Rule 29, SCRCrimP, held the Stateâ€™s â€œfailure to take any remedial action to remedy this situation in a timely manner therefore precluded its ability to challenge the entry of a conviction on the DUI first ticket.â€Â  Id. at 34, 572 S.E.2d at 288.\r\nIn this matter, Godwin had notice of his 1995 CDV conviction no later than September 29, 1995, when he was arrested under the bench warrant and his release was secured by payment of the fine imposed by the municipal court after the 1995 conviction.Â  Under Rule 29, SCRCrimP, Godwin had until October 9, 1995 to file any post trial motions or his notice of appeal.Â  Godwin failed to take any remedial actions at that time.Â  His motion to set aside the 1995 conviction came in March 2004, approximately eight years after he received notice of the conviction.Â  Similar to the Stateâ€™s inaction in Martin, Godwinâ€™s inaction precludes his ability to challenge the 1995 conviction.Â  Therefore, the municipal court correctly held Godwinâ€™s challenge to his conviction was untimely, and the circuit court erred in failing to grant the Townâ€™s motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAssuming, arguendo, notice was not received until August 11, 2003, the date Godwin admitted he received notice of the 1995 conviction, his motion would still be untimely.Â  Godwin took no action from August 11, 2003 until his letter to the municipal court on March 26, 2004, some seven months from the date he claimed he received notice of the conviction.Â  Accordingly, as Godwin concedes he had actual notice of the 1995 conviction on August 11, 2003, and he failed to timely appeal or take any other action to correct the matter, he is now procedurally barred from contesting the validity of the 1995 conviction. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is hereby\r\n VACATED.\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Godwin agreed that the municipal court found him guilty, in absentia, but he denied receiving notice until August 11, 2003.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4132","title":"Doe v.

Speedy, of Camden, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this action for divorce and equitable distribution, Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s identification, valuation, and distribution of the marital estate.Â  In addition, Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s award of attorneysâ€™ fees, costs, and certain advancements to Husband.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nWife and Husband were married on September 8, 1970, when Husband was seventeen and Wife was sixteen.Â  Husband worked as a construction laborer until he began his own construction company in the 1980s.Â  For the first fourteen years of their marriage, Wife had numerous jobs, one of which was at Jubilee Embroidery.Â  At some time in the mid to late 1970s, while employed at Jubilee, Wife began having an affair with her boss (Paramour).Â  In 1984, Wife ceased working after giving birth to a daughter (Daughter). \r\nAlthough the parties had very few assets when their marriage began, they amassed a fairly large estate over the years.Â  Husbandâ€™s construction business was profitable, and Wife worked for the business approximately one day a week, keeping the books and offering decorating services.Â  In 2002, after Daughter graduated from high school and moved out of the home to attend college, Wife asked Husband for a divorce.Â  Husband testified he became suspicious when Wife refused to attempt marriage counseling.Â  He hired a private investigator, who observed Wife entering a motel with Paramour.Â  Husband recognized Paramour, not only because he had been Wifeâ€™s former boss, but also because Paramour was a longtime family friend.Â  Wife later admitted the affair had been going on for more than twenty years.Â  \r\nUpon learning of the adultery, Husband called Paramourâ€™s wife to inform her of the relationship between their spouses.Â  After speaking with her, Husband suspected the daughter he had raised might not be his biological child.Â  He later had a DNA test, which confirmed his suspicions that Paramour was Daughterâ€™s biological father.[1]Â  \r\nSubsequently, Husband filed a complaint in the family court, asking for, among other things, a divorce on the grounds of adultery and an equitable distribution of the marital property.Â  Notably, Husband did not seek a ruling regarding Daughterâ€™s paternity.Â  In Wifeâ€™s answer, she admitted the adultery.Â  \r\nAt the final hearing, the parties presented evidence of the valuation of the marital property, the quality of Husband and Wifeâ€™s relationship before separation, the costs associated with the divorce, and various advances made by Husband between the time of filing for divorce and the time of the hearing.Â  Additionally, Husband presented evidence indicating Daughter was not his biological child and introduced the testimony of Dr. Perry Woodside, an economist, to establish the cost of raising a child.Â  The family court issued a divorce decree granting Husband a divorce on the grounds of adultery; barring alimony to Wife; valuing the marital property at $1,332,798; awarding Husband seventy percent of the marital property; and ordering Wife to reimburse Husband for his advances, his attorneysâ€™ fees, his accountantâ€™s fees, and the cost of Dr. Woodsideâ€™s testimony.Â  Wife submitted a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend this decree, which the family court denied.Â Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has\r\nthe authority to find the facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Ex parte Morris,&nbsp;367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).Â  However, â€œbecause the family court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should be given broad discretion.â€Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d 620, 623&nbsp;(2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Identification and Valuation of Marital Property\r\nWife contends the family court erred in identifying and valuing the marital property.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nTo preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  â€œError preservation requirements are intended â€˜to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€™â€Â  Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546&nbsp;(2000) (quoting Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724&nbsp;(2000)).Â  Without an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply is not able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, Â motion, the issue is not preserved for appellate review. Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781&nbsp;(1992).\r\nAt trial, Wife made no arguments with respect to the valuation of the marital property.Â  Additionally, Wife failed to specifically raise any issues with regard to valuation in her Rule 59(e) motion.Â  Instead, she generally asserted that the divorce decree was unsupported by the evidence and that the family court judge failed to properly apply the equitable division statute.Â  These broad assertions failed to preserve her appellate arguments relating to the identification and valuation of the marital estate.\r\nII. Daughterâ€™s Paternity\r\nWife argues the family court erred in making findings of facts that essentially determined Daughterâ€™s paternity.Â  This issue has also not been preserved for our review.Â  \r\nWife objected at trial to the consideration of Daughterâ€™s paternity, and the family court assured her that a â€œdetermination as to whether or not the child is bastardized . . . is not a finding for the Court to make.â€Â  The family court later stated â€œ[t]here will be no finding as to the paternity of the child.â€Â  However, in its written order, the family court found that â€œalthough the question of paternity was not before the Court, DNA testing and the admission of the wife has proven that the child is not the biological daughter of [Husband].â€Â  Although Wife made a motion to alter or amend the family courtâ€™s order, she did not ask the family court to reconsider this finding. Under these circumstances, Wife failed to preserve this issue for our review.Â  See Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 60, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675&nbsp;(1993) (holding when trial courtâ€™s oral and written orders are inconsistent, appellant must bring these inconsistencies to the trial courtâ€™s attention through a motion to alter or amend to preserve the issue for appeal).[2]Â  \r\nIII. Equitable Distribution\r\nWife argues the family court erred in distributing seventy percent of the marital property to Husband.Â  Specifically, Wife contends the family court erred in considering the paternity of Daughter as a factor in equitable distribution, intimating that the length of the marriage favored Husband, penalizing Wife for her marital misconduct, and undervaluing her contribution to the marital estate.Â  We agree.\r\nThe division of marital property is in the family courtâ€™s discretion and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that discretion. Â Craig v. Craig, 365 S.C. 285, 290, 617 S.E.2d 359, 361&nbsp;(2005).Â  Section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides fifteen factors for the family court to consider in apportioning marital property and affords the family court with the discretion to give weight to each of these factors â€œas it finds appropriate.â€Â  On appeal, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and it is irrelevant that this court might have weighed specific factors differently than the family court.Â  Greene v. Greene, 351 S.C. 329, 340, 569 S.E.2d 393, 399&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Even if the family court commits error in distributing marital property, that error will be deemed harmless if the overall distribution is fair.Â  See West v. West, 315 S.C. 44, 46, 431 S.E.2d 603, 604&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1993).Â  \r\nIn awarding Husband seventy percent of the marital estate, the family court found â€œthe two controlling factorsâ€ were the duration of the marriage and the conduct of the parties. Â The family court went on to say the marriageâ€™s dissolution was â€œsolely at the hands of [Wife]â€ and Wife â€œduped her spouse through at least twenty years of the thirty-two year marriage into believing that he should love her.â€Â  Additionally, the family court noted that Husbandâ€™s contribution to the marital estate was ninety to ninety-five percent and that Dr. Woodsideâ€™s testimony, which outlined the cost of raising a child, was relevant to the courtâ€™s equitable apportionment determination. \r\nWe find the family courtâ€™s seventy-thirty split in favor of Husband constituted an abuse of discretion.Â  This was a marriage of significant duration.Â  While there is certainly no recognized presumption in favor of a fifty-fifty division, we approve equal division as an appropriate starting point for a family court judge attempting to divide an estate of a long-term marriage. Â See Roy T. Stuckey, Marital Litigation in South Carolina 321-22 (3rd ed. 2001 and Supp. 2005) (â€œAlthough neither the case decisions nor the Equitable Apportionment of Marital Property Act say so directly, the results in cases involving long marriages would lead one to predict that, absent special circumstances, marital property will be divided on a 50-50 basis . . . .â€). Â Case law seems to bear out this trend.Â  See id. (citing Craig v. Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 595 S.E.2d 837 (Ct. App. 2004) (upholding a 50-50 division of marital property following a twenty-seven-year marriage), affâ€™d by 365 S.C. 285, 617 S.E.2d 359&nbsp;(2005); Widman v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 557 S.E.2d 693 (Ct. App. 2001) (affirming a 50-50 split in a sixteen year marriage that ended because of husbandâ€™s adultery); Mallet v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 473 S.E.2d 804 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting the family courtâ€™s 50-50 split was â€œgenerous,â€ but ultimately affirming the award, which followed a twenty-one year marriage); Doe v. Doe, 324 S.C. 492, 478 S.E.2d 854 (Ct. App. 1994) (affirming the family courtâ€™s 50-50 split where the parties had been married over thirty years);Â  Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 439 S.E.2d 312 (Ct. App. 1993) (affirming the family courtâ€™s award to Wife of a fifty percent â€œspecial equity interestâ€ in the appreciated value of the family home, which was Husbandâ€™s nonmarital property, following a seventeen-year marriage); Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, 389 S.E.2d 165 (Ct. App. 1990) (affirming a 50-50 division of marital property following an eighteen-year marriage); Kirsch v. Kirsch, 299 S.C. 201, 203, 383 S.E.2d 254, 255 (Ct. App. 1989) (affirming a 50-50 split and stating: â€œThis was a marriage of thirty years.Â  While Mr. Kirsch provided the bulk of the income, Mrs. Kirsch was a homemaker and she also worked for approximately twelve years outside the home.â€); Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 363 S.E.2d 404 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming a 50-50 split in a marriage that lasted eighteen years, during which time Wife provided homemaker services and occasionally worked outside the home); Leatherwood v. Leatherwood, 293 S.C. 148, 359 S.E2d 89 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming a 50-50 split of marital property following a twenty-two year marriage)).Â Â  \r\nWe recognize that in many long-term marriages, one spouse becomes the primary breadwinner while the other spouse makes less or even no money in order to have the flexibility to keep the household running smoothly. Â This arrangement is agreed upon, often implicitly, among the parties, and it would be unfair to the spouse who undertook household duties for the family court to apportion the marital estate solely based on the partiesâ€™ direct financial contributions.Â  See Walker v. Walker, 295 S.C. 286, 289, 368 S.E.2d 89, 90 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œEquitable distribution is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic partnership.â€).\r\nThis equal division of marital assets can, of course, be altered in favor of one spouse depending on the circumstances of each case.Â  Here, for instance, Wifeâ€™s adultery caused the breakup of the marriage, an appropriate consideration for equitable apportionment.Â  However, we have consistently held that fault does not justify a severe penalty. [3]Â Â  See Dixon v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 236, 512 S.E.2d 539, 546 (Ct. App. 1999); Rampey v. Rampey, 286 S.C. 153, 156, 332 S.E.2d 213, 214 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  We believe that Wifeâ€™s adultery, alone, does not justify a forty percent differential between her portion of the marital estate and Husbandâ€™s portion.Â  Indeed, such a lopsided division could only be sustainable if our equitable division laws sanction the consideration of fault as a permissible punitive factor.Â  Our law is to the contrary, expressly disallowing fault as a penalty.Â  Thus, Wifeâ€™s adultery does not justify a forty percent equitable division differential.\r\nIn arriving at its seventy-thirty division, the family court specifically found Dr. Woodsideâ€™s testimony regarding the cost of raising a child relevant.Â  However, the issue of paternity was never properly before the court.Â  In fact, Husbandâ€™s complaint alleged that â€œof this marriage one child has been born, namely, [Daughter].â€Â  Because paternity was not an issue, the cost of raising Daughter, who was born during the marriage, was not relevant, and the family court erred in considering the testimony.\r\nIn light of the marriageâ€™s longevity, our prohibition against imposing a severe penalty for fault, and the family courtâ€™s erroneous consideration of Dr. Woodsideâ€™s testimony, we find the family court abused its discretion when it awarded Husband seventy percent of the marital estate.Â  We believe the more equitable division would be sixty percent to Husband and forty percent to Wife. [4]\r\nIV. Advancements\r\nWife argues the family court erred in ordering her to reimburse Husband for certain advancements made on behalf of Wife.[5] Wife specifically contends Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 486 S.E.2d 516 (Ct. App. 1997), provides that these payments, to the extent they are voluntary, do not entitle Husband to reimbursement.Â  However, Wife did not raise this issue to the family court and did not challenge this portion of the ruling in her Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.[6]Â  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Washington v. Washington, 308 S.C. 549, 551, 419 S.E.2d 779, 781&nbsp;(1992) (holding when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to amend, the issue is not presented properly to an appellate court for review); Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (holding an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nV. Attorneysâ€™ Fees and Cost of Dr. Woodsideâ€™s Testimony\r\nWife argues the family court erred in ordering her to pay all of Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.[7]Â  Additionally, Wife contends the family court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Woodside and ordering her to pay the costs associated with his testimony.Â  We address these issues separately below. \r\nA. Attorneysâ€™ Fees\r\nWife argues the family court erred in ordering her to pay all of Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees. We agree.Â  \r\nAttorneysâ€™ fees may be assessed against a party in an action brought in the family court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(38) (Supp. 2005); Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123&nbsp;(2004).Â  The award of attorneysâ€™ fees is within the discretion of the court.Â  Hailey v. Hailey, 357 S.C. 18, 31, 590 S.E.2d 495, 502&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision regarding attorneysâ€™ fees will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 353, 465 S.E.2d 130, 134&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\nâ€œAn order or judgment pursuant to an adjudication in a domestic relations case shall set forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law to support the courtâ€™s decision.â€Â  Rule 26(a), SCRFC.Â  â€œOur case law and court rules make clear that when a contract or statute authorizes an award of attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must make specific findings of fact on the record for each of the required factors to be considered.â€Â  Griffith v. Griffith, 332 S.C. 630, 646, 506 S.E.2d 526, 534-35&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1998). Â â€œ[W]hen an Order is issued in violation of Rule 26(a), this Court may remand the matter to the trial court or, where the record is sufficient, make its own findings of fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Holcombe v. Hardee, 304 S.C. 522, 524, 405 S.E.2d 821, 822&nbsp;(1991); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 203, 522 S.E.2d 835, 839&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nIn deciding whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court should consider: (1) each partyâ€™s ability to pay his or her own fees; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial condition of each party; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  Upchurch v. Upchurch,&nbsp;367 S.C. 16, 28, 624 S.E.2d 643, 648-49 (2006); Browning v. Browning, 366 S.C. 255, 269, 621 S.E.2d 389, 396&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  To determine the amount of an award of attorneysâ€™ fees, the court should consider: the nature, extent, and difficulty of the services rendered; the time necessarily devoted to the case; counselsâ€™ professional standing; the contingency of compensation; the beneficial results obtained; and the customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991); Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 65, 606 S.E.2d 489, 499&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\nHere, in the family courtâ€™s prelude to awarding attorneysâ€™ fees to Husband, the court noted: â€œ[Husband] has incurred certain expenses in the bringing and maintaining of this action which would have not been necessary but for the conduct of [Wife].â€ Â After listing the amount of Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court specifically found â€œthe reason [Wife] should bear these costs is that her adultery caused the divorce in spite of [Husbandâ€™s] willingness to reconcile and her unwillingness to do so and because of the deception throughout the marriage concerning her adulterous activities and the birth of the child by [Wifeâ€™s] paramour.â€ Â A partyâ€™s fault in causing a divorce, however, is not a factor to be considered when awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Furthermore, although the family court went on to consider factors that are relevant, such as the effect ordering attorneyâ€™s fees would have on Wifeâ€™s standard of living, Wifeâ€™s ability to pay the fees, and the beneficial results obtained by Husbandâ€™s attorneys, the family court neglected to consider two factors that weigh in Wifeâ€™s favor: Husbandâ€™s ability to pay and the relative financial situations of the parties.Â  See Upchurch,&nbsp;367 S.C. at 28, 624 S.E.2d at 648-49; Browning, 366 S.C. at 269, 621 S.E.2d at 396.Â  Husband has earned a comfortable living with his construction business, and his employment status will not change as a result of the divorce.Â  Conversely, Wife has only her share of the equitable distribution with which to pay these costs and must enter the workforce after a nearly twenty-year absence. Â We further note that our opinion today has reduced the beneficial results obtained by Husband.\r\nUnder these circumstances, we hold the family court erred in ordering Wife to pay Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Considering the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fees, the beneficial results obtained by Husbandâ€™s attorneys, the partiesâ€™ respective financial conditions, and the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living, we believe Husband and Wife should be responsible for their own attorneysâ€™ fees. \r\nB. Cost of Husbandâ€™s Economic Expert\r\nWife contends the family court erred in ordering her to pay the costs of Dr. Woodside because his testimony was not relevant to equitable distribution. We agree the testimony of Dr. Woodside was irrelevant to this case and therefore hold the family court abused its discretion in ordering Wife to pay his costs.Â  \r\nAn award of litigation expenses rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and should not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 298, 473 S.E.2d 881, 889&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996).Â  The same considerations that apply to awarding attorneysâ€™ fees also apply to awarding litigation expenses.Â  Id.; see also Nienow v. Nienow, 268 S.C. 161, 173, 232 S.E.2d 504, 510&nbsp;(1977) (holding the same equitable considerations apply in awarding attorneysâ€™ fees and costs of litigation).Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means evidence having any tendency to make, the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  â€œEvidence which is not relevant is not admissible.â€Â  Rule 402,\r\nSCRE.&nbsp; \r\nAs discussed earlier, Daughterâ€™s paternity was not an issue in this case.Â  Indeed, Husbandâ€™s own pleadings acknowledged she was his daughter.Â  Therefore, the amount of money Husband spent on support for her was not relevant.Â  Accordingly, the family court erred in admitting the testimony of Dr. Woodside and ordering Wife to pay his costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe find Wife failed to preserve the issues of the family courtâ€™s identification and valuation of the marital property, determination of Daughterâ€™s paternity, and award of advancements to Husband.Â  We find the family court erred in awarding Husband seventy percent of the marital estate, and modify the division to a sixty-forty split in favor of Husband.Â  Additionally, we find the family court erred in ordering Wife to pay Husbandâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees and the fees for Dr. Woodside.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although the results of this test were not entered into evidence, Husband testified to the results without objection from Wifeâ€™s counsel.Â  Furthermore, Wife testified she â€œhad been told that [Paramour] was declared the father.â€Â  \r\n[2] To the extent the proceedings here can be interpreted as an adjudication of paternity, we note this decision has no effect on Daughter.Â  See \r\n    Palm v. General Painting Co., Inc., 302 S.C. 372, 374, 396 S.E.2d 361, 362&nbsp;(1990) (holding child is not bound by prior adjudication of paternity in divorce proceeding).\r\n[3] In defending the family courtâ€™s division, Husband points out that in Simmons v. Simmons, 275 S.C. 41, 267 S.E.2d 427 (1980), our supreme courtÂ  upheld an apportionment of twenty-three percent of marital property to wife after her affair despite her contributions to the thirty-year marriage.Â  We note, however, that this case was decided in 1980, six years prior to the enactment of section 20-7-472 of the South Carolina Code.\r\n[4] To accomplish this new division, Husbandâ€™s share of the Bank of Camden account will be reduced to $326,180, and Wifeâ€™s share of the account will be increased to $242,511.Â  With these new figures, Husband will receive $799,730 of the overall estate, and Wife will receive $533,068 of the marital estate.\r\n[5] Some of these advancements were made to Daughter.Â  The family court required Wife to reimburse Husband for half of these advancements. Â Â \r\n[6] Not only was this issue not raised to the family court in a Rule 59(e) motion, but Wife also did not object to Husband entering in evidence a document outlining these expenses.\r\n[7] Wife also asserts the family court erred in requiring her to pay Husbandâ€™s accountantâ€™s fee.Â  However, in support of this argument she merely states â€œthe accountantâ€™s fee was incorrect,â€ and she does not explain why it was incorrect.Â  Because Wife fails to point out a specific error, we deem her argument abandoned on appeal.Â  State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 16-17, 518 S.E.2d 278, 283 (Ct. App. 1999) (explaining that conclusory arguments are deemed abandoned on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4133","title":"Siau v.

Â Kassel, a licensed real estate agent, and Dozier, a licensed builder, then legally split the single lot into two separate lots by filing a new plat with Georgetown County in 1997.Â  Kassel and Dozier split the lot into two â€œflag lotsâ€ with the intention to build a house on each lot. [1] Â  \r\nKassel and Dozier built a house on one of their two newly created lots (Lot 11) and sold this property to Ray Pendleton.Â  Kassel later bought Dozierâ€™s interest in the remaining lot (Lot 12), and he became the sole owner of the property.Â  After spending several years considering whether to sell Lot 12, Kassel informed Pendleton that he was going to build his own home on the lot â€œright up to the bulkhead.â€ [2] Â  \r\nPendleton, concerned that Kasselâ€™s house would partially obstruct his view of the river, declared that Kassel could not build there and asserted he would sue him if he tried.Â  Kassel responded that he had already received approval.Â  \r\nKasselâ€™s architect, Dwayne Vernon, presented his building plan to both the Georgetown County Zoning Office and the Hagley Estates Property Ownerâ€™s Association (the Association), and this plan was approved by both.Â  Vernon also contacted the Office of Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) and the Army Corps of Engineers, and both groups stated they had no issue with him building up to the bulkhead.Â  \r\nGeorgetown County maintains a fifteen-foot rear setback requirement for Kasselâ€™s property, and the Association maintains a thirty-foot rear setback requirement. Â Kassel and his architect represented to the county zoning department that Kassel owned not only Lot 12, but also the adjacent cypress flats which lie between the bulkhead on Lot 12 and the Waccamaw River.Â  The cypress flats are strips of tidal land that lie between the mean high water mark (MHWM) and the mean low water mark of the tidal Waccamaw River. Kassel intended to use the cypress flats to comply with the rear setback requirements.Â  \r\nWhen Kassel began building his home as planned, Pendleton contacted the county zoning department to inquire about Kasselâ€™s permit.Â  Pendleton was told the permit was granted, but his concerns about Kassel building so close to the bulkhead would be investigated.Â  Having received no further response from the county, Pendleton spoke with other neighboring landowners. Â These neighbors, the Siaus, would have their view of the river completely obstructed by Kasselâ€™s house.Â  Therefore, the Siaus also contacted county zoning to prevent construction of the house.Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAfter repeatedly attempting to contact OCRM, the Army Corps of Engineers, and several county officials over a period of several months, Pendleton and the Siaus were finally able to meet with the county to review Kasselâ€™s building plans.Â  Pendleton and the Siaus contended Kassel did not own the cypress flats, and therefore, he was not in compliance with the rear setback requirements. Â The county agreed, and on August 25, 2003, approximately 120 days after construction began, the county posted a stop work order for the construction of Kasselâ€™s house.Â  \r\nKassel appealed the stop work order to the Georgetown County Construction Board of Adjustments and Appeals (the Board).Â  On September 16, 2003, a hearing was held before the Board.Â  The Board, after hearing testimony and reviewing pertinent documentation, found in favor of Kassel and rescinded the stop work order.Â  \r\nOn September 17, 2003, the Pendletons and the Siaus (collectively, Plaintiffs) filed a verified complaint against Kassel and Dozier alleging the construction on Lot 12 violated rear setback requirements.[3]Â  Accompanying this complaint was Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to temporarily restrain and preliminarily enjoin Kassel from continuing his construction during the pendency of the case.Â  Kassel and Dozier answered Plaintiffsâ€™ complaint and filed third party complaints against Georgetown County, the Association, and the State of South Carolina.[4]Â  In addition to their complaint, Plaintiffs appealed the Boardâ€™s decision to rescind the stop work order, and the trial court incorporated this separate appeal into the instant action.Â  \r\nThe trial court found in favor of Plaintiffs, restrained and enjoined Kassel from building any permanent structure within thirty feet of his rear property line, ordered him to remove all permanent structures located within thirty feet of his rear property line, and dismissed as moot Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal of the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  Kassel now appeals.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is\r\nin equity.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001).Â  On appeal of an equitable action tried by a master, the court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence. Id.Â  However, the appellate court is not required â€œto ignore the findings below when the trial court was in a better position to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assâ€™n v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 661, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  \r\nA decision whether to grant or deny an injunction is ordinarily left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664, 668, 560 S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is either unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Ledford v. Pennsylvania Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 S.E.2d 900, 383 (1976) (citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Public Trust Doctrine\r\nKassel contends his use of tidal wetlands as his rear setback does not violate the public trust doctrine.Â  Kassel argues neither his neighbors nor Georgetown County should be allowed to utilize the doctrine as a weapon to prevent his use of the cypress flats.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder the public trust doctrine, the State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.Â  McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119 (2003).Â  â€œ[N]ot only does the State hold title to this land in jus privatum, it holds it in jus publicum, in trust for the benefit of all the citizens of this State.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe Stateâ€™s presumptive title may be overcome only by showing a\r\nspecific grant from the sovereign [either the King of England or the State] which is strictly construed against the grantee.â€Â  Id. at 149 n.6, 580 S.E.2d at 119 n.6.Â  The Stateâ€™s presumptive title applies to tidelands.Â  Id. at 149-50, 580 S.E.2d at 120. \r\nKassel did not erect any structure or commit any encroachment upon land below the MHWM.Â  Therefore, we agree with his assertion that building his home up to the bulkhead does not violate the public trust doctrine.Â  However, his compliance with the doctrine is irrelevant to the disposition of this matter.Â  The only relevancy of the doctrine in this dispute is with regard to determining ownership of the cypress flats.Â  \r\nBecause Kassel admits he cannot overcome the Stateâ€™s presumption of ownership of the cypress flats, it is undisputed that he does not own this land.Â  Kassel seeks to use land he does not own to satisfy both the county and the Associationâ€™s rear setback requirements.Â  It is as a result of these setback violations, not a violation of the public trust doctrine, that Kassel has been enjoined from building his house up to the bulkhead.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nBecause Kassel does not own the cypress flats, his lot essentially ends at the bulkhead.Â  Thus, his house would have to be no less than thirty feet away from the bulkhead.Â  Kasselâ€™s house clearly violates the setback requirements in that it is less than thirty feet from the bulkhead.[5]Â  We find no error in the trial courtâ€™s interpretation and use of the public trust doctrine.\r\nII.Â  Balancing of the Equities\r\nKassel contends the trial court erred in balancing the equities.Â  He argues he should not be required to remove, redesign, and reconstruct his home when he had no knowledge or fault in creating the problem, and Plaintiffsâ€™ only damages are a diminished view of the river.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs voluntary contracts, restrictive covenants will be enforced unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.Â  Houck v. Rivers, 316 S.C. 414, 416, 450 S.E.2d 106, 108 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  The Associationâ€™s applicable restrictive covenant states: Â â€œNo residence constructed on this lot, including porches or projections, shall be erected less than thirty (30) feet from the front lot line nor thirty (30) feet from the rear lot line.â€Â  The Associationâ€™s restrictive covenants further provide that â€œany person or persons owning real property in Hagley Estates Subdivisionâ€ may seek enforcement of the restrictive covenants.Â  We do not find these restrictive covenants to be indefinite or in contravention of public policy.\r\nKassel asks us to balance the equities in the application of the restrictive covenants.Â  â€œAlthough an injunction, like all equitable remedies, is granted as a matter of sound judicial discretion, and not as a matter of legal right, the right of a plaintiff to an injunction to enforce restrictive covenants has long received special treatment.â€Â  Id. at 418, 450 S.E.2d at 109 (citation omitted).Â  Generally, a restrictive covenant will be enforced regardless of the amount of damage\r\nthat will result from the breach and even though there is no substantial monetary damage to the complainant by reason of the violation.Â  Id. at 419, 450 S.E.2d at 109.Â  â€œThe mere breach alone is grounds for injunctive relief.â€Â  Id.  \r\nBased on Houck, we do not need to reach the issue of â€œbalancing the equitiesâ€ in order to enforce restrictive covenants.Â  However, we will undertake a brief analysis.Â  In evaluating a request for injunction, the equities of both sides are to be considered, and each case must be decided on its own particular facts through a â€œbalancing of the equities.â€Â  MailSource, LLC v. M.A. Bailey &amp; Assocs., 356 S.C. 363, 368, 588 S.E.2d 635, 638 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nKasselâ€™s first indication that his ownership of the cypress flats was tenuous at best should have been when he was provided a quit-claim deed to this property in exchange for five dollars.Â  A second indication of a potential ownership problem was the fact Kassel was never able to attain title insurance for the cypress flats.Â  Kassel, a licensed real estate agent himself, should have realized that his ownership of the cypress flats was far from certain.Â  \r\nKassel argues that he received permission from all of the necessary organizations to proceed with his desired building plan, but the building plans submitted to the county zoning office and the Association represented that Kassel owned the cypress flats.Â  In fact, Kasselâ€™s architect admitted that he told the zoning officer that Kassel owned the cypress flats.Â  It was based on this misrepresentation that the zoning officer gave her approval to the building plan.Â  Additionally, prior to the commencement of any construction on Lot 12, Pendleton informed Kassel of his intent to sue if Kassel built up to the bulkhead.Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWhile removal of the partially constructed home will result in a hardship to Kassel, we find that Kassel was not without fault or knowledge of a potential problem with his desired building plan.Â  After balancing the equities, we find the granting of the permanent injunction was appropriate under the facts of this case.Â  Â Â \r\nIII.Â  Laches\r\nKassel contends Plaintiffs should have been prevented from seeking an\r\ninjunction under the equitable doctrine of laches. He argues that Plaintiffsâ€™ delay in asserting their rights was unreasonable.Â  We disagree. \r\nâ€œLaches is the negligent failure to act for an unreasonable period of time.â€Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 269, 428 S.E.2d 725, 730 (Ct. App. 1993) (emphasis in original).Â  Courts of equity will refuse to protect a partyâ€™s rights if the partyâ€™s delay in exercising those rights is unreasonable and has resulted in injury to his adversary.Â  Id.Â  A determination of laches rests within the sound discretion of the trial court and must be determined by the facts of each case.Â  Id.Â \r\nIn this case, Pendleton informed Kassel of his intent to sue before any construction on Lot 12 began.Â  During the months that followed Kassel beginning construction of his house, Plaintiffs repeatedly attempted to contact the county zoning office, the Association, OCRM, and the Army Corps of Engineers to determine their rights in this matter.Â  When Plaintiffs were finally able to meet with county zoning officers, they addressed their issues with Kasselâ€™s construction plan, and the county issued a stop work order.Â  Once the Board rescinded the stop work order on appeal, Plaintiffs diligently filed their complaint the next morning.Â  Under the facts of this case, we find Plaintiffsâ€™ delay to be reasonable.Â  \r\nIV.Â  Adjudicating Kasselâ€™s Rights Against Georgetown County\r\nKassel contends the trial court erred in not addressing Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal from the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for review. Â \r\nOne party may not â€˜bootstrapâ€™ or benefit from another partyâ€™s objection or challenge.Â  See Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 324 n.3, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 n.3 (1997). When the circuit court does not specifically address an issue, and when an issue presented to the circuit court in a civil case is not explicitly ruled upon in the final order, the issue must be raised by an appropriate post-trial motion to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Summersell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Public Safety, 337 S.C. 19, 22, 522 S.E.2d 144, 145-46 (1999).Â  Â \r\nKassel was successful in his appeal to the Board seeking rescission of the stop work order; thus he did not appeal its decision to the trial court.Â  The appeal of the Boardâ€™s order rightfully came from the aggrieved parties, the Plaintiffs.Â  In the interest of judicial economy, the trial court incorporated Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal from the Boardâ€™s order into Plaintiffsâ€™ civil suit against Kassel.Â  After finding in favor of Plaintiffs and ordering Kassel to remove all structures within thirty feet of the bulkhead and permanently enjoining him from building in that area, the trial court properly dismissed Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal of the Boardâ€™s order as moot.Â  \r\nKassel is attempting to â€œbootstrapâ€ his appeal to this court based on Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal of the Boardâ€™s decision to the trial court.Â  This simply cannot be done.Â  Kassel neither raised this issue at trial nor in his motion for reconsideration; thus, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court properly enjoined Kassel from building within thirty feet of his rear property line, ordered Kassel to remove all permanent structures located within thirty feet of his rear property line, and dismissed Plaintiffsâ€™ appeal of the Boardâ€™s decision as moot.Â  Based on the foregoing, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED.  \r\n KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n[1] â€œFlag Lotsâ€ simply refers to the irregular flag shape of the lots.Â  Flag lots are â€œreal wide on one side and very narrow on the other.â€Â  Kassel and Dozier had to configure the lots irregularly because in order for a home to be built on a lot in Georgetown County, the lot must contain 10,000 square feet or more and contain a sufficient â€œenvelopeâ€ in which to build.Â  \r\n[2] The â€œbulkheadâ€ in this case is a retaining wall built along the waterfront; it sits very near the rear property line of Lot 12.\r\n[3]Â  Dozier was named as a party based on his prior ownership of Lots 11 and 12 and the fact that he was acting as Kasselâ€™s builder in the construction of the house on Lot 12.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The Association informed the court that it did not wish to participate in the trial.Â  The Association believed no specific relief was sought against it, and its position would be adequately represented by the other parties.Â  They agreed to be bound by the courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n[5] Â Even if Kassel legally owned the cypress flats, his use of this land to satisfy the setback requirements for the construction on Lot 12 would be inappropriate because Lot 12 and the cypress flats constitute two separate lots.Â  Kassel would have had to file a new plat with the county and been permitted to join the two lots.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4134","title":"City of Beaufort v.

Harvey and Caroline Meng, both of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Â The Municipal Court of the City of Beaufort convicted Eddie Holcombe of failing to obtain a business license in violation of section 7-1001 of the Beaufort Municipal Code.Â  Holcombe appealed to the circuit court, which upheld the conviction.Â  Holcombe again appeals, arguing the Cityâ€™s ordinance violates the Equal Protection Clauses of our federal and state constitutions.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nAt the time of this action, Holcombe owned a commercial building in downtown Beaufort that was divided into multiple offices.Â  Holcombe operated his own optometry business (a professional association) in one of the offices.Â  In addition, he received rental income from an unrelated, commercial tenant occupying another office within the building.[2]Â  Holcombe admittedly paid no business license fee related to the rental of commercial property to either of these businesses.Â Â Â  \r\nOn August 14, 2003, the City of Beaufort cited Holcombe for violation of section 7-1001, which requires all persons engaged in any business, service, occupation, or profession classified by the City to obtain a business license and pay an annual license fee.[3]Â  The City contended Holcombe, as a commercial landlord, should have obtained a business license and paid fees based on the rental income generated from the property he leased to the third party.Â  Although not expressly provided for in the ordinance, the City exempts a landlord from the license fee requirements when the landlord occupies rental property for his own use or pays rent to himself.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn October 2003, the Municipal Court of the City of Beaufort found Holcombe guilty of failing to obtain a business license.Â  Acting Municipal Judge James A. Grimsley, III noted that under the Beaufort Municipal Code, a license was required for â€œ[l]essors of non-residential buildings (with gross rental income of $12,000.00 or more).â€[4]Â  The judge found Holcombe was the owner of real property in Beaufort and he had failed to obtain an annual business license based on the rental income he received on the property for the years 2000, 2001, and 2002.[5]Â  Holcombe was sentenced to thirty days in jail, suspended upon the payment of a $750.00 fine plus all amounts due under the ordinance, to include administrative penalties for nonpayment as may be provided for in the ordinance.Â Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, Holcombe challenged the constitutionality of the Cityâ€™s application of the ordinance.Â  Specifically, he contested the Cityâ€™s determination that a property owner who leases property to himself (or an entity wholly owned by him) is not in the business of leasing so as to require the payment of a business license fee, whereas a property owner who leases property to third parties is in business and thus required to pay a business license fee.Â  Holcombe argued the Cityâ€™s unwritten exemption for property owners who rented to themselves (or their alter-egos) violated his equal protection rights.Â  Â Â \r\nThe Equal Protection Clauses of our federal and state constitutions declare that no person shall be denied the equal protection of the laws.[6]Â  This â€œsimply means that no person, or class of persons, shall be denied the same protection of the laws which is enjoyed by other persons or other classes in the same place and under like circumstances.â€[7]Â  Â Â \r\n\r\nIn evaluating whether an enactment affords equal protection, we must first decide what level of scrutiny to apply.[8]Â  â€œCourts generally analyze equal protection challenges under one of three standards: Â (1) rational basis; (2) intermediate scrutiny; or, (3) strict scrutiny.â€[9]Â  â€œIf the classification does not implicate a suspect class or abridge a fundamental right, the rational basis test is used.â€[10]Â  Inherently suspect classifications include those based on factors â€œsuch as race, religion, or alienage.â€[11]Â \r\nIn this instance, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s determination that â€œlandlords do not constitute a â€˜suspectâ€™ class, [so] the â€˜rational basisâ€™ test is used.â€[12]Â  â€œTo satisfy the equal protection clause, a classification must (1) bear a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought to be achieved, (2) members of the class must be treated alike under similar circumstances, and (3) the classification must rest on some rational basis.â€[13]Â Â Â  Â Â \r\nEqual Protection Clauses are subject to a wide scope of discretion and legislative enactments are to be avoided only when they are without any reasonable basis.[14]Â  Only â€œirrational and unjustified classificationsâ€ are barred.[15] Â \r\nâ€œA municipal ordinance is a legislative enactment and is presumed to be constitutional.â€[16] â€œThe burden is upon the taxpayer to prove unconstitutionality beyond a reasonable doubt.â€[17]Â  The burden requires the attacker to negate every conceivable basis that might support it.[18]Â  The reasonableness of an ordinance is a question of law for the court to decide unless there is a controversy about the facts of the case, which must be decided by a jury.[19]Â Â Â  \r\nIn the current case, the City imposes a business license fee on â€œ[l]essors of non-residential buildings (with gross rental income of $12,000.00 or more).â€Â  Thus, the City has created two classes of commercial landlords:Â  (1) those utilizing commercial property for their own businesses, so that those businesses are their source of income, and (2) those who are renting property to third parties, so that the rental fees generated are their source of income.Â  \r\nIn finding these two groups are not similarly situated and upholding the Cityâ€™s imposition of a business license fee on Holcombeâ€™s rental income, Special Circuit Court Judge Curtis L. Coltrane reasoned as follows:\r\n\r\n  A business owner who rents his own property to himself is not in the business of renting property, but rather is in whatever business he operates from within the property.Â  The business/property owner does not offer his property for rent in the general market.Â  The business owner pays a business license fee on the business he actually operates.Â  A commercial landlord, on the other hand, operates no business from within the property he leases, and pay[s] no business license fee on the businesses operated from within the property.Â  The commercial landlord does pay a business license fee on the business he actually operates, that being the leasing of real property on the open market.Â  \r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit courtâ€™s reasoning and conclude there is a rational and reasonable basis for the Cityâ€™s classifications.Â  As noted by the circuit court, a property owner who uses commercial property for his own business is not in the â€œbusinessâ€ of renting commercial property, but rather, is in whatever business he actually operates on the property.Â  In this case, Holcombe operated an optometry business on the premises he actually occupied.Â  On the other hand, a property owner renting commercial property to third parties is in the business of renting commercial property.Â  Commercial landlords renting to third parties, as a class, are treated alike and equally in these circumstances.[20]Â  Based on the foregoing, we hold the challenged ordinance as applied is not plainly arbitrary and does not violate Holcombeâ€™s equal protection rights.[21]Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this appeal without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In his brief, Holcombe states the building is divided into two offices and he rents the second office to an unrelated business.Â  The City asserts Holcombe â€œreceives substantial rental income from the multiple commercial tenants within the building.â€Â  \r\n[3] Â â€œEvery person engaged, or intending to engage in any calling, business, service, activity, occupation or profession listed in the rate classification portion of this chapter, in whole or in part, within the limits of the city, is required to pay an annual license fee and obtain a business license as herein provided.â€Â  Beaufort Municipal Code, Ordinance Â§ 7-1001(a).Â  \r\n[4]Â  This specific language does not appear in any portion of the ordinance appearing in the Record on Appeal, but the parties do not dispute its application here and raise no issue in this regard on appeal.\r\n[5]Â  The judge applied a three-year statute of limitations.Â  \r\n[6] Â U.S. Const. amend.

Williamson and Company (collectively, â€œWilliamsonâ€) appeal from the trial courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Alfred C. Middleton.Â  Williamson argues that Middleton is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, or in the alternative, that the criteria for awarding attorneyâ€™s fees were not met in this case.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFor several years, Middleton worked for Williamson as a commissioned salesman. Â When Middleton quit working for Williamson, he was due a commission for having sold yarn pallets to one of Williamsonâ€™s customers.Â  Middleton and Williamson disagreed as to the amount of commission due, and Williamson never paid Middleton any commission, even though it acknowledged owing him $906.62.Â  \r\nAfter leaving his employment with Williamson, Middleton began working for Peninsula Plastics, Inc., one of Williamsonâ€™s pallet suppliers.Â  Middleton continued to seek the commission Williamson owed him, and sought assistance from his present attorney.Â  Middleton and his counsel are personal friends, and counsel previously had represented Middleton in less-complicated matters without charge.Â  Middletonâ€™s attorney agreed to help with the claim for commission, and the two were to discuss a fee at the end of the case. \r\nWilliamson initially was represented by Jordan &amp; Clardy, LLC.Â  Middletonâ€™s attorneys informed Williamson that they had a complaint drafted and were ready to sue in order to recover the unpaid commission.Â  Williamsonâ€™s attorney requested that Middleton refrain from acting on the drafted complaint until he could speak with his client.Â  Middleton agreed, and two days later, Williamson filed a complaint against Middleton, alleging causes of action for fraud, constructive fraud, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act. Â Middleton filed an answer, denying the allegations and counterclaiming for commissions owed and sanctions under the South Carolina Frivolous Proceedings Act.Â  Approximately one month prior to trial, Williamson hired its current counsel. \r\nOf Williamsonâ€™s claims against Middleton, only the cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty went to the jury.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Middleton on that cause of action and found in favor of Middleton on his counterclaim for unpaid commission, awarding him $906.62 in actual damages.Â  \r\nThe trial judge, Judge Pyle, ruled Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, but asked the parties to attempt to determine the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees themselves.Â  In the event they could not agree to an amount, Judge Pyle explained he would set the amount for them.Â  The parties could not come to a consensus on the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees, and Middleton petitioned the court for assistance.Â  Judge Miller awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In an unpublished opinion, Williamson v. Middleton, 2005-UP-011 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 11, 2005), this Court found that Judge Pyle had retained exclusive jurisdiction over the matter.Â  We therefore reversed Judge Millerâ€™s award and remanded the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for Judge Pyleâ€™s consideration. \r\nAt the hearing before Judge Pyle, Williamson argued Middleton was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because (1) he was not the prevailing party; (2) the bill Middletonâ€™s counsel presented documenting over $100,000 worth of work listed hours spent on claims other than the unpaid commission claim for which attorneyâ€™s fees are allowed; and (3) the amount of fees Middletonâ€™s counsel requested, $35,000, far exceeded the $906.62 verdict. Â Williamson further maintained Middleton did not incur any fees because when Middletonâ€™s counsel was deposed, he admitted there was no fee agreement between him and Middleton.Â  \r\nJudge Pyle acknowledged that Middleton and his attorney had not entered into a formal, written fee agreement, but relied instead â€œon their long-standing personal relationship and mutual agreement to determine an appropriate fee for services at the conclusion of this matter.â€ Â The judge found such an agreement did not preclude attorneyâ€™s fees. Â Accordingly, Judge Pyle awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Williamson filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which was denied.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThere must be sufficient evidence in the record to support each of the six factors analyzed for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  See Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal, absent sufficient evidentiary support on the record for each factor, the award should be reversed and the issue remanded for the trial court to make specific findings of fact.â€Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, 310 S.C. 492, 494, 427 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1993).Â  \r\nThe interpretation of a statute is not a finding of fact.Â  Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 21 S.E.2d 34 (1942).Â  â€œThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.â€Â  Jeter v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., Op. No. 26168 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 19, 2006) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at 43) (citing Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d (1991); see also Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C.

Town of Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 471 S.E.2d 137 (1996); Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996); Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 (1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWilliamson first argues Middleton is not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because he does not meet the requirements of section 39-65-30 of the South Carolina Code.Â  Specifically, Williamson points out that this statute only applies to sales representatives who seek to recover commissions on â€œwholesaleâ€ sales, and the commission awarded to Middleton was from a sale made to the ultimate consumer.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nInitially, we note that the arguments Williamson made to Judge Pyle on this issue are not reflected in the record on appeal.Â  Williamson did not advance this argument at the hearing before Judge Pyle, and although Williamsonâ€™s counsel refers to a memorandum she filed in opposition to Middletonâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees, that memorandum was not included in the record on appeal.Â  See Taylor v. Taylor, 294 S.C. 296, 299, 363 S.E.2d 909, 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThe burden is on the appellant to furnish a sufficient record on appeal from which this court can make an intelligent review.â€).Â  We acknowledge, however, that Judge Pyle addressed the argument in his order awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, suggesting the argument was set forth in Williamsonâ€™s memorandum.Â  In the order, Judge Pyle found Williamsonâ€™s argument that Middleton was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs pursuant to section 39-65-30 came too late because during trial, Williamson never objected to the jury instructions referencing section 39-65-30, nor did Williamson challenge Judge Pyleâ€™s initial ruling that Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nIn its brief to our court, Williamson argues that â€œ[e]ven though the jury returned a verdict . . . that awarded Middleton $906.62 for unpaid commissions, this recovery was sought on alternate grounds, both pursuant to Â§ 39-65-30 and Â§ 41-10-10.â€Â  In so arguing, Williamson implies the juryâ€™s award was based on a statute other than section 39-65-30.Â  Williamson further contends that its argument on this issue is timely because â€œthe request for attorney fees is predicated on entirely different factors than was the request for commissions.â€Â  From the record before us, there is no indication this specific argument was ever made to the trial court, either prior to the order awarding attorneyâ€™s fees or in Williamsonâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  Thus, the issue is not preserved for review.Â  See Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€); see also Floyd v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005) (â€œâ€˜Imposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.â€™â€) (quoting Iâ€™On, L.L.C v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000)); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€).\r\nNext, Williamson argues Middleton failed to prove the elements necessary to recover fees.Â  We agree.\r\nThe general rule is that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.Â  Blumberg v. Nealco, Inc.,&nbsp; 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660&nbsp;(1993) (citing Baron Data Sys., Inc. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296 (1989); Hegler v. Gulf Ins.

Number One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 467 S.E.2d 439 (1996); Blumberg, 310 S.C. 492, 427 S.E.2d 659; Baron Data, 297 S.C. 382, 377 S.E.2d 296; Dowaliby v.

App. 1990)).\r\nSection 39-65-30 provides:\r\n\r\n  A principal who fails to comply with the provisions of Section 39-65-20 is liable to the sales representative in a civil action for:\r\n  \r\n    (1)Â  all amounts due the sales representative plus punitive damages in an amount not to exceed three times the amount of commissions due the sales representative; and\r\n    (2)Â  attorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably incurred by the sales representative in the action and court costs.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 (Supp. 2005).Â  The jury awarded Middleton the unpaid commission pursuant to section 39-65-20.Â  Therefore, we are dealing with a statutory attorneyâ€™s fee provision.Â  \r\n When awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must consider the following six factors: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Baron Data, 297 S.C. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297.Â  When awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, â€œthere is no requirement that [the fees] be less than or comparable to a partyâ€™s monetary judgment.â€Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).\r\nHere, Middleton incurred no attorneyâ€™s fees because no fee agreement existed between Middleton and his attorney.Â  In his deposition, Middletonâ€™s lead counsel stated:\r\n\r\n  [W]e donâ€™t have a fee agreement with Mr. Middleton.Â  We talked about this with Mr. Middleton to begin with and we decided that we would try to help him collect the monies due him and at the end of the case, we would talk about a fee.Â  So we donâ€™t have a fee agreement with him. Â But some day, he might pay us a fee.Â  Right now, he has no obligation at this point if there is no agreement.Â  He might feel a moral obligation.Â  And when we talk at the end of the case, he will have the final say.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nCounselâ€™s testimony admits there was no fee agreement with Middleton.Â  Consequently, there is no obligation to pay, and no fees have been incurred.\r\nHopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (2000), involved Fatherâ€™s action to recover overpayment of child support and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The court found Father was entitled to reimbursement of child support overpayments, but held he could not recover attorneyâ€™s fees because his current wife represented him and they did not have a fee agreement.Â  The court began its analysis by noting that Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 529 S.E.2d 14 (2000), held a pro se litigant could not recover attorneyâ€™s fees because â€œa pro se litigant, whether an attorney or layperson, does not become â€˜liable for or subject to fees charged by an attorney.â€™â€Â  343 S.C. at 306, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â  The Hopkins court declared:\r\n\r\n  [H]ere, we find no evidence Father actually became â€œliable for or subject toâ€ attorneysâ€™ fees for his attorney/wifeâ€™s service.Â  There is no contract or fee agreement in the record, nor is there any indication or testimony that Fatherâ€™s wife/attorney has attempted or intends to collect the fees from Father. Â Accordingly, Father did not prove that he became liable for the fees, such that the family court properly denied Fatherâ€™s request.\r\n\r\n343 S.C. at 307, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â  \r\nThe rationale of Hopkins is equally applicable in the instant case.Â  Both Calhoun and Hopkins focused on the litigantsâ€™ lack of liability for attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Here, Middletonâ€™s counsel admits Middleton â€œhas no obligation at this point if there is no agreement.â€Â  There is no agreement; therefore, Middleton owes no obligation to pay, and no fees were incurred.Â  Under these facts the trial judge erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nBecause we reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees on this ground, we need not address Williamsonâ€™s arguments that Middleton was not the prevailing party and that the fees awarded were unreasonable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that in South Carolina there must be an agreement between counsel and client in order for a court to award attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  In the case sub judice, there is unequivocally no agreement to pay attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, the award of fees is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nCURETON, A.J., concurs.\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Because I believe a party can recover attorneyâ€™s fees absent a formal agreement, I respectfully disagree with the majorityâ€™s reversal of the $35,000 award of fees to Middleton.Â  It is well-settled that â€œ[w]here an attorneyâ€™s services and their value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Baron Data Sys. v. Loter, 297 S.C. 382, 384, 377 S.E.2d 296, 296 (1989) (emphasis added).Â  Here, there is evidence supporting the trial courtâ€™s determination that Middleton and his attorneys had an informal agreement to â€œdetermine an appropriate fee for services at the conclusion of this matter.â€Â  Therefore, I vote to affirm.Â  \r\nAs the majority points out, Middletonâ€™s lead counsel stated in his deposition: \r\n\r\n  [W]e donâ€™t have a fee agreement with Mr. Middleton.Â  We talked about this with Mr. Middleton to begin with and we decided that we would try to help him collect the monies due him and at the end of the case, we would talk about a fee.Â  So we donâ€™t have a fee agreement with him. But some day, he might pay us a fee.Â  Right now, he has no obligation at this point if there is no agreement.Â  He might feel a moral obligation.Â  And when we talk at the end of the case, he will have the final say.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  While this testimony could be interpreted to mean Middleton would never be required to pay a fee, it also indicates that Middleton and his attorneys would discuss a fee at the end of the case.Â Â  The trial judge adopted this latter interpretation, and based on our standard of review, I do not believe we can second-guess his conclusion.[1]Â  \r\nBecause there was testimony evidencing counselâ€™s intent to discuss a fee with Middleton, I believe this case is easily distinguished from Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 540 S.E.2d 454 (2000).Â  In Hopkins, the supreme court upheld the family courtâ€™s determination that Husband was not entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees when he was represented at trial by his attorney/wife.Â  In so doing, the supreme court did not merely rely on a lack of a fee agreement, but also stressed there was no â€œindication or testimony that [appellantâ€™s] wife/attorney intends to collect the fees from [appellant].â€Â  Id. at 307, 540 S.E.2d at 457.Â  Here, there was evidence Middleton and his attorney would discuss fees at the conclusion of the case.Â  \r\nThe majority finds Middleton did not incur any attorneyâ€™s fees because he and his attorneys did not have a fee agreement.Â  However, the lack of a formal fee agreement does not preclude an attorney from collecting fees.Â  See Singleton v. Collins, 251 S.C. 208, 210-11, 161 S.E.2d 246, 247 (1968) (â€œAn attorney has a right to be paid for professional services rendered, and where there is no express contract, the law will imply one.â€).Â  Although the Singleton case is procedurally different from the case at hand, its determination regarding attorneyâ€™s fees is instructive.Â  In Singleton, an attorney filed an action to collect fees after rendering services to a client in a domestic relations action.Â  Despite the lack of a formal contract, the trial court implied a contract and determined the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees owed.Â  Our supreme court upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision, noting: â€œWhether the services were rendered, and their value, are matters of fact to be decided . . . by the court below, and no appeal lies therefrom if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Id. at 211, 161 S.E.2d at 247.\r\nAlthough Singleton involves the collection of attorneyâ€™s fees from a client rather than an opposing party, it illustrates that the lack of a formal agreement is not fatal to an attorneyâ€™s claim for fees.Â  Here, the trial judge was not precluded from awarding attorneyâ€™s fees simply because Middleton and his attorneys lacked a written agreement.Â  Rather, so long as there was evidence Middletonâ€™s attorneys intended to collect a fee, the trial judge had discretion to award the fee.Â  Not only did Judge Pyle find there was such evidence, but Judge Miller, whose ruling was reversed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, found an informal agreement existed as well.Â  Because there is evidence in the record to support the findings of these two outstanding trial judges, I vote to affirm their determination that a fee had been incurred. \r\nIn addition to its argument that Middleton did not incur attorneyâ€™s fees, Williamson also argues Middleton failed to prove the other elements necessary to recover fees, or in the alternative, that the fees awarded were unreasonably high.Â  I disagree.\r\nWhen awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, the trial court must consider the following six factors: (1) the nature, extent and difficulty of the legal services rendered; (2) the time and labor necessarily devoted to the case; (3) the professional standing of counsel; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the fee customarily charged in the locality for similar legal services; and (6) the beneficial results obtained.Â  Baron Data Sys, Inc., v. Loter, 297 S.C. at 384-85, 377 S.E.2d at 297.Â  â€œWhere an attorneyâ€™s services and their value are determined by the trier of fact, an appeal will not prevail if the findings of fact are supported by any competent evidence.â€Â  Id. at 384, 377 S.E.2d at 296 (emphasis added).Â  Here, Judge Pyle made specific findings on each of the six elements, and there is evidence in the record supporting those findings.Â  \r\nWilliamson also argues that even if we find Middleton was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees, the amount of attorneyâ€™s fees awarded was unreasonable in light of the beneficial results Middleton received.Â  However, â€œthere is no requirement that attorneyâ€™s fees be less than or comparable to a partyâ€™s monetary judgment.â€Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 331 S.C. 575, 580, 503 S.E.2d 458, 461 (1998).Â  Furthermore, although a $35,000 attorneyâ€™s fee may initially seem high for a cause of action for unpaid commissions, especially when the action resulted in a $906.62 verdict, under the peculiar circumstances of this case, there was evidence in the record supporting the trial judgeâ€™s finding that $35,000 was a reasonable amount to award.Â  First and foremost, it is important to note that Middletonâ€™s attorney did not institute this lawsuit.Â  Rather, in the best tradition of the profession, he attempted to settle this matter with Williamson, and at the specific request of opposing counsel, Middleton delayed bringing suit.Â  However, within a matter of days, Williamson filed suit against Middleton.Â  In order to litigate his cause of action for unpaid commissions, Middleton had to defend himself against Williamsonâ€™s claim against him for breach of fiduciary duty, which is an affirmative defense for unpaid commissions.Â  Additionally, Middleton submitted affidavits demonstrating how Williamson employed dilatory tactics prior to the trial of this case, such as persuading Middleton to withhold from filing its complaint so that it could be the first file a complaint, cancelling depositions on the afternoon before or the morning of their scheduled time, and submitting incomplete responses to Middletonâ€™s requests for discovery.[2] Based on the detailed bills submitted by Middletonâ€™s attorneys and the difficulties they faced in trying their case, I find competent evidence supports the trial judgeâ€™s award of $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, I vote to affirm the trial courtâ€™s order.\r\n\r\n[1] If the trial judge had refused to award Middleton fees in the present case, I would vote to affirm that determination also, as there is evidence in the record to support it.Â  \r\n[2] Williamsonâ€™s current counsel was not yet involved in this case when the complaint was filed, nor was she involved when these pre-trial delays occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4136","title":"Ardis v.

Jefferson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4136\r\nHeard October 6, 2005 â€“ Filed July 10, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Ellis I. Kahn and Justin S. Kahn, both of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n        Charles E. Hill and R. Hawthorne Barrett, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  In this appeal of a chiropractic malpractice action, Diane B. Ardis and William David Ardis raise issues concerning the exclusion of evidence, jury instructions, and the trial courtâ€™s refusal to strike the cross-examination of Diane Ardisâ€™s treating physician based on ex parte contact with the opposing side.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn their complaint filed June 1, 2001, Diane and William Ardis (collectively â€œArdisâ€) alleged that Edward L. Sessions negligently injured Diane by performing spinal manipulations on February 19, 1996.Â  Ardis claims Sessionsâ€™s negligence caused a ruptured or herniated disk in Dianeâ€™s back, an increase in the severity of her initial injury, and ultimately the need for back surgery.Â  Sessions denied that he performed a manipulation on that date.Â  His notes indicate Dianeâ€™s disk was herniated when she fell from a ladder prior to coming to his office on February 19.[1]Â  At trial, Sessions testified that instead of a manipulation that day, he used a less invasive treatment, which would have been insufficient to herniate Dianeâ€™s disk. \r\nAt an in camera hearing, Sessions, who served as a municipal court judge for the City of Hanahan, moved to prevent Ardis from making an inquiry into his public reprimand by the South Carolina Supreme Court. In 2000, the Sessions was reprimanded for acts of judicial misconduct, which included making and directing the making of false entries in judicial records.Â  See In re Sessions, 342 S.C. 427, 538 S.E.2d 1 (2000).Â  Sessions also moved in limine to exclude any mention of his billing practices in regard to his different fee schedules for individuals and insurance carriers.Â  The trial court granted Sessionsâ€™s motions.\r\nAt trial, Ardis objected to the following instructions given by the trial court regarding the applicable standard of care: [2]\r\n\r\n  The law does not require of him absolute accuracy either in his practice or his judgment . . . It does not even require of him the utmost degree of care and skill of which the human mind is capable. \r\n  I instruct you that a physician is not an insurer of a cure or even of a beneficial result; thus, the mere fact that a treatment is not beneficial or that it is even harmful will not of itself raise a presumption of negligence . . . I instruct you that a bad result of the failure to cure is not by itself insufficient to raise an inference or a presumption of negligence on the part of a physician.\r\n  I charge you that a physician is not ordinarily liable for making an incorrect diagnosis where it is made in good faith and there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of the physical conditions involved or as to what should be done in accordance with recognized authority in good current practice or where it is made in good faith on observation of the patient. \r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict for Sessions.Â  The trial court denied Ardisâ€™s motion for JNOV, or in the alternative for a new trial.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nArdis contends the trial court erred in instructing the jury regarding the applicable standard of care for a medical malpractice claim.Â  Specifically, Ardis argues the instruction given by the trial court raised the standard to a subjective standard, meaning that Ardisâ€™s burden of proof would require a showing that any error of judgment was made in bad faith.Â  We agree. [3]\r\nA trial court is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina. Â Cohens v. Atkins, 333 S.C. 345, 349, 509 S.E.2d 286, 289 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  â€œThe substance of the law is what must be instructed to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  . . .Â  A jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.â€ Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 391, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  When reviewing a jury charge for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial. Â Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œWhere a request to charge is timely made and involves a controlling legal principle, a refusal by the trial judge to charge the request constitutes reversible error.â€Â  Koutsogiannis v. BB&amp;T, 365 S.C. 145, 149, 616 S.E.2d 425, 427-28 (2005).Â  To warrant reversal for refusal to give a requested instruction, the refusal must have not only been erroneous, but prejudicial as well.Â  Cohens, 333 S.C. at 349, 509 S.E.2d at 289; see also Daves, 355 S.C. at 224, 584 S.E.2d at 427 (stating a circuit courtâ€™s refusal to give a properly requested charge is reversible error only when the requesting party can demonstrate prejudice from the refusal).\r\nThe instructions given in the instant case are very similar to those addressed in the case of McCourt by and through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995).Â  In that case, McCourt, through the personal representative of her estate, filed a medical malpractice action against a doctor in connection with her death from sepsis.Â  The defendant argued the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  When a physician exercises ordinary care and skill in keeping within recognized and proven methods, he is not liable for the result of a bona fide mistake in judgment.Â  \r\n  A physician is not ordinarily liable for making an incorrect diagnosis where it is made in good faith and there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of the physical condition involved or as to what should be done in accordance with recognized authority and good current practice, or where it is made in good faith observation of a patient.Â  \r\n  A physician cannot be held liable for a mere error in judgment.Â  \r\n  When a physician exercises ordinary care and skill in keeping with recognized and proven methods he is not liable for the result of a mere mistake of judgment or for a bad result which does not occur because of any negligence on his part.\r\n\r\nMcCourt, 318 S.C. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.Â  \r\nIn affirming the refusal to give the charge requested, the supreme court stated that such a jury instruction impermissibly implied â€œto the jury that an error in judgment is actionable only if made in bad faith.â€Â  Id. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.Â  The court reasoned that this would â€œimpose an unrealistic burden on the plaintiff to prove the doctorâ€™s judgment was rendered with less than good faith.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nLike the proposed instruction in McCourt, the trial courtâ€™s instruction in this case impermissibly implied to the jury that any error in judgment by Sessions would be actionable only if rendered in bad faith.Â  Such an implication prejudiced Ardis because it imposed the same â€œunrealistic burdenâ€ disapproved of in McCourt. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J. concurs.\r\nBEATTY, J. dissents in a separate opinion.Â  \r\nBEATTY, J. (dissenting): I respectfully dissent.Â  When reviewing a jury instruction for alleged error, the appellate court must consider the charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  Davis v. Cleary, 355 S.C. 216, 224, 584 S.E.2d 423, 427 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œIf the charge is reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe majority rests its decision on a comparison of a small portion of the trial courtâ€™s instructions to a substantial part of the requested instructions in McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 457 S.E.2d 603 (1995).Â  \r\nIn McCourt, the trial courtâ€™s decision not to give requested instructions was affirmed.Â  Although the court did not identify any specific offending jury charge requested, the court noted that the requested charges may be confusing to the jury.Â  The court stated, â€œSome of the charges imply to the jury that an error in judgment is actionable only if made in bad faith.Â  Such an instruction would impose an unrealistic burden on the plaintiff to prove the doctorâ€™s judgment was rendered in less than good faith.â€Â  McCourt, 318 S.C. at 306, 457 S.E.2d at 606.Â  Although the phrase â€œgood faithâ€ was used in a requested charge on making a diagnosis, the phrase was never actually used in an â€œerror in judgmentâ€ charge in McCourt.Â  Rather, a specific charge on â€œerror in judgmentâ€ implied that bad faith was required to find the doctor liable.[4]Â  In my view, the McCourt decision is based upon the full consideration of the jury instructions in total, not the mere use of the phrase â€œgood faith.â€Â  \r\nAlthough similar, in part, the jury instruction here is significantly different from McCourt.Â  Here, the trial courtâ€™s â€œerror in judgmentâ€ charge stated:\r\n\r\n  I further charge you that when there is more than one recognized method of treatment, the physician is at liberty to follow any such recognized treatment.Â  There may be more than one school of thought as to the proper treatment for a particular illness.Â  In cases where there is a difference of opinion between competent medical authorities, a physician will not be liable if, in the exercise of his judgment, he followed a course of treatment supported by reputable, respectable and reasonable medical experts.\r\n\r\nMoreover, considering the trial courtâ€™s instructions here as a whole, they are substantially correct, reasonably free of error, and do not tend to confuse the jury as to what is required to establish liability.Â  The trial court gave the following instruction:\r\n\r\n  I instruct you that when a chiropractor undertakes to treat a patient, the law requires him to use reasonable care and diligence in the exercise of his skill and in the application of his learning to accomplish the purpose for which he was employed.Â  The chiropractor is required by law to use his best judgment in exercising his skill and applying his knowledge.Â  And the law would, therefore, hold a chiropractor liable for any injury to his patient resulting from want or lack of the requisite or required knowledge or skill or the omission to exercise reasonable care or the failure to use his best judgment.Â  Therefore, a chiropractorâ€™s duty in treating his patients is to be measured by both his skill and diligence.\r\n  If, by lack of the required skill, a chiropractor fails to properly treat his patient so that the patient is injured thereby or his condition is made worse than it would have been otherwise, then the chiropractor would be liable for any injury proximately caused to the patient.Â  He would also be liable if having the required or requisite skill, he negligently fails to use it or if he is not as careful and diligent in the treatment to the extent that he should be, which is to say as careful and diligent as a physician of ordinary prudence would have been under the same circumstances.\r\n  In a case such as this, negligence is the failure to do that which an ordinarily, careful and prudent chiropractor would do under the same circumstances; or, it is the doing of that which an ordinarily prudent chiropractor would not have done under the existing circumstances.\r\n  Negligence on the part of a chiropractor is not presumed, but must be affirmatively proved.Â  I told you earlier that the burden of proof was on the plaintiffs to prove their case by the preponderance or the greater weight of the evidence.Â  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it will be presumed that a chiropractor has fully discharged his duty to the patient.Â  \r\n  The burden of proof of negligence, proximate cause and injury in a malpractice case is on the plaintiff throughout.Â  In order to establish liability in a malpractice case, the plaintiff must prove by a preponderance of the evidence the following things:Â  what the recognized and generally accepted standards, practices and procedures which would be exercised by competent chiropractors under similar circumstances: the physician in question Â negligently deviated from the generally accepted standards practices and procedures; such negligent deviation from the generally accepted standards, practices and procedures was a proximate cause of the plaintiffâ€™s injury; and that the plaintiff was injured.\r\n  I instruct you that a physician is not an insurer of a cure or even of a beneficial result; thus, the mere fact that a treatment is not beneficial or that it is even harmful will not of itself raise a presumption of negligence.\r\n  Injury and suffering are not alone sufficient to support a cause of action for malpractice unless it is shown by the greater weight of the evidence that the physician did not possess the degree of skill common to other physicians or that he failed to use such skill in the treatment of the patient. \r\n  I instruct you that a bad result or the failure to cure is not by itself sufficient to raise an inference or a presumption of negligence on the part of a physician.Â  Thus, if you find that the defendant in this case used due care and skill in treating the patient and that the physician followed recognized medical procedures and despite this, the patient suffered injuries, the fact of injury alone is not evidence of negligence and your verdict in such case should be for the defendant.\r\n  I instruct you, Madame Forelady and members of the jury, that you are not permitted to arbitrarily set up a standard of your own in determining whether the defendantâ€™s learning skill and conduct fulfilled the duties imposed upon him by law.Â  The standard is that which I have already indicated, that is, did the chiropractor exercise that degree of knowledge, care and skill possessed by members of his specialty in good standing in the same or similar circumstances?\r\n  I further charge you that when the opinions of medical experts are relied upon to establish causal connection of negligence to injury, the proper test to be applied is that the expert must, with reasonable certainty, state that, in his professional opinion, the injuries complained of most probably resulted from the alleged negligence of the defendant.\r\n  Jurors are to apply the same standards of evaluation of expert witness testimony as applied to other witnesses.Â  It is for the jury to judge the credibility of the expert witnesses, as well as any other witnesses, and to decide what weight, if any, is attached to the expert testimony, as well as the testimony of any other witnesses.\r\n  . . .\r\n  I further charge you that in considering whether a physician has exercised reasonable judgment in a given case, you must consider such judgment in relationship to the facts as they existed at the time the judgment was made and not in light of what hindsight may reveal.\r\n  I further charge you that a mistake in diagnosis of itself will not support a verdict in a malpractice suit.Â  I charge you that a physician is not ordinarily liable for making an incorrect diagnosis where it is made in good faith and there is reasonable doubt as to the nature of the physical conditions involved or as to what should be done in accordance with recognized authority in good current practice or where it is made in good faith on observation of the patient and based upon physical evidences and symptoms which would warrant such diagnosis by a reasonably prudent and informed physician.\r\n  I further charge you that when there is more than one recognized method of treatment, the physician is at liberty to follow any such recognized treatment.Â  There may be more than one school of thought as to the proper treatment for a particular illness.Â  In cases where there is a difference of opinion between competent medical authorities, a physician will not be liable if, in the exercise of his judgment, he followed a course of treatment supported by reputable, respectable and reasonable medical experts.\r\n  I charge you that the question of whether a physician in making a diagnosis deviated from applicable standard of care either by not employing a particular procedure or by not ordering a particular test, is to be determined by what an ordinary, careful and prudent physician would have done under the same or similar circumstances.\r\n  I further charge you that the degree of skill and care a physician must use in diagnosing a condition is that which would be exercised by a competent practitioner in the defendant doctorâ€™s field of chiropractic.\r\n  In order to find for the plaintiffs in a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff must show by the greater weight of the evidence that the physician did not possess the degree of skill common to other doctors in defendantâ€™s field of medicine, or that he failed or was negligent in so exercising such skills in the treatment of a patient.\r\n  There must be a failure to do that which an ordinary, careful and prudent physician in the defendantâ€™s field of medicine would do under the same or similar circumstances shown by the evidence to have existed at the time of the transaction in question; or, it was the doing of that which an ordinary, careful and prudent physician in defendantâ€™s field of medicine would not have done under the same or similar circumstances known to have existed at the time of the transaction in question.\r\n\r\nA jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 392, 574 S.E.2d 215, 220 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1] Ardis claims that she received spinal manipulations merely to limber up for an upcoming ski trip and that she mentioned falling off of a ladder in jest.\r\n[2] Ardis also objected to additional elements of the charge and requested an additional charge on spoliation of evidence.\r\n[3] Because we reverse on this issue, we decline to address Ardisâ€™s remaining arguments.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[4] This charge provided:\r\n\r\n  Request # 5:Â  A physician cannot be held liable for a mere error in judgment.Â  Where, according to standard medical practice, the diagnosis and course of treatment involved are matters to be subjected to the judgment of the physician, a physician must be allowed the exercise of that judgment and he cannot be held liable if in the exercise of the judgment he has made a mistake as to the course of treatment to be taken.\r\n\r\nMcCourt v.

Smith, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Jane Doe and Robert Roe (the students) filed this action against Barnwell School District 45 and the Barnwell County Sheriffâ€™s Department alleging, inter alia, gross negligence in hiring and supervising personnel and resource officers.Â  The trial court dismissed the action against the district for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS[2]\r\nThe students attended Barnwell County High School.Â  During a football game on September 19, 2003, a police officer and a deputy sheriff discovered the students sitting in the back seat of an automobile parked on school grounds. Â Another deputy sheriff, who was a resource officer at the school, joined them at the car.Â  The police officer informed the deputies that he did not observe any inappropriate behavior or contact between the students.[3] Â The officer left the students in the care of the deputies.Â  The deputies questioned the students after escorting them to a school office.Â  The principal and two assistant principals were present and participated in the questioning. Â \r\nThe students claim one of the deputies â€œattempted to intimidate and humiliate [Roe] by screaming, insulting, threatening, and other inappropriate language.â€Â  The studentsâ€™ parents were summoned to the school and informed their children had engaged in sexual activity while on school grounds.Â  As a result, Doeâ€™s parents took her to a hospital to undergo medical testing to determine if she had engaged in sexual intercourse.Â  The medical examination determined Doe had never engaged in sexual intercourse.Â  Although the principal initially threatened the students with expulsion or ten days suspension, she ultimately suspended them for only five days.Â  The students appealed the principalâ€™s decision to the school board, which upheld the suspension. Â \r\nThe students then filed this action.Â  As to the district, the students alleged the principal failed to protect them and the district failed to properly train and supervise the principal and resource officers.Â  The trial court dismissed the suit against the district for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because it found the students were attempting to â€œcircumvent the prohibition against appealing short-term student suspensions . . . .â€Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œ[S]ubject matter jurisdiction is a question of law for the court.â€\r\nÂ Murphy v.

Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003).Â  Questions of law may be decided with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe students, contending their suit is based on gross negligence arising from the interrogation, argue the trial court erred in finding the lawsuit pertained to a school suspension and dismissing the complaint for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We agree.[4]\r\nâ€œSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Eagle Container Co. v. County of Newberry, 366 S.C. 611, 633-34, 622 S.E.2d 733, 744 (Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted).Â  In\r\nByrd v. Irmo High School, the supreme court found that South Carolina law does not provide for judicial review of student suspensions of ten days or less. Â 321 S.C. 426, 432-36, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864-67 (1996).Â  The court later qualified that holding to allow judicial review of a temporary suspension where the student challenges the suspension as violative of due process.Â \r\nFloyd v. Horry County Sch. Dist., 351 S.C. 233, 236-37, 569 S.E.2d 343, 345 (2002) (finding due process for students suspended ten days or less requires: Â (1) oral or written notice of the charges; (2) an explanation of the evidence; and (3) an opportunity to present their side of the story).\r\nThe trial court agreed with the districtâ€™s contention that the single reference in the claim to section 59-19-560 of the South Carolina Code as the basis for the trial courtâ€™s jurisdiction justifies characterizing the entire action as a challenge of the temporary suspensions.[5] Â Although this section appears to give the circuit court jurisdiction over appeals of suspensions, the court in Byrd found that the more recently enacted, specific statute, section 59-63-230, essentially superseded section 59-19-560 by providing for appeal to the board of trustees.Â  See \r\nByrd, 321 S.C. at 434-35, 468 S.E.2d at 866; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-230 (2004).Â  Therefore, if this were solely an appeal of the suspension, the circuit court would lack jurisdiction.\r\nIn construing a complaint, however, the court must review the entire pleading.Â  Smith v. Nelson, 83 S.C. 294, 300, 65 S.E. 261, 263 (1909) (construing the â€œcomplaint upon the wholeâ€).Â  A review of the complaint as a whole in this case does not support the districtâ€™s argument that the students brought this action to appeal suspensions.Â  See Rule 8(f), SCRCP (providing that all pleadings must be construed to do substantial justice to all parties);\r\nGaskins v. S. Farm Bureau Cas. Ins. Co., 343 S.C. 666, 671, 541 S.E.2d 269, 271 (Ct. App. 2000), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds, 354 S.C. 416, 581 S.E.2d 169 (2003) (â€œTo ensure substantial justice to the parties, the pleadings must be liberally construed.â€).Â  As stated in the complaint, the causes of action against the district are â€œGross Negligence and Gross Negligence in Hiring and Supervision.â€ Â The complaint does not request relief from the suspensions.Â  The suspensions merely arose out of the same situation as the alleged wrongful conduct by the district.Â  Unlike Floyd and Byrd, this case is based on the conduct of school officials and resource officers in the manner of interrogation and investigation rather than the wrongful imposition of suspensions.[6]  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court erred in dismissing the action for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based solely on a finding that the action was an attempt to appeal short-term suspensions.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The names of the minor plaintiffs have been changed and the names of their guardians have been redacted to protect the minorsâ€™ identities.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The facts related here are as alleged in the complaint.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The district contends the students were engaged in inappropriate sexual activity.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; Additionally, the students claim the trial court erred in failing to allow them to amend the complaint to remove a paragraph referencing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-560 (Rev. 2004).Â  Because we determine the trial court had jurisdiction over the complaint as it was written, determining whether the students should have been allowed to amend is unnecessary. \r\n[5]&nbsp; Section 59-19-560 provides:Â  â€œAny party aggrieved by the order of the county board of education shall have the right to appeal to the court of common pleas . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-19-560 (Rev. 2004).Â  \r\n[6]&nbsp; At oral argument, the issue of the ultimate viability of this action was briefly mentioned.Â  We venture no opinion on the merits of this action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4138","title":"Clay v.

Â The decree designated Mother as the primary residential parent and ordered that Father receive visitation.Â  Both parties remarried and continued to reside in Florida.Â  However, after several domestic disputes involving Mother and her new husband, the Juvenile Division of the Florida circuit court granted temporary custody to Father. Â Eventually, the court made Father the permanent, primary residential parent of the child and granted Mother supervised and telephone visitation.Â  \r\nOn July 23, 2002, Mother moved to establish unsupervised visitation, to address counseling for the child, and other related issues.Â  Additionally, on August 15, 2002, Mother filed a motion seeking to prevent the removal of the child from the jurisdiction of the Florida court.Â  On August 26, 2002, Father submitted a letter supplying the court with his new address and informing it that as of August 19, 2002, he lived in South Carolina.Â  \r\nThereafter, Mother filed a supplemental motion in the Florida court to modify custody or visitation.Â  The court found Father was to continue to serve as the primary residential parent, but Mother was to have unsupervised visitation with the child.Â  Mother traveled to South Carolina in an attempt to exercise visitation with the child for the Thanksgiving 2003 holiday, but she, even with assistance from South Carolina law enforcement officers, was unable to locate Father or the child.Â  \r\nOn December 17, 2003, Mother filed a motion for contempt in the Florida court seeking to compel Fatherâ€™s compliance with the courtâ€™s visitation order.Â  At the contempt hearing, Father appeared only through counsel.Â  The court issued an order finding Father to be in willful contempt of its previous order granting Mother visitation.Â  In support of its finding of contempt, the court found Father refused to allow visitation or any contact by telephone or mail. Â Further, the court found Father was incapable of performing his duties as primary residential parent, and the situations that caused Mother to lose custody no longer existed.Â  The circuit court ordered â€œas a sanction for [Fatherâ€™s] contemptuous conduct and pursuant to Florida Statute 61.13(4)(c)(5), [Mother] will hereafter be designated as the primary residential parent.â€Â  \r\nMother traveled to South Carolina to pick up the child as provided by the Florida courtâ€™s order, but Father would not allow her to take the child.Â  As a result, Mother filed an action in South Carolina family court to enforce the Florida courtâ€™s order making her the primary residential parent.Â  The South Carolina family court held a hearing and issued a bench order for the sheriff to locate the child and place him in the custody of Mother.Â  Father refused to turn the child over, obtained a new attorney, and filed a motion in the South Carolina family court to reconsider, alter, or amend the previous order requiring him to relinquish custody.Â  \r\nOn August 31, 2004, the South Carolina family court held a hearing on Fatherâ€™s motion.Â  In addition, it held an emergency hearing regarding the custody of the child.Â  The court issued its order finding the Florida court did not have jurisdiction over the child because South Carolina was the home state of the child at the time Mother brought the last custody related action in Florida.Â  The South Carolina family court vacated its previous order and declared it would not follow the Florida circuit court order that awarded Mother custody.Â  In a separate order, the family court awarded Father custody of the child and ordered the child not be removed from South Carolina.Â  Additionally, the South Carolina court found Mother was entitled to supervised visitation as she and Father could agree.Â  It is that order we address on appeal.\r\nIn the meantime, Father appealed to the Florida District Court of Appeals the Florida trial courtâ€™s order changing custody to Mother.Â  The Florida appellate court agreed with Fatherâ€™s argument that the Florida trial court erred in changing custody to Mother because she did not ask for that relief and reversed that portion of the trial courtâ€™s order but affirmed the finding of contempt.Â  The Florida appellate court remanded the case to the trial court for it to â€œfashion a suitable sanction for the contempt.â€ Â \r\nMother then sought to supplement the record on appeal in our court to include the Florida appellate courtâ€™s opinion, prompting the response from Father that he would not contest its inclusion if the decision of the trial court on remand would also be included in the supplement to the record.Â  This court granted the motion to supplement the record with both the appellate courtâ€™s opinion and the circuit courtâ€™s order on remand.Â  \r\nIn the order on remand, the Florida trial court adamantly reasserted its exclusive jurisdiction and ordered Father to continue as primary residential parent with specified unsupervised visitation for Mother over various holidays and school breaks, together with other electronic and telephonic methods of visitation. Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMother appeals the South Carolina family courtâ€™s order denying her custody and mandating supervised visitation â€œas agreeable between the parties.â€Â  Mother argues the South Carolina family court lacked jurisdiction to issue such an order in this custody matter under the PKPA, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A (2000) and the UCCJA, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-782 to -830 (1976).Â  We agree.[2]\r\nThe PKPA and UCCJA â€œgovern the subject matter jurisdiction of state courts to rule in interstate custody disputes. Â Because the PKPA is federal legislation, its provisions will govern any conflict between it and the UCCJA . . . .â€Â \r\nWiddicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75, 86, 620 S.E.2d 333, 339 (Ct. App. 2005) (cert. pending) (internal citations omitted).Â  The PKPA mandates three criteria for a court to retain continuing jurisdiction: Â â€œ1) that the original custody determination was entered consistently with the provisions of the PKPA; 2) that the court maintain jurisdiction under its own state law . . . ; and 3) that the state remains the residence of the child or of any contestant.â€Â  Id.; see also 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(d).\r\nBecause Florida issued the initial custody decree, we apply the PKPA test to determine if it retained continuing jurisdiction over the matter.Â  At the time of the original custody decree, Mother, Father, and the child were all residents of Florida, where the original decree was issued.Â  Accordingly, Florida met the first requirement for retaining jurisdiction because the original decree was consistent with the provisions of the PKPA. Â See \r\nWiddicombe at 86-87, 620 S.E.2d at 339.Â  \r\nThe second requirement is that Florida maintained jurisdiction under its own state law.Â  Florida has enacted the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, which is the successor to the UCCJA.Â  The relevant section provides:\r\n\r\n  1) Â Except as otherwise provided in s. 61.517, a court of this state which has made a child custody determination consistent with s. 61.514 or s. 61.516 has exclusive, continuing jurisdiction over the determination until:\r\n(a) Â A court of this state determines that the child, the childâ€™s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not have a significant connection with this state and that substantial evidence is no longer available in this state concerning the childâ€™s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or\r\n(b) Â A court of this state or a court of another state determines that the child, the childâ€™s parent, and any person acting as a parent do not presently reside in this state.\r\n\r\nFla. Stat. Â§ 61.515 (2002).Â  Clearly, 1(a) does not apply to the current situation because no Florida court has found that the state lacks a significant connection with the parties.Â  To the contrary, the Florida circuit court repeatedly stated that it has exclusive jurisdiction.Â  As to 1(b), Mother continues to reside in Florida.Â  Accordingly, under Florida law, Florida has met the second requirement to establish exclusive, continuing jurisdiction.\r\nThe third criterion, that the state remains the residence of the child or of any contestant, is easily met by Florida as well.Â  Even though the child and Father have moved out of state, Mother has remained a resident of Florida throughout the proceedings.Â  Therefore, Florida meets the third requirement of the PKPA for continuing jurisdiction.\r\nFlorida meets all three requirements mandated by the PKPA for it to have continuing jurisdiction.Â  Accordingly, under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(d), the South Carolina family court did not have jurisdiction over the matter.\r\nAdditionally, the PKPA addresses the specific instance when one stateâ€™s court may modify a custody order issued by another state:\r\n\r\nA court of a State may modify a determination of the custody of the same child made by a court of another State, ifâ€”(1) it has jurisdiction to make such a child custody determination; and (2) the court of the other State no longer has jurisdiction, or it has declined to exercise such jurisdiction to modify such determination.\r\n\r\n28 U.S.C. Â§ 1738A(f)(2000).Â  This section is nearly identical to the pertinent section in South Carolinaâ€™s version of the UCCJA, which provides:\r\n\r\nIf a court of another state has made a custody decree, a court of this State shall not modify that decree unless (1) it appears to the court of this State that the court which rendered the decree does not now have jurisdiction under jurisdictional prerequisites substantially in accordance with this subarticle or has declined to assume jurisdiction to modify the decree and (2) the court of this State has jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-810(a) (1976).Â  As discussed above, Florida retains jurisdiction and, therefore, South Carolina was not in a position to modify the Florida courtâ€™s order relating to the childâ€™s custody.\r\nOne of the main purposes of legislation like the UCCJA is to avoid conflicting custody decrees between states.Â \r\nWiddicombe at 87, 620 S.E.2d at 339; see also  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-784(a)(6)(7) 1976) (other purposes include â€œavoid[ing] relitigation of custody decisions of other states in this State insofar as feasibleâ€ and â€œfacilitat[ing] the enforcement of custody decrees of other statesâ€).\r\nIn considering similar cases, our courts have given great deference to the jurisdiction of the state that originally ruled on a custody matter.Â \r\nWiddicombe at 87, 620 S.E.2d at 339-40.Â  â€œCourts which render a custody decree normally retain continuing jurisdiction\r\nto modify the decree under local law.â€Â  Knoth v. Knoth, 297 S.C. 460, 463, 377 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1989). Â â€œAlthough more than one state may meet these jurisdictional requirements, once a custody decree has been entered, the continuing jurisdiction of the decree state is exclusive.â€Â  Sinclair v. Albrecht, 287 S.C. 20, 23, 336 S.E.2d 485, 487 (Ct. App. 1985). Â A childâ€™s residence in another state is not dispositive of this jurisdictional question.Â  Knoth at 464, 377 S.E.2d at 342-43.Â  If the prior state still has sufficient contact with the case to satisfy the jurisdictional requirements, all petitions for modification must be addressed in that state.Â  Id. at 463, 377 S.E.2d at 342.Â  The courtâ€™s previous consideration of the case is one factor in favor of its continued jurisdiction.Â  Id.Â  When a state attempts to exercise continuing jurisdiction over a custody decree on which it has previously ruled, we interpret the jurisdictional requirements in the UCCJA broadly.Â \r\nWiddicombe at 87, 620 S.E.2d at 340.Â  Because Florida issued the initial custody and properly continued to exercise jurisdiction in the case, South Carolinaâ€™s assumption of jurisdiction was inappropriate under the UCCJA as well.\r\nThe Florida courts have continued to exert continuing jurisdiction throughout the proceedings.Â  Under both the PKPA and the UCCJA, the South Carolina family court improperly assumed jurisdiction.Â  Accordingly, because the South Carolina family court lacked jurisdiction, its order is\r\nVACATED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Because we find the family court did not have jurisdiction over this matter, addressing Motherâ€™s additional argument questioning Fatherâ€™s notice of the Florida circuit court proceedings would be improper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4139","title":"Temple v.

Cameron Halford, of Fort Mill, for Appellants-Respondents.\r\nWilliam Thomas Moody, of York, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Andrew Lytle and Tec-Fab, Inc., appeal a circuit court order awarding treble damages to Richard Temple for the withholding of wages in violation of the Payment of Wages Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10 to -110 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2000, Lytle sold Temple a fifteen percent interest in his business, Tec-Fab, Inc., for $15,000.Â  Lytle also hired Temple to â€œrun the shop and . . . bring in some business.â€Â  They agreed Tec-Fab would pay Temple $5,000 a month for his services. Â Seven months later, Templeâ€™s salary increased to $6,000 a month.Â  In September 2002, Tec-Fab ceased paying Temple his agreed upon monthly salary. [2]   \r\nIn February 2003, Lytle terminated Temple because Tec-Fab lost money and accumulated debt during his employment.Â  At that time, Lytle informed Temple he would receive back pay when Tec-Fab received its accounts from Accutron Technologies, Inc. (Accutron), a customer of Tec-Fab.Â  Shortly thereafter, Accutron issued two checks, which were made jointly payable to Tec-Fab and Temple, for $7,000 and $8,390 respectively.Â  Temple initially accepted personal delivery of these checks because he believed they reduced the amount in wages Tec-Fab owed him.Â  He returned the checks to Accutron, however, after his attorney advised him to do so based on the continuing dispute between Temple and Lytle.Â  Temple then told Accutron to reissue the checks to Tec-Fab only.\r\nTemple sued Lytle and Tec-Fab for withholding his wages in violation of the Payment of Wages Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10 to -110 (Supp. 2005).Â  Lytle and Tec-Fab (collectively â€œTec-Fabâ€) answered and counterclaimed.Â  Tec-Fab claimed Temple committed conversion when he failed to remit the Accutron checks to Tec-Fab.Â  They also claimed Temple kept a Ford truck that belonged to Tec-Fab and $5,114.25 that Atlantic Scrap and Processing, L.L.C. (Atlantic Scrap), another customer of Tec-Fab, owed the company.Â Â  \r\nDuring discovery, Temple had trouble obtaining documents controlled by Tec-Fab.Â  Temple eventually moved the circuit court to compel Tec-Fab to produce the requested documents, which the court granted.Â  Although Tec-Fab produced some of the evidence in question, they waited until two days before trial to produce the bulk of the requested documents.Â  Temple filed a motion in limine alleging an abuse of discovery and seeking sanctions against Tec-Fab.Â  The circuit court granted Templeâ€™s motion and excluded these documents from consideration at trial.Â  \r\nAfter the trial, the circuit court awarded Temple back pay.Â  The court concluded Respondents could not set-off the amount of the Accutron checks or the Ford truck against the amount in wages Tec-Fab owed Temple, because Temple did not keep the Accutron checks and Respondents permitted Temple to keep the Ford truck.Â  However, the court decided Respondents could set-off the $5,114.25 Temple received from Atlantic Scrap against the amount in wages Tec-Fab owed Temple, because Temple should have remitted the $5,114.25 to Respondents.Â  In computing Templeâ€™s final damages, the trial court subtracted the amount Temple received from Atlantic Scrap and then trebled the remainder.Â  \r\nTec-Fab moved the circuit court for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and a new trial.Â  The court issued an amended order (1) reopening the trial to determine how much Temple kept from Atlantic Scrap, unless Temple consented to the $5,114.25 granted by the initial order; (2) holding the amount Tec-Fab owed Temple should be based on Templeâ€™s gross wages of $27,500 rather than his net wages of $18,117.50; (3) interpreting section 41-10-80(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) to require an award of treble damages; and (4) awarding Temple attorneyâ€™s fees and costs of $7,069.50.Â  Tec-Fab appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order awarding Temple treble damages under section 41-10-80(C), arguing the section does not require the trial court to treble damages.Â  Temple also appeals the order, arguing the circuit court erred in trebling damages after offsetting the damages for money owed instead of trebling damages before the offset.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nStatutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 470, 602 S.E.2d 81, 82 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s standard of review extends only to the correction of errors of law.Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep,\r\nL.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In such cases, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed unless they are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an erroneous conception of law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, 342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. The Trebling of Damages\r\nTec-Fab argues the trial court erred in interpreting section 41-10-80(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) to require the trial court to treble damages when an employer violates the Payment of Wages Act.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-10-10 to -110 (1986 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  We agree.Â Â  \r\nThe Payment of Wages Act (â€œThe Actâ€) is remedial legislation designed to protect working people and assist them in collecting compensation wrongfully withheld.Â  Abraham v. Palmetto Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1, 343 S.C. 36, 50, 538 S.E.2d 656, 664 (Ct. App. 2000); Dumas v. Infosafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 194, 463 S.E.2d 641, 645 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  Section 41-10-40(C) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides: â€œ[a]n employer shall not withhold or divert any portion of an employeeâ€™s wages unless the employer is required or permitted to do so by state or federal law . . . .â€Â  The Act requires that â€œ[w]hen an employer separates an employee from the payroll for any reason, the employer shall pay all wages due to the employee within forty-eight hours of the time of separation or the next regular payday which may not exceed thirty days.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-50 (Supp. 2005).Â  The Act further provides:\r\n\r\nIn case of any failure to pay wages due to an employee as required by Section 41-10-40 or 41-10-50 the employee may recover in a civil action an amount equal to three times the full amount of the unpaid wages, plus costs and reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees as the court may allow. Â \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-80(C) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn Rice v. Multimedia, Inc., 318 S.C. 95, 99, 456 S.E.2d 381, 384 (1995), our supreme court interpreted section 41-10-80(C).Â  The supreme court held that â€œby using â€˜may,â€™ rather than â€˜shall,â€™ the legislature has provided that the penalty is discretionary with the judge.â€Â  Id. at 98, 456 S.E.2d at 383.Â  The supreme court reasoned the legislature intended to give the trial court discretion to award treble damages because the â€œimposition of treble damages in those cases where there is a bona fide dispute would be unjust and harsh.â€Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the trial court believed section 41-10-80(C) required it to treble damages.Â  This is an error of law. The trial court may award treble damages in such cases, but nothing in section 41-10-80(C) mandates such.Â  Rice, 318 S.C. at 99, 456 S.E.2d at 384.Â  Furthermore, after a thorough review of the record on appeal, we conclude there was a bona fide dispute over the wages in question.Â  The trial court found Temple withheld over $5,000 in proceeds from company scrap sales to which he was not entitled.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in trebling Templeâ€™s damages and modify Templeâ€™s award to $22,385.75 (Templeâ€™s gross unpaid wages less the $5,114.25 withheld in company proceeds).[3]Â  The trial courtâ€™s decision to treble Templeâ€™s damages is hereby reversed.\r\nII. Fiduciary Duty and Agency Relationship\r\nTec-Fab contends the trial court erred in not finding that an agency relationship continued to exist post-termination wherein Temple had a greater fiduciary duty to deposit the Accutron checks with Tec-Fab rather than returning them to Accutron.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review as Tec-Fab did not raise it in its counterclaims or in its motion for a new trial.Â  See Cowburn v. Leventis, 366 S.C. 20, 40-41, 619 S.E.2d 437, 448-49 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding that when a trial court makes a general ruling on an issue, but does not address the specific argument raised by a party, that party must make a motion asking the trial court to rule on the issue in order to preserve it for appeal.).\r\nIII. Piercing the Corporate Veil\r\nTec-Fab contends the trial court erred in its â€œde facto piercingâ€ of the corporate veil to find Lytle personally liable to Temple.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Act defines employer as â€œevery person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, receiver, or other officer of a court of this State, the State or any political subdivision thereof, and any agent or officer of the above classes employing any person in this State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10 (Supp. 2005).Â  Clearly, as an officer and agent of Tec-Fab with knowledge of the failure to pay Temple, and as the person directly responsible for such non-payment, Lytle falls under the definition of â€œemployerâ€ as contemplated by the statute.Â  The trial court was correct in finding Lytle personally liable for the non-payment of wages.Â  The trial court did not have to reach the issue of piercing the corporate veil to do so.\r\nIV. Motion for a New Trial\r\nTec-Fab argues that the exclusion of evidence and the sanctions conferred constituted an error of law and should result in a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nPursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP, when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the court may â€œmake such orders in regard to the failure as are just,â€ including an order dismissing the action or proceeding, or any part thereof.Â  See In re Anonymous Member of the S.C. Bar, 346 S.C. 177, 194, 552 S.E.2d 10, 18 (2001) (â€œ[j]udges must use their authority to make sure that abusive deposition tactics and other forms of discovery abuse do not succeed in their ultimate goal: achieving success through abuse of the discovery rules rather than by the rule of law.â€).Â  The imposition of sanctions is generally entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Halverson v. Yawn, 328 S.C. 618, 620-21, 493 S.E.2d 883, 884 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nIn the present case, discovery requests were served and, for months, were not answered.Â  The trial court issued an Order Compelling Production, but Tec-Fab still did not provide the documents in question until the day before trial.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in imposing evidentiary sanctions for Tec-Fabâ€™s discovery violations.\r\nFor the reasons stated above, the trial courtâ€™s order is\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART.\r\n KITTREDGE, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Temple alleges Tec-Fab did not pay him for September 2002, October 2002, and February 2003, and only partially paid him for December 2002.\r\n[3] Due to our conclusion that the trial court erred in trebling Templeâ€™s damages, we need not address Templeâ€™s alleged error in trebling the damages after, rather than before, offsetting his awarded damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4140","title":"Haley v.

Connell, Jr. and Robert John Johnston, both of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.\r\nG. Michael Smith, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â Â  This wrongful death action was brought after a bicycle rider ran into the right-rear side panel of a pickup truck.Â  The trial court directed a verdict in favor of the defendant, Gary Curtis Brown, who was the driver of the truck.Â  The plaintiff, the Estate of Joshua M. Haley, by and through its personal representative Cynthia Haley, appeals.Â  The dispositive issue is whether the trial court properly found that, when viewing, as we are required to do,[1] the evidence in the light most favorable to the Estate, the only reasonable conclusion is that the negligence of the bicycle rider, Joshua Haley, outweighed any possible negligence by Brown in light of the sudden emergency in which Brown found himself.Â  We affirm.\r\nAround 6:00 p.m. on August 27, 2001, Joshua, an eight-year-old boy, engaged in play with his brother, Jimmy, and Kyle Sams, both around the same age as Joshua.Â  They were in the parking lot of a vacant bank building in Myrtle Beach located at the corner of Fifth Avenue South and Highway 17.Â  The boys were jumping their bikes over a speed bump located a few feet from the edge of the street at Fifth Avenue South and landing their bikes in or near the street.Â  \r\nA driveway shielded with â€œextremely tallâ€ shrubbery provided access from the parking lot to the street.Â  Brown was driving down Fifth Avenue South when James and Kyle, riding their bicycles, exited the driveway from behind the bushes and entered Fifth Avenue South.Â  Brown immediately swerved his pickup truck to the left to avoid hitting them.Â  Brown turned back to the right to return to his proper lane, but he swerved to the left again when he saw Joshua suddenly appear from the driveway as Joshua jumped over the speed bump.Â  Despite Brownâ€™s efforts, Joshua slammed his bicycle into the side of Brownâ€™s truck just above the tire.Â  The impact threw Joshua into the street.Â  He died the next day.Â  At the time Joshua struck Brownâ€™s vehicle, Joshua was going an estimated 10 to 15 miles per hour.Â  Brown was traveling at or about 25 miles per hour, the posted speed limit.Â  Also, at or near the time of impact, there was a sound of screeching tires; there is no evidence of any other vehicles besides Brownâ€™s in the vicinity.Â  Approximately two to five seconds elapsed from the time Brown avoided the first two boys and Joshua rode his bicycle into the side of Brownâ€™s pickup truck.Â  Â Â \r\nThe only lay witness present at the time of the collision who testified at trial was Kyle, one of the first two riders to dart out as Brown drove down the street.Â  According to Kyleâ€™s uncontradicted testimony, Kyle had just jumped over the speed bump, landed in the street, and gotten onto the sidewalk when he heard screeching tires and then a crash.Â  Kyle turned around to see Joshua, who had been following right behind him, lying in the street.Â  According to Kyle, the accident â€œhappened real quick.â€Â  Kyle acknowledged he was well aware of the need to look both ways before entering a street and agreed the boys had â€œmade a mistake.â€[2]Â  \r\nAt trial, an expert witness for the Estate opined as follows: Brown would have traveled between 70 to 90 feet toward the boys once they exited the driveway and entered his field of vision; Brown had between 0.25 seconds and 2.0 seconds, the average human reaction time, to perceive the peril created by the first two children entering the street, make a decision about what evasive action he should take, and execute the evasive maneuver; at a hypothetical speed of 30 miles per hour, Brown would have traveled 44 feet per second, thus traversing his visibility field in approximately 2.0 seconds; from the time Joshuaâ€™s bicycle would have became visible and impacted Brownâ€™s truck, 2.0 seconds would have elapsed, assuming Joshua was traveling 10 miles per hour; and Brown had approximately 2.0 seconds of reaction time to avoid colliding with Joshua.Â  Â Â \r\nBrown moved for a directed verdict on the issue of liability.Â  The trial court granted Brownâ€™s motion, but apparently inadvertently referred to it as summary judgment.Â  The court stated â€œthere is no reasonable evidence to suggest to the jury that any negligence on the part of the Plaintiff could possibly be exceeded by the -- any perceived negligence on the part of the Defendant . . . .â€Â  \r\nIn our view, the trial court properly directed a verdict in this case.Â  The only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the evidence is that Joshuaâ€™s negligence in running into the side of Brownâ€™s truck outweighed any possible negligence by Brown and was the more determinative factor in causing the collision. [3]\r\nAt the time of this accident, Brown was driving in his proper lane and at the posted speed limit.Â  Moreover, there is no evidence of any impairment or recklessness on his part.Â  Brown was confronted with an emergency situation caused solely by the first two boys wrongfully darting out of the bank parking lot into the path of his truck.Â  He quickly made a decision to swerve to the left to avoid hitting the two boys.Â  By choosing to swerve, Brown made a choice a person of ordinary prudence placed in the same emergency situation might also make at that moment.[4]Â  In fact, Brown did not hit any of the three children that day; unfortunately, one of them, Joshua, struck him.Â  Even the Estateâ€™s expert witness conceded a reasonable person might also swerve his or her car to the left to avoid an accident when faced with a sudden emergency and such a maneuver would often be the quicker response.Â  As to this case, he further conceded[5] a collision likely would have occurred even with braking.[6]  \r\nThis situation is similar to that in Hopson v. Clary,[7] a case in which the plaintiff, Hopson, was driving down the street, pulled over, and attempted to make a U-turn when she was struck by the defendant, Clary, who was traveling behind her.[8]Â  We upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision granting a directed verdict to Clary, finding that, even assuming Clary was guilty of some negligent act, Hopsonâ€™s own negligence in attempting â€œan inherently precarious maneuver without ascertaining whether she could do so safelyâ€ was, as a matter of law, greater than any negligence attributable to Clary and the more determinative factor in causing the accident.[9]\r\nLikewise, in Bloom v. Ravoira,[10] our supreme court held that where a pedestrian was struck by a motorist as he attempted to cross a street, the only reasonable inference was that his own negligence was more than fifty percent, thus precluding his recovery in a negligence action against the motorist.[11]Â  The pedestrian â€œentered the street quickly [in the middle of the block from between two parked cars] and without any warning to drivers.â€[12]Â  The pedestrian stated he looked left and then right and then entered the street without looking to the left again.[13]Â  He did not see the motorist.[14]Â  The motorist was driving no more than 25 miles per hour and was not driving recklessly.[15]Â  \r\nThe supreme court held the pedestrian was not entitled to recover on his negligence action, stating:Â  â€œHere, the undisputed facts establish that [the pedestrian] attempted to cross the street but did not do so in a safe, reasonable manner.Â  Any factual issues that might exist as to [the motoristâ€™s] fault in this accident cannot alter the inescapable conclusion that, as a matter of law, [the pedestrianâ€™s] fault exceeded fifty percent.Â  Where evidence of the plaintiffâ€™s greater negligence is overwhelming, evidence of slight negligence on the part of the defendant is simply not enough for a case to go to the jury.â€[16]Â  \r\nOf particular interest is the decision of the Court of Appeals of Georgia, Neal v. Miller,[17] wherein it considered a scenario similar to the current appeal.Â  There, the court affirmed a directed verdict in favor of a defendant motorist whose car was struck on the side by the plaintiff, a nine-year-old bicycle rider who â€œshot out of [a steep] drivewayâ€ that was hidden from view by trees.[18]Â  \r\nThen there is Dorsey v. Buchanan,[19] in which the Court of Appeals of North Carolina found, in a situation involving the collision of a minor bicyclist and a truck driver, that the â€œmost compelling circumstance is that [the bicyclist] collided with the truck, not vice versa . . . .â€[20]Â  The court, in upholding the grant of a directed verdict to the truck driver, observed that â€œthe mere occurrence of a collision between a motor vehicle and a minor on the street does not of itself establish the driverâ€™s negligence . . . .â€[21]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn this instance, the only allegation of negligence is that Brown should have swerved and braked; but the evidence shows Brown did swerve and applied his brakes.Â  Moreover, even if we assume he just swerved, we still find that is a reasonable response to the hazard presented and his conduct would not, in any event, constitute the greater negligence.Â  Again, Brown was struck by Joshua, not vice versa, and Brown did make, under any view of the evidence, at least a reasonable attempt to avoid a collision.Â  Although we, like the trial court, are sympathetic to the loss that was incurred in this case, we feel compelled to uphold its ruling where the only reasonable conclusion is any possible negligence by Brown could not be deemed greater than fifty percent.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.Â  ANDERSON, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J. (dissenting in a separate opinion):Â  I disagree with the reasoning and analysis of the majority.Â  I VOTE to REVERSE and REMAND.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn August 27, 2001, Joshua Haley, an eight-year-old boy, his twin brother Jimmy Haley, and their friend, Kyle Sams, who was eight-years-old, were riding their bicycles in a vacant bank parking lot at Fifth Avenue South in Myrtle Beach.Â  The parking lot driveway, which was flanked by â€œextremely tallâ€ shrubbery, was approximately 100 to 120 feet from United States Highway 17 Business (Kings Highway). \r\nKyle and Jimmy jumped a speed bump, which is â€œa couple of feet from the roadway,â€ and â€œwent across the other side.â€Â  When Kyle and Jimmy exited the driveway, they ended up on Fifth Avenue South.Â  At approximately the same time the boys were riding their bicycles in the vacant bank parking lot, Brown, driving a 2001 Chevrolet dually truck, was driving east on Fifth Avenue South. \r\nKyle stated that Joshua followed on his bicycle â€œright after [Kyle] got across the sidewalk.â€Â  When Kyle and Jimmy â€œcame out, . . . [Brown] swerved, at some time, to the left, and then he came back to the right, and then he swerved back again to the left, andâ€”when Josh came out.â€Â  According to Kyle, â€œ[m]e and Jimmy looked both ways, and Josh, I guess he didnâ€™t, because I was already over there, and then I just heard tires screeching, and a crash.â€Â  A collision occurred between Joshua and Brown.Â  Approximately two to five seconds passed from the time Brown saw Kyle and Jimmy until the accident with Joshua occurred.Â  Joshua hit the right rear fender area of Brownâ€™s truck.Â  Joshua was thrown from his bicycle into the middle of the street.\r\nKyle rode to a nearby putt-putt course and asked them to call the police.Â  He then rode his bicycle home to advise his mother, Terry Blackmon Sams, about the accident.Â  Kyle asked her to return to the scene of the accident with him.Â  Kyle informed his mother that he, Joshua and Jimmy â€œwere jumping the speed bump, going across Fifth Avenue . . . [a]nd him and Jimmy had got across, and [Josh] was the one that was behind, and he said that he tried to tell [Josh] to stop, but [Josh] couldnâ€™t.â€\r\nWhen the paramedics arrived at about 6:08 p.m., they found Joshua lying in the street with extensive injuries.Â  The paramedics transported Joshua to Grand Strand Regional Medical Center.Â  Joshua died of his injuries at the Medical University of South Carolina the next day.Â  According to the Deputy Coroner of Horry County, the cause of death was â€œ[t]raumatic brain injury.â€\r\nJoshuaâ€™s mother, Cynthia Haley, personal representative of the estate, filed this action alleging wrongful death.Â  Brown filed an answer generally denying the allegations in the complaint and raising the defenses of sole negligence of Joshua, unavoidable accident, sudden emergency, and comparative negligence of Joshua.\r\nDuring the trial, Haley presented the testimony of an expert witness, Robert K. Taylor; one of the boys, Kyle Coleman Sams; Haleyâ€™s mother, Cynthia Haley; Kyleâ€™s mother, Terry Blackmon Sams; an investigating officer, Michael J. Marsh; two EMS employees, Everette Kinsley Elmore, III and Bryan T. McGarrahan; one of the responding police officers, Carol Ann Allen; and J. Dan Bellamy, Sr., Deputy Coroner.Â  Haleyâ€™s attorney published two separate Requests for Admissions:\r\n\r\nThese Requests for Admissions, as the Court has already explained, are going to be given to you, but I want to read those to you before Mr. [Robert] Taylor testifies.Â  The first one is dated May 24th, 2004, and itâ€™s a Request for Admission from Mr. Brown to us, and it reads as follows: â€œAs you were traveling on 5th Avenue South you saw two young boys from a driveway to your right, and cross your lane of travel in front of you?â€Â  And the response is: â€œAdmitted, but boys crossed the roadway very quickly.â€\r\nRequest for Admit Number 2 is dated January 4th, 2005, . . . and it says, â€œAs you were traveling on 5th Avenue South you saw two young boys coming from a driveway to your right, and cross your lane of travel in front of you?â€ And the response by Mr. Brown and his lawyer [is]: â€œAdmitted, however, at least one of the boys made a hard left turn in front of the Defendant, and rode his bicycle along the right side of his automobile.Â  Due to that maneuver, the Defendant instinctively turned his wheel to the left to avoid colliding with that child.Â  The Defendant is unaware, at this time, of the path of the second child.â€\r\n\r\nAt the close of Haleyâ€™s case, Brown moved for a directed verdict on the issue of liability, claiming (1) Haleyâ€™s expert held Brown to a standard not recognized in South Carolina; (2) the only evidence is that Brown was faced with a sudden emergency situation and, as a matter of law, Haleyâ€™s claim must fail; (3) the only reasonable inference is that the court must direct a verdict for Brown because â€œthere was absolutely no negligence on the part of Mr. Brownâ€; and (4) if Brown was negligent, his negligence was outweighed by Joshuaâ€™s negligence.Â  In opposition to Brownâ€™s motion, Haley argued: (1) the cases cited by Brown were decided before the doctrine of comparative negligence was adopted; (2) the doctrine of last clear chance applied and it was a jury question; (3) all of the testimony presented by Haley at trial indicated Brown should have anticipated this accident and should have stopped; (4) because this case dealt with children, there was a different standard of care which required this case be submitted to the jury; and (5) there was sufficient evidence of negligence on Brownâ€™s part to submit the case to the jury.\r\nThe circuit judge declared: â€œThe only thing in this case that keeps the Defendant in was how he reacted in the sudden emergency. Any negligence that could possibly be attributed to him would have had to be attributed to him as to how he reacted to that emergency.â€Â  The judge determined:\r\n\r\nAny evidence that theâ€”that in the two seconds, while the Defendant was successfully avoiding the only two children he saw, that he should have consciously become aware that children were in play in the area, so as to raise his duty of care and take appropriate steps to avoid hitting any other children that may later come out of the parking lot is not, in this Courtâ€™s judgment, reasonable, [t]hat requiringâ€”that would require to go to the jury when, in fact, the Defendant did avoid hitting the second child.Â  The second childâ€”or the third child, unfortunately, hit the Defendant.\r\n\r\nThe judge ruled:\r\n\r\nThe loss of a child is an unspeakable tragedy, but in this case there is no reasonable evidence to suggest to the jury that any negligence on the part of the Plaintiff could possibly be exceeded by theâ€”any perceived negligence on the part of the Defendant, inasmuch as the sudden emergency doctrine only requires a reasonable effort to avoid an accident.Â  In this case even the expert said he took a reasonable effort to avoid the accident.\r\n\r\nThe judge explained: â€œI think that is a matter of law, that . . . any reasonable testimony of negligence should go to the jury, and I think that it would be unreasonable to allow them to pass on a question of fact that this Court is susceptible of only one inference, and that is that that was not unreasonable.â€Â  The judge further concluded: â€œOur Supreme Court has said many times that itâ€™s a rare situation, indeed, that summary judgment should be granted in a negligence action, however, in this Courtâ€™s view, this is one of those rare cases.â€\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit judgeâ€™s use of the terminology summary judgment is erroneous.Â  The procedural posture of the case was beyond the purview and ambit of a summary judgment analysis.Â  The ruling of the circuit judge will be analyzed and reviewed as a directed verdict motion.\r\nRule 50(a), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\n(a) Motion for Directed Verdict: When Made: Effect.Â  When upon a trial the case presents only questions of law the judge may direct a verdict.Â  A party who moves for a directed verdict at the close of the evidence offered by an opponent may offer evidence in the event that the motion is not granted, without having reserved the right so to do and to the same extent as if the motion had not been made.Â  A motion for a directed verdict which is not granted is not a waiver of trial by jury even though all parties to the action have moved for directed verdicts.Â  A motion for a directed verdict shall state the specific grounds therefor.Â  The order of the court granting a motion for a directed verdict is effective without any assent of the jury.\r\n\r\nNote 2 to Rule 50 states: â€œThe motion for directed verdict may be made at the close of plaintiffâ€™s evidence, as well as at the close of all the evidence.Â  This is an alternative to the present motion for involuntary dismissal (non-suit) which is also available.â€\r\nIn ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court must view the evidence and the inferences which reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motion.Â  Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 629 S.E.2d 653 (2006); Proctor v. Department of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 368 S.C. 279, 628 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2006); The Huffines Co., LLC v.

Norris &amp; Assocs., Ltd., 342 S.C. 561, 538 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  This court is not concerned with the weight of the evidence, but whether there is any evidence from which the jury is warranted in making a finding.Â  Washington v. Whitaker, 317 S.C. 108, 451 S.E.2d 894 (1994).\r\nA motion for directed verdict goes to the entire case and may be granted only when the evidence raised no issue for the jury as to liability.Â  Carolina Home Builders, Inc. v. Armstrong Furnace Co., 259 S.C. 346, 191 S.E.2d 774 (1972); Huffines, 365 S.C. at 187, 617 S.E.2d at 129.Â  When the evidence yields only one inference, a directed verdict in favor of the moving party is proper.Â  Huffines, 365 S.C. at 187, 617 S.E.2d at 129; Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 541 S.E.2d 857 (Ct. App. 2001).Â Â  The trial court must deny the motion when either the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt. Â Law v.

Poole, 351 S.C. 1, 567 S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The issue must be submitted to the jury whenever there is material evidence tending to establish the issue in the mind of a reasonable juror.Â  Huffines, 365 S.C. at 188, 617 S.E.2d at 129-30.Â  The appellate court must determine whether a verdict for a party opposing the motion would be reasonably possible under the facts as liberally construed in his favor.Â  Erickson, 368 S.C. at __, 629 S.E.2d at 663; Harvey v. Strickland, 350 S.C. 303, 566 S.E.2d 529 (2002); Proctor, 368 S.C. at 293, 628 S.E.2d at 503; see also Huffines, 365 S.C. at 188-89, 617 S.E.2d at 130 (â€œEssentially, our Court must resolve whether it would be reasonably conceivable to have a verdict for a party opposing the motion under the facts as liberally construed in the opposing partyâ€™s favor.â€).Â  A directed verdict is warranted when the case presents only questions of law and should be allowed only if the evidence would not be legally sufficient to sustain a verdict for the opposite party.Â  McEntire v. Mooregard Exterminating Servs., Inc., 353 S.C. 629, 578 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIf the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.Â  Erickson, 368 S.C. at __, 629 S.E.2d at 663; see also Unlimited Servs., Inc. v.

Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997); Proctor, 368 S.C. at 292-93, 628 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nWhen this court reviews a trial courtâ€™s grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict, we reverse only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is governed by an error of law.Â  Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 615 S.E.2d 440 (2005); Huffines, 365 S.C. at 188, 617 S.E.2d at 130; see also Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 536 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 2000) (noting appellate court will reverse trial court only when there is no evidence to support ruling below).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Standard of Care for Minors\r\nHaley maintains the circuit judge should have considered Joshuaâ€™s standard of care and denied the directed verdict motion.\r\nIn Standard v. Shine, 278 S.C. 337, 295 S.E.2d 786 (1982), our supreme court enunciated the standard of care involving minors:\r\n\r\nHeretofore, we have held, by analogy to the criminal law, that a child under seven years of age was conclusively presumed to be incapable of contributory negligence; a rebuttable presumption existed that a child between the ages of seven and fourteen was incapable of contributory negligence; and a child of fourteen years and over was presumed capable of contributory negligence. Â Chitwood v. Chitwood, 159 S.C. 109, 156 S.E. 179 (1930); King v. Holliday, [116 S.C. 463, 108 S.E. 186 (1921)].Â  However, we have never addressed the primary negligence of minors, the issue before us today.Â  Despite our previous holdings, the prevailing view in cases of both primary and contributory negligence of minors is that no arbitrary limits as to a minimum age should be set.Â  The capacities of children vary greatly, not only with age, but also with individuals of the same age.Â  Therefore, no very definite statement can be made as to just what standard is to be applied to them.Â  Â§ 32 Prosser on Torts (4th Ed.).Â  Of course, a child of tender years is not required to conform to an adult standard of care.Â  The Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 283A suggests that a minorâ€™s conduct should be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.\r\nToday we adopt that standard of care for minors in both primary and contributory negligence cases.Â  Insofar as todayâ€™s decision differs from our previous cases dealing with the contributory negligence of minors, those cases are overruled.\r\n\r\nStandard, 278 S.C. at 338-39, 295 S.E.2d at 787.Â  In McCormick v. Campbell, 285 S.C. 272, 329 S.E.2d 752 (1985), the court again addressed the issue:\r\n\r\nIn Standard v. Shine, 278 S.C. 337, 295 S.E.2d 786 (1982), we abrogated the arbitrary age presumptions in determining a minorâ€™s negligence or contributory negligence holding the behavior of minors under the age of fourteen should be judged by the conduct expected of a minor of like age under like circumstances.\r\n\r\nMcCormick, 285 S.C. at 273, 329 S.E.2d at 752; see also Inman v. Thompson, 297 S.C. 221, 223, 375 S.E.2d 358, 359 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œOur Supreme Court in Standard v. Shine adopted the Restatementâ€™s view that â€˜a minorâ€™s conduct should be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.â€™â€).\r\nThis court, in Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997), suggested the following charge in regard to minors under the age of fourteen:\r\n\r\nA child under the age of fourteen years is not required to conform to an adult standard of care.Â  A minorâ€™s conduct should be judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.Â  A child may be so young as to be manifestly and utterly incapable of exercising any of those qualities of attention, perception, knowledge, experience, intelligence, and judgment which are necessary to enable the child to perceive a risk and to realize its unreasonable character.Â  On the other hand, it is obvious that a minor who has not yet attained majority may be quite as capable as an adult of exercising such qualities.\r\n\r\nBrown, 325 S.C. at 556, 481 S.E.2d at 450.\r\nSubsequently, in Jones ex rel. Castor v. Carter, 336 S.C. 110, 518 S.E.2d 619 (Ct. App. 1999), this court instructed:\r\n\r\nUnder the holding in Standard, what specific behavior is legally expected of a minor under fourteen becomes a question of fact decided on the circumstances of each case.Â  Even though one child of a given age may be completely incapable of acting in accordance with a given adult standard of care, another child of the same age may have sufficient maturity and knowledge such that a jury could reasonably expect that child to act as an adult should under the same circumstances.Â  See Brown, 325 S.C. at 556, 481 S.E.2d at 449.Â  Thus, in the wake of Standard, where there is evidence that a minor should be expected to exhibit a certain level of care, Herring [v. Boyd, 245 S.C. 284, 140 S.E.2d 246 (1965)] can no longer operate to prevent a jury, in determining the childâ€™s negligence or comparative negligence, from considering the childâ€™s failure to exercise that level of care. Â A child under fourteen therefore may be, but is not necessarily, negligent for failure to obey an adult standard of care.\r\n\r\nJones, 336 S.C. at 117-18, 518 S.E.2d at 622-23 (footnote omitted).\r\nII.Â  Expert Witness\r\nAt trial, Haley presented Robert K. Taylor, an engineer, as an expert witness.Â  The court qualified Taylor as an expert in the fields of accident reconstruction and human factors.Â  Brown did not object.\r\nA plethora of South Carolina cases allow testimony by experts in accident reconstruction and experts in human factors.Â  See, e.g., Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000) (circuit judge allowed testimony of accident reconstruction expert); Oliver v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Hwys. &amp; Pub. Transp., 309 S.C. 313, 422 S.E.2d 128 (1992) (allowing testimony of accident reconstructionist); Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 593 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2004) (admitting testimony of human factors analyst and accident reconstructionist); South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilson, 344 S.C. 525, 544 S.E.2d 848 (Ct. App. 2001) (trial judge allowed Robert Taylor, a mechanical engineer and accident reconstructionist, to testify); Gazes v. Dillardâ€™s Depâ€™t Store, Inc., 341 S.C. 507, 534 S.E.2d 306 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding sufficient factual basis existed to support accident reconstruction expertâ€™s opinion); Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 462 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1995) (circuit judge allowed testimony by expert qualified in fields of human factors and psychology).\r\nAfter analyzing the evidence, Taylor offered the following opinions: (1) Brown was negligent; (2) Brown had â€œample warning . . . that there were children playing in the areaâ€; (3) two young boys â€œcame out of the parking lot and into the streetâ€ and caused Brown to swerve; (4) Brown â€œdid not . . . recognize the hazard and the responsibility that there are children playing hereâ€; (5) Brown â€œdid not react to the possibility of, there are children playing here and I need to take the appropriate action, which is, drastically slow down quickly, so that if there are any other children they donâ€™t run the risk of an accident, or a severe accidentâ€; (6) Brown â€œdid not use that caution that you should be using when you are alerted to the fact that there are children playing there right at you in the streetâ€; (7) Brown was driving â€œabout twenty-five miles an hour, plus or minus some,â€ at the time Haley â€œpulled outâ€; (8) Haley â€œwas not going especially fastâ€ on his bicycle, but was within â€œa range of ten to fifteen miles an hour for the bicycleâ€; (9) â€œthe road is wider where this accident occurred than where it is when you go back toward the campgroundâ€; (10) when Brown â€œsaw the first two bicyclists, he was in the range of approximately ninety feet from where he would end up impacting with [Haley], so . . . in the range of approximately ninety feet before the point of . . . impact, was where he would have first had visibility of the two boysâ€; (11) â€œif you go and calculate Mr. Brownâ€™s likely speed at the point of impact, it would be higher, taking into consideration that [Haley] is forced down the road by the truck, by the impact, than it would be if he just went straight to the pavement at the point of impactâ€; (12) Brownâ€™s responses to the Requests for Admission were â€œinconsistentâ€ which â€œindicates a lack of recall of what really happenedâ€; (13) Brown â€œdid not do substantial braking when he was alerted to the children playingâ€”riding bicycles into the streetâ€; (14) â€œstopping was something that could have been done, or coming very close, down to two or three or five miles an hour, to make sure everything was clearâ€; (15) Brown could see about five hundred feet down Fifth Avenue South into the parking lot where Haley was; (16) Brown could clearly see back up Fifth Avenue South; (17) regarding the area where the children were playing, â€œ[t]here was an unobstructed view of the part near the street, and then back on the side in the parking lot beside the bankâ€; (18) â€œ[t]here is a special situation when children are playing in or near the road, particularly if they are activeâ€; (19) â€œswerving and braking becomes very important when there is a reasonable possibility of other childrenâ€; and (20) Brown had â€œa long shot of a perspective into th[e] parking lot area where the boys had been.â€\r\nHere, the circuit judge qualified the expert but erroneously ignored his opinions.\r\nIII.Â  Doctrine of Last Clear Chance\r\nHaley alleges the doctrine of last clear chance mandates reversal of this case and its submission to a jury.\r\nUnder the doctrine of last clear chance, a plaintiff who negligently subjects himself to a risk of harm may recover when the defendant discovers or could have discovered the plaintiffâ€™s peril had he exercised due diligence, and thereafter fails to exercise reasonable care to avoid injuring the plaintiff.Â  Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d 366 (1991); Jones v. Atlanta-Charlotte Air Line Ry. Co., 218 S.C. 537, 63 S.E.2d 476 (1951).\r\nHistorically, South Carolina treated the doctrine of last clear chance as separate and distinct from contributory negligence on the theory that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence has become remote such that the defendantâ€™s negligence is the sole proximate cause of an injury.Â  See, e.g., Smith v. Blackwell, 250 S.C. 170, 156 S.E.2d 867 (1967); Hubbard and Felix, Comparative Negligence in South Carolina: Implementing Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 43 S.C. L. Rev. 273 (1992).Â  However, in Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998), our supreme court declared: â€œ[The doctrine of] last clear chance has been subsumed by adoption of comparative negligence such that it remains a factor for the juryâ€™s consideration in comparing the partiesâ€™ fault, but that it does not totally relieve a plaintiff of his or her negligence.â€Â  Id. at 173, 499 S.E.2d at 208.Â  The Spahn court addressed â€œwhether the elements of the doctrine are to be charged to the jury in weighing the partiesâ€™ fault in a comparative negligence case.â€Â  Id. at 174, 499 S.E.2d at 208.Â  The court set forth the following jury charge and found it was appropriate in the context of a comparative negligence case:\r\n\r\nIn determining the relative percentages of negligence for the plaintiff and the defendant, you should consider, as a factor relevant to the defendantâ€™s share of negligence, whether the plaintiff was in peril and unable to extricate himself from the peril.Â  If the plaintiff was in peril, you should also consider whether the defendant was aware of that peril and if he was, whether the defendant could have then avoided the injury to the plaintiff if the defendant had used due care at that point.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nBecause of the expertâ€™s testimony, the doctrine of last clear chance should have been submitted as a factor for the juryâ€™s consideration.\r\nIV.Â  Sudden Emergency Doctrine\r\nHaley contends the circuit judge erred in holding the sudden emergency doctrine barred his claim.Â  Haley argues that, like the doctrine of last clear chance, the sudden emergency doctrine is a factor to be considered by the jury in comparative negligence cases.\r\nOur supreme court discussed the sudden emergency doctrine in Elrod v. All, 243 S.C. 425, 134 S.E.2d 410 (1964):\r\n\r\nIn determining whether or not the operator of an automobile was justified in turning out to the left, the usual rules applicable to acts in emergencies generally apply. When the driver of an automobile is confronted with a sudden peril brought about by the negligence of another, he is not held to the exercise of the same degree of care as when he has time for reflection.Â  If he has used due care to avoid meeting such an emergency, and after it arises he exercises such care as a reasonably prudent driver would use under the attendant circumstances, he is not negligent.Â  In Porter v. Cook, 196 S.C. 433, 13 S.E.2d 486, 488 [(1941)], the Court said: â€œIt is settled by a great body of decisions that an automobile driver, who, by the negligence of another and not by his own negligence, is suddenly placed in an emergency and compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision or an injury, is not guilty of negligence\r\nif he makes such a choice as a person of ordinary prudence placed in such a position might make, even though he did not make the wisest choice.â€\r\n\r\nElrod, 243 S.C. at 437-38, 134 S.E.2d at 417.Â  The Elrod court further determined: â€œOrdinarily, the question of sudden emergency is for the jury, but if the proof shows no actionable negligence on the part of the appellant, it is the duty of the Court to so declare as a matter of law.â€Â  Id.; see also Green v. Sparks, 232 S.C. 414, 102 S.E.2d 435 (1958) (noting it was for the jury to determine whether in the sudden emergency which confronted the plaintiff, he exercised ordinary care and judgment in his actions); Alston v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co., 308 S.C. 292, 297, 417 S.E.2d 631, 634 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œThe question of whether a sudden emergency existed is normally a question for the jury, but becomes a question for the court where the facts show no actionable negligence on the part of the defendant.â€).\r\nIn Poulos v. James, 254 S.C. 156, 174 S.E.2d 152 (1970), the supreme court noted: â€œAn emergency has been defined as a sudden or unexpected event or combination of circumstances which calls for immediate action.â€Â  Id. at 159, 174 S.E.2d at 154 (quotations omitted).\r\nWhen the driver of an automobile is confronted with a sudden emergency brought about by the negligence of another and not by his own negligence, and is compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision or an injury, that driver is not guilty of negligence if he makes such a choice as a person of ordinary prudence placed in a like position might make, even though he did not make the wisest choice.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000); McVey v. Whittington, 248 S.C. 447, 151 S.E.2d 92 (1966); Benchoff v. Morgan, 302 S.C. 116, 394 S.E.2d 19 (Ct. App. 1990); see also Still v. Blake, 255 S.C. 95, 177 S.E.2d 469 (1970) (concluding sudden emergency doctrine properly was charged to jury where plaintiff veered left to avoid colliding with defendantâ€™s vehicle, which had signaled to turn right but unexpectedly turned left); Alston, 308 S.C. at 297, 417 S.E.2d at 634 (emphasizing that, where a motorist is suddenly placed in an emergency situation, through no fault of his own, and is compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision, he is not negligent if he makes a choice that a person of ordinary judgment might make if placed in the same emergency situation); accord Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 326 S.C. 632, 486 S.E.2d 507 (Ct. App. 1997) (finding sudden emergency doctrine properly was charged to jury where police officerâ€™s vehicle injured plaintiff as plaintiff was trying to retrieve his boat from middle of road), affâ€™d as modified, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d 205 (1998); Singletary v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Educ., 316 S.C. 153, 447 S.E.2d 231 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating it was a jury question on whether defendant school bus driver acted prudently under sudden emergency doctrine when driver failed to pull off foggy highway after bus stalled, and was struck from rear by plaintiffâ€™s vehicle).Â  In order for the doctrine of sudden emergency to apply, it must be shown that: (1) the person was confronted with an emergency, or with what appeared to be an emergency; (2) the emergency was not caused or contributed to by the person; and (3) in meeting the emergency, the person acted as a person of reasonable prudence would or might have acted under the same or similar circumstances.\r\nThe sudden emergency doctrine is intended to protect a driver who, while acting with due care, suddenly finds himself in an emergency situation due to the negligent or wrongful acts of another.Â  Clark, 339 S.C. at 392, 529 S.E.2d at 540. Â The doctrine does not apply when a partyâ€™s own negligence creates the very emergency in which he finds himself.Â  Id.\r\nPersons who have to act in the face of sudden emergency are not to be judged in the light of later events but are to be judged under all the circumstances which surround them at the time by the standard of what a person of ordinary prudence would have been likely to do under the same conditions.Â  Watson v. Aiken, 243 S.C. 368, 133 S.E.2d 833 (1963); Porter v. Cook, 196 S.C. 433, 13 S.E.2d 486 (1941).\r\nSudden emergency is not a defense in and of itself.Â  Brooks v. Brooks, 288 S.C. 71, 339 S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  It is simply a part of the overall law of negligence and is charged to the jury in a proper case to assist the jury in applying the principles of negligence.Â  Wiggins v. Thomas, 264 S.C. 360, 215 S.E.2d 426 (1975); Brooks, 288 S.C. at 73, 339 S.E.2d at 532.\r\nWith the adoption of comparative negligence, the sudden emergency doctrine is now only a factor in the total fault analysis.Â  The Supreme Court of Kentucky, in Regenstreif v. Phelps, 142 S.W.3d 1 (Ky. 2004), analyzed whether the sudden emergency doctrine had been subsumed by comparative negligence:\r\n\r\nThe sudden emergency qualification was not subsumed by the comparative negligence doctrine.Â  In comparative negligence, the plaintiffâ€™s damages are reduced in proportion to his or her fault.Â  A partyâ€™s fault is determined by evaluating his or her conduct in consideration of the duties he or she is bound to observe.Â  â€œ[T]he sudden emergency doctrine is merely an expression of the reasonably prudent person standard of care. It expresses the notion that the law requires no more from an actor than is reasonable to expect in the event of an emergency.â€&nbsp; In other words, in the comparative negligence case, â€œ[t]he sudden emergency instruction informs the jury . . . how it is to allocate fault and apportion damages when the conduct of the person in question is that of an â€˜ordinarily prudent personâ€™ when faced with an emergency situation.â€Â \r\nâ€œSignificantly, the doctrine explains to the jury the standard of conduct expected of defendants and plaintiffs who act under the stress of an emergency situation.â€\r\nWith the adoption of comparative negligence, the sudden emergency doctrine is now only a factor in the total fault analysis. . . .\r\nThe core principle of comparative negligence is that â€œ[o]ne is liable for an amount equal to his degree of fault, no more and no less.â€\r\nThe sudden emergency doctrine necessarily complements this principle in those particular cases where additional circumstances alter the way in which oneâ€™s degree of fault should be determined. We find no friction between comparative negligence and the sudden emergency doctrine . . . .\r\n\r\nRegenstreif, 142 S.W.3d at 5-6 (footnotes omitted).Â  Unlike the Regenstreif court, the Court of Appeals of Tennessee, in Ross v. Vanderbilt Univ. Med. Ctr., 27 S.W.3d 523 (Tenn. Ct. App. 2000), found the sudden emergency doctrine was subsumed into Tennesseeâ€™s comparative fault scheme.Â  The Ross court inculcated:\r\n\r\nThe main issue in this case is brought about by the ongoing effort of our courts to resolve certain pre-McIntyre doctrines in accord with a system of comparative fault.Â  Specifically at issue is the sudden emergency doctrine which has been addressed by the supreme court on two occasions since the adoption of comparative fault.Â  First, in Eaton v. McClain, 891 S.W.2d 587 (Tenn. 1994), the court took the opportunity to provide trial courts with some guidance as to how to apportion fault between parties.Â  In so doing, the court stated, as dicta, that â€œ[t]he policy considerations underlying . . . the doctrine of contributory negligence . . . have been implicitly subsumed by our decision in McIntyre and should also impact the juryâ€™s apportionment of fault between the parties in an appropriate case.â€Â  Id. at 592.Â  The court proceeded to say that â€œ[i]n summary, the percentage of fault assigned to each party should be\r\ndependent upon all the circumstances of the case, including such factors as: . . . the existence of a sudden emergency requiring a hasty decision.â€Â  Id. Again, in McCall v. Wilder, 913 S.W.2d 150 (Tenn. 1995), the sudden emergency doctrine was addressed and was, this time, actually at issue in a case involving an automobile accident.Â  The defendant, the administrator of the decedentâ€™s estate, alleged that the accident was an unavoidable consequence of a sudden emergency created when the decedent suffered a seizure while driving.Â  The court of appeals had upheld the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment reasoning â€œthat the case fell within the â€˜established principles in this state that an automobile accident resulting from an unavoidable sudden emergency, such as an epileptic seizure, negates negligence.â€™â€Â  Id. at 152.Â  The supreme court vacated the award of summary judgment holding that â€œ[t]he doctrine no longer constitutes a defense as a matter of law but, if at issue, must be considered as a factor in the total comparative fault analysis. Accordingly, the doctrine of sudden emergency does not negate defendantâ€™s liability in the case before us as a matter of law.â€Â  Id. at 157.Â  In so holding, the court quoted Eaton stating that â€œ[t]he sudden emergency doctrine . . . has now been subsumed into Tennesseeâ€™s comparative fault scheme.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).\r\n. . . .\r\nAs articulated in Eaton and McCall, the adoption of a comparative fault scheme modifies the way that the sudden emergency doctrine operates as applied to both plaintiffs and defendants seeking to rely on the doctrine.Â  Specifically with regard to plaintiffs, the doctrine is no longer needed as an exception to contributory negligence to ameliorate the plaintiffâ€™s claim.Â  Rather, the circumstances taken into account by this doctrine are now some of many considerations to be addressed when assessing relative degrees of fault.Â  Eaton, 891 S.W.2d at 592.\r\n\r\n As for defendants, prior to McIntyre, the sudden emergency doctrine constituted a defense as a matter of law if properly established by the defendant.Â  McCall, 913 S.W.2d at 157 (â€œ[t]he doctrine no longer constitutes a defense as a matter of lawâ€). Now, it is only a factor in the total fault analysis.Â  Id.Â  This is true in a comparative fault analysis when both parties are allegedly at fault. It is likewise true when the analysis is only of the defendantâ€™s fault because, as in the case at bar, there has been no allegation that the plaintiff was at fault.\r\n\r\nRoss, 27 S.W.3d at 527-28; see also Eaton v. McLain, 891 S.W.2d 587 (Tenn. 1994) (stating the sudden emergency doctrine has been implicitly subsumed and should impact the juryâ€™s apportionment of fault between the parties in an appropriate case).Â  Similarly, the Court of Appeal of Louisiana, in Jefferson v. Soileau, 864 So. 2d 250 (La. Ct. App. 2003), explicated:\r\n\r\nThe City-Parish also claims that the â€œsudden emergencyâ€ instruction was inappropriate under the facts of this case because the â€œsudden emergencyâ€ doctrine was subsumed in comparative fault.Â  However, the First Circuit recently stated in Duzon v. Stallworth, 01-1187 (La. App. 1 Cir. 12/11/02), 866 So. 2d 837, writs denied, 03-0589, 03-0605 (La. 5/2/03), 842 So. 2d 1101, 1110, that even though the â€œsudden emergencyâ€ doctrine was developed when contributory negligence was a complete bar to recovery, we continue to apply the doctrine today.\r\n\r\nJefferson , 864 So. 2d at 253.\r\nThe analysis and ruling in regard to the doctrine of last clear chance by the Spahn court is instructive and edifying as we examine the viability of the doctrine of sudden emergency as juxtaposed to the doctrine of comparative negligence.Â  Concomitantly, I hold that the doctrine of sudden emergency has been subsumed by adoption of comparative negligence such that it remains a factor for the juryâ€™s consideration in comparing the partiesâ€™ fault, but that it does NOT totally relieve a party of his or her negligence.\r\nThe circuit judge erred in finding the sudden emergency doctrine precluded this case from being submitted to the jury. \r\nV.Â  Comparative Negligence\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina adopted the doctrine of comparative negligence in Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991):\r\n\r\nHaving determined comparative negligence is the more equitable doctrine, we now join the vast majority of our sister jurisdictions and adopt it as the law of South Carolina to the extent set forth below.Â  For an exhaustive analytical discussion of the history and merits of comparative negligence, we refer the bench and bar to the opinion of Chief Judge Sanders in Langley v. Boyter, 284 S.C. 162, 325 S.E.2d 550 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nFor all causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1991, a plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages if his or her negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  The amount of the plaintiffâ€™s recovery shall be reduced in proportion to the amount of his or her negligence.Â  If there is more than one defendant, the plaintiffâ€™s negligence shall be compared to the combined negligence of all defendants.Â  See Elder v. Orluck, 511 Pa. 402, 515 A.2d 517 (1986).\r\n\r\nNelson, 303 S.C. at 244-45, 399 S.E.2d at 784 (footnote omitted).Â  This Court further discussed the doctrine in Ott v. Pittman, 320 S.C. 72, 463 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995):\r\n\r\nIf a plaintiff was negligent as a matter of law, and that negligence proximately caused the injury complained of, under the doctrine of contributory negligence, the plaintiff was automatically barred from recovery.Â  Under the doctrine of comparative negligence, negligence by the plaintiff does not automatically bar recovery by the plaintiff unless his negligence is greater than that of the defendant.\r\n\r\nOtt, 320 S.C. at 80, 463 S.E.2d at 106; see also Hopson v. Clary, 321 S.C. 312, 468 S.E.2d 305 (Ct. App. 1996) (stating plaintiffâ€™s claim was barred under comparative negligence doctrine because plaintiffâ€™s own negligence was, as a matter of law, greater than any negligence attributable to defendant and the more determinative factor in causing the accident).Â  Comparative negligence is an affirmative defense in South Carolina.Â  Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 532 S.E.2d 612 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nUnder the comparative negligence doctrine, a plaintiff may only recover damages if his own negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 611 S.E.2d 488 (2005); Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, 529 S.E.2d 710 (2000); Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 357 S.C. 545, 593 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Generally, under a less than or equal to comparative negligence rule, determination of respective degrees of negligence attributable to the plaintiff and the defendant presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn.Â  Trivelas, 357 S.C. at 549-50, 593 S.E.2d at 506; Brown v. Smalls, 325 S.C. 547, 481 S.E.2d 444 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Hurd, 363 S.C. at 429, 611 S.E.2d at 492 (noting determination of respective degrees of negligence attributable to plaintiff and defendant presents a question of fact for the jury, at least where conflicting inferences may be drawn); Thomasko v. Poole, 349 S.C. 7, 11, 561 S.E.2d 597, 599 (2002) (â€œBecause the term is relative and dependant on the facts of a particular case, comparing the negligence of two parties is ordinarily a question of fact for the jury.â€); Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997) (holding comparison of plaintiffâ€™s negligence with that of defendant is question of fact for jury to decide).Â  â€œAccordingly, apportionment of negligence, which determines both whether a plaintiff is barred from recovery or can recover some of his damages and the proportion of damages to which he is entitled, is usually a function of the jury.â€Â  Brown, 325 S.C. at 559, 481 S.E.2d at 451.\r\nIn a comparative negligence case, the trial court should grant a motion for directed verdict if the sole reasonable inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the non-moving partyâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.Â  Hurd, 363 S.C. at 429, 611 S.E.2d at 492; Thomasko, 349 S.C. at 11, 561 S.E.2d at 599; Bloom, 339 S.C. at 422, 529 S.E.2d at 713; see also Trivelas, 357 S.C. at 549-50, 593 S.E.2d at 506 (â€œIn a comparative negligence case, the trial court should only determine judgment as a matter of law if the sole reasonable inference which may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.â€).Â  â€œFor these reasons, this Court is reticent to endorse directed verdicts in cases involving comparative negligence.â€Â  Thomasko, 349 S.C. at 11, 561 S.E.2d at 599.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nI hold the trial judge erred in granting a directed verdict in Brownâ€™s favor.Â  The evidence is susceptible to more than one inference.Â  An analysis of the evidentiary record reveals paradigmatically the existence of factual issues which must be resolved by the trial jury.Â  Accordingly, I VOTE to REVERSE the judgeâ€™s order granting Brownâ€™s directed verdict motion and REMAND the case.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See, e.g., Hurd v. Williamsburg County, 363 S.C. 421, 426, 611 S.E.2d 488, 491 (2005) (â€œWhen reviewing a ruling on a motion for directed verdict, we must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€).\r\n[2]Â  In South Carolina, the conduct of a minor is judged by the standard of behavior to be expected of a child of like age, intelligence, and experience under like circumstances.Â  Standard v. Shine, 278 S.C. 337, 339, 295 S.E.2d 786, 787 (1982).Â  The undisputed evidence was that Joshua and the other children knew of the need to look before entering a street.Â  Kyleâ€™s mother testified her son had known â€œfor some timeâ€ of the need to look both ways before entering a street, he had been trained in this for his own safety, and she had the impression he understood this for several years prior to the accident.Â  Likewise, Joshuaâ€™s mother conceded her sons, including Joshua, â€œknew the rules of the roadâ€ and â€œ[t]hey knew not to go in the road.â€Â Â Â  Â \r\n[3]Â  Under comparative negligence, the plaintiff in a negligence action may recover damages only when his or her negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.Â  Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 245 &amp; n.1, 399 S.E.2d 783, 784 &amp; n.1 (1991) (finding the plaintiff, who ran into the back of a tractor-trailer, was not entitled to recover damages because there was no negligence on the part of the truck driver as a matter of law).Â  The trial court should grant a motion for a directed verdict in a comparative negligence case when â€œthe only reasonable inference that may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent.â€Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t,&nbsp; 328 S.C. 24, 33, 491 S.E.2d 571, 575&nbsp;(1997); cf. Lydia v. Horton, 355 S.C. 36, 40, 583 S.E.2d 750, 752-53 (2003) (noting if the evidence supports only one conclusion, the comparative fault of the plaintiff and the defendant becomes a question of law for the trial judge; the court held, in a negligent entrustment action, the plaintiffâ€™s admission that he was intoxicated and lost control of a borrowed vehicle exceeded the ownerâ€™s alleged negligence in loaning him the vehicle as a matter of law).\r\n[4] Â The sudden emergency doctrine does not bar a plaintiffâ€™s claim as a matter of law, but it is relevant in determining whether there is any reasonable inference that the defendantâ€™s alleged negligence outweighed that of the plaintiff.Â  See Wiggins v. Thomas, 264 S.C. 360, 365, 215 S.E.2d 426, 428 (1975) (stating the doctrine of sudden emergency is a part of the overall law of negligence); Watson v. Aiken, 243 S.C. 368, 373, 133 S.E.2d 833, 836 (1963) (observing when a person faces a sudden emergency, he is not to be judged in light of later events, but rather, is to be judged in light of all the surrounding circumstances, by the standard of what a person of ordinary prudence likely would have done under the same conditions); Singletary v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Educ., 316 S.C. 153, 157, 447 S.E.2d 231, 233 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œWhere a motorist is suddenly placed in an emergency situation, through no fault of his own, and is compelled to act instantly to avoid a collision, he is not negligent if he makes a choice that a person of ordinary judgment might make if placed in the same emergency situation.â€); Alston v. Blue Ridge Transfer Co.,&nbsp;308 S.C. 292, 297-98, 417 S.E.2d 631, 634&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1992) (noting the question of whether a sudden emergency existed, normally a question for the jury, can be a question for the court if the facts show no actionable negligence on the part of the defendant; the court found, as a matter of law, that the defendant made every reasonable effort to avoid a collision by attempting to brake and pull off the road when faced with the plaintiffâ€™s vehicle crossing the center line and that the allegedly excessive speed of the defendant was not the proximate cause of the accident).Â  \r\n[5]Â  The Estateâ€™s expert witness had suggested that Brown was negligent in failing to apply his brakes rather than swerving to his left, but the expert witness agreed a collision would have occurred between the truck and Joshuaâ€™s bicycle â€œeven if [Brown had] hit the brakes.â€ Â Furthermore, the evidence of screeching brakes just before Joshua crashed into Brownâ€™s truck and the lack of evidence of any other vehicles in the vicinity suggests Brown applied his brakes in an emergency fashion at the time of the collision.Â  \r\n[6] Â To the extent the Estate argues the doctrine of last clear chance precludes a directed verdict in this case, we find the doctrine, like sudden emergency, is simply one factor to be considered in determining the overall negligence of the parties.Â  Although we agree comparative negligence normally presents a jury question, where, after consideration of all the relevant factors, the only reasonable inference is that the plaintiffâ€™s negligence exceeded fifty percent, it becomes a matter of law for the trial court.Â  See Spahn v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4141\r\nSubmitted June 1, 2006 â€“ Filed July 31, 2006\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChristopher L. Murphy and Â James A. Stuckey, Jr., both of Charleston, for Appellant.\r\nRonald Deâ€™Ray Skipper, of Bishopville, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  The South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC) appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order finding Ronald Deâ€™Ray Skipper was denied both a liberty interest in prison employment and due process with regard to SCDCâ€™s drug-testing policy.Â  SCDC contends there is no liberty interest in prison employment and that Skipper was afforded due process prior to his disciplinary conviction for drug possession.Â  We reverse.[1]Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nSkipper, an inmate at Evans Correctional Institution,[2] was employed at the facility through SCDC and the privately run Prison Industries Enterprises.Â  Â Prison Industries is a voluntary program which serves the SCDC by employing and training inmates. Â Inmates choosing to participate in the program receive the prevailing wage of the local area for the particular job they perform with deductions taken for taxes, victim compensation, and room and board. \r\nOn January 18, 2001, Skipper was randomly selected for testing under the SCDC drug-testing policy, and he tested positive for marijuana.Â  On January 31, 2001, Skipper was re-tested and his urine was again positive for marijuana.Â  Immediately following this test, a follow-up test was performed and it confirmed the positive result. \r\nOn February 7, 2001, a disciplinary hearing was held before prison officials, and Skipper was found guilty of possession of marijuana.Â  This disciplinary conviction resulted in Skipper losing fifteen days of canteen privileges.Â  Additionally, as per Prison Industriesâ€™ policy, Skipper was terminated from his job because of this disciplinary conviction. Â On September 21, 2001, Skipper was transferred from Evans Correctional Institution to Lee Correctional Institution, a facility which does not utilize the Prison Industries program.Â  \r\nSkipper appealed his disciplinary conviction through a two-step inmate grievance procedure.Â  His appeal was reviewed and denied by the institutional grievance coordinator and the warden.Â  After exhausting his inmate grievance appeals, Skipper appealed to the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD).Â  The ALJ dismissed Skipperâ€™s appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on the ground the SCDC â€œdid not infringe a liberty interest when it punished Skipper with canteen restrictions for violating a prison disciplinary rule.â€Â  \r\nSkipper then appealed to the circuit court, and the court remanded the matter back to the ALJD to consider whether the possible effect of the challenged disciplinary conviction on Skipperâ€™s parole chances implicated a protected liberty interest.Â  The ALJ again dismissed the appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction stating â€œthe mere possibility of an effect on parole eligibility is too tenuous to constitute a deprivation of a liberty interest.â€Â  The ALJ further found â€œno liberty interest is implicated when an inmate is faced with lesser penalties such as the loss of television, canteen, or telephone privileges.â€ \r\nSkipper again appealed to the circuit court, and the court ruled in his favor.Â  The court found as a matter of law that Skipperâ€™s loss of employment implicated a liberty interest, and SCDCâ€™s refusal to send Skipperâ€™s urine for further testing interfered with his right to due process.Â  SCDC appeals.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Mootness\r\nIn its brief, SCDC asserts the circuit court erred in finding:Â  (1) SCDCâ€™s refusal to provide Skipper with Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) confirmation of his drug test result interfered with Skipperâ€™s right to due process in his disciplinary conviction; and (2) Skipper had a liberty interest in prison employment which potentially afforded a basis for a claim under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  \r\nAlthough we will address these arguments, we find it necessary as a threshold matter to analyze whether the issue regarding Skipperâ€™s prison employment is moot.\r\nIn its May 23, 2003 order, the circuit court, in finding violations of a liberty interest and due process rights, stated only that Skipper was entitled to â€œsome relief.â€Â  SCDC filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment and included a request that, in the alternative, the circuit court clarify what relief should be awarded to Skipper. Â In response, the circuit court issued a Form 4 order denying the motion.Â  The court failed to address the issue of specific relief. Â \r\nDuring the course of his appeal, Skipper was transferred to the Lee Correctional Institution, a facility which does not provide the privilege of employment with Prison Industries Enterprises.Â  Given the authority to determine an inmateâ€™s location rests with SCDC, this court may not order his return to Evans Correctional Facility or to another correctional facility which offers Skipperâ€™s desired employment. Â Consequently, as will be discussed, we find any issue regarding potential employment relief for Skipper is moot. \r\nGenerally, this court does not have the authority to dictate to the SCDC where an inmate should be housed. Â In South Carolina, the authority to determine where an inmate is housed is vested in the Department of Corrections.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-30(A) (Supp. 2005) (â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of law, a person convicted of an offense against the State must be in the custody of the Department of Corrections, and the department shall designate the place of confinement where the sentence must be served.â€); see also S.C. Const. art. XII, Â§ 2 (â€œThe General Assembly shall establish institutions for the confinement of all persons convicted of such crimes as may be designated by law, and shall provide for the custody, maintenance, health, welfare, education, and rehabilitation of the inmates.â€).\r\nAbsent an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate, or an arbitrary, capricious, or biased decision by the prison, the court has no authority to interfere with inmate housing decisions.Â  See Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 486 (1995)(holding that thirty days of solitary confinement when compared with inmateâ€™s overall prison environment, was not the â€œtype of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interestâ€); Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 381, 527 S.E.2d 742, 756 (2000) (finding judicial review of inmate disputes is limited to â€œdetermine whether â€˜the challenged conditions or degree of confinement are within the sentence imposed and are not otherwise violative of the Constitution,â€™ or whether prison officials have acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or from personal biasâ€ (quoting Brown v. Evatt, 322 S.C. 189, 194, 470 S.E.2d 848, 851 (1996))); Crowe v. Leeke, 273 S.C. 763, 764, 259 S.E.2d 614, 615 (1979) (holding transfer within prison system or downgrading of custody status is not subject to judicial review as long as prison officials do not act arbitrarily, capriciously, or from personal bias or prejudice).\r\nBecause Skipper has not specifically challenged his transfer to the Lee Correctional Institution and our authority with respect to internal inmate decisions is limited, we are placed in a position of not being able to grant effectual relief.Â  Given we are unable to grant this relief, we find the issue is moot. See Collins Music Co. v. IGT, 365 S.C. 544, 549, 619 S.E.2d 1, 3 (Ct. App. 2005)(noting a matter becomes moot when some event occurs making it impossible to grant effectual relief). \r\nII.Â  Liberty Interest in Prison Employment and Due Process\r\nSCDC argues the circuit court erred in finding that Skipper had a liberty interest in prison employment which potentially afforded him a basis for a claim under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.Â  We agree.\r\nEven though this court is without authority to grant Skipper relief in terms of ordering a transfer to a facility offering the Prison Industries program, we address the merits of this issue in the interest of thoroughness given Skipperâ€™s liberty interest argument may be broadly construed as also including a challenge to his transfer to a facility that does not offer the employment program.\r\nâ€œ[A]dministrative matters entitled to review by the ALJD â€˜typically arise in two ways:Â  (1) when an inmate is disciplined and punishment is imposed and (2) when an inmate believes prison officials have erroneously calculated his sentence, sentence-related credits, or custody status.â€™â€Â  Sullivan v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corr., 355 S.C. 437, 441, 586 S.E.2d 124, 126 (2003) (quoting Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 369, 527 S.E.2d 742, 750 (2000)).Â  We also recognize that a condition of confinement could implicate a state-created liberty interest, thus requiring minimal due process.Â  See Sullivan, 355 S.C. at 442, 586 S.E.2d at 126 (â€œ[S]tates may create liberty interests which are protected by the Due Process Clause, but . . .Â  â€˜these interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which . . . imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.â€™â€ (quoting Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472, 484 (1995))). \r\nâ€œCourts traditionally have adopted a â€˜hands offâ€™ doctrine regarding judicial involvement in prison disciplinary procedures and other internal prison matters, although they must intercede when infringements complained of by an inmate reach constitutional dimensions.â€Â  Al-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 382, 527 S.E.2d at 757. In other words, an inmateâ€™s complaint must encompass an infringement of a liberty interest that imposes an atypical and significant hardship on the inmate to trigger due process guarantees and judicial review.\r\nThe Prison Industries program, like a work release program, is statutorily created.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(A) (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe Director of the Department of Corrections may establish a program involving the use of inmate labor . . . in private industry for the manufacturing and processing of goods, wares, or merchandise or the provision of services or another business or commercial enterprise considered by the director to enhance the general welfare of South Carolina.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-20 (Supp. 2005) (outlining guidelines for inmates recommended for work release).Â  Both have the general purpose of providing inmate employment during incarceration as a means of rehabilitation.Â  Because the work release program is similar to the Prison Industries program, we find instructive precedent analyzing the work release program.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has decided that â€œ[t]he Board of Corrections has discretion whether to allow an inmate even to participate in a work release program.â€Â  Gunter v. State, 298 S.C. 113, 116, 378 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1989), overruled in part on other grounds by Griffin v. State, 315 S.C. 285, 433 S.E.2d 862 (1993). â€œParticipation in a work-release program is a privilege, not a right. Â Thus, the denial of participation in a work-release program, standing alone, affords no basis for a claim under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983.â€Â  Quillian v. Evatt, 315 S.C. 489, 491, 445 S.E.2d 639, 640 (Ct. App. 1994) (citation omitted). \r\nIn an analogous situation, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has stated:Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nIt is well settled that federal courts do not occupy â€œthe role of super wardens of state penal institutions,â€ and â€œdo not sit to supervise state prisons.â€Â  In\r\nparticular, the classifications and work assignments of prisoners in such institutions are matters of prison administration, within the discretion of the prison administrators, and do not require fact-finding hearings as a prerequisite for the exercise of such discretion.Â  To hold that they are â€œwithin reach of the procedural protections of the Due Process Clause would place the Clause astride the day-to-day functioning of state prisons and involve the judiciary in issues and discretionary decisions that are not the business of federal judges.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAltizer v. Paderick, 569 F.2d 812, 812-13 (4th Cir. 1978) (citations omitted).\r\nMore recently, the United States Supreme Court took the opportunity to clarify the law with respect to state-created liberty interests in prison systems that are protected by the Due Process Clause.Â  Sandin v. Conner, 515 U.S. 472 (1995).Â  The Court noted that â€œthese interests will be generally limited to freedom from restraint which, while not exceeding the sentence in such an unexpected manner as to give rise to protection by the Due Process Clause of its own force, nonetheless imposes atypical and significant hardship on the inmate in relation to the ordinary incidents of prison life.â€Â  Id. at 484 (citations omitted).Â  In ruling on Connerâ€™s case, the Court established directives for future cases.Â  Specifically, the Court held that â€œConnerâ€™s discipline in segregated confinement did not present the type of atypical, significant deprivation in which a State might conceivably create a liberty interest.â€Â  Id. at 486.\r\nApplying the above-outlined principles, we find Skipperâ€™s participation in the Prison Industries program is not a right, but a privilege. Â Not all prisons provide this opportunity to their inmates, and those that do provide this option are inundated with inmate requests and forced to maintain long waiting lists.Â  This employment program does not meet the test for a state-created liberty interest as outlined in Sandin because it does not present an atypical, significant hardship on inmates who are not permitted to participate.Â  Consequently, Skipper, in being terminated from his prison employment, did not suffer an infringement upon his liberty interests.3Â  Moreover, it is not a requirement of the due process and equal protection clauses of either the State or the United States Constitutions that if the State undertakes to provide rehabilitative facilities, it must provide such facilities to all prisoners or to none.Â  See McLamore v. State, 257 S.C. 413, 424, 186 S.E.2d 250, 256 (1972) (finding that inmate was not denied constitutional rights under the Due Process or Equal Protection clauses of the State and United States Constitutions where certain educational and rehabilitative services available to some inmates at the SCDC were not available to him).4\r\nWe are cognizant that our holding on this issue may initially appear to be in conflict with our supreme courtâ€™s decision in Wicker v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 360 S.C. 421, 602 S.E.2d 56 (2004).Â  We believe, however, that the two cases are distinguishable.Â  Like Skipper, Wicker participated in the Prison Industries Program at the Evans Correctional Institute.Â  During the first 320 hours of his employment, Wicker was paid $.25-.75 per hour.Â  After completing his training, Wicker was paid an hourly wage of $5.25 per hour.Â  Due to this wage disparity, Wicker filed an inmate grievance in which he asserted his training wages violated the Prevailing Wage Statute outlined in section 24-3-430(D).Â  This section specifically provides that â€œ[n]o inmate participating in the program may earn less than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private sector.â€Â  Id. at 423, 602 S.E.2d at 57.Â  After the Department of Corrections (DOC) denied Wickerâ€™s grievance, Wicker appealed to the ALJ.Â  The ALJ ruled in favor of Wicker, finding there was no statutory authority for the DOC to pay less than the prevailing wage.Â  Id.Â  The circuit court affirmed the ALJ.Â  On appeal, the DOC contended Wicker was not entitled to relief under the applicable statute.Â  The supreme court affirmed the decision of the circuit court.Â  In so holding, the court found that â€œthe stateâ€™s statutory mandate that inmates be paid the prevailing wageâ€ created a liberty interest which may not be denied without due process.Â  Id. at 424-25, 602 S.E.2d at 58.Â  Accordingly, the court held Wicker could not be denied this right without being afforded due process of law.Â  Id. at 424, 602 S.E.2d at 57.\r\nThe instant case is distinguishable from Wicker given there is no statutory requirement that all correctional facilities employ the Prison Industries Program or that an inmate participate.Â  In fact, the statute which creates the program specifically provides the establishment of the program is discretionary and that an inmateâ€™s participation in the program is voluntary.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(A) (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe Director of the Department of Corrections may establish a program involving the use of inmate labor . . . in private industry.â€)(emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(C) (Supp. 2005) (â€œAn inmate may participate in the program established pursuant to this section only on a voluntary basis and only after he has been informed of the conditions of his employment.â€)(emphasis added); see also Kennedy v. South Carolina Ret. Sys., 345 S.C. 339, 352-53, 549 S.E.2d 243, 250 (2001) (â€œThe use of the word â€˜mayâ€™ signifies permission and generally means that the action spoken of is optional or discretionary unless it appears to require that it be given any other meaning in the present statute.â€).Â  Because there is no statutorily-created right for an inmate to participate in the program or remain in the program indefinitely, we find in Skipperâ€™s case, unlike Wickerâ€™s, there does not exist a state-created liberty interest.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Drug Test\r\nSCDC further contends the circuit court erred in finding its refusal to provide Skipper with a Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS) test to confirm the result of his failed drug test interfered with Skipperâ€™s right to due process.Â  We agree.\r\nIn establishing the minimal requirements of due process in a prison disciplinary proceeding involving serious misconduct, our supreme court has relied on precedent from the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-72 (1974).Â  In Al-Shabazz, our supreme court outlined the requirements as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) that advance written notice of the charge be given to the inmate at least twenty-four hours before the hearing; (2) that factfinders must prepare a written statement of the evidence relied on and reasons for the disciplinary action; (3) that the inmate should be allowed to call witnesses and present documentary evidence, provided there is no undue hazard to institutional safety or correctional goals; (4) that counsel substitute (a fellow inmate or a prison employee) should be allowed to help illiterate inmates or in complex cases an inmate cannot handle alone; and (5) that the persons hearing the matter, who may be prison officials or employees, must be impartial. \r\n\r\nAl-Shabazz, 338 S.C. at 371, 527 S.E.2d at 751 (citing Wolff v. McDonnell, 418 U.S. 539, 563-72 (1974)).\r\nHere, there has been no allegation that these requirements were not satisfied by the SCDC procedure.Â  The argument posed by Skipper and accepted by the circuit court is that SCDCâ€™s failure to send Skipperâ€™s urine samples for further testing deprived him of due process.Â  We fail to see how the due process requirements delineated in Al-Shabazz could be construed in this fashion, and we find that SCDC complied with the procedural due process requirements in this matter. \r\nMoreover, SCDC developed drug-testing procedures which were followed for Skipperâ€™s testing.Â  Contrary to Skipperâ€™s assertions, it was not the policy of SCDC to send all â€œfirst-time positiveâ€ test results for GC/MS testing to confirm the results.Â  Rather, SCDC randomly sent a minimal number of tests to be confirmed by GC/MS testing in order to insure the accuracy of their â€œtest stripâ€ testing.Â  Furthermore, we disagree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that to deny Skipperâ€™s request â€œupon Skipperâ€™s offer to pay for same [GC/MS testing] interferes with Skipperâ€™s right to due process in his disciplinary conviction.â€Â  Due process in prison drug testing does not require that a prisoner be afforded duplicative testing, nor does it require utilizing a testing method chosen by the prisoner.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause Skipper has, during the course of his appeal, been transferred to a facility which does not provide his desired employment, we do not believe this court can grant any effectual relief. Â Nevertheless, in the interest of thoroughness, we address the merits of the appeal.Â  We hold the circuit court erred in finding as a matter of law that Skipperâ€™s dismissal from prison employment infringed upon a liberty interest and in finding SCDCâ€™s drug testing of Skipper violated his due process rights.Â  Based on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order and find the ALJ should have dismissed Skipperâ€™s appeal given his grievance did not implicate a state-created liberty interest.5\r\n REVERSED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â Â  Skipper is serving a sentence of twenty years to life for murder and several counts of assault of a high and aggravated nature.\r\n[3]Â Â  We note that Skipper has not challenged the circuit courtâ€™s findings that the disciplinary action will not affect his parole eligibility or that the loss of canteen privileges does not infringe on a liberty interest.\r\n[4]Â Â Â  Additionally, we note that Skipper was employed in a state that recognizes the doctrine of employment at-will.Â  See Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 334, 516 S.E.2d 923, 925 (1999) (noting that South Carolina recognizes the doctrine of employment at-will).Â  Because Skipperâ€™s employment did not fit within any of the established exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine, his employment was terminable at any time by Prison Industries.Â  Thus, it would be incongruous to find Skipper had a state-created liberty interest in his employment.Â  See id. (â€œAt-will employment is generally terminable by either party at any time, for any reason or for no reason at all.â€); Nelson v. Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n, 362 S.C. 1, 6, 605 S.E.2d 744, 746 (Ct. App. 2004) (outlining the following established exceptions to the at-will employment doctrine:Â  (1) an employee has recourse against his employer for termination in violation of public policy; (2) an at-will employee may not be terminated for exercising constitutional rights; and (3) an employee has a cause of action against an employer who contractually alters the at-will relationship and terminates the employee in violation of the contract). \r\n[5]Â Â  We believe the ALJ improperly dismissed Skipperâ€™s appeal on the ground that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  In light of our decision that Skipperâ€™s grievance did not implicate a state-created liberty interest, we find the ALJ had jurisdiction to dismiss the appeal on the merits.Â  See Slezak v.

Carroll Rushing brought suit against Larry A. McKinney, Ivan Block, Jeffrey J. Weiss, and Pentaura Ltd., Inc. (collectively Respondents) asserting breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of good faith and fair dealing, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel, and equitable estoppel arising out of the operation of Pentaura.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court entered a verdict in favor of Respondents, and Rushing appeals.[1]Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPentaura was a business incorporated on October 16, 1995, by McKinney, Block, and Weiss to design, sell, and market high-end contemporary furniture.Â  McKinney, Block, and Weiss were the only shareholders, with McKinney and Block contributing most of the initial capital and Weiss acting as a manager.Â  Additional funding was obtained for Pentaura in the form of $500,000 in notes payable to Branch Banking and Trust (BB&amp;T) and personally guaranteed by the three shareholders.Â  \r\nAt some point in 1996, Block approached Rushing to invest in Blockâ€™s separate paint coatings business.Â  Although Rushing was not interested in the paint coatings business, he learned more about Pentaura from Weiss and decided to invest in the company.Â  At that time, Pentauraâ€™s balance sheet reflected $500,000 in notes payable to BB&amp;T, $372,309.29 in inventory, a negative total equity, and showed Pentaura was operating at a loss.Â  \r\nOn April 23, 1997, Rushing wrote a letter to McKinney and Block indicating the terms under which Rushing would invest in Pentaura.Â  Rushing agreed to make a capital contribution of $350,000 to Pentaura, making him a thirty-two percent owner of the total outstanding capital, provided that:Â  Rushing and Richard Grant, Rushingâ€™s personal accountant, would become officers of the corporation; Rushing would assume all financial responsibility and control; and Block would take responsibility for the manufacturing process.Â  An adjusted balance sheet attached to the April letter indicated $150,000 would be deducted from the equity of McKinney and Block to account for Rushingâ€™s portion of the BB&amp;T notes.Â  Respondents indicated they agreed with the proposal by signing and returning the letter to Rushing.Â  From that point on, Rushing and Grant ran Pentaura, with Grant making payments on Pentauraâ€™s note with BB&amp;T from January 1998 until June 2000.Â  \r\nAfter Rushing became a shareholder, he learned Pentauraâ€™s inventory was $277,781 less than he initially believed.Â  Thus, Pentauraâ€™s need for additional funds was greater.Â  He proposed the other shareholders either contribute more to Pentaura or reduce their percentage ownership in the corporation.Â  McKinney and Block both decided to reduce their percentage interest in Pentaura, making Rushing a forty-eight percent shareholder.Â Â Â  \r\nThe underlying controversy centers on what occurred at a meeting between Rushing, Grant, McKinney, Block and Weiss on February 3, 1998 (the February Meeting).Â  Grant prepared an agenda with financial information for this meeting, but no one took minutes.Â  According to Rushing, he informed the other shareholders that he would give additional funds to Pentaura if Respondents would agree to be personally responsible for the loans.Â  Rushing testified Respondents did not reply in any way, which led him to believe they had an agreement.Â  On February 20, 1998, Rushing sent a letter (the February Letter) to McKinney, Block, and Weiss â€œto confirm the agreementâ€ they reached at the February Meeting.Â  Among other topics, the February Letter detailed Pentauraâ€™s then-current cash needs and requested a capital contribution of $115,720 from Block, $88,560 from McKinney, and $39,000 from Weiss.Â  McKinney had already submitted his share by the time the letter was written.Â  Nothing in the February Letter confirmed an agreement by the parties for the Respondents to be personally liable for the loans made to Pentaura.Â  \r\nOn March 2, 1998, Grant wrote a memorandum to Rushing indicating Block was having serious financial problems.Â  Block confirmed this memorandum with a letter to Rushing on April 3, 1998.Â  Block never paid the requested capital contribution from the February Meeting.Â  \r\nRushing advanced money to Pentaura from Janauary 1, 1998, to September 24, 2001.Â  Rushing evidenced the advances by a series of one hundred and sixty-six demand notes prepared and executed by Grant on behalf of Pentaura.Â  In December of 2001, a schedule of the loans indicated the total outstanding principal and interest were $4,381,747.38 and $895,950.95, respectively.Â  Each note is payable to Rushing and draws interest at a rate of ten percent.[2]Â  No writing evidences any person or entity (other than Pentaura) as being liable for repayment of these loans.Â  \r\nPentaura continued to operate at a net loss.Â  On August 18, 1999, Rushing wrote to McKinney, Block, and Weiss indicating he had provided cash funding to Pentaura and had made payments on the BB&amp;T notes.Â  Attached to this letter is an accounting that details the advances made by Rushing to Pentaura and the pro rata share of these loans for each shareholder.Â  The allocation shows McKinney owed $637,941 and Block owed $856,702.Â  Rushing received no response to this letter. Â Pentaura continued to make payments on the BB&amp;T notes until June 7, 2000.Â  Grant finally wrote McKinney and Block on August 7, 2000, indicating Rushing had made payments on the BB&amp;T notes.Â  These letters allege that McKinney and Block â€œwere given credit for these notes in determining equity percentages of ownershipâ€ between the shareholders when Rushing made his initial contribution.Â  Grant asked that McKinney and Block reimburse Pentaura for these payments.Â Â  \r\nPentaura operated at a net loss of $1,043,276.62 during the year 2000.Â  In September 2000, Rushing informed his banker, Barry Maness, that he was going to approach Respondents to determine if they wanted to â€œretain their ownership interest by putting in their prorata [sic] share of the $3,000,000 which [Rushing] has invested in the company and matching it going forward or by simply getting out by paying off the debt that existed prior to [Rushingâ€™s] entry in to the business which is to BB&amp;T.â€Â  (Maness Memo)Â  On December 19, 2000, Rushing wrote McKinney, Block, and Weiss indicating he was â€œnot prepared to extend further credit to you and Pentaura.â€Â  Nevertheless, Rushing continued to put money into Pentaura as evidenced by more notes.Â  \r\nOn June 28, 2001, Rushing again wrote to McKinney, Block, and Weiss and stated: â€œI agreed to provide capital in the form of a loan to fund the investments each partner has made.Â  We now need to settle up the pro rata share of this loan as we need to finalize a plan to continue to invest, close the operation, find new partners, or sell out, if possible.â€Â  Rushing provided a data sheet showing that he had given over $4,000,000 to Pentaura in notes.Â  Of that amount, he contended McKinney owed $987,178.30, Block owed $1,269,298.13, and Weiss owed $282,119.83.Â  \r\nMcKinney and Block both responded by letters dated July 20, 2001.Â  McKinney indicated he did not agree to an â€œout-of-pocket pro rata share of any loans.â€Â  He indicated he had made â€œall the intended investment in the company at the time the investments were made.â€Â  Block expressed surprise that Rushing was still operating Pentaura, and indicated: â€œIn June of 2000 you told me that you were closing the plant due to poor sales.â€Â  Block stated that he had refused to make capital contributions twice in the past and that he did not believe himself personally liable for Pentauraâ€™s debts.Â  Rushing responded to their letters, asserting that Respondents â€œknewâ€ that he agreed to â€œfund Pentaura with loans to be repaid on a pro-rata share of ownership.Â  Never have I heard that you didnâ€™t intend to pay me back or reduce your percentage of ownership.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â Â  \r\nRushing filed a complaint on March 1, 2002, an amended complaint on April 10, 2003, and a second amended complaint on April 23, 2003.Â  In his second amended complaint, Rushing asserted causes of action against McKinney, Block, and Weiss for breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of good faith and fair dealing, piercing the corporate veil, breach of fiduciary duty, promissory estoppel, and equitable estoppel.[3]Â  Rushing also brought a derivative action on behalf of Pentaura against McKinney, Block, and Weiss, seeking reimbursement for payments made by Pentaura on the BB&amp;T notes.Â  Weiss defaulted.Â  McKinney and Block answered, denying the existence of a contract and any allegations of wrongdoing.Â  They also raised several affirmative defenses, including the statute of frauds, statute of limitations, unclean hands, and a violation of securities laws by Rushing.Â  Furthermore, McKinney and Block asserted a cross-claim against Weiss for his share of the BB&amp;T notes.Â  \r\nThe case was tried without a jury in April and May of 2003. Â The trial court entered an order finding Rushing was not entitled to recover under any of his causes of action against McKinney and Block.Â  In addition, the trial court held the statute of frauds, securities laws, and the statute of limitations would preclude Rushing from recovering under certain causes of action if he had prevailed.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nThis appeal involves both legal and equitable causes of action.Â  When both legal and equitable causes of action are maintained in one suit, each must be analyzed separately according to its own identity as legal or equitable. Â Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005); Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 97, 478 S.E.2d 45, 49 (1996).Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â  â€œIn an action in equity, tried by the judge alone, without a reference, on appeal the [appellate court] has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its views of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nRushing asserted causes of action against McKinney and Block alleging breach of contract, fraudulent inducement, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of good faith and fair dealing, and breach of fiduciary duty arising from this alleged contract.Â  These are legal causes of action.Â  See Electro Lab of Aiken, Inc. v. Sharp Constr. Co. of Sumter, Inc., 357 S.C. 363, 367, 593 S.E.2d 170, 172 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œAn action for breach of contract is an action at law.â€); Bivens v. Watkins, 313 S.C. 228, 230, 437 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App. 1993) (applying a legal standard of review on appeal from causes of action alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty).Â  Therefore, the findings of fact of the trial court will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the courtâ€™s findings.Â  Townes, 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nHowever, Rushing also asserted rights under the doctrines of estoppel.Â  â€œ[E]quitable estoppel . . . should be tried by the court as an equitable issue.â€Â  Gaymon v. Richland Memâ€™l Hosp., 327 S.C. 66, 68, 488 S.E.2d 332, 333&nbsp;(1997).Â  â€œThe doctrine of\r\npromissory estoppel is equitable in nature.â€Â  West v. Newberry Elec. Co-op., 357 S.C. 537, 541-42, 593 S.E.2d 500, 502 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Therefore, on appeal from these causes of action, we have jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Townes, 266 S.C. at 86, 221 S.E.2d at 775.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Breach of Contract\r\nRushing argues a contract arose with Respondents at the February Meeting, and thus, the trial court erred in finding he failed to prove the existence of contract.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nÂ â€œFor a contract to arise there must be an agreement between two or more parties.Â  There must be an offer, there must be an acceptance, and there must be a meeting of the minds of the parties involved.â€Â  Hughes v. Edwards, 265 S.C. 529, 536, 220 S.E.2d 231, 234 (1975).Â  â€œA contract is an obligation which arises from actual agreement of the parties manifested by words, oral or written, or by conduct.â€Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 660, 582 S.E.2d 432, 439 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nRushing testified that Respondents were silent at the February Meeting when he proposed that they would be responsible for their pro rata share of the money Rushing put into Pentaura.Â  Thus, he stated, they agreed with his proposal.Â  However, Rushing made various allegations concerning the specifics of the alleged agreement with Respondents.Â  Rushingâ€™s second amended complaint describes the agreement as one in which â€œRushing would advance monies from time to time necessary to fund Pentaura operations in the form of loans with the understanding that in the event Pentaura was unsuccessful, the monies would be treated as loans by [the shareholders] based on the percentage ownership interest of each of them in Pentaura.â€Â  In his deposition, Rushing stated he â€œadvanced money for other people for capital contributions.â€Â  Later in the deposition, Rushing said he had not made loans to individuals, but he had put money into Pentaura on their behalf.Â  He also testified in his deposition that the money was â€œloaned to Pentaura to use as capital.â€Â  On direct examination, Rushing testified he would loan Respondents â€œsome money to put in their partâ€ with the loans coming due only if Pentaura could not pay them off from earnings.Â  Rushing later testified â€œ[t]his [money] was a loan to Pentauraâ€”no, itâ€™s a loan to the shareholders that Pentaura was usingâ€ and â€œPentaura was the recipient of the money.Â  My loan of the money was to the shareholders.â€ \r\nGrant and Weiss, who were at the February Meeting, testified that the agreement was that Respondents would â€œsettle upâ€ or â€œpay the Piperâ€ with Rushing regarding the loans if Pentaura became unsuccessful.Â  Grant admitted that â€œsettle upâ€ was not defined and that the parties had been given options of settling up in the past by making contributions or giving up some percentage of stock.Â Â  \r\nRespondents denied that anything rendering them personally responsible was proposed or that they agreed to be personally responsible.Â  \r\nThe trial court found no oral contract existed because: â€œ(1) the proposal by Rushing, if made, was too vague and uncertain, (2) there was no meeting of the minds, and (3) silence by Defendants McKinney and Block cannot under the present circumstances be deemed acceptance.â€Â  The record is replete with evidence reasonably supporting the trial courtâ€™s finding.\r\nWe agree with the trial court that it is unclear exactly what the alleged agreement entailed.Â  Rushing alternately asserted the money given to Pentaura was either a loan to the company, a loan to Respondents for Pentaura, or a capital contribution on behalf of Respondents.Â  The February Letter, summarizing what occurred at the February Meeting, failed to mention that Respondents agreed to be personally liable for the notes to Pentaura.Â  Even Rushingâ€™s witness, Grant, testified that the agreement to â€œsettle upâ€ was not defined.Â  Further, the summary of Rushingâ€™s statements to his banker in the Maness Memo indicate Rushing was seeking alternative relief from Respondents in the form of a pro rata contribution or giving up a percentage of stock.Â  Contrary to Rushingâ€™s allegation that Respondents agreed to reimburse him, his July 24, 2001 letters to Block and McKinney indicate that the parties had the option of paying him back or reducing their percentage of stock.Â  Finally, the notes evidencing the money given to Pentaura only hold Pentaura liable for the funds.Â  This evidence reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that the agreement as alleged by Rushing was vague and that no meeting of the minds occurred.\r\nIt is also unusual that Rushing documented other agreements regarding the shareholders and their relationship to Pentaura, but he failed to document the alleged agreement here.Â  Rushing confirmed the agreement with respect to his entry into Pentaura by letter.Â  Rushing wrote a memorandum to Grant with respect to the February Meeting stating: â€œDid we get minutes and signatures to show that [McKinney and Block] gave up some ownership?Â  This needs to be documented to avoid any future misunderstanding.â€Â  The February Letter is the only writing sent to McKinney and Block that memorializes the February Meeting.Â  While it confirms various other agreements and discussions that occurred at the February Meeting, it makes no mention of an agreement for Rushing to loan money to McKinney, Block, Weiss, or Pentaura.Â  In fact, it specifically details Pentauraâ€™s cash needs and the requested capital contributions of each shareholder.Â  Rushing testified on direct examination he â€œthought it was very important . . . if there was any monies put into [Pentaura] or loans made, that there [should be] a clear paper trail that accountants could go in, their accountants, my accountants, court accountants, anybody could go through [the paperwork] . . . to have a basis by which the understanding was made.â€Â  The lack of a writing evidencing the alleged contract here sits in stark contrast to this pattern.\r\nFinally, the record reveals significant tension existed between the parties at the time the alleged contract occurred.Â  This tension is inconsistent with Rushingâ€™s assertion he relied on the silence of McKinney and Block to enter into the contract here.Â  Rushing contended Block did not perform his responsibilities under the April 23, 1997 letter.Â  On May 13, 1997, Block responded to Rushingâ€™s inquiries as to why manufacturing was not running properly by indicating Pentaura lacked complete sets of parts.Â  Further tension was added when the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control did not issue a painting permit to Pentaura.Â  Rushing testified that â€œright after [he] got into this business . . . Pentaura receive[d] letters that came to [his] attention from attorneys . . . demanding payment of back invoices[.]â€Â  Rushing also stated customers were getting mad at him.Â  According to Rushing, Block did not undertake to solve any of the problems after Rushing began investing.Â  The problems climaxed after a physical inventory indicated a $277,781 inventory shortage on the February 28, 1997 balance sheet, which Rushing had relied upon to invest in Pentuara.Â  Block was also upset when his recommendations regarding expensive equipment were not followed.Â  These circumstances reasonably support the trial courtâ€™s finding that an oral agreement among the shareholders to fund Pentaura is improbable.Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s determination that no contract arose at the February Meeting is reasonably supported by Rushingâ€™s inability to articulate the alleged agreement between the parties, Respondentsâ€™ denial of the existence of the agreement, the lack of a writing evidencing the alleged agreement when Rushing had reduced similar agreements to written form, and the overriding tension between the parties before the alleged agreement occurred.Â  \r\nII. Estoppel\r\nRushing argues the trial court erred in failing to grant equitable relief under theories of equitable estoppel and promissory estoppel.Â  We disagree.\r\nA. Equitable Estoppel\r\nRushing argues that because Respondents knew Pentaura needed additional funding, he had the right to rely on their silence as assent when he proposed the alleged agreement.Â  Thus, he argues, Respondents are equitably estopped to assert there was no agreement. \r\nâ€œThe doctrine of estoppel applies if a person, by his actions, conduct, words or silence which amounts to a representation, or a concealment of material facts, causes another to alter his position to his prejudice or injury.â€Â  Hubbard v. Beverly, 197 S.C. 476, 480, 15 S.E.2d 740, 741 (1941). â€œPrejudice to the other party is an essential element of equitable estoppel.â€Â  Janasick v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 344, 415 S.E.2d 384, 387 (1992).Â  With regard to the party estopped, the elements of equitable estoppel are: (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts, â€œor, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert;â€ (2) the intention or expectation that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the real facts.Â  Southern Dev. Land &amp; Golf Co., v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993).Â  â€œAs related to the party claiming the estoppel, the essential elements are: (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question, (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped, and (3) prejudicial change in position.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe trial court held that the doctrine of estoppel was not available to Rushing because he failed in his corporate duties, had unclean hands,[4] was not justified in relying on McKinneyâ€™s or Blockâ€™s silence, and should not have proceeded without a clear, unambiguous written agreement.Â  \r\nRushing did not lack the means of knowledge to discover McKinneyâ€™s and Blockâ€™s true intentions with respect to the alleged agreement at the February Meeting, and his reliance on their silence is unreasonable.Â  â€œOne with knowledge of the truth or the means by which with reasonable diligence he could acquire knowledge cannot claim to have been mislead (sic).â€Â  Southern Dev. Land &amp; Golf, 311 S.C. at 34, 426 S.E.2d at 751.Â  As discussed above, Rushing knew to put agreements in writing in order to avoid later misunderstandings.Â  For example, Rushing testified â€œ[t]wo things Iâ€™ve always thought was very important (sic) . . . . the second thing if there was any monies put into this thing or loans made, that there was a clear paper trail.â€Â  Despite this knowledge, Rushing did not get a signed writing evidencing a potentially unlimited line of credit from McKinney and Block to put into a limited liability enterprise.Â  Rushing had ample opportunity to ask McKinney and Block to sign a writing containing the terms of the alleged agreement or to memorialize the alleged agreement in a writing addressed to McKinney and Block.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold Rushing did not lack the means necessary to discover the true intentions of McKinney and Block, and Rushingâ€™s reliance on the alleged oral agreement or silent acquiescence of McKinney and Block is unreasonable. \r\nB. Promissory Estoppel\r\nRushing argues Respondents should be estopped from denying the existence of the agreement because they made promises that induced him into paying Pentauraâ€™s operating expenses for years.Â  \r\nThe elements of promissory estoppel are: \r\n\r\n(1) the presence of a promise unambiguous in its terms; (2) reasonable reliance upon the promise by the party to whom the promise is made; (3) the reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party who makes the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made must sustain injury in reliance on the promise.\r\n\r\nWoods v. State, 314 S.C. 501, 505, 431 S.E.2d 260, 263 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nRushing failed to show the existence of an unambiguous promise.Â  As discussed above, Rushing could not clearly articulate the terms of the alleged oral contract, including whether the money would be treated as a loan or capital contribution, how much money would ultimately be forwarded to Pentaura, or how Respondents would â€œsettle up.â€Â  Moreover, as previously discussed, Rushingâ€™s reliance on the alleged promise of McKinney and Block is unreasonable in light of the tension between the parties and the ambiguities of the alleged promise.Â  Therefore, Rushing is precluded from recovering on a theory of promissory estoppel.Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the evidence reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that no agreement arose at the February Meeting that would allow Rushing to advance unlimited money to Pentaura on behalf of McKinney and Block.Â  Moreover, Rushing is not entitled to equitable relief based on his advances to Pentaura.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n AFFIRMED.[5]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Weiss defaulted below and is not a party to this appeal.Â Â  \r\n[2] Although Rushing points out the funds he advanced to Pentaura were borrowed, the â€œcostâ€ of these funds to Rushing varied between six percent and 8.875 percent, as evidenced by Rushingâ€™s credit line summary.Â  Therefore, if Pentaura (or McKinney, Block, and Weiss on its behalf) had repaid the loans, the portions repaid to Rushing would have provided Rushing a profit based on the difference in interest rates.Â  \r\n[3] In addition, Rushing brought causes of action against Pentaura for rent due to Rushing-Marlow Properties, Inc. and Shasta Property, L.L.C., and for collection on the promissory notes of Pentaura payable to Rushing.Â  The court found Rushing could proceed on the action for rent.Â  The current appeal does not concern the rent cause of action.Â  \r\n[4]Â  The trial court found Rushing had unclean hands because even if the alleged oral agreement existed, it would have meant that Rushing essentially sold either stock or interest in Pentauraâ€™s debt without making full disclosures.Â  Thus, the court found, Rushingâ€™s actions violated the securities laws in effect at the time.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, all of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Kenneth Navy appeals his conviction for homicide by child abuse, arguing the trial court erred in:Â  (1) admitting three inculpatory statements; and (2) refusing to grant a new trial as a result of the Stateâ€™s treatment of defense witnesses and closing argument.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 9, 2003, Navy and his neighbor, Terry Crocker, were at Navyâ€™s residence watching television.Â  Navyâ€™s twenty-three-month-old son, Kenneth Navy, III (the â€œvictimâ€), was upstairs taking a nap.Â  At some point the victim became distressed, and 911 was called.Â  Emergency workers responding to that call observed Navy administering CPR to the victim.Â  The victim was transported to the hospital and pronounced dead shortly after arrival.Â  Navy informed the emergency workers, the nurse who greeted him at the hospital, and a child life specialist at the hospital that the victim had been born four months premature, had lung and heart problems, and had fallen from his highchair a few days prior to his death without any serious injuries.Â  Navy also stated he went upstairs to check on the victim, who had been fussy that day, he went downstairs to get the victim a bottle, and the victim was not breathing when he returned.Â  Navy gave essentially the same version of events to a police detective at the hospital and to the coroner.Â Â  \r\nThe coroner examining the victimâ€™s body discovered four rib fractures that had occurred at different times over a period of weeks prior to the victimâ€™s death.Â  The coroner opined the victim had been suffocated.Â  A tipster called and met with another coroner from the same office to say that she believed the victim had been suffocated and pushed down the stairs.Â  The tipster, whom police were able to identify, wished to remain anonymous and was not identified at trial because she feared retaliation from her family and Navyâ€™s family.Â  \r\nAfter learning of the autopsy results and the information from the tipster, Lieutenant James Smith and Sergeant Lancy Weeks drove to Navyâ€™s home on the day of the victimâ€™s funeral visitation and asked if Navy would be willing to accompany them to the police station for more questioning.Â  After Navy inquired as to whether the questioning could wait until after the funeral, he was informed that it could not wait.Â  Navy was not placed under arrest, but he agreed to ride with the officers in their car to the police station.Â  Navy was not given his Miranda[1] warnings, and he gave a statement at 9:50 a.m. describing the events on the day the victim died.Â  Navy initially stated that he went to check on the crying victim in his crib, he patted him on the back to comfort him, and he went downstairs to get a bottle.Â  Upon his return, he realized the victim was having difficulty breathing, he panicked, ran up and down the stairs, and then returned to find the victim lifeless.Â  The officers typed up the statement (â€œfirst written statementâ€), had Navy sign it, and then informed a shocked Navy that the victim died from suffocation and had broken ribs.Â Â Â  \r\nSmith then asked Navy to describe exactly how he comforted the victim.Â  Navy stated he may have popped the victim on his back and patted the victim on his mouth to stop him from crying (â€œoral statementâ€).Â  Navy was then given his Miranda warnings, and he signed a written waiver agreeing to talk with police at 11:35 a.m.Â  In his second written statement given at 11:40 a.m., Navy indicated he put his hand over the victimâ€™s mouth when he could not get the child to be quiet.Â  He stated he did not hold his hand there.Â  Navy further stated: â€œI knew I knocked out his breath and I figured he would catch it by the time I got back up to the room.Â  I heard him making that noise.Â  It was like he was still trying to catch his breath.Â  That was when I panicked.Â  He quit breathing . . . .â€Â  Navy admitted he could have placed his hand over the victimâ€™s nose as well.Â Â Â  \r\nAfter taking Navyâ€™s second written statement, Weeks consulted with the coroner.Â  The coroner opined that Navy had to have held his hand over the victimâ€™s mouth and nose for more than just a brief period.Â  Police confronted Navy with this information, and Navy gave a third written statement at 12:25 p.m. in which he said he could have held his hand over the victimâ€™s mouth and nose for a minute, but not more than two minutes.Â  Navy stated the child was gasping for breath when he removed his hand.Â  Navy was questioned for a total of approximately three hours.Â Â Â  \r\nNavy was placed under arrest for homicide by child abuse.Â  He moved to suppress the oral statement and the second and third written statements prior to trial.Â  After the Jackson v. Denno[2] hearing, the trial court denied the motion to suppress, finding the first statement was not a custodial statement and the second and third statements were given after Navy was given his Miranda warnings.Â  \r\nAt trial, the State presented evidence that although the victim had serious lung difficulties immediately after his premature birth, the victim was healthy at the time of his death.Â  Dr. Teresa Baggett, the pediatrician who treated the victim a few months prior to his death, testified that when the victim was born, he required oxygen and an apnea monitor for a few months, later suffered from an asthma-type condition called reactive airway disease, and required treatment with Albuteral, a nebulizer, monthly shots, and injections of Synergist to protect him from the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).Â  Dr. Baggett stated the victim was having difficulty breathing in August 2001, and the parents were instructed to perform aggressive chest physiotherapy, or pounding of the chest, to loosen lung secretions.Â  At his October 2002 visit, the victim was wheezing and had an ear infection.Â  However, when the victim returned for a follow up visit in November 2002, Dr. Baggett testified his lungs were clear and she advised the victimâ€™s mother to decrease the frequency of his nebulizer treatments.Â Â Â  \r\nA radiologist examined the victimâ€™s x-rays from his August 2001 treatment and from his autopsy.Â  The radiologist testified that although the first of the three August 2001 x-rays was of poor quality, the other two showed no rib fractures.Â  The radiologist also opined that the four rib fractures visible in the victimâ€™s autopsy x-ray were caused by forceful trauma and could not have occurred from a fall or during aggressive chest physiotherapy or CPR.Â  Further, Dr. Clay Nichols, the coroner who conducted the victimâ€™s autopsy, testified the victimâ€™s lungs were clear, normal, and not inflamed or filled with mucous at the time of death.Â  \r\nNavy presented evidence to show that he was not a violent person, that the victimâ€™s death could have resulted from his lung deficiencies, and that the rib fractures were old fractures from August 2001 that had not healed.Â  Navyâ€™s orthopedic surgery expert, Dr. Thomas Trancik, testified the victim had four rib fractures based on the first August 2001 x-ray, which was of poor quality.Â  He admitted he could not locate the fractures in the subsequent two August 2001 x-rays.Â  Trancik also opined the rib fractures could be consistent with the administration of CPR at the time of the victimâ€™s death.Â  During cross-examination, the State commented that Trancik was â€œno expert,â€ Navy objected to the comment, it was struck from the record, and Navy did not request further instructions to the jury or a mistrial.Â  \r\nNavyâ€™s neighbor, Terry Crocker, Navyâ€™s sister, the victimâ€™s speech therapist, Navyâ€™s wife, and Navyâ€™s father all testified that they never witnessed Navy being violent with his children.Â  Crocker, who was in Navyâ€™s home at the time the victim stopped breathing, testified that Navy was not upset that day, that he witnessed Navy go upstairs to check on the victim, and that Navy returned downstairs very fast, saying the victim was not breathing.Â  \r\nNavy testified he never abused his children and did not suffocate his son.Â  During cross-examination, the solicitor asked Navy to admit that â€œevery time we took a break when the jury was gone you were laughing and cutting up, werenâ€™t you?â€Â  Navyâ€™s objection was sustained and no further instructions were requested.Â  When the solicitor began screaming at Navy, the court instructed the solicitor to treat Navy â€œwith respect.â€Â  The State also brought out on cross-examination of the defense witnesses that although Navy had never been convicted of a violent crime, police had been called to his home numerous times for violent arguments, he had been suspended from high school for punching a coach, he had been accused of attempting to assault a sixteen-year-old girl, and he had been in a physical altercation with his father.Â  \r\nNavy was convicted of homicide by child abuse and sentenced to twenty years imprisonment.Â  His motion for a new trial was denied, and this appeal follows.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  Appellate review of whether a person is in custody for Miranda purposes is limited to a determination of whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by the record.Â  State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 583, 582 S.E.2d 407, 409 (2003).Â  Further, the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 163, 539 S.E.2d 67, 69 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Suppression of Statements\r\nNavy argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his three inculpatory statements.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe purpose of the Miranda warnings is to apprise the defendant of [his] constitutional privilege not to incriminate [himself] while in the custody of law enforcement.â€Â  Evans, 354 S.C. at 583, 582 S.E.2d at 409.Â  Miranda requires that warnings be given to a suspect after he or she has been taken into custody or deprived of his or her freedom in any significant way.Â  Id. at 583, 582 S.E.2d at 410 (citing Miranda, 384 U.S. 436, 444 (1966)).Â  This language has been interpreted to mean a â€œformal arrest or detention associated with a formal arrest.â€Â  State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 127, 489 S.E.2d 617, 621 (1997).Â  Whether a suspect is in â€œcustodyâ€ for Miranda purposes is an objective determination based upon the totality of the circumstances, including â€œthe individualâ€™s freedom to leave the scene and the purpose, place and length of the questioning. . . .â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe relevant inquiry is whether a reasonable man in the suspectâ€™s position would have understood himself to be in custody.â€Â  Bradley v. State, 316 S.C. 255, 257, 449 S.E.2d 492, 493-94 (1994).Â  The custodial determination is not based upon the subjective views of the suspect or the interrogating officers.Â  Easler, 327 S.C. at 128, 489 S.E.2d at 621.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Inculpatory Oral Statement\r\nNavy argues the trial court erred in refusing to suppress his inculpatory oral statement because he was in custody at the time and he was not given his Miranda warnings prior to making the statement.Â  \r\nAt the Jackson v. Denno hearing, Lieutenant James Smith testified that Navy voluntarily accompanied him and Sergeant Lancy Weeks back to the station to discuss the case.Â  Smith testified he did not administer Miranda warnings because Navy was not under arrest, Smith informed Navy that he was not under arrest, and Navy was very cooperative with investigators despite being upset and crying.Â  Smith stated he would not have taken Navy to the Sheriffâ€™s Department if Navy did not want to go.Â  Once at the Sheriffâ€™s Department, Smith testified Navy was given a soda and escorted outside to smoke a cigarette.Â  According to Smith, Navy would have been allowed to leave had he requested to do so.Â Â Â  \r\nSmith admitted he had the coronerâ€™s autopsy report prior to questioning Navy.Â  After about one hour of questioning, Navy signed the first written statement that was substantially similar to the story given at the hospital.Â  Smith testified he then confronted Navy with the coronerâ€™s opinion that the victim had been suffocated and had four fractured ribs.Â  In response to Smithâ€™s question regarding how he comforted the victim, Navy gave the oral statement that he popped the victim on his back and may have patted the victimâ€™s mouth to calm the crying.Â  At that point, they took a break so Navy could smoke another cigarette outside.Â  Smith testified he escorted Navy outside to smoke a cigarette because no one was allowed to wander the Sheriffâ€™s Department alone. Â Smith stated Navy was still not in custody and would have been allowed to go home if he had requested to do so.Â  However, out of an abundance of caution, Smith stated he gave Navy his Miranda warnings when they returned to his office. \r\nNavy testified at the Jackson v. Denno hearing that he was extremely upset and had not slept or eaten in three days when Smith and Weeks requested that he accompany them to give a statement.Â  Navy stated he only completed the ninth grade in school and had difficulty reading cursive writing.Â  Navy denied that he was given Miranda warnings after his oral statement, testifying that either he was not given Miranda warnings until his third statement or that he could not recall when he was given Miranda warnings.Â  Navy testified that the first written statement, substantially similar to the statement he gave at the hospital, was the only correct statement.Â  He claimed the officers placed the second and third written statement along with the first written statement in front of him, the officers required him to sign all three typed statements at one time before he could go home, and Navy did not read the statements before signing them.Â  \r\nCiting State v. Evans, 354 S.C. 579, 582 S.E.2d 407 (2003), Navyâ€™s counsel argued any reference to his oral statement that he â€œpoppedâ€ the victim on the back should be suppressed because Navy was operating under an emotional disability and was not given Miranda warnings prior to making the statement.Â  The trial court determined Navy was not in custody at the time he voluntarily gave his first statement[3] because he was free to leave.Â  The court distinguished Evans from Navyâ€™s situation, finding there was a â€œbullying atmosphereâ€ in questioning Evans and the police ignored her requests for help.Â Â Â  \r\nIn Evans, the mentally disabled defendant was aggressively questioned at the police station about a fire at her home that killed her three children.Â  During her three-hour interview, police repeatedly told her they did not believe her theories of how the fire could have started, and they ignored her repeated requests to â€œget her some help.â€Â  Evans was escorted to and from the bathroom, and relatives who had accompanied her to the police station were not allowed to see her.Â  The trial court suppressed the inculpatory statement Evans eventually gave, finding Evans was in custody at the time and was not given her Miranda warnings.Â  In making the custodial determination, the court:Â  found Evans was not free to leave; considered the fact that the interrogation occurred in a back office at the police station; considered the fact that the interrogation was three hours long; and was concerned with the officersâ€™ purpose in their method of questioning.Â  The supreme court held the trial courtâ€™s order reflected that the court objectively considered the totality of the circumstances in determining that Evans was in custody.Â  Evans, 354 S.C. at 583-84, 582 S.E.2d at 410.Â  \r\nReviewing the totality of the circumstances, we find the present case is substantially similar to Evans such that the trial court erred in finding Navy was not in custody at the time of the oral inculpatory statement.Â  Navy was informed by officers that questioning at the station could not wait.Â  Thus, despite Navyâ€™s testimony that he willingly accompanied the officers, one could reasonably interpret the officersâ€™ refusal to delay the questioning until after the funeral as a mandate to accompany the officers.Â  Navy was further transported to the Sheriffâ€™s Department in the backseat of a patrol car, rendering him unable to return home on his own.Â  Further, Navy was not allowed to walk about the Sheriffâ€™s Department freely, and he was accompanied for smoke breaks.Â  Although the officers claimed they merely wanted a statement of the events on the date of the victimâ€™s death, Navy was repeatedly questioned for a length of time.Â  Finally, the officers were familiar with the autopsy report prior to questioning Navy, indicating the purpose of the questioning was to obtain an inculpatory statement.Â  \r\nViewing the length, location, and purpose of the questioning, a reasonable person would believe themselves to be in custody.Â  Accordingly, Navyâ€™s oral statement should not have been admitted.Â  \r\n B. Second and Third Written Statements\r\nNavy argues the trial court erred by failing to suppress his second and third written statements because they were obtained as a result of information learned from the oral inculpatory statement made prior to Miranda warnings.Â  \r\nGenerally, an â€œinitial failure to administer Miranda warnings before a statement is given does not taint a subsequent statement, made after a suspect has been fully advised of and has waived his Miranda rights, when both statements are voluntary.â€Â  State v. Campbell, 287 S.C. 377, 379, 339 S.E.2d 109, 110 (1985); see Oregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 309 (1985) (â€œIt is an unwarranted extension of Miranda to hold that a simple failure to administer the warnings, unaccompanied by any actual coercion or other circumstances calculated to undermine the suspectâ€™s ability to exercise his free will, so taints the investigatory process that a subsequent voluntary and informed waiver is ineffective for some indeterminate period.Â  Though Miranda requires that the unwarned admission must be suppressed, the admissibility of any subsequent statement should turn in these circumstances solely on whether it is knowingly and voluntarily made.â€).Â  \r\nHowever, the United States Supreme Court has recently held unconstitutional the police tactic of â€œquestion-first,â€ where officers intentionally question a suspect until inculpatory information is given and then provide Miranda warnings prior to having the suspect repeat the inculpatory information.Â  Missouri v. Seibert, 542 U.S. 600, 613 (2004) (noting that Miranda warning given mid-interrogation, after a defendant had given an unwarned confession, was ineffective in informing a suspect that she could decide not to speak further with police after essentially saying everything there was to say; thus, the confession repeated after the warning was given was inadmissible at trial).Â  The plurality in Seibert noted as follows:\r\n\r\n[W]hen Miranda warnings are inserted in the midst of coordinated and continuing interrogation, they are likely to mislead and â€œdepriv[e] a defendant of knowledge essential to his ability to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of abandoning them.â€Â  Moran v. Burbine, 475 U.S. 412, 424, 106 S.Ct. 1135, 89 L.Ed.2d 410 (1986).Â  By the same token, it would ordinarily be unrealistic to treat two spates of integrated and proximately conducted questioning as independent interrogations subject to independent evaluation simply because Miranda warnings formally punctuate them in the middle.\r\n\r\nSeibert, 542 U.S. at 613-14.Â  \r\nThe Seibert plurality went on to distinguish the admissibility of subsequent statements elicited in an Elstad-type of confession from statements elicited pursuant to the â€œquestion-firstâ€ tactic.[4]Â  Noting that the failure to give a warning prior to the confession in Elstad was merely an oversight whereas the â€œquestion-firstâ€ tactic was purposefully designed to undermine Miranda warnings, the Seibert court pointed out several considerations to determine whether mid-interrogation Miranda warnings are effective, rendering subsequent statements admissible:\r\n\r\nThe contrast between Elstad and this case reveals a series of relevant facts that bear on whether Miranda warnings delivered midstream could be effective enough to accomplish their object:Â  the completeness and detail of the questions and answers in the first round of interrogation, the overlapping content of the two statements, the timing and setting of the first and the second, the continuity of police personnel, and the degree to which the interrogatorâ€™s questions treated the second round as continuous with the first. In Elstad, it was not unreasonable to see the occasion for questioning at the station house as presenting a markedly different experience from the short conversation at home; since a reasonable person in the suspectâ€™s shoes could have seen the station house questioning as a new and distinct experience, the Miranda warnings could have made sense as presenting a genuine choice whether to follow up on the earlier admission.\r\n\r\nSeibert, 542 U.S. at 615-16.\r\nApplying the Seibert factors, we find the questioning of Navy was an integrated, coordinated, and continuing interrogation such that giving warnings mid-interrogation was ineffective and rendered the second and third written statements inadmissible.Â  Navy was questioned at the police station, over a period of three hours, and by the same officers.Â  The officers asked similar questions with each statement, and the three statements overlapped in content.Â  The officerâ€™s questions to Navy post-Miranda warning were related to the oral inculpatory statement, indicating the officer treated the â€œsecond round as continuous with the first.â€Â  Further, because the officers were familiar with the coronerâ€™s opinion that the victim was suffocated prior to questioning Navy, it can hardly be said that the failure to give Miranda warnings prior to obtaining the oral inculpatory statement was inadvertent, as was the case in Elstad.Â  Because the officersâ€™ actions in the present case are substantially similar to those in Seibert,[5] we find the trial court erred in finding the second and third statements were admissible. \r\nTo summarize, we find Navy was in custody at the time he gave his oral inculpatory statement, and the mid-interrogation Miranda warning given to Navy in this situation was not effective in advising him of his rights or the consequences of abandoning them.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s finding that all three inculpatory statements were admissible. \r\nII. Solicitorâ€™s Closing Argument \r\nCiting Toyota of Florence v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 442 S.E.2d 611 (1994), Navy argues the trial court erred in refusing to grant him a new trial because the Stateâ€™s closing argument was outrageous.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is given broad discretion in determining the appropriateness of a solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  State v. Rudd, 355 S.C. 543, 548, 586 S.E.2d 153, 156 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appellate review absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  An appellant must prove both an abuse of discretion and resulting prejudice to warrant reversal.Â  State v. Sierra, 337 S.C. 368, 373, 523 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nâ€œA solicitorâ€™s closing argument must not appeal to the personal biases of the jurors nor be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, and its content should stay within the record and reasonable inferences to it.â€Â  Humphries v. State, 351 S.C. 362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002).Â  In reviewing a solicitorâ€™s closing argument, the court must determine whether the comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Caldwell, 300 S.C. 494, 504, 388 S.E.2d 816, 822 (1990).Â  Improper comments do not require reversal if they are determined not to be prejudicial to the defendant.Â  Rudd, 355 S.C. at 550, 586 S.E.2d at 157.Â  Arguments of counsel are not considered so inflammatory as to require a reversal where â€œcounsel responds in kind to a previous argument of opposing counsel.â€Â  Dial v. Niggel Assocs., Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 258, 509 S.E.2d 269, 271 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal, an appellate court will review the alleged impropriety of the solicitorâ€™s argument in the context of the entire record, including whether the trial judgeâ€™s instructions adequately cured the improper argument and whether there is overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt.â€ Â Rudd, 355 S.C. at 550, 586 S.E.2d at 157. \r\nDuring the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, he evaluated all of the evidence and testimony presented in Navyâ€™s defense.Â  The solicitor referred to Navyâ€™s assertions in closing, his witnesses, or other evidence presented in Navyâ€™s defense as â€œlies,â€ â€œliars,â€ or â€œuntrueâ€ statements on at least seventeen occasions.Â  Navy never objected to any of these statements.Â  In his later motion for a new trial, Navy argued he was entitled to a new trial because the solicitorâ€™s argument was â€œextremely inflammatoryâ€ by attacking Navyâ€™s character, by referencing all the uncharged violent offenses, and by calling Navyâ€™s witnesses liars.Â  Navy admitted he did not object to the closing argument, but he argued he was entitled to a new trial pursuant to Toyota of Florence v. Lynch due to the outrageousness of the closing argument.Â  The court denied the motion for a new trial.Â  \r\nGenerally, a party must make a contemporaneous objection to improper arguments or the objection is waived.Â  Dial, 333 S.C. at 256-57, 509 S.E.2d at 271; State v. Young, 364 S.C. 476, 494, 613 S.E.2d 386, 395 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, our supreme court has held that â€œeven in the absence of a contemporaneous objection, a new trial motion should be granted in flagrant cases where a vicious, inflammatory argument results in clear prejudice.â€Â  Toyota of Florence v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 263, 442 S.E.2d 611, 615 (1994) (holding a new trial should be granted, despite the lack of contemporaneous objections to closing argument, where counsel used posters in closing argument that invoked racial stereotypes and were highly prejudicial).Â  The Toyota of Florence v. Lynch court described the circumstances of that particular case as â€œextraordinary,â€ and the court noted that it did not condone the failure to make a contemporaneous objection.Â  Id.; State v. Peay, 321 S.C. 405, 413, 468 S.E.2d 669, 673-74 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting the supreme court in Toyota of Florence v. Lynch â€œdid not condone the failure to contemporaneously object, and described the circumstances in that case as â€˜extraordinaryâ€™â€).\r\nThe solicitorâ€™s closing argument in the present case was certainly aggressive.Â  However, we do not find â€œextraordinaryâ€ circumstances present in this case that would excuse the failure to make a contemporaneous objection.Â  Navyâ€™s defense at trial centered on his claim that he was not a violent person and that his sonâ€™s injuries were the result of his lung disease and medical treatments.Â  In this context, the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was a direct response to Navyâ€™s defense and merely pointed out the problems with Navyâ€™s argument based on the evidence of record.Â  We do not find these remarks so inflammatory as to fall under the Toyota decision.Â  See Dial, 333 S.C. at 258, 509 S.E.2d at 271 (â€œIn this case, counselâ€™s â€˜deceit and liesâ€™ remark was in response to opposing counselâ€™s repeated accusation of deception.Â  In context, this remark was not so inflammatory as to come within the ambit of our decision in Toyota.â€).Â  Accordingly, Navyâ€™s failure to raise any objection to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument waived the issue for review and the trial court did not err in refusing to grant Navy a new trial.[6]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court erred in admitting Navyâ€™s voluntary oral statement and the second and third written statements.Â  However, the court did not err in refusing to grant Navy a new trial based on the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.

(SAF), appeals the trial courtâ€™s order granting RHBT Financial Corporationâ€™s (the Bankâ€™s) summary judgment motion on Myattâ€™s claims for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty/constructive fraud, negligence/gross negligence, negligent supervision, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.[1] Â We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nElfindepan is a Costa Rican corporation that orchestrated high-yield investment schemes.Â  SAF is a Panamanian entity that also facilitated these schemes.Â  Tracy Calvin Dunlap, Jr., acted as president of both of these entities.Â  \r\nIn early 2000, Stephen Dennis introduced Dunlap to Robert M. Yoffie.Â  At the time, Yoffie acted as the Senior Vice President and Trust Officer of the Bank.Â  On February 23, 2000, Dunlap entered into an agency agreement with the Bank.Â  This agreement provided that the Bank would act as an agent for Elfindepan, which was listed as the principal.Â  The agreement created a banking account at the Bank and listed Dunlap as the signatory on the account.Â  \r\nOn May 22, 2000, Dunlap entered into another banking agreement with the Bank.Â  The account owner was â€œTracy Dunlap DBA S.A.F.â€ Â Dunlap was the only signatory on this agreement.Â  On June 8, 2000, Dunlap changed this agreement to a corporate account, indicating SAF was the account owner and authorizing himself and Katherine Kennedy to be signatories on the account.Â  Dunlap later deposited checks made payable to Elfindepan and SAF into these accounts and directed the Bank to distribute the deposited funds to various people and entities.Â  \r\nSubsequently, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a complaint in federal court against Elfindepan, SAF, and Dunlap, alleging they defrauded investors.Â  The federal court later issued orders appointing Myatt as the receiver of both Elfindepan and SAF.Â  On November 15, 2002, Myatt (the Receiver), acting in this capacity, filed a complaint against the Bank and Yoffie, alleging causes of action for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty/constructive fraud, negligence/gross negligence, negligent supervision, unfair and deceptive trade practices, and aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nThe Bank answered, denying all of the Receiverâ€™s claims and asserting numerous affirmative defenses.Â  After discovery, the Bank moved for summary judgment on several grounds, including the doctrine of in pari delicto.Â  In addition, the Receiver moved for summary judgment on her claim for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty.Â  The trial court denied the Receiverâ€™s motion and granted summary judgment to the Bank, holding the doctrine of in pari delicto barred all of the Receiverâ€™s claims.Â  The court also granted summary judgment to the Bank on the alternative grounds that: Â (1) Dunlap controlled all aspects of SAFâ€™s and Elfindepanâ€™s business; (2) the Bank did not breach any duty to the two corporations; (3) the constructive fraud claim was barred because the Bank did not make any false representations; (4) any potential claim under the unrecognized cause of action for aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty was barred because there was no evidence that the Bank knowingly participated with Dunlap to breach a fiduciary duty to the two corporations; (5) the Receiverâ€™s unfair trade practices claim failed because the Bankâ€™s action of releasing the funds pursuant to Dunlapâ€™s instructions were permitted under the law; and (6) the Receiver could not show that the Bankâ€™s actions damaged the two corporations.[2]Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAn appellate court reviews the grant of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court.â€Â  Houck v. State Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326, 329 (2005).Â  The trial court should grant summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Gadson v. Hembree, 364 S.C. 316, 320, 613 S.E.2d 533, 535 (2005).Â  To determine whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Helms Realty, Inc. v. Gibson-Wall Co., 363 S.C. 334, 340, 611 S.E.2d 485, 488 (2005).Â  \r\nThe burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact is upon the party seeking summary judgment.Â  McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 376, 597 S.E.2d 181, 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the non-moving partyâ€™s case, the non-moving party cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rather, the non-moving party must come forward with specific facts showing a genuine issue for trial.Â  Peterson v. W. Am. Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 94, 518 S.E.2d 608, 610 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Receiver contends the trial court erred in holding the doctrine of in pari delicto barred all of her claims.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe doctrine of in pari delicto is â€œ[t]he principle that a plaintiff who has participated in wrongdoing may not recover damages resulting from the wrongdoing.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 794 (7th ed. 1999).Â  In South Carolina, this doctrine precludes one joint tort-feasor from seeking indemnity from another. Â See Rock Hill Tel. Co. v. Globe Commcâ€™ns, Inc., 363 S.C. 385, 389 n.2, 611 S.E.2d 235, 237 n.2 (2005) (â€œIn general, there is no right to indemnity between joint tortfeasors.â€); Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Whetstone, 243 S.C. 61, 68, 132 S.E.2d 172, 176 (1963) (holding that there generally is no right to indemnity between joint tortfeasors).Â  However, the â€œadverse interestâ€ exception applies where the actions of one wrong-doer, usually an agent, are clearly adverse to the other partyâ€™s interests.Â  See Little v. S. Cotton Oil Co., 156 S.C. 480, 483-84, 153 S.E. 462, 463 (1930) (â€œThe general rule is that when an agent is engaged in a transaction in which he is interested adversely to his principal, the principal will not be charged with knowledge of the agent acquired therein.â€).Â  Under this exception, the wrongs of the agent would not be imputed to the principal and in pari delicto would not apply.Â  \r\nNo case in South Carolina directly addresses the issue of whether a party can assert the defense of in pari delicto against the receiver of a corporation that engaged in past wrongdoing.Â  However, we think the decisions of the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals in Scholes v. Lehmann, 56 F.3d 750 (7th Cir. 1995), and Knauer v. Jonathon Roberts Financial Group, Inc., 348 F.3d 230 (7th Cir. 2003), should inform our decision in this case.\r\nIn Scholes, Michael Douglas created three corporations that he used to perpetuate Ponzi schemes.Â  The SEC filed a complaint against Douglas and the corporations, and the federal court appointed a receiver for the corporations.Â  The receiver brought suit against the transferees of the money collected from the Ponzi scheme, asserting a cause of action for fraudulent conveyance.Â  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held the receiver had standing to sue these transferees because â€œthe defense of in pari delicto loses its sting when the person who is in in pari delicto is eliminated.â€Â  Scholes, 56 F.3d at 754.Â  Â \r\nThe Scholes court relied on two important factors in reaching its decision.Â  First, it applied the adverse interest exception to the general rule that the knowledge of corporate agents is imputed to the corporation.Â  Id. at 754.Â  Additionally, the Seventh Circuit noted the receiver in Scholes sued the beneficiaries of the fraudulent conveyances.Â  See id. at 755 (â€œNow that the corporations created and initially controlled by Douglas are controlled by a receiver whose only object is to maximize the value of the corporations for the benefit of their investors and any creditors, we cannot see an objection to the receiverâ€™s bringing suit to recover corporate assets . . . .â€) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn Knauer, a receiver was appointed for two entities operating a Ponzi scheme. Â The entities were created for the purpose of collecting money from investors, but the officers and directors failed to invest the funds and allocated money to their own personal use.Â  The receiver brought causes of action sounding in tort against several brokers that helped sell securities from these entities.Â  The district court dismissed the receiverâ€™s claims, noting the receiverâ€™s complaint acknowledged the participation of the entities in the Ponzi schemes and, therefore, the entities were barred from suing the bank under the doctrine of in pari delicto.Â  Knauer, 348 F.3d at 232-33.\r\nIn affirming the district courtâ€™s decision, the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals held â€œ[i]f the case before us involved the voiding of a fraudulent conveyance . . . we would likely apply Scholes . . . .â€Â  Knauer, 348 F.3d at 236.Â  Furthermore, it noted â€œ[t]he key difference, for purposes of equity, between fraudulent conveyance cases such as Scholes and the instant case is the identities of the defendants.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œThe receiver here is not seeking to recover the diverted funds from the beneficiaries of the diversions . . . Rather, this claim is a claim for tort damages from entities that derived no benefit from the embezzlements, but that were allegedly partly to blame for their occurrence.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nSimilarly, the Receiver in the present case was seeking tort damages from the Bank for its actions regarding the accounts.Â  The Receiver was not seeking to recover diverted funds from the Bank.Â  Thus, relying on the Knauer decision, we hold that, in the absence of a fraudulent conveyance case, the receiver of a corporation used to perpetuate fraud may not seek recovery against an alleged third-party co-conspirator in the fraud.Â  In this case, the Receiver does not dispute the fact that Dunlap, the president of both Elfindepan and SAF, used these corporations to perpetrate a fraud on investors.Â  The apparent sole purpose for the existence of these corporations was to perpetuate the investment scheme.Â  Moreover, the Bank handled the accounts exactly as it was bound to do pursuant to the account agreements.Â  Thus, Receiver did not make any claim against the Bank for fraudulent conveyance.Â  Therefore, the trial court properly applied the doctrine of in pari delicto in granting the Bankâ€™s motion for summary judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial courtâ€™s decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.[3]\r\n HUFF, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The trial courtâ€™s order indicates RHBT Financial Corporation â€œis the holding company for Rock Hill Bank &amp; Trust.â€Â  Rock Hill Bank &amp; Trust is the entity that engaged in the actions relevant to this appeal.Â  Because the status of these entities has no bearing on this appeal, we refer to both as â€œthe Bank.â€\r\n[2]  After the trial court heard the Bankâ€™s motion for summary judgment, Yoffie also moved for summary judgment.Â  The trial court stayed this motion pending our decision in this case.Â  \r\n[3] Â Because we find the trial court correctly granted summary judgment based on in pari delicto, we need not address the remaining alternative sustaining grounds.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (holding the decision to address any additional sustaining grounds is within the appellate courtâ€™s discretion).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
