McKellar, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3955\r\nHeard February 9, 2005 â€“ Filed March 7, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Robert M. Dudek, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General S. Creighton Waters, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Warren Blair Giese, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Dushun Staten appeals his convictions for murder and lynching in the first degree.Â  He argues the trial court erred in (1) admitting a prior statement by the decedent; (2) barring evidence regarding an alleged confession; and (3) refusing to charge the jury on the law of mere association and mere suspicion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn January 15, 2001, Phillip Lee, Jr., a student of Benedict College and a reputed gang member of the Crips, was gunned down on Benedictâ€™s campus.Â  Brothers Lucius and Dushun Staten were indicted for the offenses of murder and lynching in the first degree for this crime.Â  They were tried together in 2002.Â  The jury found Dushun and Lucius guilty of lynching in the first degree, but only Dushun guilty of murder.[1]Â  The trial court sentenced Lucius to fifteen years, suspended upon the service of eight years for lynching.Â  The court sentenced Dushun to thirty years for murder and ten years for lynching, to run concurrently.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, Op. No. 3900 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 6, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 47 at 74).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The appellate court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of evidence will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion or the commission of legal error that results in prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 606 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2004); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe appellate court should examine the record to determine whether there is any evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  See Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  If there is any evidence in the record, the appellate court should affirm.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Statement Made by the Decedent\r\nDushun claims the trial court erred in admitting Andrew Brittâ€™s testimony that Lee told him that Dushun pulled a gun on him shortly prior to the incident.Â  We disagree.\r\nAndrew Britt, Leeâ€™s cousin and Benedict roommate, testified that on the evening before the shooting, Lee, normally a â€œvery calm,â€ â€œlaid back kind of person,â€ arrived in his dorm room â€œvery hysterical and like scared.â€Â  Britt asked: â€œPhil, whatâ€™s wrong with you?â€Â  Though Lee avoided answering Brittâ€™s questions for a while, Lee eventually confessed that â€œthey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€Â  When Britt asked who â€œpulledâ€ the gun on him, Lee declared: â€œThe niggers we had a[n] argument with on Saturday.â€[2]\r\nDushun timely objected to this testimony based on the hearsay rule, but the trial court overruled the objection.Â  Later, on cross-examination by Luciusâ€™s attorney, Britt stated that Lee actually said, â€œThe small kid pulled out a gun and asked . . . whatâ€™s up now.â€Â  Britt believed Lee was specifically referring to the â€œlittle brother,â€ Dushun.\r\nA.Â  Efficacy of Crawford v. Washington[3]\r\nThe Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment guarantees an accused the right â€œto be confronted with the witnesses against himâ€ in a criminal prosecution.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  The provision is applicable to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965).Â  The South Carolina constitution provides the same protection to a defendant.Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.\r\nThe right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and ensures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â  California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970); State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Confrontation Clause guarantees the accused the right to confront those testifying against him in court and further defines the scope of the admissibility of statements against him made by witnesses out-of-court.Â  See Coy v. Iowa, 487 U.S. 1012 (1988).Â  A defendant exercises his right of confrontation through cross-examination, which has been described as the â€œgreatest legal engine ever invented for the discovery of truth.â€Â  Green, 399 U.S. at 158 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nFor nearly twenty-five years, the question of whether an unavailable witnessâ€™s prior statements could be used against a criminal defendant at trial was governed by Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980):\r\n\r\n[W]hen a hearsay declarant is not present for cross-examination at trial, the Confrontation Clause normally requires a showing that he is unavailable.Â  Even then, his statement is admissible only if it bears adequate â€œindicia of reliability.â€Â  Reliability can be inferred without more in a case where the evidence falls within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  In other cases, the evidence must be excluded, at least absent a showing of particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nId. at 66.Â  Thus, under Roberts, an unavailable witnessâ€™s out-of-court statement was admissible if it: (1) fell within a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule; or (2) contained such particularized guarantees of trustworthiness that adversarial testing of the statement through cross-examination would add little to the assessment of the reliability of the evidence.\r\nIn March 2004, the Supreme Court concluded that the long-standing Roberts rule was untenable.Â  The Court, in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), announced a new test to determine the admissibility under the Confrontation Clause of hearsay offered against the accused.Â  Crawford was convicted of assault and attempted murder.Â  Over his confrontation objection, the prosecution was allowed to offer a recorded statement his wife made to the police in which she appeared to contradict Crawfordâ€™s claim that he attacked the victim in self-defense. Because the wife herself was under suspicion of facilitating the assault, her statement was admitted for its truth under Washingtonâ€™s hearsay exception for declarations against penal interest.Â  This exception required the prosecution to show that the declarant was unavailable to testify, and due to that unavailability, Crawford did not have an opportunity to cross-examine his wife about her out-of-court statement. The Court reversed Crawfordâ€™s conviction.Â  Crawford changes the Courtâ€™s previous confrontation analysis.\r\n Crawford traced the development of Confrontation Clause jurisprudence, beginning with English common law and extending to recent decisions made by state and federal courts throughout the country.Â  As a threshold matter, the Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis identified the â€œprincipal evilâ€ which the Confrontation Clause was intended to deter, â€œthe civil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1363.Â  The Court rejected the view that the regulation of out-of-court statements could be accomplished solely by the rules of evidence.Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364.\r\nThe Crawford Court clarified the Confrontation Clause â€œapplies to â€˜witnessesâ€™ against the accusedâ€”in other words, those who â€˜bear testimony.â€™â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  â€œTestimonyâ€ is typically a solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.â€Â  Id. (internal quotations omitted).Â  â€œAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.Â  Id.\r\nWith respect to testimonial hearsay, at least, the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision in Roberts to maintain consistency with the Framersâ€™ intent.Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1374; see also Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185, 216 (2004) (â€œIn Crawford v. Washington, the United States Supreme Court finally overruled Ohio v. Roberts, divorcing the Confrontation Clause and the hearsay rule because of an irreconcilable breakdown of the relationship.â€) (footnotes omitted).Â  The unpardonable vice of the Roberts test is â€œits demonstrated capacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1371.Â  The Court concluded:\r\n\r\nWhere nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framersâ€™ design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay law--as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.Â  Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.\r\nIn rejecting the Roberts â€œindicia of reliabilityâ€ test, the Court held that the Sixth Amendment bars an out-of-court statement by a witness that is testimonial in nature unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  â€œWhere testimonial statements are at issue, the only indicium of reliability sufficient to satisfy constitutional demands is the one the Constitution actually prescribes: confrontation.â€Â  Id. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  â€œFor testimonial statements, the Court figuratively erected a â€˜stop signâ€™ as to admissibility in the absence of confrontation.â€Â  Robert P. Mosteller, Crawford v. Washington: Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 525 (2005).Â  â€œFor statements in this category, [Crawford] firmly rejected the â€˜reliabilityâ€™ or â€˜trustworthinessâ€™ mode of analysis adopted by Ohio v. Roberts.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Court decided to â€œleave for another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of â€˜testimonial.â€™â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  However, the Court provided three â€œformulations of [the] core class of testimonial statementsâ€:\r\n\r\nVarious formulations of this core class of â€œtestimonialâ€ statements exist: â€œex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent--that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutoriallyâ€; â€œextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessionsâ€; â€œstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€ . . . .\r\nStatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.\r\n\r\nId. at Â Â Â , 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citations omitted).Â  Although the Court declined to settle on a single formulation, it noted: â€œWhatever else the term covers, it applies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.Â  These are the modern practices with closest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.â€Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  In contrast to these examples, casual statements to an acquaintance are not testimonial.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  Further, business records or statements in furtherance of a conspiracy are nontestimonial.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1367.\r\nB.Â  Testimonial vs. Nontestimonial\r\nIn the wake of the Crawford decision, the crucial inquiry is whether a particular statement is testimonial or nontestimonial.Â  Many courts are grappling with the distinction Crawford created between testimonial and nontestimonial hearsay.Â  See United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004); United States v. Corley, 348 F. Supp. 2d 970 (N.D.Ind. 2004); Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185 (2004).Â  â€œIn determining whether a statement is testimonial or non-testimonial, courts are consistently applying the Crawford two-pronged analysis to otherwise admissible hearsay statements: (1) Was the statement made to a governmental agent (or in response to questioning from a governmental agent)? (2) Would the declarant expect his/her statement to later be used at trial?â€Â  Allie Phillips, A Flurry of Court Interpretations: Weathering the Storm after Crawford v. Washington, 38-Dec Prosecutor 37 (Nov/Dec 2004).\r\n1.Â  Testimonial Statements\r\nCourts are attempting to define the types of hearsay that constitute testimonial statements.Â  The Colorado Court of Appeals explained that testimonial statements under Crawford will generally be (1) solemn or formal statements (not casual or off-hand remarks); (2) made for the purpose of proving or establishing facts in judicial proceedings (not for business or personal purposes); (3) to a government actor or agent (not to someone unassociated with government activity).Â  People v. Compan, 100 P.3d 533 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Oct. 25, 2004).Â  â€œ[S]tatements cited by the [Crawford] Court as testimonial share certain characteristics; all involve a declarantâ€™s knowing responses to structured questioning in an investigative environment or a courtroom setting where the declarant would reasonably expect that his or her responses might be used in future judicial proceedings.â€Â  United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 228 (2d Cir. 2004); see also United States v. Saner, 313 F. Supp. 2d 896 (S.D.Ind. 2004) (holding statements made in response to questioning outside of the courtroom by Department of Justice prosecutor were testimonial).Â  The Supreme Court of Georgia, in Moody v. State, 594 S.E.2d 350 (Ga. 2004), held that â€œpolice interrogations,â€ as delineated in Crawford as testimonial, include the field investigation of witnesses shortly after the commission of a crime.Â  Id. at 354 n.6; cf. Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial Dist. Court of Nevada, 124 S.Ct. 2451, 2463 (2004) (Stevens, J., dissenting) (â€œSurely police questioning during a Terry stop qualifies as an interrogation, and it follows that responses to such questions are testimonial in nature.â€).\r\nUnited States v. Cromer, 389 F.3d 662, 675 (6th Cir. 2004), found that â€œ[a] statement made knowingly to the authorities that describes criminal activity is almost always testimonialâ€ and thus concluded that the confidential informantâ€™s statement to the police wherein the CI implicated the defendant in criminal activity constituted testimonial hearsay.Â  The Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals further noted that statements made to the authorities, who will use them in investigating and prosecuting a crime, made with the full understanding that the statements will be so used, are testimonial.\r\nâ€œIf an out-of-court statement is taken by a government agent (police officer, prosecutor, child protective services worker employed by the state), the statement will be considered testimonial so long as the witness reasonably could expect that statement to be used at a later trial.â€Â  Phillips, 38-Dec Prosecutor at 37.\r\nIn United States v. Nielsen, 371 F.3d 574 (9th Cir. 2004), the defendantâ€™s girlfriend made statements to the police that incriminated the defendant during the service of a search warrant at their mutual residence.Â  The police asked the girlfriend who had access to the floor safe where the methamphetamine was found.Â  She replied that the defendant did.Â  The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals found the statements were testimonial.\r\nUnited States v. McClain, 377 F.3d 219 (2d Cir. 2004), discussed the testimonial aspect of a plea allocution: â€œIn light of [the] examples cited by the [Crawford] Court as testimonial, it is clear that a plea allocution constitutes testimony, as it is formally given in court, under oath, and in response to questions by the court or the prosecutor.â€Â  Id. at 221; see also People v. Woods, 779 N.Y.S.2d 494 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) (finding that admission of robbery accompliceâ€™s plea allocution into evidence, following accompliceâ€™s refusal to testify on constitutional grounds, violated defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment confrontation rights because plea allocutions are among the core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude).\r\nCity of Las Vegas v. Walsh, 91 P.3d 591 (Nev. 2004), recognized that an affidavit prepared by a registered nurse, in connection with the drawing of blood for use in evidence regarding intoxication, was testimonial, despite the nurseâ€™s apparent private status.Â  The Supreme Court of Nevada emphasized that such an affidavit is â€œprepared solely for the prosecutionâ€™s use at trial.â€Â  Id. at 595.\r\n2.Â  Nontestimonial Statements\r\nCourts are beginning to formulate case law defining what nontestimonial statements entail.Â  â€œ[S]tatements made to family, friends, and acquaintances without an intention for use at trial have consistently been held not to be testimonial, even if highly incriminating to another.â€Â  Robert P. Mosteller, Crawford v. Washington: Encouraging and Ensuring the Confrontation of Witnesses, 39 U. Rich. L. Rev. 511, 540 (2005).Â  Private conversations between confidants have been found to be nontestimonial.\r\nIn United States v. Manfre, 368 F.3d 832, 838 n.1 (8th Cir. 2004), the Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Crawford was inapplicable because the statements â€œwere made to loved ones or acquaintances and are not the kind of memorialized, judicial-process-created evidence of which Crawford speaks.â€\r\nState v. Blackstock, 598 S.E.2d 412 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004), involved extended statements made by a victim fatally shot during a robbery to his wife and daughter while in the hospital.Â  The Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluded the statements were nontestimonial.Â  The statements were made during personal conversations that took place at the hospital over a series of several days after the shooting and at a time when the victimâ€™s physical condition was improving and therefore would not have been anticipated by him to be used prosecutorially.\r\nIn State v. Rivera, 844 A.2d 191 (Conn. 2004), an unavailable declarantâ€™s statement to his nephew, admitting his participation with defendant in a burglary that had given rise to a homicide, was found to be nontestimonial because it failed under the most expansive test articulated by Crawford: an objective witness would not reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.Â  The declarant made the statement in confidence and on his own initiative to a close family member, almost eighteen months before the defendant was arrested and more than four years before his own arrest.Â  The Supreme Court of Connecticut held: â€œIn light of these circumstances, [the declarantâ€™s] communication to . . . his nephew clearly does not fall within the core category of ex parte testimonial statements that the court was concerned with in Crawford.â€Â  Id. at 202.\r\nIn People v. Shepherd, 689 N.W.2d 721 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004), the codefendant had made spontaneous, unprompted statements to his relatives about his role in an offense.Â  The statements were made in a custodial setting and were overheard by jail guards.Â  The Court of Appeals of Michigan explained the statements were not testimonial in nature, stating the declarant could not have reasonably believed that the statements would later be used at a trial.\r\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia, in Demons v. State, 595 S.E.2d 76 (Ga. 2004), articulated that a murder victimâ€™s statements to his friend, made during an incident involving the defendant several weeks prior to the murder, to the effect that the defendant was going to kill him, were not testimonial in nature.Â  Thereafter, the court addressed a similar issue in Watson v. State, 604 S.E.2d 804 (Ga. 2004), and found statements that an alleged murder victim made to three close friends over approximately ten years were not testimonial.Â  The statements concerned threats by the defendant and episodes of physical and mental abuse.\r\nIn People v. Cervantes, 12 Cal. Rptr. 3d 774 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), evidence of one defendantâ€™s incriminating hearsay statement, which also implicated codefendants in a murder prosecution, was nontestimonial.Â  The declarant made the statement to a friend of long standing in the context of a request for medical assistance from the friend, and, given that the friend was afraid to testify since she knew that all the defendants were gang members, the statement was made without any reasonable expectation that it would be used at a later trial.\r\nIn People v. Griffin, 93 P.3d 344, 369 (Cal. 2004), the Supreme Court of California held a child murder victimâ€™s statement to a school friend made on the day that the crime occurred that the â€œdefendant had been fondling her for some time and that [the victim] intended to confront him if he continuedâ€ was not testimonial.\r\nThe Court of Criminal Appeals of Texas, in Woods v. State, 152 S.W.3d 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), analyzed the co-defendantâ€™s out-of-court statements to two acquaintances, indicating his involvement in murders with the defendant.Â  The court recognized the statements were casual remarks that he spontaneously made to acquaintances.Â  They were â€œstreet cornerâ€ statements that the co-defendant made to friends without any motive to shift blame to another or minimize his own involvement in the murders. Â The court found the statements were nontestimonial in nature.\r\nIn People v. Compan, 100 P.3d 533 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Oct. 25, 2004), the Colorado Court of Appeals concluded that statements of a non-testifying domestic violence victim to her friend immediately after the attack did not qualify as testimonial.Â  Subsequently, the court decided People v. Garrison, No. 01CA0527, 2004 WL 2278287 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Garrison, the court determined the murder victimâ€™s hearsay statements to his training manager that â€œan old friendâ€ was threatening to kill him were not testimonial. Thus, admission of the statements did not violate the defendantâ€™s right of confrontation.Â  The statements were not made to the police, and there was no indication that the training manager was acting as a police agent.\r\nHorton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2004), amplified that a statement, admitted under the state of mind hearsay exception, that on the day of the murders defendantâ€™s accomplice had told a witness that he needed money and that the victim had refused to give him drugs on credit, was nontestimonial.Â  The First Circuit Court of Appeals emphasized the accompliceâ€™s statements were made during a private conversation with the witness.Â  â€œIn short, [the accomplice] did not make the statements under circumstances in which an objective person would â€˜reasonably believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id. at 84.\r\nParle v. Runnels, 387 F.3d 1030 (9th Cir. 2004), clarified that an unavailable declarantâ€™s diary entries were nontestimonial.Â  The diary â€œwas not created â€˜under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that [it] would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id. at 1037.\r\nUnited States v. Hendricks, 395 F.3d 173 (3d Cir. 2005), expounded that surreptitiously monitored private conversations and statements contained in Title III wiretap recordings are not â€œtestimonial statementsâ€ for purposes of Crawford.Â  The Third Circuit Court of Appeals noted: (1) the recorded conversations neither fell within nor were analogous to any of the specific examples of testimonial statements mentioned by the Crawford Court; (2) each of the examples referred to by the Crawford Court or the definitions it considered entails a formality to the statement absent from the recorded statements in Hendricks; (3) the Title III recordings cannot be deemed testimonial as the speakers certainly did not make the statements thinking that they would be available for use at a later trial; and (4) the very purpose of Title III intercepts is to capture conversations that the participants believe are not being heard by the authorities and will not be available for use in a prosecution.\r\nThe status of 911 calls has been addressed by the courts.Â  In People v. Moscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d 875 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004), the court determined that a 911 call is not testimonial because it is typically initiated by the witness looking for assistance rather than by the police summoning a witness to provide evidence.Â  People v. Conyers, 777 N.Y.S.2d 274, 277 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004), held that a callerâ€™s statements were nontestimonial because her â€œintention in placing the 911 calls was to stop the assault in progress and not to consider the legal ramifications of herself as a witness in a future proceeding.â€Â  Cf. People v. Cortes, 781 N.Y.S.2d 401, 415 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 2004) (reasoning that statements about an ongoing shooting made by a witness during a 911 call amounted to testimonial evidence because the information was elicited by 911 operatorâ€™s use of an accepted pattern of questioning for the purpose of investigation, prosecution, and potential use at judicial proceedings; â€œan objective reasonable person knows that when he or she reports a crime the statement will be used in an investigation and at proceedings relating to a prosecution.â€).\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Washington, in State v. Powers, 99 P.3d 1262 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004), rejected a bright line rule that all 911 recordings are nontestimonial, opting instead to employ a case-by-case analysis into whether statements contained on a 911 recording originated from interrogation.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Minnesota concluded statements made by the victims during their 911 call were not testimonial statements and, thus, were admissible in the assault trial despite the victimsâ€™ unavailability at trial and the defendantâ€™s lack of prior opportunity to cross-examine the victims.Â  State v. Wright, 686 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004), review granted (Nov. 23, 2004).Â  The statements in Wright were made moments after the assault while the victims were struggling for self-control and survival, no evidence suggested the call was handled by the 911 operator under formalized protocol, and the victims were providing information for immediate intervention and not for eventual prosecution.Â  Wright inculcated:\r\n\r\n[T]hese statements do not fit within the definitions or the examples of testimonial statements.Â  A 911 call is usually made because the caller wants protection from an immediate danger, not because the 911 caller expects the report to be used later at trial with the caller bearing witnessâ€”rather, there is a cloak of anonymity surrounding 911 calls that encourages citizens to make emergency calls and not fear repercussion.\r\n\r\nId. at 302.\r\nA number of courts have found that statements made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment are nontestimonial.Â  In State v. Vaught, 682 N.W.2d 284 (Neb. 2004), a four-year-old victim of sexual abuse informed a physician during a medical examination about the identity of the defendant.Â  The Supreme Court of Nebraska decided the statements by the child to the physician were nontestimonial.Â  The court explicated:\r\n\r\n[T]he victimâ€™s identification of Vaught as the perpetrator was a statement made for the purpose of medical diagnosis or treatment.Â  In the present case, the victim was taken to the hospital by her family to be examined and the only evidence regarding the purpose of the medical examination, including the information regarding the cause of the symptoms, was to obtain medical treatment.Â  There was no indication of a purpose to develop testimony for trial, nor was there an indication of government involvement in the initiation or course of the examination.\r\n\r\nId. at 291.Â  In State v. Scacchetti, 690 N.W.2d 393 (Minn. Ct. App. 2005), the Court of Appeals of Minnesota ruled a three-year-old victimâ€™s out-of-court statements to her examining physician that defendantâ€™s penis touched her vaginal and anal openings, together with videotaped statements during her conversation with the physician that defendant put his hands â€œright in there,â€ referring to her anal opening, were not testimonial.Â  Admission of the statements in a criminal sexual conduct trial did not violate the defendantâ€™s right of confrontation where they were made in response to questions by the physician for purposes of medical diagnosis and the physician was not working on behalf of law enforcement for the purpose of developing a case against the defendant.\r\nIn re T.T., 815 N.E.2d 789 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004), reasoned that a victimâ€™s statements to medical personnel regarding descriptions of the cause of symptoms, pain or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereof are not testimonial in nature where such statements do not accuse or identify the perpetrator of the assault.\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Michigan concluded admission of the child victimâ€™s statement through the testimony of the executive director of the local Childrenâ€™s Assessment Center, a private organization, did not violate the defendantâ€™s right to confront his accuser in a trial for criminal sexual conduct.Â  People v. Geno, 683 N.W.2d 687 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004).Â  The statement did not constitute testimonial evidence, as it was not made to a government employee, and the childâ€™s answer to the question whether she had an â€œowieâ€ was not a statement in the nature of ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent.Â  Id.\r\nCourts have discussed the nontestimonial nature of various reports.Â  The Court of Criminal Appeals of Alabama held an autopsy report showing the cause of death of a homicide victim was not testimonial.Â  Perkins v. State, CR-02-1779, 2004 WL 923506 (Ala. Crim. App. 2004).Â  The Supreme Court of New Mexico, in State v. Dedman, 102 P.3d 628 (N.M. 2004), declared a blood alcohol report showing the defendantâ€™s blood alcohol level at the time of the vehicle accident was nontestimonial for purposes of determining whether admission of the report, without testimony of the nurse who drew the blood sample, violated the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confrontation in a prosecution for aggravated driving while under the influence of intoxicating drugs.Â  The report was generated by State laboratory personnel, not law enforcement, and the report was not investigative or prosecutorial.\r\nCo-conspirator statements have been found to be nontestimonial.Â  See, e.g., United States v. Reyes, 362 F.3d 536 (8th Cir. 2004) (stating that Crawford does not apply to co-conspirator statements because they are nontestimonial).Â  In United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223 (2d Cir. 2004), the Second Circuit Court of Appeals determined a co-conspiratorâ€™s statements against the defendant to a confidential informant, whose true status was unknown to the co-conspirator, were not testimonial.Â  Noting Crawfordâ€™s specific caveat that it only pertains to testimonial statements, the court pointed out that the co-conspirator had no knowledge of the confidential informantâ€™s connection to investigators and believed that he was having a casual conversation with a friend and potential co-conspirator.Â  Id.Â  In fact, all circuits that have considered this issue with respect to co-conspirators have reached a similar conclusion.Â  See, e.g., Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75 (1st Cir. 2004); United States v. Lee, 374 F.3d 637 (8th Cir. 2004); People v. Cook, 815 N.E.2d 879 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004); Thomas J. Reed, Crawford v. Washington and the Irretrievable Breakdown of a Union: Separating the Confrontation Clause from the Hearsay Rule, 56 S.C. L. Rev. 185 (2004); see also Williams v. SCI-Huntingdon, No. Civ.A. 02-CV-7693, 2004 WL 2203734, at *11 n.7 (E.D.Pa. Sept. 30, 2004) (â€œâ€˜an off-hand, overheard remarkâ€™ to an acquaintance, such as . . . one made by [a] co-conspirator . . ., is outside the scope of Crawford and thus does not violate the Confrontation Clause.â€).\r\nSome courts have examined what encompasses â€œinterrogationâ€ within the meaning of Crawford.Â  In Fowler v. State, 809 N.E.2d 960 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), transfer granted (Dec. 9, 2004), the Court of Appeals of Indiana ruled that when police arrive at the scene of an incident in response to a request for assistance and begin informally questioning those nearby immediately thereafter in order to determine what has happened, statements given in response thereto are not testimonial.Â  The court observed that what constitutes a testimonial statement is the official and formal quality of such a statement.Â  The court noted that Crawford chose not to say that any police questioning of a witness would make a statement in response thereto testimonial.Â  Rather, Crawford expressly limited its holding to police â€œinterrogation.â€Â  The court stated: â€œWhatever else police â€˜interrogationâ€™ might be, we do not believe that word applies to preliminary investigatory questions asked at the scene of a crime shortly after it has occurred.â€Â  Id. at 964.\r\nIn People v. Corella, 18 Cal. Rptr. 3d 770, 776 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), the California Court of Appeal illuminated:\r\n\r\nPreliminary questions asked at the scene of a crime shortly after it has occurred do not rise to the level of an â€œinterrogation.â€Â  Such an unstructured interaction between officer and witness bears no resemblance to a formal or informal police inquiry that is required for a police interrogation [that results in inadmissible testimonial hearsay].\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Maine, in State v. Barnes, 854 A.2d 208 (Me. 2004), found to be nontestimonial statements that were made by the murder defendantâ€™s mother (the victim) to police officers at the station house where she went after an earlier assault by her son.Â  The interaction did not involve structured police interrogation triggering the cross-examination requirement of the Confrontation Clause in admitting the officerâ€™s testimony regarding the motherâ€™s statements.Â  The mother went to the police station on her own, her statements to the officers were made when she was still under the stress of the alleged assault by the defendant, and officers were not questioning her regarding known criminal activity.\r\nIn State v. Forrest, 596 S.E.2d 22 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004), the Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluded a crime victimâ€™s statements to an officer made shortly after she was rescued from a kidnapping and assault by the police were not testimonial.Â  The statements were made immediately after the rescue and with no time for reflection or thought on the victimâ€™s part and were initiated spontaneously by the victim.Â  The victim was not (1) providing a formal statement, deposition, or affidavit; (2) aware she was bearing witness; or (3) aware her utterances might impact further legal proceedings.Â  Id. at 27; see also People v. Newland, 775 N.Y.S.2d 308, 309 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004) (â€œ[A] brief, informal remark to an officer conducting a field investigation, not made in response to â€˜structured police questioningâ€™ should not be considered testimonial.â€); People v. Mackey, 785 N.Y.S.2d 870 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004) (stating responses to police officers during a preliminary field investigation are not barred as testimonial statements under Crawford if the statements and the circumstances in which they were made lack the requisite formality to constitute a police interrogation).\r\nVarious jurisdictions have addressed the status of excited utterances as nontestimonial.Â  In People v. King, No. 02CA0201, 2005 WL 170727, at *5 (Colo. Ct. App., Jan 27, 2005), the Colorado Court of Appeals elucidated:\r\n\r\n[C]lassification of a statement as an excited utterance, while not dispositive, supports a conclusion that a statement is nontestimonial.Â  An excited utterance by definition is one made before the declarant has had an opportunity to reflect on the event.Â  Therefore, it is consistent with the definition of an excited utterance to conclude that it is not a statement which a declarant would reasonably believe at the time it was made might later be used at trial.\r\n\r\nIn Hammon v. State, 809 N.E.2d 945 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), transfer granted (Dec. 9, 2004), the victim made a number of excited utterances to police officers at the scene of the crime, in response to preliminary police questions.Â  In concluding these excited utterances did not constitute testimonial statements, the Court of Appeals of Indiana declared:\r\n\r\n[T]he very concept of an â€œexcited utteranceâ€ is such that it is difficult to perceive how such a statement could ever be â€œtestimonial.â€Â  The underlying rationale of the excited utterance exception is that such a declaration from one who has recently suffered an overpowering experience is likely to be truthful. . . . An unrehearsed statement made without time for reflection or deliberation, as required to be an excited utterance, is not â€œtestimonialâ€ in that such a statement, by definition, has not been made in contemplation of its use in a future trial.\r\n\r\nId. at 952-53 (citations omitted).\r\nA number of courts dealing with excited utterances have taken the approach of analyzing the intent of the declarant and determining whether the recipient of the excited utterance questions the declarant.Â  See Allie Phillips, A Flurry of Court Interpretations: Weathering the Storm after Crawford v. Washington, 38-Dec Prosecutor 37 (Nov/Dec 2004).Â  For example, if a declarant provides an excited utterance that is simply a cry for help or for medical treatment, and if the witness would not reasonably expect the statement to be used in a prosecutorial manner at the time the utterance is made, then those utterances are being declared nontestimonial and are subject to a traditional hearsay analysis.Â  See, e.g., People v. Moscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d 875 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004); State v. Forrest, 596 S.E.2d 22 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004); State v. Orndorff, 95 P.3d 406 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004).Â  However, if a declarant provides an excited utterance that could reasonably be expected to be used at a later trial (such as reporting a crime), or if a statement is made in response to questioning by a 911 operator, those utterances are being declared testimonial and will require the witness to testify.Â  Phillips, 38-Dec Prosecutor at 41.\r\nC.Â  Status of Leeâ€™s Statements under Crawford\r\nThe analysis of whether the admission of Leeâ€™s statements violated the Confrontation Clause begins with the question of whether the statements are testimonial, triggering Crawfordâ€™s per se rule against their admission.Â  In this case, Leeâ€™s statements were not: (1) ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent; (2) extrajudicial statements contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony transcripts, or confessions; or (3) taken by police officers in the course of an interrogation.Â  Rather, Leeâ€™s statements were made during a private conversation with his cousin and roommate, Britt.Â  See Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (â€œAn accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.â€).Â  Significantly, the decedent did not make the statements â€œâ€˜under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  Concomitantly, Leeâ€™s statements do not qualify as testimonial.\r\nLeeâ€™s statements are nontestimonial.Â  Consequently, their admission is outside of Crawfordâ€™s scope.Â  See Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.\r\nD.Â  Applicability of Ohio v. Roberts\r\nâ€œJustice Scaliaâ€™s opinion [in Crawford] hints, but does not decide, that the Confrontation Clause no longer applies to non-testimonial hearsay, and that its admission is governed by a jurisdictionâ€™s hearsay rulesâ€ and Robertsâ€™ â€œindicia of reliabilityâ€ approach.Â  David F. Binder, Hearsay Handbook Â§ 7:2 (4th ed. 2004).Â  Most jurisdictions are leaning toward the idea that â€œCrawford [left] the Roberts approach untouched with respect to nontestimonial statements.â€Â  United States v. Saget, 377 F.3d 223, 227 (2d Cir. 2004); see also Horton v. Allen, 370 F.3d 75, 84 (1st Cir. 2004) (â€œThus, unless Christianâ€™s statements qualify as â€˜testimonial,â€™ Crawford is inapplicable and Roberts continues to apply.â€); State v. Manuel, 685 N.W.2d 525, 533 (Wis. Ct. App. 2004), review granted, 689 N.W.2d 55 (Wis. 2004) (â€œ[W]e proceed, in an abundance of caution, to analyze Manuelâ€™s confrontation clause claim under the Roberts analysisâ€).\r\nBecause nontestimonial hearsay is at issue here, we apply the reliability test of Roberts to determine whether the admission of Leeâ€™s hearsay statements violated Dushunâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights.\r\nUnder Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), for the statement to be admissible, the declarant must be unavailable, and the statement must fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception or bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  Obviously, Leeâ€™s death rendered him unavailable to testify.Â  Therefore, we examine whether Leeâ€™s statements fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE; see also State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 558, 575 S.E.2d 77, 81 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œEvidence is not hearsay unless it is an out of court statement offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€).Â  The rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an out-of-court statement to prove the truth of the matter asserted unless an exception to the rule applies.Â  See Huggler v. State, 360 S.C. 627, 602 S.E.2d 753 (2004); State v. Weaver, 361 S.C. 73, 602 S.E.2d 786 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Rule 802, SCRE (â€œHearsay is not admissible except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State or by statute.â€); Rule 803, SCRE (setting out exceptions to the hearsay rule).\r\nOne exception to the hearsay rule is an excited utterance.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  An excited utterance is a â€œstatement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€Â  Id.Â  A statement that is admissible because it falls within an exception in Rule 803, such as the excited utterance exception, may be used substantively, that is, to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 558 S.E.2d 518&nbsp;(2002); State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999).\r\nâ€œThe rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 20, 558 S.E.2d at 521; see also State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001) (stating the basis for the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule is that the perceived event produces nervous excitement, making fabrication of the statements about the event unlikely).Â  An excited utterance expresses the real belief of the speaker because the utterance is made under the immediate and uncontrolled domination of the senses, rather than under reason and reflection.Â  McHoney, 344 S.C. at 94, 544 S.E.2d at 34.Â  In deciding whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception, a court must consider the totality of the circumstances.Â  Id.Â  Such a determination is left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521; State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999).\r\nâ€œThree elements must be met to find the statement [is] an excited utterance.â€Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  First, the statement must relate to a startling event or condition.Â  Id.Â  Second, the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement.Â  Id.Â  Third, the stress of excitement must be caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Id. (citing Rule 803(2), SCRE).Â  Other factors useful in determining whether a statement qualifies as an excited utterance include the declarantâ€™s demeanor, the declarantâ€™s age, and the severity of the startling event.Â  Id. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.\r\nThe statements here clearly meet the first element because they relate to the startling event of Lee having a gun â€œpulledâ€ on him.Â  As for whether Lee was â€œunder the stress of excitementâ€ when he made the statements, we note that the amount of time that passed between the startling event and the time the statement was made is one of several factors to consider when deciding whether a statement is an excited utterance.Â  Id. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  While the passage of time between the startling event and the statement is one factor to consider, it is not the dispositive factor.Â  Id.Â  Even statements after extended periods of time can be considered an excited utterance as long as they were made under continuing stress.Â  Id. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  Lee, normally a â€œcalm, humble, laid back kind of person,â€ was described by Britt as being â€œstorm, angry, storm, angry, just temper-high kind of person when he came in the roomâ€ on the Sunday evening before the shooting.Â  Britt testified that Lee â€œjust kept walking back, walking back and forth in the room.Â  Just like . . . banging on stuff.â€Â  When asked what had happened, Lee replied: â€œThey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€ (emphasis added).Â  Leeâ€™s demeanor and the severity of the startling event are factors that weigh in favor of finding his statements to be excited utterances.Â  Finally, the third element is satisfied.Â  The â€œstress of excitementâ€ was caused by the â€œstartling eventâ€ of Lee having a gun â€œpulledâ€ on him.\r\nMoreover, the fact that the statements were made in regard to questioning by Britt does not preclude their admissibility.Â  See United States v. Iron Shell, 633 F.2d 77 (8th Cir. 1980) (noting the single question, â€œwhat happened,â€ has been held not to destroy the excitement necessary to qualify under excited utterance exception to hearsay rule); United States v. Glenn, 473 F.2d 191 (D.C. Cir. 1972) (stating fact that excited utterance is made in response to inquiry is not decisive on issue of admissibility).\r\nGiven the totality of the circumstances, we find Lee was under the continuing stress of excitement when he told Britt â€œthey just pulled a . . . gun on me.â€Â  When Britt asked who â€œpulledâ€ the gun on him, Lee declared: â€œThe niggers we had a[n] argument with on Saturday.â€Â  On cross-examination by Luciusâ€™s attorney, Britt stated that Lee actually said, â€œThe small kid pulled out a gun and asked . . . whatâ€™s up now.â€Â  Britt believed Lee was specifically referring to the â€œlittle brother,â€ Dushun.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting Leeâ€™s statements to Britt because the statements fall under the excited utterance hearsay exception.\r\nWe are not required to find any other guarantees of trustworthiness because the court will only look to this prong if a statement does not fall within a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  See State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999).Â  Leeâ€™s statements constitute excited utterances.Â  The United States Supreme Court has held that an excited utterance is a firmly rooted exception to the hearsay rule.Â  See White v. Illinois, 502 U.S. 346 (1992); see also State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 45, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999) (â€œexcited utterance exception is firmly rooted in South Carolina law and satisfies the requirements of the Confrontation Clauseâ€).\r\nThe admission of Leeâ€™s statements satisfies Roberts.Â  The trial court correctly admitted the hearsay statements.Â  Dushunâ€™s Confrontation Clause rights were not violated.[4]\r\nII.Â  Statement Against Penal Interest by Unavailable Witness\r\nDushun maintains the trial court erred in excluding Michelle Buffâ€™s testimony that Maurice Sanders told her he shot the decedent.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Relevance\r\nFor evidence to be admissible, it must be relevant.Â  Rules 401 &amp; 402, SCRE; State v. Sweat, 362 S.C. 117, 606 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Relevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE; State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 142, 591 S.E.2d 646, 651 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Under Rule 401, evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy.Â  In re Care and Treatment of Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 577 S.E.2d 451 (2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The admission or exclusion of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).\r\nPrior to the Statensâ€™ joint trial, the State stipulated that neither Lucius nor Dushun actually shot Lee.Â  The State declared: â€œ[W]e are proceeding on the theory of accomplice liability . . . . Whoever the shooter is is not relevant.â€Â  Buff, the girlfriend of Limel Sims, would testify that she took Maurice Sanders to the Benedict College area to look for the gun.Â  In her statement to police, she revealed that, when she took him to the bus station, Sanders confessed to shooting a man at Benedict College because â€œthe guy he shot and some of his friends had jumped him at the mall.â€Â  She added that Sims confirmed Sanders shot Lee.Â  The trial court ruled the test for trustworthiness of the statement was not met, and the identity of the shooter was unimportant for the State to prove its case for aiding and abetting murder.\r\nBuffâ€™s testimony was not relevant.Â  The trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding the evidence.\r\nB.Â  Analysis under Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE\r\nNontestimonial statements against the interest of the declarant at the time when made are admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable and the circumstances show that a reasonable person would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true.Â  See Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).Â  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE, provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe following are not excluded by the hearsay rule if the declarant is unavailable as a witness:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . .\r\n(3) Statement against interest.Â  A statement which was at the time of its making so far contrary to the declarantâ€™s pecuniary or proprietary interest, or so far tended to subject the declarant to civil or criminal liability, or to render invalid a claim by the declarant against another, that a reasonable person in the declarantâ€™s position would not have made the statement unless believing it to be true. . . . .\r\n\r\nThe declaration against penal interest exception has been applied to the determination of whether a third party committed the crime charged instead of the defendant in a criminal case.Â  See State v. Doctor, 306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992).Â  An abuse of discretion standard is applied to a trial judgeâ€™s ruling on the issue of whether a statement is admissible as a declaration against penal interest.Â  State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996).\r\nHowever, â€œ[a] statement tending to expose the declarant to criminal liability and offered to exculpate the accused is not admissible unless corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.â€Â  Rule 804(b)(3), SCRE; see also McClain v. Anderson Free Press, 232 S.C. 448, 468, 102 S.E.2d 750, 760 (1958) (Oxner, J., concurring).Â  A defendant seeking to offer a hearsay statement against interest bears the formidable burden of establishing that corroborating circumstances clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement.Â  State v. Wannamaker, 346 S.C. 495, 552 S.E.2d 284 (2001).Â  Exculpatory evidence that is not corroborated with other evidence that clearly shows its trustworthiness is excluded.Â  Forney, 321 S.C. at 359-60, 468 S.E.2d at 645; State v. McKnight, 321 S.C. 230, 467 S.E.2d 919 (1996).Â  Whether a statement has been sufficiently corroborated is a question left to the discretion of the trial judge after considering the totality of the circumstances under which a declaration against penal interest was made.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000); State v. Kinloch, 338 S.C. 385, 526 S.E.2d 705 (2000).\r\nRule 804(b)(3) does not require that the information within the statement be clearly corroborated, it means only that there be corroborating circumstances which clearly indicate the trustworthiness of the statement itself, i.e., that the statement was actually made.Â  Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389, 526 S.E.2d at 707.Â  The corroboration requirement â€œgoes not to the truth of the statementâ€™s contents, but rather to the making of the statement.â€Â  McDonald, 343 S.C. at 323, 540 S.E.2d at 466.Â  The corroboration requirement is a preliminary determination as to the statementâ€™s admissibility, not an ultimate determination about the statementâ€™s truth.Â  Kinloch, 338 S.C. at 389, 526 SE.2d at 707.\r\nIn State v. McKnight, evidence offered by a witness with a motive to testify against the alleged declarant was held not sufficiently trustworthy:\r\n\r\nFirst, the declarant in this case, Willie, was available to testify. . . . Moreover, Willie did not exercise any fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination.\r\nSecond, no corroborating evidence existed which clearly indicated the trustworthiness of Willieâ€™s statement against penal interest.Â  On the contrary, the evidence presented during the in camera hearing severely undermined that statementâ€™s trustworthiness.Â  Belser admitted that he felt Willie had wrongly put the blame on him for crimes actually committed by Willie. This statement suggested that Belser had a possible motive for attributing Chandlerâ€™s murder to Willie.Â  Belser also stated that when Willie confessed to the murder, he felt Willie was only joking.Â  Indeed, Willie himself admitted telling at least three different versions of his story at one time or another.\r\n\r\nId. at 234-35, 467 S.E.2d at 922.\r\nSanders was unavailable to testify due to the exercise of his Fifth Amendment rights.Â  Buff would testify that Sanders confessed to the murder, thereby exposing him to possible further criminal charges.Â  The only corroboration was from the eyewitness testimony of Brandon McCants, who testified that he saw Sanders shoot Lee, and Dushunâ€™s statement that he and Lucius withdrew.Â  However, McCants did not come forward with his information until two months after the incident, even though he was questioned by police much earlier; Dushun obviously had motive to lie; and, when arrested shortly after the shooting, Sanders tested negative for gunshot residue.Â  Lastly, but most importantly, Sims, Buffâ€™s boyfriend, was charged with the murder as well, and Buffâ€™s statement would exculpate him.Â  Therefore, she had motive to make up the story about Sandersâ€™ confession.\r\nBased on the totality of the circumstances, and because of the lack of corroboration and Buffâ€™s possible motivation to be untruthful, the trial court correctly excluded her testimony.Â  Dushun did not carry his burden of showing circumstances clearly corroborating the making of the statement.Â  See United States v. Salvador, 820 F.2d 558 (2d Cir. 1987) (stating inference of trustworthiness from proffered corroborating circumstances must be strong, not merely allowable, not an insignificant hurdle).Â  Moreover, the circumstances do not indicate that the statement was not fabricated.Â  See United States v. Bagley, 537 F.2d 162 (5th Cir. 1976) (excluding statement on basis of doubt as to whether it was made).Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s reasoning that, because the State conceded neither Staten brother was the shooter, showing Sanders as opposed to Sims was the shooter did nothing to aid the jury in its decision.Â  The trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to admit the testimony.\r\nIII.Â  Jury Charge\r\nDushun contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge mere association and mere suspicion.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe law to be charged must be determined from the evidence presented at trial.Â  State v. Knoten, 347 S.C. 296, 555 S.E.2d 391 (2001); State v. Cole, 338 S.C. 97, 525 S.E.2d 511 (2000).Â  The judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  A jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  Id. at 318, 577 S.E.2d at 464.Â  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant.Â  State v. Reese, 359 S.C. 260, 597 S.E.2d 169 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œFailure to give requested jury instructions is not prejudicial error where the instructions given afford the proper test for determining the issues.â€Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002).\r\nDushun requested a charge on mere presence and mere association before the charge was given, and then objected to the charge when he believed the trial court insufficiently presented the law on mere association to the jury.Â  Our supreme court, in State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998), held a charge to be sufficient though the trial court failed to charge mere presence and mere association.Â  The court ruled that â€œthe trial courtâ€™s charge was not misleading. . . . The trial judge extensively instructed the jury on the requisite criminal intent for each of the charged crimes.â€Â  Id. at 77, 502 S.E.2d at 76-77.\r\nIn the instant case, the trial courtâ€™s charge included the following law: â€œTo be liable as an accomplice, the defendants must have knowledge of the principalâ€™s criminal conduct.Â  Now, mere presence at the scene of the crime is not sufficient to establish â€“ to establish guilt as an accomplice.â€Â  The charge included a detailed instruction on aiding, abetting, or assisting the commission of the crime â€œthrough some overt act.â€Â  We find the trial courtâ€™s jury charge sufficiently covered the law on mere presence and knowledge.Â  The trial courtâ€™s charge on the whole, combined with the law on reasonable doubt and mere presence and knowledge, was proper.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s refusal to recharge the jury with Dushunâ€™s suggested additions was neither erroneous nor prejudicial to Dushun, as required by Burkhart.Â  See Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 263, 565 S.E.2d at 304.\r\nDushun never requested a charge on mere suspicion before the trial court actually administered the charge.Â  Furthermore, he did not request such an instruction after the trial court had charged the jury with the law.Â  The trial court did not have an opportunity to rule upon the objection.Â  See State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 513 S.E.2d 385 (Ct. App. 1999) (to preserve objection to jury charge, defendant must raise the issue at trial).Â  In addition, Rule 20(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure provides:\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any request for legal instructions, the parties shall be given the opportunity to object to the giving or failure to give an instruction before the jury retires, but out of the hearing of the jury.Â  Any objection shall state distinctly the matter objected to and the grounds for objection.Â  Failure to object in accordance with this rule shall constitute a waiver of objection.\r\n\r\nTherefore, the issue is not preserved for appeal.Â  Furthermore, although Lucius objected to the trial courtâ€™s alleged failure to include a charge on mere suspicion, an appellant may not preserve an issue for appeal by way of a co-defendantâ€™s objection.Â  See State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 555, 238 S.E.2d 678, 678 (1977) (â€œWhile appellantâ€™s co-defendant did object, the appellant may not utilize the objection of another defendant to gain review.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, Dushunâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The trial court declared a mistrial on Luciusâ€™s charge for murder.\r\n[2] Britt stated he was present when Lee and the Statens had a confrontation on the Saturday before the shooting.\r\n[3] 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004).\r\n[4] Dushun further claims the trial court erred in admitting the hearsay statements because they actually relate to a prior bad act, not an excited utterance involving â€œthe event.â€Â  However, this objection was not made at trial, and the trial court did not have an opportunity to rule upon the objection.Â  See State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (noting that, to be preserved for appellate review, issue must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court).Â  Therefore, the issue is not preserved for appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3956","title":"State v.

She was pointing [the rifle] at me and screaming and\r\nhollering and accusing me as usual.&nbsp; I asked her, â€œWhat the heck is wrong\r\nwith you, you know?&nbsp; There has not been another woman in this house.â€\r\nShe just kept on and on, screaming and screaming at\r\nme.&nbsp; I was afraid she was going to shoot me.&nbsp; So during the screaming\r\n- - and my living room is very small.&nbsp; Yâ€™all have seen that.&nbsp;\r\nBetween two couches is where this happened.\r\nThe only thing I remember, I did try - - I took my left\r\nhand to knock it away, try to push it away from me.&nbsp; Than [sic] after I\r\njerked it away from her, I did stumble back several feet, you know after jerking\r\nit.&nbsp; The weapon discharged but it was not intentionally.\r\nQ.&nbsp; Was that in your hands?\r\nA.&nbsp; It was in my hands.&nbsp; I do not deny that.\r\nQ.&nbsp; And you pulled the trigger?\r\nA.&nbsp; Not intentionally but I had to.\r\n. . . .\r\nQ.&nbsp; No one else pulled the trigger?\r\nA.&nbsp; There was nobody else holding the gun.&nbsp; I\r\nmean, letâ€™s be logical.&nbsp; It was just me and her there.&nbsp; But after I\r\njerked the weapon out of her hand, it . . .\r\nQ.&nbsp; And there has been testimony about whether yâ€™all\r\nwere standing erect, that is, straight up, flat footed face to face.&nbsp; I\r\ntake it you were not?\r\nA.&nbsp; Not in the heat of the moment.&nbsp; There is\r\nnobody, when you are arguing like that, nobody is going to be standing there\r\njust standing there. There is a lot of movement going on.\r\nQ.&nbsp; Did she back away from you?&nbsp; Did you back\r\naway from her?\r\nA.&nbsp; I went back from her after we was tussling with\r\nthe rifle.\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nDuring cross-examination, the following exchange occurred:\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nQ.&nbsp; You told the Texas Ranger this gun was in your\r\nhands exclusively when it went off, when you pulled the trigger.\r\nA.&nbsp; After we fought for the rifle and I got it out of\r\nher hands, it did discharge; and it was in my hands.&nbsp; I donâ€™t deny that.\r\n        \r\n\r\n        \r\nLightâ€™s attorney requested jury instructions on\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter and self-defense.&nbsp; At the conclusion of the\r\nevidence, the trial court denied the request and charged the jury on the law of\r\nmurder, voluntary manslaughter, and accident.&nbsp; The jury found Light guilty\r\nof murder.&nbsp; \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe evidence presented at trial determines the law to be\r\ncharged.&nbsp; State&nbsp;v. \r\n  White, 361 S.C. 407, 412, 605 S.E.2d 540, 542 (2004).&nbsp; The trial\r\ncourtâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury instruction must be both erroneous\r\nand prejudicial to warrant reversal.&nbsp; State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C.\r\n252, 263, 565 S.E.2d 298, 304 (2002).&nbsp; \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Involuntary Manslaughter\r\nLight argues the trial court erred in failing to charge\r\nthe jury on the law of involuntary manslaughter.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nâ€œA trial court should refuse to charge a lesser-included\r\noffense only where there is no evidence the defendant committed the lesser\r\nrather than the greater offense.â€&nbsp; State v. Chatman, 336 S.C. 149,\r\n152, 519 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1999).&nbsp; Involuntary manslaughter is the\r\nunintentional killing of another without malice while (1) engaged in an unlawful\r\nactivity that is not a felony and does not naturally tend to cause death or\r\ngreat bodily harm or (2) engaged in a lawful activity with a reckless disregard\r\nfor the safety of others.&nbsp; Bozeman v. State,  307\r\nS.C. 172, 176, 414 S.E.2d 144, 146-47 (1992).&nbsp; \r\nAccording to Lightâ€™s statements and testimony, he was in\r\nhis home when confronted by Davis, who was armed, accusatory, and angry.&nbsp;\r\nThus according to his version of events he was engaged in a lawful activity when\r\nhe took the rifle from her, arming himself in self-defense while disarming her. \r\n  [1] &nbsp; Because there is evidence he was engaged in a lawful activity,\r\nan involuntary manslaughter charge was proper only if he lacked malice and if he\r\nengaged in the lawful activity with reckless disregard for the safety of\r\nothers.&nbsp; The trial court refused to so charge the jury, concluding the\r\ntestimony did not support involuntary manslaughter because no evidence indicated\r\nrecklessness.&nbsp; We agree the evidence did not warrant a charge on\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter.&nbsp; Although Light gave conflicting statements and\r\ntestimony, none of his statements suggest he handled the gun with reckless\r\ndisregard for the safety of others.&nbsp; Instead, he maintained the discharge\r\nwas merely an accident.\r\nHowever, Light cites State v. Burris  and State v. Crosby \r\n to support his argument that an involuntary manslaughter charge is warranted\r\nwhere the accused is armed in self-defense and the gun discharges\r\naccidentally.&nbsp; Both cases are distinguishable.&nbsp; \r\nIn Burriss, the appellant appealed his murder\r\nconviction, arguing the trial court erred in refusing to charge accident and\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter to the jury.&nbsp; Viewed in the light most favorable\r\nto Burriss, the evidence showed two men attacked him, knocking him down and\r\nattempting to rob him.&nbsp; Burriss drew a gun from his pocket and shot twice\r\ninto the ground, causing both men to back away from him.&nbsp; While he was\r\nattempting to get off the ground, he saw one of the attackers reappear and the\r\nother begin advancing toward him.&nbsp; He picked up his gun again, but this\r\ntime it â€œwent off,â€ killing one of the attackers.&nbsp; State v. Burriss,\r\n334 S.C. 256, 258-59, 513 S.E.2d 104, 106 (1999).&nbsp; The trial court refused\r\nBurrissâ€™ requests for charges on accident and involuntary manslaughter, and on\r\nappeal our supreme court reversed, concluding Burriss was entitled to both\r\nrequests.&nbsp; \r\nAs to accident, the court noted the excuse of accident is\r\nonly available where the accused was acting lawfully and thus the primary\r\nquestion was whether Burriss was acting lawfully at the time of the\r\nshooting.&nbsp; Id. \r\n at 259, 513 S.E.2d at 106.&nbsp; The court found that notwithstanding his\r\nunlawful possession of a weapon, on which the trial court based its refusal to\r\ncharge accident, evidence in the record supported Burrisâ€™ claim that he armed\r\nhimself in self-defense at the time of the shooting.&nbsp; Id.  at 262-63, 513 S.E.2d at\r\n108.&nbsp; \r\nOn the issue of involuntary manslaughter, the court stated\r\nâ€œ[a]gain the pivotal issue is whether [Burriss] was engaged in a lawful\r\nactivity at the time of the killing.â€&nbsp; Id.  at 265, 513\r\nS.E.2d at 109.&nbsp; Although the court noted it had previously held â€œthe\r\nnegligent handling of a loaded gun will support a finding of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter,â€ the court focused on the lawfulness of the activity and made no\r\nmention of the level of care Burriss used in handling the weapon.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Here, although Lightâ€™s\r\nstatements support a finding he was lawfully armed in self-defense at the time\r\nof the shooting, there is no evidence he mishandled the gun and thus no evidence\r\nof recklessness as is required to warrant an involuntary manslaughter\r\ncharge.&nbsp; \r\nCrosby  is equally unavailing to\r\nLight.&nbsp; Although Crosby also alleged the shooting occurred while he was\r\narmed in self-defense, this court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter, citing Crosbyâ€™s\r\ntestimony that he had pulled the trigger and concluding the shooting was\r\nintentional.&nbsp; Our supreme court reversed, noting immediately after he\r\ntestified he had pulled the trigger, Crosby \r\nadded he did not even know he had pulled the trigger, suggesting he did not\r\nintentionally discharge the weapon.&nbsp; State v. Crosby,\r\n355 S.C. 47, 52-53, 584 S.E.2d 110, 112 (2003).&nbsp;&nbsp; Light contends his\r\ncase has identical evidence and inferences.&nbsp; However, Crosby \r\ntestified he closed his eyes while handling the loaded weapon.&nbsp; Id.  at 53, 584\r\nS.E.2d at 112.&nbsp; That testimony constituted evidence of recklessness, which\r\nis altogether absent in Lightâ€™s case.&nbsp; Because there was no evidence to\r\nsupport a finding of recklessness, the trial court properly refused to charge\r\ninvoluntary manslaughter.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nIn his statement of issues on appeal, Light contends the\r\nevidence reveals that he and the victim were struggling over the gun, â€œand\r\nthat the gun discharged,â€ making this a classic case of involuntary\r\nmanslaughter.&nbsp; Indeed, a charge on involuntary manslaughter would be\r\nappropriate if there was evidence that a weapon discharged during the struggle\r\nbetween the victim and Light.&nbsp; \r\n  See Casey v.

Cox, Jr., of Hartsville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  \r\n  In this divorce action, Richard R. Hawley (Husband) appeals the award of alimony \r\n  to Fran T. Hawley (Wife).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties married in October 1999.Â  At the time of the marriage, \r\n  Wife was employed at Certified Laboratories earning approximately $28,000.00 \r\n  per year.Â  The parties purchased a home in Florence County that served as the \r\n  marital residence.Â  Wifeâ€™s son from a prior marriage lived with them at the \r\n  home.Â  Wife ceased working outside the home; however, she retained ownership \r\n  of the home in which she lived before the marriage and used it as rental property.Â  \r\n\r\nA few years later, the parties separated.Â  On February 7, 2003, Husband \r\n  filed this action for separate support and maintenance.Â  Wife filed an answer \r\n  and counterclaim on March 5, 2003, and amended her pleadings on March 13, 2003.Â  \r\n  On April 4, 2003, the parties consented to a temporary order providing in part \r\n  that Wife was to have, pendente lite, sole use and possession \r\n  of the marital residence and Husband was to pay certain obligations associated \r\n  with the home, including the mortgage, insurance, and real property taxes.Â  \r\n  In addition, Husband was to pay Wife $650.00 per month to maintain power, water, \r\n  and essential services for the home.Â  \r\nHusbandâ€™s financial declarations indicated he had a gross monthly income of \r\n  $8,835.57 and a net monthly income of $5,516.75.Â  The declaration indicated \r\n  the mortgage on the marital home was $1,066.06 per month.Â  Wifeâ€™s financial \r\n  declaration indicated her main source of income was the $650.00 from Husband \r\n  pursuant to the temporary order. The parties had significant property, both \r\n  marital and non-marital, with Husband owning a substantial non-marital retirement \r\n  account. \r\nThe family court granted the divorce based upon Husbandâ€™s post-separation adultery, \r\n  divided the marital property, and required the sale of the marital residence. \r\n  [1] Â  The court also found Wife was unemployed and might need additional \r\n  training prior to being able to find employment.Â  The court attributed the partiesâ€™ \r\n  comfortable lifestyle to Husbandâ€™s earnings.Â  Finally, the court concluded:Â  \r\n  â€œA reasonable alimony payment of $1500.00 per month plus her equitable division \r\n  award should enable her to support herself reasonably, until she finds employment.Â  \r\n  At that time, upon proper pleadings, the court can adjust the alimony as necessary.â€\r\nHusband moved to amend the order with respect to the alimony award.Â  He asserted \r\n  the claim for alimony was not properly or fairly raised in the amended answer \r\n  and the facts of the case did not justify an alimony award.Â  The family court \r\n  denied the motion, and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Husband contends \r\n  the award of alimony was improper because Wife failed to raise the claim in \r\n  her pleadings and never specifically articulated her request for this relief \r\n  during the trial.Â  In support of this argument, he notes that Wifeâ€™s amended \r\n  answer and counterclaim differed from her initial responsive pleadings only \r\n  in that it added a claim for divorce on the ground of adultery and requested \r\n  alimony in the prayer for relief.Â  We find Husbandâ€™s argument unavailing.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn Harris v. Harris, \r\n  [2]  the South Carolina Supreme Court found a general prayer for alimony \r\n  was not sufficient notice of a claim to support a default judgment for lump-sum \r\n  alimony.Â  In so holding, however, the court stated that â€œordinarily a family \r\n  court would have authority to direct payment of alimony . . . under a general \r\n  prayer for such reliefâ€ and further explained that, because the respondent failed \r\n  to plead special facts and circumstances justifying an award of lump-sum alimony, \r\n  her general prayer for alimony was insufficient to support such an award upon \r\n  a default judgment. [3] \r\nIn the present \r\n  case, Wife sets forth some basic facts to support a claim of alimony, such as \r\n  leaving her job and her inability to support herself.Â  Additionally, her prayer \r\n  for relief includes a request for â€œsupport and alimony, both pendente lite and \r\n  permanently.â€Â  We agree with Wife the request in her prayer for relief was sufficient \r\n  to place Husband on notice that she was requesting alimony.Â  In contrast to \r\n  Harris, this case did not involve a default judgment.Â  Rather, both sides \r\n  actively participated in the litigation and had the opportunity to present evidence \r\n  in opposition to each otherâ€™s claims.\r\nWe are aware of Husbandâ€™s \r\n  position that much of the evidence presented during the trial supporting Wifeâ€™s \r\n  disputed claim for alimony was also relevant to the issue of equitable division \r\n  and his failure to object to the evidence was therefore not a waiver of his \r\n  objection to this relief.Â  Nevertheless, the record has evidence that in our \r\n  view would support Wifeâ€™s entitlement to spousal support but has no easily discernible \r\n  connection to the equitable distribution. \r\n  [4] Â  Furthermore, it is apparent from a settlement offer from Wifeâ€™s attorney \r\n  that Wife was seeking support, and the record does not contain anything suggesting \r\n  Husband intended to object to this request at trial on the ground that it had \r\n  not been raised in the pleadings.Â  Finally, we find it significant that, while \r\n  this action was pending, Husband agreed to pay certain expenses that could be \r\n  considered in the nature of support. [5] \r\nWe therefore hold Wifeâ€™s amended answer and counterclaim and the testimony \r\n  presented at trial were sufficient to support a finding that Husband had sufficient \r\n  notice of her alimony claim.\r\n2.Â  Husband contends the evidence presented at trial did not justify \r\n  the award of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nÂ â€œGenerally, alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, \r\n  in the same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage.â€ \r\n  [6] Â  â€œWhen a wife is awarded alimony, it is a substitute for the support \r\n  which is normally incident to the marital relationship.â€ [7] Â  In setting an alimony award, the family court must consider \r\n  the following factors:Â  (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional \r\n  health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment \r\n  history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established \r\n  during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the \r\n  parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) \r\n  marital and nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) \r\n  marital misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; \r\n  and (13) other factors the court considers relevant. [8] Â  No one factor is dispositive. \r\n  [9] \r\nThe family court, in explaining the reason for awarding alimony, explained \r\n  that Wife was unemployed and would have a difficult time finding an adequate \r\n  job to support her in the manner in which she became accustomed during the marriage.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the court reiterated the fact that Husband ended the marriage \r\n  by leaving and by committing adultery, elaborating that â€œ[s]ince Husband has \r\n  left [Wife] without legal cause, has income disproportionate to hers, has income \r\n  sufficient to support himself and her to a reasonable extent, and non-marital \r\n  assets greatly in excess of hers, he should pay her alimony on a periodic basis.â€Â  \r\n  This clearly indicates the court considered the appropriate factors before making \r\n  the award of alimony.Â  We therefore find no abuse of discretion in awarding \r\n  Wife periodic alimony.\r\n3.Â  Finally, Husband argues the family court abused its discretion in setting \r\n  the alimony award at $1,500.00 per month.Â  To the extent this argument has been \r\n  adequately briefed for appeal, we disagree.  [10] \r\nIn the divorce decree, the family court stated Wife had only a high school \r\n  diploma and therefore may need some additional training or education to re-enter \r\n  the job market.Â  The court further noted the parties had enjoyed a comfortable \r\n  lifestyle.Â  Based on these factors, the court found that â€œ[Wife] will get a \r\n  job, but it may take time, and it may not be adequate to support a lifestyle \r\n  commensurate with her last job or the lifestyle of her marriage.â€Â  As further \r\n  support of the alimony award, the court determined that, after the sale of the \r\n  marital home, in which Wife was permitted to reside while it was on the market, \r\n  Wife was â€œentitled to a residence in a safe neighborhood, comparable to the \r\n  marital home.â€Â  In addition, the court found that medical insurance alone would \r\n  cost her $220.00 per month.Â  Finally, in both the divorce decree and in statements \r\n  from the bench during the hearing on Husbandâ€™s post-trial motion, the family \r\n  court indicated that the issue of alimony would be revisited upon proper pleadings \r\n  and a showing that Wife had the means to secure â€œreasonable employment,â€ thus \r\n  allowing for the alimony award to be modified or even terminated at some future \r\n  time.Â  Under these circumstances, we hold the family court acted within its \r\n  discretion in determining the amount of alimony.

Bradford, of York, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam Thomas Moody, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Hugh Allen Evans seeks to set aside a default judgment arguing service of process was ineffective because it was not effected at his usual place of abode.Â  Alternately, Evans argues the trial court erred by declining to set aside the judgment under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, on the grounds of mistake, inadvertence, surprise, excusable neglect, or newly discovered evidence.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nElfreda J. Fassett filed suit against Evans on September 18, 2001, seeking an injunction and damages for conversion, trespass, and non-consensual removal of standing timber from Fassettâ€™s property in violation of the timber statute.[2]Â  Fassett also sought an injunction to require Evans to remove a gate obstructing the roadway to her property and to prohibit Evans from entering that property.Â Â  \r\nOn October 4, 2001, a sheriffâ€™s deputy effectuated personal service on Evans by leaving a copy of the summons and complaint, notice of motion for temporary injunction, and notice of hearing with Evansâ€™ wife at their McSwain Road residence pursuant to Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP.Â  Evans failed to appear at the October 11, 2001 hearing on the temporary injunction.Â  The trial court issued an order for temporary injunction, and a sheriffâ€™s deputy personally served Evans with a copy of the order on December 27, 2001. Â Evans also failed to answer or otherwise plead to the causes of action outlined in the complaint, and the trial court entered an order of default in favor of Fassett on November 12, 2001.Â  Fassett served Evans with the order of default and order of reference by mailing them to Evansâ€™ McSwain Road address on November 14, 2001.Â  Evans consulted with an attorney on November 19, 2001 regarding the necessary steps to set aside the entry of default, but he failed to retain his services.Â  Evans later attested that he was never served with the summons, complaint, or motion for an injunction because he had moved out of the McSwain Road residence due to marital difficulties in October 2001 and did not return until January 2002.Â  \r\nThe trial court scheduled a damages hearing and mailed notice to Evansâ€™ McSwain Road address on April 15, 2002.Â  Evans appeared and represented himself at the damages hearing on April 29, 2002.Â  After hearing expert testimony on the damages issue, the trial court awarded judgment to Fassett in the amount of $75,000.Â  The trial court filed an order of judgment and mailed it to Evansâ€™ McSwain Road residence on May 3, 2002.Â  \r\nEvans filed and served a notice of motion and a motion for new trial on May 20, 2002.Â  Evans argued the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he did not receive a copy of the summons and complaint served upon his wife on October 4, 2001.Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, Evans sought to set aside the verdict under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, on the grounds of inadvertence, excusable neglect, newly discovered evidence, and fraud.Â  He asserted that improper service of process created the mistake, inadvertence, or excusable neglect that justified setting aside the verdict under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  He also argued the judgment should be set aside due to newly discovered evidence.Â  Evans submitted affidavits in support of the motion, as proof of â€œnewly discovered evidence,â€ in which witnesses attested:Â  Evans had permission from Fassett to cut timber on her land in 1997, for which she was compensated; Evans purchased property adjacent to Fassettâ€™s in 1998 from which he cut timber; Evans thought that Fassett mistakenly believed that the timber cut from Evansâ€™ property was hers; and Evans had the permission of Fassettâ€™s nephew to put up the gate to prevent illegal dumping on both Evansâ€™ and Fassettâ€™s properties.Â  The trial court denied the motion.Â  Evans appeals. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Personal Jurisdiction\r\nEvans argues the trial court lacked personal jurisdiction over him because he never received the copy of the summons and complaint served on his wife at the McSwain Road residence.Â  Evans attested he moved out of the McSwain Road residence in October 2001 and did not return until January 2002.Â  Thus, he argues, personal service was ineffective because it was not effected at his â€œdwelling houseâ€ or â€œusual place of abodeâ€ as required by Rule 4(d), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\n Under Rule 4(d)(1), SCRCP, personal service may be made upon an individual â€œby delivering a copy of the summons and complaint to him personally or by leaving copies thereof at his dwelling house or usual place of abode with some person of suitable age and discretion then residing therein.â€Â  It is the plaintiffâ€™s burden to show that the court has personal jurisdiction over the defendant.Â  Jensen v. Doe, 292 S.C. 592, 594, 358 S.E.2d 148, 148 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  There is a presumption of proper service when the civil rules on service are followed.Â \r\nMoore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 66 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œRule 4, SCRCP serves at least two purposes.Â  It confers personal jurisdiction on the court and assures the defendant of reasonable notice of the action.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œExacting compliance with the rules is not required to effect service of process.Â  Rather, inquiry must be made as to whether the plaintiff has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction of the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.â€Â  Id.Â  Further, an officerâ€™s return of process creates the legal presumption of proper service that cannot be â€œimpeached by the mere denial of service by the defendant.â€Â  Richardson Constr. Co. v. Meek Engâ€™g &amp; Constr., 274 S.C. 307, 311, 262 S.E.2d 913, 916 (1980).\r\nSouth Carolina has not defined â€œdwelling house or place of abode.â€Â  Based on our review of federal caselaw, it appears that oneâ€™s dwelling or place of abode is determined by the particularized facts of each case.Â  See Karlson v. Rabinowitz, 318 F.2d 666, 668 (4th Cir. 1963) (finding no set definition of dwelling or place of abode and that it must be determined by the facts of the particular case); 62B Am. Jur. 2d Process Â§ 209 (1990) (â€œNo hard and fast definition can be laid down as to what constitutes a defendantâ€™s dwelling house or place of abode.Â  Rather, this determination depends upon the facts of each particular case.â€).Â  In the case of a married person, the usual place of abode is presumed to be with the family.Â  Thus, the house wherein a married manâ€™s wife resides is prima facie his usual place of abode.Â  62B Am. Jur. 2d Process Â§ 210 (1990).Â  \r\nAlthough many courts look to the defendantâ€™s intention to return as evidence regarding the location considered oneâ€™s dwelling or abode, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals has noted that the defendantâ€™s intent is not in and of itself a test but merely an indication â€œas to whether or not it is likely in a particular case that the one served will actually receive notice of the commencement of the action and thus be advised of the duty to defend.â€Â  Karlsson, 318 F.2d at 668.Â  A temporary residence is not a personâ€™s dwelling or usual place of abode if a more permanent residence is shown to exist.Â  See In re Trexler, 295 B.R. 573, 581 (Bankr. D.S.C. 2003), overruled on other grounds by I.P., L.L.C, v. McCullough, 2004 WL 1474660 (D.S.C. Apr. 15, 2004), (interpreting Bankruptcy Rule 7004 regarding service of process at a personâ€™s dwelling place or usual place of abode and noting that a personâ€™s dwelling place for purposes of service is not a temporary residence when a more permanent residence is shown to exist); see also Rosa v. Cantrell, 705 F.2d 1208, 1216 (10th Cir. 1982) (noting that the defendant bore the burden of proving he had established a new dwelling place, that mere assertion was not enough, and that evidence that his family still resided at the former marital residence was evidence that it was the usual place of abode); First Natâ€™l Bank &amp; Trust Co. of Tulsa v. Ingerton, 207 F.2d 793, 794-95 (10th Cir. 1953) (noting that several jurisdictions have held that a place where one temporarily resides is not the usual place of abode for service purposes); Holdings, Inc. v. Fung, 2004 WL 2983845, *5 (E.D.N.Y. 2004) (holding that â€œtemporarily leaving a place of abode, without thereafter establishing a different dwelling place or abode, may result in a finding that the initial place of abode remains so for the purpose of service. . . .â€); In re Southern Indus. Banking Corp., 205 B.R. 525, 531 (Bankr. E.D.Tenn. 1996) (noting that cases interpreting Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(e)(2) provide that a temporary residence at the time of service is not oneâ€™s usual place of abode where a more permanent residence exists); 35A C.J.S. Federal Civil Procedure Â§ 242 (2003) (â€œThe place where one is temporarily residing is not a usual place of abode, and where temporary residence is established away from the normal or usual residence, the â€˜place of abodeâ€™ is the usual residence regardless of the fact that defendant may be occupying the temporary residence at the time of service.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nConsidering the facts of this case, we find that the McSwain Road home was Evansâ€™ dwelling place or usual place of abode such that service by leaving the summons and complaint with his wife was proper.Â  A legal presumption of proper service was created when the sheriffâ€™s deputy left the summons and complaint with Evansâ€™ wife at their McSwain Road home on October 4, 2001.Â  Although Evans claimed in his affidavit that he separated from his wife in October 2001, the separation was admittedly short, and Evans presented no evidence he established a usual place of abode elsewhere or had no intention to return to the McSwain Road residence.Â  Evans bore the burden of proving he had established a new dwelling place, and his mere assertion that he no longer resided at the McSwain Road residence was not enough to overcome the presumption of proper service.Â  Rosa v. Cantrell, 705 F.2d at 1216.Â  Because Evans failed to present any evidence that contradicted the presumption that he resided with his wife at the McSwain Road address at the time of service, we find the trial court had personal jurisdiction over Evans.[3]Â  \r\nII.Â  Failure to set aside default judgment\r\nEvans next argues the trial court erred by failing to set aside the default judgment under Rule 60(b)(1) and (2), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nA default judgment may be set aside on the grounds of: â€œ(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect; or (2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).â€Â  Rule 60(b)(1), (2), SCRCP. However, the power to set aside a default judgment is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion.Â  Mitchell Supply Co., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 162-63, 375 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion in setting aside a default judgment occurs when the judge issuing the order was controlled by some error of law or when the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€Â  In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495 S.E.2d 454, 459 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nEvans contends improper service of process created the mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect under which the default judgment should be set aside.Â  Because we find service was proper under Rule 4(b), SCRCP, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion for relief from judgment on this basis.[4]Â  \r\nEvans also asserts the trial court erred in not setting aside the judgment because he submitted newly discovered evidence in the form of affidavits.Â  Cumulatively, the affidavits show Evans had an agreement with Fassett to log her land in 1997; Evans purchased property in 1998 adjacent to Fassettâ€™s property; Evans logged on this property, not Fassettâ€™s; and Evans received prior approval to construct the gate across the access road to both properties from Fassettâ€™s nephew.Â  \r\nRule 60(b)(2), SCRCP, clearly states new evidence must be that â€œwhich by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b).â€Â  Although the information contained in the affidavits was evidence not previously before the trial court, Evans was personally aware of the information prior to the commencement of the action.Â  Thus, it was not newly discovered evidence, but merely newly presented evidence.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the denial of relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.[5]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nEvansâ€™ mere assertion that he was not properly served with process in this case, without more evidence, will not trump the presumption that Fassett properly served Evans with process in the underlying action by leaving a copy with his wife, a person of suitable age and discretion, at Evansâ€™ usual place of abode.Â  Under the facts of this case, we find the trial court properly found he was served.Â  Because Evans failed to prove any mistake, neglect, or inadvertence entitling him to have the judgment set aside and the evidence provided to the court was not newly discovered, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying the motion to set aside the judgment.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  At the time this action was instituted, it was a misdemeanor for anyone to â€œknowingly or willfully cut, destroy or remove any trees or timber . . . without the consent of the owner.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-580 (2003).Â  This section has recently been amended to add that the unlawful removal of anotherâ€™s timber with a value in excess of $1,000 is a felony.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-580 (Supp. 2004).Â  An aggrieved landowner may seek three times the market value of the timber if it becomes necessary to file a civil action to recover the damages.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-615 (2003).\r\n[3]Â  Interestingly, Evans actually received notice of the entry of default during the period of separation from his wife at the McSwain Road residence via a letter dated November 14, 2001.Â  Despite receiving notice of entry of default and consulting with an attorney as early as November 19, 2001, Evans failed to take any action until the damages hearing on April 29, 2002.\r\n[4]Â  Evans essentially argues that he deserved relief from judgment because the improper service constituted mistake, surprise, or excusable neglect pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1).Â  However, the proper ground to set aside a default judgment due to ineffective service of process is a Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, motion that the judgment is void for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  See McDaniel v. U.S. Fidelity &amp; Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that a judgment is void for Rule 60(b)(4) purposes where the court failed to provide proper due process or where the court lacked subject matter or personal jurisdiction).Â  Evans does not raise this particular argument on appeal.Â  Further, in light of our finding that Evans was properly served, this argument would have no merit if it were properly before us. \r\n[5]Â  The trial courtâ€™s order also noted that â€œRule 60(b)(2) contemplates not only that an actual trial was held, but also that the defendant was diligent in asserting this newly discovered evidence.â€Â  The trial court based its decision to deny the motion to set aside the judgment on both the fact that the evidence was not newly discovered and the fact that the default judgment was not a trial as contemplated under the rules.Â  Evansâ€™ one sentence complaint against this portion of the trial courtâ€™s order merely notes that the order does not cite any legal authority.Â  To the extent that Evansâ€™ one sentence in his brief can be viewed as arguing on appeal that the trial court erred in finding Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, only applies to trials, the argument is conclusory and we deem it abandoned on appeal.Â  See R &amp; G Constr., Inc. v. Lowcountry Regâ€™l Transp. Auth., 343 S.C. 424, 437, 540 S.E.2d 113, 120 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding that where no authority is cited and argument in brief is conclusory, issue is deemed abandoned). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3959","title":"Chapman v.

Chapman, brought this action seeking damages for breach of contract, breach of express and implied warranties, and revocation of acceptance.Â  The Chapmans sought costs and attorneyâ€™s fees under the Magnuson-Moss Act.Â  Upstate RV &amp; Marine, d/b/a Holiday Kamper &amp; Boats-Piedmont (â€œHolidayâ€) appeals from the judgment awarding the Chapmans damages, costs, and attorneyâ€™s fees.[1]Â  We affirm.[2]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Chapmans sought to purchase a thirty-two-foot houseboat of durable quality so that they could spend long weekends with their family camping overnight at the lake.Â  After speaking with a salesman from Holiday and reviewing a pamphlet, they selected a boat manufactured by Tracker Marine, Inc, and purchased it from Holiday for $42,524.Â  The negotiated boat included several features the Chapmans wanted:Â  a rubberized mat on the roof for sunbathing; a cooking area with running water, a stove, grill, and table; a bathroom; sleeping quarters; a generator; a stereo; heating and air conditioning; an upgraded motor; and a three-axle trailer with guide rollers for ease in loading.Â  The Chapmansâ€™ boat was delivered from Columbia to Holiday in Seneca on June 29, 1996.Â  Upon inspection, Mr. Chapman noticed that the trailer did not have guide rollers, the boat was dented on the side, the lettering was coming off, the molding around the generator cover was coming off, the rubber mat on the roof had wood sticking through it, the bathroom door was scratched, the fender on the trailer was split, and the grill cover was cracked.Â Â  \r\nOn July 1, 1996, the Chapmans attempted to take the boat to the lake for the first time.Â  They realized the brakes on the trailer did not work properly, so they returned home.Â  After having the brakes repaired, the Chapmans again attempted to use the boat.Â  The Chapmans and their children became stranded on the lake overnight when the generator and battery failed.Â  During that time, the carbon monoxide alarm went off and the children were soaked with rain because the canvas tent over the sleeping quarters leaked.Â  Because the trailer did not have guide rollers, Mr. Chapman had to get into the water behind the boat and maneuver it onto the trailer when they wanted to leave. \r\nThe Chapmans also noticed numerous other defects and examples of poor workmanship.Â  Some of the problems included poor sealing in the engine, a missing trim gauge on the motor, a cracked speaker cover, a leak in the sink, missing snaps on the canvas cover, a screen door which fell off, and a malfunctioning horn.Â  The boat was taken to Holiday for repairs.Â  However, when the Chapmans received the boat a month later in mid-August 1996, many of the problems were not fixed.Â  The Chapmans took the boat out just two times after that.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  closing, the Chapmans had to transport the boat to the Greenville store on January 16, 1997.Â  The Chapmans were told the parts were purchased to make the necessary repairs.Â  They checked on the progress of the boat every month thereafter.Â  On June 19, 1997, the Chapmans were informed they could pick up their boat.Â  When they arrived, a Holiday employee informed them that they had been misled, that the boat had not been repaired, and that the parts to repair the boat had been ordered.Â  \r\nThe Chapmans intended to return the boat to Holiday at that time.Â  However, Doris Vaughn, the new service manager for Holiday, persuaded them to allow the boat to be fixed and she would make sure it was done no later than the Chapmansâ€™ next long weekend, which was July 16, 1997.Â  The Chapmans returned the following day to see if work had begun on the repairs.Â  When they arrived a worker was painting the roof where the rubberized mat had previously been.Â  Mr. Chapman refused to accept a painted surface, instead demanding a new mat so the deck could be used as intended.Â  \r\nUnfortunately, when they arrived on July 16, 1997, the boat was not repaired.Â  The horn was disassembled; the molding was not repaired; the rubberized mat on the roof was not replaced; the canvas top was not repaired; the door had not been repaired; and there were no rollers on the trailer for loading the boat.Â  The Chapmans informed Holiday of their intention to revoke acceptance of the boat.Â  \r\nIn May 1999, the Chapmans instituted this action for breach of express and implied warranties and for revocation of acceptance.Â  At trial, Mr. and Mrs. Chapman testified regarding the boatâ€™s numerous defects and their attempts to have them fixed.Â  Mr. Chapman testified that the value of the boat without defects was the purchase price, or $42,524, and he would not have paid that price if he had known about the defects.Â  Mrs. Chapman testified the boat was worth no more than $15,000 at the time of revocation in July 1997.Â  She testified at trial that she would not â€œgive $2,000â€ for the boat because of the neglect and damage done since it was returned to Holidayâ€™s possession.Â  \r\nCharles Long, an employee of Tracker, testified regarding the boatâ€™s value.Â  He stated the NADA Guidebookâ€™s low retail value for the boat was $15,300, and the average retail value was $19,850.Â  He testified the trailer separately had a low retail value of $3,450 and an average retail value of $4,015.Â  On cross-examination, Long opined the boat was worth $21,585 given its condition in 2001. \r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the Chapmans on both their breach of warranty and revocation of acceptance claims.Â  The jury found Holiday was the only defendant liable on either claim.Â  On the breach of warranty claim, the jury awarded $22,324.Â  The jury awarded $48,000 on the revocation of acceptance claim.Â  \r\n Holiday filed post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV), new trial absolute, new trial nisi remittitur, and to require the Chapmans to elect their remedy.Â  The Chapmans filed to collect attorneyâ€™s fees under the Magnuson-Moss Act, 15 U.S.C.A. Â§ 2310(d) (1998).Â  The trial judge denied the motions for JNOV and new trial absolute.Â  The judge granted the motion for new trial nisi remittitur as to the revocation of acceptance claim, and reduced the verdict to $45,000.Â  The Chapmanâ€™s were awarded $20,957.69 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs on their breach of warranty claim under the Magnuson-Moss Act and were required to elect between their remedies.Â  \r\nHoliday filed a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP to alter or amend the judgment. Â The motion restated the same arguments made in their previous JNOV and new trial motions.Â  Additionally, Holiday sought to further reduce the award under the revocation of acceptance claim and to reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The motion was denied.Â  The Chapmans elected to recover under their breach of warranty claim.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n Holiday contends the trial judge erred in failing to grant its motions for a new trial absolute or, in the alternative, for a new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Holiday contends the Chapmans failed to properly prove damages under the breach of warranty claim because they offered no proof of the value of the boat as accepted.Â  We disagree.\r\nInitially, we note this issue is not preserved.Â  Holiday raised the damages issue in its directed verdict motion; however, the issue was raised in the context of causation.Â  Specifically, Holiday argued that it had done nothing wrong and any damages were due to a defective product manufactured by Tracker Marine, Inc., its co-defendant.Â  In its directed verdict motion, Holiday never questioned the existence of damages nor the measure of damages.Â  Failure to raise the issue that is now on appeal in the directed verdict motion bars review on appeal.Â  See In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 93, 551 S.E.2d 235, 238 (2001) (noting that since only issues raised in the directed verdict motion may be raised in the JNOV motion, motions newly raised in the JNOV motion were not preserved for review); Roland v. Palmetto Hills, 308 S.C. 283, 286, 417 S.E.2d 626, 628 (Ct. App. 1992) (â€œA motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict is a renewal of the directed verdict motion and cannot raise grounds beyond those raised in the directed verdict.â€).Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\nIn any event, even if the issue were preserved, we find Holidayâ€™s appeal to be without merit.Â  â€œThe grant or denial of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the trial judge and his decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless his findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error of law.â€Â  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge must grant a new trial absolute if the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, partiality, corruption or some other improper motives . . . The failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to an abuse of discretion and on appeal this Court will grant a new trial absolute.Â  \r\n\r\nVinson, 324 S.C. at 404-05, 477 S.E.2d at 723.Â  â€œAlternatively, the trial court may grant a new trial absolute when, sitting as the thirteenth juror, it concludes the juryâ€™s verdict is not supported by the evidence.â€Â  Duncan v. Hampton Co. Sch. Dist. No. 2, 335 S.C. 535, 547, 517 S.E.2d 449, 455 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  However, substantial deference should be given to a juryâ€™s determination of damages.Â  Knoke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Parks, Recreation &amp; Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996).Â  \r\nâ€œThe trial judge alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when he finds the amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive. . . .â€Â  McCourt by &amp; Through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 308, 457 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1995).Â  Compelling reasons, however, must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s province in this manner.Â  Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 61, 427 S.E.2d 673, 676 (1993).Â  Whether to deny a motion for a new trial nisi is a matter within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law.Â  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 406, 477 S.E.2d at 723-24.\r\nIn a breach of warranty action, the measure of damages is â€œthe difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-714(2) (2003).Â  The absence of proof of one of these values normally bars recovery and warrants the granting of a new trial.Â  See Ellison v. Heritage Dodge, 283 S.C. 21, 26, 320 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (Ct. App. 1984) (affirming the trial judgeâ€™s grant of an involuntary nonsuit in a breach of warranty action where the plaintiff failed to prove the fair market value of a van in its defective condition at the time the plaintiff returned the vehicle to the secured creditor).Â  However, our courts have upheld jury verdicts where evidence existed from which the jury could determine the value of the goods in their defective condition.Â  Draffin v. Chrysler Motors Corp, 252 S.C. 348, 351, 166 S.E.2d 305, 307 (1969) (holding that although there was no direct testimony by the plaintiff regarding the value of the automobile in its defective condition, testimony from the plaintiff, his wife, and his son regarding the defects and evidence regarding the resale value of the automobile were sufficient to enable the jury to arrive at the value in its defective condition); Durant v. Palmetto Chevrolet, Inc., 241 S.C. 508, 515, 129 S.E.2d 323, 326 (1963) (holding that evidence of a trade-in value of a defective car, testimony regarding the numerous defects with the car, and evidence regarding numerous attempts to repair the car, were sufficient to support the juryâ€™s verdict in favor of the plaintiff, despite the lack of opinion evidence regarding the carâ€™s value on the date of sale). \r\nThe basis of Holidayâ€™s argument on appeal is that the Chapmans offered insufficient proof of a necessary element of their claimâ€”the value of the boat at the time they received it in the condition it was received.Â  Holiday contends Mrs. Chapmanâ€™s testimony that the boat was only worth $15,000 one year after the date of receipt was insufficient evidence of the value of the boat when it was received; thus, there was no evidence to support the juryâ€™s award.Â  \r\nAs in Draffin and Durant, we find the evidence was â€œsufficient to enable the jury to arrive at the fair market valueâ€ of the boat in its defective condition.Â  Ellison, 283 S.C. at 25, 320 S.E.2d at 718.Â  The Chapmans returned the boat to Holiday for repairs from mid-July 1996 to mid-August 1996 and from November or December 1996 until transferring it to the Greenville store in January 1997, where it stayed until the Chapmans revoked acceptance in July 1997.Â  Thus, at most, the boat was in the Chapmansâ€™ possession for only five months, during which time the boat was only used on two occasions.Â  Holiday, by contrast, had possession of the boat approximately eight months prior to revocation.Â  Because the boat was used so infrequently, it was in the Chapmanâ€™s possession for such a short time, and Holiday failed to make the necessary repairs by the time of revocation, the jury could reasonably have concluded that the valuation from the time of revocation would also apply to the value of the boat at the time of acceptance.\r\nFurther, the Chapmans testified at length about the numerous problems caused by the defects, including being stranded on the lake with their young children, and about the numerous times they were promised by Holiday that the boat would be repaired.Â  Mrs. Chapman valued the boat at the time they revoked acceptance at $15,000.Â  Trackerâ€™s expert, Long, gave several 2001 NADA values for the boat and trailer combined, ranging from $18,750 to $23,865.Â  Long also testified that it was his opinion that the boat was worth $21,585 in 2001.Â  The jury awarded $22,324 in damages, indicating they believed that was the difference between the value of the boat as warranted and the boat as received in its defective condition.Â  To arrive at that damages figure, the jury had to value the boat in its defective condition at approximately $20,000.Â  The testimony regarding the boatâ€™s value at the time of revocation, the numerous defects, and the failed attempts to get it repaired was evidence from which the jury could determine the value of the boat at the time of acceptance.Â  The juryâ€™s award is clearly within the range of that evidence.Â  \r\nWe cannot say the amount awarded shocks the conscience of this court, nor do we find it merely excessive given the facts and circumstances of this case.Â  Accordingly, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial courtâ€™s denial of Holidayâ€™s motions for a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi remittitur.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nEvidence was presented at trial from which the jury could determine the value of the boat in its defective condition.Â  Thus, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in denying Holidayâ€™s motions for a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi remittitur as to the damages awarded on the warranty claim.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the trial judge is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Holiday raised several issues on appeal, arguing the trial court erred in:Â  (1) denying its motion for JNOV because the Chapmans failed to establish liability under warranty, damages caused by Holiday, or the right to revocation; (2) denying its motions for a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi remittitur where there was no evidence of the boatâ€™s value under the breach of warranty claim; (3) denying the motion for a new trial where the admission of a 2001 photograph of the boat was prejudicial; and (4) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees where Holiday is not liable under the Magnuson-Moss warranty act.Â  At oral argument, counsel for Holiday informed the court that Holiday was waiving all issues except the proof of damages on the breach of warranty claim.Â  Accordingly, we address only Holidayâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in denying its motion for a new trial or new trial nisi remittitur in light of the Chapmansâ€™ failure to prove damages.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  The Chapmans argue that Holidayâ€™s appeal was untimely because the substance of Holidayâ€™s Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion was identical to its prior post-trial motions for a new trial absolute and new trial nisi remittitur.Â  Thus, the Chapmans argue, the Rule 59(e) motion was actually a successive new trial motion and did not toll the time for filing the appeal.Â  However, in deciding the post-trial motions, the trial court for the first time awarded the Chapmans attorneyâ€™s fees under the Magnuson-Moss Act.Â  Although Holidayâ€™s subsequent Rule 59(e) motion did address some issues it raised in its prior motion, it also raised an objection to the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Accordingly, Holidayâ€™s Rule 59(e) motion was not successive.Â  Holiday timely filed its appeal after the order on the Rule 59(e) motion.Â  See Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR (holding that the notice of appeal from a civil judgment must be served upon all respondents within thirty days after receipt of written notice of entry of judgment, and a timely motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, will toll the time for an appeal until receipt of written notice of entry of order granting or denying the motion); Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 21, 602 S.E.2d 772, 778 (2004) (holding that a party â€œusually is free to file an initial Rule 59(e) motion, regardless of whether the previous JNOV/new trial motions were made orally or in writing, without unnecessary concern the repetition of an issue or argument made in a previous motion will result in a subsequent appeal being dismissed as untimelyâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3960","title":"Weimer v.

Peters Wilborn, Jr., all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Ray Jones appeals a circuit court order confirming an arbitratorâ€™s award of $260,000 to Walter Weimer.Â  Jones argues that by failing to apply the statute of limitations to Weimerâ€™s claim, the arbitrator exhibited a manifest disregard for the law.Â  We affirm.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nWeimer brought this action against Jones, alleging claims for breach of contract and quantum meruit among others.Â  The claims involved trading of cars and car parts.Â  The parties jointly moved to have the case submitted to binding arbitration.Â  The arbitrator agreed with Jones that the applicable statute of limitation barred Weimerâ€™s breach of contract claim.Â  Additionally, the arbitrator held part of Weimerâ€™s quantum meruit claim was barred by laches but that another part of the claim, concerning Weimer trading a Maserati and Lamborghini for a Bugatti that Jones was building, was not barred.Â  On this claim, the arbitrator found for Weimer and awarded him $260,000.Â  Following additional proceedings, the circuit court confirmed the award.Â  \r\nDiscussion\r\nâ€œArbitration is a favored method of settling disputes in South Carolina.â€Â  Pittman Mortgage Co. v. Edwards, 327 S.C. 72, 75, 488 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1997).Â  â€œGenerally speaking, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts will refuse to review the merits of an award.â€Â  Batten v. Howell, 300 S.C. 545, 547, 389 S.E.2d 170, 171 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Judicial review of an arbitratorâ€™s award is thus limited.Â  Lauro v. Visnapuu, 351 S.C. 507, 516, 570 S.E.2d 551, 555-56 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The Uniform Arbitration Act provides statutory grounds for vacating, modifying, or correcting an arbitratorâ€™s award.Â  S.C Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-130 (2005) (providing grounds for vacating arbitratorâ€™s award); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-140 (2005) (providing grounds for modification or correction of arbitratorâ€™s award).Â  Absent one of these grounds, an arbitration award will be vacated only on the non-statutory ground of â€œmanifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law.â€Â  Lauro, 351 S.C. at 516, 570 S.E.2d at 556.Â  â€œ[M]anifest disregard of the law occurs when the arbitrator knew of a governing legal principle yet refused to apply it, and the law disregarded was well defined, explicit, and clearly applicable to the case.â€Â  Bazzle v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 351 S.C. 244, 268, 569 S.E.2d 349, 361 (2002), vacated and remanded on other grounds, 539 U.S. 444 (2003).Â  \r\nIn this case, Jones does not assert any of the statutory grounds for setting aside or altering the arbitratorâ€™s award.Â  Instead, he asserts the arbitrator displayed a manifest disregard for the law.Â  Jones contends Weimerâ€™s quantum meruit claim cannot survive because it is based on an express contract.Â  He cites Swanson v. Stratos, 350 S.C. 116, 564 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 2002), for the proposition that a plaintiff cannot recover under quantum meruit where the claim is based on an express contract that has not been abandoned or rescinded.Â  However, the arbitrator, in addition to finding the statute of limitations action for any contract action had run, also concluded the purported written contract lacking in elements and details.Â  Because the arbitrator did not find the parties ever had a valid express contract, we conclude his consideration of the alternative claim of quantum meruit did not constitute a manifest disregard of the law.Â  \r\nJones also argues because Weimerâ€™s contract action is barred by the statute of limitations, his quantum meruit claim emanating from the contract is also barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Jones cites to this court as he did to the arbitrator, McConnell v. Crocker, 217 S.C. 334, 60 S.E.2d 673 (1950), for the proposition that the statute of limitations applies to quantum meruit claims.Â  In response, Weimer cites to a more recent case, Anderson v. Purvis, 220 S.C. 259, 262, 67 S.E.2d 80, 81 (1951), in which our supreme court considered McConnell, stated it involved an action at law, and noted a statute of limitations did not bar the equitable action of quantum meruit.Â  The partiesâ€™ vigorous debate regarding which defense is proper demonstrates the arbitrator did not disregard well-defined, explicit, and clearly applicable law in rendering his decision.Â  Jones simply fails to show the arbitrator knew the applicable law and chose to disregard it.\r\nBecause Jones has not shown the arbitratorâ€™s award reflected a manifest disregard or perverse misconstruction of the law, we are constrained by the applicable standard of review to affirm. \r\nAFFIRMED.Â \r\n GOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3961","title":"State v.

Gowdy, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Appellant, Timothy Jones, was tried for and convicted of trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  He appeals, asserting the trial judge erred in failing to suppress the drug evidence because it was tainted fruit seized in an illegal detention.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAt the start of the case, Jones made a pretrial motion to suppress the drug evidence in this case arguing it was the result of a prolonged detention that became unlawful.Â  Jones asserted the officer, who pulled Jones over for speeding, exceeded the scope of the stop when he questioned Jones and requested backup for the purpose of searching the vehicle.Â  The court held an in camera hearing, at which time the State presented the testimony of Trooper J. Ryan Elrod.Â  \r\nTrooper Elrod first testified to his normal procedure when pulling a car over for speeding.Â  He stated that he generally calls in the traffic stop to dispatch, approaches the vehicle, speaks to the driver, and then directs the driver to get out of the car and stand at the left front wheel of the patrol car.Â  He then asks â€œwhere theyâ€™re going, if they realize their speed, where theyâ€™re coming from, . . . why theyâ€™re in a hurry, is there any reason for their speed . . . .â€Â  He requests license, registration, and proof of insurance.Â  On average, with no unusual circumstances, the normal traffic stop takes him five to six minutes.Â  \r\nTrooper Elrod testified that, at approximately 1:30 p.m. on September 25, 2001, he was on I-85 in Spartanburg County patrolling northbound traffic for speeding violations when he observed an automobile traveling the interstate at a high rate of speed.Â  His radar indicated the car was traveling 82 miles an hour in the 70 mile an hour zone.Â  Trooper Elrod pulled the car over, walked up to the driverâ€™s side, explained to the driver why he had stopped him, and asked the driver to step back to the patrol vehicle while he issued him a summons for speeding.Â  The driver of the vehicle was Timothy Jones.Â  Trooper Elrod described the weather as mild, breezy, and very cool for that time of year.Â  Jones exited the vehicle and walked back to the trooperâ€™s car as requested.Â  \r\nWhile in the process of issuing the traffic ticket, Trooper Elrod asked Jones where he and the other occupants of the vehicle were coming from, and Jones indicated they had been in Greenville to visit his cousin regarding opening up a barbershop business.Â  He first told the trooper they had stayed in a hotel, but could not tell him the name or location of the hotel.Â  He then told Trooper Elrod they stayed with his cousin, but he could not give the trooper his cousinâ€™s name or the location of his cousinâ€™s residence. Â \r\nJones presented the trooper with a driverâ€™s license, but did not produce registration for the vehicle.Â  Jones appeared very nervous.Â  The driverâ€™s license came back clear, but since Jones did not have his registration, Trooper Elrod returned to the vehicle, looked at the vehicle identification number, and then went over to the passenger to request assistance in locating the registration.Â  After fumbling through some paperwork, the front seat passenger, Mr. Patterson, produced the registration.Â  During this time, Trooper Elrod asked Patterson where they had been.Â  Patterson responded they had been to Spartanburg for the last two days, but he could not remember where in Spartanburg.Â  As Trooper Elrod spoke to Patterson, the back seat passenger, Mr. Clark, stated something to the trooper which could not be heard due to the noise on the interstate.Â  Trooper Elrod shut the front passenger door, opened up the rear door, and asked Clark what he had said.Â  Clark then stated they had been in Atlanta that morning, not Spartanburg.Â  \r\nAt that point, Trooper Elrod closed the door to the car and called for any unit in the area to come to his location.Â  His call for backup occurred approximately seven minutes into the stop.Â  Just prior to requesting backup, Trooper Elrod asked Jones if there were any weapons or anything else in the vehicle he needed to know about and Jones answered there were not.Â  The trooper then asked if Jones had any problem with him searching the vehicle and Jones responded he had no problem with that.Â  \r\nIt took about three to four minutes for the back-up officer, Trooper Earle, to arrive on the scene.Â  During this time, Trooper Elrod continued to fill out the paperwork on Jonesâ€™ speeding ticket.Â  The trooper was in the process of explaining the ticket to Jones when he observed the front seat passenger, Patterson, jump out of the vehicle with a white towel in his hand.Â  This occurred almost simultaneously with the point at which Trooper Earle arrived on the scene.Â  Trooper Earle began a foot pursuit of Patterson while Trooper Elrod pursued in his car.Â  The officers were able to catch Patterson after he ran into some briars.Â  During the chase, Trooper Elrod observed Patterson throwing objects into the briars.Â  The objects retrieved were bags containing white, powdery substances, which were later determined to be 230.83 grams of crack cocaine.Â  \r\nWhen asked why he called for back-up, the trooper explained:\r\n\r\nI had three different stories on where they had been.Â  I was by myself.Â  The driver of the vehicle, Mr. Jones, was, in my opinion, was very uneasy.Â  He was sweating profusely.Â  Again, it was a cool day.Â  He acted very nervous.Â  And it was one on three, and regardless of the situation, I felt that I needed back-up at the scene, andÂ  - - - I just didnâ€™t feel something was right, and in my safety, I called for back-up.\r\n\r\nTrooper Elrod admitted that part of the reason he called for backup was that he would need a secondary officer to search the vehicle, but denied that his purpose in talking with Jones was to wait for backup to arrive.Â  Rather, he stated he was in the process of writing the citation and explaining it to Jones when Patterson jumped from the car and ran.Â  \r\nJones argued to the trial judge that the officer had gone on a â€œfishing expeditionâ€ and prolonged his detention for the purpose of performing a search.Â  He asserted the questioning of the passengers and the extended conversation the officer had with him about where they had been and what they were doing was merely a â€œruseâ€ so he could eventually search the car.Â  Jones maintained â€œanything this officer did with [him] pursuant to this stop after a reasonable period of time had expired for him to issue him the summons . . . [was] unreasonableâ€ and was therefore an illegal detention.Â  \r\nThe trial judge found the amount of time of this traffic stop was not too long and that it was a legal stop and detention.Â  He determined, because Jones did not initially produce the registration, the officer had the right to check the vehicle identification number and ask the passenger to help him look for the registration.Â  He found no constitutional violation with the casual conversation the officer carried on with the passenger while he looked for the registration.Â  He further determined whether Jones gave consent to search the vehicle was irrelevant inasmuch as there was no search carried out pursuant to the alleged consent since Patterson jumped out of the car and ran, throwing objects to the ground after having been detained for, at most, around eleven minutes.Â  The trial judge therefore denied the motion to suppress.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJones appeals his conviction arguing the trial judge erred in denying his motion to suppress the crack cocaine recovered in this case because it was tainted fruit seized as the result of an illegal detention.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nJones relies largely on the case of State v. Williams, 351 S.C. 591, 571 S.E.2d 703 (Ct. App. 2002), asserting when the officer obtained his registration and license and the license check revealed nothing, the investigatory purpose of the speeding ticket was complete.Â  He thus argues his questioning, along with that of the two passengers, as well as the call for backup amounted to an illegal detention exceeding the scope of the traffic stop.Â  \r\nIn Williams, a police officer stopped a vehicle for a possible insurance violation and discovered the vehicleâ€™s tag had been suspended for lack of insurance.Â  The officer ran a license check on the driver and found, although his driving record was clean at that time, the driverâ€™s license had previously been suspended for a controlled substance violation.Â  The officer asked the driver to step outside the vehicle while he issued a citation for the tag violation.Â  The officer wrote and explained the ticket to the driver and returned the license and registration to the driver stating, â€œBefore you leave, let me ask you a few questions.â€Â  The officer then proceeded to ask the driver a series of questions, including where he was coming from and where he was headed.Â  He also asked the driver the name of his passenger and what their relationship was.Â  As the officer was speaking with the driver, a K-9 officer arrived after a request for backup was made.Â  The officer who made the traffic stop then began to question the passenger, Williams.Â  When Williams gave inconsistent answers to that of the driver, these inconsistencies, along with knowledge of the driverâ€™s previous license suspension, led the officer to request consent to search the vehicle.Â  The officers ultimately found a twenty-five pound block of marijuana in a suitcase to which Williams had acknowledged ownership.Â  At a pretrial hearing, the officer admitted he did not follow his normal procedure when issuing a traffic citation of returning the driverâ€™s license, explaining the ticket, asking the driver if he has any questions, and allowing the driver to then leave.Â  The officer further agreed his only basis for questioning the driver further was the driverâ€™s previous license suspension for a drug violation.Â  Id.Â  at 595-96, 571 S.E.2d at 705-06.\r\nThe trial judge in Williams granted the motion to suppress finding the search was illegal because the officer lacked reasonable suspicion to question the driver and Williams beyond the scope of the traffic stop.Â  Id. at 596, 571 S.E.2d at 706.Â  The State appealed, and this court affirmed, finding â€œ[t]he marijuana found in Williamsâ€™ suitcase was discovered through an illegal detention accompanied by a lack of valid consent.â€Â  Id. at 605, 571 S.E.2d at 711.\r\nWe find Williams to be easily distinguishable from the case at hand.Â  In Williams, the driver and passenger were clearly detained beyond the scope of the traffic stop.Â  There, the officer had written and explained the ticket to the driver and had returned his license and registration before he began questioning the driver.Â  We further noted in Williams that the driver and passenger had been detained between twenty-five and forty minutes as opposed to the officerâ€™s normal stop time of nine to eleven minutes, and the officer there did not otherwise follow his normal procedure for a traffic stop.Â  Id.Â  at 602, 571 S.E.2d at 709.Â  In Williams, we held:\r\n\r\nOnce a motor vehicle is detained lawfully for a traffic violation, the police may order the driver to exit the vehicle without violating Fourth Amendment proscriptions on unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Pennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 111 n. 6, 98 S.Ct. 330, 54 L.Ed.2d 331 (1977).Â  In carrying out the stop, an officer â€œâ€˜may request a driverâ€™s license and vehicle registration, run a computer check, and issue a citation.â€™â€Â Â  United States v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted).Â  However, â€œ[a]ny further detention for questioning is beyond the scope of the [] stop and therefore illegal unless the officer has a reasonable suspicion of a serious crime.â€Â  Id. Â (emphasis added); see Florida v. Royer, 460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 75 L.Ed.2d 229 (1983) (plurality opinion) (â€œ[A]n investigative detention must be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop.â€); Ferris v. State, 355 Md. 356, 735 A.2d 491, 499 (1999) (â€œOnce the purpose of [the] stop has been fulfilled, the continued detention of the car and the occupants amounts to a second detention.â€).Â  The question, then, is whether Blajszczak detained, i.e. â€œseizedâ€ Williams anew, thereby triggering the Fourth Amendment and possibly rendering his consent invalid, or simply initiated a consensual encounter invoking no constitutional scrutiny.Â  See Ferris, 735 A.2d at 500 (stating the difficult question was whether the trooperâ€™s questioning of Ferris after he issued a citation and returned his driverâ€™s license and registration â€œconstituted a detention, and hence raise[d] any Fourth Amendment concerns, or was merely a â€˜consensual encounter[]â€™ . . . implicating no constitutional overviewâ€).\r\n\r\nId.Â  at 598-99, 571 S.E.2d at 707-08.Â  \r\nIn the case at hand, there is no question but that the vehicle was detained lawfully for a traffic violation and Trooper Elrod was allowed to request Jones exit the vehicle without violating Fourth Amendment proscriptions on unreasonable searches and seizures.Â  Unlike the Williams case, there was no further detention for questioning beyond the scope of the stop here.Â  Trooper Elrod did not question Jones and his passengers after he had returned Jonesâ€™ license and registration.Â  To the contrary, Trooper Elrod had not completed the issuance of the traffic ticket, and the purpose of the original stop had not yet been fulfilled when Patterson jumped from the car and ran, throwing objects to the ground.Â  Although Jones alluded in his argument to the trial judge that Trooper Elrod essentially extended the stop beyond a reasonable time by going on a â€œfishing expeditionâ€ prior to the issuance of the ticket, there is evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s determination that the detention was not for an unreasonably long time, the extension of time was attributable to the additional time required in obtaining the car registration, and the questions asked of Jones and the passengers did not exceed the scope of the traffic stop such as would convert the stop into an illegal detention.Â  \r\nWe find further support for our decision in the recent United States Supreme Court decision Illinois v. Caballes, No. 03-923, 2005 WL 123826 (U.S. Sup. Ct. Jan. 24, 2005).Â  In Caballes, a trooper stopped motorist Caballes for speeding on an interstate.Â  When the officer reported the traffic stop to dispatch, a second trooper overheard the transmission and immediately headed for the scene with his narcotics-detection dog.Â  The first trooper had Caballes in his patrol car and was in the process of writing a warning ticket when the second trooper walked the dog around Caballesâ€™ vehicle and the dog alerted at the trunk.Â  A subsequent search of the trunk resulted in the discovery of marijuana.Â  The trial judge, finding the officers had not unnecessarily prolonged the stop, denied Caballesâ€™ motion to suppress the evidence, and Caballes was convicted of a narcotics offense.Â  The Appellate Court affirmed, but the Illinois Supreme Court subsequently reversed the conviction finding the use of the dog unjustifiably enlarged the scope of a routine traffic stop.Â  Id.Â  at *1.Â  The U.S. Supreme Court vacated and remanded, noting they â€œaccept[ed] the state courtâ€™s conclusion that the duration of the stop . . . was entirely justified by the traffic offense and the ordinary inquiries incident to such a stop.â€Â  Id. Â at *2.\r\nIn the case at hand, there is evidence to support the trial judgeâ€™s findings and we cannot say his findings are clearly erroneous.Â  We therefore find no abuse of discretion.Â  See State v. Wilson,\r\n345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (holding in a criminal case the appellate court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence unless the findings are clearly erroneous, and its review extends only to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion); State v. Green, 341 S.C. 214, 219 n.3, 532 S.E.2d 896, 898 n.3 (Ct. App. 2000), (holding â€œthe appellate standard of review in Fourth Amendment search and seizure cases is limited to determining whether any evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s finding and the appellate court may only reverse where there is clear error.â€).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, Jonesâ€™ conviction isÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3962","title":"Robinson v.

We reverse.[1]  \r\nThe magistrateâ€™s court entered a default judgment against Hassiotis because Hassiotis failed to appear at the time set for his trial. Hassiotis appealed to the circuit court.Â  He argued the â€œInstructions to Defendantâ€ form that he received from the magistrateâ€™s court indicated he would receive notice of trial after he filed an answer.Â  He alleged he filed an answer and awaited notice of his trial date, but never received notice.Â  The circuit court remanded the case to the magistrateâ€™s court for a decision on the issue of notice.Â  The magistrate found Hassiotis received proper notice because the magistrateâ€™s constable personally advised Hassiotis of the trial date. The circuit court affirmed.Â  Hassiotis appeals.Â  \r\nHassiotis argues the magistrateâ€™s court erred in finding he was properly notified of his trial date.Â  He contends that the South Carolina Rules of the Magistrateâ€™s Court require written notice of trial and provide that notice will be delivered after a defendant answers the complaint.Â  We agree. [2]Â  \r\nRule 9(a), SCRMC, provides â€œ[u]pon the filing of an answer by the defendant, the magistrate shall set the date of trial and serve notice of the same on both parties in a manner provided for in Rule 6.â€Â  Rule 6(b) SCRMC, requires service to be made â€œby personal service, or service by publication in a manner provided for in Title 15 of the South Carolina Code of Laws, or by mail . . . .â€Â  A suggested form for providing written notice of trial is included in Rule 19, SCRMC. \r\nIn this case, Hassiotis received oral notice concerning his trial date prior to the time that he filed his answer.Â  But oral notice is not sufficient under the Magistrateâ€™s Court Rules.Â  The rules contemplate written notice of trial and contemplate delivery of the notice after the filing of the answer.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Steele Robinson has not filed a Respondentsâ€™ Brief.Â  The South Carolina Appellate Court Rules provide that â€œ[u]pon the failure of respondent to timely file a brief, the appellate court may take such action as it deems proper.â€Â  Rule 208(a)(4), SCACR.Â  Such action may include reversal.Â  Turner v.

Brown, Jr., Special Referee\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3963\r\nHeard February 9, 2005 â€“ Filed March 14, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART and REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAndrew F. Lindemann and William H. Davidson, II, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nJohn E. Parker and Ronnie L. Crosby, both of Hampton, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  The South Carolina Department of Agriculture (SCDA) appeals the decision of the special referee finding Johnny McMillan and Jimmie Griner (collectively Respondents) were entitled to recover damages, pre-judgment interest, and attorneyâ€™s fees from the Warehouse Receipts Guaranty Fund. [1]Â  We affirm in part, and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nMcMillan and Griner are farmers in Hampton County.Â  Each contracted with Hampton County Warehouse (the warehouse) to store cotton.Â  The warehouse was a licensed facility by the SCDA pursuant to sections 39-22-10 through â€“200 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  McMillan stored 1,180 bales of cotton and Griner stored 358 bales of cotton. \r\nIn addition to contracting with the warehouse for storage, Respondents both contracted with Sea Island Cotton Trading Company (the broker) to sell the cotton.[2]Â  Approximately three months after entering the contract with the broker, Respondents each received an advance of 80 percent of the market price for cotton at that time with the understanding that when the market price increased the cotton would be sold as authorized by Respondents. Although warehouse receipts for the cotton indicated ownership was transferred to the broker, it is unclear from the record when this took place.Â  \r\nThe warehouse and the broker each declared bankruptcy in 1998.Â  Respondents were unable to sell their cotton and failed to collect the remaining 20 percent owed for the cotton.Â  Pursuant to the Warehouse Receipts Guaranty Fund and section 39-22-15 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004), Respondents filed claims with SCDA to recover the 20 percent loss they claim resulted from the warehouseâ€™s bankruptcy.Â  The former director of SCDA denied the claims.Â  In the denials, he noted the receipts indicating a sale to the broker and suggested Respondents seek other legal action.Â  The denial makes no mention of any further administrative remedy, including no mention of an appeal of his decision.\r\nRespondents then filed claims in bankruptcy court, seeking to collect the losses.Â  However, the bankruptcy court, upon a finding that ownership was never transferred to the broker and remained with Respondents, rejected the claims.Â  \r\nRespondents then filed the underlying action, seeking to collect a â€œlossâ€ from the Warehouse Receipts Guaranty Fund.Â  SCDA filed a motion for summary judgment, arguing Respondents failed to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to bringing suit in circuit court.Â  Circuit Court Judge Diane Goodstein denied the motion. \r\nThe Honorable Luke Brown, acting as special referee, heard the claim.Â  At the hearing, McMillan and Griner each testified regarding their transactions with the warehouse and the broker.Â  Both maintained they never sold the cotton to the broker, but merely received an advance.Â  Each asserted ownership should not have been transferred to the broker.\r\nAdditionally, Louie Conder, former director of the warehouse system, testified extensively regarding the receipts issued to the broker and whether the receipts were proper under the statute or the regulations.Â  He also testified Respondents had not been paid the full amount for their cotton.\r\nThe referee found Respondents had not transferred ownership of the cotton to the broker and the receipts were not valid.Â  The referee concluded Respondents demonstrated a â€œlossâ€ under section 39-22-15 and were entitled to recover the 20 percent still owed for the cotton.Â  He also found Respondents were entitled to recover pre-judgment interest and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nSCDA filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 52(b), SCRCP. The referee denied SCDAâ€™s requested relief.Â  He found the action was not an appeal from an administrative decision, and Respondents were not required to exhaust administrative remedies.Â  Finally, the referee set the award of attorneyâ€™s fees to Respondents.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Exhaustion of Administrative Remedies\r\nSCDA contends the referee erred in finding Respondents were not required to exhaust their administrative remedies prior to filing suit in circuit court for damages.Â  Additionally, SCDA maintains because section 22 of Article I of the South Carolina Constitution provides due process and requires an opportunity for an individual to be heard, Respondents still had administrative remedies that could be pursued.Â  We disagree and find nothing requiring Respondents to exhaust administrative rights prior to bringing this action in circuit court.\r\nFirst, this issue is not preserved for review on appeal.Â  A party must raise the issue of the exhaustion of administrative remedies and receive a ruling by the trial court in order to preserve it for review on appeal.Â \r\nFood Mart v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 322 S.C. 232, 233, 471 S.E.2d 688, 688 (1996).Â  â€œA denial of a motion for summary judgment does not establish the law of the case, and the issues raised in the motion may be raised later in the proceedings.â€Â  Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 416, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\nWhile SCDA raised the issue in a summary judgment motion prior to trial, the issue was never raised to the referee until SCDA made its motion to alter or amend under Rule 52(b), SCRCP.Â  Accordingly, the issue is not preserved because it cannot be raised for the first time in a motion to alter or amend.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€). \r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provides for judicial review of a contested case after agency action upon the partyâ€™s exhaustion of administrative remedies.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (2005).Â  Pursuant to section 1-23-310(3) of the South Carolina Code: â€œâ€˜Contested caseâ€™ means a proceeding including, but not restricted to, ratemaking, price fixing, and licensing, in which the legal rights, duties, or privileges of a party are required by law to be determined by an agency after an opportunity for hearing.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(3) (2005).\r\nThis court explicated:\r\n\r\nâ€œThe doctrine of exhaustion of administrative remedies only comes into play when a litigant attempts to invoke the original jurisdiction of a circuit court to adjudicate a claim based on a statutory violation for which the legislature has provided an administrative remedy.â€Â  Med. Mut. Liab. Ins. Soc. of Md. v. B. Dixon Evander &amp; Assocs., 92 Md. App. 551, 609 A.2d 353 (1992).Â  A litigant need not exhaust administrative remedies where â€œthere are no administrative remedies for the wrongs it assertedly suffered.â€Â  Id. at 360.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThomas Sand Co. v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 413, 563 S.E.2d 109, 115 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nIn the instant case, a statutory procedure does not exist to provide an administrative remedy.Â  There is no â€œcontested caseâ€ for which the provisions of the APA would apply.Â  As additional proof of the lack of remedies, the denial by the director of SCDA does not point to any further administrative avenues available to Respondents.Â  The director of SCDA suggests bankruptcy or other legal proceedings may be available to Respondents.Â  The denial does not mention the availability of an appeal or subsequent hearing of any type.Â  Accordingly, as there are no administrative remedies set forth and available to Respondents, they should not be barred from bringing this action in circuit court.\r\nSection 22 of Article I of the South Carolina Constitution states:\r\n\r\nNo person shall be finally bound by a judicial or quasi-judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private rights except on due notice and an opportunity to be heard; nor shall he be subject to the same person for both prosecution and adjudication;Â  nor shall he be deprived of liberty or property unless by a mode of procedure prescribed by the General Assembly, and he shall have in all such instances the right to judicial review.\r\n\r\nS.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 22.\r\nIn discussing Section 22 of Article I, the South Carolina Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\nIn recognition of the increasing number of governmental powers delegated to administrative agencies, South Carolina Constitution article I, Â§ 22 was added to the 1895 Constitution in 1970 â€œas a safeguard for the protection of liberty and property of citizens.â€Â  Final Report of the Committee to Make a Study of the South Carolina Constitution of 1895, p. 21 (1969).\r\n. . . \r\nWe have interpreted this provision as specifically guaranteeing persons the right to notice and an opportunity to be heard by an administrative agency, even when a contested case under the APA is not involved.Â  Stono River EPA v. Department of Health and Environmental Control, 305 S.C. 90, 406 S.E.2d 340 (1991).Â  \r\n\r\nRoss v. Med. Univ. of South Carolina, 328 S.C. 51, 68, 492 S.E.2d 62, 71 (1997).\r\nRespondents filed a claim with SCDA, which was ultimately denied.Â  Respondents have not claimed a violation of their due process rights under section 22 of Article I.Â  Nor have they asserted they were deprived of notice or an opportunity to be heard.Â  They have brought suit seeking to collect money damages owed pursuant to a statutorily created reimbursement fund.Â  It does not appear section 22 of Article I was intended to be used by the agency to force a claimant to proceed under the Administrative Procedures Act when the agency does not have a procedure in place.Â  Accordingly, we find the referee properly determined Respondents were not required to exhaust any additional administrative remedies prior to brining suit in circuit court.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Type of Action\r\nSCDA asserts the referee failed in determining the type of action involved in the underlying case.Â  The SCDA avers the action is an appeal from an administrative agency or an action under the Tort Claims Act and not an action for money damages.Â  We find the issue is not preserved for review on appeal and, on the merits, the action would be in the nature of a declaratory judgment action or an action for money damages under a statute.\r\nThis issue was never raised to the referee for a ruling or a determination prior to the courtâ€™s issuance of its final order.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  Additionally, the first time it was raised to the court was in SCDAâ€™s motion to alter or amend.Â  It is not appropriate to raise an issue for the first time in a Rule 52(b) motion that could have been raised at trial.Â  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.â€). \r\nAs discussed above, this case is not a continuation of an administrative process.Â  There is no provision in the code or the regulations allowing for administrative hearings or requiring the Warehouse Receipts Guaranty Fund to follow the APA.Â  Thus, SCDAâ€™s argument that this case is nothing more than an appeal of an administrative decision is without merit.\r\nAdditionally, this case does not fall within the auspices of the Tort Claims Act, section 15-78-10 of the South Carolina Code (2005).Â  â€œThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available in an action against the government.â€Â  Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, 404, 523 S.E.2d 204, 206 (Ct. App. 1999) (emphasis added).Â  This is not a case in which Respondents brought suit based upon the governmentâ€™s negligence or to redress a tort committed by SCDA.Â  They are bringing a suit to collect monetary damages pursuant to a section of the South Carolina Code, which establishes the fund to pay those damages.Â  Therefore, the trial court did not err in finding the appeal was not covered by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.\r\nWhile section 39-22-15 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004) does not specifically authorize a suit to collect money owed from the fund, it is clear the only means of redress would be a cause of action against the Warehouse Guaranty Fund for monetary damages or a declaratory judgment action.Â  Accordingly, we find the underlying action is an action to collect monetary damages pursuant to statute, which authorizes the payment for a â€œloss.â€\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Loss\r\nSCDA contends Respondents failed to prove they suffered a loss as a result of having cotton stored with the warehouse.Â  SCDA maintains Respondentsâ€™ loss is the result of the bankruptcy of the broker and not in any way connected to the storage of the cotton at the warehouse.Â  We disagree.\r\nAccording to section 39-22-15 of the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\nFor purposes of this chapter, â€œlossâ€ means any monetary loss over and beyond the amount protected by a warehousemanâ€™s bond sustained as a result of storing a commodity in a state-licensed warehouse including, but not limited to, any monetary loss over and beyond the amount protected by a warehousemanâ€™s bond sustained as a result of the warehousemanâ€™s bankruptcy, embezzlement, or fraud.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-22-15 (Supp. 2004).\r\nRespondents each stored cotton in the warehouse at the time it declared bankruptcy.Â  At that time, Respondents had each been paid an 80 percent advance by the broker and were waiting to sell their cotton to collect the remaining 20 percent.Â  SCDA claims the loss was the result of the bankruptcy of the broker and not of the warehouse.Â  SCDA asserts any additional payment to Respondents would have been from the broker.Â  However, this ignores the fact that the warehouse also declared bankruptcy, thereby preventing Respondents from selling their cotton, whether through the broker or in any other fashion.\r\nSection 39-22-15 only requires the parties to have suffered a loss â€œas a result of storing a commodity in a state-licensed warehouse.â€Â  This occurred when the warehouse declared bankruptcy and Respondents were unable to sell their cotton for an appropriate price to recover the remaining 20 percent owed to them after their advance.Â  Accordingly, we find Respondents demonstrated they suffered a loss compensable under section 39-22-15.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Receipts\r\nSCDA contends the referee erred in finding Respondentsâ€™ cotton was not sold to the broker.Â  SCDA asserts the court erred in relying upon section 39-22-200 of the South Carolina Code and Regulation 5-493 to find the receipts issued by the warehouse were invalid and no transfer of the cotton occurred.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 39-22-200 of the South Carolina Code states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nA state warehouse receipt must be issued by the warehouseman to a person storing commodities who requests it. . . . No receipt may be issued in the name of the storing warehouse, or its owners, on commodities being purchased by the warehouse until the commodity has been paid for in full, even if a contract has been executed establishing that the title to the commodity has passed to the warehouse or its owners unless the buyer and seller execute an affidavit within the contract stating that the seller conveys title and ownership of the commodity and forfeits all of his rights under the Dealer and Handler Guaranty Fund.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 39-22-200 (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  Additionally, regulation 5-493 provides:\r\n\r\nG. A warehouse receipt shall not be issued in the name of the purchaser of any commodity being purchased on a deferred-price, delayed payment or similar credit-type sale arrangement until the seller has received payment for the commodity in full unless he has executed the affidavit relinquishing title and ownership to the buyer and forfeiting his rights under the Dealers and Handlers Guaranty Fund and has fully complied with the requirements set out in Section 39-22-200.\r\n\r\n23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 5-493(G) (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  Finally, the definition of â€œcommodityâ€ is contained in regulation 5-490:\r\n\r\nG. â€œCommodityâ€ means:\r\n(1) Cotton.\r\n(2) â€œNon-perishable farm productâ€ as defined by definition (F) or which may hereafter be included in this special definition.\r\n\r\n23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 5-490(G) (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).\r\nâ€œThe words of a statute or regulation â€˜must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its operation.â€™â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 563, 590 S.E.2d 338, 355 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992)); see also Ferguson v. Charleston Lincoln Mercury, Inc., 349 S.C. 558, 563, 564 S.E.2d 94, 97 (2002) (â€œWhen the statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous, there is no room for an alternate construction, and courts must apply them according to their literal meaning.â€).\r\nInitially, we disagree with SCDAâ€™s contention that section 39-22-200 has no application in this case.Â  Although the section applies to â€œcommodities being purchased by the warehouse,â€ the circumstances of this case come within the ambit of that limitation.Â  Griner testified that David Prosser was a broker with the Hampton County Warehouse, but was also the principal in Sea Island Cotton Trading Company.Â  A review of the articles of incorporation for both entities confirms Prosserâ€™s dual involvement.Â  Thus, even though the receipts in this case were issued to the broker and not the warehouse, that alone not would not preclude the application of section 39-22-200 given the Hampton County Warehouse and Sea Island Cotton Trading Company were essentially the same entity.Â  Applying the requirements of section 39-22-200, we find the transfer from the Hampton County Warehouse was invalid given payment had not been made in full and the requisite affidavit conveying title and ownership of the cotton was not executed.Â  \r\nFurthermore, regulation 5-493 does not limit the purchaser to the warehouse.Â  It expressly states: â€œA warehouse receipt shall not be issued in the name of the purchaser of any commodity being purchased on a deferred-price, delayed payment or similar credit-type sale arrangement until the seller has received payment for the commodity in full.â€Â  As defined in regulation 5-490, cotton is a commodity and would be covered by regulation 5-493.Â  \r\nSCDA maintains because regulation 5-493 requires the waiver of rights under the Dealer and Handler Guaranty Fund, and not the Warehouse Guaranty Fund, it should not be applicable.Â  While it does reference the rights under one fund and not the other, there is nothing limiting it to claims under the Dealer and Handler Guaranty Fund.Â  The first portion states very clearly how the regulation is to apply, and it explicitly prohibits issuing a receipt in the name of any purchaser of any commodity unless the seller has received full payment.Â  See Ferguson, 349 S.C. at 563, 564 S.E.2d at 97Â  (â€œWhen the statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous, there is no room for an alternate construction, and courts must apply them according to their literal meaning.â€).\r\nThe receipts in the instant case were issued in the name of the broker, even though Respondents had not received full payment from the broker.Â  Accordingly, under section 39-22-200 and regulation 5-493, the receipts were improperly issued and were not evidence of a sale of the cotton to the broker.Â  Additionally, refusal to provide payment from the fund on the ground that the receipts were not issued in Respondentsâ€™ name is not proper.Â  Accordingly, we find the referee correctly concluded the receipts were invalid and ownership of the cotton remained with Respondents based upon the amounts they placed in the warehouse respectively.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Pre-judgment Interest\r\nSCDA asserts the referee erred in awarding Respondents pre-judgment interest.Â  SCDA avers pre-judgment interest must be specifically pled, and Respondents failed to properly plead a claim for pre-judgment interest.Â  In addition, SCDA contends Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend the pleading was not sufficient to raise the claim.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œIn all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (1987). Pre-judgment interest must be specifically pled in order to be recovered.Â  Hopkins v. Hopkins, 343 S.C. 301, 307, 540 S.E.2d 454, 458 (2000); Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 102, 529 S.E.2d 14, 18 (2000).Â Â  â€œIf no request for pre-judgment interest is made in the pleadings, it cannot be recovered on appeal.â€Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 375, 585 S.E.2d 292, 299 (2003).Â  \r\nRule 15(b), SCRCP, governs amendments to conform to the evidence.Â  â€œThe rule covers two situations.Â  First, if an issue not raised by the pleadings is tried by express or implied consent of the parties the court may permit amendment of the pleadings to reflect the issue.Â  Second, if a party objects to the introduction of evidence as not being within the pleadings the court may permit amendment of the pleadings subject to a right to grant a continuance if necessary.â€Â  Sunvillas Homeowners Assâ€™n, v. Square D Co., 301 S.C. 330, 334, 391 S.E.2d 868, 870-71 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nIn the instant case, there is no dispute Respondents failed to ask for pre-judgment interest in their complaints.Â  The dispute is whether their motion to amend the complaint to conform to the evidence was sufficient to properly raise the issue. \r\nAt trial, when Respondents attempted through Grinerâ€™s testimony to enter into evidence the issue of pre-judgment interest, SCDA objected.Â  After the objection the court indicated:Â  â€œAll right.Â  Iâ€™ll look at [the complaint].Â  Go ahead.Â  And Iâ€™ll note your objection.â€Â  Nothing further was ever ruled upon by the court.Â  During McMillanâ€™s testimony, interest was mentioned a second time.Â  However, it was a vague reference to the amount was owed.Â  In addition, SCDA did not specifically object to the comment. \r\nAt the end of trial, Respondents stated:Â  â€œI was just going to move to amend our pleadings to conform to any evidence to the extent thereâ€™s evidence outside, you know, that - - but I donâ€™t think there is.â€Â  The court responded:Â  â€œWell, I took the position that it asked for everything.Â  I read your part of the complaint.â€ Â No objection was made by SCDA. \r\nWe do not find the motion made by Respondents was sufficient to properly amend the complaint to include a claim for pre-judgment interest, which must be specifically pled in order to be recovered.Â  The motion was extremely general and not completely clear.Â  Additionally, in making the motion, Respondentsâ€™ counsel indicated he does not believe there is any evidence outside the complaint when he moves to â€œconform to any evidence to the extent thereâ€™s evidence outside, you know, that - - but I donâ€™t think there is.â€ (Emphasis added.)Â  Accordingly, we find this motion was insufficient to properly raise the issue of pre-judgment interest.Â  Because the issue was not pled in the complaint, nor included within the motion to amend, we find the referee erred in awarding pre-judgment interest.Â  Tilley, 355 S.C. at 375, 585 S.E.2d at 299.Â  \r\nVI.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nFinally, SCDA asserts the referee erred in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees because the statute does not provide for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We disagree and find the award appropriate.\r\nWe agree the statute does not specifically provide for recovery of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  However, the code section does not explicitly exclude the attorneyâ€™s fees as a â€œlossâ€ to be recovered.Â  In the instant case, we need not determine whether attorneyâ€™s fees would be included as a â€œlossâ€ under section 39-22-15, because we find attorneyâ€™s fees are collectible under section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nSection 15-77-300 provides in part:\r\n\r\nIn any civil action brought by . . . any party who is contesting state action, . . ., the court may allow the prevailing party to recover reasonable attorneyâ€™s fees to be taxed as court costs against the appropriate agency if:\r\n(1) The court finds that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim against the party; and\r\n(2) The court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 (2005).\r\nâ€œOn appeal, the trial judgeâ€™s decision regarding an award of attorneyâ€™s fees under this statute will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€ Jasper County Bd. of Educ. v. Jasper County Grand Jury, 303 S.C. 49, 51, 398 S.E.2d 498, 499 (1990).\r\nWe find Respondents are clearly the prevailing parties in this action.Â  Thus, we must determine whether they have shown SCDA acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim and no special circumstances exist to make the award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust. \r\nIn Heath v. County of Aiken, 302 S.C. 178, 394 S.E.2d 709 (1990), the supreme court held â€œsubstantial justification,â€ for the purposes of this statute, means justified to a degree that could satisfy a reasonable person.Â  Heath, 302 S.C. at 183, 394 S.E.2d at 712.Â  â€œAn agency action supported by substantial justification is one which has a reasonable basis in law and fact.â€ McDowell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., 304 S.C. 539, 542, 405 S.E.2d 830, 832 (1991) (citing Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552 (1988)).Â Â  \r\nIn determining whether there was substantial justification in this case, we look to the substance and outcome of the underlying matter.Â  We find SCDA was without substantial justification in denying recovery from the Warehouse Guaranty Fund and in claiming Respondents must pursue administrative remedies that are not in place.Â  We see no reason or circumstance to declare the award of attorneyâ€™s fees unjust.Â  Accordingly, we find the award of attorneyâ€™s fees by the referee was proper under section 15-77-300.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the referee properly concluded this was an action for money damages pursuant to a statute and Respondents were not required to pursue any additional administrative remedies prior to bringing suit under section 39-22-15.Â  Additionally, we find the trial court properly concluded there was no sale of the cotton from Respondents to the broker, and Respondents proved they suffered a loss as a result of storing the cotton at the warehouse.Â  Therefore, we conclude the award of the remaining 20 percent was proper.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees was also justified under section 15-77-300.Â  However, we find the award of pre-judgment interest was improper when it was not properly pled and Respondentsâ€™ motion to amend did not specifically include the claim for pre-judgment interest.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the referee is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBecause Hughsie Trowellâ€™s claim was paid in full, he is not a party in this appeal.\r\n[2]Â Â  Hampton County Warehouse and Sea Island Cotton Trading Company were both owned by David Prosser. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3964","title":"Jones v.

Jones (Jones) initiated this action against State Farm Automobile Insurance Company (State Farm) seeking a declaration that his 1986 Mazda pickup truck was covered under a State Farm policy at the time he was involved in an automobile collision.Â  The trial judge entered summary judgment in favor of State Farm, finding that State Farm had cancelled coverage on the 1986 Mazda prior to the accident.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAs late as November of 1999, State Farm provided insurance for three of Jonesâ€™s vehicles, including the 1986 Mazda pickup truck.Â  However, on November 5, 1999, State Farm sent a cancellation notice informing Jones that effective November 24, 1999, coverage of the 1986 Mazda would be cancelled due to nonpayment of premiums. \r\nOn December 19, 1999, Jones was seriously injured in a motor vehicle collision with Arthur W. Campbell.Â  Jones had been driving the 1986 Mazda.Â  Sometime after the accident, Jonesâ€™s State Farm agent signed a Form FR-10 which stated: â€œI hereby affirm that to the best of my knowledge the vehicle described above was insured by State Farm insurance company on the date and time of the accident.â€Â Â Â  \r\nJonesâ€™s medical bills exceeded $200,000.Â  After settling with Campbellâ€™s liability carrier, Jones sought a declaration that (1) the 1986 Mazda was covered by State Farm at the time of the collision, (2) he was entitled to $50,000 of underinsured motorist coverage on the Mazda, and (3) he was entitled to stack $50,000 of underinsured motorist coverage from each of the two additional vehicles covered by State Farm.Â  State Farm moved for summary judgment, claiming the policy had been cancelled. \r\nThe trial judge ruled that State Farm was entitled to summary judgment because State Farmâ€™s cancellation notice complied with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-120 (1985), and the Form FR-10 did not affect the cancellation. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  White v. J.M. Brown Amusement Co., 360 S.C. 366, 601 S.E.2d 342 (2004); B &amp; B Liquors, Inc. v. Oâ€™Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 603 S.E.2d 629 (Ct. App. 2004); Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied.Â  In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the evidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Medical Univ. of South Carolina v. Arnaud, 360 S.C. 615, 602 S.E.2d 747 (2004); Rife v. Hitachi Const. Mach. Co., Ltd., Op. No. 3936 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 28, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 48).Â  Summary judgment is appropriate where the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Belton v. Cincinnati Ins. Co., 360 S.C. 575, 602 S.E.2d 289 (2004); McCall v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 359 S.C. 372, 597 S.E.2d 181 (Ct. App. 2004); Trivelas v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 348 S.C. 125, 558 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment has the burden of clearly establishing the absence of a genuine issue of material fact.Â  McCall, 359 S.C. at 376, 597 S.E.2d at 183. Once the party moving for summary judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support for the opponentâ€™s case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations or denials contained in the pleadings.Â  Regions Bank v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 582 S.E.2d 432 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Rather, the nonmoving party must come forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004); Peterson v. West American Ins. Co., 336 S.C. 89, 518 S.E.2d 608 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\n  The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder.Â  Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 580 S.E.2d 433 (2003); Rumpf v. Massachusetts Mut. Life Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 386, 593 S.E.2d 183 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Because it is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked to ensure that a litigant is not improperly deprived of a trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Helena Chem. Co. v. Allianz Underwriters Ins. Co., 357 S.C. 631, 594 S.E.2d 455 (2004); Hawkins v. City of Greenville, 358 S.C. 280, 594 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 2004); Murray v. Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 S.E.2d 743 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nThe determination of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  City of Myrtle Beach v. Juel P. Corp., 344 S.C. 43, 543 S.E.2d 538 (2001); Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995); Goldston v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 358 S.C. 157, 594 S.E.2d 511 (Ct. App. 2004); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Johnson v. Pratt, 200 S.C. 315, 20 S.E.2d 865 (1942) (acknowledging that statutory construction is the province of the courts); Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 21 S.E.2d 34 (1942) (noting that the interpretation of the meaning of a statutory term is not a finding of fact).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Requirements of Â§ 38-77-120\r\nJones argues the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment to State Farm because the cancellation notice mailed to Jones did not comply with the requirements of South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-120 (2002).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 38-77-120 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(a)Â  No cancellation . . . is effective unless the insurer delivers or mails to the named insured at the address shown in the policy a written notice of the cancellation . . . .Â  This notice:\r\n  \r\n(1) must be approved as to form by the director or his designee before use;\r\n(2) must state the date not less than fifteen days after the date of the mailing or delivering on which the cancellation or refusal to renew becomes effective;\r\n(3) must state the specific reason of the insurer for cancellation . . . and provide for the notification required by subsection (B) of Section 38-77-390 . . . . \r\n(4) must inform the insured of his right to request in writing within fifteen days of the receipt of notice that the director review the action of the insurer. . . . \r\n(5) must inform the insured of the possible availability of other insurance which may be obtained through his agent, through another insurer, or through the Associated Auto Insurers Plan.Â  It must also state that the Department of Insurance has available an automobile insurance buyerâ€™s guide regarding automobile insurance shopping and availability, and provide applicable mailing addresses and telephone numbers, including a toll-free number, if available, for contacting the Department of Insurance. \r\n  \r\nNothing in this subsection prohibits any insurer or agent from including in the notice of cancellation . . . , any additional disclosure statements required by state or federal laws, or any additional information relating to the availability of other insurance.Â  The insurer must disclose in writing whether the insured is ceded to the facility.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. (2002) (emphasis added).Â  The language at the center of this logomachy is the last sentence of Â§ 38-77-120(a)â€”â€œThe insurer must disclose in writing whether the insured is ceded to the facility.â€Â  State Farm concedes it did not notify Jones that he was not being ceded to the Reinsurance Facility and contends Â§ 38-77-120 does not require it to do so.\r\n A.Â  Rules of Statutory Interpretation Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to determine the intent of the legislature.Â  Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds. v. County of Aiken, 354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gordon v. Phillips Utils. Inc., Op. No. 25930 (S.C. filed January 24, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 44) (â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain legislative intent.â€); Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 205, 544 S.E.2d 38, 44 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe quintessence of statutory construction is legislative intent.â€).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998); State v. Morgan, 352 S.C. 359, 574 S.E.2d 203 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Hudson, 336 S.C. 237, 519 S.E.2d 577 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language of the statute.Â  State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Stephen v. Avins Const. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The language must also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.Â  Hitachi Data Sys. v. Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 420 S.E.2d 843 (1992); Morgan, 352 S.C. at 366, 574 S.E.2d at 206; Hudson, 336 S.C. at 246, 519 S.E.2d at 582.Â  The courtâ€™s primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.Â  Smith v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 350 S.C. 82, 564 S.E.2d 358 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œOnce the legislature has made [a] choice, there is no room for the courts to impose a different judgment based upon their own notions of public policy.â€Â  South Carolina Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\nIf a statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous and clear, there is no need to employ the rules of statutory construction and this Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 585 S.E.2d 292 (2003); Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995); Cowan v. Allstate Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 626, 631, 571 S.E.2d 715, 717 (Ct. App. 2002); Olson, 344 S.C. at 207, 544 S.E.2d at 45; see also City of Camden v. Brassell, 326 S.C. 556, 561, 486 S.E.2d 492, 495 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of the statute is clear and explicit, the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not in the legislature's language.â€).Â  When the terms of a statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.Â  Cooper v. Moore, 351 S.C. 207, 212, 569 S.E.2d 330, 332 (2002); Holley v. Mount Vernon Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 320, 440 S.E.2d 373 (1994); Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 523 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Bayle v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 344 S.C. 115, 542 S.E.2d 736 (Ct. App. 2001). The words of a statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction.Â  Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998); Adkins v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323 S.C. 409, 475 S.E.2d 762 (1996); Worsley Cos. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.

An ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and equitable operation of the law.Â  Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at 582; Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Dep't v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. 371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  In construing a statute, the court looks to the language as a whole in light of its manifest purpose.Â  State v.

AT &amp; T Communications of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 606 S.E.2d 468 (2004) (observing that the language of a statute must be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose).Â  \r\nCourts will reject a statutory interpretation which would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.Â  Unisun Ins.

United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 440 S.E.2d 364 (1994).Â  A court should not consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.Â  See Hinton v. South Carolina Dept. of Prob., Parole and Pardon Servs., 357 S.C. 327, 592 S.E.2d 335 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Jan. 12, 2005); Doe v. Roe, 353 S.C. 576, 578 S.E.2d 733 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. denied. \r\nB.Â  Interpretation of Â§ 38-77-120\r\nThe â€œfacilityâ€ referred to in Â§ 38-77-120 is the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility (the Facility) created by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-510.Â  â€œThe South Carolina Reinsurance Facility . . . is a nonprofit organization which enables automobile insurers to obtain reinsurance for high risk drivers which they normally would not insure.â€Â  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Lindsay, 288 S.C. 327, 328, 342 S.E.2d 599, 599 (1986).Â  The Facility is soon to be defunct, however, due to Act. No. 154 Â§ (1997), which repealed Â§Â§ 38-77-510 through -640 effective January 1, 2006.Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-590(g), â€œA producer designated under this section may not write new private passenger and commercial automobile insurance business to be placed in the facility after March 1, 1999.Â  A policy with an effective date after March 1, 2002 shall not be accepted by the facility.â€Â  S.C. Code Â§Â§ 38-91-10 through â€“420 created the Joint Underwriting Association to temporarily replace the Facility as the primary residual market mechanism from March 1, 1999 through February 28, 2003.Â  See Note, Lifting the Iron Curtain of Automobile Insurance Regulation, 49 S.C.L.Rev. 1193, 1207 (Summer 1998).Â  Currently, the Associated Auto Insurers Plan serves as the residual market mechanism.Â  S.C. Code Ann. 38-77-810 through â€“880 (2002). See generally Maybank et al., The Law of Automobile Insurance in South Carolina I-74 â€“ I-98 (4th ed. 2000); Lifting the Iron Curtain, 49 S.C.L.Rev. 1193.\r\nUndisputedly, Â§ 38-77-120 required an insurance company to notify an insured when he or she had been ceded to the Facility.Â  This requirement served to notify the insured that he or she had been deemed a high-risk driver subject to recoupment charges.Â  See Lifting the Iron Curtain, 49 S.C.L.Rev. n.167 (noting that former Â§ 38-77-600 set a recoupment fee to cover operating losses the Facility incurred during the preceding year).Â  However, State Farm contends, and we agree, that an insurer is not required to inform the insured he or she has not been ceded to the Facility.Â  We do not believe that Jonesâ€™s specious construction of Â§ 38-77-120 comports with the intent of that section.Â  \r\nSection 38-77-120 serves to put on notice drivers whose policies are being cancelled or will not be renewed.Â  In subsection (a), the statute sets forth five mandates aimed at giving the insured adequate notice of the cancellation of his or her policy.Â  The notice must: (1) be approved by the Director; (2) state the effective date of cancellation; (3) state the reason for cancellation; (4) inform the insured of his right to request review of the termination; and (5) provide the insured with information regarding other available sources of insurance.Â  State Farm mailed a complying cancellation notice on November 5, 1999â€”approximately forty days before the December 19 accident.Â  Jones does not contest that State Farm notified him of the cancellation of his policy.Â  \r\nJonesâ€™s rendering of the statute would require disclosure of a non-eventâ€”i.e., that he has not been deemed a high risk driver; therefore he will not be ceded to the Facility; and he will not be subject to recoupment fees.Â  Such an interpretation of Â§ 38-77-120 is not a practical and reasonable interpretation consistent with the design of the legislature.Â  Instead, Jonesâ€™s interpretation would â€œlead to a result so plainly absurd it could not have been intended by the legislature.â€Â  Unisun, 339 S.C. at 368, 529 S.E.2d at 283.Â  Jones states no rationale supporting a policy of requiring an insurance company to inform insureds they are not being ceded to an organization designed to facilitate the acquisition of insurance for high-risk drivers.Â  \r\nMoreover, the sentence at issue is not one of the five enumerated mandates, but is provided in the flush paragraph at the end of the subsection.Â  The penultimate sentence of subsection (a) informs insurers that they are not prevented from providing additional information in the notice.Â  The sentence in controversy then gives one piece of additional information that must be provided.Â  Although the placement of the controverted sentence does not dictate our decision, the sentenceâ€™s location does suggest the legislature did not consider the final sentence of subsection (a) as significant as the enumerated directives.Â  \r\nConsidering the content of the sentence; the purpose of the statute; and the placement of the sentence, we hold, as a matter of law, that State Farm was not required to notify Jones that he had not been ceded to the Facility.Â  \r\nII.Â  Effect of Form FR-10 \r\nJones asserts the trial judge erred in granting summary judgment because the FR-10 form signed by his insurance agent raised factual issues as to the existence of coverage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFirst, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  In his memorandum in opposition to summary judgment, and in his argument to the trial judge, Jones simply asserted that the Form FR-10 created an issue of fact.Â  He did not set forth a concomitant legal theory which would entitle him to recovery based on the FR-10.Â  Jones did not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  For the first time on appeal, Jones contends the Form FR-10 estops State Farm from denying coverage.Â  \r\nAn issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 359 S.C. 505, 598 S.E.2d 712 (2004); United Student Aid Funds, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtâ€™l Control, 356 S.C. 266, 588 S.E.2d 599 (2003); Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000); Austin v. Specialty Transp. Services, Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 594 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2004); see also QZO, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 594 S.E.2d 485 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting it is axiomatic than an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal).Â  An issue is not preserved where the trial court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  Hawkins v. Mullins, 359 S.C. 497, 597 S.E.2d 897 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Jones did not present an estoppel argument to the trial judge; therefore, this issue is not preserved. \r\nSecond, as to the merits, we find the trial judge properly granted summary judgment.Â  In a light most favorable to Jones, the FR-10 did not raise an issue as to the validity of State Farmâ€™s cancellation notice.Â  The form simply states â€œto the best of my knowledge the vehicle described above was insured by State Farm insurance company on the date and time of the accident.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  State Farm presented evidence that Jones, in fact, was not insured by State Farm at the time of the accident because his policy had been cancelled weeks earlier.Â  Jones cites no legal authority establishing that a policy, once effectively canceled, can somehow become renascent by virtue of a qualified representation of coverage by an agent after a loss.Â  \r\nEven if Jonesâ€™s estoppel argument were properly preserved, he presented no evidence demonstrating his ability to establish the elements of estoppel.Â  In Provident Life &amp; Acc. Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 451 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. App. 1994), we observed that â€œ[u]nder South Carolina law, the essential elements of estoppel are divided between the estopped party and the party claiming estoppel.â€Â  Id. at 477, 451 S.E.2d at 928 (citations omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nAs to the estopped party, the essential elements are: (1) conduct amounting to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or conduct calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, the partyâ€™s subsequent assertions; (2) intention or expectation that such conduct be acted upon by the other party; and (3) actual or constructive knowledge of the real facts.Â  As to the party claiming estoppel, the essential elements are: (1) lack of knowledge or the means of acquiring, with reasonable diligence, knowledge of the true facts; (2) reasonable reliance on the other partyâ€™s conduct; and (3) a prejudicial change in position.\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).Â  Accord Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Associates, 340 S.C. 98, 531 S.E.2d 287 (2000).Â  Jones did not present evidence that State Farm made a knowingly false representation with the intent to induce Jones into action.Â  Further, Jones failed to submit evidence that he did not have notice of the cancellation, and that he detrimentally relied on the Form FR-10. \r\nIn Bannister v. Ohio Cas. Ins. Co., 314 S.C. 388, 444 S.E.2d 528 (Ct. App. 1994), the appellant argued, â€œOhio Casualty is estopped to deny coverage because an FR-10 form was executed by one of the companyâ€™s agents.â€Â  Id. at 393, 444 S.E.2d at 531.Â  We rejected the appellantâ€™s argument, finding he â€œha[d] not demonstrated any of the elements of estoppel.â€Â  Id.Â  Similarly, Jones has failed to demonstrate any of the elements of estoppel in the instant case.Â  \r\nJones has not presented to this Court a reviewable argument, based on the Form FR-10, that would compel reversal of the trial judgeâ€™s grant of summary judgment.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-120 does not require an insurer to notify an insured that he or she has NOT been ceded to the South Carolina Reinsurance Facility.Â  Further, the Form FR-10 did not create an issue of fact which could have entitled Jones to the relief he sought.Â  The trial judge correctly granted summary judgment in favor of State Farm.Â  Accordingly, the decision is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3965","title":"State v.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Amie L. Clifford, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: In this appeal from a criminal case, Appellant Karen Ann McCall argues that her conviction should be overturned on the ground that the State should be judicially estopped from prosecuting her.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2000, John Richard Wood left the scene of an incident in Greenville County[1] on a moped scooter, weaving through heavy traffic.Â  Wood then rode behind a building, parked the scooter and got into a Jeep driven by McCall.Â  The Jeep sped off with McCall at the wheel and witnesses called the police with the Jeepâ€™s license tag number.Â  Wood and McCall fled to Anderson County where authorities located and followed them before a high-speed chase ensued.Â  The Jeepâ€™s back window rolled down and Wood fired several rounds of shots at police with a gun owned by McCall, resulting in a bullet fragment striking an officer in the head.Â  Subsequently, the Jeep rammed into a van and veered into oncoming traffic, and Wood carjacked a pickup truck. Wood and McCall continued fleeing from the police.Â  The chase ultimately ended in a standoff in which Wood was also shot.Â  \r\nA trial of Wood was held in Greenville County and McCall was not named as a defendant.Â  She testified that she had acted under duress, arguing essentially that Wood coerced her into assisting him through threats with the gun as well as with physical force.Â  The State offered her no grant of immunity, nor made any promises or deals in order to obtain this testimony.Â  \r\nSubsequently in Anderson County, McCall was charged with, among other things, criminal conspiracy.Â  At a pretrial hearing, McCall moved to quash the indictments, arguing that because the State called her as a witness in the Greenville trial and allowed her to testify she acted under duress, the State should be judicially estopped from prosecuting her as a co-conspirator in the Anderson case.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding McCallâ€™s testimony in Greenville largely self-serving.Â  \r\nAfter a joint trial with co-defendant Wood, where McCall asserted the defense of duress in keeping with her testimony in Greenville, the jury convicted her of criminal conspiracy, failure to stop when signaled by a law enforcement vehicle, resisting arrest with a deadly weapon, armed robbery, three counts of assault with intent to kill, one count of assault and battery with intent to kill, and one count of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.Â  The circuit court sentenced McCall to prison for twenty-five years.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  This court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSouth Carolina officially recognized the doctrine of judicial estoppel in Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 251, 489 S.E.2d 472, 477 (1997).Â  â€œJudicial estoppel precludes a party from adopting a position in conflict with one earlier taken in the same or related litigation.â€Â  Id.Â  The purpose of judicial estoppel is to protect the integrity of the courts, not to protect litigants from allegedly improper or deceitful conduct by their adversaries.Â  Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 42, 577 S.E.2d 202, 208 (2003); see also Quinn v. Sharon Corp., 343 S.C. 411, 540 S.E.2d 474 (Ct. App. 2000) (Anderson, J., concurring) (providing a thorough discussion of the history, purpose, and application of judicial estoppel).Â  Judicial estoppel in South Carolina generally applies only to inconsistent statements of fact, not inconsistent positions of law.Â  Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 82-83, 552 S.E.2d 767, 771 (Ct. App. 2001). \r\nThe elements of judicial estoppel are as follows: (1) two inconsistent positions taken by the same party or parties in privity with one another; (2) the positions are taken in the same or related proceedings involving the same party or parties in privity with one another; (3) the party taking the position must have been successful in maintaining that position and received some benefit; (4) the inconsistency must be part of an intentional effort to mislead the court; and (5) the two positions must be totally inconsistent.Â  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215-16, 592 S.E.2d 629, 632 (2004).Â  \r\nSouth Carolina courts have not addressed the applicability of judicial estoppel in criminal cases. Â To date, all cases involving judicial estoppel have arisen in the civil context, although one court considered applying judicial estoppel in a civil case based on a prior guilty plea.Â  Carrigg, 347 S.C. at 84, 552 S.E.2d at 772 (holding that judicial estoppel did not apply based on lack of privity).Â  North Carolina has recently rejected the use of judicial estoppel in criminal cases.Â  See Whitacre Partnership v. Biosignia, Inc., 591 S.E.2d 870 (N.C. 2004) (providing extensive discussion of the doctrine and holding that judicial estoppel applies only in civil cases). \r\nWe need not reach the issue of whether judicial estoppel applies in criminal cases, however, because even if the doctrine applied, McCallâ€™s case fails to meet the required elements.Â  The purpose of judicial estoppel would not extend to cases such as this one.Â  Nothing in the Stateâ€™s conduct would impinge on the integrity of the courts.Â  McCall was simply permitted to testify in the prior proceeding as a fact witness. \r\nSecondly, judicial estoppel would not apply here because the allegedly contradictory positions involve issues of law.Â  The facts are undisputed.Â  McCall is simply arguing that the State impliedly acknowledged the validity of her defense of duress in the prior case.Â  Additionally, since McCall was not charged in Greenville, a separate judicial circuit from Anderson, the State had no reason to challenge her testimony.Â  Thirdly, the privity requirement is not met.Â  The Greenville case was against Wood and McCall was only a witness.Â  As the trial judge noted, although both cases involved the same incident involving McCall and Wood, the State did not have the same motive to cross-examine McCall. \r\nFinally, there is absolutely no evidence that the allegedly contradictory positions were taken in a deliberate attempt to mislead the court.Â  See Cothran, 357 S.C. at 217, 592 S.E.2d at 632 (requiring some evidence of intent to mislead).Â  The trial judge noted â€œas a fact witness, Ms. McCallâ€™s purpose was obviously to link the primary defendant, Mr. Wood, to the crimes in Greenville County.â€Â  â€œThe doctrine of judicial estoppel . . . should be applied sparingly, with clear regard for the facts of the particular case.â€Â  Id.Â  Judicial estoppel â€œmust not be applied to impede the truth-seeking function of the court.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe think the application of judicial estoppel in a case such as this one would impede the truth-seeking function of the court.Â  McCallâ€™s testimony was necessary in Woodâ€™s trial for purposes unrelated to her case.Â  Estopping the State from later prosecuting McCall would have the effect of unduly limiting the prosecutionâ€™s ability to seek justice.Â  Thus, without reaching the issue of whether judicial estoppel applies in South Carolina in criminal cases, we hold that McCall has failed to make out a case for judicial estoppel.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of McCallâ€™s motion to quash the indictments.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  See State v.

Lanier (Husband) entered into a divorce settlement agreement which the family court incorporated into its final order of divorce.Â  Wife appeals the family courtâ€™s denial of her Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP motion for relief from the final order.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHusband and Wife, who had been married since 1984, were divorced in March of 2003.Â  Wife alleges that prior to their marriage, the parties entered into an antenuptial agreement (the agreement) in which Husband released his marital rights in Wifeâ€™s property if they divorced.Â  During the course of the marriage, the agreement was lost.Â  Wife searched for the document when she initiated the proceeding.Â  She checked with Husband, her bank (where the document had been stored), and her financial advisor, but her search was not successful.Â  However, several months after the family court entered its final order, Wife found a copy of the agreement folded in a greeting card in her desk drawer.Â  \r\nThe content of the agreement was not pled in the original action for divorce.Â  After she found the agreement, Wife filed a motion for relief from the judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  The family court heard the matter and denied the motion.Â  On appeal, Wife argues that the requested relief should have been granted because the agreement qualified as newly discovered evidence.Â  Additionally, she disputes the family courtâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, Op. No. 3932 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 31, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 48); Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 603 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Rutherford v.

App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v.

App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  An appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence on child custody for that of the trial court.â€&nbsp; Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  Our broad scope of review does not relieve appellant of her burden to convince this Court the family court committed error.&nbsp; Skinner v. King, 272 S.C. 520, 522-23, 252 S.E.2d 891, 892 (1979).\r\nA party seeking to set aside a judgment pursuant to Rule 60(b) has the burden of presenting evidence entitling him to the requested relief.Â  Perry v. Heirs at Law of Gadsden, 357 S.C. 42, 590 S.E.2d 502 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œThe decision to grant or deny a motion under Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 151, 591 S.E.2d 654, 656 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 413 S.E.2d 15 (1992)); see also Saro Invs. v. Ocean Holiday Pâ€™ship, 314 S.C. 116, 441 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1994) (noting that Rule 60(b) motions are addressed to the discretion of the court and appellate review is limited to determining whether the trial court abused its discretion).Â  Review is thus limited to determining whether the family court abused its discretion in granting or denying the motion.Â  Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 18, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004); Bowman at 151, 591 S.E.2d at 656.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Rule 60(b)(2) Motion\r\nWife argues she is entitled to relief from the judgment under Rule 60(b)(2).Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Propriety of Attacking a Consent Judgment Through a Rule 60(b) Motion\r\nAs a preliminary matter, we address whether a consent judgment may be attacked via a Rule 60(b) motion.Â  Husband argues that consent orders are â€œbinding and conclusive and cannot be attacked by the parties either on direct appeal or in a collateral proceeding.â€Â  See Johnson v. Johnson, 310 S.C. 44, 46, 425 S.E.2d 46, 48 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Although this is the general rule, consent judgments are subject to attack in particular circumstances, including for the reasons specified in Rule 60(b).Â  See Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 18 n.3, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482 n.3 (2004) (â€œ[E]ven consent judgments are subject to attack under particular circumstances.â€).Â  Indeed, the Johnson court ultimately granted relief under Rule 60(b)(5).Â  Id.; Johnson, 310 S.C. at 47, 425 S.E.2d at 48.Â  Additionally, consent orders could be vacated under the statutory predecessor to Rule 60.Â  See Lord Jeff Knitting Co., Inc. v. Mills, 281 S.C. 374, 376, 315 S.E.2d 377, 378 (Ct. App. 1984) (acknowledging availability of relief but refusing it on other grounds).Â  Therefore, we find no error in the family courtâ€™s decision to consider Wifeâ€™s motion on the merits.Â  Â \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Rule 60(b)(2)\r\nThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply in family court when no family court rule provides otherwise.Â  Rule 2, SCRFC.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, reads:\r\n\r\nOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  . . . . \r\n\r\nThis rule is substantially the same as the federal rule.Â  See Rule 60, SCRCP, note Â¶ 1; Thynes v. Lloyd, 294 S.C. 152, 363 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n C.Â Â Â Â Â  Elements for Obtaining a New Trial Under Rule 60(b)(2)\r\nTo obtain a new trial based on newly discovered evidence, a movant must establish that the newly discovered evidence: \r\n\r\n(1) will probably change the result if a new trial is granted; (2) has been discovered since the trial; (3) could not have been discovered before the trial; (4) is material to the issue; and (5) is not merely cumulative or impeaching.\r\n\r\nJames F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 484 (2nd ed. 1996) (citing Johnston v. Belk-McKnight Co., 188 S.C. 149, 198 S.E. 395; McCabe v. Sloan, 184 S.C. 158, 191 S.E. 905 (1937)); see Lans v.

Prac. &amp; Proc. Civ. 2d Â§ 2859 (1995) (noting the standard applied to newly discovered evidence is the same for Rule 59(b) and Rule 60(b)(2), and discussing the elements); 12 Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§ 60.42[2] (Matthew Bender 3rd ed.) (discussing various elements tests for Rule 60(b)(2)).\r\n D.Â Â Â Â Â  Newly Discovered Evidence \r\nFirst, we note that courts have found evidence is not newly discovered evidence for the purposes of Rule 60(b)(2) where the evidence was (1) known to the party at the time of trial, and (2) in the partyâ€™s possession.\r\n\r\n 1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Known to the Party at the Time of Trial\r\n\r\nIn Lans v. Gateway 2000, Inc., 110 F.Supp.2d 1 (D.D.C. 2000), the movant, Lans, made a Rule 60(b)(2) motion based on a â€œClarification-Contractâ€ which he found after trial.Â  Lans knew the document existed prior to trial, but was unable to locate it.Â  The Lans court stated:\r\n\r\nLans even admits that he had knowledge of the Clarification-Contract prior to the Courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Gateway. . . . [T]he Court cannot conceive of why Lans failed to notify the Court of the potential existence of the Clarification-Contract and request more time to search for it. . . . Rule 60(b)(2) was not designed to afford parties the opportunity to revisit choices made in the thick of litigation.Â  Since Lans knew of the Clarification-Contractâ€™s existence, he cannot now claim that it is newly discovered evidence.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 5.Â  See also Andrews Distrib. Co. v. Oak Square at Gatlinburg, Inc., 757 S.W.2d 663, 667 (Tenn. 1988) (finding that when both parties know an item of evidence existed before trial, but the evidence is simply lost or misplaced, finding it afterward does not transform it into newly discovered evidence), overruled on other grounds by Spence v. Allstate Ins. Co., 883 S.W.2d 586 (Tenn. 1994).Â  \r\nWe find the instant case analogous to Lans.Â  Wife was well aware the agreement existed; yet, she did not plead its contents or otherwise inform the court of the documentâ€™s potential application.Â  Instead, she chose to initiate this action and negotiate a property settlement without asserting any potential rights which the agreement might have afforded her.Â  Consequently, the agreement was not newly discovered.\r\n\r\n 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  In the Possession of the Party\r\n\r\nThe Lans court addressed whether evidence can be newly discovered when it is in the movantâ€™s possession.Â  The court observed that â€œthe Clarification-Contract was in Lansâ€™s possession, even if he could not recall its physical location.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the evidence was deemed not newly discovered:\r\n\r\n[T]his Court has previously held that evidence â€œin the possession of the party before the judgment was rendered . . . is not newly discovered evidence that affords relief.â€Â  American Cetacean Socâ€™y v. Smart, 673 F.Supp. 1102, 1106 (D.D.C. 1987) (Richey, J.).Â  See Coastal Transfer Co. v. Toyota Motor Sales, U.S.A., 833 F.2d 208, 211-12 (9th Cir. 1987) (evidence that is somehow in possession of a party at time of trial may not be â€œdiscoveredâ€); see also Longden v. Sunderman, 979 F.2d 1095, 1103 (5th Cir. 1992) (misplaced evidence is not newly discovered evidence); Taylor v. Texgas Corp., 831 F.2d 255, 259 (11th Cir. 1987) (party may not â€œdiscoverâ€ after trial evidence that was within knowledge of employees at time of trial). \r\n\r\nId.Â  â€œFurthermore,â€ the Lans court noted, the evidence â€œturned up in the possession of [Lansâ€™s] accountant.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the court went on to explain that â€œdocuments in the possession of a partyâ€™s agent, such as an attorney or accountant, are deemed to be in the partyâ€™s possession because the party retains control over the documents.â€Â  Id. (citations omitted).Â  See also Longden v. Sunderman, 979 F.2d 1095, 1103 (5th Cir. 1992) (finding presence of the missing document in appellantâ€™s files prior to the hearing alone sufficient to deny the Rule 60(b)(2) motion).Â  \r\nWife admits that the agreement was in her possession and was ultimately found in her desk drawer.Â  Because she both knew of and possessed the agreement prior to trial, we find this evidence does not constitute newly discovered evidence for the purpose of Rule 60(b)(2).Â  \r\n E.Â Â Â Â Â  Exercise of Due Diligence\r\nFinally, even if the agreement did constitute newly discovered evidence, the family court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to grant a new trial under Rule 60(b)(2) where: (1) Wife knew of the agreement prior to trial, (2) Wife did not plead the agreement, and (3) the agreement was in Wifeâ€™s possession and control prior to trial, but was only later discovered in a desk drawer. \r\nRule 60(b)(2) allows the court to grant a new trial only if the newly discovered evidence could not have been discovered by due diligence prior to trial.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œdue diligenceâ€ as â€œ[t]he diligence reasonably expected from, and ordinarily exercised by, a person who seeks to satisfy a legal requirement or to discharge an obligation.â€Â  Id. at 468 (7th ed. 1999).Â  â€œDiligence looks not to what the litigant actually discovered, but what he or she could have discovered.â€Â  12 Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice Â§ 60.42[5] (Matthew Bender 3rd ed.).Â  \r\nWhen evidence is misplaced, a party must make a specifically targeted search to find the missing evidence.Â  See Lans, 110 F. Supp. 2d at 6 (â€œ[W]hatever actions [the appellant] took to locate the [evidence] are undermined by the plain fact that [he] knew that the [evidence] existed, regardless of whether he could actually get his hands on it.Â  The Court is unsympathetic to arguments that [he] could not remember where [it] was.â€).Â  Where a litigant could have discovered the new evidence prior to trial, he or she is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b)(2).Â  Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 21, 594 S.E.2d 478, 484 (2004) (citing Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 591 S.E.2d 654, (Ct. App. 2004)).Â  When a party simply misplaces evidence at home, the court will treat the failure to discover it as a failure to exercise due diligence.Â  Johnson Waste Materials v. Marshall, 611 F.2d 593, 598-99 (5th Cir. 1980).Â  Here, Wife eventually found the agreement in a desk drawer in her home.Â  Cognizant of our standard of review, we are unable to find an abuse of discretion where Wife could have located the agreement by conducting a more thorough search of the desk drawer.Â  \r\nIn Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 591 S.E.2d 654, (Ct. App. 2004), this Court held that â€œSouth Carolinaâ€™s strong policy towards finality of judgments trumps a partyâ€™s ability to set aside a judgment where, as here, the party could have discovered the evidence prior to trial.â€Â  Id. at 152, 591 S.E.2d at 657.Â  Similarly, when a party is on notice that evidence exists and settles the case without further inquiry, relief under Rule 60(b) is unavailable.Â  Raby Constr., 358 S.C. at 22-23, 594 S.E.2d at 484.Â  \r\nWe recognize that in some out-of-state cases new trials were allowed when lost documents were subsequently found.Â  See Wasem v. Ellens, 4 N.W.2d 850 (S.D. 1942); Misel v. Cottonwood Live Stock &amp; Loan Co., 205 N.W. 663 (S.D. 1925); Zarneke v. Kitzman, 183 N.W. 867 (S.D. 1921); Waite v. Fish, 95 N.W. 928 (S.D. 1903); Askew v. Gaskins, 151 S.E. 539 (Ga. Ct. App. 1930); The Protection Life Ins. Co. v. Dill, 91 Ill. 174 (Ill. 1878); Winfield Bldg. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. McMullen, 53 P. 481 (Kan. 1898).Â  However, most of these cases sounded in equity and were decided before the advent of Rule 60(b).Â  Additionally, in all of the cases cited, existence of the lost document was alleged at trial.Â  When the documents were found, the courts held that the original documents themselves were material and not merely cumulative of other evidence as to their contents. Thus, retrials were merited.Â  In contrast, Wife did not allege the existence of the agreement at all and made no attempt to recreate any of its contents before settling the case.Â  \r\nIn light of this Stateâ€™s strong policy emphasizing finality of judgments, we hold the family court correctly concluded that Wife is not entitled to relief under Rule 60(b).Â  Because we find the evidence was not newly discovered for Rule 60(b) purposes, and the requisite due diligence was not exercised to find it, we affirm the family courtâ€™s refusal to grant Wife a new trial.\r\nII.Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nThe family court is authorized by statute to order attorneyâ€™s fees to either party in a divorce action.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-3-120 and -130 (1985); Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988).Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees is at the sound discretion of the family court.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, Op. No. 3920 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 10, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 3 at 57) (citing Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 368 S.E.2d 901).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court should consider: (1) the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee; (2) the beneficial results obtained by counsel; (3) the respective financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 415 S.E.2d 812 (1992); Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, Op. No. 3932 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 31, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 48); Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324, 536 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Our supreme court has identified the following factors for determining a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee: (1) the nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) professional standing of counsel; (4) contingency of compensation; (5) beneficial results obtained; and (6) customary legal fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991); Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nWife requested that â€œ[i]f this Court reverses the family court on Issue I, then it should accordingly reverse the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.â€Â  Because we affirm the family courtâ€™s denial of Wifeâ€™s Rule 60(b)(2) motion, we concomitantly affirm the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the family court is hereby \r\n AFFIRMED.

denying his motion for a directed verdict; (2) giving an inadequate jury charge on mere presence; and (3) failing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Antwanâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nGregory McDonald, also know as Boobie, was murdered on January 19, 2001, near a trailer on Land Fill Road in Orangeburg County.Â  On the night of the murder, McDonald traveled to the trailer with Larry Zeigler, George Zeigler, and Barry Collier.Â  Troy Zeigler, his cousin Antwan Zeigler, James Hallman, Germaine Eric Hallman, and Kenneth Kirk Thomas were already inside the trailer when McDonald arrived.\r\nAccording to Collier, when he entered the trailer, Antwan looked at him as if Collier had â€œdone something bad.â€Â  Because Antwan and Troy were whispering to each other and staring at him, Collier began to feel uncomfortable and decided to exit the trailer.Â  Antwan and Troy attempted to prevent Collier from leaving.Â  Antwan and Troy followed Collier outside.Â  Collier stated he â€œfelt unsafe.â€Â  At that point, Antwan and Troy threw â€œone or twoâ€ beer bottles at Collier.Â  Collier jumped in his vehicle and drove away.\r\nKenneth Kirk Thomas testified Antwan entered the trailer and â€œtold Boobie he was the police,â€ meaning McDonald was working for the police as a confidential informant.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans surrounded McDonald.Â  George Zeigler, Troy and Antwanâ€™s cousin, declared Antwan â€œtold [McDonald] he had to leaveâ€ and that Antwan and McDonald â€œgot into an argument.â€Â  Thomas observed Antwan throw a beer bottle at McDonald.Â  Larry Zeigler, Troyâ€™s brother and Antwanâ€™s cousin, saw Troy and Eric Hallman hit McDonald.Â  George testified he â€œthought that [Antwan] . . . thr[e]w a punch.â€Â  When McDonald attempted to leave, Troy and the Hallmans threw bottles at him.Â  McDonald ran out of the trailer onto Land Fill Road.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans followed McDonald.\r\nApproximately ten to fifteen minutes later, Antwan, Troy and the Hallmans had not returned.Â  Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler decided to leave.Â  As the men were leaving the trailer, Thomas saw Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer from about twenty feet away.Â  When Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler reached â€œthe end of the road,â€ they noticed McDonaldâ€™s body lying facedown on the side of the road.Â  McDonald was not moving.Â  George asked Thomas to stop the car so they could help McDonald.Â  Thomas refused to help and instructed George: â€œDonâ€™t get yourself in nothing.â€\r\nThomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler drove to the Zeiglersâ€™ grandmotherâ€™s house.Â  Antwan and Troy arrived at the home after the others.Â  Thomas testified Troy said: â€œI kicked that nigger to death.â€Â  Antwan responded: â€œHe deserved it.â€Â  Thomas noted Troy was walking with a limp and that he thought Troyâ€™s toe was swollen.\r\nThe police, acting on a tip, located McDonaldâ€™s body in a ditch near the trailer on Land Fill Road.Â  Dr. Janice Ross, a forensic pathologist, performed the autopsy on McDonald.Â  McDonald had suffered injuries to his eyeballs and both sides of his head, had bruising under the scalp, and bleeding around the brain.Â  Dr. Ross opined McDonald died from â€œbleeding around the brain . . . due to a beating.â€Â  McDonald died â€œwithin minutesâ€ from this severe beating.Â  Dr. Ross testified the type of injuries sustained by McDonald allowed her to discount an assertion that the injuries were caused by McDonald falling down or being struck by a car.Â  Dr. Ross concluded McDonaldâ€™s injuries were a result of â€œblows delivered by someone else.â€Â  She stated the injuries were consistent with â€œwhat [sheâ€™s] seen caused by fists.â€Â  The Solicitor asked Dr. Ross: â€œWould [McDonaldâ€™s injuries] also have been consistent with him being kicked?â€Â  Dr. Ross answered: â€œIt could.â€\r\nAntwan and Troy were indicted for the murder of McDonald.Â  The case proceeded to trial.Â  At the close of the Stateâ€™s evidence, counsel for Antwan moved for a directed verdict, claiming there was â€œabsolutely no evidence to connect either of these defendants with the murder of Mr. McDonald.â€Â  Troyâ€™s attorney adopted Antwanâ€™s lawyerâ€™s argument.Â  The State argued the evidence showed â€œAntwan Zeigler started an altercation in the trailer, hit the deceased, threw a bottle at him, and chased him out of the trailer,â€ along with Troy Zeigler.Â  The trial court denied the motion, finding â€œthe fact that they left right after the victim did, came back without him, very shortly thereafter the body was seen, and weâ€™ve got . . . statements that . . . one of them kicked him and the other one said he deserved it, would be strong enough circumstantial evidence to make it a jury case.â€\r\nThe jury found both Troy and Antwan guilty of murder.Â  They were each sentenced to forty-five years.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in denying Antwanâ€™s motion for a directed verdict?\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court give a proper and correct instruction on mere presence?\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Did the trial court err in refusing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Antwanâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  DIRECTED VERDICT\r\nAntwan contends the trial court erred in denying his motion for a directed verdict because â€œthere was not any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence that [Antwan] killed [McDonald].â€Â  Antwan maintains his mere presence at the scene was insufficient to prove his guilt in the murder.Â  He asserts the â€œevidence against [him] only raised a suspicion of his guilt, and he was convicted based on that suspicion.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nA.Â  Standard of Review\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a directed verdict in a criminal case, an appellate court must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State.Â  State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 591 S.E.2d 600 (2004); State v. Crawford, Op. No. 3933 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 31, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 68); State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence or nonexistence of evidence, not its weight.Â  Sellers v.

App. 2003).\r\nIf there is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593-94, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Follin, 352 S.C. 235, 573 S.E.2d 812 (Ct. App. 2002); see also State v. Horton, 359 S.C. 555, 598 S.E.2d 279 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting judge should deny motion for directed verdict if there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove accusedâ€™s guilt, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  When a motion for a directed verdict is made in a criminal case in which the State relies exclusively on circumstantial evidence, the trial judge is required to submit the case to the jury if there is any substantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.Â  State v. Walker, 349 S.C. 49, 562 S.E.2d 313 (2002); State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 555 S.E.2d 402 (2001); Al-Amin, 353 S.C. at 411, 578 S.E.2d at 35; see also State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000) (stating trial court has duty to submit case to jury where evidence is circumstantial, if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove guilt of accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced).Â  On the other hand, a defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 593, 606 S.E.2d at 478; Horton, 359 S.C. at 563, 598 S.E.2d at 284; State v. Padgett, 354 S.C. 268, 580 S.E.2d 159 (Ct. App. 2003). \r\nThe trial judge should grant a directed verdict when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty.Â  State v. Arnold, 361 S.C. 386, 605 S.E.2d 529 (2004); State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984).Â  â€œSuspicionâ€ implies a belief or opinion as to guilt based upon facts or circumstances which do not amount to proof.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Lollis, 343 S.C. 580, 541 S.E.2d 254 (2001).Â  However, a trial judge is not required to find that the evidence infers guilt to the exclusion of any other reasonable hypothesis.Â  Cherry, 361 S.C. at 594, 606 S.E.2d at 478; State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d 851 (1996).\r\nThe appellate court may reverse the trial judgeâ€™s denial of a motion for a directed verdict only if there is no evidence to support the judgeâ€™s ruling.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).\r\nB.Â  Definitional Analysis of Murder\r\nSouth Carolina law defines murder as â€œthe killing of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-10 (2003); Sellers v. State, 362 S.C. 182, 607 S.E.2d 82 (2005).Â  Malice is the wrongful intent to injure another and indicates a wicked or depraved spirit intent on doing wrong.Â  State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).\r\nAny person who is present at a homicide, aiding and abetting, is guilty of the homicide as a principal, even though another does the killing.Â  State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188 S.E.2d 379 (1972); State v. Griggs, 184 S.C. 304, 192 S.E. 360 (1937).Â  Mere presence at the scene of a crime is insufficient to convict one as a principal on the theory of aiding and abetting.Â  State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987); State v. Condrey, 349 S.C. 184, 562 S.E.2d 320 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nAntwan relies on State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000), arguing â€œ[t]here is less evidence against the two appellants in this case than there was against the defendantâ€ in Martin.Â  This reliance is misplaced as Martin is inapposite.\r\nIn Martin, the supreme court found the trial court erred in failing to grant the defendantâ€™s motion for directed verdict because there was a total lack of evidence, either direct or circumstantial, linking the defendants to the murder.Â  In that case, the State was unable to establish a time of death of the victim, lacked any witnesses identifying the defendants at the scene of the crime at the time of the murder, and had no evidence of the defendants being in the victimâ€™s apartment any time after the victim was last seen.Â  The Martin court inculcated:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the State failed to meet the â€œany substantial evidenceâ€ standard.Â  Most significantly, the Stateâ€™s evidence failed to place either defendant inside the apartment.Â  The Solicitor himself summed up the Stateâ€™s failure of proof by confessing to the trial judge â€œwe donâ€™t know which person actually held [Victimâ€™s] head in that pan of waterâ€ and â€œYour Honor, the whole point is we donâ€™t know if they acted in concert.â€Â  Put another way, unlike the usual accomplice liability case or aiding and abetting situation, here the State had no proof that either defendant held Victimâ€™s head under water and the State had no proof that the defendants were working together to bring about the Victimâ€™s death.\r\nTaken in a light most favorable to its position, the State has shown that a car resembling the one in possession of the Defendant was parked at the Victimâ€™s apartment complex the night the murder was committed.Â  There is no evidence (such as a license tag number) that the black car was actuallyÂ  [defendantâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s] black mustang.Â  The State also presented no evidence that both defendants arrived at the apartment complex in that car or that either defendant entered Victimâ€™s apartment.Â  Furthermore, there is no evidence establishing the death occurred during the time the black car was in front of the building.\r\nThis case is similar to State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984), in which this Court reversed the denial of a directed verdict in a murder conviction.Â  In Schrock, the State presented evidence the defendant was in the area of the murders and that footprints at the scene of the crime were similar to footprints found in the area in which Schrock admitted he had been walking.Â  In this case, the black car seen at the apartment is not identified as [the defendantâ€™s girlfriendâ€™s] car.Â  Like the footprints in Schrock, the possibility that it was the same car, without any other evidence placing the defendants at the scene, is not enough evidence to place Defendant inside Victimâ€™s apartment.\r\n\r\nMartin, 340 S.C. at 602-03, 533 S.E.2d at 574-75.Â  In contrariety to the present case, there was virtually no evidence linking the defendants in Martin to the drowning death of the victim.\r\nC.Â  Evidentiary Record\r\nIn the instant case, the record provides substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove Antwanâ€™s guilt.Â  Viewed in the light most favorable to the State, there was substantial circumstantial evidence to submit the murder charge to the jury.Â  Antwan accused McDonald of working for the police and told him he had to leave the trailer.Â  Antwan and McDonald then â€œgot into an argument.â€Â  Thomas saw Antwan throw a beer bottle at McDonald.Â  Larry Zeigler observed Troy and Eric Hallman hit McDonald.Â  George Zeigler stated he â€œthought that [Antwan] . . . thr[e]w a punch.â€Â  When McDonald attempted to leave, Troy and the Hallmans threw bottles at him.Â  McDonald ran out of the trailer onto Land Fill Road.Â  Troy, Antwan, and the Hallmans pursued McDonald.Â  Approximately ten to fifteen minutes later, when Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler decided to leave the trailer, Antwan, Troy and the Hallmans had not returned.Â  As the three men left the trailer, Thomas noticed Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer from about twenty feet away.Â  At â€œthe end of the road,â€ Thomas, Larry Zeigler, and George Zeigler observed McDonaldâ€™s body lying motionless facedown on the side of the road.Â  Importantly, there was a specific window of about ten to fifteen minutes from the time (1) McDonald ran out of the trailer; (2) he was chased by Troy and Antwan; (3) he suffered a severe beating; (4) Thomas saw Antwan and Troy walking back up the dirt road toward the trailer; and (5) McDonald was seen lying motionless on the side of the road.Â  The pathologist confirmed McDonald died â€œwithin minutesâ€ from bleeding around the brain due to a beating.Â  Later that night, at the Zeiglersâ€™ grandmotherâ€™s house, Troy informed Thomas: â€œI kicked that nigger to death.â€Â  Antwan then stated: â€œHe deserved it.â€Â  Thomas noted Troy was limping and that he thought Troy had a swollen toe.\r\nThe trial judge did not err in denying Antwanâ€™s motion for a directed verdict on the charge of murder.\r\nII.Â  JURY CHARGE\r\nAntwan asserts the trial court â€œerred by refusing to give a proper mere presence charge.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the conclusion of the judgeâ€™s charge to the jury, Antwanâ€™s attorney complained: â€œYour Honor, you mentioned something about being merely present in with the hand of one is the hand of all theory but I didnâ€™t hear the mere presence theory that I was expecting to hear, as far as a charge, and we would ask that you charge the mere presence.â€Â  The judge denied the request and found the charge he had given was sufficient.\r\nGenerally, the trial judge is required to charge only the current and correct law of South Carolina.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594 S.E.2d 462 (2004); State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 565 S.E.2d 298 (2002); see also State v. Buckner, 341 S.C. 241, 534 S.E.2d 15 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding jury charge is proper if, as a whole, it is free from error and reflects current and correct law of South Carolina).Â  In reviewing jury charges for error, we must consider the courtâ€™s jury charge as a whole in light of the evidence and issues presented at trial.Â  State v. Adkins, 353 S.C. 312, 577 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  If, as a whole, the charges are reasonably free from error, isolated portions which might be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991); State v. Jackson, 297 S.C. 523, 377 S.E.2d 570 (1989).\r\nA jury charge is correct if, when the charge is read as a whole, it contains the correct definition and adequately covers the law.Â  In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001); State v. Johnson, 315 S.C. 485, 445 S.E.2d 637 (1994); see also State v. Burton, 302 S.C. 494, 397 S.E.2d 90 (1990) (charge is sufficient if, when considered as a whole, it covers law applicable to case).Â  The substance of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303; State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994); Adkins, 353 S.C. at 318-19, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nA jury charge which is substantially correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 440 S.E.2d 869 (1994).Â  To warrant reversal, a trial judgeâ€™s refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial to the defendant. Â State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000); Adkins, 353 S.C. at 319, 577 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nThe mere presence charge was sufficient.Â  To be guilty as an aider or abettor, the participant must have knowledge of the principalâ€™s criminal conduct.Â  State v. Leonard, 292 S.C. 133, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987).Â  Mere presence at the scene is not sufficient to establish guilt as an aider or abettor.Â  Id. at 137, 355 S.E.2d at 272; State v. Johnson, 291 S.C. 127, 352 S.E.2d 480 (1987); State v. Green, 261 S.C. 366, 200 S.E.2d 74 (1973).\r\nThe trial court gave the following jury instruction in regard to mere presence:\r\n\r\nThe mere knowledge that another person is going to commit a crime, even if the defendant is present when the crime is committed is not sufficient to convict the defendant as a principal.Â  Guilt is shown by active or constructive presence at the scene, and the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt by competent evidence the theory of the hand of one is the hand of all.Â  A principal in a crime is one who either actually commits the crime or who is present, aiding, abetting or assisting in the commission of the crime.Â  When a person does an act in the presence of and with the assistance of another, the act is done by both.Â  Where two or more acting with a common plan or intent [are] present at the commission of a crime, it does not matter who actually commits the crime, all are guilty.Â  The hand of one is the hand of all.Â  Present means to be sufficiently near to aid and abet and assist in the commission of the crime.Â  Intent is also a necessary element, for there must have been a common design or intent to commit the crime, and the crime must have been committed pursuant to that plan, with the person aiding and abetting by some overt act. \r\n\r\nThe charge in the case sub judice adequately apprises the jury as to the law regarding mere presence.Â  The charge contains the correct definition for mere presence and adequately covers the law.\r\nAdditionally, Antwan claims the charge was not sufficient because it did not track the jury instruction given in State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 502 S.E.2d 63 (1998).Â  This argument is without merit.Â  The substance of the law is what must be charged to the jury, not any particular verbiage.Â  See Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303.Â  Because the trial judge adequately charged the jury as to the law of mere presence, we need not look to the particular verbiage used in giving the instruction.\r\nIII.Â  JUROR MISCONDUCT\r\nAntwan alleges the trial court erred in finding he failed to present any evidence regarding juror misconduct that would warrant sworn juror testimony or a new trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal, the denial of a new trial motion will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Kelly, 331 S.C. 132, 502 S.E.2d 99 (1998); State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 447 S.E.2d 175 (1993).Â  A denial of a new trial based on alleged jury misconduct is reviewed for an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Covington, 343 S.C. 157, 539 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of juror misconduct.Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104.Â  Unless the misconduct affects the juryâ€™s impartiality, it is not such misconduct as will affect the verdict.Â  State v. Grovenstein, 335 S.C. 347, 517 S.E.2d 216 (1999); Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104.\r\nThe general test for evaluating alleged juror misconduct is whether there in fact was misconduct and, if so, whether any harm resulted to the defendant as a consequence.Â  State v. Smith, 338 S.C. 66, 525 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Where a defendant seeks a new trial on the basis of juror misconduct, he is required to prove both the alleged misconduct and the resulting prejudice.Â  State v. Galbreath, 359 S.C. 398, 597 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 2004); see also State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999) (a defendant must demonstrate prejudice from jury misconduct in order to be entitled to a new trial).Â  Misconduct of a juror is a fact to be determined by the trial judge from the circumstances of each case.Â  Smith, 338 S.C. at 71, 525 S.E.2d at 266.Â  \r\nIn a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free from all extraneous or improper influences.Â  Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104; see also State v. Salters, 273 S.C. 501, 257 S.E.2d 502 (1979) (finding a defendant in a criminal prosecution is constitutionally guaranteed a fair trial by an impartial jury and, in order to fully safeguard this basic protection, it is required that the jury render its verdict free from outside influences).\r\nInitially, the trial judge must make a factual determination as to whether juror misconduct has occurred.Â  See Smith, 338 S.C. at 71, 525 S.E.2d at 266; see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 315, 509 S.E.2d at 815 (holding where affidavits supporting juror misconduct are credible, the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if misconduct occurred).Â  â€œOnly if the trial court finds a juror is guilty of misconduct must the judge determine whether the misconduct affected the verdict, warranting a new trial.â€Â  Covington, 343 S.C. at 164, 539 S.E.2d at 70.\r\nAs a general rule, juror testimony is inadmissible to impeach a jury verdict.Â  State v. Hunter, 320 S.C. 85, 463 S.E.2d 314 (1995).Â  Normally, courts should not intrude into the privacy of the jury room to scrutinize how jurors reached their verdict.Â  Id.Â  Traditionally, a jurorâ€™s testimony was not admissible to prove either his own misconduct or the misconduct of other jurors.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 405, 597 S.E.2d at 848.Â  However, Rule 606(b), SCRE, altered this common law rule, and now, juror testimony regarding external prejudicial information or improper outside influence is allowed.Â  Rule 606(b) provides:\r\n\r\nUpon an inquiry into the validity of a verdict or indictment, a juror may not testify as to any matter or statement occurring during the course of the juryâ€™s deliberations or to the effect of anything upon that or any other jurorâ€™s mind or emotions as influencing the juror to assent to or dissent from the verdict or indictment or concerning the jurorâ€™s mental processes in connection therewith, except that a juror may testify on the question whether extraneous prejudicial information was improperly brought to the juryâ€™s attention or whether any outside influence was improperly brought to bear upon any juror.Â  Nor may a jurorâ€™s affidavit or evidence of any statement by the juror concerning a matter about which the juror would be precluded from testifying be received for these purposes.\r\n\r\nThus, juror testimony or affidavits are admissible to prove an allegation of extraneous information or influence.Â  See State v. Franklin, 341 S.C. 555, 534 S.E.2d 716 (Ct. App. 2000); see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 310, 509 S.E.2d at 812 (juror testimony or affidavits are generally admissible in the case of an extraneous influence); Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316 (juror testimony may normally be used when an extraneous influence is alleged).Â  External influence on a jury involves situations where jurors receive information during deliberations from some outside source.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 405, 597 S.E.2d at 848.Â  The judge noted that no extraneous influence was present in the case at bar.Â  In addition, Antwan concedes the misconduct alleged in this case is internal juror misconduct.\r\nIf the alleged misconduct is internal, as we have in this matter, courts are more strict.Â  Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316.Â  Internal influences involve information coming from the jurors themselves.Â  Galbreath, 359 S.C. at 406, 597 S.E.2d at 849.Â  Until 1995, the prohibition against juror testimony regarding allegations of internal jury misconduct remained intact.Â  In State v. Hunter, our supreme court carved out an exception to this rule, holding that juror testimony is competent in cases involving internal misconduct where necessary to ensure due process, i.e., fundamental fairness.Â  Id.; see also Aldret, 333 S.C. at 312, 509 S.E.2d at 813 (finding premature jury deliberations may affect fundamental fairness of a trial such that the trial court may inquire into such allegations and may consider juror affidavits in support of such allegations); Ex Parte Greenville News, 326 S.C. 1, 482 S.E.2d 556 (1997) (stating juror testimony regarding internal misconduct is generally inadmissible to impeach a verdict except when necessary to ensure fundamental fairness); Hunter, 320 S.C. at 88, 463 S.E.2d at 316 (noting jurorâ€™s testimony was properly considered as basis for impeaching jury verdict, where juror claimed racial prejudice played role in determining defendantâ€™s guilt).Â  In State v. Franklin, the court of appeals held:\r\n\r\n[W]e emphasize that the exception to the general rule against review of internal jury deliberations carved out in Hunter is a narrow one, limited by our supreme court to those few situations which implicate due process raising a question of fundamental fairness. . . . But the integrity of the jury system is jeopardized any time a court finds it necessary to intrude into the internal deliberation process.Â  Such an inquiry should not be lightly made.\r\n\r\nFranklin, 341 S.C. at 562, 534 S.E.2d at 720.\r\nAfter a three-day trial, the judge submitted the case to the jury.Â  On the second morning of deliberations, the jury sent the trial court a note, asking: â€œIs it a possibility that the defendants go under oath and tell their side of the story?â€Â  After a brief discussion with counsel for Antwan and Troy, the trial court instructed: â€œ[W]e cannot receive new evidence at this time.Â  Please remember that you should not consider the fact that defendants did not testify.â€Â  Counsel for Antwan and Troy concurred in the instruction.Â  The jury resumed deliberations and returned a guilty verdict as to both defendants.Â  Attorneys for Antwan and Troy moved for a new trial, arguing the jury â€œmade it clear that they were considering things that [the trial court] specifically instructed them not to consider when they sent out the note saying that they wanted testimony from the defendants.Â  Clearly, they were considering whether the defendants testified or not.â€Â  The trial court denied the motion.\r\nLawyers for both Antwan and Troy filed a joint motion to impeach the verdict, take sworn testimony of jurors, and for a new trial.Â  At the hearing, it was argued that the jurors â€œwere basing their verdict, many of them, on the fact that the Zeiglers did not testify.â€Â  The trial court considered the statements taken from the jurors by investigators hired by the Zeiglers, even though the statements were not sworn affidavits.Â  The court ruled: â€œI just donâ€™t see any evidence that this jury made its decision based on an improper consideration of the defendants failing to testify.â€\r\nInitially, we note that at the end of the trial the judge gave a detailed charge to the jury instructing them not to consider the fact that the defendants did not testify:\r\n\r\nBecause the defendant, ladies and gentlemen, in a criminal trial, is presumed to be innocent, as I told you, the law never imposes upon a defendant the burden or the duty of testifying, of calling any witnesses, or producing any evidence.Â  The defendant in a criminal trial has the absolute right under the Constitution of the United States and the State of South Carolina not to take the witness stand and testify.Â  The exercise by a defendant of this right not to testify or present any evidence must not be considered by you in any way against the defendant, and should play no role whatsoever in your discussions or your deliberations.Â  No inference of any kind may be drawn from the defendantâ€™s exercise of his constitutional right not to testify or present other evidence.\r\n\r\nThe judge reiterated this principle in a charge after receipt of the jury note.\r\nInvestigators for Antwan and Troy contacted eight jurors.Â  Seven of the jurors provided statements, not affidavits, to the investigators.Â  Three of the jurors expressed very clearly they based their decision in the case on the evidence presented at trial only.Â  Although the other four jurors who provided statements all professed they thought the defendants should have testified, none of the jurors stated that was the reason they found the defendants guilty.Â  Each of the four jurors declared their decision was based upon the evidence presented by the State at trial.Â  The statements given by the four jurors support the trial courtâ€™s finding that further investigation was not merited.\r\nAntwan relies on State v. Bryant, 354 S.C. 390, 581 S.E.2d 157 (2003), for the proposition that the judge â€œshould have heard the testimony from the jurors as requested in the motion.â€Â  Bryant is distinguishable from the case sub judice.Â  Bryant involved the questioning of jurorsâ€™ family members by Horry County Police detectives before trial in a death penalty setting in a case in which the victim was a Horry County Police Department Officer.Â  Unlike the present case, Bryant was an extraneous influence case.\r\nHere, the trial judge considered the statements even though no sworn affidavits of the jurors were introduced at the hearings.Â  The judge noted: â€œ[W]e donâ€™t have any affidavits . . . . Iâ€™m not sure we really have any competent evidence before the court, but Iâ€™m considering what evidence we have as competent evidence, even though there are no affidavits.â€Â  The extant precedent mandates the presentation of affidavits or sworn testimony of jurors.Â  This evidentiary record is devoid of the required showing in a case involving internal juror misconduct.\r\nThe trial court did not err in refusing to take sworn juror testimony and denying Antwanâ€™s motion for a new trial based on allegations of juror misconduct.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, Antwan Zeiglerâ€™s conviction is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3968","title":"Abu-Shawareb v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3968\r\nHeard December 8, 2004 â€“ Filed March 21, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJay Bender and Holly L. Palmer, both of Columbia, for Appellant. \r\nWilbur E. Johnson, Stephen L. Brown, and Matthew&nbsp;K. Mahoney, all of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  Hassan Abu-Shawareb appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of South Carolina State University, arguing the court erred by determining a prior order and release barred his bailment claim.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn response to a studentâ€™s sexual harassment complaint, Abu-Shawareb was suspended from the faculty at the university, required to leave campus immediately, and prohibited from returning pending a criminal investigation.Â  He left behind several volumes of his private library in his locked office, along with teaching materials, maps, photographs, and personal mementos.Â  \r\nAfter he was acquitted on the criminal charge, Abu-Shawareb brought a federal civil rights claim against the university alleging wrongful suspension and demanding reinstatement.Â  The parties successfully mediated his claim and agreed to enter into a settlement agreement.Â  According to the agreementâ€™s terms, the university was to be released from all claims arising out of Abu-Shawarebâ€™s employment, and he was to be permitted to return as a tenured faculty member.Â  \r\nUpon returning to the university but prior to signing the release, Abu-Shawareb discovered the contents of his former office were missing.Â  The partiesâ€™ counsel exchanged correspondence in an attempt to locate the missing items.Â  Abu-Shawarebâ€™s attorney informed the university it would have to either locate his clientâ€™s property or compensate Abu-Shawareb for the loss.Â  \r\nCounsel for the university replied, â€œIt is my understanding that the University is continuing the effort to locate any materials which belong to the Plaintiff.Â  I will keep you aware of the progress of this search.Â  I do not believe that this unresolved issue should forestall the execution of a settlement agreement and I do not understand your letter to suggest that notion.â€Â  A revised settlement agreement and release, proposed order of dismissal, and settlement check were enclosed with the reply.Â  \r\nAbu-Shawareb executed the revised settlement agreement and release.Â  Although the release made no mention of his missing belongings, Abu-Shawarebâ€™s attorneys prepared for him a separate handwritten statement purporting to reserve â€œany claims relating to the loss or destruction of . . . personal items or professional items housed or stored in the office of Hassan Abu-Shawareb[.]â€Â  This document was not executed by anyone on behalf of the university.Â  The release was later adopted and incorporated into the federal courtâ€™s order of dismissal terminating the litigation.Â  \r\nThe missing items were never located, and Abu-Shawareb sued the university alleging causes of action for bailment, negligence, and conversion.Â  The university denied his claims and raised several affirmative defenses, one of which was that the partiesâ€™ agreement and release incorporated in the order of dismissal in the federal case barred Abu-Shawarebâ€™s claims.Â  \r\nAt a hearing on a motion for summary judgment, the university argued the release and order of dismissal in the federal action barred the Abu-Shawarebâ€™s claims, relying on Bradley v. Family Ford Sales, Inc., 287 S.C. 401, 339 S.E.2d 122 (1986).Â  The universityâ€™s motion for summary judgment was taken under advisement by the court and the trial proceeded.Â  \r\nAt trial, the university moved for a directed verdict, reasserting Abu-Shawarebâ€™s claims were barred by the Bradley decision.Â  The court, however, refused to consider the motion and indicated the issue of whether Bradley barred the action remained under advisement for final determination on the universityâ€™s summary judgment motion.[1]Â  The trial court granted Abu-Shawarebâ€™s motion for directed verdict on the sole issue of whether a bailment was created.Â  The jury ultimately returned a verdict for $100,000.Â  \r\nAfter the verdict, the trial court denied the universityâ€™s motion for summary judgment, finding â€œthat there are sufficient ambiguities in the language of the release that would allow the introduction of extrinsic evidence as to whether or not this cause of action was released[.]â€Â  The court also determined â€œas a matter of law there was no intention on [sic] either party that this cause of action would be released.â€Â  \r\nThe university filed a motion for JNOV or, in the alternative, motion for new trial, again arguing the bailment claim was barred by the provisions of the federal court order.Â  The court determined â€œthe language of the partiesâ€™ Release, incorporated as an Order by Judge Currie, is broad and comprehensiveâ€ and the unambiguous terms of â€œthe Order must be accepted at its face value.â€Â  The trial court granted the universityâ€™s JNOV motion after ultimately concluding the Bradley case was controlling.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAbu-Shawareb contends the trial court erred as a matter of law by granting the universityâ€™s JNOV motion, arguing the release was ambiguous and, as such, the court was required to determine whether the parties intended to release the university from his bailment claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen we review a trial courtâ€™s grant or denial of a motion for directed verdict or JNOV, we reverse only when there is no evidence to support the ruling or when the ruling is governed by an error of law.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d 571, 573 (1997).\r\nIn Bradley v. Family Ford Sales, Inc., 287 S.C. 401, 339 S.E.2d 122 (1986), our supreme court determined a prior order of dismissal that prohibited the parties to that action from â€œinstituting or maintaining any further action with regard to the matters set forth in the complaint, answer and counterclaims hereinâ€ barred a subsequent claim by one of the parties based on the circumstances that gave rise to the original action, even though there may have been no intention to release that specific claim.Â  The Bradley court held:\r\n\r\nThe order of dismissal is not merely an agreement between the parties, it is an order of the court.Â  It stands on its own and does not require resort to any extrinsic documents for a determination of its meaning and effect.Â  Since the language is perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, the words alone will determine the provisionâ€™s force and effect. \r\n\r\nId. at 403, 339 S.E.2d at 124.\r\nIn this case, the federal court explicitly stated â€œthat the Settlement Agreement and Release of all Claims is adopted and incorporated herein as the Order of the Court[.]â€Â  The referenced release read:\r\n\r\nIt is further agreed that this Release sets forth the acceptance of the sum set forth above and is in full and final settlement of any and all claims that the undersigned now has or may have in the future arising out of his employment with Defendant, South Carolina State University, the terms of his employment with Defendant, South Carolina State University, events surrounding his employment and the suspension of his employment, including but not limited to the claims set forth hereinabove.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nAbu-Shawareb contends Bradley can be distinguished because the order of the court contained the specific operative language and did not rely on any extrinsic document, whereas the court order involved here requires reference to a separate document.Â  We view this as a distinction without a difference, because the language carefully chosen and employed by the court in adopting and incorporating the release as a part of its order is the functional equivalent of reciting the language in the body of the order.\r\nBecause the release does not specifically include his bailment claim, Abu-Shawareb argues it is ambiguous, requiring the trial court to look at parol evidence to determine the partiesâ€™ intentions.Â  Although the release is broad, it is not ambiguous.Â  See Jordan v. Sec. Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705, 707 (1993) (holding silence alone does not create an ambiguity).Â  Ambiguity is created only when a release is inconsistent on its face or is reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation.Â  See e.g., Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493 S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  The release here clearly and definitely precludes future claims arising out of Abu-Shawarebâ€™s employment with the university and events surrounding his employment and suspension.Â  Abu-Shawareb acknowledges his bailment claim arose from his employment by and suspension from the university.Â  Accordingly, his claim is properly barred by the language of the release as incorporated in the order of dismissal.Â  See Bradley, 287 S.C. at 403, 339 S.E.2d at 124 (â€œâ€˜If . . . the judgment is not ambiguous or uncertain, the parol evidence rule applies, and the written judgment should be accepted at its face value and without speculating as to the reasoning employed at reaching the particular result.â€™â€ ).\r\nAbu-Shawareb also contends the trial courtâ€™s denial of the universityâ€™s summary judgment motion was inconsistent with its grant of the universityâ€™s JNOV motion, because the former ruling was based on a finding the release was ambiguous while the latter found the release and order were clear.Â  It is not error for the trial court to change its mind and reconsider a motion for summary judgment.Â  See PPG Indus., Inc. v. Orangeburg Paint &amp; Decorating Ctr., Inc., 297 S.C. 176, 183, 375 S.E.2d 331, 335 (Ct. App. 1988) (â€œThe trial judge, under our procedure, is afforded many opportunities to change his mind.â€); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 416-17, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997) (holding the decision whether to reconsider a motion for summary judgment is within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion).Â  The denial of summary judgment does not finally determine the merits of the case, and issues raised in a motion may be raised again in a motion to reconsider summary judgment or in a motion for directed verdict.Â  Id.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause we read the language of the partiesâ€™ release and the court order incorporating it as perfectly plain and capable of legal construction, we conclude the supreme courtâ€™s holding in Bradley controls to preclude Abu-Shawareb from maintaining his bailment action regardless of the partiesâ€™ intentions.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Abu-Shawareb abandoned his conversion and negligence claims during trial and proceeded on bailment alone.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3969","title":"Clinton v.

Â§ 38-77-350(A) does not require insurers to provide a blank line for insured to write in any amount of coverage up to the policy limit) and the reasoning set forth by the trial court, we conclude the trial court properly found a meaningful offer was made to Joy Clinton and the policy should not be reformed to include underinsured motorist coverage. The order granting summary judgment to West American is hereby affirmed and reprinted as part of the opinion of this court.Â  \r\nTHE ORDER OF JUDGE JAMES JOHNSON, JR.\r\nBefore the Court are both the plaintiffâ€™s and the defendantâ€™s motions for summary judgment. These matters came before the Court for hearing on January 8, 2004. The plaintiff was represented by Mr. Randall Chambers of the Joel Bieber Firm of Greenville and the defendant was represented by Ms. Jennifer Eubanks of Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, P.A. of Greenville. The parties both agreed that there were no genuine issues of fact before the Court. For the reasons set forth below, the plaintiffâ€™s motion for summary judgment is denied and the defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment is granted.\r\nÂ 1.Â Â Â  Procedural Background\r\nOn May 24, 1999, Debra Clinton (â€œClintonâ€) was a passenger in a 2000 Plymouth Neon LX, which was owned and operated by Joy Clinton, when that car was struck from the rear by a car operated by Courtney Young. Clinton filed suit against Courtney Young, alleging personal injury as a result of the collision in an action filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Greenwood County, C.A. No. 00-CP-24-982. Courtney Youngâ€™s liability insurer, Farm Bureau, tendered its limits of $25,000 and Clinton tendered a claim for underinsured motorist (â€œUIMâ€) coverage to Joy Clintonâ€™s insurer, West American. West American determined that Joy Clinton had declined UIM coverage after a valid and meaningful offer was made to her and declined to pay the claim.\r\nJoy Clinton had only minimum limits coverage, $15,000 per person, $30,000 per accident and $10,000 for property damage per accident, on the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX at the time of the accident. Debra Clinton alleged over $45,000 in medical expenses as a result of the accident. In order to resolve the tort action, the parties entered into a Consent Order of Dismissal in which they stipulated that Clinton was entitled to file a declaratory judgment action to determine whether UIM coverage existed under the policy issued to Joy Clinton and that â€œin the event that a court of law determines that UIM coverage exists, recovery shall be in the amount of $15,000, regardless of costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.â€\r\nClinton filed the above-captioned action for declaratory judgment on May 21, 2002, alleging that the terms of the West American policy issued to Joy Clinton included UIM coverage in the amount of $15,000 per person or, in the alternative, that West American failed to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage and that the West American policy should be reformed to include UIM coverage in the amount of $15,000 per person. Clinton also named Palmetto Insurance Assoc., Inc., Joy Clintonâ€™s insurance agent, as a defendant.Â  Clinton voluntarily dismissed Palmetto as a defendant in the action by a Consent Order filed July 25, 2002.\r\nÂ 2.Â Â Â Â  Factual Background\r\nOn September 24, 1992, Joy Clinton submitted on application for personal automobile insurance with the David Stuart Agency in Greenwood.Â  [footnote omitted].Â  A copy of her application was before the Court and constitutes a part of the record. On the first page of that application, Clinton listed three automobiles to be insured: a 1987 Chevrolet Celebrity, a 1987 Dodge Ram 50 and a 1979 GMC Pickup. Also on that page, she listed the coverages she sought to purchase for each automobile. The application shows that she sought bodily injury liability coverage in the amount of $50,000 per person and $100,000 per accident, and property damage liability coverage in the amount of $25,000 per accident. She also sought uninsured motorist (â€œUMâ€) coverage in the amount of $25,000 per person, $50,000 per accident and $25,000 in property damage per accident. The section where Joy Clinton would have filled in the amounts of UIM coverage she sought is blank.\r\nOn the second page of the application, under the section entitled Binder/Signature, the application indicates that the insurance binder became effective on September 24, 1992. That section also reads: â€œThis company binds the kind(s) of insurance stipulated on this application.â€ The application is signed by Joy Clinton and dated September 24, 1992.\r\nOn that same date, Joy Clinton filled out a document entitled â€œOffer of Optional Additional Uninsured and Underinsured Automobile Insurance Coverages South Carolinaâ€ (â€œOfferâ€). The Offer is before the Court and constitutes a part of the record in this matter. The document is a form generated by the South Carolina Department of Insurance and bears the notation â€œSCDI Form Number 2006â€. The first page of the Offer contains an explanation of coverages. Regarding UIM coverage, the document reads:\r\n\r\nUnderinsured Motorist Coverage compensates you, or other persons insured under your automobile insurance policy, including passengers within your motor vehicle, for amounts that you, or your passengers, may be legally entitled to collect as damages from an owner or operator of an at-fault underinsured motor vehicle. An underinsured motor vehicle is a motor vehicle that is covered by some form of liability insurance, but that liability insurance coverage is not sufficient to fully compensate you for your damages.\r\nYour automobile insurance policy does not automatically provide any Underinsured Motorist Coverage.Â  You have, however, a right to buy Underinsured Motorist Coverage in limits up to the limits of liability coverage you will carry under your automobile insurance policy. Some of the more commonly sold limits of Underinsured Motorist Coverage, together with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown on this Form. If there are other limits in which you are interested, but which are not shown upon this Form, then fill-in those limits. If your insurance company is allowed to market those limits within this State, your insurance agent will then fill-in the amount of increased premium.\r\nIt is important for you to understand that if you reject either one of these coverages upon this Form and if you are involved in an automobile accident, this Form then may be used by your insurance company as evidence against you if it denies your claim for additional Uninsured Motorist Coverage or Underinsured Motorist Coverage.\r\nIf you do not complete this Form and return it to your insurance company or to your insurance agent within 30 days from your receipt of this Form, the law requires that additional Uninsured Motorist Coverage and Underinsured Motorist Coverage, at the same limits as the automobile liability insurance which you purchase, must be automatically added on to your automobile insurance policy. You will be required to pay an additional premium for each of these two coverages. If you do not pay that additional premium, your automobile insurance policy may then be cancelled.\r\nIn the future, if you wish to increase or to decrease your limits of additional Uninsured or Underinsured coverage, you must then contact either your insurance agent or your insurance company. You will not be presented with another copy of this Form by your insurance agent or by your insurance company upon renewal of your automobile liability insurance policy.\r\n\r\nOn the second page of the Offer, the offer of additional UM coverage appears.Â  Four limits of additional UM coverage are shown, along with the increased premium rate. Those limits are $15,000/$30,000/$5,000; $25,000/$50,000/$10,000; $50,000/$100,000/$25,000; and $100,000/ $300,000/$50,000. In addition, a blank was left for the insured to fill in any other limit of additional UM in which she was interested. She filled in â€œ25/50/25â€. The Offer also asked whether the insured wished to purchase additional UM coverage and a check mark appears beside the answer â€œyes.â€\r\nOn the third page of the Offer, the offer of UIM coverage appears.Â  The same four limits of additional UM coverage are also listed as offers of UIM coverage.Â  In addition, a blank was left for the insured to fill in any other limit of UIM in which she was interested. She filled in â€œ25/50/â€.Â  Where asked whether she wished to purchase UIM coverage, a check mark appears beside the answer â€œno.â€Â  The Offer also requires the insured to sign her name if she did not desire UIM coverage.Â  Joy Clintonâ€™s signature appears on that line.\r\nAlso on the third page of the Offer is a section entitled â€œApplicantâ€™s Acknowledgment.â€ That section reads as follows:\r\n\r\nI hereby acknowledge that I have read, or have had read to me, the above explanations and offers of additional Uninsured Motorist Coverage and Underinsured Motorist Coverage. In [sic] have indicated whether or not I wish to purchase each coverage in the spaces provided. I further understand that the above explanations of these coverages are intended only to be brief descriptions of Uninsured Motorist Coverage and Underinsured Motorist Coverage, and that payment of benefits under any of these coverages is subject both to the terms and conditions of my automobile insurance policy and to the State of South Carolinaâ€™s laws.\r\n\r\nBelow the acknowledgement, Joy Clinton printed and signed her name, printed her address and dated the document September 24, 1992.\r\nOn September 24, 1992, West American issued a policy of automobile insurance to Joy Clinton bearing policy number DPW 05109293. See affidavit of Tom Dahl which was before the Court and constitutes part of the record in this matter. The policy was renewed several times in the intervening years.Â  In 1999, prior to the motor vehicle accident with Courtney Young, Joy Clinton decreased her liability limits to $15,000/$30,000/$10,000. See affidavit of Joy Clinton which was before the Court and constitutes a part of the record in this matter.Â  On May 21,1999, Joy Clinton added the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX to the policy.Â  She did not request to add UIM coverage to any of the vehicles covered by the policy.Â  At the time of the accident, the policy declarations page shows that the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX had $15,000/$30,000/$10,000 in both liability and UM coverage; the declarations page shows that the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX was not covered by UIM coverage. See Declarations Page which was before the Court and constitutes a part of the record in this matter.\r\nJoy Clinton submitted an affidavit in which she alleged that she believed that shortly after she purchased coverage in 1992, she noticed that she was paying for â€œdouble Uninsured and Underinsured Coverage.â€ She alleges that she called her agent and told him that she did not want to pay twice for the same thing.Â  She alleges that her agent had her come to the office and sign a blank form.Â  However, she does not identify the form she signed. She did not recall filling out the Offer, but admitted that the signatures on the Offer appear to be hers.Â  She also alleged that no one ever told her how much the premium would be for UIM coverage in the same limits as her liability coverage. Finally, she alleged that it was never her intention to cancel or reject UIM coverage. \r\n3.Â Â Â Â  Analysis\r\nAs an initial matter, and setting aside the issue of whether a meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made, the policy, as it was issued to Joy Clinton, did not provide UIM coverage for the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX. The policy declarations page indicates that no UIM coverage was issued for the Neon and no premium charged for UIM coverage. Moreover, Clinton, in her brief in support of her Motion for Summary Judgment does not argue that Joy Clintonâ€™s policy, as issued, contained UIM coverage for the Neon. As there is no indication to the contrary, this court concludes that the automobile insurance policy as issued to Joy Clinton did not provide UIM coverage for the Neon.\r\nWest American, as the insurer, has the initial burden of proving that a meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made to Joy Clinton.Â  Jackson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 301 S.C. 440, 392 S.E.2d 472 (Ct.App. 1990), affâ€™d as modified, 303 S.C. 321, 400 S.E.2d 492 (1991). The test for determining whether an effective offer was made was set forth by the Supreme Court in State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. v. Wannamaker, 291 S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987):\r\n\r\n(1) the insurerâ€™s notification process must be commercially reasonable, whether oral or in writing;\r\n(2) the insurer must specify the limits of optional coverage and not merely offer additional coverage in general terms;\r\n(3) the insurer must intelligibly advise the insured of the nature of the optional coverage; and\r\n(4) the insured must be told that optional coverages are available for an additional premium.\r\n\r\nWannamaker, 521, 556.Â  If the insurer fails to make a meaningful offer of UIM coverage, the policy will be reformed to provide UIM coverage in the amount of the policyâ€™s liability limits. Id.\r\nIn the present case, the plaintiff alleges that the UIM offer was not meaningful for two reasons. First, Clinton alleges that the Offer does not reference the policy number and, therefore, there is no way of knowing whether the Offer was made in connection with the policy which covered the Neon or some other policy. Second, Clinton alleges that the Offer was not meaningful because it failed to provide a â€œlist of available limits and the range of premiums for the limitsâ€ as required by Â§ 38-77-350(A)(2) of the South Carolina Code of Laws. Specifically, Clinton alleges that because she filled in â€œ25/50â€ in the UIM offer section of the form and no premium amount was filled in by the agent or insurer, she is entitled to reform her policy to include UIM coverage.\r\nClintonâ€™s argument that the Offer was invalid because it did not reference her policy number is meritless.Â  First, neither the Wannamaker test nor the statutory law applicable to UIM coverage requires the offer form to contain the policy number.Â  Second, the Offer was signed and dated the same date that Clinton made her application for personal automobile insurance coverage. Because a binder was issued that day, the insurer had likely not even issued a policy number on September 24, 1992. Finally, as made clear by the affidavit of Tom Dahl, a Personal Lines Underwriting Manager for the Ohio Casualty Group, West American issued only one policy of insurance to Joy Clinton, that being policy number DPW 05109293.Â  Moreover, Joy Clinton, in her affidavit, does not allege that she ever held more than one policy with West American or the Ohio Casualty Group. Accordingly, because no other policy of insurance has ever been issued to Joy Clinton and because the date of the Offer and the policy application are identical, it is clear that the Offer signed by Joy Clinton was made in connection with her policy which covered the Neon.\r\nWest American made a valid and meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Joy Clinton by virtue of its Offer dated September 24, 1992. The Offer was commercially reasonable, being made on a form approved by the South Carolina Department of Insurance in compliance with Â§ 38-77-350 of the South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  The South Carolina Court of Appeals has specifically held that the form used by West American, Form 2006, meets the requirements of Â§ 38-77-350.Â  Osborne v. Allstate Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 479, 462 S.E.2d 291 (Ct.App. 1995) superceded by statute as stated in Moody v. Dairvland Ins. Co., 354 S.C. 28, 579 S.E.2d 527 (Ct.App. 2003); Butler v. Unisun Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (S.C. 1996).\r\nClinton argues that because Joy Clinton filled in â€œ25/50â€ in the blank left for the insured to fill in other limits of UIM coverage on the Offer and the agent did not fill in the premium amount, the Offer is rendered unmeaningful. Clinton argues that by filling in â€œ25/50â€ in the UIM coverage blank, the insurer was under a duty to fill in the premium. However, this argument ignores the remainder of the Offer.Â  First, â€œ25/50â€ is not a complete coverage amount. There is no amount listed for property damage. Accordingly, no premium amount could be determined because the amount requested is not complete. Second, Joy Clinton answered the question about whether she wanted UIM coverage in the negative, checking â€œno,â€ and signed her name to that effect. Joy Clintonâ€™s declination of UIM coverage is corraborated [sic] by her insurance application which, while requesting additional UM coverage, does not request UIM coverage.Â  Thus, because Joy Clinton declined UIM coverage, there was absolutely no need or point in determining a premium for â€œ25/50.â€\r\nÂ 4.Â Â Â Â  Conclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing, this Court denies the plaintiffâ€™s motion for summary judgment, grants the defendantâ€™s motion for summary judgment and declares that the policy of automobile insurance, policy no. DPW 05109293, does not, as issued, provide UIM coverage for the 2000 Plymouth Neon LX listed on the policy; that a valid and meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made to Joy Clinton on September 24, 1992; that Joy Clinton declined that valid and meaningful offer of UIM coverage on September 24, 1992; that the policy of automobile insurance issued by West American to Joy Clinton, policy no. DPW 05109293 cannot legally be reformed to provide UIM coverage; and that, on May 24, 1999, the 2000 Plymouth Neon did not have UIM coverage under West American policy number DPW 05109293.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., KITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3970","title":"State v.

Savitz, III, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelanka, Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey A. Jacobs, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Christopher F. Davis appeals his convictions for murder, armed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Davis contends that admission of hearsay statements violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  We disagree and affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nA jury convicted Davis of robbing and murdering Paul Williams (the victim).Â  Davis argues the trial judge erred by allowing Shawn Hicks, a witness at trial, to testify to hearsay statements made by Gregg Hill.Â  Davis claims the statements by declarant Hill were testimonial in nature, and, pursuant to Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), admission of the evidence violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.Â  The State contends the convictions should be affirmed because the statements were not testimonial and fit within the excited utterance exception to the rule against hearsay.Â  \r\nHicks was selling drugs near the victimâ€™s house on the night of the murder.Â  At Davisâ€™s trial, Hicks averred that he heard Davis, the victim, and Reggie Stevens arguing.Â  Hicks then heard a gunshot and observed three individuals running from the victimâ€™s backyard.Â  Witnesses, including Hicks, identified Stevens as one of the individuals, but could not identify the other two.Â  \r\nFive to ten minutes after hearing the gunshot, Hicks sold drugs to Stevens and Hill.Â  Approximately fifteen to thirty minutes after the gunshot, Stevens and Hill returned with Davis, who was carrying a shotgun and a bag of coins.Â  Davis purchased drugs from Hicks with the coins and offered to sell Hicks the shotgun.Â  At this time, the hearsay statements at issue were uttered by Hill to Hicks.Â  Hicks testified as follows:\r\n\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  What, if anything, did anybody say to you to prevent you from buying it [the shotgun]?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Well, he told me not to purchase the shotgun.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Who told you?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Greg Hill.Â   \r\n  . . . .Â   \r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  [W]hat did Greg Hill tell you that night . . . ?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Chris and Reggie went in the house.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  All right.Â  Did he say anything about Paul being shot or anything?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Yeah.Â  Thatâ€™s why he told me not to get the shotgun.\r\n  Q.Â Â Â Â Â  Because?\r\n  A.Â Â Â Â Â  Paul had been shot with it.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge found Hillâ€™s declarations admissible as statements made in the furtherance of a conspiracy and admitted the testimony over Davisâ€™s objection.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, ___ S.C. ___, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This Court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  This same standard of review applies to preliminary factual findings in determining the admissibility of certain evidence in criminal cases.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829.Â  On review, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Rochester, 301 S.C. 196, 391 S.E.2d 244 (1990); see also State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, 529 S.E.2d 20 (2000) (noting an abuse of discretion is a conclusion with no reasonable factual support).Â  This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson, 345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n        I.Â  Confrontation Clause\r\n    \r\n\r\nAmong other protections, the Sixth Amendment assures: â€œIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right . . . to be confronted with the witnesses against him[.]â€Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  The Sixth Amendment was incorporated and made applicable to the states through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400 (1965); State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 563 S.E.2d 315 (2002).Â  The right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial in that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â  California v. Green, 399 U.S. 149 (1970); State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 602 S.E.2d 62 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The primary interest secured by the Confrontation Clause is the right to cross-examination.Â  Gillian at 450, 602 S.E.2d at 71 (citing State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001); Starnes v. State, 307 S.C. 247, 414 S.E.2d 582 (1991)); see also State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d 525 (1994) (observing that specifically included in defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront a witness is the right to meaningfully cross-examine an adverse witness).Â  \r\nCertain hearsay statements traditionally have been admissible against a defendant even though the declarant was unavailable at trial and even though the defendant did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine the declarant.Â  Under Ohio v. Roberts, 448 U.S. 56 (1980), abrogated by Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), hearsay statements were admissible if they bore â€œadequate â€˜indicia of reliabilityâ€™â€â€”a test that could be met by showing the evidence (1) fell within a firmly rooted hearsay exception, or (2) bore particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  Roberts at 66; State v. Sanders, 356 S.C. 214, 588 S.E.2d 142 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  However, in Crawford, the United States Supreme Court broke away from Roberts and radically changed the Confrontation Clause landscape.Â  \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Crawford v. Washington\r\nIn Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004), Michael Crawford was convicted of assault for stabbing Kenneth Lee, who allegedly tried to rape Crawfordâ€™s wife, Sylvia.Â  At trial, the State played for the jury Sylviaâ€™s tape-recorded statement to the police describing the stabbing.Â  Sylvia did not testify at trial due to Washingtonâ€™s marital privilege, which â€œgenerally bars a spouse from testifying without the other spouseâ€™s consent.â€Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1357 (citing Wash. Rev. Code Â§ 5.60.060(1) (1994)).Â  This privilege, however, does not extend to a spouseâ€™s out-of-court statements admissible under a hearsay exception.Â  Whether Crawford saw a weapon in Leeâ€™s hands was a critical fact for his claim of self-defense.Â  Because Sylvia was unable to testify at trial, Crawford claimed the admission of Sylviaâ€™s statement was a violation of his federal constitutional right under the Sixth Amendment to be confronted with the witnesses against him.Â  \r\nFollowing Roberts, the trial court allowed Sylviaâ€™s statement on the ground that it bore guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  The Washington Court of Appeals reversed.Â  The Washington Supreme Court then reinstated the conviction, and the Supreme Court of the United States granted certiorari.Â Â  \r\nJustice Scalia, writing for the seven-Justice majority, announced a fundamental change in Confrontation Clause jurisprudence: \r\n\r\n  Where testimonial statements are involved, we do not think the Framers meant to leave the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s protection to the vagaries of the rules of evidence, much less to amorphous notions of â€œreliability.â€ . . . To be sure, the Clauseâ€™s ultimate goal is to ensure reliability of evidence, but it is a procedural rather than a substantive guarantee.Â  It commands, not that evidence be reliable, but that reliability be assessed in a particular manner: by testing in the crucible of cross-examination.\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1373 (emphasis added).Â  Crucial to the Courtâ€™s decision was its emphasis on testimonial hearsay.Â  â€œ[I]f the Sixth Amendment is not solely concerned with testimonial hearsay, that is its primary object, and interrogations by law enforcement officers fall squarely within that class.â€ Â Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1365 (footnote omitted).Â  Thus,\r\n\r\n  Where nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framersâ€™ design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay lawâ€”as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.Â  Where testimonial evidence is at issue, however, the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374 (footnote omitted).\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Defining the Line Between Testimonial and Nontestimonial\r\nThe holding in Crawford is unequivocal: â€œ[w]here testimonial evidence is at issue . . . the Sixth Amendment demands what the common law required: unavailability and a prior opportunity for cross-examination.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  However, the Court left â€œfor another day any effort to spell out a comprehensive definition of â€˜testimonial.â€™â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).Â  Therefore, Crawfordâ€™s reach largely will be determined by the definition courts give to the term â€œtestimonial.â€Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Guidance from Crawford\r\nThe Crawford Court established that whatever else testimonial covers, â€œit apples at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a formal trial; and to police interrogations.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  Looking to the language of the Sixth Amendment for guidance, the Court deduced that â€œ[t]he text of the Confrontation Clause . . . . applies to â€˜witnessesâ€™ against the accusedâ€”in other words, those who bear testimony.â€Â  Id. (citation omitted).Â  The Court explained:\r\n\r\n  â€œTestimony,â€ in turn, is typically â€œ[a] solemn declaration or affirmation made for the purpose of establishing or proving some fact.â€ . . . [A]n accuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.Â  The constitutional text, like the history underlying the common-law right of confrontation, thus reflects an especially acute concern with a specific type of out-of-court statement. \r\n\r\nId.Â  \r\nThe Court mentioned three formulations of â€œthis core class of â€˜testimonialâ€™ statementsâ€:Â  \r\n\r\n  (1) â€œex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalentâ€”that is, material such as affidavits, custodial examinations, prior testimony that the defendant was unable to cross-examine, or similar pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutoriallyâ€; \r\n  (2) â€œextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized testimonial materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessionsâ€; and \r\n  (3) â€œstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial[.]â€Â  \r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nAdditional instruction may be found in the Courtâ€™s recurring references to what it called the â€œprincipal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed.â€Â  Throughout the opinion, the Court interpreted the Clause by referencing its historical purpose of protecting against the â€œcivil-law mode of criminal procedure, and particularly its use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused.â€Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1363.Â  \r\nThe continental civil-law tradition â€œcondon[ing] examination in private by judicial officersâ€ stands in historical contradistinction to the English common-law tradition of â€œlive testimony in court subject to adversarial testing.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1359 (citing 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England 373-74 (1768)).Â  Yet, the civil-law practice eventually found its way to England:Â  \r\n\r\n  Justices of the peace or other officials examined suspects and witnesses before trial.Â  These examinations were sometimes read in court in lieu of live testimony, a practice that â€œoccasioned frequent demands by the prisoner to have his â€˜accusers,â€™ i.e. the witnesses against him, brought before him face to face. . . .â€\r\n  Pretrial examinations became routine under two statutes passed during the reign of Queen Mary in the 16th century . . . .Â  These . . . statutes required justices of the peace to examine suspects and witnesses in felony cases and to certify the results to the court. . . .Â  [T]hey came to be used as evidence in some cases, . . . resulting in an adoption of continental procedure.\r\n\r\nId. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1359-60 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nIt was against this backdrop that the Confrontation Clause stage was set.Â  Thus, the Sixth Amendment â€œmust be interpretedâ€ with this focus on preventing the civil-law use of ex parte examinations as evidence against the accused in mind.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1363.Â  See id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (noting that while ex parte examinations might sometimes be admissible under modern rules, the Framers certainly would not have condoned them); id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1365 (observing that the current investigatory involvement of police officers in the production of testimonial evidence presents the same risk as the civil-law practices of justices of the peace); id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374 (finding that testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and interrogation by police have the â€œclosest kinship to the abuses at which the Confrontation Clause was directedâ€). \r\nIn abrogating Roberts, the Court acknowledged suggestions by academics that the Court revise its Confrontation Clause doctrine to reflect more accurately the original understanding of the Clause.Â  See id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1369-70 (citing Akhil Reed Amar, The Constitution and Criminal Procedure 125-131 (1997); Richard Friedman, Confrontation: the Search for Basic Principles, 86 Geo. L. J. 1011 (1998)).Â  The significance of the Courtâ€™s citations to the scholarship of Professors Amar and Friedman is unclear.Â  However, the differing views of the two professors as to what constitutes testimonial provide an efficacious framework for analyzing the myriad of post-Crawford Confrontation Clause cases.Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Educatory Writings\r\nAmar suggests the Confrontation Clause â€œencompasses only those â€˜witnessesâ€™ who testify either by taking the stand in person or via government-prepared affidavits, deposition, videotapes, and the like.â€Â  A. Amar, Confrontation Clause First Principles: A Reply to Professor Friedman, 86 Geo. L. J. 1045 (1998).Â  Amarâ€™s focus is on the text of the Sixth Amendment and particularly on what was the common understanding of being a witness against someone during the Founding Era.Â  Thus, clearly testimonial statements include prior testimony, depositions, and affidavits.Â  Police station confessions and statements come within Amarâ€™s understanding of the Clause, although he admits they are a â€œtad trickier.â€Â  Id. at 1049.Â  Though confessions and statements are not made under oath, â€œthey typically have other formal indicia of testimony.â€Â  Id.Â  For example, confessions and statements are purportedly precise renditions of answers to precise questions and are usually attested by the confessorâ€™s signature.Â  â€œThus, they may be treated as functional depositions/affidavits, and therefore as â€˜witnessingâ€™ under both the Fifth and Sixth Amendments.â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).Â  Amarâ€™s definition excludes private accusations made out of court by one private person to another.Â  \r\nFriedman offers a â€œmodestly broader definitionâ€ of testimonial.Â  See 86 Geo. L. J. at 1043.Â  Under Friedmanâ€™s approach, â€œa declarant should be deemed to be acting as a witness when she makes a statement if she anticipates that the statement will be used in the prosecution or investigation of a crime.â€Â  Id. at 1042.Â  He offers five â€œrules of thumbâ€:\r\n\r\n  A statement made knowingly to the authorities that describes criminal activity is almost always testimonial.Â  A statement made by a person claiming to be the victim of a crime and describing the crime is usually testimonial, whether made to the authorities or not.Â  If, in the case of a crime committed over a short period of time, a statement is made before the crime is committed, it almost certainly is not testimonial.Â  A statement made by one participant in a criminal enterprise to another, intended to further the enterprise, is not testimonial.Â  And neither is a statement made in the course of going about oneâ€™s ordinary business, made before the criminal act has occurred or with no recognition that it relates to criminal activity.Â Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 1042-43.Â  \r\nOne writer has illustrated the difference between Amarâ€™s and Friedmanâ€™s approaches as follows:\r\n\r\n  A is found dead in her bedroom, and her husband, B, is indicted for her murder.Â  The police discover that A has left behind a diary detailing Bâ€™s persistent history of domestic violence.Â  The diaryâ€™s cover page indicates that A authored it â€œto memorialize my husbandâ€™s brutality in case something happens to me.â€ \r\n\r\nPaul Shechtman, â€˜Crawfordâ€™ and the Meaning of Testimonial, 6/23/2004 N.Y.L.J. 4, (col 4.).Â  Assuming the diary is admissible under the jurisdictionâ€™s hearsay rules, whether it will pass Confrontation Clause scrutiny depends upon whether the court adopts a definition of testimonial more akin to Amarâ€™s or Freidmanâ€™s.Â  Because the diary is not formalized and generated at the behest of the government, Amarâ€™s definition would find it nontestimonial.Â  Freidmanâ€™s approach, in contrariety, would deem the diary testimonial if the court found that A memorialized Bâ€™s abuse in anticipation that the diary would be used against B in court in the event of her death.Â  \r\n\r\n  3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Post-Crawford Decisions\r\n\r\nSince Crawford, many courts have addressed whether particular statements are testimonial or nontestimonial.Â  The issue has arisen under various factual circumstances, and statements tend to fall within one of several categories.Â  For example, multiple courts have faced the question whether hearsay statements made to 911 dispatchers are testimonial under Crawford.Â  These courts have employed divergent tests and rationales to reach varying conclusions.Â  Additional categorical situations include statements made to police during initial field investigations; statements made by children to authorities or parents; and statements made to family, friends, or acquaintances.Â  Considering the significance â€œtestimonialâ€ now plays in Confrontation Clause cases, a review of how other courts have begun to define the term is edifying.Â Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    a.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Statements Made During 911 Calls\r\n  \r\n\r\nOne of the earliest opinions to address the reaches of â€œtestimonialâ€ is People v. Moscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d 875 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004).Â  The defendant in Moscat made a motion in limine to exclude the recording of a 911 call made by the complainant.Â  Announcing its â€œearly opportunityâ€ to â€œwork out in practice the meaning and concrete application of the new principlesâ€ set forth in Crawford, 777 N.Y.S.2d at 876, the Moscat court held:\r\n\r\n  A 911 call for help is essentially different in nature than the â€œtestimonialâ€ materials that Crawford tells us the Confrontation Clause was designed to exclude. \r\n  A 911 call is typically initiated not by the police, but by the victim of a crime.Â  It is generated not by the desire of the prosecution or the police to seek evidence against a particular suspect; rather, the 911 call has its genesis in the urgent desire of a citizen to be rescued from immediate peril. \r\n   . . . . \r\n  Moreover, a 911 call can usually be seen as part of the criminal incident itself, rather than as part of the prosecution that follows.Â  Many 911 calls are made while an assault or homicide is still in progress.Â  Most other 911 calls are made in the immediate aftermath of the crime.Â  \r\n  Typically, a woman who calls 911 for help because she has just been stabbed or shot is not contemplating being a â€œwitnessâ€ in future legal proceedings; she is usually trying simply to save her own life. \r\n\r\nMoscat, 777 N.Y.S.2d at 879-880.Â  See also People v. Conyers, 777 N.Y.S.2d 274, 277 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Queens Co. 2004) (citing Moscat and finding 911 calls nontestimonial because it was clear to the court, â€œhaving heard the panicked and terrified scream of Ms. Conyersâ€™, that her intention in placing the 911 calls was to stop the assault in progress and not to consider the legal ramifications of herself as a witness in a future proceeding[.]â€).\r\nPeople v. Corella, 18 Cal.Rptr.3d 770 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), is an early post-Crawford decision from the Court of Appeal of California.Â  Corellaâ€™s wife informed a 911 operator that her husband had hit her.Â  Based on Crawfordâ€™s treatment of â€œpolice interrogationâ€ as being analogous â€œto the official pretrial examination of suspects and witnesses by English justices of the peace before England had a professional police force,â€ the Corella court concluded â€œa police interrogation requires a relatively formal investigation where a trial is contemplated.â€Â  Id. at 776.Â  In contrast to the facts of Crawford, Mrs. Corellaâ€™s statements â€œwere not â€˜knowingly given in response to structured police questioning,â€™ and bear no indicia common to the official and formal quality of the various statements deemed testimonial by Crawford.Â  Mrs. Corella, not the police, initiated the 911 call to request assistance.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the statements were found nontestimonial.Â Â  \r\nLeavitt v. Arave, 383 F.3d 809 (9th Cir. 2004), involved the brutal mutilation and murder of Danette Elg.Â  The night before her murder, Elg phoned 911 when she heard someone attempting to break into her house.Â  The police responded and found signs of attempted entry.Â  Elg suspected that Leavitt was the perpetrator.Â  She was killed the following night, and Leavitt was charged with her murder.Â  \r\nLeavitt argued that use at trial of the 911 recording violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.Â  Among other things, Elg had told the 911 dispatcher â€œshe thought the prowler was Leavitt, because he had tried to talk himself into her home earlier that day, but she had refused him entry.â€Â  Id. at 830 (footnote omitted).\r\nAfter noting that Crawford left open a precise definition of testimonial, the Leavitt court concluded: â€œAlthough the question is close, we do not believe that Elgâ€™s statements are of the kind with which Crawford was concerned, namely, testimonial statements.â€Â  Id. at 830 n.22.Â  The court explicated:\r\n\r\n  Elg, not the police, initiated their interaction.Â  She was in no way being interrogated by them but instead sought their help in ending a frightening intrusion into her home.Â  Thus, we do not believe that the admission of her hearsay statements against Leavitt implicate â€œthe principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed . . . .â€\r\n\r\nId.\r\nIn Pitts v. State, ___ S.E.2d ___, 2005 WL 127049 (Ga. App. 2005), Pittsâ€™s wife called 911 and notified the dispatcher that Pitts had broken into her home and that another man was on her porch.Â  She stated that \r\n\r\n  Pitts broke into her house and was taking a shower, that he did not live there anymore, that he was running around her house with no clothes on, that he was not supposed to be in the county, that he was violating his probation, that â€œheâ€™s wanted,â€ and that he was involved in a police chase the preceding weekend.Â  \r\n\r\n___ S.E.2d at ___, 2005 WL 127049Â  at *1.\r\nThe Pitts court determined that the statements made by Pittsâ€™s wife were not testimonial:Â  \r\n\r\n  The 911 calls . . . do not come within the ambit of Crawford.Â  Here, the callerâ€™s statements were made while the incident was actually in progress.Â  The statements were not made for the purpose of establishing or proving a fact regarding some past event, but for the purpose of preventing or stopping a crime as it was actually occurring.Â  The caller was requesting that police come to her home to remove Pitts, who she said had broken into her house.Â  The statements made during the 911 calls were made without premeditation or afterthought.Â  \r\n\r\n___ S.E.2d at ___, 2005 WL 127049Â  at *4. \r\nState v. Wright, 686 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004), found that statements made during a 911 call, moments after a criminal offense, and while still under the stress of the event, are not testimonial under Crawford.Â  The court explained its decision as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  A 911 call is usually made because the caller wants protection from an immediate danger, not because the 911 caller expects the report to be used later at trial with the caller bearing witnessâ€”rather, there is a cloak of anonymity surrounding 911 calls that encourages citizens to make emergency calls and not fear repercussion.\r\n\r\nId. at 302 (citation omitted).Â  \r\nPeople v. Cortes, 781 N.Y.S.2d 401 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. Bronx Co. 2004), found hearsay statements made to a 911 operator were testimonial and thus reached a different conclusion than did the courts in Moscat and Conyers.Â  Factually, Cortes involved a 911 call by an unidentified and unavailable witness to a shooting.Â  The court began with the proposition that â€œ[t]he circumstances of some 911 calls, particularly those reporting a crime, are within the definition of interrogation.â€ Id. at 405.Â  Emphasizing that â€œwhat is paramount in Crawford is the importance of the confrontation right[,]â€ id. at 414, the court opined: â€œA definition of â€˜testimonialâ€™ that takes the Supreme Court and the New York courts at their word when they highly value the confrontation right cannot be limited to formal documents, affidavits or depositions.â€Â  Id. (footnote omitted).\r\nThe court adopted the following test:\r\n\r\n  A test . . . in accord with the highly prized protection of the right of confrontation is the objective one of whether the pretrial statement of a person other than the defendant, admitted through the testimony of another person, on tape or in writing, was made primarily for another purpose.Â  If so, it need not be confronted.Â  Under the test, for example, traditional business records, hospital diagnostic information, public records, res gestae, and co-conspirator statements would be admissible at trial without cross-examination.Â  Whether some other statement falls within the test is to be determined by the circumstances in which the statement was made.\r\n\r\nId. at 414-15 (footnote omitted). \r\nUnder the objective speaker test, â€œWhen a 911 call is made to report a crime and supply information about the circumstances and the people involved, the purpose of the information is for investigation, prosecution, and potential use at a judicial proceeding; it makes no difference what the caller believes.â€ Id. at 415.Â  Thus, statements made to the 911 dispatcher were deemed testimonial.Â  \r\nLike Cortes, the court in People v. Dobbin, ___ N.Y.S.2d ___,Â  2004 WL 3048648 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. New York Co. 2004), found hearsay statements to a 911 dispatcher testimonial.Â  The caller in Dobbin phoned 911 to report the robbery of a parking lot attendant which was in progress.Â  An account of the robbery, the location of the robbery, and a description of the perpetrator were given to the operator.Â Â  The Dobbin court reasoned:\r\n\r\n  The 911 call, in this case, contains a solemn declaration for the purpose of establishing the fact that the defendant is committing a robbery.Â  The caller is making a formal out of court statement to a government officer for the purpose of establishing this fact.Â  The callerâ€™s statement is not a â€œcasual remark to an acquaintance.â€Â  The caller was officially reporting a crime to the government agency entrusted with this very serious and important function.Â  As such, the 911 call falls within the category of out of court statements which reflect the focus of the Confrontation Clause; the out of court statements of â€œâ€˜witnessesâ€™ against the accused in other words, those who â€˜bear testimony.â€™â€ \r\n  Second, further guidance as to whether the 911 callâ€™s content is a testimonial statement is provided in Crawford when we are given various examples of the type of out of court statements that fit within the class of testimonial statements.Â  The broad categories of â€œvarious formulations of this core class of â€˜testimonialâ€™ statements,â€ are â€œex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalentâ€ and out of court â€œsimilar pre-trial statements.â€Â  Among this type of pretrial statements, the Supreme Court lists, â€œpre-trial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially,â€ and â€œstatements that were made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€\r\n\r\n___ N.Y.S.2d ___,Â  2004 WL 3048648 at *3 (citations omitted).Â  The court found â€œ[t]he 911 statement fits . . . within the type of statement that was â€˜made under the circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  ___ N.Y.S.2d ___,Â  2004 WL 3048648Â  at *3 (citation omitted).\r\nAdditionally, the court found the statement analogous to a statement made during a police interrogation.Â  The statement was â€œobtained by â€˜Police Operator 1521.â€™â€ ___ N.Y.S.2d ___, 2004 WL 3048648 at *4.Â  Thus, â€œ[g]iven Crawfordâ€™s broad statement that testimonial statements include the â€˜functional equivalentâ€™ of some of the â€˜various formulations of the core class of testimonial statements,â€™ it follows that a formal statement to a government officer, who is a police operator officially designated to formally obtain these statements, is the functional equivalent of a formal statement to a police officer.â€Â  Id.Â  Concomitantly, the court found the statement was testimonial. \r\nIn State v. Powers, 99 P.3d 1262 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004), the Washington Court of Appeals weighed in on the testimonial debate by adopting a case-by-case approach to 911 calls.Â  Powers appealed his conviction for violating a domestic violence protection order on the ground that the trial court erred in admitting a 911 recording.Â  The victim called 911 and informed the dispatcher that Powers was in her home in violation of an order.Â  The police promptly responded, and Powers was apprehended.Â  On appeal, he argued that the callerâ€™s statement to the 911 operator fell squarely within the pretrial statements that declarants would reasonably expect to be used prosecutorially.\r\nThe court took note of the â€œdichotomy between a plea for help and testimonial statements in 911 calls,â€ id. at 1265 (citing Richard Friedman &amp; Bridget McCormack, Dial-In Testimony, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1177 (2002)), Â and announced:\r\n\r\n  We reject the Stateâ€™s request for a bright line rule admitting all 911 recordings because a rule would likely result in the vice Crawford seeks to redress: A â€œcapacity to admit core testimonial statements that the Confrontation Clause plainly meant to exclude.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1371.Â  Instead, we hold that the trial court, on a case-by-case basis, can best assess the proposed admission of a 911 recording as testimonial or nontestimonial and whether the statement originates from interrogation.\r\n\r\n99 P.3d at 1266.Â  \r\nThe record showed that the victim â€œcalled 911 to report Powerâ€™s violation of the existing protective order and described Powers to assist in his apprehension and prosecution, rather than to protect herself or her child from his return.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the call was deemed testimonial.Â  \r\nThe Illinois Appellate Court, in People v. West, ___ N.E.2d ___,Â  2005 WL 44003 (Ill. App. Ct. 2005), reviewed Moscat, Cortes, and Powers and found those opinions helpful in formulating the following approach to statements made to 911 operators: \r\n\r\n  First, as in Powers, we reject any bright line rule which would hold a 911 call testimonial or not testimonial in nature.Â  Rather, we believe that a court should determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the statement made to the 911 dispatcher was: (1) volunteered for the purpose of initiating police action or criminal prosecution; or (2) provided in response to an interrogation, the purpose of which was to gather evidence for use in a criminal prosecution.Â  In the first instance, the statement is testimonial in nature because an objective individual would reasonably believe that when he or she reports a crime they are â€œbearing witnessâ€ and that their statement will be available for use at future criminal proceedings.Â  Cortes, 781 N.Y.S.2d at 415-16.Â  In the later case, the statement is testimonial in nature because it is the product of evidence-producing questions, the responses to which, if used to convict a defendant, would implicate the central concerns underlying the confrontation clause.Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1365.Â  Second, in performing this analysis, a court should examine a callerâ€™s statement in the same manner as it would a victimâ€™s statement to a treating medical professional.Â  Accordingly, statements which are made â€œto gain immediate official assistance in ending or relieving an exigent, perhaps dangerous, situationâ€ (Richard Friedman, Bridget McCormack, Dial-In Testimony, 150 U. Pa. L. Rev 1171, 1242 (2002)) are comparable to those made to medical personnel regarding â€œdescriptions of the cause of symptom, pain or sensations, or the inception or general character of the cause or external source thereofâ€ (725 ILCS 5/115-13 (West 2002)) and, as such, are not testimonial in nature.Â  However, statements volunteered for the purpose of â€œinvoking police action and the prosecutorial processâ€ (Cortes, 781 N.Y.S.2d at 416), or responses to questions posed for the purpose of collecting information â€œuseful to the criminal justice system,â€ (150 U. Pa. L. Rev. at 1242) are testimonial in nature.\r\n\r\n___ N.E.2d at ___, 2005 WL 44003 at *8. \r\nBased on its formulation, the West court found statements made to a 911 operator â€œconcerning the nature of the alleged attack, . . . medical needs, . . . age and locationâ€ were nontestimonial, whereas statements which described the victimâ€™s vehicle, â€œthe direction in which her assailants fled, and the items of personal property they tookâ€ were testimonial.Â  ___ N.E.2d at ___, 2005 WL 44003 at * 9\r\n\r\n  \r\n    b.Â Â Â Â Â  Statements Made During Police Investigations\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs with statements to 911 operators, courts have struggled with statements made to police during field investigations.Â  Crawfordâ€™s holding explicitly finds that â€œ[s]tatements taken by police officers in the course of interrogations are also testimonial under even a narrow standard.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  The Court used the term â€œâ€˜interrogationâ€™ in its colloquial, rather than any technical legal, sense.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1365 n.4 (citation omitted).Â  Therefore, various definitions of â€œinterrogationâ€ are apt to arise, and the Court limited its guidance to holding that â€œSylviaâ€™s recorded statement, knowingly given in response to structured police questioning, qualifies under any conceivable definition.â€Â  Id.Â  Whether all statements made to police, regardless of the context in which they were made, should be treated as testimonial has been viewed differently by courts.Â  \r\nIn Lopez v. State, 888 So.2d 693 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004), police were dispatched to an apartment complex to investigate a report of kidnapping and assault.Â  Once there, Officer Gaston encountered Ruiz in the parking lot.Â  The officer asked Ruiz what had occurred, and Ruiz replied that the defendant had held him at gunpoint in Ruizâ€™s car and that the gun was still in his vehicle.Â  A jury convicted Lopez for possession of a firearm by a convicted felon.Â  Ruiz was not available for trial, and the defendant appealed his conviction, contending the admission of Ruizâ€™s statement to police violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause. \r\nThe Lopez court analyzed Ruizâ€™s statement under each of the three formulations of the core class of testimonial statements given by the Crawford Court.Â  First, although the statement was in response to a question by a police officer, the court found it â€œdoubtful that the questioning could be regarded as an â€˜interrogation.â€™â€Â  Id. at 698.Â  Second, the statement did not fall within the second category of out-of-court statements made in â€œâ€˜formalized testimonial materialsâ€™â€ because â€œit was not made with the kind of formality the Court was referring to in Crawford.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIt was not the kind of solemn or deliberate statement a person would make in an affidavit or a deposition.â€Â  Id.Â  Finally, whether the statement would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial wasÂ  â€œa more difficult question.â€Â  Id.Â  Under this third category, the courtâ€™s focus was on â€œthe purpose for which the statement [wa]s made, not on the emotional state of the declarant.â€Â  Id. at 699.Â  In contrast to a spontaneous statement made to a friend or family member,\r\n\r\n  a startled person who identifies a suspect in a statement made to a police officer at the scene of a crime surely knows that the statement is a form of accusation that will be used against the suspect.Â  In this situation, the statement does not lose its character as a testimonial statement merely because the declarant was excited at the time it was made.\r\n\r\nId. at 699-700.Â  Therefore, the court concluded that Ruizâ€™s statement was testimonial:\r\n\r\n  While it is true that Ruiz was nervous and speaking rapidly, he surely must have expected that the statement he made to Officer Gaston might be used in court against the defendant. . . . Even in his excitement, Ruiz knew that he was making a formal report of the incident and that his report would be used against the defendant. \r\n\r\nId. at 700.Â  \r\nGeorgia courts have adopted a broad interpretation of interrogation and have generally found statements made to police are testimonial.Â  In Moody v State, 594 S.E.2d 350 (Ga. 2004), Moody was charged with the murder of Rebecca Norman.Â  The Confrontation Clause issue arose from statements Norman made to police two years before her murder, when Moody had fired a shotgun into her bedroom window.Â  At trial, an officer testified about what Norman told him shortly after Moody shot into the bedroom in which she was sleeping.Â  The courtâ€™s discussion of testimonial was limited to the following statement made in a footnote: â€œthe [Crawford] Court stated that the term [testimonial] certainly applies to statements made in a police interrogation, and it appears that the term encompasses the type of field investigation of witnesses at issue here.â€Â  Id. at 354 n. 6.Â  \r\nThe Georgia Supreme Court, in Bell v. State, 597 S.E.2d 350 (Ga. 2004), cited Crawford and Moody to support its conclusion that the trial court erred in admitting â€œout-of-court statements that the victim had made to police officers during the course of the officersâ€™ investigations of complaints made by the victim against Mr. Bell.â€Â  Id. at 353.Â  See also Brawner v. State, 602 S.E.2d 612, 613 (Ga. 2004) (finding testimonial the statement a witness gave to police several days after shooting claiming the witness observed the appellant shoot the victim several times while the victim lay on the ground saying â€œDonâ€™t kill me.â€); Jenkins v. State, 604 S.E.2d 789, 795 (Ga. 2004) (â€œSince Crawford v. Washington, we have interpreted â€˜testimonial statementsâ€™ to include those statements made by witnesses to police officers investigating a crime.â€) (citing Moody, Bell, and Brawner) (footnote omitted); Pitts v. State, ___ S.E.2d ___, ___, 2005 WL 127049 *3 (Ga. App. 2005) (â€œSince Crawford, our courts have interpreted â€œtestimonialâ€ statements to include those statements made by witnesses to police officers investigating a crime.â€).\r\nHowever, a number of courts have concluded statements are not testimonial solely because they are made to police.Â  In People v. Mackey, 785 N.Y.S.2d 870 (N.Y. Crim. Ct. 2004), eight on-duty police officers were patrolling in a marked van when the victim waved to them, requesting assistance.Â  The victim was crying, and her face was red and swollen.Â  One of the officers, Officer Melenciano, â€œasked her what was wrong and she stated that her boyfriend had punched her in the face and pushed her down and then tried to take her children.â€Â  Id. at 871.Â \r\nThe Mackey court began by recognizing that \r\n\r\n  courts in New York and throughout the country have held that responses to police officers during a preliminary field investigation are not barred as â€œtestimonialâ€ statements under Crawford if the statements and the circumstances in which the statements were made lack the requisite formality to constitute a police interrogation.Â  See People v. Newland, 6 A.D.3d 330, 775 N.Y.S.2d 308 (1st Dept. 2004) (concluding that a brief, informal remark to an officer conducting a field investigation which was not made in response to structured police questioning should not be considered a testimonial statement); State v. Forrest, 164 N.C. App. 272, 596 S.E.2d 22 (Court of Appeals of North Carolina, 2004) (holding statements initiated by complaining witness to police immediately after rescue were non-testimonial in nature).Â  But cf. Moody v. State, 277 Ga. 676, 594 S.E.2d 350 (Ga. 2004) (finding statements of deceased victim to a police officer during a field investigation of a previous, separate incident two years prior involving defendant were testimonial and admission of this testimony was error).Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 872-73.Â  \r\nThe court engaged in a â€œfact-specific analysis of the particular nature and circumstances of the statementsâ€ that considered \r\n\r\n  the extent of a formalized setting in which the statements were made, if and how the statements were recorded, the declarantâ€™s primary purpose in making the statements, whether an objective declarant would believe those statements would be used to initiate prosecutorial action and later at trial, and specifically with cases involving statements to law enforcement, the existence of any structured questioning and whether the declarant initiated the contact.\r\n\r\nId. at 873-74.Â  Under the facts of Mackey, the victimâ€™s statements were nontestimonial and their admission did not violate the Confrontation Clause.Â  \r\nHammon v. State, 809 N.E.2d 945 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), involved a conviction for domestic battery.Â  Officer Mooney was dispatched to a residence occupied by Hammon and A.H., the victim.Â  Officer Mooney separated Hammon from A.H., and A.H. told the officer that Hammon had thrown her down into shattered glass and punched her twice in the chest.Â  A.H. did not testify at trial.Â  Instead, the court allowed Officer Mooney to relate A.H.â€™s statements to the jury.Â  \r\nThe Hammon court held: \r\n\r\n  the statement A.H. gave to Officer Mooney was not a â€œtestimonialâ€ statement.Â  It appears to us that the common denominator underlying the Supreme Courtâ€™s discussion of what constitutes a â€œtestimonialâ€ statement is the official and formal quality of such a statement.Â  A.H.â€™s oral statement was not given in a formal setting even remotely resembling an inquiry before King James Iâ€™s Privy Council; it was not given during any type of pre-trial hearing or deposition; it was not contained within a â€œformalizedâ€ document of any kind.\r\n\r\nId. at 952 (footnote omitted).\r\nFurther, the court addressed the closer question whether A.H.â€™s statement was the product of a police interrogation:\r\n\r\n  [W]e observe that the Supreme Court chose not to say that any police questioning of a witness would make any statement given in response thereto â€œtestimonialâ€; rather, it expressly limited its holding to police â€œinterrogation.â€Â  We conclude this choice of words clearly indicates that police â€œinterrogationâ€ is not the same as, and is much narrower than, police â€œquestioning.â€\r\n\r\nId. \r\nThus, the court reached the conclusion that â€œwhen police arrive at the scene of an incident in response to a request for assistance and begin informally questioning those nearby immediately thereafter in order to determine what has happened, statements given in response thereto are not â€˜testimonial.â€™â€Â  Id. \r\nAdditionally, A.H. completed a battery affidavit that was admitted at trial.Â  The Hammon court noted that the battery affidavit â€œwould probably qualify as a â€˜testimonialâ€™ statement,â€ id. at 952 n.5, but found admission of the affidavit harmless because it was cumulative of Officer Mooneyâ€™s properly admitted testimony regarding A.H.â€™s statements.Â  Id. at 948 n.1 (citation omitted).Â  See also Fowler v. State, 809 N.E.2d 960, 968 (Ind. Ct. App. 2004), transfer granted (Dec. 9, 2004) (â€œAn unrehearsed statement made without reflection or deliberation, as required to be an â€˜excited utterance,â€™ is not â€˜testimonialâ€™ in that such a statement, by definition, has not been made in contemplation of its use in a future trial.â€) (citations omitted).\r\nIn State v. Barnes, 854 A.2d 208 (Me. 2004), Barnes was convicted of murdering his mother.Â  The testimony at trial included that of an officer who asseverated that prior to the murder, Barnesâ€™s mother â€œdrove herself to the police station . . . . and said that her son had assaulted her and had threatened to kill her more than once during the day.â€Â  Id. at 209.Â  The Barnes court found the statements nontestimonial because: (1) the police did not seek out Barnesâ€™s mother; (2) her statements were made while she was still under the stress of the attack; and (3) she was not responding to â€œtactically structured police questioning as in Crawford, but was instead seeking safety and aid.â€Â  Id. at 211.Â  \r\nIn Leavitt v. Arave, 383 F.3d 809 (9th Cir. 2004), after concluding that Elgâ€™s statements to the 911 dispatcher were nontestimonial, see supra, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals turned to Elgâ€™s statements made to the police who responded to the 911 call.Â  The court found that Elg\r\n\r\n  was in no way being interrogated by [police] but instead sought their help in ending a frightening intrusion into her home.Â  Thus, we do not believe that the admission of her hearsay statements against Leavitt implicate the principal evil at which the Confrontation Clause was directed . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 830 n.22 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  \r\nAfter determining that statements to the 911 operator were not testimonial, the court in State v. Wright, 686 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004), review granted (Nov. 23, 2004), declined to answer the â€œcloser questionâ€ whether statements made to police were testimonial.Â  The Wright court found that any error in admission would be harmless.Â  However, the court did state, in dictum, â€œWe are not convinced that a police response to an incident when the victims are in distress and primarily concerned with ensuring that their assailant has been apprehended satisfies any of the formulations or examples of testimonial hearsay provided by the Supreme Court.â€Â  Id. at 305. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    c.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Statements by Children\r\n  \r\n\r\nA third category of cases exploring the definition of testimonial is that of statements by children.Â  This category may be bifurcated into statements made to government personnel and statements made to parents or other persons not employed by the government.Â  The cases often, though not always, arise where the child declarant has been sexually abused.Â  Most courts have found that a childâ€™s statement to a government figure is testimonial.Â  However, they do not always follow a consistent rationale.Â  \r\nIn Snowden v. State, 846 A.2d 36 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 2004), shortly after the Supreme Court issued the Crawford opinion, the Court of Special Appeals of Maryland addressed Crawfordâ€™s applicability to statements by children in the context of child abuse.Â  Snowden was convicted of seven counts of child abuse and related offenses.Â  The convictions arose from alleged sexual contact with three different minor females, two of whom were ten years old and one of whom was eight.Â  The children did not testify at trial; instead, a social worker was allowed to relate their testimony pursuant to a Maryland statute.Â  See id. at 39 (quoting Md. Code Ann., Crim. Proc. Â§ 11-304 (2002)).Â  The social worker based her testimony on one unrecorded interview with each of the children, in which she used non-leading and general questions to elicit details of the abuse. \r\nThe Snowden court was persuaded the childrenâ€™s statements, testified to by the social worker, were testimonial: \r\n\r\n  As the trial court stated: â€œThe children were interviewed for the expressed purpose of developing their testimony by [the social worker], under the relevant Maryland statute that provides for the testimony of certain persons in lieu of a child, in a child sexual abuse case . . . .â€Â  In light of Crawford, appellant is entitled to a new trial at which the State will be prohibited from introducing any testimonial hearsay declarations of a person who (1) is available to testify, or (2) made the testimonial hearsay statements on an occasion at which the defendant did not have an opportunity for cross-examination.\r\n\r\nId. at 47 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\nIn People v. Sisavath, 13 Cal.Rptr.3d 753 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), Sisavath was accused of sexually abusing two children whom the court referred to as Victim 1 and Victim 2.Â  The evidence at trial included two hearsay statements of Victim 2: the first a statement to a police officer and the second a videotaped interview with a â€œtrained interviewer at Fresno Countyâ€™s Multidisciplinary Interview Center (MDIC).â€Â  Id. at 756.Â  The trial court admitted both statements, but the California Court of Appeal reversed.Â  \r\nFirst, the court found it â€œclear that Victim 2â€™s statement to Officer Vincent was testimonial under Crawford.â€Â  Id. at 757.Â  This statement was â€œâ€˜knowingly given in response to structured police questioning.â€™Â  The People concede this.â€Â  Id. \r\nSecond, the court addressed the videotaped interview, which took place after the original complaint had been filed and a preliminary hearing had been held.Â  â€œThe deputy district attorney who prosecuted the case was present in the interview, along with an investigator from the district attorneyâ€™s office.Â  The interview was conducted by a â€˜forensic interview specialist.â€™â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the court concluded: â€œUnder these circumstances, there is no serious question but that Victim 2â€™s statement was made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial.â€Â  Id. at 757-58 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  \r\nThus, the Sisavath court adopted the third and most expansive Crawford formulation of testimonial, and concluded that the Supreme Courtâ€™s reference to â€œobjective witnessâ€ meant an â€œobjective observer,â€ not â€œan objective witness in the same category of persons as the actual witnessâ€”here, an objective four-year-old.â€Â  Id. at 758 n.3.Â  \r\nPeople v. Vigil, 104 P.3d 258 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Dec. 20, 2004), reached a similar result as Sisavath, but with a potentially significant difference in reasoning.Â  The defendant in Vigil was convicted for sexually assaulting a seven-year-old boy.Â  At trial, the State showed portions of a videotaped police interview of the child.Â  The boy did not testify at trial, and the defendant argued that admission of the videotape violated his rights under the Confrontation Clause.Â  \r\nIn finding the videotape was testimonial, the Vigil court rejected the Peopleâ€™s argument that the statement was not testimonial because â€œit was not made during the course of a police interrogation and because a seven-year-old child would not reasonably expect his statements to be used prosecutorially.â€Â  Id. at 262.Â  The court explained that â€œ[a]lthough the interview in this case was conducted in a relaxed atmosphere, with open-ended, nonleading questions, and although no oath was administered at the outset, it nevertheless amounted to interrogation under Crawford.â€Â  Id.Â  The court noted that the interviewing officer â€œtold [the child] he needed to tell the truth,â€ and when officer asked the child what should happen to the defendant, â€œthe child replied that defendant should go to jail.â€Â  Id.Â  Therefore, while the Vigil court did not expressly state the objective witness test should consider the age of the actual witness, the court did apply such a test under the facts before it.\r\nIn People ex rel. R.A.S., ___ P.3d ___, 2004 WL 1351383 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004), the defendant, a juvenile, allegedly â€œtouched the genitals of a four-year-old boy (the victim) and persuaded the victim to perform oral sex upon him.â€Â  Id. at ___, 2004 WL 1351383 at * 1.Â  The victim did not testify.Â  Instead, a police investigator, who conducted a videotaped forensic interview of the victim, testified.Â  The videotaped interview was introduced as well.Â  \r\nThe court noted that â€œthe statement was taken by an investigating officer in a question and answer format appropriate to a child.â€Â  Id. at ___, 2004 WL 1351383 at *4.Â  The court then announced its holding: â€œThe statement was â€˜testimonialâ€™ within even the narrowest formulation of the Courtâ€™s definition of that term.Â  We thus conclude that the statement was not admissible at trial.â€Â  Id.Â Â  (citations omitted).Â  \r\nState v. Courtney, 682 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. Ct. App. 2004),Â  differs from Snowden, Sisavath, Vigil, and R.A.S. in that the child in Courtney was not sexually abused, but was a witness in a domestic assault action.Â  However, the rationale behind finding the minor childâ€™s statement testimonial is similar to the child abuse cases.Â  \r\nCourtney was tried and convicted for assaulting the mother of the child declarant.Â  The child made statements during a videotaped interview that on the night in question, she heard things breaking, heard her mother crying, and witnessed Courtney threatening her mother with two guns.Â  The State offered the videotaped interview at trial, and on appeal the court held:\r\n\r\n  [The childâ€™s] statement is testimonial.Â  A child-protection worker, along with a law enforcement officer, interviewed [the child] for the purpose of developing a case against Courtney. . . .Â  At one point, the interview was stopped by the police officer when he directed the child-protection worker to ask [the child] to draw the guns she saw Courtney allegedly use to threaten [the victim].Â  The circumstances under which the interview was conducted show it was made in preparation for the case against Courtney.\r\n\r\nId. at 196.\r\nThe Michigan Court of Appeals, has found, in dictum, that a childâ€™s statements to an interviewer are not testimonial.Â  In People v. Geno, 683 N.W.2d 687 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004), theÂ  court found the defendant had not properly preserved and presented a Crawford claim, but that even if he had, the childâ€™s statement â€œdid not constitute testimonial evidence under Crawford, and therefore was not barred by the Confrontation Clause.â€Â  Id. at 692.Â  There, the defendant allegedly sexually assaulted his girlfriendâ€™s two-year-old daughter.Â  The contested hearsay statement was uttered during an interview by the Childrenâ€™s Assessment Center.Â  â€œThe interviewer noticed blood in the childâ€™s pull-up underpants and asked the child if she â€˜had an owie?â€™Â  The child answered, â€˜yes, Dale [defendant] hurts me here,â€™ pointing to her vaginal area.â€Â  Id. at 689. \r\nIn ruling the hearsay nontestimonial, the court explicated:\r\n\r\n  The childâ€™s statement was made to the executive director of the Childrenâ€™s Assessment Center, not to a government employee, and the childâ€™s answer to the question whether she had an â€œowieâ€ was not a statement in the nature of ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 692 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nAt least two cases have held a childâ€™s statement to a parent is nontestimonial.Â  In Herrera-Vega v. State, 888 So.2d 66 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004), the court found that testimonial evidence â€œdoes not appear to include the spontaneous statements made by D.H. to her mother while being dressed, nor does it include D.H.â€™s statements to her father.â€Â  Id. at 69.Â  Similarly, the court in Somervell v. State, 883 So.2d 836 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004) held: â€œIt seems to us that statements that a mother hears from her autistic child does not fit within the umbra or penumbra ofâ€ any of the categories of testimonial set forth by the Crawford Court.Â  Id. at 838.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    d.Â Â Â Â Â  Statements Made to Family, Friends, or Acquaintances\r\n  \r\n\r\nFinally, numerous opinions from around the country have determined that statements made to friends, family, or acquaintances do not constitute testimonial hearsay.Â  \r\nIn United States v. Hendricks, 395 F.3d 173 (3rd Cir. 2005), a grand jury indicted Hendricks and several other defendants for conspiracy, narcotics possession and distribution, and money laundering.Â  At issue was the admissibility of surveillance tapes obtained pursuant to a court order under 18 U.S.C. Â§ 2510 et seq.Â  The Hendricks court found the taped statements were not the type of statements Crawford meant to affect:Â  \r\nFirst and foremost, the recorded conversations here at issue neither fall within nor are analogous to any of the specific examples of testimonial statements mentioned by the Court. Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374 (listing â€œprior testimony [given] at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial[,] and . . . police interrogationsâ€ as examples of obviously testimonial statements). Second, the recorded conversations do not qualify as â€œtestimonialâ€ under any of the three definitions mentioned by the Court.Â  They are not â€œex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent,â€ nor are they â€œextrajudicial statements . . . contained in formalized . . . materials, such as affidavits, depositions, prior testimony, or confessions.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (internal citations and quotations omitted).Â  Each of the examples referred to by the Court or the definitions it considered entails a formality to the statement absent from the recorded statements at issue here.Â  Even considered in perspective of the broad definition offered by the NACDL, the Title III recordings cannot be deemed â€œtestimonialâ€ as the speakers certainly did not make the statements thinking that they â€œâ€˜would be available for use at a later trial.â€™â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (quoting Brief of NACDL).Â  Rather, the very purpose of Title III intercepts is to capture conversations that the participants believe are not being heard by the authorities and will not be available for use in a prosecution.\r\nA witness â€œwho makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â  The Title III recordings here at issue are much more similar to the latter than the former.Â  Therefore, as recognized by other courts that have addressed similar issues, we find that the surreptitiously monitored conversations and statements contained in the Title III recordings are not â€œtestimonialâ€ for purposes of Crawford.\r\n395 F.3d at 181.\r\nIn Ramirez v. Dretke, ___ F.3d ___, 2005 WL 174643 (5th Cir. 2005), Ramirez was convicted of murdering his ex-wifeâ€™s boyfriend.Â  Ramirez hired Bell to assist him with the murder.Â  Prior to the killing, Bell told Hoogstra that Ramirez had hired Bell to kill a fireman, and after the murder, Bell described the killing to Hoogstra.Â  Both Ramirez and the State maintained that â€œBellâ€™s out-of-court statements [were] not â€˜testimonial evidenceâ€™ as that term is used in Crawford.â€Â  Id. at *3 n.3.Â  The court agreed, noting there is â€œnothing in Crawford to suggest that â€˜testimonial evidenceâ€™ includes spontaneous out-of-court statements made outside any arguably judicial or investigatory context.â€Â  Id.\r\nEvans was convicted of murdering his estranged wife.Â  At issue in Evans v. Luebbers, 371 F.3d 438 (8th Cir. 2004), were a number of statements the wife made before her death, including that she was afraid of Evans, that â€œIâ€™ll be like another Nicole Simpson,â€ that she was abused by Evans, and that she was planning to divorce him.Â  Id. at 444.Â  The court, with little explanation, found Crawford inapplicable because the hearsay statements of Evansâ€™s wife did not fit within â€œprior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; [or] to police interrogations.â€Â  Id. at 445 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  See also United States v. Manfre, 368 F.3d 832, 838 n.1 (8th Cir. 2004) (finding hearsay statements made to â€œloved ones or acquaintances . . . are not the kind of memorialized, judicial-process-created evidence of which Crawford speaks.â€).Â  \r\nIn People v. Butler, ___ Cal.Rptr.3d ___, 2005 WL 428210 (2005), a homicide witness made spontaneous statements to co-workers regarding a murder.Â  The court rejected appellantâ€™s argument that an objective observer would reasonably foresee that the statements could be used in a prosecution.Â  In the courtâ€™s view, this argument was contrary to Crawfordâ€™s focus on â€œstatements given in lieu of oral testimony, such as an affidavit, or given to a government official in a formal statement.â€Â  Id. at *6. \r\nPeople v. Cervantes, 12 Cal.Rptr.3d 774 (Cal. Ct. App. 2004), involved a statement made to an acquaintance who rendered medical aid following a murder.Â  A neighbor of Morales, one of three defendants, was a surgical medical assistant who had known Morales for approximately twelve years.Â  The court found that Moralesâ€™s statement to his neighbor was not similar to grand jury testimony or a statement taken by an officer during an investigation.Â  The statement was testimonial, â€œif at all, only under the definition quoted from the amici brief . . . which asserted testimonial statements include those made under circumstances which would lead an objective witness reasonably to believe that the statement would be available for use at a later trial[.]â€Â  Id. at 782 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).Â  The court rejected the argument that Morales made the statement knowing his neighbor would repeat it to police.Â  Instead, the court found:\r\n\r\n  . . . Morales sought medical assistance from a friend of long standing who had come to visit his home.Â  Moralesâ€™s statement appears to have been made without any reasonable expectation it would be used at a later trial.Â  Rather, it seems far more likely Morales expected Ojeda would not repeat anything he told her to the police.Â  Indeed, Ojeda admitted she knew appellants were gang members and indicated she was afraid to testify in this case.\r\n\r\nId. at 783.\r\nIn State v. Rivera, 844 A.2d 191 (Conn. 2004), the defendant and Michael Glanville allegedly murdered Audrey Lover and set fire to her house.Â  The Rivera court found that incriminating statements Glanville made to his nephew during a car ride did not fall within any of the formulations of the core class of testimonial statements discussed in Crawford.Â  Id. at 202.\r\nIn Demons v. State, 595 S.E.2d 76 (Ga. 2004), the victim confided in Bohr, a coworker, several days before the victim was murdered.Â  Bohr testified that â€œthe victim was distressed and had bruises on his upper arms and chest, that he began crying and told her where the bruises came from, that she had never seen anybody so afraid of anyone else, and that he said that Demons was going to kill him.â€Â  Id.Â  at 79.Â  The statements were declared nontestimonial because they â€œwere not remotely similar to such prior testimony or police interrogation, as they were made in a conversation with a friend, before the commission of any crime, and without any reasonable expectation that they would be used at a later trial.â€Â  Id. at 80 (citation omitted).\r\nPeople v. Shepherd, 689 N.W.2d 721 (Mich. Ct. App. 2004), found statements the defendantâ€™s boyfriend, Bobby Butters, made to relatives visiting him in jail, which jail guards overheard, were â€œclearly not testimonial.â€Â  Id. at 729.Â  Butters â€œwas speaking to relatives, not to the guards, and made spontaneous, unprompted comments regarding his role in the fleeing and eluding and assault.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, â€œ[e]ven under the broadest definition of testimonial, it is unlikely that Mr. Butters would have reasonably believed that the statements would be available for use at a later trial.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn State v. Blackstock, 598 S.E.2d 412 (N.C. Ct. App. 2004), Weeks was shot while working at a convenience store he owned and operated.Â  He died five days later, but before his death, and while he was in the hospital, Weeks made several statements to his wife and daughter.Â  The trial court allowed these statements over the defendantâ€™s objection.Â  The Court of Appeals of North Carolina concluded â€œthe statements made by Weeks to his wife and daughter were essentially nontestimonial in nature.â€Â  Id. at 420.Â  The statements were â€œpersonal conversations that took place over a series of several days, made at a time when Weeksâ€™ physical condition was improving.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the court found it unlikely that Weeks made the statements under the reasonable belief that they would be used prosecutorially.Â  \r\nWoods v. State, 152 S.W.3d 105 (Tex. Crim. App. 2004), found incriminating statements made by a co-defendant to acquaintances at a coffee shop were nontestimonial.Â  The statements were â€œcasual remarks . . . made to acquaintances.â€Â  Id. at 114 (footnote omitted).\r\nIn State v. Orndorff, 95 P.3d 406 (Wash. Ct. App. 2004),Â  two masked men forced their way into Nordbyâ€™s house.Â  Nordby, who was upstairs at the time with Lorina Coble and several others, heard his minor son screaming and went downstairs to investigate.Â  Norby engaged in a struggle with the two men, both of whom were armed.Â  The intruders eventually subdued Nordby, but they fled after a 911 dispatch operator returned Cobleâ€™s call which had been aborted.Â  Coble did not testify at trial, but the trial court allowed Nordby to testify that â€œCoble told him she saw a man with a pistol downstairs, saw both men leave, she tried to call 911, and was panic-stricken.â€Â  Id. at 408.Â  The court found Cobleâ€™s statement nontestimonial: â€œIt was not a declaration or affirmation made to establish or prove some fact; it was not prior testimony or a statement given in response to police questioning; and coble had no reason to expect that her statement would be used prosecutorially.â€Â  Id. \r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Application to the Case Sub Judice\r\nHillâ€™s statements to Hicks were nontestimonial.Â  First, the utterances do not fit within those examples that Crawford says clearly are testimonialâ€”i.e., they were not testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; or statements made to police during an investigation.Â  See Crawford, 541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  \r\nNext, we turn to the trilogy of formulations mentioned by the Crawford opinion.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364.Â Â  We need not adopt any of the three formulations because, in this case, the hearsay declarations are nontestimonial under each test.Â  Hillâ€™s statements were not ex parte in-court testimony or its functional equivalent, and they were not extrajudicial statements contained in formalized materials; to the contrary, Hillâ€™s remarks were totally devoid of any formality or governmental involvement.Â  As to the third formulation, we find no evidence that a reasonable speaker in Hillâ€™s position would believe the statements made would be available for use at a later trial.Â  Hillâ€™s statements were made to warn an acquaintance not to purchase a gun that had just been used in a murder.Â  Furthermore, the statements could incriminate Hill.Â  Therefore, we are unconvinced that Hill, or a person in his position, would have uttered the statements with the reasonable belief they later would be used prosecutorially.Â  \r\nHillâ€™s declarations are much more akin to casual remarks to an acquaintance than formal statements to government officers.Â  See Crawford at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1364 (observing an â€œaccuser who makes a formal statement to government officers bears testimony in a sense that a person who makes a casual remark to an acquaintance does not.â€).Â  Moreover, they bear no resemblance to the sort of examinations by justices of the peace which the Crawford Court stressed were the real impetus behind the Confrontation Clause.Â  We hold that Hillâ€™s statements to Hicks were nontestimonial; therefore, Crawford does not mandate that Davis be afforded the opportunity to test Hillâ€™s statement through cross-examination.\r\nHowever, our analysis does not end here.Â  Under Crawford, â€œ[w]here nontestimonial hearsay is at issue, it is wholly consistent with the Framersâ€™ design to afford the States flexibility in their development of hearsay lawâ€”as does Roberts, and as would an approach that exempted such statements from Confrontation Clause scrutiny altogether.â€Â  541 U.S. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  Accordingly, we turn to analyze whether Hillâ€™s hearsay statements fall under a firmly rooted hearsay exception or else bear particularized guarantees of trustworthiness.Â  Roberts, 448 U.S. at 66.\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Reliability Under Ohio v. RobertsÂ  \r\n\r\n  1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Rule Against Hearsay\r\n\r\nâ€œâ€˜Hearsayâ€™ is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Hearsay statements are not admissible unless otherwise provided by the South Carolina Rules of Evidence or by other rules prescribed by the South Carolina Supreme Court or by statute.Â  Rule 802, SCRE.Â  \r\nThe trial judge admitted Hillâ€™s declarations as statements made in furtherance of a conspiracy, see Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE, and ruled that the utterances were not admissible as present sense impressions.Â  Neither Hill nor Davis was charged with conspiracy and no evidence of a conspiracy exists.Â  On appeal, the State concedes that admitting the declarations as statements by a coconspirator was erroneous.Â  However, the State argues that admission of the statements should be upheld under the excited utterance exception found in Rule 803(2), SCRE.Â  We address this exception pursuant to Rule 220(C), SCACR (â€œThe appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal.â€).Â  See also Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).\r\n\r\n  2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Excited Utterance Exception\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 803(2), a statement â€œrelating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or conditionâ€ is not excluded by the hearsay rule, regardless whether the declarant is available as a witness.Â  Rule 803(2), SCRE; see also State v. Sims, 348 S.C. 16, 20, 558 S.E.2d 518, 520 (2002) (â€œAn excited utterance is a statement relating to a startling event or condition made while the declarant was under the stress of excitement caused by the event or condition.â€).\r\nBoth the United States Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have declared that excited utterance is a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  White v. Illinios, 502 U.S. 346, 355 n.8 (â€œThere can be no doubt that the two exceptions we consider in this case are â€˜firmly rooted.â€™Â  The exception for spontaneous declarations is at least two centuries old . . . .Â  It is currently recognized under Federal Rule of Evidence 803(2), and in nearly four-fifths of the States.â€); State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 45, 515 S.E.2d 525, 531 (1999) (â€œWe . . . find that the excited utterance exception is firmly rooted in South Carolina law and satisfies the requirements of the Confrontation Clause.â€); accord State v. Dennis 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999).Â  Accordingly, we must determine whether Hillâ€™s statements qualify under the excited utterance exception to the hearsay rule.Â  If so, they were properly admitted.Â  \r\nThree elements must be met to show a statement is an excited utterance: (1) the statement must relate to a startling event or condition; (2) the statement must have been made while the declarant was under the stress of the excitement; and (3) the stress must have been caused by the startling event or condition.Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 21, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  The court must consider the totality of the circumstances in determining whether a statement falls within the excited utterance exception.Â  State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153, 160, 553 S.E.2d 464, 468 (Ct. App. 2001); State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001).Â  â€œThe rationale behind the excited utterance exception is that the startling event suspends the declarantâ€™s process of reflective thought, reducing the likelihood of fabrication.â€Â  LaCoste at 160, 553 S.E.2d at 468 (quoting State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 284, 523 S.E.2d 173, 177 (1999)).\r\nTime is a factor in the excited utterance analysis, and our courts have allowed intervals in excess of an hour, even up to eleven hours, between the startling event and the statement.Â  See State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 328, 247 S.E.2d 334, 336 (1978).Â  Courts have disallowed use of the excited utterance exception when an unusually long time period passed before the statement was made and the declarant had time to compose himself or herself or had other opportunities to speak.Â  See State v. Whisonant, 335 S.C. 148, 515 S.E.2d 768 (Ct. App. 1999) (rejecting use of the exception based on ten-hour interval and two intervening opportunities to speak in which the declarant said nothing); Burroughs, 328 S.C. at 500-01, 492 S.E.2d at 413-14 (finding no excited utterance when there was a ten-hour interval and the declarant said she used the time to compose herself).Â  The Burroughs court noted a useful rule of thumb that when enough time has elapsed between the event and the statement to permit reflective thought, the statement should be excluded.Â  Id. at 500, 492 S.E.2d at 413.Â  Use of the exception has been overturned when the interval cannot be determined from the record.Â  State v. Garcia, 334 S.C. 71, 77, 512 S.E.2d 507, 510 (1999); State v. Hill, 331 S.C. 94, 501 S.E.2d 122 (1998). \r\nHowever, the stress of the eventâ€”not the time between the event and the statementâ€”is the linchpin of the excited utterance exception.Â  See State v. Quillien, 263 S.C. 87, 97, 207 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1974).Â  â€œThere are no hard and fast rules as to when res gestae ends.â€Â  State v. Harrison, 298 S.C. 333, 336, 380 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1989), superseded by rule as stated in Hill, 331 S.C. at 99, 501 S.E.2d at 125.[1]Â  Time is one factor to consider; â€œ[o]ther factors useful in determining whether a statement qualifies as an excited utterance include the declarantâ€™s demeanor, the declarantâ€™s age, and the severity of the startling event.â€Â  Sims, 348 S.C. at 22, 558 S.E.2d at 521.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the statement must be based on firsthand information, such as statements of an actual witness to an event.Â  Hill, 331 S.C. at 99, 501 S.E.2d at 125; LaCoste, 347 S.C. at 161, 553 S.E.2d at 468.Â  Firsthand knowledge may be established by information conveyed in the statement itself.Â  Id. at 161, 553 S.E.2d at 469.Â  \r\n\r\n  3.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Application of Excited Utterance Exception to Hillâ€™s Statement\r\n\r\nHillâ€™s statement that the shotgun was used to kill Davis relates to a murder, and murder is certainly a startling event.Â  See State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 284, 523 S.E.2d 173, 177 (1999) (rejecting appellantâ€™s argument that the State failed to show a statement was an excited utterance where declarant had just seen his brother shoot an unarmed man, abruptly ending a fistfight).Â  The closer issue is whether Hill was under the stress of the startling event when he made the controverted statements.Â  \r\nConsidering the factors of severity of the stress of the event, time between the event and the utterance, and surrounding indicia of stress, we find sufficient evidence that Hill was under the stress of the murder when he made the declarations to Hicks.Â  The statements relate to a highly stressful event.Â  The time between the event and the statements was well within the time frame courts have allowed for excited utterances.Â  See, e.g., Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (allowing statements made less than one hour after event).Â  Here, Hill encountered Hicks just ten to thirty minutes after Stevens and the two unidentified individuals fled from the murder scene.Â  Furthermore, surrounding circumstances point to a conclusion that the stress of the event had not abated.Â  Both Davis and Stevens bought an unusually large amount of drugs; Davis was willing to exchange an entire bag full of coins for drugs without counting it; and Stevens gave away drugs in an unusually generous gesture.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the record strongly supports Hillâ€™s statements were based on firsthand information.Â  Hill established that â€œ[s]tatements which are not based on firsthand information, as where the declarant was not an actual witness to the event, are not admissible under the exited utterance . . . exception to the hearsay rule.â€Â  331 S.C. at 99, 501 S.E.2d at 125 (citing 23 C.J.S. Crim. Law Â§ 876 (1989)).Â  In Hill, the defendant shot a police officer in a car wash parking lot.Â  Kenneth Grant arrived at the car wash fifteen minutes after the shooting, and testified in camera that some fifteen to twenty minutes after arriving he heard an unidentifiable person in the crowd say there were two suspects.Â  The supreme court agreed with the trial court that the hearsay was inadmissible.Â  Among other reasons for the ruling, there was â€œno evidence the unidentified declarant witnessed the shooting.â€Â  Id. at 100, 501 S.E.2d at 125.Â  Subsequently, LaCoste amplified Hill by holding that firsthand knowledge of unknown declarants may be established by the declaration itself.Â  347 S.C. at 161, 553 S.E.2d at 469.Â  \r\nHere, there is sufficient evidence that Hillâ€™s declarations to Hicks were based on personal knowledge.Â  Unlike State v. Hill, the declarant in this case was known.Â  Immediately before the shooting, Steven and Davis were heard arguing with the victim.Â  Just after the shooting three individuals, one of whom was Stevens, were seen fleeing the scene.Â  Minutes later Hill appeared with Stevens and Davis.Â  We find this evidence supports the inference that Hill was one of the three individuals fleeing the scene; that he was, therefore, present at the murder scene; and that he had firsthand knowledge that the shotgun had been used to kill Williams.Â  \r\nBolstering this conclusion is a â€œjailhouse confession,â€ signed by Davis, indicating that Davis shot the victim.Â  When Davis was arrested, he was jailed and placed in a cell directly across from Hicks, who was incarcerated on an unrelated offense.Â  According to Hicks, he and Davis would communicate with each other by placing a letter in a book and sliding the book from cell to cell.Â  Hicks stated that he slid the following letter, which was admitted into evidence, to Davis:\r\n\r\n  Hey Chris the night that yaâ€™ll came and tried to sell me the shotgun was yaâ€™ll coming from Paulâ€™s house then what I need to know from you who was the trigger man and I know it wasnâ€™t Greg from what he told me that night so it had to be [illegible] you or Reggie cause you had the gun and Greg told me you and Reggie the who [sic] went in the house so who pulled the triggerÂ Â  if Reggie did it just write Reggieâ€™s name or if you did just sign your name at the bottom and I will help you out by writing that letter just write what you want me to tell them.\r\n\r\nThe letter is signed â€œChristopher Davisâ€ and dated â€œ3-15-01.â€Â  A handwriting expert testified that the signature was Davisâ€™s.Â  Hicks acknowledged that he observed Davis sign the letter, and Davis admitting signing a piece of paper for Hicks, although he contended it was blank when he signed it.Â  Davis does not appeal the trial judgeâ€™s admission of this confession.Â  Therefore, its stands on its own and was independent evidence for the juryâ€™s consideration.Â  The confession indicates that Hicks knew from Hill that either Stevens or Davis shot the victim.Â  Thus, the confession, coupled with the strong inference that Hill was present at the crime scene, constitutes sufficient evidence that Hill had personal knowledge of the contents of his declarations.Â Â  \r\nBased on the totality of the circumstance, we find the record supports (1) Hillâ€™s statement was related to a startling event; (2) it was made while Hill was under the stress of the event; (3) the stress resulted from the startling event; and (4) the statement was based on firsthand information.Â  We therefore find Hillâ€™s statement admissible under Rule 803(2), a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  \r\nII.Â  Harmless Error\r\nFinally, the State contends any error in admission of Hillâ€™s hearsay declarations would be harmless.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œA violation of the defendantâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront the witness is not per se reversible error if the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.â€Â  State v.

App. 2004) (â€œ[V]iolations of the rule announced in Crawford constitute errors in the trial process and are subject to either plain or harmless error review.â€); Bell v.

Wright, 686 N.W.2d 295 (Minn. App. 2004) (declining to rule whether a 911 call was testimonial because even if it were, admission of the call would constitute harmless error).\r\nWhether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); State v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998); State v. Thompson, 352 S.C. 552, 575 S.E.2d 77 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  No definite rule of law governs this finding.Â  State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.Â  In re Harvey, 355 S.C. at 63, 584 S.E.2d at 897; Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Where a review of the entire record establishes the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt, the conviction should not be reversed.Â  State v. Pickens, 320 S.C. 528, 466 S.E.2d 364 (1996); Thompson, 352 S.C. at 562, 575 S.E.2d at 83; State v. King, 349 S.C. 142, 561 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992).\r\nGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795; see also State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (noting that when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this Court will not set aside the conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result).Â  \r\nThe admission of improper evidence is harmless where the evidence is merely cumulative to other evidence.Â  State v. Haselden, 353 S.C. 190, 577 S.E.2d 445 (2003); State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001); State v. Blackburn, 271 S.C. 324, 247 S.E.2d 334 (1978); State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 523 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1999); see also State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996) (instructing that error in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence which was properly admitted); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) (explicating that any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to evidence is harmless).\r\nHillâ€™s statements, as related by Hicks, were (1) Davis and Stevens went into the victimâ€™s house, and (2) the shotgun that Davis was trying to sell was used to murder the victim.Â  Considering the other evidence before the jury, we harbor no reasonable doubts that any error in admitting Hillâ€™s statement would have been harmless.Â Â  \r\nForemost, Davisâ€™s confession, the admission of which is not at issue, contains the substance of Hillâ€™s statements as testified to by Hicks.Â  The confession establishes that Hicks knew â€œfrom what Greg [Hill] told me that night . . . [the trigger man] had to be . . . you or Reggie [Stevens] cause you had the gun and Greg told me you and Reggie the who [sic] went in the house . . . .â€Â  Thus, the substance of Hillâ€™s declarations were properly before the jury.Â  Consequently, Hicksâ€™s testimony as to Hillâ€™s hearsay was merely cumulative of other evidence, and its admissionâ€”even if erroneousâ€”was harmless.Â  \r\nAdditionally, two witnesses, Hicks and his brother, Raymond, heard Davis, Stevens, and the victim arguing just before the gunshot.Â  Following the gunshot, Hicks, Raymond, and a third witness, Calvin Patten, observed three individuals running from the victimâ€™s back yard.Â  Hicks and Patten both identified Stevens as one of the fleeing men, and police matched Stevensâ€™s shoeprint with one found at the crime scene.Â  \r\nBetween ten and thirty minutes after the gunshot, Hill, Stevens, and Davis were seen together.Â  According to Hicks, Davis had the shotgun, and Stevens purchased over $100 worth of crack cocaine, an unusually large purchase for Stevens.Â  Calvin Patten testified that Stevens gave him some drugs in an uncharacteristically generous gesture.Â  Lorenzo White averred that late one night Davis came to his house with the shotgun, wiped it down with Clorox to remove finger prints, and hid the gun somewhere in Whiteâ€™s house.Â  \r\nThus, excluding Hicksâ€™s testimony regarding Hillâ€™s hearsay statements, the jury heard evidence that several witnesses overheard Stevens, Davis, and Williams arguing; thereafter a gun was fired; Stevens and two other individuals were seen fleeing the crime scene; Stevensâ€™s footprint was found at the crime scene; Stevens and Hill emerged and made a large drug purchase; Stevens gave away some crack cocaine in an unusually generous gesture; minutes later, Stevens and Hill returned with Davis, who was trying to sell a shotgun; Davis took the shotgun to a friends house, where he wiped down the gun with Clorox and hid it; Hicks wrote that he knew Davis and Stevens entered the house, and that one of them shot the victim; and Davis confessed to the murder.Â  Under these facts, even were we to conclude Hillâ€™s statements were improperly admitted, they were cumulative of statements in the confession, and the other evidence against Davis was so substantial that the hearsay utterances were neither material nor prejudicial.Â  Therefore, any error in admitting the statements would be harmless.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nHillâ€™s hearsay statements to Hicks were properly admitted.Â  The utterances were nontestimonial; therefore, Crawford v. Washington does not bar the admission of these statements, even though Hill was unavailable at trial and Davis did not have a prior opportunity to cross-examine him.Â  Hillâ€™s statements were admissible under the excited utterance exception, Rule 803(2), SCRE, which is recognized as a firmly rooted hearsay exception.Â  Accordingly, the Confrontation Clause does not require that Davis have the opportunity to cross-examine Hill regarding the nontestimonial excited utterance.Â  Regardless, any error in admitting the statements would have been harmless.Â  Davisâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although Harrison, Blackburn, and Quillien predate the South Carolina Rule of Evidence, their reasoning is still efficacious.Â  Those cases were decided under the res gestae doctrine, and Rules 803(1) &amp; (2) codify res gestae.Â  See State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 43, 515 S.E.2d 525, 530 (1999); State v. Burroughs, 328 S.C. 489, 498-99, 492 S.E.2d 408, 412-14 (Ct.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Karl Wallace was convicted of second-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor.Â  He argues the trial court erred by admitting the testimony of the victimâ€™s sister regarding an alleged prior act of criminal sexual conduct with a minor under the common scheme or plan exception to State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923), and Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWallace was accused of criminal sexual conduct with his stepdaughter.Â  At the time of trial, Wallace had been married to the victimâ€™s mother for approximately ten years.Â  At trial, the victim testified she was about twelve years old when Wallace first told her to come to his room and go into the bathroom to take off all of her clothes.Â  She said he would look at her and then touch her on her chest.Â  After he touched her, he would tell her â€œdonâ€™t tell anyone â€˜cause theyâ€™re not going to believe you anyway.â€Â  When asked how many times this happened, the victim answered â€œonce, like every other month or so one time.â€Â  This pattern continued through the seventh and eighth grades.Â  \r\nAlthough the incidents allegedly continued over a number of years, this charge involved an act on May 8, 2001, when the victim was in the ninth grade.Â  According to the victim, Wallace called the victim into his bedroom to talk after her mother had been taken into police custody on an unrelated matter.Â  After asking the victim why she was sitting with her legs closed and whether she thought he was going to do something to her, Wallace pushed her back on the bed.Â  The victim stated that Wallace â€œsat on top of me and like between my legs and we were just sitting there.â€Â  Wallace asked her, â€œdo you want me to be myself or be like a dog,â€ to which she responded, â€œto be hisself [sic].â€Â  Wallace then removed her pajama bottoms and her underwear, forced open her legs, and started â€œto push his hands up [her] privates.â€Â  As he continued, the victim started to scream.Â  Wallace put a pillow over her face and told her to be quiet or he would hit her.Â  She testified that when Wallace heard her little brother coming down the hall, he told her to go into the bathroom and get dressed.Â  After her brother left the room, Wallace forced her back on the bed, got on top of her, and took her pants off again.Â  After sitting and looking at her, he told her to go get her things and leave.Â  \r\nA few days later, the victimâ€™s older sister came to the school to see the victim and to find out what was going on at home.Â  The victim told her sister that Wallace had been â€œmessing withâ€ her.Â  As a result of that conversation, someone from the Department of Social Services visited the victim at school.Â  The victim subsequently filed a police report.Â  Â \r\nAt trial, the State attempted to present evidence of an alleged sexual assault against the sister as proof of Wallaceâ€™s guilt.Â  Prior to the start of trial, the State moved to allow the testimony of the sister, proffering the following argument:\r\n\r\n  Itâ€™s the Stateâ€™s position that her testimony would be that she was also sexually abused by this defendant that [sic] the abuse started at approximately the same age with both of the victims, that being the seventh grade, roughly, for both of them, between twelve and thirteen years old; that they were both the defendantâ€™s stepdaughters; that they were both living in the home with the defendant, as opposed to visiting on weekends and the abuse happening then; that the method of the abuse essentially started the same way, it started with fondling of the breasts, is [sic] where it began; and that it would occur in the home, . . . it occurred in the bedroom; and it occurred when the mother was not home, . . . .\r\n\r\nThe State concluded by stating that the sister suffered more extensive abuse.Â  Specifically, she was subjected to sexual intercourse and oral sex.Â  The State asserted it â€œwould be willing to offer to limit testimony, if you see fit, as to just the particulars that were similar.â€Â  When questioned by the trial court, the State said the sister specifically did not want to bring charges against Wallace.Â  Defense counsel argued the testimony of the sister, as to the alleged prior bad act, did not fit any exception to Lyle and would be grossly prejudicial to Wallace.\r\nThe trial court ordered an in camera examination of the sister.Â  She testified that when she was in the sixth or seventh grade Wallace would come into her room to rub her back because he was trying to get her to lose weight.Â  He then would touch her breasts, kiss her, and perform oral sex.Â  When she was in the eighth grade, the family moved from Louisiana to South Carolina.Â  The sister testified Wallace would call her into his bedroom and perform oral sex, digital penetration, and sexual intercourse.Â  She testified she told her mother about the incidents on two separate occasions.Â  Â The sister testified the sexual assaults continued until she moved out of the family home during her second semester in college.Â  \r\nAfter hearing the testimony and arguments, the trial court found the testimony to be clear and convincing and ruled this evidence was admissible under the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  Concluding the probative value outweighed the prejudicial effect, the trial court allowed the evidence to be presented to the jury but limited the testimony of the sister â€œonly to the extent and only to the acts which occurred to the victim in this prosecution, and not to go beyond that, which will limit the prejudicial effect of this testimony coming in.â€Â  A jury found Wallace guilty of second-degree CSC with a minor, and he was sentenced to eight years confinement.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nOn review of criminal cases, an appellate court is limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion.Â  See State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001). An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the circuit court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Bryant,&nbsp;356 S.C. 485, 489-90, 589 S.E.2d 775, 777&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œConcerning the admission of evidence, the trial judgeâ€™s determination will be sustained absent error and resulting prejudice.â€Â  State v. Robinson,&nbsp;360 S.C. 187, 192, 600 S.E.2d 100, 102&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nWallace argues the trial court improperly admitted the testimony of the victimâ€™s sister as to alleged criminal sexual assaults under the common scheme or plan exception of Rule 404(b), SCRE and State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  We agree. \r\nEvidence of prior bad acts is inadmissible to prove the specific crime charged unless the evidence tends to establish (1) motive; (2) intent; (3) the absence of mistake or accident; (4) a common scheme or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other that proof of one tends to establish proof of the other; or (5) identity of the person charged with the present crime. Lyle, 125 S.C. at 416, 118 S.E. at 807; Rule 404(b), SCRE (â€œEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.â€). \r\nA prior bad act must first be established by clear and convincing evidence to be admissible. State v. Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325, 580 S.E.2d 186, 189 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  This court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial courtâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001).Â  When considering whether there is clear and convincing evidence, this court is bound by the trial courtâ€™s findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 325, 580 S.E.2d at 189; State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. 460, 468, 523 S.E.2d 787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating if a prior bad act is not the subject of a conviction, proof must be by clear and convincing evidence).Â  \r\nHere, Wallace does not argue the quantum of proof did not rise to the clear and convincing level.Â  Instead, he argues the trial judge misapprehended the nature of the common scheme or plan exception as articulated in Lyle.Â  Wallace urges us to review the underlying facts of Lyle in order to fully understand the common scheme or plan exception.Â  \r\nIn Lyle, the defendant was charged with issuing a forged check in Aiken, South Carolina on January 12, 1922.Â  125 S.C. at 411, 118 S.E. at 805.Â  The State introduced evidence that the defendant had committed similar crimes in Aiken on that same date, as well as similar crimes in Griffin, Georgia on January 3, 1922; Athens, Georgia on December 30, 1921; and LaGrange, Georgia on November 23, 1921.Â  Id. at 413-14, 118 S.E. at 806.Â  The allegation was the same in all the crimes:Â  the defendant entered the bank, opened an account with a forged check using a false name, and received cash back from his deposit.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court held that the evidence regarding the similar crime committed in Aiken on the same date as the crime charged was admissible to establish identity because the evidence helped to refute the alibi defense of the defendant.Â  Id. at 418, 118 S.E. at 808.Â  As to the similar crimes committed on other dates in other locations, however, the Supreme Court found the evidence inadmissible.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n  Whether such crime was committed as part of a common plan or system was wholly immaterial, unless proof of such system would serve to identify the defendant as the perpetrator of the particular crime charged or was necessary to establish the element of criminal intent.Â  Proof of a common plan or system, therefore, in this connection is merely an evidential means to the end of proving identity or guilty intent, and involves the establishment of such a visible connection between the extraneous crimes and the crime charged as will make evidence of one logically tend to prove the other as charged.Â  If, as we have seen, no such connection was shown to exist between the separate Georgia offenses and the Aiken crime as would constitute them practically â€œa continuous transactionâ€ or as would otherwise render this evidence relevant to prove identity, and if, as we have held, the evidence was not competent on the question of intent, it follows that it was not admissible merely to show plan or system.\r\n\r\nId. at 427, 118 S.E. at 811 (emphasis added) (citations omitted). This notion of the connection which must be established between similar crimes in order to allow admission of evidence of one of the crimes in the trial of the other had been previously articulated in two New York cases, People v. Molineux, 61 N.E. 286 (N.Y. 1901) and People v. Romano, 82 N.Y.S. 749 (N.Y. App. Div. 1903), relied on by the court in Lyle.Â  \r\nIn Molineux, the defendant was accused of murder by sending poison contained in a bottle of Bromo Seltzer[1] through the mail to the director of the Knickerbocker Athletic Club.Â  61 N.E. at 287.Â  The director, Harry Cornish, believing the silver â€œTiffanyâ€™sâ€ bottle holder containing the bottle of Bromo Seltzer to be a Christmas gift, took it to his home.Â  Thereafter, a member of his household, Katharine Adams, took some of the bottleâ€™s contents to relieve a headache and died.Â  At trial, the State sought to introduce into evidence that the defendant was responsible for the previous death of Henry Barnet, who died at the Knickerbocker Athletic Club after taking a dose of a powder he had received in the mail the month before Cornish received his bottle.Â  Id. at 289.Â  Both powders were in fact cyanide of mercury, a rare and deadly poison.Â  The evidence of the prior crime was admitted in the trial court.Â  The Court of Appeals of New York reversed, and in a very thorough-going opinion, clearly articulated the limited nature of the common scheme or plan exception to the general rule which proscribes the admission of evidence of other crimes to prove the crime charged.Â  The New York Court stated:\r\n\r\n  It sometimes happens that two or more crimes are committed by the same person in pursuance of a single design, or under circumstances which render it impossible to prove one without proving all.Â  To bring a case within this exception to the general rule which excludes proof of extraneous crimes, there must be evidence of system between the offense on trial and the one sought to be introduced.Â  They must be connected as parts of a general and composite plan or scheme, or they must be so related to each other as to show a common motive or intent running through both. \r\n\r\nId. at 299.\r\nIn Romano, the defendant was charged with robbing his victim by throwing snuff into his face.Â  82 N.Y.S. at 749.Â  At trial, the State sought to introduce evidence that the defendant had committed another robbery at the same location upon another person by using the same method.Â  Although the trial court admitted the evidence finding the two crimes remarkably similar, the appellate court reversed.Â  The New York Court of Appeals stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  There is always more or less of similarity between the commission of independent crimes of this class, and in many instances features that are common to one are found in the other; and yet it has never been supposed that, where there was separation as to time and no connection established beyond that of place and similarity, the first crime was admissible to establish any of the elements which constituted the other.\r\n\r\nId. at 750.Â  \r\nWallace argues that in admitting the sisterâ€™s testimony, the trial judge impermissibly broadened the meaning of the common scheme or plan exception enunciated in Lyle, to include mere similar acts.Â  According to Wallace, the trial judge erroneously assumed that a broader application of the exception was warranted because this case involved criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  However, the appellate courts of this state have refused to recognize a specific exception to the inadmissibility of prior bad act evidence in criminal sexual conduct cases.Â  See State v. Nelson,&nbsp;331 S.C. 1, 14 n.16, 501 S.E.2d 716, 723&nbsp;n.16 (1998) (ruling that evidence of defendant's general pedophile characteristics was inadmissible, and noting that â€œ[i]n spite of the ban on character or propensity evidence, some states have nonetheless admitted evidence of collateral sexual crimes or sexual bad acts in sex offense cases, carving out a specific exception they variously term â€˜lustful disposition,â€™ â€˜depraved sexual instinct,â€™ or the like. . . .Â  South Carolina has not recognized such an exception, nor are we inclined to do so.â€); Tutton, 354 S.C. at 328, 580 S.E.2d at 191 (finding the bar for admissibility under Lyle is not lower simply because sexual crimes are involved; there must still be â€œevidence that the defendant employed a common scheme or plan in the commission of the crimesâ€).[2]Â  \r\n In this case, the trial court did not address any connection between the two crimes to establish if the allegations by the victimâ€™s sister were admissible.Â  The court instead ruled, â€œit goes to a common scheme or plan because of the close degree of similarity between the conduct, with regards to the two victims.â€Â  When the State was asked to explain why the testimony was essential to its case, the solicitor responded:\r\n\r\n  This is technically a credibility case, thatâ€™s what it is.Â  Itâ€™s one witnessâ€™s word against potentially another witnessâ€™s word.Â  The evidence would be relevant and would be essential to the Stateâ€™s case because it is a piece of evidence, just like any other piece of evidence, that goes to prove or disprove the case.Â  And this is strictly a credibility case:Â  Therefore, this testimony is necessary to, again, prove the victimâ€™s allegations.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThis argument could be used to admit testimony of any prior crime when a defendant is accused of a subsequent but similar crime.Â  It falls far short of the threshold for the admission of a prior crime under the common scheme or plan exception to Lyle.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting the evidence on this basis.\r\nIt was also error for the trial judge to attempt to limit the testimony of the sister so that there would be a close similarity between the prior bad act and the crime charged.Â Â  The court noted that the testimony of the sister was more egregious than that of the victim and ordered the testimony redacted, stating, â€œI find it appropriate under State v. Tutton to limit the testimony of the Lyle witness only to the extent and only to the acts which occurred to the victim in this prosecution, and not to go beyond that, which will limit the prejudicial effect of this testimony coming in.â€Â  This court in Tutton concluded the differences in the evidence proffered of the prior criminal sexual conduct was sufficiently different to render it inadmissible.Â  Tutton, 354 S.C. at 333, 580 S.E.2d at 194. We did not, however, sanction the redaction of testimony in order to make similar that which is dissimilar. \r\nWallace correctly argues: â€œThe law should not permit a trial judge to make similar that which is different by redacting a part of the testimony.â€Â  This is precisely what Lyle rejected.Â  Moreover, as noted in Lyle, â€œif the court does not clearly perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt, and the evidence should be rejected.â€Â  125 S.C. at 417, 118 S.E.2d at 807.Â Â  Thus, the trial court erred in endeavoring to eliminate any differences between the sisterâ€™s account and the victimâ€™s testimony in order to make the sisterâ€™s testimony admissible.Â  See Hubner, Op. No. 3917 (Ct. App. filed Jan. 10, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 79) (concluding the trial court erred in limiting the testimony regarding prior bad acts to similar acts when the court recognized the differences between prior bad act and the act at issue but failed to balance the similarities and differences in determining whether the testimony was admissible at all).Â Â  Rather, the trial judge should have given Wallace the benefit of the doubt and excluded the evidence.Â  See Stokes, 279 S.C. at 193, 304 S.E.2d at 815 (â€œIf there is any doubt as to the connection between the acts, the evidence should not be admitted.â€); State v. Davenport, 321 S.C. 134, 138, 467 S.E.2d 258, 260&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (finding that where there was no clear connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, the accused should have been given the benefit of the doubt, and the evidence should have been rejected). \r\nIn addition to finding the admission of the sisterâ€™s testimony error, we find the admission was not harmless.Â  As in Hubner, the outcome of this case rested on the credibility of the victim and Wallace.Â  Op. No. 3917 (Ct. App. filed Jan. 10, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 92).Â  Here, the admission of the sisterâ€™s testimony enhanced the credibility of the victim and was provided as substantive prove of the victimâ€™s allegations.Â  Without the sisterâ€™s testimony, we cannot say that the evidence against Wallace was conclusively established such that a guilty verdict was the only rational result.Â  See Tutton, 354 S.C. at 334, 580 S.E.2d at 194 (stating that in conducting an harmless analysis, the appellate court must review the other evidence admitted at trial in order to determine â€œwhether the defendantâ€™s guilt is conclusively established by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion could be reached by the juryâ€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse Wallaceâ€™s conviction and remand for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Bromo Seltzer is a brand of drug used to treat stomach upset and headache.Â  See http://www.drugs.com/cons/Bromo_Seltzer.html (last visited Feb. 11, 2005).\r\n[2] Wallace argues that numerous opinions from both this court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have focused exclusively on the close degree of similarity between the crime charged and the evidence of the other crime, without mentioning the â€œsystemâ€ or relation between the two, which is the crux of the original exception.Â  See, e.g., State v. Hallman, 298 S.C. 172, 175, 379 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1989) (â€œWe find the evidence of prior bad acts bears such close similarity to the offense charged in this case that its probative value clearly outweighs its prejudicial effect.â€); State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984) (â€œSuch evidence is inadmissible â€˜unless the close similarity of the charged offense and the previous act enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule the prejudicial effect.â€™â€); State v. Patrick, 318 S.C. 352, 356 457 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œThere are sufficient similarities between the Georgia case and present case to apply the Lyle common scheme or plan exception.â€); State v. Blanton, 316 S.C. 31, 32, 446 S.E.2d 438, 439 (Ct. App. 1994) (â€œThe prior acts were sufficiently similar to the charged offense to be admissible.â€); State v. Wingo, 304 S.C. 173, 176, 403 S.E.2d 322, 324 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding the evidence of prior bad acts tended to show common plan or scheme when the experiences of each victim paralleled that of the other victims). \r\nAccording to Wallace, other decisions correctly reflect a more narrow interpretation of the common scheme or plan exception.Â  See, e.g., State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62, 533 S.E.2d 325, 328 (2000) (â€œWhen the prior bad acts are similar to the one for which the appellant is being tried, the danger of prejudice is enhanced.â€); State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 233, 433 S.E.2d 831, 832 (1993) (â€œ[T]he connection between the prior bad act and the crime must be more than just a general similarity.â€); State v. Rogers, 293 S.C. 505, 507, 362 S.E.2d 7, 8 (1987) (stating that where the acts are ten years apart and the only connection between the testimony of the two daughters was that the defendant touched them both, the prior bad act evidence should have been excluded), overruled on other grounds by State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 506 n.1, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 n.1 (1993); State v. Nix, 288 S.C. 492, 496, 343 S.E.2d 627, 629 (1986) (finding where the robbery could not have been committed without the get-away-car, the relevance of the car theft to the crimes charged was easily perceived); State v. Stokes, 279 S.C. 191, 192-93, 304 S.E.2d 814, 814-15 (1983) (concluding the trial judge erred in admitting testimony from a witness who speculated that the defendant intended to rape her because there was no connection made between that prior bad act and the act for which the defendant was charged); State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d 701, 711 (1955) (allowing testimony of another sexual act perpetrated against the same victim some hours after the original offense because the crimes were so related to each other that proof of one tended to establish the other); State v. Hubner, Op. No. 3917 (Ct. App. filed Jan. 10, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 89) (stating that the similarity between separate acts must not merely be a similarity in the results; â€œ[r]ather, there must be such a concurrence of common features that the various acts are normally to be explained as caused by a general plan of which they are the individual manifestationsâ€); State v. Carter, 323 S.C. 465, 468, 476 S.E.2d 916, 918 (Ct. App. 1996) (reversing defendantâ€™s conviction where there was no legal connection between the prior bad act and the crime charged); State v. Campbell, 317 S.C. 449, 451, 454 S.E.2d 899, 901 (Ct. App. 1994) (finding absent a connection between the two acts, the testimony of prior drug sales utilizing a similar sales technique precisely the type of evidence Lyle prohibits).\r\nWallace is correct that some of the appellate decisions appear to focus exclusively on the alleged close similarity between the other crime and the crime charged, while others look beyond mere close similarity to consider the system or connection between the two.Â  Nevertheless, sorting out any apparent inconsistencies in the appellate decisions of this state is not the province of this court.Â  See M &amp; T Chems., Inc. v. Barker Indus., Inc., 296 S.C. 103, 109, 370 S.E.2d 886, 890&nbsp;(Ct.

Peoples, sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of employment and awarding him compensation for sixty-eight percent permanent partial disability to his right lower extremity.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nPeoples, a forty-three year old man with a high school education, worked for Henry Company for twenty-three years.Â  An accident at work in 1999 resulted in a rupture of his Achilles tendon.Â  He underwent two surgeries and a third one was recommended.Â  Peoples elected not to have the third surgery because the chances of improvement did not appear to be good, and he would likely face a fusion of his ankle bones.Â  \r\nAfter the surgeries, Peoples returned to work at the same job but endured constant pain.Â  On a scale of one to ten, his pain level was at a six in the morning and at a seven when he returned home at the end of the day.Â  He takes medication, but his leg remains swollen and painful.Â  He now has difficulty walking and standing for long periods of time.Â  Peoples stated that he is unable to participate in sports, cannot lift heavy objects, and climbs stairs with difficulty.Â  Additionally, his ability to rotate his ankle is impaired and his lateral movement has been reduced by seventy percent.Â  \r\nThe pain in Peoplesâ€™ right leg generally radiates to just below the knee.Â  He has a scar on the back of his leg about eight inches long running from his heel toward his knee.Â  He must wear protective shoes to work every day.Â  Peoples further testified that he has pain from his heel to his lower back from time to time, and that he takes Ultracet to control the pain.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner held that Peoples had undergone a sixty-eight percent permanent partial disability to his right lower extremity and awarded benefits accordingly.Â  The commissioner also ordered Henry Company to provide orthopedic footwear for life and to continue to provide Peoples with Ultracet or some equivalent medication for the pain.Â  \r\nHenry Company appealed to the full commission.Â  The commission affirmed, except that it reduced the level of disability to forty percent.Â  \r\nBoth parties appealed to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court found that the decision of the full commission to reduce the level of disability to forty percent was without evidentiary support.Â  The circuit court therefore reinstated the award of sixty-eight percent disability by the single commissioner.Â  Henry Company argued on appeal that Peoplesâ€™ injury was to his foot only, not his leg.Â  Finding the Achilles tendon to be a part of the leg, the circuit court affirmed the remainder of the commissionâ€™s order.Â  \r\nHenry Company has appealed, arguing the circuit court erred in (1) sustaining the finding of partial disability to his leg instead of only his foot, and (2) finding that Peoples needed Ultracet to control the pain.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nJudicial review of a decision of an administrative agency is governed by the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-23-310 to -400 (Supp. 2004).Â  Section 1-23-380(A)(6) establishes the substantial evidence rule as the standard of review.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  Under this standard, a reviewing court may reverse or modify an agency decision based on errors of law, but may only reverse or modify an agencyâ€™s findings of fact if they are clearly erroneous.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)(6)(d) and (e).Â  \r\nAccordingly, a reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  Stephens v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Instead, review of issues of fact is limited to determining whether the findings are supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 289, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610-11 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œOn appeal, this court must affirm an award of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission in which the circuit court concurred if substantial evidence supports its findings.â€Â  Solomon v. W.B. Easton, Inc., 307 S.C. 518, 520, 415 S.E.2d 841, 843 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nHenry Company first argues the circuit court erred in affirming the commissionâ€™s award for disability to Peoplesâ€™ right leg instead of only his right foot.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œWorkersâ€™ compensation statutes are to be construed in favor of coverage. . . .â€Â  Lester v. S.C. Workersâ€™ Comp. Commâ€™n, 334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752 (1999). Â Any reasonable doubts as to construction should be resolved in favor of coverage.Â  Id. at 561, 514 S.E.2d at 753. \r\nSection 42-9-30 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) provides the schedule for compensation for various injuries under this stateâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation system.Â  Subsection (14) provides that for the loss of a foot a worker is to receive 66 2/3% of the average weekly wages during 140 weeks.Â  Subsection (15) provides that the compensation for the loss of a leg is 66 2/3% of the average weekly wages during 195 weeks.Â  In cases involving partial schedule member losses, the amount of the award is proportionate to the percentage of loss of use of the member.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (18) (1976).\r\nHenry Company cites Dunmore v. Brooks Veneer Co., 248 S.C. 326, 149 S.E.2d 766 (1966), for the proposition that an injury to the lower extremity below the knee not causing damage to the knee, thigh, or hip joint is considered an injury to the foot and not the leg.Â  In Dunmore, the workerâ€™s foot was crushed, necessitating amputation.Â  Id. at 331, 149 S.E.2d at 768.Â  His physician determined that the optimum site to make the amputation was approximately five to seven inches below the knee.Â  The reason for this was that a stump of that length would heal more quickly and provide sufficient leverage for walking.Â  Such procedures are called â€œsite of electionâ€ amputations.Â  Id.Â  The court held that since a portion of the leg was amputated to assist the worker in accommodating for the loss of the foot, the injury would be considered a total loss of the foot only, and not a total or partial loss of the leg.Â  Id. at 331-33, 149 S.E.2d at 768-69.Â  \r\nHowever, this case neither involves a site of election amputation nor a total loss of a body part.[1]Â  The injury in the present case, rather, is similar to the injury in Durant v. Ancor Corp., 209 S.C. 509, 41 S.E.2d 96 (1947).Â  In Durant, the worker was injured when acid splashed on his right leg just above the ankle.Â  The commissioner awarded the worker compensation for seventy-five percent loss of use of his right leg.Â  The South Carolina Supreme Court reversed, finding the only reasonable inference from the testimony is that the worker suffered, at most, a disability of the foot and not the leg.Â  The court noted that the worker testified that his â€œleg pained him and was stiff in the morning,â€ but discounted this testimony in light of his testimony as a whole that his loss of use was in his ankle joint or instep.Â  Id. at 510-11, 41 S.E.2d at 96.\r\nIn the present case, contrary to the evidence presented in Durant, there is ample testimony that Peoples suffered a disability to his leg, not just his foot.Â Â Â  Peoples testified that during a typical workday, â€œthere is a lot of pain in [his] leg,â€ and that the pain is â€œnot in [his] foot, itâ€™s in [his] leg.â€Â  Peoples stated that the pain sometimes runs all the way up to the small of his back, but at the time of the hearing, it was confined to his lower leg, â€œright to the back of [his] knee joint.â€Â  The commissioner noted during the hearing that â€œit appears that the right lower leg particularly at the side of the ankle and extending above is about 30 percent larger than the left.â€Â  The commissioner further stated that â€œthere is a scar approximately eight inches in length, approximately a half inch in width that runs from the heel all the way up towards the knee joint and the right lower leg is â€“ from the back, looks significantly more swollen than the â€“ significantly larger and swollen as compared to the left.â€Â  The commissionerâ€™s order found that Peoples walks with a limp, and this is supported by the medical records.Â  The circuit court noted that the Achilles tendon is defined in Taberâ€™s Medical Dictionary as being a part of the leg.Â  \r\nAdditionally, while Dr. Davis found Peoples had reached maximum medical improvement on February 2, 2002 and found his permanent impairment rating to be thirty-five percent to the foot, Dr. Seastrunkâ€™s independent medical evaluation found a sixty-two percent impairment rating to Peoplesâ€™ right lower extremity.Â  Peoplesâ€™ own testimony was that he felt he had lost seventy percent of the use of his leg.Â  In fact, the medical records are replete with references to a leg injury.Â  Therefore, we find no error and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order as to the award for permanent disability to the leg, not just the foot.[2] \r\nHenry Company next argues that the circuit court erred in finding that Peoples needed Ultracet to control his pain and lessen his disability.Â  We find this issue not properly preserved for appeal. \r\nThe record contains no indication that Henry Company appealed from the single commissionerâ€™s finding that Peoples needed Ultracet to control his pain. At the full commission hearing, Peoples testified that he was taking Ultracet for pain, as prescribed by his physician.Â  This testimony went unchallenged.Â  The full commission concurred with the single commissioner and found that the Ultracet would tend to lessen Peoplesâ€™ disability.Â  When the case was heard before the circuit court, Henry Company did not take issue with the full commissionâ€™s finding that Peoples needed Ultracet to control his pain.[3]Â  The circuit court affirmed this portion of the award.Â  Therefore, we decline to address this argument on appeal.Â  See, e.g., Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 102, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. App. 2004) (â€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review.â€).Â  \r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Based on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is hereby \r\n  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Similarly, the other cases relied upon by Henry Company, Burns v. Joyner, 264 S.C. 207, 213 S.E.2d 734 (1975) and Jewel v. R. B. Pond Co., 198 S.C. 86, 15 S.E.2d 684 (1941), also involve amputation injuries and compensation for the total loss of a body part.Â  Moreover, neither of those cases addressed the question as to whether the claimant was entitled to recover for a loss of foot or loss of leg.Â Â Â  \r\n[2] Courts in other jurisdictions have held that injuries to the ankle involve the leg and not just the foot.Â  See, e.g., Insulated Panel Co. v. Indus. Commâ€™n, 743 N.E.2d 1038, 1043 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001) (â€œ[I]njury to the bones and ligaments of the ankle may be compensable as a percentage loss of the leg.â€); LaBrecque v. Fla. Vocational Rehab. &amp; Div. of Risk Mgmt., 380 So.2d 482, 483 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1980) (stating that an ankle injury could be either a leg injury or a foot injury and the interpretation most favorable to the claimant should be adopted). \r\n[3] The written briefs submitted to the circuit court by Henry Company do not appear in the record on appeal.Â  Henry Company bears the burden of providing the court with a record sufficient to allow for appellate review.Â  Hundley v. Rite Aid of S.C., Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 306-07, 529 S.E.2d 45, 57 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
