Kelly, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJames B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, and Samuel F. Albergotti, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Douglas Menne brought this declaratory judgment action against the Keowee Key Property Ownersâ€™ Association, Inc. seeking a determination regarding the validity of a restrictive covenant that prevents him from building an individual boat dock on his lakefront property.Â  The master in equity ruled the covenant was valid and enforceable.Â  Menne appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nKeowee Key is a gated residential community on Lake Keowee.Â  The community is divided into units, with each unit further divided into multiple lots.Â  Keowee Key, a large area comprised of over 2,200 lots, covers approximately 1,600 acres.Â  Each unit contains its own distinct set of restrictive covenants that apply only to the lots within that unit.Â  \r\nIn 1985, Menneâ€™s mother purchased from the Lake Keowee Development Corporation Lot 24, a lakefront tract within Unit 20 of Keowee Key.Â  Unit 20 abuts the largest cove at Lake Keowee, informally called the Leisure Trail Cove (the â€œCoveâ€).Â Â Â  \r\nMenneâ€™s mother purchased the property subject to a restrictive covenant that the developer recorded in Oconee County on April 19, 1985.Â  The covenant prohibits construction of individual boat docks in Unit 20 and provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\nNo docks or other structures of a permanent or temporary nature shall be placed in or upon the waters or the shoreline of Lake Keowee by any individuals, partnership or corporation other than Lake Keowee Development Corporation, its successors or assigns.Â  \r\n\r\nThe developer created the Leisure Trail, a walking path along the edge of the Cove at Lake Keowee, for the enjoyment of all Unit 20 property owners, including the owners of interior lots.Â  The developer believed the natural aesthetics of the Leisure Trail would be better preserved by a few community boat docks, or â€œcluster docks,â€ rather than numerous individual boat docks.Â  The covenant maintains this appearance by preventing the construction of individual boat docks.Â  In lieu of individual docks, however, Unit 20 property owners can lease boat slips from a nearby community boat dock, the Gazebo Dock.Â  \r\nAt the time Menneâ€™s mother purchased Lot 24 in 1985, the Cove contained community docks in two locations, one consisting of 58 slips (the â€œMain Dockâ€) and another consisting of the 18-slip Gazebo Dock, for a total of 76 slips.Â  At one end of the Cove is Unit 21, which, like Unit 20, borders the Cove.Â  At the other end of the Cove formerly stood the Yacht Club.Â  It housed a restaurant and meeting area.Â  The Leisure Trail started near the Yacht Club, traversed Unit 20, and ended within Unit 21.[1]Â  From the time she bought the property, Menneâ€™s mother rented a boat slip at the Gazebo Dock.Â  \r\nIn 2000, Menne took over ownership of Lot 24 from his mother subject to the covenant.[2]Â  Menne admittedly knew when he acquired the property that the covenant prohibited Lot 24 from having an individual dock.Â  He had accompanied his mother when she purchased the property in 1985.Â  Menne also knew the covenant applied only to Unit 20 and did not apply to the other units in the Cove.Â  \r\nIn 2001, Menne contacted the Keowee Key Property Ownersâ€™ Association[3] and requested permission to build an individual boat dock on Lot 24 so he could house his three watercraft on the lake.Â  Menne explained that, although he continued to lease one boat slip at the Gazebo Dock (as his mother had done), he wished to dock more boats at Lake Keowee because, in addition to his pontoon boat, he now owned a ski boat and jet ski used by his children.Â  Menne complained about having to remove his watercraft from the lake on a daily basis.Â  He said it cut into the amount of â€œwater timeâ€ that he had on the lake.Â  He viewed the Unit 20 restriction as â€œneither fair, logical or legal.â€Â  \r\nThe Association rejected Menneâ€™s request based on the restrictive covenant in Unit 20.Â  The Association noted no private docks existed in the restricted area and it was in the process of constructing additional community boat slips.[4]Â  \r\nMenne subsequently enlisted the help of an Ohio attorney to negotiate with the Association about building an individual dock on Lot 24.Â  Menne met with the Associationâ€™s general manager, David Coe, but the Association maintained its position that the Unit 20 covenant prevented Menne from constructing an individual boat dock on Lot 24.Â  \r\nMenne thereafter filed this declaratory judgment action seeking a determination that the Unit-20 covenant could no longer be enforced because of a change of conditions in the area.Â  The master in equity reviewed the pleadings, stipulations, testimony, and exhibits, and walked the Leisure Trail with the consent of all parties, and concluded no radical change of conditions had occurred that would support an invalidation of the Unit 20 restrictive covenant regarding the construction of private docks.Â  The master noted the Leisure Trail had retained its aesthetic appeal despite the addition of a few community docks in the Cove.Â  Finally, the master ordered Menne to pay attorney fees and costs of $56,273.25 to the Association.Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Change of Conditions\r\nMenne contends the master erred in failing to invalidate the restrictive covenant based on a change of conditions.Â  \r\nUnder South Carolina law, a party may bring a declaratory judgment action to invalidate a restrictive covenant based on a change of conditions.[5]Â Â Â  The party bringing the action bears the burden of proof by the preponderance of the evidence.[6]Â  \r\nIn an action for a declaratory judgment, â€œaffirmative relief may be granted against a restrictive covenant where there is such a change in the character of the neighborhood as to render the enforcement of the covenant valueless to the covenantee and oppressive and unreasonable as to the covenantor.â€[7]Â  A party seeking to annul a restrictive covenant must show the change of conditions represented so radical a change that the original purpose of the restrictive covenant can no longer be realized.[8]Â  Even if, however, a change of conditions has occurred and inflicts a hardship upon the servient estate, equity will enforce a restrictive covenant if it â€œremain[s] of substantial value.â€[9]Â  \r\nSince Menneâ€™s mother purchased Lot 24 in 1985, the Cove has changed.Â  When she purchased Lot 24, the Cove contained 76 community boat slipsâ€”18 slips at the Gazebo Deck and 58 slips at the Main Dock.Â  In 1992, the Association built a 24-slip cluster dock off the Leisure Trail, increasing the total number of boat slips to 100.Â  Like the Gazebo Dock, this cluster dock accommodates property owners who could not build individual docks on the lake because they purchased property along the Leisure Trail.Â  This particular cluster dock was built for Unit 21 property owners.Â  In 1996, the Association added 12 slips to the Main Dock, increasing the total number of slips in the Cove to 112.Â  In 2001, the Association built a 20-slip cluster dock off the Leisure Trail called the Tall Ships Dock.Â  These additional slips, combined with the 2-slip Fordco Dock that had been in the Cove for an indeterminate number of years, brought the total number of slips near the Leisure Trail in the Cove to 134 overall.Â  \r\nThe Association also has plans for future development.Â  It has submitted an application to Duke Energy Corp. to build another cluster dock comprised of 14 slips next to the Main Dock at the beginning of the Leisure Trail.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Yacht Club was razed and replaced with a town house development called Sunrise Pointe between 2001 and 2003.Â  The developer of Sunrise Pointe built an 8-slip cluster dock and has already submitted a proposal to increase the dock to 12 slips.Â  Sunrise Pointe is not located on the Leisure Trail and is not governed by the Association, but it is within the Cove.Â  The old 2-slip Fordco Dock near the Sunrise Pointe property is slated to be removed, however.Â  \r\nThe purpose of the Unit 20 covenant is to preserve the aesthetics of the Leisure Trail that runs along the Cove and crosses Unit 20.Â  The developer believed prohibiting individual docks along the Unit 20 shoreline would best preserve the Leisure Trail.Â  By building community docks, the Leisure Trail would remain open along the Unit 20 shoreline and Unit 20 property owners would still have access to the lake.Â  To this end, the original purpose of the Unit 20 covenant can and continues to be realized.\r\nAs of this date, the Leisure Trail enjoys an open shoreline within Unit 20.Â  No individual boat docks have been added to the Unit 20 shoreline and there have been no violations of the covenant since it was recorded.Â  Although community docks have been built elsewhere in the Cove, no community docks have been added to the Unit 20 shoreline since Menneâ€™s mother purchased Lot 24.Â  Consequently, there has been little change to the aesthetics of the Leisure Trail within Unit 20, let alone a radical change warranting the invalidation of the Unit 20 covenant at issue here.Â  \r\nMoreover, the Associationâ€™s enforcement of the Unit 20 covenant is not oppressive to Menne.Â  Because Menne currently leases two boat slips from the Association at the Gazebo Dock, two of his three watercraft are already housed on the lake.Â  Thus, even if there was a radical change of conditions within Unit 20, we do not believe the fact that Menne cannot house additional boats or other watercraft on the lake places such an exorbitant burden on him that the Unit 20 covenant should be invalidated.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Evidence of Changes Outside the Restricted Area\r\nMenne argues the master erred in failing to consider evidence of changed circumstances outside the restricted area.Â  \r\nTo invalidate restrictive covenants based on a change of conditions, the changed conditions must occur within the restricted area, i.e., within the area where the covenants apply.[10]Â  In Flinkingshelt v. Johnson,[11] our supreme court explained the relevant area must end somewhere and different conditions naturally will exist outside the restricted zone:\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that any restricted area, whether it be residential or industrial, must have a demarcation line; it must end somewhere.Â  Where the restricted area ends, other unrestricted development will or may foreseeably occur.Â  To hold that commercial development in an unrestricted area adjoining a restricted area would allow the lifting of the residential restrictions as to property adjoining or in the vicinity of the unrestricted area, would be to expose all restrictions to eventual invalidation.Â  It would remove the sanctity of long standing, long respected contractual agreements and place them at the whim of parties not privy to the agreements.[12]\r\n\r\nHere, Unit 20 is considered the restricted area because the covenant at issue applies only to the lots within Unit 20 and prohibits those lot owners from building individual boat docks on their property.Â  The alleged change of conditions in the other units of the Cove is irrelevant to the determination of whether the Unit 20 covenant should be invalidated because of changed conditions.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Alleged Ambiguity of the Restrictive Covenant\r\nMenne asserts the master erred in concluding the language of the restrictive covenant is clear and unambiguous.Â  \r\nâ€œ[W]here the language imposing restrictions upon the use of property is unambiguous, the restrictions will be enforced according to their obvious meaning.â€[13]Â  \r\n\r\nThe Unit 20 restrictive covenant provides as follows:\r\n  \r\nNo docks or other structures of a permanent or temporary nature shall be placed in or upon the waters or the shoreline of Lake Keowee by any individuals, partnership or corporation other than Lake Keowee Development Corporation, its successors or assigns.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe Association is the successor of the Lake Keowee Development Corporation.Â  Thus, the Association can build docks on Lake Keowee, while individual Unit 20 property owners, such as Menne, cannot.Â  We conclude the language is clear and unambiguous.Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Weight of the Testimony\r\nMenne next contends the master erred in giving the testimony of his witness, real estate appraiser Luke Fields, less weight than the testimony of the Associationâ€™s witness, local realtor Dan Suddeth, regarding the value of Menneâ€™s lakefront property with and without a dock.Â  \r\nâ€œThe credibility of testimony is a matter for the finder of fact to judge.â€[14]Â  â€œBecause the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of the witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial court findings where matters of credibility are involved.â€[15]Â  Nothing in the record persuades us to overturn the masterâ€™s view of the evidence.Â  \r\nMoreover, we find no error in the masterâ€™s determination that, even if Menneâ€™s lot would be worth more with an individual dock, this would not justify the invalidation of the restrictive covenant where there is no radical change in the restricted area and the covenant still retains substantial value to the residential community.Â  \r\nV.Â  Complaints by Other Residents\r\nMenne argues the master erred in excluding evidence of other residentsâ€™ complaints about the addition of more community docks within the Cove.Â  \r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial court, whose ruling will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.[16]Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support.â€[17]Â  â€œTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice . . . .â€[18]Â  \r\nMenne offered several letters from Unit 21 property owners who objected to the addition of boat slips to the Unit 21 community dock, a dock that lies outside the restricted area.Â  Menne argued the letters showed the Association had notice of changed conditions due to continued expansion within the Cove.Â  The master excluded the letters as hearsay and irrelevant.Â  We find no abuse of discretion in this instance.Â  The only pertinent evidence of changed conditions is of those changes occurring within the restricted area, i.e., Unit 20.\r\nVI.Â Â Â  Motion to Amend the Pleadings\r\nMenne asserts the master erred in denying his motion to amend his pleadings to include causes of action for misrepresentation and\r\nestoppel.&nbsp; \r\nThe master denied Menneâ€™s motion under Rule 15(b), SCRCP to amend his pleadings to conform to the evidence, finding the evidence had not established either cause of action.Â  Menne argued the Association had represented Keowee Key as being a complete community that was already developed.Â  He further argued the covenant prohibited the addition of any docks, even by the Association.Â  Menneâ€™s interpretation of the covenant is clearly not supported by the evidence.Â  Moreover, because Menne admitted the Association never told him that additional community docks would not be built within Unit 20 or elsewhere in the Cove, there is no evidence establishing either misrepresentation or equitable estoppel.[19]Â Â Â  \r\nVII.Â  Attorney Fees\r\nMenne lastly argues the master erred in ordering him to pay $56,273.25 in attorney fees and costs to the Association.Â  \r\nAs a general rule, a party may not recover attorney fees absent a contract or statute.[20]Â  â€œWhen there is a contract, the award of attorney[] fees is left to the discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed unless an abuse of discretion is shown.â€[21]Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œThere are six factors to consider in determining an award of attorney[] fees:Â  1) nature, extent, and difficulty of the legal services rendered; 2) time and labor devoted to the case; 3) professional standing of counsel; 4) contingency of compensation; 5) fee customarily charged in the locality for similar services; and 6) beneficial results obtained.â€[22]Â  An award of attorney fees will be affirmed on appeal if there is sufficient evidentiary support in the record for each factor.[23]Â  \r\nIn this case, the â€œAmended and Restated Declaration of Protective Covenants of Keowee Keyâ€[24] authorize the Association to recover attorney fees in the event it is successful in the defense of the provisions of the Declaration.[25]Â  The master thoroughly examined the factors that determine an award of attorney fees and concluded the evidence supported an award of $56,273.25 to the Association.Â  The record fully supports the masterâ€™s findings.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Unit 21, which was undeveloped in 1985, has restrictive covenants that are similar, but not identical, to the Unit 20 restriction.Â  Unit 21 borders and shares the Leisure Trail with Unit 20.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Menneâ€™s mother originally held title individually and later transferred title to the property to her revocable trust.Â  Menne holds title as trustee for his revocable trust.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The Association is the successor to Realtec, Inc., the parent corporation of the Lake Keowee Development Corporation, which had originally deeded Lot 24 to Menneâ€™s mother.Â  \r\n[4]Â  Menne now leases two community boat slips from the Association, both of which are located at the Gazebo Dock near Menneâ€™s lot.Â  \r\n[5]Â  Flinkingshelt v.

Simmons, No. 92-UP-104 (Ct. App. May 28, 1992).[2]Â  Husband attained the age of 62 in 1994 and the age of 65 in 1997.Â  In December 2003, because Husband had failed to remit any portion of his Social Security benefits as required by the agreement, Wife filed a petition for a rule to show cause, requesting Husband account to her for the accrued Social Security benefits due her.Â  Husband then filed a Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, motion requesting relief from judgment, asserting the family court lacked subject-matter jurisdiction to divide his Social Security benefits.Â  The family court denied Husbandâ€™s motion.[3]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OFÂ  review\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require us to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 477, 279 S.E.2d 616, 617 (1981).Â  We are mindful that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 91, 561 S.E.2d 610, 613 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Nevertheless, we are not constrained by the family courtâ€™s conclusions as to questions of law. Â See Moriarity v. Garden Sanctuary Church, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534 S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000); See also McDuffie v. McDuffie, 308 S.C. 401, 410, 418 S.E.2d 331, 333 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nLaw/ Analysis\r\nHusband asserts the family court erred in denying his motion for relief from judgment because the Social Security Act (the Act) provides Social Security benefits â€œshall not be transferable or assignable.â€ 42 U.S.C. Â§ 407(a) (1998).Â  Further, Husband claims the property settlement agreement approved in the divorce decree amounts to an assignment of future Social Security benefits and thus, is violative of the Act. Therefore, he argues the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to divide his Social Security benefits.Â  We reluctantly agree. \r\nAs a preliminary matter, â€œSubject matter jurisdiction refers to the courtâ€™s â€˜power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€™â€ Watson v. Watson, 319 S.C. 92, 93, 460 S.E.2d 394, 395 (1995) (quoting Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994)). Â Section 20-7- 420(2) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) grants the family court the exclusive jurisdiction â€œ[t]o hear and determine actions: [f]or divorce a vinculo matrimonii . . . and in other marital litigation between the parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property of the marriage.â€ (emphasis added); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003) (stating the family court does not have jurisdiction to apportion nonmarital property).\r\nUnder Rule 60 (b)(4), SCRCP, a court may set aside a judgment more than one year after its rendition if it is void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. Thomas &amp; Howard Co. v. T.W. Graham &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995); McDaniel v. U.S. Fidelity Guar. Co., 324 S.C. 639, 644, 478 S.E.2d 868, 871 (Ct. App. 1996). Although, Rule 60(b) requires the motion be made within a reasonable time after the entry of the judgment, wife has not claimed Husbandâ€™s motion was untimely.\r\nUnder the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution, Article VI, South Carolina law must defer to the Actâ€™s statutory scheme for allocating benefits.Â  See Hisquierdo v. Hisquierdo, 439 U.S. 572, 582 (1979) (ruling states must defer to the federal statutory scheme for allocating Railroad Retirement Act benefits insofar as terms of federal law require).Â  The Act provides a comprehensive scheme as to how Social Security benefits are to be awarded to divorced spouses.Â  Cruise v. Cruise, 374 S.E.2d 882, 883 (N.C. Ct. App. 1989) (finding the trial courtâ€™s order requiring husband to share one-half of his benefits with wife contradicted the Supreme Courtâ€™s rationale in Hisquierdo).Â  \r\nThe Act also provides: \r\n\r\nThe right of any person to any future payment under this subchapter shall not be transferable or assignable, at law or in equity, and none of the monies paid or payable or rights existing under this subchapter shall be subject to execution, levy, attachment, garnishment, or other legal process, or to the operation of any bankruptcy or insolvency law.Â  \r\n\r\n42 U.S.C. Â§ 407(a).Â  The Act further declares that â€œ[n]o other provision of law . . . may be construed to limit, supersede, or otherwise modify the provisions of this section except to the extent that it does so by express reference to this section.â€Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 407(b).Â  While Â§ 659 of the Act permits reassignment of Social Security benefits to fulfill alimony obligations, it expressly excludes from the definition of alimony â€œany payment or transfer of property by an individual to the spouse or a former spouse of the individual in compliance with any community property settlement, equitable distribution of property, or other division of property between spouses or former spouses.â€ 42 U.S.C. Â§ 659(i)(3)(B)(ii). Â See Gentry v. Gentry, 938 S.W. 2d 231 (Ark. 1997) (discussing this provision).\r\nSouth Carolina courts have not directly considered whether family courts may divide Social Security benefits in property distributions.Â  However, the United States Supreme Court found Â§ 407(a) imposed a â€œbroad bar against the use of legal process to reach all Social Security benefits.â€Â  Philpott v. Essex County Welfare Bd., 409 U.S. 413, 417 (1973). Â Â Â Â Furthermore, other jurisdictions have consistently held the Act preempts state courts from treating Social Security benefits as property.Â  See Gentry, 938 S.W.2d at 232; Johnson v. Johnson, 726 So. 2d 393, 394-95 (Fla. Ct. App. 1999); In re Marriage of Boyer, 538 N.W.2d 293, 295 (Iowa 1995); Sherry v. Sherry, 701 P.2d 265, 270 (Idaho Ct. App. 1985) (citing Flemming v. Nester, 363 U.S. 603 (1960)); Cruise, 374 S.E.2d at 884; Kluck v. Kluck, 561 N.W.2d 263, 270 (N.D. 1997); Kirk v. Kirk, 577 A.2d 976, 980 (R.I. 1990); In re the Marriage of Zahm, 978 P.2d 498, 501 (Wash. 1999).Â  The thrust of these decisions is that state courts are without power to take any action to enforce a private agreement dividing future payments of Social Security when such an agreement violates the statutory prohibition against transfer or assignment of future benefits.Â  \r\nClearly, the import of the Actâ€™s antiassignment clause is to make social security nonmarital in property divisions. Kluck, 561 N.W.2d at 270. Â Because the Act preempts state law, the family court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to divide Husbandâ€™s Social Security benefits in a property distribution. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5) (â€œ[t]he court does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital property.â€). Inasmuch as the family court did not have subject matter jurisdiction over Husbandâ€™s Social Security benefits, it could not approve the settlement agreement dividing such benefits. Â See Boulter v. Boulter, 930 P.2d 112 (Nev. 1997) (holding an agreement incorporated into a divorce decree purporting to require husband to pay one-half of his Social Security benefits to his former wife was invalid and neither the Nevada Supreme Court, nor the trial court could order its enforcement.); Gentry, 938 S.W.2d at 232 (finding agreement to divide social security benefits â€œamounts to a transfer or assignment of future benefits prohibited by Section 407 and therefore was invalid and unenforceable when signedâ€). It is axiomatic that an order entered by a court without subject matter jurisdiction is utterly void. Â Coon v. Coon, 356 S.C. 342, 347, 588 S.E.2d 624, 627 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d as modified, 364 S.C. 563, 614 S.E.2d 616 (2005). Â Moreover, a lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time. Â Hallums v. Bowens, 318 S.C. 1, 3, 428 S.E.2d 894, 895 (Ct. App. 1993). Â Additionally, a court lacking subject-matter jurisdiction cannot enforce its own decrees. Â Id.\r\nIn her petition for rehearing, Wife argues the holding in Coon is in conflict with our holding in this case. We disagree. Â In Coon, our supreme court held that the Uniformed Services Former Spousesâ€™ Protection Act (USFSPA), 10 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1408 (1998) â€œexpresses no intention on Congressâ€™s part to pre-empt state court jurisdiction,â€ and that the extent of the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction over military retirement benefits is a matter of South Carolina law. 364 S.C. at 568, 614 S.E.2d at 618. Â Unlike USFSPA, Congress has in the Social Security Act expressed its intent to pre-empt state court jurisdiction regarding Social Security benefits. \r\nIn Hisquierdo, the United States Supreme Court held that the Supremacy Clause precluded Californiaâ€™s community property laws from overcoming the Federal Railroad Retirement Act. Â 439 U. S. at 582.Â  The court equated railroad retirement benefits to Social Security benefits and concluded federal railroad retirement benefits were not subject to distribution in divorce. Â Id. Â Likewise, in Philpott, the United States Supreme Court held that the provisions of Â§ 407 barring the use of â€œany legal processâ€Â  to reachÂ  social security benefits bars all claims, to include a claim of the state of New Jersey. Â 409 U.S. at 417.Â  \r\nIn her petition for rehearing, Wife also argues Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 480 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 1996) is identical to the case sub judice. We believe the cases are distinguishable. We note that Price concerned the division of military retirement benefits, which are not expressly exempt by statute from being classified as marital property for equitable division purposes. Â On the other hand, Social Security benefits are expressly excluded under Â§Â§ 407 and 659 of the Act from being classified as marital property.\r\nFinally, Wife argues, and as the family court found, that Â§ 407 was not implicated by the facts of this case because the case sub judice does not involve the transfer or assignment of Social Security benefits.Â  The family court reasoned that â€œonce [Husband] received his benefits, he is free to dispose of such funds as he deems fitâ€ without the intervention of the Social Security Administration. Â This argument is without merit.Â  Clearly, the divorce decree itself purports to divide Husbandâ€™s Social Security benefits pursuant to the agreement of the parties.Â  Moreover, the fact that Husband voluntarily agreed to pay Wife part of his Social Security benefits is of no significance. See Gentry, 938 S.W.2d at 233 (finding a property settlement agreement, which awarded wife one-half of her husbandâ€™s future Social Security benefits as he received them, was unenforceable although voluntarily entered); Boulter, 930 P.2d at 114 (holding the Actâ€™s prohibition against transferring future benefits preempted state action approving an agreement between a husband and wife to split their future Social Security benefits equally); See also Ellender v. Schweiker, 575 F.Supp. 59 (S.D.N.Y. 1983) (Congressâ€™s clear interpretation of prohibition against transfer or assignment of benefits compels strict interpretation of that clause to prohibit voluntary, as well as involuntary transfers or assignments).[4] Â By analogy our supreme court, in discussing the limitation on military retirement benefits under Â§ 1408(e)(1), stated the â€œlimitation applies whether the non-military spouse receives payments directly from the Department of Defense, from the service member spouse, or a combination of the two.â€ Â Coon, 364 S.C. at 567, 614 S.E.2d at 617.\r\n CONCLUSION\r\nAlthough we are sympathetic to Wifeâ€™s claim, Social Security benefits simply cannot be divided in an equitable distribution award. Â Because Congress preempted the Social Security arena, state courts do not have subject-matter jurisdiction to mandate distribution of such benefits whether by agreement or otherwise.Â  Therefore, the family courtâ€™s denial of Husbandâ€™s Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, motion is hereby\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF AND WILLIAMS, JJ., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2] In that appeal, Husband did not raise the issue of subject-matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\n[3] The family court order indicated it denied a motion to compel by Wife, but the record on appeal does not indicate the pertinence of the motion. \r\n[4] A 2003 amendment to 38 U.S.C. Â§ 5301 dealing with veteransâ€™ benefits states: â€œThis paragraph is intended to clarify that, in any case where a beneficiary entitled to compensation, pension, or dependency and indemnity compensation enters into an agreement with another person under which agreement such other person acquires for consideration the right to receive such benefits by payment of such compensation, pension, or dependency and indemnity compensation, as the case may be . . . such agreement shall be deemed to be an assignment and is prohibited.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4101 ","title":"Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Property Regime v.

Queenâ€™s Grant II is part of a series of horizontal property regimes in a resort known as Palmetto Dunes.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant II appeals from an order dismissing two of its three causes of action.Â  On appeal, Queenâ€™s Grant II limits its challenge to the dismissal of its claim for prospective declaratory relief regarding the efficacy of an amendment to restrictive covenants concerning assessments for maintenance in Palmetto Dunes.Â  Greenwood Development Corporation, the owner of Palmetto Dunes, appeals: (1) from the denial of its motion for summary judgment as to Queenâ€™s Grant IIâ€™s claim for breach of contract for failure to repair a road within the Queenâ€™s Grant II regime; and (2) from the denial of its motion for attorney fees and costs.Â  We affirm in result in part and reverse in part with respect to the dismissal of Queenâ€™s Grant IIâ€™s declaratory judgment claim.Â  We affirm the denial of Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion for attorney fees and costs.Â  We elect not to entertain, and thus dismiss, Greenwood Developmentâ€™s interlocutory appeal from the denial of its summary judgment motion, and we remand.[1]  \r\nAlthough this case involves many issues, primarily related to restrictive covenants and tangentially to horizontal property law, the essence of our holding is that a developer may reserve to himself, in his sole discretion, the right to amend restrictive covenants running with the land or impose new restrictive covenants running with the land, provided five conditions are met: (1) the right to amend the covenants or impose new covenants must be unambiguously set forth in the original declaration of covenants; (2) the developer, at the time of the amended or new covenants, must possess a sufficient property interest in the development; (3) the developer must strictly comply with the amendment procedure as set forth in the declaration of covenants; (4) the developer must provide notice of amended or new covenants in strict accordance with the declaration of covenants and as otherwise may be provided by law; and (5) the amended or new covenants must not be unreasonable, indefinite, or contravene public policy.Â  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n I.\r\nPalmetto Dunes is a real estate resort development that includes multiple horizontal property regimes located on Hilton Head Island in Beaufort County, South Carolina.Â  The development consists of various single and multi-family residences, commercial establishments, and resort facilities.Â  The initial developer of Palmetto Dunes was Palmetto Dunes Resort, Inc. (Palmetto Dunes Resort), a subsidiary of Phipps Land Company, Inc.Â  \r\nBetween 1968 and 1972, Palmetto Dunes Resort filed and recorded various covenants relating to contemplated single-family and multi-family developments throughout Palmetto Dunes.Â  The Declaration of Covenants,[2] recorded in 1972, sets forth various rights, conditions, and restrictions concerning â€œall multi-family dwelling areas within Palmetto Dunes,â€ including â€œlands conveyed in the future in Palmetto Dunes.â€Â  The Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Property Regime became subject to the Declaration of Covenants when it was created in 1974.Â  The 1972 Covenants imposed restrictions throughout Palmetto Dunes, including, for example, covenants respecting ocean front property, lagoons, ponds, lakes, and golf courses.Â  \r\nUnder the 1972 Covenants, Palmetto Dunes Resort agreed to maintain â€œcommunity areasâ€ in the resort, but only to the extent â€œsuch maintenance and services can be provided with the proceeds.â€Â  Such services were to be funded by assessing all multi-family unit owners in the resort.Â  Paragraph 22 of the 1972 Covenants provided:\r\n\r\nIn order to provide a permanent fund to maintain, landscape and repair private streets (except those located within a privately owned lot), walkways and like community areas, maintain the beachfront, lagoons and other bodies of water in a clean and orderly condition, provide for pest control when needed and in general provide those services important to the development and preservation of an attractive community appearance, and further, to maintain the privacy, security and general safety of the residential communities in Palmetto Dunes, each owner of a multi-family dwelling unit shall pay annually to [Palmetto Dunes Resort] the sum of Sixty ($60.00) Dollars per residential unit, said sum to be placed in an account and to be used exclusively for the purposes hereinabove noted.Â  From and after January 1, 1974, this annual payment may be increased each year by the percentage of increase in the consumer price index for the previous year, or at the option of [Palmetto Dunes Resort] may be increased each year up to five (5) percent of the maximum authorized payment for the previous year. \r\n\r\nQueenâ€™s Grant II (Queenâ€™s Grant) is one of the multi-family horizontal property regimes within Palmetto Dunes.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant consists of 81 condominium units and comprises just a small part of Palmetto Dunes.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant was created in 1974 when Palmetto Dunes Resort recorded a master deed (Master Deed) subjecting the property to the South Carolina Horizontal Property Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-31-10 to 300 (1991 &amp; Supp. 2005).[3]Â  The Master Deed provides for the administration of the Queenâ€™s Grant regime in accordance with its bylaws.Â  \r\nThe Master Deed references the 1972 Covenants and provides that â€œnothing contained [in the Master Deed] shall limit the rights of Palmetto Dunes Resort, Inc., its successors or assigns, as set forth in the aforesaid Declaration.â€ The Declaration of Covenants reserved to Palmetto Dunes Resort, or its successors, the right to modify or impose additional covenants at any time in its sole discretion.Â  The Declaration of Covenants further provided that any modifications to prior covenants would apply only to units sold after the amended covenants were recorded.Â  Additionally, the Declaration of Covenants reserved to Palmetto Dunes Resort a thirty-day right of repurchase (â€œat the same price at which the highest bona-fide offer has been made for the propertyâ€) in the event any unit owner should decide to sell.Â  \r\nQueenâ€™s Grant, as a multi-family dwelling area within Palmetto Dunes, was subject to the assessments under the 1972 Covenants to fund Palmetto Dunes Resortâ€™s maintenance obligations throughout the resort.Â  Additionally, the Master Deed creating Queenâ€™s Grant and the regimeâ€™s bylaws assign to Queenâ€™s Grant the responsibility for the maintenance of the property within its regime.[4]Â  The bylaws created the â€œCouncil of Co-Owners,â€ consisting of the unit owners within the Queenâ€™s Grant regime. The Council, in turn, is governed by a â€œBoard of Administration.â€[5]Â  This Board, on behalf of the regime, has many duties, including the â€œ[c]ollection of assessments from the co-owners . . . [and the] [c]are, upkeep and surveillance of the [Queenâ€™s Grant] Property and the Common Elements.â€Â  The bylaws further authorize the imposition of â€œperiodic assessmentsâ€ on â€œ[a]ll co-ownersâ€ to meet all regime â€œcommon expenses.â€Â  Queenâ€™s Grant thus is obligated to perform within its regime â€œ[a]ll maintenance, repair and replacement to the common elements as defined in the Master Deed.â€Â  The Master Deed defines the â€œcommon elementsâ€ broadly to include virtually every aspect of regime maintenance, including â€œthe land on which the Apartments are constructed, . . . [p]arking facilities located on the Property, . . . [and] [a]ll roads, walkways [and] paths.â€Â  \r\nPalmetto Dunes Resort conveyed the last of the units in Queenâ€™s Grant in 1977.Â  In 1979, Palmetto Dunes Resort (through its parent company, Phipps Land Development) was sold to Greenwood Development, an unaffiliated company.Â  As successor in interest, Greenwood Development continued under the name â€œPalmetto Dunes Resortâ€ and acquired all rights of its predecessor, including those under the 1972 Covenants.Â  \r\nGreenwood Development determined the assessments under the 1972 Covenants were insufficient to fund its maintenance duties throughout the resort.Â  Greenwood Development, in the exercise of its right to amend the covenants, consequently recorded amended covenants in 1981â€”the 1981 Covenants[6]â€”applicable to all multi-family dwelling areas in Palmetto Dunes.[7]Â  Tracking language from the 1972 Covenants, Greenwood Development made the 1981 Covenants applicable â€œto lands conveyed in the future in Palmetto Dunes by deeds or other instruments hereafter made which make reference to this Declaration of Covenants.â€Â  The 1981 Covenants are substantially similar to the 1972 Covenants, but the 1981 Covenants increase the annual maintenance assessment.Â  Article IV of the 1981 Covenants provides, in relevant part: \r\n\r\nIn order to provide a permanent fund to maintain, landscape and repair private streets (except those located within a privately owned lot), walkways and like community areas, maintain the beachfront, lagoons and other bodies of water in a clean and orderly condition, repair damage caused by beach erosion, provide for pest control when needed and in general provide those services important to the development and preservation of an attractive community appearance, and further, to maintain the privacy, security and general safety of the residential communities in Palmetto Dunes Resort, each owner of a multi-family dwelling unit shall pay annually to Greenwood the sum of Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars per multi-family unit or apartment, said sum to be placed in an account and to be used exclusively for the purposes hereinabove noted.Â  From and after January 1, 1982, this annual payment may be increased each year by the percentage of increase in the Consumer Price Index for the previous year, or at the option of Greenwood may be increased each year up to ten (10%) percent of the maximum authorized payment for the previous year.Â  \r\n\r\nThe 1981 Covenants left unchanged the proviso that the responsibility for maintenance and services is limited â€œto the extent such maintenance and services can be provided with the proceeds of the assessments.â€Â  Greenwood Developmentâ€™s right of repurchase of the units was also left intact in the 1981 Covenants.Â  \r\nThe 1981 Covenantsâ€”specifically the increased assessmentsâ€”were applied to Queenâ€™s Grant units sold after the covenants were recorded.Â  By 2002, all but fourteen Queenâ€™s Grant units had been transferred, and the new owners were being assessed at the higher rate.Â  Beyond recording the 1981 Covenants, Greenwood Development additionally sought to targetâ€”provide actual notice ofâ€”the 1981 Covenantsâ€™ application to individual units as they were sold by two methods:Â  (1) by specific reference to and incorporation of the 1981 Covenants into deeds transferring title; and (2) by reference to the covenants or the increased assessments in waiver agreements (Waiver Agreements) signed by the new owners.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Waiver Agreements were so named because they purported to waive Greenwood Developmentâ€™s preemptive right of repurchase under the covenants.Â  However, both methods were not utilized in all cases.Â  In some cases, only Waiver Agreements were utilizedâ€”referencing the 1981 Covenants or the higher rate of assessmentâ€”and in other cases, there was no Waiver Agreement, as only deeds provided notice of the 1981 Covenants.Â  Regarding units sold and purchased after the recording of the 1981 Covenants, thirty-one units have deeds and Waiver Agreements referencing the 1981 Covenants; five units have only deeds that reference the 1981 Covenants; twenty-six units have Waiver Agreements that reference the 1981 Covenants; and five units â€œreference the higher assessment of the [1981 Covenants], but not the [1981 Covenants] themselves . . . .â€ \r\nII. \r\nThis lawsuit arose from a dispute over responsibility for a $175 road repair invoice.[8]Â  In December of 2000, Queenâ€™s Grant paid $175 for the road repair and demanded payment from Greenwood Development, but Greenwood Development refused.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant then brought an action for breach of contract seeking to recover the $175.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant expanded the dispute to challenge Greenwood Developmentâ€™s ability to amend the 1972 Covenants and enforce assessments under the 1981 Covenants; Queenâ€™s Grant sought a return to the lower assessment under the 1972 Covenants.Â  This relief was sought in the form of a declaratory judgment that Greenwood Development lacked the authority to amend the covenants in 1981, and therefore each co-owner in the regime should be assessed in the future pursuant to the lower fee in the 1972 Covenants.Â  The declaratory judgment claimâ€”seeking only prospective reliefâ€”is an equitable claim.Â  Finally, Queenâ€™s Grant sought a refund in an action at law of all assessments collected in excess of that due under the 1972 Covenants.Â  \r\nGreenwood Development filed two motions for summary judgment.Â  The first motion requested summary judgment on Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s first cause of action relating to the road repair.Â  Greenwood Developmentâ€™s second motion sought summary judgment as to the second and third causes of action regarding the maintenance assessment.Â  The circuit court issued an order granting Greenwood Developmentâ€™s second motion, but refused to grant its first motion.[9]Â  The motions for reconsideration by both parties were denied.Â  Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion for attorney fees and costs was also denied.\r\nQueenâ€™s Grant appeals only from the dismissal of its second cause of action seeking declaratory relief as to the unit ownersâ€™ responsibility for future assessments under the 1981 Covenants.Â  Greenwood Development cross-appeals, claiming the circuit court erred in two respects: (1) in failing to grant it summary judgment as to the breach of contract action concerning the road repair invoice; and (2) in failing to award it attorney fees and costs.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  Summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  On appeal, when factual matters are in dispute, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  However, when the facts are not in dispute, the question before the court is one of law.Â  Dawson v. S.C. Power Co.,&nbsp;220 S.C. 26, 32, 66 S.E.2d 322, 325&nbsp;(1951) (holding that when only one reasonable inference can be drawn from a contested issue of fact, the question becomes one of law for the court).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI.\r\nQueenâ€™s Grantâ€™s AppealÂ Â Â  \r\nQueenâ€™s Grant acknowledges it has maintenance responsibilities on two fronts: (1) the payment of assessments to Palmetto Dunes Resort for maintenance of Palmetto Dunesâ€™ properties beyond its regime; and (2) the maintenance of its own regime property, including the common elements.Â  Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s appeal does not involve its maintenance obligations within its regime.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-190 (1991) (providing that each co-owner must contribute toward the maintenance of the regime common areas).Â  Queenâ€™s Grant further does not challenge the obligation of its owners (as originally imposed in the 1972 Covenants) to pay to Greenwood Development assessments for maintenance of the common areas beyond the Queenâ€™s Grant regime.[10]Â  Queenâ€™s Grant simply wants to limit those assessments to the rate as established in the 1972 Covenants.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant, therefore, appeals from the entry of summary judgment dismissing its second cause of action seeking a declaratory judgment that all unit owners in the regime be assessed prospectively at the lower rate under the 1972 Covenants.\r\nAlthough the circuit court concluded the 1981 Covenants are valid, a review of the order granting summary judgment reveals that the circuit court primarily based its decision on the equitable doctrines of estoppel and laches.[11]Â Â  \r\n\r\nA. Circuit Courtâ€™s Grant of Summary Judgment \r\n  \r\n1.Â  Estoppel Â \r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ â€œEstoppel arises when a party, relying upon what another has said or done, changes his position to his detriment.â€Â  Gibbs v. Kimbrell, 311 S.C. 261, 268, 428 S.E.2d 725, 729 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  A claim of estoppel includes elements for the party asserting estoppel and the party estopped.Â  E.g., Provident Life and Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 477, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994) (listing the elements of equitable estoppel:Â  as to the estopped party, a misrepresentation or nondisclosure, intent to induce the other party to act, and actual or constructive knowledge of the true facts; and as to the party claiming estoppel, lack of knowledge, or means of acquiring knowledge of the true facts, reasonable reliance, and prejudicial change of position).Â  \r\nAs the circuit court found, it is a well-established principle in South Carolina that estoppel by silence arises when one party observes another dealing with his property in a manner inconsistent with his rights and makes no objection while the other party changes his position based on the partyâ€™s silence.Â  Seabrook Island Property Owners Association v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 356 S.E.2d 411 (Ct. App. 1987), supports the circuit courtâ€™s adoption of Greenwood Developmentâ€™s estoppel defense as to Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s now-abandoned refund claim.Â  In Pelzer, the ownersâ€™ association sued to collect an unpaid annual assessment.Â  Id. at 345, 356 S.E.2d at 412.Â  The landowner counterclaimed and sought a refund of assessments paid for the years 1976 through 1983 on the basis that the assessment was invalid.Â  Id.Â  This court found in favor of the landowner in that the assessment violated the applicable restrictive covenants and bylaws, yet the court concluded the landowner was not entitled to a refund of the excess assessments paid in prior years.Â  Id. at 348, 356 S.E.2d at 414.Â  The landownerâ€™s inability to recover the excessive assessments rested in his estoppel by silence.Â  As the court observed:\r\n\r\n[Pelzer] acquiesced in the method of assessment and paid the charges.Â  The Association expended the moneys for purposes authorized by the by-laws.Â  Pelzer received the benefit of those expenditures. He cannot now return the benefits or restore the Association to its former position.Â  . . .Â  If a party stands by and sees another dealing with his property in a manner inconsistent with his rights and makes no objection while the other changes his position, his silence is acquiescence and it estops him from later seeking relief.Â Â  \r\n\r\nId.  \r\nThe Pelzer courtâ€™s treatment of the estoppel defense clearly applies to Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s efforts in the trial court to recover allegedly excessive assessments for the past two decades, a claim now abandoned.Â  But the estoppel defense does not summarily dispose of the declaratory judgment claim of Queenâ€™s Grant for prospective relief.Â  There are genuine issues of material fact concerning the application of estoppel to these facts.Â  For example, the record does not support a finding as a matter of law that Greenwood Development would be prejudiced by an adverse ruling in the declaratory judgment cause of action (that the assessments under the 1981 Covenants were not authorized), thereby requiring future assessments under the 1972 Covenants.Â  In this regard, both the 1972 Covenants and 1981 Covenants provide that Greenwood Development is responsible for providing services only to the extent the funds from unit owners covered such services.Â  Because the element of detrimental reliance may be lacking (as well as other elements), the estoppel defense does not entitle Greenwood Development to summary judgment on the declaratory judgment cause of action.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n2.Â  Laches \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court alternatively found that laches bars Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s declaratory judgment cause of action seeking only prospective relief.Â  â€œâ€˜Lachesâ€™ is defined as â€˜neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€™â€Â  Gordon v. Drews,&nbsp;358 S.C. 598, 612, 595 S.E.2d 864, 871&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 296, 519 S.E.2d 583, 598 (Ct. App. 1999)).Â  â€œDelay alone is not enough to constitute laches; it must be unreasonable, and the party asserting laches must show prejudice.â€Â  Gordon,&nbsp;358 S.C. at 612, 595 S.E.2d at 871&nbsp;(quoting Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, 265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  \r\nWe again confront the circuit courtâ€™s blanket finding of prejudice against Greenwood Development, a finding in which Greenwood Development may seek refuge only as to the claim for a refund of past assessments.Â  For the same reason the circuit court could not properly find estoppel and grant Greenwood Development summary judgment as to the claim for prospective relief, the court erred in relying alternatively on laches to dismiss the declaratory judgment cause of action.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n3.Â  The Validity of the 1981 Covenants\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe now turn to the merits of Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s challenge to the validity of the 1981 Covenants.Â  The circuit court in its conclusions of law ruled that â€œthe assessment imposed under the [1981] Covenants is, as a matter of law, a valid assessment imposed pursuant to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s rights, as a successor and assign of [Palmetto Dunes Resort], pursuant to the plain and unambiguous provisions of the [1972] Covenants permitting the amendment of the [1972] Covenants.â€Â  We concur with the circuit court, with the exception of five units in Queenâ€™s Grant. \r\n In South Carolina, an owner of a fee or leasehold interest in certain real property may declare the property to be subject to a horizontal property regime.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-30 (Supp. 2005).Â  The term horizontal is a misnomer, for a â€œcondominium is actually a vertical property regime composed of horizontal slices of airspace . . . within the vertical column.â€Â  Sea Watch Stores Ltd. Liab. Co. v. Council of Unit Owners of Sea Watch Condo.,&nbsp;691 A.2d 750, 753 n.1 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1997).Â  When land is submitted to a horizontal property regime, no new property is created, even though the structure as completed may include many floors of condominium units.Â  Id. at 753.Â  Instead, condominium statutes, like South Carolinaâ€™s Horizontal Property Act, merely created a new way to own and regulate airspace.Â  Id.Â  Condominium apartments may be bought and sold like real property.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-31-40 and 60 (1991).Â  Ownership in a condominium may be subject to deed restrictions and covenants like any other real property.Â  See Sea Watch, 691 A.2d at 753-54.Â  \r\nThe creation of a horizontal property regime is accomplished through compliance with the South Carolina Horizontal Property Act.Â  Section 27-31-40 of the South Carolina Code provides that once property is submitted to a condominium horizontal property regime, individual apartments may be owned, conveyed and encumbered independently of other apartments, subject to the same general principles of law governing real property.Â  See 4 S.C. Jur. Condominiums Â§ 9 (2005).Â  Apartments, for horizontal property purposes, are defined in section 27-31-20(a) (1991) as â€œa part of the property intended for any type of independent use . . . including one or more rooms or enclosed spaces . . . .â€Â Â  Each â€œco-owner,â€ or owner of an apartment in a regime, acquires â€œcondominium ownership,â€ and owns his or her individual apartment, and has a common right to share, with other co-owners, in the common areas of the property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-20(c) and (d) (Supp. 2005); Â§ 27-31-60.\r\nProperty, whether subject to the Horizontal Property Act, may, of course, be governed by restrictive covenants.Â  Real covenants have been defined as â€œagreement[s] . . . to do, or refrain from doing, certain things with respect to real property.â€Â  20 Am. Jur. 2d Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions Â§ 1 (2005).Â  Therefore, covenants, â€œin a sense are contractual in nature and bind the parties thereto in the same manner as would any other contract.â€Â  Id. (citing Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assoc. v. Pelzer, 292 S.C. 343, 356 S.E.2d 411 (Ct. App. 1987)).Â  Restrictive covenants are construed like contracts and may give rise to actions for breach of contract.Â  17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 2 (2005) (citing Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 202 S.E.2d 363 (1974) and Manning v. City of Columbia, 297 S.C. 451, 377 S.E.2d 335 (1989)).Â  However, restrictive covenants affecting real property cannot be properly and fully understood without resort to property law. \r\nRestrictive covenants differ from contracts in that they â€œrun with the land,â€ meaning that they are enforceable by and against later grantees.Â  17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 18 (2005).Â  Restrictive covenants that require grantees to pay assessments for the upkeep of a particular parcel of property are held to be real covenants which â€œtouch and concernâ€ land, and therefore, run with the land.Â  Epting v. Lexington Water Power Co., 177 S.C. 308, 314-317, 181 S.E.2d 66, 69-70 (1935); 17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§Â§ 18 and 19.Â  \r\nThere are several ways in which restrictive covenants may be created.Â  The most common means are:Â  (1) by deed; (2) by declaration; and (3) by implication from a general plan or scheme of development.Â  17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 60.Â  The initial restrictive covenants applicable to Palmetto Dunes were created by the Declaration of Covenants when Palmetto Dunes Resort executed and recorded the 1972 Covenants.Â  See Smith v. Commâ€™rs of Pub. Works of City of Charleston,&nbsp;312 S.C. 460, 466, 441 S.E.2d 331, 335&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994); 17 S.C. Jur. Covenants Â§ 8.Â  \r\nRestrictive covenants will be enforced unless they are indefinite or contravene public policy.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).Â  Moreover, a developer may generally reserve to himself the right to amend restrictive covenants in his sole discretion, and may do so without the consent of the grantee, so long as he exercises that right in a reasonable manner.Â  Flamingo Ranch Estates, Inc. v. Sunshine Ranches Homeowners, Inc., 303 So. 2d 665, 666 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1974) (citing Johnson v. Three Bays Props. #2, Inc., 159 So. 2d 924, 925 n.1 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1964)), cited with approval in Wright v. Cypress Shores Dev. Co., Inc.,&nbsp;413 So. 2d 1115, 1123-24&nbsp;(Ala. 1982); Rossman v. Seasons at Tiara Rado Assocs.,&nbsp;943 P.2d 34, 37&nbsp;(Colo. Ct. App. 1996); Markey v. Wolf,&nbsp;607 A.2d 82, 94&nbsp;(Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1992); Appel v. Presley Cos., 806 P.2d 1054, 1056&nbsp;(N.M. 1991); Scoville v. SpringPark Homeownerâ€™s Assoc., Inc.,&nbsp;784 S.W.2d 498, 509 n.7&nbsp;(Tex. App. 1990); Lakemoor Cmty. Club, Inc. v. Swanson, 600 P.2d 1022, 1025 (Wash. Ct. App. 1979).[12]Â Â Â  However, when a subdivision developer is divested of all interest in the subdivision, a reserved right to amend restrictive covenants is extinguished.Â  Armstrong v. Roberts,&nbsp;325 S.E.2d 769, 770&nbsp;(Ga. 1985).Â  Additionally, when a developer fails to expressly reserve a right to amend the covenants, amendments are not allowed.Â  Heritage Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Eagle Lake &amp; Golf Condos., 318 S.C. 535, 541, 458 S.E.2d 561, 565 (Ct. App. 1995); Shipyard Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assoc. v. Mangiaracina, 307 S.C. 299, S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\nThe centerpiece of Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s Complaint and appeal is its challenge to the amended covenants in 1981, specifically the increased assessment to fund Greenwood Developmentâ€™s maintenance obligations.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant presses three arguments in its effort to invalidate the 1981 Covenants and return to lower assessments under the 1972 Covenants.Â  First, because all units in the Queenâ€™s Grant regime had been sold prior to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s acquisition of Palmetto Dunes in 1979, Greenwood Development â€œcannot impose covenants/restrictions on property that it does not own.â€Â  Final Appellantâ€™s brief of Appellant-Respondent at 19.Â  Second, because the Master Deed of â€œQueens Grant II makes no reference to the 1981 Covenants, â€¦ [t]he 1981 Covenants are therefore void.â€Â  Id. at 18-19.Â  Third, the 1981 Covenants may not be sanctioned pursuant to the so-called Waiver Agreements for a variety of reasons, primarily grounded in contract law principles and the claim that the preemptive repurchase right reserved to the Declarant[13] violates the rule against perpetuities.Â  Id. at 22.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All Condominium Units in the Queenâ€™s Grant Regime Were Sold Prior to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s Acquisition of Palmetto Dunes\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nQueenâ€™s Grant argues that Greenwood Development lacked authority to amend the restrictive covenants because it bought Palmetto Dunes after all the units in the Queenâ€™s Grant regime had been sold, and thus Greenwood Development â€œcannot impose covenants/restrictions on property that it does not own.â€Â  Â This argument is unavailing, for Queenâ€™s Grant misapprehends the purpose of the assessment under the 1972 Covenants and the 1981 Covenants, as well as Greenwood Developmentâ€™s unquestioned ownership of property within Palmetto Dunes.Â  The assessment at issue relates to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s maintenance responsibilities in the resort well beyond the confines of Queenâ€™s Grant.Â  Greenwood Developmentâ€™s lack of a direct ownership interest in the property of Queenâ€™s Grant in no manner impedes its continuing rights as Declarant under the 1972 Covenants, including its ability to amend the covenants.Â  As noted, Palmetto Dunes does not merely consist of a single horizontal property regime, and Queenâ€™s Grant comprises just a small part of Palmetto Dunes.Â  \r\nQueenâ€™s Grant asks us to follow the rule that a developer of a subdivision who reserves authority respecting restrictive covenants running with the land loses that authority when he divests himself of his interest in the subdivision.Â  Armstrong v. Roberts, 325 S.E.2d 769, 770 (Ga. 1985).Â  This rule has no application here, for Greenwood Development maintains a substantial interest in Palmetto Dunes.Â  Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s narrow viewâ€”limiting the analysis to the confines of its regimeâ€”is myopic and fails to recognize Greenwood Developmentâ€™s interest in Palmetto Dunes and its corresponding obligation to maintain resort properties far beyond the Queenâ€™s Grant regime. The unchallenged 1972 Covenants and the challenged 1981 Covenants relate to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s maintenance responsibilities for resort property (beyond the confines of the Queenâ€™s Grant regime) in which it clearly does have an ownership interest.\r\nMoreover, Greenwood Developmentâ€™s predecessor, Palmetto Dunes Resort, reserved the right to amend the restrictive covenants in its sole discretion.Â  Palmetto Dunes Resort owned the development at the time the original covenants were recorded, including rights in the property such as easements, right of ways, and lands held in trust within each regime.Â  Greenwood Development acquired all Palmetto Dunes Resortâ€™s rights and obligations when it purchased the development.Â  Palmetto Dunes Resortâ€™s interest in Palmetto Dunes did not evaporate when the last unit in Queenâ€™s Grant was sold.Â  We conclude as a matter of law that Palmetto Dunes Resort had an interest in the property of Palmetto Dunes when it sold its interest to Greenwood Development.Â  Greenwood Development acquired that property interest.Â  Accordingly, the sale of all units in the Queenâ€™s Grant regime prior to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s 1979 purchase did not foreclose its right to amend the 1972 Covenants. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nb.Â  The Master Deed \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe next address whether the failure of the Master Deed to reference the 1981 Covenants renders those covenants void.Â  Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s challenge here focuses on the Horizontal Property Act.[14]Â  The Act requires a master deed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 27-31-20(i), 27-31-30, and 27-31-100. The Act requires that the master deed include a comprehensive list of particulars, including a â€œdescription of the full legal rights and obligations, both currently existing and which may occur, of the apartment owner, the co-owners, and the person establishing the regime.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-100(f).Â  It is Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s contention that for restrictive covenants to be enforceable against unit owners in a regime under the Act, those covenants must be expressly included in the Master Deed.Â Â  According to Queenâ€™s Grant, â€œthe 1972 Covenants are the only valid covenants that are binding upon the co-owners of the Queens Grant II regime.â€ (Final Appellantâ€™s brief of Appellant-Respondent, 18-19).Â  Queenâ€™s Grant further points to the language in the Master Deed that its â€œprovisions [shall not be] amended unless all of the co-owners and the mortgagees of all the mortgages covering the Apartments unanimously agree to such . . . amendment.â€[15]Â  \r\nTo the extent the covenants may be governed by the Act, we believe Queenâ€™s Grant reads section 27-31-100(f) too narrowly, and fails to consider critical provisions of the Master Deed, as well as other sections of the Act.Â  Paragraph SIXTEENTH of the Master Deed provides in part:\r\n\r\n[E]ach co-owner shall comply with the provisions of this Master Deed and authorized amendments thereto, the Declaration of Covenants, . . . applicable to all Multi-Family Residential Areas in Palmetto Dunes . . . and the Regime By-laws . . . provided that nothing contained herein shall limit the rights of Palmetto Dunes Resort, Inc., its successors and assigns, as set forth in the aforesaid Declaration. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  \r\nIt was not necessary to amend the Master Deed for the 1981 Covenants to apply to units sold thereafter when the subsequent purchasers received notice of the 1981 Covenants in the manner prescribed by those covenants.Â  The Master Deed therefore, as a matter of law, satisfies general principles of property law, including the requirement of the Actâ€”section 27-31-100(f)â€”that the master deed include a â€œdescription of the full legal rights and obligations, both currently existing and which may occur, of the apartment owner, the co-owners, and the person establishing the regime.â€Â  Cf. Douglas Scott MacGregor, South Carolina Condominium Law Â§ 2.04(C) (S.C. Bar Assoc. 2000) (â€œThe SCHPA[,] unlike most condominium acts, has no requirements regarding the placement of use restrictions.â€).Â Â  \r\nThis finding comports with other provisions of the Act.Â  Section 27-31-170, for example, allows for the inclusion of restrictive covenants outside of a master deed:Â  â€œEach co-owner shall comply strictly . . . with the covenants, conditions and restrictions set forth in the master deed or lease or in the deed or lease to his apartment.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  The emphasized language of this statute refutes Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s interpretation of section 27-31-100(f) that only covenants expressly referenced in a master deed are enforceable.Â  We hold that because the Master Deed reserves all rights under the Declaration of Covenants, section 27-31-170 permits the inclusion of lawfully amended covenants in individual Queenâ€™s Grant deeds.Â  Heritage Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc.,&nbsp;318 S.C. at 541, 458 S.E.2d at 565&nbsp;(â€œS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-100(f) permits a developer to reserve certain rights provided he states those rights with specificity in the master deed.â€).Â  This lines up with the triggering language in the 1981 Covenants[16] that the covenants would apply to multi-family dwellings conveyed in the future (following the recording of the covenants) â€œby deeds or other instruments hereafter made which make reference to this Declaration of Covenants.â€Â  1981 Covenants (emphasis added).Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\nc. The Waiver Agreements \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWe next turn to the Waiver Agreements as the basis for imposing the increased assessments on the unit owners in Queenâ€™s Grant.Â  The 1981 Covenants provide the procedure for making the assessments applicable to multi-family dwellings â€œconveyed in the future.â€Â  The 1981 Covenants apply to multi-family dwellings where the covenants are referenced â€œby deeds or other instruments hereafter made which make reference to this Declaration of Covenants.â€Â  1981 Covenants (emphasis added).Â  We begin with the premise that in construing restrictive covenants, ambiguities must be strictly construed against the party seeking to enforce them.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 893-94 (1987); Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assoc. v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 662, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Greenwood Development chose the language by which the 1981 Covenants would become applicable to new unit owners.Â  We find the award of summary judgment to Greenwood Development inappropriate where it failed to strictly comply with the method of notice it prescribed in the 1981 Covenants.Â  There are five units in which Greenwood Development seeks to impose the increased assessments based solely on Waiver Agreements that do not reference the 1981 Covenants.Â  Those units are 501, 523, 530, 533, and 544.Â  We reverse the grant of summary judgment as to these five units.Â  Beyond the technical noncompliance with the language in the 1981 Covenants (limiting applicability to â€œinstruments . . . which make reference toâ€ the covenants), there remain unanswered questions.Â  For example, the parties dispute whether the 1981 Covenants themselves are in the chain of title for units within Queenâ€™s Grant.Â  We cannot answer this and other questions to the exacting summary judgment standard on the record before us.Â  \r\nIn those instances where Greenwood Development relies on the Waiver Agreementsâ€”which do reference the 1981 Covenantsâ€”to impose the increased annual assessment, we find the 1981 Covenants enforceable.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant asserts the Waiver Agreements are â€œcontractsâ€ and are void for lack of consideration,[17] for lack of mutual assent and for violating the rule against perpetuities. We believe the matter is governed by property, not contract, law.Â  \r\nThe issue is notice of the amended covenants (in accordance with the triggering language in the 1981 Covenants), not a bargained-for consideration to gain a purchaserâ€™s consent to the increased assessment.Â  Consent is not an issue, for the Declaration of Covenants allows for amendments to the covenants in the sole discretion of the Declarant. This discretion is limited not by a prospective ownerâ€™s objection or acquiescence to paying a higher assessment, but by the lawâ€”covenants must be neither indefinite nor contravene public policy.Â  Wells, 294 S.C. at 270, 363 S.E.2d at 894; accord Woodside Village Condo. Assoc., Inc. v. Jahren,&nbsp;806 So. 2d 452, 461&nbsp;(Fla. 2002) (holding that unit owners were on notice that their rights were subject to change via properly adopted amendments); McElveen-Hunter v. Fountain Manor Assoc., Inc.,&nbsp;386 S.E.2d 435, 436&nbsp;(N.C. Ct. App. 1989), affâ€™d, 399 S.E.2d 112 (N.C. 1991) (holding that where the condominium documents so allow, occupancy and leasing restrictions in an amendment to the declaration may bind even unit owners who bought their units before the amendment was adopted).Â  There is no claim by Queenâ€™s Grant that the 1981 Covenants are indefinite or contravene public policy.Â  Moreover, Queenâ€™s Grant does not challenge the reasonableness of the assessment increase in 1981. \r\nThe final argument in connection with the Waiver Agreements is Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s contention that the contingent, nonvested preemptive right to repurchase units (as reasserted in the 1981 Covenants) violates the rule against perpetuities.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant concludes that the waiver of an unenforceable right cannot serve as valuable consideration to support the Waiver Agreements.Â  According to the rule against perpetuities, a nonvested property interest is invalid unless â€œ(1) when the interest is created, it is certain to vest or terminate no later than twenty-one years after the death of an individual then alive; or (2) the interest either vests or terminates within ninety years after its creation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-6-20 (1991).[18]Â  Nonvested property interests tend to restrain the free alienability of property and interfere with its beneficial use.Â  61 Am. Jur. 2d Perpetuities and Restraints on Alienation Â§ 6 (2005).Â  This court has had occasion to invalidate a right of first refusal in a deed where the contingent, nonvested interest attempted to reserve to the holder of the preemptive rightâ€”the grantorâ€”a perpetual option to repurchase the property for the original consideration.Â  Webb v. Reames, 326 S.C. 444, 446-47, 485 S.E.2d 384, 385 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Greenwood Development cites to numerous cases from other jurisdictions upholding repurchase provisions similar to that in the 1981 Covenants, and rejecting application of the rule against perpetuities, where the right to repurchase the property is for the same price the owner is willing to sell to a third party.Â  Weber v. Texas Co.,&nbsp;83 F.2d 807, 808&nbsp;(5th Cir. 1936), Cambridge Co. v. East Slope Inv. Corp.,&nbsp;700 P.2d 537, 542&nbsp;(Colo. 1985); Shiver v. Benton,&nbsp;304 S.E.2d 903, 906-07&nbsp;(Ga. 1983); cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-6-60(B) (holding that under the Uniform Statutory Rule Against Perpetuities, courts must reform a disposition that was created before July 1, 1987 by inserting a savings clause that preserves the transferorâ€™s plan of distribution â€œwithin the limits of the rule against perpetuitiesâ€).Â  We decline to resolve this issue because there is no justiciable controversy surrounding the right of first refusal provision.Â  This record is devoid of any attempt at any time by Greenwood Development to exercise its right of repurchase.Â  See Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assoc. of S.C. v. Resources Planning Corp., 358 S.C. 460, 477, 596 S.E.2d 51, 60&nbsp;(2004) (â€œAbsent a pending sale or offer for sale, or purchase or offer to purchase, or the presence of a third party challenging right of first refusal, there is no justiciable controversy.â€)Â  In any event, because we have determined that the Waiver Agreements served their intended notice function, we find Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s various contract law based challenges misplaced.Â  \r\nWhile the Waiver Agreements may have been inartfully named, they did serve the purpose of giving each prospective owner notice of the applicability of the 1981 Covenants, even if those covenants were not in the granteeâ€™s deed. Harbison Cmty. Assoc., Inc. v. Mueller,&nbsp; 319 S.C. 99, 103, 459 S.E.2d 860, 863&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995) (â€œA covenant is enforceable against a subsequent grantee, even if not in the granteeâ€™s deed, if the grantee has actual or constructive notice of the covenant.â€).Â  As the record reflects, all but fourteen unit owners had notice of the increased assessments through references in their deeds or in the Waiver Agreements.[19]Â  For those units in which Greenwood Development relies solely on the Waiver Agreements which reference the 1981 Covenants, the so-called agreements satisfied the triggering provision in the 1981 Covenants and served their intended notice function.\r\nIn sum, because the Declaration of Covenants reserved to Palmetto Dunes Resort, and hence Greenwood Development as successor, the right to amend the restrictive covenants, purchasers of units in the Queenâ€™s Grant regime accepted their respective deeds subject to this right.Â  Excepting the five Queenâ€™s Grant units discussed above, we affirm the grant of summary judgment and reject the balance of Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s multiple challenges to the validity of the 1981 Covenants.Â  The increased assessments under Article IV in the 1981 Covenants are enforceable, save the exception noted above.\r\n II. \r\nGreenwood Developmentâ€™s Appeal \r\nGreenwood Development appeals from the denial of its motion for summary judgment as to the breach of contract claim concerning the road repair invoice and its motion for attorney fees and costs. \r\n\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Circuit Courtâ€™s Denial of Summary Judgment \r\n\r\nAlthough we may entertain appeals from interlocutory orders not ordinarily appealable when they are companion to reviewable issues,[20] we believe the purposeful decision of the circuit court to avoid any consideration of the motion dictates restraint.Â  We dismiss Greenwood Developmentâ€™s appeal as interlocutory.Â  \r\nThe circuit court order is not conducive to appellate review.Â  The circuit court order is as follows:\r\n\r\nThe case comes before me upon [Greenwood Developmentâ€™s] well pled summary judgment motion, and when I read the motion, it was my first thought that I should grant the motion.Â  However, after reading the cause of action attacked, I realized the case can probably be tried upon a submission of the record to me without testimony, so I see no need to grant summary judgment when it will be almost as simple to hear the case on the merits, so the Motion for Summary Judgment is denied.\r\n\r\nGreenwood Development advances the following arguments on its appeal:Â  (1) the circuit court erred in failing to grant summary judgment because the bylaws placed the obligation to maintain the roads on Queenâ€™s Grant; (2) the circuit court erred in failing to grant summary judgment because under the 1981 Covenants Greenwood Development has no obligation to maintain the roads; and (3) Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s cause of action is barred by the statute of limitations and equitable estoppel.Â  These arguments are not properly before this court because the circuit court has yet to rule on them.\r\nWe do recognize that the bylaws (by incorporation of the Master Deed) place on Queenâ€™s Grant the duty to maintain â€œ[a]ll roadsâ€ within its regime.Â  We further recognize that under the 1972 Covenants and 1981 Covenants, Greenwood Development is responsible for maintaining â€œprivate streets (except those located within a privately owned lot).â€Â  In its Complaint, Queenâ€™s Grant uses the term â€œprivate streetâ€ to describe the road that was repaired.Â  As noted, we cannot determine the precise location of the â€œroadâ€ or â€œprivate streetâ€ which is the subject of Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s breach of contract action.Â  As urged by Greenwood Development, simply knowing the road is somewhere within the Queenâ€™s Grant regime may be dispositive.Â  We believe it best, however, to have the circuit court, in the first instance, address this issue and determine if the road or street in question falls under Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s duties under the Master Deed and bylaws or somehow is the responsibility of Greenwood Development under the applicable 1981 Covenants.Â  \r\nIn order for an issue to be properly preserved for appeal, it must have been both raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.Â  Elam v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp.,&nbsp;361 S.C. 9, 23-24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 779-780&nbsp;(2004).Â  Error preservation principles are intended to enable the trial court to rule after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and arguments.Â  Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498&nbsp;(Ct. App.Â  2004).Â  The rationale for the rule is that until the trial court considers the matter and makes a ruling, an appellate court is unable to find error.Â  Id.Â  Issue preservation rules are designed to give the trial court a fair opportunity to rule on the issues, and thus provide us with a platform for meaningful appellate review.\r\nThis case well illustrates the wisdom of the rule.Â  In the approximate 2700 page record of this case, not a single page can be found containing a transcript of any proceeding before the circuit court.Â  Nothing in the record indicates the precise location of the road involved in the $175 repair.Â  Moreover, while Greenwood Development asserts that Queenâ€™s Grant has assumed responsibility for maintaining this particular road, the circuit court purposely avoided addressing the substance of Greenwood Developmentâ€™s arguments.Â Â  The appealed order clearly was not intended to be a final ruling on any of the issues Greenwood Development raises.Â  The circuit court denied Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion only for reasons of judicial economy, finding that a trial upon a submission of record would be the most efficient resolution.Â  What Greenwood Development is asking this court to do is serve as a trial court in finding facts based upon the record as submitted.Â  That, we decline to do. \r\nWe dismiss Greenwood Developmentâ€™s appeal from the denial of its summary judgment motion and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Â Denial of Motion for Attorney Fees and Costs \r\n\r\nGreenwood Developmentâ€™s final argument on appeal is that the circuit court erred in refusing to award it attorney fees and costs. Construing the relevant language in the 1981 Covenants, the circuit court found that Queenâ€™s Grant did not violate the covenants by bringing its action.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œThe general rule is that attorneyâ€™s fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.â€Â  Seabrook Island Prop. Ownersâ€™ Assoc. v. Berger,&nbsp;365 S.C. 234, 238, 616 S.E.2d 431, 434&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005).Â  Greenwood Development relies solely on Section 7-10 of the 1981 Covenants to support its claim for attorney fees and costs.Â  That provision provides: \r\n\r\nEnforcement.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Greenwood shall have the right, but shall not be obligated, to proceed at law or in equity to complete compliance to the terms of this Agreement or to prevent violation or breach in any event.Â  Violators shall be personally obligated to reimburse Greenwood in full for all its direct and indirect costs, including, but not limited to, legal fees incurred by Greenwood in maintaining compliance with this declaration, and such obligation shall constitute a lien upon the violatorâ€™s property in accordance with Section 8-8.\r\n\r\nThe question presented is whether Queenâ€™s Grant may be considered a â€œviolatorâ€ in filing and pursuing its Complaint, primarily seeking prospective declaratory relief.\r\nGreenwood Development contends that Queenâ€™s Grant is a â€œviolatorâ€ by seeking a declaratory judgment that its co-owners should be assessed under the 1972 Covenants, rather than the 1981 Covenants, and further seeking reimbursement of alleged past overages.Â  â€œViolatorâ€ is not a defined term in the 1981 Covenants.Â  Greenwood Development asserts that by bringing a legal action, Queenâ€™s Grant has â€œflown in the face ofâ€ the 1981 Covenants.Â  â€œViolationâ€ has been defined, in relevant part, as â€œ1. An infraction or breach of the law; a transgression. . . . 2. The act of breaking or dishonoring the law; a contravention of a right or duty.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary (8th ed. 2004).Â  \r\nIn interpreting restrictive covenants, ambiguities must be strictly construed against the party seeking to enforce them.Â  Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C. 266, 270, 363 S.E.2d 891, 893-94 (1987); Seabrook Island Prop. Owners Assoc. v. Marshland Trust, Inc., 358 S.C. 655, 662, 596 S.E.2d 380, 383 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The rule of strict construction governing restrictive covenants, however, does not preclude their enforcement, for the rule should not be applied so as to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the instrument. Â Hamilton v. CCM, Inc.,&nbsp;274 S.C. 152, 158, 263 S.E.2d 378, 381&nbsp;(1980); Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 76, 202 S.E.2d 363, 366 (1974); Palmetto Dunes Resort, a Div. Of Greenwood Dev. Corp. v. Brown, 287 S.C. 1, 6, 336 S.E.2d 15, 18-19 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  Greenwood Development cannot point to any specific provision of the 1981 Covenants that Queenâ€™s Grant has violated.Â  By its terms, the covenant authorizes Greenwood Development to bring legal action to enforce the terms of the agreement, and to be awarded legal fees for â€œmaintaining complianceâ€ with the covenants.Â  We decline Greenwood Developmentâ€™s invitation that we sanction an award of attorney fees and costs under the isolated phrase â€œmaintaining compliance.â€Â  This phrase must be examined in the context of the entire provision and the rule of construction that any ambiguity must be strictly construed against the party seeking enforcement.Â  The provision allows for the recovery of attorney fees only against â€œviolatorsâ€ of the covenants.Â  Because Queenâ€™s Grant may not be fairly characterized as a â€œviolatorâ€ of the covenants, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s denial of Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion for attorney fees.Â  Accord Schneider v. Drake, 44 P.3d 256, 262 (Colo. Ct. App. 2001) (finding a declaratory judgment action alone insufficient to constitute a violation of the applicable covenants).[21]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe increased assessments under the 1981 Covenants are valid and enforceable as to applicable units in the Queenâ€™s Grant II Horizontal Property Regime, and the order of the circuit court granting Greenwood Development summary judgment as to Queenâ€™s Grant claim for declaratory relief is affirmed in result in part.Â  The grant of summary judgment is reversed in part, and the matter is remanded, as relates to the five units that are subject only to Waiver Agreements that do not expressly reference the 1981 Covenants.Â  We dismiss as interlocutory Greenwood Developmentâ€™s appeal from the denial of summary judgment as to its breach of contract action concerning the road repair invoice and remand the matter to the circuit court.Â  We affirm the denial of Greenwood Developmentâ€™s motion for attorney fees and costs. \r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, DISMISSED IN PART, AND REMANDED. \r\nSTILWELL and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Judge Thomas Kemmerlin presided over all motions except Greenwood Developmentâ€™s request for attorney fees and costs.Â  On Judge Kemmerlinâ€™s retirement, Judge Curtis L. Coltrane was assigned to hear the motion for fees and costs.\r\n[2] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The document containing the 1972 Covenants is entitled â€œDECLARATION OF RIGHTS, RESTRICTIONS, CONDITIONS, ETC., WHICH CONSTITUTE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH CERTAIN LANDS OF PALMETTO DUNES RESORT, INC.â€Â Â Â Â  It was recorded on September 13, 1972, in the office of Register of Deeds for Beaufort County in Deed Book 201 at page 1522.Â  We refer to this document as the Declaration of Covenants or the 1972 Covenants. \r\n[3] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Master Deed was recorded on June 24, 1974, in the office of Register of Deeds for Beaufort County in Deed Book 221 at page 1327.\r\n[4] Â Â Â Â Â Â  In a prior action involving these (and other) parties, the Queenâ€™s Grant regimes brought suit for construction defects in common elements of the regimes.Â  The trial court dismissed the action, finding the regimes lacked standing.Â  The supreme court reversed and found the regimes had standing, noting that the master deeds and bylaws imposed on the regimes the duty of maintaining the common elements.Â  Queenâ€™s Grant Villas Horizontal Prop. Regimes I-IV v. Daniel Intâ€™l Corp., 286 S.C. 555, 556, 335 S.E.2d 365, 366 (1985) (â€œA property regime has standing to bring an action for construction defects in common elements that the regime has the duty to maintain.â€).\r\n[5] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The Board, per the bylaws, had to be composed entirely of unit owners within the regime once all apartments were conveyed.Â  The last unit within Queenâ€™s Grant was sold in 1977.\r\n[6] Â Â Â Â Â Â  The document containing the 1981 Covenants is entitled â€œDECLARATION OF RIGHTS, RESTRICTIONS, CONDITIONS, ETC., WHICH CONSTITUTE COVENANTS RUNNING WITH CERTAIN LANDS WITHIN PALMETTO DUNES RESORT.â€Â  The document is subtitled, â€œCONSOLIDATED MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL COVENANTS OF GREENWOOD DEVELOPMENT CORPORATION.â€Â  It was recorded on January 19, 1981, in the office of Register of Deeds for Beaufort County in Deed Book 314 at page 505.Â  We refer to this document as the 1981 Covenants. \r\n[7] Â Â Â Â Â Â  We recognize that the Limited Covenants, recorded in 1982, apply only to single-family residential units and thus are inapplicable to the present dispute.Â  It appears Queenâ€™s Grant initially challenged the 1982 Covenants, confusing them with the 1981 Covenants.Â  \r\n[8] Â Â Â Â Â Â  This street is located in the Queenâ€™s Grant regime, but we are unable to determine its precise location from the record.Â  \r\n[9] Â Â Â Â Â Â  Queenâ€™s Grant asserts that it withdrew its cause of action for a refund of allegedly excessive assessments under the 1981 Covenants before the circuit court issued its ruling. There is nothing in the record to support this assertion.Â Â Â  Queenâ€™s Grant continued to oppose the dismissal of this cause of action, even after the circuit court granted summary judgment.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s ruling as to the assessment refund is the law of the case.Â  Â \r\n[10] Â Â Â Â Â  Covenants that require property owners to pay to a developer or homeownersâ€™ association assessments that have a beneficial effect on the value of the ownersâ€™ properties touch and concern land and therefore â€œrun with the land.â€Â  Harbison Cmty. Assoc., Inc. v. Mueller,&nbsp;319 S.C. 99, 102, 459 S.E.2d 860, 862&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  It is undisputed that the assessments under the respective covenants to fund Greenwood Developmentâ€™s maintenance obligations of Palmetto Dunes â€œrun with the land.â€Â Â  Â Â Â  \r\n[11] Â Â Â Â Â  The circuit courtâ€™s discussion regarding the statute of limitations applies only to the claim for a refund of assessments, which was asserted as an action at law seeking damages.Â  \r\n[12] Â Â Â Â Â  In the area of condominium and property regime law, Florida case law is cited approvingly in jurisdictions throughout the country.Â  Indeed, when faced with unresolved questions in horizontal property law, courts often look to Florida law.Â  See Douglas Scott MacGregor, South Carolina Condominium Law Â§ 1.01 (William S. Jula ed. 1986) (â€œFlorida is the undisputed leader in the development of condominium law, and its cases are frequently cited in other states and are generally considered to have persuasive value.â€).Â  Queenâ€™s Grant does not challenge the general right of Greenwood Development to amend the 1972 Covenants; Queenâ€™s Grantâ€™s challenge in this regard is limited to the claim that the 1981 amendments are ineffective as to its co-owners because the last Queenâ€™s Grant unit was sold in 1977.\r\n[13] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  The term â€œdeclarantâ€ is often used in documents related to restrictive covenants and the creation of horizontal property regimes, as well as the corresponding rights and responsibilities of an owner-developer. In the context of horizontal property law, a declarant is â€œa grantor that establishes or joins in the creation of a declaration of condominium.â€Â  15A Am. Jur. 2d Condominiums Â§ 1 (2005). \r\n[14] Â Â Â Â Â  We note that the Horizontal Property Act may not be controlling here (at least not exclusively) because Greenwood Developmentâ€™s maintenance obligations under the 1972 Covenants and 1981 Covenants do not relate to the regime property of Queenâ€™s Grant; as noted, these obligations relate to resort property outside of the Queenâ€™s Grant regime.Â  Because the covenants concern responsibility for maintenance of resort property beyond the Queenâ€™s Grant regime, Greenwood Development is akin to a â€œmaster associationâ€ and is not subject to the Horizontal Property Act with regard to such property.Â  See Scott v. Sandestin Corp., 491 So. 2d 334 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1986).Â  Courts in other jurisdictions have recognized that assessments by master associations for maintenance of property outside the regime are separate from assessments by the condominium association for maintenance of its own common elements.Â  Hobson v. Hilltop Place Cmty. Assoc., 453 A.2d 841, 842 (N.H. 1982).Â  \r\n[15] Â Â Â Â Â  Cf. Heritage Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n v. Eagle Lake &amp; Golf Condos., 318 S.C. 535, 541, 458 S.E.2d 561, 565 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding a regime developer has the authority to amend the master deed without the consent of property owners so long as the developer specifically reserves that right in the master deed).\r\n[16] Â Â Â Â Â  The 1972 Covenants contain the same provision.\r\n[17] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At common law, a â€œcovenantâ€ generally referred to a contract under seal.Â  20 Am. Jur. 2d Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions Â§ 2 (2005).Â  In South Carolina, some distinctions between contracts under seal and other contracts remain, such as the rule that a covenant under seal may not be set aside for lack of consideration in the absence of fraud.Â  Id.; Jackson v. Walters,&nbsp;246 S.C. 486, 493, 144 S.E.2d 422, 425&nbsp;(1965). \r\n[18] Â Â Â Â Â  The common law rule is as follows:Â  â€œNo interest is good unless it must vest, if at all, no later than twenty-one years after some life in being at the creation of the interest.â€Â  Abrams v. Templeton,&nbsp;320 S.C. 325, 327, 465 S.E.2d 117, 119&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1995).Â  \r\n[19] Â Â Â Â Â  Greenwood Development has consistently assessed the fourteen remaining units at the lower rate included in the 1972 Covenants.Â  \r\n[20] Â Â Â Â Â  Edge v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 511, 517, 623 S.E.2d 387, 390 (2005)&nbsp;(entertaining a discretionary appeal of a motion to dismiss in the interest of judicial economy because a related issue in a cross-appeal was properly before the court); Brown v. County of Berkeley, 366 S.C. 354, 362 n.5, 622 S.E.2d 533, 538 n.5 (2005) (holding that interlocutory orders may be considered on appeal when they are companion to reviewable issues, but finding the motions to dismiss unreviewable because they lacked a sufficient â€œnexus or companionshipâ€ to justify the exercise of immediate appellate review); Morris v. Anderson County, 349 S.C. 607, 610-11, 564 S.E.2d 649, 651 (2002) (holding that the appellate court may, as a matter of discretion, consider an unappealable order along with an appealable issue where such a ruling will avoid unnecessary litigation, but declining to address the appeal based on concerns of creating an impermissible advisory ruling); Pitts v. Jackson Natâ€™l Life Ins. Co.,&nbsp;352 S.C. 319, 338, 574 S.E.2d 502, 511-12&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002) (entertaining an appeal from a denial of summary judgment because it was so closely connected with other issues properly before the court).Â  \r\n[21] Â Â Â Â Â  We do not reach the underlying question of whether the attorney fee provision is enforceable at all.Â  There is no attorney fee provision in the 1972 Declaration of Covenants.Â  The provision was added in 1981 presumably pursuant to Greenwood Developmentâ€™s rights as Declarant to impose additional covenants running with the land â€œwithin the multi-family residential areas in Palmetto Dunes.â€Â  Because Queenâ€™s Grant is not a â€œviolatorâ€ and Greenwood Development is thus not entitled to an award of attorney fees, we need not decide whether a declarant may unilaterally impose a one-sided attorney fee provision under the guise of a covenant running with the land.Â  Cf.Â  Harbison Cmty. Assoc., Inc. v. Mueller,&nbsp;319 S.C. 99, 102, 459 S.E.2d 860, 862&nbsp;(Ct.

H. Teer, &amp; Robert C. Childs, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.:Â  Audrey Merritt appeals a master-in-equityâ€™s decision holding that Cody Discount, Inc. was entitled to evict her from its real property following her default on an installment land contract.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 27, 1987, Audrey Merritt entered into an installment land contract with Martin and Wilma Baker to purchase a manufactured home and a 100 x 170 foot lot for $44,500.Â  The Bakers informed Merritt that she did not need to file the contract until the property was paid for in full.Â  The contract contained clauses that made the purchase contingent on payments of $450 dollars a month and maintenance of credit life insurance on the premises.Â  The contract further stated that failure to comply with these conditions would entitle the seller to repossess the premises and retain all payments as rent.Â  \r\nMerritt testified the Bakers later informed her the insurance provision would be satisfied as long as she maintained insurance on the premises themselves.Â  Accordingly, she never purchased the credit life policy called for in the contract.Â  She also submitted payments after they were due on several occasions, but the Bakers always accepted the payments and never declared the contract in default.Â  Although she was behind on payments to the Bakers, all past due amounts were satisfied when the Bakers later sold the property to Riley and Doris Jones in May 1989.\r\nAfter the Joneses purchased the property, Merritt continued making payments of $450 a month.Â  Merritt admitted she also made late payments from time to time to the Joneses, but, as with the Bakers, the Joneses always accepted the payments and never declared her in default.Â  Cody Discount later purchased the property through a bond for title from Mr. Jones in March 2000.Â  However, the property was not actually in Cody Discountâ€™s name until Cody took out a mortgage to pay for the property in May 2002.Â  \r\nFrom March 2000 until January 2002, Ms. Merritt continued to make her payments to Mr. Jones who would, in turn, endorse them over to Cody Discount.Â  In January 2002, Merritt made her last payment to Mr. Jones.Â  At this time, she and Mr. Jones were in negotiations about a payoff amount.Â  Merritt testified that she was going to pay off the house with settlement money stemming from her first husbandâ€™s death.Â  \r\nShortly after Cody Discount acquired title to the property, it brought an action in magistrateâ€™s court to have Merritt evicted from her property based on her payment history.Â  Soon after the hearing, Janet Cody, as President of Cody Discount, sent Merritt a letter stating that as of October 15, 2002, Merritt had an outstanding balance of $793.17.Â  The letter further explained that interest would continue to accrue and a late fee of $20 would be added each pay period until the balance was paid in full.\r\nOn December 20, 2002, Merritt sent a response to Cody Discount via certified mail expressing her desire to pay the balance and tendering a check for $833.17.Â  Although Janet Cody received the letter, the check was never cashed because Cody Discount alleged Merritt owed more than she tendered.Â  It is somewhat unclear exactly how much Cody Discount alleges Merritt still owes as there are several different amounts appearing in the record.Â  For instance, there is the previously mentioned letter drafted by Janet Cody which states a balance of $737.17, Cody Discountâ€™s complaint, which states Merritt was delinquent in the amount $793.17 but owed $1,247 dollars in late fees ($2040.17), while at trial it appears Cody Discount was trying to evict Merritt for owing $2,873.[1] \r\nIn addition to Merrittâ€™s late payments, Cody Discount argued before the master that it would be impossible for it to convey the property to Merritt as intended in the original contract.Â  This claim of impossibility arises from a series of ordinances passed by Greenville County in 2000, which prevent mobile homes from having direct access to a public street or highway and require them to have access via an interior roadway.Â  Although Merritt has always accessed the property over the same drive and Cody Discount was aware of her contract to purchase the mobile home and lot when they entered into the bond for title with Mr. Jones, Janet Cody stated that she never thought about having to deed her a right of way to use the drive.Â  Through her testimony, Janet Cody made it clear that she did not want to grant Merritt an easement down the existing road because it would â€œruin the value of our property.â€[2]Â  Cody did state that she would be willing to grant Merritt an easement around the property, but Merritt would have to construct a road because none currently exists in that location.\r\nOn October 26, 2004, the master-in-equity issued an order ruling partially in each partyâ€™s favor.Â  Although the master found Merritt defaulted in making payments to each of the owners, he also noted that Merritt had almost paid the entire original balance on the contract.Â  The master went on to rule that forfeiture of the mobile home should be relieved, but forfeiture of the lot should be granted based on the previously mentioned defaults and the fact that Cody Discount could not deed the lot to Merritt without granting her additional interests that would significantly affect its propertyâ€™s value.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nActions to foreclose or cancel an instrument are actions in equity.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 324 S.C. 570, 576, 479 S.E.2d 510, 513 (1996) (citations omitted). In an action in equity, while this Court is free to take its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, this does not require us to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and, accordingly, was in a better position to judge their credibility.Â  Donnan v. Mariner, 339 S.C. 621, 626, 529 S.E.2d 754, 757 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Merritt argues the master-in-equity erred in holding that â€œit was fair and equitable that [her] right in the real property should be forfeited and further, that any forfeiture should not be relieved.â€Â  We agree.\r\nThe courts of South Carolina have long held that forfeitures or penalties are not favored in either law or equity.Â  Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 172, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363 (2002); Ducworth v. Neely, 319 S.C. 158, 162, 459 S.E.2d 896, 899 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Litchfield Co. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Kiriakides, 290 S.C. 220, 349 S.E.2d 344 (Ct. App. 1986); Alexander v. Herndon, 84 S.C. 181, 65 S.E.2d 1048 (1909).Â  Concomitantly, â€œa provision in an installment land contract declaring forfeiture in the event of purchaser default can, in particular circumstances, constitute a penalty.â€Â  Lewis, 351 S.C. at 172, 568 S.E.2d at 364.\r\nIn Lewis, our supreme court held that in certain contractual instances where a stipulated sum (in the event of default) constitutes a penalty, â€œit would be inequitable to enforce the forfeiture provision without first allowing the purchaser an opportunity to redeem the installment contract by paying the entire purchase price.â€Â  Id.Â  As noted in the masterâ€™s order, there are a number of case-specific factors to consider in making such a determination.Â  These factors include the amount of equity the purchaser has accumulated, the length and number of defaults, the amount of forfeiture, the speed in which equity is sought, and the amount of money the purchaser would forfeit in relation to the purchase price of the property.Â  Id. at 174, n.5, 568 S.E.2d at 364, n.5.\r\nPresumably based in part on these factors, the master-in-equity found that Cody Discountâ€™s right to obtain ownership of Merrittâ€™s home should be relieved, but that its right to repossess the land should not be relieved.Â  While we agree with the master as to the mobile home, after a review of the record we find the master should have granted Merritt the right to redeem the installment contract by paying the remainder of the purchase price.Â  While Cody Discount makes much of the fact that granting Merritt an easement across the preexisting road, as her only means of access to the property, would â€œsignificantlyâ€ affect the value of its property, there is no evidence in the record to quantify such a claim.\r\nAlthough it is true that Merritt has made late payments on and off since the inception of the land sale contract, it is also true that all of the property owners, including Cody Discount, continued to accept the payments without declaring her in default.Â  It was only when Merritt was within approximately $1,000 of paying off an original contract price of $44,500 that Cody Discount decided it would no longer be advantageous for them to transfer the property and thus they brought the current action.\r\nAs such, we affirm the masterâ€™s decision as to the mobile home, reverse as to forfeiture of the lot, and remand for a determination of the amount Merritt owes to redeem the property. \r\nAFFIRMED in part, REVERSED in part, and REMANDED. [3]\r\nBEATTY, SHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Janet Cody attributed the incorrect balances to miscalculations based on a faulty amortization schedule.Â  \r\n[2] The existing road runs though the middle of the approximately 10-acre parcel Cody Discount purchased from the Joneses.Â  Although Janet Cody on more than one occasion suggested that granting Merritt an easement would devalue her property, no evidence was presented to quantify the alleged decrease in value. \r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4103","title":"Arthur v.

Bridges, Jr. and Amy Anderson Wise, of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n BEATTY, J.:Â  In this medical malpractice action, Ellis Arthur and Barbara Arthur (Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order, arguing the court erred in:Â  (1) failing to set aside a scheduling order; (2) limiting discovery; (3) denying their Batson motion; and (4) excluding certain witnesses at trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 8 1995, Ellis Arthur visited the Sexton Dental Clinic with a toothache. Â Dr. Sojourner examined Arthur and extracted Arthurâ€™s tooth. Arthur returned to the Sexton Dental Clinic on May 10, 1995, because he continued to experience pain.Â  Dr. Hester examined Arthur, did not see any problems, and sent Arthur home. Â Arthur began to experience trismus,[2] and therefore returned to the Sexton Dental Clinic once again on May 12, 1995. Â Dr. Sojourner examined Arthur, discovered an infection, and prescribed antibiotics. Â Arthur was hospitalized on May 16 for the infection and remained hospitalized for approximately two weeks. Â Arthur continues to suffer from pain in his throat and jaw. Â In addition, he has trouble swallowing food, and cannot speak clearly.Â  \r\nOn April 30, 1998, Arthur and his wife filed this action against the Sexton Dental Clinic, Dr. Eagerton,[3] and some associates (Respondents) for medical malpractice. Â Shortly after answering the Appellantsâ€™ complaint, Respondentsâ€™ counsel served Appellants with interrogatories and requests for the production of documents.Â  When responses were not completed in a timely manner, Respondents moved to compel Appellants to answer the discovery. Â After a hearing, Circuit Court Judge Sidney Floyd granted the motion and ordered Appellants to respond within sixty days and to specifically address information regarding their expert witnesses.\r\nOn July 26, 2000, Respondents retained new counsel.Â  The new counsel soon became concerned regarding the limited amount of discovery that had been completed in the two years since the case was filed.Â  As a result, counsel forwarded a proposed scheduling order to Circuit Court Judge James E. Brogdon, Jr., the Chief Administrative Judge, on November 9, 2000. Â Counsel also forwarded a copy of the proposed scheduling order to Appellantsâ€™ counsel. Â A few days later, Judge Brogdonâ€™s law clerk called Appellantsâ€™ counsel to discuss the proposed scheduling order and left a voicemail message concerning the order. Â In addition, Respondentsâ€™ counsel mailed Appellantsâ€™ counsel a letter inquiring whether Appellants would agree to the proposed scheduling order and stating that if Appellants did not consent, Judge Brogdon would schedule a conference to discuss the matter. Â After receiving no response from Appellantsâ€™ counsel, Judge Brogdon signed the scheduling order on December 19, 2000. Â The order, which was filed on January 4, 2001, limited discovery to forty-five days.\r\nOn September 19, 2001, Circuit Court Judge J. Michael Baxley held a hearing concerning the partiesâ€™ pending motions. Â The motions included the following: Â (1) Respondentsâ€™ motion to compel discovery; (2) Respondentsâ€™ motions for summary judgment; (3) Appellantsâ€™ motion to set aside the scheduling order; (4) Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend the pleadings to include additional doctors; and (5) Appellantsâ€™ motion to compel the depositions of certain witnesses. Â At the beginning of the hearing, Judge Baxley notified the parties that he planned to defer Appellantsâ€™ motion to set aside the scheduling order to Judge Brogdon.Â  Judge Baxley stated â€œI am not the chief administrative judgeâ€ and â€œIâ€™m going to defer to him and Iâ€™ll let you go back in the back and have a telephone conference with Judge Brogdon.â€ Â Appellants objected, arguing the â€œscheduling order is a matter that needs to be heard and ruled on by the Court because . . . the other motions . . . fall from that.â€ Â Judge Baxley refused to hear the scheduling order motion. Â However, he heard Respondentsâ€™ motions and Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend the pleadings.Â  He deferred Appellantsâ€™ motion to compel depositions until Judge Brogdon ruled on the scheduling order motion. \r\nPrior to the telephone conference with Judge Brogdon, Judge Baxley denied Respondentsâ€™ motion for summary judgment. Â Judge Baxley, however, granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to compel discovery and ordered Appellants to produce dental records, prescription records, tax returns, and an itemized statement of damages within ten days. Â In addition, Judge Baxley denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to amend the pleadings stating, â€œ[i]t would be significantly prejudicial to these new parties and to the existing defendants to allow this amendment at this very late hour.â€ \r\nDuring the telephone conference, Judge Brogdon denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to set aside the scheduling order. Â After the telephone conference, Judge Baxley resumed the proceeding and heard Appellantsâ€™ motion to compel the deposition of certain witnesses.Â  Because the witnesses were not properly identified prior to the end of discovery as provided in the scheduling order, Judge Baxley denied this motion. Â Appellants were, however, permitted to depose Dr. Eagerton. \r\nOn January 14, 2002, Judge Brogdon presided over the jury trial in the case. Â During jury selection, Appellants challenged two of Respondentsâ€™ peremptory strikes based on Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).Â  Judge Brogdon held a Batson hearing and ruled the strikes were proper given there was no showing of pretext. \r\nAfter the Batson hearing, Appellantsâ€™ counsel renewed his motions.Â  Judge Brogdon considered these motions as well as Respondentsâ€™ pre-trial motions, which included:Â  (1) Respondentsâ€™ motion seeking to exclude certain evidence due to Appellantsâ€™ failure to comply with discovery within the ten-day time frame set forth in Judge Baxleyâ€™s order; and (2) Respondentsâ€™ motion to exclude the testimony of Appellantsâ€™ witnesses, Dr. Fish, Dr. Graham, and Dr. Chewning.Â  Judge Brogdon granted Respondentsâ€™ motion and, as a consequence, excluded evidence Appellants failed to timely produce. Specifically, Judge Brogdon excluded the testimony of Drs. Fish, Graham, and Chewning. \r\nUltimately, the jury rendered a verdict in favor of Respondents.Â  Judge Brogdon denied Appellantsâ€™ post-trial motions. Â This appeal followed. Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Discovery\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in issuing the scheduling order outside the presence of Appellantsâ€™ counsel.Â  In the alternative, Appellants assert the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the scheduling order and declining to extend the time for discovery.[4] Â We disagree.\r\nâ€œThe trial courtâ€™s rulings on discovery matters will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.â€ Belk of Spartanburg, S.C., Inc. v. Thompson, 337 S.C. 109, 126-27, 522 S.E.2d 357, 366&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€ Clark v. Cantrell,&nbsp;339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539&nbsp;(2000).\r\nUnder certain conditions, the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure permit trial courts to issue scheduling orders for discovery.Â  Rule 16(a)(5) provides that upon motion of the parties, the court â€œmay in its discretion or upon motion of any party direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before itâ€ for a pre-trial hearing to consider the limitation of time allowed for discovery.Â  In addition, Rule 26(f) provides the following: \r\n\r\n[T]he court may direct the attorneys for the parties to appear before it for a conference on the subject of discovery.Â  The court shall do so upon motion by the attorneys for any party if the motion includes: (1) A statement of the issues as they then appear; (2) A proposed plan and schedule of discovery; (3) Any limitations proposed to be placed on discovery; (4) Any other proposed orders with respect to discovery; and (5) A statement showing that the attorney making the motion has made a reasonable effort to reach agreement with opposing attorneys on the matters set forth in the motion.\r\n\r\nRule 26(f), SCRCP.Â  The court may combine a pre-trial hearing, authorized by Rule 16, and a discovery conference, authorized by Rule 26(f).Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, Respondentsâ€™ counsel forwarded a proposed scheduling order to Judge Brogdon on November 9, 2000, along with a brief letter explaining his concerns regarding the limited amount of discovery that had been completed.[5]Â  After unsuccessfully attempting to contact Appellantsâ€™ counsel, Judge Brogdon signed the scheduling order on December 19, 2000, and filed it on January 4, 2001.Â Â  Although Judge Brogdon did not hold a discovery conference or a pre-trial hearing, we find no reversible error.Â  \r\nInitially, we reject Appellantsâ€™ contention that Judge Brogdon was required to hold a hearing on the issuance of the scheduling order.Â  Our review of the above-cited rules of civil procedure reveals that the decision of whether to conduct a hearing is a matter left to the discretion of the trial judge.Â  This interpretation of the rules is supported by analysis of Rule 16 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, a rule that is similar to our state court rule.Â  Rule 16, SCRCP editorâ€™s note (â€œThis Rule 16 is similar to the Federal Ruleâ€ with limited exceptions.).Â  Specifically, secondary authority has stated that a scheduling conference is not mandatory and the issuance of a scheduling order does not require formal communication.Â  See 6A Charles Alan Wright &amp; Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure Â§ 1522.1 (2d ed. Supp. 2005) (analyzing Rule 16, FRCP, and stating, â€œA scheduling conference may be requested by the judge or the parties, but it is not mandatory.Â  Indeed, Rule 16(b) specifically provides that if the request for a conference is not made within 120 days after the action is filed, the scheduling order will be issued without a conference, although after some communication with the parties. Â That communication may be very informal.Â  As explained in the Advisory Committee Note, the scheduling order may be issued after consultation with the parties by telephone or mail, rather than in person.â€).Â  \r\nFurthermore, within the context of this procedure, Appellantsâ€™ counsel was given sufficient time to object to the proposed scheduling order and request a hearing before the order was issued.Â  Nearly two months elapsed between the time the proposed order was submitted and when it was filed.Â  Despite this time period, Appellantsâ€™ counsel admitted at oral argument that he did not respond to the circuit courtâ€™s inquiry regarding the order.Â  \r\nBased on the specific facts of this case, we find Judge Brogdon did not abuse his discretion in issuing the scheduling order without a hearing.Â  Because we conclude Judge Brogdon properly issued the scheduling order, we also agree with his decision declining to set aside the order.Â  Furthermore, we find Judge Baxley properly deferred this decision to Judge Brogdon.Â  See Enoree Baptist Church v. Fletcher, 287 S.C. 602, 604, 340 S.E.2d 546, 547 (1986) (â€œOne circuit court judge does not have the authority to set aside the order of another.â€).\r\nIn conjunction, we agree with Judge Baxleyâ€™s decision declining to extend the time for discovery beyond that which was set in the scheduling order.Â  Appellants brought this action against Respondents in April of 1998.Â  The scheduling order, filed on January 4, 2001, gave the parties until February 19, 2001, an additional forty-five days to complete discovery.Â  In view of this extensive time frame for discovery, we cannot discern nor can Appellants explain how they were prejudiced or that a â€œmanifest injusticeâ€ was created by the judgeâ€™s decision to limit the time for discovery given the case had been pending for nearly three years.Â  Accordingly, we find Judge Baxley did not abuse his discretion regarding the rulings on discovery.\r\nII.Â  Batson Motion\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in allowing Respondents to exercise preemptory strikes which excluded all African-American males from the jury in violation of Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986). Â We disagree.\r\nThe trial court must conduct a Batson hearing when members of a racial or gender group are struck and the opposing party requests a hearing.Â  State v. Haigler, 334 S.C. 623, 629, 515 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1999).Â  During the hearing, the proponent of the strikes must present racially- neutral explanations. Id.; State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996).Â  â€œUnless a discriminatory intent is inherent in the proponentâ€™s explanation, the reason offered will be deemed race-neutral.â€ Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 55, 495 S.E.2d 205, 207 (1998).Â  The burden then shifts to the party challenging the strikes to show the explanations were merely pretextual.Â  Haigler, 334 S.C. at 629, 515 S.E.2d at 91; Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.Â  Our supreme court has explained:\r\n\r\nPretext generally will be established by showing that similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury. Under some circumstances, the race-neutral explanation given by the proponent may be so fundamentally implausible that the judge may determine, at the third step of the analysis, that the explanation was mere pretext even without a showing of disparate treatment.\r\n\r\nÂ Payton, 329 S.C. at 55, 495 S.E.2d at 208.Â  \r\nThe opponent of the strike carries the ultimate burden of persuading the trial court the challenged party exercised strikes in a discriminatory manner.Â  Adams, 322 S.C. at 124, 470 S.E.2d at 372.Â  Whether a Batson violation has occurred must be determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, and appellate courts review the trial courtâ€™s ruling with a clearly erroneous standard.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 615, 545 S.E.2d 805, 810 (2001).\r\nIn this case, Respondents struck three Caucasians and three African-Americans from the jury. Â Appellants challenged two of the strikes pursuant to Batson.Â  The trial judge conducted a Batson hearing.Â  During the hearing, Respondents offered race-neutral reasons for the strikes.Â  Respondents struck one potential juror due to the residential area where he lived.Â  Specifically, Respondents stated the potential juror appeared to live in the same general area as the Appellants and also seemed to be close in age to the Appellants. Â In addition, Respondents noted the potential juror wore an â€œunusual piece of jewelry around his neck.â€ Â Respondents struck the second potential juror because he was a minister. Â Respondentsâ€™ counsel explained: â€œI look at pastors or preachers or reverends very carefully because . . . [they] are inclined to award money maybe under the theory of the milk of human kindness.â€ Â The trial judge found both strikes were proper and found no showing of pretext on either strike.Â  \r\nWe agree with the trial judge that the reasons Respondents offered to explain the strikes were facially race-neutral. See State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 502, 593 S.E.2d 486, 489 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. granted (Mar. 3, 2005)(recognizing that â€œ[o]ur courts, as well as other jurisdictions, have consistently found a prospective jurorâ€™s demeanor and appearance as nondiscriminatory reasons for exercising a peremptory challenge of the jurorâ€); see also State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 59, 65, 512 S.E.2d 500, 504 (1999) (finding place or type of employment may be race-neutral reason for strike). \r\nThus, the burden shifted back to Appellants to prove pretext.Â  Appellants did not show that similarly situated Caucasians were seated on the jury nor did Appellants offer any evidence showing Respondentsâ€™ explanations were fundamentally implausible.Â  Instead, Appellants simply disagreed with the legitimacy of Respondentsâ€™ explanations.Â  Thus, Appellants failed to meet their burden.[6]Â  \r\nIII.Â  Exclusion of Witnesses\r\nAppellants argue the trial judge erred in excluding their expert, Dr. Fish, and their witnesses, Dr. Chewning and Dr. Graham, from trial.[7]Â  Appellants contend the court failed to consider the factors set forth in Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 S.C. 142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001), before excluding their witnesses. Â We disagree. \r\nAs a threshold matter, it is undisputed that Appellants failed to specifically name the above-listed witnesses in their answer to Respondentsâ€™ interrogatories within the time limits established by the scheduling order. Â Given Appellants failure to strictly comply with the scheduling order, the trial judge had the discretionary authority to impose the appropriate sanction if any was warranted.Â  Thus, the question becomes whether the judge abused his discretion in excluding Appellantsâ€™ three witnesses.Â  See Laney v. Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 58, 202 S.E.2d 12, 14 (1974) (applying former Circuit Court Rule 90 governing interrogatories and finding that â€œwhat sanctions, if any, are to be imposed where there is a failure to fully comply with the ruleâ€ is left largely to the discretion of the trial judge); Dunn v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 307 S.C. 426, 432, 415 S.E.2d 590, 593 (Ct. App. 1992), revâ€™d on other grounds, 311 S.C. 43, 426 S.E.2d 756 (1993) (stating â€œ[t]he decision of whether or not to allow a witness to testify who was not previously listed on answers to interrogatories rests within the sound discretion of the trial judgeâ€); see also Callen v. Callen, 365 S.C. 618, 627, 620 S.E.2d 59, 64 (2005) (finding family court failed to exercise discretion in ruling on defendantâ€™s motion to exclude plaintiffâ€™s witness where court failed to make appropriate inquiry).\r\nIn Jumper, this court specifically addressed the authority of a trial judge to exclude the testimony of an expert witness.Â  We held a trial judge is required to consider and evaluate the following factors prior to excluding a witness:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        (1)&nbsp;\r\n         the type of witness involved;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the content of the evidence emanating from the proffered witness;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to furnish the witnessâ€™ name;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the degree of surprise to the other party, including the prior knowledge of the name of the witness; and\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         the prejudice to the opposing party.Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nJumper, 348 S.C. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916. \r\nAlthough we recognize that the trial judge excluded the testimony of Dr. Fish, Dr. Chewning, and Dr. Graham without specifically enunciating the Jumper factors, we believe his failure to do so is not sufficient to constitute reversible error.Â  Based on our review of the record, we find the judge considered the requisite factors and made the appropriate inquiry before ultimately excluding the challenged witnesses.Â Â  \r\nInitially, we note Respondentsâ€™ counsel prefaced his argument concerning his motion in limine by directing the judgeâ€™s attention to Jumper.Â  Furthermore, in the course of the extensive discussion on this motion the judge either heard through arguments of counsel or elicited information sufficient to satisfy each Jumper factor.\r\nIn terms of Dr. Fish, the judge was aware that Appellants sought to call him as an expert witness.Â  The judge was also apprised of Dr. Fishâ€™s testimony.Â  Appellantsâ€™ counsel explained that he intended to call Dr. Fish in response to the contradictory information the Respondents elicited in their deposition of Appellantsâ€™ initial expert witness.Â  Appellantsâ€™ claimed the testimony of their first expert witness was inconsistent because the witness did not have access to all of Arthurâ€™s medical records.Â  Additionally, as part of their return to Respondentsâ€™ written motion in limine, Appellants submitted an affidavit in which Dr. Fish summarized his expert opinion.\r\nAs to the third and fourth Jumper factors, there is evidence that Appellants failed to or neglected to furnish Respondents with the name and information of Dr. Fish until after the discovery deadline.Â  Appellantsâ€™ filed their Complaint on April 30, 1998.Â  They did not list Dr. Fish as an expert witness in their original or supplemental answers to Respondentsâ€™ interrogatories.Â  In a letter to Respondents dated February 16, 2001, Appellants first mentioned enlisting Dr. Fish as an expert witness.Â  In a follow-up letter to Respondents dated March 2, 2001, Appellants identified Dr. Fish as another expert.Â  This letter, however, was beyond the February 19, 2001 deadline set by the scheduling order.Â Â  This delay is inexplicable given Appellantsâ€™ counsel told the judge during the motion in limine hearing that â€œ[t]his witness was set up ever since 1999 on this case.â€ \r\nThis late notification inevitably created significant surprise to Respondents.Â  In a letter dated March 7, 2001, Respondents notified Appellants that they took the position that Dr. Fish was not a named expert because he was not identified before the discovery deadline.Â  After the case was set for date certain on January 14, 2002, Respondentsâ€™ again informed Appellants by letter dated October 23, 2001, of their position regarding Dr. Fish and requested Appellants respond if they were in disagreement. Â Appellants offered no response until the case was called for trial.Â Â  \r\nFinally, given these circumstances, Respondents were prejudiced by the fact that they did not have time to depose Dr. Fish prior to trial given Appellants identified him as a definite witness after the discovery deadline and failed to provide any additional information regarding this out-of-state expert.Â  \r\nAs to Dr. Graham and Dr. Chewning, we initially question whether Appellants preserved for our review any argument concerning the exclusion of these witnesses.Â  A review of their brief reveals that Appellants only specifically referenced Dr. Fish by name. Â See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting where a party fails to cite authority or where the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue).Â  Because, however, the argument was made to the trial judge and the Appellants generally discuss these two witnesses, we have decided to address the issue on the merits.\r\nSimilar to the judgeâ€™s decision to exclude Dr. Fish, we also find the judge properly excluded Dr. Graham and Dr. Chewning.Â  With respect to the first and second Jumper factors, Appellants informed the judge that Dr. Graham and Dr. Chewning were treating physicians of Arthur and had access to his medical records. Â Appellants further explained that Dr. Chewning was a â€œsubsequent caretakerâ€ of Arthur and had â€œin essence saved that manâ€™s life.â€Â  However, Appellants informed the judge that neither witness could testify to the events of May 8, 1995, because they were not present when the tooth extraction took place. \r\nIn terms of Appellantsâ€™ failure to furnish Respondents with the names of these witnesses, the record reflects that neither witness was specifically listed in response to Respondentsâ€™ interrogatories. Â Instead, Appellants indicated in their response that they would â€œpermit review of [the following] medical records regarding treatment and costâ€ from Carolina Hospital Systems, Graham Clinic, and Dr. Chewning.Â  \r\nFinally, there is evidence that Respondents were significantly surprised and prejudiced by Appellantsâ€™ decision to call these two witnesses at trial given Respondents did not receive notice that these witnesses had been subpoenaed until the Friday before the trial that was scheduled for Monday.Â  Due to the late notification, Respondents were unable to depose either witness before trial.\r\nAccordingly, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excluding Appellantsâ€™ three witnesses.Â  In reaching this decision, the judge did not exclude the witnesses solely on the ground of Appellantsâ€™ failure to comply with the time limits of the scheduling order.Â  Instead, the judge made the appropriate inquiry and considered the requisite factors.Â  Cf. Barnette v. Adams Bros. Logging, Inc., 355 S.C. 588, 593, 586 S.E.2d 572, 575 (2003) (reversing decision of trial court to exclude plaintiffsâ€™ witnesses where â€œthe trial court made no specific finding of prejudice to the respondents, other than finding the late disclosure would necessitate further discoveryâ€ and the â€œtrial court advised the parties that there had been no disobedience of any order of the court, and that it had not imposed any sanctionsâ€); Jumper, 348 S.C. at 151, 558 S.E.2d at 916 (reversing trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude plaintiffâ€™s expert witness where the court failed to learn and analyze all of the details and information about the witness and the court relied solely on the limits established by the pre-trial discovery order).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated herein, we find the circuit court did not err in its rulings regarding the issuance of the scheduling order as well as discovery.Â  Moreover, we find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in excluding three of Appellantsâ€™ witnesses at trial and did not err in denying Appellantsâ€™ Batson motion. \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â Although Appellants were represented by counsel at trial and through oral argument before this court, we note they are now proceeding pro se in this appeal.\r\n[2]Â  Trismus is a spasm of the jaw muscles that makes it difficult to open the mouth. \r\n[3]Â  The complaint alleged Dr. Eagerton extracted Arthurâ€™s tooth.Â  At trial, however, Arthur testified Dr. Sojourner extracted his tooth.Â  Respondents denied Dr. Eagerton ever treated Arthur. Â Dr. Eagerton is now deceased.Â  He passed away after the trial.\r\n[4]Â  Although Appellants raise three separate issues, we have consolidated the related issues under one heading in the interest of clarity and brevity.\r\n[5]Â  We note that it is questionable whether Respondentsâ€™ counselâ€™s letter combined with the attached proposed scheduling order constituted a motion under Rule 7(b), SCRCP.Â  Rule 7(b) provides that motions â€œshall be made in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, and shall set forth the relief or order sought.â€Â  Although the letter and proposed order were not necessarily the equivalent of a formal motion, the letter was in writing and it expressed counselâ€™s concerns regarding discovery. Â The attached proposed scheduling order also set forth the relief sought by Respondents. Â In addition, Respondentsâ€™ counsel mailed a copy of the letter and the proposed order to Appellantsâ€™ counsel.Â  Because the circuit court and the parties were aware of the substance of Respondentsâ€™ request, we do not believe Appellants were prejudiced by the absence of a formal motion.Â  Cf. DM Co. v. Nycoil Co., 273 S.C. 496, 499, 257 S.E.2d 499, 500 (1979) (holding judgment by default was precluded where oral response to pleadings, which did not comply with strictures of circuit court rules, at a rule to show cause hearing was sufficient to comply with substantive requirement of the rules given plaintiff had actual notice of both the existence and contents of defendantâ€™s response to plaintiffâ€™s Complaint). \r\n[6]Â  In their brief, Appellants note they raised a Batson challenge regarding the â€œabnormal excusing [of] a black male juror from the panel after all voir dire and other inquires into the jury selection process had been concluded.â€Â  Appellants, however, failed to provide arguments or supporting authority for this assertion.Â  Thus, the issue is deemed abandoned on appeal. See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444 S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (noting where a party fails to cite authority or where the argument is simply a conclusory statement, the party is deemed to have abandoned the issue).\r\n[7]Â  We reject Respondentsâ€™ claim that Appellants failed to preserve this issue for review because Appellants did not proffer the testimony of the witnesses at trial.Â  After the trial judge granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to exclude the witnesses, Appellants asked if they could note for the record that they intended to call the excluded witnesses. Â Judge Baxley replied, â€œSure you may.â€ Â Appellants then noted each witness Appellants would have called if the trial judge had allowed the witnessâ€™ testimony. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4104","title":"Hambrick v.

McGarry, of Boston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:Â  In this civil action, the circuit court dismissed Scott and Kristy Hambrickâ€™s (the Hambricks) suit against GMAC Mortgage Corporation, doing business as ditech.com (Ditech).Â  The circuit court found the Hambricksâ€™s claims against Ditech all stemmed from the allegation that Ditech was engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to hear this case and granted Ditechâ€™s motion dismissing the suit.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Hambricks obtained a real estate loan from Ditech that was secured by their home in Aiken County.Â  The Hambricks claim Ditech engaged in the unauthorized practice of law during the loan process.Â  First, the Hambricks claim Ditech impermissibly prepared loan-related documents without the use of an attorney and, second, Ditech failed to use an attorney to close the loan.Â  Â \r\nThe Hambricks initially brought suit in Hampton County, individually and as a class action, against Ditech and Milton R. Cooley, a notary public of South Carolina, who they allege performed the real estate closing.Â  In their complaint, the Hambricks stated eight legal and equitable claims, including breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, fraud, constructive fraud, civil conspiracy, and a claim for accounting.Â  Each allegation stemmed from the Hambricksâ€™s claim that Ditech charged them for legal fees that were not provided nor could be provided due to Ditechâ€™s failure to utilize an attorney.Â  Â \r\nThe case was removed to federal district court and ultimately remanded to state court where the Hambricks re-filed suit in Richland County.Â  On July 26, 2004, Ditech moved for judgment on the pleadings, on the basis that South Carolina does not recognize a private right of action for the unauthorized practice of law.Â  At the motion hearing, the Hambricks conceded that if their action sought to determine whether Ditechâ€™s actions constituted the unauthorized practice of law, then the suit should be brought in the original jurisdiction of the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  However, the Hambricks asserted Ditechâ€™s actions during the loan transaction process, pursuant to case law, have already been declared by the supreme court to be the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Therefore, they allege the circuit court had jurisdiction to assess Â damages stemming from the improperly charged fees.Â  \r\nThe circuit court granted Ditechâ€™s motion for judgment on the pleadings.Â  The circuit court primarily relied on Linder v. Insurance Claims Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 560 S.E.2d 612 (2002), in finding Â South Carolina law precludes private citizens from suing for money damages based on an allegation of the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Further, the circuit court found the only claim that could be brought based on an allegation of the unauthorized practice of law is a request for declaratory relief brought in the original jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court concluded it lacked jurisdiction to hear this case and granted Ditechâ€™s motion dismissing the suit.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe circuit court may dismiss a claim when the defendant demonstrates the plaintiffâ€™s â€œâ€˜failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of actionâ€™ in the pleadings filed with the court.â€ FOC Lawshe Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 352 S.C. 408, 412, 574 S.E.2d 228, 230 (Ct. App. 2002) (quoting Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP).Â  The circuit court â€œmust dispose of a motion for failure to state a cause of action based solely upon the allegations set forth on the face of the complaint.â€ Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, 366, 353 S.E.2d 697, 698 (1987) (citation omitted).Â  â€œThe motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged in the complaint and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case.â€ Id. â€œAll properly pleaded factual allegations are deemed admitted for the purposes of considering a motion for judgment on the pleadings.â€ FOC Lawshe Ltd. Pâ€™ship, 352 S.C. at 413, 574 S.E.2d at 230.Â  This court applies the same standard of review implemented by the circuit court.Â \r\nWilliams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496, 500 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe sole issue on appeal is whether the circuit court erred in dismissing the Hambricksâ€™s complaint.Â  For the reasons set out below, we find the Hambricks failed to allege facts sufficient to maintain this action.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court dismissing Hambricksâ€™s complaint. Â \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court has the duty to regulate the practice of law in this state and, accordingly, has the authority to define what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.Â  The South Carolina Constitution provides â€œ[t]he Supreme Court shall have jurisdiction over the admission to the practice of law . . . .â€ Â S.C. Const. art. V.Â  Â§ 4; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-10 (2001) (â€œThe inherent power of the Supreme Court with respect to regulating the practice of law, determining the qualifications for admission to the bar and disciplining, suspending and disbarring attorneys at law is hereby recognized and declared.â€).Â  The supreme court has stated the purpose behind laws prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law is â€œto protect the public from incompetent, unethical, or irresponsible representation.â€Â  Renaissance Enters. Inc. v. Summit Teleservices, Inc., 334 S.C. 649, 652, 515 S.E.2d 257, 258 (1999).Â  \r\nIn Linder v. Insurance Claims Consultants, Inc., the Linders suffered property loss from a fire in their home.Â  348 S.C. 477, 483, 560 S.E.2d 612, 616 (2002).Â  While their claim was being adjusted by the insurance company, the Linders hired a public insurance adjusting firm, Insurance Claims Consultants (ICC), to advocate on their behalf and they released the lawyer they had previously hired.Â  Id. at 483-84, 560 S.E.2d at 616.Â  Additionally, the Linders requested their insurance company deal directly with ICC concerning their claim.Â  Id. at 484, 560 S.E.2d at 616.Â  When the Linders failed to pay ICC fees Â required under the contract, ICC brought suit in circuit court.Â  In their answer, the Linders asserted, inter alia, that ICC engaged in the unauthorized practice of law, and thus the contract between the parties was void.Â  The Linders also sought damages in tort.Â  Additionally, the Linders filed a declaratory judgment action in the South Carolina Supreme Court seeking a judicial determination that ICCâ€™s acts constituted the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 486, 560 S.E.2d at 617.\r\nThe supreme court found that public insurance adjusting did not per se constitute the unauthorized practice of law, but that some of ICCâ€™s actions, namely advising the Linders of their rights under the insurance policy, amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Id. at 493-94, 560 S.E.2d at 621.Â  Most important to the resolution of this case, the supreme court specifically rejected the Lindersâ€™s claim, that â€œonce an act is declared to be the unauthorized practice of law, then the circuit court has jurisdiction toÂ  hear various causes of action, including a tort action for damages.â€Â Â  Id. at 496, 560 S.E.2d at 622.Â  Â In rejecting this theory, the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\nIn bringing the instant action, the Linders acted in accordance with this Courtâ€™s decision in Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, where we urged â€œany interested individual who becomes aware of such conduct [which may be the unauthorized practice of law] to bring a declaratory judgment action in this Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction to determine the validity of the conduct.â€Â  Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules, 309 S.C. at 307, 422 S.E.2d at 125.Â  We did not, however, authorize a private right of action.Â  Furthermore, there are statutes which prevent the unauthorized practice of law, and while they state such activity will be deemed a crime, they do not sanction a private cause of action.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 40-5-310-320 (2001).Â  When faced with a similar issue, the Supreme Court of Hawaii found that its criminal statutes prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law, while providing remedies such as declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as criminal sanctions, did not create a private claim for damages.Â  Reliable Collection Agency, Ltd. v. Cole, 59 Haw. 503, 584 P.2d 107 (1978).Â  We adopt that reasoning and hold there is no private right of action in South Carolina for the unauthorized practice of law. \r\n\r\nId. at 496-97, 560 S.E.2d at 622-23. \r\nThe Hambricks contend that, unlike the situation in Linder, they are not seeking a judicial determination that Ditechâ€™s actions amounted to the unauthorized practice of law.Â  They maintain the actions attributed to Ditech have already been deemed the unauthorized practice of law by prior case law.[2]Â  Even if we assume Ditechâ€™s actions were tantamount to the unauthorized practice of law, Linder explicitly precludes a private right of action.Â  \r\nTo get around Linder, the Hambricks argue their eight causes of action alleged in the complaint are somehow distinct from their claim Ditech engaged in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  We disagree.Â  Every allegation in the complaint ultimately stems from the Hambricksâ€™s assertion that Ditech engaged in the unauthorized practice of law during the loan transaction.Â  For example, the Hambricksâ€™s claim for breach of contract accompanied with a fraudulent act alleges Ditech breached the contract by â€œmanipulating the process so that attorneys would not be usedâ€ and Ditech â€œknew that licensed attorneys were legally required to handle all real estate loans in South Carolina.â€Â  Even the Hambricksâ€™s equitable claim for unjust enrichment alleges Ditech charged fees for services that could not have been performed â€œabsent the use of a licensed South Carolina attorney.â€Â  The Hambricksâ€™s allegations in their complaint are intertwined with their claim Ditechâ€™s actions constituted the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Only our supreme court has the constitutional duty to determine what acts constitute the unauthorized practice of law.Â  See Â In re Unauthorized Practice of Rules Proposed by the S.C. Bar, 309 S.C. 304, 305, 422 S.E.2d 123, 124 (1992) (â€œThe Constitution commits to this Court the duty to regulate the practice of law in South Carolinaâ€) (citing S.C. Const. art. V. Â§ 4).\r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe find the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to determine whether Ditech engaged in the unauthorized practice of the law.Â  Further, we find even if the alleged acts were the unauthorized practice of the law, no private right of action exists under Linder. Â Â Accordingly, the circuit court did not err by dismissing the Hambricksâ€™s complaint.Â  For the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, WILLIAMS, JJ., CONCUR.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument, pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\n[2] In Doe v.

Ltd. v. Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all the inferences that can be drawn therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Redwend Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 468, 581 S.E.2d 496, 501 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard applied by the trial court . . . .â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 861 (2002). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn order to establish liability in a â€œslip and fallâ€ case, a plaintiff must show that the defendant either (1) created the defective condition or (2) had knowledge of the dangerous condition and failed to remedy it.Â  Wintersteen&nbsp;v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35, 542 S.E.2d 728, 729 (2001).Â  In the instant case, there is no contention that Piggly Wiggly created the dangerous condition, as Legette argues the floor was slippery from rainwater.Â  Therefore, we are left to consider whether Piggly Wiggly should have known of the dangerous condition and failed to take reasonable steps to remedy it.Â  It is well settled that merchants are not required to continuously inspect their floors for foreign substances.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 166, 580 S.E.2d 440, 442 (2003).Â  A merchant owes [customers] only â€œthe duty of exercising ordinary care to keep the premises in reasonably safe condition.â€Â  Milligan v. Winn-Dixie Raleigh, 273 S.C. 118, 120, 254 S.E.2d 798, 799 (1979).Â  \r\nIn Young v. Meeting Street Piggly Wiggly, 288 S.C. 508, 512, 343 S.E.2d 636, 638 (Ct. App. 1986), this court concluded that the addition of mats at a storeâ€™s entrance, the periodic mopping of the area, and the placement of at least one warning sign were all reasonable steps taken by the store to protect its customers.Â  Customers, as ordinary, prudent persons, should understand the risks posed by rainy conditions.Â  Id.Â  The court stated:Â  â€œSince it is impossible to keep commercial premises entirely free of tracked-in rain during bad weather, a merchantâ€™s liability may not be based solely on the presence of moisture.â€Â  Id. at 510, 343 S.E.2d at 637-38.Â  \r\nWhile Blackmon concedes there was moisture on the floor, the record shows that Piggly Wiggly took reasonable precautions to provide safe premises for its customers.Â  Legette testified she did not notice water on the floor prior to her fall.Â  She further testified she did not remember seeing any mats or warning signs at the entry where she fell.Â  However, photographs taken by store employees immediately following Legetteâ€™s fall show large mats and warning signs in the area.Â  Legette testified she did not recall employees bringing mats or warning cones out to the area after she fell or while she was sitting for the photographs.Â  Testimony that contradicts undisputed physical evidence generally lacks probative value.Â  See Patterson&nbsp;v. I.H. Servs., Inc., 295 S.C. 300, 304, 368 S.E.2d 215, 218 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Lail v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t, 244 S.C. 237, 136 S.E.2d 306 (1964) for the proposition that â€œtestimony relied upon by plaintiff to establish liability was inconsistent with incontrovertible physical facts and therefore lacked probative value.â€).\r\nThe incident report completed by Blackmon indicated that warning signs were at the entrances to the store.Â  Furthermore, there was testimony from Blackmon regarding the storeâ€™s inclement weather procedures.Â  This included having employees mop the entry areas as needed and putting out warning signs.Â  According to Blackmon, mats were always in place inside the store at the entryway and were only removed if they became so saturated as to pose a greater danger than the bare floor.Â  Blackmon did not recall the mats being removed on the day of the accident.Â  \r\nEven viewing all the evidence in the record in the light most favorable to Legette, we cannot conclude that summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  Legette testified that she did not see the water before she fell.Â  The inference to be drawn is that the accumulation of water was minimal.Â  Furthermore, Blackmonâ€™s testimony, the incident report, and the photographs all support the conclusion that mats and warning signs were in place at the entrance to the store.Â  The only evidence in the record to refute this is Legetteâ€™s uncertain testimony.[2]Â  Initially, she claimed no mats or cones were at the door.Â  Then, when confronted with the photographs, she could only be certain that she did not remember seeing them; they might have been there or they might not have been there. Â Legette also testified that when she fell, she heard Blackmon shouting at one of his employees saying, â€œwhy didnâ€™t they put out the mats, and why didnâ€™t somebody mop up the water.â€Â  Again, after being confronted with the photographs, Legetteâ€™s testimony changed.Â  She claimed she did not hear Mr. Blackmon say anything about mats.Â  â€œI said he said to mop. . . .

Masella, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nHarvey L. Golden and J. Michael Taylor, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This is an action to recover unpaid alimony awarded in a 1974 divorce decree.Â  The decree required Henry Kelley (Husband) to pay alimony to Betty Kelley (Wife).Â  The family court granted Husbandâ€™s motion to dismiss, finding Wifeâ€™s claim for â€œpast due alimony and future supportâ€ was barred by laches and equitable estoppel.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife divorced on July 30, 1974, after fourteen years of marriage.Â  The divorce decree required Husband to pay child support of fifty dollars per week per child and alimony of twenty-five dollars per week.Â  At the time of the divorce, Husband lived in Florida and Wife lived in South Carolina.Â  The court awarded Wife custody of the two children, Chuck and Kevin, who, at the time, were twelve and ten respectively.Â  \r\nLess then a year after the divorce, Wife sent Chuck to live with Husband in Florida because she thought Husband could better control him.Â  Husbandâ€™s counsel wrote a letter dated March 25, 1975, memorializing an agreement that would â€œreduce [Husbandâ€™s] support payments by one-half (1/2) from this time forward and [Husband] will have complete custody and control of Chuck Kelley.â€Â  Former Family Court Judge John A. Mason signed the bottom of this letter.Â Â  \r\nThe parties continued under this half-support custody agreement for almost two years, until Chuck went back to live with Wife.Â  By order dated September 23, 1977, the provisions of the original divorce decree were reinstated, and Husband was required to make payments to Wife to resolve a support arrearage of $4,450.Â  This arrangement also did not last long.Â  Less than five months after the 1977 order, Chuck returned to live with Husband in Florida, where he remained permanently.Â  Wife maintained custody of Kevin at that time.\r\nSix months after Chuck returned to Florida to live with Husband, Wifeâ€™s then attorney obtained an ex parte order invoking the automatic arrest provision of the September 1977 order.Â  This order was neither issued with notice to Husbandâ€™s counsel nor was it ever served on Husband.Â  Moreover, Wifeâ€™s current attorney conceded no evidence existed to show the order was served on Husband. \r\nLess than one month after the ex parte order was signed, Kevin, who was then fifteen, went to Florida to visit Husband and decided to move there permanently as well.Â  Husband claims that at this point, because the two children lived with him, he and Wife orally agreed that he no longer owed her any alimony, and she did not owe him child support.Â  Wife disputes the existence of any such agreement.\r\nOn October 5, 2001, Wife instituted a rule to show cause, seeking to hold Husband in contempt for failure to obey the previous orders requiring him to pay alimony.Â  Husband answered and moved to dismiss based upon laches, expiration of the statute of limitations, and estoppel.Â  After a hearing on the merits, the family court denied Wifeâ€™s claim for past due and future alimony on the grounds of laches and estoppel.Â  Wife then moved to alter or amend the judgment which was denied by the trial court.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn an appeal from the family court, we have jurisdiction to find the facts in accordance with our view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings, and we remain mindful of the fact the family court judge, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife contends the family court erred by denying her claim for alimony based on laches.Â  We disagree.[2]  \r\nâ€œLaches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should have been done.â€Â  Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988).Â  The party seeking to establish laches must show (1) delay, (2) that was unreasonable under the circumstances, and (3) prejudice.Â  Brown v. Butler, 347 S.C. 259, 265, 554 S.E.2d 431, 434 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWhether laches applies in a particular situation is a highly fact-specific inquiry; therefore, the merits of each case must be closely examined.Â  Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 297, 519 S.E.2d 583, 599 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Thus, â€œthe determination of whether laches has been established is largely within the discretion of the trial court.â€Â  Emery v. Smith, 361 S.C. 207, 215, 603 S.E.2d 598, 602 (Ct. App. 2004).Â Â  Additionally, in order for the defense of laches to be sustained, â€œthe circumstances must have been such as to import that the complainant had abandoned or surrendered the claim or right which he now asserts.â€Â  Byers v. Cherokee County, 237 S.C. 548, 560, 118 S.E.2d 324, 330 (1961).Â  \r\nIn this action, the family court found Wifeâ€™s delay was unreasonable.Â  It is undisputed that there has been at least a twenty-four year delay from the original divorce order to the present action.Â  Alimony was awarded to Wife in the 1974 divorce decree, reiterated in the 1977 order, and the present action was not commenced until 2001.Â  Although Wife received an order in 1978 holding Husband in contempt, she admittedly never served Husband or his counsel.Â  Despite seeing Husband at numerous gatherings over the years, including the weddings of both sons, Wife failed to have Husband served with the order.Â  She also failed to write or call Husband to request alimony.Â  \r\nWife further claims she did not know how to locate Husband and therefore her delay should be excused.Â  However, the record shows Wife has seen her children at least once a year since 1978, and Husband has employed both sons intermittently over the years.Â  Wife testified to having a good relationship with her sons, and she offered no explanation as to why she could not have asked her sons where Husband lived.Â  Additionally, Husband presented evidence he owned property in Florida, his telephone number was listed, and he had an answering service when he traveled outside the state of Florida.Â  Therefore, Wifeâ€™s argument that she could not locate Husband is untenable.Â  Accordingly, we agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that Wife was afforded numerous opportunities to enforce her right to alimony over twenty-four years, and her failure to do so was unreasonable.\r\nWe further find Husband was prejudiced by Wifeâ€™s delay in seeking alimony.Â  Husband is sixty-five years old and approaching retirement.Â  He testified his finances have been erratic over the past twenty-four years, and if he had known he had a lingering support obligation, he would have asked the court to terminate or reduce his payments.Â  He is currently on his fourth marriage, and is a diabetic with extremely poor health.Â Â  Wife, however, has maintained the same employment since the divorce and has been able to meet her own needs for the past twenty-four years.Â  Therefore, we agree with the family courtâ€™s finding that Husband would be materially prejudiced by Wife resurrecting an alimony obligation over twenty years old.Â  \r\nWife also relies on the case of Miles v. Miles, 355 S.C. 511, 586 S.E.2d 136 (Ct. App. 2003), for the proposition that Husband cannot orally modify a court order.Â  Although it is â€œaxiomatic that parties cannot modify a court order,â€ Wifeâ€™s reliance on Miles is misplaced.Â  Id. at 511, 586 S.E.2d at 140.Â  In Miles, a husband brought an action to terminate alimony five years after the divorce based on an oral modification.Â  Id. at 518, 586 S.E.2d at 140.Â  We found the divorce decree specifically incorporated an unambiguous written agreement by the parties that any agreement or court order could not be modified by the parties â€œwithout written consent of husband and wife.â€Â  Id.Â  In this action, no agreement exists regarding modification in the original divorce order as there was in Miles.Â  Moreover, Husband is not seeking oral modification of a court order.Â  Rather he argues that the conduct of both parties over the years reflects their mutual agreement that Husband no longer owed alimony.Â  We find it particularly noteworthy that Wife sought to have Husband held in contempt in 1978, but failed to serve the order on Husband when Chuck and Kevin subsequently moved in with Husband.Â  The reasonable inference from the evidence is Wife agreed not to pursue Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation because Husband had a claim for child support against her.Â Â  Therefore, Wifeâ€™s reliance on Miles is misplaced.Â Â Â  \r\nWife lastly argues the family court erred in finding her claims barred by equitable estoppel, arguing that Husband did not meet his burden in establishing equitable estoppel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn South Carolina, â€œthe essential elements of estoppel are divided between the estopped party and the party claiming estoppel.â€Â  Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co. v. Driver, 317 S.C. 471, 477, 451 S.E.2d 924, 928 (Ct. App. 1994) (citations omitted).Â  As to the party being estopped, the elements are: 1) conduct which amounts to a false representation, or conduct calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise, 2) the intention that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party, and 3) knowledge of the true facts.Â  Id. at 477, 451 S.E.2d at 928; Johns v. Johns, 309 S.C. 199, 204, 420 S.E.2d 856, 859 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  In order to claim estoppel, Husband must show: â€œ1) a lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question; 2) justifiable reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and 3) prejudicial change in the position of the party claiming estoppel.â€Â  Walton v. Walton, 282 S.C. 165, 168, 318 S.E.2d 14, 16 (1984).Â  \r\nHere, Wifeâ€™s conduct conveyed the impression that Husband was no longer obligated to pay alimony based on Husbandâ€™s understanding that Wife agreed to waive alimony in exchange for him having custody of the children and based on Wifeâ€™s failure to demand alimony from Husband in over twenty years.Â  Further, Wife intended Husband to rely on the agreement that he not pay her alimony, so that he, in turn, would not pursue child support against her.Â  Husbandâ€™s decision not to seek child support also shows he was justified in relying on the partiesâ€™ decision to mutually waive support obligations.Â  Lastly, Husband changed his position in reliance on the agreement because if he had known he had a lingering support obligation, he would have sought to have his obligation reduced or eliminated.Â  Therefore, we find the family court correctly concluded equitable estoppel would also bar Wifeâ€™s claim for alimony.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family courtâ€™s finding that Wifeâ€™s claim for past due alimony and future alimony should be barred on the grounds of laches and equitable estoppel is hereby\r\n AFFIRMED.[3]\r\nHEARN, C.J., and HUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Because alimony is a continuing obligation, the doctrine of laches would not apply to Husbandâ€™s future alimony payments.Â  See Stephens v. Hamrick, 358 S.E.2d 547 (N.C. Ct. App. 1987) (refusing to apply doctrine of laches to the enforcement of a court order for alimony because â€œthe obligation to furnish support is continuous [and therefore] a lapse of time will not be a bar to the commencementâ€).Â  However, the family court found Wifeâ€™s claim for â€œpast due alimony and future supportâ€ was barred by laches and equitable estoppel.Â  We affirm that order, but note that Wifeâ€™s claim for future support is barred solely by the doctrine of equitable estoppel, an issue we discuss below.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Because our resolution of these issues is dispositive, we need not address Appellantâ€™s remaining issues.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (holding an appellate court need not address remaining issues when the resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4107","title":"State v.

Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â Russell W. Rice, Jr. appeals his convictions and sentences for murder and trafficking in cocaine arguing the trial court erred in denying his motion to sever the charges.Â  Rice contends he was prejudiced by having a single trial for both charges because the murder occurred six to seven weeks before the cocaine trafficking.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn September or October of 2002, upon leaving a restaurant in Greenville, Rice discovered his car, a 1994 Mercury Topaz, had been stolen from the parking lot.Â  Rice suspected Homer Johnson, an acquaintance who sold drugs, stole the car.Â  Drugs and money were inside the vehicle when it was stolen.\r\nOn November 4, 2002, despite Riceâ€™s suspicion that Johnson had stolen his car, Rice and Johnson entered into a drug deal.Â  Johnson possessed twenty pounds of marijuana that he, Rice, and another person, Johnny Hamby, â€œcut upâ€ into twenty individual bags.Â  Johnson gave Rice ten pounds of marijuana and told him he owed $11,000.Â  Although Rice was unhappy that he received only ten pounds of marijuana, he told Johnson he would pay him the money the next day.\r\nThe following day, Rice phoned Hamby.Â  He asked Hamby to call Johnson and tell him that Rice would meet him at a Super 8 Motel.Â  Hamby relayed the message to Johnson.Â  Johnson was murdered at the motel.\r\nDuring the course of the police investigation, Daniel Fuller, the investigator assigned to the case, attempted to contact Rice numerous times by telephone.Â  On December 26, Investigator Fuller spoke with Rice, who informed Fuller he was leaving town and would not return until December 30.Â  Fuller was skeptical of Rice and began looking for Rice in Greenville.Â  Fuller observed Rice driving a 1994 Mercury Topaz â€“ the car Rice claimed Johnson had stolen from him a few months earlier.Â  Fuller found the car at a motel and discovered it was not insured or properly registered in South Carolina.Â  Further, the forty-five day paper tag had expired.Â  Fuller set up surveillance at the exits of the motel.\r\nWhen Rice left the parking lot, Corporal Dave Dempsey followed Rice and pulled him over.Â  Rice was unable to provide proof of insurance.Â  Dempsey and Fuller asked Rice to exit the vehicle.Â  They patted Rice down to see if he had a weapon.Â  Dempsey found a pistol in Riceâ€™s front pocket and $2,500.Â  They arrested Rice for the traffic violations.Â  The officers conducted an inventory search before they removed the car from the scene.Â  A search of the trunk produced a large amount of cocaine, a scale, and a rifle cut into several pieces in a plastic bag.Â  Rice was subsequently charged with murder and trafficking in cocaine.\r\nBefore trial, Rice moved to sever the murder and trafficking in cocaine charges.Â  Rice argued the traffic stop occurred six to seven weeks after the murder and the only connection between the two was that a weapon was found with the cocaine.Â  Therefore, Rice alleged, no nexus between the two charges existed.Â  The State disagreed and claimed the reason for the stop was the murder.Â  The State believed the rifle found in Riceâ€™s car was the murder weapon.Â  The State contended the â€œdrug transaction was at the root of the murder itselfâ€ and the two charges involved the same or similar evidence.Â  The trial court denied the motion to sever the charges.Â  A jury convicted Rice of both charges.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion for severance is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005); State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The trial courtâ€™s ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â \r\nState v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); Walker, 366 S.C. at 656, 623 S.E.2d at 128; see also State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 564 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 2002) (declaring circuit court has wide discretion when deciding whether to consolidate charges for trial and its decision will only be overturned when abuse of discretion has occurred).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Walker, 366 S.C. at 656, 623 S.E.2d at 129.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSEVERANCE\r\nRice contends the trial court erred in refusing to sever the murder and trafficking in cocaine charges.Â  Rice maintains the cocaine discovered in his car was unrelated to the murder that occurred six to seven weeks earlier.Â  Therefore, Rice avers any evidence of cocaine trafficking was prejudicial to Rice in the murder trial, warranting severance of the charges.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe appellate court considers several factors when deciding whether the trial courtâ€™s consolidation of charges was proper.Â  Where the offenses charged in separate indictments are of the same general nature involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and character, the trial judge has the power, in his discretion, to order the indictments tried together if the defendantâ€™s substantive rights would not be prejudiced.Â  State v. Cutro, 365 S.C. 366, 618 S.E.2d 890 (2005);\r\nState v. Smith, 322 S.C. 107, 470 S.E.2d 364 (1996); State v. Simmons, 352 S.C. 342, 573 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 2002); State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 479 S.E.2d 517 (Ct. App. 1996); see also State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (noting where offenses charged in separate indictments are of same general nature, involving connected transactions closely related in kind, place and character, trial judge has authority, in his discretion, to order indictments tried together over objection of defendant absent showing that defendantâ€™s substantive rights were violated); McCrary v. State, 249 S.C. 14, 36, 152 S.E.2d 235, 246 (1967) (stating â€œ[t]he two offenses were of the same general nature, involving connected transactions closely related in time, place and character; and the trial judge had power, in his discretion, to order them tried together over objection by the defendant in the absence of a showing that the latterâ€™s substantive rights would have been thereby prejudiced.â€).Â  Offenses are considered to be of the same general nature where they are interconnected.Â  State v. Grace, 350 S.C. 19, 564 S.E.2d 331 (Ct. App. 2002); Jones, 325 S.C. at 315, 479 S.E.2d at 519.\r\nConversely, offenses which are of the same nature, but which do not arise out of a single chain of circumstances and are not provable by the same evidence may not properly be tried together.Â  See Simmons, 352 S.C. at 350, 573 S.E.2d at 860; Jones, 325 S.C. at 315, 479 S.E.2d at 519; see also State v. Middleton, 288 S.C. 21, 339 S.E.2d 692 (1986) (holding although prison escapee committed two murders within a few miles of each other and attempted an armed robbery, the trial judge erred in consolidating the charges for one trial where the crimes did not arise out of a single chain of circumstances and they required different evidence); State v. Tate, 286 S.C. 462, 334 S.E.2d 289 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding that joint trial on identical but unrelated forgeries violated defendantâ€™s right to a fair trial).Â  Cf. State v. Woomer, 276 S.C. 258, 277 S.E.2d 696 (1981), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) (ruling that consolidation was proper even though crimes occurred over numerous days because conduct arose from a single uninterrupted crime spree); Simmons, 352 S.C. at 351, 573 S.E.2d at 861 (concluding defendantâ€™s separate burglary offenses were properly joined when both arose out of a single chain of events, were of the same nature, and proved by the same evidence).\r\nCharges can be joined in the same indictment and tried together where they (1) arise out of a single chain of circumstances; (2) are proved by the same evidence; (3) are of the same general nature; and (4) no real right of the defendant has been prejudiced.Â \r\nState v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 572 S.E.2d 267 (2002); State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); see also Simmons, 352 S.C. at 351, 573 S.E.2d at 861 (â€œFurther, joinder of offenses in one trial is proper if the offenses (1) are of the same general nature or character and spring from the same series of transactions, (2) are committed by the same offender, and (3) require the same or similar proof.â€).\r\nIn the case sub judice, two separate indictments were issued against Rice.Â  The first was for trafficking in cocaine, the second for murder.Â  The cocaine trafficking charge arose out of a traffic stop the police set up because they suspected Rice of Johnsonâ€™s murder.Â  The police found the gun believed to be the murder weapon in the same search that produced the cocaine that forms the basis of the cocaine trafficking charge.Â  The State surmised Riceâ€™s motive for murdering Johnson was in part to retrieve the cocaine and money Johnson stole from Riceâ€™s car.Â  When the police arrested Rice at the traffic stop, he was found with large amounts of cocaine and money.Â  Moreover, the testimony at trial revealed the relationship between Rice and Johnson was largely based on selling drugs.Â  The Stateâ€™s theory as to the motive for Johnsonâ€™s murder involved the drugs Johnson stole from Rice when he stole Riceâ€™s car as well as the drug-related argument the two recently had involving the marijuana.\r\nAdditionally, Rice suffered no prejudice from the joinder of charges because, without the evidence of cocaine trafficking, the jury would not have received an accurate portrayal of the case.Â  The cocaine trafficking evidence was necessary for a full presentation of the case without fragmentation.Â  See State v.

Middleton, with Motherâ€™s encouragement, developed a strong, parental relationship with both Motherâ€™s daughters.Â  He supported the two girls financially and emotionally, and even though they are now grown, he still considers them his daughters.Â  In fact, when Chelsea married, Middleton escorted her down the aisle despite the fact that her biological father attended the wedding.Â  \r\nBy 1992, Mother and Middleton were no longer in a serious relationship; however, they had an intimate encounter in July of that year.Â  Nine months later, on April 7, 1993, Joshua Hollington was born.Â  During Motherâ€™s pregnancy, she told Middleton that Eugene Hollington was the father of her child.Â  However, after Joshâ€™s birth, Mother called Middleton and told him he needed to see Josh, and she sent a photograph to Middleton when Josh was three months old.Â  The implication was that Middleton was Joshâ€™s father because the resemblance between Josh and Middleton was so striking.\r\nOnce Middleton saw the photograph and the physical similarity between Josh and himself, he showed the picture to various family members and friends.Â  They all thought, as did Middleton, that Josh and Middleton were biologically related.Â  Subsequently, Middleton went to his doctor to have a blood test performed, and the test did not exclude him as Joshâ€™s biological father.Â  \r\nBeginning when Josh was three months old, Middleton took an active role in Joshâ€™s life.Â  He regularly spent time with Josh and supported him financially.Â  When Josh was approximately one year old, a DNA test revealed Eugene Hollington to be Joshâ€™s biological father.Â  By that time, Middleton testified he was already committed to being Joshâ€™s father, and with Motherâ€™s blessing, Middleton continued to love and take care of Josh as though he were a son.Â  When Josh was three, Mother lived in a home owned by Middleton that was next door to Middletonâ€™s fatherâ€™s house.Â  Middleton checked on his father daily, and nearly every time Middleton was at his fatherâ€™s house, Mother sent Josh over to visit.Â  Often, Middleton would take Josh home to spend the night.Â  \r\nWhen Josh began preschool, Middleton and Mother shared the costs.Â  Middleton signed Joshâ€™s report cards and picked Josh up from preschool at least three days per week.Â  Essentially, Middleton and Mother had a joint custody arrangement, with Mother caring for Josh Mondays through Wednesdays and Middleton keeping Josh the remainder of the week.\r\nThis joint custody arrangement was interrupted briefly when Josh was approximately four years old, and Mother moved in with her boyfriend.Â  At that point, Mother attempted to stop Middleton from seeing Josh because her boyfriend did not like Middletonâ€™s presence in their lives.Â  This was resolved when Middleton offered to pay Joshâ€™s entire daycare expense, at which point, his normal Thursday through Sunday visitation schedule resumed.Â  \r\nWhen Josh started public school, Middleton, without Mother, took Josh to his first day of kindergarten.Â  Joshâ€™s teachers from second, third, and fourth grades testified that they all believed Middleton was Joshâ€™s biological father.Â  Even on the days when Josh did not spend the night with Middleton, Middleton would drive him to school in the mornings.Â  He also picked up Josh nearly every day after school, and he attended PTA meetings, open houses, field trips, and other school-related activities.Â  The teachers acknowledged Middleton as Joshâ€™s father in front of Mother, and Mother never corrected them.Â  Middleton also enrolled Josh in the Boy Scouts and in a basketball league. Joshâ€™s basketball coach testified that Josh referred to Middleton as â€œmy dad,â€ and Middleton took Josh to every practice and game.Â  \r\nWhen Josh was in third grade, Mother began to date John McCants.Â  As the couple became more serious, Mother called Middleton and stated McCants did not want Josh at Middletonâ€™s house every weekend.Â  To accommodate her boyfriend, Mother came up with a schedule where she and Middleton rotated days every week.Â  By this point in time, McCants was living with Mother, and eventually the two married.Â  \r\nAs part of the rotating schedule, Josh spent Christmas of 2002 with Middleton and New Yearâ€™s Eve with Mother.Â  According to the visitation schedule, Josh was to return to Middletonâ€™s house on January 1, 2003; however,Â  Mother called Middleton that day and explained that she was not going to bring Josh over because he had been acting up, and she had to punish him.Â  When Josh came over the following day, he hugged Middleton and told him that Mother had left marks on him by hitting him with a studded belt.Â  Josh showed Middleton the marks on his upper thighs, near his groin area.Â  \r\nMiddleton testified that he had previously observed signs of physical abuse and that he had spoken to Mother about hitting Josh.Â  Middleton was concerned that if he reported this suspected abuse, Mother would forbid him from seeing Josh.Â  Because Middleton did not want to jeopardize his relationship with Josh, he spoke with Joshâ€™s principal about the marks, but did not otherwise contact the authorities.Â  \r\nLater that evening, Mother called and asked to speak with Josh.Â  Â Â Middleton informed her Josh was about to get in the shower, and that Josh would call her back once he was through.Â  Moments later, Mother called back and demanded Josh be brought to her.Â  Middleton did not understand what could have transpired in those few minutes to make Mother so angry, but speculated that Motherâ€™s change in demeanor could have occurred because she thought Middleton might see the marks she left on Josh when Josh undressed to shower.Â  Middleton told Mother it was his night with Josh, and because Josh had been sick earlier, he should not travel outside in the winter right after a shower.Â  Middleton testified he was afraid for Joshâ€™s welfare and refused to bring him to Motherâ€™s house.Â  When the telephone conversation ended, he called the police department and reported the alleged abuse.Â  Mother and McCants also contacted the police to report Middeltonâ€™s refusal to return Josh. \r\nWhen the police arrived, they brought Mother and McCants with them.Â  Because Mother had legal custody, Josh was returned to her.Â  Officer Maggie Carver reported the case to the Department of Social Services, but inexplicably, the Department informed Officer Carver in a voicemail that it would not â€œtake the case.â€Â  Officer Carver testified she believed Middletonâ€™s reason for reporting the alleged abuse was out of true concern for Josh.Â  \r\nAfter this incident in January 2003, Mother terminated all contact between Josh and Middleton.Â  She also contacted school officials and told them Middleton was not allowed to see Josh.Â  Approximately one year later, Mother, McCants, and Josh moved to Florence, South Carolina.Â  \r\nOn February 11, 2003, Middleton filed this action seeking custody of Josh.[1]  Â He also filed a motion to have a guardian ad litem appointed to represent Josh.Â  Mother answered, stating the action should be dismissed because Middleton, not being biologically related to Josh, lacked standing to proceed.Â  The family court (1) denied Motherâ€™s motion to dismiss; (2) appointed a guardian to represent Josh; (3)Â  required Middleton to join Eugene Hollington, Joshâ€™s biological father; and (4) denied Middleton any visitation.Â Â  On April 14, 2003, Middleton filed an amended complaint joining Hollington to the action.Â  Despite being joined in the action and having the pleadings served on him by certified mail, return receipt requested, Hollington has never made an appearance or responded.Â  \r\nOn June 23, 2003, the guardian filed a motion seeking counseling for Josh.Â  The family court issued an order requiring Mother, Middleton, and Josh to cooperate in counseling.Â  Several months later the guardian filed an ex parte emergency motion seeking to compel Motherâ€™s continued compliance with court mandated counseling because Mother stopped taking Josh to counseling.Â  After a hearing, the family court ordered both Mother and Josh to continue meeting with the therapist, Dr. Kay Newman.Â  \r\nOn November 10, 2004, Dr. Newman issued her report recommending Middleton resume visitation with Josh.Â  In her report she stated Josh was a kind, gentle boy whose primary concern was that Dr. Newman understand how much he loves Middleton.Â  According to Dr. Newman, Josh and Middleton separately, â€œreport[ed] a very close, happy relationship between them.Â  Josh reminisce[d] much about Mr. Middletonâ€™s taking him to church, Boy Scouts, signing him up for and attending his basketball league, and other events.â€Â  Dr. Newman noted that Joshâ€™s biological dad had never been involved in Joshâ€™s life,[2] while Middleton had been, with Motherâ€™s blessing, very involved.Â  She also stated McCants declined to be involved in any of the therapy sessions.Â  Further, her report revealed that because Middleton had been instrumental in involving Josh in activities and was an important source of socialization, the move to Florence coupled with losing contact with Middleton, had a negative impact on Josh emotionally.Â  Ultimately, Dr. Newman recommended Josh resume visitation with Middleton, with Motherâ€™s liberal input into the form of visitation.Â  \r\nAfter a three-day trial, the family court denied Middletonâ€™s right to visitation.Â  The family court found that despite Motherâ€™s position that Middleton had been overindulgent with Josh, Middleton had done nothing â€œwhich would have a negative effect on the relationship between the child and his Mother.â€Â  However, the family court found that under the law of South Carolina, a fit, biological parent has the fundamental right to make decisions concerning whether a third party may visit her child.Â  The family court reasoned that because Josh knew he had a biological father, Middleton could not be his psychological parent, and therefore Middleton had no legal right to petition for visitation.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from the family court, this court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992).Â  This broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, 541 (1981).Â  We remain mindful of the fact the family court judge, who saw and heard the parties, is in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign weight to their testimony.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn this case, we are asked to determine what legal standard applies to a third partyâ€™s claim for visitation of a non-biological child for whom he claims to have functioned as a psychological parent.Â  On appeal Middleton argues he has standing to seek visitation because he functioned as a psychological parent to Josh.Â  For the reasons set forth below, we agree, and find the family court erred in concluding Middleton was not Joshâ€™s psychological parent and erred in finding Middleton was not entitled to visitation.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand.Â  \r\nI.Â  Standing\r\nIn all child custody cases, the welfare of the child and the childâ€™s best interest is the â€œprimary, paramount and controlling consideration of the court . . . .â€Â  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d 612, 614 (1978) (citing Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. 524, 220 S.E. 2d 228 (1975)).Â  To further promote the goal of safeguarding the best interests of children, the General Assembly has recognized that in certain circumstances, persons who are not a childâ€™s parent or legal guardian may be proper parties to a custody proceeding.Â  Section 20-7-420 (20) of the South Carolina Code grants the family court jurisdiction to award custody of a child to the childâ€™s parent or â€œany other proper person or institution.â€Â  Pursuant to that statute, third parties have been allowed to bring an action for custody of a child.Â  See Kramer v. Kramer, 323 S.C. 212, 473 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 1996) (awarding custody to childâ€™s aunt and uncle over biological mother); Donahue v. Lawrence, 280 S.C. 382, 312 S.E.2d 594 (Ct. App. 1984) (finding stepmother had standing to initiate termination of parental rights action).Â Â Â  \r\nUnder the penumbra of custody is the lesser included right to visitation.Â  Because Middleton would have standing to bring an action for custody, it follows that he would also have standing to seek visitation.Â  In Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 415 505 S.E.2d 344, 351 (Ct. App. 1998), this court found â€œno authorityâ€ to grant visitation rights to a stepfather of nineteen months, once the biological father, who had been in prison, resumed full custody.Â  However, we specifically found no psychological parent relationship existed between stepfather and children, as the children often saw their biological father.Â  Id. at 413, 505 S.E.2d at 350.Â  \r\nIn this case, Middleton claims he has a right to visitation based on his status as a psychological parent and the significant harm denying visitation causes Josh.Â  As explained more fully below, we agree, and hold the family court erred in finding Middleton lacked standing to bring this action.\r\nII.Â  Third Partyâ€™s Right To Visitation \r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Psychological Parent Doctrine\r\nIn refusing to grant Middleton visitation, the family court specifically found that because Josh knew he had a biological father, Middleton was not Joshâ€™s psychological father.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe notion of a psychological parent or de facto parent was first recognized by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 386 S.E.2d 456 (1989).Â  In Moore, the supreme court found that although a psychological parent-child relationship existed between the child and his unrelated custodians, such a bond was inadequate to support awarding permanent custody to the custodians where the biological parent was fit.Â  Id. at 80-81, 386 S.E.2d at 459.Â  Notably, the supreme court found the psychological parent-child relationship was built largely upon the custodiansâ€™ overt acts, which inhibited the relationship between the biological father and the child. \r\nSubsequently, in Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 413, 505 S.E.2d 344, 350 (Ct. App. 1998), this court found that although the children had a close and loving relationship with their stepfather and grandparents, the level of attachment did not rise to the level of a psychological parent-child relationship.Â Â Â Â Â  Therefore, we found the family court erred in granting joint custody to the stepfather and grandparents, and should have awarded the biological father full custody.Â  Id. at 415, 505 S.E.2d at 351.\r\nBoth Moore and Dodge recognized the existence of the psychological-parent doctrine; however, neither case explores how a party establishes that he or she is the psychological parent to a child of a fit, legal parent. \r\nThe question of who may be deemed a psychological parent for purposes of receiving parental responsibilities has been answered variously.Â  Some states define a psychological parent by breaking down parenthood to its fundamental elements.Â  In California, for example, a de facto parent is defined as â€œa person who has been found by the court to have assumed, on a day-to-day basis, the role of parent, fulfilling both the childâ€™s physical and psychological needs for care and affection, and who has assumed that role for a substantial period.â€Â  Cal. Rules of Court, R. 1401 (8);Â  see also C.E.W. v. D.E.W., 845 A.2d 1146, 1152 (Me. 2004) (declining to define a de facto parent, but noting â€œit must surely be limited to those adults who have fully and completely undertaken a permanent, unequivocal, committed, and responsible parental role in the childâ€™s lifeâ€).Â  \r\nOther states have attempted to refine the concept further by expanding the definition of psychological parenthood.Â  The Alaska Supreme Court has defined a psychological parent as: \r\n\r\n\r\n[O]ne who, on a day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality, fulfills the childâ€™s psychological needs for an adult. This adult becomes an essential focus of the childâ€™s life, for he is not only the source of the fulfillment of the childâ€™s physical needs, but also the source of his emotional and psychological needs . . . . The wanted child is one who is loved, valued, appreciated, and viewed as an essential person by the adult who cares for him.Â  . . .Â  This relationship may exist between a child and any adult; it depends not upon the category into which the adult falls â€“ biological, adoptive, foster, or common-law â€“ but upon the quality and mutuality of the interaction. \r\n\r\nEvans v. McTaggart, 88 P.3d 1078, 1082&nbsp;(Alaska 2004).Â  Similarly, in In re Clifford K., 619 S.E.2d 138&nbsp;(W.Va. 2005), the West Virginia Supreme Court defined the nature of the relationship that supports a finding that the third party acted as a psychological parent.Â  The court stated:Â Â  \r\n\r\nA â€œpsychological parent,â€ who has greater protection under the law in a child custody proceeding than would ordinarily be afforded to one who is not the biological or adoptive parent of the child, is a person who, on a continuing day-to-day basis, through interaction, companionship, interplay, and mutuality, fulfills a childâ€™s psychological and physical needs for a parent and provides for the childâ€™s emotional and financial support.\r\n\r\nId. at 157.Â  \r\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court has developed a four-prong test for determining whether a person has become a psychological parent.Â  In order to demonstrate the existence of a psychological parent-child relationship, the petitioner must show:\r\n\r\n(1) that the biological or adoptive parent[s] consented to, and fostered, the petitionerâ€™s formation and establishment of a parent-like relationship with the child; (2) that the petitioner and the child lived together in the same household; (3) that the petitioner assumed obligations of parenthood by taking significant responsibility for the childâ€™s care, education and development, including contributing towards the childâ€™s support, without\r\nexpectation of financial compensation; [and] (4) that the petitioner has been in a parental role for a length of time sufficient to have established with the child a bonded, dependent relationshipÂ  parental in nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n    In re Custody of H.S.H.-K., 533 N.W.2d 419, 435-36 (Wis. 1995).Â  We believe this test provides a good framework for determining whether a psychological parent-child relationship exists.Â  These four factors ensure that a nonparentâ€™s eligibility for psychological parent status will be strictly limited.\r\nThe first factor is â€œcritical because it makes the biological or adoptive parent a participant in the creation of the psychological parentâ€™s relationship with the child.â€Â  V.C. v. M.J.B., 748 A.2d 539, 552 (N.J. 2000) (explaining the Wisconsin testâ€™s first prong).Â  This factor recognizes that when a legal parent invites a third party into a childâ€™s life, and that invitation alters a childâ€™s life by essentially providing him with another parent, the legal parentâ€™s rights to unilaterally sever that relationship are necessarily reduced.Â  The legal parentâ€™s active fostering of the psychological parent-child relationship is significant because the legal parent has control over whether or not to invite anyone into the private sphere between parent and child.Â  Where a legal parent encourages a parent-like relationship between a child and a third party, â€œthe right of the legal parent [does] not extend to erasing a relationship between [the third party] and her child which [the legal parent] voluntarily created and actively fostered.â€Â  Id. at 552 (citing J.A.L. v. E.P.H., 682 A.2d 1314, 1322 (Pa. 1996)).Â  A parent has the absolute control and ability to maintain a zone of privacy around his or her child.Â  However, a parent cannot maintain an absolute zone of privacy if he or she voluntarily invites a third party to function as a parent to the child.Â  See In re E.L.M.C., 100 P.3d 546, 560 (Colo. Ct. App. 2004); see also Rubano v. DiCenzo, 759 A.2dÂ  959, 976 (R.I. 2000) (explaining that when a legal parent allows a third-party to assume a role equal to one of the childâ€™s two parents, she renders her own parental rights with respect to the minor child â€œless exclusive and less exclusoryâ€ than they otherwise would have been).Â  \r\nAs for the second prong, which considers whether the psychological parent and child have lived together, it further protects the legal parent by restricting the class of third-parties seeking parental rights.Â  Normally, the child, legal parent, and psychological parent have at one point, all resided together under the same roof.Â  However, we can conceive of a situation, as in this case, where the legal parent and the psychological parent operated under a sort of joint custody agreement where the child spends half the time at the legal parentâ€™s house.Â  The other half of the time is spent at the psychological parentâ€™s house, which the child also considers home.Â  This type of arrangement also suffices to meet the second part of the test. \r\nThe last two prongs are the most important because they ensure both that the psychological parent assumed the responsibilities of parenthood and that there exists a parent-child bond between the psychological parent and child. The psychological parent must undertake the obligations of parenthood by being affirmatively involved in the childâ€™s life.Â  The psychological parent must assume caretaking duties and provide emotional support for the child.Â  These duties, however, must be done for reasons other than financial gain, which guarantees that a paid babysitter or nanny cannot qualify for psychological parent status.Â  See In re E.L.M.C., 100 P.3d at 560 (citing Rubano, 759 A.2dÂ  at 976) (â€œThe additional elements further protect the legal parent against claims by neighbors, caretakers, babysitters, nannies, au pairs, nonparental relatives, and family friends.â€).Â  We further note that when both biological parents are involved in the childâ€™s life, a third partyâ€™s relationship with the child could never rise to the level of a psychological parent, as there is no parental void in the childâ€™s life.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the length of time the psychological parent acted in a parental capacity must be sufficient for a parent-child bond to have been established.Â  The existence of a parent-child bond â€œis simply not a court-bestowed determination . . . [t]he finding of the existence of such a bond reflects that the singular emotional and spiritual connection, ordinarily only expected in the relationship of a legal parent and child, has been created between an adult and childâ€ who have neither blood nor adoption between them.Â  Id. at 557 (Long, J., concurring).Â  Further, â€œinherent in the bond between child and psychological parent is the risk of emotional harm to the child should the relationship be curtailed or terminated.â€Â  In re E.L.M.C., 100 P.3d at 560.Â  South Carolina has long recognized the importance of the degree of attachment, echoed by other jurisdictions, between a child and a third-party in making a custody determination between a biological parent and the third party.Â  See Moore, 300 S.C. at 80-81, 386 S.E.2d at 459 (considering whether a psychological parent-child relationship exists in order to determine the degree of attachment); see also In re Clifford K., 619 S.E. at 157 (â€œThe resulting relationship between the psychological parent and the child must be of substantial, not temporary, duration and must have begun with the consent and encouragement of the childâ€™s legal parent or guardian.â€).Â  \r\nTurning to the facts here, the record is replete with evidence showing that Mother invited Middleton to act as a father.Â  Mother sent Middleton pictures of Josh as a baby and insinuated that he was Joshâ€™s father. Â When Josh was three years old, Mother and Middleton worked out a schedule whereby Middleton had Josh from Thursday through Sunday every week.Â  Middleton paid at least half of the daycare costs, and was listed as the emergency contact on the daycare registration.Â  Â Â \r\nAs Josh entered elementary school, it was Middleton rather than Mother who accompanied him to his first day of kindergarten, and it was Middleton who brought Josh to school almost every morning.Â  Middleton also picked up Josh from school nearly every day and accompanied Josh on school field trips.Â  Middleton took Josh to doctor and dentist appointments, and Josh attended family reunions and functions with Middleton.Â  Â Â \r\nFor the first ten years of his life, Josh spent a considerable amount of time with Middleton.Â  Mother cultivated this relationship by giving Middleton parental responsibilities and by allowing Josh to spend a significant amount of his childhood with Middleton.Â  In essence, Josh lived with Middleton at least half of the week for most of his life.Â  Mother, by ceding over a large part of her parental responsibilities to Middleton, fostered the parent-child bond between Middleton and Josh.\r\nThe second prong in the psychological parent test, that the child and psychological parent reside together, is also met.Â  The evidence shows Josh spent at least half of any given week residing with Middleton.Â  Additionally, Josh had his own room, clothes, and school books in Middletonâ€™s house.Â  \r\nWe also find Middleton assumed the obligations of parenthood by taking significant responsibility for Joshâ€™s care, education, and development. Middleton paid for Joshâ€™s preschool.Â  Additionally, he paid mother $250 dollars per month while Josh was in Motherâ€™s custody.Â  Although Middleton had not thought to keep receipts, he was able to document approximately $12,000 he had given Mother over the years.Â  Further, Middleton established a savings account for Joshâ€™s education.Â  \r\nMiddleton not only contributed financially to Joshâ€™s development, he also spent quality time with Josh.Â  On weekends they would go to movies and visit Frankieâ€™s Fun Park.Â  On Sundays, Middleton and Josh attended church.Â  Hollington, on the other hand, made no attempt to fulfill Joshâ€™s emotional need for a father.Â  In fact, other than seeing Josh one time when he was three days old, Hollington has never visited Josh.Â  This parental void left by Joshâ€™s biological father coupled with the parental obligations assumed by Middleton compel us to find that Middleton undertook the responsibilities necessary to meet the third prong of the psychological-parent test.\r\nAs to the fourth prong, the record reveals Josh spent ten years of his life thinking of Middleton as a father and is suffering greatly in his absence.Â  Dr. Newman, the court-appointed therapist, opined that Middleton is a psychological parent to Josh.Â  She stated that even though Josh has not seen Middleton in two years, he wanted her to tell the court that he misses Middleton and wants to see Middleton.Â  In her clinical opinion, the emotional attachment between Josh and Middleton is so strong that despite the passing of two yearsâ€™ time, Josh still feels a sense of loss.Â  According to Dr. Newman, the severance of the relationship between Middleton and Josh will have a profound, negative impact for the rest of his life.[3]Â  \r\nB. Compelling Circumstances \r\nIn declining to grant Middleton visitation, the family court stated: â€œWhen our law does not allow us to grant autonomous visitation to grandparents against the wishes of a fit parent, I donâ€™t know how we can grant autonomous visitation to an unrelated third party against the wishes of a fit parent.â€Â  While great deference is accorded to the visitation decisions made by a fit parent, the family court can in fact grant visitation to a third-party over a fit parentâ€™s objection when faced with compelling circumstances.\r\nIn Troxel v. Granville, the Supreme Court of the United States considered whether the application of the state of Washingtonâ€™s visitation statute violated Granvilleâ€™s due process right to make decisions concerning the custody, care, and control of her children.Â  530 U.S. 57 (2000).Â Â  The dispute in Troxel arose because Granville sought to limit her in-lawsâ€™ visitation to one visit per month and holidays.Â  Id. at 71. In turn, the grandparents sought visitation under a Washington statute that provided â€œany personâ€ could petition for visitation rights at â€œany time.â€Â  Id. at 61.Â  The grandparents did not rely on a common law de facto or psychological parent doctrine.Â  \r\nA plurality of the Court explained that parents have a protected liberty interest in the care, custody, and control of their children.Â  Id. at 65-66.Â  The plurality noted this fundamental right of parents encompasses the presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.Â  \r\nThe Supreme Court held Washingtonâ€™s visitation statute unconstitutionally infringed upon Granvilleâ€™s fundamental right to direct the upbringing of her children.Â  The statuteâ€™s language effectively allowed â€œany third party seeking visitation to subject any decision by a parent concerning visitation of the parentâ€™s children to state-court review,â€ and if the trial judge disagreed with the parentâ€™s determination of the childâ€™s best interest, the judgeâ€™s view would prevail.Â  Id. at 67.Â  The plurality noted the trial courtâ€™s order â€œwas not founded on any special factors that might justify the Stateâ€™s interference with Granvilleâ€™s fundamental right to make decisionsâ€ regarding her children.Â  Id. at 68.Â Â  \r\nThe plurality gave three reasons to support its conclusion that no â€œspecial factorsâ€ justified the Stateâ€™s interference in this case.Â  First, the grandparents did not allege that Granville was an unfit parent, and therefore Granville was presumed to have acted in the best interest of her children.Â  Id. at 68.Â  Second, the trial court did not give special weight to Granvilleâ€™s determination of what was in her childrenâ€™s best interest.Â  Id. at 69.Â  Third, Granville had not sought to cut off visitation entirely.Â Â  Notably, the plurality did not consider â€œwhether the Due Process Clause requires all nonparental visitation statutes to include a showing of harm or potential harm to the child as a condition precedent to granting visitation.â€Â  Id. at 73. The Court explained, â€œ[w]e do not, and need not, define today the precise scope of the parental due process right in the visitation context.â€Â  Id.Â  Thus, the Troxel decision, which turned on the constitutionality of the state of Washingtonâ€™s extremely liberal visitation statute, has little bearing on the peculiar facts of the case before us.\r\nWe find the decision by our own supreme court in Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 (2003), more pertinent to our determination of whether Middleton can be awarded visitation with Josh.Â  In Camburn, maternal grandparents successfully petitioned the family court for visitation of their daughterâ€™s three children over the objection of the childrenâ€™s mother and her husband.[4]Â  Despite uncontested evidence that the children were well-cared for by their mother and her husband, the family court found visitation would be in the childrenâ€™s best interest because their grandparents were a stabilizing factor in their lives. Mother and her husband appealed, and our supreme court reversed.Â  The Camburn court held: â€œBefore visitation may be awarded over a parentâ€™s objection, one of two evidentiary hurdles must be met: the parent must be shown to be unfit by clear and convincing evidence, or there must be evidence of compelling circumstances to overcome the presumption that the parental decision is in the childâ€™s best interest.â€Â  Id. at 579-80, 586 S.E.2d at 568.Â  As an example of a compelling circumstance, the Camburn court specifically mentioned a situation in which denying visitation would cause â€œsignificant harm to the child.â€Â  Id. at 579, 586 S.E.2d at 568. Ultimately, the supreme court found that the circumstances in Camburn were not compelling enough to justify awarding grandparents visitation of the three children in the face of their mother and her husbandâ€™s decision to the contrary.Â  \r\nHere, the record is replete with evidence illustrating how Motherâ€™s refusal to allow Middleton to visit with Josh has caused Josh significant harm.Â Â Â  After the separation, Joshâ€™s fourth grade teacher asked the schoolâ€™s guidance counselor to talk with Josh because â€œhe just wasnâ€™t himself [and] seemed really sad.â€Â  The guidance counselor testified that she arranged for Josh to attend a support group for children who have suffered from losing someone they love.Â  During these group sessions, Josh expressed grief over losing Middleton, who Josh talked about â€œas his father and his dad.â€Â  \r\nMotherâ€™s daughter, Tenille Johnson, testified about the special relationship Middleton had with Josh.Â  Since Joshâ€™s visitation with Middleton ended, Johnson testified that Josh â€œis not the same happy person that he used to beâ€ and that his attitude toward life has changed. \r\nDr. Newman, who counseled Josh for eighteen months prior to the final hearing, explained that the severance of Middletonâ€™s visitation with Josh â€œwill have a profound impact . . . [that] reverberates throughout life.â€Â  Dr. Newman further explained that Josh, who was ten years old when his relationship with Middleton abruptly ended, was particularly devastated by the loss because he was at a stage in life when he was learning how to socialize.Â  In the report she submitted to the court, Dr. Newman opined that Joshâ€™s loss of contact with Middleton rendered Josh â€œat-risk regarding his ability to trust, [and to] form and maintain close relationships.â€ \r\nSimilar to the testimony from Joshâ€™s teachers, counselor, and his sister, the court-appointed guardian ad litem reiterated: â€œ[T]he one thing that I can tell the Judge that I strongly believe is that Joshua Hollington loves Kenneth Middleton.Â  He misses Kenneth Middleton.Â  I have no doubt of that whatsoever.â€Â  The guardian testified that â€œthe separation of a year, year and a half had done nothing to lessen [Joshâ€™s] feelings there. . . . [S]ince [the relationship with Middleton] ended he is â€“ Iâ€™m not trained like Ms. Newman is.Â  I donâ€™t know the correct terms as far as grieving, but heâ€™s missing Mr. Middleton quite a bit.â€Â  Even Mother herself testified that she did not have â€œany doubt at all that Josh loves Kenneth MiddletonÂ  . . . [or] that Josh misses Kenneth Middleton.â€Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the overwhelming evidence in the record, we reverse the family courtâ€™s finding that Middleton was not Joshâ€™s psychological parent.Â  Middletonâ€™s absence from Joshâ€™s life has caused and will continue to cause significant harm to Josh.Â  Thus, the circumstances of this case are compelling enough to meet the â€œevidentiary hurdleâ€ third-parties must overcome when seeking visitation over the objection of a fit parent.Â  Camburn, at 579-80, 586 S.E.2d at 568.\r\nWe caution that our decision today does not automatically give a psychological parent the right to demand custody in a dispute between the legal parent and psychological parent.Â  The limited right of the psychological parent cannot usually overcome the legal parentâ€™s right to control the upbringing of his or her child.Â  See In re Clifford K., 619 S.E.2d 138, 157-58&nbsp;(W.Va. 2005) (noting that in â€œexceptional cases and subject to the courtâ€™s discretion, a psychological parent may intervene in a custody proceeding . . . when such intervention is likely to serve the best interest of the child(ren) . . . .â€) (emphasis added); see V.C., 748 A.2d at 554 (stating that custody is usually given to the legal parent, withÂ  â€œ[v]isitationâ€ as the â€œpresumptive ruleâ€ for psychological parents).\r\nEstablishing psychological parenthood is a difficult undertaking.Â  However, once established, the bond between the psychological parent and child should not be unilaterally severed by the biological parent who fostered the relationship in the first place.Â  The standard to be applied is whether compelling circumstances exist to overcome the presumption that a fit, legal parent acts in the childâ€™s best interest, and of course, visitation must actually be in the childâ€™s best interest.Â  The compelling circumstances standard encompasses a situation where, as here, a third party has attained psychological parent status.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the order of the family court and remand the action so that a suitable visitation schedule can be established as expeditiously as possible.Â  Because we find Josh is suffering from Middletonâ€™s absence, we order that visitation between Middleton and Josh resume on a schedule of one weekend per month, beginning in the month of May 2006, until a final hearing can be scheduled.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs and ANDERSON, J., concurs in result only in a separate opinion.\r\nANDERSON, J. (concurring in result only in a separate opinion):Â  In Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), the Supreme Court of the United States held that parents have a protected liberty interest in the care, custody and control of their children that is a fundamental right protected by the Due Process Clause.Â  This fundamental right encompasses the presumption that a fit parent will act in the best interest of his or her child.Â  I have gargantuan trepidation in regard to expanding Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 586 S.E.2d 565 (2003), and Moore v. Moore, 300 S.C. 75, 386 S.E.2d 456 (1989), beyond the actual holdings in these cases.\r\nI VOTE to ALLOW visitation in the case sub judice over the objection of the biological mother and would confine the holding to the unique factual circumstances in this particular case.\r\n\r\n[1] At trial, Middleton amended the complaint, seeking only visitation with Josh.Â  \r\n[2] Other than seeing Josh one time when Josh was three days old, Hollington has never visited Josh.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Additionally, Dr. Newman says that Josh knows he has a biological father, but does not sense a loss in not knowing him.Â  Joshâ€™s sense of loss is directly related to the loss of Middleton in his life. \r\n[4] Motherâ€™s husband was the biological father of one of the children the grandparents sought to visit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
