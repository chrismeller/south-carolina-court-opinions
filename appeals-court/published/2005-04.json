Clare, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:Â  Appellant, Brandi M. White a/k/a Brandi Michelle Wade, pled guilty to six counts of threatening a public official.Â  The trial judge sentenced White to six five-year terms, three of them to run consecutively and three of them to run concurrently.Â  White appeals, asserting error in the trial judgeâ€™s failure to order a medical examination to determine her competency.Â  We affirm.1\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWhite was indicted after she wrote a series of threatening letters to a probation officer and a detention center officer.Â  On March 5, 2004, White appeared before the circuit court and pled guilty on six indictments charging her with threatening a public official.Â  During the plea hearing, the trial court asked White if she had been treated for any mental or emotional disability, and White indicated that she had been treated for mental problems.Â  Whiteâ€™s attorney then explained White had been admitted to a psychiatric institution at least six times and that she had â€œa myriad of diagnoses which Dr. Morgan [would] elaborate on over the history of her life.â€Â  Counsel further indicated White had a history of bipolar disorder, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder, and that she was currently taking the medication â€œTegretol.â€Â  The court noted White had not been sent for an evaluation so they were not holding a Blair2 hearing, but questioned whether the Tegretol would prevent White from being able to understand what they were doing at the plea hearing.Â  The following colloquy then occurred:\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  No, Sir, not from my impressions and discussing the facts with her regarding the case, she had no difficulty understanding what she is facing or relaying to me what she actually did with respect to these charges.\r\n[Court]:Â  Well, as an attorney and having, you have very wisely gotten Dr. Morgan involved in this, but in your analysis of this matter have you ruled out any mental defenses?Â  Have you considered and/or . . . ruled out any mental defenses such as McNaughton or guilty but mentally ill?\r\n[Defense Counsel]:Â  In my opinion, your honor, they do not apply in this situation.\r\n\r\nAfter the solicitor placed the factual basis for Whiteâ€™s plea on the record, Whiteâ€™s attorney argued in mitigation that White was born with a condition that caused a shunt to be placed in her head and the shunt was â€œstill there today.â€Â  He again noted for the court that White had a history of mental health problems.Â  Counsel then presented Dr. Morgan, who had examined White and was given Whiteâ€™s mental health and neurological records.Â  \r\nDr. Morgan stated that White was born with water on the brain and that she had a shunt put in at several months of age to shunt the water from the brain.Â  She was followed by a neurosurgeon until July 1998, at which time it was discovered that part of the apparatus was embedded in the brain, but that it seemed to be working okay and â€œthey decided not to do anything to it at that time.â€Â  White failed to follow up with the neurosurgeon and Dr. Morgan was concernedÂ  because of the fact that White had begun to complain of headaches, which could be an indication of pressure building in the brain.Â  He stated, â€œSo I think there is some physical basis that may account for some of the behavior that weâ€™re observing here although it has not really been worked out very carefully.â€Â  Dr. Morgan also noted White had been in the Department of Mental Health on six different occasions and had been diagnosed with depression, bipolar disorder, alcohol and drug problems and post traumatic stress disorder.Â  He then concluded as follows:\r\n\r\nIn a situation like this you naturally wonder about the question you raised guilty by mentally ill, whether she can control her behavior, that maybe she couldnâ€™t and that sounds like what I am saying, but if you look at the behavior here and the letters and the context in which she explains those, there is a deliberateness about them, a sort of calculated plan here, because sheâ€™s basically happy where she is.Â  Sadly she says it is the best home Iâ€™ve ever had, and so I think a lot of this is to perpetuate a situation she finds herself more comfortable in than sheâ€™s ever had before from her observations. . . . So I donâ€™t think she fits the guilty but mentally ill even though in another circumstance I think that might be a logical assumption.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Whiteâ€™s attorney informed the court that he had represented White on a previous charge of threatening a public official for which she was currently incarcerated, and at that time he sent her for a mental health evaluation.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWhite appeals asserting the trial court abused its discretion by failing to order a medical examination to determine her competency to stand trial because she had a documented history of congenital brain damage and severe mental illness.Â  She argues, based on Dr. Morganâ€™s statements that the embedded shunt possibly accounted for some of her behavior and that she had received in-patient psychiatric care on at least six occasions, the courtâ€™s failure to order a mental examination for her was an abuse of discretion.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann Â§ 44-23-410 (2002) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nWhenever a judge of the Circuit Court or Family Court has reason to believe that a person on trial before him, charged with the commission of a criminal offense or civil contempt, is not fit to stand trial because the person lacks the capacity to understand the proceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as a result of a lack of mental capacity, the judge shall:\r\n(1)Â  order examination of the person by two examiners designated by the Department of Mental Health if the person is suspected of having a mental illness or designated by the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs if the person is suspected of being mentally retarded or having a related disability or by both sets of examiners if the person is suspected of having both mental illness and mental retardation or a related disability . . .Â Â  or\r\n(2)Â  order the person committed for examination and observation to an appropriate facility of the Department of Mental Health or the Department of Disabilities and Special Needs for a period not to exceed fifteen days. . . .\r\n\r\nâ€œThe statutory injunction, that an examination be ordered when the circuit judge â€˜has reason to believeâ€™ that a defendant is not mentally competent to stand trial, involves the exercise of the discretion of the trial judge in evaluating the facts presented on the question of competency.â€Â  State v. Drayton, 270 S.C. 582, 584, 243 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1978).Â  Thus, despite the mandatory language contained in Â§ 44-23-410, the decision of whether to order a competency examination is within the discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be overturned absent a clear showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Id.; State v. Weik, 356 S.C. 76, 83, 587 S.E.2d 683, 686 (2002); State v. Singleton, 322 S.C. 480, 483, 472 S.E.2d 640, 642 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  This is so, because the determination of whether there is â€œreason to believeâ€ a defendant lacks a certain mental capacity necessarily requires the exercise of discretion.Â  State v. Bradshaw, 269 S.C. 642, 644, 239 S.E.2d 652, 653 (1977).\r\nIn the case at hand, it is clear Whiteâ€™s counsel was aware of her previous mental health history, yet counsel informed the trial judge that White had no difficulty in either understanding what she was facing or in relaying to him what she actually did with respect to the charges.Â  When asked by the trial judge if he had ruled out any mental defenses, Whiteâ€™s counsel indicated that he had, because they did â€œnot apply in this situation.â€Â  Thereafter, Whiteâ€™s attorney presented Dr. Morgan, who had examined White.Â  Although Dr. Morgan expressed some concern that the embedded shunt might be a physical basis that may account for some of Whiteâ€™s behavior, he found Whiteâ€™s actions to be a deliberate and calculated plan to perpetuate a situation she found comfortable.Â  He then opined the guilty but mentally ill defense did not fit Whiteâ€™s situation.Â  Whiteâ€™s attorney then informed the court he had previously sent White for a mental health evaluation when he represented White on a prior charge of threatening a public official, for which she was incarcerated at the time of the plea hearing.\r\nBased on the record before us, we cannot find a clear abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s failure to order a competency examination for White.Â  See State v. Burgess, 356 S.C. 572, 575-76, 590 S.E.2d 42, 44 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding appellate court would not second guess trial judgeâ€™s denial of motion for psychiatric examination where defendant had not previously been adjudicated incompetent to stand trial, trial judge found defendantâ€™s demeanor during proceeding appeared appropriate, and the record showed defendant understood the proceedings, roles of participants and charges against her); State v. Bradley, 343 S.C. 461, 462-64, 539 S.E.2d 720, 721-22 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding, in light of evaluation of Department of Mental Health doctor concluding Bradley was not mentally retarded and functioned in a range of average intelligence, and that most of Bradleyâ€™s answers were purposely vague, involving â€œsome skill . . . to do . . . consistently,â€ trial judgeâ€™s failure to direct further examination to determine Bradleyâ€™s competency did not constitute an abuse of discretion); State v. Drayton, 270 S.C. 582, 584, 243 S.E.2d 458, 459 (1978) (wherein Supreme Court held trial judgeâ€™s failure to sua sponte order examination of defendant to determine competency did not violate Â§ 44-23-410 nor deprive defendant of due process where trial judge had before him the order of the previous presiding judge finding, about two and one-half months earlier, that defendant was at that time fit to stand trial, while contending that defendant was not competent to stand trial, his counsel clearly refused to demand a further competency hearing, and record failed to show additional facts warranting further examination of defendant).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1 We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2 State v.

Breeden, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3974\r\nHeard March 8, 2005 â€“ Filed April 11, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJill Wright Fennel, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\nJohn H. Tiller and Elizabeth Applegate Dieck, both of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Christine McCune brought an action for negligence and strict liability against the Myrtle Beach Indoor Shooting Range (the Range) for injuries sustained while she was participating in a paintball game.[1]Â  McCune appeals from the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to the Range.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Range offers paintball games and allows participants to rent protective equipment, including face masks, provided by the Range.Â Â McCune participated in a paintball match with her husband and friends.Â  She utilized a mask provided by the Range.Â  Prior to being allowed to participate, McCune signed a general waiver.Â  The waiver released the Range from liability from all known or unknown dangers for any reason with the exception of gross negligence on the part of the Range.\r\nDuring her play, the mask was loose and ill fitting.Â  She attempted to have the mask tightened or replaced on several occasions and an employee of the Range attempted to properly fit the mask for McCune.Â  While playing in a match, McCune caught the mask on the branch of a tree.Â  The tree was obscured from her field of vision by the top of the mask.Â  The mask was raised off her face because it was loose, and provided no protection against an incoming paintball pellet.Â  The pellet struck McCune in the eye, rendering her legally blind in the eye.\r\nMcCune brought suit, alleging causes of action for negligence and strict liability based on the failure of the mask to properly be fitted and protect her during play.Â  The Range filed an answer asserting the waiver released them from all liability as a result of the paintball striking McCune.Â  Additionally, it asserted McCuneâ€™s comparative negligence barred recovery.\r\nSubsequently, the Range filed a motion for summary judgment, again alleging the waiver and McCuneâ€™s comparative negligence barred recovery.Â  The court granted the Rangeâ€™s motion, finding the waiver was sufficient to show McCune expressly assumed the risks associated with playing paintball.Â  Additionally, the court found her overwhelming comparative fault barred recovery.Â  The trial court subsequently denied McCuneâ€™s motion for reconsideration.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court:Â  summary judgment is proper when â€œthere is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 491, 575 S.E.2d 549, 552 (2003) (â€œSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€).Â  â€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.â€Â  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).Â  â€œOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non&#8209;moving party below.â€Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 7, 550 S.E.2d 319, 321 (2001).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n McCune maintains the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to the Range on the basis of the exculpatory language in the release of liability signed by McCune.Â  McCune asserts she did not anticipate the harm that was inflicted or the manner in which it occurred.Â  Additionally, she contends the failure of the equipment was unexpected and she could not have voluntarily assumed such a risk.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs an initial matter, we must determine whether this is a case involving express assumption or implied assumption of the risk.Â  Express assumption of the risk sounds in contract and occurs when the parties agree beforehand, â€œeither in writing or orally, that the plaintiff will relieve the defendant of his or her legal duty toward the plaintiff.â€Â  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Prop. Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 79-80, 508 S.E.2d 565, 569-70 (1998).Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œExpress assumption of risk is contrasted with implied assumption of risk which arises when the plaintiff implicitly, rather than expressly, assumes known risks.Â  As noted above, implied assumption of risk is characterized as either primary or secondary.â€Â  Id. at 80-81, 508 S.E.2d at 570.Â  â€œ[P]rimary implied assumption of risk is but another way of stating the conclusion that a plaintiff has failed to establish a prima facie case [of negligence] by failing to establish that a duty exists.â€Â  Id. at 81, 508 S.E.2d at 570 (quoting Perez v. McConkey, 872 S.W.2d 897, 902 (Tenn. 1994)).Â  â€œSecondary implied assumption of risk, on the other hand, arises when the plaintiff knowingly encounters a risk created by the defendantâ€™s negligence.â€Â  Id. at 82, 508 S.E.2d at 571.\r\nIn the instant case, we are confronted with a defense based upon McCuneâ€™s express assumption of the risk.Â  She signed a release from liability prior to participating in the paintball match.Â  As acknowledged by Davenport, the courts of South Carolina have analyzed express assumption of the risk cases in terms of exculpatory contracts.Â  Id. at 80, 508 S.E.2d at 570.Â Â Â Â  \r\nExculpatory contracts, such as the one in this case, have previously been upheld by the courts of this state.Â  See Huckaby v. Confederate Motor Speedway, Inc., 276 S.C. 629, 630, 281 S.E.2d 223, 224 (1981) (finding plaintiffâ€™s action against speedway for injuries sustained during a race was barred by â€œwaiver and releaseâ€ voluntarily signed by plaintiff prior to entering the race track); Pride v. Southern Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 244 S.C. 615, 619-22, 138 S.E.2d 155, 157-58 (1964) (holding it was not violative of public policy for telephone company to legally limit its liability by contract for negligence in the publication of a paid advertisement in the yellow pages of its telephone directory).Â  â€œHowever, notwithstanding the general acceptance of exculpatory contracts, â€˜[s]ince such provisions tend to induce a want of care, they are not favored by the law and will be strictly construed against the party relying thereon.â€™â€Â  Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 295, 584 S.E.2d 149, 152 (Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Pride, 244 S.C. at 619, 138 S.E.2d at 157).Â  This court has explained:\r\n\r\nCommon sense and good faith are the leading touchstones of the construction of a contract and contracts are to be so construed as to avoid an absurd result.Â  Where one construction would make a contract unusual or extraordinary and another, equally consistent, would make the contract reasonable, fair and just, the latter construction will prevail.Â Â  \r\n\r\nGeorgetown Mfg. &amp; Warehouse Co. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Agric., 301 S.C. 514, 518, 392 S.E.2d 801, 804 (Ct. App. 1990) (citing C.A.N. Enters., Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 296 S.C. 373, 373 S.E.2d 584 (1988)).\r\nContracts that seek to exculpate a party from liability for the partyâ€™s own negligence are not favored by the law.Â  Pride, 244 S.C. at 619, 138 S.E.2d at 157.Â  An exculpatory clause, our supreme court has held, is to be strictly construed against the party relying thereon.Â  Id.Â  An exculpatory clause will never be construed to exempt a party from liability for his own negligence â€œâ€˜in the absence of explicit language clearly indicating that such was the intent of the parties.â€™â€Â  South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Combustion Engâ€™g, Inc., 283 S.C. 182, 191, 322 S.E.2d 453, 458 (Ct. App. 1984) (quoting Hill v. Carolina Freight Carriers Corp., 71 S.E.2d 133, 137 (N.C. 1952)).\r\nThe release in the instant case explicitly and unambiguously limited the Rangeâ€™s liability.Â  Specifically, McCune signed the release, thereby acknowledging the following pertinent clauses:\r\n\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  The risk of injury from the activity and weaponry involved in paintball is significant, including the potential for permanent disability and death, and while particular protective equipment and personal discipline will minimize this risk, the risk of serious injury does exist;\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  I KNOWINGLY AND FREELY ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS, both known and unknown, EVEN IF ARISING FROM THE NEGLIGENCE of those persons released from liability below, and assume full responsibility for my participation; and,\r\n. . . \r\n4.Â Â Â Â Â Â  I, for myself and on behalf of my heirs . . . HEREBY RELEASE AND HOLD HARMLESS THE AMERICAN PAINTBALL LEAGUE (APL), THE APL CERTIFIED MEMBER FIELD, the owners and lessors of premises used to conduct the paintball activities, their officers, officials, agents, and/or employees (â€œReleaseesâ€), WITH RESPECT TO ANY AND ALL INJURY, DISABILITY, DEATH, or loss or damage to person or property, WHETHER CAUSED BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE RELEASEES OR OTHERWISE, except that which is the result of gross negligence and/or wanton misconduct.\r\n. . . \r\nI HAVE READ THIS RELEASE OF LIABILITY AND ASSUMPTION OF RISK AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTANDING ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY SIGNING IT, AND SIGN IT FREELY AND VOLUNTARILY WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT.\r\n\r\nThe agreement is then signed by McCune and dated the date of the incident.\r\nThe above agreement is sufficient to limit the liability of the Range to McCune.Â  The agreement was voluntarily signed and specifically stated:Â  (1) she assumed the risks, whether known or unknown; and (2) she released the Range from liability, even from injuries sustained because of the Rangeâ€™s own negligence.Â  It is clear McCune voluntarily entered into the release in exchange for being allowed to participate in the paintball match.Â  \r\nAdditionally, she expressly assumed the risk for all known and unknown risks while participating and cannot now complain because she did not fully appreciate the exact risk she faced.Â  â€œExcept where he expressly so agrees, a plaintiff does not assume a risk of harm arising from the defendantâ€™s conduct unless he then knows of the existence of the risk and appreciates its unreasonable character.â€Â  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 496D (1965) (emphasis added).\r\nWe find the release entered into by the parties does not contravene public policy.Â  In Huckaby, the plaintiff signed a waiver similar to the one above, which was required before he could participate in a sanctioned automobile race.Â  He maintained his injuries were caused by the speedwayâ€™s faulty installation and maintenance of a guardrail.Â  Huckaby, 276 S.C. at 630, 281 S.E.2d at 223.Â  As was found in Huckaby, participation in a paintball match is voluntary.Â  â€œâ€˜If these agreements, voluntarily entered into, were not upheld, the effect would be to increase the liability of those organizing or sponsoring such events to such an extent that no one would be willing to undertake to sponsor a sporting event.Â  Clearly, this would not be in the public interest.â€™â€Â  Huckaby, 276 S.C. at 631, 281 S.E.2d at 224 (quoting Gore v. Tri-County Raceway, Inc., 407 F. Supp. 489, 492 (M.D. Ala. 1974)).Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the instant case to be distinguishable from this courtâ€™s decision in Fisher v. Stevens, 355 S.C. 290, 584 S.E.2d 149 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In Fisher, the plaintiff worked on a wrecker crew at the Speedway of South Carolina.Â  In order to work at the Speedway, Fisher was required to sign a release and waiver of liability.Â  During a race, the wrecker on which Fisher was working responded to a crash.Â  While the wrecker was moving towards one of the vehicles, Fisher, who was riding on the back of the wrecker, fell off and suffered severe head injuries.Â  Through a guardian, Fisher brought suit alleging negligence, gross negligence, and recklessness against the driver and the owner of the wrecker as well as the Speedway.Â  The defendants raised the Release as an affirmative defense.Â  All parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, alleging the Release acted as a complete bar to Fisherâ€™s claims.Â  The circuit court judge granted partial summary judgment to Fisher against the driver and the owner of the wrecker on the ground the Release, as a matter of law, did not bar Fisherâ€™s claims.Â  Additionally, the court denied summary judgment to the Speedway.Â  The court found an issue of material fact existed as to whether Fisher was an employee of the Speedway.Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, the driver and the owner of the wrecker argued the circuit court erred in finding the Release was inapplicable to them.Â  Specifically, they contended they were released from liability given the Release encompassed â€œVEHICLE OWNERS, DRIVERS, [and] . . . ANY PERSONS IN ANY RESTRICTED AREA.â€Â  Id. at 294, 584 S.E.2d at 151-52.Â  In analyzing this issue, we found the Release, an exculpatory contract, was ambiguous because the terms, â€œdriverâ€ and â€œvehicle ownerâ€ were â€œterms of art [which were] not used to identify any owner or driver of any vehicle.â€Â  Id. at 295, 584 S.E.2d at 152.Â Â  Additionally, we agreed with the circuit court that the phrase â€œANY PERSONS IN ANY RESTRICTED AREAâ€ did not relieve the driver and the owner of the wrecker of liability on the ground it was overly broad and, thus, in contravention of public policy.Â  Because the contract â€œdid not clearly inform Fisher he would be waiving all claims due to the [driverâ€™s and vehicle ownerâ€™s negligence], we held the driver and the vehicle owner could not be released from liability â€œbased on the broad â€˜catch-allâ€™ phrase.â€Â  Id. at 298, 584 S.E.2d at 153. \r\nIn contrast, the release in the case at bar is neither ambiguous nor overbroad.Â  In fact, McCune in her deposition characterized the release as a â€œstandard waiver.â€Â  Although our research reveals no South Carolina case that deals specifically with a release for paintball, other jurisdictions have found similarly worded releases to be unambiguous.Â  See Taylor v. Hesser, 991 P.2d 35, 38 (Okla. Civ. App. 1998) (affirming grant of summary judgment to operators of paintball facility and shooter where plaintiff, who was injured during the paintball game, signed a release prior to participating); Kaltenbach v. Splatball, Inc., No. C7-99-235, 1999 WL 690191, at *2 (Minn. Ct. App. 1999) (finding paintball participant was precluded from recovering against owner of a paintball facility for injuries where participant signed a release of ownerâ€™s liability).\r\nWe would also note that unlike the release in Fisher, the release signed by McCune did not preclude recovery for a cause of action involving gross negligence.[2]Â  Thus, this opinion should not be construed as creating an indefensible position for all injuries sustained during inherently dangerous recreational activities.Â  Cf. Adams v. Roark, 686 S.W.2d 73, 75-76 (Tenn. 1985) (recognizing, in an action to recover for injuries sustained by a motorcyclist at a drag way, that an agreement to contract against liability for gross negligence is unenforceable); Murphy v. N. Am. River Runners, Inc., 412 S.E.2d 504, 510 (W.Va. 1991) (stating, in an action to recover for injuries sustained during a whitewater rafting accident, â€œa general clause in a pre-injury exculpatory agreement or anticipatory release purporting to exempt a defendant from all liability for any future loss or damage will not be construed to include the loss or damage resulting from the defendantâ€™s intentional or reckless misconduct or gross negligence, unless the circumstances clearly indicate that such was the plaintiffâ€™s intentionâ€).\r\nAccordingly, we hold the trial court properly determined the release signed by McCune was sufficient to release the Range from all liability in this incident.Â  Therefore, the decision of the trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Brass Eagle, Inc., was also named in the action as the manufacturer of the mask McCune alleged was defective or in poor operating condition.Â  McCune and Brass Eagle settled the suit and Brass Eagle is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[2]Â  Neither in her brief nor at oral argument did McCune assert that the Rangeâ€™s actions constituted gross negligence.Â  Instead, she acknowledged at oral argument that the Range operated with at least slight care by attempting to properly adjust the mask to McCune.Â  See ClyburnÂ  v. Sumter County Sch. Dist. No. 17, 317 S.C. 50, 53, 451 S.E.2d 885, 887 (1994)(â€œGross negligence is the intentional, conscious failure to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing intentionally that one ought not to do.â€); Faile v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Juvenile Justice, 350 S.C. 315, 331-32, 566 S.E.2d 536, 544 (2002) (stating gross negligence â€œis the failure to exercise even the slightest careâ€).\r\n[3] As we have affirmed the courtâ€™s decision based upon its analysis of the exculpatory contract, we need not determine whether McCuneâ€™s claim would also be barred because her negligence was greater than that of the Range.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3975","title":"Joyner v.

Roberts, of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJohn A. Sowards, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  C. Dan Joyner appeals the master-in-equityâ€™s order granting summary judgment to Greenville Hotel Associates Limited Partnership (â€œGHALPâ€).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nThe facts in the case are not disputed.Â  Joyner owned property adjacent to a hotel in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  He leased the property in 1971 to the Watkins, owners of the hotel, for use as an additional parking lot.Â  The lease was for a period of forty years, limited rent to $750 per month, and provided that the lease was binding upon the Watkinsâ€™ â€œrespective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns.â€Â  The lease was amended in 1983, assigned to a subsequent owner of the hotel in 1995, and further assigned to a new owner, Stewart Mac Investments, LLC, in 1999.Â  All of the assignments of the lease agreement were recorded with the deed to the hotel property.Â  Stewart Mac Investments stopped paying rent in September 1999.Â Â  \r\nStewart Mac Investments defaulted on the mortgage for the hotel with GHALP, and a foreclosure action was instituted in June 2000.Â  The order granting the foreclosure noted that the property was â€œ[t]ogether with all right, title and interest of the Mortgagor in and to that certain Lease executed by and between C. Dan Joyner, Lessor, and Robert L. Watkins and Tamara A. Watkins, Lessees . . . .â€Â  GHALP purchased the hotel property, and the description of the property in the masterâ€™s deed included the above-quoted language that the property included the right to or interest in the lease with Joyner.[2]Â  The masterâ€™s deed also provided that the hotel property was purchased subject to a first mortgage with BB&amp;T bank.Â  GHALP, however, never signed a lease assignment or lease agreement with Joyner.Â  GHALP never paid rent, or Stewart Mac Investmentsâ€™ arrears, to Joyner.Â Â  \r\nJoyner brought an action against GHALP for breach of the lease agreement, breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and for a declaratory judgment.Â  Joyner sought the unpaid rent, the arrearages allegedly assumed when GHALP obtained the property from Stewart Mac Investments, punitive damages for bad faith, and costs and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  GHALP answered, denying that it had assumed the lease when it obtained the property. \r\nBoth parties moved for summary judgment.Â  Citing the dissent in the mortgage assignment case of Allgood v. Spearman, 125 S.C. 131, 118 S.E. 189 (1923) as valid law, GHALP argued that although it bought the property subject to the lease agreement: a separate assignment agreement with Joyner was never signed; the extra parking lot was never used; GHALP chose not to pay the rent; and GHALP could not be held personally responsible for a lease agreement to which it was not a party.Â  The master-in-equity found that although the deed to GHALP indicated that it was taking the property subject to the lease with Joyner, the language â€œin no way personally obligated [GHALP] on the Lease.â€Â  The master found that GHALP never signed anything or â€œexhibited any conduct such as occupying the premises, making lease payments, et cetera, that would indicate any basis for the Courtâ€™s imposing liability on it.â€Â  The master granted summary judgment to GHALP, denied summary judgment to Joyner, and Joynerâ€™s motion for reconsideration was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and it is clear the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  If further inquiry into the facts is necessary to clarify application of the law, summary judgment is not appropriate.Â  Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).Â  â€œSummary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those facts.â€Â  Id.Â  The evidence and the inferences therefrom must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJoyner argues the master erroneously relied upon the dissent in Allgood v. Spearman, 125 S.C. 131, 118 S.E. 189 (1923), and the â€œflawed arguments of counselâ€ in granting summary judgment to GHALP.Â  Joyner asserts that the lease agreement was binding upon GHALP because:Â  (1) the lease agreement provided it was binding upon the successors at interest; and (2) the property description in the GHALPâ€™s deed described the property as subject to the lease agreement.Â  Thus, Joyner argues, summary judgment should have been granted to Joyner, not GHALP.[3]\r\nAlthough we can find no cases directly on point, GHALP cited Allgood as similar to the present case.Â  In Allgood, W.D. Spearman signed five promissory notes to E.F. Allgood for $5,203.87 each and secured by a mortgage on four tracts of land owned by Spearman.Â  Spearman later sold the land to R.B. Sheck, and then Spearman defaulted on the mortgage.Â  When Allgood attempted to foreclose on the property, Spearman asserted that Sheck assumed the obligation for the mortgage when he purchased the property.Â  The Allgood court affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s holding that Sheck assumed the debt when he purchased the land:Â  \r\n\r\nâ€œThere can be no doubt at this day that where the purchaser of land encumbered by a mortgage agrees to pay a particular sum as purchase money, and on the execution of the contract of purchase the amount of the mortgage is deducted from the consideration, and the land conveyed subject to the mortgage, that the purchaser is bound to pay the mortgage debt, whether he agreed to do so by express words or not.Â  This obligation results necessarily from the very nature of the transaction.Â  Having accepted the land subject to the mortgage, and kept back enough of the vendorâ€™s money to pay it, it is only common honesty that he should be required either to pay the mortgage or stand primarily liable for it.â€Â  \r\n\r\nAllgood, 125 S.C. at 134, 118 S.E. at 189 (quoting Dargan v. McSween, 33 S.C. 338, 11 S.E. 1081 (1890)).Â  The dissenting judge in Allgood disagreed, citing treatises to the effect that: â€œâ€˜In the absence of a special agreement to assume the mortgage or words in the grant importing in some form that he assumes the payment of it, the purchaser is not personally liable for it.â€™â€Â  Id. at 138, 118 S.E. at 191 (quoting 1 Jones Mtg. (6th Ed.), 750).\r\nThe fact that GHALP bought the property subject to the lease is not disputed.Â  The only question is whether GHALP may be bound by that language in the lease and be held personally liable.Â  Although the majority opinion in Allgood appears to have implied an assumption of the debt by the purchaser, the present situation is clearly different from the one in Allgood. In Allgood the mortgage encumbered the purchased property and the purchaser deducted the mortgage balance from the purchase price.Â  The lease in question was not an encumbrance on the hotel property that GHALP purchased; the lease involved an adjacent parcel. Â \r\nThe lease was a contract between the Watkins and Joyner, and later, between Joyner and subsequent owners who agreed to accept assignment of the lease.Â  The lease provided that it would be effective upon the lesseeâ€™s heirs and assigns.Â  However, GHALP did not expressly or impliedly assume the lease.Â  GHALP did not assume the lease by merely accepting the property subject to the contract between Joyner and the Watkinsâ€™ assignees.Â  â€œOne who accepts a conveyance subject to a lien or claim does not assume by such acceptance the obligation to discharge the lien or satisfy the claim.â€Â  77 Am.Jur.2d Vendor and Purchaser Â§ 406 (1997); see County of Albany v. Albany County Indus. Dev. Agency, 218 A.D.2d 435, 437 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996) (noting the well-settled rule that one who accepts a conveyance â€œsubject toâ€ a lien or claim does not assume by such acceptance the obligation to discharge the lien or satisfy the claim).Â  Absent an indication from GHALP that it agreed to be bound to the lease with Joyner, such as signing an assignment or exercising the duties and rights under the lease, GHALP has no legal obligation to Joyner.Â  Without a contract between the parties, expressed or implied, the relationship of landlord and tenant cannot exist.Â  Stewart-Jones Co. v. Shehan, 127 S.C. 451, 457, 121 S.E 374, 376 (1924). \r\nEven viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Joyner, nothing indicates GHALP separately agreed to be bound by the lease when it purchased the hotel property.Â  Accordingly, the master-in-equityâ€™s order granting summary judgment to GHALP is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.Â  \r\n[2]Â  The master later determined that this language meant that GHALP took the property â€œsubject toâ€ the lease agreement.Â  This finding is unappealed.Â  \r\n[3]Â  It is well-settled that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003).Â  Thus we decline to address Joynerâ€™s argument that the master erred by failing to grant him summary judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3976","title":"Mackela v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3976\r\nSubmitted March 1, 2005 â€“ Filed April 18, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jennifer L. Queen, of Summerville, for Appellant.Â  \r\n        David Charles Alford, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this action for conversion, the jury returned a verdict in favor of Don Mackela in the amount of $13,320.23 plus interest in actual damages and $50,000 in punitive damages against Automotive Finance Corporation (AFC).Â  AFC appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\n\r\n  FACTS\r\n  In September 2001, Mackela owned a 1999 Dodge Grand Caravan.Â  Mackela sought to purchase a second vehicle from James Bentley, d/b/a Lyman Auto Sales.Â  Bentley allowed Mackela to park the Dodge on Bentleyâ€™s used car lot and agreed to assist Mackela in the sale of the vehicle.Â  Mackela retained title to the Dodge.Â  \r\n\r\nBentley unlocked and showed the Dodge to potential buyers, but was not authorized to negotiate its sale.Â  Although Bentley assumed he would receive some compensation if he sold the Dodge, Mackela and Bentley had no agreement regarding a price or a commission for Bentley.Â  Mackela periodically checked on the vehicle from September 2001 to January 2002 and never noticed any stickers or other papers indicating Bentley was advertising the car.Â  \r\nAFC financed Bentleyâ€™s purchases of new vehicles as the floor planner of Lyman Auto Sales.Â  As part of the note, guaranty, and security agreement between Bentley and AFC, Bentley granted AFC a security interest in â€œ[a]ll now owned or hereafter acquired inventory.â€Â  Bentley defaulted on the AFC note.Â  AFC served a warrant of attachment on Bentley and attached forty-two vehicles from Bentleyâ€™s lot, including Mackelaâ€™s Dodge.Â  Mackela filed this action against AFC and James Bentley, d/b/a Lyman Auto Sales, alleging conversion and seeking actual and punitive damages.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Mackela testified he called AFC to retrieve the Dodge after the attachment.Â  When Mackela explained his ownership, the AFC representative said AFC took the Dodge because â€œit was there.â€Â  The representative further told Mackela that AFC would not return the Dodge unless Mackela â€œpaid for it.â€Â  Mackela explained:Â  â€œIâ€™m already paying for it.â€Â  The representative replied:Â  â€œWell, youâ€™re going to have to pay for it again if you want to take it.Â  We wonâ€™t give you a release.â€Â  When the finance company that held Mackelaâ€™s note on the Dodge learned of the attachment, it refused further payments by Mackela and ultimately a judgment was entered against Mackela for approximately $13,000.Â  \r\nBentley testified at trial that only fifty percent of the vehicles taken by AFC were Lyman Auto Sales inventory.Â  The remaining vehicles, like Mackelaâ€™s Dodge, were not owned by Lyman Auto Sales.Â  Bentley explained that he attempted â€œon several occasionsâ€ to retrieve the vehicles from AFC but AFC refused to return the vehicles and the owners were forced to â€œget them back through different court orders.â€Â  \r\nAFC moved for a directed verdict on the ground that AFC was acting within its legal rights as to its collateral when it took control of Mackelaâ€™s vehicle.Â  The trial court denied AFCâ€™s motion.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of Bentley and against AFC.Â  The jury awarded Mackela actual damages of $13,320.23 plus interest and $50,000 in punitive damages.[2]Â  The trial court denied AFCâ€™s post-trial motion for new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  AFC appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOn appeal from the denial of a motion for directed verdict, the appellate court may reverse only if no evidence supports the circuit court&rsquo;s ruling. Steinke v. South Carolina Dep&rsquo;t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999). Credibility issues and conflicts in testimony are for the jury. Garrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 99, 419 S.E.2d 842, 845 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nI.Â  Conversion \r\nAFC argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict on Mackelaâ€™s conversion claim and its post-trial motion for new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.Â  We disagree.\r\nA plaintiff claiming conversion may prevail based upon a showing of unauthorized detention of property, after demand.Â  The plaintiff must show either title or right to possession of the property at the time of conversion.Â  Oxford Fin. Cos. v. Burgess, 303 S.C. 534, 539, 402 S.E.2d 480, 482 (1991).Â  A plaintiffâ€™s claim for conversion fails where the defendant proves a legal right to the property.Â  Kirby v. Horne Motor Co., 295 S.C. 7, 11, 366 S.E.2d 259, 261-62 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nAFC asserts it had a legal right to Mackelaâ€™s vehicle because of a valid security interest in Bentleyâ€™s inventory.Â  Specifically, AFC alleges Mackelaâ€™s vehicle was collateral under the AFC-Bentley security agreement because the vehicle was on Bentleyâ€™s lot as a consignment item.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder section 36-9-102 of the South Carolina Code, â€œcollateralâ€ includes â€œgoods that are the subject of a consignment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(12)(C) (2003).Â  The Code defines â€œconsignmentâ€ as â€œa transaction, regardless of its form, in which a person delivers goods to a merchant for the purpose of sale.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(20) (2003).Â  However, goods that are â€œconsumer goods immediately before deliveryâ€ are specifically excluded from the statutory definition of consignment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(20)(C) (2003).Â  â€œConsumer goodsâ€ are defined as â€œgoods that are used or bought for use primarily for personal, family, or household purposes.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(23) (2003).Â  \r\nMackela testified he purchased the Dodge for his personal use, including the transportation of his wife to cancer treatments.Â  We find the Dodge thus meets the statutory definition of a consumer good.Â  Because the Dodge was a consumer good, it is excluded from the statutory definition of a consignment and AFCâ€™s argument that it was collateral as a consignment fails.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-102(20) (2003).Â  We find ample evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of AFCâ€™s directed verdict motion and post-trial motion for new trial or judgment notwithstanding the verdict.\r\nII.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nRelying exclusively on Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, 406 S.E.2d 350 (1991), AFC argues the trial court erred in affirming the juryâ€™s award of punitive damages.Â  We disagree.\r\nPunitive damages are recoverable in conversion cases if the defendantâ€™s acts have been willful, reckless, and/or committed with conscious indifference to the rights of others.Â  Oxford, 303 S.C. at 539, 402 S.E.2d at 482.Â  The amount of damages, actual or punitive, remains largely within the discretion of the jury, as reviewed by the circuit court.Â  Gamble, 305 S.C. at 112, 406 S.E.2d at 355.Â  Only when the circuit courtâ€™s discretion is abused, amounting to an error of law, does it become the duty of the appellate court to set aside the award.Â  Id.[3]\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court enumerated eight factors to consider in determining whether a juryâ€™s award of punitive damages is proper:Â  (1) the defendantâ€™s degree of culpability; (2) the duration of the conduct; (3) the defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar past conduct; (5) the likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to result from such conduct; (7) the defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and finally, (8) â€œother factorsâ€ deemed appropriate.Â  Gamble, 305 S.C. at 111-12, 406 S.E.2d at 354.Â  \r\nIn its order, the trial court specifically addressed each of the Gamble factors, finding AFCâ€™s conduct in this matter warranted the award of punitive damages.Â  AFC admitted at trial that at the time it executed the writ of attachment, none of the vehicles on Bentleyâ€™s lot were listed in the floor plan agreement.Â  AFC ultimately returned numerous of the vehicles seized.Â  The actions of AFC deprived Mackela of the use of his vehicle for eighteen months.Â  AFC had other suits filed against it alleging similar conduct.Â  The punitive damages award is just over three times the actual damages and is less than the $80,000 AFC claimed due from its account with Bentley.Â  \r\nWe find the trial court expressly considered the Gamble factors in its review of the punitive damages award and made appropriate findings of fact as to each factor.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] On the Form 4 Order, the award is stated as $13,325.23.Â  However, the trial courtâ€™s written order calculating the total award including interest cites the award as $13,320.23. \r\n[3] AFC neither requests us to nor suggests that we must conduct a de novo review of the award of punitive damages in this case pursuant to Cooper Indus., Inc. v. Leatherman Tool Group, Inc., 532 U.S. 424 (2001) and State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408 (2003).Â  We therefore limit our review to the trial courtâ€™s Gamble review.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3977","title":"Smith v.

Macaulay, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3977\r\nHeard January 10, 2005 â€“ Filed April 18, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Steven M. Krause and Daniel L.

Moore, Jr., of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This appeal stems from a tort action Becky Todd Smith brought against Tracy Lee Moore pursuant to a car accident between the two parties.Â  United Services Automobile Association (USAA), the insurance carrier for Becky Todd Smith and Barry Smith, moved to be dismissed from the case, arguing that Becky Todd Smith, who was listed as an â€œoperatorâ€ on the declarations page but was not the named insured, could not stack underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage.Â  The trial court granted USAAâ€™s motion.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe automobile accident that prompted this litigation occurred in September of 2000 in Oconee County.Â  A vehicle owned by Ola A. Moore and operated by Tracey Lee Moore turned left in front of a vehicle operated by Becky Todd Smith.Â Â  The Smiths brought an action against the Moores for injuries and damages resulting from the accident.Â  \r\nTracey Lee Mooreâ€™s liability is undisputed.Â Â  Her vehicle was insured by Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company, which tendered the liability limits on its policy and is not a subject of this appeal.[1]Â Â  The vehicle Becky Todd Smith was driving was insured by USAA under a policy issued to Betty Gillispie Washnok, who owned the vehicle.Â  Smith was driving the vehicle with Washnokâ€™s permission.Â Â  \r\nWashnok treated Smith as if she were her daughter and served as her guardian, though it is unclear whether a legal adoption ever took place.Â  At the time of the accident, however, Smith no longer resided with Washnok.Â  \r\nWashnok owned two vehicles, both of which were insured through USAA.Â  Although Washnok was the named insured, Smith was listed as an â€œoperator.â€Â Â  The term â€œoperatorâ€ is not defined in the policy.Â  \r\nBecause Smith was driving the vehicle with Washnokâ€™s permission, she was entitled to UIM coverage as a permissive user.Â Â  USAA paid one level of UIM benefits under a covenant not to execute.Â  Smithâ€™s injuries were extensive, however, and the damages she incurred exceeded the first level of UIM benefits.Â  Thus, Smith sought to stack UIM coverage from Washnokâ€™s other vehicle.Â Â  \r\nUSAA moved to be dismissed from the case, arguing that Smith was not a Class I insured, and therefore was not entitled to stack UIM coverage.Â  After a hearing, the trial court granted USAAâ€™s motion. Â This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nRule 41(b), SCRCP, allows a defendant to move for dismissal in cases tried without a jury on the ground that â€œupon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no right to relief.â€Â  See Silvester v. Spring Valley Country Club, 344 S.C. 280, 284, 543 S.E.2d 563, 565 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  Because a dismissal under these circumstances has the same effect as summary judgment, the standard for summary judgment applies.Â  Id. at 284-85, 543 S.E.2d at 566. \r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Id. at 285, 543 S.E.2d at 566.Â  In ruling on a motion for summary judgment, this court must view all evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAt issue in this case is whether an insured who is listed on the policy as an â€œoperatorâ€ can stack UIM coverage.Â  In South Carolina, only Class I insureds can stack coverage.Â  Concrete Servs., Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp; Guar. Co., 331 S.C. 506, 509, 498 S.E.2d 865, 866 (1998).Â  Class I insureds include the named insured and his or her spouse and relatives residing in the same household.Â  Id.Â  Class II insureds are those using the insured vehicle with permission of the named insured and guests.Â  Id.Â  \r\nSmith was not the named insured or the named insuredâ€™s spouse; nor does she does qualify as a resident relative.Â  Although the pleadings refer to Smith as Washnokâ€™s adopted daughter, it is undisputed that Smith did not reside in the same household as Washnok at the time of the accident.\r\nThe Smithsâ€™ argument is essentially that USAAâ€™s inclusion of Smith as an â€œoperatorâ€ on the declarations page of the policy created an ambiguity as to whether she was a named insured and such an ambiguity should be resolved in favor of coverage.Â  No cases in South Carolina have addressed this question to date.\r\nCourts in some states have found in favor of coverage in similar situations.Â  The leading case is Lehrhoff v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 638 A.2d 889 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 1994).Â  In Lehrhoff, the court found that the insured was entitled to uninsured motorist coverage because of his inclusion on the declarations page as a driver of the insured vehicle.Â  Id. at 892.Â  Rhode Island followed suit, concluding that â€œthe listing of driversâ€™ names on the declarations page, without more, gives rise to an ambiguity in respect to whether such drivers are in fact covered under the terms of a policy.â€Â  Mallane v. Holyoke Mut. Ins. Co., 658 A.2d 18, 20 (R.I. 1995). \r\nThese cases, however, relied on the doctrine of reasonable expectations.Â  See Lehrhoff, 638 A.2d at 892 (â€œ[W]e are . . . convinced that reasonable expectations of coverage raised by the declaration page cannot be contradicted by the policyâ€™s boilerplate . . . .â€); Mallane, 658 A.2d at 21 (quoting the above language from Lehrhoff in reliance).Â  The doctrine of reasonable expectations, which is essentially that the objectively reasonable expectations of insureds as to coverage will be honored even though a careful review of the terms of the policy would have shown otherwise, has been rejected in South Carolina.Â  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Mangum, 299 S.C. 226, 231-32, 383 S.E.2d 464, 466-67 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  Moreover, the Mallane court recognized that its holding was a minority position.Â  Mallane, 658 A.2d at 21.Â  \r\nAdditionally, neither Lehrhoff nor Mallane dealt with stacking.Â  The issue in both cases was whether boilerplate provisions in the policy could be used to defeat uninsured motorist coverage provided under the policy.Â  Lehrhoff, 638 A.2d at 889, 892; Mallane, 658 A.2d at 20.Â  In the case sub judice, USAA has already paid the UIM coverage for the car involved in the accident, and the issue is whether Smith is entitled to additional UIM coverage from Washnokâ€™s second car.\r\nThe majority view is that listing a driver on the declarations page of an insurance policy does not make that person a named insured.Â  In Georgia Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Wilkerson, 549 S.E.2d 740 (Ga. Ct. App. 2001), the Georgia Court of Appeals held that although neither â€œnamed insuredâ€ nor â€œdriverâ€ were defined in the insurance policy, the policy was not ambiguous.Â  Id. at 742.Â  Therefore, the person listed as a driver in the insurance policy was not allowed to stack coverage.Â  Likewise, the North Carolina Court of Appeals has held that â€œdriverâ€ and â€œnamed insuredâ€ are not synonymous because such a construction would expand the term â€œnamed insuredâ€ beyond its common sense meaning.Â  Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. Williams, 472 S.E.2d 220, 222 (N.C. App. 1996).Â  The court went on to hold that a â€œdriverâ€ was not a Class I insured.Â  Id.Â  Other courts have agreed.Â  See Millspaugh v. Ross, 645 N.E.2d 14 (Ind. Ct. App. 1994) (holding that being named a â€œprincipal driverâ€ does not create an ambiguity and does not transform one into a named insured); Kitmirides v. Middlesex Mut. Assurance Co., 783 A.2d 1079 (Conn. App. Ct. 2001) (rejecting Lehrhoff and Mallane and finding no ambiguity, and ultimately holding that a listed driver is not a named insured); Fed. Kemper Ins. Co. v. Schneider, 474 A.2d 224 (Md. Ct. Spec. App. 1984) (holding that adding a driver to a policy does not make him a named insured); see also 7 Couch on Insurance Â§ 110:1 (â€œ[O]ne listed in the policy, but only in the status of a driver of a vehicle, is not a named insured despite the fact that such personâ€™s name was physically in the policy.â€). \r\nFurthermore, even though â€œoperatorâ€ is not defined in the policy, the policy is not ambiguous.Â  Where a term is not defined in a policy, it is to be â€œdefined according to the usual understanding of the termâ€™s significance to the ordinary person.â€Â  Mfrs. and Merchants Mut. Ins. Co. v. Harvey, 330 S.C. 152, 158, 498 S.E.2d 222, 225 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  The term â€œoperatorâ€ has been construed somewhat more expansively than â€œdriverâ€ in this state, but has not been contemplated to extend beyond mere use of the vehicle.Â  State v. Graves, 269 S.C. 356, 237 S.E.2d 584 (1977) (explaining that the term â€œoperatorâ€ is broader than the term â€œdriverâ€ because it includes acts such as starting the engine or â€œmanipulating the mechanical or electrical agencies of a vehicleâ€).Â  In addition, the policy defines â€œyouâ€ and â€œyourâ€ as â€œthe â€˜named insuredâ€™ shown in the declarations.â€Â Â  The only person listed in the â€œNamed Insuredâ€ box on the declarations page was Washnok.Â  Thus, we see no ambiguity.\r\nWe therefore adopt the majority view and hold that listing an individual as an operator on the declarations page of an insurance policy does not make that individual a named insured.Â  Because Smith was not the named insured (or the named insuredâ€™s spouse or resident relative), but was only using the vehicle with Washnokâ€™s permission, she is a Class II insured, and as such, she is not entitled to stack coverage.Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the trial judge is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nGOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Litigation remains pending on the issue of excess liability coverage available to the Moores in a separate declaratory judgment action.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3978","title":"State v.

Taggart, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport,Â  all of Columbia; and Solicitor Thomas E. Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Kenneth Roach appeals from his convictions for multiple drug offenses, arguing the trial court erred (1) by admitting hearsay in violation of the Confrontation Clause and (2) by admitting an in-court identification, which was based on a single photograph lineup, without making a determination as to the reliability of the identification.Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn May 17, 2001, police were involved in a narcotics investigation and went to Roachâ€™s home to execute a search warrant for possession and distribution of crack cocaine.Â  Prior to executing the warrant, a confidential informant, who had prior drug charges himself, agreed to assist the police.Â  He testified that with twenty dollars the police had given him, he went to Roachâ€™s home and purchased drugs directly from Roach.Â  \r\nOfficers had Roachâ€™s home under surveillance at the time of the confidential informantâ€™s purchase.Â  When the officers approached the door of Roachâ€™s home to execute the warrant, they found it had been barricaded.Â  The officers knocked, and after receiving no response, they removed the door and entered the home.Â  The officers observed several people inside, including Roach, who ran into the bathroom and flushed the toilet.Â  Officers recovered crack cocaine from a plastic bag in the bathroom sink.Â  \r\nÂ In March 2002, Roach was indicted by the York County grand jury for one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute, one count of possession of crack cocaine with intent to distribute within the proximity of a public school, two counts of distribution of crack cocaine, and one count of distribution within the proximity of a public school.Â  Roach was convicted on all charges and sentenced to an aggregate term of thirty years in prison.Â  This appeal followed.Â  Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Violation of Confrontation Clause\r\nRoach alleges his right to confront witnesses was violated when the trial court permitted an officer to testify about third parties going to Roachâ€™s home to purchase crack.Â  We agree, but find this error was harmless. \r\nAccording to in camera testimony proffered by the State, several people came to the door of Roachâ€™s home while officers executed the search warrant, and one of the executing officers sold imitation crack to the visitors.Â  Defense counsel objected on the basis of relevance and also argued the testimony violated Roachâ€™s rights pursuant to the Confrontation Clause because he was unable to cross-examine the individuals who purchased the imitation crack. The State argued that there was a logical inference that Roach was holding drugs for delivery and that this was probative of the intent of what he was doing at the house. Â The trial court overruled the objection, and the Stateâ€™s witness testified before the jury as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q.&nbsp;\r\n    You said you were stationed by the door?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Yes, sir, I was.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    While you were by the door what happened?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Several people came to the door and presented me with some money, two particular cases, one presented with a $10 [sic] with an intent to buy crack.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    Don&rsquo;t tell us what they were thinking because we don&rsquo;t know.&nbsp; People offered you money?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Yes, sir.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    And you were in plain clothes?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Yes, sir.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q.\r\n    And what did you offer them in exchange for the money?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A.\r\n    Imitation crack. \r\n  \r\n\r\nâ€œThe Sixth Amendment guarantees a criminal defendant the right â€˜to be confronted with the witnesses against him.â€™â€Â  State v. Dinkins, 339 S.C. 597, 601, 529 S.E.2d 557, 559 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting U.S. Const. amend. VI).Â  The right of confrontation is essential to a fair trial because it promotes reliability and insures that convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be challenged at trial.Â  Id.Â Â  Although the confrontation clause is not identical to the hearsay rule, when the State offers hearsay evidence in a criminal case, the accusedâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to confront accusers is directly implicated.Â  See Idaho v. Wright, 497 U.S. 805 (1990); Charleston County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Father et al., 317 S.C. 283, 454 S.E.2d 307 (1995).Â  \r\nWhile the law requires confrontation with adverse witnesses, several exceptions have been recognized. See Danny R. Collins, South Carolina Evidence Â§ 16.11 (2d ed. 2000). Traditionally, â€œ[c]onfrontation [was] not always required in particular proceedings that serve[d] limited functions, for well-recognized hearsay exceptions, or for evidence that [had] other significant indicia of reliability.â€Â  Id.Â Â  In its most recent analysis of the Confrontation Clause, the United States Supreme Court modified the long-standing exemption for evidence bearing adequate â€œindicia of reliability.â€Â  Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36, 124 S.Ct. 1354 (2004).Â Â  In Crawford, the Supreme Court established a new rule which bars out-of-court statements by a witness that are testimonial in nature unless the witness is unavailable and the defendant had a prior opportunity to cross-examine the witness.Â  Id. at ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1374.Â  However, where the out-of-court statement is not testimonial in nature, the â€œindicia of reliabilityâ€ test remains.Â  Id. [1] \r\nÂ â€œHearsay is an out of court statement, offered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted.â€Â  State v. Townsend, 321 S.C. 55, 467 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  A â€œstatementâ€ as defined by Rule 801(a), SCRE, includes â€œnonverbal conduct of a person, if it is intended by the person as an assertion.â€Â  See also id., 321 S.C. at 59, 467 S.E.2d at 141 (finding the gesture of pointing to be an assertion).\r\nIn this case, the officer testified about individuals â€œofferingâ€ him money in exchange for drugs.Â  While the officer did not specifically testify as to what these individuals said to him, if anything, he did testify that the individuals communicated to him, in some way, their desire to purchase drugs.Â Â  The State offered this evidence to prove that Roach was running a â€œcrack houseâ€ that people visited with the intent to purchase drugs.Â  Thus, the officerâ€™s testimony regarding the transaction, even if it was communicated nonverbally, falls under the definition of hearsay as it was an out-of-court statement, offered in court to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  The out-of-court statements were not testimonial in nature because they were made by individuals who had no idea they were actually attempting to buy drugs from a police officer.Â  See State v. Staten, Op. No. 3955 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 7, 2005 Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 12 at 31) (explaining that in other jurisdictions, statements made to acquaintances without an intention for use at trial have consistently been labeled as non-testimonial).Â  As non-testimonial hearsay statements, they would be admissible if they fell within a well-recognized hearsay exception or bore other significant indicia of reliability, which they do not. Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing the testimony into evidence.\r\nHowever, â€œviolation of the confrontation clause is not per se reversible but is subject to a harmless error analysis.â€Â  State v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478, 481, 445 S.E.2d 633, 634 (1994).Â  â€œAn error is harmless when it â€˜could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€™â€ State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985) (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d 888 (1971)).Â Â Â  \r\nIn this case, a confidential informant testified that he had purchased drugs from Roach immediately prior to the officersâ€™ execution of their search warrant.Â  Another witness also testified that she cut crack cocaine with Roach just moments before the officers burst into Roachâ€™s home.Â  Numerous people were in the home, all of whom fled when the officers came into the home.Â  Furthermore, Roach ran to the bathroom and flushed the toilet when officers entered his home, and crack cocaine was found in the sink of that bathroom.Â  In light of this overwhelming evidence against Roach, we do not believe the hearsay testimony regarding an officerâ€™s sale of imitation crack could have reasonably affected the result of the trial.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Admission of Identification\r\nRoach next argues the trial court erred by allowing an in-court identification, which was based on a single person lineup, without making a determination as to the reliability of the identification.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt Roachâ€™s trial, a confidential informant testified in camera that he told police he could purchase crack from 523 East White Street, the address of Roachâ€™s home.Â  The informant, however, did not know the name of the seller.Â  Police showed him a photograph of Roach, and the informant identified him as the person from whom he had purchased crack many times during a four-month period.Â  \r\nDefense counsel argued the informant should not be allowed to identify Roach in court because the one photograph lineup was unduly suggestive.Â  Counsel further argued the informantâ€™s identification was unreliable because he was smoking crack and was going to various other places to purchase crack.Â  The trial judge agreed the lineup was suggestive, but ultimately allowed the identification to be admitted, explaining:\r\n\r\n  Even though [a one photograph lineup] would be suggestive on its face . . . I find that the identification is not to be excluded because I donâ€™t believe there is a substantial risk of misidentification.Â  The witness testified that he viewed this person, perhaps, he didnâ€™t know his name, maybe the photograph connected the name, and I donâ€™t find any problem with that, but he certainly has the ability based on his previous purchases and contact with [Roach] or the person he identified as [Roach] and the person he identified as the person from whom he purchased.Â  I find that his in court identification will be allowed.Â  \r\n\r\n After making that finding, the trial judge went on to explain:\r\n\r\n  Iâ€™ll certainly charge the jury that they are to take into consideration whatever factors they need to in regard to determining whether or not that is a reliable [identification].Â  [T]hatâ€™s not what the court is deciding, Iâ€™m not deciding whether itâ€™s reliable, Iâ€™m deciding whether itâ€™s admissible. \r\n\r\nThe United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry to determine the admissibility of an out-of-court identification.Â  Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 198-99 (1972).Â  First, the trial judge must ascertain whether the identification process was unduly suggestive.Â  State v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 287, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000).Â  Next, the trial judge must decide whether the out-of-court identification was nevertheless so reliable that no substantial likelihood of misidentification existed.Â  Id.Â  â€œSingle person show-ups are disfavored because they are suggestive by their nature.â€Â  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 251, 525 S.E.2d 535, 541 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œHowever, an identification may be reliable under the totality of the circumstances even when a suggestive procedure has been used.â€Â  State v. Mansfield, 343 S.C. 66, 78, 538 S.E.2d 257, 263 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nRoach argues the trial judgeâ€™s ruling should be reversed because the judge explicitly refused to evaluate the reliability of the identification.Â  We disagree.Â  As is clear from the trial judgeâ€™s ruling excerpted above, he considered the reliability of the identification and found there was no substantial risk for misidentification.Â  Although he went on to say, â€œIâ€™m not deciding whether itâ€™s reliable, Iâ€™m deciding whether itâ€™s admissible,â€ this statement must be taken in context.Â  This statement was made as the trial judge explained how he would charge the jury.Â  Ultimately, it was the juryâ€™s responsibility, as the sole arbiter of the facts, to determine whether the in-court identification was credible.Â  Thus, the trial judge was merely explaining that despite the identificationâ€™s admissibility, it would be in the juryâ€™s hands to determine whether to rely on the identification when determining Roachâ€™s guilt.Â  We thus find no error.\r\nAccordingly, Roachâ€™s convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Supreme Court declined to â€œspell out a comprehensive definition of â€˜testimonial,â€™â€ but noted that the term â€œapplies at a minimum to prior testimony at a preliminary hearing, before a grand jury, or at a former trial; and to police interrogations.â€Â  Crawford, 541 U.S. ___, 124 S.Ct. at 1367.Â  For a comprehensive review of testimonial and non-testimonial hearsay, see State v.

Oberman, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: Â William Holler (Husband) appeals from the family courtâ€™s determination that a premarital agreement signed by Nataliya[1] Holler (Wife) is not enforceable.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWife is originally from Ukraine.Â  She was educated in Ukraine and taught college students in that country.Â  English is not Wifeâ€™s first language.Â  After seeing Husbandâ€™s picture in â€œa feminine magazine,â€ Wife wrote a letter to him in English and included her phone number.Â  Thereafter, Husband and Wife talked on the phone for â€œ[a]bout a year.â€Â  Their conversations were in English.Â  During this time, Husband visited Wife in Ukraine.\r\nOn September 5, 1997, Wife traveled to the United States to marry Husband.Â  At the time of her arrival, Wifeâ€™s English was â€œreally poor.â€Â  Husband disputed Wifeâ€™s inability to speak English, claiming she spoke â€œ[v]ery well.â€Â  Upon completing an English course, Wife received a certificate from Central Piedmont College in May of 1998.\r\nIn October or early November 1997, Wife became pregnant with Husbandâ€™s child.Â  Wifeâ€™s visa was scheduled to expire on December 4, 1997, and she would have to return to Ukraine unless she married Husband.Â  Wife came to the United States without money and relied upon Husband to provide support.\r\nWife admitted that, while she was still in Ukraine, Husband told her about the premarital agreement.Â  However, Wife believed she â€œneeded to sign some papers under the law of South Carolina before we g[o]t married.â€Â  Wife claimed: â€œ[Husband] faxed me some documents for American Embassy, and one page was he told me that we needâ€”when you get to United States we have to sign that agreement before we get married because this is under [the] law of South Carolina.â€Â  Husband delivered the premarital agreement to Wife sometime before the marriage.Â  Husband first stated he faxed it to her five or six months before she arrived in the United States.Â  Husband maintained he handed her a copy to sign within a week after she arrived.Â  Yet, Wife declared Husband gave her a copy of the premarital agreement only two weeks before she signed it. \r\nPrior to signing the premarital agreement, Wife attempted to translate a portion of the agreement from English into Russian, but was unable to complete the translation.Â  â€œBecause it was too hard,â€ Wife became frustrated with the translation and quit.Â  Wife had eleven pages of translation before she determined the effort was futile.Â  Wife professed the agreement â€œhad specific language which [she did not] understand even in Russian.â€Â  Wife never retained counsel because she had no money to pay someone to review the agreement.\r\nWife signed the agreement on November 25, 1997.Â  The parties were married on December 1, 1997, merely three days before Wifeâ€™s visa was set to expire.\r\nHusband and Wife separated on February 13, 2000.Â  Wife brought this action seeking a divorce, custody of the partiesâ€™ child, child support, equitable distribution of marital property, and alimony.Â  Husband answered and counterclaimed.Â  Subsequently, he filed a motion to dismiss the claims for alimony and equitable distribution asserting the premarital agreement controlled.Â  After a hearing, the family court denied the motion to dismiss.Â  The court ruled the premarital agreement was invalid and unenforceable because it was signed under duress and was unconscionable.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Dearybury v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 569 S.E.2d 367 (2002); Lanier v. Lanier, Op. No. 3966 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 21, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 14 at 74); Moghaddassi v. Moghaddassi, Op. No. 3932 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 31, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 48).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require us to disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 561 S.E.2d 610 (Ct. App. 2002); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 522 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  Nor must we ignore the fact that the trial judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 608 S.E.2d 147 (Ct. App. 2005); Murdock v. Murdock, 338 S.C. 322, 526 S.E.2d 241 (Ct. App. 1999); see also Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 477 S.E.2d 476 (Ct. App. 1996) (noting that because the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s findings where matters of credibility are involved).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nHusband raises numerous issues regarding the findings of fact made by the family court.Â  In essence, the attack by Husband on the order of the family court involves two issues: (1) whether the court erred in finding the premarital agreement invalid and unenforceable; and (2) whether the family court had jurisdiction to determine the validity of the premarital agreement.\r\nI.Â  JURISDICTION OF FAMILY COURT\r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court was without jurisdiction to determine the validity of the premarital agreement.Â  He maintains Wife should have brought her action in the circuit court because the premarital agreement barred Wife from receiving alimony and designated the partiesâ€™ respective property as nonmarital.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe jurisdiction of the family court is determined by section 20-7-420 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004).Â  Section 20-7-420(2) provides:Â  \r\n\r\n  The family court shall have exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n  \r\n    . . . .\r\n    (2) To hear and determine actions:\r\n    For divorce a vinculo matrimonii, separate support and maintenance, legal separation, and in other marital litigation between the parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions in and to the real and personal property of the marriage and attorneyâ€™s fees, if requested by either party in the pleadings.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp. 2004) (emphasis added).Â  South Carolina Code section 20-3-130(G) states:\r\n\r\n  (G) The Family Court may review and approve all agreements which bear on the issue of alimony or separate maintenance and support, whether brought before the court in actions for divorce from the bonds of matrimony, separate maintenance and support actions, or in actions to approve agreement where the parties are living separate and apart.Â  The failure to seek a divorce, separate maintenance, or a legal separation does not deprive the court of its authority and jurisdiction to approve and enforce the agreements.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2004).\r\nThis court and the South Carolina Supreme Court have allowed appeals from the family court involving a premarital agreement without raising an issue of jurisdiction.Â  See, e.g., Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 585 S.E.2d 501 (2003); Bowen v. Bowen, 352 S.C. 494, 575 S.E.2d 553 (2003); Heins v. Heins, 344 S.C. 146, 543 S.E.2d 224 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  In Gilley v. Gilley, 327 S.C. 8, 488 S.E.2d 310 (1997), the validity of the prenuptial agreement of the parties was not challenged.Â  The Gilley court analyzed the status of the property, i.e., marital or nonmarital in the context of the prenuptial agreement.Â  The court expounded:\r\n\r\n  [H]usband asked the family court for an order of separate maintenance requiring the parties to live separate and apart, equitable distribution of the marital home and other personal property, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The family court dismissed husbandâ€™s action finding it did not belong in family court since the prenuptial agreement provides that neither party can claim alimony or separate maintenance.Â  Further, the family court dismissed the action because the prenuptial agreement provided that property acquired by the parties during the marriage or owned at the time of the marriage would not be the subject of any claims for equitable apportionment.Â  The family court ruled that any claims arising from property or investments must be asserted in circuit court.Â  We agree.\r\n  The family court has exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine actions for separate support and maintenance, legal separation, other marital litigation between the parties, and for settlement of all legal and equitable rights of the parties in the actions related to the real and personal property of the marriage.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(2) (Supp. 1995).Â  Property excluded by written contract or antenuptial agreement of the parties is excluded from marital property and is considered nonmarital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 1995).Â  The family court does not have authority to apportion nonmarital property.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nGilley, 327 S.C. at 11, 488 S.E.2d at 312.Â  Property excluded from the marital estate by written contract or premarital agreement of the parties is considered nonmarital property over which the family court has no jurisdiction.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004) (noting that family court â€œdoes not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital propertyâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(4) (Supp. 2004) (stating that property excluded from the marital estate by written contract of the parties is considered nonmarital property).\r\nIn the instant case, the litigation between the parties was clearly marital in nature as the Wife sought a divorce, custody of the child, child support, alimony, and equitable distribution of the marital property.Â  Husband asserted the premarital agreement as a defense to the causes of action for alimony and equitable distribution.Â  The family court was then required to determine, pursuant to Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 585 S.E.2d 501 (2003), whether the premarital agreement was valid and enforceable.\r\nThe family court, in the case sub judice, did not attempt to distribute nonmarital property or provide support in contravention of the agreement, as was sought by the husband in Gilley.Â  The determination of the enforceability of the agreement arose in the course of marital litigation and was within the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction under section 20-7-420(2).Â  Concomitantly, the family court was correct in applying the jurisdiction of the court.\r\nII.Â  PREMARITAL AGREEMENT\r\n\r\nHusband contends the trial court erred in finding the premarital agreement was invalid and unenforceable as a result of being unconscionable and signed under duress.\r\nPremarital agreements, also called antenuptial or prenuptial agreements, are agreements between prospective spouses made in contemplation of marriage.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines a prenuptial agreement as â€œ[a]n agreement made before marriage usu[ally] to resolve issues of support and property division if the marriage ends in divorce or by the death of a spouse.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1220 (8th ed. 2004).Â  Antenuptial settlements are contracts or agreements entered into between a man and woman before marriage, but in contemplation and generally in consideration of marriage, whereby the property rights and interests of either the prospective husband or wife, or of both of them, are determined, or where property is secured to either or to both of them, or to their children.Â  41 C.J.S. Husband and Wife Â§ 61 (1991).\r\nThe consideration for a premarital agreement is the marriage itself.Â  Because such agreements are executory, they become effective only upon marriage.Â  See South Carolina Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Lawton, 69 S.C. 345, 48 S.E. 282 (1904).Â  In South Carolina Loan &amp; Trust Co. v. Lawton, the Supreme Court explained:\r\n\r\n  There is not complete execution of such instruments until actual marriage, and it does not matter how many changes may be made, and how many different instruments may be signed, the settlement, in the last form it assumes before marriage, is the real contract supported by the consideration of marriage.\r\n\r\nId. at 349, 48 S.E. at 283.\r\n In Stork v. First National Bank, 281 S.C. 515, 316 S.E.2d 400 (1984), the Supreme Court inculcated:\r\n\r\n  Antenuptial agreements, which usually involve the wife-to-be giving up her right to dower in consideration of marriage, will be enforced if made voluntarily and in good faith and if fair and equitable.Â  Rieger v. Schaible, 81 Neb. 33, 115 N.W. 560 (1908) (citing Pierce v. Pierce, 71 N.Y. 154, 27 Am. Rep. 22).Â  Such contracts are not opposed to public policy but are highly beneficial to serving the best interest of the marriage relationship.\r\n\r\nId. at 516, 316 S.E.2d at 401.Â  An antenuptial contract is valid and will be upheld when, and only when, it is entered into freely, fairly, and in good faith by parties legally competent to contract.Â  41 C.J.S. Husband and Wife Â§ 62 (1991).Â  An antenuptial agreement must be free from duress, fraud, deceit, misrepresentation, or overreaching.Â  Id.Â  Further, the agreement must not be unconscionable.Â  Id.\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court, in Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 585 S.E.2d 501 (2003), explicated:\r\n\r\n  Recent case law of this Court supports Husbandâ€™s contention that parties are free to contractually alter the obligations which would otherwise attach to marriage.Â  In Stork v. First Natâ€™l Bank of South Carolina, 281 S.C. 515, 516, 316 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1984), this Court held that antenuptial agreements â€œwill be enforced if made voluntarily and in good faith and if fair and equitable. . . . Such contracts are not opposed to public policy but are highly beneficial to serving the best interest of the marriage relationship.â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 387, 585 S.E.2d at 503.Â  In determining whether a premarital agreement should be enforced, our supreme court professed:\r\n\r\n  (1) Was the agreement obtained through fraud, duress, or mistake, or through misrepresentation or nondisclosure of material facts? (2) Is the agreement unconscionable? (3) Have the facts and circumstances changed since the agreement was executed, so as to make its enforcement unfair and unreasonable?\r\n\r\nId. at 389, 585 S.E.2d at 504 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nA.Â  Duress\r\n\r\nHusband avers the family court improperly concluded Wife signed the premarital agreement while under duress.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuress is a condition of mind produced by improper external pressure or influence that practically destroys the free agency of a party and causes him to do an act or form a contract not of his own volition.Â  Cherry v. Shelby Mut. Plate Glass &amp; Cas. Co., 191 S.C. 177, 4 S.E.2d 123 (1939); Cox &amp; Floyd Grading, Inc. v. Kajima Constr. Servs., Inc., 356 S.C. 512, 589 S.E.2d 789 (Ct. App. 2003); Willms Trucking Co. v. JW Constr. Co., 314 S.C. 170, 442 S.E.2d 197 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nCorpus Juris Secundum defines duress:\r\n\r\n  â€œDuressâ€ may be defined as subjecting a person to a pressure which overcomes his or her will and coerces him or her to comply with demands to which he or she would not yield if acting as a free agent.Â  Some definitions of â€œduressâ€ contain not only the element of pressure overcoming the victimâ€™s will but also the element that the pressure or compulsion consists of improper, wrongful, or unlawful conduct, acts, or threats.\r\n  Further, â€œduressâ€ has been defined as the condition of mind produced by the wrongful conduct of another rendering a person incompetent to contract with the exercise of his or her free will power, or as the condition of mind produced by an improper external pressure destroying free agency so as to cause the victim to act or contract without use of his or her own volition, or as unlawful constraint whereby a person is forced to do some act against his or her will.\r\n\r\n17A C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 175 (1999) (footnotes omitted).\r\nThe central question with respect to whether a contract was executed under duress is whether, considering all the surrounding circumstances, one party to the transaction was prevented from exercising his free will by threats or the wrongful conduct of another.Â  17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 218 (2004).Â  Freedom of will is essential to the validity of an agreement.Â  Id.Â  A party claiming â€œduressâ€ can prevail if he shows that he has been the victim of a wrongful or unlawful act or threat of a kind that deprives the victim of unfettered will, with the result that he was compelled to make a disproportionate exchange of values.Â  Id.\r\nIn order to establish that a contract was procured through duress, three things must be proved: (1) coercion; (2) putting a person in such fear that he is bereft of the quality of mind essential to the making of a contract; and (3) that the contract was thereby obtained as a result of this state of mind.Â  In re Nightingaleâ€™s Estate, 182 S.C. 527, 189 S.E. 890 (1937).Â  The fear which makes it impossible for a person to exercise his own free will is not so much to be tested by the means employed to accomplish the act, as by the state of mind produced by the means invoked.Â  Id.; Willms Trucking Co., 314 S.C. at 179, 442 S.E.2d at 202.Â  If one of the parties to an agreement is in a position to dictate its terms to such an extent as to substitute his will for the will of the other party thereto, it is not a mutual, voluntary agreement, but becomes an agreement emanating entirely from his own mind.Â  In re Nightingaleâ€™s Estate, 182 S.C. at 547, 189 S.E at 898; Willms Trucking Co., 314 S.C. at 179, 442 S.E.2d at 202.Â  If a partyâ€™s manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is voidable by the victim.Â  Willms Trucking Co., 314 S.C. at 179, 442 S.E.2d at 202.Â  Whether or not duress exists in a particular case is a question of fact to be determined according to the circumstances of each case, such as the age, sex, and capacity of the party influenced.Â  Id.; see also Santee Portland Cement Corp. v. Mid-State Redi-Mix Concrete Co., 273 S.C. 784, 260 S.E.2d 178 (1979) (stating whether or not duress was present is a question ordinarily determined on a case by case basis).\r\nDuress is viewed with a subjective test which looks at the individual characteristics of the person allegedly influenced, and duress does not occur if the victim has a reasonable alternative to succumbing and fails to take advantage of it.Â  Blejski v. Blejski, 325 S.C. 491, 480 S.E.2d 462 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 175 cmt. b &amp; c (1981)).Â  Duress is a defense to an otherwise valid contract.Â  17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 218.Â  Duress renders a contract voidable at the option of the oppressed party.Â  Santee Portland Cement Corp., 273 S.C. at 784, 260 S.E.2d at 178.\r\nAssumptively concluding Wife was allowed the opportunity to view the premarital agreement three months in advance, the evidence in the record indicates: (1) Wife did not understand the contents of the agreement; (2) she did not freely enter into the agreement; (3) she attempted to translate the agreement into Russian in order to better comprehend the document; (4) she became frustrated as she was unable to complete a satisfactory translation; and (5) her notes indicate there are several words for which she could not find a translation, including â€œundivided,â€ â€œequitable,â€ and â€œpro rata.â€Â  Consequently, Wife could not understand the agreement.\r\nAdditionally, Husband was aware of the deadline with respect to Wifeâ€™s visa.Â  According to his own testimony, Husband made it perfectly clear to Wife that she must sign the agreement if she wanted to be married prior to the expiration of her visa.Â  Wife was in the United States with no means to support herself.Â  She relied solely and completely on Husband for support.Â  Wife had no money of her own with which to retain and consult an attorney or a translator.Â  Whether a party obtained independent legal advice is a significant consideration in evaluating whether an antenuptial agreement was voluntarily and understandingly made.Â  See 41 C.J.S. Husband and Wife Â§ 62 (1991).Â Â Â  The family court found if Wife was not able to marry, then she would be forced to return to Ukraine.Â  Because she was pregnant with Husbandâ€™s child, she sought to insure his continued support and to remain in the United States.\r\nWife did not enter into the agreement freely and voluntarily.Â  Ample evidence exists to support the family courtâ€™s determination that Wife, given the circumstances she faced, signed the agreement under duress and without a clear understanding of what she was signing.Â  The family court did not err in finding Wife signed the agreement under duress.\r\nB.Â  Unconscionability\r\n\r\nHusband asseverates the trial court erred in finding the agreement was unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnconscionability is the absence of meaningful choice on the part of one party due to one-sided contract provisions, together with terms which are so oppressive that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.Â  Carolina Care Plan, Inc. v. United HealthCare Servs., Inc., 361 S.C. 544, 606 S.E.2d 752 (2004); Hardee v. Hardee, 355 S.C. 382, 585 S.E.2d 501 (2003); Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d 242 (1996); see also 17 C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 4 (1999) (noting some courts state that a party seeking to show an agreement is unconscionable must show that, at the time the agreement was formed, there was an absence of meaningful choice and the contract terms unreasonably favor one party).\r\nâ€œIn determining unconscionability, courts are limited to considering facts and circumstances existing when the contract was executed.â€Â  Hardee v. Hardee, 348 S.C. 84, 95-96, 558 S.E.2d 264, 269-70 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Restatement (Second) of Contracts Â§ 208 (1981)), affâ€™d as modified, 355 S.C. 382, 585 S.E.2d 501 (2003); see also Lackey v. Green Tree Fin. Corp., 330 S.C. 388, 397, 498 S.E.2d 898, 903 (Ct. App. 1998)(â€œIf the court finds that a contract clause was unconscionable at the time it was made, the court may refuse to enforce the contract clause or limit the application of the unconscionable clause to avoid any unconscionable result.â€).Â  â€œA determination whether a contract is unconscionable depends upon all the facts and circumstances of a particular case.â€Â  17A Am. Jur. 2d Contracts Â§ 279 (2004); see also 17 C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 4 (1999) (â€œThe determination of unconscionability is fact specific, and the totality of the circumstances must be assessed.â€).\r\nIn order to determine whether the agreement was unconscionable, we examine its terms and their application to the parties.Â  The agreement provided in part that both parties would be responsible for paying rent as well as real estate taxes and utilities on a property owned by Husbandâ€™s mother and leased to Husband.Â  The agreement required Husband â€œshall have a proportionate interest in the increase in value during the marriage of the homestead real estate, proportionate to the percentage contribution of the household expenses, if any, and child care/household duties performed by William Holler during the course of the marriage.â€Â  The agreement did not contain a similar provision regarding Wifeâ€™s interest as a result of her contributions of childcare or household duties.\r\n\r\n  Profoundly, the agreement stated:Â  \r\n  10.Â  Support.Â  Each of the parties has income from property interest sufficient to provide for his or her respective support.Â  Each has been self-supporting for a period of time prior to the contemplated marriage.Â  Both parties feel that they are capable of future self-support and of maintaining themselves on a self-supporting basis.\r\n\r\nHowever, at the time the agreement was signed, Husband was providing all of Wifeâ€™s support and knew Wife had to return to Ukraine unless she obtained independent subsidy.\r\nSignificantly, the exhibit listing the partiesâ€™ respective financial information reveals Husband had a net worth over $150,000 with $30,000 in annual income, while Wife had $0.00 listed beside each category of assets as well as $0.00 for her net worth.Â  The declaration indicated she earned $1,400.00 per year as a music teacher in Ukraine.Â  Apodictically, we find ample evidence in the record demonstrating the premarital agreement was unconscionable and, therefore, unenforceable.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe family court possessed jurisdiction to determine whether the premarital agreement was valid and enforceable.Â  Further, the family court did not err in finding: (1) Wife signed the agreement under duress; and (2) the agreement was unconscionable and unenforceable.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Wife is referred to in the record as both Nataliya and Natasha.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3980","title":"Gay v.

Coltrane, Special Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3980\r\nSubmitted March1, 2005 â€“ Filed April 18, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Walter L. Gay, of St. Helena, Pro Se, for Appellant.\r\n        William B. Harvey, III, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This is an appeal from the trial courtâ€™s decision affirming the Beaufort City Councilâ€™s revocation of Walter Gayâ€™s business license to conduct tours in the historic district of Beaufort.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn August 5, 2002, the City of Beaufort granted Walter Gay, doing business as Sandlapper Trolleys, a business license for the purposes of conducting tours through Beaufort, including the historic district.Â  Within the next few days, the city told Gay the license would be revoked because his tour vehicle was considered a â€œtrolleyâ€ under Beaufort City Ordinance section 7-11002 and, therefore, could not be used in the historic district.Â  \r\nGay wrote a letter to the city manager requesting that the city council reconsider revoking his license.Â  Alternatively, he asked that the city ordinance prohibiting the use of trolleys in the historic district be changed.Â  The city council referred the matter to the city manager and city attorney and further requested Beaufortâ€™s Tourist Management Advisory Commission (â€œCommissionâ€) to review the ordinance and give a recommendation.Â  \r\nIn 2003, based on the Commissionâ€™s recommendation that the vehicle was considered a â€œtrolleyâ€ for purposes of the ordinance as well as statements by several of the individuals who created the ordinance, the city council voted to revoke Gayâ€™s license.Â  Gay appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the decision of the city council.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhere the city council of a municipality has acted after considering all of the facts, the court should not disturb the finding unless such action is arbitrary, unreasonable, or an obvious abuse of its discretion.Â  Bob Jones Univ., Inc. v. City of Greenville, 243 S.C. 351, 360, 133 S.E.2d 843, 847 (1963).Â  This court will not disturb on appeal such findings of the city council, concurred in by a circuit judge, unless they are without evidentiary support or against the clear preponderance of the evidence.Â  Id. at 363, 133 S.E.2d at 848 (referring specifically to the findings of a master-in-equity, which affirmed the actions of a city council).Â  \r\n\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Gay claims the trial court erred in affirming Beaufort City Councilâ€™s decision to revoke his license to conduct tours through the historic district because his tour vehicle is not a â€œtheme vehicle,â€ as defined by the city ordinance.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe City of Beaufort Ordinance Â§ 7-11003 provides that â€œ[t]heme vehicles other than horse-drawn carriages . . . may not be utilized for touring purposes in the historic district.â€Â  The ordinances further define â€œtheme vehicleâ€ in the following manner:\r\n\r\n  A vehicle whose design, shape, form, color, signage, or accoutrements is intended to create a particular identity and to call special attention to that vehicle, such as a horse-drawn carriage, trolley, pedicab, snail vehicle, or articulated vehicle.Â  Touring vehicles displaying commercial or institutional identification in a customary fashion shall not be considered theme vehicles.Â  \r\n\r\nOrdinance Â§ 7-11002. (Emphasis added.)Â Â  \r\nGay considered his tour vehicle a â€œtrolley,â€ as evidenced by his trade name â€œSandlapper Trolleysâ€ and the content of his letter to the city manager.Â  In that letter Gay referred to his tour vehicle as a â€œtrolleyâ€ numerous times.Â  For example, he stated, â€œI admit that what I have looks similar to a trolley and it is called a trolley.â€Â  He also argued that his â€œtrolley is a clean vehicleâ€ and â€œis an asset to any historic area.â€Â  He also requested help from the city manager in â€œfinding a way to utilize [his] trolley in the historic tours of Beaufort.â€Â  Finally, he asked the city council to consider amending the ordinance so his vehicle could be used in the historic district.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the city manager and the city attorney determined, based on their evaluation of the tour vehicle and the ordinance, that the tour vehicle was a â€œtheme vehicleâ€ as defined by the city ordinance.Â  â€œ[B]ecause of the design and shapeâ€ of the tour vehicle, the Commission concluded that the tour vehicle was a trolley and, therefore, fit within Beaufortâ€™s definition of a theme vehicle.[2]Â  At the city council meeting, a representative of the Commission stated, â€œan ordinance change would be necessary for [Gay] to operateâ€ his tour vehicle in the historic district.Â  \r\nLastly, the city council agreed that the tour vehicle was a bus.Â  However, â€œbecause of its design it is considered a theme vehicle.â€Â  Therefore, the findings of the Beaufort City Council, concurred with by the circuit court, are supported by the preponderance of the evidence.Â Â  \r\nFor the reasons stated herein, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Any references to the Commissionâ€™s recommendations or city councilâ€™s decisions were extracted from the Beaufort City Council meeting minutes.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3981","title":"Doe v.

Brogdon, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â Â  3981\r\n  Heard March 9, 2005 â€“ Filed April 18, 2005\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Cynthia B.

Graham, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: The South Carolina Department of Disabilities and Special Needs (Department) and the State Accident Fund appeal the decision of the circuit court reversing the findings of the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Full Commission) and awarding benefits to Jane Doe (Claimant) based on her mental injuries.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nClaimant worked for the Department as a licensed practical nurse (LPN) for approximately eighteen years.Â  She cared for individuals suffering from extreme mental retardation and cognitive disabilities such that they require institutional care.Â  As an LPN, Claimant was responsible for the daily medical care of the patients in her unit.Â  \r\nIn early 1997, the Department moved the individuals under Claimantâ€™s care into group homes because they were â€œhigher functioning.â€Â  As a result, patients who required more medical attention were moved into the unit where Claimant worked.Â  Some of the new patients were more aggressive than Claimantâ€™s prior patients.Â  \r\nClaimant was injured in June of 1997 when a patient kicked her in the abdomen.Â  She sought medical attention and was prescribed anti-inflammatory and pain medication.Â  When she returned to her doctor, Dr. Paschal, for her recheck in August 1997, she complained about being depressed and having â€œa lot of crying spells.â€Â  She was diagnosed with depression and prescribed Prozac.Â  She returned to Dr. Paschal several times for her depression and was prescribed Serzone.Â  Beginning August 17, 1997, Claimant took a leave of absence from the Department as a result of her stress.Â  \r\nClaimant returned to work full-time in February 1998.Â  Shortly thereafter, a patient pushed a cart into her, causing Claimant to sprain her left arm and knee.Â  She was placed in a sling and knee immobilizer and given an anti-inflammatory and pain medication.Â  \r\nClaimant continued to see her doctors regarding her depression.Â  Each time, she related her depression to the stress and environment at work.Â  In August 1998, she accepted termination under a workforce reduction program.\r\nAfter leaving the Department, Claimant continued to have severe depression, eating disorders, and other mental problems requiring both outpatient treatment and hospitalization.Â  Throughout her treatment, Claimant complained of being depressed, not being able to sleep, and other psychological problems. \r\nClaimant filed a Form 50, seeking workersâ€™ compensation benefits for the two physical injuries she sustained in June 1997 and February 1998.Â  Additionally, she sought benefits for mental injury.Â  Specifically, she alleged:Â  â€œThe unusual and extraordinary work conditions and/or the two physical injuries caused the Claimant to suffer disabling mental injury.â€ Â The two physical injuries were admitted by the Department, and Claimant was paid seventy-eight dollars for her expenses.Â  The Department denied the mental injury claims.\r\nAt the hearing, Claimant presented evidence of the change in the work environment at the Department beginning in the spring of 1997.Â  She discussed her increased responsibilities and her increased exposure to aggressive patients.Â  Testimony by other employees of the Department confirmed the work conditions.\r\nClaimant indicated the physical injuries for which she sought compensation were but some of the physical assaults which occurred while working for the Department after the change in patients.Â  Among other things, she testified she had feces smeared in her face by a patient.Â  Claimant testified she was stressed and was very afraid of receiving further physical injuries.Â  Testimony indicated that she could not transfer to another area of the Department because no other employees were willing to accept her shift. \r\nThe Department produced evidence that the change of patients was not an unexpected or unusual event.Â  Additionally, the Department showed the number of patients under Claimantâ€™s care decreased as a result of the change.Â  The evidence indicated Claimant was specifically trained to handle more aggressive patients, and it was not unusual for nurses who worked for the Department to be subjected to aggressive behavior. \r\nThe single commissioner found Claimant had failed to prove her mental injury was the result of unusual or extraordinary circumstances.Â  He found the environment was one to be expected when dealing with the patients in the care of the Department.Â  Additionally, the commissioner found no evidence that Claimantâ€™s physical injuries directly caused her stress and fears.Â  Therefore, the commissioner found Claimant had failed to provide evidence that her mental injury was compensable.Â  The Full Commission agreed and adopted the findings and conclusions of the single commissioner.Â  \r\nThe circuit court reversed the order of the Full Commission.Â  The circuit court found Claimant had presented substantial evidence of the unusual and extraordinary nature of her work environment.Â  Additionally, the circuit court found the mental injury was accompanied by the physical injuries, and therefore the circuit court did not need to determine whether the work conditions were unusual and extraordinary.Â  The circuit court specifically noted that physical injuries do not have to be the direct cause of the mental injury, but must be a cause and must accompany the mental injury.Â  Finally, the circuit court awarded Claimant five hundred weeks of total and permanent disability compensation in the amount of $330.86 per week for her mental injury.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Did the circuit court err by reversing the decision of the Full Commission and finding Claimantâ€™s mental injury was compensable as the result of unusual and extraordinary work conditions?\r\n  \r\n  II.Â Â Â Â Â  Did the circuit court err by reversing the decision of the Full Commission and finding Claimantâ€™s mental injury was compensable as the result of a mental injury accompanied by a physical injury?\r\n  III.Â Â Â Â  Did the circuit court err by awarding Claimant total and permanent disability benefits instead of remanding for a determination by the Full Commission?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981).Â  â€œIn workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Full Commission is the ultimate fact finder.â€Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Full Commission.â€Â  Id. In an appeal from the commission, this court, as well as the circuit court, may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2004).Â  The appellate court can reverse or modify the Full Commissionâ€™s decision only if the claimantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â Id.Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion the Full Commission reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Mental-Mental\r\nThe Department contends the circuit court erred in reversing the determination by the Full Commission that Claimantâ€™s mental disability was not caused by â€œextraordinary and unusualâ€ conditions in her employment.Â  We agree.\r\nA mental-mental injury is a purely mental injury resulting from emotional stimuli.Â  Shealy, 341 S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  According to section 42-1-160 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2004):\r\n\r\n  Stress arising out of and in the course of employment unaccompanied by physical injury and resulting in mental illness or injury is not a personal injury unless it is established that the stressful employment conditions causing the mental injury were extraordinary and unusual in comparison to the normal conditions of the employment.\r\n\r\nThe requirement of â€œunusual or extraordinary conditions in employmentâ€ for a claimant to recover for a mental-mental injury refers to conditions to the particular job in which the injury occurs, not to conditions of employment in general.Â  Shealy, 341 at 456, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  In order to recover workersâ€™ compensation benefits, Claimant must prove both:Â  (1) that she was exposed to unusual and extraordinary conditions in her employment; and (2) that these unusual and extraordinary conditions were the proximate cause of her mental breakdown.Â  Id. at 459, 535 S.E.2d at 444.\r\nAs the finder of fact, the Full Commission found the conditions of Claimantâ€™s employment were not extraordinary or unusual for her particular job.Â  The Full Commission specifically found the movement of patients between facilities was not extraordinary, and the change in the level of care that Claimant had to provide her patients was not an extraordinary or unusual condition.Â  The Full Commission found that being â€œsubjected to aggressive behavior by mentally-challenged patients is not an extraordinary and unusual condition of employment as a nurse at [the Department], as this occurs with some frequency and is the subject of specific training for [Department] employees.â€Â  Finally, the Full Commission found:Â  \r\n\r\n  Based upon her work history and training, it was not unexpected that Claimant would be subjected to changes in the amount of medical care her patients required, that she would be subjected to loud and aggressive behavior by patients, that she would fear loud and aggressive behavior by patients, and that she would suffer minor physical injuries as a result of aggressive behavior by patients. \r\n\r\nThe findings of fact made by the Full Commission are supported by substantial evidence in the record.[1]Â  Tenia Rae Allen, a supervisor of first shift nurses, testified that dealing with aggressive people was not an unusual situation and that nurses were injured even before the more aggressive patients came to Claimantâ€™s unit. Â A co-worker, Kim Willis, provided additional testimony to indicate the working conditions were not unusual.Â  She stated: â€œThere have always been times when we would have certain patients that were harder to deal with . . . . Most of the ones we have now have more medical needs, but there have always been times when it was hard to deal with, the whole 21 years Iâ€™ve been there.â€ Â Willis also testified that as a nurse she expected changes in the types of patients she would be dealing with and felt it could get even worse than it was at the time Claimant left.Â  Finally, she testified that some physical confrontation with the patients is to be expected and that was why they had classes to train and â€œlearn how to deal with that.â€ \r\nIn addition to finding the condition of Claimantâ€™s work environment was not extraordinary and unusual, the Full Commission found she had prior and current non-work related stressors, which could impact her mental injury.Â  The Full Commission found her hospitalizations for depression that occurred prior to her employment with the Department contributed to her current bout with depression.Â  Additionally, at the time she was incurring the changes at work, she was also coping with her fatherâ€™s diagnosis of cancer and his subsequent death from the disease. Â Dr. Paschal and Dr. Lowe document these additional factors in the medical notes.\r\n While the circuit court did a good job of detailing the evidence contrary to the findings of the Full Commission, it appears to have ignored the substantial evidence supporting the Full Commissionâ€™s findings.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in making its own findings of fact and in reversing the decision of the Full Commission as it relates to Claimantâ€™s mental-mental claim.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Physical-Mental\r\nThe Department next contends the circuit court erred in reversing the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that Claimantâ€™s mental claims were not caused by her physical injuries and, therefore, not compensable.Â  We agree.\r\nBoth mental-mental injuries, in which the injury is brought on by the extraordinary and unusual conditions of the claimantâ€™s work, and physical-mental injuries, in which a physical injury induced the mental disability, are compensable.Â  See Getsinger v. Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., 335 S.C. 77, 80-81, 515 S.E.2d 104, 105-06 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œWhere . . . the mental injury is induced by physical injury, it is not necessary that it result from unusual or extraordinary conditions of employment.â€Â  Estridge v. Joslyn Clark Controls, Inc., 325 S.C. 532, 538, 482 S.E.2d 577, 580 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A condition, which is induced by a physical injury, is thereby causally related to that injury.Â  Id. (defining cause as that which produces an effect); Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary, 221 (6th ed. 1990) (defining cause as â€œto make to induce. . . .â€)).Â  â€œ[The mental injury] is a new symptom manifesting from the same harm to the body.â€Â  Estridge, 325 at 538-39, 482 S.E.2d at 581.\r\nDespite the circuit courtâ€™s finding that a physical injury need not be the direct cause of a mental injury, nothing in section 42-1-160, which explains that certain mental injuries are compensable, removes the causation requirement from a physical-mental claim.Â  Because there is no declaration in the statute altering the requirements for a physical-mental claim, the physical injury must still â€œinduceâ€ or â€œcauseâ€ the mental injury for the mental injury to be compensable.Â  See Caughman v. Columbia Y.M.C.A., 212 S.C. 337, 344, 47 S.E.2d 788, 791 (1948) (â€œIt must be assumed that the Legislature was aware of the policy established by [decisions of the courts] when the legislation under consideration was enacted, and it is reasonable to suppose that if it was intended to change such policy, the Legislature would have expressly so declared . . . .â€). \r\nIn the case before us, there is substantial evidence in the record supporting the Full Commissionâ€™s determination that the mental injury was not induced or caused by the minor physical injuries Claimant sustained.Â  Claimant stated her fear, the change in work conditions, the loud noises, and the increased stress resulted in her mental injuries.Â  The doctorsâ€™ records indicate Claimantâ€™s issues were related to the stressors of her work and to her fear of assaults.Â  Although Claimant feared assaults by patients, nothing in the record indicates this fear was directly caused by the injuries she suffered to her abdomen, knee, and arm.Â  Furthermore, there was substantial evidence suggesting that other stressors in Claimantâ€™s life that were unrelated to work caused her mental injuries.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in reversing the decision of the Full Commission.Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there was substantial evidence to support the Full Commissionâ€™s findings that Claimantâ€™s mental claims did not result from extraordinary and unusual conditions of her employment.Â  We hold any claim based upon a physical-mental injury must demonstrate that the physical injury caused or induced the mental injury and not that the mental injury was only temporally related.Â  Therefore, we find there is substantial evidence to support the Full Commissionâ€™s finding that her mental injury was not caused by the minor physical injuries she sustained.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the circuit court is \r\nREVERSED.[2]\r\nKITTREDGE and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We disagree with Claimantâ€™s argument that her mental injury was caused by an unlawful work environment.Â  In support of this argument, Claimant points out that the Department did not abide by Department of Health and Environmental Control regulations.Â  However, these regulations deal with contractual conditions the Department must meet to receive money from the federal government.Â  See 42 CFR Â§ 483.430(d)(1) &amp; Â§ 483.470(a)(1) (1997). While not following the regulations might result in the Departmentâ€™s loss of federal funding, violating the regulations does not create an â€œunlawfulâ€ work environment. \r\n[2] Because we find the decision of the circuit court should be reversed and the decision of the Full Commission reinstated, we need not address the Departmentâ€™s remaining issue that the circuit court erred in making findings of fact related to the nature of Claimantâ€™s disability and amount of compensation due Claimant. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3982","title":"LoPresti v.

Walker to prepare a subdivision survey plat of the property, instructing him to survey and plat lots approximately one acre in size next to the lake.Â  \r\nAfter conducting the field surveys, Walker presented Burry with a plat that contained a dotted line labeled â€œFlood Planeâ€ [sic] that ran across the numbered lots abutting the lake.Â  The line represented the elevation of the spillway of the dam to be 718.5 feet.Â  At Burryâ€™s instructions, Walker removed the line, and Burry recorded the altered plat without the â€œflood planeâ€ line.Â  \r\nIn 1990, Burry conveyed lot 12, one of the lakefront lots, to William V. and Tammy M. Easterday.Â  The Easterdays constructed a home on the lot and located it within Rabon Creekâ€™s easement.Â  In 1993, the Easterdays conveyed the home and lot to Marion Harrison.Â  In 1994, the Harrisons conveyed the property to the LoPrestis.\r\nIt appears undisputed that, before and during the LoPrestisâ€™ purchase of their home, Rabon Creek did not actually perform the inspections required by an â€œOperation and Maintenance Agreementâ€ that it entered into with the United States Department of Agriculture.Â  Specifically, the agreement required Rabon Creek to â€œprohibit the installation of any structure or facilities that will interfere with the operation or maintenance of the project measures.â€Â  The inspections were actually performed by the Department of Agriculture.Â  Moreover, although construction on the LoPrestisâ€™ home began in 1991, the inspection reports did not acknowledge this fact until 1994, when notations began to appear in the reports about houses located in the floodplain area.Â  Even then, Rabon Creek took no action regarding this development. \r\nUnusually heavy rainfall during January 1995 caused the lake to flood the LoPrestisâ€™ finished basement to a height of about fourteen inches.Â  In August 1995, the remnants of Hurricane Jerry caused the lake level within the flood easement to rise and flood the Loprestisâ€™ home, completely engulfing their basement and coming to within four inches of the finished elevation of the second floor above the basement. \r\nIn 1996, the LoPrestis brought this action against Burry, Rabon Creek, and other defendants alleging various causes of action arising out of the damage to their property.Â  The LoPrestisâ€™ lawsuit was later consolidated with three other similar cases. \r\nIn 1997, the trial court issued an order granting partial summary judgment as to the existence of the easement as initially executed and filed but denying summary judgment as to the scope, extent, and continuing validity of the easement and as to various affirmative defenses to Rabon Creekâ€™s right to enforce it.Â  In 1998, following a consolidated bench trial on the remaining issues, the trial court issued an order ruling that the easement extended to the top of the dam elevation, but also that Rabon Creek was estopped from enforcing it against all parties except Burry.\r\nOn appeal, this court held the easement was clear and unambiguous and Rabon Creek had the right to flood the land surrounding the lake up to the top of the dam, that is, to an elevation of 724.5 feet.[1]Â  This court further held the LoPrestis and other aggrieved homeowners had at least constructive notice of the easement and, because of this notice, Rabon Creek could not be equitably estopped from enforcing it.[2]\r\nFollowing the supreme courtâ€™s denial of certiorari in the case on October 23, 2002, the case was returned to the trial court to complete proceedings consistent with this courtâ€™s opinion.Â  The remaining issues arise from the LoPrestisâ€™ claims against Burry for fraud, fraudulent concealment, negligent and reckless nondisclosure of land defects, breach of warranty, and violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act and the LoPrestisâ€™ negligence claim against Rabon Creek. \r\nBoth Burry and Rabon Creek moved for summary judgment.Â  By order dated April 25, 2003, the trial court granted summary judgment to Burry and Rabon Creek on all the LoPrestisâ€™ causes of action, holding the determination by this court that the homeowners had unambiguous record notice of the presence and scope of the easement precluded any recovery against either Burry or Rabon Creek.[3]\r\n1.Â  The trial court dismissed the LoPrestisâ€™ claims against Burry for fraud, constructive fraud, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and negligence based on a finding that they were charged with constructive notice of the flood easement.Â  The LoPrestis argue the trial court incorrectly determined they had no right to rely on the misrepresentation allegedly created by the alteration of the survey plat.\r\nWe find no error.\r\nIn our prior decision, we held the LoPrestis were charged with constructive notice of the easement because it was properly recorded in the homeownersâ€™ chain of title.[4]Â  We noted in reaching this conclusion:Â  â€œOne with knowledge of the truth or the means by which with reasonable diligence he could acquire knowledge cannot claim to have been mis[led].â€[5]\r\nThe LoPrestis argue that removal of the dotted line depicting the floodplain from the recorded subdivision plat amounted to a misrepresentation on Burryâ€™s part.Â  Relying on Reid v. Harbison Development Corp.[6] and Slack v. James,[7] the LoPrestis contend one who commits a fraud cannot defeat a claim for misrepresentation simply because the person defrauded is charged with notice under a recording statute.Â  Based on this rationale, the LoPrestis assert the question of whether their reliance on the altered plat was reasonable presented an issue of material fact for a jury to determine.\r\nWe have found nothing in the record, however, to support the argument that the LoPrestis justifiably relied on the absence in the plat of dotted lines showing the floodplain.[8]Â  \r\nAs this court held in Reid, â€œthe true test of the hearerâ€™s right to rely on misrepresentations as to matters of record is whether or not he acted with reasonable prudence in so doing.â€[9]Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he law imputes to a purchaser of real estate notice of the recitals contained in the written instruments forming his chain of title and charges him with the duty of making such reasonable inquiry and investigation as is suggested by the recitals and references therein contained.â€[10]\r\nThe recorded plat purports only to give a general layout of the lots for the subdivisionâ€”both waterfront and non-waterfront.Â  Moreover, the deed transferring the property in question to the LoPrestis makes reference to the plat only â€œfor more [a] complete metes and bounds descriptionâ€[11] and clearly qualifies the conveyance as â€œsubject to any and all existing reservations, easements, rights-of-way, zoning ordinances and restrictions or protective covenants that may appear of record or on the premises.â€Â  Finally, the record contains no evidence suggesting that the altered plat induced the LoPrestis not to make a complete review of the public records or request a detailed survey of the property before purchasing it.[12]Â  \r\n2.Â  The LoPrestis argue the trial court erred in finding Rabon Creek was immune from negligence liability pursuant to the exceptions to the waiver of liability in sections 15-78-60(2), (4), (5), and (13) of the South Carolina Tort Claims Act.[13]Â  \r\nWe find no reversible error.\r\nOur review of the briefs shows that, although the LoPrestis presented a reasonably detailed argument regarding the applicability of section 15-78-60(5) to this case, they gave only conclusory statements about exceptions (2), (4), and (13) of the statute.Â  Because section 15-78-60 absolves a governmental entity from liability if any one of the criteria enumerated in the statute is satisfied, it follows that, regardless of whether dismissal of the LoPrestisâ€™ action was warranted under section 15-78-60(5), we must accept the trial courtâ€™s findings that the other exceptions cited in the appealed order exempt Rabon Creek from liability.[14]\r\n3.Â  We have considered the LoPrestisâ€™ remaining arguments regarding the substantive merits of their lawsuit:Â  that a jury question exists as to whether Burryâ€™s alteration of the plat amounted to a â€œpositive misrepresentation by conductâ€; that the trial court erred in finding Burry was not required to disclose the easement and in holding their claim for fraudulent concealment was not actionable as a matter of law; that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Burry on their causes of action for negligent or reckless nondisclosure of land defects; that the trial court incorrectly found that Rabon Creek had no duty to prevent the construction of homes within its flood easement; and that the trial court erroneously held no fact issue existed as to whether the doctrine of comparative negligence barred their negligence claim against Rabon Creek.Â  The fact that the LoPrestis had constructive notice of the easement and the absence of any special relationship between the LoPrestis and either Burry or Rabon Creek that would require disclosure of a matter of public record are dispositive of these arguments.[15]\r\n4.Â  The LoPrestis also argue the trial court erred in finding their claims were barred by the equitable doctrine of laches.Â  Having already affirmed the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment on all the LoPrestisâ€™ causes of action, we need not reach this issue.[16]\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n HUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Binkley v.
