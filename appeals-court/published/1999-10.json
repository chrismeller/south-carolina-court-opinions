Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Homeowners' \r\n  Association, Inc. and numerous owners of units in the homeowners' association \r\n  (Sea Cabins) filed this action against the City of North Myrtle Beach alleging \r\n  a taking and condemnation of their private pier. The Master-in-Equity found \r\n  a taking had occurred and awarded Sea Cabins $900,000.00 in compensation. The \r\n  City appeals. We reverse. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins was created by master \r\n  deed in 1980 pursuant to the South Carolina Horizontal Property Regime Act, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-10, et seq. (1976). One of the common elements \r\n  of Sea Cabins was a fishing pier that extended approximately 900 feet into the \r\n  ocean. The pier was built with authorization under Act 499, 1955 S.C. Acts 1083-1084. \r\n  On September 21, 1989, Hurricane Hugo damaged a significant amount of the pier. \r\n  \r\nIn a letter dated February 20, 1990, \r\n  the City informed Sea Cabins it was considering the adoption of an ordinance \r\n  to declare the remaining portion of the pier a nuisance. The resolution, adopted \r\n  on March 6, 1990, stated the pier would be removed if it was not repaired. Several \r\n  extensions were requested and granted for the repair of the pier. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn April 9, 1990, the City passed \r\n  the Beach Franchise Ordinance, which required a license agreement be entered \r\n  into with the City as a condition for obtaining a building permit. The agreement \r\n  being negotiated between Sea Cabins and the City required the pier be open to \r\n  the public. On June 28, 1990, Sea Cabins instituted an action in the United \r\n  States District Court against the City. The action sought declaratory and injunctive \r\n  relief and damages under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 and the United States and South Carolina \r\n  Constitutions. \r\n   \r\nOn July 22, 1992, United States District \r\n  Judge C. Weston Houck ruled the Beach Franchise Ordinance was invalid as it \r\n  applied to Sea Cabins. Other federal theories were tried on May 17 and 18, 1993. \r\n  Judge Henry Coke Morgan entered an order on July 29, 1993, finding Sea Cabins \r\n  had property rights in the pier, and acknowledging the invalidity of the Beach \r\n  Franchise Ordinance. The Court held the remaining issues in abeyance until all \r\n  state remedies have been exhausted. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn August 16, 1990, subsequent to \r\n  the filing of the federal action, the City returned the plans and permit application \r\n  to Sea Cabins, after the Zoning Administrator found the pier had been destroyed, \r\n  not just damaged. The Zoning Board, the Circuit Court, and the South Carolina \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed the Zoning Administrator's ruling. This Court granted \r\n  Sea Cabins' petition for rehearing, withdrew the original opinion, and filed \r\n  a new opinion holding there was no evidence supporting the Zoning Board's finding \r\n  the pier was more than 75% damaged or destroyed. The South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court denied the Zoning Board's petition for writ of certiorari on December \r\n  20, 1993. \r\n   \r\nThis action was commenced on August \r\n  12, 1993. Sea Cabins averred the ordinances and actions of the City and its \r\n  officials resulted in a taking of the pier. Sea Cabins sought compensation based \r\n  upon inverse condemnation of their property. The City answered raising multiple \r\n  defenses. \r\n   \r\nThe City issued Sea Cabins a permit \r\n  on April 19, 1994. After several revisions, construction and repair of the pier \r\n  commenced on October 10, 1994. The pier was completed in June of 1995. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt trial, the Master-in-Equity awarded \r\n  judgment of $900,000.00 to Sea Cabins. The City filed a motion to alter or amend \r\n  pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP. After a hearing, the Master issued \r\n  an additional order on February 24, 1997, partially amending his original order. \r\n  The City appeals. \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  (1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIs a temporary taking compensable \r\n  for inverse condemnation where the property owners have not been deprived of \r\n  \"all economically viable use\" of their property? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nAn action brought by a property owner \r\n  against a municipality for the taking of the owner's property without just compensation \r\n  is an action at law. South Carolina Public Service Authority v. Arnold, \r\n  287 S.C. 584, 340 S.E.2d 535 (1986); Poole v. Combined Utility Sys., \r\n  269 S.C. 271, 237 S.E.2d 82 (1977). Since this action was referred to the Master-in-Equity \r\n  for final judgment with direct appeal to the Supreme Court, this Court will \r\n  correct any error of law. We must affirm the Master's factual findings unless \r\n  there is no evidence reasonably supporting them. Crary v. Djebelli, 329 \r\n  S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998); King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc., 317 S.C. 385, \r\n  453 S.E.2d 885 (1995). Townes Assoc. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 \r\n  S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City argues Sea Cabins' claims \r\n  of inverse condemnation must fail as a matter of law because the ordinances \r\n  and actions only took the pier and not all uses of the property. Further, the \r\n  City maintains since it was only a temporary taking, \"all economically viable \r\n  use\" must be taken before it becomes compensable. We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Recognition \r\n  of a Cause of Action for a Temporary Taking \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe United States Supreme Court first \r\n  recognized that a temporary taking effectuated by regulation could be compensable \r\n  in the case of First English Evangelical Lutheran Church v. County of Los \r\n  Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987). According \r\n  to the Court, \"temporary takings which . . . deny a landowner all use of his \r\n  property, are not different in kind from permanent takings, for which the Constitution \r\n  clearly requires compensation.\" Id. at 318. The Court referred to Justice \r\n  Brennan's dissenting opinion in San Diego Gas &amp; Electric Co. v. San Diego, \r\n  450 U.S. 621, 657, 101 S.Ct. 1287, 1307, 67 L.Ed.2d 551 (1981): \"Nothing in \r\n  the Just Compensation Clause suggests that 'takings' must be permanent and irrevocable.\" \r\n  The Court further noted: \"Invalidation of the ordinance . . ., though converting \r\n  the taking into a 'temporary' one, is not a sufficient remedy to meet the demands \r\n  of the Just Compensation Clause.\" First English Evangelical Lutheran Church, \r\n  482 U.S. at 319. \r\n   \r\nThe United States Supreme Court elucidated \r\n  with clarity the doctrine of temporary takings in the case of Lucas v. South \r\n  Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 112 S.Ct. 2886, 120 L.Ed.2d 798 \r\n  (1992). The 1988 Act that constituted a taking in the Lucas case was \r\n  amended prior to the decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court. However, \r\n  the Court decided to rule on the merits and held no taking of any kind existed. \r\n  See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 376, 404 \r\n  S.E.2d 895 (1991). The United States Supreme Court stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis unusual disposition does not \r\n  preclude Lucas from applying for a permit under the 1990 amendment for future \r\n  construction, and challenging on takings grounds, any denial. But, it does preclude, \r\n  both practically and legally, any takings claim with respect to Lucas's past \r\n  deprivation, i.e., for his having been denied construction rights during the \r\n  period before the 1990 amendment. See generally First English \r\n  Evangelical Lutheran Church of Glendale v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. \r\n  304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, 96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987) (holding that temporary deprivations \r\n  of use are compensable under the Takings Clause). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLucas, 505 U.S. at 1011-1012. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn remand of Lucas, the Court \r\n  explicated: \"Accordingly, the remand of this case from the United States Supreme \r\n  Court has created for Lucas a cause of action for the temporary deprivation \r\n  of the use of his property, unless Coastal Council can demonstrate that Lucas's \r\n  \r\nintended use of his land was not \r\n  part of the bundle of rights inhering in his title.\" Lucas v. Couth Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 424, 427 424 S.E.2d 484, 486 (1992). This Court \r\n  in Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 198, 500 S.E.2d 160, \r\n  164 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. granted, March 3, 1999, relying on \r\n  the federal cases described above, held very succinctly: \"Temporary takings \r\n  are as protected by the Constitution as are permanent ones.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Inverse \r\n  Condemnation \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins brings this action for \r\n  recovery of damages from the alleged inverse condemnation of their fishing pier. \r\n  The elements of an action for inverse condemnation were set out in Gray v. \r\n  South Carolina Dept. of Highways and Public Transp., 311 S.C. 144, 427 S.E.2d \r\n  899 (Ct. App. 1992): (1) an affirmative, positive, aggressive act on the part \r\n  of the governmental agency; (2) a taking; (3) the taking is for a public use; \r\n  and (4) the taking has some degree of permanence. Sea Cabins contends through \r\n  the adoption of the Beach Franchise Ordinance, the Nuisance Resolution, and \r\n  the other actions of the City, there is a claim for the inverse condemnation \r\n  of the pier. The City asseverates Sea Cabins has failed to meet the requisite \r\n  degree of permanence in the fourth element of Gray. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City makes two arguments. The \r\n  first is the alleged taking was only temporary; therefore, Sea Cabins cannot \r\n  meet the fourth requirement. We disagree. If a compensable temporary \r\n  taking has occurred, it can have the requisite degree of permanence as required \r\n  by the fourth element of Gray. See Lucas, supra. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe second is if a temporary taking \r\n  is to be recognized for inverse condemnation purposes, it must meet the requirements \r\n  of a compensable temporary taking as set out in First English Evangelical \r\n  Lutheran Church and Lucas. Sea Cabins claims federal law should not \r\n  apply. However, because South Carolina has recognized compensable temporary \r\n  takings, due to federal law, it is appropriate to utilize the analysis found \r\n  in the federal cases.  \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins relies on Lucas \r\n  in support of its argument that the fourth element is met due to the length \r\n  of time involved, from March 1990 through October 1994. In Lucas, the \r\n  Court found inverse condemnation for a four year taking. Nevertheless, the period \r\n  of the taking is not the important consideration. The causa sine qua non \r\n  of the taking in Lucas is the property owner be deprived of \"all economically \r\n  viable use.\"  \r\n   \r\nPrior to Lucas, only permanent \r\n  takings were considered for inverse condemnation. Since the courts of this state \r\n  have recognized temporary takings through Lucas and Staubes, they \r\n  are now considered for inverse condemnation. However, when deciding if a temporary \r\n  taking rises to the requisite degree of permanence required by Gray, \r\n  the court must find a compensable temporary taking. The analysis for a compensable \r\n  temporary taking must be juxtaposed with the fourth element in Gray in \r\n  adjudicating if the actions of the City qualify as inverse condemnation.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Ownership \r\n  of the Pier \r\n   \r\nWhen one views whether property was \r\n  taken, the analysis is based upon the \"parcel as a whole\". See Penn \r\n  Central Transportation Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 57 S.Ct. 631 \r\n  (1978). The taking must be of the entire parcel and not just one portion. In \r\n  the case sub judice, the ownership of the pier must be resolved, \r\n  as well as the extent of the parcel to be analyzed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe pier was considered a common \r\n  element as defined in the Horizontal Property Act of South Carolina. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 27-31-30(f) (1991). The trial court agreed the pier was a common element. \r\n  Relying on the Master Deed, deeds from the Horry County Courthouse, rental documents \r\n  from various rental companies, and documents from homeowners including tax returns, \r\n  the trial court concluded: \"Plaintiffs are the owners of the Sea Cabins pier, \r\n  a common element of the Sea Cabins on the Ocean IV Property Regime.\" \r\nSea Cabins admitted the pier was \r\n  a common element. In their brief, Sea Cabins acknowledges the losses were from \r\n  the \"taking of a common element of a horizontal property regime. . . . All of \r\n  the units share equally in the benefits of the pier as it has been rebuilt.\" \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe federal courts found the pier \r\n  was a common element owned by all the homeowners. The trial court said: \"The \r\n  federal court ruled that the Sea Cabins pier is an appurtenance to the real \r\n  estate above the high water mark and it is indisputably owned by the plaintiff. \r\n  The Court further found that the pier is a common element of the horizontal \r\n  property regime.\" \r\n   \r\nHaving found the pier is a common \r\n  element, we look to ownership of the common elements in a horizontal property \r\n  regime. The trial court stated: \"The common element pier is an indivisible part \r\n  of each homeowner[']s property. For the purposes of this present condemnation \r\n  action, each apartment with its share of the common elements is a single parcel \r\n  of property.\" Pursuant to The Horizontal Property Act: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn apartment owner shall have the \r\n  exclusive ownership of his apartment and shall have a common right to share, \r\n  with the other co-owners, in the common elements of the property, equivalent \r\n  to the percentage representing the value of the individual apartment, with relation \r\n  to the value of the whole property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-31-60(a) (1991). \r\n  Sea Cabins' Master Deed provides: \"Ownership of a Unit includes title to an \r\n  apartment and an undivided interest in the Common Elements and the Common Surplus.\" \r\n  The pier is not \"a property interest in and of itself.\" A percentage of the \r\n  pier, as a common element, is obviously encapsulated in the \"bundle of sticks\" \r\n  belonging to each individual homeowner. The parcel owned by each homeowner encompasses \r\n  his share of the pier, and other common elements, as well as the individual \r\n  residence. \r\n   \r\nIV. Parcel \r\n  as a Whole \r\n   \r\nAnalyzing actions of governmental \r\n  entities to determine if a compensable taking has occurred, we view the portion \r\n  taken in relation to the \"parcel as a whole.\" See Penn Central Transportation \r\n  Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 98 S.Ct. 2646, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978). \r\n  Sea Cabins directs our attention solely to the pier to ascertain what was taken. \r\n  However, the pier is not a discrete segment of the property that is owned. Our \r\n  focus is on the parcel as a whole.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Penn Central, the Supreme \r\n  Court instructed:  \r\n   \r\n'Taking' jurisprudence does not divide \r\n  a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether rights \r\n  in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. In deciding whether a \r\n  particular governmental action has effected a taking, this Court focuses rather \r\n  both on the character of the action and on the nature and extent of the interference \r\n  with rights in the parcel as a whole. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n438 U.S. at 130-131. The Court repeated \r\n  this fundamental analysis in Concrete Pipe and Products, Inc. v. Construction \r\n  Laborers Pension Trust, 508 U.S. 602, 113 S.Ct. 2264, 124 L.Ed. 2d 539 (1993). \r\n  In that case, Concrete Pipe argued: \"The property of [Concrete Pipe] which is \r\n  taken, is taken in its entirety.\" Id. at 643. The Supreme Court in Concrete \r\n  Pipe expounded: \r\n   \r\n[W]e rejected this analysis years \r\n  ago in Penn Central Transp. Co. v. New York City, 438 U.S. 104, 130-131, \r\n  98 S.Ct. 2646, 2662, 57 L.Ed.2d 631 (1978), where we held that a claimant's \r\n  parcel of property could not first be divided into what was taken and what was \r\n  left for the purpose of demonstrating the taking of the former to be complete \r\n  and hence compensable. To the extent that any portion of property is taken, \r\n  that portion is always taken in its entirety; the relevant question, however, \r\n  is whether the property taken is all, or only a portion of, the parcel in question. \r\n  Accord, Keystone Bituminous Coal Assn. v. DeBenedictis, 480 U.S. \r\n  470, 497, 107 S.Ct. 1232, 1248, 94 L.Ed.2d 472 (1987) (\"[O]ur test for regulatory \r\n  taking requires us to compare the value that has been taken from the property \r\n  with the value that remains in the property, [and] one of the critical questions \r\n  is determining how to define the unit of property 'whose value is to furnish \r\n  the denominator of the fraction'\") (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n508 U.S. at 643-644. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court held the pier was \r\n  taken by the actions of the City. However, the appropriate query is not whether \r\n  the pier was taken in its entirety, but what portion of the entire property \r\n  owned by the homeowners was taken. If the entire parcel is not deprived of \"all \r\n  economically viable use,\" then there is no compensable taking. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins challenges the application \r\n  of federal cases to the issue in this case. However, the South Carolina Supreme \r\n  Court, in Beard v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 205, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d 620 (1991), annunciated:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is important to note at the outset \r\n  that the Beards' complaints concern only a portion of their property. . . . \r\n  As an initial matter, the Beards' approach to a \"takings\" contention in the \r\n  context of a zoning regulation is inaccurate. \"'Taking' jurisprudence does not \r\n  divide a single parcel into discrete segments and attempt to determine whether \r\n  rights in a particular segment have been entirely abrogated. . . . [The] Court \r\n  focuses rather . . . on the . . . parcel as a whole.\" (Citing Penn Central, \r\n  supra.) \r\n   \r\nBeard, 304 S.C. at 207-208, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 622. Using the \"parcel as a whole\" analysis, the Beard Court \r\n  denied compensation where only a portion of the land was taken and the remaining \r\n  land was still used by the property owners. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nV. Takings \r\n  Analysis / \"All Economically Viable Use\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins contends we should not \r\n  look to federal law, but only to state law to determine if a compensable temporary \r\n  taking has occurred. However, the only South Carolina cases recognizing temporary \r\n  takings have relied on the federal takings analysis in First English Evangelical \r\n  Lutheran Church v. County of Los Angeles, 482 U.S. 304, 107 S.Ct. 2378, \r\n  96 L.Ed.2d 250 (1987). See Lucas v. Couth Carolina Coastal Council, \r\n  309 S.C. 424, 424 S.E.2d 484, (1992).; Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, \r\n  331 S.C. 192, 500 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. granted, March \r\n  3, 1999.  \r\nThe City professes a property owner \r\n  must be \"deprived of all economically viable use of its property,\" before the \r\n  deprivation can be compensable. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Staubes, this Court cited \r\n  First English Evangelical Lutheran Church and Lucas for the proposition \r\n  that a landowner must be deprived of \"all use of his property\" before a temporary \r\n  taking is compensable. Staubes, 331 S.C. at 199, 500 S.E.2d at 164. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn First English Evangelical Lutheran \r\n  Church, the United States Supreme Court held: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n'[T]emporary' takings which . . . \r\n  deny a landowner all use of his property, are not different in kind from \r\n  permanent takings, for which the Constitution clearly requires compensation. \r\n  . . .  \r\n   \r\n . . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . We also point out that the \r\n  allegation of the complaint which we treat as true for purposes of our decision \r\n  was that the ordinance in question denied appellant all use of its property. \r\n  . . .   \r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . Here we must assume that the \r\n  Los Angeles County ordinance has denied appellant all use of its property \r\n  for a considerable period of years, and we hold that invalidation of the ordinance \r\n  without payment of fair value for the use of the property during this period \r\n  of time would be a constitutionally insufficient remedy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n482 U.S. at 318-22 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court in Lucas noted the \r\n  importance of the property owner being deprived of all use of his property. \r\n  Lucas edifies as follows: \"[T]he Fifth Amendment is violated when land-use \r\n  regulation 'does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or denies \r\n  an owner economically viable use of his land.'\" Lucas, 505 U.S. \r\n  at 1016 (quoting Agins v. City of Tiburon, 447 U.S. 255, 260, 100 S.Ct. \r\n  2138, 2141, 65 L.Ed.2d 106 (1980)) (emphasis in original). The Court averred: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe think, in short, that there are \r\n  good reasons for our frequently expressed belief that when the owner of real \r\n  property has been called upon to sacrifice all economically beneficial \r\n  uses in the name of the common good, that is, to leave his property economically \r\n  idle, he has suffered a taking. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 1019 (footnote omitted) \r\n  (emphasis in original). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Lucas Court observed: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhere the State seeks to sustain \r\n  regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, we \r\n  think it may resist compensation only if the logically antecedent inquiry into \r\n  the nature of the owner's estate shows that the proscribed use interests were \r\n  not part of his title to begin with. This accords, we think, with our \"takings\" \r\n  jurisprudence, which has traditionally been guided by the understandings of \r\n  our citizens regarding the content of, and the State's power over, the \"bundle \r\n  of rights\" that they acquire when they obtain title to property. It seems to \r\n  us that the property owner necessarily expects the uses of his property to be \r\n  restricted, from time to time, by various measures newly enacted by the State \r\n  in legitimate exercise of its police powers; \"[a]s long recognized, some values \r\n  are enjoyed under an implied limitation and must yield to the police power.\" \r\n  Pennsylvania Coal Co. v. Mahon, 260 U.S., at 413, 43 S.Ct., at 159. . \r\n  . . In the case of land, however, we think the notion pressed by the Council \r\n  that title is somehow held subject to the \"implied&nbsp;limitation\" that the \r\n  State may subsequently eliminate all economically valuable use is inconsistent \r\n  with the historical compact recorded in the Takings Clause that has become part \r\n  of our constitutional culture. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 1027-1028 (emphasis \r\n  added)(footnotes omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis Court applied the deprivation \r\n  of \"all economically beneficial use\" standard in McQueen v. South Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council, 329 S.C. 588, 496 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. App. 1998). Citing Lucas \r\n  for approval of the standard that the landowner must be deprived of \"all economically \r\n  beneficial use\" before a taking is compensable, the Court explicated:\r\nMcQueen testified that he is unable \r\n  to do anything with either lot, including park a boat on one. The only use of \r\n  the land available to McQueen after the permit denials the Council could show \r\n  was \"[r]ecreational, aesthetic use\" that the Council's own expert testified \r\n  is \"really probably not directly recreational.\" The Council employee conceded \r\n  that the recreational value to McQueen is \"kind of indirect,\" stating, \"I don't \r\n  think Mr. McQueen would like everybody to come out there to crab or fish on \r\n  his lots.\" This use does not truly benefit McQueen. We hold McQueen has suffered \r\n  a textbook taking. \r\n   \r\nMcQueen, 329 S.C. at 600, \r\n  496 S.E2d at 650.\r\nIn Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, \r\n  331 S.C. 192, 201, 500 S.E.2d 160, 165-66 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. granted, \r\n  March 3, 1999, this Court found: \"In this case, the City's actions did not deprive \r\n  Staubes of all economically viable use of his land. . . . Even though Staubes \r\n  may not have been able to use his property as he desired, this limitation does \r\n  not rise to the level of a constitutional taking.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVI. Application of \r\n  Takings Analysis to Sea Cabins \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City maintains the homeowners \r\n  at Sea Cabins have not been deprived of \"all economically viable use\" of their \r\n  property, and therefore, they have not suffered a compensable temporary taking. \r\n  We agree. \r\n   \r\nThe trial court failed to address \r\n  this issue in its original order. The City filed a motion to alter or amend \r\n  pursuant to Rules 52(b) and 59(e), SCRCP, requesting the trial court to address \r\n  the defense and make appropriate findings of fact and conclusions of law. The \r\n  trial court responded:  \r\n   \r\nThe first alleged defense appears \r\n  to be a regulatory takings argument. However, this defense does not appear in \r\n  defendant's Answer. Defendant's arguments that its interpretation of federal \r\n  authority precludes an inverse condemnation when only the pier is taken is not \r\n  persuasion [sic]. \r\n   \r\nA defendant is not required to plead \r\n  in its answer the defense that the plaintiff has not been deprived of all economically \r\n  viable use. The burden is upon the plaintiff to prove the temporary taking has \r\n  occurred and is compensable. One of the elements that must be proven is the \r\n  temporary taking deprived the property owner of \"all economically viable use\" \r\n  of the property. \r\n   \r\nThe facts of Staubes v. City of \r\n  Folly Beach, 331 S.C. 192, 500 S.E.2d 160 (Ct. App. 1998), cert. \r\n  granted, March 3, 1999, are remarkably similar to the instant case. Staubes \r\n  owned a rental apartment building which was damaged by Hurricane Hugo. He was \r\n  originally granted a building permit for repairs. However, if the property was \r\n  damaged by more than 50 percent then Staubes could not rebuild unless the construction \r\n  met the new requirements. Staubes' property was found to be more than 50 percent \r\n  damaged and therefore a condemnation order was issued requiring him to meet \r\n  the City's new construction requirements. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStaubes appealed the decision to \r\n  the Zoning Board of Adjustment and the circuit court, both of which upheld the \r\n  revocation of the permit. This Court reversed stating there was no evidentiary \r\n  support for the finding of more than 50 percent damage. Staubes then brought \r\n  the action against the City of Folly Beach alleging: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[T]he City's actions prevented him \r\n  from performing any repairs on the property, leaving the property uninhabitable \r\n  and unrentable during the appeal process. He averred the City's conduct deprived \r\n  him of all beneficial use of the property without just compensation.\r\nId., 331 S.C. at 196, 500 \r\n  S.E.2d at 163.  \r\n   \r\nThe Staubes Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the City's actions \r\n  did not deprive Staubes of all economically viable use of his land. Never \r\n  in this dispute did the City inform Staubes he could not rebuild his house under \r\n  any circumstances. Rather, the City informed Staubes he was required to comply \r\n  with applicable building codes before he repaired his house. In his deposition, \r\n  Staubes conceded that if he had complied with the applicable building codes \r\n  in January of 1991, he could have rented the building on either a monthly or \r\n  weekly basis. Staubes claimed he could have rented the house for prices that \r\n  houses rented for in brochures he offered as exhibits. These prices ranged from \r\n  $600 a week to $1,695 a week during the summer. Staubes had an economically \r\n  viable use of the building available to him; albeit, he chose not to use it. \r\n  Even though Staubes may not have been able to use the property as he desired, \r\n  this limitation does not rise to the level of a constitutional taking. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Staubes was not deprived \r\n  of all economically viable use of his property, the City's actions did \r\n  not result in an uncompensated taking of Staubes's property.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStaubes, 331 S.C. at 201-02, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 165-66 (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the applicable standard of \r\n  review, we peruse the record to determine if there is any evidence showing \r\n  a deprivation of \"all economically viable use\" caused by the actions \r\n  of the City. The property involved is the entire unit owned by the homeowners \r\n  and not just the pier itself. Each unit is used for its own individual purpose: \r\n  a primary residence; vacation property; rental property; or business property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe record contains the testimony \r\n  of many members of the homeowners' association that owned units during the time \r\n  of the alleged taking. David Whitley, a homeowner, testified regarding his use \r\n  during the alleged taking: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Now, from 1990 to 1994 did you \r\n    use that unit?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did I personally use it?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did you personally use that unit?\r\n\r\n\r\n  I'm sure I did. Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did you rent that unit?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Some portion of that time.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Can you tell me what portion?\r\n\r\n\r\n  I think I stopped renting my unit \r\n    in 1991.\r\n\r\n\r\n  So in 1990 and 1991 you did rent?\r\n\r\n\r\n  I believe that is true, yes. \r\n    \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n  So the fact that the pier was \r\n    not there didn't stop you from using your unit, did it?\r\n\r\n\r\n  It did not stop me from using \r\n    my unit, no. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nThis is one example of a homeowner \r\n  who was able to rent his unit and retain an economically viable use while the \r\n  pier was not allowed to be rebuilt. Another property owner, Alexander Macklin, \r\n  provided testimony concerning the amounts he received in rent in 1994 and 1995. \r\n  During the alleged taking, he received lower rental income, however, his property \r\n  was rented in 1992 and 1994. While he may not have received the amount he desired, \r\n  Macklin was not deprived of all economic benefit.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSea Cabins' expert witness testified \r\n  the damages to the plaintiffs were loss of rents. The expert calculated the \r\n  amounts by examining 44 units which were rented before and during the alleged \r\n  taking and comparing the value of the income. Obviously, his testimony shows \r\n  the units still retained some economic value. Other homeowners testified to \r\n  buying their units during the time of the alleged taking, demonstrating the \r\n  units retained some value, unlike the property in Lucas and McQueen. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is not just the pier that has \r\n  to be taken. The pier is but one piece of the whole. The entire value of the \r\n  property owned by the homeowners must be taken by the actions of the City before \r\n  a compensable temporary taking results. Sea Cabins acknowledged in its brief: \r\n  \"If the entire condominium complex were taken instead of just the pier, the \r\n  rental value lost would be much greater.\" We find no evidence Sea Cabins \r\n  was deprived of \"all economically viable use\" of its property. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nVII. CONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold a compensable temporary taking \r\n  did not occur under the First English, Lucas, and Staubes \r\n  analysis. The homeowners at Sea Cabins were not deprived of \"all economically \r\n  viable use\" of their property. While the pier could not be utilized as desired, \r\n  and some homeowners may have suffered lower than expected returns, the homeowners \r\n  continued utilizing their property in an economically beneficial manner. We \r\n  rule the City's actions did not constitute an inverse condemnation of \r\n  the homeowners' property under Gray. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, the decision of the \r\n  Master-in-Equity is \r\n   \r\nREVERSED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1. The \r\n  City raised a total of 20 issues on appeal. Since the reversal is based solely \r\n  on the first issue, we need not address the remaining issues. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3052","title":"State v.

Sierra appeals his \r\n  conviction, arguing the trial judge committed reversible error by allowing the \r\n  assistant solicitor to impeach a defense witness during cross-examination with \r\n  a prior inconsistent statement allegedly made to the assistant solicitor. We \r\n  reverse and remand for a new trial. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nOn April 29, 1997, Sierra and a co-defendant, \r\n  Jaime Savceda, were stopped by a sheriff's deputy on I-85 for making an improper \r\n  lane change. During the traffic stop, Sierra consented to a search of the trunk, \r\n  which led to the discovery of fourteen and one-half pounds of marijuana packaged \r\n  in plastic bags. \r\n   \r\nSavceda and Sierra were arrested \r\n  and indicted for trafficking in marijuana. They received a joint trial beginning \r\n  January 5, 1998. At the close of the State's case, Savceda pleaded guilty. Sierra \r\n  then called Savceda as his witness. Savceda testified on direct examination \r\n  that the marijuana belonged to him, and Sierra knew nothing about it. On cross-examination, \r\n  the assistant solicitor attempted to impeach Savceda with inconsistent statements \r\n  he allegedly made to her in a pretrial meeting between counsel, which Savceda \r\n  attended. This cross-examination culminated in the following exchange: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. [assistant solicitor] And when \r\n  I said the drugs were found in the trunk you said - -  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDefense Counsel: Objection, \r\n  your honor. If she wants to submit herself as a witness, that's fine with me, \r\n  but if she's going to testify as to what she was told, she needs to be sworn. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: No, sir. Overruled. \r\n  Go ahead. \r\n   \r\nQ. And you said, \"It wasn't mine. \r\n  It belonged to the other guy.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn response, Savceda denied the statement, \r\n  and remained steadfast in his testimony that the marijuana belonged to him. \r\n  The assistant solicitor did not attempt to withdraw in order to testify under \r\n  oath about the alleged prior inconsistent statement, and no independent evidence \r\n  was presented to establish it. Notwithstanding this failure of proof, the solicitor \r\n  argued her version of the prior conversation to the jury in her closing argument. \r\n  The jury found Sierra guilty as charged. This appeal follows. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSierra argues the trial court erred \r\n  by overruling his objection to the assistant solicitor's cross-examination because \r\n  by posing the question the assistant solicitor essentially testified before \r\n  the jury as to the content of the prior inconsistent statement without being \r\n  sworn or subjected to cross-examination. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPreliminarily, we note that Savceda \r\n  testified only after he had entered his plea of guilty to the charge. Thus, \r\n  he was no longer a co-defendant. He testified through an interpreter, and maintained \r\n  that he did not understand English well enough to answer questions without one. \r\n  He consistently stated that he was responsible for the marijuana, and Sierra \r\n  had no knowledge of it. Savceda did not deny being present during the pre-trial \r\n  meeting with the assistant solicitor, but he stated that no interpreter was \r\n  present and he did not adequately understand the conversation. The assistant \r\n  solicitor contested Savceda's need for an interpreter throughout cross-examination \r\n  and in closing argument. Sierra's lack of knowledge of the marijuana was his \r\n  defense, and the credibility of Savceda's testimony was unquestionably important \r\n  to the case.\r\nRule 613 (b), SCRE, is the general \r\n  rule for impeachment by a prior inconsistent statement and requires laying the \r\n  foundation for the question by advising the witness of the substance of the \r\n  prior inconsistent statement, the time and place it was given, and the person \r\n  to whom it was made.(1) Only if the witness denies \r\n  having made the prior inconsistent statement is extrinsic evidence admissible. \r\n  With this requirement, the witness is presented with sufficient information \r\n  to admit the prior statement, deny it, or explain it. See State v. \r\n  Hampton, 79 S.C. 179, 60 S.E. 669 (1908). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhere the prior inconsistent statement \r\n  was allegedly made to the cross-examiner, there is a danger of harm inherent \r\n  in \"laying the foundation.\" By posing the question the cross-examiner necessarily \r\n  publishes his or her version of the prior inconsistent statement, with the natural \r\n  result of pitting the cross-examiner's memory and credibility against that of \r\n  the witness. This procedure also implicates the cross-examiner as a witness \r\n  because, absent written or recorded statements, the natural source of the extrinsic \r\n  proof of the prior inconsistent statement contemplated by Rule 613 is the testimony \r\n  of the person to whom it was made.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur courts have consistently held \r\n  that the scope and extent of cross-examination is a matter within the sound \r\n  discretion of the trial judge. State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  595 (1991); State v. Colf, 332 S.C. 313, 504 S.E.2d 360 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  This court will not disturb the trial judge's decision unless appellant shows \r\n  both prejudice and an abuse of discretion. Id. (showing of prejudice \r\n  required); State v. Sprouse, 325 S.C. 275, 478 S.E.2d 871 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (showing of manifest abuse of discretion required); State v. Hale, 284 \r\n  S.C. 348, 326 S.E.2d 418 (Ct. App.1985) (A case may be reversed on the ground \r\n  that the trial judge permitted leading questions only if there has been a clear \r\n  abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice to the objecting party.).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHistorically, it has been the rule \r\n  in South Carolina that: \r\n   \r\n[t]he cross-examination of a witness \r\n  to test his credibility is largely within the discretion of the trial judge. \r\n  . . . 'Considerable latitude is allowed in the cross-examination of a witness \r\n  (always within the control and direction of the presiding judge) to test the \r\n  accuracy of his memory, his bias, prejudice, interest, or credibility. In doing \r\n  so the witness may be asked questions in reference to irrelevant matter, or \r\n  in reference to prior statements contradictory of his testimony, or in reference \r\n  to statements as to relevant matter not contradictory of his testimony.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMcMillan v. Ridges, 229 S.C. \r\n  76, 80-81, 91 S.E.2d 883, 885 (1956) (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThough it is proper to elicit testimony \r\n  by leading questions on cross-examination, it is generally recognized as improper \r\n  for the cross-examiner to testify by making statements of fact. See State \r\n  v. Pee Dee News Co., 286 S.C. 562, 336 S.E.2d 8 (1985) (prosecutorial misconduct \r\n  denied defendant a fair trial where prosecutor exceeded permissible latitude \r\n  in cross-examination by repeatedly employing hypothetical question without factual \r\n  basis in record either at time of asking or at close of evidence); State \r\n  v. Reed, 259 S.C. 392, 192 S.E.2d 207 (1972); State v. Outen, 237 \r\n  S.C. 514, 526, 118 S.E.2d 175, 182 (1961) (\"Such cross-examination is subject \r\n  to the discretionary control of the trial [j]udge who should restrain its abuse. \r\n  The cross-examiner must be fair and act in good faith. The matters inquired \r\n  about should not be merely chimerical, or drawn from the vivid imagination of \r\n  opposing counsel, but the inquiry should be directed only to those matters concerning \r\n  which the cross-examiner has information warranting a reasonable belief on his \r\n  part that the fact is as is implied by the question.\" (citation omitted)). See \r\n  also Self v. Dye, 516 S.W.2d 397, 400 (Ark. 1974) (\"[C]ross-examiner \r\n  may be restricted in posing argumentative questions or addressing a question \r\n  to a witness that erroneously assumes that a material fact has been proved or \r\n  that the witness has testified to such facts on direct examination. The right \r\n  to ask leading questions does not license the examiner to testify, in effect, \r\n  by making statements of fact.\"); People v. Johnson, 175 Cal. Rptr. 8 \r\n  (Ct. App. 3d Dist. Cal. 1981); People v. Mangine, 424 N.Y.S.2d 75, 75 \r\n  (N.Y. App. Div. 1979) (\"The prosecutor improperly made himself an unsworn witness \r\n  when he endeavored to impeach defendant's alibi witness by asking him on cross-examination \r\n  about prior inconsistent statements that the witness made to the prosecutor \r\n  in a telephone conversation.\"); State v. DePriest, 697 S.W.2d 597, 600 \r\n  (Tenn. Crim. App.1985) (\"Leading questions are permissible in cross-examination \r\n  but the examiner is not allowed to testify or introduce evidence.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this regard, our supreme court \r\n  recognized long ago that prejudice may result from the question, irrespective \r\n  of the answer. In Entzminger v. Seigler, the court noted \"[t]he probable \r\n  and, no doubt, logical result of improper questioning is to give the jury the \r\n  impression that the facts assumed actually exist, and that the reason why the \r\n  opposite party objects to the questions is that he is trying to keep such facts \r\n  from the jury.\"186 S.C. 194, 195 S.E. 244, 246 (1938). See also \r\n  State v. Pee Dee News Co., 286 S.C. 562, 336 S.E.2d 8 (1985). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 613 allows a question to be \r\n  posed which asserts an inconsistent prior statement even though there is no \r\n  basis for it in the record at the time of the asking, and the rule provides \r\n  for extrinsic proof of the inconsistent statement in the event the witness denies \r\n  it. The rule does not explicitly require extrinsic proof of the prior inconsistent \r\n  statement in the event of denial by the witness. However, there are cases from \r\n  other jurisdictions concluding that the failure to introduce extrinsic evidence \r\n  of the alleged prior inconsistent statement after it has been published in cross-examination \r\n  to the jury and denied by the witness can be reversible error in a criminal \r\n  case because it denies the defendant the right of confrontation. See \r\n  United States v. Silverstein, 737 F.2d 864, 868 (10th Cir. 1984) (\"[A] \r\n  prosecutor may not use impeachment as a guise for submitting to the jury substantive \r\n  evidence that is otherwise unavailable.\"); United States v. Bohle, 445 \r\n  F.2d 54, 74 (7th Cir. 1971) (\"the duty to follow up foundation with evidence \r\n  is breached at the risk of reversal of any tainted victory\"); State v. Amos, \r\n  490 S.W.2d 328 (Mo.Ct.App.1972); State v. Babich, 842 P.2d 1053 (Wash.Ct.App \r\n  1993) (The prosecutor's failure to introduce extrinsic evidence to prove alleged \r\n  prior inconsistent statements in order to rebut defense witnesses' denials of \r\n  making statements constituted reversible error of constitutional magnitude, \r\n  in violation of the defendant's Sixth Amendment right of confrontation). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen the prior inconsistent statement \r\n  was allegedly made to the prosecuting attorney, the availability of extrinsic \r\n  evidence to establish the statement is directly linked to the ability of the \r\n  prosecuting attorney to appear as a witness in the trial. Our research indicates \r\n  no absolute prohibition against a prosecuting attorney becoming a witness for \r\n  the State. See 81 Am Jur 2d Â§ 229 Witnesses (1992). However, it \r\n  is certainly disfavored, as our supreme court noted in State v. Lee. \r\n  203 S.C. 536, 28 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1943) (\"The courts clearly look with disfavor \r\n  upon a prosecuting attorney's participation in a case as a witness for the State \r\n  except under unavoidable circumstances.\"). The solicitor is an officer of the \r\n  court, who undertakes a more active role in the courtroom than that of a witness. \r\n  The solicitor interacts throughout the trial with opposing counsel, witnesses \r\n  and the court, continuing to impose his or her presence upon the jury. The court \r\n  accords the solicitor and other participating counsel certain deference out \r\n  of respect for their role as officers of the court. In short, \"[t]he justified \r\n  reluctance of courts to permit the prosecutor to become a witness in the case \r\n  reflects the belief that the jury will accord far greater weight to [his or \r\n  her] testimony than to that of an ordinary witness, by virtue of the prosecutor's \r\n  personal prestige and official status.\" People v. Langdon, 415 N.E.2d \r\n  578, 583 (Ill.App. 1980). \r\n   \r\nThis pitfall is reflected in Rule \r\n  3.7 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, which reads as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRULE 3.7 LAWYER AS WITNESS \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(a) A lawyer shall not act as advocate \r\n  at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary witness except where: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) The testimony relates to an uncontested \r\n  issue; \r\n   \r\n(2) The testimony relates to the \r\n  nature and value of legal services rendered in the case; or \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(3) Disqualification of the lawyer \r\n  would work substantial hardship on the client. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(b) A lawyer may act as advocate \r\n  in a trial in which another lawyer in the lawyer's firm is likely to be called \r\n  as a witness unless precluded from doing so by Rule 1.7 or Rule 1.9. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOf particular significance is the \r\n  comment to Rule 3.7, which notes that: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The opposing party has proper objection \r\n  where the combination of roles may prejudice that party's rights in the litigation. \r\n  A witness is required to testify on the basis of personal knowledge, while an \r\n  advocate is expected to explain and comment on evidence given by others. It \r\n  may not be clear whether a statement by an advocate-witness should be taken \r\n  as proof or as an analysis of the proof. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRule 407, SCACR. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n The difficulty of differentiating \r\n  whether a statement \"by an advocate-witness should be taken as proof or as an \r\n  analysis of the proof,\" as noted in the above quoted comments to Rule 3.7, is \r\n  illustrated by what occurred in this case. Though the witness denied the inconsistent \r\n  statements, the solicitor argued her version of the statements as facts to the \r\n  jury in her closing argument, as if her version was supported by evidence. Blurring \r\n  the lines between attorney and witness during cross-examination set the stage \r\n  for this improper closing argument. The closing argument, standing alone, would \r\n  have been grounds for reversal if it had been properly preserved by objection. \r\n  See State v. Coleman, 301 S.C. 57, 61, 389 S.E.2d 659, 661 (1990) \r\n  (\"the jury . . .was effectively presented with testimony from the solicitor \r\n  as if he had taken the stand himself.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe are sympathetic to the predicament \r\n  confronting the assistant solicitor when Sierra's co-defendant pleaded guilty \r\n  during trial and for the first time claimed responsibility for the marijuana. \r\n  Until that occurrence, she could not reasonably have anticipated that she could \r\n  become a witness in the case. The dilemma was all the more difficult because, \r\n  as the record reflects, she had no co-counsel involved in the trial who could \r\n  take over the prosecution and allow her to withdraw in order to be a witness. \r\n  See People v. Langdon, 415 N.E.2d 578, 583 (Ill. App. 1980) (no \r\n  prejudicial error shown where prosecuting attorney became witness in rebuttal, \r\n  but court restricted closing argument so that co-counsel gave closing argument \r\n  on those factual issues presented by prosecuting attorney's testimony). However, \r\n  under these circumstances we conclude the unavailability of extrinsic evidence \r\n  to establish the alleged prior inconsistent statement was readily ascertainable \r\n  at the time the offending questions were asked on cross-examination. Allowing \r\n  the questions posed by the assistant solicitor interjected facts in a manner \r\n  which did not allow for cross-examination to test their credibility. Consequently, \r\n  the trial judge erred in overruling the objection. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGenerally, the right to cross-examine \r\n  a prosecuting witness is of constitutional dimensions, being essential to a \r\n  fair trial as guaranteed by the Sixth Amendment and the due process clause of \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. McCoy, 274 S.C. 70, 261 S.E.2d 159 \r\n  (1979); see also State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d \r\n  525 (1994) (The right to meaningful cross-examination of adverse witnesses is \r\n  specifically included in a defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confront witnesses.); \r\n  accord State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe only reference in the record \r\n  indicating Savceda ever denied the marijuana belonged to him was contained in \r\n  the solicitor's questions during her cross-examination of Savceda and in her \r\n  closing argument. Although Savceda denied the statements, we conclude the cross-examination \r\n  allowed an unfair assault upon the credibility of his denial on this most critical \r\n  issue, in violation of Sierra's Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment right of confrontation. \r\n  See State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 196, 498 S.E.2d 642, 645-46 \r\n  (1998) (\"As a general rule, a trial court's ruling on the proper scope of cross-examination \r\n  will not be disturbed absent a manifest abuse of discretion. This rule is subject, \r\n  however, to the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a defendant's right to a 'meaningful' \r\n  cross-examination. [A] criminal defendant states a violation of the Confrontation \r\n  Clause by showing that he was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate \r\n  cross-examination designed to show a prototypical form of bias on the part of \r\n  the witness, and thereby 'to expose to the jury the facts from which the jurors \r\n  . . . could appropriately draw inferences relating to the reliability of the \r\n  witness.'\"). \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we conclude the trial \r\n  court erred in allowing the assistant solicitor to exceed the permissible latitude \r\n  accorded in cross-examination by publishing allegedly first hand knowledge of \r\n  prior inconsistent statements, when there was no factual basis for the assertions \r\n  in the record at the time of the asking, and no extrinsic evidence available \r\n  to prove them in the event of denial. See State v. Pee Dee News Co., \r\n  286 S.C. 562, 336 S.E.2d 8 (1985); see also United States v. \r\n  Silverstein, 737 F.2d 864, 868 (10th Cir. 1984) (\"Although a prosecutor \r\n  may impeach a witness on the basis of prior inconsistent statements . . . a \r\n  prosecutor may not use impeachment as a guise for submitting to the jury substantive \r\n  evidence that is otherwise unavailable.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe respondent argues that the cross-examination \r\n  was proper under the authority of State v. Reed, 259 S.C. 392, 192 S.E.2D \r\n  207 (1972). We disagree. In Reed our supreme court found no reversible \r\n  error where a solicitor attempted to refresh a prosecution witness's memory \r\n  by asking the witness, \"But last night you said _ _.\" Reed, 259 S.C. \r\n  at 396, 192 S.E.2d at 208. However, this case is distinguishable from Reed \r\n  for at least two reasons. First, Reed involved a different objection. \r\n  Prior to our adoption of Rule 607, SCRE, the party who called a witness was \r\n  said to vouch for the witness's credibility, and it was improper to impeach \r\n  one's own witness unless the witness was first declared hostile. State v. \r\n  Anderson, 304 S.C. 551, 406 S.E.2d 152 (1991). The objection in Reed \r\n  was that the State was improperly attempting to impeach its own witness. Second, \r\n  the solicitor in Reed abandoned the question before stating it, and did not \r\n  attempt to so question the witness again. Therefore, the solicitor never published \r\n  his version of the prior statement to the jury. \r\nConcluding the allowance of the offending \r\n  questions was error, we must now determine if the error was harmless. The violation \r\n  of the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is not per se reversible error, \r\n  but depends upon a host of factors. \"These factors include the importance of \r\n  the witness's testimony in the prosecution's case, whether the testimony was \r\n  cumulative, the presence or absence of corroborating or contradicting testimony \r\n  by the witness, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, as well \r\n  as the overall strength of the prosecution's case.\" Delaware v. Van Arsdall, \r\n  475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986); State v. Smith 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 \r\n  (1994); State v. Graham 314 S.C. 383, 444 S.E.2d 525 (1994)). \r\n   \r\nThe alleged prior inconsistent statements \r\n  directly controverted the testimony of the defense witness on the critical issue \r\n  of knowledge and possession of the marijuana. The State's case against Sierra \r\n  was otherwise circumstantial, depending in large part upon the jury's interpretation \r\n  of Sierra's role as driver of the car, the significance of a large number of \r\n  air fresheners hanging in the car, and the credibility of Sierra's description \r\n  of his trip itinerary in light of the lack of clothing and normal travel gear \r\n  found in the car. We conclude the credibility of Savceda's testimony accepting \r\n  sole responsibility for the marijuana was crucial. There was no other evidence \r\n  offered to dispute Savceda's testimony. Under these circumstances, the error \r\n  was not harmless.\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the reasons discussed above, \r\n  Sierra's conviction for trafficking in marijuana is reversed and this case is \r\n  remanded for a new trial. \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and HUFF, J., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  RULE 613. \r\n  PRIOR STATEMENTS OF WITNESSES, reads in applicable part: \r\n(b) Extrinsic Evidence of Prior Inconsistent \r\n  Statement of Witness. Extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by \r\n  a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of \r\n  the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom \r\n  it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement. \r\n  If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, \r\n  extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible. However, if a witness admits \r\n  making the prior statement, extrinsic evidence that the prior statement was \r\n  made is inadmissible. This provision does not apply to admissions of a party-opponent \r\n  as defined in Rule 801(d)(2). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3053","title":"Wade v.

Wade, Jr., appeals from the trial court's order granting summary \r\n  judgment to Berkeley County pursuant to the Tort Claims Act.(1) \r\n  We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nOn the morning of June \r\n  1, 1995, Bobby Joe Pierce was driving his personal vehicle to his job as an \r\n  animal control officer with Berkeley County. While on the way, Pierce stopped \r\n  to determine if a dead dog on the side of the road was wearing a collar. The \r\n  night before, Pierce received a phone call from a woman who informed him the \r\n  dog had been run over and was dead. According to Pierce, after resuming his \r\n  trip to work, he was forced to drive into the left hand lane to avoid a John \r\n  Doe driver who suddenly stopped in front of him. Pierce's car collided head \r\n  on with Wade's vehicle.\r\n \r\n\r\nWade filed a negligence \r\n  action against Pierce and the John Doe driver. In the initial complaint, Wade \r\n  made no allegation concerning Pierce's employment with the County. In his deposition, \r\n  Pierce testified he stopped to check on the dead animal because that was his \r\n  job and he considered himself on the job at the time.&nbsp; Subsequently, Pierce's \r\n  personal liability insurance carrier paid Wade $13,000 in exchange for a Covenant \r\n  Not to Execute Judgment. At the time of this payment, Wade had made no claim \r\n  against Berkeley County. \r\n   \r\nThereafter, Wade filed \r\n  an amended complaint against Berkeley County, pursuant to the South Carolina \r\n  Tort Claims Act, and John Doe as a result of the same accident. Pierce was not \r\n  a named party in the amended complaint. Wade alleged Pierce was acting as an \r\n  agent and servant of the County at the time of the accident. The County denied \r\n  this allegation and averred as an affirmative defense the action was barred \r\n  under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(d) (Supp. 1998), which addresses the effect \r\n  of a judgment or settlement. The County filed a motion for summary judgment(2) \r\n  based upon this section. \r\n   \r\nIn granting the motion, the trial \r\n  court held Berkeley County was entitled to summary judgment as a matter of law \r\n  \"since there was a prior settlement of Wade's personal injury claims between \r\n  Wade and an alleged tortfeasor-employee (i.e., Pierce) for the same occurrence.\" \r\n  The court concluded \"[t]his settlement constitutes a complete bar to any further \r\n  action by Wade against the relevant governmental entity--employer (i.e., Berkeley \r\n  County) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-78-70(d).\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial court err in ruling \r\n  there was a full settlement between Wade and Pierce? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Did the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment based on his conclusion the execution of the document constituted \r\n  \"a settlement of a claim\" initiated under the Tort Claims Act? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when \r\n  it is clear there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party \r\n  is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. Mosteller v. County of Lexington, \r\n  Op. No. 24992 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 23, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 28 \r\n  at 13); Young v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 333 S.C. 714, \r\n  511 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 1999); Rule 56(c), SCRCP. In determining whether any \r\n  triable issue of fact exists, as will preclude summary judgment, the evidence \r\n  and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn therefrom must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Strother v. Lexington County \r\n  Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998); Vermeer Carolina's, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., Op. No. 3005 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June \r\n  1, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at 22). If triable issues exist, those issues \r\n  must go to the jury. Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  366 (1991); Young, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is not appropriate \r\n  where further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the \r\n  application of the law. Mosteller, supra. All ambiguities, conclusions, \r\n  and inferences arising from the evidence must be construed most strongly against \r\n  the moving party. Vermeer, supra. Even when there is no dispute \r\n  as to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be \r\n  drawn from them, summary judgment should be denied. Id. Because it \r\n  is a drastic remedy, summary judgment should be cautiously invoked so no person \r\n  will be improperly deprived of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Baughman \r\n  v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. EFFICACY OF SETTLEMENT \r\n  DOCUMENTS UNDER\r\n  SOUTH CAROLINA JURISPRUDENCE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWithout a jury verdict, order of \r\n  judgment, or confession of judgment, cases are disposed of by way of amicable \r\n  disposition under the aegis and ambit of three recognizable legal documents \r\n  effectuating the settlement: (1) general release; (2) covenant not to \r\n  sue; and (3) covenant not to execute. The bench and bar have great concernment \r\n  in regard to the avenues of disposition available to party litigants, especially \r\n  in the proliferating multi-party litigation, such as product liability, professional \r\n  malpractice, and construction litigation. Attorneys representing litigants subsumed \r\n  in multi-party litigation ofttimes seek to extricate a party while the remaining \r\n  parties litigate to an ultimate resolution. A cardinal principle inherent in \r\n  the settlement process is the utilitarian use of the proper document to achieve \r\n  the desired result, i.e., the salvation of the party from further liability \r\n  or exposure. We analyze with exactitude the precedent governing the documents \r\n  to achieve the ultimate goals of the parties. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. General Release \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe term \"release\" has been defined \r\n  as the \"relinquishment, concession, or giving up of a right, claim, or privilege, \r\n  by the person in whom it exists or to whom it accrues, to the person against \r\n  whom it might have been demanded or enforced.\" 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ \r\n  2 (1994). A release is an agreement providing that a duty owed to the maker \r\n  of the release is discharged immediately. Id. See also Black's \r\n  Law Dictionary 1289 (6th ed. 1990)(a release is a writing or \r\n  oral statement manifesting an intention to discharge another from an existing \r\n  or asserted duty). A release is contractual in nature. 76 C.J.S. Release \r\n  Â§ 2. Whether a particular agreement constitutes a release is to be determined \r\n  from the intent of the parties. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the common law, the release \r\n  of one of multiple joint tortfeasors, regardless of the intention of the parties, \r\n  released all. Bartholomew v. McCartha, 255 S.C. 489, 179 S.E.2d 912 \r\n  (1971). In Bartholomew, the Court rejected this common law rule and \r\n  held: \r\n   \r\nBeing untrammeled by the ancient \r\n  rule which, in our view, tends to stifle settlements, defeat the intention of \r\n  parties and extol technicality, we adopt the view that the release of one tort-feasor \r\n  does not release others who wrongfully contributed to plaintiff's injuries unless \r\n  this was the intention of the parties, or unless plaintiff has, in fact, received \r\n  full compensation amounting to a satisfaction. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBartholomew, 255 S.C. at \r\n  492, 179 S.E.2d at 914. See also Scott by McClure v. Fruehauf Corp., \r\n  302 S.C. 364, 396 S.E.2d 354 (1990)(release of one tortfeasor does not constitute \r\n  release of others who contributed to plaintiff's injuries unless parties intended \r\n  such a release or plaintiff received full satisfaction). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Covenant Not to \r\n  Sue \r\n   \r\nThe covenant not to sue was developed \r\n  at common law to permit the release of one or more joint tortfeasors without \r\n  affecting the covenantor's rights against the other joint tortfeasors. A covenant \r\n  not to sue is a covenant by one who had a right of action at the time of making \r\n  it against another person, by which he agrees not to sue to enforce such right \r\n  of action. 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4 (1994). \"Such covenant does not extinguish \r\n  a cause of action and does not release other joint tort-feasors even if it does \r\n  not specifically reserve rights against them.\" Black's Law Dictionary \r\n  364 (6th ed. 1990). However, one tortfeasor is entitled to credit \r\n  for the amount paid by another tortfeasor for a covenant not to sue. See \r\n  Powers v. Temple, 250 S.C. 149, 156 S.E.2d 759 (1967). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA covenant not to sue is not a release. \r\n  76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4. \"The difference is one of intent and grows out \r\n  of the construction placed on the terms of the instrument, since a covenant \r\n  not to sue is not a present abandonment or relinquishment of a right or claim \r\n  but merely an agreement not to enforce an existing cause of action, and, although \r\n  it may operate as a release between the parties to the agreement, it will not \r\n  release a claim against joint obligors or joint tort-feasors.\" Id. \r\n  (Footnotes omitted). In the case of a release, there is an immediate discharge, \r\n  whereas, in the case of a covenant not to sue, there is merely an agreement \r\n  not to prosecute a suit. 66 Am. Jur. 2d Release Â§ 2 (1973). It is nothing \r\n  but a contract and should be so construed. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity \r\n  Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995), this Court discussed \r\n  the genesis of the covenant not to sue: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"At common law, a valid release of \r\n  one joint tort-feasor was usually a release of all the joint wrongdoers and \r\n  was a bar to a suit against any of them for the same wrong. At the base of this \r\n  rule was the theory that there could be but one compensation for the joint wrong. \r\n  If the injured party was paid by one of the wrongdoers for the injury he had \r\n  suffered, each wrongdoer being responsible for the whole damage, his cause of \r\n  action was satisfied in exchange for a release, and he could not proceed against \r\n  the others. Thus a release of one joint wrongdoer released all. But when the \r\n  consideration received for the release was not full compensation for the injury, \r\n  the purpose for the harsh rule did not exist. To allow for this, the covenant \r\n  not to sue was developed.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAckerman, 318 S.C. at 146-47, \r\n  456 S.E.2d at 413. \r\n   \r\nC. Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute \r\n   \r\nA covenant not to execute \"is a promise \r\n  not to enforce a right of action or execute a judgment when one had such a right \r\n  at the time of entering into the agreement.\" 76 C.J.S. Release Â§ 4 \r\n  (1994). It is merely a contract and not a release. Id. A covenant not \r\n  to execute is distinguishable from a covenant not to sue in that the former \r\n  is normally executed when a settlement occurs after the filing of a lawsuit, \r\n  while the latter is entered into before a lawsuit is filed. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSouth Carolina courts have recognized \r\n  the distinctions between a release, a covenant not to sue, and a covenant not \r\n  to execute. In Poston by Poston v. Barnes, 294 S.C. 261, 363 S.E.2d \r\n  888 (1987), the Supreme Court explained: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOther jurisdictions hold that a Covenant \r\n  Not To Execute is not a satisfaction or a release and that its legal effect \r\n  is similar to that of a Covenant Not To Sue because it does not operate to release \r\n  other joint tortfeasors. A Covenant Not To Execute is a promise not to enforce \r\n  a right of action or execute a judgment when one had such a right at the time \r\n  of entering into the agreement. A Covenant Not to Sue and a Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute are so closely akin that a major distinguishing factor is that the latter \r\n  is normally executed when a settlement occurs after the filing of a lawsuit, \r\n  while the former is entered into before a lawsuit is filed. In South Carolina \r\n  when a Covenant Not To Sue has been entered into, usually the covenanting tortfeasor \r\n  is no longer a party to the litigation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPoston, 294 S.C. at 263-64, \r\n  363 S.E.2d at 889-90 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe intention of the parties governs \r\n  in determining whether an instrument is a covenant not to execute or a release. \r\n  Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1995). See also Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 482 S.E.2d \r\n  589 (Ct. App. 1997)(to determine whether instrument is covenant not to execute \r\n  or release, this Court looks to intention of parties).\r\n  \r\n \r\nII. VALIDITY AND IMPACT \r\n  OF DOCUMENT\r\n  UTILIZED IN CASE SUB JUDICE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn exchange for the payment of $13,000, \r\n  Wade and Pierce executed a document entitled \"Covenant Not To Execute Judgment.\" \r\n  The document acknowledged Wade's damages exceeded the amount of liability insurance \r\n  coverage available to Pierce from his personal insurance carrier. The covenant \r\n  contained the following language: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n3. That Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and Shirley \r\n  M. Wade do hereby promise and covenant for themselves, their heirs, personal \r\n  representatives, administrators, legal representatives and assigns, not to execute \r\n  against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance Company, their heirs, \r\n  personal representatives, administrators, legal representatives, successors \r\n  or assigns, on any judgment that may be attained by Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and \r\n  Shirley M. Wade on account of any and all claims, demands, damages, costs or \r\n  expenses, including, but not limited to, any medical or hospital expenses, loss \r\n  of services, actions and causes of action, arising from any act, omission or \r\n  occurrence or resulting or to result from the automobile accident which occurred \r\n  on June 1, 1995, in Berkeley County, South Carolina, when Gerald D. Wade, Jr. \r\n  was involved in a motor vehicle collision with a vehicle driven by Bobby Joe \r\n  Pierce.\r\n \r\n4. That, furthermore, Gerald D. Wade, \r\n  Jr. and Shirley M. Wade do further covenant and promise that if they should \r\n  attain a judgment against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance \r\n  Company, they will not execute on said judgment against Bobby Joe Pierce or \r\n  Government Employees Insurance Company and that, upon a final determination \r\n  of whether any underinsured motorist benefits will be paid, they and their attorney, \r\n  George J. Kefalos, will cause the judgment to be marked and entered as satisfied.\r\n. . . . \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  10. That Gerald D. Wade, Jr. and \r\n  Shirley M. Wade, Bobby Joe Pierce and Government Employees Insurance Company \r\n  furthermore agree and understand that this instrument is not intended as a release \r\n  or discharge, nor as an accord and satisfaction with any person whomsoever, \r\n  but only as a Covenant Not to Execute against Bobby Joe Pierce and Government \r\n  Employees Insurance Company, their heirs, personal representatives, administrators, \r\n  legal representatives, successors and assigns, and is executed simply to purchase \r\n  freedom from the threat of execution upon any judgment that may be attained \r\n  against Bobby Joe Pierce or Government Employees Insurance Company including \r\n  any judgment in the lawsuit filed in the Court of Common Pleas for Berkeley \r\n  County, South Carolina, and assigned Case No. 95-CP-08-1281. (Emphasis added).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased upon its language, we conclude \r\n  the document executed by Wade and Pierce was intended to be a covenant not to \r\n  execute as opposed to a settlement agreement, release, or covenant not to sue. \r\n  The document evidences no intent to release others from liability and, in fact, \r\n  contemplates further litigation against other tortfeasors. The instrument recognizes \r\n  Wade was not fully compensated for his injuries. It contemplates Wade's pursuit \r\n  of underinsured motorist coverage. Further, the agreement explicitly states \r\n  it does not operate as a release or discharge. As such, the document is very \r\n  similar to the documents found by the Court to be covenants not to execute in \r\n  the cases of Ackerman v. Travelers Indemnity Co., 318 S.C. 137, 456 \r\n  S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1995), and Cobb v. Benjamin, 325 S.C. 573, 482 \r\n  S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWade is still entitled to seek a \r\n  judgment against Pierce and Government Employees Insurance Company (GEICO). \r\n  He merely agreed not to legally enforce the judgment. In fact, the \r\n  covenant not to execute expressly reserves Wade's right to obtain a judgment \r\n  against Pierce. \r\n   \r\nIII. SOUTH CAROLINA \r\n  TORT CLAIMS ACT-- \r\n  \"SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM UNDER \r\n  THIS CHAPTER\"\r\nThe trial judge concluded Wade's \r\n  covenant not to execute constituted a \"settlement\" under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(d) \r\n  (Supp. 1998). We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 15-78-70(d) of the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA settlement or judgment in an action \r\n  or a settlement of a claim under this chapter constitutes a complete bar to \r\n  any further action by the claimant against an employee or governmental entity \r\n  by reason of the same occurrence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Statutory Construction \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen construing a statute, the primary \r\n  function of the court is to ascertain the intention of the legislature. See \r\n  Lester v. South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n, 334 S.C. 557, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 751 (1999). A statutory provision should be given a reasonable and \r\n  practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed in the \r\n  statute. Davis v. NationsCredit Financial Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, \r\n  484 S.E.2d 471 (1997). If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and \r\n  conveys a clear and definite meaning, there is no occasion for employing rules \r\n  of statutory interpretation and the Court has no right to look for or impose \r\n  another meaning. Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  16 (1998); City of Columbia v. A.C.L.U. of South Carolina, Inc., 323 \r\n  S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 (1996). Where the terms of a statute are clear, the \r\n  court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning. Paschal \r\n  v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995). The words \r\n  of the statute must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting \r\n  to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its scope. Durham v. \r\n  United Companies Financial Corp., 331 S.C. 600, 503 S.E.2d 465 (1998). \r\n  Where a statute is ambiguous, however, the Court must construe the terms of \r\n  the statute. Lester, supra. Any ambiguity in a statute should \r\n  be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of the law. \r\n  City of Sumter Police Dep't v. One (1) 1992 Blue Mazda Truck, 330 S.C. \r\n  371, 498 S.E.2d 894 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIf the language of an act gives rise \r\n  to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent, the construing court may search \r\n  for that intent beyond the borders of the act itself. The Lite House, Inc. \r\n  v. J.C. Roy, Co., 309 S.C. 50, 419 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 1992). Where the \r\n  legislature elects not to define the term in the statute, courts will interpret \r\n  the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning. Adoptive Parents \r\n  v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 446 S.E.2d 404 (1994). In construing \r\n  a statute, the court looks to its language as a whole in light of its manifest \r\n  purpose. Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320 S.C. 213, 464 S.E.2d 109 (1995). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Covenant Not to \r\n  Execute Did Not Constitute a\r\n  \"settlement of a claim under \r\n  this chapter\" \r\n   \r\nThe phrase \"under this chapter\" in \r\n  Â§ 15-78-70(d) refers to the Tort Claims Act and modifies the prior \"settlement\" \r\n  phrases. Thus, a \"settlement or judgment in an action\" under the Tort Claims \r\n  Act or the \"settlement of a claim\" under the Tort Claims Act \"constitutes a \r\n  complete bar to any further action by the claimant against an employee or governmental \r\n  entity by reason of the same occurrence.\" However, in the instant case, there \r\n  is no \"settlement or judgment in an action or a settlement of a claim\" \r\n  under the Tort Claims Act. The modifier mandates that the settlement or judgment \r\n  activity be \"under this chapter.\" The document executed by Wade is not \r\n  \"under this chapter.\" \r\n   \r\nThe trial judge concluded the covenant \r\n  not to execute constituted a \"settlement\" under Â§ 15-78-70(d) \"since an agreement \r\n  ha[d] been reached between Wade and Pierce which settlement . . . fully resolved \r\n  the matters between Wade and Pierce.\" We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the covenant not to execute \r\n  did not relate to an action or claim under the Tort Claims Act. The covenant \r\n  was not a \"settlement or judgment in an action or a settlement of a claim\" \r\n  under Â§ 15-78-70(d). No claim had been made against the County at the time Pierce's \r\n  personal liability insurance carrier paid $13,000 in exchange for the covenant \r\n  not to execute. The initial complaint alleged causes of action against Pierce \r\n  personally. How can an action against Pierce in his individual capacity \r\n  constitute an action under the Tort Claims Act? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe payment to Wade by Pierce and \r\n  GEICO was effectuated so as to eliminate personal liability of Pierce in his \r\n  status as an individual. If Pierce was not acting within the course and scope \r\n  of his employment, he faced personal liability for damages caused to Wade. The \r\n  County maintains Pierce was not acting within the course and scope of his employment \r\n  at the time of the collision in which Wade was injured. Footnote 2 in the dissent \r\n  avers the allegations in regard to the employment status of Pierce in the complaint \r\n  must be accepted as true because this is a summary judgment motion. We disagree \r\n  with this statement. The instant case is in the unusual posture of having been \r\n  before the Court of Appeals on a prior occasion. In the first appeal, this Court \r\n  ruled: \"The facts of this case create a jury question as to whether Pierce was \r\n  acting within the course and scope of his employment when he collided with Wade. \r\n  . . . [B]ecause a genuine issue of material fact exists regarding whether \r\n  Pierce was acting within the scope of his employment when the accident occurred, \r\n  the law does not support the trial court's grant of summary judgment to County.\" \r\n  Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, 320-21, 498 S.E.2d 684, 689 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPierce desired protection from his \r\n  vulnerable status if it was decided at a later time that he was not within \r\n  the course and scope of his employment. The document at issue only gave \r\n  Pierce protection as an individual. It never contemplated any impact on the \r\n  issue of his employment status. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNeither a \"governmental entity,\" \r\n  as defined in Â§ 15-79-30(d), nor its insurer paid any funds for the covenant. \r\n  Therefore, this case does not present a question of double recovery against \r\n  a governmental entity. Further, the covenant not to execute recognized Wade \r\n  had not been fully compensated for his injuries. The covenant explicitly stated \r\n  it did not operate as a release or discharge. Simplistically put, there was \r\n  no \"settlement of a claim under this chapter.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe dissent asserts: \"The majority's \r\n  holding allows a plaintiff to sue an employee of a governmental entity first \r\n  in his or her individual capacity, force the employee into settling the claim \r\n  based on the employee's potential individual liability, and then subsequently \r\n  amend the complaint to add the governmental entity as a defendant.\" Factually, \r\n  this statement is not correct. Here, Wade only added the County after \r\n  Pierce testified in his deposition that he was working on the job. In short, \r\n  under the facts here, to refuse to let Wade end his lawsuit with GEICO would \r\n  force him to go to trial against both parties-even though GEICO wanted \r\n  out. As a matter of judicial policy, it would wreak havoc to adopt \r\n  the position of the dissent. We refuse to countenance the use of a judicial \r\n  straitjacket in this trial scenario. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, this is not \r\n  an election of remedies issue. Rather, it is an analysis by the Court as to \r\n  whether the covenant not to execute bars Wade's claim against the County. Wade \r\n  did not elect a remedy. In this factual scenario, Wade contractually agreed \r\n  with Pierce (private individual) and Government Employees Insurance Company \r\n  (Pierce's private insurance company) inter sese not to execute on any \r\n  judgment that may be obtained against Pierce as an individual. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, in contrariety to the dissent's \r\n  assertion, we do not hold or suggest Pierce and \r\n  the County are joint tortfeasors. Nothing in this opinion is bottomed and premised \r\n  upon the notion that Pierce and the County are joint tortfeasors. There is no \r\n  assumption that Pierce and Berkeley County are joint tortfeasors. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold Â§ 15-78-70(d) does not bar \r\n  Wade's action against the County under the Tort Claims Act. First, the covenant \r\n  not to execute does not constitute a \"settlement of a claim under \r\n  this chapter.\" (Emphasis added). Second, Wade's claim against Pierce was \r\n  not under the Tort Claims Act. It was an action against Pierce as an individual \r\n  facing personal liability in an alleged non-governmental employment status. \r\n  Accordingly, the Circuit Court's order granting summary judgment to the County \r\n  is \r\n   \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n    \r\nCONNOR, J., concurs. GOOLSBY, \r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n1. \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10, \r\net seq. (Supp. 1998). \r\n2. This case was \r\n  previously before the Court in Wade v. Berkeley County, 330 S.C. 311, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 684 (Ct. App. 1998). In that opinion, this Court concluded Wade was \r\n  not collaterally estopped by a prior Workers' Compensation finding from litigating \r\n  the issue of whether the County employee, Bobby Joe Pierce, was acting within \r\n  the course and scope of his employment when his vehicle collided with Wade's \r\n  vehicle. We ruled a material issue of fact existed concerning Pierce's scope \r\n  of employment and reversed the trial court's grant of summary judgment in favor \r\n  of the County. The case is now before us pursuant to a second motion for summary \r\n  judgment on a different ground. \r\n3. We \r\n  initially note there is a question of fact as to whether Pierce was acting within \r\n  the course and scope of his employment with Berkeley County at the time of the \r\n  accident. Wade asserts this factual dispute prevents the grant of summary judgment. \r\n  If Pierce was not acting in the course and scope of his employment, then the \r\n  County would have no vicarious liability under the Tort Claims Act. However, \r\n  assuming Pierce was acting in the course and scope of his employment at the \r\n  time of the accident, the court would still be required to determine the legal \r\n  issue of whether Wade's action against the County was barred based upon Â§ 15-78-70(d). \r\n  Thus, this factual dispute is not material so as to prevent disposition by summary \r\n  judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3054","title":"Cowart v.

Poore, of Rock Hill, \r\n          pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON, J.:  \r\n  Johnny F. Cowart filed a legal malpractice \r\n  action against Bruce M. Poore, Cowart's former attorney, alleging: (1) breach \r\n  of contract; (2) negligence; and (3) violation of the Unfair Trade Practices \r\n  Act. The Circuit Court judge granted Poore's motion to dismiss. Cowart appeals. \r\n  We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPoore represented Cowart in a mortgage \r\n  foreclosure action. An hourly fee arrangement was agreed upon. \r\n  Cowart also requested Poore represent him in a counterclaim against the mortgagee. \r\n  Poore filed the action but notified Cowart he would not litigate it. By consent \r\n  order substituting counsel, prior to the foreclosure hearing, Poore was relieved \r\n  as counsel.  \r\n   \r\nCowart sought a refund through the \r\n  Fee Dispute Resolution Board. The Board denied Cowart relief, and dismissed \r\n  the complaint. The Board elucidates: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n3. We find, as a matter of fact, \r\n  from the testimony and the exhibits in the record that . . . Mr. Poore fully \r\n  earned [his] fees and, in fact, had additional fees due [him] over and above \r\n  what was actually charged, which they wrote off in order to terminate [his] \r\n  relationship with Mr. Cowart. . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n6. We further find that Mr. Cowart \r\n  has unreasonable expectations to assume that he should be refunded the entire \r\n  fee paid where work was performed. For emphasis, we find that the work performed \r\n  was beneficial to Mr. Cowart . . . in the case of Mr. Poore. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCowart then filed this action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPoore filed a motion to dismiss under \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, as to all causes of action, or in the alternative, a motion \r\n  for summary judgment. Under his first cause of action in his complaint, Cowart \r\n  alleged: \r\n   \r\n14. The defendant breached the contract \r\n  between himself and the plaintiff by totally ignoring the specific instructions \r\n  of the plaintiff about being notified of the first meeting with Home Federal.\r\n15. The plaintiff also alleges that \r\n  the defendant was negligent in his duties by attending the first meeting \r\n  with Home Federal and preparing the answer and counterclaim without benefit \r\n  of the file from [Cowart's former attorney's] office which contained the papers \r\n  and documents dealing with this case.\r\n16. The plaintiff also alleges that \r\n  the defendant breached the contract between them when he refused to litigate \r\n  this case in court as he had been hired to do.\r\n17. As a result of the defendant's \r\n  actions the plaintiff lost valuable time in order to prepare for trial and also \r\n  the $1350.00 that the plaintiff had already paid the defendant plus interest, \r\n  plus consequential damages. (Emphasis added.) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the hearing on the motion, the \r\n  trial judge required Cowart to elect between his contract action and his negligence \r\n  action. Cowart elected to proceed on the negligence action, and waived the contract \r\n  action. The trial judge (1) found Cowart waived the contract action, or in the \r\n  alternative the contract action was barred by the Fee Dispute Resolution Board \r\n  decision; (2) granted the motion to dismiss on the negligence action as there \r\n  was \"no allegation by [Cowart] of any causal connection between the alleged \r\n  negligence of [Poore] and any alleged damages;\"and (3) granted the motion to \r\n  dismiss the unfair trade practices for failure to state facts sufficient to \r\n  set forth a cause of action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a motion to reconsider, Cowart \r\n  raised procedural issues involving: (1) the Fee Dispute Resolution Board action; \r\n  (2) Poore's violation of Rule 6, SCRCP, regarding Poore's memorandum in support \r\n  of the motion to dismiss which was not served prior to the hearing; and (3) \r\n  alleging the memorandum contained fraudulent statements. The trial judge held \r\n  two hearings on the motion to reconsider. At the second hearing, Cowart asserted \r\n  Poore had a conflict of interest in his action against Home Federal due to Poore's \r\n  mortgage with Home Federal. Cowart also reargued his breach of contract claim, \r\n  and denied waiving it in favor of the negligence claim. The trial judge denied \r\n  the motion to reconsider.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial judge err in finding \r\n  Cowart waived his contract cause of action? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Is the holding of the Fee Dispute \r\n  Board binding on the breach of contract claim if it is not waived? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Did the trial judge err in dismissing \r\n  the legal malpractice and Unfair Trade Practices actions pursuant to Rule 12 \r\n  (b)(6), SCRCP? \r\n   \r\nIV. Did the trial judge err in allowing \r\n  Poore to submit his Memorandum in Support of Defendant's Motion to Dismiss at \r\n  the hearing in violation of Rule 6(D), SCRCP? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nThe ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP \r\n  motion to dismiss must be based solely upon the allegations set forth in the \r\n  complaint. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs v. Fenwick Hall, Inc., 300 S.C. \r\n  274, 387 S.E.2d 458 (1990). On review, the motion will not be sustained if the \r\n  facts alleged, and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom, would entitle \r\n  the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case. Stiles v. Onorato, \r\n  318 S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995); Brown v. Leverette, 291 S.C. 364, \r\n  353 S.E.2d 697 (1987). The question to be considered is whether in the light \r\n  most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, \r\n  the complaint states any valid claim for relief. Toussaint v. Ham, 292 \r\n  S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nElection of \r\n  Remedies \r\n   \r\nThe doctrine of election of remedies \r\n  involves a choice between two or more different and coexisting modes of procedure \r\n  and relief afforded by law for the same injury. Tzouvelekas v. Tzouvelekas, \r\n  206 S.C. 90, 33 S.E.2d 73 (1945). Its purpose is to prevent double redress for \r\n  a single wrong. Use of the doctrine is limited to cases where a double recovery \r\n  by the plaintiff is threatened. Save Charleston Foundation v. Murray, \r\n  286 S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct.App.1985). When one set of facts entitles the \r\n  plaintiff to alternative remedies, he may plead and prove his entitlement to \r\n  either or both; however, the plaintiff may not recover both. Id. The \r\n  plaintiff should have a full opportunity to prove his claim to some form of \r\n  relief, but he should not receive a double recovery. Id. The invocation \r\n  of one remedy constitutes an election of remedies that will bar another remedy \r\n  consistent therewith where the suit upon the remedy first invoked reached the \r\n  stage of final adjudication. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBrown v. Felkel, 320 S.C. \r\n  292, 294, 465 S.E.2d 93, 95 (Ct. App. 1995) cert. dismissed, 326 S.C. \r\n  36, 482 S.E.2d 564 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs we have stated, there can be no \r\n  double recovery for a single wrong. This is the basic purpose of the election \r\n  of remedies doctrine. Id. A defendant may raise the issue of election of remedies \r\n  at any stage of the case. Indeed, to carry out the doctrine's purpose, the trial \r\n  judge should on his own motion require election if he lets both causes of action \r\n  go to the jury. Nichols, 279 S.C. at 341, 306 S.E.2d at 619 (holding trial judge \r\n  acted properly in striking verdict on one cause of action to prevent double \r\n  recovery). To hold otherwise would result in an impermissible double recovery. \r\n  Adamson, --- S.C. at ----, 391 S.E.2d at 251. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInman v. Imperial Chrysler-Plymouth, \r\n  Inc., 303 S.C. 10, 15, 397 S.E.2d 774, 777 (Ct. App. 1990). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Cowart originally brought his case \r\n  before the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board (Board) pursuant to Rule 416, SCACR. \r\n  In the action he claimed a refund of the fee paid to Poore. The Board found \r\n  Poore had performed his duties and fully earned the fee in dispute. The complaint \r\n  was dismissed.  \r\n   \r\nSubsequently, this action was brought \r\n  by Cowart alleging: (1) breach of contract; (2) negligence or professional malpractice; \r\n  and (3) violations of the Unfair Trade Practices Act. Cowart's three causes \r\n  of action would all be allowed had he brought this action first to trial. However, \r\n  all the causes of action arise out of the same facts, the fee dispute. Cowart \r\n  would have been required to elect his remedy at the end of trial.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCowart chose to first pursue this \r\n  action before the Board, and did not proceed to trial until he received an unsatisfactory \r\n  judgment. Where the party submits its fee dispute to the Board and receives \r\n  a final judgment, the same claim may not be brought, even if on different theories, \r\n  again at trial. See Save Charleston Foundation v. Murray, 286 \r\n  S.C. 170, 333 S.E.2d 60 (Ct.App.1985). We affirm the dismissal of the case on \r\n  the grounds that Cowart has already elected review of this dispute by the Board, \r\n  and to allow the instant action would permit a double recovery on the same set \r\n  of facts.(2)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold Cowart, having \r\n  obtained a final judgment from the Board, has already elected his remedy in \r\n  this action. He may not bring suit, even if based upon different theories, where \r\n  the causes of action all arise out of the incident. It is a fundamental rule \r\n  of law in this state that there can be no double recovery for a single wrong. \r\n  See Inman, supra; Harper v. Ethridge, 290 S.C. 112, \r\n  348 S.E.2d 374 (Ct. App. 1986); Save Charleston Foundation, supra. \r\n  We rule a party may not bring a case before the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board, \r\n  receive an final judgment, and then relitigate the claim, even under different \r\n  theories. \r\nAFFIRMED \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J., concurs. \r\n  CONNOR, J., concurs in result in separate opinion.\r\n1. \r\nBecause oral argument would \r\nnot aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without \r\noral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  \r\n  We may affirm upon any ground appearing in the Record on Appeal pursuant to \r\n  Rule 220(c), SCACR.

Robert Deloach, III, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY, J.: A jury \r\n  convicted Sherry Pace of forgery and insurance fraud, and the trial court sentenced \r\n  her to three years imprisonment, suspended on service of thirty days, plus three \r\n  years probation and a $5,000 fine. Pace appeals, arguing double jeopardy bars \r\n  her conviction for both offenses, and that the trial court erred in admitting \r\n  certain evidence and refusing to declare a mistrial. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n   \r\nSherry Pace (Pace) and her husband \r\n  Mike are co-owners and the sole employees of Fast Pace Rent-a-Car in Greenville. \r\n  Sherry Pace is also the registered agent for Fast Pace. On August 24, 1995, \r\n  Fast Pace rented a late-model Ford Escort to Christopher King. When King did \r\n  not return the car as scheduled, Pace waited seventy-two hours, as was her normal \r\n  business practice, before calling the Greenville Police Department and reporting \r\n  the car stolen on September 1.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn September 8, 1995, the New York \r\n  City Department of Transportation impounded the abandoned Escort. Following \r\n  standard procedure, Carol Davis, supervisor of the Department's Bronx auction \r\n  unit, determined the registered owner of the vehicle was Downtown Rent-a-Car.(1) \r\n  On September 14, Davis mailed Downtown a certified letter, return receipt requested, \r\n  stating the car would be sold at public auction within 10 days if not redeemed \r\n  by the owner. Per the Department's normal business practice, Davis also sent \r\n  a duplicate letter to Downtown via first class mail. On September 18, someone \r\n  from Fast Pace phoned Davis' direct office line.(2) \r\n  The next day, Pace signed the return receipt for the certified letter. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn October 2, Pace faxed an \"Affidavit \r\n  of Total Theft of a Motor Vehicle\" to Unisun Insurance Company.(3) \r\n  At the bottom of the affidavit, under the heading \"subscribed and sworn to me,\" \r\n  Pace signed Barrie R. Collins' name. Pace had neither Collins' express permission \r\n  to sign the affidavit nor blanket authority to sign Collins' name, though apparently \r\n  she did so on numerous other occasions for convenience purposes.(4) \r\n  As a result of this claim, Unisun paid Fast Pace Rent-a-Car $13,500 for the \r\n  loss of the Escort. \r\n   \r\nOn November 3, 1995, Davis teletyped \r\n  a message to the Greenville Police Department requesting information on the \r\n  Escort. Fran Gentry, the database coordinator, replied that the car was reported \r\n  stolen and that the owner was Downtown Rent-a-Car. She then telephoned the Fast \r\n  Pace office and informed an unidentified male that the car had been located \r\n  in New York. Gentry also contacted Detective Craig Gardner, who had been assigned \r\n  the case after Pace reported the car missing in September. Gardner, in turn, \r\n  called Fast Pace and also spoke with an unidentified male, who confirmed that \r\n  the police dispatch had just called and relayed information concerning the car's \r\n  recovery. He stated that Fast Pace was making arrangments to pick the car up \r\n  in New York.(5)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy January 1996, over two months \r\n  later, no one from Fast Pace had contacted Davis to claim the Escort, so she \r\n  sent another certified redemption letter (and copy via first class mail) to \r\n  the same address. Ricky Jenkins signed for it on January 16, and placed it, \r\n  as he always did, on a desk shared by Mike and Sherry Pace. Jenkins later noticed \r\n  that the stack of mail on the desk was gone. On January 25, Unisun, after receiving \r\n  a call from Davis, began an investigation of Pace's claim. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn March 11, Tom Pfeiffer, Unisun's \r\n  claims investigator, went to see Pace and asked why she had filed a claim on \r\n  the Escort when the evidence in his possession indicated Fast Pace was informed \r\n  in September of 1995 that the car was recovered in New York. He also told her \r\n  he would have to turn this information over to the Insurance Fraud Division \r\n  of the Attorney General's Office. Pace, however, became irate, and Pfeiffer \r\n  left. A short time later Pace called Pfeiffer on his cell phone and asked him \r\n  to come back. When he returned, Pace asked Pfeiffer \"what [did she] have to \r\n  do to make this right?\" Pfeiffer replied that paying back the money Unisun paid \r\n  on the claim would be a beginning. Pace agreed and asked several times if there \r\n  was anything she could do to keep him from referring the matter to the Fraud \r\n  Division, but Pfeiffer responded that he was required by law to report the incident. \r\n  A few days later Fast Pace hired Jenkins to retrieve the Escort.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn July 16, 1996, a Greenville County \r\n  Grand Jury indicted Sherry Pace for making a false statement or misrepresentation \r\n  in filing the affidavit of theft. On November 12, 1996, the grand jury also \r\n  indicted Pace for forging Collins' signature on the same form. At trial, Pace \r\n  moved to \"quash or otherwise dismiss\" the indictment for forgery on double jeopardy \r\n  grounds. The trial court denied the motion. On December 12, the jury convicted \r\n  Pace on both counts of the indictment. For the insurance fraud conviction, the \r\n  trial court sentenced Pace to three years imprisonment, suspended on service \r\n  of thirty days, followed by three years probation to terminate on payment of \r\n  a $5,000 fine. The court handed down an identical concurrent sentence on the \r\n  forgery count, with the exception that no separate fine was imposed. Pace now \r\n  appeals, arguing the trial court erred in (1) admitting evidence of the second \r\n  set of notice letters mailed to Pace from the New York Department of Transportation, \r\n  (2) denying her motion to quash or otherwise dismiss the forgery indictment, \r\n  and (3) refusing to grant a mistrial based on the jury's request for Davis' \r\n  telephone log.  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPace first claims the trial court \r\n  improperly admitted evidence of the second letter from Davis notifying her that \r\n  the Escort was impounded in New York. According to Pace, this evidence was irrelevant \r\n  and prejudicial. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe admission of evidence, including \r\n  its relevancy and materiality, rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, \r\n  and absent an abuse of discretion, will not be disturbed on appeal. American \r\n  Fed. Bank, FSB v. Number One Main Joint Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  439 (1996). Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less \r\n  probable some matter upon which it directly or indirectly bears. State v. \r\n  Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 342 S.E.2d 401 (1986). Evidence that assists in getting \r\n  to the truth of an issue is deemed to be relevant and is admissible, unless \r\n  excluded by some legal rule. Toole v. Salter, 249 S.C. 354, 154 S.E.2d \r\n  434 (1967). \r\n   \r\nPace initially asserts evidence of \r\n  the second letter was not relevant, thus not admissible, because Ricky Jenkins, \r\n  not Pace, signed the certification receipt. The letters, however, were admissible \r\n  to show Pace's knowledge of the car's whereabouts, and Jenkins testified he \r\n  placed the certified letter on a desk shared by Sherry and Mike Pace. Any question \r\n  regarding Pace's actual receipt of the letters goes to credibility and implicates \r\n  the weight of the evidence, not its admissibility. Cf. State v. Sullivan, \r\n  277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981) (argument concerning alternative explanation \r\n  of evidence found at crime scene went to the weight of the evidence, not its \r\n  admissibility); State v. Joseph, 328 S.C. 352, 491 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (discrepancies in testimony reflected on credibility of the evidence and \r\n  not its admissibility). \r\n   \r\nPace further argues the second letter \r\n  sent by Davis in January was not relevant because it was sent and received several \r\n  months after she signed Collins' name and filed the affidavit with Unisun. The \r\n  trial court overruled Pace's objection on this ground, finding that \"it bears \r\n  upon the issue of any fraudulent intent.\" We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEvidence of fraudulent intent was \r\n  clearly relevant to Pace's guilt of the crimes charged. Fraudulent intent is \r\n  \"a condition of the mind beyond the reach of the senses,\" which is \"usually \r\n  kept secret, and can only be proved by unguarded expressions, conduct and circumstances \r\n  generally.\" State v. Jordan, 255 S.C. 86, 90, 177 S.E.2d 464, 465 (1970). \r\n  As a general rule, any act or conduct on the part of the accused is admissible \r\n  as some evidence of consciousness of guilt. State v. McDowell, 266 S.C. \r\n  508, 224 S.E.2d 889 (1976). \"Fraud may be deduced not only from deceptive or \r\n  false representations, but from facts, incidents, and circumstances which may \r\n  be trivial in themselves, but decisive in a given case of fraudulent design.\" \r\n  Cook v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 186 S.C. 77, 84, 194 S.E. 636, 639 \r\n  (1938). \r\n   \r\nDavis' letter, along with the question \r\n  of whether Pace received it, was properly before the jury as it pertained to \r\n  her knowledge of the whereabouts of the car and any intent she had to conceal \r\n  that knowledge. The jury could have inferred that Pace purposely ignored the \r\n  second letter, or failed to act upon receipt of the second letter, in an attempt \r\n  to continue or conceal her fraud upon the insurance company.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe might add that we do not agree \r\n  with Pace's assertion that the admission of the second letter in evidence was \r\n  more prejudicial than probative. A trial court must exclude relevant evidence \r\n  \"if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of \r\n  unfair prejudice.\" State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 193, 493 S.E.2d 349, \r\n  352 (1997) (emphasis added). Evidence is unfairly prejudicial \"if it has an \r\n  undue tendency to suggest decision on an improper basis . . . .\" State v. \r\n  Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991). A trial judge's \r\n  decision \"regarding the comparative probative value and prejudicial effect of \r\n  evidence should be reversed only in 'exceptional circumstances.'\" United \r\n  States v. Green, 887 F.2d 25, 27 (1st Cir. 1989). Here, nothing about the \r\n  questioned evidence invited a decision on an improper basis. Indeed, the probative \r\n  value of the evidence outweighed its prejudicial effect because the evidence \r\n  tended to show Pace's guilty knowledge and intent. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPace next contends the trial court \r\n  erred in refusing to quash the forgery indictment, claiming double jeopardy \r\n  bars convictions for both forgery and insurance fraud based on the same conduct. \r\n  This argument has no merit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n In Grady v. Corbin, 495 U.S. \r\n  508 (1990), the Supreme Court expanded its traditional double jeopardy analysis \r\n  to include a \"same conduct\" test. This decision, however, was overruled in United \r\n  States v. Dixon, 509 U.S. 688 (1993). Our supreme court subsequently clarified \r\n  Dixon's relevance to this state's jurisprudence by holding that Blockburger \r\n  v. United States, 284 U.S. 299 (1932), is \"the only remaining test for determining \r\n  a double jeopardy violation, in both multiple punishment and successive prosecution \r\n  cases.\" State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 132, 489 S.E.2d 617, 623 (1997) \r\n  (declining to extend broader protection under our state constitution than that \r\n  afforded under the federal constitution). The only relevant inquiry in the case \r\n  before us, therefore, is whether the offenses of which Pace was convicted survive \r\n  the Blockburger \"same elements\" test. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Blockburger test is utilized \r\n  when the same act by a defendant violates two distinct statutory provisions \r\n  to determine whether the defendant's actions constitute two offenses or only \r\n  one. The test as applied \"is whether each [offense charged] requires proof of \r\n  a fact which the other does not.\" Blockburger, 284 U.S. at 304. Accordingly, \r\n  a defendant may be convicted of two separate crimes arising from the same conduct \r\n  without being subjected to double jeopardy, where her conduct \"consists of two \r\n  'distinct' offenses.\" State v. Moyd, 321 S.C. 256, 258, 468 S.E.2d 7, \r\n  9 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n   \r\nHere, Pace's forgery conviction rested \r\n  upon proof that she: (1) falsely made a writing or instrument (2) with knowledge \r\n  that such was false, forged or counterfeited and (3) with an intent to defraud \r\n  another. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-13-10 (Supp. 1998); State v. Wescott, \r\n  316 S.C. 473, 450 S.E.2d 598 (Ct. App. 1994). The insurance fraud conviction, \r\n  on the other hand, required proof of the following elements: (1) that Pace made \r\n  a false statement (2) which was material (3) with knowledge of its falsity (4) \r\n  intending to obtain an undeserved economic advantage, benefit, or payment (5) \r\n  in connection with an insurance transaction. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 38-55-530(D), \r\n  540 (Supp. 1998). Pace's conviction for forgery required proof that she falsely \r\n  made a writing or instrument, which is not an element of insurance fraud. Conversely, \r\n  to obtain a conviction for insurance fraud, the State had to prove Pace intended \r\n  to obtain an undeserved economic benefit, i.e., Unisun's insurance payment, \r\n  which is not required to prove a forgery. See Brown v. Bailey, \r\n  215 S.C. 175, 54 S.E.2d 769 (1949) (stating that, in proving forgery, it is \r\n  not necessary to show a defendant profited or intended to profit by the forgery). \r\n  Because each offense contains at least one element which must be proven by an \r\n  additional fact that the other does not require, the trial court correctly held \r\n  that Pace's conviction on both counts does not violate double jeopardy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Pace argues the trial court \r\n  erred in denying her motion for a mistrial based on the jury's request for Carol \r\n  Davis' telephone log. This issue is not preserved for our review.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe record reflects Davis testified \r\n  in camera that she maintained a telephone log of her calls to Fast Pace \r\n  that documented her attempts to locate the owner of the Escort.(6) \r\n  The trial court refused to admit the log into evidence, however, because no \r\n  testimony or specific evidence was presented to connect the messages Davis left \r\n  to Pace. During deliberations, the jury sent out a note requesting the \"[t]estamony \r\n  [sic] pertaining to Carrol [sic] Davis phone log.\" With the consent of both \r\n  parties, the trial court replied as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is no phone log in evidence. \r\n  Therefore there is no testimony as to a phone log. If you want to hear specific \r\n  testimony, please advise. \r\n   \r\nAfterward, the court put the question \r\n  from the jury on the record. Pace's counsel then moved for a mistrial based \r\n  on his belief that \"the jury [had] received information outside of what [was] \r\n  on the record.\" The court denied the motion but offered to give the jury a curative \r\n  instruction when they returned from lunch. With the consent of counsel, the \r\n  trial court instructed the jury as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI told you at the outset, and repeated \r\n  it throughout, what evidence is. In this case there is no phone log in evidence, \r\n  period. It is not in evidence. There is no phone log. There's no phone log in \r\n  evidence for you to consider. You are to consider this case only on the evidence \r\n  received. It would be improper for you to consider any matter beyond the evidence \r\n  received. \r\nI see this word phone log and it \r\n  concerns me because there is no evidence of any phone log whatsoever in this \r\n  case. That should in no way, form, shape or fashion impact or enter into any \r\n  deliberations towards reaching a verdict.\r\n \r\nAfter the jury exited the courtroom, \r\n  the record reflects the following exchange: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Court: There was a curative instruction \r\n  given. On that basis, I'm going to ask if there are any exceptions or deletions \r\n  at this time. I wanted to give, particularly, Mr. Yarborough a chance to respond. \r\n  But are there any exceptions or additions regarding my curative instruction \r\n  from the State? \r\n   \r\nMs. Christophillis: Nothing from \r\n  the State. \r\n   \r\nMr. Yarborough: No, sir, your honor. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe decision to grant or deny a mistrial \r\n  lies within the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Dawkins, \r\n  297 S.C. 386, 377 S.E.2d 298 (1989); State v. Jones, 325 S.C. 310, 323, \r\n  479 S.E.2d 517, 524 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"A mistrial should not be ordered in every \r\n  case where incompetent evidence is received and later stricken out.\"). Moreover, \r\n  where the trial court gives the jury a curative instruction, \"[n]o issue is \r\n  preserved for appellate review if the objecting party accepts the judge's ruling \r\n  and does not contemporaneously make an additional objection to the sufficiency \r\n  of the curative charge or move [again] for a mistrial.\" State v. George, \r\n  323 S.C. 496, 510, 476 S.E.2d 903, 912 (1996). Here, Pace did not except to \r\n  the court's curative instruction nor did she request any further relief. She \r\n  may not, therefore, complain of any error on appeal. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n1.  The Paces \r\n  began their business as Downtown Rent-a-Car in June 1994, but changed the name \r\n  to Fast Pace Rent-a-Car a year later. The business address and phone number, \r\n  however, remained unchanged. Under both names, the company shared office space \r\n  with Downtown Motors, owned by Sherry Pace's father. \r\n2. \r\n Davis testified that her direct telephone \r\nnumber was not available through directory assistance and that the only way to \r\nobtain the number would be through receipt of the notification letter sent from \r\nher office. \r\n3.  Pace's former \r\n  carrier, Ohio Casualty Company, had insured Downtown Rent-a-Car's fleet for \r\n  the previous year. Ohio Casualty cancelled the policy in July 1995, however, \r\n  apparently due to numerous vehicle theft claims. Downtown changed its name to \r\n  Fast Pace the same month. Interestingly, the Unisun policy application, under \r\n  the heading \"loss history,\" declared that Fast Pace had not filed any insurance \r\n  claims in the previous five years. The application also reflected Fast Pace's \r\n  assertion that it had not been denied coverage or had a policy cancelled in \r\n  the previous three years. Sherry Pace admitted signing the application but claimed \r\n  her insurance agent filled in the information. Similarly, on Unisun's affidavit \r\n  of vehicle theft, Pace stated that Fast Pace's only prior vehicle theft was \r\n  that of one pick-up truck stolen from the lot. \r\n4.  Pace's father, \r\n  Bob Rogers, employed Collins at Rogers Body Shop, located a few miles from Fast \r\n  Pace. Pace had been warned by her former insurer not to sign Collins' name to \r\n  any documents that needed notarizing. As a result, Collins specifically asked \r\n  Pace not to sign her name as a notary in the future. \r\n5.  Ricky Jenkins, \r\n  employed by Pace's father, testified he answered the telephone when no one else \r\n  was around and that it was his regular practice to take messages for the Paces. \r\n  Jenkins also stated that during business hours, the Paces generally forwarded \r\n  Fast Pace's calls to a cell phone when neither was at the Fast Pace office. \r\n  \r\n6.  Davis kept \r\n  the telephone log in the normal course of business. Over a span of several months, \r\n  the log reflected five telephone calls from Davis to Downtown Rent-a-Car, resulting \r\n  in messages left by Davis but no return calls. The court received this evidence \r\n  by way of a proffer from Davis but ultimately ruled it inadmissible as \"fundamentally \r\n  unfair\" because the State failed to prove the requisite nexus between Pace and \r\n  the phone number reflected in the log. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3056","title":"Washington v.

The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), \r\n  SCRCP, finding that the respondents did not owe a duty to Washington. In the \r\n  alternative, the trial court ruled that the respondents were\r\nimmune from suit under the South \r\n  Carolina Tort Claims Act (Tort Claims Act). Washington appeals. We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn the morning of June 9, 1995, James \r\n  Albert Church, a SCDOC inmate who had been assigned to the Jail, stole a car \r\n  and escaped from a work detail near the Lexington County Courthouse. Church \r\n  drove to Richland County, where he entered Washington's residence, changed clothes, \r\n  and stole Washington's car. Having worked the third shift from 11:00 p.m. to \r\n  7:00 a.m., Washington was at home asleep when Church entered the house. Washington \r\n  alleges he suffered great anxiety, extreme emotional distress, and post traumatic \r\n  stress as a result of this break-in.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWashington filed this action claiming \r\n  the respondents were liable because they were negligent, willful, wanton, careless, \r\n  and grossly negligent in: (1) failing to maintain a proper control of Church; \r\n  (2) failing to prevent Church from having access to a vehicle while knowing \r\n  he was serving a sentence for auto theft; (3) failing to properly supervise \r\n  Church; and (4) failing to use the degree of care and caution that a reasonably \r\n  prudent person would have used under the circumstances. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn lieu of answering, each defendant \r\n  filed a Rule 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss the action. The trial court granted \r\n  the motions, finding that the respondents owed only a duty to the public at \r\n  large, and not to Washington individually. Alternatively, the trial court held \r\n  the respondents were immune from suit under section 15-78-60(20) and (21) of \r\n  the Tort Claims Act.  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe ruling on a Rule 12(b)(6) motion \r\n  to dismiss must be based solely upon the allegations set forth in the complaint. \r\n  Holy Loch Distribs. v. Hitchcock, 332 S.C. 247, 503 S.E.2d 787 (Ct. App. \r\n  1998) (citing State Bd. of Medical Examiners v. Fenwick Hall, Inc., 300 \r\n  S.C. 274, 387 S.E.2d 458 (1990)). The motion will not be sustained if the facts \r\n  alleged and the inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle the \r\n  plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case. Stiles v. Onorato, 318 \r\n  S.C. 297, 457 S.E.2d 601 (1995). The question to be considered is whether in \r\n  the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in \r\n  his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief. Toussaint v. \r\n  Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Tort Claims Act governs all tort \r\n  claims against governmental entities and is the exclusive civil remedy available \r\n  in an action against the government. Murphy \r\nv. Richland Memorial Hosp., \r\n  317 S.C. 560, 455 S.E.2d 688 (1995). Under the Tort Claims Act, a governmental \r\n  entity is liable for its torts \"in the same manner and to the same extent as \r\n  a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations . \r\n  . . contained herein.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo recover for negligence, a plaintiff \r\n  must show: (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff; (2) a \r\n  breach of that duty by a negligent act or omission; and (3) damage proximately \r\n  resulting from the breach. South Carolina Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene &amp; \r\n  Co., 290 S.C. 171, 348 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 1986). The absence of any one \r\n  of these elements renders the cause of action insufficient. South Carolina \r\n  State Ports Authority v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton Inc., 289 S.C. 373, 346 \r\n  S.E.2d 324 (1986). The existence of a duty owed is a question of law for the \r\n  courts. Ballou v. Sigma Nu General Fraternity, 291 S.C. 140, 352 S.E.2d \r\n  488 (Ct. App 1986). \r\n   \r\nThe trial court held Washington could \r\n  not recover in negligence because the respondents owed no duty to him. The trial \r\n  court held that any duty owed to Washington was in fact a public duty owed to \r\n  the public at large and not to Washington individually. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder the public duty rule, public \r\n  officials are generally not held liable to individuals for negligence in discharging \r\n  public duties because the duty is owed to the public at large and not to any \r\n  one individual. Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331 S.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d \r\n  746 (Ct. App. 1998). \"The public duty rule is a negative defense which denies \r\n  an element of the plaintiff's cause of action-the existence of a duty of care \r\n  to the individual plaintiff. The burden is on the plaintiff to show a duty of \r\n  care was owed to him.\" Rayfield v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, \r\n  297 S.C. 95, 106-07, 374 S.E.2d 910, 916 (Ct. App. 1988). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur supreme court has held that police \r\n  officers owe a duty of care to the public at large and not to any one individual. \r\n  In Wyatt v. Fowler, 326 S.C. 97, 484 S.E.2d 590 (1997), Wyatt sued the \r\n  sheriff and his deputies in common-law negligence over events arising out of \r\n  the serving of an arrest warrant. Fowler maintained that he could not be sued \r\n  in negligence because any duty owed to Wyatt was in fact a duty owed to the \r\n  public only. Our supreme court agreed and held that the police owe a duty to \r\n  the public at large and not to any one person individually. Id.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find the situation of guards who \r\n  maintain custody of inmates analogous to that of police officers who owe a duty \r\n  generally to society rather than to any one individual. Accordingly, we hold \r\n  that those who maintain custody of prisoners or inmates do so for the protection \r\n  of the public and are, therefore, not liable to individuals for damages caused \r\n  by an escaped inmate under the public duty rule.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn exception to the public duty rule, \r\n  however, is recognized when a plaintiff can establish that the defendant owed \r\n  him an individual or special duty of care. Bellamy v. Brown, 305 S.C. \r\n  291, 408 S.E.2d 219 (1991). This special duty may be created by statute or some \r\n  other special circumstance. Wells, 331 S.C. at 306, 501 S.E.2d at 752. \r\n  Generally, however, a person has no duty to protect another from harm inflicted \r\n  by a third person. Rayfield 297 S.C. at 101-02, 374 S.E.2d at 913. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWashington cites South Carolina Code \r\n  Â§ 23-17-70(3) as creating a special duty owed \r\n  to him by the respondents. A special duty may be created by statute if:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(1) an essential purpose of the statute \r\n  is to protect against a particular kind of harm;  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(2) the statute, either directly \r\n  or indirectly, imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard against \r\n  or not to cause the harm;  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(3) the class of persons the statute \r\n  intends to protect is identifiable before the fact;  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(4) the plaintiff is a person within \r\n  the protected class; \r\n   \r\n(5) the public officer knows or has \r\n  reason to know of the likelihood of harm to members of the class if he fails \r\n  to do his duty; and  \r\n\r\n(6) the officer is given sufficient \r\n  authority to act in the circumstances or he undertakes to act in the exercise \r\n  of his office.  \r\n   \r\nTanner v. Florence County Treasurer, \r\n  Op. No. 2887 (filed August 9, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 27 at 10, 16-17). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe believe section 23-17-70 creates \r\n  no special duty to Washington. When read in conjunction with section 23-17-60, \r\n  it is clear that recovery under section 23-17-70 is authorized for damages suffered \r\n  when a prisoner escapes the sheriff's custody after the prisoner has been committed \r\n  to custody of the sheriff in a civil action and not in a criminal action. E.g., \r\n  Conyers v. Rhame, 45 S.C.L. 60 (1857); Hall v. Taggart, 23 S.C.L. \r\n  368 (1838). \r\n   \r\nBecause we hold the respondents did \r\n  not owe Washington a duty of care separate and apart from that owed to the public \r\n  at large, we need not reach the issues of immunity under the Tort Claims Act. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2. \r\n Other jurisdictions have similarly \r\nheld that those who maintain custody of prisoners are not liable to individuals \r\nfor damages caused by an escaped inmate under the public duty rule. See \r\nDepartment of Corrections v. McGhee, 653 So. 2d 1091 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. \r\n1995), aff'd, McGhee v. Department of Corrections, 666 So. 2d 140 \r\n(Fla. 1996); Chivas v.

The master-in-equity found \r\n  the Van Blarcums held \"record title\" to a beach area that lies seaward of their \r\n  lots down to the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean, but found the area to \r\n  have been dedicated and thus subject to the public's right to use and enjoy \r\n  a portion of it and to the City's right to maintain that portion. He also found \r\n  the City had accepted a dedication of and held title to two five-foot rights-of-way \r\n  that extend to the Atlantic Ocean along the \"east\" and \"west\" boundaries of \r\n  the two lots on which the motel sits, and he found these rights-of-way subject \r\n  to the rights of the public to use them as walkways and as driveways but not \r\n  for vehicular parking. In an amended order, the master prohibited the parties \r\n  from obstructing the walkways and limited the number of signs the City could \r\n  place to identify the areas as public walkways. The Van Blarcums and the City \r\n  filed cross-appeals. The central issue involved in the Van Blarcums' appeal \r\n  concerns dedication while that involved in the City's appeal concerns the extent \r\n  to which the City may maintain and control the two walkways. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Van Blarcums argue the master \r\n  erred in granting the public the right to use the beach area on their property \r\n  and in granting the City the right to maintain that area because the evidence \r\n  of dedication was insufficient. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSometime before March 1937, Charles \r\n  Ingram bought fifty acres of beachfront property and developed a subdivision \r\n  known as Ingram Beach. In March and April 1937, A. L. Ervin, C.E., surveyed \r\n  the property and prepared a plat of the subdivision. The plat, which was recorded, \r\n  delineated the subdivision's streets, rights-of-way, and lots and showed the \r\n  high-water mark and low-water mark with reference to the lots. Ervin's plat \r\n  divided Ingram Beach into Blocks A, B, C, D, and E, and further subdivided each \r\n  block into numbered lots.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis case involves Lots 8, 9, and \r\n  10 of Block A. Ervin's plat shows each of these lots as adjoining Ocean Drive \r\n  (now Ocean Boulevard) and fronting on the Atlantic Ocean and describes each \r\n  of these lots as 52Â½ feet wide and 125 feet deep. The area in dispute lies between \r\n  the original seaward line of Lots 8, 9, and 10 and the high-water mark as shown \r\n  on Ervin's plat. \r\n   \r\nMary Gray Davis acquired Lots 9 and \r\n  10 on September 21, 1964, and built the Windjammer Motel on the property. On \r\n  July 12, 1965, she deeded the property to Windjammer Motel, Inc. The latter \r\n  deeded the property to the Van Blarcums on September 3, 1992.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1995, the City began a beach renourishment \r\n  project. After surveying the Van Blarcums' property, the City asked the Van \r\n  Blarcums for an easement to allow the City to place sand on a portion of their \r\n  property. The Van Blarcums refused the request. Their refusal prompted the City \r\n  to assert the Van Blarcums did not actually own the property on which it wanted \r\n  to place the sand. This assertion apparently led the Van Blarcums to obtain \r\n  quitclaim deeds from Ingram's devisees to any property from the seaward-side \r\n  lot lines of Lots 9 and 10 to the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean. The \r\n  Ingram devisees gave a similar quitclaim as to Lot 8, property the Van Blarcums \r\n  later acquired.  \r\n   \r\nThe determination of whether property \r\n  has been dedicated to the public is an action in equity. State v. Beach Co., \r\n  271 S.C. 425, 248 S.E.2d 115 (1978); Mack v. Edens, 320 S.C. 236, 464 \r\n  S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 1995). Because this is an action in equity referred to \r\n  a master for final judgment, we may find facts in accordance with our own view \r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence. Thomas v. Mitchell, 287 S.C. 35, \r\n  336 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1985). We, however, are not required to ignore the \r\n  findings of the trial judge, who heard and saw the witnesses. Id. at \r\n  38, 336 S.E.2d at 155. \r\n   \r\nProof of dedication must be strict, \r\n  cogent, and convincing. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d 187 (1997). The party seeking to establish dedication must prove two \r\n  elements: (1) the owner must express in a positive and an unmistakable manner \r\n  the intention to dedicate his property to public use, and (2) there must be, \r\n  within a reasonable time, an express or implied public acceptance of the property \r\n  offered for dedication. Tupper, 326 S.C. at 326, 487 S.E.2d at 191-92; \r\n  Helsel v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 24, 413 S.E.2d 821 (1992). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA recorded plat may be sufficient \r\n  to disclose a landowner's intent to dedicate property to public use. McAllister \r\n  v. Smiley, 301 S.C. 10, 15, 389 S.E.2d 857, 861 (1990) (Toal, J., dissenting). \r\n  If a landowner subdivides and plats an area of land into lots and streets and \r\n  then sells lots with reference to the plat, the owner manifests an intent to \r\n  dedicate those common areas to be used by both the purchasers and the public, \r\n  absent evidence of a contrary intent. Corbin v. Cherokee Realty, 229 \r\n  S.C. 16, 91 S.E.2d 542 (1956); cf. Home Sales, Inc. v. North Myrtle \r\n  Beach, 299 S.C. 70, 382 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1989) (legend on subdivision \r\n  plat, which gave developers discretion whether or not to open avenues, did not \r\n  dedicate avenues). \r\n   \r\nAccording to Ervin's plat, there \r\n  is approximately 90 feet between the seaward lot lines of Lots 8, 9, and 10 \r\n  and the high-water mark of the Atlantic Ocean. Our supreme court has viewed \r\n  an almost identical plat configuration as indicative of an owner's intent to \r\n  dedicate a similarly defined area to the public. See Epps v. Freeman, \r\n  261 S.C. 375, 377, 200 S.E.2d 235, 236 (1973) (\"Although it is not so marked \r\n  or designated on the plat, the intervening beach area was, by the inauguration \r\n  of the plan, the recordation of the plat and the sale of lots, dedicated to \r\n  the lot owners and public for common enjoyment.\"); cf. Hill v. Beach \r\n  Co., 279 S.C. 313, 306 S.E.2d 604 (1983) (where plat designated the high-water \r\n  mark but failed to designate a seaward subdivision boundary, the court found \r\n  the developer intended the property line to extend to the high-water mark). \r\n  We so view the area in question here and hold Ingram, the original developer, \r\n  unequivocally manifested an intent to offer the area to the use of the public \r\n  upon the filing of Ervin's plat. See 23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication \r\n  Â§ 29, at 26 (1983) (a plat exhibited to purchasers is evidence of the existence \r\n  and location of areas dedicated for public use). \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur inquiry does not stop here, however. \r\n  After an owner expresses an intent to dedicate property to the public by a plat, \r\n  the public must accept the dedication to make it complete. 23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication \r\n  Â§ 43, at 39. No formal acceptance by the public of an offer of dedication is \r\n  necessary, and acceptance of the offer may be implied by the public's or public \r\n  authority's continuously utilizing or maintaining the property in some fashion. \r\n  Tupper, 326 S.C. at 326, 487 S.E.2d at 192; see 23 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Dedication Â§ 51, at 44 (acceptance of offer of dedication may be demonstrated \r\n  in various ways, including a showing of public use). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHere, the evidence is sufficient \r\n  to show that an offer by the owner to dedicate the area in question was accepted. \r\n  Aside from any use by the public at large, the City maintained it, raked it, \r\n  cleaned it, planted sea grass to protect its dunes, built dune crossovers and \r\n  stairways upon it, and protected its users with lifeguard, public safety, and \r\n  rescue services.  \r\n   \r\nThe Van Blarcums, however, maintain \r\n  an acceptance of the owner's offer of dedication never occurred because they \r\n  and their predecessors in title paid taxes assessed on the disputed property. \r\n  The payment of taxes on disputed property is evidence contrary to the intent \r\n  to dedicate property to the public. Anderson v. Hemingway, 269 S.C. 351, \r\n  237 S.E.2d 489 (1977). The assessment of taxes is but a factor in determining \r\n  the question of whether an offer of dedication has been accepted and is not \r\n  controlling. Helsel, 307 S.C. at 28, 413 S.E.2d at 821. If other evidence, \r\n  as here, indicates a dedication and acceptance, the mere fact that the municipality \r\n  continued to tax the property will not prevent the municipality from claiming \r\n  it under a completed dedication. 23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication Â§ 79, at 65. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere exists no evidence in the record \r\n  that the Van Blarcums or any of their predecessors in title prior to this dispute \r\n  objected to city improvements on the beach area, otherwise disputed the public's \r\n  interest in the property, or notified the City they had paid taxes upon it. \r\n  See Chafee v. Aiken, 57 S.C. 507, 35 S.E. 800 (1900) (because \r\n  tax receipt did not show, on its face, that the street was included in the property \r\n  upon which taxes were paid and there was no evidence the municipality had notice \r\n  that the landowner paid taxes on the street, the municipality could not be estopped \r\n  from asserting dedication of the street). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City complains of the restrictions \r\n  placed by the master on the City's authority over the walkways that adjoin Lots \r\n  9 and 10. \r\n   \r\nIn his original order, the master \r\n  held that \"the City has record title to the . . . walkways subject only to the \r\n  rights of the public, including the [Van Blarcums], to use the walkways for \r\n  foot traffic to the beach and that access in and to the walkways should not \r\n  be obstructed in any manner whatsoever.\" Thereafter, in an amended order, the \r\n  master stated that, while \"neither party shall place any obstructions within \r\n  the walkways, including any posts, cars parked in the walkway, or the like,\" \r\n  his order \"should not be construed to prohibit or prevent incidental incursion \r\n  of vehicular traffic into the walkways while in transit.\" His amended order \r\n  also limited the number and locations of signs or other markers that could be \r\n  placed on or at the walkways. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe City claims the master's amended \r\n  order limits the discretionary authority that South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 5-7-30 (Supp. 1998)(1) confers upon it \r\n  as a municipality of the State to maintain and control public thoroughfares. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThis issue, however, need not be \r\n  addressed. Before the court of appeals can treat an issue, it must be both raised \r\n  to and ruled on by the trial court. Tupper, 326 S.C. at 328 n.7, 487 \r\n  S.E.2d at 192 n.7. Nowhere did the master explicitly treat the precise issue \r\n  that the City now argues, i.e., that a court, notwithstanding the cited \r\n  statute, may allow vehicular traffic upon publically-owned walkways and restrict \r\n  the number and location of signs that can be placed upon the walkways. Indeed, \r\n  the City in oral argument before this court conceded as much, stating that the \r\n  master implicitly addressed the issue. But an implicit ruling will not suffice. \r\n  See Noisette v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 403 S.E.2d 122 (1991) (absent \r\n  an explicit ruling on a party's argument, the issue raised by the argument is \r\n  not properly before the court of appeals and should not be addressed). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR, J., concurs. ANDERSON, \r\n  J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON, J., (concurs in part and \r\n  dissents in part): I concur as to Issue I. However, I respectfully dissent as \r\n  to the majority's holding with respect to Issue II.  \r\nThe majority states the City claims \r\n  the Master's amended order is violative of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-30 (Supp. 1998). \r\n  Apodictically, the City relied on the statute and the position asserted \r\n  throughout this litigation, i.e., the walkways were dedicated for \r\n  public use. \r\n   \r\nThe elixir of this case is the issue \r\n  relating to the City's and/or public's right to use walkways as an entrance \r\n  and exit to the Atlantic Ocean (Grand Strand) in Horry County. The majority \r\n  sidesteps that issue by ruling the City only relies upon Â§ 5-7-30. I \r\n  disagree. \r\n   \r\nHere, the issue was ruled \r\n  on by the court. The issue was the right of the public to use the walkways. \r\n  On reconsideration, the court ruled on the same issue again. The \r\n  City, in argument to the Circuit judge and in oral argument before this Court, \r\n  insisted it relied on the \"dedication of right of way\" issue and the \r\n  statutory discretion position. The majority concludes the ground for \r\n  the ruling is not preserved. I disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo perfect dedication, two elements \r\n  are required: (1) the owner must express in a positive and unmistakable manner \r\n  the intention to dedicate his property to public use; and (2) there must be \r\n  acceptance of such property by the public. Tupper v. Dorchester County, \r\n  326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). Proof of dedication must be strict, cogent, \r\n  and convincing. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdverting to the merits, there is \r\n  no common law or statutory authority allowing a court to invade a public right \r\n  of way created by dedication. This case is a paradigm of dedicatory endeavor \r\n  flowing from the original owner's activities in filing a plat and creating a \r\n  subdivision with streets and right of ways. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe landowner, Charles Ingram, subdivided \r\n  his tract of land through a platting procedure using A.L. Ervin, a civil engineer. \r\n  Ervin's plat depicts the five foot walkways and identifies them as public walkways. \r\n  Additionally, the Van Blarcums used a plat at the time of their purchase which \r\n  delineates the walkways with exactitude. Ingram's intent can be gleaned with \r\n  absolute accuracy from the subdividing and platting activity. Apodictically, \r\n  Ingram's intent was to preserve forever the walkways on behalf of the public \r\n  in general and the South Carolina citizenry in particular.  \r\n   \r\nApplying Tupper, supra, \r\n  to the case at bar, one comes to the adamantine conclusion that dedication of \r\n  the walkways resulted from Ingram's activities and his clear intent. In regard \r\n  to element two, the evidentiary record demonstrates with uncanny accuracy the \r\n  public acceptance of the property offered for dedication. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI would reverse this part \r\n  of the Master's order and reinstate the unfettered right of the City to mark \r\n  the walkways on each side for public use.\r\n1.

Goldstein, of Belk, \r\n          Cobb, Infinger &amp; Goldstein, of Charleston, for Appellant. \r\n          \r\n           \r\n        Heather Coleman, of Martin \r\n          Law Firm, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\n   \r\nANDERSON, J.: Linda \r\n  Garvin was injured when cans fell from a display of canned goods at a Bi-Lo \r\n  grocery store and struck her in the face. The trial court granted summary judgment \r\n  in favor of Bi-Lo. Garvin appeals, asserting a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  existed as to Bi-Lo's breach of its duty to Garvin. We reverse and remand for \r\n  trial.(1) \r\n   \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nGarvin was shopping at Bi-Lo #284 \r\n  in Monck's Corner when she saw a display of canned items advertised at four \r\n  for $1.00. The items were stacked in the boxes they had been shipped in, with \r\n  the tops of the boxes cut off. There were approximately twenty-four cans in \r\n  each box. According to Garvin, she reached up and took two cans off the top \r\n  and placed them in her shopping cart. She then reached back to get two more \r\n  cans, but before she touched them, approximately fifteen cans came tumbling \r\n  down. Some of the cans hit Garvin in the face, cutting her above her lip. A \r\n  store employee gave her ice to stop the bleeding. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDuring Garvin's deposition, defense \r\n  counsel for Bi-Lo asked Garvin what she thought caused the cans to fall. Garvin \r\n  stated, \"That I don't know. I cannot say.\" She testified she did not notice \r\n  whether the cans were unstable. She just reached for the cans on the top, and \r\n  there were no other items above them. She could not remember exactly how high \r\n  the boxes were stacked, but said they were stacked higher than her head, and \r\n  she is 5'2\". \r\n   \r\nBi-Lo moved for summary judgment \r\n  \"on the basis of lack of constructive or actual notice on the part of Defendant \r\n  Bi-Lo and that it took all reasonable measures in the operation of its store.\" \r\n  (Emphasis added.) The trial judge, in a form order, granted Bi-Lo's motion for \r\n  summary judgment. During the hearing, he stated there was no evidence the store \r\n  was on notice there was a problem with cans falling or had committed a negligent \r\n  act that caused the cans to fall. He explained his ruling as follows: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe can't say that the stacking of \r\n  cans is a dangerous, inherently dangerous situation, it's not.\r\nNow, it may be dangerous to someone \r\n  who is five-two, but that's not before me, because I don't have any evidence \r\n  to say that.\r\nI don't have anything other than \r\n  the fact that the cans fell, to say that the cans were stacked improperly or \r\n  inadequately. There's nothing to suggest that. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe judge added: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe [South Carolina Supreme] Court \r\n  has consistently held that a business is not an insurer of the safety of its \r\n  patrons and the liability to a business invitee is predicated upon negligence.\r\nNegligence is not presumed and the \r\n  happening of an accident does not establish negligence. The burden is upon the \r\n  plaintiff to establish negligence and proximate cause. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n. . . .\r\nCertainly I agree with you a hundred \r\n  percent and the standpoint of [sic], is it foreseeable that if it's first, a \r\n  dangerous condition or they were negligent, could it be foreseeable that somebody \r\n  could be pull [sic] it over on them? Absolutely. No question about it.\r\nIf we are at that point, I don't \r\n  have any hesitancy in denying summary judgment, but I'm not there. All I have \r\n  is a stacking of cans.\r\nI do not have anything to suggestions \r\n  [sic] that it was negligent or there was anything negligent or inherently dangerous \r\n  about it.\r\nIf I would have had cans falling, \r\n  several, before any evidence, any evidence, for cans to fall, then maybe you've \r\n  got something. \r\nAt least from this standpoint, a \r\n  reasonable inference of hey, you've been warned to that, you need to look at \r\n  how you're stacking your merchandise, I have no problem with that.\r\nBut I don't have that. This is apparently, \r\n  from everything before me, a first time basis.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGarvin, in her affidavit, avers: \r\n  \"The reason that the cans fell was because they were stacked up at the end of \r\n  an isle [sic, aisle] and they were stacked higher than I could reach. The cans \r\n  were not on shelves but rather stacked from [the] floor to a point over my head. \r\n  These cans were on special sale, 4 for $1.00[.] As I attempted to take the cans \r\n  off the top, I reached as high as I possibly could, but the cans still fell \r\n  and struck me, causing me the injuries that are set forth in the complaint.\" \r\n  Garvin appeals the grant of summary judgment to Bi-Lo. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDid the trial court err in granting \r\n  summary judgment to Bi-Lo because a genuine issue of material fact existed about \r\n  whether Bi-Lo breached its duty to Garvin? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only \r\n  when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions \r\n  on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine \r\n  issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment \r\n  as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also Tupper v. Dorchester \r\n  County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder Rule 56(c), SCRCP, the party \r\n  seeking summary judgment has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence \r\n  of a genuine issue of material fact. Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. \r\n  Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991). Once the party moving for summary \r\n  judgment meets the initial burden of showing an absence of evidentiary support \r\n  for the opponent's case, the opponent cannot simply rest on mere allegations \r\n  or denials contained in the pleadings. Rather, the non-moving party must come \r\n  forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rule \r\n  56(e), SCRCP; SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v. Cox, 301 S.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d \r\n  789 (1990); NationsBank v. Scott Farm, 320 S.C. 299, 465 S.E.2d 98 \r\n  (Ct. App.1995). \r\n   \r\nIn determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist, the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must \r\n  be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Summer v. \r\n  Carpenter, 328 S.C. 36, 492 S.E.2d 55 (1997); Hamiter v. Retirement \r\n  Div. of South Carolina, 326 S.C. 93, 484 S.E.2d 586 (1997); City of \r\n  Columbia v. American Civil Liberties Union, 323 S.C. 384, 475 S.E.2d 747 \r\n  (1996).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGarvin contends the trial judge erred \r\n  in granting Bi-Lo's motion for summary judgment. She argues: (1) the record \r\n  established a genuine issue of material fact as to Bi-Lo's breach of a duty \r\n  owed to her; (2) the judge improperly weighed the parties' affidavits and determined \r\n  Garvin was not entitled to prevail on the facts instead of determining whether \r\n  the deposition and affidavits created a genuine issue of material fact; and \r\n  (3) the judge refused to apply South Carolina law to determine if an issue of \r\n  fact existed as to whether Bi-Lo breached its duty by carelessly stacking cans \r\n  for reduced sale, knowing that such cans have a propensity to fall. We agree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn granting summary judgment for \r\n  Bi-Lo, the trial judge found: (1) Bi-Lo had no notice of the existing problems \r\n  with falling cans; and (2) Garvin could point to no specific act or omission \r\n  by Bi-Lo that caused the cans to fall on top of her. Therefore, the trial judge \r\n  determined Garvin did not establish a genuine issue of material fact as to whether \r\n  Bi-Lo had committed a breach of duty that would constitute a negligent act. \r\n  The Court held there was no evidence from which a jury could find Bi-Lo had \r\n  failed to keep its premises reasonably safe under these circumstances. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the hearing on the summary judgment \r\n  motion, Garvin maintained a jury question was created as to whether Bi-Lo should \r\n  not stack the cans \"higher than somebody can reach.\" Garvin's counsel professed \r\n  it was only natural that in a tall display of sale items, people were going \r\n  to \"start grabbing them,\" and the purpose of the display was \"to entice people \r\n  to do precisely what Ms. Garvin did, which was reach up and grab them.\" He claimed \r\n  \"it then becomes at least a jury issue as to whether or not a reasonable person \r\n  would have stacked cans in that fashion and advertised them for sale.\" Garvin \r\n  challenged she did not have to prove notice of a condition that the defendant \r\n  admits creating. \r\n   \r\nTo survive the motion for summary \r\n  judgment, Garvin needed to demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact existed \r\n  regarding the elements of negligence. In order to establish liability, the plaintiff \r\n  must show: (1)&nbsp;a duty of care owed to the plaintiff by the defendant; (2) \r\n  a breach of that duty by some act or omission; and (3) that the plaintiff suffered \r\n  damages as a proximate result of the breach. Staples v. Duell, 329 \r\n  S.C. 503, 494 S.E.2d 639 (Ct. App. 1997).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"In a negligence action, the determination \r\n  of whether a party has a duty to exercise reasonable care for the benefit of \r\n  another is a question of law for the court. If the court determines there is \r\n  such a duty, the jury's function is to determine whether a breach of that duty \r\n  has occurred, resulting in damages.\" Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Partnership, \r\n  334 S.C. 96, 114, 512 S.E.2d 510, 519 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Notice by Store \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe plaintiff must show either: (1) \r\n  the defendant or the defendant's employees created the condition or; \r\n  (2) the defendant had notice of it. Cook v. Food Lion, Inc., 328 S.C. \r\n  324, 491 S.E.2d 690 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. denied (1998). In Cook, \r\n  a customer alleged she was injured as a result of a fall caused by a floor mat \r\n  which had admittedly been placed on the floor by store employees. This Court \r\n  reversed the trial judge's grant of a directed verdict in favor of the store. \r\n  We held the customer was not required to show the store had notice of the danger \r\n  created by the mats, because the store employees created the allegedly \r\n  dangerous condition by placing the mats by the exit doors. It was not necessary \r\n  for the customer to show the store had notice that the floor mats were wrinkled \r\n  or bunched immediately prior to the customer's accident. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimilarly, in Smith v. Wal-Mart \r\n  Stores, Inc., 314 S.C. 248, 442 S.E.2d 606 (1994), our Supreme Court held \r\n  the trial judge erred in granting a directed verdict because the plaintiff did \r\n  not say what caused her accidental fall in the store. The Court found there \r\n  was more than one reasonable inference from the evidence, including the inference \r\n  the storekeeper was responsible for creating the hazard which caused the accident, \r\n  therefore it created a jury issue. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBecause Bi-Lo created the alleged \r\n  hazard by stacking the cans, Garvin was not required to show Bi-Lo had notice \r\n  of any problems with the display.  \r\n   \r\nII. Duty to Invitee \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, Garvin was an invitee \r\n  to a business establishment: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe invitee in South Carolina is \r\n  defined in Parker v. Stevenson Oil Co., as one who enters upon the \r\n  premises of another at the express or implied invitation of the occupant, especially \r\n  where he is on a matter of mutual interest or advantage, 245 S.C. 275, 140 S.E.2d \r\n  177 (1965).\r\n \r\nCrocker v. Barr, 305 S.C. \r\n  406, 411-12, 409 S.E.2d 368, 371 (1991). A person owes an invitee the duty of \r\n  exercising reasonable or ordinary care for her safety, and is liable for any \r\n  injury resulting from the breach of this duty. The degree of care required must \r\n  be commensurate with the particular circumstances involved, including the age \r\n  and capacity of the invitee. Henderson v. St. Francis Community Hosp., \r\n  303 S.C. 177, 399 S.E.2d 767 (1990).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"This duty is an active or affirmative \r\n  duty. It includes refraining from any act which may make the invitee's use of \r\n  the premises dangerous or result in injury to him.\" Hughes v. Children's \r\n  Clinic, P. A., 269 S.C. 389, 397, 237 S.E.2d 753, 756 (1977). In Hughes, \r\n  the Court stated it is not necessary that the precise manner in which the injuries \r\n  were sustained be foreseeable; rather: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIt is sufficient that there is a \r\n  reasonable generalized gamut of greater than ordinary dangers of injury and \r\n  that the sustaining of the injury was within this range. . . . . It was, therefore, \r\n  a jury question whether the defendant provided reasonably safe premises . . \r\n  . for the use of the . . . invitee . . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 397-98, 237 S.E.2d \r\n  at 757 (quoting Orr v. First National Stores, Inc., 280 A.2d 785 (Me. \r\n  1971)). \r\n   \r\n\"It has long been the law in South \r\n  Carolina that a merchant is not an insurer of the safety of his customer but \r\n  owes them only the duty of exercising ordinary care to keep the premises in \r\n  reasonably safe condition.\" Milligan v. Winn-Dixie Raleigh, Inc., 273 \r\n  S.C. 118, 120, 254 S.E.2d 798, 799 (1979) (quoting Pennington v. Zayre Corp., \r\n  252 S.C. 176, 165 S.E.2d 695 (1969)). See also Denton v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, \r\n  Inc., 312 S.C. 119, 439 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993); Young v. Meeting \r\n  Street Piggly Wiggly, 288 S.C. 508, 343 S.E.2d 636 (Ct. App. 1986). The \r\n  duty of ordinary care includes the duty to keep the aisles and passageways in \r\n  a reasonably safe condition. Moore v. Levitre, 294 S.C. 453, 365 S.E.2d \r\n  730 (1988); Cook v. Food Lion, Inc., 328 S.C. 324, 491 S.E.2d 690 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997). \r\nWhile the issue of falling merchandise \r\n  has not been addressed by the courts of this state, the general rule has been \r\n  stated: \r\n   \r\n[S]tore owners are under a duty to \r\n  so display their goods that they will not ordinarily fall and injure customers \r\n  who are in the exercise of ordinary care for their own safety; this includes \r\n  a duty to take reasonable measures to guard against injuries caused by the falling \r\n  of stacked merchandise which may result from the actions of other customers. \r\n   \r\n   \r\n62A Am.Jur.2d Premises Liability \r\n  Â§ 595 (1990). See also, Wooley v Great Atlantic &amp; Pacific Tea Co., \r\n  180 F. Supp. 529 (W.D. Pa. 1960), aff'd 281 F.2d 78 (3rd Cir. 1960); \r\n  Keith v S. S. Kresge Co., 225 S.E.2d 135 (N.C. App. 1976).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Breach of Duty \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQuestions of negligence, proximate \r\n  cause and contributory negligence are ordinarily questions of fact for the jury, \r\n  as to which the trial court's only function is to inquire whether particular \r\n  conclusions are or not the only reasonable inferences to be drawn from the evidence. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nKennedy v. Custom Ice Equipment \r\n  Co., Inc., 271 S.C. 171, 246 S.E.2d 176 (1978) (quoting Wilson \r\n  v. Marshall, 260 S.C. 271, 195 S.E.2d 610 (1973)). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA plethora of cases have established \r\n  a duty of exercising reasonable care is owed to an invitee. See Henderson, \r\n  supra; Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984); \r\n  Hughes, supra. If any reasonable inferences exist which tend to show \r\n  negligence, then it was a question for the jury and not the court to determine \r\n  if Bi-Lo was liable for Garvin's injuries. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe cannot say as a matter of law \r\n  the only reasonable inference from all the facts of this case is Bi-Lo was not \r\n  negligent. The facts show Bi-Lo created the display of cans by stacking them \r\n  over 5 foot 2 inches tall and advertised them for reduced sale. The injuries \r\n  Garvin sustained by cans falling from the display are within the \"reasonable \r\n  generalized gamut of greater than ordinary dangers of injury.\" Hughes, supra. \r\n  One reasonable inference is when can goods are stacked and advertised for reduced \r\n  sale, people will be attracted to the display and will do just as Garvin did, \r\n  reach up and grab the cans, which can cause the cans to fall. The jury, not \r\n  the Court, should determine if a reasonable person would display canned goods \r\n  in the manner chosen by Bi-Lo. A jury issue exists as to whether Bi-Lo maintained \r\n  its premises in a reasonably safe condition.  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe hold Garvin was not required to \r\n  show Bi-Lo had notice of previous problems with the display, since the store's \r\n  employees created the alleged hazard. We rule Bi-Lo had a duty to Garvin as \r\n  an invitee to keep the premises reasonably safe. A material question of fact \r\n  exists as to whether Bi-Lo maintained safe premises or whether the display of \r\n  stacked cans was unreasonable. Accordingly, the grant of summary judgment in \r\n  favor of Bi-Lo is \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1. Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3058","title":"SC Department of Social Services v.

Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-610(M) and 20-7-736(E). \r\n  DSS contends that Â§Â§ 20-7-610(M) and 20-7-736(E) require a hearing on the merits \r\n  to be scheduled, but not necessarily completed, within thirty-five days of the \r\n  removal petition. We agree and reverse. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPursuant to a family court ex parte \r\n  order filed on August 13, 1998, Benita Gamble's minor child was removed from \r\n  her home without her consent and placed into the emergency protective custody \r\n  of DSS. DSS filed a complaint for removal on August 14. Thereafter, at a probable \r\n  cause hearing, a DSS caseworker testified that she had received a report of \r\n  suspected abuse and that she had observed bruises on both arms of the minor. \r\n  The caseworker further testified that the child told her that his mother, Benita \r\n  Gamble, inflicted the bruises by beating him with a broom handle. The family \r\n  court found that probable cause existed for the removal of the child and ordered \r\n  that legal and physical custody of the minor be given to DSS. The court further \r\n  ordered that \"the hearing on the merits in this case be held within the time \r\n  period mandated by state law.\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA hearing on the merits was originally \r\n  scheduled for one hour on September 15, 1998. At the scheduled time, DSS arrived \r\n  with six witnesses and Gamble arrived with fifteen witnesses. The family court \r\n  concluded that there was not enough time available to hear the case that day. \r\n  The court decided to reschedule the case for another day \"to allow ample time \r\n  to litigate this matter.\" Gamble subsequently moved for an order allowing discovery, \r\n  which was granted on October 16, 1998.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe merits hearing was rescheduled \r\n  for November 5, 1998, but was not concluded.(1) \r\n  Gamble then filed a motion to vacate the order granting custody to DSS on the \r\n  ground that the hearing on the merits was not completed within thirty-five days \r\n  of the removal of the minor. The family court granted Gamble's motion and dismissed \r\n  the case for failure to timely prosecute. Thereafter this Court granted appellant's \r\n  petition for supersedeas and stayed the action of the family court.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn appeal, DSS argues the family \r\n  court erred in dismissing the case for lack of timely prosecution under S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-610(M) and 20-7-736(E) because the merits hearing was in fact \r\n  scheduled to be held within the thirty-five day period mandated by statute. \r\n  We agree. \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-610(M) (Supp. \r\n  1998) provides that \"[t]he hearing to determine whether removal of custody is \r\n  needed, pursuant to Section 20-7-736, must be held within thirty-five days of \r\n  the date of receipt of the removal petition.\"(2) \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(E) (Supp. 1998) provides that \"[u]pon receipt of a \r\n  removal petition under this section, the family court shall schedule a hearing \r\n  to be held within thirty-five days of the date of receipt to determine whether \r\n  removal is necessary.\" At issue in this case is the interpretation of these \r\n  two statutory provisions. \r\n   \r\nWhen interpreting a statute, the \r\n  court must ascertain the intent of the legislature. Whiteside v. Cherokee \r\n  County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993). \"Of course, \r\n  where a statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, legislative intent must \r\n  be determined from the language of the statute itself.\" Whitner v. State, \r\n  328 S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779, (1997). Courts should consider \"not merely \r\n  the language of the particular clause being construed, but the word and its \r\n  meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy \r\n  of the law.\" Id. \r\n   \r\nAlthough section 20-7-610(M) states \r\n  that the merits hearing in a removal case must be held within thirty-five days \r\n  of the removal petition, the statute fails to define the term \"held.\" However, \r\n  section 20-7-610(M) instructs that the removal hearing is to be held \"pursuant \r\n  to\" section 20-7-736(E), which uses the terms \"shall schedule.\" Reading section \r\n  20-7-610(M) in conjunction with section 20-7-736(E), the plain language of the \r\n  statute indicates that a merits hearing must be scheduled to be held \r\n  within thirty-five days of receipt of the removal petition. The statute does \r\n  not indicate that the hearing must be completed within the thirty-five \r\n  day period. Therefore the requirement that a hearing on the merits actually \r\n  come to a conclusion within thirty-five days of the removal petition should \r\n  not be read into the statute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, section 20-7-610(M) \r\n  is part of the emergency protective custody statute and should be construed \r\n  in light of the purpose of the statute. The purpose of section 20-7-610 is to \r\n  protect minors from abuse and neglect by providing a means to remove a minor \r\n  from an environment in which there is probable cause to suspect abuse or neglect. \r\n  Therefore, this Court should interpret section 20-7-610(M) in a way that harmonizes \r\n  the language at issue with the protective purpose of the statute. By reading \r\n  section 20-7-610(M) to require that a hearing on the merits be scheduled to \r\n  be held, but not necessarily completed, within the thirty-five day period, the \r\n  Court gives effect to the statutory language and also contributes to the safety \r\n  of the minor. To read the statute otherwise could result in the return of a \r\n  minor to the custody of a parent, without the benefit of a hearing on the merits, \r\n  in a case in which a court has already found that probable cause to suspect \r\n  child abuse or neglect exists. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn State v. Estridge, 320 \r\n  S.C. 288, 465 S.E.2d 91 (Ct. App. 1995), this Court construed a statute which \r\n  required that a case not \"disposed of\" within 180 days of a transfer from circuit \r\n  court to magistrate's court automatically revert to the docket of the circuit \r\n  court. In determining the legislative intent, the Court interpreted \"to dispose \r\n  of\" as \"to attend to.\" The Court rejected \"conclude\" as the meaning of \"disposed \r\n  of,\" stating that such an interpretation would \"complicate or frustrate\" the \r\n  legislature's intent \"to facilitate the disposition of criminal cases.\" Id. \r\n  at 290-91, 465 S.E.2d at 93. The Court decided that by scheduling the appellant's \r\n  case for trial and overseeing jury selection within 180 days of the transfer, \r\n  the magistrate's court had attended to and thus disposed of the appellant's \r\n  case by the 180 day deadline. The Court reasoned that the legislature intended \r\n  to provide a means for criminal defendants in certain cases to expedite their \r\n  cases, not to provide a means for criminal defendants to \"foil the criminal \r\n  justice system once the processing of their cases had begun.\" Id. at \r\n  291, 465 S.E.2d at 93. \r\n   \r\nAlthough the Estridge case \r\n  dealt with a magistrate's court statute, not an emergency protective custody \r\n  statute, the reasoning behind the Court's decision in Estridge applies \r\n  to this case as well. To hold that the merits hearing must be completed within \r\n  thirty-five days of the petition for removal would bring to a halt cases which \r\n  were begun within the statutory period but which, for whatever reason, were \r\n  not brought to a close within the thirty-five days. Although the legislature \r\n  intended to expedite merit hearings in child removal cases, it surely did not \r\n  intend to provide allegedly abusive or neglectful parents a strategic way to \r\n  avoid the full merits hearing and have their cases dismissed. To hold otherwise \r\n  would mean that by simply dragging out the hearing process beyond the thirty-five \r\n  day deadline, through discovery motions or excessive witnesses, an allegedly \r\n  abusive parent or guardian could have his or her case dismissed and regain custody \r\n  of the child. Moreover, a removal case should not be dismissed simply because \r\n  the family court's docket was too full and the judge decided on his or her own \r\n  to continue the action at the last minute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the hearing on the \r\n  merits was originally scheduled for September 15, 1998, within thirty-five days \r\n  of the August 14 complaint for removal. The parties appeared in court, prepared \r\n  to have a hearing, on September 15. Thus, looking to the plain language of section \r\n  20-7-736(E), the requirement that \"the family court schedule a hearing to be \r\n  held within thirty-five days of receipt\" of the removal petition is satisfied \r\n  in this case. Moreover, our case law supports this conclusion. Under an Estridge \r\n  analysis, and in light of the legislative intent, the merits hearing was scheduled \r\n  to be held within thirty-five days of the removal petition within the meaning \r\n  of sections 20-7-610(M) and 20-7-736(E).(3)  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n III. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRespondent, however, challenges the \r\n  constitutionality of section 20-7-610(M). Gamble argues that by delaying the \r\n  conclusion of the merits hearing beyond the statutory deadline of thirty-five \r\n  days, her fundamental right to bear and raise her child is impaired. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 \r\n  S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999), the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality \r\n  of section 20-7-610(A), which authorizes a law enforcement official to take \r\n  a minor into emergency protective custody in certain situations. If there is \r\n  probable cause to believe that a child is in substantial and imminent danger \r\n  of physical harm through abuse or neglect, the child may be taken into emergency \r\n  protective custody without the consent of the parent. The Court balanced the \r\n  parent's interest in his or her child with the \"statutory right of a child to \r\n  be free of abusive or neglectful situations.\" Id. at 295, 513 S.E.2d \r\n  at 366. The Court noted that the legislature and the courts have become increasingly \r\n  concerned with the best interest of the child when dealing with abusive situations. \r\n  The Court held that \"[s]ection 20-7-610(A), part of an emergency protective \r\n  custody statute with specific deadlines and detailed procedures that safeguard \r\n  the rights of parents and their children, does not violate the state or federal \r\n  constitutions.\" Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOther courts have also upheld emergency \r\n  protective custody statutes. In White by White v. Chambliss, 112 F.3d \r\n  731, cert. denied 118 S. Ct. 296 (1997), the Fourth Circuit noted \r\n  that South Carolina's emergency protective custody statute is constitutional, \r\n  comparing it to Virginia's law. In Jordan by Jordan v. Jackson, 15 F.3d \r\n  333 (1994), the Fourth Circuit held that Virginia's emergency protective custody \r\n  statute is constitutional. The court recognized that while parents have a fundamental \r\n  right to raise and care for their children, the state has a compelling interest \r\n  in the safety and welfare of its children. The parents in Jordan by Jordan \r\n  specifically challenged the statutory delays between the emergency removal and \r\n  the initial judicial review. The court stated that \"it is well-settled that \r\n  the requirements of process may be delayed where emergency action is necessary \r\n  to avert imminent harm to a child.\" Id. at 343. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn this case, the mother certainly \r\n  has a fundamental right to raise and care for her child. However, the child \r\n  also has a fundamental right in being free from abuse or neglect. The statute \r\n  at issue balances these rights. The statute has built-in guidelines for the \r\n  removal of the child and for hearings determining whether probable cause existed \r\n  and whether the removal was proper. The statute requires the family court to \r\n  schedule a hearing on the merits to be held within thirty-five days of the removal \r\n  petition.  \r\n   \r\nAlthough the hearing on the merits \r\n  was not completed within the thirty-five days in this case, there was an initial \r\n  determination of probable cause, and the hearing on the merits was in fact scheduled \r\n  to be held within thirty-five days of the removal petition. The mother's actions \r\n  certainly contributed to the delay in this case. The request for discovery and \r\n  the number of witnesses brought into the courtroom resulted in the inability \r\n  of the court to resolve this matter within thirty-five days of the removal petition. \r\n  We think that respondent's constitutional argument is without merit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, for the foregoing reasons, \r\n  the decision of the family court is hereby \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J., HUFF, and STILWELL, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n1.  The order \r\n  from the November 5 hearing is not included in the record. The parties agree \r\n  there was a rescheduled hearing on November 5 that was not concluded, but the \r\n  only discussion of the events of the hearing is in appellant's motion to stay \r\n  Judge Wylie's order, appellant's petition for writ of supersedeas, and the grant \r\n  of supersedeas. According to this discussion, Gamble arrived at the hearing \r\n  with more than twenty-five witnesses. By the end of the day only three witnesses \r\n  had testified, and the court continued the action. \r\n2.  The portion \r\n  of section 20-7-610(M) regarding time limits for the hearing on the merits has \r\n  been substantially changed by the 1999 amendment. See Act No. 104 Â§ 10, effective \r\n  June 30, 1999. Because this case precedes the effective date of the amendment, \r\n  however, we do not address the amended section of the statute. \r\n3.  Given our \r\n  conclusion on this issue, we need not address the other arguments raised by \r\n  DSS. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3059","title":"McCraw v.

McCraw, reversing \r\n  the full commission's finding that she had failed to file her claim within the \r\n  two year statute of limitations period. We affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and remand. \r\n   \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMcCraw worked continuously for the \r\n  hospital from 1961 until November of 1992. From 1986 to September, \r\n  1991 she worked as an assistant in the endoscopy unit, where her duties included \r\n  cleaning and disinfecting equipment with cleaners containing Glutaraldehyde, \r\n  a respiratory irritant.(1) The cleaners burned \r\n  McCraw's eyes and irritated her throat, causing chest tightness, congestion, \r\n  wheezing, choking, and coughing. Initially, her symptoms resolved when she left \r\n  work at the end of the day, but by the time she left her employment, McCraw's \r\n  symptoms remained even after leaving work each day.  \r\n   \r\nIn 1990, McCraw was treated by Dr. \r\n  Mary Lou Applebaum on one occasion for sinusitis.(2) \r\n  Dr. Applebaum is a pulmonary specialist who is the director of the respiratory \r\n  center at the hospital. Dr. Applebaum also worked with McCraw in the endoscopy \r\n  unit and observed her breathing difficulties while working with the chemicals. \r\n  By September of 1991, McCraw realized her respiratory symptoms were related \r\n  to her exposure to the chemicals. When she saw Dr. Applebaum in the endoscopy \r\n  unit, she asked Dr. Applebaum if it would help for her to leave the endoscopy \r\n  unit. Dr. Applebaum responded that she \"certainly thought it was worth a try.\" \r\n  In September 1991, McCraw transferred out of the endoscopy unit and was ultimately \r\n  placed in the child care center of the hospital.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMcCraw began seeing Dr. Applebaum \r\n  again as a patient on March 30, 1992. In July 1992, Dr. Applebaum treated McCraw \r\n  for asthmatic bronchitis. On October 30, 1992, Dr. Applebaum reported that McCraw \r\n  continued to suffer from sinusitis and bronchitis. Dr. Applebaum testified McCraw's \r\n  allergies predisposed her to these types of infections.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn November 13, 1992, McCraw again \r\n  complained to Dr. Applebaum of congestion and shortness of breath. Dr. Applebaum \r\n  told McCraw to stop working and admitted McCraw to the hospital on November \r\n  19, 1992, for treatment of pneumonia and asthma. With in-patient care, the pneumonia \r\n  cleared up, but the asthma remained. McCraw left the hospital on November 22, \r\n  1992, but did not return to work. She submitted a long term disability claim \r\n  to the hospital on January 12, 1993, in which she stated her condition was related \r\n  to her employment.  \r\n   \r\nDr. Applebaum testified that McCraw \r\n  initially had a stable asthmatic condition which was mild in degree and allowed \r\n  her to work on a regular basis, but the chemical exposure triggered a severe \r\n  progression of the disease which was not reversible upon leaving \r\n  that environment.  To a reasonable degree of medical certainty, \r\n  Dr. Applebaum believed McCraw's exposure to chemicals in the endoscopy unit \r\n  and her work in the hospital's child care center exacerbated McCraw's underlying \r\n  condition to the point McCraw is unable to maintain employment.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn November 14, 1994, McCraw filed \r\n  a form 50 claiming total disability and seeking benefits from exposure to chemicals \r\n  within the scope of her employment. The hospital denied McCraw's claims. The \r\n  hearing commissioner awarded McCraw benefits finding she sustained a compensable \r\n  occupational respiratory disease brought within the applicable statute of limitations. \r\n  The full commission reversed the hearing commissioner finding Dr. Applebaum \r\n  diagnosed McCraw with lung disease in 1991 but McCraw failed to file a workers' \r\n  compensation claim within two years of receiving notice of the definitive diagnosis. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe circuit court reversed the full \r\n  commission finding the two-year filing period commenced only after the claimant \r\n  was given notice of a definitive diagnosis and became totally disabled. \r\n  The circuit court found McCraw complied with the statute of limitations and \r\n  remanded the matter to the full commission for disposition and payment of benefits. \r\n  The circuit court subsequently denied the hospital's motion to alter or amend \r\n  judgment and found the hospital's additional sustaining grounds were not preserved \r\n  and were meritless. The hospital appeals, contending McCraw failed to comply \r\n  with the applicable statute of limitations and failed to report the alleged \r\n  injury to the hospital within the statutorily defined time period.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF \r\n  REVIEW \r\n   \r\nIn reviewing a Workers' Compensation \r\n  Commission's decision, an appellate court must affirm the Commission's factual \r\n  findings if they are supported by substantial evidence and not controlled by \r\n  legal error. Tiller v. National Health Care Center, 334 S.C. 333, 513 \r\n  S.E.2d 843 (1999). \"Substantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, \r\n  but evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable \r\n  minds to reach the conclusion the agency reached.\" Tiller, 334 S.C. at \r\n  338, 513 S.E.2d at 845 (citing Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 \r\n  S.C. 306, 454 S.E.2d 320 (1995)).  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"An appellate court may not substitute \r\n  its judgment for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions \r\n  of fact unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative, and substantial evidence on the record.\" Tiller, 334 S.C. \r\n  at 339, 513 S.E.2d at 845. \"The statute of limitations applicable to workers' \r\n  compensation claims, like the Workers' Compensation Act as a whole, should be \r\n  given liberal construction, and any reasonable doubts should be resolved in \r\n  favor of coverage.\" Rogers v. Spartanburg Regional Medical Ctr., 328 \r\n  S.C. 415, 418, 491 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct. App. 1997)(citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe hospital contends South Carolina \r\n  Code section 42-15-40 bars McCraw's occupational disease claim. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 42-15-40 provides in pertinent \r\n  part: \r\n   \r\nThe right to compensation under this \r\n  title is barred unless a claim is filed with the commission within two years \r\n  after an accident, or if death resulted from accident, within two years of the \r\n  date of death. However, for occupational disease claims the two-year period \r\n  does not begin to run until the employee concerned has been diagnosed definitively \r\n  as having an occupational disease and has been notified of the diagnosis.\r\n \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. \r\n  1998) (emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nThe full commission found as a fact \r\n  that Dr. Applebaum definitively diagnosed McCraw with lung disease, categorized \r\n  as occupational asthma, in 1991. The circuit court reversed on the grounds that \r\n  the statute of limitations did not begin to run until McCraw had been notified \r\n  of a definitive diagnosis and suffered total disability, citing Bailey v. \r\n  Covil Corp., 291 S.C. 417, 354 S.E.2d 35 (1987) as its authority. Although \r\n  we disagree with the circuit court's interpretation of Bailey, we conclude \r\n  the full commission's finding was clearly erroneous in view of the substantial \r\n  evidence in the record. Consequently, we affirm. See Brading v. County \r\n  of Georgetown, 327 S.C. 107, 490 S.E.2d 4 (1997) (appellate court may affirm \r\n  for any reason appearing in the record). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn 1991, Dr. Applebaum only spoke \r\n  with McCraw about her illness when they worked together in the endoscopy unit. \r\n  Dr. Applebaum did not treat McCraw as a patient, aside from her treatment in \r\n  1990 for sinusitis, until March 30, 1992. Even then, Dr. Applebaum did not diagnose \r\n  McCraw with occupational asthma. There is simply no evidence Dr. Applebaum formally \r\n  evaluated, let alone definitively diagnosed, McCraw with an occupational disease \r\n  in 1991. Although Dr. Applebaum testified she could hear McCraw wheezing, she \r\n  did not examine McCraw, test her, diagnose her, or treat her in 1991. McCraw \r\n  knew in 1991 that her symptoms were related to the chemicals in the endoscopy \r\n  unit, but there is no evidence that any physician had definitively determined \r\n  that her exposure to the chemicals had triggered the progression of her pulmonary \r\n  disease, much less notified McCraw of that fact. The confirmation that chemicals \r\n  in the work environment should be avoided and were potentially related to breathing \r\n  difficulties, even though relayed to the claimant by a qualified physician, \r\n  do not under any view of the evidence constitute a definitive diagnosis of an \r\n  occupational disease as contemplated by the statute. Rogers, 328 S.C. \r\n  at 418, 491 S.E.2d at 710 (\"The statute of limitations applicable to workers' \r\n  compensation claims, like the Workers' Compensation Act as a whole, should be \r\n  given liberal construction, and any reasonable doubts should be resolved in \r\n  favor of coverage.\"). \r\n   \r\nThe first plausible date supporting \r\n  an argument Dr. Applebaum definitively diagnosed McCraw with an occupational \r\n  disease occurred on November 19, 1992, when Dr. Applebaum took McCraw out of \r\n  work and admitted her to the hospital. Even if we conclude this event amounted \r\n  to a definitive diagnosis, McCraw applied for benefits on November 14, 1994, \r\n  within two years of the designated definitive diagnosis. \r\nIt is questionable McCraw even suffered \r\n  a compensable injury in 1991. The Workers' Compensation Act (the Act) outlines \r\n  specific guidelines for pulmonary diseases stating: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNo compensation shall be payable \r\n  for any pulmonary disease arising out of the inhalation of organic or inorganic \r\n  dust or fumes unless the claimant suffers disability as described in \r\n  Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 and shall not be compensable under Â§ 42-9-30; provided, \r\n  however, in claims based on byssinosis the claimant must have been exposed to \r\n  dust in his employment for a period of at least seven years. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-60 (1985) \r\n  (first emphasis added). \r\n   \r\nSections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 set \r\n  forth the amount of compensation for total and partial disabilities. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-9-10 (Supp. 1998); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1985). The Act defines \r\n  disability as follows: \r\n   \r\nAs used in this chapter, \"disablement\" \r\n  means the event of an employee's becoming actually incapacitated, partially \r\n  or totally, because of an occupational disease, from performing his work \r\n  in the last occupation in which injuriously exposed to the hazards of such \r\n  disease, \"partial disability\" means the physical inability to continue \r\n  work in such occupation only and \"total disability\" means the physical \r\n  inability to perform work in any occupation. The disablement and disability \r\n  of an employee from an occupational disease shall be determined as provided \r\n  in this chapter. \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-20 (1985) \r\n  (italics in original; underline added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNot until November 1992 did McCraw \r\n  become incapable of performing her functions as a nursing assistant. Accordingly, \r\n  McCraw did not suffer a disability as defined under the Act until November 1992 \r\n  and could not have brought a claim until then. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-60 \r\n  (1985) (\"No compensation shall be payable for any pulmonary disease . . . unless \r\n  the claimant suffers disability. . . .\"); See also Mauldin \r\n  v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639, 640 (1992) (two-year \r\n  limitation period provided in Section 42-15-40 runs from the date claimant discovered \r\n  the compensable injury); Bailey v. Covil Corp. 291 S.C. 417, 419, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 35, 36 (1987) (\"A claim for total disability benefits arising from an \r\n  occupational disease must be filed within two years after the claimant has received \r\n  notice of a definitive diagnosis of the disease and has \r\n  become totally disabled.\")(citations omitted)(emphasis added).\r\n \r\nThe hospital contends the circuit \r\n  court incorrectly imposed a requirement of total disability as a precursor to \r\n  triggering the two year statute under Bailey, arguing Bailey conflicts \r\n  with Goff v. Mills, 279 S.C. 382, 308 S.E.2d 778 (1983) and S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. section 42-15-40 (Supp. 1998). Although we agree with the hospital that \r\n  total disability is not required to trigger the two year statute, we disagree \r\n  that Bailey is inconsistent with Goff and section 42-15-40.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 42-15-40 provides in pertinent \r\n  part: \"[F]or occupational disease claims the two-year period does not begin \r\n  to run until the employee concerned has been diagnosed definitively as \r\n  having an occupational disease and has been notified of the diagnosis.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 1985) (emphasis added). In Goff, our \r\n  supreme court recognized, in dicta, that section 42-15-40 legislatively established \r\n  the beginning date of the statute of limitations period (definitive diagnosis \r\n  and notification) and supplanted the judicially established test first enunciated \r\n  in Drake v. Raybestos-Manhattan, Inc., 241 S.C. 116, 127 S.E.2d 288 (1962). \r\n  Drake was decided at a time when Â§ 42-15-40 required total disability \r\n  from an occupational pulmonary disease as a condition for compensation. The \r\n  Drake court held the limitations period began to run when the disease \r\n  culminated in total disability and when by reasonable diligence \r\n  the claimant could have discovered that his condition was a compensable \r\n  case. Drake, 241 S.C. at 122-3, 127 S.E.2d at 291-2 (1962)(emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter Goff, our supreme court \r\n  held in Bailey: \"A claim for total disability benefits arising from an \r\n  occupational disease must be filed within two years after the claimant has received \r\n  notice of a definitive diagnosis of the disease and has \r\n  become totally disabled.\" Bailey, 291 S.C. at 419, 354 S.E.2d at \r\n  36 (emphasis added)(citations omitted). The hospital contends this rule for \r\n  determining the beginning of the limitations period is irreconcilable with the \r\n  Act as amended in 1978 and the holding in Goff. As we read Bailey, \r\n  it states the rule in the context of total disability, not because pre-1978 \r\n  law was applied, but because the claim in that case was for total disability. \r\n  Had the Court dealt with a partial disability claim, we believe the above quote \r\n  would have employed the phrase 'partial disability' instead of 'total disability.' \r\n  In our view, Bailey is thus easily reconciled with Goff and the \r\n  Act when read in conjunction with section 42-11-60 and Mauldin. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs discussed above, the Act requires \r\n  a compensable disability to bring an occupational disease claim. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-11-60 (1985). By amendment in 1978, the requirement of total \r\n  disability from occupational pulmonary disease as a condition of compensation \r\n  was removed, and partial disability became compensable. Under section 42-11-60, \r\n  no compensation is payable unless a claimant suffers some disability. Under \r\n  Mauldin, the statute of limitations does not begin to run until the claimant \r\n  discovers a compensable injury. Accordingly, we conclude that Bailey \r\n  provides the consistent rule that the two year statute of limitations begins \r\n  to run for an occupational disease when the claimant receives notice of a definitively \r\n  diagnosed occupational disease and suffers some compensable injury, that is, \r\n  some disability.  \r\n   \r\nThe hospital's final argument is \r\n  that McCraw failed to file notice of the injury within 90 days as required by \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20 (1985). This argument is intertwined with the first \r\n  issue, which we have decided adversely to the hospital. The hospital asserts \r\n  that McCraw was required to report her injury within 90 days of her discovery \r\n  of occupational asthma in 1991. We have determined that the record does not \r\n  support a finding of notice of definitive diagnosis and disability from occupational \r\n  pulmonary disease prior to November 19, 1992. The commissioner's finding that \r\n  McCraw gave the hospital notice as required by Â§ 42-15-20 on January 6, 1993 \r\n  is not appealed, and is the law of the case. Brading v. County of Georgetown, \r\n  327 S.C. 107, 490 S.E.2d 4 (1997). Therefore, McCraw gave notice within the \r\n  statutorily outlined ninety day period. Hanks v. Blair Mills, Inc., 286 \r\n  S.C. 378, 381, 335 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 1985) (noting section 42-15-20 \"provides \r\n  no specific method of giving notice\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAccordingly, we affirm the circuit \r\n  court's reversal of the full commission's determination that McCraw failed to \r\n  comply with the statute of limitations. However, the circuit court erred in \r\n  remanding the case to the full commission for disposition and payment of benefits. \r\n  Though the single commissioner found McCraw to have a compensable claim, the \r\n  full commission never reached the merits of McCraw's claim. The full commission \r\n  is the ultimate fact finder and it is the sole responsibility of the commission \r\n  to determine the compensability of McCraw's claim. See Fox v. Newberry \r\n  County Memorial Hosp., 319 S.C. 278, 461 S.E.2d 392 (1995). We therefore \r\n  reverse the circuit court's affirmance of the single commissioner's order on \r\n  the merits and remand this matter to the Workers' Compensation Commission to \r\n  hold proceedings on the merits of McCraw's claim.\r\n \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART, and REMANDED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and HUFF, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n   \r\n1.

The parties stipulated to the facts and the trial court granted \r\n  judgment to North Area Taxi, finding as a matter of law that the damages sustained \r\n  did not arise out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of the vehicle. We affirm \r\n  in part and reverse in part.(1) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAnnie Rogers leased and operated \r\n  a 1988 Plymouth Diplomat taxi owned by North Area Taxi, Inc., a qualified self-insurer. \r\n  Around 9:45 p.m. on December 21, 1996, Rogers picked up and transported two \r\n  fares, Dwayne L. Robinson and Herbert Hamilton. Robinson and Hamilton, in a \r\n  planned and joint effort, attempted to rob Rogers while they were guests in \r\n  and occupants of the taxi. Rogers was shot during the attempted robbery. As \r\n  a result, Rogers lost control of the taxi and crashed into a parked vehicle \r\n  owned by Dudley, causing damage to Dudley's vehicle. Rogers eventually died \r\n  from her injuries.  \r\n   \r\nJewel Wright, as the personal representative \r\n  of Rogers' estate, and Dudley brought this action seeking a declaration that \r\n  Rogers, who was killed, and Dudley, who suffered property damage, should benefit \r\n  from liability coverage afforded under the terms of the minimum liability policy \r\n  mandated by law for self-insured vehicles.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDid the trial court err in holding \r\n  that the planned robbery and shooting of a taxi driver by two fare-paying passengers \r\n  did not constitute the requisite \"causal connection\" between the \"use\" of the \r\n  vehicle and the damages inflicted, and, therefore, did not trigger liability \r\n  coverage under the state's mandatory insurance laws? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNo automobile insurance policy may \r\n  be issued in this state unless it contains a provision protecting the person \r\n  defined as an insured against \"loss from the liability imposed by law for damages \r\n  arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use\" of the motor vehicle. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1998). An insured is \"any person who uses with \r\n  the consent, expressed or implied, of the named insured the motor vehicle to \r\n  which the policy applies and a guest in the motor vehicle to which the \r\n  policy applies . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-30(6) (Supp. 1998) (emphasis \r\n  added).(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnder South Carolina law, however, \r\n  a company that has more than twenty-five motor vehicles registered in its name \r\n  may be a self-insurer upon satisfying the statutory requirements. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 56-9-60 (Supp. 1998). As a self-insurer, North Area Taxi was required \r\n  to provide the same minimum protection to the public as the minimum limits required \r\n  by a statutory liability policy. Wright v. Smallwood, 308 S.C. 471, 419 \r\n  S.E.2d 219 (1992); Southern Home Ins. Co. v. Burdette's Leasing Service, \r\n  Inc., 268 S.C. 472, 234 S.E.2d 870 (1977). Technically, a self-insurer is \r\n  not an \r\ninsurer at all; rather, a self-insurer \r\n  provides a substitute for an insurance policy. Wright, 308 S.C. at 474, \r\n  419 S.E.2d at 221. \r\n   \r\nAt the time of the accident, the \r\n  statutorily required coverage was a minimum of $15,000 for bodily injury to \r\n  one person in any one accident, $30,000 for bodily injury to two or more persons \r\n  in any one accident, and $5,000 for injury to or destruction of the property \r\n  of others in any one accident. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (1989).(3) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWright and Dudley will be covered \r\n  against loss from liability imposed by law for damages arising out of the ownership, \r\n  maintenance, or use of the taxi only if a three-pronged test is satisfied. First, \r\n  the parties seeking coverage must establish a causal connection between the \r\n  vehicle and the injury. Wausau Underwriters Ins. Co. v. Howser, 309 S.C. \r\n  269, 422 S.E.2d 106 (1992). Second, no act of independent significance can occur \r\n  that breaks the causal link. Id. Third, the vehicle must have been used \r\n  for transportation at the time of the accident. Canal Insurance Co. v. Insurance \r\n  Co. of North America, 315 S.C. 1, 431 S.E.2d 577 (1993). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Wright's Claim \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Initially, Wright must establish \r\n  a causal connection between the vehicle and the injury. \"The test for determining \r\n  whether an injury arose out of the use of a vehicle turns on the causal connection \r\n  between the vehicle and the injury. No distinction is made as to whether the \r\n  injury resulted from a negligent, reckless, or intentional act.\" Home Ins. \r\n  Co. v. Towe, 314 S.C. 105, 107, 441 S.E.2d 825, 827 (1994) (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA causal connection is established \r\n  if it is shown that the vehicle was an \"active accessory\" to the assault. State \r\n  Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744 (1998). In \r\n  Aytes, the court observed: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe causation required is something \r\n  less than proximate cause and something more than the vehicle being the mere \r\n  site of the injury. The injury must be foreseeably identifiable with the normal \r\n  use of the vehicle. The required causal connection does not exist when the only \r\n  connection between an injury and the insured vehicle's use is the fact that \r\n  the injured person was an occupant of the vehicle when the shooting occurred. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nId. at 33, 503 S.E.2d at 745-46 \r\n  (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\nIn this case, Wright cites State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto Ins. v. Bookert, 330 S.C. 221, 499 S.E.2d 480 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  cert. granted, (Nov. 6, 1998), for her argument that the taxi was an \r\n  \"active accessory\" to the assault and that the use of the vehicle as a taxi \r\n  facilitated Rogers' being lured to a location of the assailants' choosing. In \r\n  Bookert, however, the injury was \"foreseeably identifiable\" with the \r\n  normal use of the vehicle. The court reasoned that in transporting the assailants \r\n  and their weapons to the scene of the shooting, the vehicle was used as a \"launching \r\n  pad\" for the gunshots. Id. at 232, 499 S.E.2d at 486. Moreover, the vehicle \r\n  in Bookert was \"not the situs of the accident nor was it merely the means \r\n  by which the assailant traveled to the situs.\" Id.; see also Travelers \r\n  Indemnity Co. v. Auto World of Orangeburg, Inc., 334 S.C. 137, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  692 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding that there was no causal connection as the vehicles \r\n  were not \"active accessories,\" nor were they being used for transportation at \r\n  the time of the injury). \r\n   \r\nUnlike Bookert, the vehicle \r\n  here did not serve as a launching pad for the assault. The vehicle served merely \r\n  as the situs of the shooting. The required causal connection does not exist \r\n  when the only connection between an injury and the insured vehicle's use is \r\n  the fact that the injured person was an occupant of the vehicle when the shooting \r\n  occurred. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 503 S.E.2d 744, (quoting Nationwide \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co. v. Brown, 779 F.2d 984, 989 (4th Cir. 1985)); see \r\n  also Doe v. South Carolina State Budget and Control Board, 329 S.C. \r\n  214, 494 S.E.2d 469 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. granted, (Oct. 21, 1998) (explaining \r\n  that the situs of the injury is not necessarily a causal link even though it \r\n  is connected spatially to the harm). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn Thornton v. Allstate Ins. Co., \r\n  391 N.W.2d 320 (Mich. 1986), the Michigan Supreme Court addressed an almost \r\n  identical issue, finding the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle did not \r\n  cause the injury to the taxi driver. Thornton was a taxi driver who received \r\n  a call directing him to pick up a fare. Upon his arrival, the passengers entered \r\n  the car and gave Thornton a specific destination. As he drove away from the \r\n  curb, one passenger shot and robbed him. Thornton sued under the taxi company's \r\n  first-party personal injury protection (PIP) benefits asserting that his injuries \r\n  arose out of his ownership, operation, maintenance, or use of the vehicle. He \r\n  argued the taxi was an instrumentality of the injury. The Michigan Supreme Court \r\n  rejected this argument.  \r\n   \r\nThe connection in this case between \r\n  the debilitating injuries suffered by Thornton and the use of the taxicab as \r\n  a motor vehicle is no more than incidental, fortuitous, or 'but for.' The motor \r\n  vehicle was not the instrumentality of the injuries. The motor vehicle here \r\n  was merely the situs of the armed robbery - the injury could have occurred whether \r\n  or not Thornton used a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. The relation between \r\n  the functional character of the motor vehicle and Thornton's injuries was not \r\n  direct - indeed, the relation is at most incidental. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n391 N.W.2d at 327-28 (citations omitted). \r\n   \r\n   \r\nThe Thornton court conceded \r\n  the injuries were likely \"foreseeably identifiable\" with the occupational or \r\n  commercial use of a motor vehicle as a taxi, but the relation of the injury \r\n  to the functional use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle was merely incidental \r\n  and fortuitous. \"The mere foreseeability of an injury as an incident to a given \r\n  use of a motor vehicle is not enough to provide . . . coverage where the injury \r\n  itself does not result from the use of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle.\" \r\n  Id. at 328(4) \r\n; see also Nationwide Mut. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Brown, 779 F.2d 984, 989 (4th Cir. 1985) (\"An assault \r\n  by an armed assailant upon the driver of a car is not the type of conduct that \r\n  is foreseeably identifiable with the normal use of a motor vehicle.\").  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSimilarly, Wright noted a special \r\n  danger confronting taxi drivers. \"As a cab driver, the danger for Annie Rogers \r\n  is precisely the issue in this case.\" We recognize that the potential for injury \r\n  to taxi drivers is foreseeably identifiable. The danger, however, is inherent \r\n  in the occupation and not in the use of the motor vehicle as a motor vehicle. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWright also argues that no act of \r\n  independent significance was present to interrupt the causal link because the \r\n  use of the vehicle and the act for which coverage is sought were \"inextricably \r\n  linked\" as one act. She explains that Rogers was a taxi driver whose assailants \r\n  were able to summon her to gain entrance to and ride behind her in her car by \r\n  virtue of their status as fare-paying guests. Further, she maintains that the \r\n  moving vehicle was essential to accomplishing the crime of shooting and robbing \r\n  Rogers. We disagree. \r\n   \r\nIn Doe, this court held that \r\n  a police officer's sexual assaults were acts of independent significance. \"The \r\n  injuries to [the victims] resulted from [the police officer's] assaults of them, \r\n  not from his use of the vehicle. To hold otherwise would subject automobile \r\n  liability carriers to exposure for any criminal act committed in the insured \r\n  vehicle.\" Doe, 329 S.C. at 219, 494 S.E.2d at 472. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLikewise, the assault of the gunmen \r\n  broke any causal connection between the vehicle and Rogers' injury because it \r\n  arose from an act of independent significance. The fatal injuries that Rogers \r\n  sustained were unrelated to any use of the vehicle. The same injuries could \r\n  have occurred when the vehicle was parked, or otherwise not moving, or when \r\n  Rogers or the gunmen were standing outside of the vehicle. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Dudley's Claim \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUnlike Wright's claim, however, Dudley's \r\n  claim arises out of the operation of the motor vehicle. Dudley's vehicle sustained \r\n  damages when Rogers' taxi careened into it following the shooting. That the \r\n  accident was caused by the assault on Rogers is irrelevant in determining Dudley's \r\n  coverage.  \r\n   \r\nIn Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co. v. \r\n  Brown, 779 F.2d 984 (4th Cir. 1985), the assailant was riding \r\n  as a passenger in a truck when he intentionally shoved the driver, causing the \r\n  truck to swerve into the assailant's wife's oncoming car. Following the accident, \r\n  the assailant jumped out of the truck and shot and killed his wife. The wife's \r\n  estate brought an action under various liability insurance policies. The insurance \r\n  companies sought declaratory judgment as to coverage for the injuries.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Fourth Circuit, interpreting \r\n  South Carolina law, held that there was no coverage for the shooting related \r\n  injuries because they did not arise out of the use of the vehicle. There was \r\n  no causal connection between the injuries and the use of the automobiles as \r\n  automobiles. Id. at 987. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nConversely, the court held that summary \r\n  judgment was inappropriate respecting claims arising out of the collision that \r\n  preceded the shooting. Although the court found non-coverage under two of the \r\n  liability policies,(5) it found coverage under \r\n  the victim's UIM policy and stated, \"[b]ecause the collision, as opposed to \r\n  the shooting, clearly arose out of the 'use of an auto as an auto' . . . any \r\n  injuries resulting from the collision itself are on that basis covered under \r\n  the policy.\" Id. at 991.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe same principle applies to Dudley. \r\n  Because the collision arose out of the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle, \r\n  the damages sustained by Dudley resulting from the collision itself should be \r\n  covered by the self-insurer. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED \r\n  IN PART. \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.  The issue \r\n  of whether the carjackers remained guests of the insured after they assaulted \r\n  her was not before the trial court; hence, we do not reach this issue. \r\n3.  This section \r\n  has since been amended effective March 1, 1999, to require $10,000 in property \r\n  damage coverage. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1998). \r\n4.  The Thornton \r\n  court's construction of the statutory language, \"use of a motor vehicle as a \r\n  motor vehicle,\" found in Michigan's PIP statute, is virtually identical to the \r\n  Aytes court's construction of the statutory language, \"use of these motor \r\n  vehicles,\" found in the automobile insurance statute regarding bodily injury \r\n  and property damage. Compare Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. Â§ 500.3105(1) (West \r\n  1993) (\"use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle\") with S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 38-77-140 (Supp. 1998) (\"use of these motor vehicles\") as construed in State \r\n  Farm Fire &amp; Cas. Co. v. Aytes, 332 S.C. 30, 33, 503 S.E.2d 744, 746 \r\n  (1998)(\"normal use of the vehicle\"). \r\n5.  The court \r\n  found non-coverage under the Nationwide garage policy because the collision \r\n  did not arise out of garage operations. Nationwide, 779 F.2d at \r\n  991. Additionally, the court found non-coverage under the vehicle in which the \r\n  assailant was riding when he caused the collision because the policy contained \r\n  an intentional act exclusion.

Code Ann Â§ 41-10-30A (Supp. 1998)(1) \r\n  are met by a minimum wage notification. The Circuit Court found a minimum wage \r\n  notification sufficient, and therefore, granted the Department's summary judgment \r\n  motion. CAFE and Stern appeal. We affirm.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nCAFE is a statewide group of thirteen \r\n  chapters consisting of over 1,000 dues paying families. In November 1994, CAFE \r\n  sponsored a \"Temp School.\" CAFE hired nineteen people for one week to obtain \r\n  information from them about their experiences with temporary employment. Despite \r\n  their complaints, none of the participants filed an official grievance.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA \"temp testing project\" was conducted \r\n  in the Greenville area in 1995-1996 to further investigate and document temporary \r\n  agency practices. Individuals, referred to as \"testers,\" were hired by CAFE \r\n  on a contract basis to register at \"targeted temp agencies,\" go out on assignments, \r\n  work at least one day, and submit written reports to CAFE. A second \"temp testing \r\n  project\" was later conducted state-wide. Stern was one of the testers. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn January 1997, CAFE assisted its \r\n  \"testers\" in filing complaints with the Department alleging the temporary agencies \r\n  failed to provide the written wage notice required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) \r\n  (Supp. 1998). Stern was registered with Adecco, and agreed to work for $6.00 \r\n  per hour. She wrote the Department on January 23, 1997: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI registered at Adia for temporary \r\n  employment on around November 22, 1996. I received a call from Adia on around \r\n  November 27 and was assigned to work at Holset. I worked at Holset as assigned \r\n  on around December 2, 1996 (one day only). \r\nAdia has never provided written notice \r\n  to me of the specific wages for this assignment, in violation of Section 41-10-30(A). \r\n  I request an investigation of this complaint, and upon confirmation of a violation, \r\n  that Adia be issued a warning letter as provided in Section 41-10-80(A). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nPlease note that I hereby designate \r\n  Mr. Charles Taylor(3) of the Carolina Alliance \r\n  for Fair Employment as my representative for the purpose of this complaint investigation. \r\n  Mr. Taylor can be reached at the CAFE office . . . Mr. Taylor is familiar with \r\n  my case, and he can help answer questions and relay messages to me as needed. \r\n  I also request that Mr. Taylor be provided with access to and copies of all \r\n  correspondence and other documentation in the course of this complaint investigation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShe followed up with a phone call \r\n  on February 10, 1997. On February 20, 1997, the Department investigated Adecco. \r\n  Adecco posted the following notice: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNORMAL HOURS OF WORK: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nTo be determined by assignment to \r\n  client/agencies, and will typically conform to client's normal working hours. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nRATE OF PAY: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEach employee is guaranteed a minimum \r\n  of $4.25 per hour. Some assignments will pay higher rates. For each assignment \r\n  you accept, your pay rate will be explained. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis verbiage is virtually identical \r\n  to that suggested by the Department for temporary agencies. The Department found \r\n  that Adecco had complied with the statute. Accordingly, it did not issue Adecco \r\n  a warning letter.  \r\n   \r\nThereafter, Charles Taylor, CAFE's \r\n  executive director, had a \"series of communications\" with the Department concerning \r\n  the interpretation that the minimum wage poster satisfied the wage notification \r\n  requirement. This suit requested: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[A] declaration of the meaning of \r\n  Section 41-10-30(a)'s notice provisions, in particular whether or not this section \r\n  applies to Adecco and similarly situated temporary employment services agencies \r\n  (sic), whether the notification required to be provided under that statute is \r\n  met by a general minimum wage notification or if more is required. The Plaintiff \r\n  Stern submits that her rights as a temporary employee have been impacted by \r\n  Defendant Adecco's failure to provide the notice required by law as well as \r\n  by the Department's incorrect statutory interpretation. Additionally, both Plaintiffs \r\n  assert that the rights of other temporary employees throughout South Carolina \r\n  who seek protection through Section 41-10-30(A) of the South Carolina Code of \r\n  Laws are potentially impacted by this action.(4) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAdecco answered admitting Stern was \r\n  an employee.(5) Adecco later filed a motion to \r\n  dismiss. The Trial Court denied that motion finding a justiciable controversy \r\n  between Adecco and Stern. A portion of that order addressed the standing of \r\n  CAFE and Stern to bring this action. The Trial Court explained: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDefendants argue, however, that because \r\n  CAFE does not allege an employer/employee relationship with [Adia], CAFE is \r\n  not entitled to notice, and thus it has no rights to assert; therefore, the \r\n  Court should dismiss CAFE from this lawsuit. I disagree. CAFE's standing \r\n  is more appropriately an issue for the trial judge. If the elements of a \r\n  justiciable controversy are present, then this action will survive the defendant's \r\n  12(b)(6) motion. Even though CAFE may not have standing, because the \r\n  plaintiffs have alleged that Stern is an \"employee\", this Court may determine \r\n  whether a justiciable controversy exits.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n(Emphasis added). At some point, \r\n  however, Adecco was dismissed from this suit. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe remaining parties filed cross-motions \r\n  for summary judgment. The Trial Court, granting the Department's motion, stated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[I]nterpreting the statute to require \r\n  notification of the specific hours of employment and rates of pay for each assignment \r\n  would be impracticable. . . . If, as Plaintiffs appear to contend, the temporary \r\n  employment agency is required to state more specifically the wages and hours \r\n  of each temporary assignment, then it would be, as argued by the Department, \r\n  practically impossible for a temporary employment agency to comply with the \r\n  requirements of the statute. . . . If possible, Courts should construe a statute \r\n  so as to escape an absurd interpretation and to carry the intention of the legislature \r\n  into effect. . . . The Department's interpretation of the statute is reasonable \r\n  and is consistent with the language utilized by the legislature. As argued by \r\n  the Department, the notice provision requires that the employer give enough \r\n  information as to wages and hours to a potential employee to put that employee \r\n  in an educated position to decide whether or not to accept employment. The Adia \r\n  notice accomplishes this purpose and is consistent with the language of the \r\n  statute as interpreted by the Department. In light of the record, this Court \r\n  finds no cogent reason to disagree with the Department in its interpretation \r\n  of the statute. \r\n   \r\nThe Trial Court did not address either \r\n  CAFE's or Stern's standing to maintain this suit. Following CAFE and Stern's \r\n  motion to reconsider, the Trial Court added: \"[T]his Court concludes as a matter \r\n  of law that the minimum wage notification approved by the Department of Labor \r\n  satisfies Â§ 41-10-30(A).\"  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial judge err in granting \r\n  summary judgment for the Department and finding no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact existed concerning the appropriate notification required under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A)? \r\n   \r\nII. Did the trial judge err in denying \r\n  summary judgment for CAFE and Stern?  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n   \r\n\"Summary judgment is proper where \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\" Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. \r\n  318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). All ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising \r\n  from the evidence must be construed most strongly against the moving party. \r\n  Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C. 412, 401 S.E.2d 169 (1991). \"Summary judgment \r\n  is proper where plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist on which reasonable \r\n  minds cannot differ.\" Rothrock v. Copeland, 305 S.C. 402, 405, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  366, 368 (1991). It is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts \r\n  of the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law. Tupper, \r\n  supra.  \r\n   \r\nEven when there is no dispute as \r\n  to evidentiary facts, but only as to the conclusions or inferences to be drawn \r\n  from them, summary judgment should be denied. Gilliland v. Elmwood Properties, \r\n  301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990). Because it is a drastic remedy, summary \r\n  judgment should be cautiously invoked so no person will be improperly deprived \r\n  of a trial of the disputed factual issues. Etheredge v. Richland Sch. Dist. \r\n  I, 330 S.C. 447, 499 S.E.2d 238 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe party seeking summary judgment \r\n  has the initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material \r\n  fact. Baughman v. American Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  537 (1991). Once the party moving for summary judgment meets this initial burden, \r\n  the non-moving party cannot simply rest on the mere allegations or denials contained \r\n  in the pleadings. Rule 56(e), SCRCP. Rather, the non-moving party must come \r\n  forward with specific facts showing there is a genuine issue for trial. Rule \r\n  56(e), SCRCP. \r\n   \r\nThe plain language of Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP, mandates the entry of summary judgment, after adequate time for discovery \r\n  against a party who fails to make a showing sufficient to establish the existence \r\n  of an element essential to the party's case and on which that party will bear \r\n  the burden of proof at trial. Baughman, supra. A complete failure \r\n  of proof concerning an essential element of the non-moving party's case necessarily \r\n  renders all other facts immaterial.

South Carolina Public Service Authority, 215 S.C. \r\n  193, 215, 54 S.E.2d 777, 787 (1949). While this question has not been raised \r\n  on appeal, we do so sua sponte, because the parties cannot by consent \r\n  or agreement confer jurisdiction on the court to render a declaratory judgment \r\n  in the absence of an actual justiciable controversy. Power v. McNair, \r\n  255 S.C. 150, 177 S.E.2d 551 (1970) (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. STERN \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"[A] private person may not invoke \r\n  the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action \r\n  unless he has sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining, prejudice \r\n  therefrom.\"Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, ___, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  69, 75 (1999) (citing Blandon v. Coleman, 285 S.C. 472, 330 S.E.2d 298 \r\n  (1985) and Myers v.

Such imminent prejudice must be of a personal nature \r\n  to the party laying claim to standing and not merely of general interest common \r\n  to all members of the public. Ex Parte Levitt, 302 U.S. 633, 58 S.Ct. \r\n  1, 82 L.Ed. 493 (1937); Baird, supra; Citizens of Lee County, \r\n  Inc. v.

State Bd. of Medical Examiners, 285 S.C. 266, 329 S.E.2d 433 (1985); \r\n  Florence Morning News, supra. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the complaint, Stern avers:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt the time of her hiring, or during \r\n  her short period of employment with Adecco, Plaintiff Stern was not given written \r\n  notice of the wages to be paid, the normal hours of work, the time and place \r\n  of payment or the deductions which would be made from her wages. \r\n   \r\n. . . .  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Plaintiff Stern submits that \r\n  her rights as a temporary employee have been impacted by Defendant Adecco's \r\n  failure to provide the notice required by law as well as by the Department's \r\n  incorrect statutory interpretation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, Stern was guaranteed $4.25 \r\n  per hour in the posted written notice, but received $6.00 per hour. In other \r\n  words, she complains she was not informed by Adecco, who is no longer involved \r\n  in this suit, that she would make more money than she was guaranteed. Stern \r\n  has failed to demonstrate any injury to her based on the Department's interpretation \r\n  of the statute, despite her conclusory allegations. Simply put, Stern was not \r\n  prejudiced, and has not sustained the requisite injury for maintaining this \r\n  law suit.  \r\n   \r\nB. CAFE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAn organization has standing only \r\n  if it alleges that it or its members will suffer an individualized injury; a \r\n  mere interest in a problem is not enough. Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 \r\n  U.S. 727, 92 S.Ct. 1361, 31 L.Ed.2d 636 (1972). See also Energy Research \r\n  Foundation v. Waddell, 295 S.C. 100, 367 S.E.2d 419 (1988) (finding the \r\n  organization alleged no individualized injury, and therefore, had no standing). \r\n  The complaint declares: \r\n   \r\n[B]oth Plaintiffs assert that the \r\n  rights of other temporary employees throughout South Carolina who seek protection \r\n  through Section 41-10-30(A) of the South Carolina Code of Laws are potentially \r\n  impacted by this action. \r\n   \r\nNowhere does CAFE allege any individualized \r\n  harm or injury to itself or any of its members. Therefore, it does not have \r\n  standing to bring this action. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. DECLARATORY JUDGMENT \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStern and CAFE seek a declaration \r\n  of the meaning of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) (Supp. 1998). The Declaratory \r\n  Judgments Act provides: \r\n   \r\nAny person . . . whose rights, status \r\n  or other legal relations are affected by a statute . . . may have determined \r\n  any question of construction or validity arising under the . . . statute . . \r\n  . and obtain a declaration of rights, status or other legal relations thereunder. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-53-30 (1977). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\"In declaratory judgment actions \r\n  '[t]he interest of the parties . . . to the subject matter of the controversy \r\n  must be more than merely general. It must be a substantial, direct, and legally \r\n  protected present interest in the relief sought.'\" Quinn v. City of Columbia, \r\n  303 S.C. 405, 407-08, 401 S.E.2d 165, 167 (1991) (footnote omitted) (citation \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nStern fails to allege, and fails \r\n  to demonstrate, how her rights have been impacted by the notice posted by Adecco \r\n  and the interpretation taken by the Department. CAFE and Stern both maintain \r\n  they are protecting others who may be \"potentially\" impacted. However, this \r\n  is too hypothetical to warrant declaratory relief. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBefore a court may render a declaratory \r\n  judgment, an actual, justiciable controversy must exist. A justiciable controversy \r\n  is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate for judicial \r\n  determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical or abstract \r\n  dispute. Orr v. Clyburn, [277 S.C. 536], 290 S.E.2d 804 (1982). \r\n \r\nPee Dee Elec. Co-op., Inc. v. \r\n  Carolina Power and Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe notice posted by Adecco and the \r\n  interpretation by the Department did not work an injustice on Stern. The claims \r\n  by Stern and CAFE on behalf of potentially affected future temporary employees \r\n  do not give rise to standing for either CAFE or Stern. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nD. PUBLIC IMPORTANCE \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOne exception to the requirement \r\n  a party have standing is if the issue is of such public importance that guidance \r\n  from this Court will prohibit future litigation. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHowever, a court may confer standing \r\n  upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution \r\n  for future guidance. See Thompson v. South Carolina Comm'n on Alcohol \r\n  and Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 229 S.E.2d 718 (1976) (holding that the plaintiffs \r\n  had standing because the questions involved were of such wide concern, both \r\n  to law enforcement personnel and to the public); Berry v. Zahler, 220 \r\n  S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951) (holding that questions of public interest originally \r\n  encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance); Ashmore \r\n  v. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947) (same); \r\n  cf. Quinn v.

Charleston County, \r\n  333 S.C. 519, ___, 511 S.E.2d 69, 75 (1999). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the economy today, a greater number \r\n  of businesses are relying on temporary employees. The duties of these employees \r\n  run the gamut of possibilities. Some are hired for only a few days to handle \r\n  purely clerical matters. Others are hired for extended periods in positions \r\n  with managerial responsibilities. The wages of these employees vary as much \r\n  as the nature of their assignments. One thing is certain, temporary agencies \r\n  are proliferating throughout the state and will continue to do so as long as \r\n  businesses focus on outsourcing and cutting costs. Temporary agencies have numerous \r\n  applicants and assignments, and to leave them in a constant state of flux or \r\n  confusion about the wage notification requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) \r\n  is unnecessary. \r\n   \r\nWe agree to address the merits of \r\n  Stern's claim to edify the Department as well as temporary agencies statewide. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 41-10-30(A) (Supp. 1998) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCAFE and Stern profess the Department \r\n  erroneously interpreted the statute. They assert the exact amount of the employee's \r\n  wages must be disclosed. We disagree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOur primary function in interpreting \r\n  a statute is to ascertain the intent of the legislature. Multi-Cinema, Ltd. \r\n  v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 292 S.C. 411, 357 S.E.2d 6 (1987). That \r\n  intent must be gleaned from the language chosen by the legislature. See \r\n  Glover by Cauthen v. Suitt Constr.

Where the legislature elects not to define the term in the statute, \r\n  the court will interpret the term in accord with its usual and customary meaning. \r\n  Ex Parte Adoptive Parents v. Biological Parents, 315 S.C. 535, 446 S.E.2d \r\n  404 (1994). The court must then apply that term according to its literal meaning. \r\n  Paschal v.

The verbiage used by Adecco is virtually \r\n  identical to that suggested by the Department for temporary agencies. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurther, Sharon Dantzler, Deputy \r\n  General Counsel for the South Carolina Department, who also helped draft the \r\n  statute, elucidated: \r\n   \r\nThis Section allows an employer to \r\n  set any wage terms that he finds appropriate. For example if the employer can \r\n  find workers who will work eighteen (18) hours a day, six (6) days a week, fifty \r\n  (50) weeks a year for a peppercorn, the State of South Carolina will not require \r\n  that he pay them any more than that. This statute does require that the employer \r\n  put the terms of employment in writing so that the worker knows what the arrangement \r\n  is at the time he or she is hired. The employer, using the example just given, \r\n  is obligated to pay the peppercorn at the time and place he has designated. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBased upon this interpretation of \r\n  the law, the Department allows an employer, including a temporary employment \r\n  service, to notify its employees at the time of hire that it may be offering \r\n  a range of wages and normal hours. When the employee receives that notice, he \r\n  can choose to work under that arrangement or he can go on to another employer. \r\n  It is the Department (sic) and my position that this interpretation, as it relates \r\n  to temporary services, is consistent with the meaning and intent of South Carolina \r\n  Code Section 41-10-30(A) and complies with that notification requirement. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Department interprets Section \r\n  41-10-30(A) so as to permit a temporary employment agency to provide its employee \r\n  with a range of the wages and normal hours of work the employee can expect at \r\n  various work sites. I have reviewed the notice of employment provided to Rachel \r\n  Stern by [Adecco] and I believe that this notice is in compliance with Section \r\n  41-10-30(A). \r\n   \r\nThe statute is a notice statute. \r\n  It is intended to provide the employee with the information requisite to make \r\n  an educated decision whether or not to accept employment. The wages, hours, \r\n  and time and place of payment must be stated. The Department acknowledged the \r\n  statute does not aim to treat temporary agencies any different than other employers. \r\n  The Department contends the statute intends notification to the employee and \r\n  employer of the minimum terms of the employment contract. Dantzler noted: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nParticularly in the 1990 debate, \r\n  the supporters of the legislation made it clear that they expected it to specifically \r\n  benefit the employees by seeing that the rules could not be changed on them \r\n  mid-employment, and that the minimum standards that had been promised to them \r\n  at the beginning would be maintained until the seven days notice was given. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Department believes the intent \r\n  of the statute is met if a temporary agency, in its notice, advises the employee \r\n  there will be variations in the terms of employment from assignment to assignment. \r\n  This can be achieved by providing the employee with the minimum terms or a range \r\n  of possible terms. We agree.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCAFE and Stern contend each temporary \r\n  employee must be given written notice of their specific pay for each assignment. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n   \r\nThe interpretation proposed by CAFE \r\n  and Stern's would be impractical, unreasonable, and reach an absurd result. \r\n  Requiring the agency to provide notice for each individual assignment, in which \r\n  wages and hours may differ, could lead to the rules being changed mid-stream. \r\n  If the agency has agreed to a minimum amount or number of hours for one assignment, \r\n  and that is the basis of the temporary employee agreeing to work for the specific \r\n  agency, there is nothing to prevent the agency from providing a different wage \r\n  or number of hours in the second assignment. Thus, the intent of the statute \r\n  would be defeated. \r\n   \r\nCAFE and Stern's interpretation would \r\n  work a disservice upon the temporary employee, and eliminate many of the assignments \r\n  temporary employees are intended to fill. The trial judge's order illuminated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, the notification provision \r\n  requires that any changes in the terms of employment must be made in writing \r\n  at least seven (7) calendar days before they become effective. If a temporary \r\n  employment agency were required to state more specifically the wages and hours \r\n  of each temporary assignment, then it would be, practically impossible for a \r\n  temporary employment agency to comply with the requirements of the statute. \r\n  For example: If a temporary employee received a two day assignment on Monday \r\n  and another assignment became available on Thursday, the temporary employment \r\n  agency could not comply with the statute and would be unable to offer the temporary \r\n  employee the position. \r\n   \r\nIndubitably, depriving the temporary \r\n  employee of a possible position is not what was intended by the general assembly \r\n  in passing this notification statute. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile we find neither Stern nor CAFE \r\n  have standing to bring this action, we have addressed the merits due to their \r\n  public importance. We believe it necessary to eliminate the confusion surrounding \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) (Supp. 1998) and provide future guidance to the \r\n  Department and temporary agencies. We rule the posting recommended by the Department \r\n  for use in temporary agencies, and the one utilized by Adecco, satisfy the requirements \r\n  of the statute as a matter of law.(6) The trial \r\n  judge's grant of summary judgment for the Department is  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.  \r\n  That statute provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nEvery employer shall notify \r\n  each employee in writing at the time of hiring of the normal hours and wages \r\n  agreed upon, the time and place of payment, and the deductions which will be \r\n  made from the wages, including payments to insurance programs. The employer \r\n  has the option of giving written notification by posting the terms conspicuously \r\n  at or near the place of work. Any changes in these terms must be made in writing \r\n  at least seven calendar days before they become effective. This section does \r\n  not apply to wage increases. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-30(A) \r\n(Supp. 1998). \r\n2. \r\nBecause oral argument would \r\nnot aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without \r\noral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n3. \r\n Charles Taylor is not an \r\nattorney licensed in South Carolina. \r\n4. \r\n There is no indication that \r\nCAFE or Stern ever sought certification as a class. See Rule 23(a), SCRCP. \r\n\r\n5. \r\n Chapter 10 does not define \r\nemployee, but excludes an independent contractor. See Adamson v. Marianne \r\nFabrics, Inc., 301 S.C. 204, 391 S.E.2d 249 (1990). \r\n6.  \r\n  We decline to separately address the issue of the trial judge's denial of CAF&Eacute; \r\n  and Stern's summary judgment motion. Their complaint is the Trial Court failed \r\n  to adopt their interpretation of the statute, and this issue has been answered. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3062","title":"State v.

We affirm. \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n   \r\nThe case against Weaverling arose \r\n  out of allegations he sexually abused his minor nephew, John Doe. The indictments \r\n  averring the three charges of criminal sexual conduct are time dated as follows: \r\n  (1) Indictment # 97-GS-46-454 -- \"on or about December 25, 1994\"; (2) Indictment \r\n  # 97-GS-46-935 -- \"on or about the end of June or the beginning of July, 1996\"; \r\n  and (3) Indictment # 97-GS-46-455 - \"on or about July 27, 1996.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDoe testified he was seven or eight \r\n  years old when Weaverling began the abuse. For approximately five or six years, \r\n  Weaverling performed fellatio on Doe almost every time he saw him. These incidents \r\n  occurred inside Weaverling's home, both in the living room and bedroom, and \r\n  in the woods and a barn near Doe's home. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDoe estimated Weaverling performed \r\n  oral sex on him on more than one hundred occasions. While performing the sex \r\n  acts, Weaverling often had Doe look at a pornographic magazine or watch a pornographic \r\n  movie. Weaverling showed Doe nude photographs of Weaverling's wife. After completing \r\n  the sexual acts, Weaverling would tell Doe, \"Oh, you were great\" or \"Oh, you \r\n  were good.\" He told Doe not to tell other people about their \"secret.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn December 25, 1994, Doe took his \r\n  Christmas dinner up to his tree house to eat. About five minutes later, Weaverling \r\n  came up to the tree house. Doe said Weaverling then \"unfastened my pants and \r\n  started sucking on my peter.\" When Doe's mother called his name, Doe pulled \r\n  up his pants and ran to the house. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nApproximately one to two weeks passed \r\n  before Weaverling touched Doe again. In January of 1995, Weaverling touched \r\n  Doe three or four times while the two were at Weaverling's home. During these \r\n  incidents, Weaverling showed Doe a \"dirty\" magazine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFor the next year and a half, Weaverling \r\n  did not touch Doe sexually. In late June or early July of 1996, the abuse resumed. \r\n  A few days before Doe left to visit his father for the 4th of July, \r\n  Weaverling asked Doe to babysit his two sons. That night, Doe slept in the living \r\n  room of Weaverling's house. Doe awoke to find a naked Weaverling had pulled \r\n  down Doe's shorts and was performing oral sex on Doe. When Doe asked Weaverling \r\n  to stop, he complied, put on his robe, and walked away. Weaverling's wife and \r\n  children were asleep during the incident. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn late July of 1996, Doe agreed \r\n  to babysit Weaverling's children. Doe fell asleep on the couch in Weaverling's \r\n  living room and woke to find Weaverling performing oral sex on him. This time \r\n  when Doe asked Weaverling to stop, Weaverling stopped, but \"acted like he was \r\n  mad and went back to his room.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDoe was scared to tell anyone what \r\n  his uncle was doing to him. He did not tell anyone about the abuse until a couple \r\n  of weeks after the late July incident of abuse by Weaverling. At that time, \r\n  Doe got in trouble for performing oral sex on his three year old male cousin.(1) \r\n  When Doe's mother asked him why he molested his cousin, Doe said \"because it \r\n  had been done to him . . . he thought it was all right.\" \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDoe remembered Weaverling kept the \r\n  pornographic magazine under his bed, the movie in his dresser, and the photographs \r\n  of his wife in her makeup drawer. With this information, the police obtained \r\n  and executed a search warrant on Weaverling's home. Officers discovered the \r\n  pornographic magazine and an x-rated movie, but did not find nude photographs \r\n  of Weaverling's wife, although she helped in the search for them. Doe identified \r\n  a pornographic magazine police seized from Weaverling's home as the magazine \r\n  Weaverling showed him.  \r\n\r\nWeaverling denied the charges against \r\n  him. He maintained he caught Doe performing oral sex on one of his sons in July \r\n  of 1996, but agreed to not tell anyone if Doe promised not to do it again. Weaverling \r\n  told no one about this incident until the police questioned him regarding Doe's \r\n  allegations. \r\n   \r\nWeaverling was found guilty of all \r\n  charges. He was sentenced to fifteen years for each of the CSC convictions, \r\n  and five years for the dissemination of harmful material to a minor conviction, \r\n  with all sentences running concurrently. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Did the trial court err in admitting \r\n  evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct allegedly committed by Weaverling on \r\n  Doe? \r\n   \r\nII. Did the trial court err in excluding \r\n  the testimony of a defense witness regarding Weaverling's character for truthfulness? \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. Did the trial court err in allowing \r\n  expert witness testimony that it was \"not uncommon\" for past victims of sexual \r\n  abuse to become offenders themselves? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. Evidence of Other \r\n  Bad Acts \r\n   \r\nWeaverling argues the trial court \r\n  erred in admitting evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct allegedly committed \r\n  by Weaverling on Doe. He maintains the evidence does not fall within any of \r\n  the Lyle(2) exceptions to the general \r\n  ban on other bad acts evidence. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGenerally, South Carolina law precludes \r\n  evidence of a defendant's prior crimes or other bad acts to prove the defendant's \r\n  guilt for the crime charged. State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. \r\n  803 (1923). See also Rule 404(b), SCRE (evidence of other crimes, wrongs, \r\n  or acts is not admissible to prove character of person in order to show action \r\n  in conformity therewith). Such evidence is admissible, however, when it tends \r\n  to establish motive, intent, the absence of mistake or accident, a common scheme \r\n  or plan embracing the commission of two or more crimes so related to each other \r\n  that proof of one tends to establish the others, or the identity of the perpetrator. \r\n  State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 480 S.E.2d 77 (1997); Lyle, supra; \r\n  Rule 404(b), SCRE. If not the subject of a conviction, proof of prior bad acts \r\n  must be clear and convincing. State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176, 485 S.E.2d \r\n  913 (1997). \r\n   \r\nIn the case of the common scheme \r\n  or plan exception under Lyle, a close degree of similarity or connection \r\n  between the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is on trial \r\n  is necessary. State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100, 504 S.E.2d 324 (1998). \r\n  The trial judge must balance the probative value of the evidence of other crimes \r\n  or bad acts against its prejudicial effect. State v. Parker, 315 S.C. \r\n  230, 433 S.E.2d 831 (1993). Where the evidence is of such a close similarity \r\n  to the charged offense that the previous act enhances the probative value of \r\n  the evidence so as to overrule the prejudicial effect, it is admissible. State \r\n  v. Raffaldt, 318 S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995). Even if the evidence \r\n  is clear and convincing and falls within a Lyle exception, the judge \r\n  must exclude it if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger \r\n  of unfair prejudice to the defendant. State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, \r\n  514 S.E.2d 578 (1999); State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 \r\n  (1996); Rule 403, SCRE. The decision to admit contested evidence rests within \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge. State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C. 370, \r\n  453 S.E.2d 890 (1995). \r\n   \r\nInitially, we reject the State's \r\n  argument that Weaverling failed to preserve this issue. The State argues Weaverling \r\n  failed to state grounds for the exclusion of the evidence and failed to argue \r\n  the evidence did not fit within an exception to the general rule excluding evidence \r\n  of other bad acts. Weaverling requested the court exclude any evidence of prior \r\n  bad acts. Weaverling did not argue its inadmissibility under any exception to \r\n  Lyle. The court entertained a proffer and argument on the challenged \r\n  testimony's admissibility. Reference to the general rule was sufficient. See \r\n  Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE (requiring only \"a timely objection or motion to strike \r\n  . . . stating the specific ground of objection, if the specific ground [is] \r\n  not apparent from the context.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe find Doe's testimony regarding \r\n  the pattern of sexual abuse he suffered by Weaverling to be quintessential common \r\n  scheme or plan evidence. Evidence of a defendant's prior and subsequent illicit \r\n  sexual activities when closely similar to the charged offense is admissible. \r\n  In State v. Richey, 88 S.C. 239, 70 S.E. 729 (1911), our Supreme Court \r\n  held admissible evidence that a man charged with carnal knowledge of a girl \r\n  under fourteen continued his illicit relationship with the child past her fourteenth \r\n  birthday. The court ruled \"'acts prior and also subsequent to the act charged \r\n  in the indictment, when indicating a continuousness of illicit intercourse, \r\n  are admissible in evidence as showing the relation and mutual disposition of \r\n  the parties.' \" Id. at 242, 70 S.E. at 730. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe common scheme or plan exception \r\n  \"is generally applied in cases involving sexual crimes, where evidence of acts \r\n  prior and subsequent to the act charged in the indictment is held admissible \r\n  as tending to show continued illicit intercourse between the same parties.\" \r\n  State v. Whitener, 228 S.C. 244, 265, 89 S.E.2d 701, 711 (1955). Such \r\n  evidence is admissible when the \"'close similarity of the charged offense and \r\n  the previous act[s] enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule \r\n  the prejudicial effect.' \" State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 \r\n  S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984). In McClellan, the Court addressed the admissibility \r\n  of testimonial evidence of appellant's pattern of sexual attacks against each \r\n  of his three daughters in his trial for criminal sexual conduct against the \r\n  youngest daughter. The Court allowed the youngest daughter to testify the appellant \r\n  had attacked her on previous occasions, even though the appellant was not charged \r\n  for the previous attacks. The Court held the \"prosecutrix's testimony regarding \r\n  prior attacks was admissible under [the common scheme] exception to show the \r\n  continued illicit intercourse forced upon her by Appellant.\" Id. at \r\n  392, 323 S.E.2d at 774. \r\n   \r\nAdditionally, the Court found the \r\n  testimony of the other daughters concerning prior misconduct was admissible. \r\n  The experiences of each of the three daughters paralleled that of her sisters: \r\n  the initial attack occurred around the time each girl reached age twelve; appellant \r\n  entered their bedroom late at night and chose one of them who he would then \r\n  take to his bedroom where she would be forced to submit; he gave to each the \r\n  same explanation for his actions-that he was \"teaching them how to be with their \r\n  husbands\"; and he quoted to each a specific Bible verse during the attacks. \r\n  Id. at 391, 323 S.E.2d at 773. The Court concluded the evidence fell \r\n  squarely within the common scheme or plan exception. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLikewise, in State v. Hallman, \r\n  298 S.C. 172, 379 S.E.2d 115 (1989), our Supreme Court held the trial court \r\n  did not err in admitting evidence of appellant's sexual abuse of three of his \r\n  former foster daughters in his criminal sexual conduct trial for abuse of a \r\n  fourth foster daughter. The challenged evidence included the testimony of two \r\n  sisters who were foster children in the Hallman home for five years. Shortly \r\n  after they were placed in his care, appellant rubbed the girls' bodies outside \r\n  their clothing. He then began digital penetration and forced each girl to rub \r\n  his penis. Another young woman testified that when she lived with appellant \r\n  at the age of four, he forced her to rub his penis on four occasions. The charges \r\n  against the appellant included, but went beyond, the type of acts testified \r\n  to by the other young women. Finding the evidence of the other acts admissible, \r\n  the Court explained the abuse against the victim \"commenced . . . in exactly \r\n  the same manner under similar circumstances\" as the abuse of the other foster \r\n  children. Id. at 175, 379 S.E.2d at 117. The Court determined \"the \r\n  evidence of prior bad acts bears such a close similarity to the offense charged \r\n  in this case that its probative value clearly outweighs its prejudicial effect.\" \r\n  Id. at 175, 379 S.E.2d at 117. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe appellant in State v. Blanton, \r\n  316 S.C. 31, 446 S.E.2d 438 (Ct. App. 1994), claimed the trial court erred in \r\n  admitting the testimony of two females in his trial for criminal sexual conduct \r\n  against his granddaughter. He argued the alleged prior bad acts were not closely \r\n  similar to the charged offense. In their testimony, the females indicated they \r\n  had been sexually molested by appellant at approximately the same age and in \r\n  the same manner as appellant's granddaughter. The Court held: \"In each instance, \r\n  [appellant] took advantage of his relationship with the victim for his sexual \r\n  gratification. The prior acts were sufficiently similar to the charged offense \r\n  to be admissible.\" Id. at 33, 446 S.E.2d at 439. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nMore recently, in State v. Adams, \r\n  332 S.C. 139, 504 S.E.2d 124 (Ct. App. 1998), the trial court's admission of \r\n  appellant's stepdaughter's testimony, detailing eight years of extensive sexual \r\n  abuse which mirrored the charged allegations made by another stepdaughter, was \r\n  upheld under the common scheme or plan exception. The appellant used his relationship \r\n  as stepfather to control both stepdaughters and engaged in similar conduct as \r\n  to each. The Court announced the specifics were so similar \"that proof of one \r\n  tended to prove the other\" and the close similarity of the other bad act evidence \r\n  to the charged offense enhanced the probative value so that it outweighed the \r\n  prejudicial effect. Id. at 143, 504 S.E.2d at 126. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn the case sub judice, \r\n  Weaverling faced charges that he performed fellatio on Doe on three occasions \r\n  and gave Doe a pornographic magazine to look at on one occasion. Evidence of \r\n  these incidents demonstrated: (1) Weaverling initiated the sexual contact by \r\n  pulling down Doe's pants or shorts; (2) he obtained sexual gratification by \r\n  having the child review pornography; (3) beginning when Doe was seven or eight \r\n  years old, almost every time they saw one another, Weaverling would get Doe \r\n  alone, pull down Doe's pants, and perform oral sex on Doe; and (4) Weaverling \r\n  would have Doe look at a pornographic magazine or movie during the sexual assaults. \r\n  The challenged testimonial evidence of Weaverling's prior bad acts shows the \r\n  same illicit conduct with the same victim under similar circumstances over a \r\n  period of several years. The probative value of the evidence regarding Weaverling's \r\n  prior bad acts clearly outweighs the prejudicial effect of admitting the evidence. \r\n  As the Court concluded in State v. McClellan, 283 S.C. 389, 392, 323 \r\n  S.E.2d 772, 774 (1984), \"[i]t would be difficult to conceive of a common scheme \r\n  or plan more within the plain meaning of the exception than that presented by \r\n  this evidence.\" \r\n   \r\nMoreover, the State introduced, without \r\n  objection, Doe's statement to the police. The statement contained the same information \r\n  as the challenged testimony and included more details. Weaverling does not appeal \r\n  the admission of Doe's statement. Doe's testimony is cumulative to this statement. \r\n  The admission of improper evidence is harmless when it is merely cumulative \r\n  to other evidence. State v. Tucker, 320 S.C. 206, 464 S.E.2d 105 (1995). \r\n  See also State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996)(error \r\n  in admission of evidence is harmless where it is cumulative to other evidence \r\n  which was properly admitted). Therefore, if there was error, it was harmless. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. Evidence of Character \r\n  for Truthfulness \r\n   \r\nNext, Weaverling asserts the trial \r\n  court erroneously excluded testimonial evidence of his character for truthfulness, \r\n  \"such error being harmful in this case where [Weaverling's] credibility was \r\n  critical.\" We disagree. \r\n   \r\nWeaverling presented the testimony \r\n  of John Workman in support of his character for truthfulness. The following \r\n  occurred: \r\n   \r\nQ. And what is [Weaverling's] reputation \r\n  for truthfulness? \r\n   \r\nA. He's always been truthful with \r\n  me. Any of our acquaintances, I don't think you could get any of them to say \r\n  that he would tell you a lie. \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[The State]: Objection to what somebody \r\n  else would say. \r\n   \r\nThe Court: I sustain the objection. \r\n  He doesn't know what other people would say, so disregard that. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ. But based on your dealings, his \r\n  reputation is what? \r\n   \r\nA. Straight-up guy. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe State argues this issue is procedurally \r\n  barred because the court did not strike Workman's original answer, but merely \r\n  sustained the objection. Without addressing the substance of the State's argument, \r\n  we note the court ordered the jury to \"disregard that\" after sustaining the \r\n  State's objection. \r\n   \r\nA defendant does not have an automatic \r\n  right to introduce evidence of his character for truthfulness simply because \r\n  he has testified in his defense. State v. Mizell, 332 S.C. 273, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 1998). Evidence of a defendant's truthful character can \r\n  become admissible when his character for truthfulness has been attacked. Id. \r\n  Otherwise, in order for a defendant's character for truthfulness to be admissible, \r\n  truthfulness must be \"a trait pertinent to the offense charged.\" Mizell, \r\n  332 S.C. at 280, 504 S.E.2d at 342. See also Rule 404(a)(1), SCRE (evidence \r\n  of a person's character or trait of character is not admissible for the purpose \r\n  of proving action in conformity therewith on a particular occasion, except evidence \r\n  of a pertinent trait of character offered by an accused). The reason for this \r\n  rule is that character evidence is, at best, of little probative value. Mizell, \r\n  supra. \r\n   \r\nAlthough Weaverling took the stand, \r\n  the State did not attack his character for truthfulness. Further, evidence of \r\n  Weaverling's truthful character was not admissible as pertinent to the offenses \r\n  with which he was charged. The defendant in Mizell was charged with \r\n  committing a lewd act upon a child and CSC with a minor. The Court found Mizell's \r\n  character for truth and veracity was not a trait pertinent to those offenses. \r\n  Similarly, the evidence Weaverling sought to introduce was not admissible. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nYet, after the court sustained the \r\n  State's objection, Weaverling's counsel rephrased the question and Workman testified \r\n  Weaverling's reputation was that of a \"straight-up guy.\" Thus, despite the court's \r\n  ruling, Weaverling succeeded in introducing the desired evidence. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFurthermore, four other witnesses \r\n  testified to Weaverling's good reputation for truthfulness. Because the jury \r\n  heard considerable testimony about Weaverling's reputation for truthfulness, \r\n  the evidence in question was cumulative and no prejudice resulted from its exclusion. \r\n  State v. Ferguson, 300 S.C. 408, 388 S.E.2d 642 (1990)(any error in \r\n  excluding evidence is harmless where the evidence is cumulative to other evidence \r\n  in the record). \r\n   \r\nIII. Behavioral Evidence \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFinally, Weaverling challenges the \r\n  admission of a social worker's testimony where the social worker never interviewed \r\n  or met Doe, the testimony was irrelevant, and the probative value was clearly \r\n  outweighed by its prejudicial effect. We find the court properly admitted the \r\n  testimony. \r\n   \r\nThe court qualified social worker \r\n  Bonnie Mooney as an expert in the field of victims of sexual abuse. Mooney's \r\n  knowledge of the case was limited to her discussions with the Solicitor's office. \r\n  She never met or interviewed Doe. The following colloquy occurred during the \r\n  State's direct examination of Mooney: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nQ: Ms. Mooney, based on your training \r\n  and experience, is it uncommon for past victims of sexual abuse to become offenders \r\n  themselves? \r\n   \r\nA: That's not uncommon. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel \r\n  asked Mooney: \"Is it common for those that have-that abuse to have been abused?\" \r\n  Mooney responded: \"Yes, that's very common.\" She did not testify specifically \r\n  regarding Doe or the facts of the case. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nInitially, we note Weaverling has \r\n  not challenged Mooney's testimony by claiming the record lacked sufficient evidence \r\n  to support her expert opinion in this case. \"An expert may give an opinion based \r\n  upon personal observations or in answer to a properly framed hypothetical question \r\n  that is based on facts supported by the record.\" State v. Evans, 316 \r\n  S.C. 303, 311, 450 S.E.2d 47, 52 (1994). After a witness has been qualified \r\n  as an expert, any challenge to the adequacy of the expert's knowledge goes to \r\n  the weight of the testimony, rather than to its admissibility. See State \r\n  v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996); State v. Nathari, \r\n  303 S.C. 188, 399 S.E.2d 597 (Ct. App. 1990). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe question of whether to admit \r\n  or exclude testimony of an expert witness is within the discretion of the trial \r\n  court. Von Dohlen, supra. Absent clear abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to an error of law, the trial court's ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal. Creed v. City of Columbia, 310 S.C. 342, 426 S.E.2d 785 \r\n  (1993). \r\n   \r\nHere, the challenged testimony is \r\n  behavioral evidence concerning rape trauma. \"[B]oth expert testimony and behavioral \r\n  evidence are admissible as rape trauma evidence to prove a sexual offense occurred \r\n  where the probative value of such evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.\" \r\n  State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 506, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993). \r\n  Expert testimony concerning common behavioral characteristics of sexual assault \r\n  victims and the range of responses to sexual assault encountered by experts \r\n  is admissible. See Frenzel v. State, 849 P.2d 741 (Wyo. 1993). See \r\n  also State v. Lujan, 967 P.2d 123 (Ariz. 1998)(opinion testimony describing \r\n  behavioral characteristics outside jurors' common experience is permitted as \r\n  long as it meets other admissibility requirements). Such testimony is relevant \r\n  and helpful in explaining to the jury the typical behavior patterns of adolescent \r\n  victims of sexual assault. Frenzel, supra. It assists the \r\n  jury in understanding some of the aspects of the behavior of victims and provides \r\n  insight into the sexually abused child's often strange demeanor. Id. \r\n  See also Lujan, supra (when facts of case raise questions \r\n  of credibility or accuracy that might not be explained by experiences common \r\n  to jurors-like reactions of child victims of sexual abuse-expert testimony on \r\n  general behavioral characteristics of such victims should be admitted). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThere is no requirement the sexual \r\n  assault victim be personally interviewed or examined by the expert before the \r\n  expert can give behavioral evidence testimony. The fact that the expert does \r\n  not personally interview the victim bears on the weight of the behavioral evidence \r\n  not on its admissibility. See Henson v. State, 535 N.E.2d 1189 (Ind. \r\n  1989). Such facts may be brought out by opposing counsel on cross-examination. \r\n  Id. \r\n   \r\nIn the instant case, the evidence \r\n  simply explained the effect of prior molestation on a person's subsequent conduct-- \r\n  that it is \"very common\" for a victim of sexual abuse to become a sexual offender. \r\n  The fact that Doe molested another boy in the same manner he alleged Weaverling \r\n  molested him enhances the probative value of Mooney's testimony such that it \r\n  outweighs the prejudicial effect. The testimony was relevant and was properly \r\n  admitted. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe conclude the trial court did not \r\n  err in admitting evidence of uncharged sexual misconduct allegedly committed \r\n  by Weaverling on Doe. The evidence fell within the Lyle common scheme \r\n  or plan exception. Further, we hold evidence of a defendant's character for \r\n  truthfulness and veracity is admissible under Rule 404(a)(1), SCRE, only \r\n  where (1) truthfulness is \"a trait pertinent to the offense charged\" or (2) \r\n  the defendant's character for truthfulness has been attacked. Finally, the trial \r\n  court properly allowed expert witness testimony that it was \"not uncommon\" for \r\n  past victims of sexual abuse to become offenders themselves. Accordingly, Weaverling's \r\n  convictions are \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED.  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1. \r\nThe cousin Doe admits abusing \r\nis not Weaverling's child. \r\n2. State \r\n  v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThis case arises from the attack \r\n  and robbery of a sixty-four year-old retired, deaf widower (\"Victim\") in his \r\n  home. The State presented testimony that Dixon, her brother, and Bobby Caughman \r\n  decided to go to Victim's house to get money to purchase crack cocaine. A third \r\n  man, Luther Belcher, agreed to drive the group to Victim's house in exchange \r\n  for twenty dollars. They told Belcher that Victim owed one of the men money. \r\n  Dixon provided Belcher with directions to Victim's home.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhen they arrived at Victim's home \r\n  on the evening of January 7, 1997, Dixon went alone to the door. Because of \r\n  their prior relationship, Victim unlocked the door and let Dixon in on sight. \r\n  He then locked the door behind her. Dixon and Victim communicated by writing \r\n  notes. Dixon asked Victim for money as she had done many times before. Victim \r\n  refused to give Dixon money and told her she needed to get a job.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAt some point, Dixon walked over \r\n  to the door, unlocked it, and began talking to someone outside. Belcher, who \r\n  was still seated in the car, testified that he saw Dixon motion to her brother \r\n  and Caughman. Victim then stated that he saw two men enter his home through \r\n  the door. They covered Victim's head, handcuffed his hands behind his back, \r\n  beat him, kicked him and left him lying on the floor. Caughman and Dixon's brother \r\n  then ransacked Victim's home, stealing jewelry, $800 in cash, and checks, before \r\n  fleeing. The two men returned later that evening to steal Victim's truck. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA neighbor heard Victim crying for \r\n  help at 11:00 a.m. the next day. When she found Victim, who had remained lying \r\n  handcuffed on his floor since the assailants left the night before, she called \r\n  the police and emergency services. Emergency personnel transported Victim to \r\n  the hospital. His treating physician considered his condition life-threatening \r\n  because of the significant drop in his body temperature to 91.1oF. \r\n  Victim also received treatment for bruises on his face, scalp, and lower legs. \r\n   \r\n   \r\nDixon was indicted on charges of \r\n  first degree burglary, kidnapping, grand larceny of a motor vehicle, and assault \r\n  and battery with intent to kill. The trial court granted Dixon's motion for \r\n  a directed verdict on the grand larceny charge because the State did not present \r\n  evidence she participated in the theft of Victim's truck. The trial court denied \r\n  her motion for a directed verdict on the other charges including the first degree \r\n  burglary charge. The jury convicted Dixon of first degree burglary, kidnapping, \r\n  and assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe trial court sentenced Dixon to \r\n  concurrent thirty-year terms of imprisonment on the burglary and kidnapping \r\n  convictions, a ten-year consecutive term for assault and battery of a high and \r\n  aggravated nature, and a ten-year concurrent term for violating the terms of \r\n  her parole. Dixon appeals her first degree burglary conviction, arguing the \r\n  trial court erred in denying her motion for a directed verdict.  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn ruling on a motion for a directed \r\n  verdict, the trial court is concerned with the existence of evidence rather \r\n  than with its weight.(1) On appeal from the denial \r\n  of a directed verdict, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State. If any direct evidence or substantial, circumstantial evidence \r\n  tending to prove the accused's guilt exists, we must conclude the trial court \r\n  properly submitted the case to the jury.(2) \r\n  \r\n   \r\nDixon argues that because Victim \r\n  let her in his home on sight, she did not enter without consent, and thus cannot \r\n  be guilty of first degree burglary. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA person commits first degree burglary \r\n  through the non-consensual entry of a dwelling with the intent to commit a crime \r\n  therein if one or more statutorily defined aggravating circumstances are present.(3) \r\n  The phrase \"enters a building without consent\" is defined as \"to enter a building \r\n  by using deception, artifice, trick, or misrepresentation to gain consent to \r\n  enter from the person in lawful possession.\" (4) \r\n   \r\n   \r\nViewing the facts in the light most \r\n  favorable to the State, Dixon gained entry into the victim's house because Victim \r\n  and she were past acquaintances. Dixon, aware of Victim's deafness, knew he \r\n  would allow her entry on sight because he had done so in the past whenever she \r\n  sought money from him. Dixon knew she and Victim communicated through the writing \r\n  of notes, usually done inside the house. Thus, on January 7, 1997, Dixon knew \r\n  if she showed up at Victim's house, she would at least gain entry into the house \r\n  to explain why she was there. Her intentions, however, were not to gain entry \r\n  so she could ask for money as she had done in the past, but to gain entry so \r\n  she could distract Victim long enough to provide access for her co-conspirators \r\n  to rob him. \r\n   \r\nBecause \"entering without consent\" \r\n  is statutorily defined to include entering through deceit, trickery, artifice, \r\n  or misrepresentation, and there was sufficient evidence for a jury to find that \r\n  Dixon did enter through such means, the trial judge properly refused her motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.(5) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONNOR and ANDERSON, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1.
