Bridges,\r\n  278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).Â  As such, an appellate court\r\n  sits to review errors of law only, and we are bound by the trial court's\r\n  factual determinations unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus,\r\n  367 S.C. 41, 48-49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Harris argues the trial court improperly refused to: (1) charge the\r\n  jury on the law of self-defense as requested; (2) charge the jury on the law of\r\n  accident as requested; (3) grant a mistrial when the State allegedly elicited\r\n  improper character evidence testimony; and (4) grant a mistrial based on the\r\n  solicitor's improper closing statements. \r\nI. Jury chargeÂ  \r\nInitially, Harris argues the trial court erred in refusing to\r\n  charge the law of self-defense and accident as requested.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  law to be charged to the jury must be determined by the evidence presented at\r\n  trial.Â  State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 231-32, 625 S.E.2d 239, 245-46\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â  In South Carolina, a trial court is required to charge only\r\n  the current and correct law of this state.Â  Id.Â  A jury charge\r\n  is correct if it contains the correct definition of the law when read as a\r\n  whole.Â  Id.Â  On review, an\r\n  appellate court considers the charge as a whole in view of the evidence and\r\n  issues presented at trial.Â  Id.Â  To warrant reversal, a trial court's\r\n  refusal to give a requested jury charge\r\n  must be erroneous as well as prejudicial to the defendant.Â  Id.Â  Failure\r\n  to give a requested jury instruction is not prejudicial error where the\r\n  instructions given afford the proper test for determining\r\n  issues.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIf the\r\n  charge as a whole is reasonably free from error, isolated portions that might\r\n  be misleading do not constitute reversible error.Â  Id.Â  A trial court's jury charge that is substantially\r\n  correct and covers the law does not require reversal.Â  Id.Â  In charging\r\n  self-defense, the trial court must consider the facts and circumstances of the\r\n  case at bar in order to fashion an appropriate charge.Â  State v. Starnes,\r\n  340 S.C. 312, 322, 531 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2000).\r\nHarris submitted the following specific request: \r\n\r\n  If a defendant is in imminent danger or if defendant's belief that\r\n    he is in imminent danger of death or receiving bodily harm is reasonable, he\r\n    need not wait until actual attack or injury or until force is used by the\r\n    aggressor before exercising the right to use deadly force in self-defense.Â  In\r\n    other words, defendant need not wait until the assailant &quot;gets the drop on\r\n    him&quot; in order to be entitled to use force in self-defense.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial court refused to include the &quot;gets the drop on\r\n  him&quot; language.Â  This language originally arose in State v. Rash,\r\n  182 S.C. 42, 50, 188 S.E.2d 435, 438 (1936) (&quot;[The defendant] doesn't have to wait until his assailant gets the drop\r\n  on him, he has a right to act under the law of self-preservation and prevent\r\n  his assailant getting the drop on him; if it is apparent, or reasonably\r\n  apparent his assailant is taking steps to get the drop on him, he must take\r\n  steps first to prevent such assailant from getting the drop on him.â€).Â  This\r\n  language has been interpreted to mean a defendant does not have to wait until\r\n  actually fired upon to use force to defend his life.Â  State v. Nichols,\r\n  325 S.C. 111, 117-18, 481 S.E.2d 118, 121-22 (1997); see also Starnes,\r\n  340 S.C. at 322, 531 S.E.2d at 913 (holding that once the right to fire in\r\n  self-defense arises, a defendant is not required to wait until his adversary is\r\n  on equal terms or until he has fired or aimed his weapon in order to act).\r\nWith respect to this issue, the trial court charged the jury as\r\n  follows: \r\n\r\n  You may consider the deceased's conduct[,] actions and general\r\n    demeanor immediately before the incident as bearing on the deceased's temper\r\n    and state of mind at the time of the fatal encounter[,] and the defendant\r\n      does not have to show that he was actually in danger.Â  It is enough if the\r\n    defendant believed he was in imminent danger and a reasonably prudent person of\r\n    ordinary firmness and courage would have had the same belief.Â  The defendant\r\n      has the right to act on appearances even though the defendant's beliefs may\r\n      have been mistaken.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe trial court's\r\n  instructions made it clear Harris did not have to wait until he was actually\r\n  under attack in order to employ force to defend his life.Â  The trial court\r\n  informed the jury that Harris had a right to act on appearances even if those\r\n  appearances may have been erroneous.Â  The simple fact that the trial court\r\n  refused to use the &quot;[gets] the drop on him&quot; language does not render\r\n  the charge improper.Â  State v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d\r\n  298, 303 (2002) (&quot;The substance of the law must be charged to the jury,\r\n  not particular verbiage.&quot;).\r\nNext Harris\r\n  contends the trial court erred in refusing to charge the jury on the law of\r\n  accident as requested.Â  We disagree.\r\nHarris submitted\r\n  the following charge:\r\n\r\n  I\r\n    charge you that where the shooting of a human being is the result of accident\r\n    or mischance, no criminal responsibility attaches.Â  If it is shown that the\r\n    shooting was accidental, that it was done while the defendant was engaged in a\r\n    lawful activity, and was not the result of criminal negligence, the shooting\r\n    will be excused.Â  A person is legally entitled to arm himself in self-defense,\r\n    to meet a potential threat, created by the person who was shot or another.Â  If\r\n    you find that the shooting was caused by accident, then you must find the\r\n    defendant not guilty. . . . The burden of proof is not upon the defendant to\r\n    show that the shooting was accidental, but the burden of proof is upon the\r\n    State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that it was intentional.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court charged the law of accident as follows:\r\n\r\n  Now\r\n    ladies and gentlemen, the defense has also raised the defense of accident.Â  An\r\n    act may be excused on the ground of accident if it is shown that the act was\r\n    unintentional; that the defendant was acting lawfully and that due care was\r\n    used by the defendant in the handling of the weapon. . . . [I]f a person is\r\n    lawfully armed in self-defense and the gun accidently discharges, the defense\r\n    of accident would apply.Â  The burden is on the [S]tate to prove beyond a\r\n    reasonable doubt that the act was not an accident but was caused by the\r\n    negligence or carelessness on the part of the defendant in the handling of the\r\n    dangerous instrumentality or by unlawful activity by the defendant.Â  \r\n\r\nIn South Carolina,\r\n  the defense of accident requires showing the harm caused was unintentional, the\r\n  defendant was acting lawfully at the time of the incident, and due care was\r\n  exercised in handling the weapon.Â  State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, 280,\r\n  440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994).Â  \r\nThe trial court set\r\n  out the elements required to satisfy the defense of accident and stated the\r\n  burden was on the State to prove the act was not an accident.Â  The simple fact that the trial court refused to employ\r\n  the language suggested by Harris does not render the charge ineffective.Â  Burkhart,\r\n  350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303 (&quot;The substance of the law must be\r\n  charged to the jury, not particular verbiage.&quot;).\r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  requested charge and the charge given to the jury are identical in substance.Â \r\n  The requested charge and the given charge state: (1) if the defense of accident\r\n  applies then the act giving rise to that defense is excused; (2) in order for\r\n  the defense of accident to apply, it must be shown the shooting was accidental\r\n  while the defendant was engaged in a lawful activity and not be the result of\r\n  negligence; (3) an individual may be lawfully\r\n  armed and if the gun accidently discharges the defense of accident would apply;\r\n  and (4) the burden rests on the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the\r\n  act was not an accident.Â  The suggested charge and the given charge differ only\r\n  in the language employed, while the substances of both are identical; thus, it\r\n  was not error to refuse to give the requested charge.[1]Â  See State v. Clary, 222 S.C. 549, 552, 73 S.E.2d 681, 682 (1952)\r\n  (holding no error in refusing to charge the precise language requested by the\r\n  defendant when the jury is correctly instructed in accord with the requested\r\n  charge).\r\nII. Mistrial \r\nHarris\r\n  next argues the trial court improperly failed to grant a mistrial (1) when the\r\n  State allegedly elicited improper character evidence testimony and (2) based on\r\n  the solicitor's improper closing statements.Â  We disagree. \r\nÂ The\r\n  decision to grant or deny a mistrial is within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial court. State v. Stanley, 365 S.C. 24, 33-34, 615 S.E.2d 455, 460\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The trial court's decision will not be overturned on appeal\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Id.Â The power of the trial court\r\n  to declare a mistrial should be used with the greatest caution under urgent\r\n  circumstances and for very plain and obvious reasons stated on the record by\r\n  the trial court.Â  Id.Â A mistrial should only be\r\n  granted when absolutely necessary, and a defendant must show both error and\r\n  resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  granting of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure that should only be\r\n  taken if an incident is so grievous that the prejudicial effect can be removed\r\nin no other way.Â  Id.\r\nInitially, Harris contends the trial court should have\r\n  declared a mistrial because the State elicited improper character evidence\r\ntestimony from a witness.Â  We disagree. \r\nThe\r\n  testimony in question focuses on one of Gilmore's children who testified at trial.Â \r\n  During cross-examination of this witness, Harris asked numerous questions\r\n  relating to the positive relationship the two enjoyed prior to the shooting.Â \r\n  The following excerpt demonstrates Harris's attempt to convey to the jury the\r\nconstructive relationship he enjoyed with Gilmore and her children. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    I started off asking you some questions\r\n  about [the] relationship [you had] with [Harris] and . . . you agree that for\r\n  some six or seven years it was like a family, correct? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Y'all lived together? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    [Harris] as well as your mom bought you\r\n  clothes? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Took you on trips to New York and Texas\r\n  and Atlanta? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Had a great time on the holidays and on\r\n  birthdays?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    There were a lot of gifts that were not\r\n  only given by your mom to you and your brothers and sisters but also by\r\n  [Harris] correct?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    He was very generous to you, wasn't he? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    And y'all were close together? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    You did a lot of activities together?&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    . . . \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    Did y'all go to church together? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    And without going specifically but\r\n  y'all went to the beach and went to the fair, movies, those kinds of activities\r\n  together, activities that a family would generally get involved in right?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    And [Harris] would come to your school,\r\n  correct?&nbsp; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    And your school related activities?&nbsp; \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    . . . \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q:\r\n    And [Harris] had a big, he had a lot of\r\n  interest in you, not only, when I say you, I'm talking about your sisters and\r\n  your brothers, too? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Q: \r\n    He did a lot of that and your mom was\r\n  working and he would come and do all of these things at school with all of you\r\n  when your mom wasn't there sometimes, correct? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    A:\r\n    Yes. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFollowing this discourse and during re-direct\r\n  examination of the witness the State posed the following question, &quot;Let me\r\n  just ask you about going to church with him . . . . [Harris] hit you, didn't\r\n  he?&quot;Â  Harris immediately objected and subsequently moved for a mistrial.Â \r\n  Rather than grant the mistrial motion, the trial court gave the jury a curative\r\n  instruction.Â  Specifically, the trial court stated, &quot;An objection was\r\n  raised as to any hitting or spanking of the young man that was on the witness\r\n  stand or the other children.Â  I sustained the objection and I ask that you\r\ndisregard the question that was raised by [the State].&quot;Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is well known &quot;[a] curative instruction to disregard incompetent evidence\r\n  and not to consider it during deliberation is deemed to have cured any alleged\r\n  error in its admission.&quot;Â  State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 658, 623\r\n  S.E.2d 122, 130 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  In the present case, the trial court's\r\n  curative instruction explained to the jury they were not allowed to consider\r\n  the question in their deliberations.Â  The trial court specifically instructed\r\n  the jury to disregard the question.Â  Thus, any alleged error was cured.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the record reveals the witness did not answer the question asked by the State.Â \r\n  The State asked the witness whether Harris ever struck him, and before the\r\n  witness could respond, Harris objected.Â  As noted above, a defendant must show\r\n  both error and resulting prejudice in order to be entitled to a mistrial.Â  Stanley,\r\n  365 at 33-34, 615 S.E.2d at 460.Â  Under the facts presented, we fail to see how\r\n  Harris suffered any prejudice in light of the fact the witness did not answer\r\n  the question.Â  \r\nKeeping\r\n  in mind a mistrial should be granted only when absolutely necessary and the\r\n  curative instruction cured any alleged error the trial court made, we find the\r\n  trial court did not commit reversible error in denying the motion for a mistrial.Â Â  \r\nHarris's final argument\r\n  on appeal is the trial court erroneously failed to grant a mistrial when, in\r\n  the closing argument, the State made an improper comment in violation of the\r\n  Golden Rule Argument. \r\nIn its closing\r\n  argument, the State stated:\r\n\r\n  [Harris]\r\n    had to fire twice and [Harris is] not sure when he shot Pierre which hand he\r\n    had the gun in but when he shot accidentally he said, well, I'm right handed.Â \r\n    I had it in here.Â  I think he had it in his coat pocket.Â  So as he's got him,\r\n    got [Harris] running down the stairs.Â  He gets his gun out, ran and shoots\r\n    twice. . . . Now, they can't get around this and if y'all believe this, don't\r\n    leave this jury room, don't leave this jury box and he charges you and just let\r\n    him go right now.Â  Just let him go.Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Golden Rule Argument is one that suggests to the jurors they put themselves in\r\n  the shoes of one of the parties.Â  State v. Rice, 375 S.C. 302, 334, 652\r\n  S.E.2d 409, 425 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  In the criminal arena, such an argument is\r\n  generally improper because it asks the jurors to place themselves in the\r\n  victim's place.Â  Id.Â  Such an argument tends to destroy all sense of\r\n  impartiality of the jurors, and its effect is to arouse passion and prejudice,\r\n  thereby encouraging the jurors to depart from neutrality and to decide the case\r\n  on the basis of personal interest and bias rather than on the evidence.Â  Id.Â  \r\nA\r\n  trial court is vested with broad discretion in dealing with the range and propriety\r\n  of a closing argument.Â  Id.Â  at 315-16, 652 S.E.2d at 415.Â  An appellate\r\n  court will not disturb a trial court's ruling regarding a closing argument\r\n  unless the trial court commits an abuse of discretion.Â  Id.Â  This Court\r\n  must review the argument in the context of the entire record.Â  Id.Â  The relevant\r\n  question is whether the State's comments so infected the trial with unfairness\r\n  as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Id.Â  Once\r\n  the trial court has allowed the argument to stand, the defendant has the burden\r\n  of proving the argument denied him or her a fair determination of guilt or\r\n  innocence. Id.Â  Improper comments during closing arguments do not\r\n  require reversal if the appellant fails to prove he or she did not receive a\r\n  fair trial because of the alleged improper argument.Â  Id.Â  To warrant\r\n  reversal, the appellant bears the burden to prove both abuse of discretion and\r\nresulting prejudice.Â  Â Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of his position, Harris cites State v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 144\r\n  S.E.2d 481 (1965).Â  This case concerned an appeal from a death sentence for\r\n  rape.Â  White, 246 S.C. at 504, 144 S.E.2d at 481.Â  The question on\r\n  appeal was whether the trial court erred in refusing to sustain an objection\r\n  following a portion of an argument made by the State to the jury.Â  Id.Â Â \r\nThe State made the following comments:\r\n\r\n  If a snake would bite you or one of your children,\r\n    would you let him go and bite again?Â  Gentlemen, from the testimony from the\r\n    stand, I have got a lot more respect for a snake than that brute.Â  How would\r\n    you like to see him coming in your bedroom or\r\n    your daughter's bedroom with this butcher knife?Â Â  I don't know whether you\r\n    have got daughters or not, I believe one or two of you are not married.Â  But\r\n    everybody has got a mother.Â  Not everybody, but most everybody has got a\r\n    sister, daughters.Â  Let him go, let him come back to Williamsburg County.Â  Let\r\n    him come in your wife's bedroom or your mother or daughters, any of them, what\r\n    would you do?Â  How, if this young lady was your sister, how would you feel?Â \r\n    How, if she was your wife, how would you feel?Â  How, if she was your daughter,\r\n    God only knows, how would you feel?Â  Gentlemen, she is all of that to\r\n    somebody.Â  She is a daughter, she is a sister, she is a wife.Â  And but for the\r\n    grace of God that could be your sister, your daughter or your wife.Â  And under\r\n    those circumstances, gentlemen, what would you do under the testimony you heard\r\n    from that stand?Â  Mercy to him that shows mercy.Â  Mercy turns her back on the\r\n    unmerciful.\r\n\r\nId. at 504-05, 144 S.E.2d at 481-82. \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court held the argument by\r\n  the State, which asked the jurors to imagine their mothers, wives, sisters, and\r\n  daughters in the place of the victim, was reversible error and ordered a new\r\ntrial.Â  Id. at 507, 144 S.E.2d at 483.\r\nIn\r\n  the present case, reviewing the closing argument in the context of the entire\r\n  record, the State did not make a Golden Rule Argument.Â  Simply put, the State\r\n  did not ask or suggest to the jury that they place themselves in the shoes of\r\n  the victims.Â  Moreover, the comments made by the State in this case do not rise\r\n  to the level of those in White.Â  As such, the trial court did not commit\r\n  reversible error in denying the motion for mistrial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.[2] Â Â \r\nHUFF\r\nand KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Our decision is expressly limited in determining whether\r\n  the given charges conform to law of South Carolina as it relates to\r\n  self-defense and accident.Â Â  We express no opinion on the propriety of the\r\ntrial court's decision to give these charges under the facts presented.Â  Â \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\nto Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4515","title":"Gainey v.

Â \r\nOn December 27, 2004, Wife attempted to acquire a copy\r\n  of the transcript from the July 21, 2004 hearing.Â  On April 15, 2005, after\r\n  receiving no response regarding the transcript, Wife filed a motion to vacate order\r\n  and set aside agreement under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.[3]Â \r\n  The motion was based on alleged fraud on the part of Husband and on the contention\r\n  that Wife was forced to enter into the property and separation agreement.Â  Wife\r\n  further alleged that on the date of the hearing, she was being treated for\r\n  severe depression and was under the influence of medications for mental illness\r\nthat clouded her judgment. \r\nSubsequently, Wife made a second attempt to obtain a\r\n  copy of the transcript but she did not receive the transcript until August 2005.Â \r\n  Thereafter, she filed her first and second amended motions.Â  In her first amended\r\n  motion to vacate order and set aside agreement, Wife asserted that the family\r\n  court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to hear the matter under S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2008) because the parties were still residing together\r\n  at the time the matter was heard,[4] and as such the judgment was void under Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  The second amended\r\n  motion contended that the family court erred when it failed to attempt\r\n  reconciliation of the parties.Â  The family court denied the motions and this\r\nappeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n     Did the family court\r\n  lack subject matter jurisdiction to approve the agreement under S.C. Code Ann.\r\n&sect; 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2008)?\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the family court\r\n  err in failing to vacate the original order under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, where Husband\r\n  allegedly committed fraud upon the court; where Wife's neglect in not having an\r\n  attorney present at the hearing was excusable, and her entry into the agreement\r\nwas allegedly not free and voluntary; and where the agreement was unfair? &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.\r\n    Did the family court\r\nerr in failing to attempt reconciliation of the parties?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;The decision to grant or deny a motion under\r\n  Rule 60(b) is within the sound discretion of the trial court.&quot;Â  Lanier\r\n    v. Lanier, 364 S.C. 211, 215-16, 612 S.E.2d 456, 458 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (citing Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 494, 413 S.E.2d 15, 17\r\n  (1992)).Â  Therefore, the decision can be reversed only if the family court\r\n  abused its discretion.Â  Raby Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 18,\r\n  594 S.E.2d 478, 482 (2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the judge\r\n  issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or the order is based on\r\n  factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  BB &amp; T v.\r\n    Taylor, 369 S.C. 548, 551, 633 S.E.2d 501, 503 (2006) (citing Tri-County\r\n      Ice &amp; Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., 303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779,\r\n782 (1990)).\r\nHowever, as to the family court's findings of fact, the\r\n  appellate court has the authority to find facts in accordance with its own view\r\n  of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Ables v. Gladden, 378 S.C. 558,\r\n  564, 664 S.E.2d 442, 445 (2008).Â  This does not require the appellate court,\r\n  however, to disregard the findings of the family judge, who saw and heard the\r\nwitnesses.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005); Badeaux v. Davis, 337 S.C 195, 202, 522 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 1999). \r\nLAW/ ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  The Court's Jurisdiction\r\nWife contends the family court lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to issue a decree for separate support and maintenance and approve\r\n  the agreement because the parties were not living separate and apart.Â  We\r\n  disagree that subject matter jurisdiction was implicated.Â  Further, we find\r\n  that because this issue was not presented to the family court at the time the\r\n  agreement was approved, any error was not preserved and cannot be raised\r\n  successfully in this collateral attack via a Rule 60, SCRCP motion.Â  Therefore,\r\n  we hold that the family court correctly denied Wife relief under Rule 60(b)(4),\r\n  SCRCP, and we need not reach the propriety of the family court's exercise of\r\nauthority under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2008). \r\nA judgment of a court without subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is void and constitutes grounds for the court to vacate the\r\n  judgment under Rule 60(b)(4).Â  Thomas &amp; Howard Co., Inc. v. T.W. Graham\r\n    &amp; Co., 318 S.C. 286, 291, 457 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1995); Rule 60(b)(4)\r\n  (stating a court may relieve a party from a final judgment if the judgment is\r\n  void).Â  &quot;A void judgment is one\r\n  that, from its inception, is a complete nullity and is without legal effect and\r\n  must be distinguished from one which is merely 'voidable.'&quot;Â  Thomas\r\n    &amp; Howard Co., 318 S.C. at 291, 457 S.E.2d at 343 (1995) (citation\r\nomitted).Â  \r\nHowever, subject matter jurisdiction refers to the\r\n  court's &quot;power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which\r\n  the proceedings in question belong.&quot;Â  Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314\r\n  S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (citations omitted); Great\r\n    Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 83 n.5, 529 S.E.2d 6, 8\r\n  n.5 (2000) (citations omitted); see also State v. Gentry, 363\r\n  S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â  Numerous cases have held that subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction is not implicated when the court possesses the power to hear and\r\n  determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question\r\n  belong.Â  See State v. Campbell, 376 S.C. 212, 656 S.E.2d 371\r\n  (2008); Johnston v. S.C. Dep't of Lab., Licensing, and Reg., S.C. Real\r\n    Estate Appraisers Bd., 365 S.C. 293, 617 S.E.2d 363 (2005); Fryer v. S.C.\r\nL. Enforcement Div., 369 S.C. 395, 631 S.E.2d 918 (2006).Â  \r\nIn the instant case, Wife did not challenge the family\r\n  court's authority under section 20-3-130(G) at the time of the hearing for\r\n  separate support and maintenance, nor did she file a direct appeal from that\r\n  order.Â  Instead, some thirteen months after issuance of the order, Wife\r\n  asserted the family court lacked jurisdiction to approve the agreement in her Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, motion to vacate the judgment.Â \r\n  Wife knew that she and Husband were still living together on the day of the\r\n  hearing; therefore, this issue could have been raised at the hearing, and\r\n  because it does not implicate the family court's subject matter jurisdiction,\r\n  it could not be raised at any time and is unpreserved.Â  See Patterson\r\n    v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding a\r\n  party may not use a post-trial motion to raise an issue that could have been\r\nraised at trial).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the family court correctly denied Wife\r\n  relief under Rule 60(b)(4) and we need\r\n  not reach the issue of whether the family court properly exercised authority\r\nunder section 20-3-130(G). \r\nB. Husband's\r\nFraud \r\nWife asserts that the family court erred in\r\n  denying her motion to vacate because Husband allegedly committed fraud when he\r\n  misrepresented his financial condition, deliberately oppressed Wife, and\r\n  prevented her from having access to her attorney until after the agreement was\r\nsigned.Â  Â \r\nRule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, provides: \r\n\r\n  (b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect;\r\n    Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc. On motion and upon such terms as are\r\n    just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final\r\n    judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n  . . .\r\n  Â (3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of\r\n    an adverse party;\r\n\r\nRule 60(b)(3), SCRCP. (emphasis in original). \r\nIn South Carolina, extrinsic\r\n  fraud is the only type of fraud for which relief may be granted under Rule 60(b)(3),\r\n  SCRCP.Â  Raby Const., L.L.P., 358 S.C. at 20, 594 S.E.2d at 483; Jamison\r\n    v. Ford Motor Co., 373 S.C. 248, 273, 644 S.E.2d 755, 768 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  Extrinsic fraud is &quot;fraud that induces a person not to present a case or\r\n  deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.&quot;Â  Hilton Head Ctr. of\r\n    S.C. v. Public Serv. Commn., 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987).Â  &quot;Relief\r\n  is granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that because the fraud prevented a\r\n  party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there has never been a real contest\r\n  before the court on the subject matter of the action.&quot;Â  Id.Â  On the\r\n  other hand, intrinsic fraud is fraud which was presented and considered at\r\n  trial.Â  Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 431-32, 529 S.E.2d 714, 718 (2000)\r\n  (citing Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App.\r\n  1988)).Â  It is fraud which misleads and induces the court to find in favor of\r\n  the party perpetrating the fraud.Â  Hilton Head Ctr., 294 S.C. at 11, 362\r\nS.E.2d at 177. \r\nÂ The court grants relief for\r\n  extrinsic but not intrinsic fraud on the theory that intrinsic deceptions\r\n  should be discovered during the litigation itself, and to permit such relief would\r\n  undermine the stability of all judgments.Â  Raby Const., L.L.P., 358 S.C.\r\n  at 20, 594 S.E.2d at 483 (citing Mr. G v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. 305, 308, 465\r\n  S.E.2d 101, 103 (Ct. App. 1995)).Â  The essential distinction between intrinsic\r\n  and extrinsic fraud for purposes of relief from judgment is the ability to\r\n  discover the fraud.Â  Ray v. Ray, 374 S.C. 79, 84, 647 S.E.2d 237, 239\r\n(2007). \r\nHere, if Husband did in fact misrepresent\r\n  his financial condition, his actions would constitute intrinsic fraud because the\r\n  deception was the type that would have misled the court in determining the\r\n  issues, and his fraud could have been discovered during the action itself.Â  Such\r\nfraud is not a ground for Rule 60(b)(3) relief.\r\nFurther, Wife is not entitled\r\n  to relief for any alleged fraud or misconduct pursuant to Rule 60(b)(3),\r\n  because the evidence that was presented in her motion to vacate could have been\r\n  discovered during the litigation.Â  &quot;[A] party may not prevail on a Rule\r\n  60(b)(3) motion on the basis of fraud where he or she has access to disputed\r\n  information or has knowledge of inaccuracies in an opponent's representations\r\n  at the time of the alleged misconduct.&quot;Â  Raby Const., L.L.P., 358\r\n  S.C. at 21, 594 S.E.2d at 484; Bowman v. Bowman, 357 S.C. 146, 152, 591\r\n  S.E.2d 654, 657 (Ct. App. 2004) (where a party could have discovered the &quot;new&quot;\r\n  evidence prior to trial, the party is not entitled to relief under Rule\r\n  60(b)(2) or (3)). Â Wife had an attorney assisting her prior to commencement of the\r\n  original action (whom she later released).Â  Her attorney met with Husband's\r\n  accountant to review Husband's business records prior to approval of the\r\n  agreement.Â  In addition, apart from Husband's financial declaration, Wife had\r\n  other financial information in her possession at the time of the hearing.Â  Thus,\r\nshe is not entitled to relief.\r\nWife likens her case to Ray v. Ray, which holds\r\n  that &quot;an act of perjury or concealment of a document coupled with an\r\n  intentional scheme to defraud justifies the setting aside of a judgment\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(b) due to extrinsic fraud.&quot;Â  374 S.C. at 86, 647 S.E.2d at 241.Â  However, we\r\n  distinguish Ray because in that case, Wife concealed assets through an\r\n  unknown third party not subject to discovery and, therefore, engaged in conduct\r\n  or activities outside of the court proceedings which deprived Husband of the\r\n  opportunity to fully exhibit and try his case.Â  Here, Wife had access to inaccuracies\r\n  in Husbandâ€™s representations at the time of the alleged misconduct.\r\nIn addition, Wife failed to offer\r\n  sufficient proof that Husband deliberately oppressed her and that he prevented her\r\n  from having access to her attorney until after the agreement was signed.Â  When\r\n  a party asserts grounds for relief because of fraud, misrepresentation, or\r\n  other misconduct of an adverse party under Rule 60(b)(3), SCRCP, the movant\r\n  must prove her entitlement by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Chewning v.\r\nFord Motor Co., 354 S.C. 72, 86, 579 S.E.2d 605, 612 (2003).Â  \r\nWhile the record clearly\r\n  indicates that Wife did not have an attorney at the time of the hearing, there\r\n  is insufficient evidence that this was a result of Husband's actions.Â  Jones'\r\n  affidavit indicates that while Wife entered into a fee agreement with him in\r\n  April 2004, she instructed him to cease representing her on May 10, 2004.Â  Wife\r\n  returned to see Jones a week later to resume representation.Â  Jones informed\r\n  her that he could not represent her until she signed a copy of the attorney-client\r\n  agreement reaffirming its terms and conditions.Â  Wife never signed the\r\n  agreement and never contacted Jones again prior to the hearing for separate\r\n  support and maintenance.Â  Wife testified at the hearing that she did not want an\r\n  attorney.Â  Wife later testified that Husband instructed her to fire Jones\r\n  because he was giving her bad advice and Husband would not pay Jones any additional\r\n  money.Â  Jones also expressed his opinion that Husband overreached Wife and\r\n  instructed her to fire Jones.Â  However, this is insufficient evidence that\r\n  Husband committed any act of deception that prevented Wife from being\r\nrepresented by an attorney. It does not indicate extrinsic fraud.\r\nC. Duress \r\nWife contends that she was forced to enter the property\r\n  and separation agreement and as such, the court erred in refusing to vacate the\r\n  judgment.Â  We disagree.Â  Wife's argument was properly rejected because Wife\r\n  failed to present sufficient evidence that she was under duress when she\r\nentered into the agreement.\r\nThe central question when determining whether a\r\n  contract was executed under duress is whether, considering all the surrounding\r\n  circumstances, one party to the transaction was prevented from exercising his\r\n  free will by threats or the wrongful conduct of another.[5]Â \r\n  17A Am.Jur.2d Contracts Â§ 218 (2004).Â  Freedom of will is fundamental to\r\n  the validity of an agreement.Â  Id.Â  A party claiming duress can prevail\r\n  if she shows that she has been the victim of a wrongful act or threat that\r\n  deprives her of free will, with the result that she was compelled to make a\r\ndisproportionate exchange of values. Â Id.\r\nThree factors must be proved in order to establish\r\n  that a contract was procured through duress: (1) that the person was coerced to\r\n  enter into the contract; (2) that the person was put in such fear that he was\r\n  bereft of the quality of mind essential to the making of a contract; and (3)\r\n  that the contract was thereby obtained as a result of this state of mind.Â  In\r\n    re Nightingale's Estate, 182 S.C. 527, 527, 189 S.E. 890, 897 (1937).Â  If a\r\n  party's manifestation of assent is induced by an improper threat by the other\r\n  party that leaves the victim no reasonable alternative, the contract is\r\n  voidable by the victim.Â  Willms Trucking Co., Inc. v. JW Constr. Co. Inc.,\r\n  314 S.C. 170, 179, 442 S.E.2d 197, 202 (Ct. App. 1994).Â  Whether duress exists\r\n  in a particular case is a question of fact to be determined according to the\r\n  circumstances of each case, such as the age, sex, and capacity of the party\r\n  influenced.Â  See Santee Portland Cement Corp. v. Mid-State Redi-Mix\r\n    Concrete Co., 273 S.C. 784, 786, 260 S.E.2d 178, 179 (1979) (stating\r\n  whether or not duress was present is a question ordinarily determined on a\r\ncase-by-case basis).\r\nIn Forsythe v. Forsythe, the court found no\r\n  evidence that the agreement was not freely and voluntarily entered into where,\r\n  upon being questioned by the trial judge, the wife answered affirmatively that\r\n  she understood the agreement, had entered into it of her own free will and\r\n  accord, was not under duress or fear, and was satisfied with the services of\r\n  her attorney.Â  Forsythe v. Forsythe, 290 S.C. 253, 255-56, 349 S.E.2d\r\n  405, 406 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Likewise, in Burnett v. Burnett, the court concluded\r\n  that the Wife freely and voluntarily entered into a separation agreement where\r\n  there was no evidence that Wife was compelled to enter into the agreement as a\r\n  result of being overreached or subjected to any duress, &quot;nor was there any\r\n  evidence that she was not of sound mind or under any unusual stress, other than\r\n  the stress normally attendant to the breakup of a marriage.&quot;Â  Burnett\r\n    v. Burnett, 290 S.C. 28, 30, 347 S.E.2d 908, 909 (Ct. App. 1986); see\r\n      also Sauls v. Sauls, 287 S.C. 297, 300, 337 S.E.2d 893, 895 (Ct. App.\r\n  1985) (&quot;Based on the evidence here, we find the agreement was freely and\r\n  voluntarily entered into by Mr. and Mrs. Sauls.Â  Both parties had the benefit\r\nof legal advice before signing it.&quot;). Â \r\nIn the present case, Wife asserts, as the grounds for\r\n  her allegation of duress, mental abuse by Husband, his refusal to vacate the\r\n  marital home until the agreement was signed and approved, and his complete\r\n  control over Wife's access to legal representation.Â  However, Wife fails to\r\n  demonstrate specific instances of mental abuse that influenced her state of\r\n  mind to such an extent that she could not exercise her free will.Â  There is no\r\n  evidence that Husband made any improper threat to Wife that left Wife with no\r\n  reasonable alternative.Â  Nor is there sufficient evidence that Wife was under\r\n  any unusual stress, other than the stress normally attendant to the breakup of\r\n  a marriage.Â  Wife simply has not shown sufficient facts to support her\r\n  contention that she was coerced to enter into the property and settlement\r\n  agreement.Â  Indeed, Wife testified that she read every line of the agreement\r\n  and understood it and was not under stress or pressure to sign the agreement.Â  Thus,\r\n  the family court did not err in denying Wife's motion to vacate on the ground\r\nof duress.\r\nD. Wife's Excusable\r\nNeglect \r\n Wife asserts that the family court erred in denying her\r\n  motion to vacate, because her neglect in not having an attorney present at the\r\n  hearing for approval of the agreement was excusable.Â  She contends that she was\r\n  living under extreme duress and also suffered from a medical condition that\r\nprevented her from making decisions on her own at the time.Â  We disagree. \r\nRule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, authorizes the trial court to relieve a\r\n  party from a final judgment where the party demonstrates &quot;mistake,\r\n  inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect . . . .&quot;Â  The decision to\r\n  grant or deny a motion to set aside a judgment for excusable neglect lies\r\n  within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  RRR, Inc. v. Toggas,\r\n378 S.C. 174, 180, 662 S.E.2d 438, 441 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  \r\nThe evidence presented to the family court was insufficient\r\n  to support Wife's contention of excusable neglect.Â  The only evidence of Wife's\r\n  medical condition is a letter from her internist, who had treated Wife for\r\n  depression.Â  However, there is no evidence that Wife was being treated at the\r\n  time of the hearing for separate support and maintenance or at the time she\r\n  entered into the property and settlement agreement.Â  In fact, the internist's\r\n  letter reports that Wife had not received any treatment from about April 2004 to\r\n  September 2004.Â  There is no evidence that Wife was being treated for\r\n  depression in July 2004, no evidence of any medications taken by Wife during\r\n  that period, and no evidence of any medical condition that adversely affected\r\n  her ability to make decisions at the time she executed the agreement.Â  Further,\r\n  the family court, which had the opportunity to observe Wife's demeanor at the\r\n  July 2004 hearing, found no indication that she was emotionally distraught or\r\nthat her judgment was clouded.Â  \r\nMoreover, the family court questioned Wife extensively about\r\n  the agreement, and she indicated that she entered into the agreement without\r\n  any coercion, and the stress of the situation did not make her feel as if she\r\n  had no choice but to sign the agreement.Â  She also stated that she was not\r\n  under the influence of any drugs or medications that may have affected her\r\n  judgment when the parties negotiated the agreement or at the hearing.Â  The\r\n  family court stated, in reference to Wife's demeanor during the hearing: &quot;I\r\n  find her to be most attentive in answering my questions.Â  She is engaged in the\r\nprocess . . . .&quot; \r\nThus, there was no abuse of discretion and the family\r\n  court correctly denied Wife's request to vacate the judgment on the ground of\r\nexcusable neglect.\r\nE. Unfairness of the Agreement\r\nWife asserts that the agreement was procedurally and\r\n  substantively unfair to her because she was unrepresented by an attorney, and\r\n  the property division was more favorable to her husband. Â She contends that for\r\n  those reasons, the family court erred in refusing to vacate the judgment.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â  Wife's argument was properly rejected because lack of fairness is\r\nnot a ground for relief under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  \r\nF. Failure of the Court to Attempt Reconciliation\r\nof the Parties\r\nWife asserts that because the family court did not attempt\r\n  reconciliation at the hearing, the judgment was void pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4),\r\nSCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen interpreting the language of a statute the court should\r\n  give words their plain and ordinary meaning, without resorting to subtle or\r\n  forced construction to limit or expand the statute's operation.Â  Sloan v.\r\n    S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 370 S.C. 452, 469, 636 S.E.2d 598,\r\n  607 (2006).Â  Here, clearly, the reconciliation requirement in S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-90 (1976) is required only in divorce actions.Â  No other meaning can be\r\nderived from a plain reading of the statute: \r\n\r\n  In all cases referred to a master or special referee,\r\n    such master or special referee shall, except in default cases, summon the party\r\n    or parties within the jurisdiction of the court before him and shall in all\r\n    cases make an earnest effort to bring about a reconciliation between the\r\n    parties if they appear before him. No judgment of divorce shall be granted in\r\n    such case unless the master or special referee to whom such cause may have been\r\n    referred shall certify in his report or, if the cause has not been referred,\r\n    unless the trial judge shall state in the decree that he has attempted to\r\n    reconcile the parties to such action and that such efforts were unavailing.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-90 (1976). Â \r\nIn view of the fact that the\r\n  July 21, 2004 hearing was for the issuance of a decree of separate support and maintenance,\r\n  and not one for divorce, the family court was not required to inquire into the\r\npossibility of reconciliation, and failure to do so did not void the order. \r\nWife also cites S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-850 as\r\n  authority for the proposition that a reconciliation inquiry is required.Â  However,\r\n  that statute applies to child support actions. Â This was an action for separate\r\n  support and maintenance, and therefore, it was not necessary that the family court\r\ninquire into reconciliation. Â Consequently, no error occurred. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the family court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., HUFF, J., and GEATHERS, J.,\r\nconcur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Jones' affidavit dated January 12, 2005 was\r\n  filed with the family court in support of Wifeâ€™s motion to vacate order and set\r\naside agreement. \r\n[2] The agreement resolved all issues except for the divorce, which was granted\r\nat a later date.Â  \r\n[3] Wifeâ€™s motion to vacate was filed within the\r\none-year time period specified in Rule 60(b), SCRCP.\r\n[4] Husband did not vacate the marital home until\r\nthe day of the hearing.Â  \r\n[5] In South Carolina jurisprudence, marital\r\n  settlement agreements are viewed as contracts.Â  Harris-Jenkins v.

Halcomb (Halcomb) was found guilty of the murder\r\n  of Jonathan &quot;Jon Jon&quot; Love (Love).Â  Halcomb asserts the trial court\r\n  erred when it denied his motion for severance of trial and when it refused to\r\n  admit certain evidence that allegedly demonstrated codefendant Cottrell's personal\r\nmotive for murdering Love.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAfter Halcomb and Cottrell were indicted for Love's\r\n  murder, Halcomb made a pretrial motion for severance of trial that was denied. Subsequently, Halcomb and Cottrell were convicted under the &quot;hand of one is the hand\r\n  of all&quot; theory of accomplice liability.[1]Â  The State asserted that Halcomb and Cottrell killed Love when Love, working\r\n  at their command, botched an intended arson of reputed drug dealer Brett Smalls'\r\n  (Smalls) house.Â  The State then alleged that Halcomb and Cottrell sought to\r\n  burn down Smalls' residence because Smalls and his comrades demanded payment\r\nfor marijuana that Halcomb and Cottrell stole from Smalls.Â  \r\nThe evidence presented at trial was predominantly\r\n  testimonial.Â  Halcomb's girlfriend, Diane Lawson (Lawson), testified that\r\n  Halcomb directed Love to commit arson.Â  When Halcomb discovered that the arson\r\n  attempt had failed, he conspired with Cottrell to kill Love because he believed\r\n  that Love had become a liability.Â  In fact, the State theorized that in\r\n  this particular instance, Halcomb exercised control over Cottrell and ordered\r\nhim to kill Love.Â  \r\nOn the night of the murder, Halcomb,\r\n  Cottrell, Love, and Lawson went to a wooded location in Marion County, and Halcomb\r\n  directed Cottrell and Love to dig a hole.Â  Halcomb had instructed Lawson, who\r\n  stayed in the car, to monitor the surroundings for approaching vehicles and to\r\nwarn Halcomb of nearing vehicles by turning on the headlights of their\r\n  car.Â  At one point during the digging, Halcomb took the shovel and showed the\r\n  parties how to &quot;corner off&quot; the hole.Â  Moments later, Halcomb\r\nreturned to the car. \r\nLater, Cottrell and Love stopped digging and\r\n  returned to the car for a smoke break, and it was at that time that Halcomb surreptitiously\r\n  handed a gun to Cottrell.Â  All three men then returned to the woods to finish\r\nthe digging.Â  \r\nSubsequently, Lawson heard several gunshots\r\n  coming from where the parties were digging.Â  Moments later, Halcomb returned to\r\n  the car and asked Lawson whether she had heard anything.Â  She replied that she\r\n  had, and Halcomb went back to the hole and did not return for an hour.Â  When\r\n  Halcomb and Cottrell reappeared, Love did not accompany them. Â Â After they\r\n  returned to the house, Halcomb told Lawson that he and Cottrell &quot;had to go\r\n  get rid of the evidence.&quot;Â  Cottrell later joked about the &quot;smoke&quot;\r\n  coming from Love's head &quot;like a mushroom cloud&quot; after he was shot.Â  Halcomb\r\n  also quipped about the fact that Love was still gurgling when they buried him.Â \r\n  Cottrell indicated to another witness that he was disgusted when he killed Love\r\n  because Love had &quot;used the bathroom on himself.&quot; The pathologist\r\n  testified that Love had received four gunshot wounds, two of which proved\r\nfatal.Â  \r\nFurther, Amber Counts (Counts), one of\r\n  Cottrell's girlfriends at the time, stated to law enforcement that while she\r\n  and Cottrell were separately incarcerated, Cottrell allegedly wrote her a\r\n  letter in which he stated that &quot;J.J. had tried to sexually assault\r\n  Cottrell's girlfriend and that J.J. would never hurt anyone again.&quot;Â  Apparently, the alleged letter did not indicate the\r\n  identity of J.J., but Halcomb asserted that those are the initials for Jon Jon,\r\n  a nickname for Love.Â  Law enforcement testified that\r\n  they never received the letter and that Counts stated that she had destroyed\r\n  the letter.Â  The only evidence of the existence of the letter or its contents was\r\n  Counts' statements.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits\r\n  to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545\r\n  S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001); State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383, 388, 577 S.E.2d\r\n  498, 500 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The appellate court is limited to determining\r\n  whether the trial court abused its discretion.Â  State v. Reed, 332 S.C.\r\n  35, 43, 503 S.E.2d 747, 751 (1998); State v. Bowie, 360 S.C. 210, 216, 600\r\n  S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial\r\n  court's ruling is based on an error of law.Â  State v. Foster, 354 S.C.\r\n  614, 621, 582 S.E.2d 426, 429 (2003); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 378,\r\n580 S.E.2d 785, 793-94 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nThis Court does not reassess the facts\r\n  based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply\r\n  determines whether the trial court's ruling is supported by any evidence.Â  Wilson,\r\n  345 S.C. at 6, 545 S.E.2d at 829; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 583, 575\r\n  S.E.2d 852, 855 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Furthermore, this Court is bound by the trial\r\n  court's factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v.\r\n    Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000); State v.\r\nLandis, 362 S.C. 97, 101, 606 S.E.2d 503, 505 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nISSUES ON\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  trial court err in refusing to grant a severance of trial when a joint trial\r\n  was allegedly prejudicial to Halcomb because the exclusion of certain evidence\r\nhindered his ability to present a defense?&nbsp; \r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the\r\n  trial court err in excluding evidence of Cottrell's letter to Counts in which\r\n  Cottrell allegedly revealed a personal motive for murdering Love that would\r\nhave exculpated Halcomb?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Severance of Trial\r\nHalcomb contends the trial court erred in\r\n  refusing to grant him a separate trial.Â  Halcomb maintains that the joint trial\r\n  was prejudicial to him because it limited his ability to present evidence (1) that\r\n  could have rebutted the State's theory that Halcomb controlled Cottrell, and (2)\r\n  of Cottrell's letter to Counts that revealed Cottrell's personal motive for\r\nmurder.Â  We find no error.\r\nCriminal defendants who are jointly tried\r\n  for murder are not entitled to separate trials as a matter of right.Â  State\r\n    v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 73, 502 S.E.2d 63, 75 (1998); State v. Garrett,\r\n  350 S.C. 613, 620, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A motion for severance\r\n  is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  State v. Harris,\r\n  351 S.C. 643, 652, 572 S.E.2d 267, 272 (2002); State v. Walker, 366 S.C.\r\n  643, 656, 623 S.E.2d 122, 128 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The trial court's ruling will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Harris,\r\n  351 S.C. at 652, 572 S.E.2d at 272; State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 164,\r\n  478 S.E.2d 260, 265 (1996).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial court's\r\n  decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  Walker,\r\n  366 S.C. at 656, 623 S.E.2d at 129; State v. Lopez, 352 S.C. 373, 378, 574\r\nS.E.2d 210, 212 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThere is no clearly defined rule for\r\n  determining when a defendant is entitled to a separate trial, because the\r\n  exercise of discretion means that the decision must be based upon a just and\r\n  proper consideration of the particular circumstances which are presented to the\r\n  court in each case.Â  State v. McIntire, 221 S.C. 504, 504, 71 S.E.2d 410,\r\n  415 (1952); State v. Avery, 374 S.C. 524, 533, 649 S.E.2d 102, 107 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007); State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 624, 535 S.E.2d 449, 452\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000), aff'd, 351 S.C. 635, 572 S.E.2d 263 (2002).Â  A\r\n  severance should be granted only when there is a serious risk that a joint\r\n  trial would compromise a specific trial right of a codefendant or prevent the\r\n  jury from making a reliable judgment about a codefendant's guilt.

Â Dennis, 337 S.C. at 281, 523\r\n  S.E.2d at 176; State v. Smith, 359 S.C. 481, 489-90, 597 S.E.2d 888, 893\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  A proper cautionary instruction may help protect the individual\r\n  rights of each defendant and ensure that no prejudice results from a joint\r\ntrial.Â  Hughes, 346 S.C. at 559, 552 S.E.2d at 317.\r\nIn the instant matter, the trial court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in denying Halcomb's pretrial motion to sever the joint trial\r\n  because the court's decision was based upon a just and proper consideration of\r\n  the circumstances in this case.Â  The trial court carefully considered\r\n  whether any harm would result to either defendant as\r\n  a result of a joint trial.Â  In addition, the trial court noted that there were\r\n  valid administrative and judicial economy reasons for denying the motion to\r\nsever.Â  \r\nHalcomb asserts he should have been\r\n  granted a separate trial so he could present evidence that Cottrell acted\r\n  independently of him when he killed a police officer ten days after Love's\r\n  murder.Â  According to Halcomb, such evidence is relevant because it would rebut\r\n  the State's theory that Halcomb controlled Cottrell.Â  However, the trial court correctly found that evidence\r\n  of Cottrell's subsequent crime would not have been admissible even if Halcomb\r\n  was tried separately.Â  The trial court's assessment regarding the evidence was\r\n  correct because it is not evident that such evidence would have been relevant.Â  Further, the State's theory was not that Halcomb\r\n  controlled Cottrell at all times but only that he controlled him during the act\r\n  of killing Love.Â  Thus, evidence of the subsequent police killing, which was a completely\r\n  separate incident from Love's murder, was not competent evidence to rebut the\r\nState's theory.[2]Â  \r\nIn addition, Halcomb contends that a\r\n  separate trial would have enabled him to introduce evidence of Cottrell's\r\n  letter to Counts, which would have indicated that Cottrell had his own personal\r\n  motive for killing Love, and that this evidence would have exculpated Halcomb.Â \r\n  However, the record fails to indicate that evidence of the letter would have exculpated\r\nHalcomb. \r\nFurther, Halcomb has not demonstrated that\r\n  he was prejudiced by the joint trial and that he would have obtained a more favorable\r\n  result in a separate trial.Â  The evidence presented against Halcomb was\r\n  overwhelming.Â  The State alleged that both defendants participated in the\r\n  murder of Love and there was overwhelming evidence that Halcomb and Cottrell\r\n  conspired to kill Love.Â  Although Cottrell actually pulled the trigger, there\r\n  was evidence that he was acting under the command of and in concert with\r\n  Halcomb.Â  Halcomb was present at the scene of the murder and aided, abetted,\r\n  and encouraged Cottrell in digging the burial hole.Â  Halcomb provided the\r\n  murder weapon for Cottrell to shoot Love.Â  After Cottrell shot Love, Halcomb\r\n  helped him bury Love alive.Â  Upon leaving the scene of the murder, Halcomb\r\n  helped Cottrell &quot;get rid of the evidence.&quot;Â  Halcomb admitted to\r\nwitnesses that he and Cottrell killed Love.Â  \r\nMoreover, to guarantee that there would be\r\n  no prejudice to either defendant as a result of the joint trial, the trial\r\ncourt explicitly instructed the jury as follows:\r\n\r\n  I will talk with you a little bit further\r\n    about the fact that these are two individuals charge[d] separately.Â  And you\r\n    must consider that separately and render your determinations separately with\r\n    regard to these cases. . . . Now, you must consider each charge separately and\r\n    you must decide separately whether each individual defendant is guilty or not\r\n    guilty of the charges alleged in the indictment against that particular\r\n    individual.Â  It's your duty to give such consideration to each individual\r\n    defendant on those separate charges alleged in those separate indictments.Â  And\r\n    you must therefore consider separately the evidence and the law for each\r\n    individual defendant for each of the charges and write your verdict\r\n    accordingly.Â  Please do not forget that at any point during the proceeding. \r\n\r\nThe trial court's cautionary instruction, which is similar\r\n  to that approved by the South Carolina Supreme Court in Castineira, 341\r\n  S.C. at 624, 535 S.E.2d at 452, helped protect Halcomb's rights and ensured\r\nthat no prejudice resulted from the joint trial with Cottrell.[3]Â  \r\nBecause the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion and Halcomb has not shown that he was prejudiced by the joint trial\r\n  and that there was a reasonable probability that he could have obtained a more\r\n  favorable result had he been tried separately, we affirm the trial court on\r\nthis issue.Â  \r\nB. Exclusion of EvidenceÂ  \r\nHalcomb asserts the trial court erred in\r\n  refusing to admit evidence of codefendant Cottrell's letter to Counts in which Cottrell allegedly\r\n  revealed a personal motive to murder Love.Â  We agree but conclude that the\r\nerror is harmless.Â  \r\nIn general, rulings on the admissibility\r\n  of evidence are within the trial court's sound discretion and will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion resulting in prejudice\r\n  to the complaining party.Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  262, 265 (2006).Â  In particular, the question of whether to admit evidence\r\n  under the &quot;best evidence rule&quot; is also addressed to the discretion of\r\n  the trial court.Â  Wayne Smith Constr. Co., Inc. v. Wolman, Duberstein, &amp;\r\n    Thompson, 294 S.C. 140, 146, 363 S.E.2d 115, 118 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  The preliminary inquiry into whether there has been\r\n  sufficient evidence to prove loss, destruction or unavailability of an original\r\n  document so as to justify the admission of secondary evidence is an inquiry, the\r\n  answer to which is largely within the discretion of the trial court.Â  Windham\r\n    v. Lloyd, 253 S.C. 568, 573, 172 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1970).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\n  the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error\r\n  of law.Â  State v.\r\n    McDonald, 343 S.C. 319,\r\n  325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).Â  Further, for an error of law to warrant reversal\r\n  based on exclusion of evidence, the appellant must prove the error of the\r\n  ruling and the resulting prejudice, i.e., that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability the verdict was influenced by the lack of the evidence.Â  Fields\r\nv. Reg'l Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 26, 609 S.E.2d 506, 509 (2005); State v. Gault, 375 S.C. 570, 574, 654 S.E.2d 98, 100 (Ct. App. 2007). \r\nHere, the trial court excluded evidence of\r\n  the letter finding that it was unreliable and inadmissible under the best evidence\r\n  rule â€” Rules 1001 to 1004, SCRE.[4]Â \r\n  Rule 1002, SCRE, provides: &quot;To prove the content of a writing, recording,\r\n  or photograph, the original writing, recording, or photograph is required,\r\n  except as otherwise provided in these rules or by statute.&quot;Â  Further, Rule\r\n  1004, SCRE, states in relevant part: &quot;The\r\n  original is not required, and other evidence of the contents of a writing,\r\n  recording, or photograph is admissible ifâ€”[] All originals are lost or have\r\nbeen destroyed, unless the proponent lost or destroyed them in bad faith.&quot;\r\nThe trial court erred in excluding\r\n  evidence of Cottrell's letter to Counts under the best evidence rule.[5]Â  The record does not reveal that the original\r\n  letter was destroyed through any bad faith of the proponent; thus, there was no basis\r\nfor excluding Counts' statements about the letter under the best evidence rule.[6]Â  \r\nHowever, even though\r\n  the evidence was erroneously excluded, its exclusion affords no basis for\r\n  reversal because Halcomb has not proved any resulting prejudice, i.e., that\r\n  there was a reasonable probability that the verdict was influenced by the lack\r\n  of the evidence.Â  See Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.Â \r\n  As mentioned above, there was overwhelming evidence to indicate that both\r\n  parties were accomplices in the murder of Love, regardless of what their individual\r\n  motives might have been, and thus, admission of evidence of the letter would\r\nnot have changed the outcome of the trial.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\nthe trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWILLIAMS and PIEPER, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n[1] Under the &quot;hand of one is the hand of all&quot;\r\n  theory of accomplice liability, one who joins with another to accomplish an\r\n  illegal purpose is criminally liable for everything done by his accomplice\r\n  incidental to the common design or purpose.Â  State v. Condrey, 349 S.C.\r\n184, 194, 562 S.E.2d 320, 324 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\n2 Halcomb's\r\n  argument regarding his cooperation with the police about Cottrellâ€™s killing of\r\n  the police officer is abandoned on appeal because it was not argued in his\r\n  brief. Â See First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 363, 444\r\n  S.E.2d 513, 514 (1994) (issues not argued in the brief are deemed abandoned and\r\n  will not be considered on appeal); Ellie, Inc. v. Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78,\r\n  99, 594 S.E.2d 485, 496 (Ct. App. 2004) (where an issue is not argued within\r\nthe body of the brief, it is abandoned on appeal).Â  \r\n[3] In Castineira, the defendant argued on appeal\r\n  that the trial court erred in denying his motion for severance.Â  The trial\r\n  court instructed the jury on the juryâ€™s responsibility when considering the\r\n  evidence, &quot;Now, you are to consider each case separately and write a\r\n  verdict differently in each case. You may find all the defendants not guilty,\r\n  one of the defendants guilty and the rest not guilty, or some guilty and not\r\n  guilty. You are to consider each one separately and determine whether or not\r\n  the State of South Carolina has proven a defendant guilty of this conspiracy\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;Â  Id. The Court found that this jury\r\n  instruction was sufficient to cure any prejudice that might result from a joint\r\ntrial. \r\n[4] Contrary to Halcomb's assertion, the trial court did\r\n  not exclude the evidence because of Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S.\r\n  123 (1968) implications.Â  In Bruton, the Supreme Court held that admission\r\n  of a codefendant's confession that implicated the defendant at a joint trial\r\n  constituted prejudicial error, even though the trial court gave a clear,\r\n  concise and understandable instruction that the confession could only be used\r\n  against the codefendant and must be disregarded with respect to the defendant.Â \r\n  In fact, the record in the instant matter indicates that the trial court based\r\n  its decision to exclude the evidence on the best evidence rule:Â  &quot;[T]he\r\n  court has determined that that letter or that statement is inadmissible under\r\n  the best evidence rule which is Rule 1001.Â  Simply finding that it really is\r\n  not reliable to say that someone said something in a letter which is now lost\r\nor destroyed[,] unavailable[,] [and] never seen by counsel.&quot;Â  \r\n[5] The trial court did not indicate any other ground for\r\n  exclusion of the letter apart from the best evidence rule, nor did the\r\ndefendant object on any other grounds.\r\n[6] Interestingly, in State v. Head, 38 S.C. 258, 258, 16 S.E. 892, 893 (1893), the\r\n  Supreme Court addressed an evidentiary scenario regarding the admissibility of\r\n  documentary evidence that is similar to that in the instant matter.Â  While in\r\n  jail, a prisoner wrote a letter to Nancy Love and gave the letter to another\r\n  person, Mary Praylor, with directions to deliver the letter to Nancy.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The trial court allowed Mary to testify about the contents of the letter and that\r\n  Mary gave the letter to Nancy, who opened it, and then asked Mary to read it. As\r\n  soon as Mary read the letter, Nancy put it in the fire where it burned.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Court found that the trial court did not err when it admitted Mary's statements\r\nconcerning the contents of the letter.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4517","title":"Campbell v.

Chase, of\r\n          Florence and Sarah Patrick Spruill, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGEATHERS, J.: Donald\r\n  Campbell (&quot;Donald&quot;) instituted this partition action against his two\r\n  siblings, Mary Alice Richardson and Harvey Campbell, and his two nieces, Wendy\r\n  Jordan and Elizabeth Langley (&quot;the nieces&quot;).Â  After ruling that an in\r\n  kind partition was appropriate, the special referee ordered that the real\r\n  property be surveyed and subdivided.Â  On appeal, the nieces claim the special\r\n  referee erred in refusing to consider their emotional attachment to the\r\n  property awarded to Donald, in refusing to strike certain testimony from the\r\n  record, and in ordering the nieces' mother, Betty Jean (&quot;Betty\r\nJean&quot;), to remove her mobile home from Donald's property.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe\r\n  subject property in this appeal consists of four parcels of land in Darlington\r\n  and Florence Counties.Â  The title to the property passed from Donald's father, the\r\n  late Mr. Melvin Campbell Sr., to his widow and their six children[1] upon his death on October 18, 1980.Â  At this time, the children deeded the\r\n  property to their mother for life, while retaining their respective remainder\r\n  interests upon her death. Â Mrs. Campbell later died intestate and her\r\n  interest passed to her children in equal shares.Â  Through a series of\r\n  transfers, the property was owned in the following percentages when Donald\r\n  instituted this partition action: Mary Alice Richardson, 11/36; Harvey\r\n  Campbell, 11/36; Donald Campbell, 8/36; Wendy Jordan, 3/36; and Elizabeth\r\nLangley, 3/36.[2]\r\nThree of the four parcels are unoccupied farmland. The Darlington\r\n  County parcel consists of thirty-three acres and contains merchantable timber\r\n  worth approximately $2,000-3,000.Â  One of the Florence County parcels consists\r\n  of approximately forty-two acres and contains merchantable timber worth\r\n  approximately $6,500-7,500.Â  The two remaining adjoining Florence County\r\n  parcels total seventy-five acres and are divided by Lamar Highway.[3]Â \r\n  The fifty-acre parcel lying west of Lamar Highway is unoccupied farmland, while\r\n  the twenty-five acre parcel lying east of Lamar Highway (hereinafter referred\r\n  to as &quot;the Homeplace&quot;) is occupied by the parties or members of the\r\npartiesâ€™ families. Â \r\nOn September 15, 2005, Donald commenced an in rem proceeding to\r\n  partition the property.[4]Â \r\n  After conducting a formal hearing and several conferences between the court and\r\n  counsel, the special referee issued his order on December 7, 2007.Â  In holding\r\n  that an in kind partition is preferred at law if the land can be fairly and\r\n  equitably divided, the special referee acknowledged that the property had been\r\n  in the family for three decades and that three of the late Mr. Melvin Campbell\r\n  Sr.'s descendants currently reside on the property.Â  Because equitable and\r\n  economic considerations warranted an in kind partition, the special referee\r\n  allotted each of the parties a portion of the subject property based on the\r\n  parties' testimony at the hearing, their respective ownership interests, and\r\ntheir improvements to and utilization of the land.Â  \r\nIn awarding the majority of the Homeplace to Donald,[5] the special referee found\r\n  that the improvements made to the Homeplace by Donald and Harvey Campbell's son\r\n  were more substantial in nature than those of the other parties.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Donald has affixed to the property a double-wide mobile home, a fenced-in horse\r\n  corral, and three outbuildings, one of the buildings being a water pump house\r\n  constructed by Donald and used by Donald's family and Betty Jean.Â  The special\r\n  referee acknowledged that Betty Jean also lived on the Homeplace in a\r\n  single-wide mobile home. Â Â However, the special referee found that\r\n  because her residence was not permanently affixed to the Homeplace and she had\r\n  not resided there as long as Donald, her improvements and contributions to the\r\n  Homeplace were less substantial than those of Donald.Â  Accordingly, the special\r\n  referee ordered that the real property be surveyed and subdivided so that each\r\nparty received a commensurate ownership interest.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\nOn appeal, the nieces claim the special referee erred in refusing to\r\n  consider their emotional attachment to the portion of the Homeplace awarded to\r\n  Donald, in refusing to strike certain testimony from the record, and in\r\nordering Betty Jean to remove her mobile home from the Homeplace.Â  We disagree.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Partition\r\nThe nieces argue the special referee erred in awarding the\r\n  Homeplace to Donald because the special referee failed to consider their\r\n  emotional attachment to that portion of the property, which resulted in\r\ndisparate treatment of the parties.Â  We disagree.\r\nA partition action is an equitable action and, as such, this\r\n  Court may find facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence. Â Zimmerman v. Marsh, 365 S.C. 383, 386, 618 S.E.2d 898, 900 (2005).Â \r\n  The partition procedure must be fair and equitable to all parties of the action.Â  Pruitt v. Pruitt, 298 S.C. 411, 414, 380 S.E.2d 862, 864 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989). Â This Court has previously stated that partition in kind is favored when\r\n  it can be fairly made without injury to the parties.Â  Anderson v. Anderson,\r\n  299 S.C. 110, 114, 382 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1989).Â  Furthermore, equitable\r\n  considerations such as the length of ownership and sentimental attachment to property\r\n  may be considered in a partition action, but the pecuniary interests of all of\r\n  the parties is the determining factor in deciding whether to require a judicial\r\n  sale or to allow a partition by allotment.Â  Zimmerman, 365 S.C. at 388,\r\n618 S.E.2d at 901.Â  \r\nThe special referee properly partitioned the property in a\r\n  manner that was fair and equitable to all the parties.Â  The special referee\r\n  considered the parties' emotional attachment to the land when he specifically recognized\r\n  the family's long-standing ownership of the property, the parties' respective\r\n  living situations, and the parties' preference for a partition in kind rather\r\n  than a judicial sale.Â  Citing to Zimmerman v. Marsh, 365 S.C. 383, 388, 618 S.E.2d 898, 901 (2005),\r\n  the special referee also stated that partition was justified on economic\r\n  grounds, as the pecuniary interests of all parties would be best served by\r\ndividing the property in this manner.Â  \r\nThe nieces argue they are unhappy with the distribution\r\n  because their mother, Betty Jean, lived a significant portion of her life at\r\n  the Homeplace. Because of this history and their emotional attachment to the\r\n  land, it has a greater inherent value to them.Â  Accordingly, the nieces argue that we must\r\n  redistribute the property or order a judicial sale to account for the disparity\r\n  in value.Â  However, no evidence of any current property values is in the record,\r\n  and the nieces fail to assert that the special referee erred in assigning\r\n  property values or in assigning ownership interest shares to each party.Â  See Wilson v. McGuire, 320 S.C. 137, 139 n.2, 463 S.E.2d 614, 616 n.2 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995)Â  (stating that the allocation of a preselected tract to one heir is\r\n  not prejudicial to other heirs unless evidence is presented to demonstrate that\r\nthe preselected tract is more valuable than the other tracts). \r\nFurther, the special referee's award of the Homeplace to\r\n  Donald is supported by the record.Â  Donald has lived on this portion of the\r\n  family property for his entire life.Â  In contrast, one of the nieces,\r\n  Elizabeth, testified she had only lived there for three months when she was a\r\n  baby.Â  As noted in the special referee's order, Donald has made the most significant\r\n  improvements to the Homeplace as he has permanently affixed to the property a\r\n  double-wide mobile home with a carport, a barn, a fenced-in horse corral, and\r\n  three outbuildings.Â  Both the water and the electricity running to Donald's and\r\n  Betty Jean's home are a result of Donald's efforts, as Donald built the well\r\n  and connected Betty Jean's home to his pre-existing power and utility lines.Â  Furthermore, we must reiterate that it is the nieces,\r\n  not Betty Jean, who have a legal interest in the property.Â  While the special\r\n  referee properly considered Betty Jean's living situation in the overall award,\r\n  because she is not a party to the action, her interests are not paramount in\r\nthe final determination. Â Â \r\nAfter considering the equities and the pecuniary interests\r\n  of the parties, we find the special referee was fair and equitable in the\r\n  overall partition of the property, including the allotment of the Homeplace to\r\nDonald.Â  \r\nII. Admissibility of Evidence\r\nThe nieces next assert the special referee erred in failing to strike\r\n  irrelevant testimony about the circumstances surrounding the transfer of Betty\r\nJean's property to the nieces.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude evidence is within the\r\n  trial court's sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion. Â Gamble v. Int'l Paper Realty Corp. of S.C., 323\r\n  S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996). Â To warrant a reversal based on the\r\n  admission of evidence, the appellant must show both error and resulting\r\n  prejudice. Â Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen &amp;\r\n    Assocs., Inc., 347 S.C. 545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001). Â When\r\n  improperly admitted evidence is merely cumulative, no prejudice exists, and\r\n  therefore, the admission is not reversible error. Â See Creech v. S.C. Wildlife Marine Res. Dept., 328 S.C. 24, 35, 491 S.E.2d\r\n  571, 576 (1997) (finding challenged evidence was simply one additional, minor\r\n  piece of evidence, so even though it was irrelevant, its admission did not\r\n  constitute reversible error).Â  Further, if a party deems testimony to be\r\n  irrelevant or prejudicial, an objection should be interposed when the testimony\r\n  is initially offered.Â  State v. Cooper, 212 S.C. 61, 69, 46 S.E.2d 545,\r\n  548 (1948).Â  If testimony is received without objection, the motion to strike\r\nis then addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Id.\r\nThe testimony the nieces object to was first elicited when\r\n  Donald testified.Â  When questioned as to what Betty Jean had done with her\r\n  ownership interest in the property, Donald responded, &quot;She put her land in\r\n  her daughtersâ€™ name so she could draw a check.&quot;Â  Neither party objected to\r\n  this testimony.Â  Later, during cross-examination of Donald's niece, Donald's\r\n  counsel asked, &quot;Isnâ€™t it a fact that the only reason [Betty Jean] put [the\r\n  property] into your name was to avoid claims of any kind of government agency\r\n  from whom she was going to be receiving assistance?&quot;Â  The nieces' counsel objected on the grounds of\r\nrelevance.Â  \r\nThe objection to this testimony was not\r\n  timely raised as Donald gave the same testimony during his direct examination\r\n  and no one objected at that time.Â  See Cooper, 212 S.C. at 69, 46 S.E.2d at 548 (stating if a party deems testimony to be irrelevant or prejudicial,\r\n  an objection should be raised when the testimony is initially offered).Â \r\n  The nieces' failure to timely object when this testimony was initially offered\r\n  waives their right to argue error on appeal.Â  See City of Greenville\r\n    v. Bryant, 257 S.C. 448, 454, 186 S.E.2d 236, 238 (1972) (stating that\r\n  failure to timely object to introduction of evidence constituted waiver of argument\r\n  on appeal); Parr v. Gaines, 309 S.C. 477, 481, 424 S.E.2d 515, 518 (Ct. App. 1992)\r\n  (&quot;Although limited exceptions exist,\r\n  objections to the admission of evidence must be made when evidence is presented\r\nat trial to preserve the error for appeal.&quot;).Â  \r\nEven if the nieces had preserved this issue for review, we find the\r\n  special referee did not err in refusing to strike the testimony from the\r\n  record.Â  While the nieces argue that the special referee was biased and\r\n  improperly influenced due to the &quot;highly suggestive&quot; nature of these\r\n  questions, they have failed to demonstrate that they were prejudiced by this\r\n  testimony.Â  In response to the nieces' objection, the special referee\r\n  specifically stated that he could direct the testimony to be struck, but he\r\n  would have to hear the testimony regardless of its admissibility.[6]Â Â \r\n  Further, the special referee stated twice that this testimony made no\r\n  difference in his decision as there was no jury to consider the testimony.Â  See Anderson, 299 S.C. at 114, 382 S.E.2d at 899 (stating that a partition action is an equitable matter that is tried by a\r\n  judge alone).Â  The nieces have failed to specify any portions of the order where the special referee relied on this testimony in reaching its conclusion, and there is no\r\n  indication from the order's plain language that this testimony influenced his\r\ndecision. \r\nAdditionally, when the nieces' counsel did object, the special\r\n  referee acknowledged that this testimony was already in the record when he\r\n  stated that the &quot;cat was already out of the bag.&quot;Â  Because this\r\n  testimony was merely cumulative to Donald's prior testimony, which was not\r\n  objected to, any error in the admission of this testimony is harmless.Â  See State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 507, 435 S.E.2d 859, 862 (1993)\r\n  (finding any error in admission of evidence cumulative to other unobjected-to\r\n  evidence is harmless).Â  Consequently, the special referee did not abuse his\r\n  discretion in denying the nieces' motion to strike the testimony as the nieces\r\n  have failed to demonstrate they were prejudiced by the admission of this\r\ntestimony.\r\nIII. Personal Jurisdiction \r\nLast, the nieces contend the special referee erred in asserting\r\n  personal jurisdiction over their mother, Betty Jean, for purposes of ordering\r\nthe removal of Betty Jean's mobile home from the Homeplace.Â  We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-50 (Supp. 2008) vests\r\n  a special referee with jurisdiction to hear a partition action.Â  This section\r\n  states, &quot;The court of common pleas has jurisdiction\r\n  in all cases of real and personal estates held in joint tenancy or in common to\r\n  make partition in kind or by allotment to one or more of the parties upon their\r\n  accounting to the other parties in interest for their respective shares . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  Â§ 15-61-50.Â  \r\nA partition action is analogous to a proceeding in rem.Â  Pinckney v. Atkins, 317 S.C. 340, 343 n.4, 454 S.E.2d 339, 341 n.4 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1995) (citing 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partition Â§ 100 (1987)).Â  It is more precisely\r\n  described as a proceeding quasi in rem, as the judgment deals with the status,\r\n  ownership, or liability of the particular property and operates as between the\r\n  parties to the proceedings.Â  59A Am. Jur. 2d Partition Â§ 85 (2008).Â \r\n  Thus, it is distinguishable from a proceeding strictly in rem, which determines\r\n  rights in a specific property against the entire world and is equally binding\r\n  upon everyone.Â  59A Am. Jur. 2d Partition Â§ 85 (2008).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  court must have both in rem jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction in a\r\n  partition action.Â  See Hisle v. Lexington-Fayette Urban County Gov't,\r\n  258 S.W.3d 422, 431 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008) (citing 68 C.J.S. Partition Â§ 67\r\n  (2007); 59A Am. Jur. 2d Partition Â§ 108) (finding that although a partition action is in the nature of an in rem proceeding,\r\n  it also has characteristics of a quasi in rem proceeding because it deals with\r\n  the title to realty and operates as to the parties in the\r\nproceeding, thus requiring both in rem subject matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction).\r\nThe special referee had jurisdiction to partition the\r\n  property pursuant to Section 15-61-50 and incidentally to allot certain\r\n  portions of the property to the respective parties in the action.Â  While the\r\n  special referee did not have personal jurisdiction over Betty Jean, as she had\r\n  no interest in the subject property and therefore was not a party to the\r\n  action, we do not read the order as an attempt to forcibly remove Betty Jean\r\nfrom her home.Â  \r\nThe language in the order to which the nieces object\r\n  states, &quot;the Defendants Jordan and Langley shall have an additional period\r\n  of ninety (90) days, should they wish to avail themselves of it, to move\r\n  the mobile home in which their mother resides, together with her storage\r\n  building, to the property allotted to them or otherwise as they and she may\r\n    agree.&quot; (emphasis added).Â  We hold the special referee's order permits\r\n  the nieces to remove Betty Jean's mobile home within ninety days of the order\r\n  in whatever manner and to whichever alternate location as Betty Jean and the\r\n  nieces deem appropriate.Â  The special referee's order is not an attempt to\r\n  assert personal jurisdiction over Betty Jean, but is rather a grace period for\r\n  allowing her to remove the mobile home before Donald can institute a separate\r\n  action to forcibly remove Betty Jean from the Homeplace should he decide to\r\n  pursue this course of action.Â  Consequently, the special referee did not\r\n  attempt to assert personal jurisdiction over Betty Jean, and the nieces'\r\nargument on this issue is without merit.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\non the foregoing, the special referee's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS, JJ. concur.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The late Mr. and Mrs. Campbell's children include:\r\n  Mary Alice Richardson, Betty Jean David, Harvey Campbell, Donald Campbell, the\r\nlate Melvin Campbell, Jr., and Geraldine Player. \r\n[2] At various times after the late Mrs. Campbell's\r\n  death, three of the sibling transferred their interests, resulting in the\r\n  above-stated ownership interests on the date of the hearing.Â  The transfers\r\n  were as follows: Melvin Jr. transferred his share to his siblings, Mary Alice\r\n  and Harvey; Geraldine transferred her share to her siblings, Mary Alice,\r\n  Harvey, and Donald; and Betty Jean transferred her share to her daughters,\r\nWendy and Elizabeth.\r\n[3] The special referee noted the discrepancy between the\r\n  tax map diagram and the property deed's depiction of the total acreage of the contiguous\r\n  Florence County parcels and concluded the total acreage consisted of\r\n  seventy-five acres, rather than ninety-six acres.Â  While the nieces state the\r\n  special referee did not explain his conclusion, they make only a conclusory\r\n  statement on appeal, and thus the refereeâ€™s finding is the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. Miller Hous. Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175,\r\n  525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (stating an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is\r\n  the law of the case); see also Glasscock, Inc. v. U.S. Fid. &amp;\r\n    Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œSouth\r\n  Carolina law clearly states that short, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for\r\nreview.â€).\r\n[4] As governed by S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-61-10 to -110 (2005\r\n&amp; Supp. 2008) and Rules 17 and 71, SCRCP.Â  \r\n[5] Harvey Campbell's son occupies eight and one-half\r\n  acres in the northernmost portion of the Homeplace, which the special referee\r\n  awarded to Harvey Campbell.Â  The nieces are not arguing to overturn this aspect\r\n  of the order as they set forth no specific argument on why awarding this\r\nportion of the Homeplace to Harvey Campbell would be inequitable to them.Â Â  \r\n[6] We note that even if the special referee chose to\r\n  exclude this testimony, it would have to be introduced on the record before\r\n  this Court could consider this argument on appeal.Â  See Baber\r\n    v. Greenville County, 327 S.C. 31, 41, 488 S.E.2d 314, 319 (1997) (â€œAbsent\r\n  a proffer, it is impossible for this Court to determine the effect of the\r\nexcluded testimony.â€). \r\n[7] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4518","title":"John and Jane Loe #1 & #2 v.

Dey, of Charleston, Guardian Ad Litem.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In\r\n  this consolidated action, Mother appeals from the family court's order\r\n  terminating her parental rights (TPR) to her daughter and son.Â  On appeal,\r\n  Mother argues the family court erred in: (1) finding any statutory ground for\r\n  TPR was proven by clear and convincing evidence, (2) finding TPR was in her\r\n  children's best interests, and (3) granting the foster parents' petitions to\r\n  adopt Daughter and Son.Â  Furthermore, Mother argues the family court erred in\r\n  denying her mistrial motion and ordering her to pay one-third of the fees for\r\n  the guardian ad litem (GAL) and the GAL's attorney.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nMother\r\n  and Father married in 2002 and divorced two years later. Â They have three\r\n  children together: Sister, now eight years old, and Daughter and Son, twins,\r\n  who are now six years old.Â  When Daughter was six months old, she was severely\r\n  injured, purportedly while in Father's care.[1]Â \r\n  Although Mother noticed Daughter's eyes were &quot;rolling back and forth in her\r\n  head,&quot; she waited two days before seeking medical care.Â  Daughter's\r\n  pediatrician testified he sent Daughter directly from his office to the\r\n  hospital, where she remained for fourteen days.Â  Physicians diagnosed Daughter's\r\n  condition as non-accidental, subdural hematomas, i.e., &quot;bleeding around\r\n  the brain,&quot; which is often associated with &quot;Shaken Baby Syndrome.&quot;Â \r\n  Daughter's physicians testified her injuries were the result of physical\r\n  abuse.Â  \r\nAfter the\r\n  hospital reported Daughter's injuries to the Department of Social Services\r\n  (DSS), law enforcement took the twins into emergency protective custody. Â Following\r\n  a probable cause hearing, the family court granted DSS custody of Mother's\r\n  three children.Â  A month later, the court conducted a removal merits hearing,\r\n  and thereafter, approved a placement plan (plan) granting Mother supervised\r\n  visitation and requiring her to maintain employment and pay child support.Â  A\r\n  few months later, Mother and Father separated, and in December 2004, the family\r\n  court granted Mother a divorce and issued a restraining order against Father.Â  In\r\n  October 2003, six months after Daughter's abuse, DSS voluntarily, and\r\n  without a court order, returned Sister to Mother's custody. Â On August 23, 2004,\r\n  the family court ratified returning legal and physical custody of Daughter to\r\n  Mother. Â \r\nIn August 2004, the\r\n  family court conducted the initial permanency planning hearing and noted Mother\r\n  had stipulated to a finding that she physically abused Daughter.[2]Â \r\n  At the time of the hearing, Daughter resided in foster care with John and Jane\r\n  Loe #1 (Loes #1), and Son resided in foster care with John and Jane Loe #2\r\n  (Loes #2).Â  The children's GAL and DSS recommended a permanent plan of\r\n  reunification of Daughter and Son with Mother.Â  The family court found Mother\r\n  had &quot;substantially complied&quot; with the terms of her plan by securing\r\n  and maintaining employment, completing a parenting assessment, and consistently\r\n  paying child support.Â  In consideration of Daughter's and Son's extensive\r\n  medical needs, however, the court granted DSS's request for an extension for\r\n  reunification, explaining: \r\n\r\n\t[Son]\r\n  has a shunt that drains excess fluid from his brain and underdeveloped lungs.Â \r\n  The shunt requires monitoring to ensure that it does not get clogged or [is]\r\n  not draining properly.Â  [Son's] breathing is normally rapid and shallow and\r\n  requires monitoring for any changes or problems with breathing.Â  If a problem\r\n  should occur and the treatment is not administered in a timely manner,\r\n  complications could result which could cause death.Â  [Daughter] is\r\n  developmentally delayed due to her injuries.Â  [She] cannot sit upright without\r\n  assistance and it takes approximately one hour to feed [her].Â  [Daughter] is\r\n  unable to crawl on her hands and knees . . . .Â  [She] currently attends\r\n  occupational therapy, speech therapy, and physical therapy several times a\r\n  week.\r\n\r\nThe family court conducted a second permanency planning\r\n  hearing in April 2005 and found &quot;it was more likely than not&quot; Father\r\n  had physically abused and neglected the children, and it ordered Father to have\r\n  no further contact with his children.Â  In contrast, regarding Mother, the court's\r\n  order stated: &quot;The permanency planning for reunification remains status\r\n  quo.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the court found it was in Daughter's and Son's best\r\n  interests to modify Mother's plan to allow her to have weekly, unsupervised\r\n  visits with Daughter and Son.Â  The court authorized a six-month extension of\r\n  foster care to give Mother more time to become involved in her children's\r\n  medical care.Â  \r\nA week after the\r\n  family court reaffirmed the plan for reunification, Loes #1 and Loes #2\r\n  (collectively, the Foster Parents) filed private actions against Mother,\r\n  Father, and Berkeley County DSS.Â  The Foster Parents' complaint asked the court\r\n  to terminate Mother's and Father's parental rights, require DSS to prepare\r\n  investigative reports necessary for adoption, issue a decree of adoption, and\r\n  change the children's legal names.Â  Nevertheless, DSS continued to move\r\n  forward with its plan to reunite Mother with her children; a few weeks later, Daughter\r\n  and Son began weekly, unsupervised, overnight visits with Mother and Sister. Â The\r\n  overnight visits were suspended three months later, after Mother requested a\r\n  meeting with DSS and stated she was overwhelmed by the demands of caring for\r\n  Sister, as well as Daughter and Son, who were then age two.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  DSS modified Mother's visitation to Thursdays, from 10:30 a.m. to 4:30 p.m.Â \r\n  Weekend, overnight visits resumed in July 2006, and thereafter, continued\r\n  without interruption.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  the family court conducted a third permanency planning hearing in March 2006,\r\n  Daughter and Son had resided in foster care for three years.Â  Once again, the\r\n  family court found Mother had completed her modified plan, consistently visited\r\n  her children, and paid child support; nevertheless, the court expressed concern\r\n  that overnight visitation had been unsuccessful.Â  Noting DSS had &quot;assessed\r\n  the viability of adoption&quot; and was now recommending &quot;a concurrent\r\n  plan&quot; of reunification within six months or TPR and adoption, the court\r\n  ordered DSS to continue providing services to Mother while it pursued\r\n  both options.Â  In October 2006, Mother submitted an affidavit to the court\r\n  stating she had done everything DSS had asked of her. Â Mother's affidavit\r\n  stated she was grateful for the care the Foster Parents had provided for her\r\n  children, and she asked the court to allow her children &quot;to come home.&quot;\r\n  Â Daughter and Son remained in foster care. \r\nIn\r\n  January 2007, Mother filed an answer and counterclaim in response to the Foster\r\n  Parents' complaint.Â Â  Mother's pleadings stated custody of Daughter and Son\r\n  should be returned to her because she had completed the terms of her DSS plans;\r\n  moreover, Mother noted that since October 2003, DSS had found her home to be\r\n  appropriate for Sister.Â  Mother informed the court she had qualified for legal aid\r\n  services, and she asked the court to hold the Foster Parents responsible for\r\n  all fees associated with bringing their action, including the fees for the GAL\r\n  and the GAL's attorney.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  consolidated the Foster Parents' actions and conducted a hearing in January and\r\n  February 2007, that included six days of testimony on behalf of Mother and the\r\n  Foster Parents.Â  Ultimately, the family court terminated Mother's and Father's\r\n  parental rights, granted the petition of Loes #1 to adopt Daughter, granted the\r\n  petition of Loes #2 to adopt Son, ordered Mother to have no further contact\r\n  with Daughter and Son, granted the Foster Parents' request to change the\r\n  children's names, ordered revision of the birth certificates, denied Mother's\r\n  mistrial motion, and ordered Mother to pay fees of approximately $10,000.Â \r\n  Mother's appeal followed.[3]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in terminating Mother's \r\n\t\t\tparental rights? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court abuse its discretion in \r\n\t\t\tordering Mother to pay one-third of the fees for the GAL and the GAL's attorney?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\tDid the family court err in denying Mother's motion \r\n\t\t\tfor a mistrial?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n\r\n\tIn appeals from the family court: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t[T]his\r\n  court has authority to find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence. Â However, this broad scope of review does not require us to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court. Â We are mindful that the\r\n  family court, which saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to\r\n  evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. \r\n\t\tÂ \r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n    Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 264, 631 S.E.2d 279, 282-83 (Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Termination\r\n  of Parental Rights \r\nMother contends the family court erred in terminating her parental\r\n  rights to Daughter and Son.Â  We agree.\r\nA.&nbsp; Fundamental\r\n  Rights of Parents\r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Children's Code sets forth this\r\n  State's policy regarding reunification: &quot;It is the policy of this State to\r\n  reunite the child with his family in a timely manner, whether or not the child\r\n  has been placed in the care of the State voluntarily.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-1-20(D)\r\n  (Supp. 2008). Â Moreover, the Children's Code &quot;shall be liberally construed\r\n  to the end that families whose unity or well-being is threatened shall be\r\n  assisted and protected, and restored if possible as secure units of law-abiding\r\n  members . . . .&quot; Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-1-30 (Supp. 2008).Â  Â \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court has declared: &quot;[I]t cannot now be doubted that\r\n  the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the fundamental\r\n  right of parents to make decisions concerning the care, custody, and control of\r\n  their children.&quot;Â  Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 66 (2000).Â  In\r\n  respect for this fundamental right, our own supreme court instructs courts to\r\n  proceed with thoughtful deliberation when deciding whether to terminate a\r\n  parent's rights: \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  termination of the legal relationship between natural parents and a child\r\n  presents one [of] the most difficult issues this Court is called upon to\r\n  decide. Â We exercise great caution in reviewing termination proceedings and\r\n  will conclude termination is proper only when the evidence clearly and\r\n  convincingly mandates such\r\n  a result.Â  \r\n\t. . .Â  Parental rights\r\n  warrant vigilant protection under the law and due process mandates a fundamentally fair procedure when the state\r\n  seeks to terminate the parent-child relationship.\r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs.\r\n  v. Cochran, 364 S.C. 621, 626, 614\r\n  S.E.2d 642, 645 (2005). Â Moreover, the Cochran court provided specific guidance as to when courts can consider TPR: &quot;The\r\n  fundamental purpose of terminating parental rights is to provide the greatest\r\n  possible protection to a child whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide\r\n  adequate care for the physical, emotional, and mental needs of the child.&quot;\r\n  Â Id. at 632, 614 S.E.2d at 648. \r\nCiting the\r\n  Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution and the United States\r\n  Supreme Court's decision in Santosky v. Kramer, this court declared: \r\n\r\n\tUnder\r\n  the United States Constitution, natural parents are entitled to fundamentally\r\n  fair procedures when the State seeks to sever the relationship they have with\r\n  their child. Â In Santosky, the United States Supreme Court announced: &quot;The fundamental liberty interest of\r\n    natural parents in the care, custody, and management of their child does not\r\n    evaporate simply because they have not been model parents or have lost\r\n    temporary custody of their child to the State. Â Even when blood relationships\r\n    are strained, parents retain a vital interest in preventing the irretrievable\r\n    destruction of their family life . . . .Â  When the State moves to destroy\r\n    weakened familial bonds, it must provide the parents with fundamentally fair\r\n    procedures.&quot;\r\n\r\nCharleston County Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368\r\n  S.C. 87, 96, 627 S.E.2d 765, 770 (Ct. App. 2006) (quoting Santosky v.

Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570 (Supp. 2008).Â  &quot;Before terminating\r\n  parental rights, the alleged grounds for termination must be proven by clear and convincing evidence. Â On appeal, this Court may review the record and make its own\r\n  determination of whether the termination grounds are supported by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc.

Examiners, 329 S.C.\r\n  371, 375, 496 S.E.2d 17, 18 (1998) (internal citations and quotation marks\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  family court found Mother satisfied the following statutory grounds for TPR:\r\n  (1) Daughter had been harmed, and it was unlikely\r\n  Mother could make the home safe within twelve months,\r\n  pursuant to section 63-7-2570(1); (2) Mother had not remedied the conditions that\r\n  caused the removal of her children, pursuant to section 63-7-2570(2); (3)\r\n  Mother has a\r\n  diagnosable condition that is unlikely to change within a reasonable time, and this\r\n  condition makes it unlikely she can provide minimally acceptable care for her\r\n  children, pursuant to section 63-7-2570(6); and (4) Mother's\r\n  children have been in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two\r\n  months, pursuant to section 63-7-2570(8).\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that while a judicial decision to terminate parental rights is always\r\n  difficult, the unique posture of this case gives us reason to exercise extreme\r\n  caution.Â  Typically, in a TPR case before this court, DSS initiates the TPR\r\n  action because it has deemed a parent to be &quot;unfit&quot; or unwilling to\r\n  raise a child that has been placed in the state's custody.Â  This case is\r\n  procedurally uniqueâ€”DSS has aligned itself with Mother in opposing termination\r\n  of her parental rights.Â  Furthermore, DSS argued persuasively to the family\r\n  court that Daughter's and Son's best interests would be served by reuniting\r\n  them with Mother and Sister.Â  \r\nWe commend the\r\n  Foster Parents for providing exceptional care to these medically fragile\r\n  children throughout the four years that preceded the TPR hearing.Â  We recognize\r\n  Daughter and Son are thriving, in large part, because the Foster Parents\r\n  consistently provided them with love and attentive care.Â  \r\nAt the outset of\r\n  our analysis, we point out that six days of testimony produced a dense,\r\n  factually-intensive, and complex record.Â  While the family court's order expressed\r\n  great concern that Mother had not accompanied the Foster Parents on many of the\r\n  children's medical appointments, we note Mother was consistently working two\r\n  jobs to pay child support, yet still managed to join her children for many of\r\n  their medical visits.Â  The children's pediatrician testified Mother had met\r\n  with him recently to discuss her children's medical conditions and acknowledged\r\n  Mother demonstrated concern for her children.Â  \r\nSix\r\n  months after Mother's three children were placed in foster care, DSS returned\r\n  Sister to Mother's physical custody.Â  Mother contends DSS would not have\r\n  returned her three-year-old child if her home was unsafe.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the first permanency planning hearing, conducted in August 2004, the court\r\n  found Mother had &quot;substantially complied&quot; with the requirements of\r\n  her placement plan.Â  Thereafter, the court granted DSS's request to extend\r\n  foster care, not because of Mother's shortcomings, but because Daughter's and\r\n  Son's extensive medical needs were best met by continuing their temporary\r\n  placement in therapeutic foster care. \r\nAt\r\n  the TPR hearing, the principal of Sister's school testified: &quot;[Mother] is\r\n  a very involved parent.Â  She's out in our school.Â  If we need her, we call her\r\n  and she will come.&quot;Â  The principal reported Sister does well in school, is\r\n  well-groomed, and has good manners.Â  Furthermore, she stated the school\r\n  coordinates speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, and\r\n  transportation services for children who require these services.Â  \r\nDr. Judith Hurt, a\r\n  parenting coordinator, testified she had known Mother for six years and had\r\n  observed Mother's interaction with her three children: \r\n\r\n\tI saw\r\n  her work with the children, playing games and also doing some cognitive\r\n  activities, reading with them and doing . . . puzzles. . . .Â  She knew that\r\n  children had a very short time period of attention.Â  She handled the misbehavior\r\n  very well.Â  There was never any screaming, any hollering.Â  She knew how to use\r\n  what we call &quot;quiet time,&quot; just take them away from the activity.\r\n\r\nHurt testified she sent\r\n  several letters to DSS asking them to give Mother &quot;the opportunity to\r\n  demonstrate to DSS that she is capable of being an effective mother.&quot;Â \r\n  Hurt added that Mother lives with her mother, who is willing to help care for\r\n  the children.Â  \r\nSince\r\n  April 2005, Daughter and Son have had regular, unsupervised visits with Mother\r\n  and Sister.Â  In July 2006, these visits were extended to include weekends, from\r\n  4:00 p.m. on Friday to 2:00 p.m. on Sunday, and Thursday afternoons.Â  We agree\r\n  with Mother that DSS would not have continued Daughter's and Son's unsupervised\r\n  visits with her for two years if Mother's home was unsafe or DSS had concerns\r\n  about a repetition of the abuse Daughter had suffered four years earlier. Â Moreover,\r\n  Mother contends Father caused Daughter's injuries, and Mother remedied the\r\n  situation that led to her children's removal by divorcing Father in December\r\n  2004.Â  \r\nMedical\r\n  University of South Carolina social worker Marcella Hamilton testified she\r\n  began working with Mother shortly after her children were placed in foster\r\n  care.Â  Hamilton testified Mother had &quot;some depressive symptoms&quot;\r\n  caused by environmental factors and stated an anti-depressant medication was\r\n  prescribed for &quot;a small period of time.&quot;Â  When she was asked why\r\n  Mother was depressed, Hamilton explained:\r\n\r\n\tBecause\r\n  [Mother] was young, I think she was 21 at the time.Â  She had three small\r\n  children.Â  Her children had been taken away, the two babies had special needs.Â \r\n  [Father] was no longer in the picture.Â  She was doing everything she needed to\r\n  do in terms of getting her children back.Â  She was doing all the work.Â  I\r\n  believe that's enough to make anyone depressed when you have all of those\r\n  circumstances on you at one time. \r\n\r\nLicensed clinical\r\n  psychologist Jack Booth conducted parenting assessments of Mother in 2004 and\r\n  2006.Â  Booth testified: &quot;[I] felt much more comfortable that in the second\r\n  interview [Mother] would certainly protect the children.Â  She didn't want\r\n  [Father] near them.&quot;Â  Furthermore, when Booth was asked if Mother was\r\n  ready to be reunited with her children, he responded: &quot;I think if she has\r\n  the capacity to learn, then she has the capacity to be taught; and the answer\r\n  is yes.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  March 2006, Stephen James was appointed as the children's GAL in the underlying\r\n  DSS action.Â  James testified he had visited Mother's home and observed &quot;the\r\n  children were fine with [Mother].&quot;Â  James testified he had &quot;no doubt&quot;\r\n  Mother is concerned about her children and loves them.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  May 2006, Sally Dey was appointed as the children's GAL in the Foster Parents'\r\n  private action.Â  Dey testified she visited Mother's home twice and also talked\r\n  with her on the telephone.Â  Dey visited Mother's home in July 2006, and her\r\n  report stated: &quot;At the time of my visit, [Mother] was having visitation\r\n  with the twins.Â  The home was clean and neat and there was adequate space for\r\n  the children.Â  The children appeared to be happy[,] and I did not see anything\r\n  that would cause me concern for their safety.&quot;Â  Yet, at the TPR\r\n  hearing, Dey recommended TPR and adoption because &quot;[t]hese foster parents\r\n  have done an extraordinary job with these children.&quot;Â  \r\nThe record establishes\r\n  the Foster Parents have done an exceptional job caring for their foster\r\n  children.Â  However, the evidence also indicates Mother's home is now safe. Â Mother\r\n  remedied the conditions that led to her children's removal by divorcing Father\r\n  and completing two DSS placement plans. Â The evidence failed to show Mother has\r\n  a diagnosable condition that would make it unlikely she could provide &quot;minimally\r\n  acceptable care&quot; for Daughter and Son.Â  Moreover, we find Mother consistently\r\n  paid child support, consistently visited her children, and communicated regularly\r\n  with the children's medical caregivers.Â  Accordingly, in our view, the record before\r\n  us does not establish by clear and convincing evidence that Mother: (1) could\r\n  not make her home safe within twelve months, (2) failed to remedy the\r\n  conditions that caused her children's removal, or (3) has a diagnosable\r\n  condition that is unlikely to change and makes it unlikely she can provide\r\n  minimally acceptable care for her children.Â  \r\nThe family court\r\n  also found Mother met a fourth statutory ground for TPR, i.e., Daughter and Son\r\n  had resided in foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months.Â \r\n  This fact is indisputable.Â  Mother correctly points out, however, DSS requested\r\n  the extensions of foster care after Mother had fulfilled the court's\r\n  requirements for her children's return.Â  As a result, Mother contends the\r\n  actions of others raised barriers and caused delays that resulted in her\r\n  children remaining in foster care beyond the statutory time required to trigger\r\n  this ground for TPR.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nMany states have a\r\n  statutorily mandated &quot;improvement&quot; period during which a parent must demonstrate\r\n  consistent efforts and progress in meeting the requirements the court has\r\n  specified for reunification.Â  In South Carolina, when a child has resided in\r\n  foster care for fifteen of the most recent twenty-two months, this ground alone\r\n  is sufficient to satisfy a statutory ground for TPR.Â  See Jackson,\r\n  368 S.C. at 101, 627 S.E.2d at 773; S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sims,\r\n  359 S.C. 601, 608, 598 S.E.2d 303, 307 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  In Jackson, we\r\n  also recognized: &quot;[T]he child and his parents share a vital interest in\r\n  preventing erroneous termination of their natural relationship until the State\r\n  proves parental unfitness.&quot;Â  368 S.C. at 96, 627 S.E.2d at 770 (quoting Santosky,\r\n  455 U.S. at 761) (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, DSS testified it caused the delays in reunifying Mother and her\r\n  children.Â  DSS foster care supervisor Katina Ferguson testified Mother\r\n  successfully completed two DSS plans.Â  When Ferguson was asked if there was any\r\n  reason Daughter and Son could not be reunited with Mother, Ferguson responded\r\n  in the negative.Â  Moreover, Ferguson testified DSS caused significant\r\n  delays in Mother's case: \r\n\r\n\t[Mother's]\r\n  visitation with her children was supposed to be increased to a point where the\r\n  children would be spending more time with [her] than in foster care.Â  That way\r\n  we would be able to assess her ability to care for the children; however, our\r\n  efforts at doing that have been dual.Â  There have been barriers that have been\r\n  put up to not allow that to happen.\r\n\r\nDSS\r\n  supervisor Barbara Parrott testified she first became aware of the possibility\r\n  of TPR in October 2005.Â  Parrott stated the only ground DSS had for TPR was\r\n  fifteen of twenty-two months, and &quot;we determined it was really not [Mother's]\r\n  fault for that ground, and I did not take the case into the [TPR] unit.&quot;Â \r\n  Parrott testified DSS staff told her Mother had remedied the conditions that\r\n  led to her children's removal.Â  Furthermore, she testified the DSS Adoptions\r\n  Unit had declined Mother's case because &quot;there was not sufficient evidence\r\n  for grounds of [TPR].&quot;Â  Parrott testified it was understandable that\r\n  Mother could not attend all of the children's appointments because of her work\r\n  schedule; however, she stated if the children were returned, Mother &quot;would\r\n  have control over setting those appointments, which she does not [have] at this\r\n  time.&quot;Â  Moreover, several of the children's providers testified they are\r\n  willing to schedule appointments that do not conflict with Mother's work\r\n  schedule.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  asked why this case had been allowed to continue so long, Parrott responded: \r\n\r\n\tFrom my review of the file, it\r\n  seemed like there were times when communication wasn't as it should have been.Â  Staffings, one recommendation would be made and then something else would be\r\n  put on the table.Â  The treatment plan was changed a few times, and we didn't\r\n  get back into court like we should have.Â  \r\n\r\nParrott was forthright in\r\n  acknowledging DSS probably &quot;dropped the ball,&quot; and she stated: &quot;[I]t\r\n  is not [Mother's] fault.&quot;Â  Parrott agreed the Foster Parents would provide\r\n  a loving and suitable home for Daughter and Son, then she added: &quot;But I\r\n  feel like [Mother] will also.&quot;Â  When asked why DSS had not filed a TPR\r\n  action, Parrott responded: &quot;[B]ecause our plan was reunification, and\r\n  [Mother] had complied with all of the treatment plan.&quot;Â  \r\nDSS\r\n  counsel Paul White asked the family court to deny the Foster Parents' request\r\n  for TPR, stating: \r\n\r\n\tDSS dropped the ball.Â  And that\r\n  really is not something [Mother] had any control over.Â  DSS does have its\r\n  shortcomings and we are working on trying to overcome those shortcomings, but\r\n  the fact remains that a good many of the delays in this case have been\r\n  departmental and not because of anything [Mother] did. Â So while it is true\r\n  that the children have been in foster care 15 of the last 22 months . . . that\r\n  can't all be ascribed to [Mother].Â  \r\n\r\nBecause we have a\r\n  duty to protect Mother's fundamental right to raise her children and\r\n  entitlement to fair procedures, and because DSS admitted it caused the delays\r\n  that allowed two of Mother's children to remain in foster care for fifteen of\r\n  the most recent twenty-two months, we find clear and convincing evidence did\r\n  not establish Mother satisfied this statutory ground for TPR.[4]Â  \r\nThe eleven\r\n  statutory grounds serve as a safety net that protects a fit and willing parent's\r\n  fundamental right to raise his or her child.Â  Even if the Foster Parents are\r\n  perhaps better situated than Mother to offer advantages to Daughter and Son, we\r\n  believe the fundamental right of a fit parent to raise his or her child must be\r\n  vigorously protected.Â  Because no statutory ground supports termination of\r\n  Mother's parental rights to Daughter or Son, we need not consider whether\r\n  terminating Mother's rights would be in her children's best interests.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the family court's order terminating Mother's parental\r\n  rights to Daughter and Son, return their legal and physical custody to Berkeley\r\n  County DSS, and remand for a determination of whether the children can be\r\n  safely returned to Mother's home.\r\nII.&nbsp; Guardian ad Litem\r\n  Fees\r\nNext, Mother\r\n  argues it &quot;seems unfair&quot; to require her to pay almost $10,000 in fees\r\n  to defend an action brought by the Foster Parents because she earns a minimal\r\n  income working two jobs, and she is &quot;unable to pay her own attorney's\r\n  fees.&quot;Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAppointment of a GAL\r\n  in a private action is controlled by the South Carolina Private Guardian Ad\r\n  Litem Reform Act, which became effective January 15, 2003, and states:\r\n\r\n\t(A) In a private action before the family court in\r\n  which custody or visitation of a minor child is an issue, the court may appoint\r\n  a guardian ad litem only when it determines that:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) without a guardian ad litem, the court will likely\r\n  not be fully informed about the facts of the case and there is a substantial\r\n  dispute which necessitates a guardian ad litem; or \r\n\t\t(2) both parties consent to the appointment of a\r\n  guardian ad litem who is approved by the court. \r\n\t\r\n\r\nÂ§ 63-3-810 (Supp. 2008).Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Reform Act authorizes the family court to appoint an attorney to represent a\r\n  non-attorney GAL.Â  See Â§ 63-3-820(E) (Supp. 2008). Â When the family\r\n  court determines appointment of an attorney to represent the GAL is necessary,\r\n  it must &quot;set forth the reasons for the appointment and must establish a\r\n  method for compensating the attorney.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\n\tAt\r\n  the time of appointment of a [GAL], the family court judge\r\n  must set forth the method and rate of compensation for the [GAL], including an\r\n  initial authorization of a fee based on the facts of the\r\n  case. Â If the [GAL] determines that it is necessary to\r\n    exceed the fee initially authorized by the judge, the guardian must provide notice to\r\n      both parties and obtain the judge's written authorization or the consent of\r\n      both parties to charge more than the initially authorized fee.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 63-3-850(A) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The statute provides the GAL is entitled to &quot;reasonable\r\n  compensation subject to the review and approval of the court.&quot;Â  Â§ 63-3-850(B).Â \r\n  Moreover, in determining the reasonableness of GAL fees and costs, &quot;the\r\n  court must take into account&quot; the following factors:\r\n\r\n\t(1) the complexity of the issues before the court; \r\n\t(2) the contentiousness of the litigation; \r\n\t(3) the time expended by the guardian; \r\n\t(4) the expenses reasonably incurred by the guardian; \r\n\t(5) the financial ability of each party to pay fees\r\n  and costs; and \r\n\t(6) any other factors the court considers necessary. \r\n\r\nÂ§ 63-3-850(B) (Supp. 2008). \r\n\r\n\tAs the TPR hearing\r\n  reached an end, Mother's counsel stated:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t[W]e\r\n  would also ask that all [GAL] fees and attorney for the [GAL] fees be paid by [the\r\n  Foster Parents].Â  There is uncontroverted testimony that [the Foster Parents']\r\n  income is sufficient to pay the cost and fees of this matter.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nMother earns $1,440 per month and has documented\r\n  expenses of $1,118 per month.Â  As a legal aid client, Mother's income is under\r\n  125% of the poverty level.Â  Moreover, the Foster Parents brought the action and\r\n  paid the GAL's retainer fee of $2,000.Â  \r\n&quot;An award of\r\n  GAL fees lies within the sound discretion of the family court judge and will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.&quot; Â Nasser-Moghaddassi\r\n    v. Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 196, 612 S.E.2d 707, 714 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  The record indicates the family court awarded the GAL, who was involved in this\r\n  case from May 2006 to March 2007, fees and costs of $13,712, and it awarded the\r\n  GAL's attorney, who was involved in the case from January 2007 to March 2007,\r\n  fees and costs of $15,248.Â  \r\nIn reviewing the\r\n  reasonableness of these fees, the family court erred in applying the factors\r\n  indicated in Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313\r\n  (1991), rather than the factors mandated by the statute. Â Furthermore, the\r\n  statute states an attorney-GAL is not authorized to have counsel appointed. Â We\r\n  do not address whether the GAL fees were properly approved pursuant to section\r\n  63-3-850 or whether the fees are reasonable.Â  Instead, we remand for a\r\n  determination of whether the statutory requirements were met in authorizing\r\n  fees for the GAL and the GAL's attorney and a determination of reasonableness,\r\n  pursuant to the factors specified in section 63-3-850(B).Â  \r\nIn light of our\r\n  ruling as to TPR, we additionally instruct Mother is not responsible for paying\r\n  the fees of either the GAL or the GAL's attorney; instead, the family court\r\n  must allocate the fees it finds to be reasonable among the Foster Parents and\r\n  DSS.Â  See Camburn v. Smith, 355 S.C. 574, 581, 586 S.E.2d 565,\r\n  568 (2003) (&quot;[W]here guardian ad litem fees are incurred in an action that\r\n  is found meritless on\r\n  appeal, the party instigating the action should pay.&quot;); S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Tharp, 312 S.C. 243, 245, 439 S.E.2d 854, 856 (1994) (finding\r\n  DSS liable for a reasonable GAL fee and remanding for a hearing de novo and\r\n  development of a full record).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION[5]\r\nWe find the clear and convincing evidence\r\n  does not support a statutory ground for termination of Mother's parental rights\r\n  to Daughter and Son.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the family court\r\n  in terminating Mother's parental rights and in granting the Foster Parents' petitions\r\n  to adopt their foster children; we return legal and physical custody of\r\n  Daughter and Son to Berkeley County DSS; and we remand the case to the family\r\n  court for (1) a review of the GAL's and the GAL's attorney's fees and a\r\n  determination of responsibility for payment of these fees and (2) a hearing on\r\n  appropriate temporary and permanent custody of Daughter and Son.[6]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  order of the family court is\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J., SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Mother testified Daughter &quot;was fine&quot; when\r\n  she left the children with Father; however, when Mother returned from the\r\n  grocery store, she noticed Daughter was &quot;moving her arms and legs.Â  She\r\n  was sweating a lot.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] Four years later, however, social worker Rheba Dewitt\r\n  testified DSS never determined who had inflicted Daughter's injuries.Â  \r\n[3] The family court also terminated the parental rights\r\n  of Father, who did not attend the TPR hearing and was found in default.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2590(B) (Supp. 2008) (&quot;The relationship between a\r\n  parent and child may be terminated with respect to one parent without affecting\r\n  the relationship between the child and the other parent.&quot;).Â  \r\n[4] We also find support for our decision in this case\r\n  from this language from a concurring opinion by Justice Pleicones: &quot;I am\r\n  not willing to sever the parent-child relationship solely on the basis that the\r\n  child has spent fifteen of twenty-two months in foster care where the\r\n    appellant presented substantial evidence that much of the delay in the\r\n    processing of this case is attributable to the acts of others.&quot;Â  Cochran,\r\n  356 S.C. at 420, 589 S.E.2d at 756 (Pleicones, J. concurring) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\n[5] Mother additionally argued the family court erred in\r\n  denying her mistrial motion.Â  Because our determination of the prior issues is\r\n  dispositive, we need not review this issue.Â  See Futch v.

Belcher, both of Florence,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLOCKEMY, J.:Â  Edward C. &quot;Buddy&quot;\r\n  Cribb, III appeals the circuit court's grant of Dean Spatholt, Clark Callahan,\r\n    and Boundary House's Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP, motion to dismiss for lack of\r\n    personal jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nSpatholt\r\n  and Callahan own and operate Boundary House (Boundary), a seafood restaurant.Â \r\n  Boundary is a North Carolina company organized under North Carolina law with its\r\n  principal place of business located at 1045 River Road, Calabash, North Carolina.Â  Spatholt serves as Boundary's president and treasurer, while Callahan\r\n  serves as vice-president and secretary.Â  Both serve on Boundary's board of\r\n  directors.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to Boundary's opening, Spatholt and Callahan approached Buddy Cribb to assist\r\n  with the business. According to Buddy's affidavit and complaint, Spatholt and\r\n  Callahan first approached him in December of 2003, while he was working at the\r\n  Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  It appears Buddy merely\r\n  spoke with Spatholt and Callahan about Boundary and did not enter into any type\r\n  of contract with them in 2003.Â  Later, Spatholt and Callahan approached Buddy's\r\n  father, Edward, to assist with the planning and operation of Boundary.Â \r\n  According to Edward, he met with Callahan at the Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle\r\n  Beach twice in January of 2004 to negotiate and discuss restaurant plans.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Edward entered into a contract with Spatholt and Callahan to work\r\n  as a consultant for Boundary, and he agreed to help recruit his son, Buddy, as Boundary's\r\n  general manager.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  early 2004, Edward contacted Buddy from Myrtle Beach about the general manager\r\n  position at Boundary.Â  Around May 2005, Buddy met with Spatholt and Callahan\r\n  and discussed the potential employment.Â  Shortly thereafter, Spatholt and\r\n  Callahan offered, and Buddy accepted, the general manager position.Â  Buddy\r\n  alleged Callahan promised to employ him for at least ten years.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Callahan promised Buddy the following compensation and benefits:Â  an annual\r\n  salary of $150,000, use of an automobile at Boundary's expense, health\r\n  insurance benefits, a cell phone and monthly plan for Buddy and his wife, two\r\n  days off per week, and two weeks paid vacation.Â  In reliance on this offer,\r\n  Buddy resigned from his position as an operating partner of California Dreaming\r\n  in Augusta, Georgia, and he and his family moved to Myrtle Beach.Â  Buddy commuted\r\n  to and from work while living in Horry County.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 12, 2006, the Cribbs sued Callahan and Spatholt in their individual\r\n  capacities and Boundary.Â  In his complaint, Buddy maintained Spatholt\r\n  unilaterally terminated him on September 1, 2006, and also sued for breach of\r\n  contract, promissory estoppel, violation of the South Carolina Payment of Wages\r\n  Act, and negligent misrepresentation.Â  Collectively, Boundary, Callahan, and\r\n  Spatholt moved to dismiss both cases for lack of personal jurisdiction,\r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  In a preliminary order, the circuit court\r\n  granted the motion to dismiss. Â In a final order, the circuit court dismissed\r\n  the case with prejudice after finding South Carolina lacked specific and\r\n  general jurisdiction over Boundary, as a business, and over Callahan and\r\n  Spatholt, in their individual capacities.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to general jurisdiction the circuit held Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt &quot;maintained\r\n  no continuous and systematic general business contacts with South Carolina that\r\n  were so substantial and of such a nature to justify allowing [Buddy Cribb] to\r\n  proceed with these lawsuits in this [c]ourt.&quot;Â Â  In regards to specific\r\n  jurisdiction, the circuit court found Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt &quot;did\r\n  not engage in any of the requisite conduct that the long arm statute\r\n  references.&quot;Â  Further, the circuit court found subjecting Boundary,\r\n  Callahan, and Spatholt to litigation in South Carolina violated due process\r\n  because 1) the litigation would be unfair and unreasonable to them; 2) South\r\n  Carolina had no viable interest in adjudicating a dispute involving conduct of\r\n  a restaurant operating solely in Brunswick County, North Carolina; and 3) Buddy\r\n  Cribb knew or reasonably should have known that Boundary operated exclusively\r\n  in North Carolina; thus, requiring Buddy Cribb to adjudicate the lawsuit there\r\n  would not be unfair.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed Buddy Cribb's\r\n  lawsuit with prejudice.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err in dismissing Buddy Cribb's suit after finding it lacked\r\n  personal jurisdiction over Boundary as a business entity and Callahan and Spatholt\r\n  individually? \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which\r\n  must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â  State v. NV\r\n    Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 88, 666 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2008). Â The\r\n  circuit court's decision should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence\r\n  or influenced by an error of law. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).Â  &quot;At the pretrial stage,\r\n  the burden of proving personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a\r\n  prima facie showing of jurisdiction either in the complaint or in affidavits.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.Â  &quot;When a nonresident defendant attacks the allegations of a\r\n  complaint based on jurisdiction, the court is not confined to the allegations\r\n  of the complaint but may resort to affidavits or other evidence to determine\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Power Prods. &amp; Servs. Co. v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423,\r\n  430, 665 S.E.2d 660, 664 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nPERSONAL JURISDICTION LAW\r\n&quot;The\r\n  concept of jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court over a particular\r\n  person (personal jurisdiction) or the authority of a court to entertain a\r\n  particular action (subject matter jurisdiction), but the concept does not refer\r\n  to the validity of the claim on which an action against a person is based.&quot;Â  Boan v. Jacobs, 296 S.C. 419, 421, 373 S.E.2d 697, 698 (Ct. App. 1988).Â \r\n  In the present case, we are concerned with personal, rather than subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Personal jurisdiction is exercised as &quot;general jurisdiction&quot;\r\n  or &quot;specific jurisdiction.&quot; Coggeshall v. Reprod. Endocrine Assocs.\r\n    of Charlotte, 376 S.C. 12, 16, 655 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2007).Â  \r\nI.Â \r\n  General Jurisdiction\r\nSection 36-2-802 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2003) governs general jurisdiction and states:Â  &quot;A\r\n  court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person domiciled in, organized\r\n  under the laws of, doing business, or maintaining his or its principal place of\r\n  business in, this State as to any cause of action.&quot;Â  &quot;A court may\r\n  assert general jurisdiction if the defendant has an 'enduring relationship'\r\n  with the forum state.&quot; Â Cockrell, 363 S.C. at 495, 611 S.E.2d at\r\n  510.Â  If an individual has an &quot;enduring relationship&quot; with the State,\r\n  he may be sued here even if the cause of action did not arise in South Carolina. See id. (&quot;General jurisdiction attaches even when the\r\n  nonresident defendant's contacts with the forum state are not directly related\r\n  to the cause of action . . . .&quot;).Â  To satisfy the &quot;enduring\r\n  relationship&quot; requirement of general jurisdiction, the defendant's\r\n  contacts must be &quot;continuous and systematic&quot; as well as &quot;so\r\n  substantial and of such a nature as to justify suit against the defendant on\r\n  causes of action arising from dealings entirely different from those activities.&quot;Â  See id. (citing Int'l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S.\r\n  310, 318 (1945)); Coggeshall, 376 S.C. at 17, 655 S.E.2d at 479 (2007) (&quot;An\r\n  enduring relationship is indicated by contacts that are substantial,\r\n  continuous, and systematic.&quot;).Â  Furthermore, the defendant's contacts with\r\n  the forum must satisfy the due process clause.Â  Cockrell, 363 S.C. at\r\n  495, 611 S.E.2d at 510.Â  \r\nII.Â \r\n  Specific Jurisdiction\r\nCourts\r\n  may also have specific jurisdiction over a cause of action arising from a\r\n  defendant's contacts with the state pursuant to the long-arm statute. Â State\r\n    v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 88, 666 S.E.2d 218, 222\r\n  (2008).Â  Under the long arm statute, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction\r\n  over an individual acting directly or through an agent for causes of action\r\n  arising from the individual's:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  transacting any business in this State;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  contracting to supply services or things in the State;\r\n\t(3)\r\n  commission of a tortious act in whole or in part in this State;\r\n\t(4)\r\n  causing tortious injury or death in this State by an act or omission outside\r\n  this State if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other\r\n  persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or\r\n  consumed or services rendered in this State;\r\n\t(5)\r\n  having an interest in, using, or possessing real property in this State;\r\n\t(6)\r\n  contracting to insure any person, property, or risk located within this State\r\n  at the time of contracting;\r\n\t(7)\r\n  entry into a contract to be performed in whole or in part by either party in\r\n  this State; or\r\n\t(8)\r\n  production, manufacture, or distribution of goods with the reasonable\r\n  expectation that those goods are to be used or consumed in this State and are\r\n  so used or consumed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  Traditionally, our courts have conducted a two-step analysis to\r\n  determine whether specific jurisdiction is proper by 1) determining if the long\r\n  arm statute applies and 2) determining whether the nonresident's contacts in South Carolina are sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.Â  Power Prods. &amp;\r\n    Servs. Co. v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423, 431, 665 S.E.2d 660, 664 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  However, a more recent trend compresses the analysis into a due process\r\n  assessment only.Â  Id. at 431, 665 S.E.2d at 664-65; see also Cockrell,Â \r\n  363 S.C. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508 (&quot;Because South Carolina treats its\r\n  long-arm statute as coextensive with the due process clause, the sole question\r\n  becomes whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate due\r\n  process.&quot;).Â  Â \r\nDue process\r\n  requires a defendant possess minimum contacts with the forum state such that\r\n  maintenance of suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and\r\n  substantial justice.Â  Coggeshall, 376 S.C. at 16, 655 S.E.2d at 478.Â  &quot;Further,\r\n  the due process requirement mandates the defendant possess sufficient minimum\r\n  contacts with the forum state such that he could reasonably anticipate being\r\n  haled into court there.&quot;Â  Power Prods., 379 S.C. at 431-32, 665\r\n  S.E.2d at 665.\r\nCourts apply a\r\n  two-pronged analysis when determining whether a defendant possesses minimum\r\n  contacts with the forum state such that maintenance of suit does not offend\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Â  Id. at 432,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 665.Â  &quot;The court must (1) find that the defendant has the\r\n  requisite minimum contacts with the forum, without which, the court does not\r\n  have the &quot;power&quot; to adjudicate the action and (2) find the exercise\r\n  of jurisdiction is reasonable or fair.&quot;Â  Id.Â  To support a finding\r\n  of due process, both prongs must be satisfied.Â  Id.\r\nTo\r\n  satisfy the power prong, the court must find the defendant directed his activities\r\n  to residents of South Carolina and that the cause of action arises out of or\r\n  relates to those activities. Â Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; Co., 358\r\n  S.C. 320, 331-32, 594 S.E.2d 878, 884 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Moosally court stated:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant\r\n  purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\r\n  forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. Â The &quot;purposeful\r\n  availment&quot; requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into a\r\n  jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated contacts.\r\n  Whether the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts has been met depends\r\n  on the facts of each case. \r\n\r\nId. at 332, 594 S.E.2d at 884-85.Â  Finally, under the\r\n  fairness prong, the court must consider the following factors:Â  (1) the\r\n  duration of the defendant's activity in this State; (2) the character and\r\n  circumstances of its acts; (3) the inconvenience to the parties by conferring\r\n  or refusing to confer jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the State's\r\n  interest in exercising jurisdiction.Â  NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, 379\r\n  S.C. at 91, 666 S.E.2d at 223.\r\nARGUMENTS AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Personal Jurisdiction of Buddy Cribb's Claims\r\n  Against Boundary and Callahan and Spatholt Individually\r\nBuddy Cribb argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in dismissing his suit for lack of personal\r\n  jurisdiction over Boundary as a business entity, and Callahan and Spatholt\r\n  individually.Â  He maintains the long arm statute applies to Boundary, Callahan,\r\n  and Spatholt based on the following activities:Â  (1) transacting any business\r\n  in this State; (2) causing tortious injury or death in this State by an act or\r\n  omission outside this State if he regularly does or solicits business, or\r\n  engages in any other persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial\r\n  revenue from goods used or consumed or services rendered in this State; and (3)\r\n  entry into a contract to be performed in whole or in part by either party in\r\n  this State.[1]Â \r\n  Moreover, Buddy argues Boundary possessed the requisite minimum contacts to\r\n  satisfy due process.Â  We believe the circuit court did not err in dismissing\r\n  Buddy's case based on Buddy's contract with Boundary and Boundary's presence in\r\n  South Carolina.Â  \r\nA.)Â \r\n  Due Process Based on Contract\r\nIn\r\n  support of Buddy's assertion that Boundary possesses minimum contacts with South Carolina, Buddy argues Boundary directed its activities towards the State by recruiting\r\n  him in South Carolina.Â  Buddy argues Boundary purposefully availed itself to\r\n  the benefits of doing business in South Carolina based on this recruitment.Â \r\n  Buddy also asserts Boundary purchased numerous food products, supplies, linens,\r\n  and other goods from South Carolina in furtherance of its business activities.Â \r\n  We find South Carolina lacks personal jurisdiction over Boundary if we only\r\n  examine Buddy's contract.\r\nOur\r\n  courts have held entering into a contract or mere negotiations inside South\r\n  Carolina without more is not enough to establish minimum contacts.Â  Loyd\r\n    &amp; Ring's Wholesale Nursery, Inc. v. Long &amp; Woodley Landscaping &amp;\r\n    Garden Ctr, Inc., 315 S.C. 88, 92, 431 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Burger King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 478-79 (1985)).Â  In Loyd,\r\n  this court stated:Â  &quot;An individual's contract with an out-of-state party\r\n  cannot alone establish sufficient minimum contact's in the other party's home\r\n  forum.&quot;Â  Id.Â  Furthermore the court found:Â  &quot;The parties'\r\n  prior negotiations, the consequences of their actions as contemplated by the\r\n  parties, the terms of the contract, and the parties' actual course of dealings\r\n  must be considered in evaluating whether a defendant purposefully established\r\n  minimum contacts within the forum.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has held South Carolina has jurisdiction over a party who entered into a\r\n  contract that was to be partly performed within the State.Â  Atl. Wholesale\r\n    Co., Inc. v. Solondz, 283 S.C. 36, 320 S.E.2d 720 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In Solondz,\r\n  a New York resident agreed to purchase silver from Atlantic Wholesale.Â  Id. at 37, 320 S.E.2d at 721.Â  However, when Solondz later refused to pay for the\r\n  silver, Atlantic Wholesale brought suit in South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  Our\r\n  court held South Carolina had jurisdiction over the suit because &quot;the\r\n  evidence presented at the hearing on the motion to dismiss clearly show[ed]\r\n  Solondz entered into a contract that was to be partly performed in South Carolina.&quot;Â  Id. at 38, 320 S.E.2d at 722.Â  Moreover this court found\r\n  adjudicating the case within the State would not offend due process even though\r\n  &quot;Solondz ha[d] engaged in little activity in South Carolina . . .\r\n  [because] the length and duration of the activity of the nonresident in this\r\n  State is not deemed important and need only be minimal when the plaintiff lives\r\n  in the forum state and the cause of action arose out of the defendant's\r\n    activities in this State.&quot; Id. at 39, 320 S.E.2d at 722 (internal\r\n  citation omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nBuddy\r\n  Cribb knew Boundary was located in Calabash, North Carolina when negotiations\r\n  occurred.Â  In fact, Buddy knew his duties as general manager would include:Â  \r\n\r\n\t(a)\r\n  creating, training manuals and other employee guidebooks for Boundary; \r\n\t(b)\r\n  designing the layout of the menu and procuring equipment and inventory for the\r\n  kitchen, bar, and dining area of Boundary; \r\n\t(c)\r\n  meeting with consultants and accounting professionals to determine the\r\n  Restaurant's expenses [and] revenues; [and] \r\n\t(d)\r\n  supervising the day-to-day operations of [Boundary], including but not limited\r\n  to, hiring and firing personnel, training new employees, and managing the\r\n  operations of the kitchen, bar, and dining area.\r\n\r\nBuddy also indicated he knew\r\n  he would have to purchase supplies from several South Carolina vendors.Â  Based\r\n  on Buddy's own admissions, under the terms of his negotiated contract, he knew\r\n  his work as general manager would occur in North Carolina.Â  Therefore, where he\r\n  would perform his job was within the contemplation of Boundary and Buddy.Â \r\n  Finally, the parties' actual course of dealings occurred at Boundary's\r\n  principal place of business, in Calabash, North Carolina.Â  Accordingly, South\r\n  Carolina lacks personal jurisdiction over Boundary based solely on Buddy's\r\n  contract.Â  \r\nB.)Â \r\n  Due Process Based on Presence within the State\r\nBased\r\n  on our courts' recent trend of compressing a personal jurisdiction analysis into\r\n  a due process assessment only, our sole question is whether the exercise of\r\n  personal jurisdiction would violate due process.Â  Cockrell v. Hillerich\r\n    &amp; Bradsby Co.Â  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005) (&quot;Because\r\n  South Carolina treats its long-arm statute as coextensive with the due\r\n  process clause, the sole question becomes whether the exercise of personal\r\n  jurisdiction would violate due process.&quot;); Power Prods. &amp; Servs. Co.\r\n    v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423, 665 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 2008) (where our court\r\n  assessed only a due process analysis to determine whether specific jurisdiction\r\n  was proper).Â  Accordingly, we must determine whether Boundary possesses minimum\r\n  contacts with South Carolina so as not to offend due process.Â  Under the\r\n  two-pronged analysis, we must determine whether Boundary (1) had the requisite\r\n  minimum contacts with South Carolina, without which, the court does not have\r\n  the &quot;power&quot; to adjudicate the action and (2) find the exercise of\r\n  jurisdiction is reasonable or fair.Â  \r\nBoundary\r\n  had more than random contacts within South Carolina under the power prong.Â  S.\r\n    Plastics Co. v. S. Commerce Bank, 310 S.C. 256, 262, 423 S.E.2d 128, 132\r\n  (1992) (&quot;This 'purposeful availment' requirement ensures that a defendant\r\n  will not be haled into a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous,\r\n  or attenuated contacts.&quot;).Â  Boundary was present in the state via its\r\n  agents Callahan, Spatholt, and Edward.Â  Boundary directed its activities toward\r\n  South Carolina by soliciting and contracting with Edward and Buddy here\r\n  regarding their respective roles with designing and operating Boundary.Â  In\r\n  fact, Boundary admits it &quot;hired some service providers from Horry County\r\n  to assist with planning the construction of the Restaurant in Calabash, North\r\n  Carolina.&quot;Â  \r\nEdward\r\n  Cribb, as an agent of Boundary, maintains he:Â  met with Spatholt and Callahan\r\n  to discuss plans for Boundary while in Myrtle Beach; recruited Buddy as\r\n  Boundary's general manager at Callahan's request from Myrtle Beach; met with\r\n  Callahan and Spatholt several times at architect William R. Halasz's offices in\r\n  Myrtle Beach to discuss and review prospective drawings, design, and layout of\r\n  Boundary; contacted a Myrtle Beach restaurant planner who drafted proposed\r\n  plans for the layout of Boundary's kitchen; met with representatives from\r\n  Jacobi-Lewis Company to discuss the layout of Boundary's kitchen and revised\r\n  and made changes to the layout at the meeting; closed Aspen Grill and\r\n  thereafter Boundary hired former employees from Aspen Grill.Â Â  \r\nEnough\r\n  business was conducted within the state to satisfy the power prong because:Â  1)\r\n  negotiations took place in South Carolina; 2) Edward, as Boundary's agent,\r\n  transacted business here; and 3) Callahan and Spatholt, as Boundary's agents,\r\n  met with Edward's contacts in South Carolina to discuss plans for opening\r\n  Boundary with South Carolina businesses.Â  Based on these contacts, we believe\r\n  Boundary has sufficient minimum contacts with South Carolina such that it would\r\n  expect to be haled into court here.Â  Accordingly, Buddy met the requirements of\r\n  the power prong.\r\nHowever,\r\n  the fairness prong of the minimum contacts test fails.Â  As explained above,\r\n  courts look at the following four factors in determining whether exercise of\r\n  jurisdiction is reasonable or fair:Â  (1) the duration of the defendant's\r\n  activity in this State; (2) the character and circumstances of its acts; (3)\r\n  the inconvenience to the parties by conferring or refusing to confer\r\n  jurisdiction over the nonresident; and (4) the State's interest in exercising\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  State v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 91,\r\n  666 S.E.2d 218, 223 (2008). \r\nUnder\r\n  the first prong, Boundary's activity within the State of negotiating an\r\n  employment contract with Buddy was brief.Â  Second, the character and\r\n  circumstances of the negotiations with Buddy were preliminary discussions\r\n  regarding Buddy's role as general manager.Â  The parties knew Buddy would\r\n  actually perform his duties under the contract at Boundary's principal place of\r\n  business and any other contacts formed within the state are not part of Buddy's\r\n  conflict.Â  Third, as Buddy admits in his appeal, Calabash, North Carolina is\r\n  only two miles outside the South Carolina border.Â  Further, Buddy commuted to North Carolina daily for work, and he currently lives close to the North Carolina border.Â \r\n  Therefore, it would not significantly inconvenience either party to adjudicate\r\n  the suit in North Carolina.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the State's interest in exercising jurisdiction is small.Â  Our supreme court,\r\n  in addressing this prong, held South Carolina's interest in providing redress\r\n  for its citizens was diminished when &quot;nothing which [was] the subject of\r\n  this litigation ha[d] taken place in South Carolina.&quot;Â  Aviation Assocs.\r\n    &amp; Consultants, Inc. v. Jet Time, Inc., 303 S.C. 502, 509, 402 S.E.2d\r\n  177, 181 (1991.Â  Specifically, the Aviation Court stated:Â  &quot;[W]hile\r\n  South Carolina has an interest in providing redress for its citizens, that\r\n  interest is diminished when no business was transacted in this State and any\r\n  contract formed was not to be performed in this State.&quot;Â  Id. Â Further,\r\n  the State's interest in exercising jurisdiction further diminishes when public\r\n  policy issues are taken into account.Â  Here, any business relationship Boundary\r\n  maintained within the State is unrelated to the current conflict, and a ruling\r\n  reversing the circuit court could discourage business relationships within\r\n  South Carolina that have nothing to do with the litigation.

Cribb appeals the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s grant of Dean Spatholt, Clark Callahan, and Boundary Houseâ€™s Rule 12(b)(2),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nSpatholt\r\n  and Callahan own and operate Boundary House (Boundary), a seafood restaurant.Â \r\n  Boundary is a North Carolina company organized under North Carolina law with its\r\n  principal place of business located at 1045 River Road, Calabash, North\r\n  Carolina.Â  Spatholt serves as Boundaryâ€™s president and treasurer, while\r\n  Callahan serves as vice-president and secretary.Â  Both serve on Boundaryâ€™s\r\n  board of directors.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to Boundaryâ€™s opening, Spatholt and Callahan approached Edward and his son, Buddy\r\n  Cribb, to assist with the business.Â  According to Buddyâ€™s affidavit and\r\n  complaint, Spatholt and Callahan first approached him in December of 2003,\r\n  while he was working at the Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle Beach, South\r\n  Carolina.Â  It appears Buddy merely spoke with Spatholt and Callahan about Boundary\r\n  and did not enter into any type of contract with them in 2003.Â  Later, Spatholt\r\n  and Callahan approached Edward to assist with the planning and operation of Boundary.Â \r\n  According to Edward, he met with Callahan at the Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle\r\n  Beach twice in January of 2004 to negotiate and discuss restaurant plans.Â \r\n  Thereafter, Edward entered into a contract with Spatholt and Callahan to work\r\n  as a consultant for Boundary.Â  Under the terms of the contract, Spatholt and\r\n  Callahan agreed to pay Edward $35,000 until Boundary opened and thereafter 5% of\r\n  Boundaryâ€™s gross pre-tax revenues.Â  Additionally, Edward agreed to help recruit\r\n  his son, Buddy, as Boundaryâ€™s general manager.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  early 2004, Edward contacted Buddy from Myrtle Beach about the general manager\r\n  position at Boundary.Â  Around May 2005, Buddy met with Spatholt and Callahan\r\n  and discussed the potential employment.Â  Shortly thereafter, Spatholt and\r\n  Callahan offered, and Buddy accepted, the general manager position.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 12, 2006, Edward Cribb sued Callahan and Spatholt in their individual\r\n  capacities and Boundary.Â  In his complaint, Edward maintained Spatholt\r\n  unilaterally terminated him on August 14, 2006, and alleged the following\r\n  causes of action:Â  breach of contract, promissory estoppel, violation of the\r\n  South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, and negligent misrepresentation.Â Â Â  Buddy\r\n  Cribb also filed suit.Â  Collectively, Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt moved to\r\n  dismiss both cases for lack of personal jurisdiction, pursuant to Rule\r\n  12(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  In a preliminary order, the circuit court granted the motion\r\n  to dismiss.Â  In a final order, the circuit court dismissed the case with\r\n  prejudice after finding South Carolina lacked specific and general jurisdiction\r\n  over Boundary, as a business, and over Callahan and Spatholt, in their\r\n  individual capacities.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to general jurisdiction the circuit court held Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt\r\n  â€œmaintained no continuous and systematic general business contacts with South\r\n  Carolina that were so substantial and of such a nature to justify allowing [Edward]\r\n  to proceed with these lawsuits in this [c]ourt.â€Â  In regards to specific\r\n  jurisdiction, the circuit court found Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt â€œdid not\r\n  engage in any of the requisite conduct that the long arm statute references.â€Â \r\n  Further, the circuit court found subjecting Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt to\r\n  litigation in South Carolina violated due process because 1) the litigation\r\n  would be unfair and unreasonable to them; 2) South Carolina had no viable\r\n  interest in adjudicating a dispute involving conduct of a restaurant operating\r\n  solely in Brunswick County, North Carolina; and 3) Edward Cribb knew or\r\n  reasonably should have known that Boundary operated exclusively in North\r\n  Carolina; thus, requiring Edward to adjudicate the lawsuit there would not be\r\n  unfair.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court dismissed Edward Cribbâ€™s lawsuit with\r\n  prejudice.Â  This appeal follows.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err in dismissing Edward Cribbâ€™s case after finding it lacked\r\n  personal jurisdiction over Boundary as a business entity and Callahan and\r\n  Spatholt individually?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  question of personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is one which\r\n  must be resolved upon the facts of each particular case.Â  State v. NV\r\n    Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 88, 666 S.E.2d 218, 221 (2008). Â The\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision should be affirmed unless unsupported by the evidence\r\n  or influenced by an error of law. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co.,\r\n  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).Â  &quot;At the pretrial stage,\r\n  the burden of proving personal jurisdiction over a nonresident is met by a\r\n  prima facie showing of jurisdiction either in the complaint or in affidavits.&quot;\r\n  Â Id.Â  &quot;When a nonresident defendant attacks the allegations of a\r\n  complaint based on jurisdiction, the court is not confined to the allegations\r\n  of the complaint but may resort to affidavits or other evidence to determine\r\n  jurisdiction.&quot;Â  Power Prods. &amp; Servs. Co. v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423,\r\n  430, 665 S.E.2d 660, 664 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nPERSONAL JURISDICTION LAW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  concept of jurisdiction refers to the authority of a court over a particular\r\n  person (personal jurisdiction) or the authority of a court to entertain a\r\n  particular action (subject matter jurisdiction), but the concept does not refer\r\n  to the validity of the claim on which an action against a person is based.â€Â  Boan\r\n    v. Jacobs, 296 S.C. 419, 421, 373 S.E.2d 697, 698 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In the\r\n  present case, we are concerned with personal, rather than subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  Personal jurisdiction is exercised as â€œgeneral jurisdictionâ€ or\r\n  â€œspecific jurisdiction.â€ Coggeshall v. Reprod. Endocrine Assocs. of\r\n    Charlotte, 376 S.C. 12, 16, 655 S.E.2d 476, 478 (2007).Â  \r\nI.Â \r\n  General Jurisdiction\r\nSection 36-2-802 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2003) governs general jurisdiction and states:Â  â€œA\r\n  court may exercise personal jurisdiction over a person domiciled in, organized\r\n  under the laws of, doing business, or maintaining his or its principal place of\r\n  business in, this State as to any cause of action.â€Â  A court may assert general\r\n  jurisdiction if the defendant has an â€œenduring relationshipâ€ with the forum\r\n  state. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 363 S.C. 485, 495, 611\r\n  S.E.2d 505, 510 (2005).Â  If an individual has an â€œenduring relationshipâ€ with\r\n  the State, he may be sued here even if the cause of action did not arise in South Carolina. Â See id. (â€œGeneral jurisdiction attaches even when the\r\n  nonresident defendantâ€™s contacts with the forum state are not directly related\r\n  to the cause of action . . . .â€).Â  To satisfy the â€œenduring relationshipâ€\r\n  requirement of general jurisdiction, the defendantâ€™s contacts must be â€œcontinuous\r\n  and systematicâ€ as well as â€œso substantial and of such a nature as to justify\r\n  suit against the defendant on causes of action arising from dealings entirely\r\n  different from those activities.â€Â  See id. (citing Int'l Shoe\r\n    Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, 318 (1945)); Coggeshall, 376 S.C. at\r\n  17, 655 S.E.2d at 479 (â€œAn enduring relationship is indicated by contacts that\r\n  are substantial, continuous, and systematic.â€).Â  Furthermore, the defendantâ€™s\r\n  contacts with the forum must satisfy the due process clause.Â  Cockrell,\r\n  363 S.C. at 495, 611 S.E.2d at 510.\r\nII.\r\n  Â Specific Jurisdiction\r\nCourts\r\n  may also have specific jurisdiction over a cause of action arising from a\r\n  defendantâ€™s contacts with the state pursuant to the long-arm statute. Â State\r\n    v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 88, 666 S.E.2d 218, 222 (2008).Â \r\n  Under the long arm statute, a court may exercise personal jurisdiction over an\r\n  individual acting directly or through an agent for causes of action arising\r\n  from the individualâ€™s:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  transacting any business in this State;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  contracting to supply services or things in the State;\r\n\t(3)\r\n  commission of a tortious act in whole or in part in this State;\r\n\t(4)\r\n  causing tortious injury or death in this State by an act or omission outside\r\n  this State if he regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other\r\n  persistent course of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or\r\n  consumed or services rendered in this State;\r\n\t(5)\r\n  having an interest in, using, or possessing real property in this State;\r\n\t(6)\r\n  contracting to insure any person, property, or risk located within this State\r\n  at the time of contracting;\r\n\t(7)\r\n  entry into a contract to be performed in whole or in part by either party in\r\n  this State; or\r\n\t(8)\r\n  production, manufacture, or distribution of goods with the reasonable\r\n  expectation that those goods are to be used or consumed in this State and are\r\n  so used or consumed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-803\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  Traditionally, our courts have conducted a two-step analysis to\r\n  determine whether specific jurisdiction is proper by 1) determining if the long\r\n  arm statute applies and 2) determining whether the nonresidentâ€™s contacts in South Carolina are sufficient to satisfy due process requirements.Â  Power Prods. &amp;\r\n    Servs. Co. v. Kozma, 379 S.C. 423, 431, 665 S.E.2d 660, 664 (Ct. App. 2008).Â \r\n  However, a more recent trend compresses the analysis into a due process\r\n  assessment only.Â  Id. at 431, 665 S.E.2d at 664-65; see also Cockrell,Â \r\n  363 S.C. at 491, 611 S.E.2d at 508 (â€œBecause South Carolina treats its long-arm\r\n  statute as coextensive with the due process clause, the sole question becomes\r\n  whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would violate due process.â€).Â  Â \r\nDue process\r\n  requires a defendant possess minimum contacts with the forum state such that\r\n  maintenance of suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and\r\n  substantial justice.Â  Coggeshall, 376 S.C. at 16, 655 S.E.2d at 478.Â  â€œFurther,\r\n  the due process requirement mandates the defendant possess sufficient minimum\r\n  contacts with the forum state such that he could reasonably anticipate being haled\r\n  into court there.â€Â  Power Prods., 379 S.C. at 431-32, 665 S.E.2d at 665.\r\nCourts apply a\r\n  two-pronged analysis when determining whether a defendant possesses minimum\r\n  contacts with the forum state such that maintenance of suit does not offend\r\n  traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.Â  Id. at 432,\r\n  665 S.E.2d at 665.Â  â€œThe court must (1) find that the defendant has the\r\n  requisite minimum contacts with the forum, without which, the court does not\r\n  have the 'power' to adjudicate the action and (2) find the exercise of\r\n  jurisdiction is reasonable or fair.â€Â  Id.Â  To support a finding of due\r\n  process, both prongs must be satisfied.Â  Id.\r\nTo\r\n  satisfy the power prong, the court must find the defendant directed his activities\r\n  to residents of South Carolina and that the cause of action arises out of or\r\n  relates to those activities. Â Moosally v. W.W. Norton &amp; Co., Inc.,\r\n  358 S.C. 320, 331-32, 594 S.E.2d 878, 884 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Moosally court stated:\r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  essential in each case that there be some act by which the defendant\r\n  purposefully avails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within the\r\n  forum state, thus invoking the benefits and protections of its laws. Â The\r\n  â€œpurposeful availmentâ€ requirement ensures that a defendant will not be haled into\r\n  a jurisdiction solely as a result of random, fortuitous, or attenuated\r\n  contacts. Whether the constitutional requirement of minimum contacts has been\r\n  met depends on the facts of each case. \r\n\r\n358 S.C. at 332, 594 S.E.2d at\r\n  884-85 (internal citations omitted).Â  Finally, under the fairness prong, the\r\n  court must consider the following factors:Â  (1) the duration of the defendantâ€™s\r\n  activity in this State; (2) the character and circumstances of its acts; (3)\r\n  the inconvenience to the parties; and (4) the Stateâ€™s interest in exercising\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. at 91, 666\r\n  S.E.2d at 223.\r\nARGUMENTS AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Personal\r\n  Jurisdiction of Edward Cribbâ€™s Claims Against Boundary, and Callahan and\r\n  Spatholt individually\r\nEdward Cribb argues the circuit court erred in\r\n  dismissing his suit for lack of personal jurisdiction over Boundary as a\r\n  business entity, and Callahan and Spatholt individually.Â  He maintains the long\r\n  arm statute applies to Boundary, Callahan, and Spatholt based on the following\r\n  activities:Â  (1) transacting any business in this State; (2) causing tortious\r\n  injury or death in this State by an act or omission outside this State if he\r\n  regularly does or solicits business, or engages in any other persistent course\r\n  of conduct, or derives substantial revenue from goods used or consumed or\r\n  services rendered in this State; and (3) entry into a contract to be performed\r\n  in whole or in part by either party in this State.[1]Â \r\n  Moreover, Edward argues Boundary House possessed the requisite minimum contacts\r\n  to satisfy due process.Â  Upon\r\n    examination of Edward Cribbâ€™s contract with Boundary and Boundaryâ€™s presence in\r\n    the state, we believe Edward met his burden at this stage in the proceeding to\r\n    defeat a 12(b)(2) motion to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction over Boundary,\r\n    Callahan, and Spatholt.Â  \r\nA.Â  Boundary as\r\n  a Business Entity\r\nBased\r\n  on our courtsâ€™ recent trend of compressing a personal jurisdiction analysis into\r\n  a due process assessment only, our sole question is whether the exercise of\r\n  personal jurisdiction would violate due process.Â  Cockrell v. Hillerich\r\n    &amp; Bradsby Co.Â  363 S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005) (â€œBecause South Carolina treats its long-arm statute as coextensive with the due process clause, the\r\n  sole question becomes whether the exercise of personal jurisdiction would\r\n  violate due process.â€); Power Prods., 379 S.C. 423, 665 S.E.2d 660\r\n  (where our court assessed only a due process analysis to determine whether\r\n  specific jurisdiction was proper).Â  Accordingly, we must determine whether\r\n  Boundary possesses minimum contacts with South Carolina so as not to offend due\r\n  process.Â  Under the two-pronged analysis, we must determine whether Boundary (1)\r\n  had the requisite minimum contacts with South Carolina, without which, the court\r\n  does not have the â€œpowerâ€ to adjudicate the action, and (2) find the exercise\r\n  of jurisdiction is reasonable or fair.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  support of Edwardâ€™s assertion that Boundary possesses minimum contacts with South Carolina, he argues in execution of his contract with Boundary he was to provide\r\n  planning and operation services.Â  Edward maintains Boundary directed its\r\n  activities toward South Carolina by soliciting and contracting with him to\r\n  assist with designing and operating Boundary.Â  In his affidavit Edward specifically\r\n  maintains he:Â  met with Spatholt and Callahan to discuss plans for Boundary\r\n  while in Myrtle Beach; recruited Buddy as Boundaryâ€™s general manager at\r\n  Callahanâ€™s request from Myrtle Beach; met with Callahan and Spatholt several\r\n  times at architect William R. Halaszâ€™s offices in Myrtle Beach to discuss and\r\n  review prospective drawings, design, and layout of Boundary; contacted a Myrtle\r\n  Beach restaurant planner who drafted proposed plans for the layout of\r\n  Boundaryâ€™s kitchen; met with representatives from Jacobi-Lewis Company to\r\n  discuss the layout of Boundaryâ€™s kitchen and revised and made changes to the\r\n  layout at the meeting; closed Aspen Grill and thereafter Boundary hired former\r\n  employees from Aspen Grill.Â  As such, Edward contends Boundary purposefully\r\n  availed itself of the benefits of doing business in South Carolina so that it\r\n  could reasonably anticipate being haled into court here.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  courts have held entering into a contract or mere negotiations inside South Carolina without more is not enough to establish minimum contacts.Â  Loyd &amp;\r\n    Ringâ€™s Wholesale Nursery, Inc. v. Long &amp; Woodley Landscaping &amp; Garden Ctr,\r\n    Inc., 315 S.C. 88, 92, 431 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 1993) (citing Burger\r\n      King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 478-79 (1985)).Â  In Loyd,\r\n  this court stated:Â  â€œAn individualâ€™s contract with an out-of-state party cannot\r\n  alone establish sufficient minimum contactâ€™s in the other partyâ€™s home forum.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore the court found:Â  â€œThe partiesâ€™ prior negotiations,\r\n  the consequences of their actions as contemplated by the parties, the terms of\r\n  the contract, and the partiesâ€™ actual course of dealings must be considered in\r\n  evaluating whether a defendant purposefully established minimum contacts within\r\n  the forum.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nThough\r\n  Edward knew Callahan and Spatholt were planning on opening Boundary in\r\n  Calabash, North Carolina, in performing his duties under his contract, Edward\r\n  met with contacts in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina.Â  In fact, Boundary admits it\r\n  â€œhired some service providers from Horry County to assist with planning the\r\n  construction of the Restaurant in Calabash, North Carolina.Â  Therefore, it\r\n  appears Boundary, when forming its contract with Edward, contemplated Edward\r\n  would use his Myrtle Beach contacts, including recruiting his son Buddy, to perform\r\n  his duties of planning and designing Boundary.Â  Therefore, because part of\r\n  Edwardâ€™s contract was to be performed in South Carolina, more than â€œmere\r\n  negotiationsâ€ took place here.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court has held South Carolina has jurisdiction over a party who entered into a\r\n  contract that was to be partly performed within the State.Â  Atl. Wholesale\r\n    Co. v. Solondz, 283 S.C. 36, 37, 320 S.E.2d 720, 721 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In Solondz,\r\n  a New York resident, agreed to purchase silver from Atlantic Wholesale.Â  Id.Â \r\n  However, when Solondz later refused to pay for the silver, Atlantic Wholesale\r\n  brought suit in South Carolina.Â  Id.Â  Our court held South Carolina had\r\n  jurisdiction over the suit because â€œthe evidence presented at the hearing on\r\n  the motion to dismiss clearly show[ed] Solondz entered into a contract that was\r\n  to be partly performed in South Carolina.â€Â  Id. at 38, 320 S.E.2d at 722.Â \r\n  Moreover this court found adjudicating the case within the State would not\r\n  offend due process even though â€œSolondz ha[d] engaged in little activity in\r\n  South Carolina . . . [because] the length and duration of the activity of the\r\n  nonresident in this State is not deemed important and need only be minimal when\r\n  the plaintiff lives in the forum state and the cause of action arose out of\r\n    the defendantâ€™s activities in this State.â€ Id. at 39, 320 S.E.2d at\r\n  722 (internal citation omitted) (emphasis added).\r\nWe\r\n  believe personal jurisdiction over Boundary is proper at this stage in the\r\n  proceeding.Â  Boundary negotiated Edwardâ€™s contract in South Carolina, and it\r\n  was within its contemplation that Edward would perform his part of the contract\r\n  here.Â  In fact, Boundary admitted hiring service providers from Horry County to\r\n  assist with planning the construction of the restaurant in Calabash, North\r\n  Carolina.Â  Because the restaurant was not yet in existence at the time the\r\n  contract was entered into, one would logically expect planning to occur at the\r\n  most convenient location for the parties.Â  Therefore, because part of Edwardâ€™s\r\n  contract was to be performed within South Carolina and because Edwardâ€™s cause\r\n  of action arose from a breach of that contract, we believe Boundary has\r\n  sufficient minimum contacts with South Carolina such that it would expect to be\r\n  haled into court here.Â  Accordingly, we find Edward met his pretrial prima\r\n  facie burden of demonstrating personal jurisdiction over Boundary in his\r\n  complaint and affidavits. Â Cockrell v. Hillerich &amp; Bradsby Co., 363\r\n  S.C. 485, 491, 611 S.E.2d 505, 508 (2005).Â  Therefore, Edward met the\r\n  requirements of the power prong.\r\nLastly,\r\n  we believe the fairness prong of the minimum contacts test is met as well.Â  To\r\n  reiterate, courts look at the following four factors in determining whether exercise\r\n  of jurisdiction is reasonable or fair:Â  (1) the duration of the defendantâ€™s activity\r\n  in this State; (2) the character and circumstances of its acts; (3) the\r\n  inconvenience to the parties; and (4) the Stateâ€™s interest in exercising\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  State v. NV Sumatra Tobacco Trading, Co., 379 S.C. 81, 91,\r\n  666 S.E.2d 218, 223 (2008).\r\nUnder\r\n  the first prong, Boundaryâ€™s activity within the State was continuous.Â Â  Edward\r\n  maintains Callahan and Spatholt, as agents of Boundary, came to Myrtle Beach on several occasions to meet and discuss plans for opening Boundary with South Carolina businesses.Â  Further, Edward, on behalf of Boundary, met with several Myrtle\r\n  Beach contacts in performing his part of the contract.Â  Therefore, the duration\r\n  of Edwardâ€™s activity in South Carolina was also continuous.Â  Second, the\r\n  character and circumstances of the negotiations and meetings appear essential\r\n  to Edward fulfilling his part of the contract.Â  It appears several businesses\r\n  within South Carolina were contacted and potentially hired to perform several\r\n  tasks in starting up Boundary.Â  Third, it would not significantly inconvenience\r\n  either party to adjudicate the suit in South Carolina given Boundaryâ€™s\r\n  proximity.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  South Carolina has an interest in providing redress for its citizens.Â  Burger\r\n    King Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 473 (1985) (â€œA State generally has a\r\n  â€˜manifest interestâ€™ in providing its residents with a convenient forum for\r\n  redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.â€); Springmasters, Inc.\r\n    v. D &amp; M Mfg., 303 S.C. 528, 533, 402 S.E.2d 192, 195 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n  (â€œSouth Carolina has a legitimate interest in providing its citizens a forum to\r\n  resolve claims for breach of contract.â€).Â  Further, enough business was\r\n  conducted within the state to warrant adjudication of the suit here.Â  Contra Aviation Assocs. &amp; Consultants, Inc. v. Jet Time, Inc., 303 S.C. 502,\r\n  509, 402 S.E.2d 177, 181 (1991) (â€œ[W]hile South Carolina has an interest in\r\n  providing redress for its citizens, that interest is diminished when no\r\n  business was transacted in this State and any contract formed was not to be\r\n  performed in this State.â€).Â  Because both prongs of the minimum contact\r\n  analysis are met, adjudication of Edwardâ€™s suit against Boundary in South Carolina would not offend due process.Â  \r\nB.Â \r\n  Callahan and Spatholt Individually\r\nFor\r\n  reasons similar to the ones stated above, we believe Callahan and Spatholt\r\n  individually possess enough minimum contacts with South Carolina so as not to\r\n  offend due process.Â  These contacts include the following:Â  Callahanâ€™s 2003\r\n  meeting with Buddy Cribb at the Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle Beach regarding\r\n  Buddyâ€™s interest in helping start a restaurant; Callahan and Spatholtâ€™s two\r\n  2004 meetings with Edward Cribb at the Carolina Roadhouse in Myrtle Beach to\r\n  discuss his interest in starting a new restaurant; and Callahanâ€™s meeting at\r\n  Architect William R. Halaszâ€™s office in Myrtle Beach.Â  Furthermore, Boundary\r\n  filed its Articles of Incorporation on June 23, 2004, and according to Edwardâ€™s\r\n  complaint, Boundary opened for business on November 15, 2005.Â  Therefore, given\r\n  Boundary was not yet in existence when Edward first began acting as a\r\n  consultant, he was acting on Callahan and Spatholtâ€™s behalf rather than on\r\n  Boundaryâ€™s behalf in performing part of his contract.Â  See ML-Lee\r\n    Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 242, 489 S.E.2d\r\n  470, 472 (1997) (â€œ[A]uthorized acts of an agent are the acts of the principal.â€).\r\n  Â Based on Callahan and Spatholtâ€™s contacts, the power prong of the minimum\r\n  contacts analysis is met.Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  the fairness prong is also satisfied.Â  Callahan and Spatholt admit to hiring South Carolina businesses and meeting with them in Myrtle Beach.Â  Second, the character and\r\n  circumstances of their negotiations and meetings here appear essential to\r\n  Boundaryâ€™s successful opening.Â  Third, it would not significantly inconvenience\r\n  either party to adjudicate the suit in South Carolina given Boundaryâ€™s\r\n  proximity.Â  Moreover, given our decision regarding personal jurisdiction over Boundary,\r\n  Callahan and Spatholt will likely be in South Carolina on Boundaryâ€™s behalf to\r\n  defend Edwardâ€™s suit.Â  Finally, South Carolina has an interest in providing\r\n  redress for its citizens and enough business was conducted within the state to\r\n  warrant adjudication of the suit here.Â  The circuit court's dismissal of\r\n  Edwardâ€™s suit for lack of personal jurisdiction in regards to Boundary as a\r\n  business entity and Callahan and Spatholt individually is therefore \r\nREVERSED.\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, J.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] These activities correspond to sections 1, 4, and 7\r\n  of the long arm statute, respectively.Â  S.C.

Â \r\nFACTS\r\nJane Doe, a\r\n  fourteen-year-old high-school student, began the school year enrolled in the\r\n  District's alternative school at Blythewood Academy (Academy).Â  In August, the\r\n  Academy suspended Doe for two days after she engaged in a verbal altercation\r\n  with another student.Â  Less than a month later, a video camera captured Doe\r\n  following a male student into the boys' restroom.Â  According to Doe, she\r\n  entered the boys' restroom to retrieve a comb the student had taken from her.Â \r\n  Doe remained in the boys' restroom for about a minute until another male\r\n  student entered the restroom; then, Doe exited the restroom.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  this incident, the Academy suspended Doe for ten days and recommended expulsion\r\n  for the remainder of the year.Â  According to the Academy, Doe committed a sexual\r\n  offense when she entered the boys' restroom with another male student. [1]Â \r\n  In a letter to Doe, the District notified her of the Academy's recommendation,\r\n  the date of the upcoming evidentiary hearing, and her procedural rights.Â  Prior\r\n  to the hearing, the District recorded over the videotape before Doe was allowed\r\n  to view it.Â  The school administrator and the hearing officer watched the tape\r\n  prior to its destruction and reported only observing Doe enter the boys'\r\n  restroom following a male student.Â  The District did not present any additional\r\n  evidence suggesting Doe committed a sexual offense.Â  Nonetheless, the hearing\r\n  officer found Doe committed a sexual offense and expelled her for the remainder\r\n  of the year. \r\nDoe timely appealed\r\n  the hearing officer's decision to the Board.Â  The Board, however, upheld the\r\n  hearing officer's decision.Â  Doe appealed the Board's decision to the circuit\r\n  court pursuant to section 59-63-240 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  The circuit court reversed, finding substantial evidence did not support the\r\n  Board's decision to expel Doe for committing a sexual offense.Â  In addition,\r\n  the court found Doe's due process rights were violated. This appeal followed. Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA school board's\r\n  decision to expel a student from school &quot;may be appealed to the proper\r\n  court.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-63-240 (Supp. 2008); see Davis v.\r\n    Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, 374 S.C. 39, 44, 647 S.E.2d 219, 222\r\n  (2007) (stating the expulsion provision in the statute, unlike the suspension\r\n  provision, expressly grants the student a right to appeal to the proper\r\n  court).Â  Judicial review of the school board's decision is limited to\r\n  ascertaining whether the board's decision is supported by substantial\r\n  evidence.Â  Laws v. Richland County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 270 S.C. 492, 495,\r\n  243 S.E.2d 192, 193 (1978).Â  However, this court\r\n  cannot substitute its judgment for that of the educational authorities.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nÂ LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAccording to the\r\n  District, Doe's voluntary act of entering the boys' restroom with a male\r\n  student amounted to a sexual offense.Â  Thus, the District asserts, given this\r\n  incident and Doe's prior disciplinary history, substantial evidence supports\r\n  the Board's decision to expel her from school.Â  The District complains the\r\n  circuit court improperly substituted its judgment for that of school\r\n  authorities in reversing the Board's decision.Â  We disagree. Â Â Â \r\n&quot;Substantial\r\n  evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow\r\n  reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the Board reached or must have\r\n  reached in order to justify its action.&quot;Â  Kizer v. Dorchester County\r\n    Vocational Educ. Bd. of Trs., 287 S.C. 545, 548, 340 S.E.2d 144, 146 (1986).Â  Â Â \r\nDoe's\r\n  prior acts of disruptive activity while a student at the District have no\r\n  bearing on the analysis of the question before us.Â  The District chose not to\r\n  expel Doe for any of her prior transgressions and only expelled her for\r\n  committing a sexual offense in violation of Level\r\n  III Item 5 of the District's Discipline Code.Â  Thus, the narrow question before\r\n  us is whether the Board's decision to uphold the expulsion of Doe for\r\n  committing a sexual offense is supported by substantial evidence.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  only evidence Doe committed a sexual offense was her voluntary entry into the\r\n  boys' restroom for approximately one minute in pursuit of a male student.Â  The\r\n  school administrator and the hearing officer, the only individuals who viewed\r\n  the videotape, reported observing no more than this.Â  The record does not\r\n  contain any evidence that Doe and the male student engaged in any sort of\r\n  sexual activity or planned to do so.Â  Furthermore, there was no statement from\r\n  the male student or any other student that indicated anything sexual occurred.Â \r\n  On these facts, we believe substantial evidence does not support the Board's\r\n  decision to expel Doe.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the decision of the circuit court is thereforeÂ Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT, J., and\r\n  KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] &quot;Sexual offense&quot; is not defined by the\r\n  Districtâ€™s Discipline Code.Â  However, Level III Item 5 of the Districtâ€™s\r\nDiscipline Code, JICDA-R, makes sexual offenses punishable by expulsion.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4522","title":"State v.

Savings Clause \r\nBryant\r\n  contends the savings clause prohibited the admission of the videotaped\r\n  interviews in his trial, because the savings clause prohibited any repeal or\r\n  amendment from taking effect in pending cases.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n  17-23-175(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008) allows the admission of\r\n  out-of-court statements by child sexual abuse victims when the following conditions\r\n  are met: \r\n\r\n  (1) the\r\n    statement was given in response to questioning conducted during an\r\n    investigative interview of the child;\r\n  (2)Â Â Â Â  an\r\n    audio and visual recording of the statement is preserved on film, videotape, or\r\n    other electronic means . . . ;\r\n  (3)Â Â Â Â  the\r\n    child testifies at the proceeding and is subject to cross-examination on the\r\n    elements of the offense and the making of the out-of-court statement; and \r\n  (4)Â Â Â Â  the\r\n    court finds, in a hearing conducted outside the presence of the jury, that the\r\n    totality of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement provides\r\n    particularized guarantees of the trustworthiness.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  savings clause accompanying the enactment of section 17-23-175 provides:\r\n\r\n  The repeal or amendment by this act of any law,\r\n    whether temporary or permanent or civil or criminal, does\r\n    not affect pending actions, rights, duties, or liabilities founded thereon, or\r\n    alter, discharge, release, or extinguish any penalty, forfeiture, or liability\r\n    incurred under the repealed or amended law, unless the repealed or amended\r\n    provision shall so expressly provide. \r\n\r\n2006 S.C. Act No. 346  Â§ 7 (the Act) (emphasis added).\r\nGenerally,\r\n  a savings clause is intended to be &quot;a restriction in a repealing act,\r\n  which is intended to save rights, pending proceedings, penalties, etc., from\r\n  the annihilation which would result from an unrestricted appeal.&quot;Â  Pierce\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 146 n.3, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 n.3 (2000) (quoting Black's\r\n      Law Dictionary 1343 (6th ed. 1990)).\r\n\r\n  The longstanding\r\n    common law view is that a &quot;continued prosecution necessarily depend[s]\r\n    upon the continued life of the statute which the prosecution seeks to apply. In\r\n    case a statute is repealed or rendered inoperative, no further proceedings can\r\n    be had to enforce it in pending prosecutions unless competent authority has\r\n    kept the statute alive for that purpose. . . . Prosecution for crimes is but an\r\n    application or enforcement of the law, and if\r\n    the prosecution continues the law must continue to vivify it.&quot;\r\n\r\nId. at 145-46, 526 S.E.2d at 225 (quoting U.S. v.\r\n  Chambers, 291 U.S. 217, 223, 226 (1934)) (omission by court).\r\nThe\r\n  Act did several things in addition to providing a mechanism for admitting\r\n  out-of-court statements by a child victim of sexual abuse via section 17-23-175.Â \r\n  The Act also revised the criminal penalties for criminal sexual conduct with a\r\n  minor, including adding the death penalty for certain repeat offenders.Â  It\r\n  also changed some of the procedures and punishment regarding electronic\r\n  monitoring of offenders.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  do not believe section 17-23-175 repealed or amended any previously existing\r\n  law as contemplated by the savings clause.Â  Instead, section 17-23-175 was an\r\n  addition to the statutory scheme that deals with the prosecution and punishment\r\n  of sexual offenders.Â  Therefore, we agree with the trial court that the savings\r\n  clause did not prohibit the application of section 17-23-175 in Bryant's case.\r\nII. Ex Post Facto Violation\r\nBryant also contends the application of section\r\n  17-23-175 constitutes an ex post facto violation making the admission of\r\n  the videotaped interviews error.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of an ex post facto clause is to prevent lawmakers from passing\r\n  &quot;arbitrary or vindictive legislation.&quot; Â Miller v. Florida, 482\r\n  U.S. 423, 429 (1987) (citations omitted).Â  An ex post facto clause also\r\n  ensures that legislative enactments &quot;give fair warning of their effect and\r\n  permit individuals to rely on their meaning until explicitly changed.&quot;Â  Weaver\r\n    v. Graham, 450 U.S. 24, 28-29 (1981).Â  For a law to present an ex post\r\n      facto violation, the law must (1) be retrospective and apply to events\r\n  taking place prior to its enactment and (2) work to disadvantage the offender. Â State\r\n    v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 171, 394 S.E.2d 486, 487 (1990).\r\nThe seminal case of Calder v. Bull, 3 U.S. 386\r\n  (1798), sets forth four general categories of law that are violative of the ex\r\n    post facto clause of the United States Constitution. \r\n\r\n  1st. Every law that makes an action, done before the\r\n    passing of the law, and which was innocent when done, criminal; and punishes\r\n    such action. 2nd. Every law that aggravates a crime, or makes it greater than\r\n    it was, when committed. 3rd. Every law that changes the punishment, and\r\n    inflicts a greater punishment, than the law annexed to the crime, when\r\n    committed. 4th. Every law that alters the legal rules of evidence, and receives\r\n    less, or different, testimony, than the law required at the time of the\r\n    commission of the offence, in order to convict the offender.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 390.\r\nA\r\n  change in the law does not run afoul of the ex post facto clause if it\r\n  only affects a mode of procedure and does not alter &quot;substantial personal\r\n  rights.&quot;Â  Huiett, 302 S.C. at 171, 394 S.E.2d at 487 (quoting Miller,\r\n  482 U.S. at 430).Â  Furthermore, in order for the ex post facto clause to\r\n  be implicated, the statute at issue must be criminal or penal in purpose and\r\n  nature.Â  Id. at 172, 394 S.E.2d at 487.Â  &quot;Even though\r\n  a procedural change may have a detrimental impact on a defendant, a mere\r\n  procedural change which does not affect substantial rights is not ex post\r\n    facto.&quot;Â  Id. at 171-72, 394 S.E.2d at 487. \r\nThe\r\n  United States Supreme Court has determined changes in laws that made previously\r\n  inadmissible evidence admissible did not violate the ex post facto clause.Â  See Thompson v. Missouri, 171 U.S. 380, 386-87 (1898)\r\n  (finding application of law admitting previously inadmissible handwriting\r\n  samples did not violate ex post facto clause); Hopt v. Utah, 110\r\n  U.S. 574, 589 (1884) (holding admission of convicted felon's testimony,\r\n  inadmissible at the time homicide was committed, did not violate ex post\r\n    facto clause).\r\nOther jurisdictions that have considered the admission\r\n  of hearsay statements of child victims have reached the same conclusion.Â  See Hall v. Vargas, 608 S.E.2d 200, 202 (Ga. 2005) (holding statutory change\r\n  permitting state to introduce additional evidence in the form of hearsay\r\n  statements attributed to child victim did not present an ex post facto violation); Villalon v. State, 805 S.W.2d 588, 591-92 (Tex. Ct.

Peace, of Greenwood, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Vernon Lawton was shot and\r\n  seriously wounded as he entered the home of his former girlfriend.Â  As a result\r\n  of that incident, he was convicted of first degree burglary, possession of a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and possession of a pistol by\r\n  a person convicted of a violent crime.Â  Lawton appeals, arguing the circuit\r\n  court erred in allowing the State to cross examine him on the content of a\r\n  letter which the State failed to disclose prior to trial. Â We reverse and\r\n  remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nLawton and Toni Badger[1] were involved in a relationship during the summer of 2003.Â  Over the course of\r\n  the relationship, the couple frequented local bars and restaurants, as well as\r\n  spent time together at one another's house.Â  After a few months, trust issues\r\n  developed between the couple, and they decided to part ways.Â  Despite their\r\n  breakup, Lawton testified he would still, on occasion, buy gifts for Badger and\r\n  help her out around her trailer.Â Â Â  \r\nIn addition,\r\n  Lawton testified he would frequently visit Badger's trailer at night, even after\r\n  the couple had ended their relationship.Â  He would first drive past the\r\n  trailer, and if the outside porch light was on, park down the street and go\r\n  inside for a visit.Â  Lawton further explained it was not uncommon for him to\r\n  access Badger's trailer by reaching through the doggy-door to unlock both the\r\n  door and deadbolt.\r\nOn\r\n  the night in question, Lawton passed by Badger's trailer and saw that the front\r\n  porch light was on.Â  As he approached, Badger's dogs began barking.Â  After\r\n  first trying the door and finding it locked, Lawton reached through the\r\n  doggy-door, attempting to unlock the door so as to gain entry to the trailer.\r\nBadger, awakened by\r\n  the barking, went to her living room and saw what she believed to be an\r\n  intruder coming through the doggy-door.Â  She picked up the phone to call 911,\r\n  went back to her bedroom, grabbed her handgun, and then came back into the\r\n  doorway of her bedroom to see the intruder.Â  Badger recognized Lawton, who was,\r\n  by that time, halfway through the doggy-door.Â  Badger testified she was\r\n  initially relieved the intruder was Lawton, and placed her gun in an adjacent\r\n  chair.Â  However, while attempting to help Lawton to his feet, Badger noticed he\r\n  was carrying what appeared to be a handgun.Â  Badger asked Lawton to relinquish\r\n  the gun, but Lawton refused.Â  A struggle ensued, during which Lawton pushed\r\n  Badger into the chair where she had previously placed her handgun.Â  Badger\r\n  grabbed the handgun and shot Lawton, severely injuring his leg.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the shooting, Lawton was arrested and charged with: (1) burglary; (2) pointing\r\n  and presenting a firearm; (3) possession of a firearm during the commission of\r\n  a violent crime; and (4) possession of a firearm by a person convicted of a\r\n  crime of violence.Â  At trial, Lawton testified he frequently visited his\r\n  ex-girlfriend in this manner with her consent.Â  On cross-examination, the State\r\n  produced a letter Lawton had allegedly written to his ex-wife that contained\r\n  this sentence: Â â€œI know that my story is full of lies, but no more than hers,\r\n  mine just have to be better than hers.â€Â  Lawton immediately objected to the use\r\n  of the letter based on the State's failure to disclose it prior to trial under\r\n  Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  Specifically, Lawton argued the State was required to\r\n  produce the letter in response to his Rule 5 motion under Subsection (a)(1)(A)[2] because it qualified as a relevant written statement made by Lawton that was\r\n  within the State's control.Â  In response, the State argued the letter was not\r\n  covered under Rule 5 because it was being used for impeachment purposes. Â The circuit\r\n  court ruled the letter was admissible because it was only being used for\r\n  impeachment.\r\nFollowing\r\n  a recess, counsel for Lawton requested and received permission to flesh out his\r\n  objection to the use of the letter and to state additional grounds.Â  Counsel\r\n  then argued the letter also should have been produced in response to his Rule 5\r\n  motion under Subsection (a)(1)(C)[3],\r\n  asserting that the letter was material to Lawton's defense.Â  The circuit court found\r\n  the letter was not â€œrelevantâ€ under Subsection (a)(1)(A) but was â€œa collateral matter having to do with the\r\n  credibility of the witness,â€ and therefore allowed the State to impeach Lawton\r\n  pursuant to Rule 608, SCRE.Â  Accordingly, the court allowed the State to ask\r\n  Lawton if he had written a letter to his ex-wife that contained the quoted\r\n  sentence.Â  The jury convicted Lawton and this appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nLawton argues the circuit court erred in failing to\r\n  suppress the letter and all testimony related thereto based upon the State's\r\n  failure to comply with Rule 5, SCRCrimP,[4] asserting the letter should have been disclosed under both Subsections\r\n  (a)(1)(A) and (a)(1)(C). Â We agree the circuit court erred in failing to\r\n  suppress the letter because of the State's failure to comply with Subsection\r\n  (a)(1)(A).[5]\r\nInitially,\r\n  we note that we analyze the circuit court's ruling under an abuse of discretion\r\n  standard.Â  See State v. Landon, 370 S.C. 103, 108, 634 S.E.2d\r\n  660, 663 (2006) (holding a violation of the rule governing the disclosure of\r\n  evidence in criminal cases is not reversible error unless prejudice is shown); State\r\n    v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 625, 525 S.E.2d 246, 248-49 (2000) (stating an appellate\r\n  court shall not reverse a trial court's ruling on admissibility of evidence or\r\n  the scope of cross-examination absent a showing of abuse of discretion and\r\n  prejudice).\r\nThe circuit court stated that the letter involved the credibility of Lawton, which\r\n  was merely a collateral issue in the case and therefore not relevant within the\r\n  meaning of Subsection (a)(1)(A) of Rule 5.Â  While the court was correct that\r\n  the letter impacted on Lawton's credibility, we disagree that it was not\r\n  â€œrelevant.â€Â Â  Â According to Webster's Dictionary, the meaning of â€œrelevantâ€ is â€œhaving\r\n  a significant and demonstrable bearing on the matter at hand.&quot;[6]Â \r\n  The circuit court utilized the following definition of relevance contained in\r\n  Rule 401:Â  â€œevidence is relevant if it has any tendency to make the existence\r\n  of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more\r\n  probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401,\r\n  SCRE.Â  Under either definition, we believe the letter in question was clearly\r\n  relevant and should have been provided by the State in response to Lawton's\r\n  Rule 5 request.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  Lawton was prejudiced by the State's failure to turn over the letter before\r\n  trial.Â  Disclosure of the letter was clearly material to the preparation of\r\n  Lawton's defense because it likely would have affected his decision to testify,\r\n  a fundamental right.Â  See Seabrook\r\n    Island Prop. Owners' Ass'n v. Berger, 365 S.C. 234, 243, 616 S.E.2d 431, 436 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005) (stating the right to testify in criminal proceeding is essential to\r\n  due process, and is a fundamental right). Â There is a reasonable\r\n  probability Lawton would not have testified had he known the State possessed\r\n  such strong impeachment evidence.Â  The State's strategy in failing to disclose\r\n  the letter and instead surprising Lawton with it during cross-examination\r\n  clearly prejudiced Lawton.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the ruling of the circuit court isÂ  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.[7]\r\nSHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]At the time of the incident, Badger, who is now\r\nmarried, was Toni Harralson. \r\n[2] Rule 5(a)(1)(A)Â  provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  (A) Statement of Defendant.\r\n    Upon request by a defendant, the prosecution shall permit the defendant to\r\n    inspect and copy or photograph: any relevant written or recorded statements\r\n    made by the defendant, or copies thereof, within the possession, custody or control\r\n    of the prosecution, the existence of which is known, or by the exercise of due\r\n    diligence may become known, to the attorney for the prosecution; the substance\r\n    of any oral statement which the prosecution intends to offer in evidence at the\r\n    trial made by the defendant whether before or after arrest in response to\r\n    interrogation by any person then known to the defendant to be a prosecution\r\n    agent. \r\n\r\n[3] Rule 5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  (C)\r\n    Documents and Tangible Objects. Upon request of the defendant the prosecution\r\n    shall permit the defendant to inspect and copy books, papers, documents,\r\n    photographs, tangible objects, buildings or places, or copies or portions\r\n    thereof, which are within the possession, custody or control of the\r\n    prosecution, and which are material to the preparation of his defense or are\r\n    intended for use by the prosecution as evidence in chief at the trial, or were\r\n    obtained from or belong to the defendant.\r\n\r\n[4] We note that Lawton initially couched his objection\r\n  to the introduction of the letter in terms of a â€œRule 5 Brady motion[.]â€Â  Rule 5, SCRCP, addresses the production of â€œrelevant written or\r\n  recorded statementsâ€ while Brady dealt with the production of\r\n  exculpatory evidence.Â  See Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87\r\n  (1963) (holding prosecutorial suppression of exculpatory evidence material to\r\n  guilt or to punishment violates due process.)Â  As there is no evidence\r\n  indicating Lawtonâ€™s statement was in anyway exculpatory, the Brady rule\r\nis not at issue in this case.\r\n[5] We decline to address Lawtonâ€™s argument under Rule\r\n  5(a)(1)(C), SCRCrimP, because that issue was never ruled on by the circuit\r\n  court.Â Â Â  Wilder Corp. v.

Â Prior\r\n  to the filing of the instant matter, they were married for thirty-one years and\r\nhad three children. Â \r\nDuring the marriage, Husband worked as a salesman earning\r\n  approximately $80,000 to $130,000 per year, while Wife was the primary\r\n  caregiver of their three children.Â  In 1992-93, when their youngest child was\r\n  twelve, Wife began working part-time and eventually obtained certification from\r\n  Midlands Technical College for floral design.Â  Wife earned roughly $8.00 per\r\n  hour through her part-time employment. Â Significant assets were acquired during\r\n  Husband's higher income years which included a large home on Lake Murray, two parcels\r\n  of property, and a home in Columbia, South Carolina, purchased for the use of\r\ntheir children while attending college (the College Street property). \r\nWife filed for divorce on October 30, 2003, citing the\r\n  statutory grounds of habitual drunkenness and adultery. Â Prior to trial, a\r\n  temporary order was issued ordering Husband to pay $1,750 per month in alimony\r\n  to Wife. Â The temporary order also required Husband to provide a detailed\r\n  accounting of the proceeds received from the sale of the College Street\r\nproperty.Â Â  \r\nOn August 4, 2004, Wife claimed Husband failed to\r\n  timely account for his handling of the College Street property proceeds and\r\n  requested that Husband be held in contempt. Â After issuing a rule to show cause\r\n  on August 9, 2004, the court ultimately found Husband adequately accounted for\r\nthe funds at issue and declined to hold him in willful contempt.Â  \r\nThe underlying case was heard on February 3, 2005, and\r\n  March 10, 2005, before the Honorable Richard W. Chewning, III.Â  At the time of\r\n  the hearing, Husband was fifty-eight and was earning approximately $83,000 per\r\n  year plus benefits as a salesman.Â  Wife was fifty-four and was working\r\n  part-time earning $8 per hour at a local floral shop.Â  During the hearing,\r\n  Husband admitted to committing adultery but denied Wife's allegations of\r\n  habitual drunkenness. Â The parties stipulated to a 50/50 division of the\r\n  marital property and offered expert testimony as to the appraised value of\r\n  particular marital property.Â  Specifically, Wife asserted the appraised value\r\n  of their river home in Edisto was $105,000, while Husband offered testimony\r\n  that the appraised value of the property was $73,000.Â  The marital home, which\r\n  was listed for sale prior to the hearing, was appraised at around $700,000 and\r\nthe parties agreed to split the proceeds equally upon the sale of the home.Â Â  \r\nIn its final order dated August 1, 2005, the court granted\r\n  Wife a divorce from Husband on the statutory ground of adultery and denied\r\n  Wife's request for alimony reasoning that Wife's receipt of significant liquid\r\n  assets in concert with her ability to be employed on a full-time basis did not\r\n  warrant an award of alimony.Â  The court divided the marital estate equally[1] and concluded\r\n  that each party would be responsible for paying his or her own attorney's fees.Â \r\n  However, Husband was ordered to reimburse Wife for her private investigator's\r\n  fees and costs. Â Wife timely filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment,\r\n  which the court granted in part to correct various mathematical and scrivener's\r\nerrors. This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this court has the\r\n  authority to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102\r\n  (2005).Â  Despite this broad scope of review, we remain mindful of the findings\r\n  of the family court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses, and was in a better\r\n  position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their\r\ntestimony.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nWife argues the family court erred in failing to award\r\nalimony.Â  We agree.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion\r\n  of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Dearybury\r\n    v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002); see also McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App.\r\n  1984) (stating the decision to grant or deny alimony rests within the\r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse thereof).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs if the court's ruling is\r\n  controlled by an error of law or if the ruling is based upon findings of fact that\r\n  are without evidentiary support.Â  Sharps v. Sharps, 342 S.C. 71, 79, 535\r\nS.E.2d 913, 917 (2000). Â \r\nÂ &quot;The purpose of alimony is to provide the\r\n  ex-spouse a substitute for the support which was incident to the former marital\r\n  relationship.&quot; Â Love v. Love, 367 S.C. 493, 497, 626 S.E.2d 56, 58\r\n  (Ct. App. 2006).Â Â  &quot;Generally, alimony should place the supported spouse,\r\n  as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she enjoyed during the\r\n  marriage.&quot;Â  Craig v. Craig, 358 S.C. 548, 554, 595 S.E.2d 837, 840\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) (quoting Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d\r\n  421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001)).Â  The objective of alimony should be to insure that\r\n  the parties separate on as equal a basis as possible.Â  Patel v. Patel,\r\n  347 S.C. 281, 291, 555 S.E.2d 386, 391 (2001).Â Â Â  Thus, &quot;[i]t is the duty\r\n  of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just\r\n  if the claim is well founded.&quot;Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d\r\nat 424.Â  \r\nIn determining an award of alimony, the court is\r\n  required to consider and give weight in such proportion as it finds appropriate\r\n  to each of the following factors: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical\r\n  and emotional health of each spouse; (3) educational background of each spouse;\r\n  (4) employment history and earning potential of each spouse; (5) standard of\r\n  living established during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated\r\n  earnings of both spouses; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses and\r\n  needs of both spouses; (8) marital and nonmarital properties of the parties;\r\n  (9) custody of the children; (10) marital misconduct or fault of either or both\r\n  parties; (11) tax consequences as a result of the form of support awarded; (12)\r\n  existence and extent of any prior support obligations; and (13) such other factors\r\n  the court considers relevant.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  &quot;Fault is an appropriate factor for consideration in determining alimony\r\n  in cases where the misconduct affected the economic circumstances of the\r\n  parties or contributed to the breakup of the marriage.&quot;Â  Craig, 358\r\n  S.C. at 554, 595 S.E.2d at 841 (quoting Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448,\r\n463, 486 S.E.2d 516, 523-24 (Ct. App. 1997)).\r\nWe find the family court's denial of alimony in the\r\n  instant case was an abuse of discretion.Â  Here, the family court denied Wife's\r\n  request for alimony reasoning that Wife's receipt of significant liquid assets\r\n  in conjunction with her ability to be employed on a full-time basis would\r\n  alleviate her financial need. Â The court further found that &quot;the proximity\r\n  of the parties' net incomes does not warrant an award of alimony.&quot; Â However,\r\n  the record fails to support the family court's factual finding that the\r\n  parties' net incomes are in close proximity.Â  Rather, at the time of the final\r\n  hearing, the record indicates that Wife was working part-time earning $8 per\r\n  hour, while Husband was earning $6,912 per month plus benefits. Â By the time of\r\n  the hearing on Wife's motion to alter or amend, Wife had attained full-time\r\n  employment at the rate of $10 per hour. Â The significant disparity between incomes\r\n  is clearly evidenced by the record.Â  Accordingly, the family court based its\r\ndecision, in part, upon a finding of fact that is without evidentiary support.\r\nMoreover, the court's emphasis on the speculative date\r\n  of Husband's retirement was error.Â  Although retirement may play into the\r\n  factor of anticipated earnings, Husband was fifty-eight and gainfully employed at\r\n  the time of trial.Â  Any change in circumstances regarding Husband's retirement\r\n  may warrant a modification of alimony when that event occurs; however, consideration\r\n  of this anticipated but speculative occurrence at this time was inappropriate.[2]Â  See Rimer v. Rimer, 361 S.C. 521, 528, 605 S.E.2d 572, 576 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (&quot;[W]hen the effect of anticipated changes is not readily ascertainable,\r\n  it is inappropriate for the family court to speculate as to the effect of such\r\nanticipated changes.&quot;). Â \r\nBased upon our own view of the facts, we conclude an\r\n  award of alimony is appropriate.Â  We have considered all of the previously\r\n  cited factors regarding alimony.Â  We place significant weight in this case on five\r\n  of those factors: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) earnings of each spouse;\r\n  (3) educational background of each spouse; (4) employment history and earning\r\n  potential; and (5) marital misconduct or fault of either party.Â  The fact that\r\n  this was a thirty year marriage in which Wife spent the bulk of the marriage caring\r\n  for their children weighs heavily in favor of alimony. Â Additionally, Husband\r\n  has a college degree and over thirty years of experience in sales, while Wife is\r\n  a high school graduate and has little to no full-time work history; in this\r\n  same regard, we have noted the disparity between the incomes of Husband and\r\n  Wife.Â  While we recognize that the purpose of alimony is not to penalize one\r\n  party and reward the other, we also cannot ignore the fact that Husband\r\n  admitted to committing adultery.Â  Â Therefore, under our view of the evidence,\r\n  we find an award of alimony is warranted. Â See Patel, 347 S.C. at\r\n  291, 555 S.E.2d at 391 (stating the objective of alimony should be to insure\r\n  that the parties separate on as equal a basis as possible).Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the family court's denial of alimony and remand the matter for a\r\n  determination of an appropriate award of alimony, including retroactive alimony.\r\n  Â See Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 531, 599 S.E.2d 114, 122\r\n  (2004) (holding wife was entitled to retroactive alimony when alimony was\r\nawarded on remand).\r\nWife next asserts the court erred in failing to hold\r\nHusband in contempt.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn appeal, a decision regarding contempt is not\r\n  subject to reversal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Brandt v. Gooding,\r\n  368 S.C. 618, 627, 630 S.E.2d 259, 263 (2006).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs\r\n  if the court's ruling is controlled by an error of law or if the ruling is\r\n  based upon findings of fact that are without evidentiary support.Â  Davis v.\r\nDavis, 372 S.C. 64, 82, 641 S.E.2d 446, 455 (Ct. App. 2006). Â \r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of a\r\n  court order.Â  Bigham v. Bigham, 264 S.C. 101, 104, 212 S.E.2d 594, 596\r\n  (1975).Â  Willful disobedience requires an act to be &quot;done voluntarily and\r\n  intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with\r\n  the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that\r\n  is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.&quot;Â  Spartanburg\r\n    Co. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872,\r\n  874 (1988).Â  A party seeking a contempt finding for violation of a court order\r\n  must show the order's existence and facts establishing the other party did not\r\n  comply with the order.Â  Abate v. Abate, 377 S.C. 548, 553, 660 S.E.2d\r\n515, 518 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nWife asserts Husband's failure to provide\r\n  documentation of three accounts paid from the proceeds of the sale of the\r\n  College Street property amounted to willful contempt of the court's order for\r\n  an accounting.Â  At trial, Husband explained that he repeatedly requested\r\n  records of the accounts at issue to no avail.Â  He further explained that the\r\n  records were sent to the marital residence and that he was unable to find the\r\n  pertinent information that Wife requested.Â  In addition to his efforts to\r\n  obtain the records, Husband's testimony at trial thoroughly explained the\r\n  amounts and debts of the disputed accounts, which were accumulated prior to the\r\n  instant action to pay for the parties' expenses as well as the expenses of\r\n  their children.Â  Based on this evidence, the court found Husband adequately\r\n  explained the allocation of the proceeds of the College Street property and\r\n  concluded that the debts were marital.Â  This finding is supported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  Accordingly, the denial of a contempt finding by the court was not\r\nan abuse of discretion.\r\nTurning to the next issue on appeal, Wife asserts the\r\n  court erred in its valuation and apportionment of the marital property.Â \r\n  Specifically, Wife contests (1) the valuation of the Edisto River property, (2)\r\n  the valuation of Husband's personal property, and (3) the assignment of\r\nHusband's credit card debt as marital.Â Â  We disagree.\r\nIn making an equitable distribution of marital\r\n  property, the court must: (1) identify the marital property to be divided\r\n  between the parties; (2) determine the fair market value of the property; (3)\r\n  apportion the marital estate according to the contributions, both direct and\r\n  indirect, of each party to the acquisition of the property during the marriage,\r\n  their respective assets and incomes, and any special equities they may have in\r\n  marital assets; and (4) provide for an equitable division of the marital estate,\r\n  including the manner in which the distribution is to take place.Â  Gardner v.\r\n    Gardner, 368 S.C. 134, 136, 628 S.E.2d 37, 38 (2006).Â  Generally, marital\r\n  property subject to distribution is valued as of the date the marital\r\n  litigation is filed or commenced.Â  Id.Â Â  The court has broad discretion\r\n  in valuing marital property.Â  Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 264, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 279, 283 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  As such, &quot;[the] court may accept the\r\n  valuation of one party over another, and the court's valuation of marital\r\n  property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence\r\npresented.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nHere, the parties stipulated to a 50/50 division of\r\n  the marital assets.Â Â Â  Among the assets to be apportioned was the River House\r\n  property on Edisto River.Â  Wife asserts the court's valuation of the property\r\n  at $73,000 was an abuse of discretion.Â  Both parties offered expert testimony\r\n  from an appraiser as well as their own appraisal reports in valuing the River\r\n  House property.Â  Husband's appraiser valued the property at $73,000, and Wife's\r\n  appraiser valued the property at $105,000.Â  Despite Wife's assertion the\r\n  property is worth more based on other comparable properties in the area,\r\n  Husband's expert testified the valuation was adjusted to reflect the\r\n  differences in the comparable properties.Â  Because the court may accept one\r\n  party's valuation over another and the valuation based on Husband's appraisal\r\n  was within the evidence presented at trial, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  See Pirri, 369 S.C. at 264, 631 S.E.2d at 283 (stating the court's valuation\r\n  of marital property will be affirmed if it is within the range of evidence\r\npresented).Â  \r\nAs to Husband's personal property, Wife asserts\r\n  Husband's boat, valued at $2,500, and a DVD player, valued at $100, were\r\n  improperly excluded from the court's valuation of the marital estate.Â Â  This\r\n  issue was not ruled upon by the trial court nor was it raised in Wife's Rule\r\n  59(e) motion to alter or amend; thus, it is not preserved for our review.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359 S.C. 505, 511, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715\r\n  (2004) (stating an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review);Â  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 363 S.E.2d 413\r\n  (Ct. App. 1987) (finding husband's argument that the court erred in failing to\r\n  consider certain items in equitable distribution was not preserved for\r\n  appellate review where the issue was not raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\ncourt). \r\nAs to the credit card debt in connection with the\r\n  disputed funds from the College Street property, this issue was discussed in\r\n  regard to the contempt finding above. Â As noted, there is sufficient evidence\r\n  in the record to support the finding that these debts were marital.Â  Husband's\r\n  testimony revealed these debts, which had been used to pay the couple's monthly\r\n  expenses as well as the expenses of their children while in college, were\r\n  accumulated over time prior to the parties' separation.Â  Additionally, despite\r\n  Wife's assertion that it cannot be presumed that the debts were incurred before\r\n  the filing of the instant action, the evidence indicated the disputed balance\r\n  transfers took place in May and August 2003, prior to Wife's filing for divorce\r\n  in October 2003.Â  The proceeds from the sale of the College Street property\r\n  were received on November 3, 2003, and the payments on the balance transfers\r\n  occurred between November 5, 2003, and November 11, 2003.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  court's inclusion of these debts as part of the marital estate was not an abuse\r\nof discretion.Â Â Â  \r\nLastly, Wife asserts the court erred in failing to\r\naward attorney's fees.Â  We agree.\r\nAn award of attorney's fees lies within the sound\r\n  discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Patel v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515, 533, 599 S.E.2d 114, 123\r\n  (2004).Â  In determining whether to award attorney's fees, the court should\r\n  consider each party's ability to pay his or her own fees, the beneficial\r\n  results obtained by counsel, the parties' respective financial conditions, and\r\n  the effect of the fee on the parties' standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nWhere the substantive results achieved by counsel are\r\n  reversed on appeal, an award of attorney's fees is subject to reversal.Â  Sexton\r\n    v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993).Â  In light of our\r\n  disposition as to alimony, the results achieved by Wife's counsel were\r\n  beneficial.Â  Accordingly, we find an award of fees is appropriate and remand\r\nthe issue to the family court for a determination of reasonable fees and costs.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\nREVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and LOCKEMY, J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] At the time of the hearing, the former marital\r\n  residence was listed for sale and Wife was entitled to the exclusive use and\r\npossession of the residence until sale.Â  \r\n[2] South Carolina law allows a supporting spouse the\r\n  right to petition the court for a reduction in alimony based upon a showing of\r\n  a material change in circumstances.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985).Â  Our\r\n  ruling does not in any way impinge upon any party's right to pursue a\r\nmodification of the alimony award based upon the requisite showing. \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
