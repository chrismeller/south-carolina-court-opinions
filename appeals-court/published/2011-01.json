Woods, Family Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4774\r\nSubmitted April 1, 2010 â€“ Filed January\r\n  19, 2011Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tPaul Fredrick LeBarron, of Charleston, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDonellivin Polite, pro se, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Donellivin Polite sought modification of\r\n  his child support payments when one of his three children reached the age of\r\n  majority.Â  After the parents agreed to a reduced amount of support for the\r\n  remaining children, the family court ordered the support be retroactively\r\n  reduced to a date prior to the filing of the modification action.Â  The South\r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) appeals.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  August 5, 2005, the DSS Child Support Division (Division) served a Notice of\r\n  Financial Responsibility upon Polite to establish his child support obligation for\r\n  his three children.Â  Polite appeared without representation at a September 2005\r\n  conference where he was ordered to pay bi-weekly support in the amount of $354\r\n  beginning September 30, 2005.Â  The eldest child turned eighteen years old on\r\n  December 17, 2005. \r\nPolite\r\n  testified his last phone call to the Division regarding modification was sometime\r\n  in June 2006, and DSS conceded Polite called at this time.Â  DSS stated a review\r\n  was not completed until September 2007, and an administrative process\r\n  negotiation was held on December 13, 2007.Â  At the negotiation, the parents\r\n  agreed to bi-weekly support payments of $304.62 for the two remaining children,\r\n  but Polite sought retroactive application.Â  The matter was continued for a\r\n  judicial hearing on January 18, 2008.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the January hearing, Polite testified he went to the Division sometime in July\r\n  2005,[1] received paperwork, and was told the Division would get back in touch with him.Â  However, Polite also stated the Division told him at that time that\r\n  he would have to &quot;come back in for a reevaluation for the oldest kid [who]\r\n  was going to turn 18 six months later.&quot;Â  Polite said the Division never\r\n  called or scheduled anything.Â  Polite, however, never stated he returned to the\r\n  Division six months later for a reevaluation as previously instructed.Â \r\n  Evidence was admitted showing the eldest child had dropped out of high school.Â \r\n  The family court stated, &quot;In light of the fact the child was not in\r\n  school, I'm going to make [the reduction] retroactive . . . the State collects\r\n  [support] for the child.Â  And if the child is not doing what he or she is\r\n  supposed to be doing, he doesn't get it.&quot;Â  \r\nDSS\r\n  objected, arguing the action was not filed until December 13, 2007, and\r\n  modification of child support is improper on amounts accrued before filing and\r\n  service of a modification action.Â  DSS further contended when there are\r\n  multiple children, the support will continue at the ordered rate unless changed\r\n  by a court order.Â  However, the family court found Polite contacted the\r\n  Division, which then told Polite it would get back to him, and the Division did\r\n  not advise him he had to file anything.Â  Although the family court found the\r\n  Division formally filed the action on December 13, 2007, it ruled the reduction\r\n  would be made retroactive to July 1, 2006. Â In doing so, the family court\r\n  stated, &quot;I'm not supposed to give [Polite] that, but I'm giving [him] a\r\n  break.&quot; \r\nDSS\r\n  filed a motion to reconsider, arguing Polite's phone call on or about July 1,\r\n  2006, did not initiate the modification action and the family court lacked\r\n  authority to retroactively modify child support that accrued before the filing\r\n  and service of a modification action.Â  DSS cited South Carolina cases and\r\n  statutes in support of its position, but the family court questioned whether\r\n  Polite, as an unrepresented lay person, had an obligation to know the legal\r\n  precedents.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court noted Polite asked to be notified of the procedures he needed to\r\n  take to reduce his payments. However, DSS did not give him the requested\r\n  notice, and Polite continued to pay the full amount of child support until the\r\n  family court's ruling.Â  The family court observed that when the family court\r\n  orders a parent to pay child support, it generally includes a provision\r\n  anticipating emancipation. Â Finding no such evidence here, the family court\r\n  called Polite's case one that &quot;slipped through the cracks.&quot;Â  The\r\n  family court questioned whether:\r\n\r\n\t[I]n\r\n  light of the overall facts of this case, should [Polite's prior phone calls]\r\n  have been sufficient to place the [Division] on notice or given them reason to\r\n  give him an answer prior to . . . January of 2007, some eighteen months after\r\n  he made his request[?]Â  Is that reasonable for him to have to pay eighteen\r\n  months of child support for failure to respond to his inquiry?Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  family court affirmed its earlier order, acknowledging Polite's ignorance of\r\n  the law was no excuse, but reasoning the Division's failure to provide Polite\r\n  with instructions worked an injustice.Â  The family court held Polite's phone call\r\n  was notice to the Division, and the Division had a duty to provide Polite with\r\n  information upon his request.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Did the family court err in\r\n  expanding the Division's duty to justify the retroactive modification?2.&nbsp; Did the family court err in\r\n  granting a retroactive modification to a time before filing and service of the\r\n  modification action?\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Carpenter\r\n    v. Burr, 381 S.C. 494, 501, 673 S.E.2d 818, 822 (Ct. App. 2009).Â \r\n  Nevertheless, this broad scope of review does not relieve the appellant of the\r\n  burden of proving the family court committed error.Â  Divine v. Robbins,\r\n  385 S.C. 23, 31, 683 S.E.2d 286, 290 (Ct. App. 2009).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; The Division's Duty in\r\n  Modification Actions\r\nDSS\r\n  argues the family court erred in finding Polite's phone call was sufficient\r\n  notice requiring action by the Division, and DSS asserts this finding expanded\r\n  the Division's duty to act.Â  DSS further argues the Division complied with its\r\n  duty under South Carolina Code section 63-17-830 (2010).Â  We agree.[2]Â  \r\nSection\r\n  63-17-830(A)[3] of the South Carolina Code (2010) provides in part:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  obligor or obligee may file a written request for modification of an order\r\n  issued under this article or an existing order of the court with the division\r\n  by serving the division by certified mail.Â  If the division does not object to\r\n  the request for modification based upon a showing of changed circumstances as\r\n  provided by law, the division shall serve the obligor with a notice of\r\n  financial responsibility . . . and shall proceed as set forth in this article.\r\n\r\nSubsection\r\n  (B) states, &quot;A request for modification made pursuant to this section does\r\n  not preclude the division from enforcing and collecting upon the existing order\r\n  pending the modification proceeding.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-17-830(B) (2010).Â \r\n  Subsection (C) explains, &quot;Only payments accruing subsequent to the\r\n  modification may be modified.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-17-830(C) (2010).Â  \r\nDSS\r\n  and the family court agreed the action was formally filed by the Division on\r\n  December 13, 2007, and the record contains no evidence of a different date of\r\n  filing and service.[4]Â \r\n  Regardless, the family court retroactively modified the child support to the stipulated\r\n  date that Polite telephoned the Division.Â  Section 63-17-830(A) plainly states\r\n  if an obligor seeks modification, the proper step is to serve the Division by\r\n  certified mail.Â  See Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640\r\n  S.E.2d 457, 459 (2007) (&quot;When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous\r\n  on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and a court must\r\n  apply the statute according to its literal meaning.&quot;).Â  Although the\r\n  family court essentially treated Polite's phone call as a filing, this decision\r\n  is contrary to section 63-17-830(A)'s mandates.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  it is regrettable Polite was unaware of proper procedure, no statute or case\r\n  law places a duty upon the Division to instruct obligors how to pursue\r\n  modification.Â  Rather, statutory law provides an obligor seeking modification may\r\n  file a written request by certified mail.Â  Affirming the family court's finding\r\n  that a phone call was notice would abandon the statute's specificity and\r\n  replace it with a casual, circumstance-driven means of initiating a\r\n  modification action.Â  Moreover, from a practical standpoint, allowing a\r\n  modification action to be commenced by a phone call, even if in good faith,\r\n  potentially opens a Pandora's box, which we find untenable.Â  Upholding a rule\r\n  of law that permits a phone call to be the official means of notice would be\r\n  difficult, if not impossible, to verify, leaving the issue of whether notice\r\n  was properly given in many instances to a swearing match.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse the family court's finding that Polite's phone call to the Division was\r\n  sufficient to initiate this modification action.\r\n2.&nbsp; Retroactive Modification\r\n  Before Time of Filing and Service\r\nDSS\r\n  argues section 63-17-310 of the South Carolina Code (2010) provides that modifications\r\n  by the family court are not effective to any installment accruing prior to\r\n  filing and service of an action for modification.[5]Â \r\n  DSS further argues the statutory bar is absolute against retroactive child\r\n  support decreases, and modifications of multi-child support orders are\r\n  prospective by court action rather than at the time of an older child's\r\n  emancipation.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  South Carolina law, a parent's obligation to pay child support generally\r\n  extends until the child reaches majority then ends by operation of law.Â  Thornton\r\n    v. Thornton, 328 S.C. 96, 109, 492 S.E.2d 86, 93 (1997).Â  The family court\r\n  has exclusive jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n\tTo make\r\n  all orders for support run until further order of the court, except that orders\r\n  for child support run until the child is eighteen years of age . . . ; or\r\n  without further order, past the age of eighteen years if the child is enrolled\r\n  and still attending high school, . . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530(A)(17)\r\n  (2010).[6]Â \r\n  Nevertheless, &quot;where one of multiple children reaches majority, a parent's\r\n  child support obligation will not be affected absent a family court order\r\n  modifying the amount of support owed.&quot;Â  Blackwell v. Fulgum, 375\r\n  S.C. 337, 343-44, 652 S.E.2d 427, 430 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  \r\n\r\n\tWhere one of multiple children becomes emancipated, the family\r\n  court does not extend the parent's support obligation on behalf of the\r\n  emancipated child. The court simply continues the existing support agreement\r\n  for the benefit of the other minor child[ren] until such time as the court,\r\n  upon request of the supporting parent, can calculate a proper reduction in the\r\n  support obligation based on a showing of changed circumstances.\r\n\r\nId. at 344, 652 S.E.2d at 430.Â  \r\nSection\r\n  63-17-310 provides that the family court has the authority to modify child\r\n  support as the court finds necessary upon a showing of changed circumstances;\r\n  however, &quot;[n]o such modification is effective as to any installment\r\n  accruing prior to filing and service of the action for modification.&quot;Â \r\n  Nonetheless, our supreme court has found family courts may award retroactive\r\n  increases of child support in special circumstances.Â  Harris v. Harris,\r\n  307 S.C. 351, 415 S.E.2d 391 (1992).Â  \r\nIn Harris,\r\n  the mother petitioned for a retroactive increase after learning the father\r\n  earned $400,000 annually for a number of years, rather than the $48,000 he\r\n  previously claimed.Â  Id. at 352-53, 415 S.E.2d at 392-93.Â  Citing\r\n  section 63-17-310, the family court believed it lacked jurisdiction to order\r\n  retroactive modifications.Â  Id. at 352, 415 S.E.2d at 392.Â  The supreme\r\n  court disagreed, finding section 63-17-310 &quot;does not bar retroactive child\r\n  support increases in special circumstances where, to do so, would result in\r\n  serious injustice.&quot;Â  Id. at 353, 415 S.E.2d at 392-93.Â  The Harris court noted the child's best interests are the family court's paramount concern.Â \r\n  The case was remanded to the family court for a determination of whether a\r\n  retroactive increase of child support should be awarded for the three years\r\n  preceding the filing for modification.Â  Id. at 354, 415 S.E.2d at 393.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, in Blackwell, a mother unilaterally reduced her child support\r\n  payments after the eldest of two children turned eighteen and graduated from\r\n  high school.Â  The father sent letters to the mother, explaining she was in\r\n  default and must seek a reduction by contacting his attorney, her attorney, or\r\n  the family court.Â  Id. at 341, 652 S.E.2d at 429.Â  The mother did not\r\n  respond.Â  Approximately eighteen months later, the father filed a rule to show\r\n  cause motion, and the mother failed to appear at the subsequent hearing.Â  Id. at 342, 652 S.E.2d at 429.Â  Ultimately, the family court held the mother was\r\n  not entitled to unilaterally reduce her child support payments and was\r\n  responsible for the full amount of support until the date she filed her motion for\r\n  temporary relief, approximately twenty-two months after the eldest child turned\r\n  eighteen.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  we commend Polite for continuing to make timely child support payments in\r\n  compliance with the child support order, we find Harris had more\r\n  compelling circumstances and its holding was limited to special circumstances.Â \r\n  Here, the family court's ruling was not similarly driven by a child's best\r\n  interests; rather, the family court feared a strict application of the relevant\r\n  statutes would work an injustice on Polite.Â  However, Blackwell instructs that an existing support agreement continues for the benefit of other\r\n  minor children until the court calculates a proper reduction.Â  Because Polite's\r\n  minor children continued to benefit during this time, we find the rationale\r\n  espoused in Blackwell controlling in this situation.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the family court improperly awarded a retroactive reduction of child\r\n  support.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the family court's decision is\r\nREVERSED.[7]\r\nSHORT,\r\n  J., concurs.Â  LOCKEMY, J.,\r\n    dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nLOCKEMY,\r\n  J.: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my\r\n  view, limited to the facts of this case, the Division put upon itself a\r\n  commitment to assist Polite in properly seeking modification.Â  Polite first encountered\r\n  the Division when it served him with Notice of Financial Responsibility to\r\n  establish support for his three children.Â  Polite appeared without\r\n  representation at a conference with the Division and signed an administrative\r\n  process order requiring him to pay support.Â  Polite expressed his concern that\r\n  his oldest child would reach the age of eighteen four months later.Â  Polite\r\n  testified the Division promised to contact him to reevaluate his support\r\n  obligation after his oldest child turned eighteen.Â  As Judge Woods noted, if\r\n  this matter was handled in court, the support order would have likely provided\r\n  for an automatic reduction in Polite's support obligation upon the oldest\r\n  child's eighteenth birthday.\r\nDespite\r\n  its assurance, the Division failed to contact Polite after his oldest child\r\n  reached the age of eighteen and Polite telephoned the Division on several\r\n  occasions seeking assistance.Â  Judge Woods found that during Polite's last call\r\n  in June or July 2006, Polite asked the Division what steps to take in order to\r\n  have his support obligation modified and the Division informed him it would\r\n  contact him at a later date.Â  Based upon the Division's control of the\r\n  situation since the beginning, and its assurances it would handle the\r\n  modification, Polite reasonably relied on the Division to assist him in seeking\r\n  modification.\r\nPolite\r\n  is pro se and has been since this action began.Â  Polite has always complied\r\n  with the Division's instructions.Â  Unlike the mother in Blackwell v. Fulgum,\r\n  375 S.C. 337, 652 S.E.2d 427 (Ct. App. 2007), he did not unilaterally reduce\r\n  his support payments and continued to pay the full amount of his support\r\n  obligation.Â  Judge Woods correctly observed if Polite unilaterally reduced his\r\n  support obligation like the mother in Blackwell, he may have\r\n  successfully reduced his support obligation earlier because the family court\r\n  would have likely ordered him to appear on a rule to show cause.Â  In fact,\r\n  Polite was not able to have his support obligation reduced until two years\r\n  after his oldest child turned eighteen.Â  Furthermore, Judge Woods also noted\r\n  because Polite continued to pay the full amount of his support obligation his\r\n  other two children were assured of receiving the appropriate amount of\r\n  support.Â  I believe Polite has suffered a serious injustice because he\r\n  reasonably relied on the Division's assurances.\r\nI do\r\n  not believe section 63-17-310 of the South Carolina Code (2010) precluded the\r\n  family court from retroactively reducing Polite's support obligation.Â  In Harris\r\n    v. Harris, 307 S.C. 351, 353, 415 S.E.2d 391, 393&nbsp;(1992), the supreme\r\n  court held section 63-17-310 does not bar a retroactive child support\r\n  modification in special circumstances where refraining from modification would\r\n  result in a serious injustice.Â  Like in Harris, refraining from\r\n  modification here results in a serious injustice.Â  The Division took it upon\r\n  itself to process Polite's request and assured him it would handle the matter.Â \r\n  As an agency of the State it assumed responsibility and Polite relied upon the\r\n  Division taking the action it assured him it would.Â  Although pro se litigants\r\n  are not entitled to special treatment, the Division was aware of Polite's\r\n  reliance and failed to inform him of the proper way to seek modification.\r\nI\r\n  agree with the majority that a phone call is not sufficient to meet the\r\n  standard for notifying the Division of a request to seek modification in\r\n  section 63-17-830(A) of the South Carolina Code (2010).Â  However, where an\r\n  agency of the State, tasked with administering a statute, assures a person seeking\r\n  access to justice that it will assist in properly complying with that statute,\r\n  it is a serious injustice to allow that agency to use the statute as a shield\r\n  to protect itself against its failure to follow through on its promise.Â  \r\nJudge\r\n  Woods held two thorough hearings on this matter, determined the credibility of\r\n  the witnesses, weighed all the evidence, and determined Polite &quot;should not\r\n  be punished for following the procedures of the Division and the delay that\r\n  [that] caused.&quot;Â  Although Judge Woods acknowledged under normal\r\n  circumstances it may be improper to give Polite credit, he recognized the delay\r\n  of &quot;bureaucracy at work&quot; created special circumstances in Polite's\r\n  case and acted accordingly.Â  For these reasons, I would affirm the family court's\r\n  decision to credit Polite the amount he over paid from July 1, 2006.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We note a discrepancy in Polite's testimony as he\r\n  testified he first called the Division in July 2005, six months prior to the\r\n  eldest child's December 2005 birthday, but he was not served with his Notice of\r\n  Financial Responsibility until August 2005 and only began paying ordered\r\n  support in September 2005.\r\n[2] Polite did not submit a brief in response to\r\n  this appeal.\r\n[3] Â S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 63-17-830 (2010) was formerly codified as Â§ 20-7-9565 (Supp. 2007).Â  While\r\n  the Legislature has recodified this section since the filing of this action,\r\n  the substantive statutory language applicable to Polite's case remains\r\n  unchanged.\r\n[4] This finding is apparently based on the Notice of\r\n  Financial Responsibility directing Polite to appear at the December 13, 2007 conference.Â  \r\n[5]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-17-310 was previously codified\r\n  in identical language as Â§ 20-7-933 (Supp. 2007).\r\n[6] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-3-530 was previously codified as\r\n  Â§ 20-7-420 (Supp. 2007).Â  When Title 63 was enacted in 2008, the Legislature\r\n  incorporated language into 63-3-530(A)(17) that expressly permitted child\r\n  support to run past the age of eighteen, even without further court order, if\r\n  the child is enrolled and still attending high school as long as the support\r\n  does not exceed high school graduation or the end of the school year after the\r\n  child reaches nineteen years of age.Â  \r\n[7]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4775","title":"Reiss v.

Reiss (Wife) for $262,000 of the proceeds from the sale of marital property.Â \r\n  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHusband\r\n  and Wife were married in 1990.Â  During the course of their marriage, Husband\r\n  was a commercial fisherman, and the parties lived together on Kiawah Island in\r\n  Charleston County.Â  In 2005, Wife filed for divorce, alleging Husband was\r\n  involved in an adulterous relationship with Buck.\r\nIn\r\n  her complaint, Wife requested an equitable division of the couple's investment\r\n  property located on Seabrook Island (the Seabrook Property).Â  Wife alleged Husband\r\n  sold the property without her knowledge for $830,000, and sought an accounting\r\n  of the proceeds from the sale and to restrain Husband from &quot;selling,\r\n  wasting, encumbering or disposing of the proceeds as they will be part of the\r\n  equitable distribution of the marital estate.&quot;[1]Â  \r\nA\r\n  month later, Wife filed a motion for temporary relief.Â  The family court found\r\n  Husband sold the Seabrook Property in December 2004, and retained the net\r\n  proceeds of $436,000 and ordered Husband pay Wife $100,000 as an advance on the\r\n  equitable distribution.Â  The family court granted Wife leave to join Buck as a\r\n  party to the divorce pursuant to section 63-3-530(A)(19) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (2010) as a person interfering with marital rights.Â  Although properly\r\n  served, Buck failed to respond, and Wife filed a motion for default judgment\r\n  against Buck.Â  At the final hearing, the family court granted Wife's motion for\r\n  default judgment as to Buck's liability. \r\nBased\r\n  on the testimony at the final hearing the family court found Husband and Wife\r\n  purchased the Seabrook Property in 1999; however, in 2002 Wife deeded her\r\n  interest to Husband.Â  Husband sold the property in 2004 without Wife's\r\n  knowledge and used a portion of the $436,210 in proceeds to purchase a pickup\r\n  truck and pay &quot;marital and certain [] individual bills.&quot;Â  Â Husband\r\n  deposited the remaining $362,000 in a joint bank account he opened with Buck.Â \r\n  Buck then utilized the funds to aid the purchase of property located at 8\r\n  Island Drive, Paradise Island, Florida (Florida Property I).[2]Â \r\n  One day later, Buck transferred Florida Property I to PBR Holdings, Inc. for no\r\n  consideration.Â  Husband was the president/managing member and registered agent of\r\n  PBR Holdings.Â  Buck was also a managing member of PBR Holdings.\r\nOne\r\n  day after the family court issued the temporary order, PBR Holdings transferred\r\n  Florida Property I to Buck for no consideration.Â  Approximately a month later,\r\n  Buck sold Florida Property I for $750,000.Â  Buck gave Husband\r\n  $382,000â€”Husband's original investment of $362,000 plus $20,000 in equity from\r\n  the sale.[3]Â \r\n  Husband invested $20,000 into his fishing boat, paid Wife $100,000 pursuant to\r\n  the temporary order, and deposited the remaining $252,000 into a certificate of\r\n  deposit owned by Buck.Â  However, $10,000 of the proceeds remained unaccounted\r\n  for.\r\nThe\r\n  family court found Buck used some or all of the $252,000 to purchase a second\r\n  property in Florida (Florida Property II).Â  According to Husband and Buck, Buck\r\n  obtained a line of credit against Florida Property II and repaid Husband\r\n  $100,000.Â  However, neither Buck nor Husband produced any evidence of this\r\n  repayment, and the family court specifically found Husband's and Buck's testimonies\r\n  regarding the proceeds from the Seabrook Property were not credible.Â  Finally, the\r\n  family court concluded Husband's and Buck's actions were &quot;designed and\r\n  intended to deprive and to defraud [Wife] of her lawful interest in the marital\r\n  proceeds from the [Seabrook Property].&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  family court concluded the proceeds from the sale of the Seabrook Property\r\n  equaled $436,210 and credited Husband $100,000 for the advance on the equitable\r\n  distribution that he paid pursuant to the temporary order.Â  The family court\r\n  ordered &quot;$336,210[] shall be paid to [Wife] by [Husband] and [Buck] . . . provided, however, [Buck's] joint and several responsibility to return and to pay\r\n  such sum to [Wife] shall be limited to $262,000.&quot;Â  \r\nThereafter, Buck\r\n  filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment or in the alternative for a new\r\n  trial, arguing the family court's conclusion she is liable for $336,210 but\r\n  only jointly and severally liable for $262,000 is inconsistent.Â  Buck also\r\n  maintained her liability &quot;should be limited to $106,147.50 and then\r\n  further reduced by [her] payment of $100,000.&quot;Â  The family court denied Buck's\r\n  post-trial motions.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nIssue\r\n  on Appeal\r\nDid\r\n  the family court err in finding Buck was jointly and severally liable to Wife\r\n  for $262,000?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBuck\r\n  argues there is no factual or legal basis for finding she was jointly and\r\n  severally liable to Wife for $336,210 or $262,000.Â  In the alternative, Buck\r\n  maintains she is only liable for $152,000 because she repaid Husband $100,000\r\n  of the $252,000 deposited in her certificate of deposit.Â  We disagree.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal from the family court, this court has jurisdiction to correct errors of\r\n  law and find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Epperly v. Epperly, 312 S.C. 411, 414, 440 S.E.2d 884, 885\r\n  (1994).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court that saw and\r\n  heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate their\r\n  credibility.Â  Gartside v. Gartside, 383 S.C. 35, 41, 677 S.E.2d 621,\r\n  624&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).Â  Accordingly, &quot;[b]ecause [this court] lacks the\r\n  opportunity for direct observation of witnesses, it should give great deference\r\n  to the family court's findings where matters of credibility are\r\n  involved.&quot;Â  Pirayesh v. Pirayesh, 359 S.C. 284, 292, 596 S.E.2d\r\n  505, 510&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  in her brief, Buck points out the family court's order is inconsistent,\r\n  appearing to hold her and Husband jointly and severally liable for $336,210\r\n  while also limiting her liability to $262,000.Â  However, at oral argument, Wife\r\n  conceded Buck is liable for $262,000 only.Â  Accordingly, we conclude the family\r\n  court found Husband was liable to Wife for $336,210, while Buck was jointly and\r\n  severally liable for $262,000 of the $336,210.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  both Husband and Buck testified Buck repaid Husband $100,000 of the $252,000\r\n  deposited in her certificate of deposit, the family court specifically found\r\n  their testimonies were not credible.Â  Based on the credible testimony presented\r\n  at the final hearing the family court determined Buck was jointly and severally\r\n  liable for $262,000.Â  Because this is an issue of credibility, and the family\r\n  court was in a better position than this court to judge the witnesses'\r\n  credibility, we defer to the family court's finding. Â See Avery v.\r\n    Avery, 370 S.C. 304, 315, 634 S.E.2d 668, 674&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006)\r\n  (deferring to the family court's equitable distribution when issue was one of\r\n  witness credibility).Â  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is\r\nAffirmed.\r\nKonduros and \r\nGeathers, JJ., concur. Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The proceeds from this sale are the only issue in\r\n  this appeal.\r\n[2] The total purchase price of Florida Property I was\r\n  $602,000.

D. Yarborough, Jr., of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tTimothy E. Madden, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J.: On appeal, Andrew Myers (Husband)\r\n  claims the family court erred in (1) awarding Martha Myers (Wife) $3,000 in\r\n  permanent periodic alimony; (2) dividing certain assets in the marital estate;\r\n  and (3) ordering Husband to pay sixty percent of Wife's attorney's fees.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nHusband and Wife were married for nine years prior to\r\n  Wife filing for divorce.Â  This was the third marriage for both Husband and Wife,\r\n  and no children were born of the marriage.Â  As of the date of trial, Wife was\r\n  sixty-two years old and Husband was sixty-five years old.Â  \r\nDuring the parties' marriage, they lived in Husband's\r\n  home located in an upscale neighborhood in Greenville, South Carolina.Â  Wife, a\r\n  high school graduate, was a part-time teller at a local bank and earned\r\n  approximately $2,455 per month.Â  Husband was an insurance salesman and the sole\r\n  owner and operator of an insurance agency, Advanced Health Insurance Service,\r\n  Inc.Â  According to Husband's W-2 and financial declaration, he earned\r\n  approximately $7,116 per month or $85,399.20 per year.Â  As owner of his\r\n  business, Husband received other economic benefits apart from his salary, such\r\n  as rental income from his office building and expense and travel reimbursements.Â \r\n  By the parties' agreement, Wife used her salary exclusively for her own benefit\r\n  while Husband paid all the bills and their living expenses from his earnings.Â  Both\r\n  parties testified they had a comfortable lifestyle during their marriage.Â \r\n  Husband enjoyed golfing and hunting on a routine basis, and Wife's leisure\r\n  activity of choice was shopping.Â  \r\nWife testified she filed for divorce after Husband\r\n  walked out on the marriage.Â  Wife filed for separate support and maintenance\r\n  and subsequently amended her complaint to request attorney's fees as well as a\r\n  divorce based on Husband's desertion.Â  At the one-day trial, Husband moved to\r\n  amend his answer to request a divorce based on one year's continuous\r\n  separation, and Wife did not contest this motion. \r\nIn its final order, the family court granted the\r\n  parties a divorce based on one year's continuous separation.Â  The family court\r\n  found Husband's business and the parties' marital home were nonmarital assets,\r\n  but it awarded Wife a special equity interest in the amount of $19,000 based on\r\n  renovations to the house using Wife's premarital funds.Â  The court granted Wife\r\n  certain marital property, which was given to Wife by Husband during the\r\n  parties' marriage. Â Specifically, the court awarded Wife a 2001 Acura MDX\r\n  vehicle, her diamond engagement ring, a full-length fur coat, and other\r\n  furniture and personal property in Wife's possession.Â  The family court then\r\n  awarded Wife one-third of the remainder of the marital estate.Â  \r\nIn its decision to award Wife alimony, the family\r\n  court stated it considered the factors set forth in section 20-3-130 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code.Â  In setting Wife's alimony, the court found Wife's\r\n  reasonably anticipated expenses were approximately $6,000 per month based on\r\n  Wife's lifestyle during the marriage.Â  The court noted Husband's expenses were\r\n  approximately $6,000 per month but found several of these expenses were\r\n  &quot;double counted&quot; because Husband reimbursed himself for those\r\n  expenses through his business. Â As a result, the family court found Husband's\r\n  income was closer to $100,000; thus, he could afford to contribute towards\r\n  maintaining Wife's lifestyle and consequently awarded Wife $3,000 per month in\r\n  permanent periodic alimony.\r\nHusband filed a\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, which the family court denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  appeals from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi v.\r\n    Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. 182, 189, 612 S.E.2d 707, 711 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to disregard\r\n  the family court's findings.Â  Id. at 189-90, 612 S.E.2d at 711. When\r\n  evidence is disputed, the appellate court may adhere to the findings of the\r\n  family court, who saw and heard the witnesses.Â  Id. at 190, 612 S.E.2d\r\n  at 711.Â  The family court was in a superior position to judge the witnesses'\r\n  demeanor and veracity and, therefore, its findings should be given broad\r\n  discretion.Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, 157\r\n  (1996).Â  Moreover, the court's broad scope of review does not relieve the\r\n  appellant of the burden of proving to this court that the family court\r\n  committed error.Â  Nasser-Moghaddassi, 364 S.C. at 190, 612 S.E.2d at 711.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Alimony\r\nHusband\r\n  does not argue Wife should not receive any alimony; rather, he contends the\r\n  family court's award of alimony to Wife was excessive.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nAn award of alimony rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  family court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion. Â Dearybury\r\n    v. Dearybury, 351 S.C. 278, 282, 569 S.E.2d 367, 369 (2002).Â  Generally,\r\n  alimony should place the supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the\r\n  same position he or she enjoyed during the marriage. Â Craig v. Craig,\r\n  365 S.C. 285, 292, 617 S.E.2d 359, 362 (2005). Â However, alimony should not &quot;serve\r\n  as a disincentive for spouses to improve their employment potential or to\r\n  dissuade them from providing, to the extent possible, for their own support.&quot;\r\n  Â McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 599, 506 S.E.2d 1, 9 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\n  Â Thus, &quot;[i]t is the duty of the family court to make an alimony award that\r\n  is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.&quot; Â Allen v.\r\n    Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 184, 554 S.E.2d 421, 424 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nWhen awarding alimony, the family court considers the following\r\n  factors: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional health of the\r\n  parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment history and\r\n  earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the parties; (7)\r\n  current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) marital and\r\n  nonmarital properties of the parties; (9) custody of children; (10) marital\r\n  misconduct or fault; (11) tax consequences; (12) prior support obligations; and\r\n  (13) other factors the court considers relevant. Â S.C. Code Â§ 20-3-130(C)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  No one factor is dispositive.Â  Allen, 347 S.C. at 184,\r\n  554 S.E.2d at 425.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  awarding Wife alimony, the family court stated it considered the relevant statutory factors from section\r\n  20-3-130(C).Â  Specifically, the court noted the following in finding Wife was\r\n  entitled to alimony: the parties' current and reasonably anticipated expenses;\r\n  the needs of both parties; the standard of living established during the\r\n  marriage; and the tax consequences of the alimony award on Husband and Wife.Â  \r\nDespite the family court's findings, we find its award of alimony\r\n  to Wife was excessive.Â  Wife claimed she had monthly expenses of $6,000, but a\r\n  review of her financial declaration reveals that many of her expenses were\r\n  inflated for purposes of calculating Wife's entitlement to alimony.Â  For\r\n  example, Wife claimed she spent $2,300 per month on clothing, entertainment,\r\n  trips, clubs, hair care, cosmetics, pet care,[1] nails, tanning, and gifts. Further, despite having no children or dependents\r\n  living in Wife's home, she claimed almost $1,000 per month for &quot;food and\r\n  household supplies.&quot;Â  When questioned about this expense at trial, Wife\r\n  admitted she actually only spent $400 per month on food, and many of the other\r\n  household expenses were one-time expenditures associated with settling into her\r\n  new home.Â  \r\nThe record indicates the parties enjoyed a comfortable standard of\r\n  living during their marriage, but these expenditures are overstated.Â  While\r\n  Wife is entitled to a reasonable amount of alimony, it is error to award her\r\n  permanent alimony substantially in excess of her needs.Â  See McElveen,\r\n  332 S.C. at 600, 506 S.E.2d at 10 (finding wife's living expenses, as stated in\r\n  her financial declaration, were unnecessarily inflated, thereby reducing Husband's monthly alimony obligation from\r\n  $11,000 per month to $7,500 per month); Brandi v. Brandi, 302 S.C. 353, 358, 396 S.E.2d 124, 127 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding\r\n  family court abused its discretion in award of alimony to wife because wife's\r\n  expenses were clearly excessive); Woodward\r\n    v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363\r\n  S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding permanent alimony of $3,000 per month\r\n  was excessive when wife had been awarded fair percentage of marital estate and\r\n  her expenses exceeded income by only about $600 per month).Â  To sustain this alimony award would\r\n  effectively penalize Husband and reward Wife. Â See Donahue v. Donahue,\r\n  299 S.C. 353, 362, 384 S.E.2d 741, 746 (1989) (Alimony &quot;is not intended to\r\n  penalize one spouse while rewarding the other.&quot;).Â Â  \r\nIn support of its award, the family court noted Husband's expenses\r\n  were slightly more than $6,000 but apparently discounted these expenses by\r\n  finding Husband &quot;double counted&quot; his house insurance and was\r\n  reimbursed by his business for his automobile payment and automobile expenses.Â \r\n  However, Husband noted on his declaration that his house insurance was included\r\n  in his loan payment and expressly deducted his house insurance from his monthly\r\n  expenses.Â  Furthermore, even if we exclude the automobile expenses from\r\n  Husband's declaration, an award of this size is unfairly structured in Wife's\r\n  favor, particularly when other factors militate against a $3,000 monthly\r\n  alimony award.Â  See Allen, 347 S.C. at 184, 554 S.E.2d at 424\r\n  (&quot;It is the duty of the family court to make an alimony award that is fit,\r\n  equitable, and just if the claim is well founded.&quot;).Â  \r\nSpecifically, the following relevant evidence supports this\r\n  conclusion: (1) Wife and Husband's marriage was not a long-term marriage; (2)\r\n  the parties were granted a no-fault divorce; (3) it was each party's third\r\n  marriage; (4) no children were born of the marriage; (5) both parties were employed\r\n  throughout the marriage; and (6) Wife maintained a comfortable lifestyle prior\r\n  to the parties' marriage as illustrated by her waterfront home and the savings\r\n  and investments she had accrued prior to the parties' marriage.Â  We find\r\n  precedent is in accord with our decision.Â  See, e.g., Hatfield v.\r\n    Hatfield, 327 S.C. 360, 364-65, 489 S.E.2d 212, 215 (Ct. App. 1997)\r\n  (denying wife alimony when it was both parties' fourth marriage, the marriage\r\n  lasted for nine years, husband was seventy-one and wife was fifty-seven, wife\r\n  was a part-time bank teller, and husband was a retired aircraft mechanic); Lassiter\r\n    v. Lassiter, 289 S.C. 341, 343 n.1, 345 S.E.2d 504, 505 n.1 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986), rev'd in part on other grounds, 291 S.C. 136, 352 S.E.2d 486\r\n  (1987) (affirming denial of alimony to wife when it was wife's third marriage\r\n  and both parties worked); Eagerton v. Eagerton, 285 S.C. 279, 284, 328\r\n  S.E.2d 912, 915 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding rehabilitative alimony in the amount\r\n  of $2,500 for a period of three years as opposed to permanent alimony was\r\n  appropriate, despite wife's extravagant lifestyle during the marriage when parties\r\n  were married for only four-and-a-half years, wife had a four-year degree, no\r\n  children were born of the marriage, and wife retained substantial personal\r\n  property given to her by husband during the marriage).Â  \r\nOur decision should not be construed to hold that a $3,000 monthly\r\n  alimony award is always excessive as we have upheld similar amounts when\r\n  circumstances warranted such an award.Â  See Craig, 365 S.C. at 292,\r\n  617 S.E.2d at 362 (upholding $3,000 permanent periodic alimony when parties\r\n  were married for twenty-five years, they had a high standard of living, and\r\n  husband's infidelity led to the break-up of the marriage); Rimer v. Rimer,\r\n  361 S.C. 521, 523, 605 S.E.2d 572, 573 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding $2,600\r\n  permanent periodic alimony award to wife was not excessive when husband earned\r\n  $7,000 per month, wife earned $260 per month as a substitute teacher, wife's\r\n  monthly expenses were $3,500, and parties were married for twenty-five years); Mallett\r\n    v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 148-49, 473 S.E.2d 804, 809 (Ct. App. 1996)\r\n  (increasing alimony award to $6,300 when parties were married for seventeen\r\n  years, the parties enjoyed a very affluent lifestyle, wife had only been\r\n  employed for four years of the marriage, and the parties' son would benefit\r\n  from wife staying at home).Â  \r\nAfter a careful review of Wife's financial declaration and monthly\r\n  expenses, we reduce Wife's alimony from $3,000 per month to $2,000 per month.Â  We\r\n  hold this alimony award sufficiently covers Wife's living expenses and is\r\n  proper and reasonable under the circumstances.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Equitable Division\r\nNext,\r\n  Husband contests the family court's division of certain assets.Â  Specifically,\r\n  Husband claims the family court erred in (1) awarding three substantial marital\r\n  assets to Wife without accounting for their value in Wife's one-third share of\r\n  the marital estate; (2) finding Husband's F-150 truck was a marital asset when\r\n  it was exclusively purchased with Husband's inheritance from his father; and\r\n  (3) finding the money in Husband's First Citizens bank account to be all\r\n  marital property.Â  We address each argument in turn.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  division of marital property is within the family court's discretion and will\r\n  not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Craig,\r\n  365 S.C. at 290, 617 S.E.2d at 361.Â  &quot;An appellate court should approach\r\n  an equitable division award with a presumption that the family court acted\r\n  within its broad discretion.&quot; Â Dawkins v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169,\r\n  172, 687 S.E.2d 52, 53 (2010). Â The appellate court looks to the overall\r\n  fairness of the apportionment. Â Deidun v. Deidun, 362 S.C. 47, 58, 606\r\n  S.E.2d 489, 495 (Ct. App. 2004). Â If the end result is equitable, the fact that\r\n  the appellate court would have arrived at a different apportionment is\r\n  irrelevant. Â Id.\r\n1.&nbsp; Division of the Acura,\r\n  Wife's Engagement Ring, and Wife's Fur Coat\r\nFirst,\r\n  Husband contends the family court erred when it awarded Wife the Acura, her\r\n  diamond engagement ring, and her fur coat but failed to account for those items\r\n  in its overall apportionment of the marital estate.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  apportioning the marital estate, the family court was required to divide the\r\n  Acura, the ring, and the fur coat because those items were purchased by Husband\r\n  for Wife during the parties' marriage and thus were marital property.[2] Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-630 (Supp. 2009) (stating marital property is &quot;all real and personal\r\n  property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which\r\n  is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . .&quot;).\r\n  Â Because of the indivisible nature of those assets and Husband's testimony that\r\n  he bought those items for Wife's use, the family court was within its\r\n  discretion to apportion those assets entirely to Wife.Â  See Marsh v.\r\n    Marsh, 313 S.C. 42, 46, 437 S.E.2d 34, 36 (1993) (&quot;[T]he family court [has]\r\n  the flexibility to view each case based on the individual circumstances\r\n  peculiar to the parties involved and to fashion a division of the parties'\r\n  assets in a manner that is uniquely fair to the parties concerned.&quot;).Â  \r\nAwarding\r\n  those assets entirely to Wife results in Wife receiving greater than a one-third\r\n  share of the marital estate, but we do not view this outcome as reversible\r\n  error.Â  We find the family court intended to apportion Wife more than one-third\r\n  of the estate, and it effectuated the division by awarding Wife the Acura,\r\n  ring, and fur coat and then awarding her additional assets that represented one-third\r\n  of the marital estate's value.Â  This finding is supported by the family court's\r\n  final order, which stated, &quot;Although marital property, Husband intended\r\n  Wife to receive these items [Acura, ring, and coat] and they should be\r\n  apportioned one hundred (100%) percent to [Wife].Â  Wife should receive about\r\n  thirty-three (33%) percent of the other marital assets.&quot; (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  family court valued the Acura, ring, and fur coat at $22,200, which represented\r\n  roughly fifteen percent of the marital estate's value of $148,513.08.Â  Adding\r\n  those assets to Wife's one-third portion of the estate resulted in Wife\r\n  receiving approximately forty-eight percent of the marital estate.Â  While this\r\n  award is generous considering the length of the parties' marriage and Wife's\r\n  direct contributions to the marital estate, we do not find this division\r\n  amounted to an abuse of discretion.Â  Because the end result is equitable, we\r\n  affirm the family court on this issue.Â  See Deidun, 362 S.C. at\r\n  58, 606 S.E.2d at 495 (&quot;If the end result is equitable, it is irrelevant\r\n  that the appellate court would have arrived at a different\r\n  apportionment.&quot;).Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Husband's F-150 Truck\r\nNext,\r\n  Husband claims the family court erred in classifying his F-150 truck as a\r\n  marital asset because it was purchased solely with inheritance from his\r\n  father.Â  We agree.\r\nSection\r\n  20-3-630 defines marital property as &quot;all real and personal property which\r\n  has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of\r\n  the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . regardless of\r\n  how legal title is held . . . .&quot;Â  However, &quot;property acquired by\r\n  either party by inheritance, devise, bequest, or gift from a party other than\r\n  the spouse&quot; is exempted as marital property under section 20-3-630.Â  See Â§ 20-3-630(A)(1).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  nonmarital character of inherited property may be lost if &quot;the property\r\n  becomes so commingled as to be untraceable; is utilized by the parties in\r\n  support of the marriage; or is titled jointly or otherwise utilized in such manner as to evidence an\r\n  intent by the parties to make it marital property.&quot;Â  Hussey v. Hussey,\r\n  280 S.C. 418, 423, 312 S.E.2d 267, 270-71 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The phrase &quot;so\r\n  commingled as to be untraceable&quot; is important because the mere commingling\r\n  of funds does not automatically make them marital funds.Â  Wannamaker v.\r\n    Wannamaker, 305 S.C. 36, 40, 406 S.E.2d 180, 182 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nWife\r\n  contends the F-150 truck was purchased with funds from the parties' joint\r\n  checking account, which automatically rendered the truck a marital asset.Â  We\r\n  find Wife's assertion is misplaced because even if the inheritance was\r\n  deposited into the parties' joint account, this does not automatically render\r\n  the inherited funds or the F-150 truck to be marital property.Â  See Miller\r\n    v. Miller, 293 S.C. 69, 71, 358 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987) (&quot;An unearned\r\n  asset that is derived directly from nonmarital property also remains separate\r\n  unless transmuted, as does property acquired in exchange for nonmarital\r\n  property.&quot;).\r\nWhen\r\n  questioned at trial, Wife admitted Husband told her that he purchased the truck\r\n  with his inheritance.Â  However, Wife stated that she included the truck on her\r\n  financial declaration because she did not know whether Husband bought it with\r\n  his inheritance &quot;for sure.&quot;Â  Wife's testimony is inadequate in light\r\n  of Husband's testimony that he purchased the truck with nonmarital funds.Â  See Wannamaker, 305 S.C. at 39, 406 S.E.2d at 182 Â (holding that to show\r\n  transmutation, the spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective\r\n  evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties regarded the property\r\n  as the common property of the marriage).Â  Specifically, Husband testified at\r\n  trial that he deposited a $64,000 check from his father's estate and then wrote\r\n  a check for the F-150 less than twenty-four hours after he made this deposit.Â \r\n  This testimony was corroborated by the parties' asset sheet submitted to the\r\n  family court.Â  Because Husband was the only party who ever withdrew or\r\n  deposited funds into this account, and the transaction for the truck occurred\r\n  within twenty-four hours of the inheritance funds being placed in the account,\r\n  Wife failed to establish that these funds were so commingled as to be\r\n  &quot;untraceable.&quot; Â See id., 305 S.C. at 40, 406\r\n  S.E.2d at 183 (holding that although money used to purchase stocks was\r\n  commingled in same account with funds used for marital purposes, the stock\r\n  money was accounted for and thus traceable); see also Brooks v.\r\n    Brooks, 289 S.C. 352, 355, 345 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App. 1986) (finding\r\n  $16,000 inheritance that was partially used for marital purposes did not render\r\n  the remaining $10,000 marital property because using a portion of an\r\n  inheritance in furtherance of the marriage does not result in the entire sum\r\n  losing its independent status).Â  Accordingly, we reverse the family court's\r\n  inclusion of this asset in the marital estate.[3] Â \r\n3.&nbsp; First Citizens Bank Account\r\nLast,\r\n  Husband claims the family court erred in finding the First Citizens bank\r\n  account was a marital asset.Â  This issue is not preserved for our review\r\n  because Husband failed to raise any issues regarding the family court's classification\r\n  of this account in his Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  See Doe v. Doe,\r\n  370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 55 (Ct. App. 2006) (holding that the wife's\r\n  argument regarding the family court's identification and valuation of marital\r\n  property was not preserved for appellate review because she failed to point out\r\n  the alleged error to the family court in her Rule 59(e) motion); see also Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 609 S.E.2d 821 (Ct. App. 2005) (finding\r\n  wife's failure to raise family court's exclusion of parcel of land from marital\r\n  estate in a Rule 59(e) motion precluded review of the issue on appeal).Â  Â \r\nIII.&nbsp; Attorney's Fees\r\nLast,\r\n  Husband argues the family court erred in requiring Husband to pay sixty percent\r\n  of Wife's attorney's fees.Â  We agree in part.\r\n&quot;An\r\n  award of attorney's fees and costs is a discretionary matter not to be\r\n  overturned absent abuse by the trial court.&quot; Â Donahue, 299 S.C. at\r\n  365, 384 S.E.2d at 748.Â  However, it is not improper for this court to reverse\r\n  an attorney's fees award when the substantive results achieved by trial counsel\r\n  are reversed on appeal.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501,\r\n  503-04, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666 (1993).\r\nIn\r\n  order to award attorney's fees, a court should consider several factors\r\n  including: (1) ability of the party to pay the fees; (2) beneficial results\r\n  obtained; (3) financial conditions of the parties; and (4) the effect a fee\r\n  award will have on the party's standard of living. Â E.D.M. v. T.A.M.,\r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  In determining the amount of\r\n  attorney's fees, the family court should consider the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the services rendered, the time necessarily devoted to the case,\r\n  the professional standing of counsel, the contingency of compensation, the\r\n  beneficial results obtained, and the customary legal fees for similar services.\r\n  Â Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991).\r\nAt\r\n  the final hearing, Wife's attorney submitted a fee affidavit documenting fees\r\n  and costs of $42,957.Â  Citing to Glasscock in its final order, the\r\n  family court required Husband to pay sixty percent of Wife's attorney's fees\r\n  for a total of $25,774.20.Â  In requiring Husband to pay this amount, the family\r\n  court analyzed each factor from Glasscock.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find an adjustment of Wife's entitlement to attorney's fees is merited because\r\n  our decision to decrease Husband's alimony obligation to Wife and exclude the\r\n  F-150 truck from the marital estate diminishes Wife's beneficial results.Â  Thus,\r\n  we modify the family court's decision and order Husband to pay fifty percent of\r\n  Wife's attorney's fees.Â  Our decision to require Husband to still contribute towards\r\n  Wife's attorney's fees is three-fold. First, despite Husband's success on many\r\n  issues, Wife obtained beneficial results regarding her share of the marital\r\n  estate and her special equity interest in the home.Â  See Golden v.\r\n    Gallardo, 295 S.C. 393, 395, 368 S.E.2d 684, 685 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding\r\n  the family court properly awarded the mother a portion of her fees and costs in\r\n  suit brought by father to enforce visitation rights when both parties prevailed\r\n  on some issues).Â  Second, although we modify Husband's alimony obligation to\r\n  Wife, Husband is still responsible for paying Wife permanent periodic alimony,\r\n  which we view as a partial success for both parties.Â  Third, as noted by the\r\n  family court, Husband has a greater income than Wife and greater nonmarital\r\n  wealth. Thus, contributing towards Wife's fees will have less of an effect on\r\n  Husband's standard of living than it will on that of Wife.Â  Taking these\r\n  factors into consideration, we modify the family court's order and require\r\n  Husband to pay $21,478.50 towards Wife's attorney's fees. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the family court's order is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED IN PART, and REVERSED IN PART.\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT, J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wife claimed she spent $185 per month in pet care, despite Husband\r\n  having custody of the parties' dog during the pendency of this action and being\r\n  awarded the dog in the final order.Â  \r\n[2] We note our courts have previously found engagement rings to be\r\n  nonmarital property.Â  See McClerin v. McClerin, 310 S.C. 99, 104,\r\n  425 S.E.2d 476, 478 (Ct. App. 1992) (finding engagement ring given to wife\r\n  before wedding ceremony was nonmarital property of the wife).Â  However, Wife\r\n  never argued the nature of the ring rendered it nonmarital property, so we\r\n  express no opinion on the propriety of its inclusion in the marital estate.Â  \r\n[3] Excluding the truck from the marital estate decreases the estate's\r\n  value to $111,688.08, which excludes the fur coat, Acura, and ring that were\r\n  awarded solely to Wife as part of her share of the marital estate.Â  The family\r\n  court awarded Wife one-third interest in the &quot;other marital assets,&quot;\r\n  which included the F-150 truck valued at $14,625.Â  Her one-third interest in\r\n  the truck would have been $4,826.25.Â  Because we refund this amount to Husband,\r\n  Husband now owes Wife $1,911.75 in cash instead of the $6,738 owed to Wife\r\n  pursuant to the family court's final order.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4777","title":"Matute v.

Chase and Carmelo B. Sammataro, both of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J.: Alba Matute (Matute) appeals the\r\n  appellate panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission's (appellate panel)\r\n  decision to deny her benefits after she fell on the sidewalk outside Palmetto\r\n  Health Baptist Hospital (Palmetto Baptist) and broke her wrist.Â  Matute claims\r\n  the appellate panel erred in reversing the single commissioner's decision to\r\n  award her temporary total disability benefits and causally related medical\r\n  treatment on two grounds: (1) Palmetto Baptist failed to timely appeal the\r\n  single commissioner's order; and (2) Matute established she suffered a\r\n  compensable work-related injury.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAt the time of Matute's injury, she was fifty-three\r\n  years old and had been a resident of the United States for nineteen years.Â  She\r\n  emigrated from Honduras to Miami, Florida, and subsequently moved with her\r\n  husband to Columbia, South Carolina, more than six years ago.Â  Since residing\r\n  in Columbia, Matute has worked in the housekeeping department at Palmetto\r\n  Baptist.Â  \r\nOn March 20, 2008, Matute completed her shift at\r\n  Palmetto Baptist, clocked out, and approximately ten minutes later, she exited\r\n  the emergency room lobby onto Sumter Street.Â  After turning right onto Sumter\r\n  Street, Matute fell on the sidewalk and broke her right wrist.Â  She testified\r\n  it was &quot;an unexpected stumble,&quot; and she fell because she\r\n  &quot;brushed the end of the shoe one against the other.&quot;Â  At the hearing\r\n  before the single commissioner, Matute stated the sidewalk was level and\r\n  free of defects.Â  When questioned, Matute testified her route out of Palmetto\r\n  Baptist was neither the exclusive nor required means of ingress and egress, but\r\n  she typically used that exit because the bus stop was located across the street\r\n  from that exit.Â  On the day of her accident, she was not taking the bus\r\n  home.Â  Matute subsequently returned to work and resumed using the same exit.Â  \r\nAfter her accident, Matute timely filed a Form 50, requesting a hearing and seeking temporary total\r\n  disability benefits as well as medical treatment for her right wrist.Â  Palmetto\r\n  Baptist responded with a Form 51, denying Matute suffered a compensable\r\n  work-related injury.Â  After a hearing on August 15, 2008, the single\r\n  commissioner found Matute's injury was compensable on the ground that she\r\n  injured herself within a reasonable time and distance after her shift ended.Â \r\n  The single commissioner issued a written order bearing a &quot;received&quot;\r\n  stamp dated September 22, 2008, and a certificate of service stamp dated\r\n  September 24, 2008.Â  Palmetto Baptist asserted it never received the order on\r\n  that date and was not in receipt of the order until it inquired to the single\r\n  commissioner on October 24, 2008, as to whether an order had been filed.Â  After\r\n  receiving the order by facsimile, Palmetto Baptist promptly filed a Form 30 to\r\n  request commission review on October 28, 2008.Â  Palmetto Baptist's appeal was\r\n  administratively dismissed because its appeal was filed outside the\r\n  fourteen-day appeal period prescribed by South Carolina Code of Regulations\r\n  67-701(A) (Supp. 2009).Â  \r\nPalmetto\r\n  Baptist appealed, and the full commission of the Workers' Compensation\r\n  Commission (full commission)[1] found good cause existed to reinstate the appeal.Â  The appellate panel then\r\n  reversed the single commissioner on the merits, finding Matute's injury was not\r\n  compensable on three grounds: (1) Matute was not on Palmetto Baptist's premises\r\n  at the time of her injury; (2) Matute's injury did not fall within any\r\n  recognized exception to the &quot;going and coming&quot; rule; and (3) no\r\n  causal relationship existed between Matute's fall and her employment.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing an appeal from the Workers' Compensation Commission, this court may\r\n  not weigh the evidence or substitute its judgment for that of the appellate\r\n  panel as to the weight of evidence on questions of fact. Â Therrell v.\r\n    Jerry's Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 25, 633 S.E.2d 893, 894-95 (2006). Â However,\r\n  this court may reverse the appellate panel's decision if it is based on an\r\n  error of law. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n1.&nbsp; Jurisdiction to Reinstate\r\n  Appeal\r\nMatute\r\n  claims the full commission erred in reinstating Palmetto Baptist's appeal\r\n  because Palmetto Baptist failed to timely appeal the single commissioner's\r\n  decision.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tRegulation\r\n  67-701 states: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tEither\r\n  party or both may request Commission review of the Hearing Commissioner's\r\n  decision by filing the original and three copies of a Form 30, Request for\r\n  Commission Review, with the Commission's Judicial Department within fourteen\r\n  days of the day the Commissioner's order is received. . . . The Commission\r\n  will not accept for filing a Form 30 that is not postmarked or delivered to the\r\n  Commission by the fourteenth day from the date of receipt of the Hearing\r\n  Commissioner's order.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\n25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  67-701 (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added).Â  Despite the mandates of Regulation\r\n  67-701, &quot;[a]n appeal administratively dismissed by the Judicial Department\r\n  may be reinstated for a good cause upon motion to the Commission.&quot;Â  25A\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-705(H)(4) (Supp. 2009).\r\nThe full\r\n  commission's determination that Palmetto Baptist demonstrated good cause to\r\n  reinstate its appeal is supported by the record.Â  The single commissioner\r\n  received Matute's proposed order on September 22, 2008, as evidenced by the\r\n  &quot;received front desk&quot; stamp on the order.[2]Â  The certificate of service on\r\n  the order stated a copy of the order was mailed first-class to all parties on\r\n  September 24, 2008.Â  However, Palmetto Baptist claimed it never received an\r\n  order, either due to inadvertent improper service or nonservice, until it\r\n  inquired to the single commissioner on October 24, 2008.Â  Palmetto Baptist\r\n  timely filed a Form 30 four days after it received the order as required by\r\n  Regulation 67-701.Â  See Regs. 67-701 (stating a party may request\r\n  commission review &quot;within fourteen days of the day the Commissioner's\r\n  order is received&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the full commission has the discretion to reinstate an appeal pursuant to\r\n  Regulation 67-705, and Palmetto Baptist demonstrated good cause as to why it\r\n  did not file its Form 30 until October 28, 2008, the full commission was within\r\n  its discretion to reinstate Palmetto Baptist's appeal.Â  \r\n2.&nbsp; Compensability of Injury\r\nMatute\r\n  contends the appellate panel erred in reversing the single commissioner's award\r\n  because Matute suffered a compensable work-related injury.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, an employee going to or coming from the place where his work is\r\n  to be performed is not engaged in performing any service growing out of and\r\n  incidental to his employment, and, therefore, an injury sustained by accident\r\n  at such time does not arise out of and in the course of his employment. Â Gray\r\n    v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 188, 528 S.E.2d 435, 443 (Ct. App.\r\n  2000). Â However, South Carolina has recognized a number of exceptions to this\r\n  rule, including the following: (1) in going to and returning from work, the\r\n  means of transportation is provided by the employer, or the time that is\r\n  consumed is paid for or included in the wages; (2) the employee, on his way to\r\n  or from his work, is still charged with some duty or task in connection with\r\n  his employment; (3) the way used is inherently dangerous and is either the\r\n  exclusive way of ingress and egress to and from his work or constructed and\r\n  maintained by the employer; (4) the place of injury was brought within the\r\n  scope of employment by an express or implied requirement in the contract of\r\n  employment of its use by the employee in going to and coming from work; or (5)\r\n  an employee sustains an injury while performing a special task, service,\r\n  mission, or errand for his employer, even before or after customary working\r\n  hours, or on a day on which he does not ordinarily work. Â Id. at 188-89,\r\n  528 S.E.2d at 443.\r\nNone\r\n  of the exceptions to the &quot;going and coming&quot; rule apply under these\r\n  circumstances. The following evidence supports this conclusion: (1) Palmetto\r\n  Baptist did not provide Matute with transportation to and from work nor did it\r\n  pay for her transportation; (2) Matute was not fulfilling any duty or task in\r\n  connection with her employment at Palmetto Baptist when she fell; (3) Matute's\r\n  route into and out of the hospital was neither the exclusive nor the required\r\n  means of entry or exit nor was it inherently dangerous; (4) the Sumter Street\r\n  crosswalk was open to pedestrian traffic on the date of Matute's fall, but she\r\n  chose not to use the crosswalk when exiting the hospital; (5) Matute was on a public\r\n  sidewalk when she fell; and (6) Palmetto Baptist does not own, maintain, or\r\n  control the sidewalk on which Matute fell.Â  Thus, we hold the appellate panel\r\n  properly reversed the single commissioner.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the appellate panel's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., and SHORT, J., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A six-member full commission panel, exclusive of the original hearing\r\n  commissioner, determines whether good cause exists to reinstate an appeal that\r\n  has been administratively dismissed; whereas, a three-member appellate panel,\r\n  exclusive of the original hearing commissioner, reviews an order on appeal from\r\n  a single commissioner.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.

Code Ann. Â§ 12-10-20 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2009). Â To\r\n  qualify for tax incentives under the Act, businesses were required to meet the\r\n  eligibility requirements established by section 12-10-50(A)(1)-(4) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009). Â Particularly, section 12-10-50(A)(3) required\r\n  businesses to enter into a revitalization agreement with Council. Â The Act gave\r\n  Council absolute discretion in deciding whether to enter into a revitalization\r\n  agreement. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-10-60(A) (Supp. 2009). Â Â Â Although the terms of\r\n  each individual agreement differed, every revitalization agreement uniformly\r\n  required each business to create a minimum number of jobs and to make a minimum\r\n  capital investment by a certain date to claim JDCs. Â Â§ 12-10-50(A)(3); S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-10-80(A) (Supp. 2009). Â Pursuant to the Act, once a business met the\r\n  minimum job requirement and minimum capital investment set forth in the revitalization\r\n  agreement, the business was eligible to claim JDCs. Â Â§ 12-10-80(A).\r\nFACTS\r\nESA is a limited\r\n  liability company authorized to do business in South Carolina.[2] Â At some point prior to 2001, ESA began negotiations with the State of South\r\n  Carolina in an attempt to relocate its national corporate headquarters from\r\n  Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Spartanburg, South Carolina, as well as to expand\r\n  its South Carolina operations.Â  In furtherance of these negotiations, ESA\r\n  submitted an application to Council[3] on July 19, 2001, seeking approval to participate in the South Carolina\r\n  Enterprise Zone Program.Â  In its application, ESA stated it intended to build a\r\n  $13 million corporate headquarters facility as well as to create an estimated two\r\n  hundred new jobs in South Carolina.Â  \r\nOne\r\n  week after receiving ESA's application, Council sent a letter to Bill Kastler,\r\n  an accountant with Pricewaterhouse Coopers in Spartanburg, who assisted ESA in\r\n  the application process.Â  In the letter, Council stated that it approved ESA's\r\n  application &quot;with the contingency that only positions paying above $11.58\r\n  an hour would qualify for Job Development Credits.&quot; Â The letter\r\n  further stated that Council intended to enter into a final agreement with ESA\r\n  within eighteen months of the date of the original application, and ESA could\r\n  accept the terms, as outlined in the letter, by signing and returning a copy of\r\n  the letter to Council.Â  Despite Council's contention that it sent this letter\r\n  to ESA, no evidence was presented that ESA received the letter, and the\r\n  Department never established that an executed copy of the letter was signed and\r\n  returned to Council.[4] Â \r\nSubsequently, on August 15, 2002, ESA notified Council\r\n  that it would increase its capital investment from $13 million to $14.49\r\n  million and could commit to the creation of two hundred fifteen as opposed to two\r\n  hundred new jobs.Â Â  Council agreed to this increase by letter dated August 29,\r\n  2002, which also discussed wages and JDCs, but did not mention the $11.58\r\n  minimum wage contingency.Â  During the final negotiations between ESA and\r\n  Council, ESA relocated to Spartanburg, South Carolina.Â  Each party executed\r\n  their respective portion of the Agreement, and Council returned the fully\r\n  executed Agreement to ESA on July 16, 2003, with an effective date of July 19,\r\n  2001.Â  Council attached a cover letter to the Agreement, in which\r\n  Council stated that ESA could begin claiming JDCs after it had certified to\r\n  Council, in writing, that it had created the minimum two hundred fifteen\r\n  full-time jobs and had met the minimum $14.49 million capital investment.Â  No\r\n  other requirements or contingencies were stated in the cover letter.Â  \r\nThe body of the\r\n  Agreement set forth certain stipulations regarding ESA's entitlement to JDCs. Â The\r\n  Agreement specifically defined what constituted the &quot;Minimum Job\r\n  Requirement&quot; and permitted ESA to fall below the minimum requirement by\r\n  15% or exceed it by 50% and still remain eligible to claim JDCs.Â  ESA also\r\n  agreed that prior to making a claim for JDCs, it would notify Council when it\r\n  met the minimum job requirement and the minimum capital investment and would\r\n  provide all documentation Council required to verify compliance.Â  Within thirty\r\n  days of Council's satisfaction that the requirements were met, Council was\r\n  required under the Agreement to certify to the Department that ESA was eligible\r\n  to begin claiming JDCs.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Agreement also included four exhibits. Â Exhibit A, entitled &quot;Project\r\n  Details,&quot; was referred to numerous times in the Agreement and reiterated\r\n  the cover letter's requirement that ESA create a minimum of two hundred fifteen\r\n  new jobs at its headquarters and invest a minimum of $14.49 million in the\r\n  project.Â  Exhibit B, entitled &quot;Approved Employment Positions,&quot; listed\r\n  three job titles--officers, managers, and staff--with each title employing ten,\r\n  forty, and one hundred sixty-five individuals, respectively.Â Â  Within each job\r\n  title, Exhibit B set forth the wage bracket for that position with officers\r\n  earning $220,000 per year, management earning $73,000 per year, and staff\r\n  earning $30,000[5] per year. Exhibit B also delineated the estimated job development credit percentages\r\n  created by these positions.Â  Exhibit C was a blank copy of the Employer\r\n  Quarterly Report, which ESA had to file with Council to claim JDCs.Â  Exhibit D,\r\n  entitled &quot;Special Provisions and Amendments,&quot; listed several\r\n  amendments to the Agreement, but it contained no reference to a minimum wage\r\n  contingency.Â  \r\nThe Agreement\r\n  expressly stated that it, along with its attached exhibits, constituted the\r\n  entire agreement as to matters contained in the Agreement and superseded all\r\n  prior agreements and understandings, written or oral, between the parties.Â  Nowhere\r\n  in the Agreement or in the four attached exhibits did the Council or ESA\r\n  expressly define a minimum wage contingency.Â  \r\nSoon after the\r\n  parties executed the Agreement, ESA submitted documentation to Council to prove\r\n  it had met the minimum job requirement and minimum capital investment under the\r\n  Agreement.[6] Â On September 30, 2003, Council responded and informed ESA it had reviewed\r\n  ESA's documentation and approved ESA's request to claim JDCs.Â  Further, Council\r\n  stated it would begin calculating JDCs, effective October 1, 2003, and it would\r\n  notify the Department of the certification.Â  \r\nCouncil\r\n  approved ESA's first two claims for refunds.[7]Â \r\n  However, when ESA submitted a refund claim for the second quarter of 2004 for\r\n  $933,962 based upon the payment of $27,110,506 in wages to one hundred ninety eligible\r\n  employees, the Department did not issue a refund.[8]Â \r\n  Council then reviewed ESA's quarterly report and determined ESA had claimed\r\n  JDCs for some jobs that paid less than the Spartanburg per capita hourly wage\r\n  of $11.58 per hour.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Jackie Calvi, the program manager for Council's Grants Management Team, spoke\r\n  with representatives of ESA and requested ESA amend its returns to delete any\r\n  JDC claims for jobs that ESA had paid hourly wages less than $11.58.Â  However,\r\n  Calvi told ESA that all the new jobs it had created, including those paying\r\n  $11.58 or less, could be counted toward the two hundred fifteen minimum job\r\n  requirement required by the Agreement.Â  Calvi relayed this information to the\r\n  Department. Â ESA amended its returns, deleting any claims for new jobs that\r\n  paid less than $11.58 per hour.Â  The amendments resulted in excess refunds owed\r\n  to the State in the amounts of $2,833 (fourth quarter of 2003) and $3,397 (first\r\n  quarter of 2004). \r\nAfter\r\n  ESA filed its amended returns, the Department notified ESA it intended to\r\n  conduct a field audit of ESA.[9]Â \r\n  In late June 2005, Edward Barwick conducted the audit at ESA's headquarters in\r\n  Spartanburg and issued a report on September 14, 2005.Â  In his report, Barwick\r\n  found the following: (1) ESA's amendments to its quarterly returns resulted in\r\n  taxes owing to the State in the amount of $2,833 for the fourth quarter of 2003\r\n  and $3,397 for the first quarter of 2004; (2) all JDC claims should be denied\r\n  because ESA failed to create the two hundred fifteen required jobs pursuant to\r\n  the Agreement; and (3) ESA was not entitled to claim JDCs under the Agreement\r\n  because it ceased to exist as a taxpayer during the claims period.Â  \r\nESA\r\n  timely filed a protest of the findings and proposed assessment contained in the\r\n  Department's report.Â  In its final agency determination, the Department\r\n  affirmed the field auditor's findings and denied ESA's claims.Â  ESA appealed to\r\n  the ALC.Â  On October 6 and 7, 2008, the ALC conducted a hearing and\r\n  subsequently reversed the Department's denial of ESA's claims on the grounds\r\n  that ESA had fully complied with the terms of the Agreement.Â  The ALC denied\r\n  the Department's motion to reconsider, and this appeal followed.Â Â  \r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tThe Department\r\n  raises three issues on appeal:\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\t\t\tDid the ALC err in finding ESA complied with the terms\r\n  of the Agreement because the ALC failed to properly construe Exhibit B?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\t\t\tAre the ALC's findings of fact supported by\r\n  substantial evidence?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\t\t\tDid the ALC err in failing to defer to the \r\n\t\t\t\t\tDepartment's longstanding administrative practices?\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis\r\n  court's scope of review is set forth in section 1-23-610(B) of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009). Â That section provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  review of the administrative law judge's order must be confined to the record.\r\n  The court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the administrative\r\n  law judge as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. The court of\r\n  appeals may affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings; or\r\n  it may reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the\r\n  petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision\r\n  is:\r\n\t(a) in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\t(b) in\r\n  excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\t(c)\r\n  made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\t(d)\r\n  affected by other error of law;\r\n\t(e)\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence\r\n  on the whole record; or\r\n\t(f)\r\n  arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly\r\n  unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Terms of the Agreement\r\nThe\r\n  Department first contends the ALC erred in concluding ESA abided by the terms\r\n  of the Agreement when a plain reading of the Agreement demonstrates ESA was\r\n  required to create two hundred fifteen jobs paying at least $30,000 per year.Â \r\n  We disagree. \r\nWhen\r\n  a contract or agreement is clear and capable of legal construction, the court's\r\n  only function is to interpret its lawful meaning and the intent of the parties\r\n  as found within the agreement. Â Smith-Cooper v. Cooper, 344 S.C. 289,\r\n  295, 543 S.E.2d 271, 274 (Ct. App. 2001). Â However, when an agreement is\r\n  ambiguous, the court should determine the parties' intent. Â Ellie, Inc. v.\r\n    Miccichi, 358 S.C. 78, 94, 594 S.E.2d 485, 493 (Ct. App. 2004). Â A contract\r\n  is ambiguous when it is capable of more than one meaning or when its meaning is\r\n  unclear. Â Jordan v. Sec. Group, Inc., 311 S.C. 227, 230, 428 S.E.2d 705,\r\n  707 (1993).Â  &quot;Whether a contract is ambiguous is to be determined from the\r\n  entire contract and not from isolated portions of the contract.&quot;Â  Farr\r\n    v. Duke Power Co., 265 S.C. 356, 362, 218 S.E.2d 431, 433 (1975). \r\nIt\r\n  is a question of law for the court whether the language of a contract is\r\n  ambiguous. Â Hawkins v. Greenwood Dev. Corp., 328 S.C. 585, 592, 493\r\n  S.E.2d 875, 878 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  Once the court decides the language is\r\n  ambiguous, evidence may be admitted to show the intent of the parties. Â Id. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 878-79. Â The determination of the parties' intent is then\r\n  a question of fact. Â Id. at 592, 493 S.E.2d at 879. Â On the other hand,\r\n  the construction of a clear and unambiguous contract is a question of law for\r\n  the court. Â Gardner v. Mozingo, 293 S.C. 23, 25, 358 S.E.2d 390, 392\r\n  (1987).\r\nThe crux of the Department's argument is the Agreement\r\n  expressly included a wage contingency and because ESA failed to comply with\r\n  this contingency, the Department properly denied ESA's claim for JDCs.Â \r\n  Specifically, the Department highlights Exhibit B in the Agreement, entitled\r\n  &quot;Approved Employment Positions,&quot; which lists three job categories,\r\n  each having their own wage bracket.[10] Â The Department\r\n  contends the $30,000 wage bracket in Exhibit B proves ESA was required to\r\n  create two hundred fifteen positions paying at least $15 per hour to be\r\n  eligible to claim JDCs.Â  \r\nDespite the\r\n  Department's argument, we find the plain language of the Agreement is silent\r\n  regarding an established wage contingency.Â  The parties agreed upon two\r\n  material terms in their Agreement: a minimum capital investment of $14.49\r\n  million and the creation of at least two hundred fifteen jobs.Â  This conclusion\r\n  is supported by the plain language of the Agreement and its respective\r\n  exhibits. \r\nWhile\r\n  the Department urges this court to construe Exhibit B as mandating a minimum\r\n  wage contingency of $15 per hour, we find the Department's construction of\r\n  Exhibit B would require us to read a term into the contract that does not\r\n  exist.Â  Exhibit B fails to state that ESA must create the exact number of\r\n  &quot;Approved Employment Positions&quot; at the stated wage brackets to\r\n  fulfill ESA's minimum job requirement.[11] Â Moreover, the\r\n  definition of &quot;Minimum Job Requirement&quot; in the main body of the\r\n  Agreement does not reference Exhibit B and does not include any mention of a\r\n  wage contingency as a prerequisite to fulfilling the minimum job requirement.Â \r\n  If the parties intended to incorporate a minimum wage contingency as a material\r\n  term in the Agreement, we find this contingency would have been clearly set\r\n  forth and defined as such in Exhibit B or within the main body of the\r\n  Agreement.\r\nA\r\n  reading of other sections in the Agreement leads us to this same conclusion.Â  See S. Atl. Fin. Servs. Inc. v. Middleton, 356 S.C. 444, 447, 590 S.E.2d 27,\r\n  29 (2003) (finding a contract should be read as a whole document so that &quot;one\r\n  may not, by pointing out a single sentence or clause, create an ambiguity&quot;).Â \r\n  Paragraph 3.4 of the Agreement states ESA must &quot;maintain the Project\r\n  substantially as proposed in the [initial] [a]pplication and as outlined in\r\n  Exhibit A . . . .&quot;Â  Exhibit A does not mention a wage contingency, but it\r\n  does reference the minimum job requirement and minimum capital investment.Â  Additionally,\r\n  the initial application, which is also referenced in Paragraph 3.4 of the\r\n  Agreement, contains a Section K entitled, &quot;Projected New Jobs and\r\n  Payroll.&quot; (emphasis added). Â Section K from the initial application sets\r\n  forth the same job categories as Exhibit B in the Agreement and instructs ESA\r\n  to complete the section by listing the &quot;average wage per hour and estimated annual payroll for new jobs.&quot; (emphasis added).Â  While describing the\r\n  wages and payroll as &quot;average&quot; and &quot;estimated,&quot; Section K, in\r\n  no uncertain language, instructs ESA that the total number of jobs listed in\r\n  that section should reflect the minimum job requirement.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold the ALC properly determined the Agreement's plain language did not\r\n  impose a wage contingency on ESA.Â  See Silver v. Aabstract Pools\r\n    &amp; Spas, Inc., 376 S.C. 585, 591, 658 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (&quot;In construing and determining the effect of a written contract, the\r\n  intention of the parties and the meaning are gathered primarily from the\r\n  contents of the writing itself, or, as otherwise stated, from the four corners\r\n  of the instrument, and when such contract is clear and unequivocal, its meaning\r\n  must be determined by its contents alone; and a meaning cannot be given it\r\n  other than that expressed.&quot;) (internal citation and internal quotation\r\n  marks omitted).[12]\r\nESA\r\n  concedes in its brief that its interactions with Council after entering into\r\n  the Agreement modified the contract between the parties.Â  ESA claims that while\r\n  the Agreement did not state a wage contingency, ESA agreed after it submitted\r\n  its claims for JDCs to impose an $11.58 wage contingency.Â  This concession was\r\n  based on Council's assurance that although ESA's jobs paying less than $11.58\r\n  would not be included when calculating its JDCs, those jobs would still count\r\n  towards the minimum job requirement.Â  We agree and find Council and ESA's\r\n  decision to amend the Agreement to include a wage contingency was a valid\r\n  modification of the contract. \r\nWritten contracts may be orally modified by the parties, even if\r\n  the writing itself prohibits oral modification.Â  S.C. Nat'l Bank v. Silks, 295 S.C. 107, 109-10,\r\n  367 S.E.2d 421, 422 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988).Â  Any modification of a written contract must satisfy all fundamental\r\n  elements of a valid contract in order for it to be enforceable, including a\r\n  meeting of the minds between the parties with regard to all essential terms of\r\n  the agreement. Â Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 104-05, 382 S.E.2d\r\n  891, 893 (1989). Â Thus, &quot;[w]hile a written contract can be orally\r\n  modified, there must be a meeting of the minds as to the modification.&quot; Â First\r\n    Union Mortgage Corp. v. Thomas, 317 S.C. 63, 70, 451 S.E.2d 907, 912 (Ct. App.\r\n  1994).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  ESA and Council,[13] as parties to the Agreement, mutually agreed to modify the Agreement to include\r\n  an $11.58 wage contingency with the express understanding this amendment would\r\n  not affect ESA's ability to meet the minimum job requirement.Â  Both ESA and\r\n  Council testified before the ALC they were in agreement on this modification\r\n  and its effect on ESA's ability to claim JDCs for those jobs paying less than\r\n  $11.58.Â  This course of conduct between ESA and Council demonstrates they\r\n  had a &quot;meeting of the minds&quot; as to the modified terms of the\r\n  Agreement.\r\nTo\r\n  reiterate, we hold the plain language of the Agreement, including Exhibit B,\r\n  did not contain a wage contingency.Â  Despite the lack of a stated wage\r\n  contingency, we find the parties mutually agreed to orally modify the\r\n  Agreement to include the $11.58 wage contingency with the understanding this\r\n  contingency would have no effect on ESA's ability to satisfy its minimum job\r\n  requirement.Â  Accordingly, we hold the ALC properly construed Exhibit B in\r\n  concluding ESA complied with the terms of the Agreement.\r\nII.&nbsp; ALC's Findings of Fact\r\nThe\r\n  Department next argues the ALC erred as a matter of law because its findings of\r\n  fact were not based on the plain language of the Agreement, which prevented its\r\n  decision from being based on substantial evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn\r\n  an appeal from the final decision of an administrative agency, the standard of\r\n  appellate review is whether the ALC's findings are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2009). Â Although this court\r\n  shall not substitute its judgment for that of the ALC as to findings of fact,\r\n  we may reverse or modify decisions that are controlled by error of law or are\r\n  clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence on the record as a whole.\r\n  Â Id. Â In determining whether the ALC's decision is supported by\r\n  substantial evidence, this court need only find, considering the record as a\r\n  whole, evidence from which reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion\r\n  that the ALC reached. DuRant v. S.C. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control,\r\n  361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 706 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nThe\r\n  Department takes issue with several findings of fact in the ALC's order.Â \r\n  However, the Department failed to raise these discrepancies in its motion to alter\r\n  or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.Â  Because the ALC was never allowed to\r\n  clarify any discrepancies in its order, these issues are not properly before\r\n  this court on appeal. See Home Med. Sys., Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Revenue , 382 S.C. 556, 563, 677 S.E.2d 582, 586Â  (2009) (permitting Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motions in ALC proceedings); Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C.\r\n  206, 210, 467 S.E.2d 460, 463 (Ct. App. 1996) (holding issue was not preserved\r\n  on appeal when appellants never filed a motion to alter or amend the judgment\r\n  to clarify the order pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, nor sought clarification\r\n  pursuant to Rule 60(a), SCRCP); Nelums v. Cousins, 304 S.C. 306, 307-08,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 681, 681-82 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding trial court's alleged failure\r\n  to clarify discrepancies in written order was not preserved when party made no\r\n  motion to amend the judgment).Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if these issues were preserved for our review, any inaccuracies in the ALC's\r\n  findings of fact were not material and thus did not amount to prejudicial error\r\n  in view of the substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  See McCall\r\n    v. Finley, 294 S.C. 1, 4, 362 S.E.2d 26, 28 (Ct. App. 1987) (&quot;[W]hatever\r\n  doesn't make any difference, doesn't matter.&quot;).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Deference to the Department's\r\n  Administrative Practices\r\nLast,\r\n  the Department contends the ALC erred in failing to defer to the Department's\r\n  longstanding administrative practice of auditing qualifying businesses under\r\n  the Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo\r\n  resolve this issue, it is instructive to identify the role of Council, the\r\n  Department, and a qualifying business under the Act.Â  Pursuant to the Act,\r\n  &quot;the terms and provisions of each revitalization agreement must be\r\n  determined by negotiations between [C]ouncil and the qualifying business.&quot;Â \r\n  Â§ 12-10-60(A) (emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, Council may establish criteria\r\n  for the determination and selection of qualifying businesses and the approval\r\n  of Agreements. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-10-100(A) (2000).Â  &quot;The decision to\r\n  enter into a revitalization agreement with a qualifying business is solely\r\n    within the discretion of [C]ouncil based on the appropriateness of the\r\n  negotiated incentives to the project and the determination that approval of the\r\n  project is in the best interests of the State.&quot;Â  Â§ 12-10-60(A) (emphasis\r\n  added). \r\nOnce\r\n  a qualifying business has certified to Council the business has met the minimum\r\n  job requirement and minimum capital investment provided for in the\r\n  revitalization agreement, the business may claim job development credits.Â  Â§\r\n  12-10-80(A).Â  If a qualifying business claims greater than ten thousand dollars\r\n  in a calendar year, it must furnish to Council and to the Department a report\r\n  that itemizes the sources and uses of the funds.Â  Â§ 12-10-80(A)(9). Â The\r\n  Department shall audit each qualifying business with claims greater than ten\r\n  thousand dollars in a calendar year at least once every three years to verify\r\n  proper sources and uses of the funds.Â  Id.\r\nMoreover, in the\r\n  event a qualifying business fails to achieve the level of capital investment or\r\n  employment set forth in the revitalization agreement, Council may terminate the\r\n  revitalization agreement and reduce or suspend all or any part of the\r\n  incentives until the time the anticipated capital investment and employment\r\n  levels are met.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-10-90 (2000). \r\nWhile the Department\r\n  argues the ALC erred in failing to give it deference in its interpretation and\r\n  administration of the Act,[14] this issue was not before the ALC.Â  Rather, the ALC\r\n  was faced with determining whether Council and ESA had expressly agreed to a\r\n  wage contingency as part of fulfilling the minimum job requirement in the\r\n  Agreement.Â  The Legislature charged Council with the task of negotiating the\r\n  terms of the Agreement and approving ESA's project if it was in the best\r\n  interests of the State.Â  See Â§ 12-10-60.Â  Only after Council had made\r\n  that decision and executed the Agreement could the Department exercise its\r\n  authority to audit ESA and accordingly adjust ESA's entitlement to JDCs.Â  As\r\n  set forth in section 12-10-80(A)(9), the Department's duty was to ensure ESA\r\n  was properly using the JDCs by &quot;verify[ing] proper sources and uses of the\r\n  funds,&quot; and the Department never asserted ESA was not properly using the\r\n  JDCs.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court is aware the Department has the statutory authority to audit qualifying\r\n  businesses pursuant to the Act and make appropriate adjustments when a\r\n  qualifying business is not complying with the terms of its revitalization\r\n  agreement as agreed upon by Council and the business.Â  However, the Department's\r\n  authority does not extend to negotiating or interpreting the terms of a\r\n  revitalization agreement because the Act clearly assigns Council with this\r\n  responsibility.Â  See Â§Â§ 12-10-60(A), -100(A).Â  Accordingly, the ALC was\r\n  not required to defer to the Department's interpretation of the Agreement.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the ALC's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nPIEPER\r\n  and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§Â§ 12-10-10 to -110 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2009).Â  \r\n[2] During the time period that ESA sought JDCs, it was\r\n  doing business as ESA Services, Inc. and was a member of a group of publicly\r\n  traded companies that owned and/or operated extended stay lodging facilities.Â \r\n  Its parent company was Extended Stay America, Inc., and ESA was a wholly-owned\r\n  subsidiary.Â  In May 2004, ESA was purchased by the Blackstone Group and became\r\n  a private company, and while ESA changed its name and income tax status, this\r\n  had no effect on its operations or ability to qualify for JDCs.Â  ESA\r\n  subsequently merged into HVM, LLC, a sister company owned by the Blackstone\r\n  Group, and the resulting corporation, HVM, LLC withdrew any future claims for\r\n  JDCs under the Agreement.Â  Apart from the three pending claims for refunds in\r\n  this appeal, no further claims for JDCs can be made by ESA.Â  \r\n[3] Pursuant to section 1-30-25 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2009), Council is statutorily incorporated\r\n  in and administered as part of the Department of Commerce.\r\n[4] The letter was addressed to Bill Kastler, whose\r\n  office is in Spartanburg, South Carolina, but it was actually mailed to ESA's\r\n  headquarters in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. \r\n[5] Or $15.00 per hour based on a 2,000-hour work year,\r\n  exclusive of benefits. \r\n[6] At the time ESA submitted its documentation, it had\r\n  created two hundred thirty new jobs and had made a capital investment of\r\n  $14,506,927.Â  \r\n[7] ESA requested a\r\n  refund in the fourth quarter of 2003 for $136,706 and a refund in the first\r\n  quarter of 2004 for $80,623, both which were refunded in their entirety.Â  \r\n[8] The large increase in employee compensation was due\r\n  to the exercise of employee stock options for approximately sixteen executives.\r\n[9] A field audit is permissible pursuant to section 12-10-80(A)(9)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009), which states, &quot;The department\r\n  shall audit each qualifying business with claims in excess of ten thousand\r\n  dollars in a calendar year at least once every three years to verify proper\r\n  sources and uses of the funds.&quot;\r\n[10]\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Job Title\r\n        No. of Positions\r\n        Wage Bracket\r\n        Job Dev.

Scoville, Jr, of Georgetown; for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.: This\r\n  appeal involves restrictive covenants prohibiting commercial use of property\r\n  absent the developer's approval and whether the developer's rights can be sold\r\n  after the developer no longer owns any of the property.Â  The Respondents,\r\n  landowners who purchased property originally owned by developer Helen Sasser,\r\n  filed this action against Levon and Pamela Dunn seeking to enforce the restrictive\r\n  covenants against the Dunns, who planned to operate a bed and breakfast on\r\n  their property.Â  The Dunns filed several counterclaims, and both parties filed\r\n  motions for summary judgment.Â  The circuit court granted partial summary\r\n  judgment to Respondents, finding Sasser's attempt to sell the developer's\r\n  rights to the Dunns was invalid and Respondents were entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law on the Dunns' counterclaims for civil conspiracy and intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nIn 1978, Helen Sasser acquired land from the partition of Woodland\r\n  Plantation, located along the Great Pee Dee River in Georgetown County.Â  Sasser\r\n  later subdivided the land and began selling lots. Â The deeds to these lots\r\n  included the following restrictive covenant: &quot;No lot shall be used for\r\n  commercial purposes without express written consent from the Developer.&quot;Â \r\n  The term &quot;Developer&quot; was defined as &quot;Helen Sasser, her heirs and\r\n  assigns.&quot;Â  Sasser sold her last remaining lots in the subdivision in 1991. \r\nIn 1994, the Dunns purchased lots 9 and 10, and in 2003, they\r\n  purchased lots 7 and 8.Â  The Dunns also acquired nine acres of land outside the\r\n  subdivision; these nine acres abut the Dunns' property in the subdivision, but are\r\n  not governed by the subdivision's restrictive covenants.Â  In 2005, the Dunns\r\n  began renovation of an existing house (the guest house) on lots 7 and 8 in\r\n  preparation for the opening of a bed and breakfast inn and wedding venue.Â  \r\nTommy Abbott, the husband of Respondent Jean Abbott, wrote to the\r\n  Dunns, objecting to the commercial use of their property and pointing out the\r\n  restrictive covenants.Â  He then visited the local planning and zoning\r\n  commission to inquire about the building permit issued to the Dunns for the\r\n  guest house.Â  The commission later mistakenly issued a stop work order for the\r\n  Dunns' work on their primary residence, but the order was lifted within a few\r\n  hours.Â  Rupert Stalvey, a member of Respondent Stalvey Holdings, LLC, contacted\r\n  the Dunns' insurance agent to advise her of their commercial use of the guest\r\n  house.Â  As a result, the agent contacted the Dunns to advise them that they\r\n  needed to obtain commercial coverage for the guest house.Â  The Dunns further allege\r\n  Respondents contacted the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to falsely report the\r\n  Dunns were filling in wetlands.\r\nSeveral Respondents also signed a petition to amend the\r\n  restrictive covenants so that the covenants would govern the Dunns' nine acres\r\n  bordering the subdivision.Â  One of the Respondents told the Dunns that if they\r\n  refused to sign the petition, the other subdivision landowners would file an\r\n  action to enjoin the Dunns' commercial use of their property.Â  The Dunns did\r\n  not sign the petition.Â  \r\nRespondents then filed this action against the Dunns, seeking an\r\n  injunction against the commercial use of the property. Â After receiving notice\r\n  of the action, the Dunns obtained from Sasser a written assignment of any\r\n  developer's rights she may have remaining in the subdivision.Â  The Dunns also\r\n  executed a document asserting that, as the assignee of Sasser's developer's\r\n  rights, they consented to the commercial use of their own property.Â  Respondents\r\n  sought and obtained a temporary restraining order against the commercial use of\r\n  the property, which was affirmed by this court on appeal.Â  AJG Holdings, LLC\r\n    v. Dunn, 382 S.C. 43, 674 S.E.2d 505 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nRespondents filed an amended complaint to add Sasser as a\r\n  defendant and to add several additional causes of action.Â  The Dunns and Sasser\r\n  filed counterclaims for tortious interference with prospective business\r\n  relations, interference with a contractual relationship, civil conspiracy, and\r\n  intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The parties filed cross-motions\r\n  for summary judgment, and the circuit court ruled that Respondents were\r\n  entitled to partial summary judgment because Sasser no longer retained any developer's\r\n  rights to assign to the Dunns.Â  Accordingly, the Dunns' subsequent execution of\r\n  a written consent to commercial use was meaningless.Â  \r\nThe circuit court also granted Respondents summary judgment on the\r\n  counterclaims for interference with prospective contractual relations, civil\r\n  conspiracy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.Â  The circuit\r\n  court stated that the issue of whether the restrictive covenants run with the\r\n  land and all remaining issues were matters to be decided by the fact-finder.Â \r\n  The circuit court later denied Appellants' motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Restrictive Covenants\r\nAppellants\r\n  make two distinct arguments with regard to the restrictive covenants: first, that\r\n  Sasser lawfully assigned her developer's rights to the Dunns, and second, that\r\n  Respondents have no right to enforce the restrictive covenants in any event.Â \r\n  The circuit court granted summary judgment only with regard to the assignment\r\n  of developer's rights, specifically holding that the second issue â€“ whether the\r\n  covenant was personal to Sasser or ran with the land (the answer to which will\r\n  determine whether Respondents can enforce the covenant) â€“ was to be determined\r\n  by the fact-finder at trial.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Assignment of Developer's\r\n  Rights\r\nAppellants\r\n  first argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondents\r\n  with regard to the assignment of developer's rights.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Queen's Grant II Horizontal Property Regime v. Greenwood\r\n  Development Corp., 368 S.C. 342, 628\r\n  S.E.2d 902&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2006), our court set forth five conditions which\r\n  must be met in order for a developer to reserve the right to amend or impose\r\n  new restrictive covenants running with the land: \r\n\r\n\t(1) the right to amend the covenants or impose new covenants must\r\n  be unambiguously set forth in the original declaration of covenants; (2) the\r\n    developer, at the time of the amended or new covenants, must possess a\r\n    sufficient property interest in the development; (3) the developer must\r\n  strictly comply with the amendment procedure as set forth in the declaration of\r\n  covenants; (4) the developer must provide notice of amended or new covenants in\r\n  strict accordance with the declaration of covenants and as otherwise may be\r\n  provided by law; and (5) the amended or new covenants must not be unreasonable,\r\n  indefinite, or contravene public policy.\r\n\r\n368 S.C. at 350,\r\n  628 S.E.2d at 907 (emphasis added).Â  Focusing on the second condition of Queen's\r\n    Grant, the circuit court found that because Sasser conveyed all the\r\n  property she owned in the subdivision in 1991, she no longer retained a\r\n  sufficient property interest in the subdivision to convey developer's rights to\r\n  the Dunns.Â  Therefore, the circuit court granted partial summary judgment to\r\n  Respondents, finding the Dunns' purported consent to commercial use was legally\r\n  insignificant. \r\nOn appeal, Appellants are unable to point to any interest Sasser\r\n  retained in the property other than her purported right to amend the\r\n  restrictive covenants.[1]Â \r\n  Their argument is a circular one: Sasser has a sufficient property interest in\r\n  the development to allow her to reserve developer's rights because she reserved\r\n  to herself developer's rights.Â  As Queen's Grant makes clear, the\r\n  reservation itself is allowed only when the five conditions are met, and one of\r\n  those conditions is that the developer possesses a sufficient property interest\r\n  in the development.Â  For this condition to be a meaningful one, the property\r\n  interest must necessarily be something more than a purported reservation of\r\n  developer's rights.Â  This is so regardless of whether the restrictive covenants\r\n  run with the land or are personal to Sasser.Â  See McLeod v. Baptiste, 315 S.C. 246, 433 S.E.2d 834&nbsp;(1993)\r\n  (holding a restrictive covenant that was personal to the grantor may not be enforced\r\n  against a remote grantee when the grantor owns no real property which would\r\n  benefit from enforcing the covenant).[2]\r\nBecause\r\n  Sasser did not retain any property interest in the development, she did not retain\r\n  developer's rights.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial court's grant of summary\r\n  judgment with regard to Sasser's inability to assign developer's rights to the Dunns.\r\nB.&nbsp; Denial of Appellants'\r\n  Summary Judgment Motion\r\nAppellants further argue that even if Sasser had no developer's\r\n  rights to assign, the circuit court erred in denying their motion for summary\r\n  judgment because Respondents have no authority to enforce the restrictive\r\n  covenants. Â For later purchasers like Respondents to benefit from a restriction\r\n  imposed by a developer, the developer must have intended for the benefit to run\r\n  with the lots subsequently sold.Â  See Charping v. J.P. Scurry &amp;\r\n    Co., 296 S.C. 312, 314, 372 S.E.2d 120, 121 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  The circuit\r\n  court found the issue of whether the restriction ran with the land or was\r\n  personal to the developer could not be disposed of by summary judgment, but\r\n  must &quot;be decided at the trial.&quot; Â Because the circuit court denied summary judgment, we are prohibited from reviewing that ruling pursuant to Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003).Â  \r\nIn Olson,\r\n  two issues were before the supreme court: (1) whether the court of appeals\r\n  erred on the merits in affirming the granting of summary judgment and (2)\r\n  whether the court of appeals erred in declining to address the merits of the appeal\r\n  from a denial of summary judgment.Â  Despite the immediate appealability of the\r\n  first issue, the supreme court unequivocally held the denial of summary\r\n  judgment was never subject to review, not in an interlocutory appeal nor even\r\n  after final judgment.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, we may not address this issue\r\n  on its merits. \r\nII.&nbsp; Summary Judgment on Counterclaims\r\nAppellants contend that summary judgment on their counterclaims\r\n  for civil conspiracy and intentional infliction of emotional distress was\r\n  inappropriate.[3]Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Civil\r\n  Conspiracy\r\nIn order to recover\r\n  for civil conspiracy, the Dunns were required to demonstrate that two or more\r\n  persons combined for the purpose of injuring and causing special damage to them.&nbsp; City of Hartsville v. S.C. Mun. Ins. &amp; Risk Fin. Fund, 382 S.C. 535,\r\n  546, 677 S.E.2d 574, 579&nbsp;(2009). Â To prove special damages, the Dunns had\r\n  to show that the acts in furtherance of the conspiracy were separate and\r\n  independent from other wrongful acts alleged in the\r\n  complaint.&nbsp; See Todd v. S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co., 276\r\n  S.C. 284, 293, 278 S.E.2d 607, 611 (1981). &nbsp;Special damages must be\r\n  properly pled, or the claim for civil conspiracy will be dismissed.Â  Hackworth\r\n    v. Greywood at Hammett, LLC,Â  385 S.C. 110, 115-16, 682 S.E.2d 871, 875\r\n  (Ct. App. 2009); see also Rule 9(g), SCRCP (requiring special damages to\r\n  be specifically stated in the pleadings).\r\nIn their pleadings, the Dunns allege that Respondents conspired\r\n  &quot;for the purpose of injuring [the Dunns] and such conspiracy has resulted\r\n  in special damages, insofar as [the Dunns] have lost the quiet use and\r\n  enjoyment of their property, have suffered damage to their reputations in the\r\n  community, as well as other injury in an amount to be proven at trial.&quot;Â \r\n  At the summary judgment hearing, the circuit court pointed out that these\r\n  damages were no different from the damages alleged in the Dunns' other causes\r\n  of action. Â At that point, the Dunns argued that their payment of attorney's\r\n  fees and costs constituted special damages.Â  Every litigant represented by a\r\n  lawyer incurs attorney's fees and costs.Â  However, the Dunns never pointed out\r\n  to the circuit court specific attorney's fees or costs they contended qualified\r\n  as special damages, nor did they seek permission to amend their counterclaim to\r\n  include the specificity required by Rule 9(g).Â  In granting summary judgment,\r\n  the circuit court noted the damages the Dunns alleged did not &quot;go beyond\r\n  the damages alleged in other causes of action.&quot; Â \r\nAt\r\n  oral argument before this court, the Dunns conceded\r\n  that the damages pled in their civil conspiracy counterclaim mirrored those\r\n  alleged in their interference with a contractual relationship counterclaim. They\r\n  argued, however, that Respondents' contact to the Corps of Engineers caused\r\n  them to incur specific attorney's fees and costs associated with the accusation\r\n  the Dunns had filled in wetlands, and those expenses qualified as special\r\n  damages.Â  Because that argument was not presented to the circuit court, we may\r\n  not consider it. Â See Wilder Corp., 330 S.C. at 76, 497\r\n  S.E.2d at 733 (requiring issue to be raised below to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review). Â Because\r\n  the Dunns failed to plead a sufficient claim for special damages unique to the civil\r\n  conspiracy claim, the circuit court properly granted summary judgment.Â  See Rule 9(g), SCRCP.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Intentional\r\n  Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nIn their counterclaim for intentional infliction of emotional\r\n  distress, the Dunns had the burden of establishing a prima facie case as to each element of the claim in\r\n  order to survive summary judgment.Â  Hansson v.\r\n    Scalise Builders of S.C., 374 S.C. 352,\r\n  358, 650 S.E.2d 68, 71&nbsp;(2007). Â To establish such a claim, the\r\n  plaintiff must show the defendant: (1) &quot;intentionally\r\n  or recklessly inflicted severe emotional distress, or was certain, or\r\n  substantially certain, that such distress would result from his conduct&quot;; (2)\r\n  that the conduct was so outrageous it exceeded &quot;all possible bounds of\r\n  decency&quot; and so &quot;atrocious&quot; it was &quot;utterly intolerable in\r\n  a civilized community&quot;; (3) such actions actually caused plaintiff's\r\n  emotional distress; and (4) the emotional distress was so severe &quot;no\r\n  reasonable man could be expected to endure it.&quot;Â  374 S.C. at 356, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 70 (citing Ford v. Hutson, 276 S.C. 157, 276 S.E.2d 776\r\n  (1981)).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  affirm the circuit court's determination that the Dunns\r\n  did not establish a prima facie case that their emotional distress was &quot;severe such that no reasonable man could be expected to\r\n  endure it.&quot;Â  Hansson, 374 S.C.at\r\n  356, 650 S.E.2d at 70 (internal quotes omitted).Â  In Hansson, our\r\n  supreme court found that the plaintiff's testimony he lost sleep and developed\r\n  a habit of grinding his teeth was not sufficient to survive summary judgment:\r\n\r\n\tTo\r\n  permit a plaintiff to legitimately state a cause of action by simply alleging, 'I\r\n  suffered emotional distress' would be irreconcilable with this Court's\r\n  development of the law in this area.&nbsp; In the words of Justice Littlejohn,\r\n  the court must look for something 'more' â€“ in the form of third party witness\r\n  testimony and other corroborating evidence â€“ in order to make a prima facie\r\n  showing of 'severe' emotional distress.Â  \r\n\r\n374 S.C. at 358-59, 650 S.E.2d at 72.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Levon Dunn testified that Respondents' actions caused him to develop high blood\r\n  pressure and digestive problems.Â  He also testified that his nerves were &quot;shot&quot;\r\n  and that he took medication for his high blood pressure and nervousness.Â  Pamela\r\n  Dunn testified that she had been &quot;emotionally ill&quot; and that she had\r\n  lost twenty pounds.Â  Like in Hansson, we find this evidence, even when\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the Dunns, is not sufficient to survive a\r\n  motion for summary judgment.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Standard of\r\n  Review\r\nIn\r\n  affirming the circuit court's determination that the evidence is insufficient\r\n  to survive summary judgment on the Dunns' counterclaims, we are mindful of our\r\n  limited standard of review.Â  We may affirm an order granting summary judgment\r\n  only if &quot;no genuine issue of material fact\r\n  exists and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Cowburn\r\n    v. Leventis,Â  366 S.C. 20, 30, 619 S.E.2d 437, 443 (Ct. App. 2005). Â Our\r\n  supreme court has recently stated that where the burden of proof is the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence, &quot;the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere\r\n  scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â \r\n  The supreme court has never specifically applied the &quot;mere scintilla&quot;\r\n  standard to a cause of action for civil conspiracy.Â  However, our ruling that\r\n  the Dunns failed to plead a sufficient &quot;claim&quot; for special damages\r\n  means that any factual issue as to civil conspiracy is not\r\n  &quot;material.&quot;Â  Thus, because our ruling is not based on the sufficiency\r\n  of the evidence it is unnecessary for us to determine whether the &quot;mere\r\n  scintilla&quot; standard applies to civil conspiracy. \r\nHowever,\r\n  we do base our ruling affirming the circuit court as to intentional infliction\r\n  of emotional distress on the sufficiency of the evidence.Â  As recognized in Hansson,\r\n  a cause of action for intentional infliction of emotional distress carries a\r\n  &quot;heightened burden of proof.&quot;[4]Â  374 S.C. at 356, 650 S.E.2d at 71.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the &quot;mere scintilla&quot; rule of Hancock does not apply to this\r\n  cause of action.Â  See Hancock, 381 S.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at\r\n  802-03 (stating &quot;where a heightened burden of\r\n  proof is required, there must be more than a scintilla of evidence in order to\r\n  defeat a motion for summary judgment&quot;).Â  Rather, the court must\r\n  determine &quot;whether the defendant's conduct may\r\n  reasonably be regarded&quot; as meeting the requirements of Ford v.\r\n    Hutson.Â  Hansson, 374 S.C. at 357, 650\r\n  S.E.2d at 71 (quoting Holtzscheiter v. Thomson Newspapers,\r\n  306 S.C. 297, 302, 411 S.E.2d 664, 666 (1991)).Â  The\r\n  court must determine whether &quot;reasonable minds could differ as to whether\r\n  [the] conduct was sufficiently 'outrageous'&quot; and &quot;whether [the]\r\n  resulting emotional distress was sufficiently 'severe.'&quot;Â  Hansson, 374 S.C. at 358, 650 S.E.2d at 71-72.Â  This responsibility,\r\n  which the supreme court has called &quot;a significant gatekeeping role in\r\n  analyzing a defendant's motion for summary judgment,&quot; Hansson, 374\r\n  S.C. at 358, 650 S.E.2d at 72, requires the circuit court to determine\r\n  whether a prima facie case has been established.Â  See Strickland v.\r\n    Madden,Â  323 S.C. 63, 68, 448 S.E.2d 581, 584 (Ct. App. 1994)\r\n  (&quot;Initially . . . the [circuit] court determines whether the defendant's\r\n  conduct may reasonably be regarded as so extreme and outrageous as to permit\r\n  recovery, and only where reasonable persons might differ is the question one\r\n  for the jury.&quot;).Â Â  Upon careful review of the record before us, we find\r\n  the circuit court exercised its gatekeeping responsibility within its\r\n  discretion when it determined that the Dunns failed to establish a prima facie\r\n  case for intentional infliction of emotional distress.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the reasoning above, we decline to address\r\n  the circuit court's denial of summary judgment with regard to Respondents'\r\n  authority to enforce the restrictive covenants.Â  Otherwise, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's partial grant of summary judgment in all respects.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nLOCKEMY, J., and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] During oral arguments, Appellants argued for the first time that Sasser\r\n  retained rights to use a fishing pond in the development.Â  This argument is not\r\n  preserved because it was never raised or ruled upon below, nor was it argued in\r\n  the Appellants' brief.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71,\r\n  76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (&quot;[A]n issue . . . must have been raised to\r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.&quot;); First Savings Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994)\r\n  (holding issues not argued in the brief will not be considered on appeal).\r\n[2] The Dunns are remote grantees because they did not acquire their property\r\n  through Sasser.\r\n[3] Appellants also argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on\r\n  their counterclaim for interference with a contractual relationship; however,\r\n  the circuit court denied summary judgment on this counterclaim.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  do not address this argument.\r\n[4] In this opinion we address the burden of proof as it affects the summary\r\n  judgment stage.Â  We do not address the burden of proof to be charged to the\r\n  jury.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4780","title":"Thornton v.

Spruill, of Columbia, for Respondent/ Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J.:Â  Brian and\r\n  Catherine Thornton brought this lawsuit as a class action for negligence,\r\n  strict liability, and nuisance arising out of blasting activities conducted by\r\n  South Carolina Electric and Gas Corporation (SCE&amp;G) at the Lake Murray\r\n  dam.Â  SCE&amp;G made a motion titled &quot;Motion for Summary Judgment and to\r\n  Strike Class Action Allegations.&quot;Â  In substance, the motion sought three\r\n  rulings relevant to this appeal.Â  First, in what it labeled &quot;motion to\r\n  strike,&quot; SCE&amp;G claimed &quot;Plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite\r\n  elements required for this case to be certified as a class action under Rule\r\n  23, SCRCP.&quot;Â  Second, SCE&amp;G moved for summary judgment based on the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Third, SCE&amp;G argued the South Carolina Mining Act[1] does not create a private cause of action. Â The Thorntons appeal the circuit\r\n  court's ruling in favor of SCE&amp;G on the first and third points, and\r\n  SCE&amp;G cross-appeals the denial of summary judgment as to the statute of\r\n  limitations.Â  We dismiss the appeal because the order is not immediately\r\n  appealable.\r\nI.&nbsp; Appealability\r\nAn interlocutory order not governed by a specialized  appealability statute is not immediately appealable unless it fits into one of  the categories listed in section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976  &amp; Supp. 2009).&nbsp;Ex Parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc.,  369 S.C. 1, 6, 630 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2006).   The Thorntons contend the portion of the\r\n  order dealing with class action allegations is appealable under section 14-3-330(2)(c)\r\n  because it affects a substantial right by striking a pleading. Â They contend\r\n  the portion of the order granting summary judgment that no private right of\r\n  action exists under the Mining Act is also appealable under section\r\n  14-3-330(2)(c), and under section 14-3-330(1) because it involves the merits.Â \r\n  We disagree.Â  Under the circumstances of this case, neither portion of the\r\n  order is immediately appealable.Â  The portion of the order denying SCE&amp;G's\r\n  motion for summary judgment on the statute of limitations is not appealable\r\nunder any circumstance.Â Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Order Granting a Motion to Strike Class Action\r\n  Allegations\r\nThe\r\n  Thorntons' complaint defined the class to include: &quot;All residents of\r\n  Lexington County, South Carolina who suffered property damage as a result of\r\n  the construction and blasting of the Lake Murray dam expansion project.&quot; Â After\r\n  discovery, SCE&amp;G filed its motion addressing the class action allegations. Â Though\r\n  the motion was filed under Rule 12, SCRCP,[2] and was captioned as a motion &quot;to strike class action allegations,&quot; the\r\n  motion actually raised the merits of class certification.Â  The motion states:\r\n  &quot;Plaintiffs cannot establish the requisite elements required for this case\r\n  to be certified as a class action under Rule 23, SCRCP.&quot;Â  The applicable\r\n  heading of SCE&amp;G's memorandum in support of its motion states:\r\n  &quot;Plaintiffs cannot satisfy the elements to proceed as a class action under\r\n  Rule 23(a), SCRCP,&quot; and the text of the memorandum addresses the merits of\r\n  class certification under the rule.Â  The Thorntons noted in their responsive\r\n  memorandum that &quot;Defendants' Motion reads more as a Memorandum in\r\n  opposition to class certification,&quot; and proceeded to address the merits of\r\n  the criteria for class certification.Â  The order also addressed the merits of\r\n  class certification: \r\n\r\n\tDefendants\r\n  raise the argument that Plaintiffs fail to satisfy the elements set out in Rule\r\n  23(a), [SCRCP].Â  The court has determined that the defenses of the\r\n  representative party are not typical of the defenses of the class.Â  As\r\n  indicated in the records, each member has unique damages which will require\r\n  unique defenses.Â  Accordingly, Defendants' Motion to Strike Class Action\r\n  Allegations is granted.Â  \r\n\r\nWe believe the Thorntons'\r\n  contention that this portion of the order is immediately appealable because it affects\r\n  a substantial right by striking a pleading mistakenly equates an order granting\r\n  a Rule 12(f) motion to strike with an order that is appealable under section\r\n  14-3-330(2)(c).Â  We do not believe the two are necessarily the same.Â  In\r\n  particular, we find the use of the word &quot;strike&quot; in both Rule 12(f) and\r\n  section 14-3-330(2)(c) does not mean that an order granting a Rule 12(f) motion\r\n  is automatically immediately appealable.[3]\r\nIn P.J.\r\n  Construction Co., Inc. v Roller, 287 S.C. 632, 340 S.E.2d 564 (Ct. App.\r\n  1986), this court heard an appeal from an order striking two defenses from the\r\n  answer.Â  Before proceeding to the merits of the appeal, the court stated:\r\n  &quot;An order striking a portion of a pleading is\r\n  immediately appealable.&quot;Â  287 S.C. at 633, 340 S.E.2d at 565 (citing Harbert, 74 S.C. at 16, 53 S.E. at\r\n  1002).[4]Â \r\n  Other than that general statement, however, no South Carolina appellate court facing\r\n  an appeal from an order granting a motion to strike has defined what\r\n  constitutes an order affecting a substantial right by striking a pleading under section 14-3-330(2)(c).[5]Â \r\n  Generally, section 14-3-330(2) has &quot;been narrowly\r\n  construed and immediate appeal of various orders issued before or during trial\r\n  generally has not been allowed.&quot;Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362\r\n  S.C. 191, 196, 607 S.E.2d 707, 709 (2005).Â  We\r\n  believe a narrow construction of section 14-3-330(2)(c) requires us to focus\r\n  on the effect of the order, not the label given to the motion or to the order\r\n  granting it.[6]Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  support for this view in several opinions of our supreme court.Â  In Miles v.\r\n    Charleston Light &amp; Water Co., 87 S.C. 254, 69 S.E. 292 (1910), the\r\n  supreme court considered the defendant's appeal from an interlocutory order\r\n  denying its motion to make the plaintiff's complaint more definite and\r\n  certain.Â  87 S.C. at 255-56, 69 S.E. at 293.Â  After noting that such an order\r\n  was not immediately appealable, the court heard the appeal anyway because\r\n  &quot;appeal has also been taken from the order upon the [defendant's]\r\n  demurrer, which in effect strikes out a portion of the complaint,&quot;\r\n  making it appealable under the predecessor to section 14-3-330(2)(c).Â  87 S.C.\r\n  at 257, 69 S.E. at 293 (emphasis added).Â  In Bowden v. Powell, 194 S.C.\r\n  482, 10 S.E.2d 8 (1940), the supreme court considered a post-judgment appeal\r\n  from a pretrial order denying a motion to strike allegations in a complaint.Â \r\n  194 S.C. at 484, 10 S.E.2d at 9.Â  In holding the order was not appealable, the\r\n  court quoted Harbert to draw a distinction between the order before the\r\n  court and an order granting a motion to strike a pleading, which the court\r\n  noted is appealable:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIf the circuit court errs in striking out any material\r\n  allegations of a good cause of action or good defense, it is impossible to\r\n  remedy it in the course of the trial, because the evidence and the issues\r\n  submitted to the jury cannot be extended beyond the issues made by the\r\n  pleading, and on appeal from the final judgment this court could not say there\r\n  was error of law in confining the evidence and charge to the pleadings.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Harbert,\r\n  74 S.C. at 16, 53 S.E. at 1002); see also Caldwell v. McCaw, 141\r\n  S.C. 86, 91, 139 S.E. 174, 175 (1927).Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the reasoning of Miles and Bowden, an appellate court should look\r\n  to the effect of an interlocutory order to determine its appealability under\r\n  section 14-3-330(2)(c).Â  An order affects a substantial right by striking a\r\n  pleading if the order removes a material issue from the case, thereby\r\n  preventing the issue from being litigated on the merits, and preventing the\r\n  party from seeking to correct any errors in the order during or after trial.[7]Â \r\n  Whether an order granting a Rule 12(f) motion to strike is appealable under\r\n  section 14-3-330(2)(c) depends on the effect of the individual order under the\r\n  facts and circumstances of the case.Â  Here, rather than asking the court to\r\n  remove an issue from the case, SCE&amp;G's motion to strike actually raised the\r\n  merits of class certification.[8]Â \r\n  Rather than preventing the Thorntons from litigating the issue, the order had\r\n  the effect of denying class certification on the merits. Â &quot;The general\r\n  rule established by [the supreme c]ourt is that class certification orders are\r\n  not immediately appealable.&quot;Â  Salmonsen v. CGD, Inc., 377 S.C. 442,\r\n  448, 661 S.E.2d 81, 85 (2008) (citing Eldridge v. City of Greenwood, 308\r\n  S.C. 125, 127, 417 S.E.2d 532, 534 (1992)).Â  We find this order is not immediately\r\n  appealable because its effect was not to strike a pleading, as its label\r\n  suggests, but rather to deny class certification on the merits of Rule 23(a),\r\n  SCRCP.[9]Â \r\n  On remand, the order shall be treated as an order denying class certification\r\n  which, under Rule 23(d)(1), &quot;may be altered or amended before the decision\r\n  on the merits.&quot;Â  See Salmonsen, 377 S.C. at 454, 661 S.E.2d\r\n  at 88 (&quot;[C]lass certification may be altered at any time prior to a\r\n  decision on the merits.&quot;).\r\nThe decision we\r\n  reach in this case is consistent with a recent opinion of the supreme court on\r\n  an interlocutory appeal from an order granting a motion to strike class\r\n  allegations: Grazia v. South Carolina State Plastering, LLC, Op. No.\r\n  26882 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 4, 2010) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 40 at 13).Â  In Grazia, the plaintiffs' claim for defective stucco work fell under The\r\n  Notice and Opportunity to Cure Construction Dwelling Defect Act,[10] which &quot;requires the claimant to serve written notice no later than\r\n  ninety days before filing the action.&quot;Â  Id. at 19 (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  Neither the Grazias nor any member of the class complied with the\r\n  notice provision before filing.Â  Id. at 15.Â  Even after the Grazias\r\n  personally complied with the notice requirement, the trial court granted the\r\n  defendants' motion to strike class allegations based on its conclusion as a\r\n  matter of law that the Act is incompatible with class action procedure.Â  Id. at 15, 18.Â  Although the supreme court did not discuss the appealability of the\r\n  order, it was immediately appealable.[11]Â \r\n  By ruling as a matter of law that no class action could be filed under the\r\n  Right to Cure Act, the lower court order had the effect of removing the issue\r\n  of class certification from the case and preventing the Grazias from litigating\r\n  the issue on the merits of Rule 23, SCRCP.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Order Granting Summary Judgment Under the Mining\r\n  Act\r\nGenerally,\r\n  orders granting partial summary judgment may be immediately appealable under\r\n  either the &quot;involving the merits&quot; or &quot;substantial right&quot;\r\n  categories of section 14-3-330(1) and (2)(c).Â  See Link v. Sch. Dist.\r\n    of Pickens County, 302 S.C. 1, 6, 393 S.E.2d 176, 178-79 (1990) (holding an\r\n  order granting partial summary judgment may be appealable under either\r\n  category).Â  To decide whether a particular summary judgment order fits into\r\n  either subsection, however, the court must examine the order to determine if it\r\n  meets the subsection's criteria for appealability.Â  We find the order granting\r\n  summary judgment that no private cause of action exists under the Mining Act\r\n  does not meet the criteria for either, and is therefore not immediately\r\n  appealable.\r\nThe\r\n  Thorntons asserted causes of action for negligence, strict liability, and\r\n  nuisance.Â  They did not plead a cause of action under the Mining Act.Â  At oral\r\n  argument, the Thorntons conceded they still have no intention of asserting a\r\n  cause of action under the Mining Act.Â  SCE&amp;G stated in memoranda addressing\r\n  appealability that its &quot;motion for summary judgment was limited to the\r\n  extent the Thorntons might try to assert a claim under the Act.&quot;Â  This\r\n  appeal thus presents the unique situation in which the trial court granted a\r\n  motion for summary judgment as to a cause of action the Thorntons never pled.Â \r\n  The Thorntons did include two violations of the Mining Act as specific\r\n  allegations of negligence.Â  SCE&amp;G conceded at oral argument that the\r\n  Thorntons' negligence cause of action, including the subsections referring to\r\n  the Mining Act, remains in place as it was before the motion was granted.\r\nWe find that\r\n  this order does not involve the merits under section 14-3-330(1). Â An order\r\n  &quot;involves the merits&quot; when it finally determines a substantial matter\r\n  forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.Â  Mid-State\r\n    Distribs., Inc. v. Century Imps., Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 334, 426 S.E.2d 777,\r\n  780 (1993).Â  The Thorntons may still pursue their negligence claim as\r\n  originally pled in their complaint.Â  If the trial judge permits it in the\r\n  exercise of discretion, they may introduce evidence that SCE&amp;G violated the\r\n  Mining Act and argue the alleged violations are evidence of negligence.Â  All of\r\n  this is left to the discretion of the trial judge, just as it would be if the\r\n  motion had never been filed.\r\nFurther,\r\n  because the Thorntons never asserted a cause of action under the Act, the order\r\n  does not have the effect of removing any material issues from the case, and\r\n  therefore does not affect a substantial right by striking a pleading.Â  The\r\n  Thorntons may still offer evidence of SCE&amp;G's alleged violations of the Act\r\n  in attempting to prove their negligence claim as pled.Â  Because the order\r\n  granting summary judgment neither involves the merits nor affects a substantial\r\n  right, it is not immediately appealable.\r\nC.&nbsp; Statute of Limitations Cross-Appeal\r\nIn the\r\n  cross-appeal, SCE&amp;G contends the trial judge erred in denying its summary\r\n  judgment motion as to the statute of limitations.Â  SCE&amp;G further contends\r\n  the circuit court's order actually granted summary judgment for the Thorntons\r\n  as to that issue.Â  To the extent the judge merely denied summary judgment, the\r\n  order is not appealable.Â  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354\r\n  S.C. 161, 168, 580 S.E.2d 440, 444 (2003) (explaining the denial of summary\r\n  judgment will not be considered on appeal even in the context of an otherwise\r\n  proper appeal).Â  The order is also not appealable as having granted summary\r\n  judgment.Â  As the Thorntons conceded at oral argument, the order does not grant\r\n  summary judgment on this issue, and the question of whether the Thorntons\r\n  complied with the statute of limitations remains one the circuit court must\r\n  answer at trial.Â Â Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nAn\r\n  interlocutory order which is not governed by a specialized appealability\r\n  statute may not be appealed before the entry of final judgment unless the order\r\n  fits into one of the categories set forth in section 14-3-330 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code.Â  The order appealed in this case does not fit into any of the\r\n  categories, and therefore is not immediately appealable.\r\nAPPEAL\r\n  DISMISSED.\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-20-10 to -310 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2010).Â  \r\n[2] Rule 12(f), SCRCP, provides in part: &quot;Motion to Strike. Upon motion\r\n  pointing out the defects complained of, . . . the court may order stricken from\r\n  any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant, immaterial, impertinent\r\n  or scandalous matter.&quot; \r\n[3] The word &quot;strike&quot; in Â§ 14-3-330(2)(c) and Rule 12(f) has different\r\n  origins.Â  In section 14-3-330(2)(c), the word &quot;strike&quot; comes from its\r\n  code pleading predecessor enacted in 1870.Â  S.C. Acts Part I., tit. I., sec.\r\n  11, Gen. Assemb., Reg. Sess. (S.C. 1869-70).Â  That section, which has not\r\n  changed since 1902, includes the phrase &quot;strikes out an answer or any part\r\n  thereof, or any pleading in any action.&quot;Â  Harbert v. Atlanta &amp;\r\n    Charlotte Air Line Ry. Co., 74 S.C. 13, 16, 53 S.E. 1001, 1001-02 (1906).Â \r\n  On the other hand, a motion to strike pursuant to Rule 12(f), SCRCP, originated\r\n  in the federal rules of civil procedure decades after and without any reference\r\n  to the use of the word &quot;strike&quot; in section 14-3-330(2)(c).Â  See Rule 86, SCRCP (&quot;These rules shall take effect on July 1, 1985.&quot;).Â  \r\n[4] The lower court's order in Roller apparently was not entered pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(f), as this court's opinion does not mention the rule, and the appeal\r\n  was heard on December 17, 1985, less than six months after the effective date\r\n  of the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  287 S.C. at 632, 340 S.E.2d at 564.\r\n[5] In several cases, our courts have discussed the immediate appealability of\r\n  orders denying motions to strike.Â  See, e.g., Breland v. Love\r\n    Chevrolet Olds, Inc., 339 S.C. 89, 529 S.E.2d 11 (2000); Bowden v.\r\n      Powell, 194 S.C. 482, 10 S.E.2d 8 (1940); Miles v. Charleston Light\r\n        &amp; Water Co., 87 S.C. 254, 69 S.E. 292 (1910).Â  We have been able to\r\n  find only one other decision addressing, under section 14-3-330(2)(c), the\r\n  immediate appealability of an interlocutory order granting a motion: Murphy\r\n    v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 346 S.C. 37, 550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001), overruled on other grounds by Farmer\r\n    v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 556-57, 579\r\n  S.E.2d 325, 327 (2003).Â  We discuss each of these cases below.Â  \r\n[6] Our courts have previously looked beyond the labels on motions and orders to\r\n  discern their actual effect for purposes of appealability.Â  See, e.g., Wetzel v. Woodside Dev. Ltd. P'ship, 364 S.C. 589, 592, 615 S.E.2d 437, 438 (2005) (holding on unique\r\n  facts that an order granting a motion to set aside default was immediately\r\n  appealable because it had &quot;the effect of . . . granting a motion to\r\n  dismiss under Rule 12(b)(5), SCRCP, since it ends the action as to [one party]&quot;); Hackworth v. Greywood at Hammett, LLC, 385 S.C.\r\n  110, 114-15, 682 S.E.2d 871, 874 (Ct. App. 2009) (analyzing a &quot;motion to\r\n  strike&quot; which actually challenges a theory of recovery as a motion to\r\n  dismiss under 12(b)(6) rather than as a motion to strike).\r\n[7] Our holding is also supported by the supreme court's decision in Breland.Â \r\n  339 S.C. at 93, 529 S.E.2d at 13.Â  In Breland, the court ruled that an\r\n  order denying a motion to change venue was not immediately appealable under\r\n  section 14-3-330(2)(c), stating: &quot;Immediate\r\n  appeals under subsection (2) have been allowed in situations where the\r\n  substantial right could not be vindicated on appeal after the case.&quot;Â \r\n  339 S.C. at 93, 529 S.E.2d at 13.Â  The court held that &quot;[t]he\r\n  trial court's order did not 'affect' the Defendant's right to venue in the\r\n  county of its residence because any error in the order can be corrected on\r\n  appeal following the trial.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n[8] Although the question of whether a class action should be certified is\r\n  typically raised by the plaintiff in a motion for class certification, either\r\n  party may prompt the court to make this determination.Â  Rule 23(d), SCRCP\r\n  (&quot;As soon as practicable, after the commencement of an action brought as a\r\n  class action, the court shall determine by order whether it is to be so\r\n  maintained.&quot;).Â  \r\n[9] In Murphy, this court looked to the effect of an interlocutory order to\r\n  determine its appealability under section 14-3-330(2)(c).Â  346 S.C. at 44-45,\r\n  550 S.E.2d at 593.Â  Though the order granting the Rule 12(b)(1), SCRCP, motion\r\n  was not a final order, the court found it immediately appealable because it had\r\n  &quot;the practical effect . . . that it strikes out\r\n  the Murphys' complaint with respect to [some but not all defendants].&quot;Â  346\r\n  S.C. at 44, 550 S.E.2d at 593.\r\n[10] S.C.

Â§Â§ 40-59-810 to -860 (Supp. 2009).\r\n[11] &quot;The fact that an appellate court may have decided an appeal of a\r\n  particular type of order on the merits is not dispositive of whether the order\r\n  is appealable when the issue of appealability was not raised.&quot;Â  Breland,\r\n  339 S.C. at 95, 529 S.E.2d at 14.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4781","title":"Banks v.

Protestant Episcopal Church in Diocese of S.C., 385 S.C. 428, 442, 685\r\n  S.E.2d 163, 170&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;Nonetheless, there is a general\r\n  constitutional command, based in the First Amendment, mandating . . . civil\r\n  courts to 'decide church . . . disputes without resolving underlying controversies over religious doctrine.'&quot; Id. at\r\n  442, 685 S.E.2d at 170-71 (quoting Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese v.\r\n    Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 710 (1976)) (second omission by court).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Supreme Court has determined that when resolvingÂ  church\r\n  disputes, South Carolina courts apply the &quot;neutral principles of law\r\n  approach.&quot;Â  See id. at 442, 685 S.E.2d at 171; Pearson v.\r\n    Church of God, 325 S.C. 45, 478 S.E.2d 849 (1996); see also Jones\r\n      v. Wolf, 443 U.S. 595, 602-04 (1979) (holding a state is constitutionally\r\n  entitled to adopt the neutral principles of law approach as a means of\r\n  adjudicating church disputes).Â  &quot;This method 'relies exclusively on\r\n  objective, well-established concepts of trust and property law familiar to\r\n  lawyers and judges. Â It thereby promises to free civil courts completely from\r\n  entanglement in questions of religious doctrine, polity, and practice.'&quot;Â  All\r\n    Saints Parish Waccamaw, 385 S.C. at 444, 685 S.E.2d at 172&nbsp;(quoting Jones,\r\n  443 U.S at 603).Â  &quot;[T]he neutral principles of law approach permits the\r\n  application of property, corporate, and other forms of law to church\r\n  disputes.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nPearson articulated the rule South Carolina civil courts must\r\n  follow when adjudicating church dispute cases.Â  Id. Â The Pearson rule provides: \r\n\r\n    (1) courts may not engage in resolving disputes as to religious law, principle,\r\n    doctrine, discipline, custom, or administration; (2) courts cannot avoid\r\n    adjudicating rights growing out of civil law; [and] (3) in resolving such civil\r\n    law disputes, courts must accept as final and binding the decisions of the\r\n    highest religious judicatories as to religious law, principle, doctrine,\r\n    discipline, custom, and administration. \r\n\r\n325 S.C. at 52-53, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  at 853 (footnote omitted).Â  Under the Pearson rule, when &quot;a civil court can completely resolve a\r\n  church dispute on neutral principles of law, the First Amendment commands it to\r\n  do so.&quot;Â  All Saints Parish Waccamaw, 385 S.C. at 445, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n  172.\r\nHowever,\r\n  when a civil court is presented an issue that is a question of religious law or\r\n  doctrine masquerading as a dispute over church property or corporate control,\r\n  it must defer to the decisions of the proper church judicatories to the extent\r\n  it concerns religious or doctrinal issues. Â Id. (citing Serbian E.\r\n    Orthodox Diocese, 426 U.S. at 709 (finding the controversy before the Court\r\n  &quot;essentially involve[d] not a church property dispute, but a religious\r\n  dispute the resolution of which . . . is for ecclesiastical and not civil\r\n  tribunals&quot;)).Â  &quot;'[W]henever the questions of discipline, or of faith,\r\n  or ecclesiastical rule, custom, or law have been decided by the highest of\r\n  these church judicatories to which the matter has been carried, the legal\r\n  tribunals must accept such decisions as final, and as binding on them, in their\r\n  application to the case before them.'&quot;Â  Pearson,&nbsp;325 S.C. at\r\n  49, 478 S.E.2d at 851 (quoting Serbian E. Orthodox Diocese, 426 U.S. at\r\n  710).\r\nI. Defamation\r\nUnder\r\n  the Pearson rule &quot;courts cannot avoid adjudicating rights growing\r\n  out of civil law.&quot;Â  325 S.C. at 52, 478 S.E.2d at 853.Â  Here, the Trustee's\r\n  defamation claim can be resolved using solely legal principles without\r\n  examining any religious questions.Â  &quot;[T]he neutral principles of law\r\n  approach permits the application of property, corporate, and other forms of law\r\n  to church disputes.&quot;Â  All Saints Parish Waccamaw, 385 S.C. at 444,\r\n  685 S.E.2d at 172.Â  Because the circuit court can completely resolve a church\r\n  dispute on neutral principles of law, the First Amendment commands it to do so.\r\n  Â \r\nBrantley\r\n  provides several cases from outside jurisdictions that have found the court\r\n  lacked subject matter jurisdiction over defamation claims.[1]Â \r\n  However, by applying the neutral principles doctrine we can resolve whether the\r\n  court has jurisdiction to address the defamation claim in the current case\r\n  without looking to outside jurisdictions.Â  In the present case, the court would\r\n  not need to look at the Church's beliefs to determine if the statements constitute\r\n  defamation.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in dismissing the defamation\r\n  cause of action.Â  Therefore, the dismissal of the defamation action should be\r\n  reversed and the action remanded for trial.\r\nII. Negligence \r\nAs\r\n  to the negligence causes of action, the trial court properly dismissed the\r\n  action. Â The negligence cause of action against the Church alleges it was\r\n  negligent in hiring Brantley and not conducting its own investigation into the\r\n  facts before the congregational meeting was held.Â  The negligence cause of\r\n  action against Brantley contends he was negligent in asking the congregation to\r\n  remove the Trustees from the Board and in not conducting his own investigation\r\n  of the facts before the meeting was held.Â  All of these allegations involve the\r\n  administrative procedures of the Church, which Pearson specifically\r\n  notes courts cannot examine.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly dismissed\r\n  the negligence causes of action.\r\nIII. IIED\r\nAlthough\r\n  the Trustees raised the IIED cause of action in their complaint, the trial\r\n  court did not address it when it dismissed the action and the Trustees failed\r\n  to make a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion.Â  Accordingly, we cannot address the trial\r\n  court's treatment of this cause of action. Â See Noisette v. Ismail,\r\n  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (finding when a trial court fails\r\n  to address the specific argument raised by the appellant, the appellant must\r\n  make a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e) to obtain a ruling on\r\n  the argument or it is not preserved for appellate review).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court can decide the defamation action without looking at\r\n  religious principles and therefore reverse the dismissal of the defamation\r\n  action and remand that claim for trial.Â  Additionally, the negligence causes of\r\n  action cannot be examined by the court without delving into the Church's\r\n  administrative procedures.Â  Therefore, we affirm the dismissal of the\r\n  negligence causes of action.Â  Further, because the trial court did not rule on\r\n  the IIED cause of action in its order, the dismissal of that claim is unpreserved\r\n  for appellate review.Â  Accordingly, the trial court's order is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED IN PART.\r\nGEATHERS\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] In many of those cases, the courts could not\r\n  determine if the claim was defamation without looking into the churches'\r\n  beliefs.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4782","title":"Church v.

Church brought this quantum meruit action against Carroll E. McGee (Carroll),\r\n  individually and as personal representative of the Estate of William LuRue\r\n  McGee (Decedent),[1] as well as Ted O. McGee, Jr. (Ted), as trustee of the McGee family trust\r\n  (collectively Respondents),[2] seeking compensation for caregiving services provided to Decedent in his final\r\n  years.Â  In these cross-appeals, Church challenges the circuit court's finding\r\n  that she expected no compensation when she provided the caregiving services.Â \r\n  She also challenges the circuit court's refusal to remove Carroll as personal\r\n  representative of Decedent's estate.Â  Carroll challenges the circuit court's\r\n  failure to allow a setoff of $35,000 against Decedent's $100,000 bequest to\r\n  Church. Â Carroll also challenges the circuit court's award of prejudgment\r\n  interest on the amount the court determined the estate owed Church.Â  We reverse the\r\n  award of prejudgment interest and affirm the remainder of the circuit court's\r\n  order. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nDecedent was a paraplegic from\r\n  1957, when he was sixteen years of age, until his death in 2003.Â  In 1993,\r\n  Decedent and Church began seeing each other socially, and they developed a bond.Â \r\n  Subsequently, Church moved in with Decedent and his mother.Â  In 1996, Church\r\n  had to abandon her housecleaning occupation to provide full-time care to\r\n  Decedent, whose health had significantly deteriorated.Â  \r\nAfter Decedent's death, Church\r\n  removed several items of personal property from Decedent's primary residence\r\n  and from the lake house belonging to Decedent's family.[3]Â \r\n  Church considered some of these items to be gifts to her from Decedent and\r\n  other items to be property purchased with their joint funds.Â  Decedent's last will\r\n  provided for Church to receive $100,000 and a Lexus automobile and for his\r\n  siblings to receive the remainder of his estate.Â  However, Carroll advised\r\n  Church that Decedent's estate was insolvent.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nChurch filed a claim against\r\n  Decedent's estate for $450,000 for caregiving services she allegedly rendered to\r\n  Decedent, and the probate court granted her petition to remove the proceeding\r\n  to circuit court.Â  In September 2004, she filed separate petitions to remove\r\n  Carroll as the personal representative of Decedent's estate and to appoint a\r\n  special administrator to handle the estate under the continuing authority of\r\n  the court.[4]Â \r\n  The probate court granted Carroll's petition to remove these matters to circuit\r\n  court.Â  \r\nChurch then filed a complaint in\r\n  circuit court asserting the following causes of action:Â  Enforcement of\r\n  Specific Bequest, Quantum Meruit, Fraud, Intentional Infliction of Emotional\r\n  Distress, Unfair Trade Practices, and Constructive Trust. Â The circuit court\r\n  conducted a non-jury trial and dismissed the causes of action for fraud, intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress, and unfair trade practices.Â  The court later issued\r\n  a written order denying Church's request to remove Carroll as personal\r\n  representative and concluding that Church was not entitled to compensation for\r\n  her alleged caregiving services.Â  The order also allowed a setoff of $6,000\r\n  against the $100,000 bequest to Church to compensate the estate for funds\r\n  Decedent had invested in a mobile home sold by Church after Decedent's death.Â \r\n  The circuit court denied Carroll's request for a $35,000 setoff to compensate\r\n  the estate for personal property taken by Church and ordered Carroll to immediately\r\n  pay to Church $94,000 plus prejudgment interest running from the date of\r\n  Decedent's death.Â  These cross-appeals followed.\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  \r\n    1.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in failing to remove Carroll as personal representative of Decedent's\r\n  estate when Carroll allegedly misrepresented the value of estate assets and\r\n  engaged in self-dealing?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    2.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in concluding that Church was not entitled to relief under the theory\r\n  of constructive trust when Carroll and Ted allegedly engaged in self-dealing concerning\r\n  an asset that should have been included in the estate? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    3.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in concluding that Church was not entitled to relief in quantum\r\n  meruit when she conferred a benefit on the estate?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court violate Rule 52(a), SCRCP, by failing to make separate findings of fact\r\n  as to each issue?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in failing to allow a $35,000 setoff against the $100,000 bequest to\r\n  Church to compensate the estate for personal property she kept?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    6.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit\r\n  court err in awarding prejudgment interest to Church?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review applicable to cases originating in the\r\n  probate court and removed to circuit court is controlled by whether the\r\n  underlying cause of action is at law or in equity.Â  Blackmon v.\r\n    Weaver, 366 S.C. 245,\r\n  248-49, 621 S.E.2d 42, 43-44 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  &quot;When\r\n  legal and equitable causes of action are maintained in\r\n  one suit, the court is presented with a divided scope of review.&quot; Id.Â  &quot;On appeal from an\r\n  action at law that was tried without a jury, the appellate court can correct\r\n  errors of law, but the findings of fact will not be disturbed unless found to\r\n  be without evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;In an equitable action tried without a jury, the appellate court can\r\n  correct errors of law and may find facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, the\r\n  causes of action for removal of a personal representative, constructive trust,\r\n  quantum meruit, and setoff are equitable causes of action.Â  See Gignilliat\r\n    v. Gignilliat, Savitz &amp; Bettis, L.L.P., 385 S.C. 452, 466, 684 S.E.2d\r\n  756, 764&nbsp;(2009) (stating that quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied\r\n  by law contract are equivalent terms for an equitable remedy); Lollis v. Lollis, 291 S.C. 525, 530, 354 S.E.2d 559,\r\n  561&nbsp;(1987) (holding that an action to declare a constructive trust is in\r\n  equity); W. M. Kirkland, Inc. v. Providence Washington Ins. Co., 264\r\n  S.C. 573, 580, 216 S.E.2d 518, 521&nbsp;(1975) (stating that a setoff belongs\r\n  to the inherent power of a court in the exercise of its equitable\r\n  jurisdiction); Blackmon, 366 S.C. at 248, 621 S.E.2d at 43 (holding that\r\n  an action to remove a personal representative is equitable in nature).\r\nOur equitable standard of\r\n  review does not require this court to ignore the findings of the trial\r\n  judge who heard the witnesses.Â  Thomas v. Mitchell, 287 S.C. 35, 38, 336\r\n  S.E.2d 154, 155&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1985).Â  Decisions relative to the veracity\r\n  and credibility of witnesses can best be made by the trial judge who heard the\r\n  witnesses and observed their demeanor.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Church's\r\n  Appeal\r\nA. Removal\r\n  of Personal Representative\r\nChurch assigns error\r\n  to the circuit court's failure to remove Carroll as personal representative of Decedent's\r\n  estate.Â  She asserts that Carroll willfully misrepresented the value of estate\r\n  assets and engaged in self-dealing.Â  In particular, she argues\r\n  that after Carroll and Ted purchased Decedent's interests in some of\r\n  their real estate partnerships, they sold the partnership assets for much more\r\n  than the value they had assigned to them for purposes of purchasing Decedent's\r\n  interests.Â  We find no malfeasance. \r\nSection 62-3-611 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2009) provides for the removal of an estate's personal\r\n  representative for cause:\r\n\r\n  (a) A person interested in the estate may petition for removal of a\r\n    personal representative for cause at any time. . . .\r\n  (b) Cause for removal exists when removal would be in the best\r\n    interests of the estate, or if it is shown that a personal representative or\r\n    the person seeking his appointment intentionally misrepresented material\r\n      facts in the proceedings leading to his appointment, or that the personal\r\n    representative has disregarded an order of the court, has become incapable of\r\n    discharging the duties of his office, or has mismanaged the estate or\r\n    failed to perform any duty pertaining to the office. . . . \r\n\r\n(emphases\r\n  added).\r\n&quot;[T]here is a strong\r\n  deference shown to the personal representative chosen by the testator.&quot;Â  Blackmon, 366 S.C. at\r\n  251, 621 S.E.2d at 45. Â &quot;'The [c]ourts have ever been reluctant to take the\r\n  management of an estate from those to whom it has been confided by the\r\n  testator, for to that extent the intention expressed in his will would be\r\n  defeated.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Smith v. Heyward, 115 S.C. 145,\r\n  164, 105 S.E. 275, 282 (1920)). &quot;The power to\r\n  remove a personal representative 'should be [exercised] with great caution, and\r\n  not at all, unless it is made to appear to be necessary for the protection of\r\n  the estate, to prevent loss or injury to it from misappropriation,\r\n  maladministration or fraud.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Smith, 115 S.C.\r\n  at 164-65, 105 S.E. at 282). \r\nWe\r\n  find no credible evidence of malfeasance on the part of Carroll.Â  Additionally, Respondents'\r\n  certified public accountant testified that it is a normal practice to pay\r\n  capital account value for a decedent's small interest in a real estate\r\n  partnership, as Carroll and Ted did when they paid for Decedent's 7.14 percent\r\n  interest in one of their partnerships.Â  Respondents also presented testimony\r\n  showing that some of the assets of the partnerships in which Decedent had an\r\n  interest increased in value after Decedent's death.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nBased on the foregoing, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's rejection of Church's request to remove Carroll as personal\r\n  representative.\r\nB. Constructive\r\n  Trust\r\nChurch argues that funds generated\r\n  from Carroll's and Ted's alleged improper self-dealing should be considered held\r\n  in a constructive trust from which Church should be compensated for her contributions\r\n  to the McGee family's six-plex apartments.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n  A constructive trust results &quot;[whenever] circumstances under\r\n    which property was acquired make it inequitable that it be retained by the one\r\n    holding legal title. These circumstances include fraud, bad faith, abuse of\r\n    confidence, or violation of a fiduciary duty which gives rise to an obligation\r\n    in equity to make restitution.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\nMacaulay\r\n  v. Wachovia Bank of S.C., N.A., 351 S.C. 287, 294, 569\r\n  S.E.2d 371, 375&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2002)&nbsp;(quoting Hendrix v.\r\n    Hendrix, 299 S.C. 233,\r\n  235, 383 S.E.2d 468, 469 (Ct. App. 1989)).Â  \r\nFor the reasons stated in the\r\n  discussion of Church's request to remove Carroll as personal representative, we\r\n  believe the preponderance of the evidence supports the circuit court's finding\r\n  that there was no malfeasance on Carroll's part.Â  Therefore, we affirm the\r\n  circuit court's rejection of Church's constructive trust claim. \r\nC. Quantum\r\n  Meruit\r\nChurch contends that the circuit\r\n  court erroneously denied her quantum meruit claim.Â  She maintains that the\r\n  evidence shows she expected to be compensated when she rendered caregiving\r\n  services to Decedent.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Myrtle\r\n  Beach Hospital, Inc. v. City of Myrtle Beach, our\r\n  supreme court adopted the following standard for a claim of compensation in\r\n  quantum meruit:Â (1) a\r\n    benefit conferred by the plaintiff upon the defendant; (2) the realization of that\r\n  benefit by the defendant; and (3) retention of the benefit by the\r\n  defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it\r\n  without paying its value.Â  341 S.C. 1, 8-9, 532 S.E.2d 868, 872&nbsp;(2000).Â  In Sauner v. Public Service Authority of South Carolina, the supreme court\r\n  specified that the benefit conferred must be nongratuitous.Â  354\r\n  S.C. 397, 409, 581 S.E.2d 161, 167-68&nbsp;(2003).Â  The\r\n  &quot;nongratuitous&quot; requirement may also be found in prior case law\r\n  discussing compensation for caregiving services.Â  See In re\r\n    Limehouse's Estate, 198 S.C. 15, 21, 16 S.E.2d 1, 4&nbsp;(1941)&nbsp;(holding\r\n  that services rendered gratuitously cannot afterwards be converted into a\r\n  charge).\r\nHere,\r\n  Church disputes the circuit court's finding that her love for Decedent was the\r\n  only reason she performed services for him.Â  However, her own testimony\r\n  supports this finding.Â  Because the testimony shows that Church's services were\r\n  gratuitous, her quantum meruit claim must fail.Â  \r\nD. Rule 52(a), SCRCP\r\nChurch argues that\r\n  the circuit court committed reversible error in failing to make specific\r\n  findings of fact in violation of Rule 52(a), SCRCP.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;In all actions\r\n  tried upon the facts without a jury or with an advisory jury, the court shall\r\n  find the facts specially and state separately its conclusions of law thereon[.]&quot; Rule\r\n  52(a), SCRCP.Â  However, &quot;[t]he rule is\r\n  directorial in nature[,] so 'where a trial court substantially complies with Rule\r\n  52(a) and adequately states the basis for the result\r\n  it reaches, the appellate court should not\r\n  vacate the trial court's judgment for lack of an explicit or specific factual\r\n  finding.'&quot;Â  In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122,\r\n  131, 568 S.E.2d 338, 342&nbsp;(2002) (quoting Noisette v. Ismail,\r\n  304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 123-24 (1991)).Â  &quot;We\r\n  do not require a lower court to set out findings on all the myriad factual\r\n  questions arising in a particular case.&quot;Â  Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at\r\n  133, 568 S.E.2d at 343.Â  &quot;But the findings must be sufficient to allow\r\n  this Court, sitting in its appellate capacity, to ensure the law is faithfully\r\n  executed below.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nChurch lists seven\r\n  items that she contends are factual issues on which the circuit court\r\n  erroneously failed to make findings of fact.Â  The only one of these items that\r\n  is not addressed in the circuit court's order is the following:Â  &quot;The\r\n  refusal to grant an adverse inference and to question the credibility of Ted O.\r\n  McGee, Jr. who avoided testifying at the final hearing by leaving and not being\r\n  subject to subpoena . . . .&quot;Â  We do not believe that the circuit court was\r\n  required to make an explicit finding of fact concerning its assessment of Ted's\r\n  credibility.Â  See Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 131, 568 S.E.2d at 342\r\n  (holding that when a trial court adequately states the basis for the result it\r\n  reaches, the appellate court should not vacate the trial court's judgment for\r\n  lack of an explicit factual finding).Â  \r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we do not believe the circuit court violated Rule 52(a), SCRCP. \r\nII. Respondents'\r\n  Appeal\r\n  \r\nA. Setoff\r\nRespondents argue\r\n  that the circuit court erred in failing to award them a setoff in an amount to\r\n  compensate for the personal property Church kept.Â  We disagree.Â  Church\r\n  testified that the items she took were either gifts from Decedent or purchased\r\n  with their jointly owned funds.Â  We defer to the circuit court's assessment of Church's\r\n  credibility on this issue.Â  See Thomas, 287 S.C. at 38, 336\r\n  S.E.2d at 155 (holding that decisions relative to the veracity and credibility\r\n  of witnesses can best be made by the trial judge who heard the witnesses and\r\n  observed their demeanor).Â  Therefore, the circuit court's denial of a setoff\r\n  for $35,000 is affirmed.Â  \r\nB. Prejudgment Interest\r\nRespondents assert\r\n  that the circuit court erred in awarding prejudgment interest because the\r\n  standard for awarding prejudgment interest was not met in this case.Â  They also\r\n  argue that Church's &quot;claim&quot; for the $100,000 bequest did not arise on\r\n  the date of Decedent's death as the circuit court concluded.Â  We agree. Â \r\nAs an initial matter,\r\n  Church contends that Respondents did not preserve for appellate review their\r\n  grounds for assigning error to the award of prejudgment interest.Â  Respondents\r\n  assert that counsel's objection to the introduction of evidence concerning\r\n  prejudgment interest sufficiently preserved for review the arguments presented\r\n  on appeal and that the circuit court in essence ruled on these arguments.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nPost-trial motions\r\n  are not necessary to preserve issues that have already been ruled on; they are\r\n  used to preserve those that have been raised to the trial court but not yet\r\n  ruled on by it. Â Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497 S.E.2d 731,\r\n  734&nbsp;(1998).Â  Here, the circuit court's ruling that Church was entitled to\r\n  prejudgment interest implied by necessity that she met the standard for an\r\n  award of prejudgment interest.Â  Further, the circuit court's ruling that the\r\n  interest would start running as of the date of Decedent's death implied that\r\n  Church's claim arose on that date.Â  Therefore, the grounds presented on appeal\r\n  are preserved for review.Â  Cf. Spence v. Wingate, 381 S.C. 487, 489-90,\r\n  674 S.E.2d 169, 170&nbsp;(2009) (holding that the issue of a duty based on the\r\n  existence of a prior attorney-client relationship was preserved for review\r\n  because the trial court's order addressed the plaintiff's argument by ruling that\r\n  the defendants &quot;owed no duty or obligation&quot; to the plaintiff and\r\n  therefore the plaintiff was not required to file a Rule 59(e) motion to\r\n  preserve the issue).\r\nMoving on to the\r\n  merits of the issue, prejudgment interest may be awarded pursuant to section 34-31-20(A)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) in the following cases:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money\r\n    shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the\r\n    legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per\r\n    annum.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court has\r\n  interpreted section 34-31-20(A) as follows:\r\n\r\n  The law permits the award of prejudgment interest when a monetary obligation is a sum certain, or is capable of\r\n    being reduced to certainty, accruing from the time payment may be demanded\r\n    either by the agreement of the parties or the operation of law. Â Generally, prejudgment interest may not be recovered on an\r\n    unliquidated claim in the absence of agreement or statute. Â The fact that the\r\n    amount due is disputed does not render the claim unliquidated for purposes of\r\n    awarding prejudgment interest. Â Rather, the proper\r\n      test is whether or not the measure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of\r\n      damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.\r\n\r\nAustin\r\n  v. Stokes-Craven Holding Corp., 387 S.C. 22, 58, 691\r\n  S.E.2d 135, 154&nbsp;(2010)&nbsp;(citations and internal quotation marks omitted)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nThe question in the\r\n  present case is whether the measure of recovery for the $100,000 bequest was fixed\r\n  by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.Â  To answer this question,\r\n  this court must first determine when the claim arose,[5] and then decide if the measure of\r\n  recovery was fixed by conditions existing at that time.Â  Church maintains that the\r\n  measure of recovery was fixed in time at Decedent's death and that Respondents\r\n  have not provided proof showing otherwise.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe point in time that a claim for the object of a\r\n  bequest arises necessarily depends on when the legatee has a legal right to it.Â  See Black's Law Dictionary 281 (9th ed. 2009) (defining\r\n  &quot;claim&quot; as the aggregate of operative facts giving rise to a right\r\n  enforceable by a court).Â  Under the South Carolina Probate Code, a legatee has\r\n  a legal right to the object of the bequest only when and if the estate has\r\n  sufficient assets after all debts and expenses of administration have been\r\n  paid.Â  Section 62-3-101 of the South Carolina Code (2009) provides in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  Upon the death of a person, his real property devolves to the\r\n    persons to whom it is devised by his last will . . . or in the absence of\r\n    testamentary disposition, to his heirs . . . subject to the purpose of\r\n      satisfying claims as to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors, and\r\n      the purposes of administration . . . and his personal property devolves,\r\n        first, to his personal representative, for the purpose of satisfying claims as\r\n        to exempt property rights and the rights of creditors, and the purposes of\r\n        administration . . . . and, at the expiration of three years after\r\n    the decedent's death, if not yet distributed by the personal representative,\r\n    his personal property devolves to those persons to whom it is devised by will\r\n    or who are his heirs in intestacy, or their substitutes, as the case may be, just\r\n      as with respect to real property.Â  \r\n\r\n(emphases\r\n  added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-711 (2009) (allowing a personal\r\n  representative to apply personal property in the estate to the benefit of\r\n  creditors); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-805 (2009) (setting forth payment priorities\r\n  in the event that the estate's assets are insufficient to pay all creditors'\r\n  claims in full).Â  It is evident from a reading of section 62-3-101 that generally,\r\n  a personal representative has up to three years after the decedent's death to\r\n  distribute personal property to legatees.Â  \r\nHere, Decedent died\r\n  on January 12, 2003.Â  Pursuant to section 62-3-101, the $100,000, if left in\r\n  the estate, could have devolved to Church, at the latest, on or about January\r\n  12, 2006, three years after Decedent's death.Â  However, in the interim, Church\r\n  initiated this litigation, and, therefore, administration of Decedent's estate\r\n  is ongoing.Â  Section 62-3-101 provides that the devolution of a decedent's\r\n  property to a legatee is subject to a personal representative's power to shift\r\n  title to himself where required in administration and to protect the rights of\r\n  creditors or others.Â  Whether justified or not, this very litigation has delayed\r\n  the closing of the estate and has created additional expenses for the estate's\r\n  administration.\r\nBased on the foregoing,\r\n  Church's &quot;claim&quot; for the $100,000 bequeathed to her has not yet\r\n  arisen because its payment takes a back seat to the rights of creditors, taxing\r\n  authorities, and expenses of administration, which have not yet been finally\r\n  determined.Â  Because the claim is not yet &quot;due,&quot; it does not fall\r\n  within the terms of section 34-31-20(A) authorizing prejudgment interest.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the circuit court's award of prejudgment interest was inappropriate and should\r\n  be reversed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we REVERSE the award of prejudgment interest, AFFIRM the circuit court on the\r\n  remaining assignments of error, and REMAND for further proceedings\r\n  consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\nFEW, C.J., and\r\n  HUFF, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We\r\n  order that the case caption be amended to reflect the correct spelling of Decedent's\r\n  middle name, which is &quot;LuRue&quot; rather than &quot;LaRue.&quot;Â  Â Â \r\n[2] The\r\n  official name of the trust is reflected in the case caption.Â  For the sake of\r\n  brevity, we will refer to the trust as &quot;the McGee family trust.&quot;\r\n[3] Decedent's mother had died a few years before Decedent died.Â  \r\n[4] The specific provisions\r\n  governing administration of an estate under the continuing authority of the court are in S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-3-501 to -505 (2009).\r\n[5] The\r\n  use of the term &quot;claim&quot; should not be confused with the claim that a\r\n  creditor makes against the estate under the Probate Code.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 62-3-801 to -816 (2009) (addressing creditors' claims against an\r\n  estate).Â  In the above discussion, the use of the term &quot;claim&quot; merely\r\n  refers to Church's legal right to take possession or title to the property\r\n  bequeathed to her in Decedent's will.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4783","title":"Long v.

Russo, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4783\r\n  Heard September 16, 2010 â€“ Filed January\r\n26, 2011Â  \r\n\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Jeffrey S. Jones, of Greenville, for\r\n          Appellants.\r\n        R.

Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics, 316 S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618 (1994), our\r\n  supreme court dismissed an appeal from a circuit court order remanding to the\r\n  Workers' Compensation Commission and stated &quot;we have consistently held\r\n  that an order of the circuit court remanding a case for additional proceedings\r\n  before an administrative agency is not directly appealable.&quot;Â  316 S.C. at 52,\r\n  446 S.E.2d at 618.Â  In Leviner v. Sonoco Products Co., 339 S.C. 492, 530\r\n  S.E.2d 127 (2000), the supreme court cited Montjoy in dismissing a\r\n  circuit court order remanding to the commission even though the supreme court\r\n  characterized the order as &quot;final.&quot;Â  The court stated: &quot;While final, this order was not directly\r\n  appealable since it remanded the matter to the single commissioner for further\r\n  proceedings.&quot;Â  339 S.C. at 494, 530\r\n  S.E.2d at 128.Â  As we have\r\n  been required to do, this court has consistently followed Montjoy when\r\n  deciding the appealability of circuit court orders in workers' compensation\r\n  cases.Â  See, e.g., Foggie v.\r\n    Gen. Elec., 376 S.C. 384, 388, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 395, 398 (Ct. App. 2008) (quoting above passage from Montjoy in\r\n  holding remand order unappealable).\r\nHowever,\r\n  we have distinguished Montjoy in limited situations, which are not\r\n  applicable on the facts of this case.Â  In Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 324 S.C. 628, 479 S.E.2d 831 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1996),[1] this court found the circuit court's order remanding to the commission\r\n  appealable because &quot;additional proceedings [were] not required . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  324 S.C. at 632 n.2, 479 S.E.2d at 834 n.2.Â  Noting the &quot;order remanded the case merely for a mathematical\r\n  calculation of death benefits, rather than for any judgment on the merits,&quot; this court stated &quot;further proceedings on remand are purely\r\n  ministerial and do not require the exercise of independent judgment or\r\n  discretion on the part of the commission.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn this case, the commission's finding that Long did not report\r\n  the injury within the statutory notice period ended the action.Â  Under the\r\n  circuit court's order in this case, the commission must determine on remand\r\n  whether the injury occurred during the scope and course of employment, set the\r\n  claimant's average weekly wage and compensation rate, and answer other\r\n  questions which may arise.Â  Therefore, we find no basis on which to distinguish Montjoy as we did in Hicks.Â  Rather, we find the commission must\r\n  conduct additional proceedings before a final judgment is reached.Â  Thus, Montjoy controls, and this order is not appealable.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find support for this conclusion in the recent decision of Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\n    Hospital Authority v. South Carolina Department of Health &amp; Environmental\r\n    Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010).Â  In Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\r\n  the supreme court dismissed an appeal from the Administrative Law Court because\r\n  its order was &quot;not a final decision which is immediately appealable under\r\n  [section] 1-23-610 [of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010)].&quot;Â  387 S.C. at\r\n  267, 692 S.E.2d at 895.Â  The court held that the general appealability\r\n  provisions in section 14-3-330 of the South Carolina Code (1976), which\r\n  sometimes allow appeal of interlocutory orders, are &quot;inapplicable&quot;\r\n  because section 1-23-610 is a more specific statute and &quot;limits review to\r\n  final decisions of the ALC.&quot;Â  387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894.Â  The\r\n  reasoning of Charlotte-Mecklenburg applies to appeals from the Workers'\r\n  Compensation Commission, which are governed by section 1-23-380 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).Â  Like its ALC counterpart relied on in Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\r\n  section 1-23-380 is a more specific statute that limits review to &quot;a final\r\n  decision . . . .&quot;Â  Id.[2]Â \r\n  Under the reasoning of Charlotte-Mecklenburg and in light of section\r\n  1-23-380, the general appealability provisions of section 14-3-330 are\r\n  &quot;inapplicable&quot; to the extent they &quot;permit the appeal of\r\n  interlocutory orders of . . . an administrative agency.&quot;Â  387 S.C. at 266,\r\n  692 S.E.2d at 894.Â  \r\nFurther, Charlotte-Mecklenburg specifically overruled two decisions of this court\r\n  in which we found interlocutory orders appealable under section 14-3-330.Â  387\r\n  S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n  To the\r\n    extent Canteen v. McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682\r\n    S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009) and Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina\r\n      Department of Health and Environmental Control, [381] S.C. 120, 671 S.E.2d\r\n    646 (Ct. App. 2009) rely on Â§ 14-3-330 to permit the appeal of interlocutory\r\n    orders of the ALC or an administrative agency, those cases are overruled.Â  \r\n\r\n387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at\r\n  894.Â  Canteen is an appeal from the Workers' Compensation Commission, 384\r\n  S.C. at 619, 682 S.E.2d at 504, and Oakwood Landfill is an appeal from\r\n  the Board of the Department of Health and Environmental Control reviewing the\r\n  decision of the ALC.Â  381 S.C. at 127, 671 S.E.2d at 650. Â In Canteen we\r\n  quoted at length from this court's opinion in Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc.,\r\n  366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We relied on Brown in\r\n  finding the order appealable, stating &quot;we find this case is similar to . .\r\n  . Brown because the Appellate Panel finally determined the brain injury\r\n  issue on the merits by denying compensation for Canteen's brain injury.&quot;[3]Â  Canteen, 384 S.C. at 624, 682 S.E.2d at 507.Â  As Canteen is based\r\n  on the same reasoning as Brown, the supreme court's decision in Charlotte-Mecklenburg expressly overruling Canteen is at least an\r\n  implicit rejection of Brown.Â  In light of Charlotte-Mecklenburg,\r\n  we can find no basis on which to distinguish any decisions, including Brown,[4] which rely on section 14-3-330 in finding a decision of the commission\r\n  appealable.Â  Accordingly, we believe the supreme court has effectively\r\n  overruled Brown, and we will no longer apply it.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the order on appeal remands the case to the commission for additional\r\n  proceedings. Â Â Accordingly, it is not a final judgment and the order is not\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  The order may be appealed after final judgment.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs. \r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J. (dissenting):Â  Respectfully, I\r\n  dissent.Â  The majority dismisses this appeal on the ground that the circuit\r\n  court's order is interlocutory.Â  I disagree because I believe the circuit\r\n  court's decision touches upon the merits and therefore constitutes a final\r\n  judgment for purposes of our jurisdiction over a workers' compensation appeal.Â \r\n  For a complete understanding of our jurisdiction in this matter, it is\r\n  necessary to begin with the governing statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-390 (Supp.\r\n  2010), and then to trace the evolution of published opinions interpreting this\r\n  statute.Â  \r\nSection 1-23-390 states:\r\n\r\n  An aggrieved party may obtain a review of a final judgment of the circuit court or the court of appeals pursuant to this article by taking\r\n    an appeal in the manner provided by the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules as\r\n    in other civil cases.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Our\r\n  supreme court quoted this statute in its opinion in Montjoy\r\n    v. Asten-Hill Dryer Fabrics; however, in\r\n  determining if the circuit court's order was appealable,\r\n  the supreme court focused only on whether the order included language\r\n  remanding the case for additional proceedings.Â  316\r\n  S.C. 52, 446 S.E.2d 618&nbsp;(1994).Â  The court did not expressly\r\n  evaluate the nature of the issues raised on appeal.Â  Id. Â Under section 1-23-390, it was logical for our supreme\r\n  court to hold that a circuit court ruling remanding\r\n  a case to the Commission was not immediately appealable when the appeal\r\n  challenged only the propriety of the remand.Â  See Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C. 491, 491-92, 316 S.E.2d\r\n  385&nbsp;(1984); Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 343-44, 306 S.E.2d 621,\r\n  622&nbsp;(1983).Â  Such an appeal does not involve the merits of the case.Â  On\r\n  the other hand, a circuit court ruling on the merits has finality with respect\r\n  to the issue decided and will become the law of the case if it is not\r\n  immediately appealed.[5]Â \r\n  Therefore, it is untenable to label such a ruling as interlocutory merely\r\n  because it is accompanied by language remanding the case for further\r\n  proceedings.Â  Â Â \r\nMore recent published precedent,\r\n  beginning with Brown v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., has carefully scrutinized\r\n  the language in remand orders, recognizing the benchmark set forth by Montjoy's\r\n  predecessorsâ€”whether an order &quot;involves the merits&quot;â€” and thus\r\n  reaffirming the legislative intent behind the term &quot;final judgment&quot;\r\n  as set forth in section 1-23-390:\r\n\r\n  The question here is whether the circuit court order is a &quot;final\r\n    judgment&quot; under section 1-23-390. Generally, an order is a final judgment\r\n    on one or more issues if it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits. In Owens v. Canal Wood Corp., 281 S.C.\r\n    491, 316 S.E.2d 385 (1984), one of the two cases\r\n    cited by the Montjoy court,[6] the supreme court found the order of\r\n    the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action. Â It is therefore\r\n    interlocutory and not reviewable by this Court for lack of finality. Â Similarly,\r\n    in Hunt v. Whitt, 279 S.C. 343, 306 S.E.2d 621 (1983), the supreme court held that because the interlocutory\r\n    order of the circuit court does not involve the merits of the action, it is not\r\n    reviewable by this Court for lack of finality. Â Accordingly, in determining\r\n    whether the court's order constitutes a final judgment, we must inquire whether\r\n    the order finally decides an issue on the merits. Â An\r\n      order involves the merits if it finally determines some substantial matter\r\n      forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense in the case. \r\n\r\n366 S.C. 379, 387, 622 S.E.2d\r\n  546, 551 (Ct. App. 2005) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted)\r\n  (emphasis added); see also Foggie v. Gen.\r\n    Elec. Co., 376 S.C. 384, 389, 656 S.E.2d 395, 398&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2008) (&quot;[W]here the circuit court's\r\n  order constitutes a final decision on the merits and the remand order\r\n    has no effect on the finality of the decision, the order is immediately\r\n  appealable.&quot;) (emphases added).Â  \r\nThis court followed the same\r\n  analysis in Mungo v. Rental Uniform Service of\r\n    Florence, Inc.:\r\n\r\n  This Court has held that an order of the circuit court remanding a\r\n    case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is not directly\r\n    appealable. Â However, if the circuit court's order is a final judgment, then it\r\n    is immediately appealable. Generally, an order is a final judgment on one or\r\n      more issues if it constitutes an ultimate decision on the merits. Â An\r\n        order involves the merits if it finally determines some substantial matter\r\n        forming the whole or part of some cause of action or defense in the case. \r\n\r\n383 S.C. 270,\r\n  277-78, 678 S.E.2d 825, 829&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (internal citations and\r\n  quotation marks omitted) (emphases added).[7]Â \r\n  The more recent interpretation of section 1-23-390 in Brown and Mungo properly carries out the legislature's intent because allowing an immediate\r\n  appeal of any ultimate decision on the merits gives the appellant an opportunity\r\n  to prevent the decision from becoming the law of the case.Â  See Unisun Ins. Co. v. Schmidt, 339 S.C. 362, 368, 529 S.E.2d 280, 283&nbsp;(2000)\r\n  (&quot;We will reject a statutory interpretation when to accept it would lead\r\n  to a result so plainly absurd that it could not have been intended by the\r\n  legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.&quot;); Foggie, 376 S.C. at 391, 656 S.E.2d at 399 (Pieper, J., dissenting) (&quot;[T]he circuit court did not merely remand for further\r\n  proceedings, but finally determined the defense of set-off or credit that\r\n  ultimately will be binding on the parties and the Commission on remand.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nIn comparison to section\r\n  1-23-390, section 14-3-330(1) implicitly recognizes the danger of a ruling on\r\n  the merits becoming the law of the case. Subsection (1) of section 14-3-330 allows\r\n  the appellate court to review a ruling involving the merits when it is not\r\n  appealed until final judgment is entered on the entire case:\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction\r\n    of errors of law in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n  (1) Any intermediate judgment, order or\r\n    decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of\r\n    common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed\r\n    there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such\r\n    actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the\r\n    court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or\r\n    decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from[.]Â  \r\n\r\nAlthough section 1-23-390 has\r\n  no such safeguard, in Brunson v. American Koyo Bearings, this court\r\n  recognized the similarities between the application of 14-3-330 and that of\r\n  statutes governing administrative law matters: \r\n\r\n  South\r\n    Carolina adheres to the final judgment rule. Â Accordingly, with certain\r\n    exceptions, an appeal lies only from a final judgment.Â  By statute, an appeal\r\n    from an interlocutory order is permitted in certain circumstances, including\r\n    when the order is one involving the merits ... [or] affecting a substantial\r\n    right.Â  Appeals from administrative bodies, such as the Workers'\r\n    Compensation Commission, follow the same rules, such that an appeal will\r\n    not lie from an interlocutory order of the Commission unless the order affects\r\n    the merits or deprives the appellant of a substantial right.Â  Orders from the\r\n    Commission remanding a case to the single commissioner for further proceedings generally do not affect the merits and are not considered final.\r\n\r\n367 S.C. 161, 165, 623 S.E.2d\r\n  870, 872 &nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;2005) (citations and quotation marks omitted)\r\n  (emphases added).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the\r\n  majority relies on the supreme court's opinion in Charlotte-Mecklenburg\r\n    Hospital Authority v. South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\n    Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894&nbsp;(2010), for the proposition that Brown is no longer good law.Â  The majority\r\n  reasons that because Charlotte-Mecklenburg overruled Canteen v.\r\n    McLeod Regional Medical Center, 384 S.C. 617, 682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n  and because Canteen relied on the analysis in Brown, Charlotte-Mecklenburg implicitly rejected Brown.Â  Significantly,\r\n  our supreme court denied certiorari in Brown; and, on the same day the\r\n  court issued its opinion in Charlotte-Mecklenburg, it denied certiorari\r\n  in Mungo, specifically declining to address this court's analyses in Brown and Mungo when it had the opportunity to do so.Â  \r\nFurther, the Charlotte-Mecklenburg opinion states that the opinions in Canteen and Oakwood Landfill, Inc. v. South Carolina Department of Health and\r\n  Environmental Control are overruled only to the extent that they rely on\r\n    section 14-3-330 to permit the appeal of an administrative agency's\r\n  interlocutory order:Â  \r\n\r\n  To the extent Canteen v. McLeod Reg'l Med. Ctr., 384 S.C. 617,\r\n    682 S.E.2d 504 (Ct. App. 2009) and Oakwood\r\n      Landfill, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl. Control, 381 S.C. 120,\r\n    671 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2009), rely on Â§ 14-3-330 to permit the appeal\r\n    of interlocutory orders of the ALC or an administrative agency, those cases are overruled.\r\n\r\n\r\n  387 S.C. at 266, 692 S.E.2d at 894 (emphases added).Â  Therefore, to the extent\r\n  that Canteen and Oakwood do not rely on section 14-3-330,\r\n  they are still good law.Â  This includes their reliance on the definition of\r\n  &quot;final judgment&quot; enunciated in Brown.Â  \r\nBecause appeals from\r\n  administrative bodies follow the same basic analysis in determining whether a\r\n  ruling constitutes a &quot;final judgment,&quot;[8] it is safe to assume that Brown and those workers' compensation opinions\r\n  citing Brown do not incorrectly rely on section 14-3-330, but rather\r\n  those opinions properly rely on section 1-23-390 and simply follow the same\r\n  jurisprudence employed to interpret section 14-3-330.Â  In fact, Brown does not cite section 14-3-330, but explicitly cites section 1-23-390 and\r\n  defines the term &quot;final judgment&quot; as used in that statute.[9]Â Â  Charlotte-Mecklenburg, on the other hand,\r\n  does not address the appealability of a circuit court order under section\r\n  1-23-390, but rather examines the appealability of an administrative agency's\r\n  order under another statute.Â  \r\nApplying our published case\r\n  law interpreting section 1-23-390 to the present case, I would hold the circuit\r\n  court's decision that Claimant gave timely notice of her accidental injury to\r\n  Employer is the type of judgment that is an ultimate decision on the merits\r\n  because it finally determines some substantial matter forming\r\n  a defense available to Sealed Air. Â See Brown, 366 S.C. at\r\n  387, 622 S.E.2d at 551 (&quot;An order involves the\r\n  merits if it finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or\r\n  part of some cause of action or defense in the case.&quot;).Â  This is a\r\n  final decision on the merits, and the remand language in the order has no\r\n  effect on the finality of that decision.Â  See Foggie, 376 S.C. at\r\n  389, 656 S.E.2d at 398 (&quot;[W]here the circuit\r\n  court's order constitutes a final decision on the merits and the remand order\r\n  has no effect on the finality of the decision, the order is immediately\r\n  appealable.&quot;).Â  \r\nThe circuit court's order\r\n  does not allow the Commission to pursue the issue of notice any further, and\r\n  thus the decision is the law of the case unless immediately appealed.Â  In other words, because the circuit court\r\n  obviously meant for its decision on the issue of notice to be binding on the\r\n  parties, it will become the law of the case if it is not immediately appealed.Â  Cf. McLendon, 313 S.C. at 526 n.2, 443 S.E.2d at 540 n.2&nbsp;(interpreting\r\n  section 14-3-330 and holding that, like the denial of a motion for summary\r\n  judgment, the denial of a motion to dismiss does not establish the law of the\r\n  case and the issue raised by the motion can be raised again at a later stage of\r\n  the proceedings and, therefore, is not directly appealable); Foggie, 376 S.C. at 391, 656 S.E.2d at 399 (Pieper, J., dissenting) (&quot;[T]he circuit court did not merely remand for further\r\n  proceedings, but finally determined the defense of set-off or credit that\r\n  ultimately will be binding on the parties and the Commission on remand.&quot;)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  In enacting section 1-23-390, the legislature could not have\r\n  possibly intended to preclude the immediate appeal of a determination that will\r\n  otherwise become the law of the case when such a result would deny parties to\r\n  administrative proceedings a meaningful opportunity to be heard.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would address\r\n  the merits of the instant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This court also distinguished Montjoy in Brown\r\n  v. Greenwood Mills, Inc., 366 S.C. 379, 622 S.E.2d 546 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We\r\n  discuss Brown below in light of the supreme court's recent decision in Charlotte-Mecklenburg Hospital Authority v. South Carolina\r\n    Department of Health &amp; Environmental Control, 387 S.C. 265, 692 S.E.2d 894 (2010).\r\n[2] See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-390 (Supp. 2010) (providing for\r\n  review of a &quot;final judgment&quot; of the circuit court).\r\n[3] We also relied on Green v. City of Columbia,\r\n  311 S.C. 78, 80, 427 S.E.2d 685, 687 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding an interlocutory\r\n  order appealable because it &quot;involved the merits,&quot; without\r\n  specifically mentioning section 14-3-330), decided before Montjoy.\r\n[4] We acknowledge that Brown does not\r\n  specifically mention section 14-3-330.Â  However, the Brown court's holding\r\n  that the appealed order is a &quot;final judgment&quot; under section 1-23-390\r\n  is based on a finding that the order &quot;involves the merits,&quot; a concept\r\n  that is relevant only under section 14-3-330.Â  366 S.C. at 387, 622 S.E.2d at\r\n  551.Â  Therefore, we believe Brown relies on section 14-3-330.\r\n[5] Cf.

Pachak, of Columbia, for\r\n  Appellant/Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tJ. Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Jimmy Lee\r\n  Duncan pled guilty to first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor\r\n  in 2000.Â  The trial court sentenced him to fifteen years' imprisonment,\r\n  suspended upon five years' probation.Â  In 2003, Duncan pled guilty to\r\n  third-degree burglary, and the trial court sentenced him to five years'\r\n  imprisonment, revoked his probation for the first-degree CSC with a minor\r\n  conviction, and reinstated seven years of his fifteen-year CSC sentence.Â  Upon\r\n  his release in February 2008, Duncan began a community supervision\r\n  program (CSP).Â  In July 2008, the trial court revoked Duncan's CSP because he willfully\r\n  violated the terms of his CSP and ordered him to serve 127 days' imprisonment.Â \r\n  In addition, the trial court ordered Duncan to wear an active electronic\r\n  monitoring device[1] when he resumed probation.Â  In November 2008, a probation revocation hearing\r\n  was held at which the trial court continued Duncan on probation, finding because\r\n  Duncan was indigent, he did not willfully violate the conditions of his probation\r\n  by failing to pay his fine.Â  The trial court also imposed the standard sex\r\n  offender conditions to Duncan's probation and terminated Duncan's electronic\r\n  monitoring.Â  \r\nDuncan\r\n  appeals the trial court's decision to add the sex offender conditions to the conditions\r\n  of his probation.Â  Duncan's counsel filed a brief pursuant to Anders v.\r\n    California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), stating he reviewed the record and\r\n  concluded this appeal lacked merit and asking to be relieved as counsel.Â  After a thorough review of the record and counsel's\r\n  brief pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and State\r\n    v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), we dismiss[2] the Anders appeal and grant counsel's petition to be relieved. \r\nThe\r\n  State cross-appeals, arguing the trial court erred in terminating Duncan's\r\n  electronic monitoring.Â  We agree. \r\nA\r\n  person convicted of first-degree CSC with a minor must be monitored with an\r\n  active electronic monitoring device by the Department of Probation, Parole and\r\n  Pardon Services (the Department) upon release from incarceration, confinement,\r\n  commitment, institutionalization, or when placed under the supervision of the\r\n  Department.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-540(A) (Supp. 2009).Â Â  Additionally, a person\r\n  convicted of first-degree CSC with a minor &quot;who violates a [CSP] must be ordered by the court or agency with jurisdiction to be monitored by [the\r\n  Department] with an active electronic monitoring device.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 23-3-540(C) (Supp. 2009) (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-540(E)\r\n  (Supp. 2009) (noting electronic monitoring is required for a person with a\r\n  conviction for first-degree CSC with a minor who\r\n  violates any provision of the electronic monitoring statute).Â  Further,\r\n  section 23-3-540(H) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) requires the person\r\n  to be monitored &quot;for the duration of the time the person is required to\r\n  remain on the sex offender registry [(the Registry)] Â Â . . . unless the person\r\n  is committed to the custody of the State.&quot;Â  An offender is required to register\r\n  for the Registry biannually for life.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-460(A) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  An offender may petition for termination of electronic monitoring after\r\n  ten years from the date the electronic monitoring begins, and if denied, the\r\n  offender may refile a petition for removal every five years from the date the\r\n  court denies the petition or refuses to grant the order.Â Â  Â§ 23-3-540(H).\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court erred in terminating Duncan's electronic monitoring.Â \r\n  Although section 23-3-540 was enacted after Duncan's conviction, Duncan was\r\n  subject to electronic monitoring because he violated the terms of his CSP for\r\n  his first-degree CSC with a minor conviction after the enactment of the statute.Â  See Â§ 23-3-540(C). Â Â Here, Duncan's CSP was revoked in July 2008.Â \r\n  Furthermore, the trial court did not have the discretion to terminate Duncan's\r\n  electronic monitoring because electronic monitoring is required &quot;for the\r\n  duration of the time the person . . . remain[s] on the [Registry].&quot;Â  See Â§ 23-3-540(H). Accordingly, the trial court erred in terminating Duncan's\r\n  electronic monitoring, and we remand the case to the trial court to reinstate\r\n  the initial trial court's order requiring electronic monitoring. \r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\nDISMISSED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  PIEPER, and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Electronic monitoring is often referred to as global\r\n  positioning system (GPS) monitoring.Â  \r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4785","title":"State v.

Â First, he claims the judge committed error in\r\n  admitting evidence of a prior incident of child abuse against Ebony.Â  He also\r\n  contends the judge erred in allowing the State to proceed under the aiding and\r\n  abetting section of the homicide by child abuse statute.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\nEbony\r\n  Kiandra Smith died on February 14, 2004, from a combination of an overdose of\r\n  four times the adult therapeutic level of pseudoephedrine[1] and blunt force trauma to her chest.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her death culminated a four\r\n  month saga of abuse and neglect for Ebony.&nbsp; Charlene Dandridge, Ebony's\r\n  mother and Wesley Smith's live-in girlfriend, left Ebony at home with Smith\r\n  that day while she went to work.&nbsp; Other than Dandridge's brief return home\r\n  for lunch, the child was in Smith's sole custody the entire day.&nbsp; Smith\r\n  was indicted for homicide by child abuse as a principal under section\r\n  16-3-85(A)(1) of the South Carolina Code (2003).\r\nAt\r\n  trial, the State proved the history of Ebony's abuse.Â  The State established through\r\n  medical witnesses that Ebony had seventeen broken ribs at the time of her\r\n  death.Â  The pathologist testified that the rib fractures were &quot;really\r\n  classic for squeezing type of injury&quot; caused by child abuse.Â  Through a\r\n  microscopic examination of each individual rib fracture, the pathologist\r\n  determined by the extent of healing that the fractures had occurred between ten\r\n  days and three weeks before Ebony's death.[2]Â \r\n  The pathologist also found evidence of hemorrhaging over some of the fractures\r\n  indicating new injuries at the site of the fractures that occurred\r\n  approximately 24 hours before Ebony's death.Â  The doctor testified that the\r\n  older fractures resulted from squeezing, but the more recent injuries could\r\n  have resulted from squeezing or striking.Â  The pathologist testified:\r\n  &quot;It's inflicted trauma.Â  . . .Â  [T]here's no way that this occurred\r\n  accidentally or naturally, no way whatsoever.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State proved that Smith was Ebony's primary caretaker and that he was around\r\n  her on a constant basis.Â  From January 15 until the day of her death, the only adults\r\n  with access to Ebony were Smith, Dandridge, and Smith's mother and father who\r\n  saw Ebony on the weekends.Â  On the day of her death, the only people who saw Ebony\r\n  were Smith, Dandridge, and Dandridge's other two young children.Â  \r\nImportantly,\r\n  Smith did not object to the introduction of any of the evidence described so\r\n  far, nor does he challenge the admission of that evidence on appeal.Â  He did\r\n  object, however, to the admission of evidence of a broken femur Ebony suffered\r\n  in November, 2003.Â  Dandridge came home from work one day in November to find\r\n  that Ebony's leg was immobile.Â  Smith, who had sole custody of Ebony that day,\r\n  explained to Dandridge that he was napping with Ebony on his chest when he\r\n  heard someone knock on the door.Â  Smith explained the injury by telling\r\n  Dandridge that, as he reacted to the knock, Ebony fell backwards with her leg\r\n  still in Smith's hand.Â  Smith and Dandridge apparently knew the leg was broken\r\n  because Smith concocted a homemade splint and put it on Ebony's leg.Â  They did\r\n  not initially take Ebony to the doctor because Dandridge was afraid Ebony would\r\n  be taken away from her.Â  On December 9, they finally took Ebony to the doctor.Â \r\n  The pediatrician who examined Ebony that day testified that her &quot;thigh was\r\n  very swollen and painful&quot; and explained that Ebony &quot;started to cry\r\n  every time I touched her leg.&quot;Â  The pediatrician asked Smith how the\r\n  injury occurred. Â At first, Smith told the doctor he &quot;had no idea,&quot;\r\n  but he later gave her the same story he told Dandridge, admitting he was\r\n  holding Ebony when the injury happened.\r\nThe\r\n  doctor ordered X-rays which demonstrated a &quot;spiral fracture&quot; of\r\n  Ebony's femur with callus showing the bone had been healing for at least two\r\n  weeks.Â  The radiologist who examined the X-rays on December 9 testified a\r\n  spiral fracture is &quot;a twisting type injury that causes the bone to\r\n  fracture in a spiral rather than just a crack&quot; and that a spiral fracture\r\n  is typically not accidental.Â  During the autopsy, the pathologist was able to\r\n  examine the fractured femur in greater detail.Â  She described the spiral\r\n  fracture as one caused by &quot;a twisting, yanking motion, and that's what we\r\n  see more with abusive fractures.&quot;Â  While showing the X-ray to the jury,\r\n  she described the break of Ebony's femur as &quot;a complete break.Â  It's going\r\n  from the inner part of the thigh down towards the outer part.&quot;Â  She\r\n  described the fracture as &quot;abusive in that this is an inflicted fracture.Â \r\n  This is not an accidental fracture.&quot;Â  Finally, the pathologist testified\r\n  that Smith's story about how the injury occurred is &quot;absolutely not&quot;\r\n  consistent with the medical evidence she had just described.Â  The trial judge\r\n  admitted the evidence over Smith's objection.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the close of all the evidence, the State asked the trial judge to charge the\r\n  jury that it could find Smith guilty under both subsections of the homicide by\r\n  child abuse statute.Â  The indictment alleged he was guilty as a principal under\r\n  subsection 16-3-85(A)(1).Â  The trial judge also allowed the State to proceed\r\n  under subsection 16-3-85(A)(2), the aiding and abetting subsection of the\r\n  statute.Â  The jury found Smith guilty of aiding and abetting homicide by child\r\n  abuse, and the judge imposed the maximum penalty of twenty years.\r\nII. Other Crimes, Wrongs, or\r\n  Acts\r\nThe rule of evidence\r\n  governing the admissibility of other crimes, wrongs or acts committed by a\r\n  defendant has long been a part of our jurisprudence.Â  In 1923, in the often cited\r\n  case of State v. Lyle our supreme court described it as &quot;the familiar and salutary general rule, universally recognized\r\n  and firmly established in all English-speaking countries . . . .&quot;Â  125\r\n  S.C. 406, 415-16, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923).Â  The rule\r\n  is based on the danger that the jury will reach a guilty verdict because\r\n  of the defendant's bad character and not based on the evidence of the crime for\r\n  which he is currently on trial. Â This danger was described in Lyle:\r\n\r\n  Proof that a defendant has been guilty of another crime\r\n    equally heinous prompts to a ready acceptance of and belief in the\r\n    prosecution's theory that he is guilty of the crime charged. Â Its effect is to\r\n    predispose the mind of the juror to believe the prisoner guilty, and thus\r\n    effectually to strip him of the presumption of innocence.Â  It &quot;compels the\r\n    defendant to meet charges of which the indictment gives him no information,\r\n    confuses him in his defense, raises a variety of issues, and thus diverts the\r\n    attention of the jury from the one immediately before it.&quot;Â  \r\n\r\n125 S.C. at 416, 118 S.E. at\r\n  807 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  rule is often explained in terms of &quot;propensity,&quot; in that the rule prevents\r\n  a defendant from being found guilty simply because of his propensity to commit\r\n  similar crimes.Â  &quot;The State may not show defendant's prior trouble with\r\n  the law, specific criminal acts, or ill name among his neighbors, even though\r\n  such facts might logically be persuasive that he is by propensity a probable\r\n  perpetrator of the crime.&quot;Â  Michelson v. United States, 335 U.S.\r\n  469, 475 (1948).Â  &quot;It is in criminal cases that the law must be the most\r\n  sternly on guard against allowing the doing of an act to be proved by a\r\n  propensity to do it.&quot; Â James F.\r\n  Dreher, A Guide to Evidence Law in South Carolina 35 (South Carolina Bar\r\n  1967).Â  &quot;[E]vidence of\r\n  other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible for purposes of proving that\r\n  the defendant possesses a criminal character or has a propensity to commit the\r\n  charged crime.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Fletcher, 379 S.C. 17, 26, 664 S.E.2d\r\n  480, 484 (2008) (Toal, C.J., dissenting).\r\nWhen\r\n  South Carolina adopted the Rules of Evidence in 1995, the law of admissibility\r\n  of evidence of other crimes, wrongs and acts was incorporated into Rule\r\n  404(b).Â  The first sentence of Rule 404(b) focuses the court's inquiry on the\r\n  purpose for which the evidence is offered.Â  &quot;Evidence of other crimes,\r\n  wrongs, or acts is not admissible to\r\n  prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity\r\n  therewith.&quot; Â Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  When\r\n  other acts of the defendant are offered to prove his character in order to show\r\n  that he acted in conformity with his character, the evidence is offered for the\r\n  prohibited purpose of showing a propensity to commit the crime, and is therefore\r\n  not admissible.Â  See Fletcher, 379 S.C. at 26, 664 S.E.2d at 484 (explaining &quot;why certain prior bad act testimony is inadmissible, i.e.,\r\n  . . .&quot; when &quot;the only function of\r\n  [the] testimony . . . was to demonstrate . . . bad character&quot; which was\r\n  &quot;used by the jury to infer that the defendant did in fact commit the\r\n  crime&quot;).[3]Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  Rule 404(b) recognizes exceptions to the\r\n  bar against using the evidence to prove propensity. Â When the evidence is\r\n  offered for one of the five purposes listed in the second sentence of Rule\r\n  404(b), evidence of other crimes, wrongs or acts &quot;may . . . be admissible.&quot;Â \r\n  The five listed purposes are &quot;to show motive, identity, the existence of a\r\n  common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.&quot; Â Rule\r\n  404(b), SCRE. Â \r\nIn\r\n  order to introduce evidence of some other act of the defendant under one of\r\n  these exceptions, the State must lay the proper foundation.Â  First, unless the\r\n  act is the subject of a criminal conviction, the State must prove by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that the defendant committed the act. Â Fletcher, 379\r\n  S.C. at 23, 664 S.E.2d at 483.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  second element of the foundation requires the State to articulate the logical\r\n  connection between the other act and at least one of the five purposes listed as\r\n  exceptions in the rule.Â  State v. Pagan,\r\n  369 S.C. 201, 211, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006).Â  In order to meet this element,\r\n  the State must explain how evidence of the other act will assist the judge or\r\n  the jury in understanding some material issue in the case related to one or\r\n  more of the Rule 404(b) exceptions.Â  When the State adequately explains how the\r\n  evidence of the other act logically connects to an issue in the case, it\r\n  demonstrates how the judge or jury can use the evidence without using it for\r\n  the prohibited purpose of inferring guilt from the defendant's propensity to\r\n  commit the crime.Â  See State v. Wiles, 383 S.C. 151, 158, 679\r\n  S.E.2d 172, 176 (2009) (&quot;Stated differently, evidence which is logically\r\n  relevant to establish a material element of the offense charged is not to be\r\n  excluded merely because it incidentally reveals the accused's guilt of another\r\n  crime.&quot; (internal citations omitted)).Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the trial judge finds the State has met the first two elements, the judge must\r\n  consider Rule 403, SCRE.Â  State v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 404, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  434, 441 (2009).Â  Under Rule 403, the trial judge must determine whether the\r\n  logical connection articulated by the State is sufficiently strong that the\r\n  probative value found in the connection is not substantially outweighed by the\r\n  tendency of the evidence to show propensity, or by some other form of unfair\r\n  prejudice.Â  If the trial judge determines not to exclude the evidence under this\r\n  Rule 403 analysis, then the State may admit it. \r\nTurning\r\n  to the facts of this case, we are satisfied the judge acted within his\r\n  discretion in ruling the evidence was clear and convincing that Smith committed\r\n  child abuse in connection with Ebony's broken leg.Â  While the record does not\r\n  reflect the exact manner in which the injury occurred, the State's proof that\r\n  Smith was guilty of the abuse that caused it is overwhelming.Â  Smith was the\r\n  only person with Ebony when the injury occurred.Â  Smith admitted to Dandridge\r\n  and to the pediatrician that the injury occurred while he held the child in his\r\n  hands.Â  Three treating physicians along with the pathologist testified that\r\n  Ebony's spiral fracture was the result of child abuse, not accident.Â  Moreover,\r\n  the State presented evidence that Smith lied to Dandridge, the doctors, and investigators\r\n  from the Department of Social Services about how the child's injury occurred in\r\n  order to conceal his involvement in the injury.Â  There is ample evidence to\r\n  support the judge's ruling.\r\nWe\r\n  review a circuit court's determination that evidence offered pursuant to Rule 404(b)\r\n  is clear and convincing under the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard.Â  State\r\n    v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001) (reversing the court\r\n  of appeals for not applying the any evidence standard in reviewing a circuit\r\n  court's determination that Rule 404(b) evidence was clear and convincing).Â  See\r\n    also State v. Wallace, 384 S.C. 428, 432 n.2, 683 S.E.2d 275, 277\r\n  n.2 (2009) (&quot;Bad act evidence that is not subject to a conviction must be\r\n  shown by clear and convincing evidence and is reviewed under an 'any evidence'\r\n  standard on appeal.&quot; (citing Wilson, 345 S.C. at 5-6, 545 S.E.2d at\r\n  829)).Â  Because there is evidence to support the judge's ruling that the\r\n  evidence was clear and convincing, we must affirm the trial court's ruling that\r\n  the State satisfied the first element.[4]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State also satisfied the second element of the foundation by explaining how the\r\n  evidence logically related to two of the exceptions listed under Rule 404(b):\r\n  motive and absence of mistake.Â  See State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. 100,\r\n  103, 504 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1998) (&quot;The acid test of admissibility is the\r\n  logical relevancy of the other crimes.Â  The trial judge must clearly perceive\r\n  the connection between the other crimes and the crimes charged.&quot;).Â  First,\r\n  the State points to the indisputable facts that the untreated broken leg was\r\n  painful and that the pain would have made Ebony cry.Â  There is ample medical\r\n  testimony in the record to support this point.Â  Second, the State presented\r\n  evidence that Smith was not able to handle being around Ebony when she was\r\n  crying.Â  Third, the State presented evidence that Smith gave Ebony medicine on\r\n  the day of her death, despite the fact that she had no medical condition that\r\n  warranted medication.Â  Next, the State presented expert testimony that\r\n  pseudoephedrine is often improperly used to &quot;chemically restrain&quot;\r\n  children, meaning, as the State's forensic toxicologist and drug chemist\r\n  testified, to &quot;subdue the child so that the caregiver would not have to\r\n  care for the child or tend to the child, or to quiet the child in some\r\n  manner.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State summarizes its &quot;logical connection&quot; argument in its brief:\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    child would have been crying continually and extensively because of her\r\n    injuries, beginning at the time of the first known injury â€“ the injury to the\r\n    femur â€“ and progressing with the subsequent injuries.Â  In light of the testimony\r\n    that Appellant could not &quot;handle&quot; the victim's crying, the femur\r\n    injury was highly relevant to show Appellant's motive for . . . attempting to\r\n    &quot;chemically restrain&quot; the child with medicine.Â  The femur evidence\r\n    was thus critical to show that the overdose was not purely a mistake or\r\n    accident.Â  \r\n\r\nThis is precisely what our\r\n  courts mean when requiring a &quot;logical connection.&quot; Â The State has\r\n  explained how the evidence can be used by the jury to determine motive and\r\n  absence of mistake without relying on propensity.Â  The State has proven the\r\n  second element of the foundation.\r\nFinally,\r\n  we believe the trial judge's ruling not to exclude the evidence under Rule 403\r\n  was within his discretion.Â  See State v. Holland, 385 S.C. 159,\r\n  171-72, 682 S.E.2d 898, 904 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating this court gives\r\n  &quot;great deference to the trial court's judgment&quot; under Rule 403 and\r\n  that the &quot;trial court's determination should be reversed only in\r\n  exceptional circumstances&quot;).Â  The trial judge acknowledged the unfair\r\n  prejudice of the evidence, calling it &quot;highly prejudicial,\r\n  obviously.&quot;Â  He concluded, however, that &quot;the probative value . . .\r\n  clearly outweighs the prejudicial effect.&quot;Â  Smith made no Rule 403 argument\r\n  to the trial judge other than the conclusory statement: &quot;I still think we\r\n  have the filter of the 403, the prejudicial and probative value.&quot;Â  Smith's\r\n  argument on appeal is equally conclusory.Â  Given the State's articulation of the\r\n  logical relevance of the femur injury, and thus its probative value, the judge\r\n  acted within his discretion in concluding the unfair prejudice in admitting the\r\n  evidence did not substantially outweigh the probative value.Â  \r\nSmith\r\n  argues that because the trial court relied on this court's opinion in State\r\n    v. Fletcher, 363 S.C. 221, 609 S.E.2d 572 (Ct. App. 2005), which was subsequently\r\n  reversed by the supreme court, 379 S.C. 17, 664 S.E.2d 480 (2008), Smith's\r\n  conviction must also be reversed.Â  We disagree.Â  The supreme court's decision\r\n  in Fletcher was based on the State's failure to prove the prior acts by\r\n  clear and convincing evidence, and therefore does not control the outcome of\r\n  this appeal.Â  379 S.C. at 25, 664 S.E.2d at 483-84 (&quot;[T]here\r\n  is simply no evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence that Fletcher\r\n  was the perpetrator of the prior bad acts . . . .&quot;).\r\nOne point warrants further discussion.Â  The trial\r\n  judge made several comments as to the reasons he was admitting the evidence of\r\n  Ebony's broken femur which do not fit into the analysis set out above.Â  For\r\n  example, he stated &quot;I'm admitting it to show clearly that someone\r\n  committed child abuse on this child.Â  The jury can determine whether or not\r\n  this defendant did it.&quot;Â  To the extent this and other comments by the\r\n  trial judge have been argued to indicate an improper Rule 404(b) or Rule 403\r\n  analysis, it was Smith's duty to raise those arguments before the trial judge.Â \r\n  Because the arguments were never presented to the trial judge, they are not\r\n  preserved for our review.Â  See State v.\r\n    Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 133-34, 546 S.E.2d\r\n  202, 205 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding evidentiary argument was not preserved for\r\n  review because the issue was never raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge).\r\nIII. Aiding and Abetting under\r\n  Section 16-3-85(A)(2)\r\nSmith\r\n  contends that the trial judge erred in allowing the State to proceed on aiding\r\n  and abetting homicide by child abuse under subsection 16-3-85(A)(2) ofÂ  the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2003).Â  Smith was indicted as a principal under subsection\r\n  16-3-85(A)(1), not under subsection 16-3-85(A)(2).Â  He claims he did not have\r\n  notice of, and the evidence was not sufficient to support, the aiding and\r\n  abetting charge.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder\r\n  subsection 16-3-85(A)(2), a defendant is guilty of homicide by child abuse if\r\n  he &quot;knowingly aids and abets another person to commit child abuse or\r\n  neglect, and the child abuse or neglect results in the death of a child under\r\n  the age of eleven.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;It is well-settled that a defendant\r\n  may be convicted on a theory of accomplice liability pursuant to an indictment\r\n  charging him only with the principal offense.&quot;Â  State v. Dickman,\r\n  341 S.C. 293, 295, 534 S.E.2d 268, 269 (2000) (citing State v. Leonard,\r\n  292 S.C. 133, 136, 355 S.E.2d 270, 272 (1987)).Â  Thus, the indictment charging\r\n  Smith with homicide by child abuse as a principal was effective to put him on\r\n  notice that the State may request to proceed on aiding and abetting homicide by\r\n  child abuse as well.[5]\r\nWe\r\n  find the State presented sufficient evidence to support various theories of\r\n  Smith's guilt under the aiding and abetting section.Â  Even if the jury found\r\n  the State failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith inflicted the fatal\r\n  chest injuries, or personally administered the pseudoephedrine, they could\r\n  nevertheless find him guilty of aiding and abetting if they found the State\r\n  proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Smith knew about the injuries or about\r\n  the pseudoephedrine but failed to seek medical care for her.Â  \r\nIV. Remaining Issues on Appeal\r\nSmith\r\n  raises two other issues related to the trial judge's exclusion of evidence.Â \r\n  Smith sought to cross-examine Dandridge with evidence that she could also have\r\n  been charged with homicide by child abuse as a principal, in which case she\r\n  would have faced life in prison rather than thirty years.[6]Â \r\n  Though the trial judge initially sustained the State's objection to the\r\n  evidence, he later changed his mind and correctly allowed Smith to bring\r\n  Dandridge back to the stand.Â  See State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674,\r\n  678-89, 636 S.E.2d 649, 651 (Ct. App. 2006) (explaining that possible sentences\r\n  co-defendant witnesses face are admissible as evidence of bias).Â  However, Smith\r\n  never offered the evidence.Â  We find no error.Â  Smith also claims the judge\r\n  erred in excluding the testimony of a psychiatrist Smith said would testify\r\n  Smith has a very low I.Q.Â  The psychiatrist was not present when the request\r\n  was made, and Smith never offered the testimony into the record.Â  The issue is\r\n  not preserved for review.Â  See State v. Santiago, 370 S.C. 153,\r\n  163, 634 S.E.2d 23, 29 (Ct. App. 2006) (explaining that appellate court will\r\n  not consider alleged error unless the record shows what the testimony would\r\n  have been).\r\nV. Conclusion\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial judge acted within his discretion in admitting evidence of Ebony's\r\n  broken femur and did not err in allowing the State to proceed under the aiding\r\n  and abetting section of the homicide by child abuse statute.Â  Regarding the\r\n  other issues, Smith's claim that the trial judge erred in excluding evidence of\r\n  bias fails because the judge did not exclude the evidence.Â  Smith's argument\r\n  that the judge erred in excluding evidence of his borderline intelligence is\r\n  not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nGEATHERS,\r\n  J. (dissenting):Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  I am deeply troubled by the abuse visited upon this infant victim\r\n  that resulted in her untimely death.Â  I believe the trial court erred, however,\r\n  in allowing the introduction of improper propensity evidence.Â  Based on our\r\n  supreme court's reasoning in State v. Fletcher, 379 S.C. 17, 664 S.E.2d\r\n  480 (2008), I would hold the admission of evidence of the victim's fractured\r\n  femur as a prior bad act amounts to reversible error.Â  In the absence of this\r\n  evidence, I would also hold the trial court should not have charged the jury\r\n  with aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.[7]Â  \r\nA. Prior Bad Act\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Smith argues the trial court erred in admitting evidence of a prior\r\n  injury (a fractured femur) to the victim where the evidence was not clear and\r\n  convincing and its probative value was substantially outweighed by the danger\r\n  of unfair prejudice.Â  The majority finds &quot;overwhelming&quot; evidence Smith\r\n  inflicted the victim's broken leg by committing an intentional act of child\r\n  abuse.Â  I disagree.Â  \r\nEvidence of other\r\n  crimes or bad acts is not admissible to show criminal propensity to commit the\r\n  crime charged or to demonstrate the bad character of the accused.Â  Rule 404(b),\r\n  SCRE; State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 6-7, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718-19 (1998); State\r\n    v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 415-16, 118 S.E. 803, 807 (1923).Â  However, such\r\n  evidence may be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common\r\n  scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.Â  Rule 404(b),\r\n  SCRE.Â  &quot;To be admissible, the bad act must logically relate to the crime\r\n  with which the defendant has been charged.&quot;Â  Fletcher, 379 S.C. at\r\n  23, 664 S.E.2d at 483.Â  &quot;If the defendant was not convicted of the prior\r\n  crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  &quot;Even if the prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls\r\n  within an exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the\r\n  defendant.&quot; Â Id. (citing Rule 403, SCRE).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  admission of this prior bad act conflicts with our supreme court's holding in Fletcher.Â \r\n  Specifically, evidence of the victim's broken femur was inadmissible because\r\n  (1) there was no evidence, let alone clear and convincing evidence, that Smith\r\n  inflicted the victim's broken femur by committing an intentional act of child\r\n  abuse; (2) there was no logical connection between the broken femur and the\r\n  victim's resulting death; and, (3) the probative value of the victim's broken\r\n  femur was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice pursuant\r\n  to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the Fletcher trial, a neighbor testified that approximately two weeks\r\n  prior to the victim's death, he visited Fletcher's home, heard crying, and\r\n  located the victim sitting alone in the attic drenched in sweat while Fletcher\r\n  and the victim's mother were home.Â  Id. at 21, 664 S.E.2d at 482.Â  The\r\n  same neighbor testified that approximately one month prior to the victim's\r\n  death, he came to Fletcher's house and found the\r\n  victim handcuffed by his feet to the bed on which Fletcher and the victim's\r\n  mother slept.Â  Id. at 22, 664 S.E.2d at 482.Â  Â Â Â \r\nThe Fletcher court held that it was improper to admit the neighbor's testimony regarding\r\n  these prior bad acts where there was no evidence, let alone clear and\r\n  convincing evidence, as to which caretaker perpetrated the prior bad acts. Â Id. at 25, 664 S.E.2d at 483-84.Â  Our supreme\r\n  court defined clear and convincing evidence as follows:\r\n\r\n  Clear and convincing evidence is that degree of proof\r\n    which will produce in the mind of the trier of facts a firm belief as to the\r\n    allegations sought to be established.Â  Such proof is intermediate, more than a\r\n    mere preponderance but less than is required for proof beyond a reasonable\r\n    doubt; it does not mean clear and unequivocal.\r\n\r\nId. at 24, 664 S.E.2d at 483.Â  The Fletcher court\r\n  concluded that although there was evidence the victim had been abused, there\r\n  was &quot;not clear and convincing evidence in the record that Fletcher\r\n    committed the prior bad acts &nbsp;. . . .&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the instant case, the record does not contain any evidence that Smith\r\n  intentionally inflicted the victim's broken femur.Â  Dr. Cooper-Merchant, an\r\n  attending physician, testified Smith informed him that he had no idea how the\r\n  femur injury happened.Â  Dr. Cooper-Merchant also testified Smith later stated\r\n  the victim may have sustained the broken femur when she accidentally fell from\r\n  his lap as Smith stood up from his chair one day upon hearing the doorbell\r\n  ring.[8]Â \r\n  Dr. Cooper-Merchant further testified Charlene Dandridge[9] was afraid to take the victim to the hospital after the femur injury because\r\n  &quot;they might consider her a bad mother.&quot;Â  Another attending physician,\r\n  Dr. Crane, testified the femur fracture could have been anywhere between two\r\n  and four weeks old when he took the victim's x-ray on December 9, 2003, and it was\r\n  impossible to know exactly when or how the fracture occurred.Â  Dr. Crane noted\r\n  approximately 30% of spiral fractures are accidental, and not abusive.Â  Dr.\r\n  Rahter, a third attending physician, testified it was possible Smith was not\r\n  even present when the spiral fracture occurred.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the motion in limine to exclude evidence of the victim's broken\r\n  femur, the trial court noted &quot;either he or his wife or both of them had to\r\n  do it.&quot;Â  It appears from the record that the trial court focused on clear\r\n  and convincing evidence of a pattern of abuse inflicted upon the victim by any\r\n  perpetrator, versus clear and convincing evidence of abuse inflicted by Smith.Â \r\n  I believe this was error.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  allegation of an accident does not equate to the admission of an intentional\r\n  act of child abuse for purposes of demonstrating evidence of a prior bad act.Â  See State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 218-19, 641 S.E.2d 873, 879 (2007)\r\n  (reversing a death penalty conviction when the trial court admitted evidence of\r\n  the victim's spiral leg fracture at age ten-weeks despite the fact that the\r\n  prior injury was, by all accounts, accidental and therefore not relevant to\r\n  show the nature of defendant's relationship with the victim).Â  This is\r\n  particularly true where, as is the case here, Smith did not have exclusive\r\n  custody and control over the victim.Â  See State v. Cutro, 332\r\n  S.C. 100, 105-06, 504 S.E.2d 324, 326-27 (1998) (holding admission of prior bad\r\n  acts of child abuse was reversible error when the defendant did not have\r\n  exclusive control over the children during the period when the prior bad acts\r\n  occurred).Â  Indeed, DSS was unable to determine who caused the victim's broken\r\n  femur after investigating the incident, and returned the victim to her\r\n  parents.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  evidence of the victim's broken femur was inadmissible as a prior bad act\r\n  because the State failed to present any evidence that Smith intentionally\r\n  inflicted the injury.Â  Compare State v. Pierce, 326 S.C. 176,\r\n  178-79, 485 S.E.2d 913, 914 (1997) (holding hospital employees' testimony\r\n  regarding victim's previous injuries was inadmissible under the common scheme\r\n  or plan exception because there was no clear and convincing evidence defendant\r\n  inflicted the injuries), with State v. Martucci, 380 S.C. 232,\r\n  241-42, 251-56, 669 S.E.2d 598, 603, 608-11 (Ct. App. 2008) (permitting\r\n  evidence of prior bad acts of child abuse when there was eyewitness testimony\r\n  that the defendant slapped victim, taped victim's mouth shut, and dunked\r\n  victim's head in a bathtub until he choked to stop victim from crying).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority next contends there was a &quot;logical connection&quot; between the\r\n  broken femur and one of the exceptions listed in Rule 404(b), specifically,\r\n  evidence of motive or absence of mistake.Â  However, the logical connection\r\n  required is between the prior bad act and the crime with which the defendant\r\n  has been charged.Â  See Fletcher,\r\n  379 S.C. at 23, 664 S.E.2d at 483; State\r\n    v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 211, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 262, 267&nbsp;(2006) (&quot;To be admissible, the bad act must logically\r\n  relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.&quot;).\r\nNotably,\r\n  the femur injury occurred three months before the victim's death.Â  At the\r\n  well-baby visit on February 12, 2004, two days before the victim's death, the\r\n  attending physician did not note anything wrong with the victim.Â  These facts\r\n  are inconsistent with the majority's assertion that Smith &quot;chemically\r\n  restrained&quot; the victim to keep her from crying because her leg was\r\n  hurting.Â  Moreover, the majority overlooks the fact that both Smith and\r\n  Dandridge admitted to administering medication to the victim in the days prior\r\n  to her death, and both parents were primary caregivers.[10]Â \r\n  Finally, the victim's cause of death was an overdose of pseudoephedrine\r\n  accompanied by blunt force trauma to her chest.Â  In the absence of any evidence\r\n  Smith intentionally inflicted the broken femur, this evidence was not in any\r\n  way causally related or logically connected to the victim's death and was not\r\n  necessary to prove res gestae.Â  See Fletcher, 379\r\n  S.C. at 25 n.3, 664 S.E.2d at 484 n.3.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority holds the broken femur was admissible to show evidence of motive or\r\n  absence of mistake.Â  However, Smith never claimed the victim's death was a\r\n  mistake.Â  Smith's only defense during trial was that Dandridge committed the\r\n  acts which resulted in the victim's death.Â  The broken femur was not relevant\r\n  to show Smith's motive to commit child abuse because there was no evidence that\r\n  Smith intentionally or willfully inflicted the broken femur.Â  See Northcutt, 372 S.C. at 218-19,\r\n  641 S.E.2d at 879.Â  The only purpose for\r\n  admitting this evidence was to demonstrate Smith's propensity to commit the\r\n  acts which resulted in the victim's death in the absence of any direct evidence\r\n  of abuse.Â  This purpose is specifically prohibited by Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  \r\nLastly,\r\n  evidence of the victim's broken femur was inadmissible pursuant to Rule 403,\r\n  SCRE.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE (stating that evidence may be excluded\r\n  if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice).Â  This evidence was highly\r\n  prejudicial and not harmless.Â  See Fletcher 379 S.C. at 484, 664\r\n  S.E.2d at 26 (noting the admission of prior bad act evidence when the offender\r\n  was unsubstantiated was not harmless error because the identity of the\r\n  perpetrator was the essential issue at trial); see also Northcutt,\r\n  372 S.C. at 218-19, 641 S.E.2d at 879 (reversing a death penalty conviction due\r\n  to unfair prejudice pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE, when the trial court admitted\r\n  evidence of the victim's spiral leg fracture at age ten-weeks despite the fact\r\n  that the prior injury was, by all accounts, an accident).Â  \r\nSmith's\r\n  sole defense during trial was that Dandridge committed the acts which resulted\r\n  in the victim's death.Â  In addition, at the time the trial court admitted the\r\n  evidence of the victim's broken femur, Smith was only being tried for homicide\r\n  by child abuse, not aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.Â  The admission\r\n  of this evidence was highly prejudicial to Smith as Dandridge was not on trial,\r\n  and DSS was unable to determine who caused the spiral fracture after\r\n  investigating the incident.Â  Therefore, I would reverse.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;Aiding and Abetting Jury\r\n  Charge\r\nSmith\r\n  was indicted for homicide by child abuse under section 16-3-85(A)(1) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code (2003).Â  That section provides that a person is guilty of\r\n  homicide by child abuse if the person &quot;causes the death of a child under\r\n  the age of eleven while committing child abuse or neglect, and the death occurs\r\n  under circumstances manifesting an extreme indifference to human life.&quot;Â \r\n  At the end of trial, the State requested and the trial court decided to charge\r\n  the jury on section 16-3-85(A)(2) as well, which provides that a person is\r\n  guilty of homicide by child abuse if the person &quot;knowingly aids or abets\r\n  another person to commit child abuse or neglect, and the child abuse or neglect\r\n  results in the death of a child under the age of eleven.&quot;Â  Smith was\r\n  acquitted of the charge for which he was indicted, but the jury found Smith\r\n  guilty of aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.Â  On appeal, Smith argues\r\n  it was error for the trial court to charge the jury on section 16-3-85(A)(2).Â \r\n  I agree.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  appellate court will not reverse the trial court's decision regarding jury charges absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â Â State v. Williams, 367 S.C. 192, 195, 624 S.E.2d 443, 445\r\n  (Ct. App. 2005) (citation and quotation marks omitted).Â  &quot;It is\r\n  well-settled the law to be charged is determined from the evidence presented at\r\n  trial, and if any evidence exists to support a charge, it should be\r\n  given.&quot; State\r\n    v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nSetting aside\r\n  evidence of the broken femur and any evidence collateral to that injury, there\r\n  was not any evidence presented on which to charge the jury with aiding and\r\n  abetting homicide by child abuse.Â  Specifically, there was no evidence that\r\n  Smith knowingly aided and abetted Dandridge or any other person to\r\n  commit homicide by child abuse.Â  See section 16-3-85(A)(2).\r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, I would hold evidence of the victim's broken femur should have been\r\n  excluded under Rule 404(b), SCRE, and Rule 403, SCRE, as it may have been used\r\n  by the jury as propensity evidence to infer that Smith aided and abetted the\r\n  acts that ultimately resulted in the victim's death, even though it acquitted\r\n  him of homicide by child abuse.Â  Because the prior\r\n  bad act should not have been admitted, there was no evidence to charge the jury\r\n  with aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse.Â  Accordingly, I would reverse\r\n  on both grounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Pseudoephedrine is a decongestant found in\r\n  over-the-counter products such as Sudafed.Â  It is not permitted to be given to\r\n  children under the age of two.Â  \r\n[2] A radiologist testified that X-rays taken on January\r\n  15 showed no rib fractures.Â  \r\n[3] Fletcher was actually decided on the basis of\r\n  the State's failure to prove the other acts by clear and convincing evidence.Â \r\n  379 S.C. at 25 n.2, 664 S.E.2d at 484 n.2 (&quot;We\r\n  need not decide whether these acts, if proven by clear and convincing evidence,\r\n  would otherwise be admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE.&quot;).Â  The court nevertheless explained the basis for the rule\r\n  excluding propensity evidence.\r\n[4] Contrary to the dissent's assertion, this case is not\r\n  controlled by Fletcher.Â  The Fletcher majority states &quot;there is simply no evidence . . . that Fletcher was the\r\n  perpetrator of the prior bad acts against Jaquan.&quot;Â  379 S.C. at 25,\r\n  664 S.E.2d at 483-84.Â  Because there is evidence in this case to support the\r\n  trial judge's ruling, Fletcher is distinguishable.Â Â  \r\n[5] We recognize that this situation is different from Dickman in that here the statute contains a separate aiding and abetting subsection.Â \r\n  However, the subsection does not add any elements necessary for conviction, and\r\n  therefore is governed by the same general aiding and abetting principles\r\n  considered in Dickman.\r\n[6] The record reveals that Dandridge faced thirty years,\r\n  but does not include the specific charges she faced.Â  Had she been charged with\r\n  homicide by child abuse as a principal, she would have faced a minimum of\r\n  twenty years and a maximum of life in prison.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(C)(1)\r\n  (2003).\r\n[7] At the time the evidence of the broken femur was\r\n  admitted, Smith was only being tried for homicide by child abuse.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85(A)(1) (2003).Â  The State did not request and the trial court did not\r\n  decide to charge aiding and abetting homicide by child abuse pursuant to\r\n  section 16-3-85(A)(2) until the close of all evidence.Â  \r\n[8] To the extent the majority characterizes Smith's\r\n  inconsistent explanations as Smith having &quot;lied&quot; to conceal his\r\n  involvement in the femur injury, I believe the majority misconstrues the\r\n  facts.Â  As I read the record, medical testimony merely indicated Smith's\r\n  explanations were inconsistent with the victim's resulting injury.Â  The State\r\n  did not present any testimony that Smith fabricated stories to cover up for his\r\n  own involvement in the injury.\r\n[9] Dandridge was the victim's mother.Â  She testified for\r\n  the State during Smith's trial but was not tried simultaneously, and the State\r\n  did not charge her with homicide by child abuse.\r\n[10] Dandridge had custody of the victim the entire two\r\n  days prior to the victim's death (February 12-13th, 2004), and she admitted she\r\n  could not recall every time she gave the victim medicine over that two day\r\n  period.Â  Dandridge further testified she could not remember whether or not she\r\n  gave the victim pseudoephedrine over that two day period.Â  In addition,\r\n  Dandridge came home for lunch around 2 p.m. on the day of the victim's death,\r\n  approximately five hours before Smith called 911 to report the victim was not\r\n  breathing.Â  Finally, Dandridge testified she lied to police during her initial\r\n  interview but she declined to identify the content of her misstatement.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4786","title":"Rodriguez v.

Michael Baxley, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4786\r\nHeard June 8, 2010 â€“ Filed January 26,\r\n  2011Â Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tWalter Christopher Castro, of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tWilliam I. Diggs, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this\r\n  civil case, we must determine whether the circuit court abused its discretion\r\n  in refusing to set aside a default judgment against Jose Reyes d/b/a/ Cinco De\r\n  Mayo Restaurant (Reyes) because Miguel Vazquez's counsel (Vazquez's counsel) personally\r\n  served notice of the damages hearing on Reyes rather than on Reyes's counsel. Â We\r\n  affirm. \r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 17, 2007,\r\n  Alexander Gutierrez (Driver) was driving a vehicle owned by his father, Ernesto\r\n  Gutierrez (Owner).Â  In the vehicle with Driver were three others: Francisco\r\n  Marco (Marco), Humberto Antonio Cruz (Cruz), and Miguel Vazquez (Vazquez).Â  The\r\n  four men had just left the Cinco De Mayo Restaurant (the Restaurant) in Horry\r\n  County where they had been drinking.Â  Driver lost control of the vehicle and\r\n  drove off the road into a tree.Â  Cruz and Marco were killed instantly.Â  Vazquez\r\n  suffered severe and permanent brain damage.Â  \r\nOn June 12, 2007,\r\n  Vazquez filed suit[1] against Driver and Owner based on negligence and against Reyes based on dram\r\n  shop violations (the Vazquez Action).[2]Â \r\n  On June 13, 2007, a companion case was filed on behalf of the Estate of Marco\r\n  (the Marco Action).[3]Â \r\n  On June 14, 2007, the Vazquez and Marco complaints were simultaneously served\r\n  on Reyes.Â  On July 2, 2007, an action (the Cruz Action) was filed on behalf of\r\n  the Estate of Cruz containing the same allegations as the Vazquez and Marco\r\n  actions.[4]Â \r\n  Marco, Cruz, and Vazquez were represented by the same attorney (hereinafter\r\n  Vazquez's counsel).Â  On July 12, 2007, the Axelrod Law Firm (Axelrod) served an\r\n  answer and counterclaim in the Marco Action only.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  Johanna Bufford (Bufford), a paralegal with Vazquez's counsel contacted Axelrod\r\n  to ask if it was accepting service on behalf of Reyes in the Cruz Action.Â  She\r\n  was told, &quot;No.&quot;Â  Bufford then contacted process server Timothy Hecker\r\n  (Hecker) to personally serve the Cruz complaint on Reyes at the Restaurant.Â \r\n  According to Hecker, when he arrived at the Restaurant, a bartender told him Reyes\r\n  was out of the country.Â  However, the bartender was able to call Reyes on his\r\n  cell phone and allowed Hecker to speak directly to Reyes.Â  Hecker stated Reyes\r\n  instructed him to serve the papers on his attorney at Axelrod.Â  At that point,\r\n  Hecker drove to Axelrod and attempted to serve Axelrod with the Cruz complaint;\r\n  however, &quot;the lady that answers the phone, who is a translator&quot; told\r\n  Hecker that Axelrod would not accept service on Reyes's behalf.[5] Â When Hecker reported this to Bufford, she instructed him again to personally serve\r\n  Reyes.Â  Knowing that Reyes was out of the country, Hecker waited for Reyes to\r\n  return.Â  \r\nMeanwhile,\r\n  on August 1, 2007, having received no responsive pleading from Reyes in the\r\n  Vazquez Action, Vazquez's counsel filed a motion for entry of default against Reyes\r\n  in the Vazquez Action.Â  On the motion for entry of default, Vazquez's counsel\r\n  listed W. Christopher Castro (Castro) of Axelrod as the &quot;Defendant's\r\n  Attorney.&quot;Â  Bufford again called Axelrod and asked if it would accept\r\n  service of the motion for entry of default on Reyes's behalf.Â  An employee at\r\n  Axelrod told Bufford that Axelrod would not accept service of the motion.[6]Â \r\n  Accordingly, Bufford contacted Hecker (who, at that point, had still not been\r\n  able to serve the Cruz complaint on Reyes), gave him a copy of the motion, and\r\n  instructed Hecker to personally serve the Vazquez motion for entry of default\r\n  on Reyes at the same time he served Reyes with the Cruz complaint.Â  On August\r\n  2, 2007, at 6:30 a.m., Hecker finally made contact with Reyes at his home and\r\n  served him with the Cruz complaint and the motion for entry of default in the\r\n  Vazquez Action.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  September 5, 2007, the circuit court entered default against Reyes in the Cruz\r\n  and Vazquez Actions.Â  On September 7, 2007, Vazquez's counsel sent a letter to Reyes\r\n  at his home address informing him that a damages hearing in the Vazquez action\r\n  had been scheduled for September 21, 2007, at the Horry County Courthouse.Â  On\r\n  September 19, 2007, however, the hearing date was moved to September 20, 2007.Â \r\n  That same day, Vazquez's counsel sent Reyes another letter informing him of the\r\n  change.Â  On September 20, 2007, the damages hearing was held before the\r\n  Honorable Doyet J. Early, III.Â  Reyes did not appear, nor did anyone appear on\r\n  his behalf.Â  Judge Early heard evidence on the issue of Vazquez's brain\r\n  injuries.Â  On October 25, 2007, Judge Early entered a default judgment in favor\r\n  of Vazquez against Reyes in the amount of $1,575,066.20.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 25, 2007, Castro filed motions to set aside the default judgment in both the Cruz and Vazquez Actions.Â  On February 27, 2008, a hearing was held before\r\n  the Honorable Michael J. Baxley to hear arguments on, among other things, the\r\n  motions to set aside default in the Cruz and Vazquez Actions.[7]Â \r\n  Vazquez's counsel argued Reyes was in default in both actions.Â  In response, Castro\r\n  presented evidence that on August 20, 2007, he filed an answer and counterclaim\r\n  in the Cruz Action, which was within thirty days of the August 2, 2007 service\r\n  of the Cruz complaint on Reyes.Â  Vazquez's counsel countered that the answer\r\n  and counterclaim were, in fact, directed to the Marco Action because even\r\n  though they listed the Cruz number, they contained the Marco caption.Â  Judge\r\n  Baxley ruled the mismatch between the caption and the case number within the\r\n  answer and counterclaim was a good faith error. Â Accordingly, Judge Baxley\r\n  orally granted the motion to set aside default as to Cruz, and allowed Reyes\r\n  ten days to file a correctly captioned and numbered pleading in the Cruz\r\n    Action.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  the circuit court addressed the motion to set aside default as to the Vazquez\r\n    Action, Castro stated, &quot;My motion was strictly under 4066 [the Cruz\r\n  action], Your Honor, motion to set aside default 4066.&quot;Â  On March 25, 2008,\r\n  the circuit court entered a written order from the February 27, 2008 hearing,\r\n  in which the court granted Reyes's motion to set aside default as to Cruz.Â  The\r\n  March 25, 2008 order did not, however, mention the default judgment in favor of\r\n  Vazquez.Â  Reyes did not appeal the March 25, 2008 order, nor did he move for\r\n  reconsideration of that order.\r\nA\r\n  trial for the consolidated cases began on September 15, 2008.Â  In an order\r\n  dated September 15, 2008, the circuit court denied the motion to set aside the\r\n  default judgment in the Vazquez Action.Â  On September 25, 2008, Reyes filed a\r\n  motion pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, and Rule 60, SCRCP, for reconsideration of\r\n  the September 15, 2008 order.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 15, 2008, a hearing was held before Judge Baxley.Â  Judge Baxley made no\r\n  decision at that hearing, but he instructed the parties to return for a\r\n  subsequent hearing on January 14, 2009, at which time they were to present\r\n  testimony on the issue of service in the Vazquez Action.Â  At the January 14,\r\n  2009 hearing, the court heard testimony from Hecker regarding his service of process\r\n  on Reyes in the Vazquez and Cruz Actions.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  the testimony concluded, Castro argued the circuit court should grant the\r\n  motion to set aside default because Vazquez's counsel had engaged in misconduct\r\n  by serving Reyes personally when Vazquez's counsel knew Castro was Reyes's\r\n  attorney.Â  As evidence Vazquez's counsel knew Castro was Reyes's attorney,\r\n  Castro pointed to the August 1, 2007 motion for entry of default, in which Vazquez\r\n  had entered Castro's name in the space for &quot;Defendant's attorney.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  response, Vazquez argued that leading up to the August 1, 2007 filing, there\r\n  had been no responsive pleading in the Vazquez action at all, and the only\r\n  reason he entered Castro's name on the motion for entry of default was because\r\n  Castro had already filed an answer and counterclaim in the Marco Action on July\r\n  12, 2007.Â  Vazquez argued he was simply anticipating Castro's involvement in\r\n  the Vazquez action when he entered Castro's name on the motion for entry of\r\n  default because of his law firm's involvement in the Marco Action.Â  \r\nJudge\r\n  Baxley denied the motion to set aside default as to Vazquez, stating:\r\n\r\n\t[W]hat\r\n  I find here is it's just not fair for the [defendant]'s counsel to take the\r\n  position that we don't accept service for our clients when the process server\r\n  went to . . . try to serve it on the specific instructions of the [plaintiff],\r\n  and then serve the defendant and then come forward and say there's no notice.\r\n\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision whether to set aside an entry of default or a default judgment lies\r\n  solely within the sound discretion of the circuit court. Â Thompson v.\r\n    Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d 900, 902-03 (1989). Â The circuit\r\n  court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an\r\n  abuse of that discretion. Â Mitchell Supply Co. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160,\r\n  162-63, 375 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (Ct. App. 1988). Â An abuse of discretion arises\r\n  when the court issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or when the\r\n  order, based upon factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support. Â Goodson\r\n    v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co., 295 S.C. 400, 402, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Preservation\r\nVazquez\r\n  argues Reyes has not preserved the issue of the motion to set aside default in\r\n  the Vazquez Action because at the February 27, 2008 hearing, Reyes failed to\r\n  argue the motion, and he failed to seek reconsideration of the circuit court's\r\n  March 25, 2008 written order.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen\r\n  an issue or argument has been raised to but not ruled upon by the circuit\r\n  court, a party must file a Rule 59(e) motion in order to preserve it for\r\n  appellate review.Â  Elam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602\r\n  S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004).Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 25, 2007, Reyes filed two motions to set aside default judgments: one\r\n  in the Cruz Action and one in the Vazquez Action.Â  At the February 27, 2008\r\n  hearing, Reyes declined to argue the motion in the Vazquez Action.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  the circuit court issued a written order in which it did not address the motion\r\n  in the Vazquez case.Â  Vazquez argues because Reyes failed to present arguments at\r\n  the hearing or file a motion for rehearing of the March 25, 2008 order, Reyes\r\n  abandoned the motion.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  we find the circuit court intended to hear the motion in the Vazquez Action at\r\n  a later time.Â  After the discussion of the motion to set aside default in the\r\n  Cruz Action at the February 27, 2008 hearing, the court asked if there were any\r\n  further motions.Â  In response, Castro asked, &quot;[A]re we going to address\r\n  [the motion in the Vazquez Action] I guess since everything has been re-captioned\r\n  3654 should those be left alone since they are already filed or how should they\r\n  be addressed?&quot;Â  The circuit court responded, &quot;Let's leave it alone\r\n  since they are already filed . . . .&quot;Â  After briefly discussing the motion\r\n  with counsel for both sides, the circuit court ultimately held, &quot;I sense\r\n  that you guys are talking to me and not talking to one another, clearly, so I'm\r\n  going to let y'all have some discussions on that.Â  We'll leave it where it\r\n    is and move on, all right.Â  Have a good day.Â  Thank you.&quot;Â  (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nWe hold the circuit\r\n  court was merely continuing the motion to set aside default in the Vazquez\r\n  Action.Â  Accordingly, Reyes did not abandon the motion at the February 27, 2008\r\n  hearing.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 60(b), SCRCP\r\nReyes\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in refusing to set aside the default judgment\r\n  because Vazquez's counsel personally served Reyes, despite the fact that Vazquez's\r\n  counsel affirmatively acknowledged in the motion for entry of default that Reyes\r\n  was represented by counsel.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;Once\r\n  a default judgment has been entered, a party seeking to be relieved must do so\r\n  under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.&quot;Â  Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus.,\r\n    Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 608, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2009).Â  &quot;The standard\r\n  for granting relief from an entry of default is 'good cause' under Rule 55(c) .\r\n  . . while the standard is more rigorous for granting relief from a default\r\n  judgment under Rule 60(b) . . . .&quot; Â Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C.\r\n  372, 374, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  Rule 60(b) requires a more\r\n  particularized showing of mistake, inadvertence, excusable neglect, surprise,\r\n  newly discovered evidence, fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an\r\n  adverse party.Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether to grant a motion\r\n  under Rule 60(b), the circuit court should consider: (1) the promptness with\r\n  which relief is sought; (2) the reasons for the failure to act promptly; (3)\r\n  the existence of a meritorious defense; and (4) the prejudice to the other\r\n  party.Â  Mictronics, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 345 S.C. 506, 510-11,\r\n  548 S.E.2d 223, 226 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;The movant in a Rule 60(b) motion\r\n  has the burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle\r\n  him to relief.&quot;Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 304 S.C. 65, 67, 403 S.E.2d 127,\r\n  129 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n1.&nbsp; Promptness with which\r\n  relief is sought \r\nThe\r\n  original complaint in the Vazquez Action was served on June 14, 2007.Â  Castro\r\n  contended at oral argument that he undertook representation of Reyes on behalf\r\n  of Axelrod at some time in early August 2007, soon after an Axelrod employee\r\n  told Hecker that Axelrod did not represent Reyes.Â  However, Castro made no\r\n  attempts whatsoever to inform either the circuit court or opposing counsel of\r\n  his representation until September 27, 2007, when Castro filed a purported\r\n  answer.Â  The answer did not contain a motion for relief from default.Â  The\r\n  first time Castro filed a motion to set aside the default in the Vazquez Action\r\n  was on October 25, 2007, which was the same day Judge Early issued the\r\n  $1,575,066.20 default judgment.Â  At the subsequent February 27, 2008 hearing on\r\n  the two motions to set aside default, Castro declined to argue the motion in the\r\n  Vazquez Action.Â  The issue of the Vazquez default does not appear to have been\r\n  raised again until the trial in September 2008.Â  In sum, Reyes failed to act\r\n  promptly in seeking relief.\r\n2.&nbsp; Reasons for the failure to\r\n  act promptly\r\nReyes\r\n  argues the default judgment should be set aside because Vazquez's counsel sent\r\n  notice of the damages hearing to Reyes, who does not read English, instead of\r\n  sending notice to Reyes's counsel.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nVazquez\r\n  presented evidence that Castro affirmatively denied representing Reyes in late\r\n  July 2007; both Bufford and Hecker filed affidavits to that effect.Â \r\n  Consequently, it was reasonable for Vazquez's counsel to thereafter serve\r\n  notice on Reyes personally, particularly when Vazquez's counsel did not receive\r\n  notice that Reyes was being represented in the Vazquez Action until September\r\n  27, 2007, when Castro served a purported answer in the Vazquez Action.\r\nReyes\r\n  also argues because Vazquez's counsel wrote Castro's name on the motion for\r\n  entry of default, Vazquez's counsel thereby acknowledged that Reyes was represented\r\n  by counsel, and this acknowledgment created a duty to serve Castro, as Reyes's\r\n  counsel, rather than Reyes.Â  We disagree.\r\nReyes\r\n  cites Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP, which states, in pertinent part: &quot;Whenever\r\n  under these rules service is required or permitted to be made upon a party\r\n  represented by an attorney the service shall be made upon the attorney unless\r\n  service upon the party himself is ordered by the court.&quot;Â  Castro contended at oral argument he had &quot;no\r\n  idea&quot; of the default in the Vazquez Action until after the damages\r\n  hearing.Â  However, Castro admitted at the January 14, 2009 hearing that Reyes\r\n  delivered two complaints to him in June 2007.Â  Because the Cruz complaint was\r\n  not filed until July 2, 2007, and not served until August 2007, it would appear\r\n  the two complaints to which counsel referred were necessarily the Marco and\r\n  Vazquez complaints.[8]Â \r\n  Despite receiving these two complaints from Reyes in June, and undertaking to\r\n  represent Reyes in early August, Castro made no attempt to inform Vazquez's\r\n  counsel of his representation until the end of September.Â  We hold that Rule\r\n  5(b)(1) does not require service upon an attorney when, as in this case, the\r\n  attorney gives no indication of his representation to either the court or\r\n  opposing counsel.Â  Accordingly, there is evidence in the record that Reyes's reasons\r\n  for failing to act promptly were inadequate.\r\n3.&nbsp; Existence of a meritorious\r\n  defense\r\nTo\r\n  establish that he has a meritorious defense, a complainant need not show that\r\n  he would prevail on the merits, only that his defense is meritorious.Â  Thompson,\r\n  299 S.C. at 120, 382 S.E.2d at 903.Â  A meritorious defense need only be one\r\n  &quot;worthy of a hearing or judicial inquiry because it raises a question of\r\n  law deserving of some investigation or a real controversy as to real facts\r\n  arising from conflicting or doubtful evidence.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Graham\r\n    v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 248 S.E.2d 594 (1978)).\r\nAs\r\n  stated above, &quot;[t]he movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the burden of\r\n  presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle him to\r\n  relief.&quot;Â  Bowers, 304 S.C. at 67, 403 S.E.2d at 129.Â  Reyes does\r\n  not appear to present a meritorious defense in his brief; rather, the brief is\r\n  limited to his argument that notice should have been sent to Reyes's counsel\r\n  rather than to Reyes directly.Â  In his motion to set aside default, Reyes's\r\n  only defense is that Reyes does not read English.Â  As noted above, however, Reyes's\r\n  counsel admitted Reyes relayed the pertinent pleadings served on Reyes to\r\n  counsel in June.Â  Consequently, Reyes did not meet his burden of establishing a\r\n  meritorious defense.Â  \r\n4.&nbsp; Prejudice to the other\r\n  party\r\nReyes\r\n  does not discuss prejudice in his brief.Â  Consequently, we find Reyes has\r\n  failed to meet his burden as to this factor.Â  See Bowers, 304\r\n  S.C. at 67, 403 S.E.2d at 129 (&quot;The movant in a Rule 60(b) motion has the\r\n  burden of presenting evidence proving the facts essential to entitle him to\r\n  relief.&quot;).Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find Reyes\r\n  failed to establish he was entitled to have the default judgment set aside in\r\n  the Vazquez action.Â  Thus, we hold the circuit court did not err in refusing to\r\n  set aside the default judgment.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF,\r\n  SHORT, and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Miriam\r\n  Rodriguez served as personal representative for the Estates of Cruz and Marco\r\n  as well as Next Friend for Vazquez in the underlying action.Â  Although\r\n  Rodriquez's name is listed on the case caption, the court references the\r\n  substantive parties for purposes of this opinion. \r\n[2] The Vazquez\r\n  Action was filed as case number 2007-CP-26-3654.\r\n[3] The Marco Action\r\n  was filed as case number 2007-CP-26-3664.\r\n[4] The Cruz Action\r\n  was filed as case number 2007-CP-26-4066.\r\n[5] Although Hecker\r\n  did not recall the exact date he went to Axelrod, he did state it was &quot;late\r\n  in July [2007].&quot;Â  \r\n[6] In her\r\n  affidavit, Bufford does not identify the position of the employee with whom she\r\n  spoke on August 1, 2007; she only identifies her as &quot;Karen.&quot;Â  \r\n[7] Prior to ruling\r\n  on the motions to set aside default, Judge Baxley consolidated the Cruz, Marco,\r\n  and Vazquez cases, along with an interpleader action brought by Nationwide\r\n  Insurance Company against Owner, Driver, Vazquez, Marco, and Cruz.Â  Judge\r\n  Baxley consolidated the cases under case number 2007-CP-26-3664, which was\r\n  originally the case number for the Marco Action.Â  \r\n[8] The record\r\n  supports this conclusion, as it contains two affidavits of personal service-one\r\n  in the Marco Action, the other in the Vazquez Action-both of which state Reyes\r\n  was served on June 14, 2007.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4787","title":"State v.

Provet informed Owens that\r\n  the vehicle's owner was another girlfriend who lived in Charlotte, North\r\n  Carolina.Â  He stated that he recently graduated from a technical institution\r\n  but was unemployed.Â  Provet informed Owens he was in Greenville for two days\r\n  but was not carrying any luggage.Â  Based on Provet's responses, Owens believed\r\n  Provet was deceptive, prompting Owens to call Trooper Eddie Aman (Aman), an\r\n  officer assigned with the drug detection canine unit, to report to the scene.Â  \r\nAfter contacting Aman,\r\n  Owens returned to Provet's vehicle to check the vehicle identification number.\r\n  &nbsp;When looking through the front windshield, Owens observed several air\r\n  fresheners, numerous fast food bags, a cell phone, and some receipts.\r\n  Consistent with Provet's admission at the commencement of the stop, Owens\r\n  stated he saw no luggage in the vehicle, only one bag on the rear seat.&nbsp; However,\r\n  Owens later stated that there was a luggage bag on the rear seat.Â  When\r\n  subsequently asked to clarify his observations regarding the bag on the rear\r\n  seat at trial, Owens stated that he did not recall whether the bag was a\r\n  luggage bag.Â  Despite this apparent inconsistency regarding the presence of\r\n  luggage, Owens' experience and observations caused him to conclude Provet was\r\n  involved in criminal activity.\r\nOwens returned\r\n  Provet's driver's license and vehicle registration and then issued a traffic\r\n  warning citation.Â  After explaining the warning citation, Owens immediately\r\n  asked Provet whether he had anything illegal in the vehicle.Â  Provet responded\r\n  in the negative.Â  Owens then asked to search the vehicle, and Provet consented\r\n  to the search.Â  As Aman was attempting to remove a fast food bag as a\r\n  precautionary measure for the drug detection canine, Provet fled the scene,\r\n  running across six lanes of traffic on Interstate 85.Â  Provet was apprehended.Â \r\n  The drug detection canine alerted to the cocaine in the fast food bag.Â  Provet\r\n  was indicted by a Greenville County grand jury for resisting arrest and\r\n  trafficking cocaine more than 100 grams.[1]Â  \r\nBefore trial,\r\n  Provet made a motion to suppress the cocaine because it was obtained through an\r\n  illegal search.Â  The trial court denied Provet's motion and concluded Owens had\r\n  probable cause to conduct a traffic stop and reasonable suspicion of a serious\r\n  crime.Â  The trial court found Provet's consent was voluntarily given.Â  A jury\r\n  convicted Provet, and the trial court sentenced him to twenty-five years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn Fourth Amendment\r\n  cases, the trial court's factual rulings are reviewed under the &quot;clear\r\n  error&quot; standard.Â Â  State v. Brockman, 339 S.C. 57, 66, 528 S.E.2d\r\n  661, 666 (2000).Â  Under the &quot;clear error&quot; standard, an appellate\r\n  court will not reverse a trial court's findings of fact simply because it would\r\n  have decided the case differently.Â  State v. Pichardo, 367 S.C.\r\n  84, 96, 623 S.E.2d 840, 846 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Therefore, we will affirm if\r\n  there is any evidence to support the trial court's rulings.Â  State v. Khingratsaiphon,&nbsp;352\r\n  S.C. 62, 70, 572 S.E.2d 456, 460&nbsp;(2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA. Detention \r\nProvet does not\r\n  appeal the trial court's ruling that Owens had probable cause to conduct a\r\n  traffic stop of the vehicle based on his observation that Provet was following\r\n  another vehicle too closely and had a burned out tag light.Â  However, Provet\r\n  contends his detention was unlawfully prolonged because Owens' questioning of\r\n  Provet was unrelated to the traffic stop.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  Fourth Amendment guarantees &quot;[t]he right of the people to be secure in\r\n  their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and\r\n  seizures . . . .&quot; U.S. Const. amend. IV.Â  The Fourth Amendment protects\r\n  against unreasonable searches and seizures, including seizures that involve\r\n  only a brief detention.Â  Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 97, 623 S.E.2d at 847\r\n  (citing United States v. Mendenhall, 446 U.S. 544, 551 (1980)).Â  The\r\n  temporary detention during an automobile stop, even if only for a brief and\r\n  limited purpose, constitutes a seizure under the Fourth Amendment.Â  Pichardo,\r\n  367 S.C. at 97, 623 S.E.2d at 847 (citing Whren v. United States,&nbsp;517\r\n  U.S. 806, 809-10 (1996)).Â  Generally, the decision to conduct a traffic stop is\r\n  reasonable when the police have probable cause to believe a traffic violation\r\n  has occurred.Â  Whren, 517 U.S. at 810.\r\nDuring\r\n  the traffic stop, Owens asked Provet where he was coming from, where the\r\n  Holiday Inn was located, his employment status, and the duration of his stay in\r\n  Greenville.Â  In addition, he inquired about the vehicle's third-party\r\n  registration.Â  We conclude Owens' questions were tangentially related to the\r\n  traffic stop.Â  See State v. Rivera, 384 S.C. 356, 359, 682 S.E.2d\r\n  307, 309 (Ct. App. 2009) (concluding officer's questions concerning where the\r\n  defendants were coming from, how long they had been there, where they were\r\n  going, and the purpose of their trip were tangentially related to the purpose\r\n  of the traffic stop).Â  Moreover, even if Owens' questioning of Provet was\r\n  unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop, Provet's argument is not\r\n  persuasive because the Fourth Amendment does not per se prohibit questions\r\n  unrelated to the purpose of the traffic stop unless the unrelated questions unreasonably\r\n  extend the traffic stop's duration.Â  In this case, we conclude Owens did not\r\n  unreasonably extend the traffic stop, because the entire traffic stop amounted\r\n  to less than eleven minutes.Â  Furthermore, Owens'\r\n  series of questions and observations occurred prior to the conclusion of the\r\n  traffic stop because Owens was waiting to hear from dispatch regarding Provet's\r\n  license and registration, and a warning citation had yet to be issued.Â  As a\r\n  result, we conclude the traffic stop was not unreasonably extended.Â  See Arizona\r\n    v. Johnson, 129 S. Ct. 781, 788 (2009) (&quot;An officer's inquiries into matters unrelated to the\r\n  justification for the traffic stop, this Court has made plain, do not convert\r\n  the encounter into something other than a lawful seizure, so long as those\r\n  inquiries do not measurably extend the duration of the stop.&quot;); see also United States v. Jeffus, 22 F.3d 554, 557 (4th Cir. 1994)\r\n  (approving fifteen minute traffic stop).\r\nB. Reasonable Suspicion\r\nProvet\r\n  argues Owens did not have reasonable suspicion of a serious crime.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nLengthening the\r\n  detention for further questioning beyond that related to the initial stop is\r\n  acceptable in two situations: (1) the officer has an objectively reasonable and\r\n  articulable suspicion illegal activity has occurred or is occurring; or (2) the\r\n  initial detention has become a consensual encounter.Â  Pichardo, 367 S.C.\r\n  at 99, 623 S.E.2d at 848 (citing United States v. Hunnicutt, 135 F.3d\r\n  1345, 1349 (10th Cir. 1998)).Â  Reasonable suspicion\r\n  requires a particularized and objective basis that would lead one to suspect\r\n  another of criminal activity.Â  State v. Woodruff, 344 S.C. 537, 546, 544\r\n  S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing United States v. Cortez,\r\n  449 U.S. 411, 417-18 (1981)).Â  In determining whether reasonable suspicion exists, the trial court must consider the\r\n  totality of the circumstances.Â  State v. Willard,&nbsp;374 S.C. 129,\r\n  134, 647 S.E.2d 252, 255&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007).Â  Generally\r\n  stated, reasonable suspicion is a standard that requires\r\n  more than a &quot;hunch&quot; but less than probable cause.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Reasonable suspicion &quot;is not readily, or even usefully, reduced to a neat\r\n  set of legal rules, but, rather, entails common sense, nontechnical conceptions\r\n  that deal with factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which\r\n  reasonable and prudent persons, not legal technicians, act.&quot;Â  United\r\n    States v. Foreman, 369 F.3d 776, 781&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2004).Â  Therefore,\r\n  courts must &quot;consider the totality of the circumstances&quot; and\r\n  &quot;give due weight to common sense judgments reached by officers in light of\r\n  their experience and training.&quot;Â  United States v. Perkins, 363 F.3d\r\n  317, 321 (4th Cir. 2004).Â  &quot;Reasonableness is measured in objective terms\r\n  by examining the totality of the circumstances.Â  As a result, the nature of the\r\n  reasonableness inquiry is highly fact-specific.&quot;Â  State v. Tindall,\r\n  388 S.C. 518, 527, 698 S.E.2d 203, 208 (2010).Â  \r\nIn support of his\r\n  argument that Owens lacked reasonable suspicion, Provet cites State v.\r\n    Rivera, 384 S.C. 356, 682 S.E.2d 307 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  In Rivera, an\r\n  officer stopped Rivera for following another vehicle too closely.Â  Id. at 359, 682 S.E.2d at 309.Â  During the stop, the officer asked Rivera to step\r\n  out of the vehicle and asked where he and the passenger, Medero, were coming\r\n  from, how long they had been there, where they were going, and the purpose of\r\n  their trip.Â  Id.Â  Rivera and Medero gave conflicting stories regarding\r\n  the purpose of their trip.Â  Id.Â  The officer informed Rivera he would\r\n  receive a traffic warning citation and then proceeded to call for backup.Â  Rivera,\r\n  384 S.C. at 359-60, 682 S.E.2d at 309.Â  The officer then discussed the\r\n  transport of drugs on the interstate and asked if any weapons, drugs, or large\r\n  sums of money were in the vehicle.Â  Id.Â  Rivera replied in the\r\n  negative.Â  Id. at 360, 682 S.E.2d at 309.Â  The officer subsequently\r\n  asked for permission to search the vehicle, and Rivera consented.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The search revealed heroin in the vehicle's engine.Â  Rivera, 384 S.C. at\r\n  360, 682 S.E.2d at 309. \r\nAt trial, Rivera\r\n  and Medero moved to suppress the evidence on the basis that the traffic stop\r\n  was unlawfully prolonged and the consent was invalid.Â  Id.Â  The trial\r\n  court granted the suppression motion on the basis that the officer lacked\r\n  &quot;sufficient indicators of criminal activity to justify any continued detention&quot;\r\n  beyond the purpose of the traffic stop.Â  Id.Â  In granting deference to\r\n  the trial court because of the &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of review,\r\n  this court upheld the trial court's suppression of the evidence.Â  Id. at\r\n  363, 682 S.E.2d at 311. \r\nFirst, this court\r\n  found the rental vehicle was lawfully detained and the officer's questioning of\r\n  Rivera and Medero regarding the purpose, destination, and duration of their\r\n  trip was reasonably related to the traffic stop.Â  Rivera, 384 S.C. at\r\n  362, 682 S.E.2d at 310. Â However, this court found the purpose of the traffic\r\n  stop was accomplished when the officer informed Rivera he would receive a\r\n  warning citation.Â  Id.Â  As a result, our court concluded the officer's\r\n  discussion concerning the transport of drugs on the interstate exceeded the\r\n  scope of the traffic stop and constituted a second and illegal detention unless\r\n  the continued detention was supported by reasonable suspicion.Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  analyzing whether the officer had reasonable suspicion, this court found Rivera\r\n  and Medero's nervousness standing alone did not create suspicion of criminal\r\n  behavior, and their stories were not so inconsistent as to indicate criminal\r\n  behavior.Â  Id. at 362-63, 682 S.E.2d at 310-11.Â  Furthermore, this court\r\n  found the absence of luggage in the back seat did not provide reasonable\r\n  suspicion particularly when the trunk, the usual place for luggage, &quot;was\r\n  filled&quot; with suitcases.Â  Rivera, 384 S.C. at 363, 682 S.E.2d at\r\n  311.Â  Finally, this court found that there was no evidence of air fresheners located\r\n  in the vehicle based on the trial court's order.Â  Id.\r\nSimilar\r\n  to Rivera, Owens' questions concerning Provet's destination and the\r\n  purpose of his trip were reasonably related to the traffic stop, but unlike in Rivera,\r\n  there are additional factors to be considered in this case.Â  Owens testified Provet's\r\n  vehicle contained several air fresheners.Â  Additionally, Provet admitted he did\r\n  not have any luggage for his two-day stay in Greenville.\r\nFurther, we note\r\n  our supreme court's recent decision in Tindall.Â  In Tindall, an\r\n  officer stopped Tindall for speeding, following another vehicle too closely,\r\n  and failing to maintain his lane.Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 520, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  at 204.Â  The officer asked Tindall for his driver's license, registration,\r\n  insurance, and the rental car agreement.Â  Id. at 522, 698 S.E.2d at\r\n  205.Â  The officer then asked Tindall to exit his vehicle and to sit in the\r\n  patrol car.Â  Id.Â  While Tindall was exiting his vehicle, the officer\r\n  testified that Tindall did a &quot;felony stretch.&quot;[2]Â  Id.Â  The officer subsequently patted down Tindall and placed him in the\r\n  patrol car.Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 522, 698 S.E.2d at 205.Â  At this\r\n  point, the officer questioned Tindall regarding his destination, and Tindall\r\n  informed the officer he was visiting his brother in Durham, North Carolina.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The officer called in Tindall's driver's license and registration to dispatch.Â  Id.Â  Approximately three minutes later, dispatch reported no problems\r\n  with Tindall's driver's license and vehicle, and the officer told Tindall he\r\n  would write him a warning ticket.Â  Id.Â  However, the officer refused to\r\n  issue the ticket at this point and continued to question Tindall for\r\n  approximately another six to seven minutes regarding &quot;where he was\r\n  going,&quot; &quot;the purpose of the trip,&quot; &quot;what exit he would take\r\n  to get to Durham,&quot; &quot;whether he had ever been charged with any drug\r\n  crimes,&quot; &quot;what type of business he was in,&quot; and &quot;various\r\n  questions about his business.&quot;Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 522, 698\r\n  S.E.2d at 205. \r\nApproximately\r\n  fifteen to twenty minutes into the traffic stop, the officer asked Tindall if\r\n  he could search his vehicle, and Tindall replied, &quot;I don't care&quot; or\r\n  &quot;I don't mind.&quot;Â  Id. at 520, 698 S.E.2d at 204.Â  The search\r\n  revealed a substantial amount of cocaine.Â  Id. at 520-21, 698 S.E.2d at\r\n  204.Â  Tindall was convicted of trafficking cocaine in excess of four hundred\r\n  grams and assessed a $250,000 fine.Â  Id. at 520, 698 S.E.2d at 204.Â  On\r\n  appeal to our supreme court, Tindall argued the court of appeals erred in\r\n  affirming the trial court's denial of his motions to suppress the cocaine and\r\n  his statement to the police.Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 520, 698 S.E.2d at\r\n  204.Â  \r\nOur\r\n  supreme court held the &quot;officer's continued detention of Tindall exceeded\r\n  the scope of the traffic stop and constituted a seizure for purposes of the\r\n  Fourth Amendment.&quot;Â  Id. at 522, 698 S.E.2d at 205.Â  The court found\r\n  the purpose of the traffic stop was accomplished when the dispatcher reported\r\n  no problems with Tindall's driver's license and vehicle, and the only remaining\r\n  task was the issuance of the warning ticket.Â  Id.Â  The court concluded\r\n  the continued questioning of Tindall exceeded the scope of the traffic stop and\r\n  constituted a seizure under the Fourth Amendment. Id.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  court stated, &quot;[A] reasonable person in Tindall's position â€“ seated in the\r\n  front seat of the patrol car with two officers standing at his door, another\r\n  officer to his left, and a police dog in the back seat â€“ would not have felt free\r\n  to terminate the encounter.&quot;Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 522-23, 698\r\n  S.E.2d at 205.\r\nOur supreme court\r\n  next analyzed whether the officer had reasonable suspicion of a serious crime\r\n  when he chose not to conclude the traffic stop, despite his stated intention to\r\n  issue a warning ticket.Â  At the time of the continued detention, the officer\r\n  discovered the following: (1) &quot;Tindall was driving to Durham to meet his\r\n  brother&quot;; (2) &quot;Tindall was driving a rental car rented the previous\r\n  day by another individual which was to be returned to Atlanta on the day of the\r\n  stop&quot;; (3) &quot;Tindall did a 'felony stretch' on exiting the\r\n  vehicle&quot;; and (4) &quot;Tindall seemed nervous.&quot;Â  Id. at 523,\r\n  698 S.E.2d at 206.Â  The court concluded these facts did not provide a\r\n  sufficient basis for reasonable suspicion.Â  Id.Â  Therefore, the supreme\r\n  court reversed the trial court's ruling on the motion to suppress the cocaine.Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the supreme court held Tindall's consent to the\r\n  search of his vehicle was invalid because it was the product of an unlawful\r\n  detention under the Fourth Amendment.Â  Id.\r\nWe conclude the\r\n  present case is distinguishable from Tindall.Â  In Tindall, the\r\n  officer questioned Tindall for approximately six to seven minutes after the\r\n  purpose of the traffic stop was accomplished, and thus, a continued detention\r\n  occurred.Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 522, 698 S.E.2d at 205.Â  Conversely, Owens'\r\n  series of questions and observations occurred prior to the conclusion of the\r\n  traffic stop because Owens was waiting to hear from dispatch regarding Provet's\r\n  license and registration and a warning citation had yet to be issued.Â  We\r\n  conclude Owens developed his reasonable suspicion as a result of additional factors\r\n  that were not present in Tindall. Â \r\nIn the case at\r\n  hand, the trial court found reasonable suspicion existed to support Owens'\r\n  further detention of Provet based on Owens ascertaining (1) Provet was nervous\r\n  as displayed by extreme shaking of the hands and accelerated breathing, (2)\r\n  third-party vehicle registration is very common in drug trafficking, (3) Provet's\r\n  admission to visiting one girlfriend while driving a different girlfriend's\r\n  vehicle, (4) Provet's claim he was coming from the Holiday Inn even though the\r\n  traffic violation occurred prior to that hotel's exit, (5) Provet's presence in\r\n  Greenville for two days without any luggage, (6) the presence of numerous fast\r\n  food bags, a cell phone, and some receipts in Provet's vehicle,[3] and (7) the presence of several air fresheners in the vehicle that produced a\r\n  strong odor.[4]Â \r\n  Â Â Â Â \r\nWe\r\n  are keenly aware that some of the items found in Provet's vehicle are\r\n  commonplace and consistent with innocent travel. However, after reviewing the\r\n  record to determine if the trial court's ultimate determination is supported by\r\n  the evidence and analyzing the totality of the circumstances, we conclude there\r\n  is evidence to support the trial court's ruling that reasonable suspicion\r\n  existed in this case.Â  See United States v.\r\n    Sokolow, 490 U.S. 1, 9 (1989) (&quot;Any one of these factors is not by itself\r\n  proof of any illegal conduct and is quite consistent with innocent travel. But\r\n  we think taken together they amount to reasonable suspicion.&quot;); see also United\r\n    States v. Mason, No. 07-4900, 2010 WL 4977817, (4th Cir. Dec. 8, 2010)\r\n  (&quot;But just as one corner of a picture might not reveal the picture's\r\n  subject or nature, each component that contributes to reasonable suspicion\r\n  might not alone give rise to reasonable suspicion.&quot;); United States v.\r\n    Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir. 2008)Â  (&quot;[C]ontext matters:\r\n  actions that may appear innocuous at a certain time or in a certain place may\r\n  very well serve as a harbinger of criminal activity under different\r\n  circumstances.&quot;).\r\nProvet asserts the\r\n  trial court's finding of reasonable suspicion would amount to a finding of\r\n  reasonable suspicion of illegal activity for a majority of the vehicles on\r\n  South Carolina's roadways.Â  However, the combination of the commonplace items\r\n  (i.e., numerous air fresheners, fast food bags, and several receipts) together\r\n  with the surrounding circumstances (i.e., traveling two days without any\r\n  luggage and inconsistent stories about where he was coming from and going to) eliminate\r\n  a substantial portion of innocent travelers.Â  See Foreman, 369\r\n  F.3d at 781&nbsp;(4th Cir. 2004) (&quot;[A]rticulated factors together must\r\n  serve to eliminate a substantial portion of innocent travelers before the\r\n  requirement of reasonable suspicion will be satisfied.&quot;).Â  \r\nFurthermore, we conclude\r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in concluding reasonable suspicion\r\n  existed based on the totality of the circumstances, particularly considering\r\n  Owens' four years of experience as a member of the South Carolina Highway\r\n  Patrol's Aggressive Criminal Enforcement Unit.Â  See United States v.\r\n    Lender, 985 F.2d 151, 154&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1993) (&quot;Courts are not remiss\r\n  in crediting the practical experience of officers who observe on a daily basis\r\n  what transpires on the street.&quot;); see also Foreman, 369 F.3d at 785&nbsp;(holding\r\n  reasonable suspicion existed to order dog sniff when (1) the defendant traveled\r\n  from Norfolk, Virginia to New York City (a drug source city) and back\r\n  (approximately seven hours each way) within a single day to visit his brother\r\n  who was purportedly evicted; (2) the defendant was exceptionally nervous, which\r\n  became more pronounced when a trooper raised the issue of drug trafficking; (3)\r\n  the defendant had multiple air fresheners in his car, which are often used to\r\n  disguise the odor of narcotics; and\r\n  (4) the trooper had considerable experience with drug interdiction); Mason,\r\n  2010 WL 4977817, (holding reasonable suspicion existed to order a dog sniff\r\n  when (1) the defendant did not pull over promptly and the officer suspected\r\n  that the defendant and the passenger were deliberating whether to comply or\r\n  flee before pulling over; (2) the defendant's vehicle had an\r\n  &quot;extreme&quot; odor of air fresheners beyond the officer's normal\r\n  experience from the ordinary use of air fresheners; (3) the defendant had a\r\n  single key on his key ring coupled with the fact that the defendant and the\r\n  passenger were coming from a major drug source city, which could indicate their\r\n  participation in a &quot;turnaround&quot; trip as drug couriers; (4) the\r\n  defendant was sweating and unusually nervous, which became more pronounced as\r\n  the traffic stop continued; and (5) the defendant and the passenger gave\r\n  conflicting stories regarding their trip).Â  \r\nTherefore, we\r\n  conclude the trial court did not err in finding reasonable suspicion existed to\r\n  further detain Provet because there is evidence in the record to support the\r\n  trial court's ruling.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp; Voluntary Consent\r\nProvet also argues he did not voluntarily\r\n  consent to the search of the vehicle.Â  We disagree.\r\nWarrantless\r\n  searches and seizures are reasonable within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment\r\n  when conducted under the authority of voluntary consent.Â  Pichardo, 367\r\n  S.C. at 105, 623 S.E.2d at 851.Â  Undoubtedly, a law enforcement officer may\r\n  request permission to search at any time.Â  Id.Â  The State bears the\r\n  burden of establishing the voluntariness of the consent.Â  Id.Â  The voluntariness of a consent to search is a question\r\n  of fact to be determined from the totality of the circumstances. Id.Â  A\r\n  trial court's conclusions on issues of fact regarding\r\n  voluntariness will not be disturbed on appeal unless so manifestly erroneous as\r\n  to be an abuse of discretion. Â Â Pichardo, 367 S.C. at 106, 623 S.E.2d at\r\n  851-52.\r\nWe conclude\r\n  Provet's consent was voluntary based on the totality of the circumstances.Â \r\n  During the suppression hearing, Owens testified he was not going to let Provet\r\n  leave when he asked for Provet's consent to search Provet's vehicle.Â  However,\r\n  Owens did not convey this statement to Provet and stated Provet should have\r\n  felt free to go because his driver's license and vehicle registration were\r\n  returned and his traffic warning citation was issued.Â  Moreover, Owens\r\n  testified that he and Aman were the only officers at the scene at the time of\r\n  the consent, Aman arrived in an unmarked police vehicle, and the drug detection\r\n  canine was inside Aman's vehicle.Â  Also, Owens indicated he did not make any\r\n  promises in exchange for Provet's consent, no physical force was used, no guns\r\n  were pointed, and no threatening tone was used in obtaining Provet's consent.Â \r\n  Thus, we conclude based on the totality of the circumstances, the trial court\r\n  did not err in concluding Provet voluntarily consented to the search of the\r\n  vehicle.Â  See State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 585, 575 S.E.2d\r\n  852, 856&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (finding the presence of four police officers and\r\n  a drug dog did not negate the defendant's consent to search his vehicle when\r\n  there was no evidence of any overt actions, threats of force, or other forms of\r\n  coercion). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  trial court's decision is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and SHORT,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]South Carolina Code section 44-53-370(e)(2)(c)-(e) (2002)\r\n  classifies &quot;trafficking in cocaine&quot; in the following weight amounts: one hundred grams or more, but less than two hundred grams;\r\n  two hundred grams or more, but less than four hundred grams; and four hundred\r\n  grams or more. \r\n[2] According to the officer's testimony, a &quot;felony\r\n  stretch&quot; occurs when an individual raises his hands in a stress relief\r\n  action.Â Â Â  Tindall, 388 S.C. at 522, 698 S.E.2d at 205.\r\n[3] We recognize Owens' testimony was inconsistent as to\r\n  the presence of luggage in Provet's vehicle.&nbsp; However, we find the trial\r\n  court's conclusion that Provet was traveling without luggage was not\r\n  prejudicial in light of Provet's own statement to Owens that he was traveling\r\n  without any luggage.&nbsp; See State v. King, 367 S.C. 131, 136,\r\n  623 S.E.2d 865, 867 (Ct. App. 2005) (&quot;Error without prejudice does not\r\n  warrant reversal.&quot;).\r\n[4] According to Owens, numerous air fresheners are\r\n  used to disguise odors from law enforcement and drug detection canines.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
