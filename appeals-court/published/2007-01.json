Dukes, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.:Â  Okatie Hotel Group, LLC (Owner) appeals the trial courtâ€™s failure to consider settlement payments to seven other subcontractors (Other Subcontractors) and damages to the building when determining Ownerâ€™s liability to Taylor, Cotton and Ridley, Inc. (Subcontractor).Â  Owner also appeals the trial courtâ€™s disregard of a waiver made by Subcontractor, use of an interest rate greater than the statutory maximum, and award of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Devcon Group, Inc. (General Contractor) served as the general contractor for Ownerâ€™s development of the Marriott Fairfield Inn.Â  General Contractor hired Subcontractor to install door frames and locks for the development at an original contract price of $91,570.00. This original contract price increased to $115,085.75, due to additional line items, a revised door frame jam, and installation of â€œVing cardâ€ locks.Â  Subcontractor finished all major work and billed General Contractor by November 23, 1999, but was called back to the job site on several occasions to perform further installations and repairs.Â  By December 6, 1999, Subcontractor had submitted a notice of non-payment and received $20,000 toward the total contract price of $115,085.75.Â  The last service performed by Subcontractor was on March 8, 2000, when Subcontractor returned to install and repair exterior door locks. On April 24, 2000, Subcontractor filed a mechanicâ€™s lien for the $95,085.75 which remained due under the contract.Â  \r\nThe amended total contract between General Contractor and Owner was $2,421,656.00, and prior to Subcontractorâ€™s lien filing, Owner paid General Contractor $2,166,613.00. Other Subcontractors claimed liens totaling $146,330.00, but, following mediation in the spring of 2001, they settled for $92,385.00.Â  All Other Subcontractors participated in this mediation, but Subcontractor did not.Â  \r\nSubcontractor filed suit against General Contractor and Owner to enforce Subcontractorâ€™s lien against the developed property.Â  At trial, the court adjusted the contract price by first decreasing it to $2,417,564.00 to reflect back charges, and then by increasing it to $2,461,510.00 to include change orders.Â  The trial court found no adjustments were necessary for liquidated damages and held General Contractor and Owner were jointly and severally liable to Subcontractor for the lien of $95,085.15 with a 1.5% interest rate beginning in December of 1999.Â  This accrued interest brought the total judgment amount to $184,940.62.Â  In addition to this amount, the court, through a subsequent order issued on September 22, 2005, awarded Subcontractor $31,272.19 in attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA proceeding for the enforcement of a statutory lien, such as a mechanicâ€™s lien, is legal in nature.â€ Butler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC,&nbsp;369 S.C. 121, ___, 631 S.E.2d 252, 255&nbsp;(2006) (citing Willard v. Finch, 123 S.C. 56, 116 S.E.2d 96 (1923)). Â In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will be upheld on appeal when the findings are reasonably supported by the evidence. Â Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at ___, 631 S.E.2d at 255.Â  The trial courtâ€™s findings of fact will not be disturbed on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence or\r\nclearly influenced or controlled by an error of law. Â Id. at ___, 631 S.E.2d at 255-56. \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Credit for Payments to Other Subcontractors \r\nOwner argues that sections 29-5-20, 29-5-40, and 29-5-60 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) require the trial court to credit Owner for the settlement reached with Other Subcontractors before determining the amount owed Subcontractor.Â  Owner paid Other Subcontractors 66.6% of their claimed lien amounts and sought to limit any amount paid to Subcontractor to this same percentage.Â  At the time Owner settled with Other Subcontractors through mediation, Owner was aware of Subcontractorâ€™s outstanding lien. The trial court held that Subcontractor was not bound by the prorated limit in the settlement between Owner and Other Subcontractors.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 29-5-20(a) states:\r\n\r\nEvery laborer, mechanic, subcontractor, or person furnishing material for the improvement of real estate when the improvement has been authorized by the owner has a lien thereon, subject to existing liens of which he has actual or constructive notice, to the value of the labor or material so furnished, including the costs of the action and a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee which must be determined by the court in which the action is brought but only if the party seeking to enforce the lien prevails. If the party defending against the lien prevails, the defending party must be awarded costs of the action and a reasonable attorneyâ€™s fee as determined by the court. The fee and the court costs may not exceed the amount of the lien. The lien may be enforced as\r\nherein provided.\r\n\r\nAdditionally section 29-5-40 states:\r\n\r\nWhenever work is done or material is furnished for the improvement of real estate upon the employment of a contractor or some other person than the owner and such laborer, mechanic, contractor or materialman shall in writing notify the owner of the furnishing of such labor or material and the amount or value thereof, the lien given by Â§29-5-20 shall attach upon the real estate improved as against the true owner for the amount of the work done or material furnished. But in no event shall the aggregate amount of liens set up hereby exceed the amount due by the owner on the contract price of the improvement made.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nThe main purposes of sections 29-5-20 and 29-5-40 are (1) the protection through a lien of a party, who furnished labor or material but was not a party to a contract with the owner and (2) the protection of the owner by preventing his liability on the liens from exceeding the amount owner owes on the contract price.Â  Lowndes Hill Realty Co. v. Greenville Concrete Co., 229 S.C. 619, 629, 93 S.E.2d 855, 860 (1956).[1]Â  Subcontractor brought this action in order to enforce his lien after providing labor to Owner.Â  \r\nThe trial court adjusted the contract price to $2,461,510.00 based on change orders and back charges.Â  Owner paid General Contractor $2,166,613.00, and Owner settled with Other Subcontractors for $92,385.00, which leaves a difference of $202,512.00 between the contract price and the amount paid by Owner.Â  Subcontractorâ€™s lien is for $95,085.75.Â  Therefore, section 29-5-40 is not violated because the difference between the contract price and amount Owner already paid is greater than Subcontractorâ€™s lien amount.Â  \r\nSection 29-5-60(a) (Supp. 2005) imposes a duty on Owner to settle and states:Â  â€œIn the event the amount due the contractor by the owner is insufficient to pay all the lienors acquiring liens as herein provided it is the duty of the owner to prorate among all just claims the amount due the contractor.â€Â  When a lien attaches the subcontractor has a â€œjust claim.â€ Charleston Lumber Co., Inc. v. GPT, 303 S.C. 350, 353, 400 S.E.2d 508, 510 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  Â Subcontractor attached a lien for $95,085.75, which gave subcontractor a just claim.Â  \r\nSubcontractorâ€™s just claim creates a duty on Owner under section 29-5-60.Â  â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that words used in a statute should be given their plain and ordinary meaning unless something in the statute requires a different interpretation.â€Â  Seckinger v. Vessel Excalibur, 326 S.C. 382, 387, 483 S.E.2d 775, 777&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  A plain reading of section 29-5-60 requires an owner to prorate just claims when they exceed the amount due under the contract, but does not create a duty for the subcontractor to accept the prorated settlement.\r\nThe Mechanicâ€™s Lien statute (Section 29-5-60) does not credit owners who settle claims of non-perfected lien holders. Charleston Lumber, 303 S.C. at 353, 400 S.E.2d at 510.Â  In the same regard, the Mechanicâ€™s Lien statute does not contain a provision requiring Subcontractor to settle or be forced to receive a prorated judgment as long as the aggregate amount of the liens do not exceed the amount due by the owner on the contract price.Â  See Â§Â§ 29-5-20, 29-5-40, and 29-5-60.Â  Therefore, a trial court need only consider whether a prior settlement agreement decreases the ownerâ€™s contract liability to an amount smaller than the litigated lien. In this case, the settlement with Other Subcontractors did not decrease the remaining liability to a sum smaller than Subcontractorâ€™s lien.Â  Accordingly, the trial court properly determined that Subcontractorâ€™s lien was enforceable and did not violate South Carolina law.\r\nII.&nbsp; Consideration of Property Damages \r\nOwner argues the trial court should have considered damage to the developed building when it determined the adjusted contract price which was used to calculate Ownerâ€™s remaining liability to the General Contractor and, ultimately, to Subcontractor.[2]Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn a claim to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien, the trial courtâ€™s findings are not to be disturbed unless the findings are wholly unsupported by evidence. Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at ___, 631 S.E.2d at 255-56.Â  In this case, the trial court adjusted the contract price based on back charges and change orders.Â  The damages Owner feels the trial court should have considered concern the alleged improper installation of insulation resulting in $651,551.00 in mold damage to the building.Â  Owner sought to have this amount deducted from the adjusted contract price prior to determining its liability to Subcontractor.Â  The trial court excluded evidence regarding mold damage as inapplicable to this litigation holding â€œafter discovered negligence may not be asserted by way of off-set because it has not pled.â€Â  Because the damage was not discovered until after Ownerâ€™s pleading was submitted, the pleading obviously did not contain any reference to the damage.Â  Moreover, evidence exists in the record that General Contractor may not have caused the mold problem.Â  Ownerâ€™s own witness testified that he inspected the insulation after its installation and found no problems, and he further testified that he had no evidence that General Contractor was responsible for the faulty insulation.Â  The evidence in the record supports the trial courtâ€™s finding that mold damage was inapplicable to this matter.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s ruling on liquidated damages is affirmed.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Waiver \r\nOwner argues the trial court did not pay sufficient deference to Subcontractorâ€™s pay applications, which included a waiver and release of lien clause.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen a contract is unambiguous a court must construe its provisions according to the terms the parties used, understood in their plain, ordinary, and popular sense.â€Â  S.C. Farm Bureau Mutual Ins. Co. v. Oates, 356 S.C. 378, 381, 588 S.E.2d 643, 645&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  In this case, the waiver section of the payment application is titled â€œWAIVER AND RELEASE OF LIEN UPON PROGRESS PAYMENT,â€ and the waiver states Subcontractor agrees to waive and release its lien â€œin consideration of the progress payment.â€Â  The trial court found the waiver language in the payment application conditioned the waiver upon payment taking place.Â  It is undisputed that Subcontractor was not paid upon completion of the job.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s finding that Subcontractorâ€™s payment application included merely a conditioned waiver â€œto be held in trust pending paymentâ€ was supported by the evidence and shall not be disturbed. See Butler Contracting, 369 S.C. at __, 631 S.E.2d at 255-56.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Interest Rate \r\nOwner disputes the interest rate the trial court ordered Owner to pay Subcontractor because the interest rate exceeds the statutory limit, and Owner\r\nand Subcontractor did not contract for a higher interest rate.Â  We agree. \r\nSection 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) sets an interest rate for all cases in which money is found to be due.Â  The established pre-judgment legal interest rate for ascertainable sums of money is 8.75% per annum.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(A) (Supp. 2005).Â  The ascertained liquidated damages in this matter are $95,085.75.Â Â  Despite the existence of section 34-31-20, parties are free to agree to higher interest rates within legal limits.Â \r\nButler Contracting, 369 S.C. at __, 631 S.E.2d at 259.Â  The trial court ordered Owner to pay Subcontractor 1.5% per month (18% per annum) prejudgment interest beginning in December 1999, which exceeds the 8.75% statutory annual interest rate. Evidence exists in the record that General Contractor and Subcontractor contractually agreed to a higher interest rate of 1.5% per month.Â  However, Subcontractor and Owner did not contract for a higher interest rate.Â  Therefore, we find Owner is not bound by General Contractorâ€™s agreement with Subcontractor.Â  Accordingly, we remand for a determination of a pre-judgment interest rate consistent with section 34-31-20.[3]\r\nV.&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fees \r\nOwner contends that if this Court reverses some portion of the trial courtâ€™s order, then Subcontractor would not be the prevailing party and would not be entitled to attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 29-5-20 (A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides attorneysâ€™ fees for the prevailing party in an action to enforce a lien.Â \r\nIn an action to enforce a mechanicâ€™s lien, the prevailing party receives a favorable decision or verdict on liability. Seckinger, 326 S.C. at 388, 483 S.E.2d at 778. The award of attorneysâ€™ fees is left undisturbed absent abuse of the trial courtâ€™s discretion.Â  Patrick v. Britt, 364 S.C. 508, 514, 613 S.E.2d 541, 544 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Despite the remand for determination of an interest rate consistent with section 34-31-20, Subcontractor received a favorable verdict regarding liability.Â  Therefore, as the prevailing party, Subcontractor may be properly awarded attorneysâ€™ fees.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis court finds the trial court did not err in: 1) refusing to credit Owner for payments made to Other Subcontractors, 2) refusing to consider after discovered property damage in determining the adjusted contract price, 3) finding the waiver clause in the payment application was an unsatisfied conditional waiver, and 4) awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We find the trial court erred in its determination of a pre-judgment interest rate.Â  For the reasons stated herein, the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This cited case refers to sections 45-252 and 45-254 of the South Carolina Code.Â  These sections have since become sections 29-5-20 and 29-5-40, respectively.Â  \r\n[2] As per Â§ 29-5-40, Subcontractor could not claim a lien for an amount\r\nin excess of the amount still owed toÂ  the General Contractor under the contract.\r\n[3] Subcontractor disputes the preservation of Ownerâ€™s issue regarding the higher interest rate.Â  In Ownerâ€™s brief to the trial court, Owner disputes the use of 1.5% per month interest rate based on an agreement between General Contractor and Subcontractor.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order sets the interest rate as 1.5% per month.Â  Therefore the issue was preserved because it was raised before and ruled upon by the trial court. See Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 24, 531 S.E.2d 282, 284 (2000). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4195","title":"Rhoad v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Barbara R. Morgan, of Aiken, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  David Rhoad appeals the post-conviction relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s decision to hold him in contempt.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nRhoad was convicted of DUI and criminal domestic violence of a high and aggravated nature (CDVHAN) and sentenced to five years imprisonment.Â  Rhoad filed a PCR application, but he informed the PCR judge on the day of the hearing that he wished to withdraw his application.Â  After the judge accepted his withdrawal, Rhoad made an obscene gesture to his trial counsel before leaving the courtroom.Â  \r\nRhoad was brought back into the courtroom and questioned about his actions.Â  Rhoad first admitted he â€œmight have flipped [trial counsel] off,â€ but then he denied that he did it.Â  The judge took testimony from witnesses in the courtroom to confirm that Rhoad had in fact made an obscene gesture.Â  Rhoad then informed the judge of his frustration with his trial counsel, and he apologized to trial counsel and the judge.Â  The judge held Rhoad in contempt and sentenced him to one year imprisonment consecutive to his current sentence.Â  Rhoad then exclaimed to the judge, â€œF**k you, you bastard.â€Â  The judge held Rhoad in contempt for that statement and sentenced him to another year consecutive to Rhoadâ€™s current sentence.Â  \r\nOn his way out of the courtroom, Rhoad apparently fought with the deputies, and he was brought back in to be chastised by the judge.Â  Although Rhoad denied that he was fighting with the deputies, the judge warned him that he would receive â€œanother yearâ€ if Rhoad raised his voice again.Â  Despite ordering two consecutive, one-year sentences for contempt at the hearing, the orders signed by the judge imposed two, six-month sentences for contempt on Rhoad to be served consecutively to his prior sentences and consecutively to each other.Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Whetstone v. Whetstone, 309 S.C. 227, 233, 420 S.E.2d 877, 880-81 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  â€œThis court will reverse a trial courtâ€™s decision regarding contempt only if it is without evidentiary support or is an abuse of discretion.Â  An abuse of discretion can occur where the trial courtâ€™s ruling is based on an error of law.â€Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank v. First Citizens Bank &amp; Trust Co. of South Carolina, 346 S.C. 462, 466, 551 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2001) (citations omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Â Finding of Contempt\r\nRhoad argues the judge erred in holding him in contempt for â€œgesturingâ€ at trial counsel as he walked out of the courtroom because: Â he apologized; his â€œjuvenileâ€ conduct was not disruptive; the gesture was not directed at the court; and he was not previously warned that such conduct would be considered contemptuous.[2]Â  We disagree. \r\nInherent in all courts is the power to punish for contempt to preserve order and maintain decorum in judicial proceedings.Â  In re Diggs, 344 S.C. 434, 434, 544 S.E.2d 632, 632 (2001); Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840, 841 (1988) (â€œThe courtâ€™s power includes the ability to maintain order and decorum.â€). Â Contemptuous conduct in the presence of the court is direct contempt.Â  Brandt v. Gooding, 368 S.C. 618, 628, 630 S.E.2d 259, 264 (2006); State v. Kennerly, 337 S.C. 617, 620, 524 S.E.2d 837, 838 (1999).Â  â€œA person may be found guilty of direct contempt if his conduct interferes with judicial proceedings, exhibits disrespect for the court, or hampers parties or witnesses.â€Â  State v. Havelka, 285 S.C. 388, 389, 330 S.E.2d 288, 288 (1985). Â â€œDirect contempt that occurs in the courtâ€™s presence may be immediately adjudged and sanctioned summarily.â€Â  Brandt, 368 S.C. at 628, 630 S.E.2d at 264.Â  South Carolina courts have taken an expansive view of the â€œpresenceâ€ and â€œcourtâ€ requirements to encompass all elements of the judicial system, not just the mere physical presence of the judge or courtroom.Â  Kennerly, 337 S.C. at 620, 524 S.E.2d at 838.Â  \r\nThere is sufficient evidence in the record to support the judgeâ€™s finding of contempt for Rhoadâ€™s gesture.Â  Regardless of whether Rhoadâ€™s hearing had concluded, Rhoad failed to show proper decorum in the courtroom and exhibited a disrespect for the court so inherent that no warning of possible contempt was necessary.Â  It is irrelevant that the obscene gesture was not directed at the judge.Â  Despite Rhoadâ€™s argument that the â€œjuvenileâ€ gesture was not disruptive, the gesture interrupted courtroom proceedings and necessitated a hearing to address his actions.Â  Further, Rhoadâ€™s post-gesture apology did not change the fact that he failed to act with proper decorum in the presence of the judge.Â  Because there was sufficient evidence to support the judgeâ€™s finding of contempt for Rhoadâ€™s use of an obscene gesture, we find the judge did not abuse his discretion.\r\nII.Â  Entitlement to a Jury Trial\r\nRhoad argues that his two, one-year consecutive sentences for contempt should be vacated because he was entitled to a jury trial pursuant to Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506 (1974).Â  We disagree.\r\nAn accused is guaranteed the right of a speedy trial via the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.Â  Codispoti, 418 U.S. at 511.Â  Petty crimes can generally be tried without a jury trial, but serious crimes require a jury trial if the accused requests one.Â  Id.; Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 209-10 (1968).Â  Courts normally look to the maximum punishment assigned by the legislature in determining whether a sentence is serious or petty.Â  Lewis v. United States, 518 U.S. 322, 326 (1996). Â Crimes with punishments of six months or less are presumably â€œpetty,â€ while crimes with punishments greater than six months are presumably â€œserious.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhere the legislature fails to assign a maximum penalty, courts look to the â€œseverity of the penalty actually imposed as the measure of the character of the particular offense.â€Â  Lewis, 518 U.S. at 328; Codispoti, 418 U.S. at 511.Â  In noting the special concerns raised by criminal contempt matters, the Supreme Court has further noted that a jury trial is favorable in order to avoid the likelihood of arbitrary action by a judge in the potentially heated contempt context.Â  Lewis, 518 U.S. at 329.Â  Nevertheless, a contemnor may be tried without a jury under certain circumstances, as long as the sentence imposed is no longer than six months.Â  Codispoti, 418 U.S. at 514 (â€œUndoubtedly, where the necessity of circumstances warrants, a contemnor may be summarily tried for an act of contempt during trial and punished by a term of no more than six months.â€).\r\nThe South Carolina General Assembly has not assigned a maximum penalty for contempt in circuit court cases.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-5-320 (1976) (â€œThe circuit court may punish by fine or imprisonment, at the discretion of the court, all contempts of authority in any cause or hearing before the same.â€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-30 (2003) (â€œIn cases of legal conviction when no punishment is provided by statute the court shall award such sentence as is conformable to the common usage and practice in this State, according to the nature of the offense, and not repugnant to the Constitution.â€).Â  Because the legislature has not imposed a maximum sentence on contempt, we look to the sentence Rhoad actually received to determine whether it could be characterized as â€œpettyâ€ or â€œserious.â€Â  Although Rhoad complains about the two, one-year consecutive sentences that were orally pronounced at the contempt hearing, the judgeâ€™s final order actually imposed two consecutive sentences of six months.Â  The two consecutive six-month sentences are the equivalent of a one-year sentence.Â  Thus, the sentences were such that would normally entitle a defendant to a jury trial if he or she requested one.Â  See Codispoti, 418 U.S. at 516-17 (looking to the sentence actually imposed, the Supreme Court held that because the defendantâ€™s consecutive, six-month sentences on seven counts of contempt amounted to a sentence of greater than three years, he was tried for the equivalent of a serious offense and was entitled to a jury trial). \r\nNevertheless, we must affirm.Â  Rhoad cites Codispoti in arguing he was entitled to a jury trial.Â  However, the defendant in Codispoti requested, and was denied, a jury trial on his contempt charges.Â  Codispoti, 418 U.S. at 507-08.Â  Rhoad never requested a jury trial, and he never objected to the imposition of the contempt sentences without a jury trial.Â  Because Rhoad failed to request a jury trial and failed to object to the length of his sentence, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  State v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 462, 510 S.E.2d 423, 425 (1999) (holding that a sentence which exceeds the maximum allowable is not a question of subject matter jurisdiction; thus, unless an objection was made to the sentence at trial, the issue is not preserved for review); State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 216, 499 S.E.2d 209, 214 (1998) (holding that issues not raised to or ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved for appellate review).\r\nThus, although there may be merit to the question of whether Rhoad was entitled to a jury trial, Rhoad was obligated to bring that issue to the attention of the judge.Â  Because he failed to do so, we may not address it.Â  State v. Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 586, 611 S.E.2d 273, 283 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding that despite the fact that the defendant was sentenced to greater than six months for contempt without the benefit of a jury trial, defendant failed to object to the sentence and the issue was not preserved for appellate review), cert. denied (Sept. 7, 2006).[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe PCR judge did not abuse his discretion in holding Rhoad in contempt for making an obscene gesture at trial counsel at the end of the PCR hearing.Â  Rhoad did not appeal the finding of contempt for the profane outburst directed at the judge, and it is the law of the case.Â  Although Rhoad was entitled to a jury trial where the aggregate of his sentences for contempt exceeded six months, he did not request a jury trial nor did he object, and thus, that issue is not preserved for our review.Â  \r\nAccordingly, Rhoadâ€™s convictions and sentences for contempt are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  Rhoad does not complain about the finding of contempt for his profane outburst and admits in his brief that the outburst constituted classic contempt.Â  It is interesting to note that the gesture Rhoad used is commonly understood to have the same meaning as the words he used in his profane outburst.Â  In any event, because Rhoad failed to appeal the finding of contempt for the profane outburst, it is the law of the case.Â  State v. Sampson, 317 S.C. 423, 427, 454 S.E.2d 721, 723 (Ct. App. 1995) (holding that an unchallenged ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case).\r\n[3] We also note Rhoad complains that the oral sentences of one year on each count of contempt were unconstitutional and that the court erred by reducing them.Â  Judges are not bound by oral rulings and are free to issue written orders in conflict with prior oral rulings.Â  First Union Natâ€™l Bank of S.C. v. Hitman, Inc., 308 S.C. 421, 422, 418 S.E.2d 545, 545 (1992).Â  Until an order is written and entered, the judge is free to change his mind and amend prior rulings.Â  Ford v. State Ethics Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (â€œUntil written and entered, the trial judge retains the discretion to change his mind and amend his oral ruling accordingly.â€).Â  Because the final sentence imposed on each count of contempt was six months, there is no factual basis to support Rhoadâ€™s complaint regarding the consecutive one-year sentences.Â  Even if Rhoadâ€™s argument could be construed as a complaint that the two consecutive six-month sentences were unconstitutional, we have previously found Rhoadâ€™s failure to request a jury trial or to object to the sentence rendered this argument not preserved for appellate review.Â  Passmore, 363 S.C. at 586, 611 S.E.2d at 283.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4196","title":"State v.

White appeals his convictions for kidnapping and two counts of armed robbery on the grounds: (1) the trial court erred in admitting the testimony of Stateâ€™s expert witness, a dog handler, without establishing the underlying scientific reliability of dog tracking; and (2) newly discovered evidence entitles White to a new trial. Â We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the early morning hours of April 19, 2004, two men entered the Circle K Convenience Store on the corner of Garners Ferry Road and Old Woodlands Road in Columbia, South Carolina, where the store manager, Gwen Anthony (Anthony), was working the night shift.Â  One of the men, Gary White (White), wore a mask and carried a gun.Â  White approached Anthony, grasped her around her neck with his arm, and held the gun to her head.Â  The other man removed items from Anthonyâ€™s purse, emptied cash out of the register, and took lottery tickets along with an eighteen (18)-count case of beer.Â  White held Anthony with the gun to her head the entire time the other man moved through the store taking items.Â  However, at one point, Anthony suspected White had passed out for a few seconds, because his head fell onto her shoulder and the gun dropped.Â  She smelled alcohol on his breath.Â  While White dozed, Anthony had an opportunity to observe his clothes and to see the gun.Â  The other man shouted at him and White awoke.Â  As they exited the store, White forced Anthony outside, still holding her in his grip with the gun to her head.Â  \r\nWhite released Anthony and fled toward the east side of the store, following the other perpetrator in the direction of Old Woodlands Road.Â  At the same time, Officer Rouppasong drove into the Circle K parking lot, and Anthony alerted him to the fleeing robbers.Â  Officer Rouppasong saw one suspect running from the parking lot, pursued him, and called for back up. Â Following the suspect around the corner of the store, Rouppasong observed a parked vehicle with the headlights on.Â  The suspect he had seen running from the parking lot exited the car from the passenger side and ran into the neighborhood; the driver remained in the vehicle.Â  When his backup arrived Rouppasong approached the vehicle, apprehended the driver, and secured the car.Â  Items that were stolen from Anthony and the Circle K were found in the vehicle.Â  \r\nBack-up officers, including Officer Gunter of the K9 unit, arrived within several minutes.Â  Gunter began tracking with his dog approximately thirty minutes after the officers set up the perimeter. Â The tracking started from the location where the suspect ran from the passenger side of the vehicle and ended with the discovery of the suspect lying on the ground under some bushes.Â  The suspect was holding a gun but appeared to be asleep.\r\n The State moved to have Gunter qualified as an expert in K9 tracking.Â  Gunter testified he was a Senior Master K9 Handler, which is the highest level of K9 handling that can be acquired. Â Aurie, Gunterâ€™s dog, is a German shepherd descended from a working bloodline of known police and military dogs.Â  Gunter stated he trained with Aurie weekly, and they had probably run a total of 750 tracks throughout the dogâ€™s career.Â  Yearly, they met the standards to qualify with the American Association of K9 Trainers.Â  Gunter had been with the K9 unit for approximately fourteen years, and Aurie had been with Gunter for eight years, since he was a six-month-old puppy.Â  The dogâ€™s training was primarily for tracking lost or missing people, rather than for sniffing for drugs or other contraband. Â \r\nGunter confirmed he had been qualified previously as an expert witness in Richland County.Â  He professed that Aurie was very reliable.Â  The trial court found Gunter qualified as an expert in the field of K9 tracking and handling and instructed the jury that Gunter could offer opinions in his areas of expertise.Â  White objected to admission of dog tracking evidence on the ground it did not meet standards set forth in State v. Jones concerning scientific evidence, and it was not reliable, relevant, and helpful to the jury. \r\nThe jury found White guilty of the kidnapping and two armed robbery charges.Â  White then moved for a new trial on the ground the dog tracking testimony did not meet the reliability standard required.Â  The court denied the motion, finding Gunterâ€™s testimony admissible. Â White was sentenced to concurrent terms of life imprisonment without parole. Â \r\nDuring the pendency of this appeal, witness Anthony Morris issued a written statement retracting his trial testimony.Â  Subsequently, White moved for a new trial or, alternatively, for remand to the trial court for a hearing on newly discovered evidence. Â This court denied Whiteâ€™s motion. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only. State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006); State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 520, 608 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2004). Â We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous. Â State v. Quattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 527 S.E.2d 105 (2000); State v. Patterson, 367 S.C. 219, 625 S.E.2d 239 (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Landis, 362 S.C. 97, 606 S.E.2d 503 (Ct. App. 2004). Â This Court does not re-evaluate the facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence but simply determines whether the trial judgeâ€™s ruling is supported by any evidence. Â Wilson, 345 S.C. at 1, 545 S.E.2d at 827; State v. Mattison, 352 S.C. 577, 575 S.E.2d 852 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nOn appeal, we are limited to determining whether the trial judge abused his discretion. Â State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 626 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Walker, 366 S.C. 643, 623 S.E.2d 122 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion that is without evidentiary support. Â Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005); Renney v. Dobbs House, Inc., 275 S.C. 562, 274 S.E.2d 290 (1981); see also Simon v. Flowers, 231 S.C. 545, 550, 99 S.E.2d 391, 393-94 (1957) (â€œ â€˜[E]rror at lawâ€™ exists: (1) when the circuit judge, in issuing [the order], was controlled by some error of lawÂ  . . . or (2) where the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal, considerations, is without adequate evidentiary support.â€); McSween v. Windham, 77 S.C. 223, 226, 57 S.E. 847, 848 (1907) (â€œ[T]he determination of the court will not be interfered with, unless there is an abuse of discretion, or unless the exercise of discretion was controlled by some error of law.â€).Â  A trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admissibility of an expertâ€™s testimony constitutes an abuse of discretion when the ruling is manifestly arbitrary, unreasonable, or unfair. Â Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Admission of Expert Testimony\r\nWhite contends the trial court erred in admitting the Stateâ€™s expert witness testimony about dog tracking without requiring the State to establish the underlying reliability of dog tracking as a scientific or technical field.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA. Â Â Â Â  Qualification of Expert Witness \r\nThe qualification of an expert witness and the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony are matters within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion. Â Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005); State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990); State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 626 S.E.2d 59 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. pending; State v. Harris, 318 S.C. 178, 456 S.E.2d 433 (Ct. App. 1995); see also Prince v. Associated Petroleum Carriers, 262 S.C. 358, 365, 204 S.E.2d 575, 579 (1974) (â€œWhether a witness has qualified as an expert, and whether his opinion is admissible on a fact in issue, are matters resting largely in the discretion of the trial judge.â€). The trial courtâ€™s decision to admit expert testimony will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 596 S.E.2d 488 (2004); Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); State v. Grubbs, 353 S.C. 374, 577 S.E.2d 493 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Jenkins v. E.L. Long Motor Lines, Inc., 233 S.C. 87, 94, 103 S.E.2d 523, 527 (1958) (â€œIt was for the trial [c]ourt to say whether the inquiry was one upon which expert testimony was proper, and its ruling thereon will not be disturbed unless its [sic] appears that there has been an abuse of discretion.â€).\r\nTo warrant reversal based on the admission or exclusion of evidence, the complaining party must prove both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice. Â Vaught v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 623 S.E.2d 373 (2005); Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509; Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004). Â To show prejudice, there must be a reasonable probability that the juryâ€™s verdict was influenced by the challenged evidence or the lack thereof.Â  Fields, 363 S.C. at 26, 609 S.E.2d at 509.\r\nState v. Council inculcates the Bench and Bar as to the law extant in regard to admission of scientific evidence and expert testimony.Â  335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).Â  In 1993, the United States Supreme Court adopted new parameters for admissibility of expert testimony under Rules 702 and 703 in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579, 113 S. Ct. 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d 469 (1993).Â  The Daubert court declared:\r\n\r\n  Before scientific evidence is admitted, the trial judge must determine the evidence is relevant, reliable and helpful to the jury. Â The Court suggested four factors to consider in deciding reliability in scientific evidence cases: (1) scientific methodology; (2) peer review; (3) consideration of general acceptance; and (4) the rate of error of a particular technique.Â  \r\n\r\nCouncil, 335 S.C. at 19, 515 S.E.2d at 518 (citing Daubert, 509 U.S. at 579, 113 S. Ct. at 2786, 125 L.Ed.2d at 469). Â If the evidence is reliable and relevant, the trial judge should determine if the probative value of the evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Â Id. Â Accordingly, the South Carolina Supreme Court instructed that â€œ[w]hile this Court does not adopt Daubert, we find the proper analysis for determining admissibility of scientific evidence is now under the SCRE.â€ Â Council, 335 S.C. at 20, 515 S.E.2d at 518.Â  \r\nRule 702, SCRE, articulates the guidelines for admissibility of expert testimony in South Carolina.Â  â€œIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€ Â Rule 702, SCRE. Â There is no abuse of discretion as long as the witness has acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge. Â State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 495 S.E.2d 463 (Ct. App. 1997); State v. Goode, 305 S.C. 176, 406 S.E.2d 391 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  The test for qualification of an expert is a relative one that is dependent on the particular witnessâ€™s reference to the subject.Â  Wilson v. Rivers, 357 S.C. 447, 593 S.E.2d 603 (2004). Â For a court to find a witness competent to testify as an expert, the witness must be better qualified than the fact finder to form an opinion on the particular subject of the testimony. Â Ellis, 358 S.C. at 525, 595 S.E.2d at 825; Mizell v. Glover, 351 S.C. 392, 570 S.E.2d 176 (2002); Crawford v. Henderson, 356 S.C. 389, 589 S.E.2d 204 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 252-53, 487 S.E.2d 596, 598 (1997) (â€œTo be considered competent to testify as an expert, â€˜a witness must have acquired by reason of study or experience or both such knowledge and skill in a profession or science that he is better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of his testimony.â€™ â€).Â  An expert is not limited to any class of persons acting professionally.Â  Gooding, 326 S.C. at 253, 487 S.E.2d at 598; Thomas Sand Co. v. Colonial Pipeline Co., 349 S.C. 402, 563 S.E.2d 109 (Ct. App. 2002). Â There is no exact requirement concerning how knowledge or skill must be acquired. Â Honea v. Prior, 295 S.C. 526, 369 S.E.2d 846 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThe party offering the expert testimony has the burden of showing the witness possesses the necessary learning, skill, or practical experience to enable the witness to give opinion testimony. Â State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996); State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993); Henry, 329 S.C. at 274, 495 S.E.2d at 466.Â  Generally, however, defects in the amount and quality of the expertâ€™s education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the expertâ€™s testimony and not to its admissibility.Â  Id.; see also Brown v. Carolina Emergency Physicians, P.A., 348 S.C. 569, 580, 560 S.E.2d 624, 629 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œAny defect in the education or experience of an expert affects the weight and not the admissibility of the expertâ€™s testimony.â€).\r\nThe admissibility of scientific evidence is dependent on â€œthe degree to which the trier of fact must accept, on faith, scientific hypotheses not capable of proof or disproof in court and not even generally accepted outside the courtroom.â€ Â State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 731, 259 S.E.2d 120, 124 (1979) (citing People v. Marx, 54 Cal. App. 3d 100 (1975). Â This standard is designed to prevent the fact finders from being misled by the aura of infallibility surrounding unproven scientific methods. Â State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 485 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1997). Â In considering the admissibility of scientific evidence under the Jones standard, the court looks at several factors, including: (1) the publications and peer review of the technique; (2) prior application of the method to the type of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control procedures used to ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency of the method with recognized scientific laws and procedures. Â Council, 335 S.C. at 19, 515 S.E.2d at 517 (citing State v. Ford, 301 S.C. 485, 392 S.E.2d 781 (1990). Â \r\nHowever, not all expert testimony is subject to a Jones analysis. Â State v. Douglas, 367 S.C. 498, 510, 626 S.E.2d 59, 65 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991). Â In Whaley, the court distinguished an expertâ€™s testimony that explained certain human behaviors from â€œâ€˜scientificâ€™ evidence, such as DNA test results, blood spatter interpretation, and bite mark comparisons.â€ Â Whaley, 305 S.C. at 142, 406 S.E.2d at 371. Â The expertâ€™s testimony in Whaley was not based on a scientific technique, but on his knowledge, skill, experience, and training as a psychologist.Â  The court emphasized: â€œ[w]here the witness is a qualified psychologist who simply explains how certain aspects of every day experience shown by the record can affect human perception and memory, and through them, the accuracy of eyewitness identification, we see no reason to require a greater foundation.â€Â  Id. at 142, 406 S.E.2d at 371-72. Â Therefore, â€œ[i]f the expertâ€™s opinion does not fall within Jones, questions about the reliability of an expertâ€™s methods go only to the weight, but not admissibility, of the testimony.â€ Â Morgan, 326 S.C. at 513, 485 S.E.2d at 118. Â A trial courtâ€™s threshold inquiry is whether the expertâ€™s methods and techniques even fall within Jonesâ€™ central purpose: to prevent the aura of infallibility which surrounds â€œscientific hypotheses not capable of proof or disproof in court and not even generally accepted outside the courtroomâ€ from misleading the fact finders. Â Id. (citing Jones, 273 S.C. at 731, 259 S.E.2d at 124). Â \r\nB. Â Â Â Â  Recognized Areas of Expertise in South Carolina\r\nSouth Carolina recognizes many areas in which an expert â€œhas acquired by study or practical experience such knowledge of the subject matter of his testimony as would enable him to give guidance and assistance to the jury in resolving a factual issue which is beyond the scope of the juryâ€™s good judgment and common knowledge.â€ Â Douglas, 367 S.C. at 510-11, 626 S.E.2d at 65 (quoting State v. Henry, 329 S.C. 266, 273, 495 S.E.2d 463, 466 (Ct. App. 1997) and citing Fields v. Regional Med. Ctr. Orangeburg, 363 S.C. 19, 609 S.E.2d 506 (2005); Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 595 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. App. 2004); Burroughs v. Worsham, 352 S.C. 382, 574 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 2002); Means v. Gates, 348 S.C. 161, 558 S.E.2d 921 (Ct. App. 2001); Small v. Pioneer Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997)).\r\nThe significance of expert testimony in assisting or guiding the trier of fact in criminal cases is well established.Â  See, e.g., Douglas, 367 S.C. at 511, 626 S.E.2d at 66 (citing State v. Ellis, 345 S.C. 175, 547 S.E.2d 490 (2001) (clarifying that while police officer may testify as expert in crime scene processing and fingerprint identification, he may not testify to ultimate issue as to whether defendant acted in self-defense); State v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 471 S.E.2d 689 (1996) (upholding trial courtâ€™s decision to allow forensic pathologist to testify, during sentencing, about the amount of pain victim suffered); State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991) (finding eyewitness identification expert qualified); State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 391 S.E.2d 551 (1990) (allowing expert in blood spatter interpretation to testify).\r\nSouth Carolina courts have repeatedly acknowledged dog handling as an area of expertise in the criminal context. Â â€œTestimony of a dog handler based upon his observation of a tracking dog may be properly admitted into evidence.â€Â  State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 127, 410 S.E.2d 547, 552 (1991). Â A foundation for the admission of dog tracking evidence is sufficient if itÂ  Â provides evidence as to (1) the extent of the handlerâ€™s experience and training; (2) the dogâ€™s characteristics of scent acuity and power to discriminate between human and other scents; and (3) the handlerâ€™s assessment of the dogâ€™s reliability. Â See State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 477, Â 385 S.E.2d 839, 843 (1989) (qualifying a bloodhound handler as an expert witness based on the handlerâ€™s experience and the scent dogâ€™s ability and reliability); see also State v. Jordan, 258 S.C. 340, 346, 188 S.E.2d 780, 784 (1972) (â€œ[A] ppellant concedes that the action of bloodhounds which were placed on the supposed track of the offender is admissible as evidence provided that the dogs are allowed to follow their instincts free and untrampled by their handlers.â€); State v. Bostick, 253 S.C. 205, 207-08, 169 S.E.2d 608, 609 (1969) (finding challenge to dog handlerâ€™s testimony on bloodhoundsâ€™ conduct on the ground it â€œviolated appellantâ€™s right to be confronted by the witnesses against himâ€ was without merit; the handler was the witness, not the dog.); State v. Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 88 S.E. 21, (1916) (instructing that the conduct of dogs is only a circumstance to be weighed with other circumstances).\r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Other Jurisdictions\r\n1.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Admissibility of Dog Tracking Evidence\r\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court articulated the foundational requirements adopted in majority of jurisdictions for the admission of dog tracking evidence in State v. Taylor,Â  337 N.C. 597 (1994). Â The court announced evidence of bloodhoundsâ€™ actions was admissible when:\r\n\r\n  (1) they are of pure blood, and of a stock characterized by acuteness of scent and power of discrimination; (2) . . . they possess these qualities, and have been accustomed and trained to pursue the human track; (3) . . . they have been found by experience reliable in such pursuit; [and] (4) . . . they were put on the trail of the guilty party, which was pursued and followed under such circumstances and in such way as to afford substantial assurance, or permit a reasonable inference, of identification. \r\n\r\nId. at 609.Â  Though foundational requirements vary somewhat among jurisdictions, an overwhelming number allow admission of dog tracking evidence in a criminal case to prove identity.Â  State v. Cole, 695 A.2d 1180 (Me. 1997); accord Gavin v. State, 891 So. 2d 907 (Ala. Crim. App. 2003); Wilkie v. State, 715 P.2d 1199 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986); State v. Coleman, 593 P.2d 684 (Ariz. Ct.

App. 1984); State v. Bourassa, 399 A.2d 507 (Vt. 1979); Pelletier v. Com., 592 S.E.2d 382 (Va. Ct. App. 2004); State v. Nicholas, 663 P.2d 1356 (Wash. Ct. App. 1983); State v. Broughton, 470 S.E.2d 413 (W. Va. 1996). \r\nMost jurisdictions find a sufficient foundation for the admission of dog- tracking evidence is established if (1) the evidence shows the dog was of a breed characterized by an acute power of scent; (2) the dog was trained to follow a trail by scent; (3) by experience the dog was found to be reliable; (4) the dog was placed on the trail where the defendant was known to have been within a reasonable time; and (5) the trail was not otherwise contaminated. Â See Jay M. Zitter, Annotation, Evidence of Trailing by Dogs in Criminal Cases, 81 A.L.R.5th 563 (2006).Â  However, many jurisdictions regard dog tracking evidence alone as legally insufficient and require corroborating evidence to prove identification. Â See, e.g., People v. Gonzales, 267 Cal. Rptr. 138, 142 (Cal. Ct. App. 1990) (â€œa conviction cannot rest on dog tracking evidence aloneâ€); People v. Stone, 491 N.W.2d 628, 630 (Mich. Ct. App. 1992) (â€œTracking-dog evidence is admissible only after certain foundational requirements are met. Â In addition, there must be other corroborating evidence presented before identification based on tracking-dog evidence is sufficient to support a guilty verdict.â€)Â  State v. Loucks, 656 P.2d 480, 482 (Wash. 1983) (â€œThe dangers inherent in the use of dog tracking evidence can only be alleviated by the presence of corroborating evidence identifying the accused as the perpetrator of the crime.â€).Â  Additionally, a number of jurisdictions require the trial court to instruct the jury to view dog tracking evidence with caution. Â See People v. Gangler, 643 N.Y.S.2d 839, 840 (N.Y. App. Div. 1996) (â€œ[T]racking evidence is admissible on the issue of identity if the proper foundation is laid and if the jury is given cautionary instructions.â€); accord Wilkie v. State, 715 P.2d 1199, n. 3 (Alaska Ct. App. 1986); People v. McMillen, 336 N.W.2d 895 (Mich. 1983); State v. Taylor, 395 A.2d 505 (N.H. 1978).\r\nSeveral jurisdictions find dog tracking evidence inadmissible under any circumstances. Â See People v. McDonald, 749 N.E.2d 1066 (Ill. App. Ct. 2001); Brafford v. State, 516 N.E.2d 45 (Ind. 1987); State v. Storm, 238 P.2d 1161 (Mont. 1951); Brott v. State, 97 N.W. 593 (Neb. 1903).Â  These courts object to dog tracking evidence on the following grounds:Â  (1) the actions of the bloodhounds are unreliable; (2) the evidence constitutes hearsay; (3) the defendant is deprived of his constitutional right to confront the witnesses against him; (4) the defendant should not be placed in jeopardy by the actions of an animal; (5) a defendant cannot cross-examine the dogs; and (6) a jury might be awed by such testimony and give it much greater weight and importance than warranted. Â People v. Centolella, 305 N.Y.S.2d 279, 281-82 (N.Y. Cty. Cl. 1969).Â  In response to these arguments, the Centolella court explained: \r\n\r\n  [S]uch evidence falls into the category of opinion evidence rather than hearsay . . . the animals are not witnesses against a defendant any more than is a microscope or a spectrograph . . . Â these machines are not subject to crossâ€“examination any more than the animal, and . . . a person is no more placed in jeopardy by the action of an animal than he or she is by a breath analyzer or a blood test.\r\n\r\nId.Â  The court added the alleged undue importance a jury might attribute to the animal evidence can be minimized by cautionary instructions from the trial judge.Â  Id.\r\n2.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Scientific Evidence versus Experience-Based Knowledge\r\nIn applying standards for admissibility, a number of courts differentiate between a dog handlerâ€™s expert opinion based on experience-based knowledge and an expert opinion based on scientific evidence that requires a Daubert analysis.Â  The Virginia Appellate Court held empirical evidence provided by a K9 officer sufficiently established a dogâ€™s reliability without requiring evidence of a scientific basis for the dogâ€™s ability to track a scent.Â  Pelletier v. Com., 592 S.E.2d 382, 388 (Va. Ct. App. 2004).Â  The court emphasized:Â  â€œAn expertâ€™s testimony is admissible not only when scientific knowledge is required, but when experience and observation in a special calling give the expert knowledge of a subject beyond common intelligence and ordinary experience.â€Â  Id.Â  For instance, â€œthe typical police officer qualifies as an expert based on his experience with narcotics, not on his ability to explain the scientific theory behind his opinion.â€Â  Id. \r\n The Colorado Supreme Court ruled â€œdog scent trailing evidenceâ€ was admissibleâ€ if foundational requirements were satisfied, and â€œneither the Frye nor Daubert standards of general acceptance or scientific reliability applied.â€Â  Brooks v. People, 975 P.2d 1105, 1111 (Colo. 1999).Â  Distinguishing between scientific knowledge based on the scientific method and experience-based, specialized knowledge, the court declined to apply factors designed to ascertain scientific validity in analyzing dog tracking evidence.Â  Id. at 1113.Â  â€œ[W]e hold that testimony pertaining to scent tracking by a trained police dog is not readily subjected to standards which were not designed with experience-based specialized knowledge in mind.â€ Â Id. at 1115.Â  The court further reasoned the proper analysis of reliability in dog tracking cases was based on Rule 702 of the Colorado Rules of Evidence (CRE) admissibility standards. \r\nIn State v. Bourassa, 399 A.2d 507 (Vt. 1979), the Vermont Supreme Court dismissed a defendantâ€™s contention that dog tracking testimony was inadmissible because the scientific principles underlying such testimony were not established in the record.Â  The court held evidence in the record was sufficient to find that a â€œwell trained dog, supervised by an experienced handler and working under reasonable conditions, is capable of trailing a human being accurately.â€ Id. at 510.Â  Agreeing with the majority of jurisdictions, the court concluded the foundation sufficiently established that: (1) the handler was qualified to use the dog; (2) the dog was trained and accurate in tracking humans; (3) the dog was placed on the trail where circumstances indicate that the accused had been; and (4) the trail had not become so stale or contaminated that it was beyond the dogâ€™s tracking capabilities. Â Id. at 511;Â  accord Reisch v. State, 628 A.2d 84 (Del. 1993) (deciding scientific testing not required to support evidence obtained by a dog if foundational requirements are met); People v. Roraback, 662 N.Y.S.2d 327 (N.Y. App. Div. 1997) (holding the use of a trained dog is an investigative rather than scientific procedure); Winston v. State, 78 S.W.3d 522, 526 (Tex. Ct. App. 2002) (finding interpretation of a dogâ€™s reaction to a scent lineup is based upon training and experience, and not on scientific methodology). \r\nD. Â Â Â Â  The Extant Factual Record\r\nThe underlying rationale in Pelletier, Brooks, and Bourassa comports with our Supreme Courtâ€™s analysis in State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991).Â  The Whaley courtâ€™s distinction between scientific evidence requiring a Jones analysis and expert testimony based on specialized knowledge and experience is equally applicable in the instant case.Â  \r\nGunterâ€™s testimony established the proper foundation under State v. Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 477, 385 S.E.2d 839, 843 (1989) for admitting his opinion as to the reliability of dog tracking evidence.Â  The officer had been with the Columbia Police Department for nearly fourteen years, working as a K9 handler and trainer.Â  He had attained the rank of Senior Master K9 Handler and assisted with the training of other K9 handlers and dogs in the department. Â Initially, Gunter trained with the Columbia Police Department in 1991.Â  He holds a membership in the American Association of K9 Trainers and maintains his certification by attending week-long training sessions annually. Â Additionally, while his dog, Aurie, was in service, he trained weekly with the K9 unit of the Columbia Police Department. Â Gunterâ€™s partnership with Aurie lasted over seven years, the entire duration of the dogâ€™s career.Â  During that time the team engaged in approximately 750 tracking excursions.Â  \r\nGunter opined that Aurie was â€œvery reliable.â€Â  The dog was a German shepherd, who had descended from a bloodline of known police and militaryÂ Â  working dogs.Â  He was certified in tracking, article searches, building searches, protection, and obedience.Â  However, Gunter emphasized Aurieâ€™s strongest skill was tracking people.Â  \r\nWhite advanced his objection to the admission of the dog tracking evidence on the ground it was not scientifically reliable and did not meet the standards set forth in State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120, (1979) concerning scientific evidence.Â  Addressing Whiteâ€™s challenge outside of the juryâ€™s presence, the trial judge explained:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    The Court:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Well, you know, not all expert testimony deals with scientific evidence.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    White&rsquo;s Counsel:\r\n    Yes, sir.&nbsp; We do understand but we do feel that if they are using it, they are qualifying his as an expert if he&mdash;the evidence should meet the standards of scientific evidence, your honor.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n     The Court:&nbsp;\r\n    Well, even if it&rsquo;s not a scientific evidence that they are offering?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    White&rsquo;s Counsel: \r\n    Your Honor, any evidence he is offering as an expert&mdash;\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    The Court:&nbsp;\r\n    Well, expert is scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge.&nbsp; Doesn&rsquo;t have to be scientific or technical. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the trial court ruled Gunter could offer his opinion testimony as to the reliability of what tracking dogs do provided the State laid the proper foundation.Â  Based on testimony about the extent of Gunterâ€™s training and experience, Aurieâ€™s acuity and skill in tracking human scent, and Gunterâ€™s assessment of Aurieâ€™s reliability, the trial court instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n  Iâ€™m going to find the officer qualified as an expert in the field of K9 tracking and handling with respect to his dog and the dogs in general.Â  Ladies and gentlemen, if scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist you, the trier of fact, in understanding any issue that isâ€”any fact thatâ€™s in issue or any evidence that may be an issue, then a person who is qualified by virtue of his or her knowledge, skill, experience, training or education may be qualified as an expert in that particular field. \r\n  Iâ€™m going to find the officer to be qualified as I said in the area of animal or dog tracking and handling, and as such he can offer opinions in his area of expertise.\r\n  Now, you are to give his testimony such weight and credibility as you deem appropriate as you will with any and all witnesses that will testify in this trial.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nGunterâ€™s testimony verified he had acquired, by training and experience, such knowledge and skill in the area of dog handling and tracking that rendered him better qualified than the jury to form an opinion on the particular subject of dog tracking. Â Furthermore, Gunterâ€™s testimony was based on his specialized knowledge, skill, and experience in the use of a scent-tracking dog, rather than on the validity of dog tracking as a scientific procedure. Â The nature of Gunterâ€™s testimony is analogous to that offered by a typical police officer who qualifies as an expert based on his experience with narcotics, not on his ability to explain the scientific theory behind his opinion.Â  As such, the evidence Gunter provided complies with Rule 702, SCRE by helping the jury understand the evidence or resolve a factual issue. Â As the Whaley court indicated, when a proper foundation is established, a Jones analysis is not warranted if expert testimony is based on specialized skill or knowledge rather than on scientific techniques. Â See State Â v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138, 406 S.E.2d 369 (1991).Â  Furthermore, the trial court cautioned the jury that questions about the reliability of Gunterâ€™s methods go only to the weight of his testimony, not the admissibility.Â  See State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 485 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\nE.Â Â Â Â Â  Harmless Error\r\nThough we discern no error in the trial courtâ€™s qualification of Gunter as an expert witness, the admission of his opinion testimony, if error, was harmless.Â  Pursuant to Rule 103, SCRE, â€œ[e]rror may not be predicated upon a ruling which admits or excludes evidence unless a substantial right of the party is affected . . . .â€\r\nNo definite rule of law governs finding an error harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 454-55, 602 S.E.2d 62, 73 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing State v. Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 391 S.E.2d 241 (1990); State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 336 S.E.2d 150 (1985); State v. Curry, 370 S.C. 674, 636 S.E.2d 649 (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004)). Â Whether an error is harmless depends on the particular facts of each case, including:\r\n\r\n  the importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and of course the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.\r\n\r\nState v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 333, 563 S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (2002) (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684, 106 S. Ct. 1431, 89 L.Ed.2d 674 (1986)).\r\nâ€œHarmless beyond a reasonable doubtâ€ means the reviewing court can conclude the error did not contribute to the verdict beyond a reasonable doubt. Â Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319; Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 420 S.E.2d 834 (1992). Â â€œIn determining whether an error is harmless, the reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.â€ Â Mizzell, 349 S.C. at 334, 563 S.E.2d at 319 (internal quotations omitted).\r\nError is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial. Â In re Harvey, 355 S.C. 53, 584 S.E.2d 893 (2003); Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151; State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605, 486 S.E.2d 762 (Ct. App. 1997). Â Generally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result. Â State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 399 S.E.2d 595 (1991); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003). Â Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached. Â State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989); Adams, 354 S.C. at 381, 580 S.E.2d at 795; see also State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002) (holding assistant solicitorâ€™s improper comment, during closing argument was harmless error, where evidence of guilt was overwhelming) overruled on other grounds; State v. Kelley, 319 S.C. 173, 460 S.E.2d 368 (1995) (noting that when guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached, this court will not set aside conviction for insubstantial errors not affecting result). \r\nAmple evidence linked White to the crimes charged.Â  The testimonies of the victim, Gwen Anthony, and co-defendant, Anthony Morris, were corroborated by a surveillance videotape that recorded the crime as it unfolded.Â  In addition, Roy Wiggins, the driver of the escape car, testified against White.Â  Items taken from the crime scene were located in the escape vehicle.Â  Officer Rouppasong witnessed a man carrying something in his hand and wearing dark jeans and a white shirt run from the Circle K parking lot.Â  In pursuit, the officer lost sight of the man briefly and then came upon the escape car.Â  The same man wearing the dark jeans and white shirt ran from the escape car toward the yard of the residence where White was eventually found.Â  Gunter put his tracking dog on the scent at the location where the man exited the vehicle.Â  The area in which the dog began tracking had been secured in order to preserve evidence.Â  The dogâ€™s tracks led to the location where White was discovered.Â  He appeared to be asleep and was clutching a gun in his hand.Â  The gun matched Anthonyâ€™s description of the weapon the robber carried, and both Morris and Wiggins positively identified it as the gun White had in his possession immediately prior to the robbery.Â  \r\nThe evidentiary record reflects other substantial evidence of Whiteâ€™s guilt without the inclusion of Gunterâ€™s testimony.Â  Consequently, the admission of the dog tracking evidence was cumulative and harmless.Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â  Newly Discovered Evidence\r\nWhite claims newly discovered evidence entitles him to a new trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAfter White served his notice of appeal, co-defendant Anthony Morris issued a written statement retracting his trial testimony against White.Â  Morris claimed he was not at the scene of the crime.Â  In a motion to this court, White urged that we either remand the case for a new trial or remand the case to the trial court for a hearing on the purported new evidence.Â  The State opposed and this court denied the motion. Â The State argues this court should not consider Morrisâ€™ statement because it has not been raised to and ruled on by the trial court and is not properly before this court.Â  We agree. \r\nRule 29(b), SCRCrimP, governs post trial motions on after discovered evidence.Â  A motion for a new trial based on after discovered evidence may not be made while the case is on appeal unless the appellate court exercises its discretionary authority, suspends the appeal, and grants leave to proceed in the circuit court.Â  The lack of a ruling from the trial court presents nothing for this courtâ€™s review.Â  \r\nFurthermore, a brief must reference the Record on Appeal to support the facts alleged.Â  Rule 207(b)(4), SCACR.Â  â€œThe Record shall not, however, include matter which was not presented to the lower court or tribunal.â€Â  Rule 210(c), SCACR.Â  Morrisâ€™ statement was not presented to the lower court and cannot be properly included in the Record on Appeal.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe rule that dog tracking evidence is recognized in South Carolina.Â  We hold that dog tracking evidence is not required to meet the scientific evidence standard articulated in State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120, (1979).Â  We conclude that dog tracking evidence is admissible provided the dog handlerâ€™s knowledge, skill, experience, and training qualifies the handler in the area of dog handling and dog tracking.Â  In the case sub judice, Gunterâ€™s specialized knowledge, skill, experience, and training qualified him to offer his opinion in the area of dog handling and dog tracking.Â  Luculently, the testimony of Gunter complies with expert testimony law extant in South Carolina.Â  \r\nThere is no error in the trial courtâ€™s qualification of Gunter as an expert witness and the admission of his opinion testimony.Â  Assumptively concluding that error exists, the error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  There is overwhelming evidence in the trial record without the inclusion or consideration of Gunterâ€™s testimony to support the convictions of the Appellant.\r\nThe Appellantâ€™s claim as to the right to a new trial based on newly discovered evidence is dismissed based on procedural grounds. \r\nAccordingly, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCARC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4197","title":"Barton v.

Wilson, both of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation case, the South Carolina Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund (the Fund) appeals the finding of the Appellate Panel of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission that the contractor was entitled to transfer liability to the Fund under section 42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) because the contractor collected documentation of its subcontractorâ€™s insurance on â€œa standard form acceptable to the commission.â€Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nWilliam Higgs, doing business as Iyanel Enterprises (Iyanel), served as the roofing subcontractor for Total Home Exteriors, Inc. (Total Home) for nine years.Â  One of the jobs Iyanel worked on for Total Home was in the Keowee Keys subdivision in Seneca.Â  Iyanel paid for insurance coverage through Jackie Perry Insurance Agency in Anderson and received an unsigned Certificate of Insurance evidencing workersâ€™ compensation and employerâ€™s liability insurance for September 13, 2003 through September 13, 2004.Â  When Iyanel was initially engaged to perform the work at Keowee Keys, it presented Total Home with the Certificate of Insurance. Â The record indicates Iyanel paid for the insurance and an employee of the Jackie Perry agency issued Certificates of Insurance without coverage being bound.Â  \r\nDavid Barton, an employee of Iyanel, was injured when he fell from a roof at the Keowee Keys job and as a result, filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim.Â  At the time of the accident, despite Iyanelâ€™s belief to the contrary, the business did not have workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  The single commissioner found Barton had suffered a compensable injury and that Total Home was a statutory employer liable for compensation under section 42-1-410 of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  The single commissioner further found that under section 42-1-415, Total Home had no ultimate liability because it relied in good faith on Iyanelâ€™s Certificate of Insurance and transferred responsibility for the workersâ€™ compensation benefits to the Fund.Â  \r\nThe Fund appealed to the Appellate Panel, which affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s order and incorporated it by reference.Â  On appeal, the circuit court affirmed the Appellate Panel.[2]Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard for judicial review of decisions by the Appellate Panel.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Hargrove v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 288, 599 S.E.2d 604, 610 (Ct. App. 2004); Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 516, 526 S.E.2d 725, 728 (Ct. App. 2000). Â Under the scope of review established in the APA, this court may not substitute its judgment for that of the Appellate Panel as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law. Â Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., 357 S.C. 520, 527, 593 S.E.2d 491, 495 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nThe substantial evidence rule governs the standard of review in a workersâ€™ compensation decision. Â Frame, 357 S.C. at 527, 593 S.E.2d at 494. Â The Appellate Panelâ€™s decision must be affirmed if supported by substantial evidence in the record.Â  Shuler v. Gregory Elec., 366 S.C. 435, 440, 622 S.E.2d 569, 571 (Ct. App. 2005) (citing Sharpe v. Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 160, 519 S.E.2d 102, 105 (1999)).Â  An appellate court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced because the decision is affected by an error of law or is â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); Â Bursey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\n\r\n  â€œSubstantial evidenceâ€ is not a mere scintilla of evidence nor the evidence viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its action.\r\n\r\nLark, 276 S.C. at 135, 276 S.E.2d at 306; see also Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 623, 594 S.E.2d 272, 274 (2004); Jones v. Ga.-Pac. Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 417, 586 S.E.2d 111, 113 (2003); Etheredge v. Monsanto Co., 349 S.C. 451, 456, 562 S.E.2d 679, 681-82 (Ct. App. 2002); Broughton v. S. of the Border, 336 S.C. 488, 495, 520 S.E.2d 634, 637 (Ct. App. 1999). Â \r\nâ€œ[T]he possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an administrative agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Palmetto Alliance, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 282 S.C. 430, 432, 319 S.E.2d 695, 696 (1984); see also Sharpe, 336 S.C. at 160, 519 S.E.2d at 105; DuRant v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 361 S.C. 416, 420, 604 S.E.2d 704, 707 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 618, 571 S.E.2d 92, 95 (Ct. App. 2002); Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 S.C. 266, 282, 519 S.E.2d 583, 591 (Ct. App. 1999). Â Where the evidence is conflicting over a factual issue, the findings of the Appellate Panel are conclusive. Â Hargrove, 360 S.C. at 290, 599 S.E.2d at 611; Etheredge, 349 S.C. at 455, 562 S.E.2d at 681.Â  In workersâ€™ compensation cases, the Appellate Panel is the ultimate finder of fact.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 455, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000); Bass v. Isochem, 365 S.C. 454, 468, 617 S.E.2d 369, 376 (Ct. App. 2005); Muir, 336 S.C. at 282, 519 S.E.2d at 591. Â â€œThe final determination of witness credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel.â€ Â Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495 (citing Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000); Parsons v. Georgetown Steel, 318 S.C. 63, 456 S.E.2d 366 (1995); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729). Â The findings of an administrative agency are presumed correct and will be set aside only if unsupported by substantial evidence. Â Anderson v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 492, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 48, 515 S.E.2d 532, 533 (1999). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Fund argues the circuit court erred in affirming the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding Total Home was entitled to transfer liability to the Fund under section 42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  The Fund contends that because the certificate Iyanel presented to Total Home was unsigned, Total Home failed to comply with all the statutory provisions.Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 42-1-415 provides:\r\n\r\n  (A) Notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon the submission of documentation to the commission that a . . . subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier . . . contractor . . . as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work, the higher tier . . . contractor . . . must be relieved of any and all liability under this title except as specifically provided in this section. Â In the event that employer is uninsured, regardless of the number of employees that employer has, the higher tier . . . contractor . . . or his insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay all benefits due under this title. Â The higher tier . . . contractor . . . or his insurance carrier may petition the commission to transfer responsibility for continuing compensation and benefits to the Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund. Â The Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund shall assume responsibility for claims within thirty days of a determination of responsibility made by the commission. Â The higher tier . . . contractor . . . must be reimbursed from the Uninsured Employersâ€™ Fund as created by Section 42-7-200 for compensation and medical benefits as may be determined by the commission. Â Any disputes arising as a result of claims filed under this section must be determined by the commission.\r\n   (B) To qualify for reimbursement under this section, the higher tier . . . contractor . . . must collect documentation of insurance as provided in subsection (A) on a standard form acceptable to the commission. Â The documentation must be collected at the time the contractor or subcontractor is engaged to perform work and must be turned over to the commission at the time a claim is filed by the injured employee.\r\n\r\nâ€œUnder subsection 42-1-415(A), a statutory employer . . . may transfer liability to the fund when a subcontractorâ€™s employee is injured if the statutory employer submits documentation to the fund that the subcontractor has represented himself as having workersâ€™ compensation coverage â€˜at the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work.â€™â€Â  S.C. Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 471, 602 S.E.2d 81, 82 (Ct. App. 2004); see also Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 330, 523 S.E.2d 766, 774-75 (1999) (noting that pursuant to section 42-1-415(A), â€œa statutory employer is no longer directly liable for workersâ€™ compensation payments whenever documentation is presented to the commission that a contractor or subcontractor represented himself to the statutory employer as having workersâ€™ compensation insuranceâ€).Â  \r\nTotal Home met all of the statutory requirements to transfer liability: Â (1) a subcontractor, Iyanel, represented to Total Home, a higher tier contractor, that it had workersâ€™ compensation insurance at the time it was engaged to perform work; and (2) Total Home collected documentation of insurance on a standard form acceptable to the commission at the time Iyanel was engaged to perform work.Â  The Fundâ€™s sole contention is that because the Certificate of Insurance was unsigned, Total Home does not meet the statutory requirement for documentation of insurance.Â  However, the statute does not require a signed Certificate of Insurance.Â  It merely states, â€œa standard form acceptable to the commission.â€ Â \r\nâ€œThe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€Â  Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987); see also Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276, 625 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2006); Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 352 S.C. 113, 120, 572 S.E.2d 462, 466 (Ct. App. 2002). Â Further, â€œ[w]here the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d 410 (2002) (citing Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436, 454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995)); see also Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€).Â  Â Â \r\nThe statute gives the commission the discretion of determining what is an acceptable form.Â  The Appellate Panel found Iyanelâ€™s Certificate of Insurance to be a â€œform acceptable to the Commission.â€Â  This finding was not in contravention of the literal meaning of the statute.Â  Accordingly, we give the proper deference to the Appellate Panel in interpreting the statute.Â  There is no compelling reason to differ with this interpretation of an acceptable form.\r\nThe Fund argues Regulation 67-415(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2005) provides the only acceptable document to demonstrate insurance.Â  The Regulation provides:\r\n\r\n  For purposes of Section 42-1-415, the ACORD Form 25-S, Certificate of Insurance, as published by the ACORD Corporation and as issued by the insurance carrier for the insured, shall serve as documentation of insurance.Â  The Certificate of Insurance must be dated, signed, and issued by an authorized representative of the insurance carrier for the insured.Â  \r\n\r\nId.Â  However, the Fund mischaracterizes the Regulation.Â  The Regulation describes a document that is always accepted by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission but does not prevent the Appellate Panel from finding other documentation acceptable.Â  Additionally, were we only to allow, as documentation of insurance, Certificates of Insurance that are signed, dated, and issued by an authorized representative of the insurance carrier for the insured, the upper-tier contractor could not look at the Certificate and discern whether it would be protected.Â  It would have to verify that the representative that issued the Certificate is authorized by the insurance carrier.Â  The legislature did not intend to put such a burden on contractors.\r\nThe Fund acknowledges the legislature created section 42-1-415 to provide relief for misled statutory employers.Â  Iyanel was exploited by its insurance company and, thus, unknowingly victimized Total Home.Â Â  The record contains no evidence that Total Home did not act in good faith.Â  Therefore, Total Home is exactly whom the legislature intended to protect when it enacted the statute. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nTotal Home met all of the requirements in section 42-1-415 of the South Carolina Code to transfer liability to the Fund.Â  Although the Certificate of Insurance was unsigned, the Appellate Panel found the Certificate of Insurance to be acceptable.Â  Accordingly, the circuit courtâ€™s portion of the order affirming the Appellate Panel is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Barton appealed to the Appellate Panel and circuit court.Â  The Appellate Panel affirmed the single commissioner, but the circuit court reversed the Appellate Panel on one of Bartonâ€™s issues on appeal regarding terminating weekly benefits.Â  The issues that Barton appealed are not involved in this appeal.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4198","title":"The Vestry v.

Young, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  This action arises out of a termite contract that the Church of the Holy Cross had with Orkin Exterminating Company and the discovery by Holy Cross that a termite infestation had damaged its historic church building.Â  The jury found for Orkin after a long trial involving issues related to the construction of the church building, the adequacy of annual inspections conducted by Orkin, the degree of termite damage sustained by the church building, and the cost of repairing the damage.Â  Holy Cross appeals the denial of its motion for a new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  We reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\nAt the start of the trial, the trial judge instructed the jurors that they should not discuss the case among themselves, should not discuss the case with anyone else, and should not attempt to investigate the case on their own.Â  A day after the trial ended in a jury verdict in Orkinâ€™s favor, an alternate juror contacted the trial judge and told him that â€œpossibleâ€ misconduct by one of the jurors had occurred during the trial of the case. Â The report prompted the trial judge to meet with the alternate juror to discuss her allegations.Â  Afterward, the trial judge addressed a letter to all counsel apprising them of the alternate jurorâ€™s allegations, allegations that in no way implicated either party or suggested wrongdoing by either party.Â  Â \r\nÂ According to the letter, the alleged misconduct, which the alternate juror later confirmed under oath, consisted of the offending juror â€œearly in the trial . . . question[ing] aloud the instructions that she was not to talk about the case . . . because everybody knew what was going onâ€; commenting to the other jurors â€œthat everyone knew that the historic people â€˜have moneyâ€™ and are simply trying to get someone else to â€˜pay their billsâ€™ â€ and â€œthat â€˜old buildings fall downâ€™ simply because of ageâ€; telling the other jurors â€œthat she did not know why she had to hear both sides of the case and that she had discussed it with her mother who reaffirmed that the historic people have money and should clean up their own messâ€; remarking to the other jurors that she had talked with a painter friend who told her that walls could collapse due to hidden termite damage; declaring to the other jurors â€œthat they should tear down the church and bring in a double wideâ€; indicating to the other jurors â€œthat she had talked with her minister about the situationâ€ but then retracting her statement â€œto say that she and the minister simply prayed about her service and she had asked for guidance in making a decisionâ€; and disclosing to the other jurors that she had gone out to the church and looked at it and that it â€œlooked fine to her.â€Â  The jurors reportedly admonished the offending juror about discussing the case, â€œlaughed offâ€ her comments, â€œ[told] her to stop,â€ and â€œpaid her no attention.â€ Â Â \r\nUpon learning of the alternate jurorâ€™s allegations, Holy Cross moved for a new trial based on juror misconduct.Â  \r\nThe trial judge later conducted a hearing at which he summoned Â the jurors to appear. Â After questioning the jurors in the presence of counsel for both parties regarding the allegations made by the alternate juror, the trial judge held the comments and actions by the offending juror did not prejudice Holy Cross in such a way as to â€œaffect[ ] the impartiality of the verdictâ€ and that â€œ[i]n fact, all other jurors[1] indicated that her actions had no impact on their individual decisions.â€[2] Â Whereupon, the trial judge denied the motion by Holy Cross for a new trial.Â  In a separate order, the trial judge held the offending juror in criminal contempt for â€œmaking impermissible comments to other jurors prior to the juryâ€™s proper deliberations.â€ \r\nThe basic issue here, as we see it, is whether the juror misconduct in question affected Holy Crossâ€™ right to fundamental fairness at trial.[3]Â  More to the point, did the juror misconduct at issue in this case so affect the juryâ€™s impartiality as to deprive Holy Cross of a fair trial?[4]Â  We recognize that what constitutes improper juror behavior as will warrant a new trial must be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.[5]Â  \r\nThe trial judge here mainly focused, particularly in his questioning of jurors, not upon the offending juror but upon the other eleven and the effect that the offending jurorâ€™s comments and actions had upon them.Â  The question, however, of whether the offending jurorâ€™s comments and actions had any influence upon the other jurors is not the sole determining factor as to whether the misconduct warrants a new trial.Â  A jury, after all, is composed of twelve, not eleven, jurors, and it acts as a unit[6]; thus, â€œthe misconduct of any juror, actual or implied, which . . . prevents a fair and proper consideration of the case is misconduct of the entire jury, vitiating its verdict and requiring a new trial.â€[7]Â  \r\nIn this case, the offending juror pointedly ignored the trial judgeâ€™s admonition for the jury to refrain from discussing the case until both sides could be heard from.Â  Aside from engaging in discussions with at least three outsiders about the case, the offending juror made statements to her fellow jurors early on and before the submission of the case about matters that were not based on the evidence, that manifested views openly hostile to Holy Cross, and that, one may reasonably presume, influenced her.[8]Â  Moreover, she undertook her own investigation into the facts when she drove out to the church without the authority of the court or the consent of the parties.\r\nThe prohibition against jurors discussing a case until the trial judge submits it to them for deliberation and decision[9] involves, our supreme court has held, a matter of fundamental fairness.[10]Â  The prohibition is meant to insure that jurors remain impartial throughout the entire trial and that they hear both sides of a controversy before making up their minds and rendering a verdict.Â  There are, after all, at least two sides to every story.\r\nAn examination or investigation by a juror conducted without the authority of the court or consent of the parties of a place or object that is the subject of conflicting evidence may provide a basis for a new trial.[11]Â  Although she may not have learned anything from her visit to the site that she did not already know and her report to the other jurors of her actions may not have had any impact on them, the offending jurorâ€™s attempt to conduct an unsanctioned investigation into the facts of this case, when viewed with her other acts and comments, shows a juror unconcerned about granting Holy Cross the fair and impartial trial to which it was entitled.[12]Â  \r\nA fair and impartial juror the offending juror clearly was not, particularly since it appears she made up her mind early on in the trial and before presentation of all the evidence. \r\nWe therefore hold that under the circumstances of this case, which involves several acts of juror misconduct and where at least one of those acts was deemed so egregious by the trial judge that he punished the offending juror for criminal contempt, the failure of the trial judge to grant a new trial based upon those acts of misconduct amounts to an abuse of discretion.[13]Â  While we recognize the burden our decision places upon Orkin, which bears no responsibility for what occurred, we believe fundamental fairness demands Holy Cross be given a new trial.[14] \r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.Â  STILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nSTILWELL, J., (dissenting):Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nThe focus of the majority opinion is principally upon the one juror who unquestionably is guilty of misconduct and violated the clear instructions of the court.Â  \r\nHowever, I believe, as did the trial judge, and as the state supreme court has instructed us, that the focus should be on what influence the miscreant jurorâ€™s actions had upon the remaining jurors and whether her conduct prejudiced the outcome of the trial to such an extent that the parties did not receive a fair trial.Â  See State v. Grovenstein, 335 S.C. 347, 352, 517 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1999) (finding misconduct that does not affect the verdict does not entitle a party to a mistrial).Â  See also State v. Zeigler, 364 S.C. 94, 108, 610 S.E.2d 859, 866 (Ct. App. 2005) (stating â€œ[t]he general test for evaluating alleged juror misconduct is whether there in fact was misconduct and, if so, whether any harm resulted to the defendant as a consequence.â€).Â  \r\nThe errant jurorâ€™s activities were initially reported to the trial judge by an alternate juror, after the jury verdict was received.Â  That juror, being an alternate, was in no position to testify of her own knowledge as to what influence, if any, the misconduct had upon the other jurors during the deliberations that resulted in the verdict, as she would necessarily have been dismissed prior to the court submitting the case to the jury.Â  It is worth noting that none of the jurors who actually took part in the deliberations thought the misconduct egregious enough to report it to the court. \r\nThe eminent trial court judge, following the procedure described by the state supreme court in State v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 509 S.E.2d 811 (1999), held an extensive evidentiary hearing, assembling the jurors, minus the offending juror, and conducting voir dire to ascertain the nature and extent of the alleged misconduct and to determine if any of the misconduct affected the juryâ€™s impartiality so as to undermine the verdict.[15] \r\nWithout reiterating the testimony of each individual juror and belaboring that issue, suffice it to say that the trial court made specific findings of fact to the effect that â€œ[a]ll of the jurors indicated that no improper conduct or outside influences tainted their unanimous verdict.â€Â  Continuing, the court stated it had â€œpreviously concluded in Order recorded on November 10, 2005 that Ms. Abrams (the miscreant juror) had violated the instructions of the Court by making improper comments to other jurors and she was sanctioned as a result of her actions.Â  However, the Court found at that time, and reaffirms by this Order, that the action of Ms. Abrams did not taint the judicial process or impact improperly on the juryâ€™s unanimous verdict.â€Â  \r\nThe remarks made by the trial court judge at the hearing resulting in the contempt citation to the offending juror are illustrative of his factual conclusions:\r\n\r\n  The comments that were made in the jury room obviously were not heard by everybody.Â  And many of the jurors heard nothing at all.Â  And to their credit it appears that the jurors who did hear it did not respond to it in any way and did not act on it in their deliberations.Â  The jurors . . . unanimously said that they did not take those comments into account in their decision in this particular case.Â  \r\n  . . .\r\n  Iâ€™m convinced that they did not taint the process, but I have only been convinced by doing what we have done, that is to talk with each one of these jurors individually, to inquire about them, to take more of their time away from their jobs as well, to make sure that . . . the process has not been tainted by these improper discussions, deliberations, comments if you will, and actions on behalf of Mrs. Abrams.Â  \r\n\r\nThese findings of fact were made by an experienced trial court judge who was in a position not only to view the jurors as they testified, but also to have the additional benefit of personally conducting the examination, circumstances that allowed him to better evaluate their responses, both verbal and non-verbal, and thereby judge their credibility.Â  These are findings of fact that are entitled to great deference.Â  State v. Harris, 340 S.C. 59, 63, 530 S.E.2d 626, 628 (2000).Â  \r\nI fear the majority opinion inadvertently injects into its analysis a â€œpresumption of prejudice,â€ thereby resurrecting a concept already specifically rejected.Â  See Grovenstein, 335 S.C. at 352, 517 S.E.2d at 218 (holding moving party has burden to demonstrate prejudice and adopting a â€œpresumption of prejudiceâ€ standard is erroneous).Â  \r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We note the dissent quotes a different portion of the trial judgeâ€™s order in which the judge states, â€œAll of the jurors indicated that no improper conduct or outside influences tainted their unanimous verdict.â€Â  As the dissent points out, however, the trial court did not examine the offending juror so the trial judgeâ€™s reference to â€œallâ€ applies to the remaining jurors, not to all twelve.\r\n[2]Â  Three jurors, however, indicated at one point in their examination by the trial judge that the offending jurorâ€™s comments had influenced them.Â  The first juror testified as follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Court:\r\n    \r\n     . . . Were you in any way influenced by the things that she said?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Juror:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Court: \r\n    \r\n    In what way?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Juror:\r\n    \r\n    She just kept talking about church, you know, helping churches and . . .\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Court:&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Right.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Juror:\r\n    &nbsp;\r\n    And that she talked to her pastor and he was going to pray for us, but he knew that it was the right thing for us to do.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Court:\r\n    \r\n    What was the right thing for you to do?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Juror:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    To just let the church get other churches to help.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Court:&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    And were you convinced by what she said or by what her pastor said that that was the right thing to do?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    Juror:\r\n    No, but I guess, you know, I couldn&rsquo;t help but hear it, I heard it so much. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAlthough perhaps not â€œconvincedâ€ (the trial judgeâ€™s word) by anything that the offending juror said, the first juror nonetheless admitted to being â€œinfluencedâ€ (again, the trial judgeâ€™s word) by those comments.Â  Improper influence, however slight, is still improper influence, or as Paul writes in Galatians 5:9 (RSV), â€œA little leaven leavens the whole lump.â€\r\nAdmittedly, the juror later backed off slightly on her admission of influence. When pressed by the trial judge about whether the offending jurorâ€™s comments â€œinfluenced [her] in making a decision,â€ she indicated they had done so; but then, when pressed further, she qualified her answer, saying that she was â€œstill not sureâ€ and â€œI donâ€™t think I based my decision on anything she said.â€Â  [Emphasis added.]Â  In other words, she could not tell the trial judge definitively whether the offending jurorâ€™s comments impacted her decision in the case or not.Â  Suffice it to say, the juror never testified that the comments and actions of the offending juror â€œhad no impactâ€ on her individual decision.\r\nLike the first juror, the other two initially acknowledged the offending jurorâ€™s comments had indeed influenced them, at least somewhat.Â  One of these said, when asked whether what the offending juror said â€œha[d] any bearing on [the juror] making up [her] mind one way or the other,â€ replied, â€œA little.Â  She shouldnâ€™t have said nothing, you know, to the jury about it.â€Â  This juror later testified, however, that what the offending juror said did not cause her to decide the case â€œone way or another.â€Â  The other juror, when asked whether what the offending juror told her â€œha[d] any bearing on [her] decision,â€ answered, â€œWell, I canâ€™t say that it didnâ€™t, you know, come in my mind, you know. . . .Â  But I think â€“ I still made my decision based on the facts.â€ \r\n[3]Â  See Alston v.

Rushton, Joseph H. Floyd, and Lawrence R. Coleman (collectively â€œLowcountryâ€), appeal the trial courtâ€™s order awarding damages to Drs. Timothy and Karen Keane.Â  Lowcountry contends the trial court erred in: (1) including goodwill in its valuation of Lowcountry; (2) awarding prejudgment interest; and (3) awarding punitive damages.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 1, 1986, Dr. Rushton and Dr. Floyd organized Lowcountry Pediatrics.Â  Rushton and Floyd later added Dr. Coleman to the practice, and the three became the senior physicians and shareholders of Lowcountry. Â Eventually, the Keanes and Dr. Christine Chiavello joined the practice, and all three became shareholders of Lowcountry.[1]Â  \r\nUpon the admission of each new member into Lowcountry, the doctors amended the shareholder agreement to reflect the current value of a withdrawing shareholderâ€™s stock.Â  The shareholder agreement provided that upon a shareholderâ€™s withdrawal from the practice that shareholderâ€™s shares of stock would be bought back by Lowcountry at an agreed upon price. Â The shareholder agreement indicated the purchase price for the withdrawing shareholderâ€™s stock would remain in effect until a new value was agreed upon, in writing, following the end of each fiscal year.Â  Between 1989 and 1998, the doctors amended the shareholder agreement on three different occasions, and each amendment occurred after Lowcountry received an appraisal to calculate its fair market value.Â  The 1998 amendment was the final amendment prior to this controversy. Â Article 3.1 of the 1998 revision to the shareholder agreement stated:\r\n\r\nValue of shares of stock:Â  For the purpose of this Third Amendment to Shareholders Agreement, the value of each share of issued stock . . . of the Agreement . . . is $15.30.Â  This value has been agreed upon by the shareholders as representing the fair value of each share of stock, including goodwill of the Association.\r\n\r\nAccording to this amendment to the shareholder agreement, the Keanes owned a combined thirty percent of the shares in Lowcountry.[2] Â Â \r\nSome time after the third amendment to the shareholder agreement, the senior physicians began to contemplate the end of Lowcountry, complaining about the lack of physical space in the office as well as their differing views with the Keanes about the proper management of the practice.Â  As a result, on December 20, 1999, the senior physicians sent a letter to the Keanes notifying them of their desire to â€œsplit up Lowcountry Pediatrics.â€Â  The Keanes, however, had no desire to dissolve the practice, and despite the senior physiciansâ€™ repeated attempts to discuss dissolution, the Keanes declined to withdraw from the practice. \r\nBecause no agreement could be reached to â€œsplit-upâ€ Lowcountry, the senior physicians called a shareholder meeting.Â  At the shareholder meeting, the doctors were to vote on, among other items, removing the non-complete agreement and obtaining an appraisal to value the shares of Lowcountry in order to effectuate the buy-out of the Keanes and Chiaviello.[3] Â At the meeting, the senior physicians voted in favor of removing the non-compete clause from the employment agreement.Â  The Keanes and the senior physicians disagreed on the appraisal.Â  The Keanes wanted the individual physiciansâ€™ goodwill included in the valuation of Lowcountry, but the senior physicians did not.Â  As a result of this disagreement, the senior physicians and Chiaviello voted to obtain an appraisal of Lowcountry by Webster, Rogers and Company with the Keanes abstaining from the vote. Â A â€œdraftâ€ appraisal was subsequently undertaken, and the appraisal indicated a value of $22.95 per share for the Lowcountry stock, excluding the individual physiciansâ€™ goodwill, with a total value of stockholdersâ€™ equity of $229,500. \r\nBased on this valuation, the senior physicians offered to purchase the Keanesâ€™ shares for $68,850.Â  Alternatively, the senior physicians gave notice of their intentions to withdraw from Lowcountry, offering to sell their shares to the Keanes for the same per share price.Â  The senior physicians provided the Keanes with sixty days to respond or Lowcountry would be dissolved pursuant to the shareholder agreement.Â  In June of 2000, the senior physicians increased their purchase offer to $100,000 for the Keanesâ€™ interest in Lowcountry.Â  The Keanes, however, continued to refuse to withdraw from the practice.Â  Lowcountry continued operating as a practice until July 24, 2000, sixty days after which the offer to buy or sell the senior physiciansâ€™ shares had expired.Â  \r\nAt this time, the senior physicians filed the articles of dissolution; changed the locks on the building; and opened their own practice, Beaufort Pediatrics, at the same location.[4]Â  All of the assets of Lowcountry, including the equipment, supplies, patient records, and bank accounts were utilized by Beaufort Pediatrics.Â  However, the accounts receivable of Lowcountry had been collected and distributed to the Keanes in proportion to their interest in Lowcountry.Â  The senior physicians also paid Lowcountry for the use of the fixed assets, rent, and supplies.Â  This money was also placed into the account for Lowcountry and distributed according to the interest of the shareholders, including the Keanes.\r\nOn September 22, 2000, the Keanes brought this action against Lowcountry alleging numerous causes of action, including a derivative action, a declaratory judgment action, and a claim pursuant to sections 33-14-310 and 320 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2000) to determine the fair market value of Lowcountry.Â  To this end, the Keanes obtained an appraisal of Lowcountry performed by Louis Fleishman.[5] Â Using the discounted future cash flow method, which included the individual physiciansâ€™ goodwill, Fleishman valued Lowcountry at $1,319,200. Â Fleishman valued the tangible assets at a total of $401,344, with $42,344 in fixed assets, $18,000 for supplies, and $341,000 for accounts receivable.Â  He valued the general intangibles, including the individual physiciansâ€™ goodwill, at $917,856. \r\nThe master-in-equity: (1) determined the value of Lowcountry was $1,319,200; (2) found the Keanes were only entitled to thirty percent of the $917,856 intangible value of Lowcountry as they had already received their thirty percent interest in the tangible assets of Lowcountry; (3) awarded the Keanes $275,296 for their thirty percent interest in Lowcountry; (4) ordered prejudgment interest on the $275,296 award; (5) found the senior physicians had willfully and wantonly violated their fiduciary duties to the Keanes; and (6) awarded $50,000 in punitive damages to the Keanes.[6]Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis appeal involves both equitable and legal causes of action.Â  When both equitable and legal causes of action are maintained in one suit, each must be analyzed separately according to its own identity as legal or equitable.

App. 1996).Â  In addition, an action to determine the fair market value of stocks owned by a dissenting shareholder constitutes a proceeding in equity to be tried by a judge without a jury.Â Â  Defender Props., Inc, v. Doby, 307 S.C. 336, 338, 415 S.E.2d 383, 384 (1992).Â  In an action in equity referred to a master, the appellate court may view the evidence to determine facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence, though it is not required to disregard the findings of the master.&nbsp; Friarsgate, Inc. v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Assâ€™n, 317 S.C. 452, 456, 454 S.E.2d 901, 904 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nThe determination of the appropriateness of an award of pre-judgment interest, on the other hand, is a question of law because the right to relief is entirely statutory.Â  See, e.g.,Â  Harvey v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 338 S.C. 500, 507, 527 S.E.2d 765, 769 (Ct. App. 2000) (finding â€œwhere the relief sought is entirely statutory . . . the action is one at law.â€).Â  Likewise, an action for punitive damages arising from a breach of fiduciary duty is a question of law.Â  Jordan, 362 S.C. at 205, 608 S.E.2d at 131.Â  â€œIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not disturbed upon appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s findings.â€Â  Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Calculation of Fair Market Value\r\nLowcountry argues the trial court erred in including the value of the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in the calculation of the fair market value of the association.Â  We agree.\r\nWhile both parties correctly point out that no South Carolina authority specifically addresses the propriety of the inclusion of the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in the context of a dissolution of a professional association, we believe the cases of Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989), and Weinberg v. Wallace, 314 S.C. 183, 442 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 1994), are illustrative.\r\nIn Donahue, Wife sought an interest in Husbandâ€™s professional dental practice as part of the equitable distribution of the marital estate.Â  299 S.C. at 358, 384 S.E.2d at 744.Â  The family courtâ€™s valuation of the professional practice included Husbandâ€™s professional goodwill, and Husband appealed.Â  Id.Â  In considering Husbandâ€™s arguments, the supreme court reasoned that â€œthe very nature of a professional practice is that it is totally dependent upon the professional.â€Â  Id. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â  Moreover, the supreme court recognized the speculative nature of professional goodwill because its valuation is based on the doctorâ€™s future earnings, which are totally dependent upon the professional.Â  Id. at 359, 384 S.E.2d at 745 (citing Casey v. Casey, 293 S.C. 503, 362 S.E.2d 6 (1987) (acknowledging the speculative nature of goodwill being dependent upon future earnings)).Â  The supreme court reasoned that professional goodwill:\r\n\r\n[A]ttaches to the person of the professional man or woman as a result of confidence in his or her skill and ability.Â  It does not possess value or constitute an asset separate and apart from the professionalâ€™s person, or from his individual ability to practice his profession. Â It would be extinguished in the event of the professionalâ€™s death, retirement or disablement.\r\n\r\nId. at 359, 384 S.E.2d at 745 (citations omitted).Â  As a result, the supreme court held it was error to include professional goodwill in valuing Husbandâ€™s dental practice.Â  Id. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745.Â  \r\nThe view of professional goodwill attaching solely to the professional, not to the association, has been expanded outside of the family court arena.Â  In Weinberg v. Wallace, the court of appeals addressed whether Weinberg was allowed to recover for an alleged conversion of goodwill associated with a family business that was operated by Wallace.Â  314 S.C. at 185, 442 S.E.2d at 212.Â  The court of appeals, citing the Donahue analysis, reasoned:\r\n\r\nIf the business is a professional practice, then [goodwill] attaches solely to the person of the professional man or woman as a result of confidence in his or her skill and ability and does not possess value or constitute an asset separate and apart from the professionalâ€™s person.\r\n\r\nId. at 187, 442 S.E.2d at 213 (internal quotations omitted).Â  \r\nThe testimony of the Keanesâ€™ expert, Fleishman, echoes the decisions in Donahue and Weinberg regarding the speculative nature of valuing the physiciansâ€™ individual goodwill as well as its personal nature.Â  When Fleishman testified, he conceded that an element of the intangible value of Lowcountry is the â€œphysicians (sic) and their individual reputation.â€ Â Further, when asked hypothetically on cross-examination what the intangible value of a practice would be if three physicians were to quit the practice, Fleishman responded: â€œIf they truly go away, and no longer practice then a large portion of the intangible value would go away,â€ but that value would â€œbe hard to arrive at.â€Â  He continued: \r\n\r\nI would have to look and speculate and say what, what else is going to remain the same . . . Well, I donâ€™t think I could say, you know, put a specificâ€”well, that weâ€™ll take away half the intangibles or twenty percent or eight percent.Â  Thereâ€™s no specific formula attached to that.\r\n\r\nFurther, Fleishman testified the speculation required to determine the value remaining with the practice once a physician leaves is due to its intangible nature, and that determining what Lowcountry is worth is â€œnot entirely scientific.â€ \r\nThe Donahue and Weinberg courts clearly held that South Carolina courts should not, in valuing a professional association, include the goodwill of the professional because of its speculative nature and the fact that goodwill â€œattaches solely to the person of the professional man or woman as a result of confidence in his or her skill and ability and does not possess value or constitute an asset separate and apart from the professionalâ€™s person.â€Â  See Donahue, 314 S.C. at 187, 442 S.E.2d at 213.Â  Fleishmanâ€™s own testimony only reinforces that holding.Â  As a result, the Keanes are not entitled to the $275,296 awarded by the master, which represented their thirty percent interest in the intangible value of Lowcountry.\r\nWe do not intend for this opinion to be interpreted as barring parties from contractually agreeing to include personal goodwill in the valuation of a shareholderâ€™s interest upon dissolution.Â  However, that theory was never advanced by the Keanes, either at trial or in their brief before this court, as the basis for their position.[7]Â  Accordingly, we do not believe it is appropriate to use it as an additional sustaining ground.Â  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (holding, in the context of an appellate courtâ€™s authority to affirm for any reason appearing in the record, that â€œ[a] respondent may abandon an additional sustaining ground . . . by failing to raise it in an appellate brief.â€)Â  Moreover, even if we believed this argument was available as a basis for affirming, we do not agree that the language of the shareholder agreement controls this issue.Â  The agreement states that the value of $15.30 per share â€œhas been agreed upon by the shareholders as representing the fair value of each of stock, including goodwill of the Association.â€Â  We do not perceive the language â€œgoodwill of the Associationâ€ to be synonymous with the inclusion of individual physicianâ€™s goodwill upon a dissolution of the practice, and absent specific language that individual goodwill should be used to value a shareholderâ€™s interest upon dissolution, we believe this issue is controlled by Donahue and Weinberg.\r\nNext, Lowcountry argues that should we find the trial court incorrectly included the physiciansâ€™ professional goodwill in the valuation of the Keanesâ€™ interest, we should use the value in its May 2000 appraisal to value the Keanesâ€™ interest.Â  We agree in part and disagree in part.\r\nWhile we agree that the trial court erred in including the value of the goodwill of the individual physicians in the calculation of Lowcountryâ€™s fair market value, we disagree that the May 2000 appraisal is the appropriate gauge of Lowcountryâ€™s value.Â  Lowcountryâ€™s May 2000 appraisal was merely a â€œdraft,â€ and the appraiser who prepared it did not testify at trial.Â  Additionally, Lowcountry provided no other evidence of valuation of the corporate stock during the hearing.Â  Therefore, we believe the best evidence regarding the tangible value for Lowcountry remains the Keanesâ€™ appraisal prepared by Fleishman, less the amount attributed to the individual goodwill of the physicians.Â  Â Â Using the Keanesâ€™ own appraisal, we find, as did the trial court, that the fixed assets, supplies, and accounts receivable of Lowcountry were worth $401,344. \r\nIn its amended order, the trial court found that â€œthe money from the accounts receivable, rent and supplies purchases were placed into the Lowcountry account and distributed in accordance with the respective percentages of ownership.â€ Â The trial court also found that the Keanes neither argued that the disbursements had been made, nor did the Keanes dispute that they had received their thirty percent of the tangible assets.Â  As a result, the trial court determined that the $401,344 of accounts receivable, rent, and supplies had already been distributed to, and received by, the Keanes according to their respective thirty percent interest in Lowcountry.[8]Â  Pursuant to our holding that the trial court incorrectly included the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in valuing the Keanesâ€™ interest in Lowcountry, the Keanes are only entitled to their thirty percent of the tangible assets of the association.Â  Because the Keanes have already received their entire thirty percent interest in the fair market value of Lowcountry, they are entitled to no additional distributions. Â Â \r\nII.Â  Award of Prejudgment Interest\r\nLowcountry Pediatrics next contends the trial court erred in awarding prejudgment interest to the Keanes.Â  We agree. \r\nSection 34-31-20 of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides that â€œin all cases of accounts stated and in all cases wherein any sum or sums of money shall be ascertained and, being due, shall draw interest according to law, the legal interest shall be at the rate of eight and three-fourths percent per annum.â€ Â Such prejudgment interest, however, is allowed on an obligation to pay money â€œfrom the time when, either by agreement of the parties or operation of the law, the payment is demandable, if the sum is certain or capable of being reduced to certainty.â€Â  Babb v. Rothrock, 310 S.C. 350, 353, 426 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1993).Â  In other words, an award of prejudgment interest is not proper if the measure of recovery is not fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.Â  Id.\r\nIn this matter, the trial court awarded $275,296 in actual damages to the Keanes pursuant to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  At oral argument, however, the Keanesâ€™ attorney conceded these actual damages were based solely on the valuation of Lowcountryâ€™s stock, which is an equitable cause of action.Â  In other words, the trial court found the damages under the legal and equitable causes of action to be one in the same.Â  This award equaled the Keanesâ€™ thirty percent interest in the practice based on the Fleishman appraisal, which included goodwill.Â  Pursuant to our holding that the trial court incorrectly included the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in valuing the Keanesâ€™ interest in Lowcountry, we find the Keanes are not entitled to the $275,296 awarded to them by the trial court.Â  Therefore, no award of actual damages exists upon which prejudgment interest can be awarded.[9] Â Â \r\nIII.Â  Punitive Damages\r\nLowcountry Pediatrics contends the trial court erred in ordering punitive damages to the Keanes on their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œPunitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence the defendantâ€™s misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the plaintiffâ€™s rights.â€Â \r\nAustin v. Specialty Transp. Serv., 358 S.C. 298, 313, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Punitive damages, however, may only be awarded upon an underlying finding of actual damages.Â  Dowling v. Home Buyers Warranty Corp., 311 S.C. 233, 236, 428 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1993).Â  \r\nIn this matter, the trial court awarded $275,296 in actual damages to the Keanes pursuant to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  This award equaled the Keanesâ€™ thirty percent interest in the goodwill amount as included in the Fleishman appraisal.Â  As mentioned previously, the Keanesâ€™ attorney conceded during oral argument these actual damages were tied solely to the equitable valuation of Lowcountryâ€™s stock.Â  Pursuant to our holding that the trial court incorrectly included the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in valuing the Keanesâ€™ interest in Lowcountryâ€™s stock, we have removed the underlying award of actual damages on which the circuit court based the award of punitive damages.Â  Therefore, the award of punitive damages cannot prevail without a finding of actual damages, and accordingly, the award of punitive damages is reversed.[10]Â  See Dowling, 311 S.C. at 236, 428 S.E.2d at 711 (holding punitive damages may only be awarded upon an underlying finding of actual damages).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the order of the circuit court is hereby \r\n REVERSED.[11]\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissents in a separate opinion. \r\nKITTREDGE, J., dissenting in part and concurring in part:Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nI dissent in part and concur in part.Â  I respectfully dissent from the reversal of the masterâ€™s award of actual and punitive damages to the Keanes.Â  I agree with the majority opinion that the masterâ€™s award of prejudgment interest to the Keanes should be reversed.\r\nThe first issue to address is our standard of review.Â  Although the Keanes prevailed on multiple theories (legal and equitable), the majority focuses exclusively on the equitable corporate dissolution claim.Â  By excluding consideration of the legal claim, the court easily segues to an equitable standard of review and determines its own view of the facts.Â  The result is a factual recitation in a light most favorable to Appellants.Â  I would not ignore the legal claim and the more deferential scope of review that flows from it.Â  \r\nThe master found that Appellants breached their fiduciary duty to the Keanes.Â  This finding has not been appealed and is the law of this case.Â  See Dreher v. Dreher, 370 S.C. 75, __ n.1, 634 S.E.2d 646, 647 n.1(2006) (â€œ[A]n unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and precludes further consideration of the issue on appeal[.]â€) (citing In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370, 372 n.2, 468 S.E.2d 651, 652 n.2 (1996)).Â  A fair reading of the masterâ€™s order indicates the award of actual damages (for all causes of action) represented his judgment of the value of the Keanesâ€™s interest in Lowcountry Pediatrics.Â  The majority so acknowledges in observing that â€œthe trial court awarded $275,296 in actual damages to the Keanes pursuant to their claim for breach of fiduciary duty.â€Â Â  \r\nAn action for breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law.Â  As such, we are constrained to uphold the masterâ€™s findings if supported by any evidence. See Jordan v. Holt, 362 S.C. 201, 205, 608 S.E.2d 129, 131 (2005) (â€œ[A] claim of breach of fiduciary duty is an action at law and the trial judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld unless without evidentiary support.â€).Â  The master, who was in a better position to assess witness credibility and demeanor, viewed the evidence in a light less favorable to Appellants.Â  I would hold there is evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s findings.\r\nThere is another reason I would not focus the analysis on corporate dissolution law.Â  There was no corporate dissolution (or â€œwinding upâ€) of the medical practice.Â  Articles of dissolution were prepared and Appellants represented to the Keanes that the medical practice would be dissolved; the articles of dissolution, however, were not filed with the South Carolina Secretary of Stateâ€™s office.Â Â Â  More to the point, Appellants conceded at trial that there was no dissolution[12] and that Lowcountry Pediatrics should be â€œconsidered a going concern.â€[13]Â  After Appellantsâ€™ initial efforts to force the Keanes from the medical practice failed (using the ploy of dissolution and otherwise), Appellants changed the locks to the office while the Keanes were on vacation.Â  The medical practice continued without missing a beat, as Appellants simply replaced the sign for â€œLowcountry Pediatricsâ€ with â€œBeaufort Pediatricsâ€ and carried on using Lowcountryâ€™s office equipment and phone number.Â  \r\nI would honor Appellantsâ€™ trial stipulation to value the medical practice as a going concern.Â  I would not, as the majority does, value â€œgoodwill in the context of a dissolution of a professional association.â€Â  There was no dissolution.\r\nI now turn to the majorityâ€™s rejection of goodwill as a component of the value of the medical practice.Â  As pointed out by the majority, Article 3.1 of the April 22, 1998 amendments to the shareholder agreement made no change in the requirement to include the goodwill of Lowcountry Pediatrics in determining â€œthe fair value of each share of stock.â€Â  In my view, South Carolina law does not forbid parties from contracting to include goodwill as a component of value.[14]Â  I see nothing in the Donahue v. Donahue[15] line of cases precluding consideration of goodwill when the parties so contract.Â  Donahue and other cases cited by the majority do not address the issue before us: whether parties may contractually bind themselves to include goodwill in the value of a professional association.Â  It may be difficult to place a value on goodwill, but contracting to include goodwill is neither illegal nor contrary to public policy. \r\nBecause the shareholder agreement provides a basis for including goodwill in the value of the medical practice, it may appear that the master should have similarly embraced the $15.30 price per share of stock as set forth in the April 1998 amended shareholder agreement.Â  There are two fundamental reasons why the master did not value the stock at $15.30 per share.Â  First, Appellants have never relied on this figure, neither in the trial court nor this court.Â  Second, when the partiesâ€™ dispute came to a head in early 2000, Appellants commissioned a new appraisal of the practiceâ€”Appellants did not rely on the April 1998 assigned value of $15.30 per share.Â  The result was a â€œdraftâ€ appraisal of $229,500 for the medical practice, or $22.95 per share.Â  Appellants concede this â€œdraftâ€ appraisal â€œdid not include good will [sic].â€Â  (Appellantsâ€™ final brief, 11).Â  Finally, beyond Appellantsâ€™ â€œdraftâ€ appraisal, as the majority points out, Appellants â€œprovided no other evidence of valuation of the corporate stock during the hearing.â€Â  \r\nThe holding of the majority rests on the principle that â€œindividual professional goodwillâ€ is not a proper component of the value â€œin the context of a dissolutionâ€ of a professional practice.Â  I do not necessarily oppose this principle.Â  To reach this conclusion, however, we must ignore basic rules of issue preservation.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review).Â  I have already noted that Appellants conceded at trial there was no dissolution and that the medical practice should be valued as a going concern.[16]Â  The result the court reaches today (while ostensibly sound in the abstract) rests on issues and arguments that were never presented in the trial.Â  We end up with a different case than the one tried before the master.Â  I would honor our basic issue preservation rules and not permit Appellants to try a different case than was presented in the trial court.Â  I would not punish the Keanesâ€”the Respondentsâ€”for failing to rebut in the trial court issues that were conceded and arguments that were never made at trial.[17]Â  \r\nThe majority further finds that the Keanes never advanced the theory that they were entitled to goodwill because of its inclusion in the shareholder agreement â€œeither at trial or in their brief before this court.â€ Â This is not so.Â  The Keanes did, in fact, rely on the agreementâ€™s inclusion of goodwill at trial and in brief to this court.Â  For example, Dr. Timothy Keane testified about the shareholder agreement and answered affirmatively when asked if the agreement included â€œan allocation of Good Will [sic].â€Â  The record contains many references to the shareholder agreement and goodwill.Â  In their brief to this court, the Keanes again relied on the language of the agreement, noting it â€œexpressly included good will [sic].â€Â  (Respondentsâ€™ final brief, 7).Â  If it appears the agreementâ€™s inclusion of goodwill was not a focus at trial, it should not inure to Appellantsâ€™ benefit on general issue preservation principles. \r\nThe bottom line is that in valuing the Keanesâ€™s interest in Lowcountry Pediatrics as a going concern and assessing damages, under the â€œany evidenceâ€ standard of review, there is evidence supporting the masterâ€™s inclusion of goodwill in the value of the medical practice.Â  Because there is some evidence to support the masterâ€™s determination of value and award of actual damages, I would affirm the award.Â  \r\nI would also affirm the masterâ€™s award of punitive damages to the Keanes.Â  My analysis begins with this courtâ€™s standard of review.Â  We should affirm if there is any evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s finding that Appellantsâ€™ misconduct was willful, wanton, or in reckless disregard of the Keanesâ€™s rights.Â  See Jordan, 362 S.C. at 207, 608 S.E.2d at 132 (â€œ[Appellate courts] must affirm the trial courtâ€™s finding of punitive damages if any evidence reasonably supports the judgeâ€™s factual findings.â€).Â  I would find there is evidence in the record to support the masterâ€™s finding.Â  \r\nFinally, I concur with the majority in result that the masterâ€™s award of prejudgment interest to the Keanes should be reversed.Â  â€œThe proper test for determining whether prejudgment interest may be awarded is whether the measure of recovery, not necessarily the amount of damages, is fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.â€Â \r\nButler Contracting, Inc. v. Court Street, LLC, 369 S.C. 121, __, 631 S.E.2d 252, 259 (2006).Â  An award of prejudgment interest in this case would be improper because the measure of recovery was â€œnot fixed by conditions existing at the time the claim arose.â€Â  While the parties understood goodwill was to be included in the value, the varying approaches to goodwill valuation is at odds with the idea of a liquidated claim and a fixed measure of recovery. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The Keanes, along with the other doctors, signed employment contracts.Â  These contracts provided for a one-year term of employment and contained a non-compete clause.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The Keanes collectively owned 3,000 of the 10,000 shares of Lowcountry.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Chiaviello voluntarily resigned from the practice at this time.Â  Chiavielloâ€™s resignation was accepted at the shareholders meeting.\r\n[4]&nbsp; The Secretary of State eventually returned the articles of dissolution to Lowcountry.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; Fleishman previously prepared an appraisal valuing Lowcountry in 1995, utilizing the â€œdiscounted cash flow method,â€ which included goodwill.\r\n[6] Â Â Â Â Â Â  After receiving post-trial motions, the master issued an amended order correcting some computational errors but provided no substantive changes. \r\n[7]&nbsp; Moreover, if the Keanes believed the terms of the shareholder agreement controlled, they should have been eager to accept the $68,850â€”not to mention the $100,000â€”offered by the senior physicians for their thirty percent interest in Lowcountry, as that offer exceeded by $22,950 the $45,900 the Keanes would have been entitled to under the shareholder agreement.\r\n[8]&nbsp; The Keanes do not appeal from this finding of the trial court.Â  It is, therefore, the law of the case.Â  See Charleston Lumber Co. v. Miller Housing Corp., 338 S.C. 171, 175, 525 S.E.2d 869, 871 (2000) (holding an unappealed ruling, right or wrong, is the law of the case.).\r\n[9]&nbsp; In so holding we do not disregard our standard of review for the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action, which is a legal claim.Â  Rather, we merely hold there are no damages to be awarded under the breach of fiduciary duty cause of action pursuant to our holding that the trial court incorrectly included the physiciansâ€™ individual professional goodwill in valuing the Keanesâ€™ interest in Lowcountryâ€™s stock.Â  The Keanesâ€™ concession at oral argument supports this view.Â  Â Â \r\n[10]&nbsp;\r\nThe Keanesâ€™ reliance on Cook v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 183 S.C. 279, 190 S.E. 923 (1934) is misplaced.Â  The Keanes rely on Cook for the proposition that an award of punitive damages may be allowed to stand despite no finding of actual damages.Â  That is not the import of Cook, however.Â  The holding in Cook is that an award for punitive damages may be allowed to stand if â€œit is clearly shown that legal right has been willfully or recklessly invaded and that nominal actual damages were merged in the verdict for punitive damages.â€Â  Id. at ___, 190 S.E. at 924 (emphasis added).Â  Here, we have removed the award of punitive damages in its entirety, and accordingly, there is no award of actual damages to merge with the award of punitive damages.Â  Therefore, Cook is inapplicable because that case requires, at a minimum, an award of nominal actual damages before an award of punitive damages may be upheld.\r\n[11]&nbsp;\r\nIn light of our disposition of this case, we need not address the Keanesâ€™ remaining issue regarding the two-issue rule.Â  See \r\nWhiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (stating appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\n[12]&nbsp;\r\nI would not permit Appellants to resurrect in this court an argument abandoned at trial.\r\n[13]&nbsp;\r\nAppellants had the medical practice appraised as a going concern in 1995 when Beaufort Memorial Hospital was considering purchasing Lowcountry Pediatrics.Â  That value, obtained by and for Appellants, included goodwill and was â€œapproximately $145,300 to $860,000.â€Â  \r\n[14]&nbsp;\r\nPerhaps the shareholder agreement, by its terms, may be applied only in the case of a â€œwithdrawingâ€ shareholder, but such an argument was never made by Appellants.\r\n[15]&nbsp;\r\n299 S.C. 353, 384 S.E.2d 741 (1989).\r\n[16]&nbsp;\r\nAppellate counsel did not represent Appellants at trial.\r\n[17]&nbsp;\r\nWhile this court â€œmay affirm any ruling, order, or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on Appeal,â€ Rule 220(c), SCACR, I know of no basis to reverse the trial court when the ground does not appear in the record.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4200","title":"Brownlee v.

Riley, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKEMMERLIN, Acting Judge: Samuel Brownlee and Richard Jolly (Landowners) appeal from an order of the circuit court affirming the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panelâ€™s denial of permits to extend docks from their respective properties, across a tributary, to the Bohicket River.Â  In the alternative, Landowners argue the circuit court should have ordered a neighboring dock be moved.Â  We reverse.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nThis case reaches us through a contorted appellate process.Â  It arises from a decision of the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) denying the Landowners permission to build or to extend private recreational docks from their lots to the Bohicket River, sometimes called Bohicket Creek. \r\nThe Landowners sought review by the Administrative Law Division (ALJ) where the case was assigned to the Honorable Ralph King Anderson, III.Â  Judge Anderson allowed Edward Mappus to intervene pro se and heard the case on November 5, 2002, taking testimony and other evidence.Â  By Orders of March 7, 2003, and April 23, 2003, Judge Anderson overruled the OCRMâ€™s determination and directed that permits be issued to Landowners.\r\nOn Appeal, The Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (CZMAP) reversed the decision of the ALJ and the Landowners appealed to the Court of Common Pleas for Charleston County.Â  There the case was heard by the Honorable Mikell Scarborough, Circuit Judge, who affirmed the CZMAP in an opinion dated October 25, 2004.Â  This appeal by the Landowners followed.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe South Carolina Coastal Council in 1989 issued to David and Melissa Case a permit to build from their property to the Bohicket River a seven-hundred-foot walkway across an intertidal mud flat.Â  The Cases thereafter sold their lot and assigned their permit to Lawrence Atkinson who in 1991 built a walkway and dock to the Bohicket River; however, the dock did not comply with the Coastal Councilâ€™s permit.Â  It is one hundred thirty feet longer than permitted, and it does not reach the Bohicket at the point allowed by the permit.Â  Instead, the pierhead extends into the main run (the deepest part) of the swash referred to in the record below as a â€œtributaryâ€ of the Bohicket.[1]\r\nAtkinsonâ€™s dock builder applied for â€œas builtâ€ approval, but in September of 1991, the Coastal Councilâ€™s Permit Coordinator noted that the dock was not where it should be and that it â€œwas obstructing navigation of [the] tributary.â€[2]Â  An enforcement action against Atkinson was brought, and in November of 1991, the South Carolina Coastal Council issued its Order providing:\r\n\r\n[T]he â€˜as builtâ€™ dock is not in compliance with the issued permit in that it is longer than permitted and is not constructed in the permitted location.Â  The dock extends well channelward of the permitted extension.Â  This extension is not reasonable for the intended use under R.30-12(c).Â  The constructed dock also impedes navigation into the adjoining tributary . . . .\r\n\r\nAtkinson failed to comply with the Order, and the dock still stands in defiance of the Order of the Coastal Council, the predecessor of OCRM.Â  Moreover, OCRM has not enforced the removal Order.\r\nSamuel Brownlee and Richard Jolly, the Landowners, are the contiguous owners of property abutting on the tributary.Â  In 2001 they sought permits to build a dock seven hundred fifty feet across the marsh to the Bohicket.Â  To do this, they had to pass over the tributary.Â  OCRM, as the successor to the Coastal Council in permitting activities,[3] denied the issuance of permits on April 19, 2002, the denial being stated by the Agency in a letter that read in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nOCRM staff has determined that authorizing the dock extension over the tributary would be counter to Regulations.Â  OCRM Regulations specifically state â€œdocks shall not impede navigation and they can only extend to the first navigable creek as evidenced by a significant change in grade.â€ OCRM staff performed a boat trip and found that the creek exhibits significant width (50â€™) and change in grade at your dock that excludes the very nature of a waterbody that is navigable.Â  Furthermore, the creek has an established history of public use as evidenced by the four (4) docks that currently access this creek.\r\n\r\nWhen the case reached Judge Anderson, he tried it and issued his all important decisionâ€”all important because in the long history of the case his was the only tribunal where the witnesses actually appeared and gave testimony and offered other evidence.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  At trial Richard Chinnis, an employee of OCRM, testified that in 1991 he was the Permit coordinator and in that connection was aware of the Atkinson permit and the enforcement action against Atkinson.Â  When shown a plat which depicted the Atkinson dock, the following colloquy appears in the trial transcript:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       And can you identify it on there the tributary that the . . . [Landowners lots] . . . are upon?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Well, heâ€™s [the maker of the plat] showing whatâ€™s labeled a nonvegetative intertidal mud flat to theâ€”if youâ€™re on the high ground looking at the Bohicket to the immediate right of the walkway.Â  This is not exactly the configuration of the creek that Mr. Combos has his dock permit on, but I guess thatâ€™s the creek heâ€™s talking about even thought itâ€™s labeled . . . [as an] . . . intertidal mud flat, not a creek . . . .[4]\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter he visited the site, he wrote Atkinson in 1991, advising him that the dock as built was a hazard to navigation.\r\nChuck Dawley, a registered land surveyor qualified as an expert in surveying tidal areas, testified that the Atkinson walkway and pierhead crossed the main run of the tributary at its mouth and that on the day of his survey, a windy day, the boat he occupied was â€œactually being propelled into the Atkinson dock.â€Â  He stated that a boat once within the tributary could be used when the tide was up, but that there was difficulty in getting in and out of the tributary.Â  \r\nSteven Combos, the owner of a lot which abuts the tributary and the holder of a U.S. Coast Guard certificate to operate fifty gross ton size vessels, was qualified as an expert on safety and navigation and testified that the Atkinson dock obstructs navigation and also presents a hazard to navigation in this area.Â  He testified:\r\n\r\nWell, when you try to traverse, coming or going, from the inlet and you have a north wind or you have an outgoing tide, you have to hug the pilings that are on that dog leg well before you get to his fixed pier because if you donâ€™t youâ€™ll be on the sandbar to the opposite site, and Iâ€™ve hit the pilings and Iâ€™ve hit that oyster mound plenty of times.Â  Now, in ideal conditions, you know, when you have basically a high tide or no wind, I mean, you know, it is possible to get by it.Â  But, like I say, itâ€™s my experience that itâ€™s far and few between that those opportune times are there.\r\n\r\nHe stated that it is particularly hazardous because after the Atkinson dock was built, an oyster bank and a sandbar at the mouth of the tributary have grown â€œtremendously.â€Â  When Mr. Combos approached OCRM staff, he was told that he and the Landowners would be permitted to build their docks over the tributary to Bohicket Creek, but Edward Mappus, the pro se intervener in this case and owner of a lot on the tributary objected.Â  Mr. Combos, who owns the lot next to Mr. Mappus, offered to elevate any portion of his dock and walkway over the tributary and to let Mr. Mappus use his dock, but Mappus would not consent to allowing the proposed walkway and dock to reach the Bohicket River.Â  Judge Anderson found that the Atkinson dock â€œpresents a significant impediment to navigation in the tributary,â€ and he ruled that OCRM must either direct removal of the Atkinson dock or issue the requested permits to the Landowners.\r\nOn appeal, OCRM called Mr. Curtis Joyner, its Manager of Critical Area Permitting.Â  He testified that he also visited the site by boat.Â  He made various measurements at a three-quarter tide.Â  He asserted that at that stage of the tide he had no trouble entering the tributary.Â  His visit to the tributary, unlike that of Mr. Dawley, the Registered Land Surveyor, did not occur on a windy day.Â  The substance of his testimony was that he did not feel that the building of the Atkinson dock in the main run of the tributary and the build up of a bar and oyster bank since the dock was placed had made the tributary not-navigable.Â  OCRM reversed the ALJ, finding he erred in his interpretation of 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n).Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act (APA),[5] an Administrative Law Judge presides as the fact finder.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2005); Brown v. South Carolina Dept. of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  A proceeding before the ALJ is in the nature of a de novo hearing, including the presentation of evidence and testimony, rather than an appellate proceeding.Â  See Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 S.E. 2d at 413. \r\nThe Appellate Panel reviews the decision of the AdministrativeÂ  Judge in an appellate capacity pursuant to section 1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina Code. Â S.C. Code Ann Â§ 1-23-610(D) (2005).[6] Â The Appellate Panelâ€™s review is confined to the record before it. Â The circuit courtâ€™s review is the same as this Courtâ€™s under section 1-23-380(A)(6)(2006) of the South Carolina Code. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(2005);[7] Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 S.E. 2d at 413. Â It may reverse a decision of an administrative agency if the agencyâ€™s findings or conclusions are: \r\n\r\n(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(2005); see also Weaver v. South Carolina Coastal Council,Â  309 S.C. 368, 374, 423 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIn reviewing the final decision of the ALJ pursuant to section 1-23-610(D), the Appellate Panel sits as a quasi-judicial tribunal and is not entitled to make findings of fact.Â  See Brown, Â 348 S.C. at 520, 560 S.E. 2d at 417. Â â€œThe [Appellate] Panel can validly reverse the ALJ based on an error of law . . . or if his findings are not supported by substantial evidence.â€ Dorman v. South Carolina Dept of Health &amp; Envt. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 165, 565 S.E.2d 199, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nHere there is no error of law by the ALJ and his findings are supported by the required substantial evidence. The Appellate Panel found the ALJ misinterpreted what constitutes a navigable waterway under Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) and reversed the ALJâ€™s ruling.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel determined the ALJ erred in concluding â€œin order for a waterway to be legally navigable under Regulation 30-12(A)2(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazardâ€ and in concluding that the tributary â€œcurrently is not a navigable waterway.â€ Â Â We find this was error.\r\nOCRM took the position that as a matter of law the creek was navigable.Â  If that was true, the Landowners could not prevail.Â  But navigability here is a matter of fact, and the facts as found by the ALJ were adverse to OCRM.Â  OCRM claimed the creek was navigable; the Landowners claimed it was not.Â  Although the testimony is in dispute, the facts as found by the ALJ are supported by the evidence.Â  In the words of the ALJ:\r\n\r\nIn this case, the area of the tributary in front of the Petitionersâ€™ property is currently a defined channel, as evidence by a significant change in grade with the surrounding marsh.Â  However, the mere existence of a defined channel is not enough to satisfy the provisions of Regulation 30-12A(2)(n).Â  Rather, the regulation requires that the waterway also be navigable.Â  Though the tributary itself may be capable of floating watercraft at mid-tide, the facts establish that the mouth of the tributary cannot be consistently navigated safely at the ordinary stages of the tides because of the Atkinson dock.Â  Therefore, I find that it currently is not a navigable waterway.Â  \r\n\r\nFurther, the ALJ held:\r\n\r\nWhile the tributary itself can be navigated at mid-tide and higher, the â€œthreadâ€ of the stream goes underneath the Atkinson dock and is an impediment to boaters attempting to enter or exit the tributary.Â  Though it is possible to easily navigate around the dock, as reflected by the experience of the OCRM staff, that ease of navigation is dependant upon unpredictable winds and currents.Â  Therefore, I find that the Atkinson dock as it is currently situated presents a frequent hazard to safe navigation in and out of the tributary at the ordinary tides due to the location of the channel of the tributary under the Atkinson dock, the existence of the sand bar/mud flat on the side of the mouth opposite the Atkinson dock, and the prevailing winds and currents.\r\n\r\nThe ALJ concluded the decision as follows:\r\n\r\nI conclude that in order for a waterway to be legally navigable under Regulation 30-12A(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazard.Â  Therefore, though the docks would cross a defined channel, they would not cross a navigable waterway and thus would not impede reasonable navigation in the tributary to the detriment of the public and an adjacent property owner . . . [T]he determination that the tributary is not navigable is due to a man-made impediment.Â  If the Atkinson dock is removed from its location in the mouth of the tributary, the impediment would no longer exist and the tributary would be a navigable stream.\r\n\r\nThis factual finding is consistent with a prior determination of OCRMâ€™s predecessor.Â  The Coastal Council, in its Order of November 1991, found that the Atkinson dock as built â€œimpedes navigation.â€Â  The dock remains to this day in the same place, still impeding navigation.Â  \r\nCZMAP failed to state how the ALJ erred in his interpretation of 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n).Â  Rather, the order simply states that the ALJ erred where he concluded: â€œin order for a waterway to be legally navigable under Regulation 20-12(A)(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazard,â€ and â€œthe facts establish that the mouth of the tributary cannot be consistently navigated safely at the ordinary stages of the tides because of the Atkinson dock. . . .â€ Â Absent explanation of this legal conclusion, or of how the facts in the record supported a finding of â€œnavigabilityâ€ under the regulation, we can see no error of law meriting reversal of the ALJ.Â  Further, the ALJâ€™s findings of fact were supported by substantial evidence on the record.\r\nHere OCRM finds itself in the position of trying to pull its chestnuts from a fire it set.Â  It would not face the problem it now faces if it and its predecessor, the Coastal Council, had proceeded to enforce the removal Order directed to Atkinson. Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order which affirmed OCRMâ€™s denial of the landownerâ€™s dock permit.Â  We reinstate the ALJâ€™s order, which remanded the case so OCRM could either remove the Atkinson dock or approve the Landownersâ€™ dock permits.Â  \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., concurs.\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  I respectfully dissent.\r\nSamuel Brownlee and Richard Jolly (collectively, â€œLandownersâ€) brought this action against the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control, Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (â€œOCRMâ€), after it denied their requests for construction permits to extend two private docks to a nearby river.Â  Upon review, an Administrative Law Judge (â€œALJâ€) ordered OCRM to issue the permits.Â  On appeal, the Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel (the â€œAppellate Panelâ€) reversed the ALJ and reinstated the denial of the permits.Â  The circuit court affirmed.Â  Landowners appeal.Â  I would affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nLandowners have residential property on Johns Island that is adjacent to an unnamed tributary of the Bohicket River in Charleston County, South Carolina.Â  Landownersâ€™ ground is separated from the Bohicket River by the tributary and an expanse of marsh.Â  Brownlee has a partially constructed dock that was originally permitted to the tributary, but which has not been completed.Â  Jolly has a complete dock that extends to the tributary.Â  This case arises out of Landownersâ€™ desire to cross the tributary in order to reach the Bohicket River.Â  \r\nLandowners submitted permit applications to OCRM in 2001 requesting permission to extend their existing docks across the adjacent tributary and into the Bohicket River.Â  Landownersâ€™ applications were submitted along with applications filed by two other similarly situated neighbors.Â  \r\nThe basis for the permits was Landownersâ€™ belief that the location of a neighborâ€™s dock, owned by Lawrence Atkinson and constructed in 1991, was situated near the mouth of the tributary in such a way that the creek was no longer safely navigable.[8]Â  An upstream neighbor of the Landowners, Edward Mappus, objected to Landownersâ€™ applications on the ground extension of the docks would create a barrier to his use of the tributary.Â  Mappus stated he navigates in and out of the tributary for recreational purposes about thirty times per year.Â Â Â  \r\nOCRM determined authorization to extend the docks over the tributary would be counter to existing regulations and denied the applications.Â  In letters sent in April 2002 informing Landowners of its decision, OCRM explained:\r\n\r\nOCRM Regulations specifically state, â€œdocks shall not impede navigation and they can only extend to the first navigable creek as evidenced by a significant change in grade.â€Â  OCRM staff performed a boat trip and found that the creek exhibits significant width (50â€™) and change in grade at your dock that exudes the very nature of a waterbody that is navigable.Â  Furthermore, the creek has an established history of public use as evidenced by the 4 docks that currently access this creek.Â  \r\n\r\nOCRM cited several regulations, including former 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n) (Supp. 2001),[9] to support the denial of Landownersâ€™ applications.Â Â Â  \r\nLandowners sought review of OCRMâ€™s decision by the South Carolina Administrative Law Judge Division (now the South Carolina Administrative Law Court).[10]Â  A contested case hearing was held in November 2002.Â  In his order dated March 7, 2003, the ALJ â€œconclude[d] that in order for a waterway to be legally navigable under Regulation 30-12A(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazard.â€Â  The ALJ determined the tributary is not a navigable waterway under Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) â€œdue to a man-made impedimentâ€ â€“ i.e., the Atkinson dock.Â  The ALJ noted, however, that â€œ[i]f the Atkinson dock is removed from its location in the mouth of the tributary, the impediment would no longer exist and the tributary would be navigable.â€Â  The ALJ reversed the decision of OCRM and remanded the case to OCRM to â€œeither have the Atkinson dock removed from its current location and constructed as it was originally permitted or approve [Landownersâ€™] permits to the Bohicket River.â€Â Â Â  \r\nThe ALJ subsequently amended his order on April 23, 2003, after OCRM filed a motion to alter or amend, clarifying that, â€œ[t]hough the waters of the tributary in front of the [Landownersâ€™] property are navigable, the waterway itself is not navigable because the mouth of the tributary cannot safely be entered at the ordinary stages of the tide.â€Â  The judge directed OCRM to grant Landownersâ€™ application for permits to extend their docks to the Bohicket River.Â Â Â  \r\nOCRM appealed the ALJâ€™s ruling to the Appellate Panel, which reversed the ALJ, finding the judge erred in his conclusions of law.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel found the ALJ â€œerred in his interpretation of 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-12(A)(2)(n)â€ in determining what constituted a navigable waterway.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLandowners thereafter appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed the Appellate Panel.Â  The circuit court concluded the Appellate Panel was â€œwithin the scope of [its] authority [in] setting forth [its] own interpretation of the regulationsâ€ and noted it â€œagree[s] with [the Appellate Panelâ€™s] interpretation that Reg. 30-12 prohibits the crossing of navigable waterways unless there is an obstruction, which prohibits navigation at most stages of the tide cycle.â€Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis case has had a contested case hearing as well as several levels of appellate review.Â  Under the Administrative Procedures Act (APA),[11] the ALJ presided as the fact finder.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(B) (Supp. 2005); Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 520, 560 S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002).Â  The proceeding before the ALJ was in the nature of a de novo hearing, including the presentation of evidence and testimony, rather than an appellate proceeding.Â  See Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 S.E.2d at 413.Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel reviewed the decision of the ALJ in an appellate capacity pursuant to section 1-23-610(D) of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(D) (2005).[12]Â  The Appellate Panelâ€™s review was confined to the record before it.Â  Id.\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s review is the same as this Courtâ€™s under section 1-23-380(A)(6) of the South Carolina Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005)[13]; Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 S.E.2d at 413.Â  This Court may reverse a decision of an administrative agency if the agencyâ€™s findings or conclusions are â€œ(a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (2005); see also Weaver v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368, 374, 423 S.E.2d 340, 343 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Independent Fact Finding\r\nLandowners contend the circuit court erred by failing to reverse the Appellate Panel for improperly engaging in independent fact finding and for characterizing the alleged fact finding as the correction of â€œlegal error.â€Â  \r\nIn reviewing the final decision of the ALJ pursuant to section 1-23-610(D), the Appellate Panel sits as a quasi-judicial tribunal and is not entitled to make findings of fact.Â  See Brown, 348 S.C. at 520, 560 S.E.2d at 417.Â  Under this standard, â€œ[t]he [Appellate] Panel can validly reverse the ALJ based on an error of law . . . or if his findings are not supported by substantial evidence.â€Â  Dorman v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 165, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nThe evidence presented at the contested case hearing before the ALJ indicates navigation between the tributary and the Bohicket River was possible, but made more difficult by the Atkinson dock and other dangerous conditions.Â  Based on this evidence, the ALJ initially found the tributary was not navigable, although the tributary would be navigable if the Atkinson dock were removed.Â  In his final order upon OCRMâ€™s motion to alter or amend, the ALJ found:Â  â€œThough the waters of the tributary in front of the [Landownersâ€™] property are navigable, the waterway itself is not navigable because the mouth of the tributary cannot safely be entered at the ordinary stages of the tide.â€Â  The ALJ ordered OCRM to issue the permits.Â  \r\nThe Appellate Panel found the ALJ misinterpreted what constitutes a navigable waterway under Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n) and reversed the ALJâ€™s ruling.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel determined the ALJ erred in concluding â€œin order for a waterway to be legally navigable under Regulation 30-12(A)(2)(n), the navigation of the waterway must not be so impeded as to create a frequent hazardâ€ and in concluding the tributary â€œcurrently is not a navigable waterwayâ€ based on the fact â€œthat the mouth of the tributary cannot be consistently navigated safely at the ordinary stages of the tides because of the Atkinson dock.â€Â  \r\nI agree with the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination that the ALJ erred in his interpretation of what constitutes a navigable waterway under the aforementioned regulation.Â  The mere fact that an artificial structure, such as Atkinsonâ€™s dock, impedes navigation does not make the waterway nonnavigable.Â  I find no compelling reason to reverse the agencyâ€™s interpretation of its own regulation.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did not err in upholding the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.Â  See South Carolina Coastal Conservation League v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 363 S.C. 67, 75, 610 S.E.2d 482, 486 (2005) (â€œCourts\r\ndefer to the relevant administrative agencyâ€™s decisions with respect to its own\r\nregulations unless there is a compelling reason to differ.â€); Dorman, 350 S.C. at 163-65, 565 S.E.2d at 121-22 (holding the portion of the Appellate Panelâ€™s order â€œon OCRM policy underlying navigation and construing its regulation was properâ€; the Appellate Panel had found the ALJ misinterpreted â€œnavigationâ€ in the agency regulations to include disputes between neighbors or conflict with nearby docks, whereas OCRM had interpreted its own regulations and determined that any navigational issues between docks is a private property owner issue); 65 C.J.S. Navigable Waters Â§ 8 (2000) (â€œAs a general rule a stream or other body of water is not rendered nonnavigable because of occasional difficulties attending navigation. . . .Â  So, a stream may be navigable despite the obstruction of falls, rapids, sand bars, carries, or shifting currents.Â  Artificial obstructions which are capable of being abated by the due exercise of public authority do not prevent a stream from being regarded as navigable . . . .â€ (footnotes omitted)).Â  \r\nII.Â  Equal Protection\r\nLandowners additionally assert the circuit court erred in failing to find OCRMâ€™s failure to grant their application for dock permits denied them equal protection under the law.Â  See U.S. Const. Amend. 14, Â§ 1; S.C. Const. Art. 1, Â§ 3.Â  Landowners maintain other similarly situated persons in the vicinity and elsewhere have been granted the relief they seek.Â  Â Â \r\nâ€œIn reviewing the final decision of an administrative agency, the circuit court sits as an appellate court.â€Â  Brown, 348 S.C. at 519, 560 S.E.2d at 417.Â  â€œConsequently, issues not raised to and ruled on by the agency are not preserved for judicial consideration.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œLikewise, issues not raised to and ruled on by the ALJ are not preserved for appellate consideration.â€Â  Id. â€œWhile it is true that ALJs cannot rule on a facial challenge to the constitutionality of a regulation or statute, ALJs can rule on whether a law as applied violates constitutional rights.â€Â  Dorman, 350 S.C. at 171, 565 S.E.2d at 126.\r\nIn this case, the ALJ did not make a specific finding in his original order as to whether OCRMâ€™s denial of the dock permits constituted a violation of Landownersâ€™ equal protection rights.Â  Moreover, this issue was neither raised in a post-trial motion nor considered in the ALJâ€™s post-trial order.Â  In addition, this issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the Appellate Panel.Â  In fact, the record indicates that the issue concerning the violation of Landownersâ€™ equal protection rights was expressly raised for the first time to the circuit court.Â  The issue, therefore, of whether Landownersâ€™ equal protection rights were violated is not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (â€œIt is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€); DuRant v.

Bailey, Stephen E. Darling, and Anne L. Ross, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J.:Â  On the night of June 8, 2001, Monty Austin Adair and three friends purchased beer at a local convenience store.Â  The group proceeded in Adairâ€™s Jeep to a large tract of undeveloped commercial property known as the â€œSand Pitsâ€ to go â€œmuddingâ€ (off-road driving).Â  The Sand Pits is owned by L-J, Inc. and David Neal Jordan (â€œRespondentsâ€).Â  While on the Sand Pits, Adair decided to drive the Jeep up a steep embankment.Â  When Adair attempted to maneuver the Jeep down the embankment, an accident occurred, resulting in Adairâ€™s death.Â  Adair had a blood-alcohol level of .252%. \r\nAdairâ€™s Estate brought a wrongful death suit against Respondents, claiming Respondentsâ€”as owners of the Sand Pitsâ€”were responsible for Adairâ€™s death.Â  Respondents moved the circuit court for summary judgment, which the circuit court granted, holding Adair was a trespasser on Respondentsâ€™ property.Â  The Estate appeals.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nI.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 536, 611 S.E.2d 922, 925 (2005).Â  On appeal, when factual matters are in dispute, all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence must be viewed in a light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  Id.Â  \r\n II.\r\nBefore the accident at issue in this case, Respondents were unrelenting in their efforts to stop trespasser incursions onto their property.Â  On the perimeter of the Sand Pits, Respondents posted â€œno trespassing signs.â€Â  At the entrances to the Sand Pits, Respondents dug ditches, built berms, and erected gates.Â  Respondents also enlisted local law enforcement to assist them in their efforts to keep trespassers off the Sand Pits.Â  Despite these efforts, however, trespassers continued to come onto the Sand Pits to dump trash or, as in this case, go joyriding.\r\nOn the night of June 8, 2001, Adair and three friendsâ€”Mark Cook, Michael Martin, and Duane Sweatâ€”purchased beer and entered Respondentsâ€™ property to go â€œmuddingâ€ in Adairâ€™s Jeep.Â  In the Sand Pitsâ€™ interior, the men took a path that â€œgrew smaller and smallerâ€ until they encountered a steep embankment.Â  Although Adairâ€™s friends did not think the Jeep could get up the embankment, Adair, undeterred, resolved to drive the Jeep to the top.Â  At this point, Adairâ€™s friends got out of the Jeep and Cook illuminated the way up the embankment with a flashlight.Â  \r\nAdair successfully negotiated the embankment and, once there, exited the Jeep and spoke with his friends.Â  Adair then decided to press onward, this time with Martin and Sweat as passengers.Â  Cook walked in front of the Jeep with a flashlight.Â  As Adair tried to maneuver the Jeep on the steep embankment, it rolled over, tumbled down the embankment, hit a tree, and caught fire.Â  Martin and Sweat escaped, but Adair was not so fortunate; he was pinned inside the Jeep and died later that night.Â  As noted, an analysis revealed that Adair had a blood alcohol level of .252%, a level well beyond the concentration necessary for an inference that Adair was under the influence of alcohol at the time of the accident.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(b)(3) (Supp. 2001).\r\nIII.\r\nAlthough the Estate raises numerous issues on appeal, the determinative issue is whether Adair was a trespasser on Respondentsâ€™ property.Â  We find Adair was a trespasser as a matter of law, and affirm the circuit courtâ€™s order. \r\nA.\r\nâ€œSouth Carolina recognizes four general classifications of persons who come on premises: adult trespassers, invitees, licensees, and children.â€Â  Sims v. Giles, 343 S.C. 708, 715, 541 S.E.2d 857, 861 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  An adult trespasser is â€œa person whose presence is neither invited nor sufferedâ€ while a licensee is â€œa person not invited, but whose presence is suffered.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAdairâ€™s presence on Respondentsâ€™ property was neither invited nor suffered: Respondents did not give Adair permission to go â€œmuddingâ€ on their property nor did they suffer his presence.Â  Although Respondents knew trespassers came onto the Sand Pitsâ€”as the area was known for off-roading and other unwelcomed activities, like trash-dumpingâ€”Respondents did everything they reasonably could to keep trespassers off their property.Â  The record is replete with Respondentsâ€™ longstanding and unrelenting efforts to keep trespassers like Adair off their property. \r\nRespondents posted â€œno trespassingâ€ signs on the perimeter of their property.[2]Â  When Respondents learned that â€œno trespassingâ€ signs had been removed, they posted new signs.Â  Respondents also blocked off entranceways to their property with gates, ditches, and dirt berms.Â  \r\nRespondents also implored local law enforcement to help keep trespassers off their property.Â  In April 2001, just a few months before Adairâ€™s death, Respondents wrote the following letter to the North Charleston Police Department: \r\n\r\n[W]e would appreciate your staff arresting and prosecuting anyone trespassing on [the Sand Pits].Â  We put up [â€œ]no trespassing[â€] signs approximately twice a year, and generally within one to three months they are torn down.Â  After the signs have been placed people continue to trespass and dump debris on this property.Â  We have also placed gates and dug ditches to try to keep people out, but as you probably know, nothing seems to help.Â  Please let us know if we can help you in any way to keep these people and dumpers off this property. \r\n\r\nRespondents even hired a caretaker to live on the Sand Pits for the purpose of preventing and deterring trespassers.Â  The City of North Charleston objected, however, because the caretakerâ€™s residence violated a zoning ordinance.Â  In a letter addressed to Respondents and dated May 10, 2001 (less than a month before Adairâ€™s death), the City of North Charleston threatened Respondents with â€œlegal action,â€ noting â€œ[i]t has come to [our] attention that a letter was sent to you in 1999 advising you that no one is allowed to live on this property.â€Â  Respondentsâ€™ reply, dated May 15, 2001, illustrates their diligence (and exasperation) in preventing and deterring trespassers:\r\n\r\nI donâ€™t know if you are familiar with all of the problems we have had on [the Sand Pits], such as people trespassing, dumping debris, stripping and burning stolen vehicles, joy ridding [sic] and parking on the property.Â  This has been going on for years.Â  Every time we put up gates and/or no trespassing signs, they are torn down.Â  Enclosed you will find a copy of a letter to [the North Charleston Police Department] concerning the problems with this property. \r\nAt the present time, we have an employee of this company who lives on the property and acts as a caretaker of the property . . . trying to keep people out.Â  I am afraid that if this person is removed from the property the dumping and trespassing will only get worse.Â  This is my dilemma and itâ€™s a catch 22, darn if I do and darn if I donâ€™t.\r\nI would appreciate you advising me on what to do in this situation.Â  I realize what the law is, but how do I keep people from dumping on my property[?]Â  This is especially difficult, since I am [an] absentee owner[;] our office is in Columbia, S.C. \r\n\r\n(ellipsis in original).Â  \r\nIn light of Respondentsâ€™ persistent and diligent efforts to keep trespassers from coming onto their property, the trial court correctly held that as a matter of law Respondents did not suffer or acquiesce to the presence of trespassers on their property.[3]Â  Adair was a trespasser as a matter of law. \r\nBecause Adair was a trespasser, Respondents owed him no duty except the duty not to do him willful or wanton injury.Â  Nettles v. Your Ice Co., 191 S.C. 429, 436, 4 S.E.2d 797, 799 (1939) (holding a landowner â€œowes no duty to a trespasser . . . except to do him no willful or wanton injury.â€).Â  In a light most favorable to the Estate, there is no evidence in the record indicating Respondents willfully or wantonly tried to injure Adair or any other trespasser on their property.Â  Accordingly, the circuit court correctly held Respondents did not breach a duty of care it owed Adair. \r\nB.\r\nThe balance of the Estateâ€™s assignments of error are either not prejudicial to the Estate or manifestly without merit.Â  Owners Ins. Co. v. Clayton, 364 S.C. 555, 563, 614 S.E.2d 611, 615 (2005) (â€œError without prejudice does not warrant reversal.â€); Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR (â€œThe Court of Appeals need not address a point which is manifestly without merit.â€).Â  \r\nIV.\r\nWe join the circuit court in holding as a matter of law that Adair and his friends were trespassers.Â  In the light most favorable to the Estate, the evidence demonstrates Respondents neither invited nor suffered Adairâ€™s or any other trespasserâ€™s presence on their property.Â  In fact, the only reasonable inference that can be gleaned from the record is that Respondents persistently and diligently tried to keep trespassers off their property.Â  It is difficult to imagine what else Respondents could have done to deter trespassers.Â  The order of the trial court granting Respondentsâ€™ summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]&nbsp; It is unclear whether a â€œno trespassingâ€ sign was posted on the night of Adairâ€™s death.Â  Even assuming trespassers removed the â€œno trespassingâ€ signage prior to the evening of June 8, 2001, that fact would in no manner create a genuine issue of material fact precluding the entry of summary judgment in this case.Â  We recognize that whether a personâ€™s presence on the property of another is â€œinvitedâ€ or â€œsufferedâ€ may often present a jury question.Â  In this case, however, the evidence points unmistakably to one conclusionâ€”the landowners did not invite Adair on their property nor did they suffer his presence or any other trespasserâ€™s presence.Â  If Respondentsâ€™ actions are not sufficient as a matter of law, the law would likely provide no landowner protection from such claims.Â  \r\n[3]&nbsp; We reject the Estateâ€™s argument, citing Jones v. Atlanta-Charlotte Air Line Railway Company, 218 S.C. 537, 63 S.E.2d 476 (1951), that Adair was an imputed licensee rather than a trespasser.Â  In Jones, the supreme court noted â€œthe uncontradicted evidence showed that there were well defined paths leading down to and along defendantâ€™s tracks, and that for more than twenty years the public at large had been accustomed to use these paths for pedestrian purposes, with the acquiescence of the defendants.â€Â  Id. at 541, 63 S.E.2d at 477.Â  Here, Respondents did not in any way acquiescence to the presence of the public on their property; rather, Respondents took repeated affirmative steps to prevent the public from coming onto their property.Â  Thus, the circuit court did not err in finding Adair was not an imputed licensee. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
