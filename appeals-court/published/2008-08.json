Jones &amp; Co., L.P. (Edward Jones) in May of 2004.Â  This account was\r\n  managed by David Freeman, an agent for Edward Jones.Â  At the beginning of his\r\n  relationship with Edward Jones, Hatcher signed an authorized adoption agreement\r\n  which contained an arbitration clause stating:Â  â€œany controversy arising out of\r\n  or relating to any of my accounts or transactions with you, your officers,\r\n  directors, agents, and/or employees for me, to this agreement, or to the breach\r\n  thereof . . . from the inception of such account shall be settled by\r\n  arbitration.â€Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Hatcherâ€™s complaint, he deposited $113,584.68 with Edward Jones and Freeman\r\n  (collectively Appellants) on or about May 1, 2004.Â  Subsequently, the majority\r\n  of those funds were withdrawn without his permission and deposited in an\r\n  account of Hatcherâ€™s, and thereafter were withdrawn by a third person, who is\r\n  now incarcerated as a result of her actions.Â  Â \r\nÂ Hatcher\r\n  brought this action against Appellants alleging the following causes of\r\n  action:Â  breach of contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent\r\n  act, negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and violation of SCUTPA.Â Â Â  Hatcher\r\n  alleged Appellants allowed his money to be withdrawn and wired to bank accounts\r\n  without his knowledge.\r\nAppellants answered\r\n  Hatcherâ€™s complaint asserting numerous defenses, including that Hatcherâ€™s\r\n  claims were subject to a binding arbitration provision.Â  Thereafter, Appellants\r\n  filed a motion to compel arbitration and a hearing was held.Â  The circuit court\r\n  denied the motion to compel arbitration, finding the â€œtheft and conversionâ€ of\r\n  Hatcherâ€™s money was completely independent of the contract and could be\r\n  maintained without reference to the contract.Â  Moreover, the circuit court\r\n  found the removal of Hatcherâ€™s money arose out of the unauthorized transfer of\r\n  funds from his account, and that Hatcher did not sign a contract authorizing electronic\r\n  funds transfer.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe determination of whether a claim is subject to\r\n  arbitration is subject to de novo review.â€Â  Wellman, Inc. v. Square D Co.,\r\n  366 S.C. 61, 67, 620 S.E.2d 86, 89 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  However, a circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  factual findings will not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supports the findings.Â  Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C.,\r\n  357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANAYLSIS\r\nAppellants contend the circuit court erred in denying\r\n  their motion to compel arbitration because the arbitration agreement signed by\r\n  Hatcher required that any controversy arising out of and/or relating to any\r\n  account or transaction be submitted to arbitration.Â  We agree with Appellants\r\n  that the circuit court erred in failing to find Hatcherâ€™s claims for breach of\r\n  contract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty are subject to arbitration.Â  However, we find the circuit court\r\n  correctly held Hatcherâ€™s claims for negligence and violation of SCUTPA are not\r\n  subject to arbitration.\r\nBoth\r\n  state and federal policy favor the arbitration of disputes.Â  Zabinski v.\r\n    Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001); see also Chassereau v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 171, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 718, 720 (2007).Â  Unless a court can say with positive assurance that\r\n  the arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation that covers the\r\n  dispute, arbitration should ordinarily be ordered.Â  Zabinski, 346 S.C.\r\n  at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118-19.Â  However, arbitration is a matter of contract,\r\n  and a party cannot be required to arbitrate any dispute that he has not agreed\r\n  to arbitrate.Â  Id. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Accordingly, courts generally\r\n  hold broadly-worded arbitration agreements apply to disputes in which a\r\n  â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ exists between the asserted claims and the contract\r\n  containing the agreement to arbitrate.Â  Id. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119 (citing Long v. Silver, 248 F.3d 309 (4th Cir. 2001)).\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue all of the claims asserted by Hatcher relate to the investment account that\r\n  he set up with Edwards Jones, and, therefore, arbitration is warranted.Â  We\r\n  agree as to some of the claims filed by Hatcher but disagree as to others.\r\nIn Aiken\r\n  v. World Finance Corp. of S.C., 373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d 705 (2007), our\r\n  supreme court refused to apply a broadly-worded arbitration clause to the theft\r\n  of Aikenâ€™s personal information by World Finance employees.Â  In holding there was\r\n  not such a significant relationship between Aikenâ€™s contracts with World\r\n  Finance and the tortious acts of its employees, the court specifically rejected\r\n  World Financeâ€™s argument, similar to the one asserted by Appellants here, that\r\n  without the underlying agreement, there could have been no theft giving rise to\r\n  Aikenâ€™s claims.Â  The supreme court stated: \r\n\r\n\tApplying\r\n  what amounts to be a â€œbut-forâ€ causation standard essentially includes every\r\n  dispute imaginable between the parties, which greatly oversimplifies the\r\n  partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate claims between them.Â  Such a result is\r\n  illogical and unconscionable. . . . â€œThe mere fact that the dispute would not\r\n  have arisen but for the existence of the contract and consequent relationship\r\n  between the parties is insufficient by itself to transform a dispute into one\r\n  â€˜arising out of or relating toâ€™ the underlying agreement.â€ \r\n\r\nId. at 150, 644 S.E.2d at 708 (quoting Seifert v. U.S.\r\n  Home Corp., 750 So. 2d 633, 638 (Fla. 1999)).\r\nThe\r\n  supreme court held the theft of Aikenâ€™s personal information by World Finance was\r\n  outrageous conduct that could not possibly have been foreseen when Aiken agreed\r\n  to do business with World Finance.Â  Consequently, the court held Aikenâ€™s claims\r\n  for outrage and emotional distress, negligence, negligent hiring/supervision,\r\n  and unfair trade practices were not subject to arbitration.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the Aiken court instructed that its opinion should not be interpreted as\r\n  excluding all intentional torts from the scope of arbitration.Â  For example, a\r\n  claim which essentially alleges a breach of the underlying contract such as\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty or misappropriation of trade secrets would be within\r\n  the contemplation of the parties in agreeing to arbitrate.Â  Id. at 152,\r\n  644 S.E.2d at 709.Â Â Â Â  \r\nApplying\r\n  the courtâ€™s analysis in Aiken to the claims advanced by Hatcher\r\n  in this case, we hold the claims for breach of contract, breach of contract\r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act, and breach of fiduciary duty allege a breach\r\n  of the underlying contract, and are therefore subject to the partiesâ€™ agreement\r\n  to arbitrate.Â  However, Hatcher also sued for negligence and violation of\r\n  SCUTPA.Â  As in Aiken, although these claims are factually related to the\r\n  performance of the contract, each action is legally distinct from the\r\n  contractual relationship between the parties, and therefore, was not within the\r\n  contemplation of the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate.[1]Â \r\n  Just as the supreme court held in Aiken, we find that to interpret the\r\n  arbitration provision contained in Hatcherâ€™s contract with Edward Jones to\r\n  apply to alleged action completely outside the expectations of the parties at\r\n  the time the contract was entered would be inconsistent with the goal favoring\r\n  arbitration as an effective means for resolving disputes. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the circuit courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART,\r\n  REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\r\nSHORT, J., and KONDUROS, J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n[1] We recognize our court recently held a SCUTPA claim\r\n  was subject to arbitration when the underlying agreement between the parties\r\n  was for the sale of a vehicle, and plaintiff alleged he received a vehicle\r\n  different from the one he thought he was purchasing. Â Partain v. Upstate\r\n    Auto. Group, Op. No. 4373 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed April 23, 2008) (Shearouse\r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 69).Â  The significant relationship we found existed between\r\n  Partainâ€™s claim and the underlying agreement is not extant here, where the\r\n  underlying agreement is for the investment of Hatcherâ€™s monies, and the SCUTPA\r\n  claim is based on the wrongful electronic transfer of Hatcherâ€™s funds at the\r\n  direction of a third party and without Hatcherâ€™s prior consent.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4432","title":"Sanders v.

Â We reverse.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nOn June 14, 2000, Albertha Sanders\r\n  suffered an injury to her knee descending from a ladder while working at\r\n  Wal-Mart.Â  Wal-Mart acknowledged the injuries arising from this accident were\r\n  compensable and provided medical treatment.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  receiving treatment for her injuries by several physicians, Sanders was\r\n  diagnosed with chondromalacia patella, the softening and degeneration of the\r\n  tissue underneath the kneecap.Â  Sanders was released from treatment on February\r\n  15, 2001.Â  At the time of her release, Sanders had returned to work without\r\n  restrictions, other than to avoid stooping, kneeling, and squatting whenever\r\n  possible.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  September of 2002, Sanders fell down stairs in her home and suffered an injury\r\n  to her knee as a result. Following this incident, Sanders received medical care\r\n  for her knee from Dr. Jeffrey Holman.Â  Sanders filed this claim seeking\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Wal-Mart contested liability for this injury,\r\n  asserting Sandersâ€™ September of 2002 fall in the home was an intervening act\r\n  unrelated to her previous work-related injury and was not compensable.Â Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found Sandersâ€™ knee injuries were causally\r\n  related to the original injury in June of 2000 and awarded Sanders temporary\r\n  total disability benefits and payment of her medical expenses.Â  \r\nWal-Mart appealed the findings of the single commissioner to the\r\n  Appellate Panel.Â  The Appellate Panel found the injuries in question were not\r\n  causally related to her work-related incident and reversed the order of the\r\n  single commissioner.Â  \r\nFollowing the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision, Sanders appealed to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The circuit court reversed and remanded the case to the\r\n  Appellate Panel for reinstatement of the single commissionerâ€™s order.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  Administrative Procedures Act establishes our standard of review of decisions\r\n  by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission. Accordingly, this court can reverse or modify the Appellate Panelâ€™s\r\n  decision only if the appellantâ€™s substantial rights have been prejudiced\r\n  because the decision is affected by an error of law or is clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Shealy v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 454, 535 S.E.2d 438, 442 (2000);\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(5) (Supp. 2007).Â  â€œSubstantial evidence is not a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence nor evidence viewed from one side, but such\r\n  evidence, when the whole record is considered, as would allow reasonable minds\r\n  to reach the conclusion the [Appellate Panel] reached.â€Â  Shealy, 341\r\n  S.C. at 455, 535 S.E.2d at 442.Â  The possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions does not prevent the Appellate Panelâ€™s conclusions from being\r\n  supported by substantial evidence.Â  Tiller v. Natâ€™l Health Care Ctr. of\r\n  Sumter, 334 S.C. 333, 338, 513 S.E.2d 843, 845 (1999).\r\nThe\r\n  Appellate Panel is the ultimate fact finder and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact.Â  Ross v. American Red Cross,&nbsp; 298 S.C. 490, 492,\r\n  381 S.E.2d 728, 730 (1989).Â  The final determination of witness credibility and\r\n  the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate Panel. Â Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Independent Intervening Cause\r\nWal-Mart\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in reversing the order of the Appellate Panel.Â \r\n  Specifically, Wal-Mart argues there was substantial evidence supporting the\r\n  Appellate Panelâ€™s finding that Sandersâ€™ injuries from her September of 2002\r\n  fall were not causally related to her work-related accident.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIt\r\n  is not disputed that Sandersâ€™ injuries from the initial fall at work are\r\n  compensable.Â  Indeed, Wal-Mart paid workersâ€™ compensation benefits and medical\r\n  expenses related to this incident.Â  The sole issue before the Appellate Panel\r\n  was whether Sandersâ€™ injuries arising out of her September of 2002 fall are\r\n  compensable.Â  As the Appellate Panel correctly noted, every natural consequence\r\n  which flows from a compensable injury,\r\n  unless the result of an independent intervening cause sufficient to break the\r\n  chain of causation, is compensable.Â  Whitfield v. Daniel Constr. Co.,\r\n  226 S.C. 37, 40-41, 83 S.E.2d 460, 462 (1954).Â  The key issue for the Appellate\r\n  Panelâ€™s determination was whether the September of 2002 fall was an\r\n  â€œindependent intervening cause.â€ \r\nIn\r\n  reversing the Appellate Panel, the circuit court held there was not sufficient\r\n  evidence to support the Panelâ€™s conclusion because â€œthere is no finding of fact\r\n  by the [Appellate Panel] that the Claimantâ€™s subsequent fall was an independent\r\n  cause.â€Â  Wal-Mart, however, argues the Appellate Panel did find Sandersâ€™\r\n  September of 2002 fall was independent of her work-related injury.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the substantial evidence standard, an appellate court looks for all evidence\r\n  which â€œwould allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the\r\n  administrative agency reached or must have reached in order to justify its\r\n  action.â€Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d\r\n  304, 306 (1981) (emphasis added). Â However, â€œif a material fact is contested,\r\n  the [Appellate Panel] must make a specific, express\r\n  finding on it.â€Â  Aristizabal v. I. J. Woodside-Division of Dan River, Inc.,\r\n  268 S.C. 366, 370-71, 234 S.E.2d 21, 23 (1977).Â  The findings of fact of the\r\n  Appellate Panel must be sufficiently detailed to enable the reviewing court to\r\n  determine (1) whether the law has\r\n  been properly applied to those findings and (2) whether the findings are\r\n  supported by the evidence. Â Brayboy v. Clark Heating Co., Inc., 306 S.C.\r\n  56, 58-59, 409 S.E.2d 767, 768 (1991). \r\nIn\r\n  the present case, we must determine whether the Appellate Panel properly\r\n  applied the standard articulated in Whitfield.Â  The sole issue before\r\n  the Appellate Panel was whether Sandersâ€™ September of 2002 fall was causally\r\n  related to the initial work-related accident.Â  The Appellate Panel recognized\r\n  the appropriate standard to be applied by citing and relying upon the holding\r\n  of Whitfield, stating, â€œEvery natural consequence which flows from a\r\n  compensable injury, unless the result of an independent intervening cause\r\n  sufficient to break the chain of causation, is compensable.â€Â  The Appellate\r\n  Panel found:Â  â€œClaimant sustained an intervening accident in September 2002.â€Â \r\n  It noted there was no evidence that Sandersâ€™ knee condition caused her to fall\r\n  at home.Â  In addition, it found â€œAll of her injuries from the initial injury of\r\n  June 14, 2000 had resolved, [Sanders] had returned to work with no\r\n  restrictions, and she was not given a permanency rating.Â  She did not seek\r\n  additional medical treatment for twenty (20) months.â€Â  \r\nLooking\r\n  at the language of the Appellate Panelâ€™s Order, we hold the findings\r\n  sufficiently indicate the Appellate Panel found the September of 2002 fall was\r\n  an â€œindependent intervening cause sufficient to break the chain of causationâ€\r\n  and thus the findings support the Appellate Panelâ€™s determination to deny\r\n  Sandersâ€™ claims for benefits.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred in reversing\r\n  the Appellate Panelâ€™s order for lack of such findings.Â Â Â  \r\nHaving\r\n  established the Appellate Panel found Sandersâ€™ September of 2002 fall was an\r\n  independent intervening cause, we now turn to whether this finding is supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.\r\nAt\r\n  the December 16, 2004 hearing, Sanders testified she was released from care for\r\n  the injuries immediately following her initial fall on February 15, 2001, and\r\n  from that time she did not seek care for her knee until after she fell in her\r\n  home in September of 2002.Â  Furthermore, in her November 7, 2002 deposition she\r\n  testified she was injured a week before she saw Dr. Holman when her knee â€œgave\r\n  outâ€ while she was coming down her steps at home, and prior to this occasion,\r\n  her knee had never given out before.Â  Sandersâ€™ testimony shows a definite gap\r\n  in time from the initial work-related injuries and the September of 2002 fall\r\n  where she did not need medical treatment for her knee and could work full duty\r\n  without restrictions.Â  Therefore, her testimony supports the finding the\r\n  September of 2002 fall was an independent intervening cause. \r\nIn\r\n  addition to Sandersâ€™ testimony, the expert testimony of Sandersâ€™ treating\r\n  physician, Dr. Holman, supports the conclusion the September of 2002 fall was\r\n  an independent intervening cause.Â  Dr. Holman testified Sanders was referred to\r\n  him by her family physician, and his first visit with her occurred on October\r\n  7, 2002.Â  Dr. Holman stated Sanders did not inform him of her subsequent fall\r\n  in the home, which occurred approximately one week before this visit, or that\r\n  following her initial work-related fall she returned to work full duty for\r\n  approximately twenty months. Â Upon hearing Sandersâ€™ testimony regarding these\r\n  facts in her deposition, Dr. Holman testified the knee problems he was treating\r\n  her for were related to the September of 2002 fall rather than her initial fall\r\n  at work.Â  He explained the two similar incidents might suggest that the\r\n  mechanism of the two falls was the same, so â€œeither she had a knee problem\r\n  before she fell at Wal-Mart or that she just slipped and fell on two\r\n  occasions.â€Â  Because of these two similar incidents, Dr. Holman testified he\r\n  could not state â€œwith a degree of medical certainty that her chondromalacia was\r\n  responsible for the missed step a week prior to my visit.â€Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on this evidence from the record, we hold there was substantial evidence to\r\n  support the Appellate Panelâ€™s finding the September of 2002 fall was an\r\n  independent intervening cause and thus Sandersâ€™ injuries arising from the fall\r\n  were not compensable.Â  Accordingly, we find the circuit court erred in\r\n  reversing the Appellate Panelâ€™s decision.\r\nII. Scrivenerâ€™s Error \r\nWal-Mart\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in holding the Appellate Panelâ€™s citation of\r\n  South Carolina Code Section 42-9-60 constituted reversible error.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nSection 42-9-60\r\n  provides: Â â€œNo compensation shall be\r\n  payable if the injury or death was occasioned by the intoxication of the\r\n  employee or by the wilful intention of the employee to injure or kill himself\r\n  or another.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  As the circuit court correctly\r\n  noted, there was no evidence showing Sanders was under the influence of\r\n  intoxication or possessed the intent to injure herself and the Appellate Panel\r\n  made no findings concerning such evidence.Â  \r\nWal-Mart\r\n  argues the Appellate Panelâ€™s citation of Section 42-9-60 was merely a\r\n  scrivenerâ€™s error, and instead the Panel intended to cite South Carolina Code\r\n  Section 42-15-60 (Supp. 2007), which\r\n  discusses medical benefits.Â  Indeed, the Appellate Panel cited to Section\r\n  42-9-60 when concluding Wal-Mart was only responsible for the medical care\r\n  Sanders received between June 14, 2000 and February 15, 2001.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with Wal-Mart and hold the Appellate Panelâ€™s use of Section 42-9-60 was a\r\n  scrivenerâ€™s error.Â  â€œAn error not shown to be prejudicial does not constitute\r\n  grounds for reversal.â€ Â JKT Co. v. Hardwick, 274 S.C. 413, 419, 265\r\n  S.E.2d 510, 513 (1980).Â  In the present case, the Appellate Panelâ€™s error in\r\n  citing Section 42-9-60 is not prejudicial.Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred\r\n  in reversing the Appellate Panel on these grounds.Â \r\nIII. Inappropriate Relief\r\nIn\r\n  its last argument, Wal-Mart asserts the circuit court erred in granting relief\r\n  that exceeds its authority.Â  As we have reversed the circuit courtâ€™s order for\r\n  the above-stated reasons, we need not address this issue.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, the order of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nPIEPER, J., and\r\n  CURETON, A.J., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument\r\n  pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4433","title":"New Hope Missionary Baptist Church v.

Rose and Emoray R. Waiters, allegedly on behalf\r\n  of the Church.[2] Â At some point, a payment of twenty-five thousand dollars was made from Church\r\n  funds to Paragon Builders.Â  Thereafter, the Church filed a declaratory judgment\r\n  action asking the court to determine the existence, validity, and\r\n  enforceability of the Contract. Â \r\nThe\r\n  Churchâ€™s complaint raised numerous issues regarding the validity of the\r\n  Contract, including the absence of any meeting of the minds, Paragon Buildersâ€™\r\n  lack of consideration, and the ambiguity of the Contract with regard to Paragon\r\n  Buildersâ€™ obligations.Â  The Church asserted the $25,000 payment and ensuing\r\n  deposit were not authorized by the Church but was â€œthe misguided action of the\r\n  church financial secretary acting ex officio.â€ The complaint\r\n  prayed for a refund of the $25,000 payment. Â \r\nThe\r\n  complaint contended neither Rose[3] nor Waiters was a â€œtrustee[] of the church nor were they authorized by the\r\n  church to enter into any such contract.â€ Â Waitersâ€™ signature was also claimed\r\n  to be a forgery. Â The Church contended the signatures on a blank page attached\r\n  to the Contract were â€œsimply a list of people who attended a meeting regarding\r\n  the contractâ€ and did not constitute a signature page which was part of the\r\n  Contract. Â The Church asserted the Contract â€œwas not approved by any vote of\r\n  the church or any authorized committee or organization of the churchâ€ and as\r\n  such does not bind the Church. Â \r\nParagon\r\n  Builders timely answered denying the Church was entitled to a declaratory\r\n  judgment or a refund. Â The Answer also pled an affirmative defense pursuant to\r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, that the Church failed to state a claim upon which relief\r\n  can be granted, and that the Churchâ€™s claims were subject to arbitration under\r\n  the Contract.\r\n\r\nOn\r\n  July 3, 2006, Paragon Builders filed a Motion to Compel Arbitration and Dismiss\r\n  or Stay the Complaint. Â The motion was heard on October 9, 2006, and\r\n  subsequently denied. Â The trial court held, â€œ[u]nder the Federal Arbitration\r\n  Act and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-10, before arbitration may be compelled, there\r\n  must be a determination that there was an agreement between the parties,â€ and\r\n  this was the very issue the Church contested. Â The trial court further held,\r\n  â€œuntil there is a determination by the Court as to whether or not the parties\r\n  had an agreement, arbitration cannot be compelled.â€ Â Paragon Builders now\r\n  appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnless the parties otherwise provide, the question of the\r\n  arbitrability of a claim is an issue for judicial determination. Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â \r\n  Appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is subject to de novo\r\n  review. Chassereau v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 171, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 718, 720 (2007). Â Nevertheless, a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings will\r\n  not be reversed on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports the findings. Thornton v. Trident Med. Ctr., L.L.C., 357 S.C. 91, 94, 592 S.E.2d 50, 51 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nParagon\r\n  Builders claims the trial court erred in denying its Motion to Compel\r\n  Arbitration brought pursuant to Section 15-48-20(a) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2005).Â  Specifically, Paragon Builders asserts the Contractâ€™s arbitration\r\n  clause requires disputes arising out of the Contract be resolved through\r\n  arbitration.Â  Pursuant to Prima Paint Corp. v. Flood &amp; Conklin Mfg. Co.,\r\n  388 U.S. 395 (1967), and The Housing Authority of City of Columbia v.\r\n    Cornerstone Housing, L.L.C., 356 S.C. 328, 588 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2003), we\r\n  find the trial court erred in denying Paragon Buildersâ€™ Motion to Compel\r\n  Arbitration since the Church failed to specifically challenge the arbitration\r\n  agreement.\r\nSection\r\n  15-48-10(a) of the South Carolina Code (2005) states, â€œ[a] written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration\r\n  or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy\r\n  thereafter arising between the parties is valid, enforceable and irrevocable,\r\n  save upon such grounds as exist at law or in equity for the revocation of any\r\n  contract.â€Â  The Legislature also provided that:\r\n\r\n\tOn application of a party showing an [arbitration] agreement\r\n  described in Â§ 15-48-10,\r\n  and the opposing partyâ€™s refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the\r\n  parties to proceed with arbitration, but if the opposing party denies the\r\n  existence of the agreement to arbitrate, the court shall proceed summarily to\r\n  the determination of the issue so raised and shall order arbitration if found\r\n  for the moving party, otherwise, the application shall be denied.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a)\r\n  (2005).Â  An order denying a motion to compel arbitration[4] made under Section 15-48-20 is immediately appealable. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-48-200(a)(1) (2005); Towles v. United HealthCare Corp., 338 S.C. 29,\r\n  35, 524 S.E.2d 839, 842-43 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAs a\r\n  preliminary note, we find the trial court properly determined the Federal\r\n  Arbitration Act (â€œFAAâ€) applies to the arbitration agreement in this matter\r\n  since the parties did not contract to the contrary and the arbitration\r\n  agreement pertains to a transaction involving interstate commerce due to the\r\n  nature of the construction project, Paragon Buildersâ€™ position as chief\r\n  construction advisor, and Paragon Buildersâ€™ affidavit swearing the project will\r\n  involve businesses and supplies from outside South Carolina. Munoz v. Green\r\n    Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538-39, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363 (2001) (â€œUnless\r\n  the parties have contracted to the contrary, the FAA applies in federal or\r\n  state courts to any arbitration agreement regarding a transaction that in fact\r\n  involves interstate commerce, regardless of whether or not the parties\r\n  contemplated an interstate transaction.â€); Episcopal Hous. Corp. v. Federal\r\n    Ins. Co., 269 S.C. 631, 640, 239 S.E.2d 647, 652 (1977) (â€œIt would be\r\n  virtually impossible to construct an eighteen (18) story apartment building\r\n  between 1971 and 1973 with materials, equipment and supplies all produced and\r\n  manufactured solely within the State of South Carolina.â€); Blanton v.\r\n    Stathos, 351 S.C. 534, 540-41, 570 S.E.2d 565, 568-69 (Ct. App. 2002)\r\n  (holding Blantonâ€™s affidavit asserting the contract affected interstate\r\n  commerce, Stathosâ€™s failure to dispute the affidavit, and the nature of the construction\r\n  project were sufficient to uphold the decision of the circuit court that the\r\n  contract evinces a transaction involving interstate commerce); Towles, 338\r\n  S.C. at 36, 524 S.E.2d at 843 (â€œBecause interstate commerce is involved, the\r\n  FAA applies and displaces South Carolinaâ€™s Uniform Arbitration Act.â€) (citing Soil\r\n    Remediation Co. v. Nu-Way Envtl., Inc., 323 S.C. 454, 459-60, 476 S.E.2d\r\n  149, 152 (1996)).\r\nArbitration\r\n  is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to submit to arbitration\r\n  any dispute which he has not agreed to submit. Zabinski v. Bright Acres\r\n    Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001); Aiken v. World\r\n      Fin. Corp. of S.C., 373 S.C. 144, 149, 644 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2007); Chassereau\r\n        v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 171-72, 644 S.E.2d 718, 720\r\n  (2007).Â  Since the Church contends a valid, enforceable contract does not\r\n  exist, this is no doubt one reason why the trial court denied Paragon Buildersâ€™\r\n  Motion to Compel Arbitration until the court could determine whether or not the\r\n  parties had an agreement.Â  However, further examination of case law from the\r\n  United States Supreme Court and the South Carolina Supreme Court yields the\r\n  surprising result that when a party argues fraud in the inducement of an entire\r\n  contract, but not the arbitration agreement itself, arbitration cannot be\r\n  avoided. Prima Paint, 388 U.S. 395; S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great\r\n    Western Coal, Inc., 312 S.C. 559, 437 S.E.2d 22 (1993); Jackson Mills,\r\n      Inc. v. BT Capital Corp., 312 S.C. 400, 440 S.E.2d 877 (1994); Cornerstone\r\n        Hous., 356 S.C. 328, 588 S.E.2d 617 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn Prima\r\n  Paint, 388 U.S. at 403-04, the United States Supreme Court held that\r\n  general allegations of fraud in the inducement of a contract are insufficient\r\n  to prevent the invocation of a contractâ€™s arbitration clause.Â  The court\r\n  referenced Section 4[5] of the FAA and concluded that with respect to cases evidencing transactions in\r\n  commerce:\r\n\r\n\tif the\r\n  claim is fraud in the inducement[6] of the arbitration clause itself â€“ an issue which goes to the â€˜makingâ€™ of the\r\n  agreement to arbitrate â€“ the federal court may proceed to adjudicate it . . . [b]ut\r\n  the statutory language does not permit the federal court to consider claims of\r\n  fraud in the inducement of the contract generally. \r\n\r\n388 U.S. at 403-04.Â  In Great Western Coal, Inc., 312 S.C. at 562-63, 437 S.E.2d at 24 (emphasis\r\n  added), the South Carolina Supreme Court explained how the rule of Prima\r\n    Paint should be applied by our courts:\r\n\r\n\tWe join the jurisdictions which have rejected limiting the holding\r\n  in Prima Paint. Â We hold a party cannot avoid arbitration through\r\n  rescission of the entire contract when there\r\n  is no independent challenge to the arbitration clause. Fraud as a\r\n  defense to an arbitration clause must be fraud specifically as to the\r\n  arbitration clause and not the contract generally.\r\n\r\nA party may\r\n  allege the arbitration agreement was never entered into and â€œunder such\r\n  circumstances, a challenge to the existence of the arbitration agreement itself\r\n  becomes a matter to be â€˜forthwith and summarily triedâ€™ by the Court.â€ Jackson\r\n    Mills, 312 S.C. at 404, 440 S.E.2d at 879 (citations omitted).\r\nIn its complaint, at the hearing, and in its brief to this court,\r\n  the Church does not specifically allege the arbitration clause in the Contract\r\n  is invalid, unenforceable, or does not exist. Â Instead, the Church argues it\r\n  has numerous grounds on which the Contract is invalid and that â€œthe\r\n  Contract simply does not exist as a Contractâ€ in part because of Roseâ€™s\r\n  inability to bind the Church. \r\nWe acknowledge the United States Supreme Court has identified\r\n  certain limited circumstances in which â€œcourts assume that the parties intended\r\n  courts, not arbitrators, to decide a particular arbitration-related matter (in\r\n  the absence of â€˜clear and unmistakableâ€™ evidence to the contrary).â€ Green\r\n    Tree Fin. Corp. v. Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 452 (2003).Â  These â€œgateway\r\n  mattersâ€ include whether the parties have a valid arbitration agreement or\r\n  whether a binding arbitration clause applies to a certain type of controversy. Id.Â  However, in the present case we are not confronted with the question of whether\r\n  an arbitration agreement encompasses a certain dispute[7] or whether the arbitration agreement\r\n  is invalid. Instead, we have been presented with the question of whether arbitration\r\n  should be compelled when a contractâ€™s validity has been challenged.\r\nCommon sense implies that if a party challenged the validity of a\r\n  contract which contained an arbitration clause, the validity of the arbitration\r\n  clause is also challenged.Â  The courts have found otherwise.Â  â€œArbitration clauses\r\n  are separable[8] from the contracts in which they are imbedded.â€ Jackson Mills, 312 S.C.\r\n  at 403, 440 S.E.2d at 879 (citing Prima Paint, 388 U.S. at 402).Â  An arbitration clauseâ€™s validity is distinct from the substantive validity\r\n  of the contract as a whole. Cornerstone Hous., 356 S.C. at 338, 588\r\n  S.E.2d at 622 (citing Munoz, 343 S.C. at 540, 542 S.E.2d at 364). â€œEven\r\n  if the overall contract is unenforceable, the arbitration provision is not\r\n  unenforceable unless the reason the overall contract is unenforceable\r\n  specifically relates to the arbitration provision.â€ Cornerstone Hous.,\r\n  356 S.C. at 340, 588 S.E.2d at 623.Â  \r\nThe policies of the United States and this State favor arbitration\r\n  of disputes. Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 351 S.C. 606, 610-11,\r\n  571 S.E.2d 711, 713-14 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2002); Tritech Elec.,\r\n    Inc. v. Frank M. Hall &amp; Co., 343 S.C. 396, 399, 540 S.E.2d 864, 865 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation\r\n  omitted); Towles, 338 S.C. at 37, 524 S.E.2d at 844.Â  â€œThe FAA was designed â€˜to overrule the judiciaryâ€™s long-standing\r\n  refusal to enforce agreements to arbitrate.â€™â€ Volt Info. Sciences, Inc. v. Bd.\r\n    of Trustees of Leland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 478 (1989) (citation\r\n  omitted).Â  The Churchâ€™s argument that the entire Contract is invalid can be\r\n  considered at the arbitration itself. Cornerstone Hous., 356 S.C. at\r\n  340, 588 S.E.2d at 623; see Bazzle, 539 U.S. 444, 453 (noting arbitrators are well suited to address issues such as contract\r\n  interpretation and arbitration procedures).\r\nWe further acknowledge that â€œwhere there has been no agreement to\r\n  arbitrate, a party cannot be forced into compulsory arbitration.â€ Hilton\r\n    Head Resort Four Seasons Ctr. Horizontal Prop. Regime Council v. Resort Inv. Corp.,\r\n  311 S.C. 394, 397-98, 429 S.E.2d 459, 462 (Ct. App. 1993) (citation omitted).Â  Again,\r\n  precedent forces a distinction to be drawn between disputes in which a party\r\n  challenges the arbitration agreement itself and disputes in which only the\r\n  overall contract is challenged.Â  See Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach,\r\n    Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 23-24, 644 S.E.2d 663, 668 (2007) (holding the trial\r\n  court was the proper forum for determining the enforceability of the\r\n  arbitration clause in the contract because â€œ[a]lthough the clause specifically\r\n  stated that arbitration applied to issues involving â€˜the validity and scope of\r\n  this contract,â€™ Simpson challenged the validity of the arbitration provision on\r\n  grounds of unconscionability, bringing into question whether an arbitration\r\n  agreement even existed in the first placeâ€); Cornerstone Hous., 356 S.C.\r\n  at 338-42, 588 S.E.2d at 622-24 (holding because a party did not directly\r\n  challenge the arbitration agreement in either of the two contracts, the\r\n  legality and enforceability of the contracts is an issue for the arbitrator to\r\n  decide).Â  Indeed, even Section 15-48-20(a) of the South Carolina Code (2005)\r\n  notes when a party presents a court with an arbitration agreement and the\r\n  opposing partyâ€™s refusal to arbitrate, the court shall order the parties to\r\n  proceed with arbitration unless â€œthe opposing party denies the existence of the agreement to arbitrate.â€ S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a) (2005) (emphasis added).Â  Unlike\r\n  the cases argued by the Church, the matter presently before us does not raise\r\n  the issue of whether the arbitration clause in Article 2 of the Contract is\r\n  invalid.Â  Accordingly, the order of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED. \r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., concurs. \r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\nPIEPER, J., dissenting:\r\nI respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my opinion, this case involves more than a situation where a party\r\n  alleges fraud in the inducement of just the contract itself, as opposed to\r\n  challenging the arbitration provision of the contract.Â  I believe the Church\r\n  has raised a colorable claim that there was no arbitration agreement by\r\n  alleging the signer of the agreement had neither the authority to agree to the\r\n  contract itself, nor the authority to agree to the arbitration provision.\r\nI fully support the\r\n  policy in favor of arbitration and will not resort to citation of the law in\r\n  this regard.Â  I believe the majority opinion fully recounts the applicable\r\n  law.Â  However, the majority notes that where there has been no agreement to\r\n  arbitrate, a party cannot be forced to do so.Â  I believe further clarification\r\n  of the law in this area is necessary.Â  Based on the facts of this case, I find\r\n  it very problematic that a person, without authority, may set out to not only\r\n  bind another to a contract, but also to arbitration without the right to do so,\r\n  and without a preliminary court determination on the issue of the authority to\r\n  bind (i.e. the existence of the agreement to arbitrate).Â  Under the facts\r\n  herein, I respectfully believe this case falls within that type of â€œgateway\r\n  matterâ€ ripe for a judicial determination as to the existence of the agreement\r\n  to arbitrate.Â  See Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C.\r\n  14, 22, 644 S.E.2d 663, 667 (2007) (stating where one party denies the\r\n  existence of an arbitration agreement raised by an opposing party, a court must\r\n  immediately determine whether the agreement exists in the first place); see\r\n    also 9 U.S.C.A. Â§ 4 (2008) (wherein the Federal Arbitration Act directs the\r\n  court to summarily determine the existence of the arbitration agreement if it\r\n  is at issue); accord S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-20(a) (2005).Â  \r\nMoreover, the circuit\r\n  court did not rule that arbitration may not eventually result; instead, the\r\n  court concluded that a preliminary and threshold determination must be made\r\n  about the existence of an agreement to arbitrate.Â  Once that threshold\r\n  determination is made, I do not read the courtâ€™s order as precluding\r\n  arbitration if the issue as to the authority to enter the agreement to\r\n  arbitrate is determined adversely to the Church.Â  Therefore, I agree with the\r\n  assertion by the Church in its brief that the appeal is premature.\r\nAccordingly, I\r\n  would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In the Record on Appeal, a single page bearing\r\n  twenty-eight signatures has been attached to the Contract. Â The page bears no\r\n  identifying marks or explanation regarding the identity of the twenty-eight\r\nsignatories or why twenty-eight individuals signed the blank sheet of paper. \r\n[3] The Church further explained that although Rose was\r\n  the pastor when the Contract was signed, there was an ongoing dispute with Rose\r\n  at that time, and â€œninety-nine percent of the activity that related to this\r\n  Contract took place directly between the pastor and the contractor,â€ without\r\nany information being relayed to the Church. \r\n[4] This court also recently dealt with a motion to\r\n  compel arbitration in Partain v. Upstate Automotive Group, Op. No. 4373\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed April 23, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.

MalloyÂ  McEachin, of Florence, for\r\n          Respondent-Appellants.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: In\r\n  this case, the trial court granted a new trial and issued sanctions for contempt.Â \r\n  We affirm in part and reverse in part. \r\nFACTS\r\nThis\r\n  case arises from a motor vehicle accident. A tractor trailer truck driven by\r\n  Bobby Connor (Connor)[1] made a turn while on a detour road.Â  While making the turn, Connor traversed\r\n  into the opposing lane of travel.Â  Leroy E. Capps and Harriette Capps\r\n  (collectively the Capps) were traveling in the opposing lane when the tractor\r\n  trailer collided with the Cappsâ€™ vehicle.Â  The Capps filed suit against Connor\r\n  and the South Carolina Department of Transportation (the SCDOT).[2]\r\nAs a\r\n  basis of their suit, the Capps alleged the SCDOT: (1) knowingly selected a\r\n  route which could not safely accommodate tractor trailers because the tractor\r\n  trailers would encroach into the opposing lane of travel; (2) failed to place\r\n  advance warning signs alerting oncoming motorists of this danger; and (3)\r\n  failed to modify the detour route to make it safer or failed to choose a safer\r\n  alternative route.Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  the trial, the SCDOT attempted to assert Connorâ€™s superseding negligence as a\r\n  defense.Â  In support of this defense, the SCDOT retained the services of Joe\r\n  Kent (Kent).Â  Kent is an expert in accident reconstruction and highway\r\n  engineering related to accidents.Â  Kent testified that an accident report was\r\n  important in forming the foundation for his opinions.Â  \r\nWhen asked what factors within the accident report he relied on in\r\n  arriving at his conclusion, Kent responded, â€œThe orientation of the vehicles\r\n  and the motion of the vehicles. . . . There was also an estimated speed . . .\r\n  of 45 [MPH] for Mr. Capps and five [MPH] for Mr. Conner. . . . I also noted\r\n  (sic) that from this report that Mr. Conner was cited for failure to yield\r\n  right of way.â€Â  The Capps immediately moved for a mistrial, arguing evidence of\r\n  whether Connor received a ticket was inadmissible.Â  The trial court denied the\r\n  Cappsâ€™ motion for a mistrial but did issue a curative instruction to the jury.Â \r\n  Additionally, the trial court issued contempt sanctions in the amount of $1,500\r\n  against Kent.Â  Initially, the trial court ordered Kent to pay this amount to\r\n  the Florence County Humane Society.Â  Subsequently, the trial court determined\r\n  that payment to the Humane Society did â€œnot further the ends of justiceâ€ and\r\n  ordered payment be made to the Cappsâ€™ counsel.Â Â Â  \r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of the SCDOT.Â  The Capps\r\n  moved for a new trial pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP, and separately under the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine. The Capps specifically asked the trial court to\r\n  reconsider its denial of the Cappsâ€™ motion for a mistrial.Â  The trial court\r\n  granted the Cappsâ€™ motion for a new trial.Â  Kent and the SCDOT appeal the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s rulings.Â  We address each partiesâ€™ argument in turn. \r\nA. Kentâ€™s\r\n  appeal \r\nKent argues the trial court committed reversible error when it issued contempt sanctions\r\n  against him.Â  We agree.[3]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of contempt ordinarily rests within the sound discretion of the\r\n  trial judge.Â  State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994).Â \r\n  Contempt is an extreme measure and the power to find an individual in contempt\r\n  is not to be lightly asserted.Â  Id. at\r\n  128, 447 S.E.2d at 216. Â Contempt results from the willful disobedience of a court order\r\n  and before a person may be held in contempt, the record must be clear and\r\n  specific as to acts or conduct upon which the contempt is based.Â  Id. at 129, 447 S.E.2d at 217. A willful act is an act â€œdone voluntarily and\r\n  intentionally with the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with\r\n  the specific intent to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that\r\n  is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.â€Â  Id. (internal quotations omitted).Â  If the primary purpose of the sanctions imposed\r\n  is to preserve the courtâ€™s authority and to punish for disobedience of its\r\n  orders, the contempt is considered criminal.Â  Id. at 128, 447 S.E.2d at\r\n  217.Â  Conversely, if the purpose of the sanctions is to coerce obedience to a\r\n  court order, the contempt is civil.Â  Id. at 129, 447 S.E.2d at 217.\r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, the trial court issued contempt sanctions upon Kent on the basis that Kent deliberately gave inadmissible testimony in the form of Connorâ€™s\r\n  citation.Â  In issuing contempt sanctions, the trial court reasoned that Kent had substantial and continuous involvement in court proceedings as an expert witness\r\n  over a number of years and should have known that evidence regarding a citation\r\n  was inadmissible.Â  The following colloquy during the trial indicates the trial\r\n  court made no inquiry to determine Kentâ€™s knowledge regarding the admissibility\r\n  or inadmissibility of a citation.Â  \r\n\r\n  Q: Did you . . . review . . . the accident\r\n    report in regard to this case? \r\n  [Kent]: I did. \r\n  Q: Did that . . . have any significance to\r\n    you in your evaluation?Â  \r\n  A: It does.Â  It has basically a description\r\n    of the vehicles.Â  It has a description of the motions of the vehicles and also\r\n    it helps clarify the pictures of the accident scene taken by the State Patrol\r\n    right after that accident that I reviewed.Â  And it reveals in the narrative\r\n    portion--\r\n  [Counsel for the Capps]: Iâ€™m going to\r\n    object.Â  Thatâ€™s hearsay, if your honor please.\r\n  [Counsel for the SCDOT]: Your honor, may I\r\n    respond now?\r\n  The Court: Yes, sir.\r\n  [Counsel for the SCDOT]: Let me get the\r\n    rule out but under the rule an expert is entitled to rely on hearsay.\r\n  The Court: There is a distinction between\r\n    relying on it and publishing it counsel. \r\n  [Counsel for the Capps]: Plus thereâ€™s a\r\n    specific statute.\r\n  The Court: What says [sic] you? What say\r\n    you to that?\r\n  [Counsel for the SCDOT]: Your honor I think\r\n    he would be entitled to testify if he had figures regarding speed for\r\n    instance.Â  I think he would be able to rely on that and say thatâ€™s what he\r\n    relied on in regard to â€“ to a speed.Â  I think he would be able to testify as to\r\n    how he arrived at his opinion just as the plaintiffâ€™s expert testified relying\r\n    on hearsay.\r\n  The Court: All right. Counsel, Iâ€™m going\r\n    to overrule your objection and allow that.Â  Again the basis of his\r\n    opinion is for the jury to determine whether or not that opinion is credible or\r\n    believable.Â  The court will allow that.Â  You may proceed [Counsel for the\r\n    SCDOT].\r\n  [Counsel for the SCDOT]: Thank you, your\r\n    honor.\r\n  Q: In . . . examining the accident report\r\n    were there factors that you relied on in arriving at your conclusion in this\r\n    case?\r\n  A: There were.\r\n  Q: All right, sir. And . . . what were\r\n    those? \r\n  A: The orientation of the vehicles and the\r\n    motion of the vehicles as described in the narrative portion and as shown in\r\n    the diagram.Â  There also was an estimated speed listed by the investigating\r\n    officer of 45 miles per hour for Mr. Capps and fives miles an hour for Mr.\r\n    Conner who was driving the tractor trailer who pulled out onto Highway 51.Â  I\r\n    also noted that â€“ from this report that Mr. Conner was cited for failure to\r\n    yield right of way. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added)\r\nBased\r\n  upon the testimony at trial and the evidence in the record, we find there is\r\n  not sufficient evidence to suggest that Kent, in fact, knew the testimony was\r\n  inadmissible or that he willfully disobeyed a court order.Â  See Curlee\r\n    v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 918 (1982) (â€œContempt results\r\n  from the willful disobedience of an order of the court, and before a person may\r\n  be held in contempt, the record must be clear and specific as to the acts or\r\n  conduct upon which such finding is based.â€); see also State v.\r\n    Passmore, 363 S.C. 568, 571-72, 611 S.E.2d 273, 275 (Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (applying the requirement of willfulness in the context of criminal contempt).Â  Â Furthermore, there was no court order\r\n  forbidding Kentâ€™s testimony.Â  In fact, the trial court allowed Kent to testify after overruling the Cappsâ€™ objection regarding Kentâ€™s ability to rely on the narrative portion of the accident\r\n  report.Â  Kent was not asked a question to which there was a sustained objection\r\n  and thereafter answered without a ruling from the trial court.Â  Rather, the\r\n  trial court overruled the objection and allowed Kent to testify. Â \r\nWhile we are mindful of the trial courtâ€™s concern and recognize\r\n  the possibility of such knowledge of inadmissible evidence by an individual who\r\n  regularly appears in court, we nonetheless find the extent of such knowledge\r\n  for the purposes of determining willfulness must be sufficiently established by\r\n  the record prior to an imposition of a contempt sanction.Â  Â The extent of Kentâ€™s knowledge was not established in\r\n  the record and may not be established by speculation.Â  Accordingly, we must\r\n  confine our review to the record presented.Â  Thus, we hold the trial courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  impose contempt sanctions upon Kent lacks\r\n  evidentiary support and we reverse the sanction.[4] Â Â Â Having adjudicated Kentâ€™s appeal, we now turn our attention to the\r\n  SCDOTâ€™s appeal.\r\nB. The SCDOTâ€™s\r\n  appeal\r\nThe\r\n  SCDOT appeals the trial courtâ€™s grant of a new trial arguing the court\r\n  misapplied the thirteenth juror doctrine and the courtâ€™s application of the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine was controlled by an error of law.Â  We need not\r\n  address this issue.\r\nIn the instant case, the trial court granted a new trial based on two separate grounds: (1) pursuant to Rule 59,\r\n  SCRCP; and (2) pursuant to the courtâ€™s authority under the thirteenth juror\r\n  doctrine.Â  On appeal, the\r\n  SCDOT challenges only one of these grounds: the trial courtâ€™s reliance on the\r\n  thirteenth juror doctrine.Â  Since the\r\n  trial court granted a new trial based on Rule 59, SCRCP, and separately under\r\n  the thirteenth juror doctrine, we\r\n  must affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision to grant a new trial on the basis of\r\n  Rule 59, SCRCP, because that independent ground for a new trial was not also\r\n  appealed.Â  See Anderson v.\r\n    Short, 323 S.C. 522, 525, 476 S.E.2d 475, 477 (1996) (holding when a\r\n  decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will affirm\r\n  unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground will\r\n  become the law of the case). \r\nNotwithstanding,\r\n  even if we were to review the courtâ€™s use of the thirteenth juror doctrine, we nonetheless\r\n  would affirm since the court possesses broad, inherent authority to grant a new\r\n  trial for any prejudicial errors committed during the trial as a matter of\r\n  fundamental fairness.Â  See Howard v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 316 S.C. 445, 449, 450 S.E.2d 582, 584-85 (1994) (holding the court may order a\r\n  new trial based upon the erroneous admission of testimony when the record shows\r\n  error and prejudice).Â  Moreover, the court retains the inherent authority to\r\n  reconsider its denial of the motion for a mistrial.Â Â  \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  CONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.[5]\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J., concurring in part and dissenting in part by separate opinion:\r\nI\r\n  respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion the trial courtâ€™s ruling should be\r\n  affirmed in full since the record provides evidence supporting the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s issuance of civil contempt sanctions against Kent.\r\nâ€œA\r\n  determination of contempt is a serious matter and should be imposed sparingly;\r\n  whether it is or is not imposed is within the discretion of the trial judge,\r\n  which will not be disturbed on appeal unless it is without evidentiary\r\n  support.â€&nbsp; Haselwood v. Sullivan, 283 S.C. 29, 32-33, 320 S.E.2d\r\n  499, 501 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  A decision regarding contempt should be reversed\r\n  only if it lacks evidentiary support or the trial judge has abused his\r\n  discretion. Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, 295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840,\r\n  840 (1988).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts and is essential to\r\n  preservation of order in judicial proceedings.â€ Browning v. Browning,\r\n  366 S.C. 255, 262, 621 S.E.2d 389, 392 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  A courtâ€™s ability to\r\n  find someone in contempt â€œis essential to the preservation of order in judicial\r\n  proceedings, and to the enforcement of the judgments, orders, and writs of the\r\n  courts; and consequently to the due administration of justice.â€ In re Terry,\r\n  128 U.S. 289, 303 (1888) (citations omitted), quoted with approval in Miller\r\n    v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 453, 652 S.E.2d 754, 759 (Ct. App. 2007).&nbsp;\r\n  Those who commit offenses calculated to obstruct, degrade, and undermine the\r\n  administration of justice are subject to the courtâ€™s inherent authority to levy\r\n  contempt, and this power cannot be abridged.Â  State ex rel. McLeod v. Hite,\r\n  272 S.C. 303, 305, 251 S.E.2d 746, 747 (1979).Â  Without the power to find\r\n  individuals in contempt of court, â€œthe administration of the law would be in\r\n  continual danger of being thwarted by the lawless.â€ Miller, 375 S.C. at\r\n  453-54, 652 S.E.2d at 759 (citing Terry, 128 U.S. at 303).Â  \r\nContempt\r\n  results from the willful disobedience of a court order. Lindsay v. Lindsay,\r\n  328 S.C. 329, 345, 491 S.E.2d 583, 592 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  A willful act is one\r\n  â€œdone voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something\r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law\r\n  requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or\r\n  disregard the law.â€ Spartanburg County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v.\r\n    Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988) (citing Blackâ€™s Law\r\n  Dictionary 1434 (5th ed. 1979)).Â  The determination of contempt\r\n  ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of the trial judge. &nbsp;State\r\n    v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\n  &nbsp;â€œA finding of contempt . . . must be reflected in a record that is â€˜clear\r\n  and specific as to the acts or conduct upon which such finding is\r\n  based.â€™â€&nbsp; Tirado v. Tirado, 339 S.C. 649, 654, 530 S.E.2d 128, 131\r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, 382, 287 S.E.2d\r\n  915, 918 (1982)). &nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  majority holds the record lacks evidence demonstrating Kent knew a traffic citation is inadmissible in a court of law.Â  I disagree.Â  The majorityâ€™s finding\r\n  disregards the courtroom experience Kent presented while being qualified as an\r\n  expert witness.Â  During his qualification as an expert witness, Kent explained he has testified â€œa couple of hundredâ€ times in â€œthe areas of accident\r\n  reconstruction and roadway effect on vehicular accidents.â€Â  Kent further explained he has evaluated accidents for twenty-two years and even formed his own\r\n  engineering firm that engages in accident reconstruction.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record also evinces the willfulness of Kentâ€™s utterance.Â  Ignoring his prior\r\n  courtroom experience, Kent was still aware of the inadmissibility of accident\r\n  reports since immediately before he announced, â€œI also noted that â€“ from this\r\n  report that Mr. Conner was cited for failure to yield right of way,â€ the Cappsâ€™\r\n  counsel made a hearsay objection to the narrative portion of the accident\r\n  report being published to the jury and the parties argued about the parameters\r\n  of Kentâ€™s testimony.Â  In the ongoing discussion, the trial court noted â€œthere\r\n  is a distinction between relying on [the accident report] and publishing it [to\r\n  the jury].â€Â  The Cappsâ€™ counsel also mentioned that a statute prohibits\r\n  publishing an accident report to the jury.Â  Indeed, Kent displayed his\r\n  familiarity with the rules of court by admitting he misspoke and stating he had\r\n  never done that before.Â  After Kentâ€™s statement and the ensuing objection, the\r\n  jury was removed from the courtroom while the Cappsâ€™ counsel argued for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  The attorney for SCDOT responded by stating, â€œI didnâ€™t know that was\r\n  coming in at that time, your Honor.â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority also disregards the trial courtâ€™s extensive explanations to the jury\r\n  regarding the contemptuous conduct and Kentâ€™s willfulness in disclosing\r\n  Connorâ€™s citation to the jury. â€œ[B]efore a court may find a person in contempt,\r\n  the record must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.â€ Widman\r\n    v. Widman, 348 S.C. 97, 119, 557 S.E.2d 693, 705 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  The\r\n  trial court patiently explained to the jury its belief Kent knew the comment was inappropriate and still deliberately mentioned the citation with the\r\n  knowledge that â€œevidence of whether or not a citation was issued is just\r\n  inadmissible in any civil trial.â€Â  In assessing sanctions against Kent for civil contempt, the trial court explained Kent made a â€œleap far beyond what the court would\r\n  ever allow in an intentional way from a witness whoâ€™s testified many times . .\r\n  . [and] would well know that evidentiary rule.â€Â  The trial court also cited Kentâ€™s demeanor, which cannot be reviewed on appeal, as support for holding him in civil\r\n  contempt. \r\nThe\r\n  majority does not fully address whether the sanctions against Kent constituted civil or criminal contempt.Â  I would find the sanctions were civil in nature.Â  â€œThe\r\n  determination of whether contempt is criminal or civil depends upon the\r\n  underlying purpose of the contempt ruling.â€ Miller, 375 S.C. at 456, 652\r\n  S.E.2d at 761.Â  â€œIn contempt cases, both civil and criminal relief have aspects\r\n  that can be seen as either remedial or punitive or both: when a court imposes\r\n  fines and punishments on a contemnor, it is not only vindicating its legal\r\n  authority to enter the initial court order, but it also is seeking to give\r\n  effect to the lawâ€™s purpose of modifying the contemnorâ€™s behavior to conform to\r\n  the terms required in the order.â€ Hicks v. Feiock, 485 U.S. 624, 635 (1988).Â  â€œIf the sanction is a fine, it is remedial and civil if paid to the\r\n  complainant even though the contemnor has no opportunity to purge himself of\r\n  the fine.â€ Miller, 375 S.C. at 457, 652 S.E.2d at 761 (citing Floyd\r\n    v. Floyd, 365 S.C. 56, 75-76, 615 S.E.2d 465, 475-76 (Ct. App. 2005)).\r\nThe\r\n  trial court never referred to the sanctions as criminal contempt.Â  To the\r\n  contrary, the trial court made efforts to indicate the contempt was civil in\r\n  its order denying reconsideration of the sanctions when it stated, â€œthe Court\r\n  has determined that payment to the Humane Society does not further the ends of\r\n  justice in this case, and instead directs that the payment be made to\r\n  Plaintiffâ€™s counsel, to be credited against the costs of making and prosecuting\r\n  the motion for a new trial.â€Â  See Hicks, at 631 (â€œIf it is for civil contempt the punishment is remedial, and\r\n  for the benefit of the complainant.â€); Jarrell v. Petoseed Co.,\r\n  331 S.C. 207, 209, 500 S.E.2d 793, 794 (Ct. App. 1998) (â€œCivil contempt sanctions serve two\r\n  functions: to coerce future compliance and to remedy past noncompliance.â€).Â  In\r\n  addition to compensating the Capps for Kentâ€™s wrongful conduct, the remedial\r\n  sanction issued by the trial court also resulted in Kentâ€™s continued testimony\r\n  without further mention of the citation issued to Connor.\r\nIn\r\n  light of this courtâ€™s standard of review, the support found in the record, and\r\n  the clear explanations given by the trial court, I would affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  order in full.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The trial courtâ€™s order spells Connorâ€™s name as\r\n  â€œC-o-n-n-o-râ€ but the court reporter spells his last name as â€œC-o-n-n-e-r.â€Â  We\r\n  will use the former in the opinion except when we quote directly from the\r\n  record.Â  \r\n[2] The Capps pursued a case against Connor in federal\r\n  district court.Â  \r\n[3] The Capps contend this issue is not preserved for\r\n  review; we disagree.Â  The issue of whether the sanctions were proper was raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court; thus, it is preserved for our review.Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke,\r\n  330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding for an issue to be preserved for appeal it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge).\r\n[4] The dissent characterizes the nature of the contempt\r\n  involved as civil, rather than criminal. Â Although the trial judge never\r\n  characterized the contempt as civil or criminal, the movant proceeded as if it\r\n  were criminal contempt and filed a motion asking the trial court to â€œreconsider\r\n  the criminal contempt order.â€Â  The trial court ultimately issued an order\r\n  denying reconsideration of the â€œsanctionâ€ imposed but modified its decision as\r\n  to the payee of the monetary sanction.Â  Arguably, modification of the sanction\r\n  itself might impact upon its characterization, but the trial court ultimately\r\n  never characterized its sanction as civil or criminal.Â  While we would normally\r\n  attempt to ascertain the type of contempt involved for the purposes of our\r\n  review, we need not characterize the contempt herein in light of our reversal\r\n  of the sanction since each type of contempt sanction, criminal or civil,\r\n  requires a finding of willfulness.Â  Therefore, even if we were to agree with\r\n  the dissent that this proceeding involves civil contempt, we conclude the trial\r\n  court nonetheless erred in imposing the sanction as the record fails to support\r\n  a finding of willful conduct.\r\n[5] We decide this case without oral arguments pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"}]
