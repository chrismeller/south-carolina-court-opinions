Blitch, Jr., of\r\n  Columbia, James Strom Thurmond, Jr., of Aiken, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.: Appellant, Juan Orozco, was convicted of two counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a\r\n  minor and two counts of lewd act upon a child and was sentenced to concurrent\r\n  terms of twenty years, suspended upon service of fifteen years for the CSC\r\n  charges, and fifteen years on the lewd act charges. Orozco appeals,\r\n  asserting the trial judge erred in (1) admitting testimony regarding Orozco's\r\n  suicide attempt and (2) charging the jury that testimony of a child witness\r\n  need not be corroborated.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOrozco was accused of sexually abusing two of his nieces, who\r\n  are cousins.Â  The girls, who were minors, both testified as to Orozco's sexual\r\n  misconduct.Â  Testimony shows the younger child, who was four or five years old\r\n  at the time of the incidents, made the allegations to an adult on June 21,\r\n  2006.Â  The following day, June 22, 2006, the younger child's mother, Suzie,\r\n  filed a report with the sheriff's department.Â  On that same day, Suzie also\r\n  notified her older sister, Ann, of the younger child's allegations against\r\n  their brother-in-law.Â  Following this conversation between Suzie and Ann, Ann\r\n  went to speak with their sister Janet, Orozco's wife, before noon on June 22,\r\n  2006, and informed Janet of the allegations made by the younger child.Â  Ann\r\n  testified she did not know what was going to happen after Suzie filed the\r\n  report and she wanted to let Janet know about the allegations against her\r\n  husband.Â  Â \r\nWithin a few days of the allegations made by her\r\n  niece, Ann contacted her minor daughter in Indiana where the older child was\r\n  vacationing with another of Ann, Suzie and Janet's sisters.Â  The older child,\r\n  who was eight or nine at the time she used to visit in Orozco's home,\r\n  thereafter disclosed incidents of sexual abuse committed by Orozco upon her.\r\nThe State made a pretrial motion to admit evidence of\r\n  Orozco's suicide attempt asserting, although there was no South Carolina law\r\n  addressing the issue, the courts of most states allow such evidence.Â  Defense\r\n  counsel acknowledged that a lot of states do equate a suicide attempt with\r\n  flight, and while South Carolina does allow evidence of flight, there was no\r\n  South Carolina law equating the two.Â  Further, defense counsel argued there was\r\n  no direct evidence Orozco was aware of the allegations and therefore attempted\r\n  suicide to evade the charges.Â  Counsel maintained the suicide note indicated\r\n  only that Orozco expressed he did not want to go to prison because &quot;somebody\r\n  lied on him,&quot; and this was the only evidence that Orozco knew of the\r\n  charges, but the State did not intend to introduce the suicide note.Â  Counsel\r\n  thus argued the suicide attempt was not from a guilty conscience, but from lack\r\n  of faith in the judicial system.Â  He argued the prejudice from admitting the\r\n  suicide attempt evidence outweighed the probative value and would also confuse\r\n  the jury.Â  The solicitor indicated she did not intend to admit the suicide note\r\n  because she believed it was hearsay, it was not an admission against Orozco's\r\n  interests, and it was &quot;more in [Orozco's] own favor.&quot;Â  The solicitor\r\n  contended that there was circumstantial evidence that Orozco was aware of the\r\n  allegations inasmuch as there was evidence the mother of one of the victims\r\n  told Orozco's wife the morning of the suicide attempt that the younger child\r\n  had made the allegation of sexual abuse, and Orozco's wife was present when EMS\r\n  and the sheriff's department arrived at the suicide attempt call.Â  The trial judge\r\n  determined the suicide attempt evidence was admissible, noting that such\r\n  evidence was admissible in other states, and evidence of flight is admissible\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  The judge further informed trial counsel that the defense\r\n  needed to make a decision about the suicide note, and that the court would be\r\n  inclined to admit the note based on this ruling.\r\nThereafter, over Orozco's objection, the State\r\n  presented evidence that at 2:01 p.m. on the afternoon of June 22, 2006,\r\n  officers were dispatched to the Orozco residence in reference to a suicide\r\n  attempt.Â  Sheriff's Deputy Tom Gray testified when he arrived at the home, he\r\n  found Orozco being treated by emergency medical personnel for taking rodent\r\n  poison.Â  Deputy Gray also found a box of rodent poison and a purported suicide\r\n  note written in Spanish.Â  Orozco's wife Janet, who was also the complainant,[2] was also\r\n  present at the scene.\r\nDuring a discussion regarding jury charges, Orozco\r\n  objected to inclusion of a charge that no corroboration of the testimony of the\r\n  two children was needed, maintaining such was an impermissible comment on the\r\n  facts. Â The trial judge determined the charge was South Carolina law, and\r\n  determined he would charge the pertinent statute as written.Â  Thereafter, the\r\n  trial court included in the jury instruction a charge pursuant to section\r\n  16-3-657 of the South Carolina Code that, &quot;in South Carolina the testimony\r\n  of a victim need not be corroborated for prosecution in a criminal sexual\r\n  conduct case.&quot;Â  This was the extent of the charge given regarding\r\n  corroboration. Â Â Â Â \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in admitting testimony regarding Orozco's\r\n  suicide attempt. \r\n\t2.&nbsp; Whether the trial judge erred in charging the jury that the testimony of\r\n  the child witnesses did not need to be corroborated.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review\r\n  errors of law only.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829\r\n  (2001).Â  The admission or exclusion of testimonial evidence falls within the\r\n  sound discretion of the trial judge, whose decision will not be disturbed on\r\n  appeal absent an abuse of that discretion, resulting in prejudice. Â State v.\r\n    Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 288, 676 S.E.2d 690, 696 (2009).Â  &quot;A trial court's\r\n  decision regarding jury charges will not be reversed where the charges, as a\r\n  whole, properly charged the law to be applied.&quot;Â  State v. Wharton,\r\n  381 S.C. 209, 213, 672 S.E.2d 786, 788 (2009). Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Evidence of Suicide Attempt\r\nOn appeal, Orozco asserts the trial court\r\n  erred in admitting evidence of his suicide attempt.Â  He argues there is no\r\n  South Carolina authority supporting the admission of a suicide attempt as\r\n  evidence of consciousness of guilt, and though South Carolina law has held\r\n  evidence of flight constitutes evidence of guilty knowledge and intent, our\r\n  courts require proof an accused is aware of the charges before evidence of\r\n  flight becomes relevant and admissible.Â  Orozco contends the prejudicial effect\r\n  of introducing evidence of his suicide attempt outweighed any probative value,\r\n  as the evidence of his suicide attempt would only become relevant and\r\n  admissible upon the State's establishing that he was aware of the charges\r\n  against him at the time of the suicide attempt.Â  He maintains, because the\r\n  State failed to present the critical proof that he was aware of the charges at\r\n  the time of his suicide attempt, the evidence was irrelevant and prejudicial\r\n  and should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE. \r\nGenerally, all relevant evidence is admissible.Â  Rule\r\n  402, SCRE; State v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 578, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170\r\n  (2007).Â  Relevant evidence is &quot;evidence having any tendency to make the\r\n  existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action\r\n  more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is\r\n  substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. Â Rule 403, SCRE; Pittman,\r\n  373 S.C. at 578, 647 S.E.2d at 170. Â Evidence is unfairly prejudicial if it has\r\n  an undue tendency to suggest a decision on an improper basis, such as an\r\n  emotional one.Â  State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 547, 552 S.E.2d 300,\r\n  311 (2001).Â  An appellate court reviews 403 rulings, balancing whether the\r\n  probative value of evidence was substantially outweighed by its prejudicial\r\n  effect, pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard, and gives great deference\r\n  to the trial court's decision.Â  State v. Myers, 359 S.C. 40, 48, 596\r\n  S.E.2d 488, 492 (2004).\r\nWhether evidence of\r\n  attempted suicide is probative of the accused's consciousness of guilt is an\r\n  issue of first impression in South Carolina. Â The question, however, is easily\r\n  analogized to other types of circumstantial evidence of guilt based on the\r\n  accused's behavior after the crime. Â First, our courts have held that, as a\r\n  general rule, any guilty act or conduct on the part of the accused is\r\n  admissible as some evidence of consciousness of guilt.Â  State v. McDowell,\r\n  266 S.C. 508, 515, 224 S.E.2d 889, 892 (1976).Â  Further, it has long been the\r\n  rule in South Carolina that evidence of witness intimidation and evidence of\r\n  attempted flight are probative of the accused's consciousness of guilt.Â  See State v. Edwards, 383 S.C. 66, 72, 678 S.E.2d 405, 408 (2009) (holding witness intimidation evidence, if linked to the defendant,\r\n  may be admitted to show a consciousness of guilt), see also State v. Walker, 366 S.C.\r\n  643, 655, 623 S.E.2d 122, 128 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding &quot;[u]nexplained\r\n  flight is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not as likely that one who is blameless and\r\n  conscious of that fact would flee&quot;); State v. Robinson, 360 S.C.\r\n  187, 195, 600 S.E.2d 100, 104 (Ct. App. 2004) (noting flight, when unexplained,\r\n  is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt).Â  Additionally, courts of\r\n  other jurisdictions, applying the same principle that deems evidence of flight\r\n  by one accused of a crime as probative of consciousness of guilt, have\r\n  frequently held admissible evidence that the accused, after the crime was\r\n  committed, attempted to commit suicide.Â  See 29 Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 547 (2008) (&quot;The principle upon which evidence of flight of one accused\r\n  of a crime is admitted is\r\n  applicable to evidence that the accused, when in custody, and charged with a\r\n  crime, attempts to take his or her own life and thereby escape further\r\n  prosecution.&quot;); Dale Joseph Gilsinger, Annotation, Admissibility of Evidence Relating to Accused's Attempt to Commit Suicide,\r\n  73 A.L.R. 5th 615, 624 (1999) (&quot;The principle on\r\n  which evidence of flight by one accused of a crime is admissible is almost\r\n  universally held to apply to evidence that the accused, after the crime was\r\n  committed - such as at the time of arrest or while in custody for the crime for\r\n  which they are being tried - attempted to commit suicide and thereby escape\r\n  further prosecution.&quot;).Â  Finally, the overwhelming majority of states considering this issue\r\n  have determined that evidence of attempted suicide is generally admissible to\r\n  establish consciousness of guilt.Â  See 29\r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Evidence Â§ 547 (&quot;Evidence of attempted suicide by a person who is, at the\r\n  time of the attempt or thereafter, charged with or suspected of a crime, is\r\n  relevant as possibly indicating consciousness of guilt and admissible at trial\r\n  for that crime for whatever weight the jury chooses to assign.&quot;); Gilsinger, supra at 624.Â (&quot;With a single exception,\r\n  courts have unanimously held that an accused's attempt to commit suicide is\r\n  probative of a consciousness of guilt and is therefore admissible.&quot;);\r\n  22A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1011 (2006) (&quot;Evidence\r\n  is generally admissible that the accused attempted or threatened to commit\r\n  suicide subsequent to the time the crime was committed. Â Such evidence\r\n  ordinarily is admissible as indicating a consciousness of guilt.&quot;).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we conclude that evidence of a suicide\r\n  attempt is probative of a defendant's consciousness of guilt and is generally\r\n  admissible for whatever value the jury decides to give it.\r\nOrozco argues, however, that evidence of his suicide attempt should not have \r\nbeen admitted because the State failed to show he was aware of the allegations \r\nmade against him at the time of his attempt.&nbsp; He argues, as in the case of \r\nevidence of flight, proof that the accused is aware of the charges at the time \r\nof the conduct is necessary before the evidence can be relevant.&nbsp; He notes, \r\nin particular, his argument to the trial court that the suicide note was the \r\nonly indication he was aware of the charges, and without the note there was \r\ninsufficient evidence of his awareness. \r\nIn addressing the admission\r\n  of evidence of flight, our courts have determined that &quot;[f]light, when\r\n  unexplained, is admissible as indicating consciousness of guilt, for it is not\r\n  to be supposed that one who is innocent and conscious of that fact would flee.&quot;Â  State v. Crawford, 362 S.C. 627, 635, 608 S.E.2d 886, 890 (Ct. App. 2005).Â \r\n  However, we have further noted that &quot;[t]he critical factor to the\r\n  admissibility of evidence of flight is whether the totality of the evidence\r\n  creates an inference that the defendant had knowledge that he was being sought\r\n  by the authorities.&quot; Id. at 636, 608 S.E.2d at 891.Â  &quot;Flight\r\n  evidence is relevant when there is a nexus between the flight and the offense\r\n  charged.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 209, 631 S.E.2d 262, 266\r\n  (2006).Â  &quot;It is sufficient that circumstances justify an inference that\r\n  the accused's actions were motivated as a result of his belief that police\r\n  officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that purpose.&quot;\r\n  Â Crawford, 362 S.C. at 636, 608 S.E.2d at 891.Â  Where the circumstances\r\n  fail to show the necessary nexus between a defendant's flight and the current\r\n  offense for which he is on trial, the flight evidence is not relevant and\r\n  should not be admitted.Â  See Pagan, 369 S.C. at 209, 631 S.E.2d\r\n  at 266 (holding flight evidence was not relevant where the evidence did not\r\n  create an inference that defendant's alleged failure to stop for a blue light\r\n  was motivated by his belief that the police were seeking him for his pending\r\n  murder charge).\r\nHere, the circumstances\r\n  justify an inference that Orozco was aware of the sexual misconduct allegations\r\n  against him by the younger child.Â  Testimony shows that on June 22,\r\n  2006, the mother of the younger child informed the\r\n  mother of the older child about the younger child's allegations against Orozco\r\n  and that, sometime before noon that same day, the mother of the older child\r\n  informed Orozco's wife of the disclosure by the younger child.Â  Around 2:00\r\n  that afternoon, Deputy Gray responded to a dispatch for a suicide attempt at\r\n  Orozco's home where he observed a box of rodent poison and a suicide note,\r\n  found Orozco being treated for ingestion of the poison, and noticed Orozco's\r\n  wife, the complainant, was at the scene.Â  Thus, the totality of the evidence\r\n  creates an inference that Orozco's actions in attempting suicide were motivated\r\n  as a result of his belief that sexual misconduct allegations had been made\r\n  against him.Â  We therefore find the suicide attempt evidence was relevant.Â  Further,\r\n  we find no merit to Orozco's argument that the evidence was inadmissible\r\n  pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Although Orozco summarily asserts he was prejudiced\r\n  by the admission of this evidence, he fails to argue how he was prejudiced or\r\n  why the prejudicial effect of the suicide attempt evidence outweighed its\r\n  probative value.Â  Accordingly, giving due deference to the trial court's ruling\r\n  on this matter, we find no abuse of discretion.Â  Myers, 359 S.C. at\r\n  48, 596 S.E.2d at 492.\r\nII.&nbsp; Charge on Corroboration\r\nOn appeal, Orozco asserts the trial judge committed\r\n  reversible error in giving the charge on corroboration.Â  He argues the\r\n  instruction focused the attention of the jury on a particular class of\r\n  witnesses, the victims, and indicated the testimony of those particular\r\n  witnesses, apart from other witnesses, needed no corroboration.Â  Because the\r\n  trial judge failed to instruct that any other class of evidence need not be\r\n  corroborated, he contends the instruction constituted an unconstitutional and\r\n  impermissible charge on the facts and the credibility of the witnesses.Â  Orozco\r\n  further maintains the harm was not cured by the balance of the trial court's\r\n  charge. Â While recognizing our supreme court has addressed this issue in State\r\n    v. Rayfield, 369 S.C. 106, 631 S.E.2d 244 (2006) (hereinafter Rayfield\r\n      II) and found such a charge appropriate under the circumstances, Orozco\r\n  points to the dissent in Rayfield II and the fact that the earlier\r\n  decision in the seminal case of State v. Schumpert, 312 S.C. 502, 435\r\n  S.E.2d 859 (1993) relied upon an Indiana case that was later overruled by the\r\n  Indiana court.Â  He further argues, even under the decision of the majority in Rayfield\r\n    II, the issuance of the instruction was unduly emphasized by the State in\r\n  its closing argument and therefore was reversible error.\r\nSection 16-3-657 of the South Carolina Code (2003)\r\n  provides, &quot;The testimony of the victim need not be corroborated in\r\n  prosecutions under Â§Â§ 16-3-652 through 16-3-658.&quot;Â  These criminal statutes,\r\n  which generally encompass the prohibition of various forms and degrees of\r\n  criminal sexual conduct, include criminal sexual misconduct with a minor for\r\n  which Orozco was charged.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655 (Supp. 2010).\r\nIn Rayfield II, our supreme court, in a\r\n  majority opinion, affirmed this court's opinion in Rayfield I,[3] finding no\r\n  reversible error in the giving of a jury instruction on section 16-3-657. Â Rayfield\r\n  asserted on appeal that the trial judge erred in charging section 16-3-657 to\r\n  the jury because the charge constituted an impermissible comment on the facts\r\n  of the case, it improperly emphasized the testimony of one witness, and it\r\n  carried a strong possibility of unfairly biasing the jury against the\r\n  defendant.Â  Rayfield II, 369 S.C. at 115, 631 S.E.2d at 249.\r\nIn Rayfield I, this court found the challenged\r\n  charge withstood appellate scrutiny in the Schumpert case.Â  Rayfield\r\n    I, 357 S.C. at 505, 593 S.E.2d at 491. We further determined there was no\r\n  reversible error in the trial court's instruction to the jury regarding the\r\n  corroboration of the victims' testimony in Rayfield's case, as the charge was\r\n  consistent with Schumpert, noting the trial court:Â  (1) properly\r\n  instructed the jury that it was the sole finder of fact with the discretion to\r\n  determine the credibility of the witnesses; (2) correctly charged our state's\r\n  constitutional mandate prohibiting the court from commenting on the facts or\r\n  having an opinion about the facts in the case; and (3) correctly charged the\r\n  State's burden of proof.Â  Id.Â  We held, while a &quot;section 16-3-657\r\n  charge is not mandatory, such charge does not constitute reversible error when\r\n  the Schumpert safeguards are present.&quot;Â  Id. Â Â \r\nIn Rayfield II, the supreme court noted the\r\n  trial court charged the jury the State had the burden of proving Rayfield was\r\n  guilty of the charged offenses beyond a reasonable doubt, and further\r\n  instructed the jurors that they were the sole and exclusive judges of the facts\r\n  of the case, that the trial court was prohibited from commenting on or having\r\n  an opinion about the facts of a case, and they were responsible for assessing\r\n  the credibility of the witnesses who testified in the case.Â  Rayfield II,\r\n  369 S.C. at 116-17, 631 S.E.2d at 249-50.Â  The supreme court then stated as\r\n  follows:\r\n\r\n\tIt is not always\r\n  necessary, of course, to charge the contents of a current statute.Â  Section\r\n  16-3-657 prevents trial or appellate courts from finding a lack of sufficient\r\n  evidence to support a conviction simply because the alleged victim's testimony\r\n  is not corroborated.Â  However, Â§ 16-3-657 does much more.Â  In enacting this\r\n  statute, the Legislature recognized that crimes involving criminal sexual\r\n  conduct fall within a unique category of offenses against the person.Â  In many\r\n  cases, the only witnesses to a rape or sexual assault are the perpetrator and\r\n  the victim.Â  An investigation may or may not reveal physical or forensic\r\n  evidence identifying a particular perpetrator.Â  The Legislature has decided it\r\n  is reasonable and appropriate in criminal sexual conduct cases to make\r\n  abundantly clear--not only to the judge but also to the jury--that a\r\n  defendant may be convicted solely on the basis of a victim's testimony.\r\n\r\nRayfield II, 369 S.C. at 117, 631 S.E.2d at 250 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The court then concluded, while a trial judge is not required to\r\n  charge Â§ 16-3-657, when the judge chooses to do so, giving the charge does not\r\n  constitute reversible error when &quot;this single instruction is not unduly\r\n  emphasized and the charge as a whole comports with the law.&quot;Â  Id. Â at\r\n  117-18, 631 S.E.2d at 250.Â  Because the jury in that case was thoroughly\r\n  instructed on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to find the facts\r\n  and judge the credibility of witnesses, the court determined the trial judge\r\n  fully and properly instructed the jury on those principles.Â  Id. Â at\r\n  118, 631 S.E.2d at 250.\r\nThe arguments made by Orozco on appeal are the same as\r\n  those raised and rejected by our courts in the Rayfield cases.[4]Â  As in Rayfield,\r\n  the trial court here properly charged the jury that the State had the burden of\r\n  proving the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt, that the jury had the\r\n  duty to find the facts and determine the credibility of the witnesses, and that\r\n  the jury should disregard any indication from the trial judge that he might\r\n  believe a fact to be true or not.Â  Thus, the trial court thoroughly instructed\r\n  the jury on the State's burden of proof and the jury's duty to determine the\r\n  facts and judge the credibility of witnesses.Â  Further, the only charge\r\n  given by the trial court in regard to the corroboration of the victims'\r\n  testimony was that &quot;in South Carolina the testimony of a victim need not\r\n  be corroborated for prosecution in a criminal sexual conduct case.&quot;Â  Thus,\r\n  this single instruction was not unduly emphasized.Â  Accordingly, there was no\r\n  reversible error.Â Â Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough South Carolina has yet to directly address\r\n  the admissibility of evidence of a defendant's attempted suicide, given the\r\n  almost unanimous decisions of courts of other jurisdictions finding such\r\n  evidence to be generally admissible, our jurisprudence allowing other evidence\r\n  of conduct showing consciousness of guilt, and the equating of attempted\r\n  suicide evidence to that of flight in other jurisdictions, along with the circumstances justifying an inference that Orozco was\r\n  aware of the sexual misconduct allegations against him such that the evidence\r\n  was relevant and probative, and in light of our standard of review giving the\r\n  trial court great discretion in weighing Rule 403 matters, we find no error in\r\n  the admission of this evidence.\r\nWe further believe Rayfield\r\n  II is controlling on the issue of the corroboration charge.Â  There are no\r\n  distinguishing factors that would set this case apart from Rayfield II, and\r\n  this court does not have authority to change the law of Rayfield II.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Orozco's convictions are\r\nAFFIRMED. Â \r\nTHOMAS and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral\r\n  argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] In referring to &quot;the\r\n  complainant,&quot; it appears Deputy Gray was indicating Janet placed the 911\r\n  call reporting the attempted suicide.\r\n[3] State v. Rayfield, 357 S.C. 497, 593 S.E.2d\r\n  486 (Ct.

Tisdale, Jr., and Jeffrey S. Tibbals,\r\n  all of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tAndrew F. Lindemann, of Columbia; and Marshall H. Waldron, Jr., of\r\n  Beaufort; for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFew, C.J.: Â The primary issue in this appeal is whether various\r\n  statutes governing coroners and crematory operators give rise to private rights\r\n  of action for civil damages.Â  We agree with the circuit court that they do not,\r\n  and affirm.Â  We also affirm the circuit court's ruling granting summary\r\n  judgment for the defendants for spoliation of evidence and intentional\r\n  infliction of emotional distress.Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\nOn November 21,\r\n  2005, Paul Trask, III, a twenty-year-old, consumed beer at his parents' home in\r\n  Beaufort.[1]Â \r\n  Shortly before midnight Paul drove his father's car to a Hess gas station named\r\n  Xpress Lane on Boundary Street.Â  The gas station attendant sold Paul two\r\n  twenty-four-ounce cans of beer without verifying his age.Â  Paul Trask, Jr.\r\n  described the store video as showing his son &quot;going into the Xpress Lane\r\n  store and immediately going in, going to the bathroom, pretty clear he had been\r\n  drinking beer, coming out, he seems steady, but we know he's been drinking\r\n  beer.&quot; Paul consumed the beer he purchased from Xpress Lane while driving\r\n  approximately twenty-two miles to Fripp Island, but was turned away at the\r\n  security gate.Â  After driving almost four miles away from Fripp Island, Paul\r\n  lost control of the car, ran off the road, and collided with large pine trees.Â \r\n  The car caught on fire and Paul died from the injuries he sustained in the\r\n  accident, either the impact, fire, or a combination.Â  \r\nOn May 22, 2006,\r\n  Mr. Trask and his wife filed a wrongful death and survival action against Hess\r\n  Corporation and Xpress Lane, Inc., which we refer to as the Xpress Lane suit.Â \r\n  The Trasks alleged Paul's death &quot;was the proximate result of the alleged\r\n  negligence of [Hess and Xpress Lane], in several particulars, including: the\r\n  negligent sale of alcohol to a minor.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  They claimed the beers Xpress Lane sold to Paul &quot;were the beers that\r\n  caused his intoxication.&quot;Â  Hess and Xpress Lane agreed to pay the Trasks\r\n  $750,000 to settle the case before trial.Â  As required by law, the Trasks\r\n  requested the circuit court approve the settlement, which it did on January 9,\r\n  2008.Â  However, Mr. Trask later testified &quot;that it was worth more than\r\n  $750,000&quot; and explained, &quot;we were only able to negotiate a very\r\n  partial settlement in the Xpress Lane case because we had no definitive\r\n  toxicology results to prove Â Â Â Â . . . that Paul was intoxicated . . . .Â  And so\r\n  I would say that caused great damage to the Xpress Lane suit.&quot;Â  \r\nIn this action the Trasks have sued Beaufort County and Curtis Copeland,[3] both in his official capacity as the coroner of Beaufort County and in his\r\n  individual capacity as a crematory operator.Â  They seek damages for the reduced\r\n  settlement value of the Xpress Lane suit along with damages for emotional\r\n  harm.Â  The Trasks contend various statutes create duties owed to them which\r\n  Copeland breached individually and officially.Â  This case is troubling because\r\n  Copeland did violate at least some of the statutes, and conducted himself in a\r\n  manner we believe was inappropriate.Â  We hold, however, that the law does not\r\n  provide a remedy for this conduct in the form of civil damages.\r\nShortly after the\r\n  accident occurred, Copeland went to the scene.Â  At around 1:00 a.m. on November\r\n  22, after he learned who owned the car, Copeland drove to the Trasks' home to\r\n  inform them of the accident and death.Â  When Copeland arrived at their home, he\r\n  did not know who was killed in the accident; he knew only that the car belonged\r\n  to Mr. Trask.Â  Once the Trasks determined Paul was the only family member not\r\n  at home, they realized he had been the driver.Â  Later that day family and\r\n  friends of the Trasks gathered at Mr. Trask's mother's home.Â  Copeland went\r\n  there around noon to discuss the funeral arrangements.Â  In addition to being\r\n  the county coroner, Copeland also owned Copeland Company of Beaufort, LLC,\r\n  which owns and operates Copeland Funeral Home and Coastal Cremation Services.Â \r\n  At the gathering, the Trasks told Copeland they wanted Paul's body cremated and\r\n  signed the cremation authorization form.Â  Although they signed the form\r\n  sometime between noon and one o'clock, Copeland instructed them to write the\r\n  time as 9:15 a.m.Â  The following day Coastal Cremation Services cremated Paul's\r\n  body. Â Â Â \r\nThe Trasks contend\r\n  two statements made by Copeland caused them emotional distress.Â  First, when\r\n  Copeland was leaving the Trasks' home after telling them about the accident,\r\n  Mrs. Trask asked him if he planned to perform an autopsy on Paul's body.Â \r\n  Copeland responded there was no need to perform an autopsy because &quot;the\r\n  cause of death is obvious.&quot;Â  Second, a few months later the Trasks asked\r\n  Copeland how badly Paul's body was burned in the accident, to which he\r\n  responded, &quot;you couldn't tell if the body was black, white, or\r\n  Mexican.&quot;Â  \r\nThe Trasks allege\r\n  Copeland, as coroner, was required, but failed, to positively identify the body\r\n  in the car as their son, to conduct an autopsy, and to prepare a toxicology\r\n  report on the body.Â  They claim that because Copeland individually cremated the\r\n  body without conducting a toxicology test officially as coroner, the resulting\r\n  lack of knowledge of Paul's blood alcohol level &quot;made it difficult, if not\r\n  impossible, for the Trasks to establish and prove otherwise valid claims\r\n  against the Xpress Lane and Hess Corporation&quot; and forced them to settle\r\n  for less money.Â  \r\nThe Trasks filed\r\n  this action on April 11, 2007, with claims for negligence and negligent\r\n  supervision and training against Beaufort County and Copeland officially; for\r\n  negligent spoliation of evidence against Beaufort County; for negligence and\r\n  intentional or negligent spoliation of evidence against Copeland individually\r\n  and Copeland Company; and for intentional infliction of emotional distress\r\n  against Copeland individually.[4]Â \r\n  The Trasks moved for partial summary judgment based on liability.Â  All\r\n  Respondents filed motions for summary judgment.Â  The trial court filed its\r\n  order on January 2, 2009, granting summary judgment for Respondents.Â  The\r\n  Trasks appeal the entire order.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Determining the Existence of a Private Right of Action\r\nIn a negligence\r\n  cause of action, it is the plaintiff's burden to establish that a duty of care\r\n  is owed to him by the defendant.Â  See McKnight v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n  385 S.C. 380, 390-91, 684 S.E.2d 566, 571&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;An essential element in a negligence cause of action\r\n  is the existence of a legal duty of care owed by the defendant to the plaintiff.Â  Without such a duty, a plaintiff cannot establish negligence.&quot;) (internal quotation marks and citation\r\n  omitted); Chastain v. Hiltabidle, 381 S.C. 508, 519, 673 S.E.2d 826,\r\n  832&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009) (&quot;If no duty exists, the defendant is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.&quot;).Â  Though the common law generally does not\r\n  impose a duty to act, a statute may create an affirmative duty owed to a\r\n  plaintiff.&nbsp; Vaughn v. Town of Lyman, 370 S.C. 436, 441, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  631, 634 (2006). Â \r\nIn Rayfield\r\n  v. South Carolina Department of Corrections, 297 S.C. 95, 103, 374 S.E.2d\r\n  910, 914 (Ct. App. 1988), cert. denied, 298 S.C. 204, 379 S.E.2d 133\r\n  (1989), this court set forth the analysis to apply when determining whether a\r\n  statute creates a duty whose breach allows for a private right of action:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  order to show that the defendant owes him a duty of care arising from a\r\n  statute, the plaintiff must show two things: (1) that the essential purpose of\r\n  the statute is to protect from the kind of harm the plaintiff has suffered; and\r\n  (2) that he is a member of the class of persons the statute is intended to\r\n  protect.\r\n\r\nIf the plaintiff demonstrates\r\n  these two elements, he has established the first element of a negligence\r\n  claimâ€”a duty owed to him by the defendant.Â  297 S.C. at 103, 374 S.E.2d at\r\n  915.Â  \r\nHowever, when the\r\n  statute at issue creates or defines the duties of a public official, the public\r\n  duty rule applies.Â  297 S.C. at 105, 374 S.E.2d at 915.Â  &quot;'This rule holds that public officials are generally\r\n  not liable to individuals for their negligence in discharging public duties as\r\n  the duty is owed to the public at large rather than anyone\r\n  individually.'&quot;Â  Vaughn, 370 S.C. at 441, 635 S.E.2d at 634\r\n  (quoting Steinke v. S.C. Dep't of Labor, Licensing,\r\n    &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 388, 520\r\n  S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999)).Â  The public duty rule represents a presumption\r\n  that such a statute &quot;has the essential purpose of providing for the\r\n  structure and operation of the government or of securing the general welfare\r\n  and safety of the public,&quot; and thus does not satisfy the elements of the\r\n  two-part Rayfield test.Â  297 S.C. at 105, 374 S.E.2d at 915. Â \r\nThe\r\n  presumption may be overcome when the statute creates a &quot;special duty&quot;\r\n  to the plaintiff.Â  297 S.C. at 106, 374 S.E.2d at 916.Â  In Rayfield,\r\n  this court stated:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  special duty exists if: (1) an essential purpose of the statute is to protect\r\n  against a particular kind of harm; (2) the statute, either directly or\r\n  indirectly, imposes on a specific public officer a duty to guard against or not\r\n  to cause that harm; (3) the class of persons the statute intends to protect is\r\n  identifiable before the fact; (4) the plaintiff is a person within the\r\n  protected class; (5) the public officer knows or has reason to know of the\r\n  likelihood of harm to members of the class if he fails to do his duty; and (6)\r\n  the officer is given sufficient authority to act in the circumstances or he\r\n  undertakes to act in the exercise of his office.\r\n\r\nId.; see also Vaughn, 370 S.C. at 441, 635 S.E.2d at 634 (referring to\r\n  the six-part Rayfield test as &quot;the well established 'special duty'\r\n  exception&quot;); Jensen v. Anderson Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 304\r\n  S.C. 195, 203, 403 S.E.2d 615, 619 (1991) (adopting the six-part Rayfield test and calling it an &quot;exception to the public duty rule&quot;).Â  If a\r\n  special duty is found to exist after analyzing a statute under this test,\r\n  courts can be sure the Legislature intended that a plaintiff within the\r\n  protected class injured by a public official's breach of the duty have a\r\n  private right of action against the official.Â  304 S.C. at 201, 403 S.E.2d at\r\n  618; see Vaughn, 370 S.C. at 442, 635 S.E.2d at 634 (&quot;The public duty rule is a rule of statutory\r\n  construction which aids the court in determining whether the legislature\r\n  intended to create a private right of action . . . .Â  [T]he dispositive issue\r\n  is . . . whether the statute was intended to provide . . . a private right of\r\n  action . . . .&quot;).\r\nWe must analyze the\r\n  one statute alleged to have been violated by Copeland individually under the\r\n  general two-part test and those alleged to have been violated by Copeland\r\n  officially under the special duty exception to the public duty rule.\r\nA.&nbsp; Section\r\n  16-17-600 Does Not Create a Duty Owed by Copeland Individually\r\n  and Copeland Company to the Trasks\r\nThe only allegation\r\n  of negligence against Copeland individually and Copeland Company is that they\r\n  breached a statutory duty contained in section 16-17-600 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2010). Â The section provides: \r\n\r\n\t(A) It\r\n  is unlawful for a person willfully and knowingly, and without proper legal\r\n  authority to: (1) destroy or damage the remains of a deceased human being; . .\r\n  . .\r\n\tA person\r\n  violating the provisions of subsection (A) is guilty of a felony . . . .Â  \r\n\tA\r\n  crematory operator is neither civilly nor criminally liable for cremating a\r\n  body which (1) has been incorrectly identified by the funeral director,\r\n  coroner, medical examiner, or person authorized by law to bring the deceased to\r\n  the crematory; or (2) the funeral director has obtained invalid authorization\r\n  to cremate.Â  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 16-17-600(A).[5]Â \r\n  The Trasks contend this statute creates an actionable duty under the two-part Rayfield test.Â  Specifically, they argue the statute's essential purpose &quot;is to\r\n  ensure dead bodies are not destroyed without proper authority.&quot;Â  Even if\r\n  that is the essential purpose, however, it is not the harm the Trasks claim\r\n  they suffered.Â  At oral argument, the Trasks' counsel stated the harm they\r\n  suffered was a loss of settlement value of the Xpress Lane suit because Paul's\r\n  body was no longer available.Â  Additionally, Mr. Trask stated in his\r\n  deposition: &quot;Mr. Copeland performed an illegal cremation on my son's body,\r\n  which had the effect of destroying any opportunity to, number one, know for\r\n  certain whether or not it was our son, Paul,[6] number two, the actual cause of his death, whether it was the crash itself or\r\n  whether he burned to death.Â  We have been denied the toxicology results as a\r\n  result of the illegal cremation . . . .&quot;Â  Therefore, the harm they claim\r\n  to have suffered is that Paul's body was no longer available for an autopsy and\r\n  a toxicology test.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  essential purpose of section 16-17-600 is not to preserve a body as evidence\r\n  for a civil action.Â  Accordingly, the Trasks fail to meet the first element of\r\n  the two-part Rayfield test.Â  The Trasks argue, however, that the\r\n  statute's specific reference to a crematory operator's immunity for civil\r\n  liability demonstrates the Legislature intended for its violation to serve as\r\n  the basis for civil liability.Â  We disagree.Â  Section 16-17-600 is a criminal\r\n  statute which provides only for criminal sanctions.Â  See Dorman v.\r\n    Aiken Commc'ns, Inc., 303 S.C. 63, 67, 398 S.E.2d 687, 688-89 (1990)\r\n  (refusing to find a private right of action for &quot;a criminal statute which\r\n  provides only for criminal sanctions&quot; because &quot;[t]he primary\r\n  consideration in deciding whether a private cause of action should be implied\r\n  under a criminal statute is legislative intent&quot;).Â  We find section 16-17-600\r\n  does not create a duty of due care owed by Copeland or Copeland Company to the\r\n  Trasks, and therefore they do not have a private right of action for its\r\n  breach.[7]\r\nB.&nbsp; No\r\n  Duties Exist as to the Negligence Claims Against Copeland\r\n  Officially\r\nThe Trasks allege\r\n  the following statutory duties were breached by Copeland officially: (1) to\r\n  perform an autopsy to ascertain the cause of death pursuant to section 17-7-10\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2003); (2) to perform a toxicology test of the\r\n  victim of a motor vehicle accident pursuant to section 17-7-80 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (2003); and (3) to take certain steps pursuant to sections\r\n  17-5-570(B) and -590 of the South Carolina Code (2003 &amp; Supp. 2010), which\r\n  are required when a body cannot be identified.Â  Copeland pled the public duty\r\n  rule as a defense to these claims.Â  We agree with the trial court that none of\r\n  these statutes satisfy the elements of the six-part Rayfield test, and\r\n  thus no special duty exists under any of them and the Trasks have no private\r\n  rights of action.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  the Trasks allege section 17-7-10 creates a special duty.Â  It states: &quot;The\r\n  coroner of the county in which a body is found dead . . . shall order an\r\n  autopsy or post-mortem examination to be conducted to ascertain the cause of\r\n  death.&quot;Â  Â§ 17-7-10.Â  The essential purpose of the statute is &quot;to\r\n  ascertain the cause of death.&quot;Â  The &quot;particular kind of harm&quot;\r\n  the Trasks claim to have suffered is that an autopsy would have provided\r\n  evidence for the Xpress Lane suit, and they were not satisfied with the level\r\n  of detail in the coroner's explanation of the cause of death.Â  Mr. Trask\r\n  testified an autopsy &quot;would have confirmed the results of a toxicology\r\n  examination, would have determined the actual cause of death, whether it be the\r\n  crash itself or by the fire.&quot;Â  The essential purpose of the statute is\r\n  neither to provide evidence for a civil lawsuit nor to ensure that the family\r\n  of a deceased person is given its desired level of detail regarding the cause\r\n  of death.[8]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the Trasks' negligence claim against Copeland officially under\r\n  section 17-7-10 is barred by the public duty rule. \r\nSecond, the Trasks\r\n  allege section 17-7-80 creates a special duty.Â  Title 17 is labeled\r\n  &quot;Criminal Procedures,&quot; and section 17-7-80 states:\r\n\r\n\tEvery\r\n  coroner . . . shall examine the body within eight hours of death of any driver\r\n  and any pedestrian, sixteen years old or older, who dies within four hours of a\r\n  motor vehicle accident . . . , and take or cause to have taken by a qualified\r\n  person such blood or other fluids of the victim as are necessary to a\r\n  determination of the presence and percentages of alcohol or drugs.Â  Such blood\r\n  or other fluids shall be forwarded to the South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division within five days after the accident in accordance with procedures\r\n  established by the Law Enforcement Division.\r\n\r\nThe Trasks argue the\r\n  essential purpose of the section &quot;is to protect those who may perish in a\r\n  motor vehicle accident, as well as their survivors, their estates, and their\r\n  heirs, and equally importantly, to accurately ascertain the cause of the\r\n  decedent's death.&quot;Â  They contend if Copeland had taken a toxicology\r\n  sample, they &quot;would have known what effect alcohol had on Paul's ability\r\n  to drive, whether it likely impaired his driving, and whether it significantly\r\n  contributed to his death.&quot;Â  We do not believe the essential purpose of the\r\n  statute is to protect against this &quot;particular kind of harm.&quot;Â \r\n  Rather, because the statute requires the toxicology sample be sent to the South\r\n  Carolina Law Enforcement Division, we find the purpose of the statute is one of\r\n  law enforcement.Â  Therefore, any benefit or injury to the Trasks from its\r\n  performance or nonperformance in determining whether alcohol played a role in\r\n  their son's death is incidental to its essential purpose.Â  The Trasks'\r\n  negligence claim against Copeland officially under section 17-7-80 is also\r\n  barred by the public duty rule.\r\nThird, and finally,\r\n  the Trasks allege sections 17-5-570(B) and 17-5-590 create a special duty when\r\n  a body is not identifiable.Â  Because the Trasks concede that Paul died in the\r\n  accident, we need not address this further.Â  Even under their own theory, they\r\n  are not within the protected class: families of unidentifiable deceased\r\n  persons.Â  Accordingly, the Trasks' claims based on these statutory duties are\r\n  barred by the public duty rule.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Third Party Spoliation of Evidence\r\nThe Trasks also\r\n  allege a third party spoliation of evidence cause of action.Â  In Austin v.\r\n    Beaufort County Sheriff's Office, 377 S.C. 31, 36, 659 S.E.2d 122, 124\r\n  (2008), the supreme court refused to adopt the tort of third party evidence\r\n  spoliation.Â  However, it stated, &quot;we decline to address whether we would,\r\n  under other factual circumstances, adopt the tort.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The\r\n  supreme court then listed the elements of negligent and intentional third party\r\n  spoliation as stated in Hannah v. Heeter, 584 S.E.2d 560, 569-70, 573 (W.Â \r\n  Va. 2003).Â  Austin, 377 S.C. at 34-35, 659 S.E.2d at 123-24.Â  As the\r\n  supreme court did in Austin, we find the Trasks fail to meet those\r\n  elements.Â  The Trasks have not presented any evidence that Copeland or Beaufort\r\n  County had knowledge two days after Paul's death of a potential civil action\r\n  against Hess Corporation and Xpress Lane, or that Paul's body would be\r\n  considered evidence in such a lawsuit.Â  More importantly, the Trasks authorized\r\n  the cremation of Paul's body.Â  They also failed to show it was possible to\r\n  obtain a toxicology test, and did not show how the results of that test would\r\n  be vital to their ability to prevail in a civil action.Â  The circuit court\r\n  correctly granted summary judgment as to this claim.\r\nIV.&nbsp; Intentional Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nThe second category\r\n  of damages the Trasks claim from Copeland's conduct is emotional harm.Â  They\r\n  allege Copeland is liable for intentional infliction of emotional distress for\r\n  the two statements he made to the Trasks.Â  The statements were made in response\r\n  to questions from the Trasks about the performance of an autopsy and the\r\n  details of the accident.Â  These are questions properly addressed to a coroner,\r\n  not a funeral home owner.Â  Under the Tort Claims Act, a coroner is immune from\r\n  suit for &quot;the intentional infliction of emotional harm.&quot;Â  S.C.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, Office of the Attorney General, all of Columbia; and\r\n  Solicitor Christina T. Adams, of Anderson; for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nFew, C.J.: Â Timothy\r\n  L. Wallace appeals his conviction and twenty-five year sentence for trafficking\r\n  cocaine.Â  His primary contention is that\r\n  the arresting officer did not have reasonable suspicion to detain him after the\r\n  conclusion of a traffic stop, and thus that the trial judge erred in not\r\n  suppressing evidence seized during the subsequent search.Â  He also contends the judge erred in not\r\n  suppressing a statement he made to the officer just before the drugs were found\r\n  and in not granting a mistrial.Â  We\r\n  affirm. \r\nI.&nbsp; Facts\r\nCorporal\r\n  Thomas Crompton of the Oconee County Sheriff's Office stopped Wallace on\r\n  Interstate 85 for driving his car left of the center line.Â  During the approximately twelve minutes it\r\n  took Crompton to complete the traffic stop, he made numerous observations that\r\n  led him to suspect that Wallace was engaged in serious criminal activity.Â  Crompton issued Wallace a traffic ticket, but\r\n  he continued to question him.Â  He asked if\r\n  there was anything illegal in the car and sought consent to search it.Â  Wallace did not answer the question about\r\n  anything illegal, and he refused several times to give consent to search.Â  Crompton then said &quot;hang tight just a\r\n  second&quot; and retrieved a drug-sniffing dog from his patrol vehicle.Â  At that point, Wallace was detained a second\r\n  time and not free to leave.[1]Â  When Crompton walked the dog around Wallace's\r\n  car, the dog alerted on the driver's door and the trunk.Â  Crompton then searched the car.Â  As he pulled bags out of the back, he asked who\r\n  owned each bag.Â  Wallace claimed\r\n  ownership of a bag in which Crompton discovered 752 grams of cocaine.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  Crompton found the cocaine, Sergeant Dale Colegrove,\r\n  who had been called to the scene for backup, read Wallace his Miranda[2] warnings.Â  Wallace agreed to speak to Colegrove without an attorney present. Â Wallace told him that he had picked up the cocaine and\r\n  was delivering it to someone in North Carolina.Â  Wallace was arrested and later indicted for trafficking more than 400\r\n  grams of cocaine.[3]Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Applicable Law\r\nWallace\r\n  concedes there was probable cause for the traffic stop.Â  The State concedes Wallace was detained a\r\n  second time while Crompton used the drug dog and then searched the car.Â  These concessions narrow the issue before us\r\n  to whether Crompton's suspicion that Wallace was engaged in serious criminal\r\n  activity was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment based on information\r\n  available to Crompton at the time he told Wallace to &quot;hang tight.&quot;Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Tindall, 388 S.C. 518, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  203 (2010), a majority of our supreme court summarized the basic principle that\r\n  the Fourth Amendment prevents a police officer from detaining a suspect after\r\n  the conclusion of a valid traffic stop &quot;unless the officer has reasonable\r\n  suspicion of a serious crime.&quot;Â  388 S.C. at 521, 698 S.E.2d at 205 (citing United States\r\n    v. Sullivan, 138 F.3d 126, 131 (4th Cir. 1998)).Â  However, &quot;'[r]easonable suspicion' . . . defies precise definition.&quot;Â  United States v. McCoy,\r\n  513 F.3d 405, 411 (4th Cir. 2008).Â  In McCoy, the Fourth Circuit restated the\r\n  classic passage from Ornelas v. United States, 517 U.S. 690 (1996), concerning the difficulty courts find in\r\n  applying the requirement of reasonableness to the unique facts of a case: &quot;Far from being susceptible to a 'neat set of legal rules,' [reasonable\r\n  suspicion] is . . . a 'commonsense, nontechnical conception [ ] that deal[s]\r\n  with the factual and practical considerations of everyday life on which\r\n  reasonable and prudent men, not legal technicians, act.'&quot; Â Id. (quoting Ornelas,\r\n  517 U.S. at 695-96); see also United States v. Branch, 537 F.3d 328, 336 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Ornelas).Â  In\r\n  this highly fact-specific inquiry,[4] reasonable suspicion &quot;is a fluid concept which takes its substantive\r\n  content from the particular context in which the standard is being\r\n  assessed.&quot;Â  United\r\n    States v. Foreman, 369 F.3d 776, 781 (4th Cir. 2004).Â  The law summarized above is well settled; the\r\n  application of the law to a specific set of facts in an individual case can be\r\n  unsettling.\r\nThere\r\n  are several important principles, however, that assist courts in the analysis.Â  In Branch, the Fourth Circuit stated &quot;it is entirely appropriate for courts to credit 'the practical\r\n  experience of officers who observe on a daily basis what transpires on the\r\n  street.'&quot;Â  537 F.3d at 336-37\r\n  (quoting United States v. Lender, 985 F.2d 151, 154 (4th Cir.\r\n  1993)).Â  Our own court has noted that in\r\n  reviewing a particular case, &quot;the court must consider the totality of the\r\n  circumstances.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Willard, 374 S.C. 129, 134, 647 S.E.2d 252, 255 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  Factors that are alone consistent with\r\n  &quot;innocent travel&quot; can, when &quot;taken together&quot; produce a\r\n  reasonable suspicion of criminal activity.Â  United States v. Sokolow,\r\n  490 U.S. 1, 9 (1989).Â  In applying\r\n  the concept of reasonable suspicion to the various facts of a case, &quot;[i]t\r\n  is the entire mosaic that counts, not single tiles.&quot; Â United States v.\r\n    Whitehead, 849 F.2d 849, 858 (4th Cir. 1988).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Application of Law to Facts\r\nWe\r\n  begin our discussion of the reasonableness of Corporal Crompton's suspicion that\r\n  Wallace was engaged in serious criminal activity by noting that Crompton was an\r\n  experienced officer.Â  Over the ten years\r\n  he worked in law enforcement before this arrest he had been continually\r\n  trained, including education in drugs and drug interdiction.Â  In his testimony at the suppression hearing, Crompton\r\n  described in detail what happened, what he observed, and the conclusions he\r\n  drew from those facts.Â  From this\r\n  testimony and from the totality of the circumstances of this case, we find\r\n  ample evidence to support the trial judge's ruling that Crompton's suspicion\r\n  was reasonable under the Fourth Amendment.Â  This evidence, which is described below, is sufficient to require that\r\n  we affirm under our deferential standard of review.Â  Compare Tindall, 388 S.C. at 521, 523 n.5, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  at 205, 206 n.5 with Tindall, 388 S.C. at 524-25, 527, 698 S.E.2d at 206-07, 208\r\n  (Kittredge, J., dissenting) (describing the standard of review as &quot;clear\r\n  error&quot; or &quot;any evidence.&quot;)\r\nWhen Crompton activated his\r\n  blue lights to make the traffic stop, Wallace &quot;hit his brakes, then he let\r\n  off his brakes and got right at the exit ramp . . . and then hit his brakes\r\n  again, and then drove halfway up the exit ramp before he decided to get on the\r\n  shoulder of the road.&quot;Â  This &quot;spark[ed] [Crompton's]\r\n  attention that there might be something else going on.&quot;Â After asking\r\n  Wallace for his license, registration, and proof of insurance, Crompton noticed\r\n  he was &quot;fumbling around&quot; and it took him approximately two minutes to\r\n  collect all of the documents, which is a longer period of time than Crompton testified\r\n  is normal.Â  During this time, the\r\n  passenger in Wallace's car looked straight ahead, did not help Wallace locate\r\n  any of the paperwork, and did not acknowledge Crompton's presence.Â  \r\nCrompton\r\n  asked Wallace to step out of the car and sit in the passenger's side of his\r\n  patrol vehicle, while the passenger remained in Wallace's car. Â Crompton asked Wallace where he was coming\r\n  from, and he answered, &quot;Atlanta,&quot;[5] but could not tell him how many days he spent there.Â  He appeared to get progressively more nervous\r\n  as he spoke, instead of gradually relaxing, which Crompton observed is the\r\n  normal reaction.[6]Â  When he ran Wallace's driver's license, the\r\n  report indicated that he had a previous alcohol related violation.Â  Crompton asked him about the violation, and\r\n  Wallace went into detail about the event and continued to talk nervously, which\r\n  Crompton described as &quot;nervous chitter.&quot;[7]Â  \r\nDuring\r\n  their conversation, a black BMW pulled up approximately seventy-five yards\r\n  behind the area where Wallace was pulled over.Â  The car remained for approximately two minutes and then drove away.Â  After seeing the BMW, Crompton walked from\r\n  his patrol vehicle over to Wallace's car to speak to the passenger.Â  As soon as Crompton approached the door of\r\n  the car, a cell phone in the car started ringing.Â  Crompton found this odd and consistent with\r\n  drug trafficking activity because drug traffickers use decoy cars and call each\r\n  other on cell phones during delivery trips.Â  Crompton asked the passenger questions, but he would &quot;hardly look&quot;\r\n  at Crompton and was sweating.Â  Crompton\r\n  testified that though it was noon in mid-September, Crompton was not sweatingâ€”even\r\n  wearing &quot;a bullet-proof vest and everything else.&quot;Â  As the passenger handed Crompton his\r\n  identification card, the card was &quot;moving up and down in a rapid\r\n  manner,&quot; indicating to Crompton that he was nervous.Â  The passenger said he and Wallace were coming\r\n  from a baby shower in Atlanta, where they stayed for one day.Â  Wallace had not mentioned a baby shower.Â  \r\nCrompton\r\n  walked back to his patrol vehicle to ask Wallace a few more questions.Â  Crompton testified Wallace said &quot;he\r\n  didn't know how many days he stayed [in Atlanta].Â  He told me one, then he told me two, then two days and one night.&quot;Â  He began to explain the traffic ticket to\r\n  Wallace and asked him where he lived.Â  At\r\n  that point, Wallace told Crompton he was actually not traveling from Atlanta,\r\n  but was coming from &quot;Lavonia or Lithonia.&quot;[8]Â  \r\nAs\r\n  Crompton finished explaining the ticket, Wallace &quot;was actually looking out\r\n  the window towards the woods . . . almost to the point that if he could have\r\n  got out of the car, . . . he would have been\r\n  gone.&quot;Â  He described Wallace at that\r\n  point as &quot;real defensive.&quot;Â  Crompton\r\n  asked if there was anything illegal in the car.Â  Wallace did not answer and &quot;wouldn't look at [him], he threw a wall\r\n  up and that was it.&quot;Â  Crompton then\r\n  asked several times if he could search the car. Â Wallace said &quot;if the vehicle was his, he\r\n  would give [Crompton] permission to search it; but due to the vehicle not being\r\n  his . . . he couldn't give that to [him].&quot;[9]Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  its brief, the State summarizes all of this evidence in the following fourteen\r\n  points:\r\n\r\n\t(1) after\r\n  he activated his blue lights, Wallace hit the brakes, let off the brakes, got\r\n  right to the exit ramp, then hit the brakes again and drove halfway up the exit\r\n  ramp before pulling off the road, all of which was outside the normal behavior\r\n  for traffic stops; (2) Wallace fumbled around for his license and the car\r\n  paperwork for longer than the normal time in routine traffic stops; (3) the\r\n  passenger (Hood) stared straight ahead and did not even acknowledge Cpl.\r\n  Crompton's presence; (4) Wallace and Hood gave different accounts of their\r\n  travel time and itinerary; (5) rather than calming down, Wallace became\r\n  increasingly nervous during his discussions with Cpl. Crompton; (6) a black BMW\r\n  pulled up behind Cpl. Crompton's patrol car on the side of the exit ramp, sat\r\n  there for a couple of minutes and then drove away as Cpl. Crompton was walking\r\n  toward Wallace's car to talk with Hood; (7) as Cpl. Crompton approached the car\r\n  to talk with Hood, a cell phone on the seat next to Hood started ringing but\r\n  Hood did not answer it; (8) drug dealers frequently use decoy cars and\r\n  communicate via cell phones when transporting drugs; (9) Hood would not look at\r\n  Cpl. Crompton when they were talking; (10) Hood was sweating even though it was\r\n  a mild day, and he was visibly nervous; (11) after Cpl. Crompton spoke to Hood,\r\n  Wallace changed his story about where they had been and how long they were\r\n  there; (12) the car Wallace was driving belonged to a third party who was not\r\n  present, which is common in drug cases; (13) I-85 is a known drug corridor; and\r\n  (14) Atlanta is a known drug source/hub city.\r\n\r\nWhile\r\n  none of these items independently amounts to a reasonable suspicion of criminal\r\n  activity, blending each of these &quot;tiles&quot; into the &quot;entire mosaic&quot;\r\n  of the totality of the circumstances, we believe Crompton had reasonable\r\n  suspicion to detain Wallace while he walked the drug dog around the car.Â  Thus, the trial judge ruled correctly to deny\r\n  the motion to suppress the cocaine.Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Other Issues\r\nWallace\r\n  argues the trial judge should not have allowed into evidence Wallace's statement\r\n  that the bag containing cocaine belonged to him.Â  Wallace requested and the judge conducted a Jackson\r\n    v. Denno[10] hearing at the beginning of Sergeant Colegrove's testimony.Â  However, Corporal Crompton\r\n  had already testified without objection that Wallace made the statement\r\n  identifying the bag as his.Â  As the trial\r\n  judge observed during the hearing, &quot;I can't do anything about something\r\n  that's already happened.&quot;Â  This\r\n  issue is not preserved because the evidence had already been presented to the\r\n  jury before Wallace made any objection to it.Â  See State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 142,\r\n  587 S.E.2d 691, 693-94 (2003).\r\nWallace\r\n  also challenges the denial of his motion for mistrial.Â  After deliberation began, the jury requested\r\n  that a portion of the videotape of the traffic stop be replayed.Â  The part replayed included footage not\r\n  previously shown to the jury of Wallace telling Corporal Crompton he had a\r\n  prior drug conviction.Â  The trial judge\r\n  determined that the error was harmless and denied the motion because Wallace\r\n  had testified about the same conviction during his direct examination. Â &quot;A mistrial\r\n  should not be granted except in cases of manifest necessity and ought to be\r\n  granted with the greatest caution for very plain and obvious reasons.&quot;Â  State v. Wasson, 299\r\n  S.C. 508, 510, 386 S.E.2d 255, 256 (1989).Â &quot;A trial judge's ruling on a motion for\r\n  mistrial will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion amounting to an\r\n  error of law.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Sparkman, 358 S.C. 491, 495, 596 S.E.2d 375, 377 (2004).Â  The judge's ruling was within his discretion.Â  \r\nV.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nThe\r\n  trial judge was correct to rule that the arresting officer had reasonable\r\n  suspicion to detain Wallace long enough to walk the drug dog around his\r\n  car.Â  Wallace's argument regarding his\r\n  statement claiming ownership of the bag is not preserved for our review.Â  The judge acted within his discretion in\r\n  denying Wallace's motion for a mistrial.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Wallace does not contend the second detention began\r\n  until Crompton said &quot;hang tight.&quot;Â  During the suppression hearing, trial counsel stated, referring to the\r\n  &quot;hang tight&quot; directive: &quot;At that point the traffic stop ended\r\n  and this turns into another type of stop where the officer has to have some\r\n  sort of a reasonable and articulable suspicion of continuing criminal\r\n  activity.&quot;Â  \r\n[2]Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n[3] Sergeant Colegrove testified that after Wallace was arrested, he took Wallace back to the\r\n  sheriff's office and made some phone calls in an attempt to corroborate what\r\n  Wallace told him and to make the intended delivery.Â  Wallace cooperated in that effort, but it was\r\n  not successful. \r\n[4] Tindall, 388 S.C. at 527, 698\r\n  S.E.2d at 208 (Kittredge, J., dissenting).\r\n[5] Crompton testified Atlanta is a &quot;hub city&quot;\r\n  where drugs are distributed and Interstate 85 is a known drug corridor. Â \r\n[6] Crompton testified that Wallace's nervousness was\r\n  visible on the video of the traffic stop, the relevant portion of which was\r\n  shown to the trial judge. Â \r\n[7] The alcohol violation itself is of no significance to\r\n  our analysis.Â  We include it only as\r\n  context for Crompton's testimony about the &quot;nervous chitter.&quot;\r\n[8] Crompton testified he couldn't tell whether Wallace\r\n  said Lavonia or Lithonia, but both are reasonably near Atlanta.Â  Regarding the discrepancy, however, Crompton\r\n  testified: &quot;If I go to Atlanta, I know I'm in Atlanta.Â  . . .Â  And if I get stopped and somebody asks me where I'm coming from, if I go\r\n  to Lithonia, then I know I've been to Lithonia.&quot;Â  \r\n[9]A female who was not present was listed as the owner\r\n  of the car.Â  \r\n[10] 378 U.S. 368 (1964).\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4801","title":"The Estate of Helen Duffy","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=4801","description":"In this appeal from the probate court, the Court of Appeals finds Robert Davitt failed to present clear and convincing evidence that he was the common law spouse of the late Helen Duffy and thus affirms the probate court's denial of his claim for an elective share of her estate.","date":"2011-03-02","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody {\r\n\tfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\n\ttext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Court of Appeals\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn Re: The Estate of Helen P.

Dukes, III, Special\r\n  Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â Â  4801\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2011 â€“ Filed March 2,\r\n  2011\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tStephen Edward Carter, of Hilton Head Island, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDean Britton Bell, of Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: On\r\n  appeal, Robert Davitt (Robert) claims he presented satisfactory evidence to\r\n  establish he was the common law spouse of Helen Duffy (Helen);[1] thus, the circuit court erred in\r\n  affirming the probate court's determination that Robert was not entitled to an\r\n  elective share of Helen's estate.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRobert and Helen met in 1991 after being\r\n  introduced by a mutual friend.Â  Both parties were widowed and had children from\r\n  prior marriages.Â  In 1992, they began cohabiting in New York until they moved\r\n  to South Carolina in 1998.Â  Upon moving,\r\n  Helen purchased a home in the Sun City community in Bluffton, South Carolina.Â \r\n  Robert lived with Helen in her home until shortly before Helen's death in April\r\n  2006.Â  After Helen's death, Robert petitioned for a determination of his status\r\n  as Helen's surviving spouse and his entitlement to an elective share of her\r\n  estate.Â  Â Â \r\nThe probate court held a non-jury trial on June 27,\r\n  2007.Â  At trial, Robert presented twelve witnesses from the Sun City community\r\n  who collectively testified that after moving to South Carolina, Helen and\r\n  Robert continuously lived together and had a reputation in the community as\r\n  being married.Â  Robert introduced evidence to corroborate this testimony,\r\n  including numerous undated Valentine's Day, Father's Day, and birthday cards.Â \r\n  Many of these cards referred to Robert as Helen's husband and some explicitly\r\n  referenced their marriage.Â  Robert also submitted numerous photographs of Helen\r\n  wearing a ring on her ring finger as well as a copy of their church pictorial\r\n  directory, which listed the couple as &quot;Bob &amp; Helen Davitt.&quot;Â  One\r\n  of Helen's daughters, Nancy Soeker, testified she heard Helen refer to Robert\r\n  as her husband to other people; however, Helen never directly told Nancy that\r\n  she and Robert were married. Â \r\nAt\r\n  the one-day trial, Helen's estate presented Helen's last will and testament as\r\n  well as her second amendment and restatement of trust, which Helen executed in\r\n  November 2004.Â  The second amendment states, \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Settlor is living with, but is not married to, ROBERT M. DAVITT, and has\r\n  intentionally omitted him from any provisions or distributions to be made\r\n  hereunder except as may be expressly provided for herein.Â  Settlor's assets\r\n  were derived from the assets and estates of her [two] prior spouses . . . and\r\n  it is her intent and desire to protect and preserve those assets for the\r\n  benefit of her three living children . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nHelen's\r\n  attorney, Michael E. Cofield (Cofield), testified he prepared both of those\r\n  documents based on input from Helen alone.Â  Cofield also stated her three\r\n  children brought Helen to his office, but none of them were present when Helen\r\n  signed the second amendment and restatement of trust, and he had no discussion\r\n  with any of her children about the contents of Helen's will.Â  In\r\n  addition, the estate introduced a letter written by Robert to his children on\r\n  July 24, 1999, which stated, &quot;Just for the record[] â€“ everything is\r\n  Helen's â€“ the house, the contents, the car â€“ if I pass on, my estate is the [two]\r\n  Schwab accounts and a checking account.Â  If Helen goes first â€“ her Will will\r\n  take care of all . . . .&quot;Â  \r\nRobert\r\n  testified he and Helen maintained a &quot;house account,&quot; into which they\r\n  deposited both of their social security checks and paid joint living expenses;\r\n  however, only Helen's name was on the account.Â  Helen also maintained her own\r\n  personal checking account, and both parties kept their personal assets\r\n  separate.Â  Robert acknowledged that he and Helen designated their filing status\r\n  as &quot;single&quot; on their federal income tax returns, despite the option\r\n  to file as &quot;married filing separately.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  its order, the probate court found Robert was not the common law spouse of\r\n  Helen.Â  As such, the probate court denied Robert's petition to find he and\r\n  Helen were lawfully married and consequently declined to award Robert an\r\n  elective share of Helen's estate.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  issue of common law marriage sounds in law.Â  Tarnowski v. Lieberman, 348\r\n  S.C. 616, 619, 560 S.E.2d 438, 440 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Because this action sounds\r\n  in law, and the existence of a common law marriage is a question of fact, this\r\n  court is bound by the probate court's factual findings and its credibility\r\n  determinations. Â Barker v. Baker, 330 S.C. 361, 370, 499 S.E.2d 503, 508\r\n  (Ct. App. 1998). Â Consequently, our review in this case is limited to a\r\n  determination of whether or not there is any evidence to support the findings\r\n  of the probate court. Â Weathers v. Bolt, 293 S.C. 486, 488, 361 S.E.2d\r\n  773, 774 (Ct. App. 1987). Â &quot;[T]he question is not what conclusion this [c]ourt\r\n  would have reached had it been the fact-finder, but whether the facts as found\r\n  by the probate court have evidence to support them.&quot; Â Barker, 330\r\n  S.C. at 370, 499 S.E.2d at 508.Â  Therefore, we must affirm if any evidence\r\n  supports the probate court's findings.Â  Tarnowski, 348 S.C. at 619, 560\r\n  S.E.2d at 440.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRobert contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in upholding the probate court's determination that he\r\n  failed to establish a common law marriage. Specifically, Robert claims the\r\n  circuit court erred in affirming the probate court because the probate court\r\n  improperly weighed (1) the testimony of the witnesses in their community, (2) the\r\n  testimony of Helen's estate attorney, and (3) Robert's and Helen's federal\r\n  income tax returns.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn South\r\n  Carolina, a common law marriage is formed when two parties have a present\r\n  intent to enter into a marriage contract.Â  Â Id., 348 S.C. at 619, 560\r\n  S.E.2d at 440.Â  An express contract is not always necessary as the intent to be\r\n  married can be inferred from the circumstances.Â  Kirby v. Kirby, 270\r\n  S.C. 137, 140, 241 S.E.2d 415, 416 (1978).Â  It is essential to a common law\r\n  marriage that a mutual agreement exists between the parties to assume toward\r\n  each other the relationship of husband and wife. Â Johnson v. Johnson,\r\n  235 S.C. 542, 550, 112 S.E.2d 647, 651 (1960). \r\nThe\r\n  party seeking to establish the existence of a common law marriage carries the\r\n  burden of proof.Â  Ex parte Blizzard, 185 S.C. 131, 133, 193 S.E. 633,\r\n  634 (1937).Â  Because Robert sought to establish the existence of a common law\r\n  marriage after Helen's death, section 62-2-802(b)(4) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (2009)[2] requires proof by clear and convincing evidence. \r\nClear\r\n  and convincing evidence is that &quot;degree of proof which will produce in the\r\n  [fact-finder] a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established.\r\n  Such measure of proof is intermediate, more than a mere preponderance but less\r\n  than is required for proof beyond a reasonable doubt; it does not mean clear\r\n  and unequivocal.&quot;Â  Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 483, 570\r\n  S.E.2d 535, 538 (Ct. App. 2002) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted).\r\nIn\r\n  finding Robert failed to establish a common law marriage by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence, the probate court duly considered the existence of\r\n  evidence to support a common law marriage, including: (1) numerous celebration\r\n  cards from Helen to Robert with notations indicating a marital relationship;\r\n  (2) photographs depicting Helen wearing a ring on her ring finger; and (3)\r\n  testimony from twelve witnesses in the Sun City community, all testifying that\r\n  the parties lived together continuously and were regarded in the community as\r\n  husband and wife.Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  the foregoing testimony and evidence, the probate court effectively gave more\r\n  weight to the evidence negating the existence of a common law marriage.Â  The probate\r\n  court emphasized Helen's last will and testament and her second amendment and\r\n  restatement of trust that declared she was &quot;living with, but [] not\r\n  married to, Robert M. Davitt,&quot; which the court concluded was a clear\r\n  expression of her state of mind regarding her relationship with Robert.Â \r\n  Moreover, the probate court recounted her attorney's testimony that he\r\n  witnessed Helen execute those documents and that he prepared the documents based\r\n  on input only from Helen.Â  The probate court found Robert's letter to his\r\n  children served to buttress other evidence and testimony at the hearing that\r\n  both parties intended to keep their assets separate and distinct.Â  Last, the\r\n  probate court considered the parties' decision to file their federal income\r\n  taxes as &quot;single&quot; rather than &quot;married filing separately&quot;\r\n  as evidence Robert and Helen did not intend to be married.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the probate court, as the fact-finder, is afforded the discretion to weigh the\r\n  evidence in probate matters, and there is evidence in the record to support the\r\n  probate court's decision, we find the circuit court properly affirmed the\r\n  probate court.Â  See Barker, 330 S.C. at 370, 499 S.E.2d at 508\r\n  (&quot;[T]he question is not what conclusion this [c]ourt would have reached\r\n  had it been the fact-finder, but whether the facts as found by the probate\r\n  court have evidence to support them.&quot;). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the circuit court's decision is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3]\r\nFEW, C.J., and SHORT,\r\n  J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] For ease of reference, we refer to the parties by\r\n  their first names.\r\n[2] Section 62-2-802(b)(4) states that a surviving spouse\r\n  does not include: \r\n\r\n\t[A] person\r\n  claiming to be a common law spouse who has not been established to be a common\r\n  law spouse by an adjudication commenced before the death of the decedent or\r\n  within the later of eight months after the death of the decedent or six months\r\n  after the initial appointment of a personal representative; if the action is\r\n  commenced after the death of the decedent, proof must be by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence. \r\n\r\n[3] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4802","title":"Bean v.

(SCCR).Â  The circuit court granted summary judgment to SCCR,\r\n  noting Bean executed a valid release agreement that precluded all of his\r\n  claims. Â In this appeal, Bean asserts numerous points of error, namely, that\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to SCCR when (1) Bean\r\n  presented evidence that the release was procured by fraud, the release was\r\n  executed pursuant to a mutual mistake, and the release failed for lack of\r\n  consideration; (2) Bean was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to conduct\r\n  discovery essential to his claims prior to the grant of summary judgment; and\r\n  (3) Bean presented evidence of SCCR's negligence as causing or contributing to\r\n  his injury.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nShane Bean suffered an on-the-job injury in August of\r\n  2004 when his boot slipped off the bottom step of a stationary locomotive while\r\n  dismounting it, causing him to fall to the ground and injure his right knee.[2]Â \r\n  Bean was subsequently diagnosed with a torn anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) in\r\n  his right knee.Â  Dr. Terence W. Hassler, the doctor who performed two surgeries\r\n  on Bean's knee, signed a disability certificate on October 11, 2004, noting\r\n  Bean was sufficiently recovered to return to work and resume a normal workload\r\n  &quot;as tolerated.&quot;Â  Bean returned to work for SCCR and performed\r\n  primarily engine duty until March 2005 with the assistance of a knee brace.\r\nIn March of 2005, Bean underwent ACL reconstruction\r\n  surgery and took six months off to recover.Â  In April of 2005, Bean\r\n  suffered another injury when he fell off the front steps of his home while\r\n  using crutches after a rain storm.Â  Bean suffered a fractured right knee\r\n  cap and underwent additional surgery.Â  Bean remained on paid medical\r\n  leave with SCCR until September of 2005, when he returned to work.Â  SCCR paid\r\n  all of Bean's medical bills and lost wages during his six-month medical leave.\r\nOn September 1, 2005, Dr. Hassler signed\r\n  another disability certificate noting Bean was sufficiently recovered to return\r\n  to work with the following limitations: &quot;Engine Duty Only / No ground work\r\n  for 6 mths.&quot;Â  On September 29, 2005, Dr. Hassler issued a third\r\n  disability certificate with the following limitation:Â  &quot;Engine Duty and\r\n  light ground work only.&quot;\r\nDuring his deposition, Bean explained he thought\r\n  &quot;light ground work&quot; included dismounting the locomotive and aligning\r\n  three to four switches during a tour of duty.Â  When asked if Dr. Hassler\r\n  specifically told Bean his restriction was permanent, Bean answered &quot;He\r\n  said that in order for my knee to last I would have to take care of it.Â  He\r\n  mentioned to me that one more fall, one more good fall would probably wipe my\r\n  knee out for good.&quot;Â  According to Bean, Dr. Hassler told him his\r\n  restriction would continue &quot;as long as nothing changed with my\r\n  knee.&quot;Â  \r\nUpon returning to\r\n  work for SCCR, Bean complained to Natalie Jones, the nurse representative\r\n  employed by SCCR to handle his case, about his desire not to do any night work\r\n  due to the increased tripping hazards.Â  Jones spoke to SCCR management and Bean\r\n  was transferred to daytime engine duty work within several weeks. Â Bean\r\n  admitted his coworkers and supervisors at SCCR accommodated his restrictions\r\n  and permitted him to perform only engine duty and light ground work. \r\nBean began\r\n  settlement negotiations with Bill Monroe, a claims representative consultant\r\n  for Rail America,[3] in June of 2006.Â  Bean\r\n  testified &quot;at that time I thought that my best interest would be to play\r\n  fair with the railroad and see what they had to say about the situation.&quot;Â \r\n  Monroe told Bean he had the option of hiring an attorney, and Bean chose not to\r\n  do so.Â  Bean testified he chose not to hire an attorney because he believed\r\n  &quot;I would work with them, and they would hopefully work with me.&quot;Â \r\n  Bean admitted SCCR management did not expressly tell him he should not hire an\r\n  attorney, or threaten him with the loss of his job if he chose to hire an\r\n  attorney.\r\nHowever, Bean did\r\n  contend that several days after the incident, John Atkinson, an SCCR\r\n  Trainmaster and Bean's supervisor, took him to the Hartsville Army Navy store\r\n  and bought him a pair of Oakley sunglasses. Â During this outing, Atkinson\r\n  allegedly told Bean he could either hire an attorney and litigate his claim for\r\n  several years, or he could settle with the railroad and return to work.Â \r\n  Atkinson also told Bean he could probably get $50,000 from the railroad if he\r\n  decided to settle his claim.\r\nAs a result of\r\n  Bean's settlement discussions with Monroe, Bean executed a &quot;General\r\n  Release and Final Settlement&quot; releasing SCCR from all claims of liability\r\n  for his knee injury. Â Bean testified that prior to signing the release,\r\n  he asked Monroe if SCCR knew he had a permanent restriction.Â  Monroe allegedly\r\n  told Bean that SCCR was aware of his permanent restriction and &quot;they were\r\n  willing to work with me on that, and accommodate me.&quot;Â  According to\r\n  Bean, Monroe also told him that the permanent work restriction language, i.e.\r\n  light ground work and engine duty, &quot;could not&quot; be inserted into the\r\n  release.Â  Despite knowing the release contained no work restriction limitation\r\n  language, Bean signed the release and accepted $75,000 from SCCR as part of the\r\n  terms of the settlement.\r\nAfter executing the release, Bean continued to work\r\n  for SCCR for another ten months without incident or complaint.Â  In mid-April of\r\n  2007, Bean left for vacation for a week and upon his return he noticed he had\r\n  been assigned a conductor's job.Â  Bean complained to Michael Rogers and John\r\n  Atkinson, Trainmasters for SCCR, and informed them that he was on a permanent\r\n  restriction and therefore could not work as a conductor.Â  SCCR management asked\r\n  Bean to secure a medical release from his doctor indicating whether he had any\r\n  permanent medical restrictions.Â  Bean visited Dr. Hassler again and allegedly\r\n  produced a note to SCCR management stating his permanent work restriction, i.e.\r\n  engine duty and light groundwork, had not changed.[4]Â \r\n  According to Bean, Atkinson told him not to return to work until he had a full\r\n  medical release.Â  According to Rogers, SCCR management told Bean to go home\r\n  until he could provide SCCR with a document clarifying his medical condition.\r\nOn May 10, 2007, approximately\r\n  three weeks later, SCCR faxed Bean a &quot;return-to-work&quot; agreement\r\n  providing as follows:\r\n\r\n\tShane\r\n  Bean will return to work on Monday, May 14, 2007, under the restrictions of an\r\n  extended light duty as instructed on the return to work release we received\r\n  from Dr. Hassler on 09/29/05.Â  [Bean] will be on engine duty with some light\r\n  ground work.Â  Light ground work meaning he is able and capable of getting off\r\n  the engine to throw switches, make couplings, apply/release handbrakes, etc.Â \r\n  [Bean] will also be able to work as a conductor in an emergency situation (lack\r\n  of qualified persons, etc.) for a short term. . . . . [SCCR] will make a\r\n  reasonable effort to accommodate [Bean's] condition based on seniority.Â  [SCCR]\r\n  would require [Bean] to provide an update on his condition from his doctor\r\n  every six months. \r\n\r\nBean testified he refused to\r\n  sign this accommodation letter because the offer was &quot;vague&quot; with\r\n  regard to how long he would be forced to work as a conductor.Â  Bean never\r\n  returned to SCCR, nor did he call to inform the company he was not coming back.\r\nBean applied for and accepted a job in Spartanburg two\r\n  days after receiving the faxed work accommodation agreement from SCCR.Â  Rogers\r\n  sent Bean a letter on May 21, 2007, noting he would be terminated for job\r\n  abandonment if he did not return to work or contact SCCR management.Â  Bean\r\n  failed to respond or appear, and he was terminated after a hearing on May 24,\r\n  2007.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBean filed a\r\n  complaint on August 14, 2007, against SCCR for negligence under FELA and for\r\n  violations of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act.[5]Â \r\n  In addition, Bean alleged fraud and negligent misrepresentation with respect to\r\n  SCCR's statements and conduct in the execution of the release.Â  SCCR filed a\r\n  motion for summary judgment arguing the release executed by Bean precluded any\r\n  personal injury claims against SCCR under FELA.Â  SCCR further argued Bean was\r\n  unable to demonstrate his injuries were caused by SCCR's negligence.Â  Bean\r\n  filed a memorandum in opposition to summary judgment arguing the release was\r\n  invalid based on fraud, mutual mistake of fact, and lack of consideration.Â  \r\nBean also filed an affidavit in opposition to SCCR's\r\n  summary judgment motion noting &quot;I provided John Atkinson a copy of Dr.\r\n  Hassler's return to work form dated September 29, 2005 where he permanently\r\n  placed me on engine duty only and light ground work.&quot;Â  Bean further\r\n  explained, &quot;Under no circumstances would I have accepted [the $75,000\r\n  settlement] money if I knew the railroad would require me to work beyond my\r\n  physical limitations as explained by Dr. Hassler and in essence take my job\r\n  from me.&quot;Â  With regard to why the permanent work restriction language\r\n  could not be included in the release, Bean stated &quot;I believed the reason\r\n  it was not in the release is because I was already back to work.Â  Therefore,\r\n  there was no need to sign a get back to work form or have that language in the\r\n  release.&quot;Â  Finally, Bean concluded, &quot;The railroad induced me to enter\r\n  into the settlement under the promise and representation that I would get back\r\n  to work and that they would accommodate my medical restrictions.&quot;\r\nDuring the hearing on the summary judgment motion,\r\n  Bean's counsel argued several material facts were in dispute, including whether\r\n  Bean's work restriction was permanent or temporary, and whether the release\r\n  applied to Bean's employment claims in addition to his personal injury claims.Â \r\n  The circuit court entered an order granting SCCR's motion for summary judgment\r\n  on the grounds that the release was validly executed.Â  The circuit court did\r\n  not reach the issue of SCCR's negligence or Bean's request to conduct further\r\n  discovery prior to the summary judgment ruling.Â  Bean did not file a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to alter or amend.Â  This appeal followed.Â Â  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp;

Â Norton v. Norfolk S. Ry., 350 S.C. 473, 476, 567\r\n  S.E.2d 851, 853&nbsp;(2002).Â  However, a local form of practice may not defeat\r\n  a federal right. Â Id. Â It is firmly established that questions of the sufficiency\r\n  of the evidence for the jury in cases arising under FELA in state courts are to\r\n  be determined by federal rules. Â Brady v. S. Ry., 320 U.S. 476, 479\r\n  (1943).Â  A summary judgment motion involves analysis of the sufficiency of the\r\n  evidence, and therefore federal law applies.[6]Â  See Anderson v.\r\n    Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 249-50 (1986) (explaining that when\r\n  determining whether summary judgment is appropriate, the judge's function is\r\n  not to weigh the evidence and determine the truth of the matter, but to\r\n  ascertain whether &quot;there is sufficient evidence favoring the nonmoving\r\n  party for a jury to return a verdict for that party&quot;); see also Peterson\r\n    v. Nat'l R.R. Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 396-97, 618 S.E.2d 903,\r\n  905-06&nbsp;(2005) (applying federal procedural law to an appeal of a summary\r\n  judgment motion in a state FELA action).[7]Â  \r\nRule 56(c), FRCP, provides\r\n  summary judgment is appropriate &quot;if the movant shows that there is no\r\n  genuine dispute as to any material fact and the movant is entitled to judgment\r\n  as a matter of law.&quot;Â  The substantive law identifies which facts are material,\r\n  and &quot;[o]nly disputes over facts that might affect the outcome of the suit\r\n  under the governing law will properly preclude the entry of summary\r\n  judgment.&quot;Â  Anderson, 477 U.S. at 248.Â  &quot;Factual disputes that\r\n  are irrelevant or unnecessary will not be counted.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nA dispute about a\r\n  material fact is genuine only if there is a sufficient evidentiary basis that\r\n  would allow a reasonable fact finder to return a verdict for the non-moving\r\n  party.Â  Id. at 248.Â  &quot;If the evidence is merely colorable, or is\r\n  not significantly probative, summary judgment may be granted.&quot;Â  Id. at 249-50 (internal citations omitted). Â &quot;The\r\n  mere existence of a scintilla of evidence in support of the plaintiff's\r\n  position will be insufficient; there must be evidence on which the jury could\r\n  reasonably find for the plaintiff.&quot;Â  Id. at 252; Brady,\r\n  320 U.S. at 479 (&quot;The weight of the evidence under the Employers'\r\n  Liability Act must be more than a scintilla before the case may be properly\r\n  left to the discretion of the trier of factâ€“in this case, the jury.&quot;); accord Hancock, 381 S.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at 803 (&quot;[I]n cases\r\n  applying federal law, we hold that the non-moving party must submit\r\n  more than a mere scintilla of evidence to withstand a motion for summary\r\n  judgment.&quot;).\r\nIn addition, a\r\n  challenge to the validity of a release under FELA raises a federal question to\r\n  be determined by federal rather than state law.Â  Dice v. Akron, Canton &amp;\r\n    Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S. 359, 361 (1952).Â  &quot;One who attacks a settlement\r\n  must bear the burden of showing that the contract he has made is tainted with\r\n  invalidity, either by fraud practiced upon him or by a mutual mistake under\r\n  which both parties acted.&quot;Â  Callen v. Pennsylvania R.R., 332 U.S.\r\n  625, 630 (1948).Â  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; AVAILABILITY OF\r\n  SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN A FELA ACTIONÂ Â Â  \r\nThe first issue\r\n  Bean raises on appeal is whether summary judgment was improper because a\r\n  challenge to the validity of a release precluding a railroad employee's FELA\r\n  claims is a question of fact that must always be submitted to a jury.[8]Â \r\n  We disagree that a FELA case must always be submitted to a jury when an\r\n  employee challenges the validity of a release.Â  Â  \r\n&quot;Despite its\r\n  great utility in many kinds of litigation, the motion for summary judgment is\r\n  not well adapted to cases under FELA.&quot;Â  11 Am. Jur. Trials Â§ 397\r\n  (1966).Â  &quot;This does not mean that the motion is never available.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  Particularly with regard to negligence claims brought by an employee against a\r\n  railroad, there is a federal policy in favor of jury trials when there is\r\n  evidence to support negligence in a FELA action.Â  See Millner v.\r\n    Norfolk &amp; W. Ry., 643 F.2d 1005, 1010&nbsp;(4th Cir. 1981); 11 Am. Jur. Trials Â§ 397 (1966) (&quot;Summary judgment is almost always unavailable\r\n  on the issue of negligence.&quot;).Â  &quot;The right to trial by jury is a\r\n  basic and fundamental feature of our system of federal jurisprudence.&quot; Â Bailey\r\n    v. Central Vermont Ry., 319 U.S. 350, 354 (1943) (citations and quotations\r\n  omitted).Â  &quot;It is part and parcel of the remedy afforded railroad workers\r\n  under the [Federal] Employers' Liability Act.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;To\r\n  deprive these workers of the benefit of a jury trial in close or doubtful cases\r\n  is to take away a goodly portion of the relief which Congress has afforded\r\n  them.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  this strong federal policy in favor of jury trials when there is any evidence\r\n  to support a negligence claim, the South Carolina Supreme Court affirmed the\r\n  grant of summary judgment in a FELA action in Peterson v. Nat'l R.R.\r\n    Passenger Corp., 365 S.C. 391, 401-02, 618 S.E.2d 903, 908&nbsp;(2005)\r\n  (affirming the grant of summary judgment to a railroad when there was\r\n  insufficient evidence of negligence on the railroad's behalf). \r\nWe next turn to\r\n  address the narrower issue of whether summary judgment is appropriate when an\r\n  employee challenges the validity of a release in a FELA action.Â  The Fourth\r\n  Circuit has cited Dice v. Akron, Canton &amp; Youngstown R.R., 342 U.S.\r\n  359 (1952), for the proposition that the issue of whether an employee is\r\n  entitled to rescind a release due to fraud is &quot;triable to a jury as of\r\n  right.&quot; Â Millner, 643 F.2d at 1010.Â  Therefore, an analysis of Dice is warranted here.Â  \r\nIn Dice, a\r\n  railroad employee claimed the release he signed was void and subject to\r\n  recission due to fraud because he signed it relying on the railroad's\r\n  deliberately false statement that the document was only a receipt for back\r\n  wages.Â  342 U.S. at 360.Â  The issue of fraud in the execution of a release was\r\n  properly submitted to a jury based on conflicting evidence, and the jury\r\n  returned with a verdict in the employee's favor.Â  Id. at 363.Â  However,\r\n  the trial court entered a judgment notwithstanding the verdict, applying Ohio\r\n  law on the issue of fraud.Â  Id. at 360.Â  The United States Supreme Court\r\n  reversed, noting the trial court erred in applying Ohio state law to a FELA\r\n  release, and in taking away the jury's verdict for the employee &quot;when the\r\n  issues of fraud had been submitted to the jury on conflicting evidence .\r\n  . . .&quot;Â  Id. at 363 (emphasis added).Â  Dice was not an appeal\r\n  from the grant of summary judgment, and there is no language in Dice implying summary judgment may not ever be granted in a FELA action when the\r\n  employee challenges the validity of a release.Â  \r\nIn addition, none\r\n  of the federal cases Bean relies upon for supporting authority expressly hold a\r\n  challenge to the validity of a FELA release must be submitted to a jury,\r\n  even in the absence of any genuine issue of material fact.Â  The cases Bean\r\n  cites only suggest that between a judge and a jury, any disputed factual issues\r\n  should be determined by a jury.Â  See Maynard v. Durham &amp; S. Ry.,\r\n  365 U.S. 160, 163 (1961) (reversing the grant of a motion for a nonsuit when a\r\n  genuine issue of fact existed as to whether the amount paid by a railroad to\r\n  its employee was consideration for the release or mere payment for back wages); Dice, 342 U.S. at 363-64 (reversing a judgment notwithstanding the\r\n  verdict when the issue of fraud in the execution of a release was properly\r\n  submitted to a jury on conflicting evidence, and the jury returned with a\r\n  verdict in the employee's favor); Callen v. Pennsylvania R.R., 332 U.S.\r\n  625, 628-29 (1948) (finding the circuit court erred in charging the jury that a\r\n  release was valid and binding when conflicting evidence was presented during\r\n  trial as to whether a mutual mistake of fact existed when the release was\r\n  executed); Counts v. Burlington N. R.R., 952 F.2d 1136, 1140-41, 1144\r\n  (9th Cir. 1991) (finding a new trial was warranted when the trial court\r\n  incorrectly charged the jury on the law for invalidating a release and an issue\r\n  of fact was raised as to whether there was a mutual mistake of fact in the\r\n  execution of the release); Turner v. Burlington N. R.R., 771 F.2d 341,\r\n  344-45 (8th Cir. 1985) (noting railroad's equitable counterclaim for specific\r\n  performance of a settlement agreement was properly submitted to a jury, and not\r\n  triable to the court, in light of FELA's policy of providing railroad workers\r\n  the benefit of a jury trial); Millner, 643 F.2d at 1009-10 (finding\r\n  motion to dismiss was improperly granted when disputed facts existed regarding\r\n  whether the employee's counsel had express authorization to accept the terms of\r\n  a proposed settlement offer).Â  \r\nNone of the cases\r\n  Bean cites involved an appeal from the grant of summary judgment.Â  However, the\r\n  First Circuit analyzed Dice with respect to a summary judgment appeal in Camerlin v. New York Cent. R.R., 199 F.2d 698, 703&nbsp;(1st Cir.\r\n  1952).Â  The Camerlin court noted: &quot;We take it as an a fortiori conclusion from the majority opinion in Dice that on a complaint in a\r\n  federal district court under [FELA], if there are any genuine issues of fact\r\n  relevant to the validity of a purported release, such issues are to be\r\n  determined by the jury, not by the trial judge.&quot;Â  Camerlin, 199\r\n  F.2d at 703 (internal citations omitted).Â  The First Circuit recognized that\r\n  &quot;if the release was binding on the plaintiff,\r\n  even accepting the truth of his version of the facts, as recited in his\r\n  deposition, then the case was a proper one for summary judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 703.Â  However, the employee in Camerlin alleged he was led to accept\r\n  a $950 settlement upon the mistaken assumption that his rights were limited by\r\n  the New York Workmen's Compensation Act.Â  Id.Â  Based on this mistake of\r\n  law, the First Circuit noted summary judgment was inappropriate.Â  Id. at\r\n  703-04.\r\nIn both Dice and Camerlin, and in the other authority Bean relies upon for support, a\r\n  genuine issue of material fact was in dispute with respect to the validity of a\r\n  release.Â  The existence of a factual dispute regarding the validity of a FELA\r\n  release precludes summary adjudication by a judge without a jury trial.Â \r\n  However, when there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute, summary\r\n  judgment is not precluded solely because a case involves a challenge to the\r\n  validity of a FELA release.Â  \r\nWe recognize upholding a grant of summary judgment in\r\n  a FELA case is not the general trend in federal case law.Â  However, at least\r\n  one federal court has granted a railroad's summary judgment motion after the\r\n  employee challenged the validity of a release. Â Heston v. Chicago &amp; N.\r\n    W. Ry., 341 F. Supp. 126, 128&nbsp;(N.D. Ill. 1972) (granting a railroad's\r\n  summary judgment motion where an employee agreed to execute a release despite\r\n  his alleged mistake of fact as to the exact future effects of a present injury\r\n  that was fully known to him at the time of settlement to be of a permanent,\r\n  painful, and serious nature).[9]Â  Based on this opinion\r\n  and also on the First Circuit's reasoning in Camerlin, we do not believe\r\n  a challenge to the validity of a release necessarily precludes the grant of summary\r\n  judgment in a FELA action.Â  See Camerlin, 199 F.2d at 703.\r\nAs discussed below,\r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact in dispute with regard to the\r\n  validity of Bean's release.Â  Bean testified he was told SCCR would &quot;work\r\n  with&quot; him to accommodate his injury.Â  This vague remark does not\r\n  rise to the level of an affirmative misrepresentation or mistake of fact as to\r\n  the contents of the release.Â  Furthermore, Bean's testimony alone does not\r\n  constitute more than a mere scintilla of evidence required to survive summary\r\n  judgment in a FELA action.Â  See Anderson, 477 U.S. at 252; Brady,\r\n  320 U.S. at 479; accord Hancock, 381 S.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  at 803.Â  Therefore, we hold summary judgment was appropriate under the facts of\r\n  this case.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; VALIDITY OF THE FELA RELEASE\r\n&quot;FELA releases\r\n  may be set aside on the grounds of fraud, lack of consideration, and mutual\r\n  mistake.&quot;Â  Counts,&nbsp;952 F.2d at 1142 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  Bean raises all three grounds for rescinding the release in this\r\n  appeal.Â  Therefore, we will address each ground in turn.Â  \r\nA.&nbsp; Fraud\r\nThe first ground\r\n  Bean raises for setting aside the release is fraud.Â  Bean alleges the circuit\r\n  court erred in granting summary judgment to SCCR when he presented evidence\r\n  that Monroe and SCCR management fraudulently induced him to sign the release.Â \r\n  Specifically, Bean contends Monroe failed to fully explain his FELA rights,\r\n  despite Monroe's knowledge that Bean was not represented by counsel.Â  Bean\r\n  further argues that Monroe misrepresented the scope of the claims being\r\n  released.Â  Finally, Bean submits Monroe's assertion that his employment\r\n  restrictions &quot;could not&quot; be put in the release was a material\r\n  misstatement concerning the contents of the release.Â  We disagree on all\r\n  points.Â Â  \r\nUnder FELA, &quot;a\r\n  release of rights . . . is void when the employee is induced to sign it by the\r\n  deliberately false and material statements of\r\n  the railroad's authorized representatives made to deceive the employee as to\r\n    the contents of the release.&quot;Â  Dice, 342 U.S. at 362 (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  Fraud is generally found when the railroad misrepresents the extent or\r\n  scope of a release, or when the railroad presents the release as an entirely\r\n  different type of document.Â  See id. at 360, 363 (finding a\r\n  general release was void as a matter of federal law when the employee relied on\r\n  the employer's deliberately false statement that the document he signed was\r\n  nothing more than a receipt for back wages); Fournier v. Canadian Pacific\r\n    R.R., 512 F.2d 317, 318-19 (2d Cir. 1975) (holding the district court erred\r\n  in granting summary judgment to a railroad on the issue of a general release's\r\n  validity where the release was presented to the employee as one applying only\r\n  to his claim for back wages).Â  But cf. Larson v. Burlington N. and\r\n    Santa Fe Ry., 2004 WL 692259, at *7 (D. Minn.) (finding in an unreported\r\n  opinion that a railroad was entitled to summary judgment on an employee's FELA\r\n  claims when the railroad's misrepresentations went to the method used to\r\n  calculate the settlement amount, and not to the contents of the release\r\n  itself).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  to Bean's allegation of a fraudulent oral promise made by SCCR with respect to\r\n  his future employment duties, the facts of Camerlin are sufficiently\r\n  similar and warrant discussion.Â  199\r\n  F.2d at 700-01.Â  In Camerlin, the district\r\n  court granted the railroad's motion for summary judgment and the employee\r\n  appealed.Â  Id.Â  The district court arguably declined to consider an\r\n  affidavit the employee filed with the court after his deposition.Â  Id. at 701.Â  The affidavit contained an oral promise by the claims agent of a\r\n  lifetime job upon the employee's return to work.Â  Id.Â  The First Circuit\r\n  held that this alleged promise was not relevant to any material fact, and,\r\n  therefore, any error in excluding it was not prejudicial.Â  Id.Â  The Camerlin court further explained:\r\n\r\n\tIf the\r\n  release were otherwise valid and binding, it could not be avoided on account of\r\n  the railroad's subsequent nonfulfillment of this oral promise allegedly made by\r\n  the claim agent in the course of negotiations leading to the settlement. It is\r\n  not asserted that the parties meant to include this oral promise in the written\r\n  contract of settlement, and that it was omitted therefrom by mutual mistake. .\r\n  . . Nor do the above-stated allegations\r\n  in the affidavit make out a case of fraud on the agent's part in the\r\n  sophisticated sense that the agent procured the plaintiff's execution of the\r\n  release in part by making an oral promise which he then and there had no\r\n  intention to fulfill, or which he knew the railroad would not fulfill. Â The mere fact that the railroad subsequently did not\r\n  give plaintiff a lifetime job is not, without more, a basis for inferring as a\r\n  fact that the claim agent made the promise in bad faith, misrepresenting his\r\n  then state of mind.\r\n\r\nId.Â  However, the railroad in Camerlin also misled the employee to think the maximum amount he was entitled to recover\r\n  under FELA was limited by the New York Workmen's Compensation Act.Â  Id. at 703.Â  Therefore, the First Circuit reversed the award of summary judgment on\r\n  the basis of this latter misrepresentation, calling it a &quot;mistake of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Id. at 703-04.Â Â  \r\nEven taking Bean's\r\n  allegations as true, Bean does not allege any fraud as to the contents of\r\n    the release.Â  Monroe allegedly told Bean that SCCR was willing to\r\n  &quot;work with&quot; Bean to accommodate his permanent restrictions.Â  The\r\n  language of the release does not address Bean's future employment duties, nor\r\n  does it state whether Bean's injury was of a permanent nature.Â  Like the oral\r\n  promise in Camerlin, the purported fraud here relates only to an\r\n  extrinsic statement Bean alleges was made by Monroe in order to induce him to\r\n  sign the release.Â  During his deposition, Bean admitted he knew the agreement\r\n  itself did not contain any language about a permanent work restriction before\r\n  signing it.Â  \r\nIn addition, the\r\n  extrinsic oral agreement was not deliberately false or made to deceive Bean.Â \r\n  Once Bean voiced a complaint about his expected employment duties in April of\r\n  2007, SCCR asked Bean to secure a disability certificate indicating whether his\r\n  release was permanent.Â  SCCR's request implied it was willing to abide by such\r\n  a certificate.Â  In fact, as demonstrated by the &quot;return-to-work&quot;\r\n  agreement Rogers faxed to Bean, SCCR was indeed willing to accommodate Bean's\r\n  medically recommended work restrictions.Â  The faxed work agreement provided\r\n  &quot;[Bean] will be on engine duty with some light ground work,&quot; which is\r\n  the exact limitation language contained in Bean's medical disability\r\n  certificate.Â  The &quot;return-to-work&quot; agreement further noted\r\n  &quot;[SCCR] will make a reasonable effort to accommodate [Bean's] condition\r\n  based on seniority.&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  record reflects that SCCR did attempt to &quot;work with&quot; and accommodate\r\n  Bean's injury.Â  Furthermore, we believe testimony about a vague remark that\r\n  SCCR would &quot;work with&quot; Bean does not rise to the level of an\r\n  affirmative misrepresentation made by the railroad as to the contents of the\r\n  release.Â  See Church v. Burlington N. R.R., 1990 WL 114580, at *2\r\n  (N.D. Ill.) (granting summary judgment for the defendant railroad in an\r\n  unreported opinion when an employee claimed he was told it was company policy\r\n  for the railroad to &quot;take care of its employees,&quot; noting this vague\r\n  remark was insufficient to establish any affirmative promise made on the\r\n  railroad's behalf). Â \r\nBean submits Monroe's statement that his work\r\n  limitations &quot;could not&quot;  be included in the release does go to the contents of the release.Â  Bean\r\n  suggests this was a false representation made to deceive Bean as to the\r\n  contents of the release.Â  We disagree.Â  Bean conceded during his deposition\r\n  that the only purported misrepresentation Monroe made to him was whether the\r\n  railroad knew he had a permanent work restriction and whether SCCR would honor\r\n  that restriction.Â  At no point during Bean's deposition did he suggest that he\r\n  believed he was not releasing his employment claims because of the absence of\r\n  this language in the release.Â  Stated differently, Bean did not ever allege\r\n  that SCCR intentionally excluded any employment claim language from his release\r\n  in order to deceive him as to his future employment claims.Â  Indeed, Bean\r\n  admitted in his affidavit that he believed the reason this language was not\r\n  included in the release was because he was already back to work.Â  In addition,\r\n  no dispute about Bean's work duties arose until April of 2007.Â  Therefore, this\r\n  argument is unfounded.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  Bean contends the release was induced by fraud because Monroe failed to fully\r\n  explain his FELA rights, despite Monroe's knowledge that Bean was not represented\r\n  by counsel.Â  We note that this argument is not preserved for review because\r\n  Bean failed to make this specific fraud argument to the circuit court or raise\r\n  it in a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend.Â  See Doe v. Doe,\r\n  370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (&quot;To preserve an\r\n  issue for appellate review, the issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court.&quot;); id. at 212, 634 S.E.2d at 54-55 (&quot;Therefore, when an appellant\r\n  neither raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the\r\n  issue is not preserved for appellate review.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly, Bean\r\n  failed to present more than a scintilla of evidence as to the allegation that\r\n  the railroad made deliberately false and material statements intended to\r\n  deceive him as to the contents of the release.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Mutual Mistake of Fact\r\nThe second ground Bean raises on appeal for setting\r\n  aside the release is a mutual mistake of fact.Â  Specifically, Bean argues\r\n  summary judgment was inappropriate because a mutual mistake of fact existed\r\n  that was material to the release at the time the release was executed.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA FELA release may be set aside on the basis of a\r\n  mutual mistake of fact in executing the release.Â  See Callen v.\r\n    Pennsylvania R.R., 332 U.S. 625, 630 (1948).Â  &quot;One who attacks a\r\n  settlement must bear the burden of showing that the contract he has made is\r\n  tainted with invalidity . . . by a mutual mistake under which both parties\r\n    acted.&quot;Â  Id. (emphasis added).Â  &quot;In order to rescind or\r\n  invalidate [a FELA] release, it is necessary to show a mistake concerning past\r\n  or present facts material to the agreement; a mistake as to the future effect\r\n  of presently known facts will not affect the validity of the agreement.&quot;Â  Heston,\r\n  341 F. Supp. at 128.Â  \r\nInitially, Bean\r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding a release may only be set aside when\r\n  the mutual mistake goes to the nature of the injury.Â  This argument\r\n  misconstrues the circuit court's order. Â The circuit court found: &quot;No\r\n  mutual mistake existed between the parties.&quot;Â  Therefore, the language of\r\n  the order was not expressly limited to a mistake of fact as to the nature of\r\n  plaintiff's injury.\r\nBean has failed to\r\n  meet his burden of proof to demonstrate a mutual mistake of fact in existence\r\n  at the time the release was signed.Â  There are several reasons why Bean's\r\n  mutual mistake argument must fail.Â  First, Bean's belief about the permanency\r\n  of his injury was at best a unilateral mistake of fact, as opposed to a mutual\r\n  mistake of fact.Â  SCCR management was unclear as to whether Bean was\r\n  permanently or temporarily injured, while Bean believed he was permanently\r\n  injured.Â  Cf. Callen, 332 U.S. at 628-29 (finding enough evidence\r\n  of a mutual mistake of fact to submit the issue to a jury when both the\r\n  employee and the railroad were under the mutual mistaken belief that the\r\n  employee was not permanently injured, and the parties arguably settled on that\r\n  basis); Counts, 952 F.2d at 1141 (finding evidence of a mutual mistake\r\n  of fact when both the employee and the railroad were under the mutual mistaken\r\n  belief that the employee would lose his guaranteed job protection if he\r\n  returned to another position with the railroad, and the release contained\r\n  language releasing all future employment claims against the railroad). \r\nSecond, the evidence in the record does not support\r\n  Bean's assertion that he had a permanent disability.Â  Bean stated his injury\r\n  was permanent based on &quot;Dr. Hassler's return to work form dated September\r\n  29, 2005 where he permanently placed me on engine duty only and light ground\r\n  work.&quot;Â  However, the disability certificate dated September 29, 2005,\r\n  states the following limitations, &quot;Engine Duty and light ground work\r\n  only.&quot;Â  The certificate does not mention whether the injury is permanent\r\n  or temporary.Â  During Bean's deposition, he admitted Dr. Hassler told him his\r\n  work restrictions would continue &quot;as long as nothing changed with my\r\n  knee.&quot;Â  This statement does not indicate a permanent injury unlikely to\r\n  change.\r\nThird, Bean cannot\r\n  demonstrate a mutual mistake of fact that existed at the time the release was\r\n  signed.Â  The dispute concerning Bean's work limitations did not arise until\r\n  April of 2007, which was approximately ten months after the release was signed.Â \r\n  Further, no evidence in the record indicates the parties intended to include\r\n  Bean's work limitations in the release, yet omitted the language by mutual\r\n  mistake.Â  At best, the evidence demonstrates a mutual mistake as to the future\r\n  effects of a presently known medical condition.Â  Federal case law has found\r\n  this type of mistake of fact insufficient to void a release.Â  See Heston,\r\n  341 F. Supp. at 128.Â  \r\nLastly, even\r\n  assuming both parties held the same mistaken belief about the permanency of\r\n  Bean's injury, that belief was not material to the release because the release\r\n  contains no language regarding the nature of Bean's injury or its effect on his\r\n  future employment duties with SCCR.Â  See Heston, 341 F. Supp. at\r\n  128; Camerlin, 199 F.2d at 700-01.Â  Bean knew that the release contained\r\n  no language to this effect when he signed it.Â  \r\nBean also argues\r\n  because the release mentions nothing about Bean's future employment with SCCR,\r\n  a jury could find the parties were operating under a mutual mistake of fact as\r\n  to whether Bean released his employment claims along with his personal injury\r\n  claims.Â  We disagree.Â  There is no evidence in the record demonstrating SCCR\r\n  intended for Bean to retain his right to sue for employment-related claims, and\r\n  yet omitted this language from the release by mutual mistake.Â  In addition,\r\n  neither Bean's deposition testimony nor his affidavit suggest Bean believed he\r\n  had retained the right to sue for future employment-related claims.Â  \r\nThe release\r\n  language applies to &quot;all claims which I have or may hereafter have, for\r\n  personal injuries, known or unknown, and/or loss of any kind resulting\r\n  or in any way arising from an accident which occurred at or near Darlington,\r\n  South Carolina on or about August 21, 2004.&quot; (emphasis added). Â The\r\n  release is entitled &quot;General Release and Final Settlement.&quot;Â  Based on\r\n  the broad language of the release, and the corresponding lack of evidence to\r\n  contradict this language, Bean has not met his burden of proof to demonstrate a\r\n  mutual mistake of fact regarding whether the release applied to future\r\n  employment-related claims.Â  \r\nAccordingly, Bean\r\n  did not present more than a scintilla of evidence to demonstrate a mutual\r\n  mistake of fact in existence at the time the release was signed.Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Lack of Consideration \r\nThe third and final\r\n  ground Bean raises for setting aside the release is lack of consideration.Â \r\n  Bean argues a genuine issue of material fact existed as to whether the release\r\n  was supported by adequate consideration, thereby precluding summary judgment.Â \r\n  Specifically, Bean contends he would not have accepted the $75,000 or signed\r\n  the release had he known SCCR would not accommodate his work restrictions.Â \r\n  Bean further alleges $75,000 was a nominal sum for a permanent injury that\r\n  subsequently resulted in the loss of his employment.Â  Therefore, Bean submits\r\n  the oral agreement with respect to Bean's future employment duties was the\r\n  material inducement for signing the release, and once the oral agreement\r\n  failed, there was a lack of consideration for the release rendering it\r\n  invalid.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;In order that there may be consideration, there must be\r\n  mutual concessions.&quot;Â  Maynard v. Durham &amp; S. Ry., 365\r\n  U.S. 160, 163 (1961) (citations and quotations omitted). Â &quot;A release is not supported by sufficient consideration\r\n  unless something of value is received to which the creditor had no previous\r\n  right.&quot;Â  Id. Â &quot;If, in other words, an employee receives wages\r\n  to which he had an absolute right, the fact that the amount is called\r\n  consideration for a release does not make the release valid.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn Maynard, the employee claimed the check he received in exchange for a\r\n  release of his FELA rights was actually a pay check, rightfully owed to him.Â  Id. at 161-62. Â The employer claimed no back wages were due and an amount equal to\r\n  back wages was paid in exchange for the release.Â  Id. at 162-63. Â The\r\n  United States Supreme Court found a genuine issue of material fact existed with\r\n  respect to whether the employee received consideration that precluded summary\r\n  judgment.Â  Id. at 163.Â  \r\nBean\r\n  admittedly received a check in the amount of $75,000 from SCCR in return for\r\n  releasing any and all claims related to his knee injury.Â  Bean received these\r\n  funds in addition to wages and medical expenses.Â  During settlement\r\n  discussions, Monroe offered Bean $50,000, and Bean made a counteroffer for\r\n  $100,000.Â  The parties settled on $75,000 after two settlement meetings.Â  Bean\r\n  purchased two cars and made upgrades to his home with the settlement proceeds.Â \r\n  Bean does not argue he had any pre-existing right to these settlement\r\n  proceeds.Â  Therefore, the $75,000 was a material inducement to signing the\r\n  release.Â  See Counts, 952 F.2d at 1140 (holding a release was supported by\r\n  adequate consideration and the issue should not have been submitted to a jury\r\n  when the employee admittedly received $70,423 in addition to his wage entitlement in exchange\r\n  for signing the release).\r\nIn\r\n  addition, Bean received consideration because the oral promise Bean allegedly\r\n  relied on in signing the release was subsequently fulfilled.Â  SCCR did attempt\r\n  to &quot;work with&quot; Bean to accommodate his medical restrictions as noted\r\n  by Dr. Hassler.Â  The faxed &quot;return-to-work&quot; agreement provided Bean\r\n  would be on &quot;engine duty with some light ground work.&quot;Â  Therefore, no\r\n  genuine issue of material facts exists as to whether the release should be void\r\n  for lack of consideration.Â  \r\nFinally, Bean argues $75,000\r\n  was a nominal sum for a permanent injury.Â  We note this issue has been\r\n  abandoned on appeal because Bean cites no case law in support of this\r\n  argument.Â  Mulherin-Howell v.\r\n    Cobb, 362 S.C. 588, 600, 608 S.E.2d\r\n  587, 593-94&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (finding an issue was\r\n  deemed abandoned on appeal when appellant cited no legal authority to support\r\n  the argument and the argument itself was merely conclusory).Â  In addition, the\r\n  entire argument on appeal consists of a single sentence.Â  Englert,\r\n    Inc. v. Netherlands Ins. Co., 315 S.C. 300, 304 n.2, 433 S.E.2d 871,\r\n  873&nbsp;n.2 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding a one-sentence argument was too\r\n  conclusory to present any issue on appeal).Â  Therefore,\r\n  we need not address whether $75,000 constitutes a nominal sum.\r\nIII.&nbsp; OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCOVERY\r\nWe\r\n  next turn to address Bean's argument that he was not afforded a reasonable\r\n  opportunity to complete discovery essential to SCCR's summary judgment motion\r\n  before the hearing on the motion.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  argument is not preserved for this court's review.Â  Although the parties\r\n  discussed the possibility of additional discovery at the summary judgment\r\n  hearing,[10] the circuit court did\r\n  not rule on Bean's discovery argument in its order granting summary judgment\r\n  and Bean did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion asking the circuit court to\r\n  rule on the issue of insufficient discovery.Â  Therefore, the question of\r\n  whether summary judgment was proper in light of Bean's desire to complete\r\n  further discovery is not preserved for this court's review.Â  See Doe\r\n    v. Doe, 370 S.C. 206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (holding\r\n  that to preserve an issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial court); id. at 212, 634 S.E.2d at 54-55\r\n  (&quot;Therefore, when an appellant neither raises an issue at trial nor\r\n  through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the issue is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;).\r\nIV.&nbsp; NEGLIGENCE\r\nThe\r\n  final argument Bean raises on appeal is whether summary judgment was\r\n  inappropriate because there was a genuine issue of material fact in dispute as\r\n  to whether SCCR was negligent in causing or contributing to Bean's injury.Â  The\r\n  circuit court did not address the issue of SCCR's negligence in its order\r\n  granting summary judgment, and Bean did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to\r\n  obtain a ruling on this issue.Â  Therefore, the issue of SCCR's negligence was\r\n  not preserved for appellate review.Â  See Doe v. Doe, 370 S.C.\r\n  206, 212, 634 S.E.2d 51, 54&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006) (holding that to preserve an\r\n  issue for appellate review, the issue must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\n  by the trial court); id. at 212, 634 S.E.2d at 54-55 (&quot;Therefore, when an appellant neither\r\n  raises an issue at trial nor through a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, the issue is\r\n  not preserved for appellate review.&quot;).\r\nAccordingly, the\r\n  order granting summary judgment is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTHOMAS and\r\n  PIEPER, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] 45 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 51 to -60 (2007).Â  Under FELA, railroad\r\n  carriers are liable to their employees for any injuries resulting, in whole or\r\n  in part, from the employerâ€™s negligence.&nbsp; See 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51.\r\n[2] Bean's complaint alleged the fall was due to oil\r\n  and grease on the ground in the area where the locomotive was stationed.Â \r\n  However, during his deposition, Bean admitted he was not looking down at his\r\n  feet as he dismounted the locomotive and it was possible the accident was his\r\n  own fault.Â  \r\n[3] Monroe was a senior claims manager with Railroad Risk\r\n  Management, Inc., a company contracted by Rail America, the parent company of\r\n  SCCR.\r\n[4] The record on appeal does not contain any notes or\r\n  disability certificates from Dr. Hassler in the year 2007.Â  \r\n[5] Although Bean refers to this claim in his complaint\r\n  as a violation of the Federal Railroad Safety Authorization Act, we note that this code section, formerly referred to as the Boiler\r\n  Inspection Act, later became the Locomotive Inspection Act (LIA). Â See 49 U.S.C. Â§ 20701 (2007).Â  \r\n[6] Although not raised on appeal, we note the\r\n  circuit court incorrectly cited South Carolina procedural law for the burden of\r\n  proof to survive summary judgment in its order.Â  Because the burden of proof to\r\n  survive summary judgment in federal court is more than a scintilla of\r\n  evidence, and the circuit court granted summary judgment applying the less\r\n  stringent state standard of proof, this error of law is not determinative of\r\n  the overall appeal.Â  See Brady, 320 U.S. at 479; accord Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803&nbsp;(2009) (&quot;[W]here\r\n  the federal standard applies, . . . there must be more than a scintilla\r\n  of evidence in order to defeat a motion for summary judgment.&quot;) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\n[7] We note that our supreme court applied South Carolina\r\n  procedural law to a summary judgment motion in a FELA action in Montgomery\r\n    v. CSX Transp., Inc., 376 S.C. 37, 47, 656 S.E.2d 20, 25&nbsp;(2008).Â \r\n  However, this Court is bound by the subsequent Hancock decision, in\r\n  which the supreme court clarified the burden of proof to survive a summary\r\n  judgment motion in state cases applying federal law.Â  Hancock, 381 S.C.\r\n  at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at 802-03; accord Brady, 320 U.S. at 479.Â Â Â Â  \r\n[8] We note that this issue was not included in Bean's\r\n  Statement of the Issues on Appeal.Â  Therefore, we need not address this\r\n  argument on the merits.Â  See Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR (&quot;Ordinarily,\r\n  no point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the\r\n  issues on appeal.&quot;). Â However, because this issue is pertinent to the\r\n  disposition of the overall appeal, we proceed to address the merits.Â Â Â  \r\n[9] Two other federal courts have granted summary\r\n  judgment in unreported opinions despite an employee's challenge to the validity\r\n  of a FELA release:Â  Larson v.\r\n    Burlington N. and Santa Fe Ry., 2004\r\n  WL 692259, at *7 (D. Minn.) (finding a railroad was entitled to summary\r\n  judgment on an employee's claims when the railroad's misrepresentations went to\r\n  the method used to calculate the settlement amount, and not to the contents of\r\n  the release itself); Church v. Burlington N. R.R., 1990 WL 114580, at *2\r\n  (N.D. Ill.) (granting summary judgment for the defendant railroad when an\r\n  employee claimed he was told it was company policy for the railroad to &quot;take\r\n  care of its employees,&quot; noting this vague remark was insufficient to\r\n  establish any affirmative promise made on the railroad's behalf). \r\n[10] In addition, Bean's counsel asked for a ruling on the\r\n  merits during the summary judgment hearing, thereby conceding that additional\r\n  discovery was not needed prior to ruling on summary judgment.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4803","title":"State v.

Knox McMahon, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4803\r\nSubmitted January 1, 2011 â€“ Filed March 2,\r\n  2011Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJames Ross Snell, Jr., of Lexington, for\r\n  Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRachel Donald Erwin, of Blythewood, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:Â \r\n  Appellant Charles Brandon Branham was convicted of driving under the influence,\r\n  first offense, following a jury trial in the magistrate's court.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the magistrate's refusal to dismiss the case due to the State's\r\n  failure to provide Branham with a videotape of his breath alcohol analysis test\r\n  (breath test).Â  On appeal, Branham argues the court must dismiss his conviction\r\n  because the State did not produce the videotape.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nTrooper K.G. Ginn of the South Carolina Highway Patrol arrested Branham for suspicion\r\n  of driving under the influence.Â  A breath test was administered.Â  Branham\r\n  appeared pro se before the magistrate to plead not guilty and to request a jury\r\n  trial.Â  At a pretrial hearing, Branham did not indicate he wished to hire an\r\n  attorney.Â  On the day of jury selection, Branham did not appear in court and a\r\n  jury was selected in his absence for a trial to begin the following day.Â  On\r\n  the day of jury selection but after a jury had been selected, Branham contacted\r\n  the magistrate's court asking for a continuance because his attorney could not\r\n  attend trial the next day.Â  The court advised Branham that it would not grant\r\n  him a continuance.Â  At 4:54 p.m. the same day, attorney James Snell contacted\r\n  the magistrate's court and requested a continuance because he was scheduled to\r\n  appear for guilty pleas in the circuit court at the same time as Branham's\r\n  trial.Â  The magistrate contacted the circuit court and arranged for Snell to be\r\n  present for Branham's trial.\r\nOn the day\r\n  of trial, Snell moved to dismiss the charge because the State had not provided\r\n  Branham with a videotape of the breath test site.Â  The magistrate denied the\r\n  motion.Â  The magistrate also delayed the start of the trial to permit Snell to\r\n  review evidence and discuss the case with Trooper Ginn.Â  Trooper Ginn testified\r\n  on behalf of the State.Â  The State also entered the incident site videotape,\r\n  implied consent form, and breath alcohol analysis test report (datamaster\r\n  ticket) into evidence.Â  The datamaster ticket contained a notice at the bottom\r\n  that Branham could view the breath test site video by means of an internet\r\n  website at www.sled.sc.gov and provided Branham with an I.D. and password to\r\n  access the video.Â  The jury found Branham guilty of driving under the influence\r\n  and the magistrate sentenced Branham to thirty days, suspended upon payment of\r\n  a fine.\r\nBranham\r\n  appealed to the circuit court, asking the court to either dismiss the\r\n  conviction because the State failed to produce the breath test site videotape\r\n  or remand for a new trial because the magistrate failed to grant a continuance\r\n  so the State could produce the videotape.Â  On appeal, the circuit court\r\n  affirmed the magistrate's refusal to grant Branham's motion to dismiss.Â  The\r\n  circuit court also found that Branham's request for a continuance was not\r\n  preserved for review because the magistrate's return did not indicate that a\r\n  motion for a continuance was made.Â  Alternatively, the circuit court concluded\r\n  that Branham's continuance request, if made, was untimely because it was made\r\n  after jury selection on the morning of trial.Â  Branham appealed to this court,\r\n  arguing only that his conviction should be dismissed for failure to produce the\r\n  breath test site videotape.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn a\r\n  criminal appeal from the magistrate's court, the circuit court does not review\r\n  the matter de novo.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-25-105&nbsp; (Supp. 2010).Â  The appeal must\r\n  be heard by the circuit court upon the grounds of exceptions made and the\r\n  record on appeal, without the examination of witnesses.Â  S.C.

Â§\r\n  18-3-70 (Supp. 2010).Â  The circuit court &quot;may either confirm the sentence\r\n  appealed from, reverse or modify it, or grant a new trial.&quot;Â  Id.Â \r\n  The appellate court's review in criminal cases is limited to correcting the\r\n  order of the circuit court for errors of law.Â  City of Rock Hill v.\r\n    Suchenski, 374 S.C. 12, 15, 646 S.E.2d 879, 880 (2007).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAt the\r\n  outset, we note that this case involves only the breath test site video\r\n  required by section 56-5-2953(A)(2) of the South Carolina Code (2006)[2] and does not involve the incident\r\n  site video, which was produced at trial by the State.Â  We also specifically\r\n  note that this case does not involve any claim that the video was not\r\n  accessible or available online.Â  Thus, we analyze this case within this\r\n  context.\r\nSection\r\n  56-5-2953(B) of the South Carolina Code (2006) provides that a &quot;[f]ailure\r\n  by the arresting officer to produce the videotapes required by this section is\r\n  not alone a ground for dismissal&quot; if certain exceptions apply.Â  The\r\n  statutory exceptions are: Â (1) if the arresting officer submits a sworn\r\n  affidavit certifying the video equipment was inoperable despite efforts to\r\n  maintain it and there was no operable breath test facility available in the\r\n  county; (2) if the officer submits a sworn affidavit that it was impossible to\r\n  produce the videotape because the defendant either (a) needed emergency medical\r\n  treatment or (b) exigent circumstances existed; and (3) in circumstances\r\n  including but not limited to road blocks, traffic accidents, and citizens'\r\n  arrests.Â  Id.Â  Other exceptions are possible as the statute further\r\n  provides, &quot;[n]othing in this section prohibits the court from considering\r\n  any other valid reason for the failure to produce the videotape based upon the totality\r\n  of the circumstances. . . .&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nIn City of Rock\r\n  Hill v. Suchenski, our supreme court found dismissal of the charge was &quot;an\r\n  appropriate remedy&quot; where a violation of section 56-5-2953(A) was &quot;not\r\n  mitigated&quot; by an exception from subsection (B).Â  374 S.C. 12, 17, 646\r\n  S.E.2d 879, 881 (2007).Â  On appeal, the City argued its noncompliance was\r\n  excused pursuant to the exceptions listed in section 56-5-2953(B); however, the\r\n  supreme court refused to consider the City's arguments because they were not\r\n  preserved for appellate review.Â  Id. at 15-16, 646 S.E.2d at 880.Â  In\r\n  finding dismissal an appropriate remedy, the supreme court stated &quot;failure\r\n  to produce videotapes would be a ground for dismissal if no exceptions apply.&quot;[3]Â  Id. at 16, 646 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nBranham\r\n  argues that the State has inexcusably failed to comply with section 56-5-2953.Â \r\n  Branham further asserts that his failure to timely file a Rule 5 motion is not\r\n  an exception to the State's statutory duty to produce a videotape from the\r\n  breath test site; thus, Branham asserts his conviction must be vacated.Â  \r\nPursuant to Rule 5\r\n  of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure, the prosecution must\r\n  disclose certain types of information upon request of the defendant.Â  The\r\n  magistrate's return does not indicate Branham made an oral or written request\r\n  for discovery.Â  However, at the hearing before the circuit court, Branham's\r\n  attorney argued that he made a Rule 5 motion orally before the magistrate.Â  The\r\n  circuit court addressed this assertion as a part of Branham's argument that the\r\n  magistrate erred in refusing to grant a continuance in order to allow him to\r\n  obtain and evaluate the breath test site videotape.Â  First, the circuit court\r\n  found Branham's issue on appeal was not preserved for the circuit court's\r\n  appellate review because the magistrate's return did not indicate that Branham\r\n  made a motion for continuance on the date of trial.Â  The circuit court then\r\n  alternatively ruled that the magistrate did not abuse her discretion in\r\n  refusing to grant a continuance.Â  In so doing, the circuit court found &quot;a\r\n  discovery request was not made until the morning of the trial.&quot;Â  The\r\n  circuit court also noted that the magistrate acted within her discretion when\r\n  she delayed the start of the trial to permit Branham's attorney to confer with\r\n  the prosecuting officer.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Branham has abandoned his argument that he made an oral motion for\r\n  discovery pursuant to Rule 5 because: Â (1) he did not contest the circuit\r\n  court's ruling regarding the magistrate's failure to grant a continuance in his\r\n  appellate brief and (2) Branham does not argue on appeal that he orally\r\n  requested discovery.Â  See State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 17, 518\r\n  S.E.2d 278, 282 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting an issue not argued in the appellate\r\n  brief is deemed abandoned on appeal); Rule 208(b)(1)(B) (&quot;Ordinarily, no\r\n  point will be considered which is not set forth in the statement of the issues\r\n  on appeal.&quot;).Â  Further, because the court also alternatively ruled that\r\n  Branham made an untimely discovery motion and Branham did not contest that\r\n  finding, we find this alternative ground constitutes an independent basis to uphold\r\n  the decision finding Branham's continuance request untimely.Â  See State\r\n    v. Galloway, 305 S.C. 258, 262-63, 407 S.E.2d 662, 665 (Ct. App. 1991)\r\n  (declining to reach the merits of the issue where appellant failed to appeal an\r\n  alternative ruling, which constituted an independent ground for upholding the\r\n  judgment); see also State v. Hicks, 387 S.C. 378, 379, 692 S.E.2d\r\n  919, 920 (2010) (affirming the ruling of the trial court because the appellant\r\n  failed to appeal all grounds upon which the ruling was based); Jones v. Lott,\r\n  387 S.C. 339, 346, 692 S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (&quot;Under the two issue rule,\r\n  where a decision is based on more than one ground, the appellate court will\r\n  affirm unless the appellant appeals all grounds because the unappealed ground\r\n  will become the law of the case.&quot;).Â  Thus, we find the circuit court's\r\n  decision that the magistrate properly proceeded with the trial without\r\n  permitting more time for discovery is the law of the case.\r\nTherefore,\r\n  we are left with Branham's sole issue on appeal as to whether the State failed\r\n  to comply with any statutory duty to produce the breath test site video\r\n  pursuant to section 56-5-2953.Â  This case\r\n  presents in part the question of whether a statutory obligation to produce the\r\n  breath test site video imposes any different obligations upon counsel to\r\n  request discovery as counsel would in any other context.Â  Branham asserts that\r\n  the statute places no burden on the defendant to request production of the\r\n  video in advance of trial.Â  To resolve this question, we must determine the\r\n  meaning of the word &quot;produce&quot; within the statutory framework at\r\n  issue.\r\n\r\n&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one\r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in\r\n  the language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the\r\n  intended purpose of the statute.&quot;Â  State v. Sweat, 386 S.C. 339,\r\n  350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010).Â  The court should look to the plain language\r\n  of the statute.Â  Binney v. State, 384 S.C. 539, 544, 683 S.E.2d 478, 480\r\n  (2009).Â  In interpreting a\r\n  statute, the court will give words their plain and ordinary meaning, and will\r\n  not resort to forced construction that would limit or expand the statute.Â  Harris\r\n  v. Anderson Cnty. Sheriffâ€™s Office, 381 S.C. 357, 362, 673 S.E.2d 423, 425\r\n  (2009).Â \r\n  \r\n  The\r\n    meaning of the word &quot;produce&quot; in the context of section 56-5-2953(B)\r\n    has not been addressed by the appellate courts of this state.Â  Black's Law\r\n    Dictionary defines &quot;produce&quot; as &quot;to provide (a document,\r\n    witness, etc.) in response to a subpoena or discovery request.&quot;Â  Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary (9th Ed. 2009).Â  &quot;Produce&quot; is also defined by Black's\r\n    Law Dictionary as &quot;to bring into existence; to create.&quot;Â  Dictionary.com\r\n    offers a similar definition: &quot;to make or manufacture.&quot;Â  Merriam-Webster\r\n    defines &quot;produce&quot; as &quot;to cause to have existence or to\r\n    happen&quot; and &quot;to give being, form, or shape to; make, especially\r\n    manufacture.&quot; Merriam-Webster additionally includes these definitions:Â \r\n    &quot;to offer to view or notice&quot; and &quot;to give birth or rise to:\r\n    yield.&quot;Â  The World English Dictionary provides other definitions of\r\n    &quot;produce,&quot; including &quot;to bring forth (a product) by mental or\r\n    physical effort; make&quot; and &quot;to manufacture (a commodity).&quot;Â  &quot;Produce&quot;\r\n    also means &quot;to present to view:Â  to produce evidence&quot; and &quot;to\r\n    bring before the public,&quot; according to the World English Dictionary.Â  Essentially,\r\n    Branham is asserting that &quot;produce&quot; within the statute means the\r\n    state has an affirmative duty to hand over or to turn over the video,\r\n    regardless of whether an actual or formal request was made for it.\r\n  Within\r\n    the statutory framework at issue, we find the definition of the word\r\n    &quot;produce&quot; intended by the General Assembly to be consistent with the\r\n    following definitions: to bring into existence; to create; to manufacture; or\r\n    to cause to have existence or to bring forth by mental or physical effort.Â  We\r\n    find support in this definitional approach from words in the statute itself.Â \r\n    For example, in section 56-5-2953(B), an officer may submit a sworn affidavit\r\n    certifying it &quot;was physically impossible to produce the videotape because\r\n    the person needed emergency medical treatment, or exigent circumstances\r\n    existed.&quot;Â  The use of the phrase &quot;was physically impossible&quot; instead\r\n    of &quot;is physically impossible&quot; suggests a focal point at the time of the\r\n    event.Â  Thus, utilizing that time framework as our perspective, the meaning we\r\n    ascribe to the word &quot;produce&quot; best fits within the statutory context\r\n    as opposed to a meaning suggested by Branham, such as to physically hand over\r\n    or turn over the videotape.Â  Quite simply, we find the legislature intended\r\n    that a video of the breath test site be created.\r\n  Moreover,\r\n    the definition we adopt also encompasses the situation where the arresting\r\n    officer is not the person who conducts the breath test.Â  In this situation, the\r\n    arresting officer may bring the video into existence or cause the video to be\r\n    created by taking the individual to the site where the test and video will be conducted\r\n    by a certified datamaster operator.\r\n  Notwithstanding,\r\n    even if we were to adopt a different meaning of the word &quot;produce,&quot;\r\n    such as to present to view, to bring before the public, or even to hand over or\r\n    turn over, we nonetheless find the State has met any obligation created by the\r\n    statute.Â  In State v. Landon, 370 S.C. 103, 634 S.E.2d 660 (2006), our\r\n    supreme court reviewed the State's alleged violation of section 56-5-2954 of\r\n    the South Carolina Code (2006), which statutorily requires the State Law\r\n    Enforcement Division (SLED) to maintain a detailed record of malfunctions,\r\n    repairs, complaints, or other problems regarding breath test devices at each\r\n    breath test site.Â  The court found SLED satisfied the record-keeping\r\n    requirement of the statute by making its internet records available at the\r\n    breath test site.Â  Landon, 370 S.C. at 108, 634 S.E.2d at 663.Â  Although\r\n    the case was remanded for further proceedings, we utilize Landon by\r\n    analogy and find the arresting officer's duty to &quot;produce&quot; the\r\n    videotape of the breath test site pursuant to section 56-5-2953 is met where\r\n    the video is made available online and is accessible to the defendant.Â  Whether\r\n    the word &quot;produce&quot; is alternatively defined as to present to view or\r\n    to hand or turn over, or some similar meaning, by making the breath test site video\r\n    available online and accessible to the defendant, we find the State met its\r\n    burden of producing the breath test video.Â  We decline to find the State may\r\n    only satisfy any statutory obligation by physically handing or turning over the\r\n    videotape to the defendant or counsel.\r\n  While\r\n    we need not rely on typical criminal discovery jurisprudence in reaching our\r\n    conclusion, we note that the approach we adopt here today, including the\r\n    acceptance of the use of an online website to acquire a copy of the breath test\r\n    site video, is in harmony with criminal discovery practice. Â Rule 5 refers to\r\n    &quot;information subject to disclosure&quot; upon request of a defendant.Â \r\n    Rule 5(a)(1), SCRCrimP.Â  In State v. Newell, 303 S.C. 471, 475-76, 401\r\n    S.E.2d 420, 423 (Ct. App. 1991), this court found the prosecution met its duty\r\n    to disclose material discoverable under Rule 5 by making its file available to\r\n    the defense.Â  In Strickler v. Greene, 527 U.S. 263, 276 (1999), defense\r\n    counsel in a capital case did not file a pretrial Brady motion for\r\n    discovery of possible exculpatory evidence because the prosecutor maintained an\r\n    open file, giving counsel access to all evidence in the prosecutor's files.Â \r\n    The United States Supreme Court found it reasonable for counsel to rely on the\r\n    open file policy and the implicit representation that all exculpatory materials\r\n    would be included in the files.Â  Id. at 284; see also Porter\r\n      v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 385, 629 S.E.2d 353, 357 (2006) (citing to Strickler for the proposition that defense counsel may rely on an open file policy in\r\n    satisfaction of the prosecution's duty to disclose material exculpatory\r\n    evidence but noting that institution of an open file policy does not mean\r\n    presumed compliance with Brady); Riddle v. Ozmint, 369 S.C. 39,\r\n    46-47, 631 S.E.2d 70, 74-75 (2006) (reversing the denial of post-conviction\r\n    relief because the solicitor removed documents from the open file offered to\r\n    defense counsel and the documents were material).Â  The Seventh Circuit Court of\r\n    Appeals found an unsupported assertion that the government suppressed evidence\r\n    to be insufficient to support a Brady violation where the government\r\n    maintained an open file policy of discovery.Â  U.S. v. Driver, 798 F.2d\r\n    248, 251 (7th Cir. 1986).Â  We see no real fundamental distinction between the\r\n    use of the online website to provide access to a video and the use of an open\r\n    file policy to provide or produce discovery information.\r\n  Further,\r\n    because the State met any statutory obligation to produce and the datamaster\r\n    ticket in the record indicated the presence of the video online and provided a\r\n    password to the defendant for access, it was incumbent upon the defendant to\r\n    then show the video was not available online or accessible.[4]Â \r\n    While not controlling as to our disposition of the issue, we also find this\r\n    approach consistent with other discovery practice and jurisprudence, which\r\n    places the burden on the party claiming the State did not produce evidence that\r\n    it was required to produce.Â  See Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515,\r\n    524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999) (holding a defendant asserting a Brady claim for violation of due process must demonstrate:Â  (1) the evidence was\r\n    favorable to the defendant; (2) it was in the possession of or known to the\r\n    prosecution; (3) it was suppressed by the prosecution; and (4) it was material\r\n    to guilt or punishment).Â  Here, Branham has failed to demonstrate in the record\r\n    or in the briefs that the video[5] was not accessible to him or available online.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n  Accordingly,\r\n    the order of the circuit court affirming the magistrate's decision to deny\r\n    Branham's motion to dismiss is hereby\r\n  AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  THOMAS and GEATHERS, JJ. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Section 56-5-2953 was amended effective Feb. 10,\r\n  2009.Â  See Act No. 201, 2008 S.C. Acts 1682-85.Â  Thus, the amended\r\n  statute is not applicable to Branham's March 4, 2008 arrest.\r\n[3] Â Suchenski was resolved on preservation\r\n  grounds. Â The case did not address the provision within section 56-5-2953(B)\r\n  stating &quot;[n]othing in this section may be construed as prohibiting the\r\n  introduction of other evidence in the trial. . . .&quot; Â In addition, the supreme\r\n  court had no need to address what impact the presentation of &quot;any other valid\r\n  reason for the failure to produce the videotape&quot; may have on possible\r\n  remedies, such as dismissal or suppression.Â  Id. Â However, based on the\r\n  posture of this case and our disposition herein, we need not address these issues.\r\n[4] Lack of access could include a situation where a\r\n  defendant asserts he does not have a computer or means to access or view the\r\n  video.Â  However, we note most attorneys do have such access.\r\n[5] Counsel did not request that the video be made part\r\n  of the record for appellate purposes.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4804","title":"State v.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4804\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2011 â€“ Filed March\r\n  2, 2011 \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTara Dawn Shurling, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n  Attorney General Deborah R.J. Shupe, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Ernest A.\r\n  &quot;Chip&quot; Finney, III, of Sumter, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J.:Â  This appeal\r\n  arises out of Appellant Ivory Warrenâ€™s guilty pleas to burglary in the first degree\r\n  and attempted armed robbery.Â  After sentencing, Warren filed a timely motion to\r\n  withdraw her pleas.Â  Warren later amended her post trial motion to request\r\n  reconsideration of her sentence, specifically abandoning the motion to withdraw\r\n  her plea.Â  Warren argues the circuit court erred in finding it was without\r\n  authority to consider her untimely motion to reconsider the sentence.Â  We affirm\r\n  the finding that Warren's motion to reconsider her sentence was not timely\r\n  filed.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nWarren\r\n  pled guilty to burglary in the first degree and attempted armed robbery in\r\n  exchange for dismissal of her indictments for murder and possession of a weapon\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Warren also testified in the trial\r\n  of one of her codefendants.Â  The Honorable Paula H. Thomas presided over the\r\n  trial and guilty pleas, and sentenced Warren to 15 years of imprisonment on\r\n  each charge to run concurrently.Â  Seven days after sentencing, Warren filed a\r\n  motion to withdraw her guilty pleas.Â  More than three years later, Warren filed\r\n  a motion to amend her still-pending post trial motion, asking the court to\r\n  reconsider her sentence and specifically abandoning her request to withdraw the\r\n  pleas.Â  At the hearing on the motions, the parties agreed that the Honorable\r\n  Howard P. King had authority to hear the motions because Judge Thomas was\r\n  unavailable due to her election to the South Carolina Court of Appeals.Â  Judge\r\n  King found Warren's request to reconsider her sentence was not timely.Â \r\n  Alternatively, Judge King denied Warren's motion to reconsider her sentence on\r\n  the merits.Â  Judge King never ruled on the motion to withdraw Warren's plea, as\r\n  that motion was abandoned.Â  The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial court\r\n  improperly denied Warren's motion to reconsider her sentence.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court reviews only errors of law and is bound by\r\n  the factual findings of the trial court unless the findings are clearly\r\n  erroneous.Â  State v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2007).Â \r\n  The authority to change a sentence rests solely and exclusively within the\r\n  discretion of the sentencing judge.Â  State v. Smith, 276 S.C. 494, 498,\r\n  280 S.E.2d 200, 202 (1981).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs where the\r\n  conclusions of the trial court are either controlled by an error of law or lack\r\n  evidentiary support.Â  State v. Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 583, 698 S.E.2d\r\n  596, 601 (2010).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWarren\r\n  argues that the trial court retained the power of adjudication over her case,\r\n  despite the expiration of the original term of court, because she filed a\r\n  timely post trial motion.Â  Citing State v. Campbell, 376 S.C. 212, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 371 (2008), Warren argues the trial court retained jurisdiction[2] over the entire case, and not just the timely-filed motion to withdraw her\r\n  plea, such that the court had the authority to reconsider her sentence.Â  The\r\n  State argues Rule 29, SCRCrimP, allows a circuit judge to retain jurisdiction\r\n  over the motion filed within ten days after imposition of the sentence; thus,\r\n  because the amendment asserted a completely different request for relief and abandoned the original request, the State argues the trial court did not have\r\n  the authority to decide Warren's motion to reconsider her sentence.Â  \r\nGenerally,\r\n  a trial judge is without authority to consider a criminal matter once the term\r\n  of court during which judgment was entered expires.Â  Campbell, 376 S.C.\r\n  at 215, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  However, there is an exception for timely post\r\n  trial motions pursuant to Rule 29, SCRCrimP.[3]Â  Id.Â  &quot;Rule 29 further states that the court's jurisdiction to hear\r\n  the motion will not expire with the term of court if the party has filed a\r\n  timely motion.&quot;Â  Id. at 215-16, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  The court does\r\n  not retain authority to entertain a motion which is not made within ten days of\r\n  sentencing.Â  Id. at 216, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  \r\n\r\n\tExcept\r\n  for motions for new trials based on after-discovered evidence, post trial\r\n  motions shall be made within ten (10) days after the imposition of the\r\n  sentence. In cases involving appeals from convictions in magistrate's or\r\n  municipal court, post trial motions shall be made within ten (10) days after\r\n  receipt of written notice of entry of the order or judgment disposing of the\r\n  appeal. The time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed by a timely post\r\n  trial motion and shall run from the receipt of written notice of entry of the\r\n  order granting or denying such motion. The time within which to make the motion\r\n  shall not be affected by the ending of a term of court or departure of the judge\r\n  from the circuit, and the circuit judge shall retain jurisdiction of the action\r\n  for the purpose of hearing and disposing of the motion if not heard and\r\n  disposed of during the term. Except by consent of the parties, argument on the\r\n  motion shall be heard in the circuit where the trial or hearing was held. The\r\n  motion may, in the discretion of the court, be determined on briefs filed by\r\n  the parties without oral argument.\r\n\r\nRule 29(a), SCRCrimP.\r\nWarren\r\n  made a timely post trial motion to withdraw her guilty plea.Â  More than three\r\n  years later, Warren filed a motion to amend the previous motion, containing the\r\n  following language:Â  &quot;[Warren] now asks that the post trial motion be\r\n  amended to reflect her prayer for reconsideration of her sentence and she abandons\r\n  her request to be allowed to withdraw her pleas.&quot;Â  Warren utilizes Campbell to assert that the timely-filed motion to withdraw the plea allows a trial\r\n  court to retain authority over the entire case.Â  Thus, Warren argues the trial\r\n  court erred in finding it only retained authority to decide the issue presented\r\n  in the timely-filed motion to withdraw the plea.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  disagree with Warren's interpretation of Campbell.Â  The trial court\r\n  retained authority to decide the timely-filed post trial motion pursuant to\r\n  Rule 29.Â  However, the rule itself focuses on the court's retention of\r\n  authority to act &quot;for the purpose of hearing and disposing of the\r\n    motion.&quot;Â  See Rule 29(a) (emphasis added).Â  When Warren amended\r\n  the motion to add a reconsideration of sentence request, while simultaneously\r\n  abandoning the motion to withdraw her plea, the court lost its authority to act\r\n  on the motion because the amendment was not timely.Â  Although Warren\r\n  alternatively argues that the amendment to the timely-filed motion was\r\n  appropriate because she first added the request to reconsider her sentence to\r\n  the motion and then abandoned the motion to withdraw her plea, we\r\n  disagree with this assessment.Â  We find Warren's motion to reconsider her\r\n  sentence, like the motion to withdraw a guilty plea, is subject to the ten day\r\n  time period prescribed in Rule 29; thus, because the motion was filed more than\r\n  three years after imposition of the sentence, Warren's motion is not timely.[4]Â \r\n  Because we find the request for reconsideration of Warren's sentence is untimely,\r\n  we need not reach Judge King's alternative ruling on the merits denying the\r\n  motion.Â  See City of Greenville v. Bane, 390 S.C. 303, 309, 702\r\n  S.E.2d 112, 115 (2010) (noting an appellate court need not address all issues\r\n  where disposition of one issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Although Rule 29 and subsequent case law use the term\r\n  &quot;jurisdiction&quot; to refer to the court's power or authority to act, we\r\n  recognize that this issue is not one of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  As stated\r\n  by the Campbell court, &quot;When we used the 'lack of jurisdiction'\r\n  language, we meant that the trial court simply no longer has the power to act\r\n  in a particular manner because the term of court has ended.&quot;Â  376 S.C. at\r\n  216, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  Thus, where the term &quot;jurisdiction&quot; is used,\r\n  we refer only to the court's power to act on Warren's motions.Â  The circuit\r\n  court retained subject matter jurisdiction over this criminal matter at all\r\n  times throughout the case.\r\n[3] The other exception to the rule that a trial judge\r\n  may not consider a criminal matter after expiration of the term of court is a\r\n  motion for a new trial based on after-discovered evidence.Â  Campbell,\r\n  376 S.C. at 215, 656 S.E.2d at 373.Â  However, this exception is not before the\r\n  court.\r\n[4] Our holding is analogous to jurisprudence concerning\r\n  Rule 33 of the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, which provides the\r\n  procedure for filing a motion for a new trial.Â  &quot;Any motion for a new\r\n  trial grounded on any reason other than newly discovered evidence must be filed\r\n  within 14 days after the verdict or finding of guilty.&quot;Â  Fed. R. Crim. P.\r\n  33(b)(2).Â  The United States Supreme Court classified this federal rule as a\r\n  &quot;claim-processing rule,&quot; rather than a jurisdictional issue, in\r\n  addressing the effect of untimely arguments in support of a motion for a new\r\n  trial where the district court was still considering post trial motions and the\r\n  matter had not yet been appealed.Â  Eberhart v. U.S., 546 U.S. 12, 17\r\n  (2005).Â  Although the Supreme Court ultimately found that the government waived\r\n  its right to raise a defense of untimeliness by failing to raise it before the\r\n  district court ruled on the merits, the Court noted the policy of the Federal\r\n  Rules is not to extend the power to act indefinitely but to confine it within\r\n  constant time periods.Â  Id. at 17-18.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4806","title":"Kase v.

Bradley, of Greenville, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: In\r\n  this personal injury action, James Kase appeals the grant of summary judgment\r\n  to DMX Transportation, Inc. (DMX).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  May 9, 2006, Kase was sitting in his parked truck at the Pilot Truck Stop near\r\n  Duncan, South Carolina.[2]Â \r\n  He felt another vehicle bump into the rear of his vehicle and exited his truck\r\n  to investigate.Â  Although Kase was not injured from the collision and the\r\n  damage to his truck was minimal, a physical altercation ensued between Kase and\r\n  Michael Ebert, the driver of the other vehicle, after both had exited their\r\n  respective vehicles.Â  Ebert fled the scene, but was later arrested.Â  Kase was\r\n  injured during the fight.Â  The injuries caused him to miss several months of\r\n  work and eventually lose his job. \r\nEbert\r\n  was employed as a driver for DMX, and the vehicle that collided with Kase's\r\n  truck belonged to DMX.Â  DMX hired Ebert in 2004 even though he accidentally\r\n  damaged some equipment during his road test and allegedly disclosed that he had\r\n  been convicted of assault twenty-two years ago while working as a driver in\r\n  Arizona.Â  The assault conviction arose from a fight between Ebert and a\r\n  security guard who attempted to ticket him for parking in the wrong place while\r\n  making a delivery. Â Ebert's employment at DMX continued despite numerous\r\n  professional and personal difficulties, including (1) suspension of his\r\n  commercial driver's license because of too many serious traffic violations\r\n  within a short time, (2) a written reprimand from DMX concerning numerous\r\n  accidents and complaints from customers and supervisors about his performance,\r\n  (3) a second reprimand from DMX admonishing Ebert for hostile disrespect of his\r\n  supervisors, (4) marital difficulties that were further compounded by DMX's withholding\r\n  of his wages to pay child support, (5) a recent citation in Wisconsin for\r\n  speeding and inattentive driving, and (6) a bizarre written complaint that he\r\n  wrote against the officer who ticketed him in Wisconsin.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Ebert pled guilty to assaulting Kase, he continued to work for DMX for several\r\n  months.Â  DMX eventually dismissed Ebert for insubordination and because its\r\n  insurance carrier refused to cover him because of too many speeding tickets. \r\nIn\r\n  September 2007, Kase filed this action against Ebert and DMX, alleging causes\r\n  of action for assault and battery against Ebert, as well as negligence and\r\n  gross negligence claims against both defendants.Â  Kase also sued DMX on claims\r\n  of negligent entrustment, negligent hiring, training, supervision, and/or\r\n  retention, and respondeat superior.Â  In October 2008, DMX moved for summary\r\n  judgment.\r\nAfter\r\n  a hearing on the motion in February 2009, the trial judge granted the motion,\r\n  holding (1) Ebert was acting outside the course and scope of his employment\r\n  when he assaulted Kase; therefore, DMX was not vicariously liable for his\r\n  actions; and (2) Kase could not satisfy the necessary elements to proceed on\r\n  his claims for negligent hiring, negligent retention, negligent supervision, or\r\n  negligent entrustment.Â  Kase then filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\nI. Did the trial judge\r\n  err in holding that DMX, as a matter of law, could not be held vicariously\r\n  liable for Ebert's assault on Kase?\r\nII. Did the trial judge\r\n  err in granting summary judgment to DMX on Kase's causes of action for\r\n  negligent hiring, negligent supervision, and negligent retention?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;Summary\r\n  judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact, and\r\n  it is clear that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Bank v. N.Y. v. Sumter County, 387 S.C. 147, 154-55, 691 S.E.2d 473, 477\r\n  (2010). Â &quot;On review of an order granting summary judgment, the appellate\r\n  court applies the same standard as that used by the trial court.&quot;Â  Id. at 155, 691 S.E.2d at 477.Â  &quot;[I]n cases applying the preponderance of\r\n  evidence burden of proof, the non-moving party is only required to submit a\r\n  mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary\r\n  judgment.&quot;Â  Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009).Â  To survive a summary judgment motion by the defendant\r\n  in a lawsuit, however, the plaintiff must offer some evidence that a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists for each element of the claim at issue except for\r\n  those elements that are either uncontested or agreed to by stipulation.Â  Eadie\r\n  v. Krause, 381 S.C. 55, 65, n.5, 671 S.E.2d 389, 393 n.5 (Ct. App. 2008), cert.\r\n  denied (June 10, 2010) (citing Baughman v. Am. Tel. &amp; Tel. Co.,\r\n  306 S.C. 101, 116, 410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991)).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Respondeat superior claims\r\nKase contends the trial judge, in finding DMX could\r\n  not be held vicariously liable for Ebert's actions, incorrectly ignored\r\n  evidence that DMX endorsed or even encouraged its drivers to use violence to\r\n  protect its property.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;If the servant is doing some act in furtherance\r\n  of the master's business, he will be regarded as acting within the scope of his\r\n  employment, although he may exceed his authority.&quot;Â  Jones v. Elbert,\r\n  211 S.C. 553, 558, 34 S.E.2d 796, 798-99 (1945).Â  &quot;On the other hand, if\r\n  the servant acts for some independent purpose of his own, wholly disconnected\r\n  with the furtherance of his master's business, his conduct falls outside the\r\n  scope of his employment.&quot;Â  Crittenden v. Thompson-Walker Co., 288\r\n  S.C. 112, 116, 341 S.E.2d 385, 387 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  &quot;If a servant steps aside from the master's business for\r\n  some purpose wholly disconnected with his employment, the relation of master\r\n  and servant is temporarily suspended; and this is so no matter how short the\r\n  time, and the master is not liable for his acts during such time.&quot;Â  Lane\r\n  v. Modern Music, Inc., 244 S.C. 299, 305, 136 S.E.2d 713, 716 (1964) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThe evidence cited by Kase consisted of\r\n  deposition testimony from Ebert that he had discussed with his superiors at DMX\r\n  that forceful action was necessary at times to protect DMX property.Â  It is\r\n  undisputed that the altercation at issue here did not arise because Ebert was protecting\r\n  either a company vehicle or the cargo he was transporting.Â  Rather, Ebert had\r\n  already exited the vehicle and was defending himself against what he perceived\r\n  to be a violent attack by Kase. Â We therefore agree with the trial judge's\r\n  findings that Ebert was acting outside the course and scope of his employment\r\n  with DMX when he assaulted Kase.Â  It follows that DMX cannot be held\r\n  vicariously liable for Ebert's actions.Â  See Armstrong v. Food Lion,\r\n  371 S.C. 271, 276, 639 S.E.2d 50, 53 (2006) (holding that because\r\n  &quot;petitioners failed to produce any evidence that the Food Lion employees\r\n  were acting within the scope of their employment or in furtherance of Food\r\n  Lion's business when they attacked petitioners,&quot; Food Lion could not be\r\n  held liable to the plaintiffs on those claims based on the theory of respondeat\r\n  superior).\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligence claims\r\nKase further argues the trial judge, in granting\r\n  summary judgment to DMX on his claims for negligent hiring, negligence, and\r\n  negligent supervision, incorrectly disregarded (1) evidence that DMX had actual\r\n  knowledge of Ebert's potential for violence and (2) his expert's opinion that\r\n  the sum of Ebert's problems placed DMX on notice of this propensity.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nA. Negligent hiring\r\nRegarding his claim of negligent hiring, Kase argues\r\n  Ebert's prior assault conviction was sufficient evidence to withstand DMX's\r\n  summary judgment motion.Â  Quoting this court's opinion in Doe v. ATC,\r\n  367 S.C. 199, 207, 624 S.E.2d 447, 451 (Ct. App. 2005), he contends that\r\n  because of the factual similarities between the events leading to the\r\n  conviction and those giving rise to the present litigation, &quot;the prior\r\n  misconduct has a sufficient nexus to the ultimate harm.&quot;Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;In circumstances where an employer knew of or should\r\n  have known that its employment of a specific person created an undue risk of\r\n  harm to the public, a plaintiff may claim that the employer was itself\r\n  negligent in hiring . . . . the employee . . . .&quot;Â  James v. Kelly\r\n  Trucking Co., 377 S.C. 628, 631, 661 S.E.2d 329, 330 (2008).Â  Negligent\r\n  hiring cases &quot;generally turn on two fundamental elementsâ€”knowledge of the\r\n  employer and foreseeability of harm to third parties.&quot;Â  Doe, 367\r\n  S.C. at 206, 624 S.E.2d at 450 (citing Di Cosala v. Kay, 450 A.2d 508,\r\n  516 (N.J. 1982)).Â  Although foreseeability is usually an issue of fact,\r\n  &quot;the court should dispose of the matter on a dispositive motion when no\r\n  reasonable factfinder could find the risk foreseeable or the employer's conduct\r\n  to have fallen below the acceptable standard.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nWe agree with the trial judge that Kase presented no\r\n  evidence that Ebert's single assault conviction, which took place more than\r\n  twenty years before he was hired by DMX, was reason for DMX to foresee that employing\r\n  Ebert would create an undue risk of harm to the public or that DMX's decision\r\n  to hire him in view of this conviction fell below any acceptable hiring standard.Â \r\n  Although Kase's expert testified that Ebert had a poor driving record when DMX\r\n  hired him and indicated an employer may be justified in refusing to hire\r\n  someone with a single simple assault conviction, he also conceded that this\r\n  conviction alone would not have been sufficient to place DMX on notice that\r\n  Ebert would become involved in a physical altercation with a third party.Â  Kase\r\n  has not directed our attention to any other evidence that DMX knew or should have\r\n  known when it hired Ebert that he had a propensity toward violent behavior;\r\n  therefore, we affirm the grant of summary judgment on Kase's negligent hiring\r\n  claim.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Negligent supervision and\r\n  retention\r\nKase also mentioned additional circumstances that, he\r\n  contends, showed DMX was on notice of Ebert's potential for violence.Â  These\r\n  include (1) Ebert's poor driving record, which included numerous moving\r\n  violations; (2) Ebert's insubordinate behavior; (3) Ebert's marital\r\n  difficulties and resulting financial problems; and (4) the incident in\r\n  Wisconsin and Ebert's erratic behavior afterwards.Â  It appears that because\r\n  these circumstances arose during Ebert's employment with DMX, Kase has cited\r\n  them to support his claims for negligent supervision and negligent retention.Â \r\n  We hold, however, that Kase, as a matter of law, cannot proceed on these causes\r\n  of action.\r\nIn Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C.\r\n  114, 116-17, 420 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1992), the South Carolina Supreme Court quoted\r\n  with approval section 317 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts (1965). Â This\r\n  section provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  A master is under a duty to exercise\r\n    reasonable care so to control his servant while acting outside the scope of his\r\n    employment as to prevent him from intentionally harming others or from so\r\n    conducting himself as to create an unreasonable risk of bodily harm to them, if\r\n  (a) the servant\r\n    (i) is upon the premises in possession of\r\n    the master or upon which the servant is privileged to enter only as his\r\n    servant, or\r\n    (ii) is using a chattel of the master, and\r\n     (b) the master\r\n    (i) knows or has reason to know that he\r\n    has the ability to control his servant, and\r\n    (ii) knows or should know of the necessity\r\n    and opportunity for exercising such control.\r\n\r\n(emphases\r\n  added).Â  Here, it was undisputed that the fight between Kase and Ebert did not\r\n  take place on DMX property.Â  Furthermore, Ebert had already exited the company\r\n  vehicle before the altercation started.Â  Although the fight between Kase and\r\n  Ebert immediately followed the collision between the vehicles they were driving,\r\n  it did not involve Ebert's use of a DMX chattel.Â  See id. cmt. b (&quot;So\r\n  too, [a master] is required to exercise his authority as a master to prevent\r\n  [his servants] from misusing chattels which he entrusts to them for use\r\n  as his servants.&quot;) (emphasis added).Â  We therefore agree with the trial\r\n  judge that DMX, as a matter of law, cannot be liable for either negligent\r\n  supervision or negligent retention.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to DMX on Kase's\r\n  vicarious liability claim and his negligence causes of action.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPIEPER and GEATHERS, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2]Â  In his brief, Kase states he was employed as a\r\n  tractor-trailer driver and was driving a tractor-trailer when the incident with\r\n  Ebert occurred. The record, however, indicates that Kase was driving a truck\r\n  and Ebert was driving a tractor-trailer at that time.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4807","title":"Murphy v.

Shaughnessy and Michael B.\r\n          Eller, of Greenville, for Appellants. \r\n        Bryan D. Ramey, of Piedmont; and John S.\r\n          Nichols, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSHORT, J.: Owens\r\n  Corning, Employer, and Gallagher Bassett Services, Carrier (collectively, Appellants),\r\n  appeal the Workers' Compensation Commission's order finding Lisa Murphy\r\n  sustained compensable injuries arising from repetitive trauma to her back,\r\n  shoulders, hands, and arms.Â  We affirm as modified.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nMurphy is employed as a sliver handler at Owens\r\n  Corning.Â  Her job requires her to reach for hot glass pieces above her head and\r\n  pull them down into strands.Â  Murphy then looks up to inspect for leftover\r\n  beads that could plug the bushings, and winds the strands onto a chopper. Â She\r\n  testified she is taller than most of the other sliver handlers, and her height\r\n  requires her to stay bent over and look up while she pulls down approximately\r\n  four thousand glass pieces during her eight-hour shift.Â  Murphy's work shifts\r\n  alternated, sometimes requiring her to work seven days in a row.Â  At the time\r\n  of the hearing before the single commissioner in 2008, Murphy had been employed\r\n  by Owens Corning for nineteen years, approximately five as a sliver handler at\r\n  least part time, and six as a full-time sliver handler. \r\nBetween 2003 and 2005, Murphy began experiencing pain\r\n  in her neck, severe headaches, and tingling in her fingers.Â  She was treated by\r\n  Dr. Stephen F. Worsham.Â  In notes dated May 3, 2004, Worsham wrote:\r\n  &quot;[Murphy] states that the work rigors are too much for her to\r\n  handle.&quot;Â  On June 2, 2004, Worsham concluded: &quot;[Murphy] may think\r\n  about seeking for (sic) another type of employment if this is going to be a\r\n  continued difficulty.&quot;Â  In August 2007, Worsham recommended Murphy stay\r\n  out of work for four weeks, and referred her to Dr. Aaron C. MacDonald of the\r\n  Piedmont Neurosurgical Group, P.A. \r\nMacDonald saw Murphy on August 29, 2007, and reported\r\n  an &quot;MRI of the cervical spine show[ed] cervical spondylosis and disc\r\n  bulging at C5-6 and C6-7 causing possible neural impingement.&quot;[2]Â \r\n  MacDonald concluded Murphy's two bulging disks probably came from the &quot;disks\r\n  irritating the nerve roots from the chronic extension that [Murphy] was in.&quot;Â \r\n  MacDonald opined to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Murphy's work\r\n  made her symptoms worse.Â  When asked regarding a direct causal relationship\r\n  between Murphy's job and the exacerbation of her symptoms, MacDonald stated:\r\n  &quot;[H]er symptoms were made worse by the position that she was in to do her\r\n  job.&quot; \r\nMurphy testified she felt better when she was on leave\r\n  in 2007, and she did not realize her symptoms were related to her job until her\r\n  visit to Worsham on September 7, 2007, after she saw MacDonald.Â  Worsham's\r\n  notes state: &quot;[Murphy] has been seen by Dr. M[a]cDonald, who feels it is\r\n  not surgical, although it is causing her some difficulty and continues to cause\r\n  her difficulty with the type of repetitious over-the-head work that she\r\n  does.&quot;Â  Murphy reported her injuries to Owens Corning that day.Â  Murphy\r\n  returned to work, and remained working as of the date of the hearing before the\r\n  commissioner.Â  She did not seek temporary total disability, but sought medical\r\n  care under the Workers' Compensation Act.Â  Murphy did not recall Worsham\r\n  recommending she find alternate employment in 2004.Â  \r\nAppellants submitted the findings of its medical\r\n  expert, Dr. Glenn L. Scott.Â  Scott reported he reviewed Murphy's medical\r\n  records and inspected other employees performing the sliver handler's job at\r\n  the work site.Â  He concluded her &quot;cervical spondylosis was not caused by\r\n  her work, nor has her work caused any permanent damage, nor has it accelerated\r\n  the condition itself.&quot;Â  Scott did not examine Murphy or view her at the\r\n  job site.Â  \r\nThe single commissioner found &quot;the preponderance\r\n  of the evidence is that there is a direct causal connection between the\r\n  repetitive activities of [Murphy's] job and the aggravation of her . . .\r\n  condition.Â  This finding is based on the medical records . . . .&quot;Â  The\r\n  commissioner found: (1) Murphy sustained an injury by accident arising out of\r\n  and in the course of her employment under section 42-1-160; and (2) Murphy\r\n  first knew her condition was work-related on September 7, 2007, and she gave\r\n  timely and proper notice.Â  \r\nThe Commission held a hearing, sustained the\r\n  commissioner's order in its entirety, and found: (1) Murphy suffered an\r\n  aggravation of her underlying condition by the repetitive trauma of performing\r\n  overhead work on her job; (2) the finding was based on the record as a whole,\r\n  including the medical record; (3) by the preponderance of the evidence there\r\n  was a direct causal connection between the repetitive activities of Murphy's\r\n  job and the aggravation of her condition; (4) Murphy sustained an injury by\r\n  accident under section 42-1-160; (5) Murphy first knew her condition was\r\n  work-related on September 7, 2007; and (6) Murphy gave timely and proper\r\n  notice.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act establishes the substantial\r\n  evidence standard for judicial review of decisions by the\r\n  Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2010); Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 134-35, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981). Â Under the substantial\r\n  evidence standard of review, this court may not substitute its judgment for\r\n  that of the Commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact,\r\n  but may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law. Â Stone v.\r\n    Traylor Bros., Inc., 360 S.C. 271, 274, 600 S.E.2d 551, 552 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n&quot;Statutory interpretation is a question of\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr., 373 S.C. 475, 479, 646 S.E.2d\r\n  162, 165 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  This court is free to decide matters of law with no\r\n  particular deference to the fact finder.Â  Pressley v. REA Constr. Co.,\r\n  374 S.C. 283, 287-88, 648 S.E.2d 301, 303 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  &quot;But whether\r\n  the facts of a case were correctly applied to a statute is a question of fact,\r\n  subject to the substantial evidence standard.&quot;Â  Hopper, 373 S.C. at\r\n  479-80, 646 S.E.2d at 165.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Notice of\r\n  Injury and Statute of Limitations\r\nAppellants argue the Commission erred in\r\n  finding Murphy gave proper and timely notice of her injury.Â  Appellants also\r\n  argue Murphy failed to file her claim within the time required under the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  We find no reversible error. \r\nSection 42-15-20(C) of the South Carolina\r\n  Code requires an employee alleging a repetitive trauma injury to give notice\r\n  &quot;within ninety days of the date the employee discovered, or could have\r\n  discovered by exercising reasonable diligence, that his condition is\r\n  compensable . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-20(C) (Supp. 2010).Â  Section 42-15-40 bars a claim alleging a repetitive\r\n  trauma injury unless the claim is filed &quot;within two years after the\r\n  employee knew or should have known that his injury is compensable . . .\r\n  .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2010).Â  The\r\n  statutory notice requirements under sections 42-15-20 and 42-15-40 should be\r\n  liberally construed in favor of claimants.Â  Etheredge v. Monsanto Co.,\r\n  349 S.C. 451, 458, 562 S.E.2d 679, 683 (Ct. App. 2002); Rogers v.\r\n    Spartanburg Reg'l Med. Ctr., 328 S.C. 415, 418, 491 S.E.2d 708, 710 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1997).\r\nThe Commission's findings of fact\r\n  regarding notice and the statute of limitations are reviewed under the\r\n  substantial evidence standard of review.Â  See McCraw v. Mary Black\r\n    Hosp., 350 S.C. 229, 235, 565 S.E.2d 286, 289 (2002) (applying the\r\n  substantial evidence rule in action appealing the Commission's findings of fact\r\n  regarding whether claimant timely filed a claim under the statute of\r\n  limitations);Â  Watt v. Piedmont Auto., 384 S.C. 203, 212, 681 S.E.2d\r\n  615, 620 (Ct. App. 2009) (deferring to the Commission on the issue of notice\r\n  and finding the Commission determines the credibility of witnesses); Etheredge,\r\n  349 S.C. at 456, 562 S.E.2d at 682 (applying substantial evidence standard of\r\n  review to Commission's finding of timely notice within ninety days as required\r\n  by statute).\r\nMurphy testified she did not realize her symptoms were related to her job\r\n  until September 7, 2007, and immediately reported to Owens Corning.Â  Although\r\n  there is some evidence supporting Appellants' argument that the medical records\r\n  indicate Murphy should have known of her injuries in 2004, the Commission is\r\n  the fact-finder, and found she &quot;first knew her condition was work related\r\n  on September 7, 2007.Â  This is based on [Murphy's] testimony, the medical\r\n  reports with special emphasis on Dr. Worsham's note of September 7, 2007[,] . .\r\n  . and the record as a whole.&quot;Â  We find substantial evidence in the record that\r\n  Murphy provided timely and proper notice and is not barred by the statute of\r\n  limitations.\r\nII.&nbsp; Compensability of Repetitive Trauma Injuries\r\nAppellants argue that because Murphy's\r\n  alleged injuries arise from repetitive trauma, the Commission erred in finding\r\n  Murphy suffered an injury by accident arising out of and in the course of her\r\n  employment under South Carolina Code section 42-1-160.Â  Appellants concede that\r\n  repetitive trauma injuries were compensable under section 42-1-160 prior to\r\n  July 1, 2007.Â  Appellants argue, however, the enactment of section 42-1-172 in\r\n  2007 defines and sets forth new requirements for repetitive trauma injuries.Â  According\r\n  to Appellants, the Commission thus erred in finding Murphy's injuries compensable\r\n  under section 42-1-160.Â  We agree but affirm as modified. \r\nSection 42-1-160 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (A) &quot;Injury&quot;\r\n    and &quot;personal injury&quot; mean only injury by accident arising out of and\r\n    in the course of employment . . . . \r\n  . . . .\r\n  (F) The word &quot;accident&quot; as used in this title must not\r\n    be construed to mean a series of events in employment, of a similar or like\r\n    nature, occurring regularly, continuously, or at frequent intervals in the\r\n    course of such employment, over extended periods of time. Any injury or\r\n      disease attributable to such causes must be compensable only if culminating in\r\n      a compensable repetitive trauma injury pursuant to Section 42-1-172 . . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2010) (emphasis\r\n    added).Â  Section 42-1-172 provides:\r\n\r\n  (A)\r\n    &quot;Repetitive trauma injury&quot; means an injury which is gradual in onset\r\n    and caused by the cumulative effects of repetitive traumatic events. Compensability\r\n      of a repetitive trauma injury must be determined only under the provisions of\r\n      this statute.\r\n  (B)\r\n    An injury is not considered a compensable repetitive\r\n    trauma injury unless a commissioner makes a specific finding of fact by a\r\n    preponderance of the evidence of a causal connection that is established by\r\n    medical evidence between the repetitive activities that occurred while the\r\n    employee was engaged in the regular duties of his employment and the injury.\r\n  (C)\r\n    As used in this section, &quot;medical evidence&quot; means expert opinion or\r\n    testimony stated to a reasonable degree of medical certainty, documents,\r\n    records, or other material that is offered by a licensed and qualified medical\r\n    physician.\r\n  (D)\r\n    A &quot;repetitive trauma injury&quot; is considered to arise out of employment\r\n    only if it is established by medical evidence that there is a direct causal\r\n    relationship between the condition under which the work is performed and the\r\n    injury.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-172 (Supp. 2010) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nWe agree that the compensability of a repetitive\r\n  trauma injury must be determined by the Commission under the provisions of\r\n  section 42-1-172.Â  We find the Commission thus erred by failing to address\r\n  section 42-1-172.Â  Despite the Commission's error, we affirm as modified because\r\n  although it cited section 42-1-160, the Commission made the findings required\r\n  under section 42-1-172.Â  See Dykes v. Daniel Constr. Co., 262 S.C. 98, 109, 202\r\n  S.E.2d 646, 652 (1974) (concluding that although the Commission failed to make\r\n  the specific finding in the statutory language, its substantial compliance\r\n  implied such a finding, enabling the court to properly review whether there was\r\n  evidence to sustain the award).Â  Compensability under section 42-1-172 requires\r\n  a specific finding of fact, by the preponderance of the evidence, of a direct\r\n  causal relationship, established by medical evidence, between the repetitive\r\n  act and the employment.Â  The single\r\n  commissioner found in part that &quot;the preponderance of the evidence is that\r\n  there is a direct causal connection between the repetitive activities of\r\n  [Murphy's] job and the aggravation of her . . . condition.Â  This finding is\r\n  based on the medical records . . . .&quot;Â  The Commission sustained the\r\n  commissioner's order in its entirety, and found in part: (1) Murphy suffered an\r\n  aggravation of her underlying condition by the repetitive trauma of performing\r\n  overhead work on her job; (2) the finding was based on the record as a whole,\r\n  including the medical record; and (3) there was a direct causal connection between\r\n  the repetitive activities of Murphy's job and the aggravation of her condition.Â \r\n  We find the Commission made the findings necessary under section 42-1-172 and,\r\n  accordingly, affirm as modified.Â  See Callahan v. Beaufort Cnty. Sch.\r\n    Dist., 375 S.C. 92, 97, 651 S.E.2d 311, 314 (2007) (affirming as modified\r\n  in a workers' compensation action despite a claimant's failure to strictly\r\n  comply with the statute).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Aggravation of Pre-Existing\r\n  Condition\r\nAppellants next argue the Commission's\r\n  findings of fact regarding aggravation of a pre-existing condition do not\r\n  satisfy the requirements for compensability under section 42-9-35 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code because Murphy did not prove a subsequent injury or a subsequent\r\n  disability.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 42-9-35 applies to the aggravation\r\n  of a pre-existing condition and provides\r\n  in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  (A) The employee\r\n    shall establish by a preponderance of the evidence, including medical evidence,\r\n    that:\r\n  (1) the subsequent injury aggravated the preexisting\r\n    condition or permanent physical impairment; or \r\n  (2) the preexisting condition or the permanent physical impairment\r\n    aggravates the subsequent injury. \r\n  (B) The commission\r\n    may award compensation benefits to an employee who has a permanent physical\r\n    impairment or preexisting condition and who incurs a subsequent disability from an injury arising out of and in the course of his employment for the\r\n    resulting disability of the permanent physical impairment or preexisting\r\n    condition and the subsequent injury.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-35 (Supp. 2010)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe claimant's right to compensation for\r\n  aggravation of a pre-existing condition arises when the claimant has a dormant\r\n  condition that becomes disabling because of the aggravating injury.Â  Anderson\r\n    v. Baptist Med. Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 493, 541 S.E.2d 526, 528 (2001).Â  We\r\n  review the Commission's factual findings of whether a claimant is entitled to\r\n  compensation for aggravation of a pre-existing condition under the substantial\r\n  evidence standard of review.Â  Brown v. R.L. Jordan Oil Co., 291 S.C.\r\n  272, 274-75, 353 S.E.2d 280, 282 (1987).\r\nThe Commission found Murphy:\r\n\r\n  suffered an\r\n    aggravation of her underlying neck condition by the repetitive trauma of\r\n    performing overhead work on her job.Â  The aggravation has manifested itself in neck\r\n    pain, headaches, shoulder pain, arm pain and hand pain.Â  This finding is based\r\n    on the record as a whole, including the medical record and deposition testimony\r\n    of Dr. M[a]cDonald that the job aggravated [Murphy's] condition. . . . The\r\n    preponderance of the evidence is that there is a direct causal connection\r\n    between the repetitive activities of [Murphy's] job and the aggravation of her\r\n    underlying neck condition.Â  This finding is based on the medical reports . . .\r\n    and on Dr. M[a]cDonald's deposition . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nWe find that although the Commission did\r\n  not refer to section 42-9-35 in its order, it made the necessary findings under\r\n  the statute.Â  Accordingly, we affirm as modified.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing analysis, the order on appeal is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nHUFF and PIEPER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Murphy stipulated she had cervical spondylosis\r\n  &quot;probably from birth.&quot;\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4805","title":"Limehouse v.

Cisa, of Mt. Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: This is an appeal from an entry of default and the subsequent default damages trial based on a slander action against Paul Hulsey and the\r\nHulsey Litigation Group, LLC (collectively Hulsey).&nbsp; Damages (actual and punitive) were found in excess of $7.3 million.&nbsp; Hulsey now appeals, alleging\r\nthe trial court erred in (1) granting entry of default without subject matter jurisdiction, (2) failing to grant a motion to set aside the entry of default, (3)\r\nallegedly depriving Hulsey of due process in the default damages trial, and (4) allowing an award of $5 million in punitive damages.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 2004, Hulsey filed a class action suit against Lawton Limehouse, Limehouse's son, and L&amp;L Services, Inc., a staffing agency owned by the pair.&nbsp;\r\nThe suit alleged violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), as well as other state and federal laws.&nbsp; Although the case\r\neventually settled, during its pendency, Hulsey made allegedly slanderous statements that the &quot;[Charleston] Post &amp; Courier&quot; published, including\r\n(1) Limehouse engaged in a classic racketeering scheme, (2) Limehouse's conduct set the community back 150 years, (3) Limehouse engaged in blatant indentured\r\nservitude, and (4) Limehouse created a perfect racketeering scheme just like Tony Soprano.[1]&nbsp;\r\nIn response, Limehouse filed suit against Hulsey on April 19, 2006.&nbsp; Service was perfected upon the Hulsey Litigation Group, LLC on April 20, 2006, and\r\nPaul Hulsey personally on April 21, 2006.&nbsp; On May 5, 2006, Hulsey filed a notice of removal to federal district court without filing an answer to the\r\ncomplaint.&nbsp; On June 2, 2006, Limehouse filed a motion to remand to state court.&nbsp; A federal district judge remanded the case to state court by an order\r\ndated July 19, 2006, for lack of federal subject matter jurisdiction.[2]&nbsp; The federal court electronically\r\ntransmitted this order to counsel on July 20.&nbsp; The Charleston County Clerk of Court also received an uncertified copy and filed the order on July 21.&nbsp;\r\nThe Charleston County Clerk of Court mailed notice of the filing to all parties on July 27.&nbsp;\r\nOn August 21, 2006, Limehouse filed a request for entry of default.&nbsp; The Charleston County Clerk of Court entered default on August 21, and filed the\r\nsame on August 22.&nbsp; Subsequently, the clerk mailed a Form 4 to all parties on August 24, 2006, noticing entry of default.&nbsp; On August 29, upon receipt\r\nof the Form 4, Hulsey filed an answer and motion to set aside entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn December, 2006, a circuit judge denied Hulsey's motion to set aside entry of default, and in February 2008, a different circuit judge presided over a jury\r\ntrial on the issue of damages.&nbsp; On February 6, 2008, the jury returned a verdict for actual damages in the amount of $2.39 million and awarded punitive\r\ndamages in the amount of $5 million.&nbsp; Nine days later, on February 15, 2008, Hulsey filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\r\nafter discovering there was no certified copy of the remand order on file with the Charleston County Clerk of Court.&nbsp; The trial court denied the motion, as\r\nwell as the accompanying motion for a new trial.&nbsp; This appeal follows.&nbsp;\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in exercising jurisdiction over the case after remand?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the trial court err in failing to set aside the entry of default?\r\n  III.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in the manner in which the default damages trial was conducted?\r\n  IV.&nbsp; Did the trial court err in allowing an award of punitive damages?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nHulsey argues the trial court was, and still is, without jurisdiction over this matter because the clerk of the federal court failed to mail a certified copy\r\nof the remand order to the Charleston County Clerk of Court.&nbsp; We disagree and find the mailing of the certified copy is not a jurisdictional requirement.\r\nUpon removal, the federal court acquires jurisdiction over the case, for the limited purpose of determining jurisdiction.&nbsp; See Davis v. Davis,\r\n267 S.C. 508, 511, 229 S.E.2d 847, 848 (1976).&nbsp; Once the federal court determines that federal jurisdiction is not appropriate, the case is remanded to\r\nstate court, and the remand ends the federal court's jurisdiction.&nbsp; 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1446(d) (1996).\r\nCongress has provided for a federal court's jurisdiction in section 1446(d): &quot;Promptly after the filing of such notice of removal . . . the defendant .\r\n. . shall give written notice thereof to . . .&nbsp; the clerk of such State court, which shall effect the removal and the State court shall proceed no\r\nfurther unless and until the case is remanded.&quot; (emphasis added).\r\nIn addition, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1447(c) (1996) provides for &quot;Procedure[s] after removal generally,&quot; and states:\r\n\r\n  A motion to remand the case on the basis of any defect other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction must be made within 30 days after the filing of the\r\n  notice of removal under section 1446(a). If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks subject matter jurisdiction, the case\r\n  shall be remanded. An order remanding the case may require payment of just costs and any actual expenses, including attorney fees, incurred as a result of the\r\n  removal. A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court. The State court may thereupon proceed with such\r\n  case.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nIn interpreting section 1447(c), a majority of federal circuits take the position that the finality of the remand and the accompanying loss of federal\r\njurisdiction requires both entry of the order with the federal clerk of court and a certified copy being mailed to the state court.&nbsp; See, e.g.,\r\nTrans Penn Wax Corp. v. McCandless, 50 F.3d 217, 227 (3rd Cir. 1995); Hunt v. Acromed Corp., 961 F.2d 1079, 1081-82 (3rd Cir. 1992); Browning\r\nv. Navarro, 743 F.2d 1069, 1078-79 (5th Cir. 1984); Fed. Deposit Ins. Corp. v. Santiago Plaza, 598 F.2d 634, 636 (1st Cir. 1979).\r\nHowever, the Fourth Circuit takes a minority view, reasoning that because remands for lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defect in removal are\r\nunappealable, &quot;the plain language of the statute[] . . . support[s] the conclusion that Â§1447 divests a district court of jurisdiction upon the entry of\r\nits remand order&quot; despite the federal clerk's duty to send a certified copy.&nbsp; In re Lowe, 102 F.3d 731, 735 (4th Cir. 1996) (considering and\r\ndeclining the majority approach, holding &quot;a federal court loses jurisdiction over [the] case as soon as its order to remand the case is entered[] . .\r\n.&nbsp; [f]rom that point on, it cannot reconsider its ruling even if the district court clerk fails to mail . . . a certified copy&quot;);[3] see also Bryan v. BellSouth Commc'ns, Inc., 492 F.3d 231, 235 n.1 (4th Cir. 2007) (recognizing &quot;a remand is\r\neffective when the district court mails a certified copy . . . see [1447(c)] . . . &nbsp;or . . . if the remand is based on the lack of\r\nsubject-matter jurisdiction . . . when the remand order is entered, see [Lowe]&quot;)[4] (emphasis added).\r\nAccordingly, the South Carolina Federal District Court lost jurisdiction when the order of remand was entered.[5]&nbsp;\r\nWe believe this ends the inquiry.&nbsp; However, because Hulsey's assertion that the state court also lacks subject matter jurisdiction seems to leave the case\r\ncaught in jurisdictional limbo, or as other courts have dubbed it, on &quot;a jurisdictional hiatus,&quot; for lack of the mailing, State v. City of\r\nAlbuquerque, 889 P.2d 204, 207 (N.M. Ct. App. 1993) aff'd 889 P.2d 185 (N.M. 1994), we therefore address whether the mailing is required for the\r\nSouth Carolina Circuit Court to exercise jurisdiction.\r\nWe start with the premise that our state court's jurisdiction is general, derived exclusively from article V, section 11 of the South Carolina Constitution,\r\nnot from federal law.&nbsp; S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11; see, e.g., Fairfax Countywide Citizens Ass'n v. Fairfax County, 571 F.2d 1299, 1304 (4th\r\nCir. 1978) (indicating that unlike federal courts, state courts are courts of general jurisdiction). &nbsp;On the other hand, the jurisdiction of federal courts\r\nis limited to that expressly authorized by the United States Constitution or statute enacted by Congress pursuant thereto. &nbsp;Exxon Mobile Corp. v.\r\nAllapattah Servs., Inc., 545 U.S. 546, 553 (2005); Victory Carriers Inc. v. Law, 404 U.S. 202, 212 (1971) (&quot;The power reserved to the states,\r\nunder the Constitution, to provide for the determination of controversies in their courts, may be restricted only by the action of Congress in conformity to the\r\njudiciary sections of the Constitution.&quot;) (internal citation and quotation marks omitted); U.S. Const. art. III, Â§ 1 (&quot;The judicial Power of the\r\nUnited States, shall be vested in one supreme Court, and in such inferior Courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain and establish.&quot;); see\r\nThe Federalist No. 82, at 515-16 (Alexander Hamilton) (Wright ed., 2002) (considering the federal government has only the power exclusively delegated to it, it\r\nstands as a &quot;rule&quot; that &quot;the State courts will retain . . . jurisdiction[,] . . . unless it appears to have been taken away in one of the\r\nenumerated modes&quot;);&nbsp; Thus, unless otherwise prohibited by statute, a state court's jurisdiction is limited only by the federal court's proper exercise\r\nof jurisdiction over a case pursuant to Congressional act â€“ which according to Fourth Circuit jurisprudence in Lowe, ceased upon entry of the remand\r\norder.[6]\r\nIn this regard, the distinction between the majority and minority views becomes significant.&nbsp; Section 1446(d) provides a prohibition on state action in\r\nthat once removal is properly effectuated, &quot;the State court shall proceed no further unless and until the case is remanded.&quot; (emphasis\r\nadded).&nbsp; Section 1447(c) states: &quot;A certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of the State court.&nbsp; The\r\nState court may thereupon proceed.&quot; (emphasis added).&nbsp; Naturally, if a federal court takes the majority view, making the remand dependent upon\r\nthe mailing, the case is remanded and the order is mailed at the same point in time.&nbsp; Therefore, the lack of a mailing forecloses state court jurisdiction\r\nnot because a state court should interpret section 1447(c) to provide the state may only proceed upon the mailing but because section 1446(d) prohibits\r\nstate action until remanded.&nbsp; However, under the minority view, this is not the case as a remand does not require the mailing.&nbsp; Thus, in this circuit,\r\na state court exercising jurisdiction over a case upon entry of remand neither imposes on federal jurisdiction nor violates these federal jurisdiction\r\nprovisions.\r\nSimilarly, the states that have confronted this issue recognize the significance of the distinction between the majority and minority view.&nbsp;\r\nIn the cases applying the majority view, the revesting of jurisdiction occurs on the mailing because the finality of the remand and accompanying loss of\r\nfederal jurisdiction requires the same.&nbsp; See, e.g., Nixon v. Moore, 108 S.W.3d 813, 817-18 (Mo. Ct. App. 2003) (adopting the majority\r\napproach that the mailing is the operative event at which jurisdiction switches, but recognizing the minority reaches a different result); Quaestor Invs.,\r\nInc. v. State of Chiapas, 997 S.W.2d 226, 228 (Tex. 1999) (noting that &quot;[i]n answering the question of when a jurisdictional transfer occurs between\r\nfederal and state court, most courts[] . . . interpret[ Section 1447(c)] . . . to mean that the federal court loses jurisdiction once the federal court clerk\r\nhas mailed a certified copy&quot; but others, particularly the Fourth Circuit in Lowe, take an opposite view).&nbsp; However, the same rationale compels\r\na different result under the minority view.&nbsp; See Nixon, 108 S.W.3d at 817 (citing Lowe for the proposition that a &quot;few federal\r\n[circuits] have reached [a minority approach] . . . holding that jurisdiction transfers back to the state as soon as an order of remand is entered&quot;); Quaestor,\r\n997 S.W.2d at 228 (stating that Lowe &quot;hold[s] that jurisdiction returns to the state court when the district court enters the remand&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nThus, whether the mailing of the certified copy is required to revest jurisdiction is simply a product of what interpretation is employed to determine when the\r\nfederal court loses jurisdiction.[7]&nbsp;\r\nThus, the minority view accepts that the &quot;require[ment that] the clerk of the district court [] mail a certified copy of the remand order to the clerk\r\nof the state court, is not jurisdictional.&quot; &nbsp;Int'l Lottery, Inc. v. Kerouac, 657 N.E.2d 820, 823 (Ohio Ct. App. 1995) (emphasis added)\r\n(citing&nbsp; Van Ryn v. Korean Air Line, 640 F. Supp. 284 (C.D. Cal. 1985) (standing for the proposition that entry of remand divests the federal court\r\nof jurisdiction notwithstanding the failure of the clerk to send a certified copy)); see Albuquerque, 889 P.2d at 206 (holding &quot;the actions\r\nof a federal judge in signing and entering a remand order authorize subsequent state court actions even when the federal court clerk fails to mail the remand\r\norder to the clerk of the state court&quot;); see also Lowe, 102 F.3d at 735 (&quot;'Logic also indicates that it should be the action of a court\r\n(entering the order of remand) rather than the action of a clerk (mailing a certified copy) of the order that should determine vesting of\r\njurisdiction'&quot;) (quoting Van Ryn, 640 F. Supp. at 285) (emphasis added).&nbsp; In light of the Fourth Circuit having taken the minority approach, we\r\nmust agree that the duty to send the mailing is not a jurisdictional requirement but a procedural one.&nbsp; Therefore, we find the South Carolina Circuit Court\r\ndid not act without subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nThis is bolstered by the fact that even in jurisdictions requiring the mailing for finality of the remand, the same is not necessarily required for the state\r\nto exercise jurisdiction.&nbsp; For instance, in Nixon the Missouri Court of Appeals recognized:\r\n\r\n  The state court may not be immediately notified by the federal court of the order of remand. Counsel, of course, are promptly notified of the order of\r\n  remand, and often counsel will, in the interest of saving time, notify the state court and proceed in the interim with the state court action. There is\r\n  nothing in the federal statutory scheme prohibiting the parties from proceeding at that point.\r\n\r\nNixon, 108 S.W.3d at 817 (emphasis added).[8]&nbsp; Thus, although requiring the mailing to make the remand\r\norder final, the same is not an indispensible jurisdictional requirement. &nbsp;See Bacon v. Dir. of Revenue, State of Mo., 948 S.W.2d 266, 267\r\n(Mo. Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;Subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by . . . consent, and the lack thereof cannot be waived.&quot;).&nbsp; With nothing\r\nin the federal statutory scheme to prohibit this, the same would hold true in South Carolina, supporting our disinclination to see the mailing requirement as\r\njurisdictional.&nbsp; See In re Nov. 4, 2008 Bluffton Town Council Election, 385 S.C. 632, 636, 686 S.E.2d 683, 686 (2009) (&quot;The lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by consent of the parties . . . .&quot;).\r\nBecause we find the mailing requirement is procedural not jurisdictional, the issue is not properly before this court as a result of Hulsey's failure to\r\ntimely object.&nbsp; See Beaufort County v. Butler, 316 S.C. 465, 467, 451 S.E.2d 386, 387-88 (1994) (stating &quot;a procedural right may be\r\nwaived . . . [and a] party who fails to object to the trial of a case . . . cannot later assert the trial court erred in trying the case . . .&quot;); Doe v.\r\nS.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. App. 1997) (stating that &quot;[t]he duty is on the litigant to make a timely objection in order to\r\npreserve the right to review . . .&nbsp; [and] . . . [a] contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for appellate review&quot;); In\r\nre Michael H., 360 S.C. 540, 546, 602 S.E.2d 729, 732 (2004) (&quot;In order to preserve an issue for appeal, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the\r\ntrial court.&quot;).[9]\r\nFurther, to warrant reversal a party must demonstrate the alleged procedural failure caused him prejudice.&nbsp; See Chastain v. Hiltabidle,\r\n381 S.C. 508, 519, 673 S.E.2d 826, 831 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating in order to demonstrate prejudice from procedural non-compliance, a party must establish it\r\n&quot;would have done something different&quot; had procedure been followed).&nbsp; Hulsey has failed to demonstrate that he was prejudiced by the absence of\r\nthe certified copy.&nbsp; Here, Hulsey cannot, and does not, maintain notice was insufficient.&nbsp; The record makes clear that the Charleston County Clerk of\r\nCourt received notice of a final and unappealable order of remand on July 21, 2006, and that on July 27, 2006, she mailed notice that she received and entered\r\nthis final and unappealable order to all parties, just as she would have done had she received of a certified copy of the order.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, Husley personally received notice.&nbsp; The notice sent to Hulsey from the Charleston County Clerk makes no indication of whether the notice of\r\nremand it received was certified or not.&nbsp; Consequently, Hulsey's notice was not impacted by the fact that the Charleston County Clerk did not receive a\r\ncertified copy of the order.&nbsp; Further, pursuant to Section 5 of the Policies and Procedures for the electronic case filing system (ECF) employed in the\r\nfederal court, by removing the case Hulsey agreed to receive notice of entry of any order or judgment through electronic transmittal.&nbsp; Thus, in addition to\r\nnotice from the state court, Hulsey had notice from the federal court of the entry of the final and unappealable remand order and consequently was not\r\nprejudiced.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, the South Carolina Circuit Court did not act without subject matter jurisdiction, and Hulsey was not otherwise prejudiced by the Federal Clerk's\r\nfailure to send a certified copy of the order of remand.[10]&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entry of Default\r\nHulsey argues the trial court erred in failing to set aside entry of default because (a) the answer was timely or (b) good cause existed to set aside the\r\nentry of default under Rule 55(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nAs to the issue of whether the answer was timely filed, Hulsey points out this is an issue of interpretation of a rule or statute and is therefore reviewed\r\nde novo.&nbsp; See Catawba Indian Tribe of S.C. v. State, 372 S.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007) (stating the interpretation of a statute\r\nis a question of law, which the appellate court is free to decide with no particular deference to the trial court).&nbsp; Further, our standard of review leaves\r\nthe decision to set aside an entry of default within the sound discretion of the trial court, which we will not reverse absent an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Stark\r\nTruss Co. v. Superior Const. Corp., 360 S.C. 503, 508, 602 S.E.2d 99, 101 (Ct. App. 2004).&nbsp; Such an abuse of discretion occurs when the decision is\r\nbased upon an error of law or when the order is without evidentiary support.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Timeliness of the Answer\r\nIn order to find the August 29 answer was timely Husley urges this court to adopt a rule that the thirty-day time period in which to answer starts over upon\r\nremand.[11]&nbsp; We are not inclined to adopt such a rule.\r\nRule 12(a), SCRCP, provides: &quot;A defendant shall serve his answer within 30 days after the service of the complaint upon him[] . . . .&quot;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, federal rules provide &quot;[a] defendant who did not answer [in state court] before removal must answer . . . within the longest of . . . :&quot; (A)\r\ntwenty days after being served or otherwise receiving the initial pleading or (B) within five days after notice of removal is filed.&nbsp; Rule 81(c)(2), FRCP.\r\nIn this case, Hulsey removed fourteen days after being served.&nbsp; Thus, although under Rule 12(a), SCRCP, he was entitled to another sixteen days to\r\nanswer, by choosing to remove the case to federal court, he willfully subjected himself to the shortened time period of Rule 81(c)(2), FRCP â€“ providing he\r\nmust answer within six days (twenty days after being served).&nbsp; However, in the seventy-six days between removal and the entry of remand, Husley neglected\r\nto answer.&nbsp;\r\nInitially, we find no authority in this state to support the position that a removing party is entitled to a fresh thirty days to answer a complaint upon\r\nremand.&nbsp; Neither did the trial court.&nbsp; Rather, looking at both the federal rules and state rules, in the exceptionally rare circumstance in which a\r\ncase would be remanded to the state court before an answer was due pursuant to Federal Rule 81(c)(2), a plain reading of South Carolina Rule 12(a) would require\r\nan answer within thirty days of service.&nbsp; However, seemingly giving Hulsey the benefit of the doubt, the trial court determined that because the state\r\ncourt is to proceed as if no removal had been attempted, removal to federal court tolls the thirty day time period and therefore, upon remand Hulsey should be\r\nallowed the remainder of any unexpired time.[12] &nbsp;&nbsp;See State v. Columbia Ry., Gas &amp; Elec.,\r\n112 S.C. 528, 537, 100 S.E. 355, 357 (1919) (stating that upon remand it is the duty of the state court to proceed as if no removal had been attempted).\r\nIn this case, because Hulsey failed to answer under the plain reading of either Rule 12(a), SCRCP, or Rule 81(c)(2), FRCP; or under the more liberal approach\r\nprovided by the trial court, it is of no consequence which approach we would adopt.&nbsp; Therefore, we are not occasioned to opine on the more acceptable\r\nmethod.[13]&nbsp; It suffices that we find no indication that a party is entitled to a fresh thirty-day period upon\r\nremand.&nbsp; Accordingly, we are disinclined to adopt a rule allowing the same.&nbsp; Such action is not the province of this court, but that of our\r\nlegislature or supreme court.\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 55(c)\r\nHulsey next argues the trial court erred in failing to set aside the entry of default under Rule 55(c), SCRCP.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThe issue before this court is not whether we would find good cause, but whether the decision to deny the motion to set aside default is supportable by the\r\nevidence and not controlled by an error of law.&nbsp; Williams v. Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. 373, 375, 440 S.E.2d 408, 409 (Ct. App. 1994).&nbsp; A motion\r\nto set aside entry of default under Rule 55(c) is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.&nbsp; Id.\r\nUnder Rule 55(c), the entry of default may be set aside for &quot;good cause shown,&quot; which is a less stringent standard than the excusable neglect\r\nstandard of Rule 60(b). Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus. Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 607, 681 S.E.2d 885, 888 (2009).[14]&nbsp; The good cause standard of Rule 55(c) requires, as a threshold burden, a party to put forth &quot;an explanation for the default and give\r\nreasons why vacation of the default entry would serve the interests of justice.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; &quot;Once a party has put forth a satisfactory\r\nexplanation . . . the trial court must also consider [the Wham[15] factors]: (1) the timing of the motion\r\nfor relief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\nat 607-08, 681 S.E.2d at 888.&nbsp; However, a trial court need not make specific findings of fact for each factor if sufficient evidence supports a trial\r\ncourt's determination that no reasonable explanation exists for vacation of default.&nbsp; Id.\r\nIn this case, the trial court held that because &quot;there appears . . . to be no reasonable basis for [Hulsey's] assumption that the [thirty] day time to\r\nfile an answer starts completely anew upon remand[,] . . . no good cause has been demonstrated . . . .&quot;&nbsp; While we appreciate the trial court did not\r\nhave the benefit of the Sundown opinion, we find Sundown did nothing to abate the discretion to which a trial court is entitled in ruling on a\r\nRule 55(c) motion. &nbsp;Nor did it change the standard this court applies when reviewing such a decision.&nbsp; What constitutes a satisfactory explanation\r\nthat serves the interests of justice remains within the sound discretion of the trial court.[16] &nbsp;\r\nIn South Carolina, negligence on the part of an attorney is imputable to the client and will not be the basis of finding good cause to set aside entry of\r\ndefault.&nbsp; See Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. at 375, 440 S.E.2d at 410 (indicating, prior to Sundown, that the imputed negligence of an\r\nattorney to a defaulting litigant is not good cause).&nbsp; Similarly, our supreme court has recognized subsequent to Sundown that the good cause\r\nstandard of Rule 55(c), encompasses a degree of reasonableness.&nbsp; See Richardson v. P.V., Inc., 383 S.C. 610, 618-19, 682 S.E.2d 263, 267\r\n(2009) (finding, after Sundown, that negligence on the part of an insurance company or attorney will be imputed to a defaulting litigant and negligence\r\ndoes not constitute good cause to relieve an appellant from entry of default); see also Black's Law Dictionary 1133 (9th ed. 2009) (defining negligence\r\nas the failure to act reasonably under a specific set of circumstances).&nbsp; It stands, therefore, that because unreasonable conduct does not amount to good\r\ncause, an unreasonable explanation for defaulting is not a satisfactory explanation that serves a sufficient interest of justice.[17]&nbsp;\r\nIn the case at bar, although the supreme court had not yet issued the Sundown opinion, the trial court nonetheless addressed Hulsey's explanation of\r\ndefault and specifically found it unreasonable.&nbsp; We find the record supports the finding that Husley's explanation for default is unreasonable.[18]&nbsp; Vanvolkenburg, 312 S.C. at 375, 440 S.E.2d at 409 (stating the &quot;issue before this [c]ourt . . .\r\nis not whether we believe good cause existed . . . [but] whether the trial court's determination is supported by the evidence&quot;).&nbsp; Further, we are\r\naware of no authority either prior to or after Sundown that compels this court to find it is not within the trial court's discretion to deny a Rule 55(c)\r\nmotion for an unreasonable failure to answer.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion.&nbsp;\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Default Damages Trial\r\nHulsey's allegation of error as to the damages trial is threefold.&nbsp; He argues (a) the process employed by South Carolina courts is unconstitutional and\r\ndeprives a default defendant of due process; (b) specifically as to this case, the trial court erred in allowing introduction of new allegations during the\r\ndamages hearing, in the form of testimony about a link on Hulsey's website to the slanderous article; and (c) the trial court erred by improperly commenting on\r\nthe facts.\r\nThis court's standard of review for the grant or denial of a motion for a new trial extends substantial deference to the trial court.&nbsp; Vinson v.\r\nHartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723 (Ct. App. 1996).&nbsp;&nbsp; The trial court's decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless the finding\r\nis wholly unsupported by the evidence or based on an error of law.&nbsp; Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 446, 520 S.E.2d 625, 628-29 (Ct. App.\r\n1999).&nbsp;\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; South Carolina's default damages procedure\r\nHulsey argues the process employed by the State of South Carolina during a default damages hearing is unconstitutional.&nbsp; We must disagree.\r\nDuring a default damages trial, the defendant's participation shall be limited to cross-examination and objection to the plaintiff's evidence.&nbsp; Roche\r\nv. Young Bros. of Florence, 332 S.C. 75, 81-82, 504 S.E.2d 311, 314 (1998); Howard v. Holiday Inn, Inc., 271 S.C. 238, 241, 246 S.E.2d 880, 882\r\n(1978); Doe v. SBM, 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488, S.E.2d 878 881 (Ct. App. 1997); Ammons v. Hood, 288 S.C. 278, 282, 341 S.E.2d 816, 818 (Ct. App.\r\n1986).\r\nOn appeal, Hulsey provides no controlling authority[19] for his position that this court can, or should, diverge\r\nfrom longstanding rules established by our supreme court.&nbsp; Accordingly, we cannot and do not find the default damages hearing to be unconstitutional.\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction of testimony about the website link\r\nHulsey maintains that the entry of default is tantamount to admission of the allegations of the complaint, but nothing more.&nbsp; See Wiggins v.\r\nTodd, 296 S.C. 432, 435, 373 S.E.2d 704, 705-06 (Ct. App. 1988) (stating that when a defendant is in default, the plaintiff's right to recover is\r\ncircumscribed by the complaint drafted).&nbsp; Therefore, Hulsey alleges the trial court erred in allowing Limehouse to testify to new allegations outside the\r\nconfines of the complaint, particularly about a link on Hulsey's website to the slanderous newspaper article.&nbsp; However, an allegation of error as to the\r\nintroduction of evidence during a default damages proceeding will not be preserved for appellate review absent a contemporaneous objection.&nbsp; SBM,\r\n327 S.C. at 356, 488 S.E.2d at 881.\r\nHere, Hulsey failed to object to any testimony regarding the publication or link on the website.&nbsp; Accordingly, this allegation of error is not preserved\r\nfor our review.\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trial court commenting on the facts\r\nGenerally a &quot;trial [court] should not intimate to the jury any opinion on the facts of a case, whether intentionally or unintentionally.&quot;&nbsp; Sierra\r\nv. Skelton, 307 S.C. 217, 225, 414 S.E.2d 169, 174 (Ct. App. 1992).&nbsp;\r\nIn this case, during deliberations, the jury sent out a question inquiring whether &quot;the link to the April 24, 2004, article [was] still on . . .\r\nHulsey's website?&nbsp; [And i]f not, when was it removed?&quot; The trial court responded by informing the jury that there was testimony that as of the Monday\r\nof trial, the link remained on the website.&nbsp;\r\nHulsey argues this &quot;constitute[s] an improper comment on the facts.&quot;&nbsp; Further, Hulsey argues &quot;even more inexplicably, Limehouse was\r\nallowed to testify that the link on the website was a violation of a court order while Hulsey was precluded from introducing the very court order . . . which\r\nindisputably evidences that there was no prohibition from mentioning the case on the firm website.&quot;&nbsp; Initially, Hulsey made no objection to the\r\ntestimony regarding the court order, and under the default damages procedure, would have been free to cross-examine Limehouse on this matter.&nbsp; Furthermore,\r\nHulsey does nothing to demonstrate how the trial court's answer to the jury's inquiry demonstrated an imparting of opinion on the facts of the case.&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, we find no error.&nbsp;\r\nIV.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\nHulsey argues the award of punitive damages was founded on trial court error and constituted a denial of due process.&nbsp; Hulsey presents four separate\r\narguments on this issue: (a) due process demands a default litigant be given an opportunity to defend punitive damages, (b) the jury should have been instructed\r\nthat it could return an award of no punitive damages, (c) the trial court allowed and actually invited the jury to consider matters not proper for their\r\nconsideration in awarding punitive damages, and (d) the trial court erred in confirming the award.\r\nGenerally, the trial court's decision on a motion for a new trial will not be disturbed on appeal unless the finding is wholly unsupported by the evidence or\r\nbased on an error of law.&nbsp; Stevens v. Allen, 336 S.C. 439, 446, 520 S.E.2d 625, 628-29 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Due Process\r\nHulsey maintains employing South Carolina's procedures for a default damages hearing in a case in which punitive damages are sought amounts to a\r\nconstitutional due process violation.&nbsp; Hulsey further argues this due process violation was compounded by the facts that the trial court failed to exercise\r\nits obligation to independently make a threshold determination of whether the defendants' conduct rose to the level of warranting punitive damages, and that\r\nLimehouse was allowed to go into matters beyond the bounds of the complaint.&nbsp;\r\nInitially, Hulsey cites no authority to support the proposition that South Carolina should employ a different default damages procedure for punitive damages\r\nthan for actual damages.&nbsp; See Roche, 332 S.C. 75, 504 S.E.2d 311 (making no distinction on appeal between punitive damages and actual damages\r\nduring a default damages trial).\r\nAs to the trial court's failure to make a threshold determination that Hulsey's conduct warranted punitive damages, this issue was specifically addressed\r\nwhen the trial court denied Hulsey's motion for a directed verdict on punitive damages. &nbsp;Although it is unclear from the briefs on appeal whether\r\nHulsey challenges this ruling on appeal, to the extent that he may be alleging the trial court improperly denied the directed verdict on the issue of punitive\r\ndamages, we briefly address the issue.&nbsp;\r\nIn reviewing the denial of a motion for a directed verdict, this court applies the same standard as the trial court, viewing the evidence and the inferences\r\nin the light most favorable to the non-moving party, and will not reverse the denial unless there is no evidence to support the ruling.&nbsp; All Saints\r\nParish Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church in Diocese of S.C., 385 S.C. 428, 441-42, 685 S.E.2d 163, 170 (2009).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen viewed in the light most favorable to Limehouse, there exists evidence which supports submitting the issue of punitive damages to the jury for\r\nconsideration, including the intentional nature of the action, Hulsey's degree of culpability, and his awareness of the conduct.&nbsp; Accordingly, to the\r\nextent Hulsey may be challenging this ruling, we find no error.&nbsp;\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Instruction on punitive damages\r\nHulsey next argues the trial court erred by telling the jury it was required to award punitive damages.&nbsp; We find no such instruction.&nbsp;\r\nPunitive damages may be awarded, in the interest of society in punishing or deterring the conduct, or vindicating a private right, when the plaintiff proves\r\nentitlement to such damages by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2005) (stating punitive damages must be proved by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence); Austin v. Specialty Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 312, 594 S.E.2d 867, 874 (Ct. App. 2004) (indicating punitive damages may\r\nbe awarded for various reasons).\r\nGenerally, this court will not reverse the decision of the trial court as to a particular jury instruction absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Cole\r\nv. Raut, 378 S.C. 398, 405, 663 S.E.2d 30, 33 (2008).&nbsp; A trial court abuses its discretion in this regard when the ruling is not supported by the\r\nevidence or is based on an error of law.&nbsp; Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2009).&nbsp;\r\nHulsey argues the trial court instructed the jury it had to award punitive damages and submitted a jury verdict form that required an award of punitive\r\ndamages.&nbsp; However, upon review of the verdict form we see nothing that required the jury to return punitive damages.&nbsp; Furthermore, Hulsey does not\r\ncite, or otherwise bring to this court's attention, any specific language used by the trial court to support that it instructed the jury it had to award\r\npunitive damages.&nbsp;\r\nInitially, the trial court instructed the jury: &quot;Punitive damages can only be awarded where the plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence that\r\nthe defendant's actions were willful, wanton, malicious, or in reckless disregard for the plaintiff's rights.&quot;&nbsp; Although not specified, the basis for\r\nHulsey's allegation of error is presumably premised upon the use of the word &quot;duty&quot; in a single statement in an otherwise lengthy and thorough\r\ninstruction in which the trial court stated: &quot;Under proper allegations, a [sic] plaintiff proves by clear and convincing evidence a willful, wanton,\r\nreckless, and malicious violation of his rights.&nbsp; It is not only the right, but the duty of the jury to award punitive damages.&quot;&nbsp; However, the\r\ntrial court's very next sentence clarified the use of this term, stating: &quot;Accordingly, if you should find that the plaintiff is entitled to recover\r\npunitive damages in addition to actual damages, it would be your duty to include such damages in your verdict and award such an amount as you may deem\r\nreasonable and proper in light of the facts and circumstances.&quot; (emphasis added).&nbsp;\r\nUpon review of the record we find the trial court properly instructed the jury on the law.&nbsp; See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-33-135 (2005) (stating\r\npunitive damages must be proved by clear and convincing evidence).&nbsp; The trial court did not instruct the jury it had to award punitive damages, but\r\nsimply instructed the jury that if it found the plaintiff entitled to punitive damages it was their duty to determine the amount to which the Limehouse\r\nwas entitled.&nbsp; Therefore, we find no error.\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Matters not appropriate for consideration of punitive damages\r\nNext, Hulsey alleges his constitutional due process rights were violated because of the trial court's and Limehouse's repeated references to the default,\r\narguing this referencing insinuated that the jury should punish Hulsey for his failure to follow the procedural rules.&nbsp; Further, Hulsey alleges this error\r\nwas compounded by the trial court allowing Limehouse's wife to testify as to the link on Hulsey's website, as well as to statements about how the ordeal\r\naffected Limehouse's family.&nbsp; Finally, Hulsey argues the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider the settlement of the RICO case, and admitting\r\ntestimony as to Hulsey's net worth.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nFirst, Hulsey does not cite any authority to support the position that discussion of the default would support a finding that due process had been\r\ndenied.&nbsp; Further, we find no indication on the record that the trial court suggested or otherwise implied that Hulsey's failure to answer should support\r\nthe imposition of punitive damages.&nbsp;\r\nSecond, as to the allegations pertaining to the website link, as noted Hulsey made no objection to this during the damages trial and consequently the issue\r\nis not preserved for our review.&nbsp; See SBM, 327 S.C. at 356, 488 S.E.2d at 881 (indicating an allegation of error as to the introduction of\r\nevidence during a default damages proceeding will not be preserved for appellate review absent a contemporaneous objection to the same).&nbsp;\r\nThird, Hulsey contends it was error to allow Limehouse's wife to mention the impact of the slander on his family because pursuant to Philip Morris USA v.\r\nWilliams, 127 S.Ct. 1057 (2007), punitive damages cannot be imposed to punish a defendant for harm visited upon others.&nbsp; However, at trial, this\r\nargument was specifically presented as one of relevance.\r\nEvidence is relevant, and generally admissible, if it has any tendency to make the existence of a fact of consequence more or less probable than it would be\r\nwithout the evidence.&nbsp; Rules 401, 402, SCRE.&nbsp; The introduction of evidence is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and will not be\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; Richardson v. Donald Hawkins Const., Inc., 381 S.C. 347, 352, 673 S.E.2d 808, 811 (2009); Jamison\r\nv. Ford Motor Co., 373 S.C. 248, 268, 644 S.E.2d 755, 765 (Ct. App. 2007).&nbsp; In this case, the trial court found the testimony to be relevant because it\r\nwas &quot;within the scope of how it affected [Limehouse], and his family relationships.&quot;&nbsp; We agree that the impact on Limehouse's immediate family\r\nbears on the extent of the impact he suffered, and accordingly we find no abuse of discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFinally, Hulsey argues the trial court erred in allowing the jury to consider the settlement of the prior RICO case as well as erroneous testimony that\r\nHulsey's net worth was in excess of $81 million.&nbsp; Initially, contrary to Hulsey's position that Limehouse was able to paint him as a &quot;greedy hotshot\r\nlawyer,&quot; Limehouse's own witness, John Massalon, conceded he was aware Hulsey was pro bono counsel on the previous RICO case.&nbsp; Furthermore, the record\r\ndoes not indicate any objection was made to the testimony of Bank of America employee Bernadette DeWitt when she testified as to Hulsey's net worth. &nbsp;The\r\nevidence bears out the financial declaration on which she relied was certified as a true, complete, and accurate statement of Hulsey's financials and as such,\r\nany misinformation presented on this issue was the result of Hulsey's own misrepresentation.&nbsp; Accordingly, we find no error.\r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Confirmation of punitive damages.\r\nFinally, Hulsey argues the trial court erred in confirming the award of punitive damages.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nOur supreme court recently indicated an appellate court's scope of review to be de novo.&nbsp; Mitchell v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 583, 686\r\nS.E.2d 176, 185, 183 (2009).&nbsp;\r\nThe Fortis, court consolidated the post judgment due process analysis for punitive damages.&nbsp; In reviewing an award of punitive damages, we\r\nconsider (1) the reprehensibility of the conduct, (2) the disparity or &quot;ratio&quot; between actual harm and the punitive damage award, and (3) the\r\ncomparative penalties.&nbsp; Fortis, 385 S.C. at 587-89, 686 S.E.2d at 185-86.\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Reprehensibility\r\n\r\n  In considering reprehensibility, a court should consider whether:\r\n  \r\n    (i) the harm caused was physical as opposed to economic; (ii) the tortious conduct evinced an indifference to or a reckless disregard for the health or\r\n    safety of others; (iii) the target of the conduct had financial vulnerability; (iv) the conduct involved repeated actions or was an isolated incident; and\r\n    (v) the harm was the result of intentional malice, trickery, or deceit, rather than mere accident.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 185, 686 S.E.2d at 587.&nbsp; This encompasses the defendant's culpability, the duration of the conduct, the defendant's awareness or\r\nconcealment, and the existence of similar past conduct.&nbsp; Id. at 185,&nbsp; n. 7, 686 S.E.2d at 587, n. 7.\r\nAlthough the harm here was not physical, and posed no threat to health or safety, the evidence indicates Hulsey, through involvement in the underlying RICO\r\naction, was aware of the nature and vulnerability of Limehouse's business.&nbsp; Also, although the statements were made in a single incident, because the\r\nstatements were made to the press, the evidence shows that the circumstances clearly indicated that the statements would be publicly reported and widely\r\ndisseminated.&nbsp; Finally, this conduct was not the result of accident or inadvertence.&nbsp; The statements were contemplated, intentionally made, and\r\ncoincided precisely with a filing of a lawsuit against Limehouse.&nbsp; Accordingly, our review of the evidence convinces us that Hulsey's conduct was\r\nsufficiently reprehensible to support punitive damages.[20]\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ratio\r\nThe courts of this state have affirmed punitive damage awards in excess of six times actual damages.&nbsp; See James v. Horace Mann Ins. Co.,\r\n371 S.C. 187, 196, 638 S.E.2d 667, 672 (2006) (affirming an award of punitive damages of 6.82 times actual damages); Cock-N-Bull Steak House, Inc. v.\r\nGenerali Ins. Co., 321 S.C. 1, 11, 466 S.E.2d 727, 733 (1996) (affirming an award of punitive damages roughly twenty-eight times actual damages).&nbsp;\r\nSimilarly, the supreme court has modified awards to reflect a 9.2:1 ratio.&nbsp; See Fortis, 385 S.C. at 594, 686 S.E.2d at 188. Here, the\r\npunitive damage award was slightly above twice actual damages.&nbsp; Accordingly, we do not find such an award to violate due process.\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Comparative Penalty\r\nIn looking to comparative cases, we find that in similar matters, our supreme court has upheld punitive damages which were over ten times that of actual\r\ndamages.&nbsp; See, e.g., Weir v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs. Inc., 312, S.C. 511, 518, 435 S.E.2d 864, 869 (1993) (affirming an award of $275,000 in\r\npunitive damages, in a slander case, where actual damages were found to be $25,000).&nbsp; Accordingly, we find no error here.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons above, the ruling of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.&nbsp;\r\nFEW, C.J., dissents.\r\nFEW, C.J., dissenting:&nbsp; I disagree with the majority's analysis of Issues I and II, and therefore dissent.&nbsp; Because my position on either\r\nIssue I or II would resolve this appeal, I would not reach Issues III and IV.\r\nI.&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nHulsey moved for a new trial and for relief from judgment on the ground that jurisdiction never re-vested in the state court after removal, and therefore\r\nfederal law prohibited the state court from proceeding with the case.&nbsp; The plain language of 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1446(d) and 1447(c) required that the motion be\r\ngranted.\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Plain Language of Sections 1446(d) and 1447(c)\r\nSection 1446(d) provides that after an action has been removed to federal court &quot;the State court shall proceed no further unless and until the case is\r\nremanded.&quot;&nbsp; A remand order based on a lack of subject matter jurisdiction, such as the remand order in this case, is governed by section 1447(c),[21] which requires that &quot;[a] certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed by the clerk to the clerk of\r\nthe State court.&quot;&nbsp; The next sentence of section 1447(c)â€”&quot;The State court may thereupon proceed with such case&quot;â€”is the key to this\r\ncase.&nbsp; The word &quot;thereupon&quot; sets the point in time when the case is &quot;remanded.&quot;&nbsp; Before a certified copy of the remand order is\r\nmailed, the state court may not proceed; afterwards, it may.&nbsp; The section 1446(d) prohibition of &quot;shall proceed no further&quot; remains in effect\r\nuntil the section 1447(c) requirement that a &quot;certified copy of the order of remand shall be mailed&quot; has been met.&nbsp; This plain language is all\r\nthat is necessary to resolve this appeal.&nbsp; A certified copy of the order of remand was never mailed to the state court clerk.&nbsp; Under 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§\r\n1446(d) and 1447(c), therefore, the state court had no power to proceed.&nbsp; Because the state court acted when federal law prohibited it from doing so, the\r\nresulting judgment was void.&nbsp; The trial court's failure to grant relief from the judgment was error and must be reversed.\r\nThe majority takes the position that the mailing of a certified copy of the remand order does not determine the point in time when a state court may proceed\r\nafter remand.&nbsp; Their position is based primarily on two grounds.&nbsp; First, the majority argues that the mailing of a certified copy of the remand order\r\nis not required in the Fourth Circuit under the authority of In re Lowe, 102 F.3d 731 (4th Cir. 1996).&nbsp; Second, the majority argues that to the\r\nextent the requirement is applicable, it is procedural, and the right to enforce it has been waived in this case.&nbsp;\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In re Lowe\r\nThe question before the court in Lowe was different from the question we face.&nbsp; Thus, the rule announced there is not applicable here.&nbsp; The\r\nmajority's argument that the mailing of a certified copy of the remand order is not required in the Fourth Circuit is based on the following passage from Lowe:\r\n&quot;we hold that a federal court loses jurisdiction over a case as soon as its order to remand the case is entered.&nbsp; From that point on, it cannot\r\nreconsider its ruling even if the district court clerk fails to mail to the state court a certified copy of the remand order.&quot;&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 736.&nbsp;\r\nThe majority has incorrectly framed the issue by relying on this passage.\r\nThe majority's argument begins by correctly recognizing that section 1446(d) allows the state court to proceed as soon as the case is\r\n&quot;remanded.&quot;&nbsp; However, the majority incorrectly concludes that the above statement from Lowe answers the question of when that\r\noccurs.&nbsp; I agree that Lowe sets the point in time when the federal court may not reconsider a remand order.&nbsp; However, that ruling is based on\r\nthe Fourth Circuit's interpretation of section 1447(d), not section 1446(d).&nbsp; Therefore, the majority is mistaken that Lowe sets the point in time\r\nwhen the case is remanded, and that it is not necessary to interpret section 1447(c) in order to determine when the state court may proceed.&nbsp; Rather, we\r\nare required to enforce the section 1447(c) requirement that a certified copy of the remand order be mailed before the state court may proceed.&nbsp;\r\nA careful analysis of Lowe demonstrates that the question it answered was different.&nbsp; The plaintiff sued her employer and two of its managers in\r\nthe state court of North Carolina.&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 732.&nbsp; After the defendants removed the case to federal court, the plaintiff moved to remand.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nA federal magistrate judge granted the motion on the grounds that the federal court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 732-33, 736.&nbsp; The\r\nfederal clerk mailed the order to the clerk of the state court, but the copy mailed was not certified.&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 733.&nbsp; Six months later, a\r\ndifferent federal magistrate judge granted the defendants' motion to reconsider.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; After the second magistrate denied two motions to\r\nremand, the plaintiff petitioned the Fourth Circuit for a writ of mandamus requiring the district court to return the case to the state court.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nAfter concluding generally that remand orders issued for lack of subject matter jurisdiction are not reviewable, 102 F.3d at 733-34, the Fourth Circuit framed\r\nthe specific issue before it as follows: &quot;[t]he only question remaining, then, is to identify when a court's decision to remand becomes unreviewable.&quot;&nbsp;\r\n102 F.3d at 734.&nbsp;\r\nThe court analyzed the question by focusing on 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1447(d), and in particular the word &quot;order.&quot; &nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Subsection 1447(d) provides only that a remand &quot;order&quot; may not be reviewed; it does not condition reviewability on any other event.&nbsp; Thus,\r\n  the plain language of subsection (d) indicates that a court may not reconsider its decision to remand, as soon as it formalizes that decision in an\r\n  &quot;order.&quot;\r\n\r\n102 F.3d at 734.&nbsp; The Lowe decision thus turns on the court's interpretation of the word &quot;order&quot; in section 1447(d) and not, as the\r\nmajority claims, on the timing of &quot;remanded&quot; under section 1446(d).&nbsp; In fact, Lowe does not even mention section 1446.&nbsp; The court\r\nclarifies its reliance on section 1447(d) with the language &quot;[1447(d)] does not condition reviewability on any other event.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nThis statement makes it clear that Lowe is not based on sections 1446(d) or 1447(c), which refer respectively to the events of &quot;remanded&quot; and\r\n&quot;mailed.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, the majority's contention that Lowe defines &quot;remanded&quot; is not correct.&nbsp;\r\nMoreover, Lowe contemplates that the section 1447(c) requirement of a mailing remains a part of the process of remand.&nbsp; Noting that it has read\r\nsections 1447(c) and (d) independently, 102 F.3d at 734 n.3, the court explains that section 1447(c) &quot;directs the district court clerk to mail a 'copy' of\r\nthe remand order to the state court, certainly implying that the order itself, the document Â§ 1447(d) tells us is unreviewable, is in existence before the time\r\nof the mailing.&quot;&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 734.&nbsp; If the Fourth Circuit's &quot;minority&quot; approach made the mailing required by section 1447(c)\r\nunnecessary, the Lowe court would have had no reason to provide this explanation that the section comes into play after the event of an &quot;order&quot;\r\ncontemplated in section 1447(d).&nbsp;\r\nThe majority and I agree that the plain language &quot;shall proceed no further&quot; in section 1446(d) prohibits a state court from acting on a removed\r\ncase until the case is &quot;remanded.&quot;&nbsp; The question we face is when federal law sets that point in time, and thus removes the &quot;shall proceed no\r\nfurther&quot; prohibition.&nbsp; The answer to that question is not found in Lowe's interpretation of section 1447(d), but in the plain language of\r\nsections 1446(d) and 1447(c).&nbsp;\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiver\r\nThe majority's second ground for its position is that the section 1447(c) requirement of mailing a certified copy is a procedural requirement rather than a\r\njurisdictional one.&nbsp; The distinction is irrelevant in this case.&nbsp; Congress enacted a statute providing that when a case is removed to federal court\r\nthe state court is prohibited from further action &quot;unless and until the case is remanded.&quot;&nbsp; 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1446(d).&nbsp; This prohibition may not\r\nbe avoided by labeling the mailing requirement procedural.&nbsp; The prohibition is imposed by a federal statute and is likewise lifted only in accordance with\r\nfederal statutes: 28 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1446(d) and 1447(c).&nbsp; The question we face in this appeal requires us to interpret these statutes and apply their plain\r\nlanguage to the facts of this case.&nbsp; See Media Gen. Commc'ns, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 388 S.C. 138, 148, 694 S.E.2d 525, 530 (2010)\r\n(&quot;Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, . . . the court has no right to impose another\r\nmeaning.&quot;).\r\nThe majority's ruling not only imposes another meaning on these statutes, but it also renders an entire sentence of the United States Code meaningless by\r\neliminating the section 1447(c) requirement that the federal clerk mail a certified copy of the remand order.&nbsp; This court is not permitted to interpret a\r\nstatute so as to render a part of it meaningless.&nbsp; See Coyne &amp; Delany Co. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of Va., Inc., 102 F.3d 712, 715\r\n(4th Cir. 1996) (&quot;Absent clear congressional intent to the contrary, we will assume the legislature did not intend to pass vain or meaningless\r\nlegislation.&quot;); Duvall v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 377 S.C. 36, 42, 659 S.E.2d 125, 128&nbsp;(2008) (&quot;The Court must presume the\r\nLegislature intended its statutes to accomplish something and did not intend a futile act.&quot;).\r\nBy characterizing the mailing requirement as procedural, the majority has converted section 1447(c) to a notice statute, so that the requirement of mailing a\r\ncertified copy can be ignored because, as the majority states, &quot;Hulsey cannot, and does not, maintain notice was insufficient.&quot;&nbsp; I do not believe\r\nthis court is free to be so loose with the requirements of federal law.&nbsp; If Congress intended that notice of a remand was sufficient to enable the state\r\ncourt to proceed, it could easily have drafted sections 1446(d) and 1447(c) accordingly.\r\nThe majority's waiver argument also suggests that the issue is not preserved for appellate review because it was not raised to the trial court before\r\njudgment was entered.&nbsp; The situation in which the federal removal statutes prohibit a state court from proceeding after a case is removed is analogous to\r\nthe situation in which the federal bankruptcy stay prohibits a state court from taking action against a debtor who has filed a bankruptcy petition.&nbsp; See\r\n11 U.S.C. Â§ 362(a)(1) (2004 &amp; Supp. 2010).&nbsp; In that instance, as in this one, the validity of a judgment entered in state court during the time in\r\nwhich federal law prohibits it can be raised at any time.&nbsp; See Ex Parte Reichlyn, 310 S.C. 495, 498-99, 427 S.E.2d 661, 663-64 (1993)\r\n(declaring a judgment void when the judgment was entered during the pendency of the bankruptcy stay).\r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryan v.

BellSouth Communications, Inc., 492 F.3d 231 (4th Cir. 2007) (Bryan II).[22]&nbsp; As I will explain,\r\nthe footnote supports the position I have taken in this dissent.&nbsp; To understand Bryan II, however, it is important to note that the remand order was\r\nnot made pursuant to section 1447(c).[23]&nbsp; Instead, after dismissing two federal claims on the merits, the\r\ndistrict court determined a third claim was not federal, declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over it, and remanded it to state court.&nbsp; Bryan\r\nII, 492 F.3d at 234-35; Bryan I, 377 F.3d at 425.&nbsp; Because the Bryan remand was not based on the lack of subject matter jurisdiction and\r\ntherefore was not made pursuant to section 1447(c), any statement in Bryan II interpreting that subsection is technically dictum.&nbsp; However, both\r\nparties have cited Bryan II as authoritative, as has the majority.&nbsp; Mindful therefore of the admonition of former Chief Judge Sanders that\r\n&quot;those who disregard dictum, either in law or in life, do so at their peril,&quot; I will give due regard to the footnote from Bryan II.&nbsp; Yeager\r\nv.

Â§ 1447(c) (West\r\n    2006), or, if the remand is based on the lack of subject-matter jurisdiction or a defect in the removal process, when the remand order is entered . .\r\n    . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nBryan II, 492 F.3d at 235 n.1 (emphasis added).&nbsp; The disjunctive word &quot;or&quot; indicates that the purpose of the footnote is to\r\ndifferentiate between the two types of remand: those made pursuant to section 1447(c) and those made for some other reason.&nbsp; In particular, the footnote\r\ndifferentiates between the points in time when each is &quot;effective&quot; to allow the state court to proceed.[24]&nbsp;\r\nCiting to section 1447(c), which applies only to remand orders such as the one in this case, the first clause states the rule that the &quot;remand is effective\r\nwhen the district court mails a certified copy of the remand order to the state court.&quot;&nbsp; The only situation in which the first clause of the footnote\r\ncan be an accurate statement of law is when the statement is made to answer the precise question we face in this appealâ€“When does federal law remove the\r\n&quot;shall proceed no further&quot; prohibition so that a state court may proceed with a case after a remand made pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1447(c)?[25]&nbsp;\r\nFinally, the text of Bryan II contains a statement that is contrary to the majority's interpretation of the footnote.&nbsp; Responding to a separate\r\nargument made by BellSouth, the court again described the point in time when the state court regained jurisdiction to proceed after the remand, and cited\r\nsection 1447(c).&nbsp; In the parenthetical after the citation in which it explained the meaning of 1447(c), the court stated &quot;providing that the state\r\ncourt may proceed with a case once the district court mails a certified copy of the remand order to the state court.&quot;&nbsp; 492 F.3d at 241.&nbsp; This is\r\nconsistent with the plain language of the statutes and refutes the majority's interpretation of the footnote.&nbsp; Therefore, I interpret the footnote to\r\ninclude in its first clause the rule applicable to the issue we face in this appeal, and thereby to support my position that the federal clerk was required to\r\nmail a certified copy of the remand order to the state court clerk before the state court had jurisdiction to proceed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\ne.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion as to Jurisdiction\r\nLimehouse argues that the result of a straightforward interpretation of sections 1446(d) and 1447(c) under the circumstances of this case &quot;makes no\r\nsense.&quot;&nbsp; The majority refers to it as &quot;jurisdictional limbo&quot; and &quot;jurisdictional hiatus.&quot;&nbsp; It is true that interpreting the\r\nstatutes according to their plain meaning creates a scenario in which for some period of time neither the federal court nor the state court had the power to\r\nact.&nbsp; In most cases, however, this period is very brief; in any case it is a situation required by the plain language of federal statutes.&nbsp; Whenever\r\nthe period becomes lengthy, as it did here, the federal court has the power to order its clerk to comply with the statute.[26]\r\nI acknowledge that the result I propose appears at first to be harsh on the facts of this case.&nbsp; However, the section 1446(d) prohibition of &quot;shall\r\nproceed no further&quot; is absolute and contemplates no exceptions, even in the face of a harsh result.&nbsp; When the Legislative branch sets forth plain and\r\nunambiguous language in a statute, the Judicial branch is constrained to follow it.&nbsp; If the results are harsh, the Legislature may change the statute but\r\nthe courts may not.[27]&nbsp; However, the result I would reach is not harsh, nor even unfair.&nbsp; Limehouse's\r\nmotion to remand to state court cites 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1447(c) in its first sentence.&nbsp; Presumably his lawyers read the subsection, in which the requirement of\r\nmailing a certified copy of the remand order is plainly and unambiguously stated.&nbsp; Having cited the subsection to his advantage, it is not at all unfair\r\nthat Limehouse be bound by the subsection when its plain terms work to his disadvantage.\r\nIn summary, the following rules apply to remand in the Fourth Circuit.&nbsp; A remand order based on some ground other than a lack of subject matter\r\njurisdiction or a defect in the removal procedure, such as the decision not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction in Bryan, is reviewable, but the remand\r\nis effective allowing the state court to proceed as soon as the order is entered.&nbsp; On the other hand, a remand order which is based on a lack of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction, such as the order in this case and in Lowe, is unreviewable as soon as it is entered.&nbsp; However, this type of remand is\r\neffective such that the state court may proceed only after the federal clerk has complied with 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1447(c) by mailing a certified copy of the remand\r\norder to the state court clerk.&nbsp; Because the federal clerk never complied with this requirement, the case was never &quot;remanded,&quot; the state court\r\nhad no power to proceed, and the resulting judgment entered in violation of federal law is void.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rule 55(c)\r\nHulsey moved for relief from default, which the trial court denied in an order filed February 7, 2007.&nbsp; In the subsequent decision of Sundown\r\nOperating Co. v. Intedge Industries, Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 681 S.E.2d 885 (2009), our supreme court explained how the reasons for the default are to be\r\nanalyzed in determining the existence of &quot;good cause&quot; under Rule 55(c).&nbsp; In light of Sundown, the analysis used by the trial court was\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.&nbsp; I would remand to the circuit court to reconsider the question of good cause under the standard set forth in Sundown.&nbsp;\r\na.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Good Cause under Rule 55(c) before Sundown\r\nOur appellate courts have stated that Rule 55(c) is to be liberally construed to promote justice and dispose of cases on the merits.&nbsp; See, e.g., In\r\nre Moore, 342 S.C. 1, 5 n.7, 536 S.E.2d 367, 369 n.7 (2000); Melton v. Olenik, 379 S.C. 45, 54, 664 S.E.2d 487, 492 (Ct. App. 2008).&nbsp; In\r\naddition to this general guidance, our appellate courts have consistently listed three factors, which have become known as the Wham factors, that a trial\r\ncourt should consider in deciding whether good cause exists.&nbsp; See Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 501-02\r\n(Ct. App. 1989).&nbsp; These factors, (1) the timing of the defendant's motion for relief, (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense, and (3) the\r\ndegree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted, have been cited as the only factors to be considered in almost every opinion since Wham\r\naddressing good cause under Rule 55(c).&nbsp; See, e.g., Richardson v. P.V., Inc., 383 S.C. 610, 616, 682 S.E.2d 263, 266 (2009) (decided after Sundown);\r\nMelton, 379 S.C. at 55, 664 S.E.2d at 492.\r\nNeither the general guidance to liberally construe Rule 55(c) in order to promote justice and dispose of cases on the merits nor the Wham factors\r\ninstruct a trial court to require, or even to consider, the reason the party went into default.&nbsp; Nevertheless, trial courts and practicing lawyers have\r\nbeen generally aware that some explanation for the default is important to the analysis of good cause under Rule 55(c).&nbsp; In fact, in New Hampshire\r\nInsurance Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 435 S.E.2d 377 (Ct. App. 1993), this court quoted Dean Lightsey and Professor Flanagan in listing four factors\r\n&quot;relevant under&quot; Rule 55(c), including &quot;the reasons for the failure to act promptly.&quot;&nbsp; 312 S.C. at 50, 435 S.E.2d at 379 (quoting Harry\r\nM. Lightsey &amp; James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 82 (1985)).&nbsp; Until Sundown, Bey Corp. was the only South Carolina\r\nappellate decision interpreting Rule 55(c) to have addressed the reasons for the default.&nbsp; However, other than to state it is a relevant factor, Bey\r\nCorp. gives no explanation as to how this fits into the analysis of good cause.\r\nTherefore, at the time of the hearing and order on Hulsey's motion for relief from default, South Carolina law provided that the party seeking relief from\r\nthe default must show good cause, and that in deciding the motion the judge should consider four relevant factors in light of the general guidance that Rule\r\n55(c) is to be liberally construed to promote justice and dispose of cases on the merits.&nbsp; The factors were (1) the timing of the defendant's motion for\r\nrelief, (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense, (3) the degree of prejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted, and (4) the reasons for the\r\nfailure to act promptly.\r\nb.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Impact of Sundown\r\nIn Sundown, the supreme court began its analysis by discussing the reasons for the default.&nbsp; However, the Sundown court elevated that\r\nfactor to a requirement, stating that the good cause standard &quot;requires a party seeking relief from an entry of default under Rule 55(c) to provide\r\nan explanation for the default.&quot;&nbsp; 383 S.C. at 607, 681 S.E.2d at 888.&nbsp; The court went even further and also required that the moving party\r\n&quot;give reasons why vacation of the default entry would serve the interests of justice.&quot;&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Thus, the standard of good cause is now\r\ninterpreted in two ways that are different from the law available to the trial court.&nbsp; First, the reason for the default is no longer merely a factor to be\r\nconsidered.&nbsp; Rather, the party seeking relief from default is required &quot;to provide an explanation for the default.&quot;&nbsp; Second, the party\r\nseeking relief must give &quot;reasons why vacation of the default would serve the interests of justice.&quot;&nbsp; The circuit court must consider all of this\r\nin determining whether or not the explanation for the default is satisfactory.[28]\r\nc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Sundown Analysis Applied to These Facts\r\nIn this case, Hulsey has complied with the requirement of providing an explanation for the default: an attorney miscalculated the due date of the\r\nanswer.&nbsp; The next question posed by Sundown was never considered by the trial court.&nbsp; Instead of considering whether vacating the default would\r\nserve the interests of justice, the trial court focused on whether the explanation was reasonable.&nbsp; The court found &quot;no good reason&quot; was\r\npresented.&nbsp; It also stated that there was &quot;no reasonable basis&quot; for the &quot;assumption that the 30 day time to file an answer starts completely\r\nanew upon remand.&quot; (emphasis omitted).&nbsp; At one point the trial court called this &quot;confusion.&quot;&nbsp; The reasonableness of the explanation is\r\ncertainly a valid factor to consider.&nbsp; However, Sundown requires a broader inquiry, namely that the reasonableness of the explanation be considered\r\nas a part of the analysis of whether vacating the default would serve the interests of justice.\r\nThe facts of this case demonstrate the importance of the broader inquiry.&nbsp; The conduct of the lawyer in this case was not &quot;reasonable.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nFirst, he should have filed an answer in federal court before the remand order was entered.&nbsp; See Rule 81(c)(2), FRCP.&nbsp; Second, when he learned\r\nof the remand order, he should have raced to the county courthouse to file it.&nbsp; A trial judge must consider the attorney's unreasonable failure to do\r\nthis.&nbsp; However, as to the specific question of whether excusing the unreasonable failure in this case serves the interests of justice, there are additional\r\nfactors that are important to consider.&nbsp; First, the lawyer was apparently attempting to correctly calculate the deadline for his answer.&nbsp; Second,\r\nSouth Carolina law provides no guidance as to when the answer was actually due in state court.&nbsp; Even the majority declines to define the due date for the\r\nanswer, stating only that Hulsey failed to meet it, whatever it was.\r\nThe fact that the lawyer was trying to correctly follow the rules is particularly relevant to &quot;the interests of justice.&quot;&nbsp; Many of our\r\nappellate decisions have stated the principle that a lawyer's negligence in failing to file an answer is imputable to the defaulting litigant, and thus weighs\r\nagainst granting relief from default.&nbsp; See generally Richardson, 383 S.C. at 618-19, 682 S.E.2d at 267.&nbsp; In each of the cases citing\r\nthis principle, the negligence was in failing to attempt to answer the complaint, not in failing at an attempt to serve a timely answer.&nbsp;\r\nThis distinction is important to the interests of justice.&nbsp; Justice should not relieve a lawyer or litigant who makes no attempt to comply with the rules,\r\nor who negligently fails to comply with a rule that is clear.&nbsp; However, the interests of justice should protect a lawyer who attempts to comply with the\r\nrules, particularly when the lawyer is attempting to meet a deadline which is so unclear that no rule or court has ever defined it.\r\nIn my opinion, applying the newly-defined standard for good cause under Sundown is likely to yield a different result.&nbsp; In reaching this\r\nconclusion, I am influenced by the reasoning of our supreme court in affirming the trial court's order granting relief for a late answer in Lee v. Peek,\r\n240 S.C. 203, 125 S.E.2d 353 (1962).&nbsp; Though Lee is not controlling because it was decided before the Rules of Civil Procedure based on a standard\r\nother than good cause, the facts of Lee are strikingly similar to the facts presented here, and the court's analysis seems particularly relevant in light\r\nof Sundown.\r\nDavis Lee sued the NAACP and six residents of Anderson County in the Court of Common Pleas of Abbeville County.&nbsp; 240 S.C. at 204, 125 S.E.2d at\r\n353.&nbsp; Three of the Anderson County residents retained a lawyer, who made a motion to change venue to Anderson.&nbsp; 240 S.C. at 205, 125 S.E.2d at\r\n353.&nbsp; Before the motion to change venue could be heard, the NAACP removed the case to federal court.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The three Anderson residents\r\nrepresented by the lawyer filed a motion to remand, which was granted.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; The same attorney then refiled the motion to change venue.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nDuring all of this time, the lawyer did not file an answer because &quot;he was under the erroneous impression that it was not necessary for him to answer or\r\ndemur in the State Court until the motion for change of venue had been decided.&quot;&nbsp; 240 S.C. at 205, 125 S.E.2d at 354.\r\nThe Lee attorney's failure to answer was unreasonable.&nbsp; The circuit judge &quot;found as a matter of fact that counsel had misconceived the\r\napplicable procedural law.&quot;&nbsp; 240 S.C. at 206, 125 S.E.2d at 354.&nbsp; That finding is much like that of the trial court here that &quot;there was no\r\ngood reason presented by the defendants for their failure to file a timely answer, other than attorney confusion about the deadline for when an answer was\r\ndue.&quot;&nbsp; However, the trial judge in Lee did not focus on the reasonableness of the lawyer's action.&nbsp; Rather, focusing on what the Sundown\r\ncourt has now instructed trial courts to consider, the circuit judge in Lee held &quot;that it was in the furtherance of justice that the\r\nrespondents be relieved of any default.&quot;&nbsp; Id. (emphasis added).\r\nd.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Conclusion as to Rule 55(c)\r\nSundown changed the analysis of good cause by requiring for the first time that the trial court focus on &quot;reasons why vacation of the default\r\nentry would serve the interests of justice.&quot;&nbsp; I believe that if the trial court had analyzed this question, rather than whether the attorney was\r\nreasonable in failing to file a timely answer, the outcome might have been different.&nbsp; The supreme court recognized in Lee that the decision as to\r\nwhat is &quot;in the furtherance of justice&quot; is for the circuit court.&nbsp; It is not the task of this court to answer the question posed by Sundown.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, it is the duty of this court to see that the question gets answered.&nbsp; I would reverse the judgment of the lower court, and remand the case for a\r\ndetermination of whether good cause exists under Sundown.\r\n\r\n[1] Tony Soprano is a fictional television character involved in organized crime.&nbsp;\r\n[2]&nbsp; Hulsey did not answer the complaint in federal court.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The essence of our inquiry, as opposed to the federal court, is not whether the federal scheme provides\r\nfor state court jurisdiction, but rather, whether it prohibits state court jurisdiction.&nbsp; See infra.&nbsp; Naturally, because a federal court\r\ndoes not determine state court jurisdiction, this distinction allays the dissent's concern that the question confronted in Lowe is different than the one\r\nwe face here.\r\n[4]&nbsp; We do not rely on Bryan as dispositive of this case, nor do we find any reason to interpret this\r\npurely explanatory note â€“ which specifically cites Lowe â€“ to imply that Lowe does not stand for what it explicitly holds, i.e., a federal\r\ncourt loses jurisdiction upon entry of a remand for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nAlthough the dissent agrees the note is purely dicta, to the extent it is suggested the footnote bears on this matter, we note that the dissenting opinion\r\nignores the second clause of the note, in which the Fourth Circuit reiterates the Lowe holding; presumably because its interpretation of the first clause\r\nis irreconcilable with Lowe.&nbsp; Further, the interpretation of the first clause is premised on a presumption, allegedly from Bryan, that\r\nremands for reasons other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defect in removal are not subject to section 1447(c).&nbsp; However, neither the Fourth\r\nCircuit, nor any other circuit, has put forth such a ruling, and Bryan itself refutes this presumption by recognizing, in a case in which the remand was\r\nbased upon a reason other than lack of subject matter jurisdiction or defect in removal, that the state court could continue upon receipt of the\r\ncertified mailing, citing section 1447(c). &nbsp;See Bryan, 492 F.3d at 241.&nbsp;\r\n[5] &nbsp;The exercise of mandamus power is, by its very nature, not an exercise of the court's jurisdiction over\r\nthe case and controversy.&nbsp;\r\n[6]&nbsp; For this reason, we disagree with the dissent's indication that we must interpret section 1447(c), as to\r\ndo so in light of Lowe's interpretation of when federal jurisdiction ends under that section, we must invariably presume that our jurisdiction is derived\r\nfrom that federal statute rather than limited by it.\r\n[7]&nbsp; We are aware of no jurisdiction that has taken the position that neither the state nor federal court has\r\njurisdiction over a case.&nbsp; Further, it is not inconsistent with our federalist form of government to allow a state court to exercise its general\r\njurisdiction when a federal court has finally decided its Congressionally authorized jurisdiction has ceased.&nbsp; See Lowe, 102 F.3d at 735\r\n(&quot;Removal in diversity cases, to the prejudice of state court jurisdiction, is a privilege to be strictly construed[.]&quot;) (quoting In re La\r\nProvidencia Dev. Corp., 406 F.2d 251, 252 (1st Cir. 1969).\r\n[8] &nbsp;This statement recognizes that a state court, as opposed to a federal court, confronts whether the\r\nexercise of jurisdiction is prohibited by federal statute, not proscribed by it.&nbsp; Similarly it undermines the notion that the statement in section 1447(c):\r\nthat once a certified copy is mailed &quot;[t]he State court may thereupon proceed,&quot; operates as an absolute prohibition on state action.&nbsp;\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n[9] &nbsp;The dissent posits that our distinction between a jurisdictional requirement and a procedural one is\r\nirrelevant and that we erroneously suggest the issue is not preserved for appeal because it was not raised before the judgment was entered.&nbsp; To the\r\ncontrary, it is precisely because of the rules of issue preservation that the distinction is not only relevant but imperative.&nbsp; The only question we\r\nconfront in this case is whether the action of the trial court is void for lack of jurisdiction, which can be raised at any time.&nbsp; However, the\r\ndissent elects not to squarely answer this question, instead finding the judgment void because the trial court lacked the &quot;power to proceed&quot; with the\r\ncase under the federal statute.&nbsp; Because it is the only issue before this court, we must presume that this alleged powerlessness is due to a lack of\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; To the extent the dissent suggests the circuit court is powerless to proceed for any reason other than a lack of subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction, the issue is not properly before this court.&nbsp; Further, the dissent's analogy to the bankruptcy code is misplaced.&nbsp;\r\nNotwithstanding the manifest dissimilarities between the realm of bankruptcy law and this case, the federal jurisdictional statutes at issue here do not provide\r\nfor a stay.&nbsp; The concept is also not analogous to this case as a stay, by definition and nature, operates only as a suspension of jurisdiction, not a\r\ntermination.&nbsp; Contra Davis, 267 S.C. at 511, 229 S.E.2d at 848 (&quot;[O]nce removal proceedings to federal court are fulfilled and requisite\r\nnotice accomplished, the State court loses all jurisdiction in the matter.&quot;).\r\n[10]&nbsp; Respectfully, we disagree with the dissent's &quot;summary of the rules that apply to remand in the\r\nFourth Circuit.&quot;&nbsp; We find these conclusions irreconcilable with the holding of Lowe and contrary to the expressed rational of both Lowe\r\nand Bryan.&nbsp; Similarly, we find these rules to be contrary to the reasoning and holdings of the state courts that have confronted the issue.&nbsp;\r\nFinally, from a practical perspective, we find the summary illogical as it proposes to create (1) a scenario in which a state court is permitted to resume\r\naction on a case even though the remand order is appealable and remains subject to the federal court's jurisdiction, and (2) a scenario that denies a state\r\ncourt jurisdiction over a matter in which federal jurisdiction has been terminated, and a final and unappealable order has been issued.&nbsp;\r\n[11]&nbsp; Hulsey avers jurisdiction has not yet revested in the state court and maintains this as an\r\nalternative position.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n[12]&nbsp; This amounted to sixteen days after the remand because fourteen days had elapsed prior to\r\nremoval.&nbsp;\r\n[13]&nbsp; The inquiry of whether failure to comply with Rule 81(c)(2), FRCP, would support entry of default in\r\nstate court if the case is remanded unanswered appears novel in this state.&nbsp; However, we need not address it.\r\n[14]&nbsp; Although the South Carolina Supreme Court decided this case during the pendency of this appeal,\r\nHulsey notified this court via writing of the intent to rely on this authority.\r\n[15]&nbsp; Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., 298 S.C. 462, 465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 502 (Ct. App. 1989).\r\n[16]&nbsp; As our colleague in the dissent points out and the trial court's ruling indicates: in practice, both\r\nthe bench and bar have been aware that the explanation for the default is significant.&nbsp; See New Hampshire Ins. Co. v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47,\r\n50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 1993) (indicating the reason for failure to act is relevant under a Rule 55(c) analysis).&nbsp;\r\n[17]&nbsp; We recognize the dissent's position that reasonableness is not required of the excuse itself but\r\nmerely a factor to be considered in a &quot;broader inquiry&quot; of whether the vacation serves the interests of justice.&nbsp; While this is certainly a mode\r\nof analysis within the trial court's discretion, in light of our standard of review, whether the trial court finds vacation does not serve an interest of\r\njustice because the excuse is unreasonable or finds the excuse is unreasonable because vacation does not serve an interest of justice, so long as supported by\r\nthe evidence, is a distinction without a consequence.&nbsp;\r\n[18] Notwithstanding, we respectfully disagree that good cause likely existed in this case.&nbsp; Hulsey's\r\ncontempt for the rules of procedure both in federal court and state court, indicates this was not a &quot;failure at an attempt&quot; but rather a &quot;failure\r\nto attempt&quot; an answer. &nbsp;&nbsp;This issue would not have arisen had the rules been followed.&nbsp; Thus, we suggest there is ample &quot;guidance&quot;\r\nfor Hulsey to know a party is not entitled to 130 days to answer.\r\n[19]&nbsp; Hulsey cites Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333-34 (1976), for the proposition that due\r\nprocess requires a meaningful opportunity to be heard.&nbsp; Hulsey also cites to two appellate decisions from the foreign jurisdictions of Florida and North\r\nCarolina to support his argument to change the default damages procedure in South Carolina, specifically as to punitive damages.&nbsp;\r\n[20]&nbsp; The trial court specifically noted the statements were intentionally made, the award would deter\r\nsimilar conduct in the future, the award was just over twice actual damages and was thus reasonably related to the actual harm suffered.&nbsp; The trial court\r\nalso noted Hulsey was of the rare few who can afford to pay the award, and although South Carolina's procedure did not permit Hulsey to put forth evidence, the\r\nverdict remained reasonable.&nbsp;\r\n[21] Section 1447(c) states: &quot;If at any time before final judgment it appears that the district court lacks\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction, the case shall be remanded.&quot;\r\n[22] The first opinion was Bryan v. BellSouth Communications, Inc., 377 F.3d 424 (4th. Cir. 2004) (Bryan\r\nI).\r\n[23] Section 1447(c) applies to remands on the basis of a lack of subject matter jurisdiction or a defect in the\r\nremoval procedure.&nbsp; As the Fourth Circuit pointed out in Bryan I, the district court &quot;concluded that removal was proper because Bryan presented\r\na federal question.&quot;&nbsp; 377 F.3d at 427.&nbsp; The Fourth Circuit's decision in Bryan I demonstrates that it agreed.&nbsp; &quot;On appeal, we\r\nheld that the remanded claim was a federal claim . . . .&quot;&nbsp; Bryan II, 492 F.3d at 234 (citing Bryan I, 377 F.3d at 432).&nbsp; Because\r\nthe federal court had subject matter jurisdiction over the federal claims, the remand was not made pursuant to section 1447(c).\r\n[24] The court makes this differentiation in order to explain how the remanded state court proceedings and the\r\nappeal of the remand order to the Fourth Circuit could proceed simultaneously.&nbsp; 492 F.3d at 235.&nbsp; In fact, the footnote appears at the end of this\r\nsentence in the text of the opinion: &quot;While BellSouth's appeal was pending, Count A, which had been remanded to state court by the district court, was\r\nproceeding in state court.&quot;&nbsp; Id.\r\n[25] It is not possible to interpret the clause to apply to anything other than a section 1447(c) remand, not\r\nonly because the clause cites to the section, but also because the mailing referred to is not required except when the remand is made pursuant to section\r\n1447(c).&nbsp;\r\n[26] While the federal court's remand order becomes final and unreviewable upon its filing, that event does not\r\ndeprive the federal court of the power to order its clerk to complete the ministerial task of mailing a certified copy of the order to the state court\r\nclerk.&nbsp; See Peacock v. Thomas, 516 U.S. 349, 354 (1996) (&quot;[A] federal court may exercise ancillary jurisdiction . . . to enable a court\r\nto function successfully, that is, to manage its proceedings, vindicate its authority, and effectuate its decrees.&quot;).&nbsp; As a practical matter, an\r\ninformal reminder to the federal clerk that a certified copy of the order had not been mailed would almost certainly have solved the problem.&nbsp; As a\r\ntechnical matter, the district court has mandamus power to compel its clerk to complete this ministerial task.&nbsp; This is, in fact, exactly what happened in Lowe.&nbsp;\r\nAfter the district court concluded there was no federal subject matter jurisdiction, the Fourth Circuit granted a writ of mandamus with instructions that the\r\ndistrict court return the case to state court.&nbsp; 102 F.3d at 736.&nbsp; Given the substance of the Fourth Circuit's ruling that the district court's order\r\nremanding the case was unreviewable upon filing, the only task left to complete at that point was the ministerial task of sending a certified copy of the remand\r\norder to the state clerk.\r\n[27] Neither Limehouse nor the majority contends this is a situation in which the court may ignore a statute's\r\nplain meaning because to do so would yield an absurd result.&nbsp; See Harris v.

Lee, III, of Columbia, for\r\n          Appellant.\r\n        Victoria L. Eslinger and Russell T. Burke,\r\n          both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS, J.: William James Biggins filed this action seeking to\r\n  terminate alimony payments to his ex-wife, Karen Lee Burdette, based on\r\n  Burdette's relationship with a paramour.Â  The family court denied Biggins motion\r\n  to terminate and awarded Burdette attorney's fees of approximately $126,000.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nBiggins and Burdette were\r\n  divorced in December 2004 after a twenty-seven-year marriage on the grounds of\r\n  Husband's adultery.Â  Burdette admittedly began having a sexual relationship\r\n  with a man (Boyfriend) in June of 2005.Â  According to Burdette's testimony, she\r\n  kept her relationship with Boyfriend a secret because she did not want an\r\n  elderly aunt who lived in the same neighborhood or her daughter to be aware of\r\n  her and Boyfriend's spending the night together.Â  Generally, Burdette picked\r\n  Boyfriend up in her vehicle, brought him to her home, and returned him to his\r\n  residence the following morning if they spent the night together.Â  Burdette and\r\n  Boyfriend testified they spent approximately sixty nights together during their\r\n  relationship which ended in September of the same year.Â  Burdette testified\r\n  regarding several occasions she and Boyfriend spent the night apart including a\r\n  time when her son and his family came to visit, when she went out of town to\r\n  care for her ailing mother, when her aunt came to visit, when her daughter\r\n  visited, and when her former mother-in-law came to visit.Â  Burdette and\r\n  Boyfriend testified they did not reside together.Â  According to Burdette and\r\n  Boyfriend, with the exception of a few toiletries and items of clothing,\r\n  Boyfriend did not keep his belongings at her home, and he only had a\r\n  substantial amount of clothing at her home on the few occasions he did laundry\r\n  there.Â  \r\nThe deposition testimony of\r\n  Boyfriend's roommate, Danny McCaskill, was admitted at trial over Burdette's\r\n  hearsay objection.Â  Casting some doubt on the veracity of Burdette's and\r\n  Boyfriend's testimonies, McCaskill testified to coming home and finding\r\n  Boyfriend's &quot;clothes and luggage and things of that nature&quot; on the\r\n  couch.Â  McCaskill asked Boyfriend if &quot;Karen [Burdette] kicked [him]\r\n  out&quot; and Boyfriend responded she didn't want his belongings at her house\r\n  when she had guests visiting.Â  \r\nBiggins had Burdette followed\r\n  by three private investigators.Â  Paul Blackburn testified he conducted\r\n  surveillance on Burdette and Boyfriend on twelve occasions from June 7, 2005\r\n  through August 24, 2005.Â  He observed Boyfriend leaving Burdette's home on the\r\n  morning of June 14 and observed Boyfriend and Burdette leave her residence\r\n  together in the morning four other times.Â  David Vinson testified he observed\r\n  Burdette and Boyfriend on seventeen occasions and saw them together leaving her\r\n  home seven times.Â  Brian Stillinger testified he conducted surveillance on\r\n  Burdette's home twenty-six times and observed her and Boyfriend together in the\r\n  morning nine times.Â  \r\nThe family court determined\r\n  Boyfriend and Burdette did not continually cohabitate as contemplated by\r\n  section 20-3-130 of the South Carolina Code.Â  The family court noted the pair\r\n  spent no more than sixty to seventy-two nights together, although they may have\r\n  been in a relationship for more than ninety days, and those nights were not\r\n  consecutive.Â  The family court also noted Boyfriend maintained his own\r\n  residence during the relationship and did not receive mail at Burdette's home\r\n  or use that as his address.Â  The family court concluded the pair had not\r\n  continually cohabitated and separated only to circumvent the statute but had\r\n  lived apart and met for romantic rendezvous.Â  The family court awarded Burdette\r\n  attorney's fees in the amount of $126,797.30.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Continued\r\n  Cohabitation\r\nBiggins argues the family\r\n  court erred in finding Burdette and Boyfriend did not continually cohabitate so\r\n  as to warrant termination of alimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nPayment of permanent,\r\n  periodic alimony by a payor spouse will terminate &quot;upon the remarriage or\r\n  continued cohabitation of the supported spouse . . . .&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-3-150 (Supp. 2010).Â  According to statute, continued cohabitation occurs\r\n  when &quot;the supported spouse resides with another person in a romantic\r\n  relationship for a period of ninety or more consecutive days.&quot;Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-150(B).Â  The family court can terminate alimony if it determines\r\n  the supported spouse was cohabitating with someone in a romantic relationship\r\n  for less than ninety days if the pair separated periodically for purposes of\r\n  circumventing the ninety-day requirement.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme\r\n  Court discussed and defined &quot;continued cohabitation&quot; in Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007).Â  &quot;We find that the phrase 'resides with' in the context of [section]\r\n  20-3-150 sets forth a requirement that the supported\r\n  spouse live under the same roof as the person with whom they are romantically\r\n  involved for at least ninety consecutive days. Â Any other interpretation\r\n  essentially takes the 'cohabitation' out of 'continued\r\n  cohabitation.'&quot;Â  Id. at 89, 650 S.E.2d\r\n  at 472.\r\nSince Strickland, the South Carolina Supreme Court and Court of Appeals have\r\n  applied the rationale in Strickland in four other cases.Â  In each case,\r\n  the moving party failed to establish the supported spouse had continually\r\n  cohabitated with another person as contemplated by the statute.Â  See Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 482, 682 S.E.2d 804, 808 (2009) (finding no bar to\r\n  alimony when ex-wife and boyfriend may have resided together for periods of two\r\n  to four weeks but never for a continuous period of ninety days); Fiddie v. Fiddie, 384 S.C. 120, 126, 681 S.E.2d 42, 45 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding\r\n  ex-wife did not continually cohabitate with a man when she lived with him\r\n  sometimes but also stayed with her sister and friend several days each month so\r\n  as to not &quot;wear out her welcome&quot;); Feldman v. Feldman, 380\r\n  S.C. 538, 544, 670 S.E.2d 669, 671-72 (Ct. App. 2008) (affirming family court's\r\n  finding of no continued cohabitation when ex-wife and boyfriend were not\r\n  observed living together for ninety days and when ex-wife's friends and family\r\n  testified she lived alone); Semken v. Semken, 379 S.C. 71, 77, 664 S.E.2d 493, 497 (Ct. App. 2008) (reversing\r\n  family court's termination of alimony because evidence did not demonstrate\r\n  ex-wife and boyfriend lived under the same roof for ninety consecutive days).\r\nThe\r\n  evidence in the record supports the family court's decision.Â Â Â  The parties\r\n  admittedly were in a romantic relationship for just over ninety days.Â  However,\r\n  that alone does not satisfy the statute.Â  According to Strickland, the\r\n  parties must &quot;live together under the same roof.&quot;Â  Burdette and\r\n  Boyfriend testified they did not intend to live together and that they did not\r\n  spend ninety consecutive nights together.Â  They further testified that\r\n  Boyfriend maintained his own residence and kept most of his personal items\r\n  there.Â  The observations of the private investigators do not refute this\r\n  testimony but merely confirm that Burdette and Boyfriend were spending the\r\n  night together at Burdette's home on a recurring basis.Â  Whether to believe the\r\n  parties' testimony is a credibility determination and we defer to the family\r\n  court's judgment in that regard.Â  See Terwilliger v. Terwilliger, 298 S.C. 144, 147, 378\r\n  S.E.2d 609, 611 (Ct. App. 1989) (&quot;Resolving questions of\r\n  credibility is a function of the family court judge who heard the\r\n  testimony.&quot;).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even if the parties did reside together for certain periods of time, according\r\n  to McCaskill's testimony, Burdette &quot;kicked him out&quot; when she had\r\n  visitors and he took all his things with him.Â  Under Eason and Fiddie,\r\n  no continued cohabitation occurs even if the parties lived together but\r\n  separated before the ninety days passed for reasons other than to circumvent\r\n  the statute.Â  The evidence shows the parties separated to protect Burdette's\r\n  reputation, not to circumvent the statute.Â  Therefore, the family court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying Biggins's motion to terminate alimony based on\r\n  continued cohabitation.\r\nII. Attorney's\r\n  Fees\r\nBiggins further argues the\r\n  family court erred in awarding attorney's fees to Burdette and in not awarding\r\n  attorney's fees to him.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n&quot;In family court, the\r\n  award of attorney's fees is left to the discretion of the judge and will only\r\n  be disturbed upon a showing of abuse of that discretion.&quot;Â  High v. High,\r\n  389 S.C. 226, 249, 697 S.E.2d 680, 702 (Ct. App. 2010).Â  \r\nFirst, Biggins maintains the\r\n  attorney's fees award to Burdette was in error because the underlying decision\r\n  regarding the termination of alimony was incorrect.Â  As we have affirmed the\r\n  family court's determination of that point, this argument is unavailing.Â \r\n  Second, Biggins argues the family court failed to make specific findings of\r\n  fact regarding each of the Glasscock[2] factors.Â  However, this issue was not raised to or ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court and is therefore not preserved for our review.Â  Smith v. Smith,\r\n  386 S.C. 251, 273, 687 S.E.2d 720, 732 (Ct. App. 2009) (stating to preserve an\r\n  issue for appellate review, it must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial\r\n  court).\r\nLastly, Biggins argues the\r\n  attorney's fees award was excessive and unduly punitive.Â  While Biggins failed\r\n  to challenge the attorney's fees affidavit presented by Burdette's counsel at\r\n  trial, he did raise a general argument in a subsequent Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion that the amount of attorney's fees was &quot;excessive under the facts\r\n  and circumstances presented.&quot;Â  Because the point is\r\n  arguably preserved, we will address it.Â  See Floyd v. Floyd, 365\r\n  S.C. 56, 73, 615 S.E.2d 465, 474 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding appellant failed to\r\n  preserve issue regarding amount of attorney's fees award when he made no\r\n  challenge to fee affidavit at hearing and did not file a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion).Â  \r\nBiggins's argument is not\r\n  based on a specific challenge to any of the Glasscock factors, which the\r\n  family court considers in awarding fees, but is based on a general theory that\r\n  Biggins had reason to believe Burdette was cohabitating with Boyfriend and was\r\n  therefore justified in bringing the action.Â  With no authority to support this\r\n  argument and because the family court's order demonstrates it considered the Glasscock factors and rendered a decision based on an unchallenged attorney's fees\r\n  affidavit, we discern no abuse of discretion in the family court's award of\r\n  attorney's fees.\r\nBased on all of the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHUFF and LOCKEMY, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Glasscock v.\r\n  Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161, 403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991), sets forth the\r\n  following factors to be considered in determining the amount of attorney's fees\r\n  to be awarded:Â  (1) the nature, extent, and\r\n  difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to the case; (3) counsel's\r\n  professional standing; (4) the contingency of compensation; (5) the beneficial results\r\n  obtained; and (5) the customary legal fees for similar services.\r\n\r\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4809","title":"Smallwood v.

Â Husband was\r\n  employed as a pastor in the Seventh Day Adventist Church (the Church) for forty-two\r\n  years before his retirement in 2006.Â  Wife was unable to work full-time after\r\n  suffering a brain hemorrhage in 1991, but held part-time jobs caring for\r\n  children and the elderly.\r\n\r\n  \r\nIn 1992, prior to the parties' marriage, Husband\r\n  purchased three rental properties located at 106 Roberta Drive, 122 Roberta\r\n  Drive, and 150 Braly Drive (the rental properties) in Summerville, South\r\n  Carolina. Â According to Husband's testimony, the rental properties were operated\r\n  under his company, Smallwood Properties, Inc., and their mortgages were paid\r\n  with rental income.[1]Â \r\n  During their marriage, Husband and Wife lived briefly in both the 106 Roberta\r\n  Drive property and the Langley Drive property, another rental property\r\n  purchased by Husband prior to the parties' marriage.[2] Â According to Wife's testimony, she assisted Husband in managing the\r\n  rental properties by cleaning, checking tenant references, filing evictions,\r\n  and handling tenant disputes until the parties moved to Charlotte, North\r\n  Carolina in 1998. Â After Husband and Wife moved to Charlotte, the rental\r\n  properties were managed by property management companies.Â  The mortgages on the\r\n  rental properties were fully paid at the time of the final hearing.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHusband had a Southern Union Revolving Fund account\r\n  (SURF account) through the Church.Â  At the time this action was filed, the SURF\r\n  account had a $28,582.63 balance and was in both Husband's and Wife's names. According\r\n  to Husband, he deposited $12,000 from the sale of the Langley property into the\r\n  SURF account during the marriage. Â Additionally, Husband deposited $60 a\r\n  month of his Church income into the account.[3] Â Husband also used funds from the SURF account to support the rental\r\n  properties. Husband testified Wife did not make any contributions to the SURF account. Â After his retirement, Husband received a $15,080 relocation benefit\r\n  from the Church. Â Husband and Wife testified this lump sum payment was\r\n  given to retiring Church pastors to assist with their relocation expenses.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn December 2005, Husband initiated this action by\r\n  petitioning the family court for an order of separate maintenance. Â In July\r\n  2008, the family court granted Husband a divorce based on one year's continuous\r\n  separation.[4] Â The family court determined the marital estate should be distributed\r\n  fifty percent to Wife and fifty percent to Husband. It valued the three rental\r\n  properties at $125,000 each and awarded Wife the 150 Braly Drive property and\r\n  Husband the 106 Roberta Drive property.Â  The family court determined the\r\n  remaining rental property, 122 Roberta Drive, was to be included in the\r\n  equitable distribution of the marital assets.Â  The family court also found the\r\n  SURF account and thirty-one percent, or $4,674.80, of Husband's $15,080 relocation\r\n  benefit were marital assets. Â Additionally, the family court awarded Wife permanent,\r\n  periodic alimony and attorney's fees. Â Husband's motion for\r\n  reconsideration was denied.Â  This appeal followed.Â \r\n  STANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\n  In appeals from the family court this court has the authority to find\r\n    facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Wooten\r\n      v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102&nbsp;(2005).Â  Despite this\r\n    broad scope of review, this court is not required to disregard the findings of\r\n    the family court.Â  Id.Â  We are mindful that the family court, who saw\r\n    and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility\r\n    and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Id.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Rental Properties\r\n  Husband argues the family court erred in including the rental\r\n    properties in the marital estate. Â Specifically, Husband maintains he purchased\r\n    the rental properties prior to the parties' marriage and they were never\r\n    transmuted into marital property.Â  We agree.Â  The family court determined that although Husband made the down\r\n    payments on the rental properties prior to the parties' marriage, they were\r\n    transmuted into marital property &quot;by virtue of the intention of the\r\n    parties as expressed in their actions.&quot;Â  The family court found Wife was a\r\n    manager of the rental properties and commingled funds were used to support the\r\n    rental properties. The family court noted Husband and Wife lived in the 106\r\n    Roberta Drive and the Langley Drive properties during their marriage and the\r\n    properties were paid in full during the marriage from rental income, the parties'\r\n    jointly titled bank account, and Husband's earnings during the marriage.Â  The\r\n    family court also found the insurance bill for the 106 Roberta Drive property\r\n    was held in the name of both parties.Â  Husband argues the rental income from the properties was deposited into\r\n    his Smallwood Properties account and no marital funds were used to support the rental\r\n    properties. Â Husband also maintains the mortgages on the rental\r\n    properties were paid with rental income. Â Husband acknowledges Wife assisted\r\n    with the rental properties by painting, cleaning, and taking lease\r\n    applications; however, he contends the rental properties were not transmuted\r\n    into marital property because he never intended to treat them as marital\r\n    property.Â  Wife contends the rental properties were transmuted into marital\r\n    property. Â She argues the record contains no evidence Husband intended\r\n    to treat the rental properties as non-marital, and Husband failed to identify\r\n    the account in which he deposited the rental income prior to 2005. Â Wife also\r\n    argues she assisted Husband with managing the rental properties, and marital\r\n    funds were used to pay the debt on the rental properties.Â  &quot;Transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts\r\n    of each case.&quot;Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545 S.E.2d\r\n    531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  &quot;The spouse claiming transmutation must produce\r\n    objective evidence showing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves\r\n    regarded the property as the common property of the marriage.&quot;Â  Johnson\r\n      v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110-11 (Ct. App. 1988). &quot;Such\r\n    evidence may include placing the property in joint names, transferring the\r\n    property to the other spouse as a gift, using the property exclusively for\r\n    marital purposes, commingling the property with marital property, using marital\r\n    funds to build equity in the property, or exchanging the property for marital\r\n    property.&quot; Â Id.at 295, 372\r\n    S.E.2d at 111.Â  &quot;The mere use of separate property to support the\r\n    marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to treat it as property of\r\n    the marriage, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.&quot;Â  Id. at\r\n    295-96, 372 S.E.2d at 111. We find the family court erred in determining the rental properties\r\n    were transmuted into marital property. Wife failed to carry her burden of\r\n    producing objective evidence showing Husband regarded the rental properties as\r\n    the common property of the marriage. Â Husband purchased the rental properties\r\n    prior to parties' marriage and testified at trial they were his property and\r\n    did not belong to Wife. The record contains no evidence Husband ever placed the\r\n    rental properties in Wife's name or transferred the properties to Wife as a\r\n    gift. Â Although Husband and Wife lived in the 106 Roberta Drive property for\r\n    several months at the beginning of their marriage, Wife failed to present any evidence\r\n    Husband intended to treat that property, or any of the other rental properties,\r\n    as marital.Â  See id. (holding &quot;the mere use of separate\r\n    property to support the marriage, without some additional evidence of intent to\r\n    treat it as property of the marriage, is not sufficient to establish\r\n    transmutation&quot;).Â  Furthermore, we do not agree with Wife's argument that the assistance\r\n    she provided Husband in managing the rental properties was evidence of the\r\n    parties' intent to treat the properties as marital. According to Wife's\r\n    testimony, she helped manage the rental properties by cleaning and handling\r\n    tenant matters until the parties moved to Charlotte in 1998.Â  However, Husband\r\n    testified Wife only assisted him for a few months after they married and before\r\n    she returned to work. Â Thereafter, according to Husband, he employed other\r\n    individuals and property management companies to manage the rental properties. Â After\r\n    1998, the rental properties were managed by property management companies.Â  While\r\n    we recognize Wife's contributions of time and labor during the parties first\r\n    five years of marriage, they are insufficient to prove transmutation.Â SeeMurray\r\n      v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 158, 439\r\n    S.E.2d 312, 315 (Ct. App. 1993) (holding Wife's contributions of time and labor\r\n    in maintaining the marital home and rental properties did not prove\r\n    transmutation).Additionally, the record included no evidence Husband commingled the\r\n    rental properties with marital property, used the rental properties exclusively\r\n    for marital purposes, or used marital funds to build equity in the rental properties.Â \r\n    Husband testified he paid the mortgages on the rental properties with rental\r\n    income. Â No evidence is in the record that marital funds were ever used to pay\r\n    the mortgages. Husband also testified property management companies deposited the\r\n    income from the rental properties into his Smallwood Properties bank account. Â The\r\n    record does not reflect that rental income was ever deposited into the parties'\r\n    joint bank accounts.Â  Furthermore, Husband's admission he used funds from the\r\n    parties' joint SURF account to support his business is insufficient evidence of\r\n    intent to treat the rental properties as marital. Â Husband did not\r\n    testify as to how much money was used from the SURF account or how the money\r\n    was used to support the rental properties. Â Thus, based on the preponderance of\r\n    the evidence, we find Husband did not intend to treat the rental properties as\r\n    marital property, and, therefore, they were not transmuted. Accordingly, we reverse\r\n    the family court's determination that the rental properties were transmuted\r\n    into marital property and subject to equitable distribution.\r\n    II. SURF Account\r\n    Husband argues the family court erred in equitably dividing the\r\n    proceeds of the SURF account. Â We disagree.The SURF account was valued at $28,582.62 at the time of the divorce.Â \r\n    The family court determined the SURF account was marital property and, as part\r\n    of the equitable distribution of the marital estate, Husband and Wife were each\r\n    entitled to $14,291.31. Â Husband argues the SURF account was non-marital\r\n    property and was never transmuted into marital property.Â  He asserts the SURF\r\n    account was funded primarily with the proceeds from the sale of the Langley Drive\r\n    property, which he maintains was non-marital. Â Husband also contends he never\r\n    expressed any intent to treat the SURF account as marital property and Wife did\r\n    not make any contributions to the account.Â  Husband acknowledges the $60 a\r\n    month he deposited into the SURF account through payroll deduction could be\r\n    considered marital property.Wife argues the SURF account was transmuted into marital property. She\r\n    asserts the SURF account was jointly titled and contained funds deposited by\r\n    Husband during the marriage commingled with Husband's salary. Wife contends\r\n    that while Husband maintains he deposited the proceeds from the sale of the\r\n    Langley Drive property into the account, he failed to produce any evidence the\r\n    funds he deposited were non-marital.Â  We find the family court properly determined the SURF account was\r\n    marital property.Â  Pursuant to section 20-3-630(A) of the South Carolina Code\r\n    (Supp. 2010), &quot;marital property&quot; is &quot;all real and personal\r\n    property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which\r\n    is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation . . . Â regardless\r\n    of how legal title is held . . . Â .&quot; Â At trial, Husband acknowledged the\r\n    money held in the jointly titled SURF account was acquired during the parties' marriage.\r\n    Â Â Husband testified he deposited $60 a month of his salary as well as the\r\n    proceeds from the sale of the Langley Drive property into the account. Â Â Furthermore,\r\n    the record contains evidence of the parties' intent to treat the SURF account\r\n    as marital property. Â Both parties testified the SURF account was used to save\r\n    money for the parties' trip to Hawaii. Â Husband also testified he made\r\n    investments in his and Wife's names using funds from the SURF account. Â Accordingly,\r\n    we affirm the family court's determination that the SURF account was marital\r\n    property subject to equitable distribution.[5]\r\nIII.&nbsp; Relocation Benefit \r\n  \r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding a\r\n  portion of the $15,080 relocation benefit he received after his retirement from\r\n  the Church was marital property.Â  Specifically, Husband argues the relocation\r\n  benefit was non-marital property because it was not part of his retirement pay\r\n  and he received it after the divorce proceeding was commenced. Â This argument\r\n  is not preserved for our review.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt trial, Husband argued a portion of the relocation\r\n  benefit was marital property subject to equitable distribution. Husband\r\n  testified the relocation benefit was &quot;based on [forty-two] years of\r\n  service&quot; to the Church and Wife was entitled to an equitable share based\r\n  on the length of the parties' marriage.Â  Husband even attempted to submit his\r\n  own calculations of Wife's share based on the parties' thirteen-year marriage\r\n  to the court. Â The family court agreed with Husband that Wife was\r\n  entitled to a portion of the relocation benefit. Â It determined, based on the\r\n  parties' thirteen-year marriage, thirty-one percent of the relocation benefit\r\n  was marital property subject to equitable distribution.Â \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn his Rule 59(e), SCRCP motion, Husband raised for\r\n  the first time his argument that Wife was not entitled to a portion of the\r\n  relocation benefit. Â Â Husband asserted the benefit was given to him\r\n  &quot;for purposes of relocating upon his retirement&quot; and therefore it\r\n  &quot;should not be part of the marital estate.&quot;Â  Furthermore, on appeal,\r\n  Husband contends Wife was not entitled to a portion of the benefit because it\r\n  was not considered part of his retirement pay and he received it after the divorce\r\n  proceeding was commenced.Â  Because Husband failed to raise the argument that\r\n  the relocation benefit was non-marital property at trial, it is not preserved\r\n  for our review.Â  See Hickman v. Hickman, 301 S.C. 455, 456, 392 S.E.2d\r\n  481, 482 (Ct. App. 1990)&nbsp;(&quot;A party cannot use Rule 59(e) to present\r\n  to the court an issue the party could have raised prior to judgment but did\r\n  not.&quot;); see also Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 399, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 849, 854 (2005) (holding that an issue first raised in a post-trial\r\n  motion is not preserved for appellate review); Susan R. v. Donald R.,\r\n  389 S.C. 107, 118, 697 S.E.2d 634, 640 (Ct. App. 2010) (holding Husband's\r\n  argument that Wife's attorney's fees award was excessive was not preserved for\r\n  appellate review because Husband raised that argument for the first time in a\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion). Â Accordingly, we affirm the family court's decision to\r\n  include thirty-one percent of the relocation benefit in the marital estate.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court erred in determining the rental properties\r\n    were transmuted into marital property.Â  Additionally, we find the family court\r\n    did not err in equitably dividing the SURF account and the marital portion of\r\n    Husband's relocation benefit.Â  Accordingly, the family court's order is AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.Â  HUFF and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The family court determined, based upon Husband's\r\n  financial declaration statement, Husband's total monthly income from the rental\r\n  properties and two Atlanta rental properties purchased after the parties\r\n  separated was $8,525.Â  \r\n[2] The Langley property was sold during the marriage.Â  \r\n[3] Husband's $60 a month payroll deduction began in 2002\r\n  and continued until his retirement in 2006. \r\n[4] Husband amended his initial pleading at the start of\r\n  trial to include an action for divorce.Â  [5] Husband argues that if this court finds the SURF\r\n  account was marital property, he should receive credit for the $9,000 he\r\n  withdrew from SURF account to satisfy a marital debt owed to Metropolitan Life,\r\n  and for the $2,250 he contends he gave Wife from the SURF account after this\r\n  divorce proceeding was commenced.Â  These arguments are not preserved for our\r\n  review.Â  See Feldman v. Feldman, 380 S.C. 538, 545, 670 S.E.2d\r\n  669, 672 (Ct. App. 2008) (holding for an issue to be preserved for appeal it\r\n  must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court); see alsoÂ  Noisette v.

Ross &amp; Co., LLC (WLR)\r\n  and several of its board members (Appellants)[1] appeal the circuit court's striking of two of their defenses and dismissal of\r\n  their counterclaim in the direct shareholder lawsuit filed by Brian Menezes.Â \r\n  We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\n Safety Components\r\n  International, Inc. (SCI) was a publicly traded Delaware corporation with its\r\n  headquarters in South Carolina.Â  SCI was in the business of designing and\r\n  manufacturing airbag fabric and airbag cushions.Â  From 1999 to 2006, Menezes\r\n  was employed by SCI as Chief Financial Officer, and for a time, interim Chief\r\n  Executive Officer.Â  He was terminated from his employment with SCI in June of 2006\r\n  but remained a shareholder.Â  Menezes sued SCI to recover additional severance\r\n  pay he alleged he was due and a &quot;change of control&quot; bonus included in\r\n  his employment contract.\r\n While Menezes's\r\n  employment lawsuit was proceeding, SCI entered into discussions with the former\r\n  International Textile Group, Inc. (FITG), a privately held Delaware corporation\r\n  headquartered in North Carolina, about a possible merger.[2]Â \r\n  WLR, an investment firm, owned shares in both SCI and FITG, either directly or\r\n  indirectly through affiliate entities.\r\nOn\r\n  August 29, 2006, the SCI board of directors approved the merger agreement between\r\n  SCI and FITG.Â  The merger agreement provided that FITG would merge into SCI and\r\n  that SCI's certificate of incorporation would be amended to reflect the new\r\n  combined entity.Â  FITG shareholders would receive one share of SCI stock for\r\n  every 1.4379 shares of FITG stock surrendered.[3]Â \r\n  The terms of the merger were made public via a press release and the filing of\r\n  a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on August 30 and\r\n  again on September 1, when a preliminary Joint Proxy Statement/Prospectus was\r\n  filed with the SEC.Â  A final Proxy Statement was mailed to stockholders on\r\n  September 25, 2006.Â  According to the Proxy Statement, FITG stockholders needed\r\n  to take no action to effect the merger as a majority of stockholders had\r\n  approved it in writing contemporaneous with the signing of the merger\r\n  agreement. Â The Proxy Statement also indicated &quot;no action by the\r\n  stockholders of SCI is required to approve the merger agreement or to\r\n  consummate the merger.&quot; Â SCI stockholders did need to satisfy a condition\r\n  precedent by agreeing to amend the certificate of incorporation to reflect the\r\n  existence of the newly formed entity and by re-electing five of the current\r\n  board members.Â  However, according to the Proxy Statement, &quot;stockholders\r\n  of SCI holding approximately 75.6% of SCI's outstanding common stock have\r\n  indicated that they intend to vote to adopt the amended and re-instated\r\n  certificate of incorporation and to elect the directors nominated for\r\n  re-election.Â  Approval of the matters to be voted on at the 2006 Annual Meeting\r\n  is therefore assured.&quot;\r\nOn\r\n  September 28, 2006, in exchange for payments totaling approximately $575,000,\r\n  Menezes signed a Settlement Agreement and Release of All Claims (the Release)\r\n  to settle the employment lawsuit.Â  The Release stated Menezes agreed to\r\n  &quot;release, acquit and forever discharge&quot; defendants of:\r\n\r\nAny and\r\n  all manner of actions, causes of action, suits, claims, setoffs, debts,\r\n  compensation, salary, benefits, sums of money, accounts, covenants, trespasses,\r\n  damages, judgments and demands whatsoever, in law or in equity, whether known\r\n  or unknown, liquidated, contingent, absolute, or otherwise, which plaintiff\r\n  either has had or now has against the Released Parties for or related to any\r\n  matter or thing whatsoever from the beginning of time up to and including the date\r\n  of execution hereof.Â  It is [p]laintiff's intention to release all rights and\r\n  claims that he may lawfully release. \r\n\r\nThe Release specifically\r\n  barred Menezes from bringing &quot;any claim based upon or as an owner of any\r\n  stock or interest . . . arising prior to the execution&quot; of the Release and\r\n  from pursuing any claims &quot;made or which may have been made&quot; in the\r\n  employment lawsuit.[4]Â \r\n  On October 20, 2006, the merger between SCI and FITG was completed in that all\r\n  pre-conditions were either satisfied or waived.Â  \r\nMenezes\r\n  brought this lawsuit in 2008 alleging breaches of fiduciary duties on the part\r\n  of the Appellants in the following particulars:\r\n\r\n(a)&nbsp; by\r\n  proposing the [m]erger and then allowing it to close notwithstanding the\r\n  financial condition of FITG;\r\n(b)&nbsp; by\r\n  approving the [m]erger on terms which gave 65% ownership to the FITG\r\n  stockholders and diluted the minority shareholders to 35%, or at all [sic];\r\n(c)&nbsp; by\r\n  not providing accurate and complete information regarding FITG . . .Â  or\r\n  ensuring that such information was provided to them;\r\n(d)&nbsp; to\r\n  the extent any one of them was not aware of the financial situation of FITG, by\r\n  failing to learn of the financial situation of FITG and failing to take it into\r\n  account or see that it was taken into account with regard to the [m]erger;\r\n(e)&nbsp; by\r\n  failing to ensure that proper due diligence was conducted on behalf of SCI or\r\n  FITG;\r\n(f)&nbsp; by\r\n  allowing the representation at the [m]erger closing that MAC[5] Clause condition was satisfied;\r\n(g) by\r\n  failing to call off or renegotiate the [m]erger (or cause it to be called off\r\n  or renegotiated) because of the financial condition of FITG;\r\n(i)&nbsp; [sic]\r\n  by allowing the debt previously held by FITG to be transferred to Combined\r\n  Company and/or by allowing that debt to be converted into preferred stock; \r\n(j)&nbsp; [sic]\r\n  by allowing or causing the renegotiation [of] the SCI's credit facility and/or\r\n  obtaining $100 million of additional preferred stock in connection therewith;\r\n  and/or\r\n(k)&nbsp; [sic]\r\n  by otherwise failing to protect the interests of the minority stockholders of\r\n  SCI.\r\n\r\nAppellants\r\n  answered, relying on the Release as an affirmative defense to Menezes's claims\r\n  and counterclaiming for breach of the Release.[6]Â \r\n  Appellants also moved to dismiss Menezes's complaint or in the alternative for\r\n  summary judgment arguing the Release barred the claims as a matter of law.Â \r\n  Menezes filed a motion to dismiss Appellants' counterclaims.Â  The circuit court\r\n  concluded Menezes's breach of fiduciary duty claim accrued at the time the\r\n  merger was completed in October 2006, meaning the claims in this lawsuit were\r\n  not barred by the Release.Â  The circuit court therefore denied Appellants'\r\n  motion to dismiss or for summary judgment, dismissed Appellants' counterclaim,\r\n  and struck Appellants' defenses related to the Release.Â  Appellants filed a\r\n  motion to reconsider with the circuit court and that motion was denied.Â  This\r\n  appeal followed.[7]\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in dismissing their counterclaim and striking\r\n  their affirmative defenses relating to the Release because Menezes's claim\r\n  could not have accrued prior to the closing of the merger.Â  They argue the\r\n  circuit court's reliance on certain Delaware cases is misplaced in light of\r\n  more recent case law and the facts of this case.Â  We agree.\r\n&quot;[U]pon the court's own initiative, at any time the court may\r\n  order stricken from any pleading any insufficient defense or any redundant,\r\n  immaterial, impertinent or scandalous matter.&quot;Â  Rule 12(f), SCRCP.Â  &quot;The\r\n  question [on a motion to dismiss a counterclaim] is whether in the light most\r\n  favorable to the complainant, and with every doubt resolved on his behalf, the\r\n  counterclaim states any valid claim for relief.&quot;Â  Charleston Cnty. Sch.\r\n    Dist. v. Laidlaw Transit, Inc., 348 S.C. 420, 424, 559 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2001). \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court's order frames the question before us narrowly:Â  Could Menezes's\r\n  claim have only accrued after completion of the merger?Â  Neither party has\r\n  disputed that Delaware law controls the question of the accrual date as claims\r\n  concerning the fiduciary duties of corporate officers is governed by the state\r\n  of incorporation.Â  See Restatement (First) of Conflicts of Laws Â§ 187 (1934) (&quot;[T]he existence and extent of the\r\n  liability of shareholders, officers, or directors of a corporation . . .Â  is\r\n  determined by the law of the state of incorporation.&quot;).Â  &quot;Generally, the rights and obligations of stockholders, including the relative rights of\r\n  stockholders as respects the corporation itself, are determined and controlled\r\n  by the law of the state of incorporation.&quot; Â 18 Am. Jur. 2d Corporations Â§ 21. Â South Carolina courts generally follow the traditional choice of\r\n  law rules as stated in the Restatement of Conflicts of Laws.Â  See McDaniel\r\n    v. McDaniel, 243 S.C. 286, 292, 133 S.E.2d 809, 813 (1963).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court cites four Delaware cases in its order for the proposition that\r\n  the claim accrued no earlier than the closing of the merger.[8]Â \r\n  The first case cited is Kaufman v. Albin, 447 A.2d 761 (Del. Ch. 1982).Â \r\n  In Kaufman, a shareholder filed a derivative suit alleging waste of\r\n  corporate assets by the corporation's board of directors.Â  Id. at\r\n  761-62.Â  On August 22, 1977, the board voted to accept and recommend a tender\r\n  offer by another business to purchase a majority of the corporation's stock.Â  Id. at 762.Â  The defendants argued their alleged misdeeds relating to the\r\n  transaction all occurred prior to September 1, 1977, when a statute affecting\r\n  service of corporate officers took effect.Â  Id. at 763.Â  If the claim\r\n  accrued before September 1, the complaint would be dismissed for ineffective\r\n  service; if afterwards, the claims would go forward.Â  In determining the\r\n  plaintiff's claims accrued after September 1, the court noted:Â  \r\n\r\nAfter\r\n  August 22, the tender offer still had to be commenced and [the corporation's]\r\n  stockholders had to be advised that the directors . . . recommended that the tender\r\n  offer be accepted.Â  This was done on September 12, 1977.Â  [The purchasing\r\n  company] also had available many options which would have enabled it to\r\n  terminate the tender offer if certain events took place before October 3,\r\n  1977.Â  Even more importantly, the tender offer was contingent upon it being\r\n  accepted by the tendering of at least 52% of the outstanding shares of stock.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 763-64.\r\nThe\r\n  court then quoted from the preeminent treatise in Delaware corporate law. Â &quot;In Folk, The Delaware General Corporation Law, 487\r\n  (1967) it is stated: 'Accordingly, the circumstances of the case will\r\n  determine whether the transaction is executed or continuing.Â  If the action complained of requires stockholder approval,\r\n    the transaction is not considered complete until the stockholders have approved\r\n    it.'&quot;Â  Kaufman, 447 A.2d at 764.\r\nThe Kaufman court further relied on the case of Lavine v. Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc.,\r\n  122 A.2d 550 (Del. 1956), for the proposition that when &quot;exchanges of\r\n  stock are contingent upon shareholder approval, the transaction is not\r\n  completed until the shareholder vote takes place.&quot;[9]Â  Kaufman, 447 A.2d at 764.Â  The court concluded the transaction in Kaufman commenced on August 22, but was not consummated until the close of the tender\r\n  offer on October 3.Â  Id.Â  &quot;The alleged wrong was therefore a\r\n  continuing wrong and any cause of action attacking it arose or accrued&quot;\r\n  after September 1, 1977.Â  Id.\r\nHowever,\r\n  more recent case law suggests in a standing to sue case, the courts are looking\r\n  to the date of the wrong for purposes of determining accrual as opposed to the\r\n  date of shareholder approval.Â  See Dieter v. Prime Computer, Inc.,\r\n  681 A.2d 1068, 1072 (Del. Ch. 1996) (finding plaintiff lacked standing to be\r\n  class representative because\r\n  &quot;[t]he challenged transaction is [the Board's] approval of the Merger. Â The\r\n  alleged breach of fiduciary duty occurred at the time the Board approved the\r\n  Merger Agreement . . . . It is not the Merger that constitutes the wrongful act\r\n  of which Plaintiffs complain; it is the 'fixing of the terms of the\r\n  transaction.'&quot;) (quoting Brown v.\r\n    Automated Mktg. Sys., Inc., No. 6715,\r\n  1982 WL 8782 at *2 (Del.

R.P. Scherer\r\n    Corp., No. 6889, 1982 WL 17888 at *2 (Del. Ch. 1982) (relying on Brown to find plaintiff lacked standing to sue when she purchased stock after board's\r\n  approval of supermajority anti-takeover provisions and announcement of merger\r\n  terms but before shareholder approval of those provisions). \r\nAdditionally, Kaufman relies on Folk as it read in\r\n  1967.Â  As Appellants point out, Folk has been amended, and the relevant section now states:\r\n\r\nGenerally,\r\n  the determinative issue is when the specific acts of alleged wrong doing\r\n  occurred, and not when their effect is felt.Â  Therefore, the circumstances of\r\n  the case will determine whether the transaction is executed or continuing.Â  For\r\n  instance, an offer made by the corporation to certain of its stockholders to\r\n  exchange one class of stock for another, which was specifically conditioned on\r\n  approval by the corporation's other stockholders, was held not be completed\r\n  until stockholder approval was obtained.Â  On the other hand, both a proposed\r\n  merger and a proposed supermajority voting provision have been held to be\r\n  consummated when their terms were fixed and announced by the board of\r\n  directors, and not to be continuing transaction up to the time of stockholder\r\n  approval.\r\n\r\n2 Edward P. Welch et al., Folk\r\n  on the Delaware General Corporation Law: Fundamentals Â§ 327.3.2 (2010) (footnotes\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe next\r\n  case relied upon by the circuit court is Dofflemyer v. W.F. Hall Printing Co.,\r\n  558 F.Supp. 372 (D. Del. 1983).Â  In Dofflemyer, the plaintiffs, former\r\n  shareholders, filed a derivative action alleging various directors breached\r\n  their fiduciary duties in relation to orchestrating a merger.Â  Id. at\r\n  375.Â  The plaintiffs alleged the directors procured a faulty investment\r\n  opinion, maneuvered to avoid a supermajority provision in the by-laws, and\r\n  issued a false and misleading proxy statement.Â  Id. at 379.Â  The court,\r\n  in determining when the statute of limitations began to run on these claims\r\n  stated:Â  &quot;The plaintiffs could not have sued for damages until the merger\r\n  was actually accomplished â€“ until that time, they had suffered no injury by the\r\n  defendants' acts.&quot;Â  Id.Â  The court relied primarily on Kaufman in its analysis, but nowhere in Kaufman is the issue of money damages\r\n  discussed.Â  \r\nMore\r\n  recent cases that address the requirement of damages prior to bringing suit\r\n  seem out of step with Dofflemeyer.Â  In Albert v. Alex Brown\r\n    Management Services, Inc., No. 672-N, 2005 WL 1594085, *18 (Del. Ch. 2005),[10] plaintiffs, limited partners in an investment fund, sued managers for various\r\n  breaches of fiduciary duties including &quot;unhedging&quot; their funds and\r\n  exposing them to more financial risk.Â  The plaintiffs waited to sue while the\r\n  stocks were rising and then sued for damages upon their fall.Â  In finding\r\n  plaintiffs' complaints were untimely, the court stated:\r\n\r\n  The law in Delaware is crystal clear that a claim accrues as soon\r\n  as the wrongful act occurs. Â This\r\n  is so because the plaintiffs were harmed as soon as the alleged wrongful acts\r\n  occurred. Whether or not the plaintiffs could have sued for damages is not\r\n  dispositive as to whether the claim accrued, since, as soon as the alleged\r\n  wrongful act occurred, the plaintiffs could have sought injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nThis reasoning is evident in other cases as well.Â  See In re SunGard Data Sys., Inc., No. 1221-N, 2005 WL 1653975 at *2 (Del. Ch. 2005)\r\n  (&quot;[T]he optimal time to bring a disclosure claim in connection with a\r\n  proposed merger, or in a like context where the company requests shareholder\r\n  action or approval is before the stockholder vote is taken and the deal closes.&quot;); Kahn v. Seaboard Corp., 625 A.2d 269, 271 (Del. Ch. 1993) (&quot;Any such wrong\r\n  occurred at the time that enforceable legal rights against Seaboard were\r\n  created.Â  Suit could have been brought immediately thereafter to rescind the\r\n  contract and for nominal damages which are traditionally available in contract\r\n  actions.Â  Complete and adequate relief, if justified, could be shaped\r\n  immediately or at any point thereafter.&quot;); see also Seidel\r\n    v. Lee, 954 F. Supp. 810, 816 (D. Del. 1996) (citing Dofflemeyer parenthetically for the proposition &quot;fiduciary duty claim accrues when\r\n  [the] breach is accomplished&quot;).\r\nWe\r\n  next turn our attention to Baron v. Allied Artists Pictures Corp., 717 F.2d\r\n  105 (3rd Cir. 1983), also cited by the circuit court.Â  Baron involved the\r\n  statute of limitations relating to a violation of SEC regulations for issuing a\r\n  misleading proxy statement.Â  Id. at 106.Â  There, the court concluded the\r\n  plaintiff's cause of action for damages resulting from a breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty/misleading proxy statement did not accrue until the merger was\r\n  accomplished and a suit for damages could be successfully maintained.Â  Id. at 108-09.Â  However, the reasoning in that case has been superseded by statute\r\n  and now is arguably in favor of finding a cause of action accrues at the time\r\n  of the wrongdoing, not a the time the merger closes.Â  See In re Exxon\r\n    Mobil Corp., 387 F. Supp.2d 407, 421 (D.N.J. 2005) (&quot;Baron pre-dates [the] Sarbanes-Oxley [Act of 2002] and the decisions of the courts in\r\n  this Circuit which have held that actions under Sections 10(b) and 14(a) arise\r\n  on the date that the allegedly false or misleading statement underlying the\r\n  claims was made.&quot;).\r\nFinally,\r\n  we examine In re Coca-Cola Enterprises, Inc., No. 1927-CC, 2007 WL\r\n  3122370 (Del. Ch. 2007), aff'd, International Brotherhood Teamsters\r\n    v. Coca-Cola, No. 1927-cc, 2008 WL 2484587 (Del. 2008).Â  In that case,\r\n  disgruntled shareholders of Coca-Cola's biggest bottler claimed breach of\r\n  fiduciary duty by its board members.Â  Id. at *1.Â  The plaintiffs claimed\r\n  Coca-Cola was essentially controlling plaintiffs' business, for Coca-Cola's\r\n  profit and to plaintiffs' detriment, and plaintiffs' board was allowing this to\r\n  happen.Â  Id.Â  The parties had entered into a contract in 1986 that gave\r\n  Coca-Cola the authority to do the offensive acts.Â  Id.Â  Plaintiffs\r\n  brought suit in 2006, alleging damages from specific acts that occurred under\r\n  the contract in 2002 and 2004.Â  Id. at *5.Â  The court, in determining\r\n  whether plaintiffs' claims were barred by the statute of limitations or laches\r\n  concluded: &quot;Under Delaware law, a plaintiff's cause of action accrues at\r\n  the moment of the wrongful act â€“ not when the harmful effects of the act are\r\n  felt â€“ even if the plaintiff is unaware of the wrong.&quot;Â  Id. Â Plaintiffs'\r\n  claims were dismissed as time-barred because &quot;[t]he actions challenged in\r\n  the amended complaint represent the manifestation of the bargain struck in 1986\r\n  . . . .&quot;Â  Id. at *6.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the Coca-Cola court relied on Kahn wherein\r\n  the plaintiff filed a derivative action against directors and the corporation\r\n  relating to transactions carried out under the terms of a time charter\r\n  agreement.Â  The court stated: &quot;[T]he 'continuing\r\n  wrong' is performance of a contract. . . . So long as the time charter is not\r\n  rescinded, the payments it calls for are legal obligations, not wrongs.&quot;Â  Kahn,\r\n  625 A.2d at 272.Â  Any wrong occurred at the\r\n  time &quot;enforceable legal rights against Seaboard were created.&quot;Â  Id. at 271.\r\nAnother\r\n  oft-cited case is Elster v. American Airlines, 100 A.2d 219 (Del. Ch.\r\n  1953).Â  Presented with a similar situation, the court explained:\r\n\r\nAssuming\r\n  that the individual defendants did wrong to the Corporation by entering into\r\n  the contract, it does not follow that they committed any wrong in carrying out\r\n  the contract once it had been made.Â  Indeed, had they not done so, the\r\n  corporation would presumably have been subject to liability for breach of\r\n  contract. \r\n\r\nId. at 224 (quoting Levitan v. Stout, 97 F. Supp.\r\n  105, 119 (W.D. Ky. 1951)).\r\nAfter\r\n  reviewing the facts of the case sub judice and all the relevant case\r\n  law, we conclude the circuit court's reliance on the four cases cited above was\r\n  misplaced.Â  \r\nKaufman relies heavily on Lavine, which was a case\r\n  involving the plaintiff's standing to bring suit.Â  As discussed, more recent\r\n  standing cases indicate a claim accrues at the time of the wrongdoing by the\r\n  fiduciary, not necessarily at the time a merger closes.Â  Furthermore, Kaufman did not involve a merger but a tender offer and the court indicated a claim\r\n  does not accrue until shareholders approve the action if shareholder approval\r\n  is required.Â  In Menezes's case, according to the Proxy Statement, FITG\r\n  stockholders needed to take no action to effect the merger as a majority of\r\n  stockholders had approved it in writing contemporaneous with the signing of the\r\n  merger agreement.Â  Notably, the Proxy Statement also said &quot;no action by\r\n    the stockholders of SCI is required to approve the merger agreement or to\r\n    consummate the merger.&quot; (emphasis added).Â  SCI stockholders did need\r\n  to satisfy a condition precedent by agreeing to amend the certificate of\r\n  incorporation to reflect the existence of the newly formed entity and by\r\n  re-electing five of the current board members.Â  However, according to the Proxy\r\n  Statement, &quot;stockholders of SCI holding approximately 75.6% of SCI's\r\n  outstanding common stock have indicated that they intend to vote to adopt the\r\n  amended and re-instated certificate of incorporation and to elect the directors\r\n  nominated for re-election.Â  Approval of the matters to be voted on at the 2006\r\n  Annual Meeting is therefore assured.&quot;Â  Menezes acknowledged in his\r\n  complaint that the closing of the merger was &quot;merely a formality.&quot;Â  In\r\n  light of recent case law indicating the date of the wrong is the relevant time\r\n  and because Kaufman is not factually on all fours with this case, Kaufman does not dictate a finding Menezes's claim could have accrued only at the time\r\n  of the merger's consummation.\r\nDofflemeyer seems out of step with more recent case law on\r\n  fiduciary duty claims because those cases indicate a claim may be brought prior\r\n  to the incurring of money damages in the form of a request for injunctive\r\n  relief.Â  Menezes could have brought a claim for injunctive relief prior to the\r\n  signing of the Release, and this thought was at least contemplated as evidenced\r\n  by the inclusion of such an allegation in his draft amended complaint given to\r\n  opposing counsel in the employment litigation.Â  Menezes's remedy, money damages,\r\n  may have been different, but the claim, breach of fiduciary duty, would be the\r\n  same.\r\nFinally,\r\n  we do not believe the &quot;legally enforceable rights&quot; language in Kahn and Coca-Cola necessitate a finding that Menezes's claim accrued after\r\n  the merger.Â  Once the merger agreement was signed, SCI and FITG had legally\r\n  enforceable rights against each other to proceed with all aspects of the merger\r\n  agreement in good faith.Â  If they did not, they would be in breach of the\r\n  agreement and subject to suit.Â  More importantly, once the merger agreement was\r\n  signed, Menezes, as a shareholder, had a legally enforceable right to enjoin\r\n  the merger from being consummated.\r\nFor all of the foregoing reasons, the circuit court's\r\n  reliance on the cited cases was erroneous.Â  Because Menezes's claim could have\r\n  arisen prior to the closing of the merger, the Appellants' defenses relating to\r\n  the Release were not insufficient. Additionally, their counterclaim arising out\r\n  of the Release does not, resolving all doubts in their favor, fail to state a\r\n  valid claim for relief.Â  Consequently, it was error for the circuit court to\r\n  dismiss Appellants' defenses and counterclaim relating to the Release.Â  The\r\n  decision of the circuit court is therefore\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWILLIAMS,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\nI\r\n  concur in the decision to reverse and remand.Â  However, I write separately\r\n  because I would like to address the combination of Menezes's ten claims for\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty into one claim by the circuit court.\r\nMenezes\r\n  brought this lawsuit in 2008 alleging breach of fiduciary duty on the part of\r\n  the Appellants in all of the following particulars:\r\n\r\n(a)&nbsp; by\r\n  proposing the [m]erger and then allowing it to close notwithstanding the\r\n  financial condition of FITG;\r\n(b)&nbsp; by\r\n  approving the [m]erger on terms which gave 65% ownership to the FITG\r\n  stockholders and diluted the minority shareholders to 35%, or at all [sic];\r\n(c)&nbsp; by\r\n  not providing accurate and complete information regarding FITG . . . or\r\n  ensuring that such information was provided to them;\r\n(d)&nbsp; to\r\n  the extent any one of them was not aware of the financial situation of FITG, by\r\n  failing to learn of the financial situation of FITG and failing to take it into\r\n  account or see that it was taken into account with regard to the [m]erger;\r\n(e)&nbsp; by\r\n  failing to ensure that proper due diligence was conducted on behalf of SCI or\r\n  FITG;\r\n(f)&nbsp; by\r\n  allowing the representation at the [m]erger closing that MAC Clause condition\r\n  was satisfied;\r\n(g)&nbsp; by\r\n  failing to call off or renegotiate the [m]erger (or cause it to be called off\r\n  or renegotiated) because of the financial condition of FITG;\r\n(i)&nbsp;&nbsp; [sic] by allowing the debt previously held by FITG to be transferred to\r\n  Combined Company and/or by allowing that debt to be converted into preferred\r\n  stock; \r\n(j)&nbsp;&nbsp; [sic]\r\n  by allowing or causing the renegotiation [of] the SCI's credit facility and/or\r\n  obtaining $100 million of additional preferred stock in connection therewith;\r\n  and/or\r\n(k)&nbsp;&nbsp; [sic]\r\n  by otherwise failing to protect the interests of the minority stockholders of\r\n  SCI.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court ruled that the breach of fiduciary duty claims could not have\r\n  arisen prior to the closing of the merger.Â  Appellants neither argued that the\r\n  claims should be considered separately, nor asked the court to alter or amend\r\n  its ruling on the issue.Â  Thus, I would find the question of whether or not the\r\n  court erred in considering Menezes's claims in combination is not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76-77,\r\n  497 S.E.2d 731, 733-34 (1998) (finding an issue must have been raised to the\r\n  trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review and holding post\r\n  trial motions are necessary to preserve issues that were raised to the trial\r\n  court but not ruled upon).Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  this preservation concern, and in light of the reversal and remand of the case\r\n  by the majority opinion, I note some of the claims could have arisen prior to\r\n  the closing of the merger and others could have arisen after the closing of the\r\n  merger.Â  On August 29, 2006, the SCI board of directors approved the merger\r\n  agreement between SCI and FITG.Â  On September 28, 2006, in exchange for payments\r\n  totaling approximately $575,000, Menezes signed a Settlement Agreement and\r\n  Release of All Claims to settle the claims involved in the employment lawsuit.Â \r\n  Finally, on October 20, 2006, the merger between SCI and FITG was completed and\r\n  all preconditions were either satisfied or waived.Â  Importantly, we should\r\n  recognize the fact that any claims arising between the signing of the release\r\n  on September 28, 2006, and the finalizing of the merger on October 20, 2006,\r\n  were valid claims.Â  Furthermore, by analyzing each of Menezes's claims\r\n  independently of one another, as opposed to combining them, some of the claims\r\n  may be barred by Menezes's release whereas others may not be barred.Â  Although\r\n  I agree with the majority in distinguishing the cases relied upon by the\r\n  circuit court, I would find the cases nonetheless shed some light on the\r\n  limiting nature of combining Menezes's ten claims for breach of fiduciary duty\r\n  into one claim.Â  Therefore, on remand, even though the court did not do so\r\n  initially, I would urge the court to break down the acts alleged by Menezes\r\n  separately, as one or more acts could be deemed a separate breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty based on when each act occurred.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Stephen B.\r\n  Duerk was not a member of the board but was president of SCI and executed the\r\n  merger agreement on its behalf.\r\n[2] FITG refers to\r\n  International Textile Group prior to the merger with SCI.Â  After the merger,\r\n  the newly formed entity took the name International Textile Group.\r\n[3] According to\r\n  Menezes's complaint, this exchange ratio had the effect of significantly diluting\r\n  SCI stockholders' ownership in the newly formed entity.Â  \r\n[4] Appellants\r\n  argued to the circuit court that Menezes could have brought his shareholder\r\n  claim in the employment lawsuit.Â  Menezes provided opposing counsel with a\r\n  draft amended complaint in the employment lawsuit.Â  That amended complaint\r\n  contains an allegation, although stricken through, that the proposed merger\r\n  agreement was made on unfair terms.\r\n[5] MAC stands for\r\n  materially adverse changes. \r\n[6] Stephen Duerk\r\n  filed an individual answer but asserts the same positions as all Appellants. \r\n[7] Appellants then filed an appeal with this court\r\n  requesting review of the entire circuit court's order.Â  Menezes filed a motion\r\n  to dismiss the appeal arguing the order was interlocutory.Â  A single judge\r\n  denied the motion but limited appellate review to the dismissal of Appellants'\r\n  counterclaims and the striking of their affirmative defenses citing section\r\n  14-3-330(2)(c) of the South Carolina Code (1977).Â  Appellants filed a petition\r\n  for rehearing of this ruling, arguing the single issue on appeal (accrual of\r\n  the breach of fiduciary duty claim) would determine all the points addressed in\r\n  the circuit court's order.Â  Ultimately a three-judge panel of this court\r\n  affirmed the single judge's ruling limiting appellate review to the circuit\r\n  court's dismissal of Appellants' counterclaims and the striking of Appellants'\r\n  defenses.Â  Therefore, we limit our discussion to those issues.\r\n[8] Appellants\r\n  raised to the circuit court at the hearing and in their motion for\r\n  reconsideration whether Menezes's claim &quot;may have been made&quot; (under sub-paragraph\r\n  8 of the Release) in the employment lawsuit.Â  The circuit court does not\r\n  specifically address this point in its order.Â  However, whether or not the\r\n  claim may have been brought would seem to turn on whether or not the claim had\r\n  accrued.Â  Therefore, we believe that argument is subsumed in the accrual\r\n  analysis.\r\n[9] Lavine was a shareholder standing case as are many of the cases discussed herein.Â  In Lavine,\r\n  the issue was whether the plaintiff had standing to sue for breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty relating to a merger when plaintiff purchased shares after the board's\r\n  approval of the merger and the announcement of its terms but before the final\r\n  shareholder vote.Â  Id. at 550-51.\r\n[10] Albert is a statute of limitations case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Â We\r\n  reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  February 1999, Danny R. Prince was admitted to Hospital's care after suffering\r\n  a work-related injury.Â  On February 17, 1999, Prince was discovered after\r\n  falling to the roof of the hospital building, one floor below his room's\r\n  window.Â  Prince sustained additional injuries but did not remember the incident.Â \r\n  Hospital's QAC investigated the incident and maintained a file of the\r\n  information it assembled.Â  \r\nPrince\r\n  sued Hospital under the Tort Claims Act for his injuries and sought disclosure\r\n  of the QAC file.Â  Hospital claimed the contents of the file were confidential\r\n  pursuant to sections 40-71-10 and -20 of the South Carolina Code (2001 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2004), and the trial court agreed.[1]Â \r\n  On January 8, 2004, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Hospital.Â  Prince appealed\r\n  (Prince's Appeal), seeking disclosure of the QAC file and a new trial.Â  This\r\n  court remanded the matter to the trial court for an in camera review of the QAC\r\n  file and a determination whether its contents were indeed confidential under\r\n  section 40-71-20.[2]Â  See Prince v. Beaufort Mem. Hosp., Op. No. 2005-UP-602 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. refiled Apr. 11, 2006).Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  remand from Prince's Appeal, the trial court reviewed the QAC file in camera\r\n  and found it &quot;manifestly clear&quot; that Hospital had used some contents\r\n  of the file to answer Prince's interrogatories.Â  The trial court found both\r\n  Hospital's answers to interrogatories and the &quot;small portions of the\r\n  witness statement summaries&quot; that were not repeated in those answers were\r\n  relevant to the dispute.Â  In its analysis, the trial court compared\r\n  hospital-patient confidentiality to the attorney-client privilege, finding the\r\n  client alone has the power to waive the privilege.Â  Furthermore, the trial\r\n  court observed a client's voluntary disclosure of one privileged communication\r\n  waives the privilege as to all attorney-client communications on the same\r\n  subject.Â  Relying on the attorney-client privilege and the Rule of\r\n  Completeness,[3] the trial court ordered the entire QAC file be unsealed and provided to\r\n  Prince.Â  \r\nHospital\r\n  appealed (Hospital's First Appeal), arguing Prince had failed to preserve his\r\n  argument that Hospital had waived confidentiality and the trial court had\r\n  exceeded its authority by ruling on the issue of waiver.Â  This court agreed\r\n  with Hospital and again remanded the matter to the trial court, instructing the\r\n  trial court to &quot;set forth the specific portions of the [QAC] file that are\r\n  subject to discovery as well as the reasons these portions are not confidential\r\n  under section 40-71-20.&quot;Â  See Prince v. Beaufort Mem. Hosp.,\r\n  Op. No. 2008-UP-139 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 3, 2008).Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  remand from Hospital's First Appeal, the trial court reviewed the contents of\r\n  the QAC file and found most documents in the file were discoverable under the\r\n  statute because the information in them was otherwise available from the\r\n  original sources.Â  The trial court found one document[4] particularly problematic because the information in it differed from other\r\n  evidence obtained from the same nurse.Â  The trial court reasoned:Â  &quot;When\r\n  deposition and trial testimony varies from, or is inconsistent with, that given\r\n  to the committee, the statutory protection should not be inimical to\r\n  safeguarding the integrity of the fact finding process.&quot;Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  trial court found that because Prince had no memory of the incident, Hospital\r\n  and its investigators were &quot;the only source of information as to\r\n  what occurred the night of the subject incident.&quot;Â  As a result, the trial\r\n  court ordered both the original and the copy of the QAC file,[5] except for two attorney-client privileged items, unsealed and produced to\r\n  Prince.Â  Hospital filed a motion for reconsideration, which the trial court\r\n  denied.Â  Hospital appealed, arguing the trial court erred by misinterpreting\r\n  the scope of its review and by misapplying section 40-71-20.Â  Â Â \r\nFollowing\r\n  oral arguments in June 2010, this court instructed the parties to brief the\r\n  following issues:Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Whether on remand, the trial court\r\n  had the authority, pursuant to this court's remand orders to consider any conflict\r\n  between Jennifer Emerick's deposition or trial testimony, the hospital's\r\n  answers to interrogatories and the QAC file?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Did any conflict between Jennifer\r\n  Emerick's deposition or trial testimony, the hospital's answers to\r\n  interrogatories and the QAC file or the failure to disclose it to the court or\r\n  opposing counsel warrant a new trial?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe parties submitted\r\n  supplemental briefs, a new record on appeal, and a supplemental record on\r\n  appeal.Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe\r\n  decision whether to grant or deny a new trial rests within the sound discretion\r\n  of the trial court and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of that\r\n  discretion.Â  Fields v. J. Haynes Waters Builders, Inc., 376 S.C. 545,\r\n  569, 658 S.E.2d 80, 93 (2008).Â  A trial court abuses its discretion by issuing\r\n  a decision that is either controlled by an error of law or unsupported by the\r\n  evidence.Â  Fairchild v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 385 S.C. 344, 350, 683\r\n  S.E.2d 818, 821 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Trial Court's\r\n  Review \r\nA.&nbsp; Authority\r\n  under Remand Order\r\nHospital\r\n  argues the trial court erred by exceeding its authority under this court's\r\n  remand order.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n&quot;[A]\r\n  trial court has no authority to exceed the mandate of the appellate court on\r\n  remand.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241,\r\n  250-51, 551 S.E.2d 274, 279 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing 5 Am. Jur. 2d Appellate\r\n    Review Â§ 784, at 453 (1995)).Â  The mandate of the appellate court is\r\n  jurisdictional.Â  Id.Â  The trial court has a duty to follow the appellate\r\n  court's directions.Â  Ackerman v. McMillan, 324 S.C. 440, 443, 477 S.E.2d\r\n  267, 268 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  reverse the trial court's order requiring Hospital to release the contents of\r\n  the QAC file to Prince.Â  When we remand a case, the trial court has only the\r\n  jurisdiction and authority mandated by this court.Â  Basnight, 346 S.C.\r\n  at 250-51, 551 S.E.2d at 279.Â  Upon remand following the Hospital's First\r\n  Appeal, this court instructed the trial court to &quot;set forth the specific\r\n  portions of the [QAC] file that are subject to discovery as well as the reasons\r\n  these portions are not confidential under section 40-71-20.&quot;Â  Prince v.\r\n    Beaufort Mem. Hosp., Op. No. 2008-UP-139 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 3,\r\n  2008).Â  As a result, the trial court's jurisdiction extended only to a review\r\n  of each document contained in the QAC file in light of the statute.Â  \r\nInstead\r\n  of reviewing the documents in the QAC file solely in light of the statutory\r\n  provisions, the trial court based its decision to unseal the QAC file on three\r\n  factors:Â  (1) the availability of some information from original sources, (2)\r\n  the conflict of information in Item 15 with Nurse Emerick's trial testimony,\r\n  and (3) Hospital's apparent use of certain confidential documents in preparing\r\n  its responses to discovery.Â  We address the trial court's first factor\r\n  separately below.Â  The trial court's second factor, a conflict between trial\r\n  testimony and information in the QAC file, was beyond the scope of the trial\r\n  court's authority on remand.Â  See Basnight, 346 S.C. at 250-51,\r\n  551 S.E.2d at 279 (&quot;[A] trial court has no authority to exceed the mandate\r\n  of the appellate court on remand.&quot;).Â  Following Hospital's First Appeal,\r\n  this court instructed the trial court to &quot;set forth the evidence in the\r\n  [QAC] file that is subject to discovery and . . . explain why, consistent with\r\n  the language in this Court's prior opinion, this evidence 'is not protected by\r\n  the confidentiality statute.'&quot;Â  Prince, Op. No. 2008-UP-139 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 3,\r\n  2008).Â  By comparing documents in the QAC file with trial testimony, the trial\r\n  court impermissibly exceeded the scope of its authority.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Prince's arguments to the contrary are unpersuasive.Â  A court may not, as he\r\n  argues, exceed its authority and assume the role of a second jury.Â  Rather, the\r\n  appellate court's instructions circumscribe the trial court's authority on\r\n  remand.Â  Basnight, 346 S.C. at 250-51, 551 S.E.2d at 279.Â  The trial\r\n  court's duty is to follow the instructions it received from the appellate\r\n  court.Â  Ackerman, 324 S.C. at 443, 477 S.E.2d at 268.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court's third factor, Hospital's apparent use of documents from the QAC\r\n  file in answering discovery, was not properly before the trial court on\r\n  remand.Â  &quot;Matters decided by the appellate court cannot be reheard,\r\n  reconsidered, or relitigated in the trial court, even under the guise of a\r\n  different form.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In essence, the trial court found Hospital\r\n  waived any statutory confidentiality by utilizing these documents to prepare\r\n  discovery responses.Â  However, in Hospital's First Appeal, this court found no\r\n  issue regarding waiver had been preserved and appealed.Â  Prince, Op. No. 2008-UP-139 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 3,\r\n  2008).Â  Specifically, our opinion\r\n  expressly disagreed with the trial court's holding that the issue of waiver was\r\n  necessarily so intertwined with the issue of confidentiality as to require\r\n  concurrent consideration.Â  Instead, we held that &quot;the remand instructions\r\n  did not authorize the trial court to consider whether Hospital had waived its\r\n  right to assert the file was confidential.&quot;Â  Prince did not seek review of\r\n  this finding by our supreme court, and the boundaries of the trial court's\r\n  authority on remand did not permit it to contemplate waiver arguments.Â  See Ables v. Gladden, 378 S.C. 558, 569, 664 S.E.2d 442, 448 (2008) (holding\r\n  an unappealed ruling is the law of the case).Â  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n  erred in considering Prince's waiver argument.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Analysis\r\n  of the QAC File's Contents in Light of the Statute\r\nOn\r\n  remand following Hospital's First Appeal, this court directed the trial court\r\n  to determine whether and, if so, why any documents in the QAC file were\r\n  discoverable under section 40-71-20.Â  The trial court based the first factor it\r\n  used in reviewing the contents of the QAC file on section 40-71-20.Â  Hospital\r\n  originally argued on appeal that the\r\n  trial court erred by misapplying section 40-71-20. Â We agree.Â  \r\nHospital\r\n  medical staff on a committee conducting peer reviews of patient medical and\r\n  health records are protected from tort liability for their work if they &quot;act[]\r\n  without malice, [make] a reasonable effort to obtain the facts relating to the\r\n  matter under consideration, and act[] in the belief that the action [they take]\r\n  is warranted by the facts known to [them].&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-10(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).Â  Both the information they collect and any investigative\r\n  documents they generate are confidential:Â  \r\n\r\nAll\r\n  proceedings of and all data and information acquired by the committee referred\r\n  to in [s]ection 40-71-10 in the exercise of its duties are confidential unless\r\n  a respondent in the proceeding requests in writing that they be made public. Â These\r\n  proceedings and documents are not subject to discovery, subpoena, or\r\n  introduction into evidence in any civil action except upon appeal from the\r\n  committee action. Â Information, documents, or records which are otherwise\r\n  available from original sources are not immune from discovery or use in a civil\r\n  action merely because they were presented during the committee proceedings, nor\r\n  shall any complainant or witness before the committee be prevented from testifying\r\n  in a civil action as to matters of which he has knowledge apart from the\r\n  committee proceedings or revealing such matters to third persons.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-20(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2009).[6]Â \r\n  Our supreme court has examined this statute and found the General Assembly\r\n  intended it to: \r\n[E]ncourage\r\n  health care professionals to monitor the competency and professional conduct of\r\n  their peers to safeguard and improve the quality of patient care. Â The\r\n  underlying purpose behind the confidentiality statute is not to facilitate the\r\n  prosecution of civil actions, but to promote complete candor and open\r\n  discussion among participants in the peer review process. . . .Â  We find that\r\n  the public interest in candid professional peer review proceedings should\r\n  prevail over the litigant's need for information from the most convenient\r\n  source. \r\nMcGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 312 S.C. 58, 61-62, 439 S.E.2d 257, 259-260 (1993)\r\n  (internal citations omitted); accord Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C.\r\n  639, 646, 602 S.E.2d 760, 763 (2004).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court's misconstruction of this law supports our decision to reverse as\r\n  well.Â  Following Prince's Appeal, this court instructed the trial court to\r\n  &quot;conduct an in camera review of the [QAC] file . . . [and] decide whether\r\n  the file warrants confidentiality.&quot;Â  Prince v. Beaufort Mem. Hosp.,\r\n  Op. No. 2005-UP-602 (S.C. Ct. App. refiled Apr. 11, 2006).Â  Following\r\n  Hospital's First Appeal, this court instructed the trial court &quot;to set\r\n  forth the evidence in the [QAC] file that is subject to discovery and to\r\n  explain why, consistent with the language in this Court's prior opinion, this\r\n  evidence 'is not protected by the confidentiality statute.'&quot;Â  Prince v.\r\n    Beaufort Mem. Hosp., Op. No. 2008-UP-139 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 3,\r\n  2008).Â  In each case, this court predicated the trial court's order of a new\r\n  trial upon its findings concerning confidentiality and the relevance of any QAC\r\n  information deemed not confidential.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  court found that the QAC met the qualifications for protection under section\r\n  40-71-10 and that &quot;Prince failed to appeal the trial court's refusal to\r\n  consider his argument that Hospital had waived its protection under section\r\n  40-71-20.&quot;Â  See id.Â  Neither party appealed these rulings.Â \r\n  Therefore, these determinations are the law of the case.Â  See Ables,\r\n  378 S.C. at 569, 664 S.E.2d at 448 (holding an unappealed ruling is the law of\r\n  the case).Â  Â Section 40-71-10 establishes ground rules for the conduct of the\r\n  QAC members in performing their duties.Â  Section 40-71-20 confers\r\n  confidentiality upon information gathered by the QAC &quot;in the exercise of\r\n  its duties.&quot;Â  \r\nDespite\r\n  this court's instructions upon remand, the trial court omitted any evaluation\r\n  of Hospital's claims of confidentiality in light of these provisions.Â Â  The\r\n  trial court failed to make any finding of fact whether the QAC had acquired the\r\n  documents in its file &quot;in the\r\n  exercise of its duties.&quot;Â  See Â§ 40-71-20(A).Â  Neither did the trial court evaluate whether, in assembling the\r\n  information in this file, the QAC members &quot;act[ed]\r\n  without malice, [] made a reasonable effort to obtain the facts relating to the\r\n  matter under consideration, and act[ed] in the belief that the action [they\r\n  took was] warranted by the facts known to [them].&quot;Â  See Â§&nbsp;40-71-10(B).Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred by failing to conduct\r\n  the analysis directed by this court prior to unsealing the QAC file and\r\n  ordering a new trial.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court's first factor represents a misapplication of section 40-71-20(A).Â \r\n  Section 40-71-20(A) establishes confidentiality for information gathered by the\r\n  QAC in the performance of its duties.Â  However, it excepts from this coverage\r\n  information that is &quot;otherwise available from original sources.&quot;Â  In\r\n  examining this provision, our supreme court stated:Â  &quot;the statute does not\r\n  protect information if obtained from alternative sources. Â Hence, the\r\n  plaintiff seeking discovery cannot obtain documents which are available from\r\n  the original source directly from the hospital committee, but may seek them\r\n  from alternative sources.&quot;Â  McGee, 312 S.C. at 62-63, 439 S.E.2d at 260 (emphasis added).Â  Here, the trial\r\n  court held the documents within the QAC file were not confidential because\r\n  Prince could obtain the information within them from the original sources.Â \r\n  According to our supreme court, this interpretation is incorrect.Â  While\r\n  documents prepared by the QAC remain confidential, Prince is free to obtain the\r\n  information within them from the original sources.Â  To the extent the QAC\r\n  obtained documents from other sources during the course of its investigation,\r\n  Prince may seek copies of those documents from the original sources but not\r\n  from the QAC file.Â  See id.Â  Consequently, the trial court\r\n  misinterpreted and misapplied section 40-71-20.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  summary, the trial court based its ruling upon a comparison of evidence beyond\r\n  the scope of its authority on remand, an argument this court previously held was\r\n  not properly before the trial court, and a misconstruction of section\r\n  40-71-20.Â  Accordingly, we find the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  ordering the QAC file disclosed.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; New Trial \r\nHospital\r\n  next argues the trial court erred in granting a new trial based upon a conflict\r\n  in evidence.Â  We decline to reach this issue.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues when its determination of a\r\n  prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).Â  The trial court's decision to disclose the QAC\r\n  file was the sole basis for granting a new trial.Â  Our reversal herein of the\r\n  trial court's decision to disclose the QAC file removes that basis.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Prince's Remaining\r\n  Arguments\r\nPrince\r\n  advances a number of arguments in his Supplemental Brief and, in a prayer for\r\n  relief contained in the conclusion of that brief, seeks additional sanctions\r\n  against Hospital.Â  For the reasons outlined below, we decline to address these\r\n  arguments and requests.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  decline to address Prince's request for his costs on appeal as premature.Â  See Rule 222(d), SCACR (requiring a party seeking costs to file his motion for\r\n  costs within fifteen days of the issuance of the remittitur).Â  Consequently,\r\n  this request is not properly before the court.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  decline to address Prince's remaining issues, including attorney's fees for\r\n  work performed at the trial level, as unpreserved.Â  &quot;It is axiomatic that\r\n  an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been\r\n  raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate\r\n  review.&quot;Â  Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731,\r\n  733 (1998).Â  Because Prince failed to procure a ruling from the trial court on\r\n  any of these issues, they are unpreserved for appellate review.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we reverse the trial court's decision disclosing the QAC\r\n  file and granting Prince a new trial.Â  We reinstate the decision of Judge\r\n  Gregory.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTHOMAS, J., concurs.Â  \r\nFEW,\r\n  C.J., concurring:Â  I concur in the majority's reasoning and conclusion\r\n  that the QAC file meets the criteria for confidentiality under the peer-review\r\n  privilege found in sections 40-71-10 and -20.Â  That question is resolved, and\r\n  no further inquiry into the QAC file's confidentiality under these sections is\r\n  necessary.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  this third appeal brings before our court for the first time a document\r\n  contained in the QAC file, item 15.Â  Item 15 is a series of notes made by the\r\n  Hospital risk manager from interviews with Nurse Jennifer Emerick and others,\r\n  including the statements that Nurse Emerick was afraid of Prince and thought he\r\n  was at risk for elopement.[7]Â \r\n  While the document on which the statements are recorded is protected from\r\n  disclosure under the peer-review privilege, the statements themselves are not.Â  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Sys., 312 S.C. 58, 62, 439 S.E.2d 257, 260 (1993)\r\n  (holding peer-review &quot;statute does not protect information if obtained\r\n  from alternative sources&quot;).Â  \r\nI\r\n  have substantial concerns about what should be done with this newly discovered\r\n  evidence.Â  The statements, which were revealed to the trial court only after\r\n  remand from Prince's appeal, served as the basis for the trial court's June 22,\r\n  2006 order that the peer-review privilege had been waived.Â  However, the order\r\n  did not contain the content of item 15.[8]Â \r\n  The record on the appeal from that order also did not contain the content of\r\n  item 15.Â  Therefore, this court did not know what the trial court knew when we\r\n  reversed the finding of waiver and remanded again for the trial court to\r\n  examine the validity of the peer-review privilege.Â  The trial court's December\r\n  1, 2008 order, however, does reveal the content of item 15.Â  The order\r\n  demonstrates that the reason the trial court exceeded the mandate from this\r\n  court was the trial court's concern over how to handle the troubling revelation\r\n  of item 15.Â  Because I share the trial court's concern, I write separately to\r\n  address it.\r\nThe\r\n  central issue in this case is whether Hospital knew or reasonably should have\r\n  known that Prince posed a danger to himself, and in particular whether Hospital\r\n  was on notice of any reasonable likelihood of elopement.Â  Nurse Emerick's\r\n  statements recorded in item 15 relate directly to that central issue.Â  In\r\n  pretrial discovery, Prince served Hospital with an interrogatory almost\r\n  identical to the standard interrogatory set forth in Rule 33(b)(7), SCRCP.Â  In\r\n  response to the interrogatory, Hospital gave a detailed account of Nurse\r\n  Emerick's involvement with and her observations of Prince.Â  The interrogatory\r\n  answer does not mention Nurse Emerick being afraid of Prince nor any thought\r\n  that he was at risk for elopement.[9]Â \r\n  Prince later took Nurse Emerick's deposition, which was published at trial, in\r\n  which counsel asked her a series of questions about her observations of Prince\r\n  and what concerns she had for his safety in the hours leading up to his fall.Â \r\n  The questions repeatedly put Nurse Emerick to the task of explaining what she\r\n  observed and what conclusions she reached in relation to the risk that Prince\r\n  might harm himself by leaving the hospital room without authorization.Â  In\r\n  response to these questions, Nurse Emerick did not disclose that she was afraid\r\n  of Prince or that she thought he was at risk for elopement.Â  In fact, she\r\n  specifically stated &quot;he wasn't threatening himself or the staff,&quot; and\r\n  &quot;he was not a threat to me or my staff and himself.&quot;Â  During the portion\r\n  of the deposition in which counsel for Hospital questioned Nurse Emerick, which\r\n  also was published at trial, the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  And you testified earlier that if you thought\r\n  that he was a danger to you or the staff or anybody else, then you would have\r\n  called security?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Yes.\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  If nothing else, for your own protection?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Right.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *\r\n  * *\r\nQ:Â Â Â Â Â  Did you think he was a danger to himself or\r\n  others when you left the room â€“ I'm sorry.Â  You didn't think that he was a\r\n  danger to himself or others, and so you left the room?\r\nA:Â Â Â Â Â  Correct. \r\n\r\nNurse\r\n  Emerick's answers to these questions are not consistent with the statement she\r\n  previously gave to the Hospital risk manager, as recorded in item 15: &quot;Was\r\n  a little afraid of him.Â  Thought he was at risk for elopement.&quot;Â  In the\r\n  December 1, 2008 order, the trial court called the inconsistency &quot;most\r\n  troubling.&quot;Â  The trial court went on to explain:\r\n\r\nNever\r\n  was the Plaintiff made aware that the note the Risk Manager . . . [made] from\r\n  her interview, indicated that Nurse Emerick: &quot;Was a little afraid of him.Â \r\n  Thought he was at risk for elopement.&quot;Â  Nevertheless, everything else\r\n  addressed in that note was disclosed to the Plaintiff in the defendants'\r\n  Answers to Interrogatories . . . .Â  \r\n\r\nAfter referring to several\r\n  authorities on the importance of the disclosure of information relating to\r\n  witness credibility, the trial court stated:\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  instant case is not one where it is just &quot;the litigant's need for\r\n  information from the most convenient source,&quot; McGee v. Bruce Hosp.,\r\n    supra (emphasis supplied).Â  As the Court of Appeals recognized,\r\n  &quot;Prince had no memory of the incident, and the only investigative body was\r\n  the Hospital, a naturally biased entity.&quot;[[10]]Â \r\n  Therefore, the Hospital and its investigators â€“ who &quot;acquired&quot; the\r\n  information and have sought the protection of the statutory privilege â€“ are the\r\n  only source of information as to what occurred the night of the subject\r\n  incident. \r\n\r\nI share the trial court's\r\n  concern.Â  The peer-review privilege under sections 40-71-10 and -20 protects\r\n  only the documents in the peer-review file.Â  The existence of a valid privilege\r\n  does not permit counsel to remain silent when the privilege has protected from\r\n  disclosure the only evidence available that a witness has testified\r\n  untruthfully.Â  The peer-review privilege was never intended to allow a party to\r\n  conceal that a witness has testified untruthfully on the central issue in a\r\n  case.\r\nThe\r\n  issue before this court in this third appeal is a narrow one.Â  The panel has\r\n  determined that the legal consequences of the newly discovered evidence I have\r\n  discussed above, and in particular the answer to the second question we\r\n  instructed the parties to brief after oral arguments, are beyond the scope of\r\n  this appeal.Â  These consequences must be addressed, if at all, in a separate\r\n  proceeding before the circuit court under Rule 60(b)(2), SCRCP.Â  However, I am\r\n  sufficiently troubled by what I have seen that I could not let these facts go\r\n  unnoted, nor my concern over these events unspoken.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] According to Judge Alexander S. Macaulay's order\r\n  dated November 22, 2008, Judges Jackson V. Gregory and Curtis L. Coltrane declared\r\n  documents from the QAC file confidential in five separate orders.Â  Judge\r\n  Macaulay authored the orders from which appeal was taken in this case.Â  \r\n[2] In 2005, the General Assembly enacted section\r\n  40-71-30 of the South Carolina Code, which provides for the trial court to\r\n  conduct an in camera review of any documents a party claims are confidential\r\n  under section 40-71-10 and -20.Â  \r\n[3] The trial court cited to State v. Cabrera-Pena,\r\n  361 S.C. 372, 378, 605 S.E.2d 522, 525 (2004) (recognizing introduction of\r\n  defendant's incriminating statements to police officer required that\r\n  defendant's remaining statements be considered for purposes of explanation or\r\n  qualification).Â  In addition, the trial court pointed to Rule 106, SCRE\r\n  (permitting an adverse party, upon introduction of a writing or statement, to\r\n  require introduction of any other writing that should &quot;in fairness . . . be\r\n  considered contemporaneously with it&quot;), and Rule 32(a)(4), SCRCP (permitting\r\n  introduction of additional deposition testimony at trial to ensure fairness\r\n  when a party initially offers only part of the testimony).\r\n[4] The trial court identified the document as Item 15,\r\n  &quot;Handwritten Notes: (Mary Dent, Jennifer Emerick, chronology of that\r\n  night)[2 pages].&quot;Â  In its order dated November 22, 2008, the trial court\r\n  enumerated and described the twenty-two documents contained in the QAC file.Â  \r\n[5] The trial court's clerk's office misplaced the\r\n  original QAC file, and Hospital replaced it with a copy.Â  Later, the trial court\r\n  located the original QAC file.Â Â Â  \r\n[6] The current version of subsection (A) differs little\r\n  from the entirety of the statute in effect at the time of trial.Â  The\r\n  amendments do not affect the disposition of this appeal.Â  The version in effect\r\n  at trial, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-20 (Supp. 2004), provided:Â  \r\n\r\nAll proceedings of and\r\n  all data and information acquired by the committee referred to in [s]ection\r\n  40-71-10 in the exercise of its duties are confidential unless a respondent in\r\n  the proceeding requests in writing that they be made public. Â These proceedings\r\n  and documents are not subject to discovery, subpoena, or introduction into\r\n  evidence in any civil action except upon appeal from the committee action. Â Information,\r\n  documents, or records which are otherwise available from original sources are\r\n  not immune from discovery or use in a civil action merely because they were\r\n  presented during the committee proceedings nor shall any complainant or witness\r\n  before the committee be prevented from testifying in a civil action as to\r\n  matters of which he has knowledge apart from the committee proceedings or\r\n  revealing such matters to third persons. Â Confidentiality provisions do not\r\n  prevent committees appointed by the Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control from issuing reports containing solely nonidentifying data and\r\n  information.\r\n\r\n[7] &quot;Elopement,&quot; as the trial court noted in a\r\n  footnote to its December 1, 2008 order, is defined as an &quot;attempt to exit\r\n  a facility unaccompanied.&quot;Â  Kelly J.

Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-10 to\r\n  -360 (2008 &amp; Supp. 2010) (the Act).Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n In 2004, Coffin\r\n  Point submitted an application for a permit to build a community dock on Coffin\r\n  Creek in Beaufort County.Â  A drawing attached to the application showed that\r\n  the proposed dock would be located twenty feet from the extended property line\r\n  between Coffin Point's property and the property of Respondent George White\r\n  (White), who maintained a commercial dock for shrimpers to buy fuel and ice.Â \r\n  The drawing depicted the extended property line as a straight line extension of\r\n  the high ground property line.Â  OCRM then issued a permit that included the\r\n  drawing of the proposed dock.Â  After Coffin Point built the dock so that it\r\n  crossed White's extended property line, White sought OCRM's assistance in\r\n  enforcing the permit as written.Â  \r\nOCRM contacted\r\n  Coffin Point and ultimately determined that the dock was built in compliance\r\n  with the permit &quot;as the [attached] drawing was intended to be\r\n  interpreted.&quot;Â  OCRM advised Coffin Point to submit an &quot;after-the-fact\r\n  permit amendment request.&quot;Â  Coffin Point submitted the request along with\r\n  an &quot;as-built&quot; survey.Â  The survey purports to show an extended\r\n  property line, but rather than a straight line extension of the high ground\r\n  property line, the survey shows a line extending into the creek at a forty-five\r\n  degree angle.Â  OCRM then amended the original permit to authorize &quot;the\r\n  existing after-the-fact community dock alignment in accordance with the\r\n  submitted survey.&quot;Â  White sought a contested case hearing to challenge the\r\n  permit as amended.Â  \r\n The ALJ issued a\r\n  written order requiring Coffin Point to rebuild its dock in accordance with the\r\n  permit as originally issued.Â  The ALJ later issued an amended order to correct\r\n  a clerical error in the original order.Â  This appeal followed. Â \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Does this court have jurisdiction over Coffin Point's\r\n  appeal when it served the notice of appeal over thirty days after OCRM sent the\r\n  ALJ's order to Coffin Point by electronic mail?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the ALJ err in interpreting the term\r\n  &quot;navigation&quot; before concluding that the location of Coffin Point's\r\n  dock constituted a significant navigational hazard?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the ALJ err in concluding that the location of\r\n  Coffin Point's dock constituted a material harm to the policies of the Act?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act, the ALJ presides as the\r\n  fact-finder in contested cases.Â  Hill v. S.C. Dep't of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 389 S.C. 1, 9, 698 S.E.2d 612, 616&nbsp;(2010). Â &quot;[T]his\r\n  Court's [review] is limited to determining whether the findings were supported\r\n  by substantial evidence or were controlled by an error of\r\n    law.&quot;Â  Id. at 9, 698 S.E.2d at 617. Â &quot;In\r\n  determining whether the ALJ's decision was supported by substantial evidence,\r\n  this Court need only find, looking at the entire record on appeal, evidence\r\n  from which reasonable minds could\r\n  reach the same conclusion that the ALJ reached.&quot;Â  Id. at 9-10, 698\r\n  S.E.2d at 617.Â  &quot;The mere possibility of drawing two inconsistent\r\n  conclusions from the evidence does not prevent a finding from being supported\r\n  by substantial evidence.&quot; Â Id.\r\n&nbsp;LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Appellate Jurisdiction\r\nRule\r\n  203(b)(6), SCACR, provides that when a\r\n  statute allows a decision of the ALC to be appealed directly to this court, the\r\n  notice of appeal must be served on the agency, the ALC, and all parties of\r\n  record within thirty days after &quot;receipt of the decision.&quot;Â  Here,\r\n  Coffin Point served the Notice of Appeal on March 12, 2009.Â  White argues that\r\n  Coffin Point received the ALJ's January 28, 2009 decision on February 9, 2009,\r\n  when OCRM's counsel e-mailed a signed and filed copy of the decision to Coffin\r\n  Point's counsel.Â  White notes that Coffin Point's counsel responded by e-mail the\r\n  same day (February 9th) and outlined his initial thoughts on the\r\n  decision, thus showing that counsel received the decision on this date.Â  A\r\n  Coffin Point representative then responded to both counsel pointing out a\r\n  clerical error in the ALJ's decision.Â  \r\nCoffin\r\n  Point's counsel does not deny receiving the e-mail transmission of the ALJ's\r\n  January 28, 2009 decision.Â  Rather, counsel maintains that Rule 203(b)(6)\r\n  contemplates receipt of the decision through proper service by mail or hand\r\n  delivery and that the applicable rules do not authorize service of the decision\r\n  by e-mail.[2]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the thirty-day period in which to file a notice of appeal did not\r\n  commence on the day that counsel received the decision via e-mail.Â  We agree.\r\nWhile\r\n  we have found no South Carolina case law discussing the application of Rule\r\n  203(b)(6) to the precise set of facts present in this case, this court's\r\n  opinion in Trowell v.\r\n    South Carolina Department of Public Safety is instructive.Â  384 S.C. 232, 681 S.E.2d 893&nbsp;(Ct.\r\n  App. 2009).Â  In Trowell, this court declined to hold that the facsimile\r\n  of an agency's final decision regarding an employee grievance constituted\r\n  proper service for the purpose of initiating the time frame in which the\r\n  employee had to file his appeal.Â  384 S.C. at 235-37, 681 S.E.2d at 895-96.Â  The\r\n  court noted that the Department of Public Safety's interpretation of its\r\n  grievance procedure created a rule that it had never before employed or sought\r\n  to enforce.Â  Id. at 236, 681 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The court further noted\r\n  that such a rule was not included in any written materials or guidelines\r\n  available to the public or the bar.Â  Id. at 236-37, 681 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The\r\n  court observed that the Department's decision &quot;arbitrarily created a trap\r\n  for the unwary petitioner.&quot;Â  Id. at 237, 681 S.E.2d at 896.Â  The\r\n  court held that the employee's substantial rights were prejudiced due to the\r\n  arbitrary and capricious nature of the Department's interpretation of its\r\n  grievance procedure.Â  Id. at 237, 681 S.E.2d at 896.\r\nHere,\r\n  there is nothing in the current applicable rules that authorizes service of a\r\n  decision of the ALC by electronic mail.[3]Â \r\n  Hence, the circumstances of this case are analogous to those in Trowell.Â \r\n  Prior to the time that Coffin Point filed its appeal in 2009, there\r\n  was no official written rule\r\n  or notice about the binding effect of the\r\n  service of an order by electronic mail.Â  Therefore, due process does not allow\r\n  this court to recognize such service in applying Rule 203(b)(6), SCACR, to\r\n  determine the timeliness of the appeal in this case.Â  Cf. State v. Collins, 329 S.C. 23, 28 n.4, 495 S.E.2d 202, 205\r\n  n.4&nbsp;(1998) (recognizing that although the ex post facto clause itself does\r\n  not apply to actions of the judicial branch, judicial decisions applied\r\n  retroactively can violate the Due Process Clause and that an unforeseeable\r\n  judicial enlargement of a criminal statute, applied retroactively, &quot;operates\r\n  precisely like an ex post facto law&quot;).Â Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  ALC Rules 5 and 29(C) contemplate service of an ALC decision by the ALC via the United States Postal Service and not by a party via electronic mail.[4]Â \r\n  White relies on the opinions in Ackerman v. 3-V Chemical, Inc., 349 S.C. 212, 562 S.E.2d 613&nbsp;(2002), and Canal\r\n    Insurance Co. v. Caldwell, 338 S.C. 1, 524 S.E.2d 416&nbsp;(Ct. App.&nbsp;1999),&nbsp;in\r\n  support of his assertion that service of the decision by DHEC's counsel was a\r\n  proper substitute for service by the ALC.Â  However, those cases involved a\r\n  determination of timeliness under Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR, which governs appeals\r\n  from the court of common pleas and designates the commencement of the period in\r\n  which to appeal as &quot;receipt of written notice of entry of the order[.]&quot;Â  Ackerman, 349 S.C. at 215-16, 562 S.E.2d at 615; Canal, 338 S.C.\r\n  at 5-6, 524 S.E.2d at 418.Â  The analyses in both Ackerman and Canal explicitly distinguished the receipt of notice of the entry of an order\r\n  from receipt of the order itself.Â  Id.Â  Receipt of notice was the\r\n  critical event in Ackerman and Canal, whereas receipt of the\r\n  order itself is the critical event under Rule\r\n  203(b)(6), SCACR, in the present case.Â  Therefore, Ackerman and Canal are not instructive\r\n  in analyzing the &quot;receipt&quot; of an ALJ's decision within the meaning of\r\n  Rule 203(b)(6), SCACR.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the motion to dismiss is without merit.Â  \r\nII.&nbsp; Navigation\r\nCoffin\r\n  Point maintains that the ALJ misinterpreted the term &quot;navigation&quot;\r\n  within the meaning of Regulation 30.12(A)(1)(p) of the South Carolina Code\r\n  (Supp. 2010) when she concluded that the location of Coffin Point's dock\r\n  constitutes a significant navigational hazard and thus a &quot;material harm to\r\n  the policies of the Act.&quot;Â  Coffin Point argues that policing disputes\r\n  between neighboring dock owners is not contemplated by the policies of the\r\n  Act.Â  Because members of the public are affected by Coffin Point's dock, this\r\n  case is not a mere dispute between neighboring dock owners. Â Therefore, we\r\n  disagree with Coffin Point's assignment of error.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  White contends that Coffin Point's challenge of the ALJ's interpretation of the\r\n  term &quot;navigation&quot; is not preserved for review because Coffin Point\r\n  did not raise this precise issue in its Prehearing Statement, at the hearing,\r\n  or in its proposed order.Â  We disagree.Â  In her written order, the ALJ ruled\r\n  for the first time on the proposed dock's effect on navigation.Â  She made this\r\n  ruling in the context of addressing whether allowing the proposed dock to cross\r\n  extended property lines would cause material harm to the policies of the Act.Â \r\n  This issue was properly before the ALJ when White sought a contested case\r\n  hearing to challenge the amended permit on the ground that it allowed Coffin\r\n  Point's dock to cross their shared extended property line.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  challenge to the ALJ's interpretation of &quot;navigation&quot; is preserved\r\n  for review.\r\n\r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits of the issue, Regulation 30.12(A)(1)(p) states:\r\n  \r\nNo docks, pierheads or other associated structures will be\r\n  permitted closer than 20 feet from extended property lines with the exception\r\n  of joint use docks shared by two adjoining property owners. However, the\r\n  Department may allow construction closer than 20 feet or over extended property\r\n  lines where there is no material harm to the policies of the Act. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Coffin Point cites the\r\n  case of Dorman v. South\r\n    Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control in support of its argument that policing\r\n  disputes between neighboring dock owners is not within the policies of the\r\n  Act.Â  350 S.C. 159, 171, 565 S.E.2d 119, 126&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2002).Â  Dorman involved objections to a proposed boat dock from neighbors on both sides of the\r\n  applicant's property.Â  350 S.C. at 162-63, 565 S.E.2d at 121.Â  The neighboring\r\n  property owners objected on the grounds that the proposed dock would crowd too\r\n  close to their existing docks and the roof would impinge on their view.Â  350\r\n  S.C. at 163, 565 S.E.2d at 121.Â  This court adopted OCRM's interpretation of\r\n  Regulation 30.12, which included the position that any navigational issue\r\n  between docks is a private property issue.Â  Id. at 171, 565 S.E.2d at\r\n  126.Â  Specifically, the Appellate Panel of OCRM stated &quot;It is not the\r\n  policy of OCRM to police navigational disputes that should be dealt with among\r\n  the adjacent property owners.&quot;Â  Id. at 163, 565 S.E.2d at 121\r\n  (internal quotation marks omitted).Â  This court remanded the case to the ALJ to\r\n  determine whether the permit should be granted in light of OCRM's\r\n  interpretation of Regulation 30.12.Â  Id. at 171-72, 565 S.E.2d at 126.Â  \r\nIn contrast, the present case involves the disruption of a\r\n  commercial enterprise and its customers.Â  The objection lodged by White does\r\n  not involve merely a private dispute with Coffin Point, but also concerns the\r\n  needs of White's customers, who themselves are members of the public, and the\r\n  local shrimping industry in general. Â Unlike Dorman, this case does\r\n  not involve a mere private navigational dispute.Â  Therefore, the ALJ's\r\n  conclusion that the location of Coffin Point's dock presents a significant\r\n  navigational hazard does not conflict with OCRM'S policy of avoiding the regulation\r\n  of private navigational disputes.Â Â Â  &nbsp;\r\nCoffin Point also argues that in interpreting the term\r\n  &quot;navigation,&quot; the ALJ overlooked the public's ability to navigate the\r\n  creek in general and instead focused too narrowly on the inability of White's customers\r\n  to navigate to and from White's dock under specific conditions.Â  The ALJ's\r\n  amended order addresses this point by citing from Chapter III of Part II of the\r\n  Coastal Management Program:Â  &quot;The policies of the Coastal Management\r\n  Program include [the policy that] 'docks and piers will not be approved where\r\n  they interfere with navigation or reasonable public use of the waters.'&quot;Â \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  Because White's customers are members of the public, their\r\n  navigation to and from White's commercial dock to conduct business constitutes\r\n  &quot;reasonable public use of the waters&quot; within the meaning of the\r\n  Coastal Management Program.\r\nEven if the ALJ's interpretation of navigation as used in\r\n  Regulation 30.12 was too broad, the error is harmless and therefore not reversible.Â  See Jensen v. Conrad, 292 S.C. 169,\r\n  172, 355 S.E.2d 291, 293 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding\r\n  that a judgment will not be reversed for insubstantial errors not affecting the\r\n  result).Â  In support of her decision, the ALJ also relied on section 48-39-150(A)(10)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2008), which requires OCRM to consider the extent\r\n  to which the proposed use could affect the value and enjoyment of adjacent\r\n  owners.Â  Further, OCRM representatives admitted that the &quot;policies of the\r\n  Act&quot; included the value and enjoyment of adjacent property owners.Â  Thus,\r\n  the consideration of how the proposed use affects an adjacent property exists\r\n  independently of the requirement that the proposed use not interfere with\r\n  navigation.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Material Harm\r\nCoffin\r\n  Point argues that the evidence does not support the ALJ's conclusion that the\r\n  location of its dock constitutes a material harm to the policies of the Act.Â \r\n  Specifically, Coffin Point maintains that there is no evidence that its dock\r\n  impedes the general public's use of Coffin Creek and that there is no\r\n  substantial evidence that the dock impacts White's business.Â  We believe there\r\n  is substantial evidence of an adverse impact on White's commercial dock and the\r\n  shrimpers who use it, and, therefore, we disagree with Coffin Point's\r\n  assignment of error.\r\nSection 48-39-150(A) requires OCRM to base its evaluation of a\r\n  permit application on its individual merits.Â  In presenting the unique\r\n  circumstances of this case, White\r\n  testified that the number of his customers decreased after Coffin Point's dock\r\n  was built and that there had been a steady decline in gross sales over the past\r\n  five years.Â  Although his profit and loss statements showed what was\r\n  characterized by OCRM's counsel as a &quot;spike&quot; in ice sales in 2007, White\r\n  explained that his former accountant had distorted the numbers (presumably by\r\n  artificially lowering them) for the years prior to 2007 as part of an\r\n  embezzlement scheme.Â  He also added that he gained a new customer in 2007 only\r\n  because that individual had been evicted from his previous facility and no\r\n  longer had ready access to ice.Â  Further, one of White's customers testified\r\n  that he had cut back on the number of his visits to White's dock within the\r\n  past two years.Â  \r\nTwo\r\n  of White's customers also gave testimony on the adverse impact of the location\r\n  of Coffin Point's dock.Â  They explained that the limited amount of space\r\n  between White's dock and Coffin Point's dock, combined with the size of their\r\n  shrimp boats, presented a danger of their boats colliding with the Coffin Point\r\n  dock when they attempted to leave White's dock to exit the creek.[5]Â \r\n  Further, a customer expressed concern over his lack of liability insurance to\r\n  cover such a loss.Â  Significantly, an OCRM official admitted that OCRM staff\r\n  would consider any &quot;significant impact&quot; on a neighboring dock to\r\n  constitute material harm to the policies of the Act.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\n Finally, Coffin\r\n  Point argues that the ALJ erroneously attempted to link the alleged\r\n  navigational hazard to White's business\r\n  in an attempt to show that the Coffin Point dock is a material harm to the\r\n  policies of the Act.Â  However, as stated\r\n  above, section 48-39-150(A)(10) requires OCRM to consider the effect of the\r\n  proposed use on the value and enjoyment of adjacent owners.Â  This consideration\r\n  is independent of OCRM's policies on navigation.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n Accordingly, the\r\n  motion to dismiss is DENIED and the ALJâ€™s order is AFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTHOMAS, PIEPER,\r\n  and GEATHERS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this\r\n  case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] We note that on January 31, 2011, the ALC submitted\r\n  to the General Assembly proposed amendments to the ALC Rules of Procedure that\r\n  would allow for the ALC to serve certain documents, including orders, by\r\n  e-mail.Â  The proposed amendments concern the ability of the ALC to utilize\r\n  service by e-mail in notifying parties of its decisions.Â  However, the proposed\r\n  amendments would not apply to the facts in this case, which involve service by\r\n  a party rather than service by the ALC. \r\n[3] See ALC Rule\r\n  5 (Service by delivery or mail); ALC Rule 29(C) (Contested Case\r\n  Hearings-Decision); Rule 5, SCRCP (Service and Filing); Rule 203(b)(6), SCACR\r\n  (time for service of notice of appeal).\r\n[4] The 2011 proposed amendments to the ALC rules also\r\n  contemplate service by the ALC and not by a party.\r\n[5] White estimated that the distance between the Coffin\r\n  Point dock and his commercial dock is approximately thirty-five feet and that\r\n  the average shrimp boat that visits his dock is seventy feet long.Â  One\r\n  customer testified that he captains an eighty-foot boat.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Hawkins, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam H. Edwards, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKONDUROS,\r\n  J.: The South Carolina Manufactured\r\n  Housing Board[1] (the Board), filed suit to enjoin Angela Chastain from selling manufactured\r\n  homes without a license in violation of a cease and desist order.Â  The Board\r\n  further requested Chastain be fined for the violations.Â  The administrative law\r\n  court (ALC) determined Chastain had not violated the cease and desist order and\r\n  granted summary judgment in her favor.Â  The Board appeals.Â  We affirm the ALC's\r\n  finding that Chastain did not violate the cease and desist order and vacate the\r\n  portions of the ALC's order not necessary to our ruling.\r\nFACTS\r\nChastain\r\n  held a license to sell manufactured homes until she surrendered it in 2002.[2]Â \r\n  In 2003, the Board became aware Chastain might still be involved in the sale of\r\n  manufactured homes and issued a cease and desist order prohibiting such\r\n  conduct.Â  In 2008, the Board brought this suit contending Chastain violated the\r\n  cease and desist order in several respects.Â  First, in 2006, Chastain purchased\r\n  real property to which a manufactured home was attached.Â  She sold that\r\n  property, including the detitled manufactured home, to Steven Hickerson in\r\n  April 2007.[3]Â \r\n  Also in 2006, Chastain purchased a manufactured home in MacGregor Downs Mobile\r\n  Home Park.Â  Her son lived in the home while attending Midlands Technical\r\n  College.Â  After her son vacated the residence, Chastain allowed the Russell\r\n  family, who needed a place to stay, to reside in the home.Â  Meanwhile, Chastain\r\n  purchased another piece of real property that included a manufactured home with\r\n  a retired title. Â Chastain eventually sold this property to the Russells.Â  In\r\n  October 2007, Chastain sold the MacGregor Downs home to another purchaser.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2008, two manufactured homes were offered for sale through the Manufactured\r\n  Housing Global network internet site (MHG network) by &quot;Chastain\r\n  Builders.&quot;Â  Chastain maintained she had not listed the homes for sale and\r\n  testified it could have been her ex-husband who did so because he was familiar\r\n  with how to create such listings.Â  Finally, Chastain offered for sale in the\r\n  Carolina Trader newspaper two pieces of property to which detitled manufactured\r\n  homes were affixed.Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  a hearing, the ALC determined Chastain had not violated the cease and desist\r\n  order because she had not engaged in the act of selling or offering for sale\r\n  manufactured homes that fell within the parameters of the Uniform Standards\r\n  Code for Manufactured Housing, sections 40-29-5 to -380 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code (Supp. 2010) (the Code).Â  The ALC concluded homes with a retired title did\r\n  not fall within the purview of the governing statutes and regulations and\r\n  federal law regarding the regulation of the sale of manufactured housing did\r\n  not preempt state law with respect to the sale of used manufactured homes.Â  The\r\n  ALC declined to address Chastain's argument that the MacGregor Downs home\r\n  involved the sale of a manufactured home acquired for personal use thereby\r\n  bringing it within an exception under the Code.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe standard of review with respect to\r\n  orders on appeal from the ALC is set forth in the Administrative Procedures\r\nAct, section 1-23-610 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).Â  This court may reverse or modify the\r\n  decision of the ALC if its findings, conclusions, or decisions are:\r\n\r\n(a) in violation of constitutional or\r\n  statutory provisions;\r\n(b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n(c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n(d) affected by other error of law;\r\n(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record; or\r\n(f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of\r\n  discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 1-23-610(B).Â  &quot;The court may not substitute its\r\n  judgment for the judgment of the administrative law judge as to the weight of\r\n  the evidence on questions of fact.&quot;Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nChastain urges the ALC's ruling should be affirmed on\r\n  the ground that the MacGregor Downs home was acquired for her personal use as\r\n  contemplated by Regulation 79-12(A)(3) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).\r\n  Â We agree.\r\nA respondent &quot;may raise on appeal any additional reasons the\r\n  appellate court should affirm the lower court's ruling, even if those reasons\r\n  have not been presented to or ruled on by the lower court.&quot;Â  I'On LLC\r\n    v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000).Â \r\n  &quot;The appellate court may review respondent's additional reasons and, if\r\n  convinced it is proper and fair to do so, rely on them or any other reason\r\n  appearing in the record to affirm the lower court's judgment.&quot;Â  Id. at 420, 526 S.E.2d at 723.Â  &quot;The appellate court may affirm any ruling,\r\n  order, decision or judgment upon any ground(s) appearing in the Record on\r\n  Appeal.&quot;Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR. \r\nUnder\r\n  the Code, &quot;[n]o person may engage in the business of selling, wholesale or\r\n  retail, as a manufactured home retail dealer . . . without being licensed by\r\n  the [B]oard.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-29-30(A) (Supp. 2010).Â  A\r\n  '&quot;[m]anufactured home retail dealer' means a person engaged in the\r\n  business of buying, selling, offering for sale, or dealing in manufactured\r\n  homes or offering for display manufactured homes for sale in South\r\n  Carolina.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-29-20(13) (Supp. 2010).Â  A person must\r\n  buy, sell, offer or display for sale, or deal in three or more manufactured\r\n    homes in a twelve-month period to be a &quot;manufactured home retail\r\n  dealer.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe Board\r\n  cites two twelve-month periods in which it alleges Chastain acted as a\r\n  manufactured home retail dealer in violation of the cease and desist order.Â \r\n  First, beginning in April 2007, Chastain sold a detitled manufactured home to\r\n  Hickerson, a detitled manufactured home to Russell, and the MacGregor Downs\r\n  manufactured home.Â  In addition, the Board points to the sale of the MacGregor\r\n  Downs home, the two listings on the MHG network, and the two advertisements in\r\n  the Carolina Trader as violations of the cease and desist order during a\r\n  twelve-month period beginning October 2007.\r\nRegulation\r\n  79-12(A)(3) exempts from the licensing requirement &quot;[p]ersons disposing of\r\n  manufactured homes acquired for personal use, provided that said home is not\r\n  used for the purpose of avoiding the provisions of this Act or\r\n  Regulations.&quot;Â  In this case, Chastain testified she purchased the\r\n  MacGregor Downs home for her son to live in while attending Midlands Technical\r\n  College &quot;because it was right close to [the school].&quot;Â  She further\r\n  testified her son lived in the home for &quot;almost a year, maybe over a year&quot;\r\n  and she paid the electric bill.Â  The Board did not dispute that Chastain's son\r\n  resided in the home or for how long.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the term &quot;personal use&quot; is not defined in the Code, we are persuaded\r\n  by Chastain's argument that the purchase of the manufactured home for her son\r\n  to live in constitutes her acquisition of it for personal use.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  the Board presented no evidence demonstrating Chastain's initial acquisition of\r\n  this home for her son's residence was an attempt to avoid the provision of the\r\n  Code.Â  This conclusion means Chastain's sale of the MacGregor Downs home is not\r\n  included in the total number of sales under section 40-29-20(13).Â  Therefore,\r\n  she did not sell three or more manufactured homes in violation of the cease and\r\n  desist order within the twelve-month period beginning April 2007.Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  the second twelve-month period, beginning October 2007, two of the infractions\r\n  cited by the Board were the offering for sale of two homes on the MHG network.Â \r\n  However, the ALC found the evidence was insufficient to establish Chastain had\r\n  actually listed these homes.Â  The Board does not appeal that finding by the\r\n  ALC.Â  An unappealed ruling is the law of the case.Â  Harris Teeter, Inc. v.\r\n    Moore &amp; Van Allen, PLLC, 390 S.C. 275, 282 n.5, 701 S.E.2d 742, 745 n.5\r\n  (2010).Â  Absent those sales, and excluding the sale of the MacGregor Downs\r\n  home, the Board alleged only two additional violations:Â  the offer for sale of\r\n  two detitled manufactured homes in the Carolina Trader.Â  Consequently, the Board\r\n  has failed to establish Chastain sold or offered for sale three manufactured\r\n  homes as contemplated by section 40-29-20(13) within the second twelve-month\r\n  period beginning October 2007.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing analysis, we affirm the ALC's ultimate ruling that the Board\r\n  failed to establish Chastain violated the cease and desist order.Â  We vacate\r\n  the ALC's order insofar as it addresses the issue of whether a detitled manufactured\r\n  homes is subject to the strictures of the Code.Â  Therefore, the ruling of the ALC\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART AND VACATED IN PART.\r\nHUFF\r\n  and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Board is a\r\n  licensing board under the purview of the South Carolina Department of Labor,\r\n  Licensing, and Regulation.\r\n[2] Chastain\r\n  surrendered her license as part of an agreement to resolve pending federal\r\n  criminal charges against her relating to the manufactured housing business.\r\n[3] A manufactured\r\n  home's title is similar to a vehicle's title until the home is affixed to real property.Â \r\n  Then, the title is retired and the home is &quot;detitled&quot; and treated as\r\n  real property.Â  S.C.

Cate entered an order granting Wife a divorce from Husband.&nbsp; This order incorporated the parties' agreements on the\r\nissues of custody and visitation and decided the remaining contested issues by equitably dividing marital property, awarding alimony and child support, and\r\nordering Husband to pay a portion of Wife's attorney's fees.&nbsp;\r\nWith respect to the home the parties shared, the family court found that although Wife owned it prior to the marriage, the parties transmuted it into marital\r\nproperty.&nbsp; Consequently, the family court determined Husband owned a share of the equity in the home.&nbsp; In its order, the family court recited that\r\nWife submitted an appraisal valuing the home at $225,300 and seven months later, Husband submitted another appraisal valuing the home at $250,000.&nbsp;\r\nSubtracting the outstanding $38,000 mortgage from the lower appraised value, the family court valued the marital home at $187,300.&nbsp; In distributing the\r\nmarital property, the family court stated:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  [Wife] should be given the option of purchasing [Husband]'s remaining equity in the amount of $60,191.02 either by refinancing the marital\r\n  residence, taking out an equity line, or by other independent means within ninety (90) days from the date of the entry of this Final Order.&nbsp; If she is\r\n  unwilling or unable to buy out [Husband]'s equitable share, the marital residence shall be placed on the market with an agreed upon realtor for the sale price\r\n  of at least $225,300[.]&nbsp; [Wife] will continue to remain in the home until it is sold and be responsible for all expenses associated therewith.&nbsp; Once\r\n  it is sold, the parties shall divide the net proceeds so that [Husband] receives 32.14% of the net proceeds but shall not exceed $60,191.02[.]\r\n\r\nThe order was silent as to how the parties should proceed if the home were placed on the market but did not sell.\r\nPost-divorce relations between the parties were acrimonious.&nbsp; In October 2006, Husband filed a rule to show cause against Wife for various reasons,\r\nincluding her refusal to allow Husband's input into the selection of a realtor or determination of a listing price for the marital home.&nbsp; In December 2006,\r\nWife filed a rule to show cause against Husband for several reasons, including his failure to cooperate with the realtor listing the marital home for\r\nsale.&nbsp;\r\nOn April 18, 2007, the parties tried their respective rules to show cause before Judge Frances P. Segars-Andrews.&nbsp; Following the presentation of\r\nevidence, the parties submitted an agreement in which they fully settled the issues pertaining to the rules to show cause.&nbsp; The resulting order of the\r\nfamily court recited and approved this agreement.&nbsp; With regard to the marital home, the family court agreed to select a realtor to list and sell the\r\nhome.&nbsp; Furthermore, according to the agreement:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  The listing Agent shall have the authority to determine the listing price, provided however, the house shall be sold at the highest and best\r\n  price attainable . . . and upon the best terms attainable under current market conditions in a timely fashion and as soon as practicable. . . . If the house\r\n  is not sold or under contract within [a] ninety (90) day period, the parties may agree to continue with said agent, may mutually agree on an alternative agent\r\n  or if they are unable to agree, may return to this Court for further Order in connection with the sale of the family residence.&nbsp;\r\n\r\nJudge Segars-Andrews selected a realtor who listed the home for sale, and Wife executed a listing agreement setting the sale price at $274,000.&nbsp; The\r\nhome did not sell.&nbsp;\r\nIn January 2008, some nine months later, Husband filed a motion for relief seeking an order requiring Wife to purchase his equity in the marital home,\r\nrefinance the home or reduce its selling price, pay him post-judgment interest on the amount of his equity in the home, and pay his attorney's fees related to\r\nthe motion.&nbsp; Following a hearing, Judge Cate entered an order purportedly clarifying the divorce decree to award Husband post-judgment interest at 11.25%\r\nper annum on the amount of his equity in the marital home, renewing the requirement that the home be listed for sale and establishing a plan for determining the\r\nlisting price, and denying attorney's fees to either party.&nbsp; Judge Cate based her decision to award Husband post-judgment interest on the court's authority\r\nto correct clerical errors under Rule 60(a), SCRCP, and upon a finding the terms of the divorce decree addressing Husband's equity in the marital home were\r\nambiguous and required further construction.&nbsp; Judge Cate imposed new requirements for sale of the home pursuant to the contempt order entered by Judge\r\nSegars-Andrews.&nbsp; Specifically, she ordered both parties to enter a six-month listing agreement with a realtor of the family court's selection, set the\r\nhome's initial listing price at $255,550, and required the listing price to be reduced by five percent every sixty-day period the home remained unsold.&nbsp;\r\nShe further required the parties to accept an offer within three percent of the listing price of the property at the time of the offer and authorized both\r\nHusband and Wife to receive &quot;any and all information pertaining to the marketing of the home and potential buyers.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nWife moved for reconsideration, arguing all the issues she now raises on appeal except jurisdiction.&nbsp; The family court summarily denied her\r\nmotion.&nbsp; This appeal followed.&nbsp;\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nMatters concerning interpretation and enforcement of the family court's orders are within the family court's discretion.&nbsp; Arnal v. Fraser, 371\r\nS.C. 512, 520, 641 S.E.2d 419, 423 (2007).&nbsp; An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the family court either lack evidentiary support or are\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.&nbsp; Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. 221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001).&nbsp; When reviewing a decision by the\r\nfamily court, the appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.&nbsp; Ex parte\r\nMorris, 367 S.C. 56, 61, 624 S.E.2d 649, 652&nbsp;(2006).&nbsp; This broad scope of review does not require the appellate court to disregard the findings of\r\nthe family court.&nbsp; Id. at 61-62, 624 S.E.2d at 652.&nbsp;\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Jurisdiction\r\nWife first argues Judge Cate erred in ruling on Husband's motion for relief because Judge Segars-Andrews had specifically reserved jurisdiction over matters\r\ndealing with the sale of the house.&nbsp; We decline to address this issue as unpreserved.&nbsp; An issue not raised to the family court is not preserved for\r\nappellate review.&nbsp; Chastain v. Chastain, 381 S.C. 295, 306, 672 S.E.2d 108, 114 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp; Wife did not raise this issue prior to or\r\nduring the hearing on Husband's motion for relief, nor did she raise it in her motion to reconsider.&nbsp; Furthermore, Wife does not argue on appeal that this\r\nissue implicates subject matter jurisdiction.[1]&nbsp; Consequently, this issue is not properly before this\r\ncourt.&nbsp;\r\nII.&nbsp; Rule 60(a), SCRCP\r\nNext, Wife asserts the family court erred in clarifying the divorce decree under Rule 60(a), SCRCP.&nbsp; We agree.&nbsp;\r\n&quot;The [family] court's order as it affects distribution of marital property shall be a final order not subject to modification except by appeal or remand\r\nfollowing proper appeal.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-620(C) (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; However, an order of the family court may be modified if\r\n&quot;jurisdiction was specifically reserved in the decree or if allowed by statute.&quot;&nbsp; Hayes v. Hayes, 312 S.C. 141, 144, 439 S.E.2d 305, 307\r\n(Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; In addition, Rule 60(a), SCRCP, permits trial courts to correct clerical errors at any time:&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Clerical mistakes in judgments, orders or other parts of the record and errors therein arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the court at\r\n  any time of its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal, leave to\r\n  correct the mistake must be obtained from the appellate court. The ending of a term of court or departure from the circuit shall not operate to deprive the\r\n  trial judge of jurisdiction to correct such mistakes. A party filing a written motion under this rule shall provide a copy of the motion to the judge within\r\n  ten (10) days after the filing of the motion.\r\n\r\nThe family court's correction of clerical errors may not extend to &quot;chang[ing] the scope of the judgment.&quot;&nbsp; Michel v. Michel, 289 S.C.\r\n187, 190, 345 S.E.2d 730, 732 (Ct. App. 1986).&nbsp; &quot;Except for those matters over which a court retains continuing jurisdiction, terms of a final\r\nproperty settlement agreement, once approved, are binding on the parties and the court.&quot; &nbsp;Price v. Price, 325 S.C. 379, 382, 480 S.E.2d 92, 93\r\n(Ct. App. 1996); accord Doran v. Doran, 288 S.C. 477, 478, 343 S.E.2d 618, 619 (1986) (&quot;A trial judge loses jurisdiction to modify an order\r\nafter the term at which it is issued, except for the correction of clerical [errors]. &nbsp;Once the term ends, the order is no longer subject to any amendment\r\nor modification which involves the exercise of judgment or discretion on the merits of the action.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nWe reverse the family court's determination that Rule 60(a), SCRCP, authorized &quot;clarification&quot; of the divorce decree to reclassify Husband's\r\nequitable share of the marital home as an interest-accruing money judgment.&nbsp; Judge Cate's clarification did not amount to correction of a clerical error\r\nsuch as a misspelling, a misplaced decimal, or a miscalculation.&nbsp; Instead, it recharacterized a portion of Husband's award and imposed additional terms\r\nupon the parties that did not exist at the time the divorce decree was entered.&nbsp; Under the divorce decree, Wife's pre-sale purchase of Husband's equity in\r\nthe home was optional.&nbsp; In the event Wife did not exercise this option, both the amount and timing of Husband's recovery of this equity were contingent\r\nupon the sale of the home.&nbsp; In short, both the date Husband's equitable share was due and the amount he would receive, up to $60,191.02, remained\r\nundetermined and contingent upon the sale of the home.&nbsp;\r\nJudge Cate's April 2008 order significantly changed these terms, thereby altering the substance and scope of the judgment.&nbsp; See Michel,\r\n289 S.C. at 190, 345 S.E.2d at 732 (excluding from Rule 60(a) coverage changes that affect &quot;the scope of the judgment&quot;).&nbsp; Instead of Husband\r\nreceiving 32.14% of the home's sale value not to exceed $60,191.02, the April 2008 order establishes a sum certain of $60,191.02.&nbsp; Instead of Husband\r\nreceiving his payment upon sale of the marital home, the April 2008 order made payment to Husband due as of June 9, 2006, with interest accruing\r\nthereafter.&nbsp; Because Judge Cate's ruling modified the substance of the judgment reflected in the divorce decree, the family court erred in finding Rule\r\n60(a) authorized its modifications.&nbsp;\r\nIII.&nbsp; Pricing Scheme for Marital Home\r\nAdditionally, Wife argues the family court erred in clarifying the divorce decree to require automatic reductions in the selling price of the marital\r\nhome.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nThe family court should attempt to end the controversy between the parties by finally severing all entangling legal relationships and placing the parties in\r\na position to begin anew.&nbsp; Roe v. Roe, 311 S.C. 471, 482 n.7, 429 S.E.2d 830, 837 n.7 (Ct. App. 1993).&nbsp; In equitably apportioning marital\r\nproperty, the family court &quot;may order the public or private sale of all or any portion of the marital property upon terms it determines.&quot;&nbsp;\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;20-3-660(A) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added). &nbsp;Furthermore, the family court is authorized to construe and enforce contracts relating\r\nto property involved in a divorce action.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-690 (Supp. 2010).&nbsp; &quot;A court approved divorce settlement must be viewed in\r\naccordance with principles of equity and there is implied in every such agreement a requirement of reasonableness.&quot;&nbsp; Ebert v. Ebert, 320 S.C.\r\n331, 340, 465 S.E.2d 121, 126 (Ct. App. 1995).&nbsp; When the terms of an agreement omit a necessary provision such as the time for performance, a court will\r\nimply a reasonable term.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp;\r\nWe affirm the family court's requirement that the parties sell the home and adhere to a predetermined pricing scheme.&nbsp; Contrary to Wife's argument,\r\nestablishing the terms of the sale is well within the family court's statutory authority.&nbsp; See Â§ 20-3-660(A) (authorizing the family court to\r\nestablish terms for the sale of marital property).&nbsp; In this case, Judge Cate's order establishing a pricing scheme for the marital home merely enforced the\r\nterms of both the divorce decree and the parties' prior agreement reflected in the order entered by Judge Segars-Andrews.&nbsp; In that agreement, the parties\r\nconcurred that &quot;the house shall be sold at the highest and best price attainable . . . and upon the best terms attainable under current market conditions\r\nin a timely fashion and as soon as practicable.&quot;&nbsp; In the event the house failed to sell and they differed on how to proceed, the parties agreed to\r\nseek further guidance from the family court.&nbsp; Husband sought that guidance, and Judge Cate provided it.&nbsp; The pricing scheme Judge Cate established did\r\nnot conflict with the minimum listing price of $225,300 set by the divorce decree[2] and complied with the goals set\r\nout in the parties' subsequent agreement.&nbsp; In light of Wife's failed attempt to sell the home for $274,000, a lower initial listing price with small\r\nperiodic reductions is a reasonable approach to severing this remaining tie between Husband and Wife.&nbsp; Accordingly, the family court did not err.&nbsp;\r\nTo the extent Wife requests &quot;reimbursement for maintaining the marital property,&quot; this issue is unpreserved because she failed to raise it to the\r\nfamily court.&nbsp; See Chastain, 381 S.C. at 306, 672 S.E.2d at 114 (holding an issue not raised to the family court is not preserved for\r\nappellate review).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIV.&nbsp; Remaining Issues\r\nWife further argues the family court erred in clarifying the divorce decree because neither party requested such clarification and because the language of\r\nthe decree was clear and unambiguous.&nbsp; We decline to address these issues because Wife failed to support her arguments with legal authority.&nbsp; See\r\nEaddy v. Smurfit-Stone Container Corp., 355 S.C. 154, 164, 584 S.E.2d 390, 396 (Ct. App. 2003) (&quot;[S]hort, conclusory statements made without\r\nsupporting authority are deemed abandoned on appeal and therefore not preserved for our review.&quot;).&nbsp;\r\nFinally, Wife argues the family court erred in clarifying the divorce decree to award a &quot;monetary judgment&quot; entitling Husband to post-judgment\r\ninterest.&nbsp; Our reversal of the family court's decision on the basis of Rule 60(a), SCRCP, renders consideration of this issue unnecessary.&nbsp; See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues\r\nwhen its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).&nbsp;\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the family court's reclassification of Husband's equity in the marital home as a monetary judgment and the attendant imposition thereon of\r\npost-judgment interest did not constitute the correction of a clerical error under Rule 60(a), SCRCP.&nbsp; Accordingly, we reverse the family court's purported\r\nclarification of the divorce decree as it relates to the monetary judgment and the imposition of post-judgment interest. &nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe find Judge Cate's instructions for selling the marital home were within the family court's discretion and are reasonable.&nbsp; Therefore, we remand this\r\nmatter to the family court for continued supervision of the sale of the marital home.&nbsp;\r\nWe do not reach Wife's remaining issues.&nbsp; We find the issue of Judge Segars-Andrews's reservation of jurisdiction is unpreserved because it was neither\r\nraised to nor ruled upon by the family court.&nbsp; We further find Wife abandoned her remaining issues on appeal by failing to cite to relevant legal authority\r\nin her brief.&nbsp;\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nFEW, C.J., KONDUROS, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[1] This issue concerns jurisdiction, generally, which is bound by preservation rules, and not subject matter\r\njurisdiction, which may be raised at any time.&nbsp; Subject matter jurisdiction refers to the court's &quot;power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\nclass to which the proceedings in question belong.&quot; &nbsp;Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994).&nbsp;\r\n&quot;Numerous cases have held that subject matter jurisdiction is not implicated when the court possesses the power to hear and determine cases of the general\r\nclass to which the proceedings in question belong.&quot;&nbsp; Gainey v. Gainey, 382 S.C. 414, 424, 675 S.E.2d 792, 797 (Ct. App. 2009).&nbsp;\r\n[2] Under Judge Cate's pricing scheme, the listing price would be reduced by five percent every sixty days the\r\nhome remained unsold.&nbsp; With an initial listing price of $255,550, if the home did not sell before the end of the six-month agreement, it would undergo two\r\nsuch price reductions, resulting in a final listing price of $230,634.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
