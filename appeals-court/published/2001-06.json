Robinson, of Liberty, for appellants.\r\n\r\nRobin Stilwell, of Hunter, Tomaszek &amp; Stilwell, of Greenville, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:  James and Jeanette Rhodes brought this action against Bill Gillespie in his\r\nindividual capacity and against Southern Insulation Company seeking actual and punitive\r\ndamages for breach of contract and breach of certain implied warranties.  A jury awarded the\r\nRhodeses actual and punitive damages.  Gillespie and Southern Insulation appeal, arguing the trial\r\ncourt erred in failing to grant their motions for directed verdict as to Gillespie's individual liability\r\nand as to the availability of punitive damages in the breach of contract and breach of implied\r\nwarranty causes of action.  They also contend the trial court erred in submitting an improper\r\nspecial verdict form to the jury.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nBackground Facts/Procedural History\r\n\r\n\r\nGillespie owns and operates Southern Insulation Company.  In July 1992, the Rhodeses contracted\r\nwith Southern Insulation to install vinyl siding on their mobile home and to extend the roof over\r\ntheir kitchen.  The contract price, including finance charges, totaled $10,834.20.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mrs. Rhodes, shortly after workmen installed the siding, she complained to William\r\nMcDonald, Gillespie's stepson and employee, about the siding being \"all wavy looking.\" \r\nMcDonald assured her \"it would settle down.\" The problem with the siding, however, became\r\nworse as it separated from the window casings and pulled apart in other places.  In addition to the\r\nsiding problem, \"the roof bowed up.\"  These problems prompted her to make dozens of telephone\r\ncalls to the company office over the next several months.\r\n\r\nEventually, Gillespie came to the Rhodeses' house and promised to fix the problems but did not. \r\nAfter several more phone calls from Mrs. Rhodes, Gillespie returned to the Rhodeses' house. \r\nUsing profanity, Gillespie once more promised Mrs. Rhodes that he would attend to the problems. \r\nWorkmen later came and tried nailing the siding into place.  In December 1996, Mrs. Rhodes went\r\nto Gillespie's office and discussed with him the problems that they continued to have with the\r\nroofing and siding.  As Mrs. Rhodes left his office, Gillespie \"followed [her] all the way outside\r\ncussing [her].\"  Shortly after that, the Rhodeses instituted this action.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Gillespie testified he had no knowledge of the problems that the Rhodeses were having\r\nwith their home until they filed the instant action. The only complaint Mrs. Rhodes ever made to\r\nhim concerned some shutters that she said had faded.  He went to her house and advised her how\r\nto contact the manufacturer and file a warranty claim with it.\r\n\r\nChris Wimpey, the Rhodeses' expert witness, inspected the home in October 1997.  He set the cost\r\nof all necessary repairs at $11,464.00.\r\n\r\nAt the start of trial, Gillespie moved to strike the Rhodeses' claim for punitive damages on the\r\nground that punitive damages were not recoverable on breach of contract and breach of implied\r\nwarranty causes of action.  The trial court denied the motion.  At the conclusion of all evidence,\r\nGillespie moved for directed verdicts on all counts and reiterated the motion to strike punitive\r\ndamages as unrecoverable.  Additionally, Gillespie moved for a directed verdict as to his\r\nindividual liability.  The trial court denied these motions as well.  The case went to the jury with\r\ninstructions to use special interrogatories to register its verdict.\r\n\r\nThe jury found in favor of the Rhodeses on all causes of action and awarded them $11,464.50 in\r\nactual damages and $27,500.00 in punitive damages.\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nGillespie and Southern Insulation contend the trial court erred in failing to grant their motion for a\r\ndirected verdict as to the unavailability of punitive damages on the breach of implied warranty\r\nclaims.  We agree the trial court should not have submitted the issue of punitive damages to the\r\njury.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code sections 36-2-714 and -715 define what damages a buyer may recover under\r\nthe Uniform Commercial Code for a breach of warranty.  Section 36-2-714 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Where the buyer has accepted goods and given \r\n    notification (subsection (3) of Â§ 36-2-607) he may recover as damages for \r\n    any nonconformity of tender the loss resulting in the ordinary course of events \r\n    from the seller's breach as determined in any manner which is reasonable.\r\n\r\n  (2) The measure of damages for breach of warranty \r\n    is the difference at the time and place of acceptance between the value of \r\n    the goods accepted and the value they would have had if they had been as warranted, \r\n    unless special circumstances show proximate damages of a different amount.\r\n\r\n  (3) In a proper case any incidental and consequential \r\n    damages under the next section (Â§ 36-2-715) may also be recovered. \r\n     (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 36-2-715 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Incidental damages resulting from the seller's breach include expenses reasonably\r\nincurred in inspection, receipt, transportation and care and custody of goods\r\nrightfully rejected, any commercially reasonable charges, expenses or commissions in\r\nconnection with effecting cover and any other reasonable expense incident to the\r\ndelay or other breach.\r\n\r\n(2) Consequential damages resulting from the seller's breach include\r\n\r\n(a) any loss resulting from general or particular requirements and needs of which the\r\nseller at the time of contracting had reason to know and which could not reasonably\r\nbe prevented by cover or otherwise;  and\r\n\r\n(b) injury to person or property proximately resulting from any breach of warranty. (2)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the legislative intent\r\nwhenever possible. (3)  Where a statute is complete, plain, and unambiguous, legislative intent must\r\nbe determined from the language of the statute itself. (4)\r\n\r\nIn our view, the plain language of sections 36-2-714 and 36-2-715 evidences an intent\r\non the part of the legislature to limit damages recoverable for breach of warranty to\r\nactual, incidental, and consequential damages.  Had the legislature intended that\r\npunitive damages be available in breach of warranty cases, they could easily have\r\nincluded a provision providing for the recovery of damages of that kind.\r\n\r\nWe are further convinced the legislature intended to preclude the recovery of\r\npunitive damages in breach of warranty cases by the language of South Carolina\r\nCode section 36-1-106(1), that provides, in part, that \"neither consequential or\r\nspecial nor penal damages may be had except as specifically provided in the act or by\r\nother rule of law.\" (5)  The Uniform Commercial Code does not provide anywhere for\r\ntheir recovery in such cases; nor does some \"other rule of law\" do so.  Indeed, the\r\nofficial comment to section 36-1-106 states that one of the purposes of that section is\r\n\"to make clear that compensatory damages are limited to compensation [and that]\r\n[t]hey do not include  consequential damages or special damages, or penal\r\ndamages.\" (6)\r\n\r\nWe are aware, as noted by the Rhodeses on appeal, that in South Carolina punitive\r\ndamages are available in breach of contract cases where the breach is accompanied\r\nby a fraudulent act. (7)  That, however, is not the case before us here. (8)\r\n\r\nWe therefore reverse the award of punitive damages.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nGillespie next contends the trial court erred in failing to direct a verdict in his favor as to his\r\nindividual liability.  We disagree.  It is uncontested Southern  Insulation was not incorporated at\r\nthe time of the contract.  Gillespie cites no authority indicating owners of unincorporated\r\ncompanies are entitled to protection from individual liability in the same manner as officers of\r\nincorporated entities.  Indeed, the general rule is to the contrary. (9)  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nFinally, Gillespie and Southern Insulation level an attack on the trial court's submission of special\r\ninterrogatories to the jury, arguing the form could have led the jury to believe it could award\r\npunitive damages on either the breach of contract cause of action or the breach of implied\r\nwarranty causes of action.  This argument was not presented in the first instance to the trial court\r\nand, therefore, is not preserved for appellate review. (10)  In any case, because we have vacated the\r\naward of punitive damages, the issue is now moot.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and CONNOR, J., concur.\r\n1.

(Mictronics) filed a request for \r\n  a contested case hearing with the Administrative Law Judge Division (ALJD) claiming \r\n  it was entitled to an exemption from the South Carolina sales and use tax. Mictronics \r\n  filed a prehearing statement as directed by the administrative law judge (ALJ). \r\n  On March 7, 1996, the parties were served with notice of a hearing scheduled \r\n  for May 14.\r\n\r\nDue to a conflict in his schedule, the ALJ rescheduled \r\n  the hearing for May 22 by issuing an order and amended notice of hearing dated \r\n  April 26. Additionally, a member of the ALJ's staff telephoned Mictronics and \r\n  spoke with its president, Thomas Blocker, telling him the hearing was rescheduled. \r\n  Blocker understood the hearing to be rescheduled for June 22 and made a note \r\n  in his file to that effect. DOR's counsel received a similar phone call, but \r\n  understood the rescheduled hearing date to be May 22.\r\n\r\nBecause of Blocker's misunderstanding about the \r\n  date of the rescheduled hearing, Mictronics did not appear at the May 22 hearing. \r\n  The ALJ issued an order dismissing the action with prejudice and treating Mictronics' \r\n  failure to appear at the hearing as a default under Rule 23, SCRALJD. Blocker \r\n  received this order of dismissal and immediately wrote the ALJ stating he had \r\n  mistaken the date of the hearing. Blocker apologized for the mistake and requested \r\n  the matter be reopened with a new hearing date. The ALJ denied this request.\r\n\r\nMictronics appealed the denial of the motion to \r\n  reopen to the circuit court which issued an order remanding the case to the \r\n  ALJD to make findings of fact and draw conclusions of law about whether Mictronics \r\n  should be relieved of its default. Pursuant to the circuit court's order, a \r\n  hearing was held before the ALJ. The ALJ treated Mictronics' request to reopen \r\n  as a motion for reconsideration under Rule 29, SCRALJD, and concluded that Mictronics \r\n  received adequate notice of the hearing and that its failure to attend could \r\n  not be excused based on mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect.\r\n\r\nMictronics again appealed the ALJ's order to the \r\n  circuit court which reversed the ALJ's order and remanded the matter to the \r\n  ALJD for a hearing on the merits. The circuit court found the ALJ abused his \r\n  discretion in applying the excusable neglect standard of Rule 60(b), SCRCP instead \r\n  of the good cause standard referenced in Rule 55(c), SCRCP. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nMictronics appealed to the circuit court only from \r\n  the denial of the motion to reopen, not the underlying dismissal. DOR now appeals \r\n  from the circuit court's reversal of the ALJ's order, arguing the circuit court \r\n  exceeded its authority in reversing the ALJ's order. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAppeals from the ALJD must be conducted according \r\n  to the South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act. See S.C. Code Ann.Â§ \r\n  1-23-380 (Supp. 2000). Section 1-23-380(A)(6) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The court may reverse or modify the decision if \r\n    substantial rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the administrative \r\n    findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are:\r\n\r\n  (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory \r\n    provisions;\r\n    (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n    (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n    (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence \r\n    on the whole record; or\r\n    (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or \r\n    clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). An abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when a court's decision is controlled by an error of law or is without evidentiary \r\n  support. Ledford v. Pennsylvania Life Ins. Co., 267 S.C. 671, 675, 230 \r\n  S.E.2d 900, 902 (1976).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court reversed the ALJ because it thought \r\n  the ALJ applied the wrong standard in considering the motion to reopen. The \r\n  circuit court believed the motion should be governed by Rule 55, SCRCP, rather \r\n  than the more stringent standard required by Rule 60, SCRCP. We disagree.\r\n\r\nInitially, we note the ALJD rules define default \r\n  differently than the rules of civil procedure. Under Rule 23, SCRALJD, default \r\n  occurs when either party fails to prosecute or defend an action. Rule 55 allows \r\n  entry of default against \"a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief \r\n  is sought [that] has failed to plead or otherwise defend.\" In this case, Mictronics \r\n  was the plaintiff and not the defending party as contemplated by Rule 55. Therefore, \r\n  the circuit court erred in instructing the ALJ to reconsider his order applying \r\n  the good cause standard of Rule 55(c).\r\n\r\nAlthough we disagree with the circuit court's logic, \r\n  we agree with its result. This court may affirm for any reason appearing in \r\n  the record pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR, and I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. \r\n  Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 420, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723-24 (2000).\r\n\r\nWe find the motion to reopen falls under Rule 29(D), \r\n  SCRALJD. The relevant portion of this rule reads: \"Any party may move for reconsideration \r\n  of a final decision of an administrative law judge in a contested case, subject \r\n  to the grounds for relief set forth in Rule 60(b)(1 through 5), SCRCP. . . .\" \r\n  The ALJ's order dismissing Mictronics' claim with prejudice was a final order. \r\n  Thus, under the ALJD rules, it appears the only grounds for reconsideration \r\n  are those contained in Rule 60(b), SCRCP. \r\n\r\nNo South Carolina case discusses the Rule 60(b)(1) \r\n  standards as applied to Rule 29(D), SCRALJD. For that reason, we look to cases \r\n  interpreting Rule 60(b) generally. Under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, a party may be \r\n  relieved from a final order for \"mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable \r\n  neglect.\" In determining whether to grant a motion under Rule 60(b), the trial \r\n  judge should consider: (1) the promptness with which relief is sought, (2) the \r\n  reasons for the failure to act promptly, (3) the existence of a meritorious \r\n  defense, and (4) the prejudice to the other party. New Hampshire Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Bey Corp., 312 S.C. 47, 50, 435 S.E.2d 377, 379 (Ct. App. 1993) (quoting \r\n  Harry M. Lightsey &amp; James F. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure \r\n  82 (1985)).\r\n\r\nHere, Mictronics made an error with respect to \r\n  the hearing date and immediately sought relief from the dismissal. In Columbia \r\n  Pools, Inc. v. Galvin, 288 S.C. 59, 339 S.E.2d 524 (Ct. App. 1986), this \r\n  court found that a trial judge abused his discretion in refusing to grant a \r\n  motion to set aside a default judgment granted after an answer was received \r\n  one day late. (1) The court there held that \"where \r\n  there is a good faith mistake of fact, and, no attempt to thwart the judicial \r\n  system, there is basis for relief.\" 288 S.C. at 61, 339 S.E.2d at 525. This \r\n  is consistent with South Carolina's policy favoring the disposition of issues \r\n  on their merits rather than on technicalities. Id.; see also Balloon \r\n  Plantation, Inc. v. Head Balloons, Inc., 303 S.C. 152, 153, 399 S.E.2d 439, \r\n  440 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding sanction dismissing counterclaim too severe). We \r\n  find no evidence in the record that the mistake was anything but a good faith \r\n  error, as shown by Blocker's explanation coupled with his speed in asking the \r\n  ALJ for relief.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it appears that Mictronics had a meritorious \r\n  defense. To establish a meritorious defense, a party is not required to show \r\n  an absolute defense. Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 120, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  900, 903 (1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] meritorious defense need not be perfect nor one which can be guaranteed to prevail at a trial. \r\nIt need be only one which is worthy of a hearing or judicial inquiry because it raises a question of\r\nlaw deserving of some investigation and discussion or a real controversy as to real facts arising\r\nfrom conflicting or doubtful evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nGraham v. Town of Loris, 272 S.C. 442, 453, \r\n  248 S.E.2d 594, 599 (1978). We find Mictronics' prehearing statement outlining \r\n  its tax exemption on certain subcontracts meets the standard for a meritorious \r\n  defense.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the record that DOR will suffer no prejudice should this case proceed for a\r\ndetermination on the merits.  Here, DOR has no substantial stake in this windfall, and the\r\nresolution of the case on its merits has not been substantially delayed by the parties' actions. \r\nGiven Mictronics' good faith mistake, its swift action to try to remedy the situation, the existence\r\nof a meritorious defense, and the lack of prejudice to DOR, we find the ALJ abused his discretion\r\nby refusing to reopen the case.  Therefore, we affirm the circuit court's order reversing the ALJ's\r\ndenial of the motion to reopen and remanding the case to the ALJD for an adjudication on the\r\nmerits. \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.

Brunson, Elizabeth Scott Moise and Susan \r\n          M. Glenn, all of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Columbia; \r\n          Paul F. Hultin and Edward C. Stewart, both of Wheeler, Trigg &amp; Kennedy, \r\n          of Denver, CO, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Ray H. Chewning, \r\n  Jr. filed this action in equity for fraud and for fraud upon the court against \r\n  Ford Motor Company (Ford), David Bickerstaff, and David Bickerstaff and Associates, \r\n  Incorporated (collectively, Defendants), to set aside a judgment in an earlier \r\n  products liability case. The circuit court granted Defendants' motion for judgment \r\n  on the pleadings, concluding the complaint alleged intrinsic fraud which cannot \r\n  serve as the basis for vacating a judgment after more than one year. As an additional \r\n  sustaining ground, the court held Chewning failed to plead fraud with specificity \r\n  as required by Rule 9(b), SCRCP. Chewning appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nIn April 1990, Chewning suffered injuries in a \r\n  rollover crash of his Ford Bronco II. He filed a products liability claim against \r\n  Ford and the car dealership that sold him the automobile. After a sixteen-day \r\n  trial in 1993, a jury returned a verdict in favor of Ford. The trial court denied \r\n  Chewning's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict or a new trial.\r\n\r\nWithin one year of the judgment, Chewning sought \r\n  relief pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1) and (3), SCRCP, on the grounds of newly discovered \r\n  evidence and fraud, alleging Bickerstaff, the former design engineer for Ford's \r\n  Light Truck Engineering Department and one of Ford's witnesses, committed perjury \r\n  during the trial. This motion was denied.\r\n\r\nIn 1998, Chewning brought this independent action, \r\n  asserting several causes of action including fraud upon the court. The Defendants \r\n  removed the case to the United States District Court for South Carolina. The \r\n  district court dismissed all of Chewning's claims except his action for fraud \r\n  upon the court. Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 35 F. Supp. 2d 487 (D.S.C. \r\n  1998). The district court remanded the fraud upon the court claim together with \r\n  \"such other related claims in equity, if any, as the state court may allow to \r\n  be added by amendment.\" Id. at 492.\r\n\r\nChewning refiled his case in the circuit court \r\n  asserting causes of action for fraud upon the court and an independent action \r\n  in equity for fraud. In his amended complaint, Chewning alleged the judgment \r\n  in the original products liability case should be vacated because:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Defendants' and Ford's attorneys knowingly \r\n    purchased and used the false testimony of BICKERSTAFF in favor of FORD during \r\n    FORD'S defense of the BRONCO II CASES and concealed this from Plaintiffs and\r\n\r\n  (2) FORD fraudulently concealed, hid and misrepresented \r\n    to the Plaintiffs and the Courts about the existence and location of documents \r\n    . . . that provide evidence that was favorable to Plaintiffs' cases and evidence \r\n    that FORD knew, or should have known, would harm Plaintiffs' defense. \r\n\r\n\r\nAmong other allegations, Chewning contends Ford \r\n  and its attorneys bought favorable and untruthful testimony from Bickerstaff. \r\n  While at Ford, Bickerstaff criticized the Bronco II and recommended certain \r\n  unimplemented corrective measures. Curiously, when litigation arose concerning \r\n  the Bronco II, Bickerstaff, then a member of an engineering consulting firm, \r\n  agreed to testify as a witness \"in Ford's favor\" in exchange for large sums \r\n  of money. Chewning alleges this scheme persisted through multiple trials and \r\n  depositions until a memo detailing Ford's and Chewning's arrangement was discovered.\r\n\r\nThe Defendants successfully filed a motion to dismiss \r\n  under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nGenerally, a ruling on a motion to dismiss under \r\n  Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, must be based solely on the allegations contained in the \r\n  complaint. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 527, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  69, 73 (1999). \"Viewing the evidence in favor of the plaintiff, the motion must \r\n  be granted if facts alleged in the complaint and inferences reasonably deducible \r\n  therefrom do not entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of the case.\" \r\n  Jarrell v. Petoseed Co., 331 S.C. 207, 209, 500 S.E.2d 793, 794 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  (1)\r\n\r\nChewning argues the circuit court erred in dismissing \r\n  his claim as untimely. We agree. Under Rule 60(b), SCRCP, a party may seek to \r\n  set aside a final judgment for fraud upon the court. This right is independent \r\n  of the Rule 60(b)(3) ground for relief for fraud, misrepresentation, or other \r\n  misconduct by an adverse party. Relief for fraud upon the court is not subject \r\n  to the one year limit placed on relief under Rule 60(b)(3). See H. Lightsey \r\n  &amp; J. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure 407 (2d ed. 1985). \r\n  Therefore, we find the circuit court erred in dismissing Chewning's claim as \r\n  untimely under Rule 60(b)(3).\r\n\r\nChewning also argues the circuit court erred in its application of the law of extrinsic and intrinsic\r\nfraud.  We agree because we find the facts asserted in the amended complaint constitute a valid\r\nclaim for relief for fraud upon the court.  \r\n\r\nFraud upon the court is \"fraud which . . . subvert[s] \r\n  the integrity of the Court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers \r\n  of the court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual \r\n  manner its impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.\" \r\n  Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. App. 1988) \r\n  (emphasis added) (quoting Lightsey &amp; Flanagan, supra, at 408). It \r\n  has also been defined as \"fraud that does, or at least attempts to, defile the \r\n  court itself . . . .\" 12 Moore's Federal Practice Â§ 60.21[4][a] \r\n  (3d. ed. 2000). Historically, after the period to claim relief under Rule 60(b)(1) \r\n  through (3), SCRCP, has expired, courts have required a showing of extrinsic \r\n  fraud to vacate a judgment. See Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, \r\n  430, 529 S.E.2d 714, 717 (2000); Evans, 294 S.C. at 529, 366 S.E.2d at \r\n  46. \r\n\r\nSouth Carolina law maintains a distinction between \r\n  intrinsic and extrinsic fraud. Mr. G v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. 305, 307-08, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 101, 102-03 (Ct. App. 1995) (Hearn, J. dissenting). \"Intrinsic fraud \r\n  refers to fraud presented and considered in the judgment assailed, including \r\n  perjury and forged documents presented at trial.\" Evans, 294 S.C. at \r\n  529, 366 S.E.2d at 46. It is fraud which \"goes to the merits of the prior proceeding \r\n  which the moving party should have guarded against at the time.\" City of \r\n  San Francisco v. Cartagena, 41 Cal. Rptr. 2d 797, 801 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  quoted with approval in Mr. G, 320 S.C. at 308, 465 S.E.2d at \r\n  103. By contrast, extrinsic fraud \"refers to frauds collateral or external to \r\n  the matter tried such as bribery or other misleading acts which prevent the \r\n  movant from presenting all of his case or deprives one of the opportunity to \r\n  be heard.\" Lightsey &amp; Flanagan, supra, at 486; see also Hilton \r\n  Head Ctr., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 \r\n  (1987) (\"Extrinsic fraud is fraud that induces a person not to present a case \r\n  or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.\"). \r\n\r\nHere, Chewning alleges that Ford's attorneys collaborated \r\n  in a deliberate scheme to purchase testimony in a series of cases involving \r\n  Bronco II rollovers. Ordinarily, perjury is intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, \r\n  fraud. Hagy, 339 S.C. at 432, 529 S.E.2d at 718 (2000); Rycroft v. \r\n  Tanguay, 279 S.C. 76, 79, 302 S.E.2d 327, 329 (1983); Corley v. Centennial \r\n  Constr. Co., 247 S.C. 179, 189, 146 S.E.2d 609, 614 (1966). Chewning argues, \r\n  however, that because he alleges Ford's attorneys suborned the perjured testimony, \r\n  it is in fact extrinsic fraud and thus a basis to set aside the underlying verdict. \r\n  We agree.\r\n\r\nThis court has previously refused to carve out \r\n  an attorney fraud exception to the intrinsic/extrinsic fraud rule. Bankers \r\n  Trust Co. v. Braten, 317 S.C. 547, 552, 455 S.E.2d 199, 202 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  However, Chewning's inability to present his full case at trial distinguishes \r\n  this case from Bankers Trust. There, the alleged attorney fraud was discovered \r\n  during the pendency of the original trial, and the falsity of the statement \r\n  in question was argued at the summary judgment stage and on appeal. Id. \r\n  We decline to apply the reasoning of Bankers Trust to this case because \r\n  when the complaint is viewed in the light most favorable to Chewning, it does \r\n  not appear he had the opportunity to litigate the issue of attorney involvement \r\n  in perjury at trial.\r\n\r\nChewning alleges a scheme of perjury and failure \r\n  to produce documents perpetuated by attorneys. In Davis v. Davis, 236 \r\n  S.C. 277, 113 S.E.2d 819 (1960), fraud on the court, specifically distinguished \r\n  from fraud as now contemplated by Rule 60(b)(3), was found where an attorney \r\n  in a divorce action did not file the opposing side's answer and then represented \r\n  to the court that the opposing party was in default. Affirming the trial court's \r\n  decision to vacate the default decree, the court found, \"This reasonably may \r\n  be held to have been extrinsic fraud upon her and upon the court.\" Id. \r\n  at 281, 113 S.E.2d 821. This holding is consistent with attorney disciplinary \r\n  opinions finding attorney misrepresentations to be fraud upon the court. See, \r\n  e.g.,  In re Celsor, 330 S.C. 497, 501, 499 S.E.2d 809, \r\n  811 (1998) (finding improper signature without valid power of attorney, notarization \r\n  of that signature, and misrepresentation to court to be fraud upon the court); \r\n   In re Jennings, 321 S.C. 440, 446, 468 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1996) \r\n  (holding forgery of signature on court document is fraud upon the court). Therefore, \r\n  we find Chewning has alleged sufficient facts to show extrinsic fraud upon the \r\n  court.\r\n\r\nMoreover, federal jurisprudence supports this holding. \r\n  Because Rule 60(b), SCRCP was modeled after Rule 60(b), FRCP, we take instruction \r\n  from federal cases discussing fraud upon the court. The seminal case on this \r\n  topic is Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944). \r\n  In Hazel-Atlas, the Supreme Court set aside a judgment after more than \r\n  one year because it found a party and its attorneys engaged in \"a deliberately \r\n  planned and carefully executed scheme to defraud\" the patent office and the \r\n  circuit court of appeals. Id. at 245. As a result, the Court held it \r\n  would be manifestly unconscionable to allow the judgment to stand. Id. \r\n   \r\n\r\nAlthough perjury alone will not serve to vacate \r\n  a judgment, it is considered fraud upon the court when it involves or is suborned \r\n  by an attorney. See generally Moore's Federal Practice, supra, \r\n  at Â§ 60.21[4][b] &amp; [c]. \"Involvement of an attorney, as an officer of the \r\n  court, in a scheme to suborn perjury would certainly be considered fraud on \r\n  the court.\" Great Coastal Express, Inc. v. Int'l Bhd. of Teamsters, 675 \r\n  F.2d 1349, 1357 (4th Cir. 1982); see also  Meindl v. Genesys Pac. \r\n  Techs., Inc., 204 F.3d 124, 130 (4th Cir.) (\"[F]raud upon the court includes \r\n  fraud by bribing a judge, or tampering with a jury, or fraud by an officer of \r\n  the court, including an attorney.\"); Cleveland Demolition Co. v. Azcon Scrap \r\n  Corp., 827 F.2d 984, 986 (4th Cir. 1987) (\"A verdict may be set aside for \r\n  fraud on the court if an attorney and a witness have conspired to present perjured \r\n  testimony.\"). In Great Coastal, the court did not find fraud upon the \r\n  court because it determined the behavior complained of involved primarily the \r\n  two parties and did not show either a plan to subvert the judicial process or \r\n  a threat of public injury. Here, the complaint alleges an ongoing plot between \r\n  Ford, Ford's attorneys, and a witness to hide the truth in a series of products \r\n  liability cases. If proven, these facts would constitute a scheme resulting \r\n  in harm to the public at large and would result in the type of fraud envisioned \r\n  in Hazel-Atlas and Great Coastal. \r\n\r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, the trial court found that Chewning's amended complaint did\r\nnot satisfy Rule 9(b), SCRCP, because Chewning did not \"identify any alleged perjured testimony\r\nby Bickerstaff in the underlying products liability trial, only subsequent testimony from cases\r\nafter Chewning's.\"  We disagree.  After a careful analysis of the complaint, we find that Chewning\r\ndid plead with specificity that Bickerstaff gave untruthful testimony at Chewning's trial that the\r\nBronco II \"was designed in a safe and reliable manner.\"  Therefore, we find the trial judge erred in\r\nfinding this as an additional sustaining ground. \r\n\r\nIn considering relief from a final judgment, \"the \r\n  balance is drawn between finality of judgments, on the one hand, and preserving \r\n  the court's fundamental purpose of providing a fair and just resolution of disputes, \r\n  on the other.\" Hagy, 331 S.C. at 221, 500 S.E.2d at 172. Based on Davis \r\n  and federal jurisprudence, we find Chewning's complaint states a claim for fraud \r\n  upon the court. If Chewning's allegations are true, it would be manifestly unjust \r\n  for the original judgment to stand. Accordingly, we reverse the circuit judge's \r\n  dismissal order and remand the fraud upon the court claim for proceedings consistent \r\n  with this opinion. \r\n\r\nREVERSED &amp; REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  On appeal, Chewning only \r\n  argues the dismissal of his fraud upon the court action. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3352","title":"Moore v.

Louie E. Moore (\"Moore\") \r\n  was the highest bidder at the foreclosure sale of certain real estate owned \r\n  by Fairfield Real Estate Company, Inc. (\"Fairfield\"), at which time Moore was \r\n  the president and sole shareholder of Fairfield. The referee then announced \r\n  Moore was required to tender his earnest money to the court within fifteen minutes \r\n  of the closing of the first sale. After Moore could not tender his deposit within \r\n  the allotted time limit, the referee re-auctioned the property. Moore objected \r\n  to the second sale and moved to confirm the first sale. Moore's objections were \r\n  denied. Moore appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nCertain property owned by Fairfield \r\n  (1) was foreclosed on by one of Fairfield's mortgagors, Jerry W. Branham. \r\n  (2) By order filed December 18, 1998, the special referee ordered \r\n  the subject property (3) to be sold at public \r\n  sale, with no deficiency judgment requested. The referee stated in the fourth \r\n  paragraph in his judgment order that the sale was:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A. FOR CASH: The Special Referee will \r\n    require a deposit of 5% on the amount of the bid (in cash or equivalent), \r\n    same to be applied on the purchase price only upon compliance with the bid, \r\n    but in the case of non-compliance within 30 days, same to be forfeited and \r\n    applied to the costs and the first mortgage lien.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amended Notice of Sale filed January 27, 1999, \r\n  reiterated the \"terms of sale\" which were, in part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  A. FOR CASH. The Special Referee will require a \r\n    deposit of five (5%) per cent of the amount bid (in cash or equivalent), the \r\n    same to be applied on the purchase price upon compliance with the bid, but \r\n    in case of noncompliance within 30 days after the date of the sale, same to \r\n    be forfeited and applied to costs and the first mortgage lien. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe referee conducted the foreclosure sale on March \r\n  1, 1999. Moore, formerly doing business as Fairfield, Britt Rowe (\"Rowe\"), and \r\n  other bidders attended the sale. Moore offered the highest bid of $96,000 for \r\n  the subject 33.03 acre tract, which was approximately $11,000 more than Rowe's \r\n  second place bid. Upon Moore's being declared the highest bidder, the special \r\n  referee ordered Moore to produce his 5% deposit of $4,800 within five minutes. \r\n  (4) When Moore proffered he could not secure his funding immediately, \r\n  the special referee allowed Moore fifteen minutes to secure the deposit.  \r\nMoore was unable to secure financing within this \r\n  fifteen minute allowance. Moore testified in a subsequent hearing that he was \r\n  unable to reach his financier, Craig McMaster, a member of the board of trustees \r\n  for Community Federal Savings &amp; Loan Association (\"Community\"). Thereafter, \r\n  the referee reopened the bidding without Moore's participation, whereupon Rowe \r\n  offered the highest bid of $84,000. Rowe posted a cashier's check worth 5% of \r\n  his bid with the court within fifteen minutes of the close of the second bidding. \r\n  At approximately 4:30-4:45 p.m. on the day of the sale, Moore posted 5% of his \r\n  bid from the first sale with the Fairfield County Clerk of Court. \r\n\r\nOn March 11, 1999, Moore filed an objection to the \r\nconfirmation of the second sale of the property and moved to confirm the initial \r\nforeclosure sale. A hearing before the referee was held March 25, 1999, in which \r\nMoore's motions were denied by order filed April 22, 1999. Moore moved to alter \r\nor amend the special referee's order on May 3, 1999.  \r\nAt the hearing, the referee waived recitation of \r\n  the facts, stating they were not in dispute and that he knew all the relevant \r\n  facts from participating in the prior case proceedings. Also, the referee admitted \r\n  he treated Moore differently than other bidders on the property because: \r\n\r\n\r\n  [Moore is] the one that's had five years to make \r\n    his payments. He's the one that has not made his payments. He's the reason \r\n    we [were] selling the property.\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional relevant exchanges with the court are \r\n  repeated below: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: Well, again, I don't think that \r\n    [who the bidder was is] an issue that matters. And again, I have a feeling \r\n    that the Court is taking the position that because the bidder happen [sic] \r\n    to be the owner of the property[,] he should be treated more strictly and \r\n    severely than a bidder who is not.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Let me tell you what the facts are \r\n    clearly in this case, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Moore failed to pay three debts of written \r\n    notes. Mr. Moore sold contracts of sale of real estate for the subject property \r\n    that was subject to two mortgages to innocent third parties. In addition to \r\n    that, Mr. Moore sold those contracts and received money from them without \r\n    selling the underlying land or obtain [sic] a release from those mortgages. \r\n    All of that's in the records[,] and in my opinion[,] because of \r\n    that this court has some judgment and discretion as to what time period it's \r\n    going to allow that person, as known through these proceedings \r\n    not outside of anything that took place in this case,  as to what \r\n    I'm going to allow him to come up with the money, what time period \r\n    to come up with the money. Does that sound unreasonable to you? \r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: Your Honor â€¦ it sounds like to \r\n    me you're treating him differently because he is the owner and because he \r\n    is a defaulting borrower.\r\n\r\n  The Court: No, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n  The Court: My concern, I'm not going to keep \r\n    beating a dead horse[,] but â€¦ and this don't need to be on the record. To \r\n    me[,] the whole issue is and I think throughout this circuit,   \r\n    as a referee, right or wrong, you typically exercise \r\n    some discretion in, within the requirements of the deed, making \r\n    that deposit. And I think normally[,] it's everything from when you walk back \r\n    to the attorney's office or you do like Mr. Moore was, how long is it going \r\n    to take you to have the money. I can get it here by such and such. If Mr. \r\n    Moore had had an attorney that would stand as a member of the Bar and indicate \r\n    to me that he had the money and he would have it in my office at 5:00 o'clock[,] \r\n    I don't think we would have been here. But what you, Mr. Jordan, are asking \r\n    me to accept is that here's a man that all along had the full amount, whatever \r\n    he was going to bid, had that money available.   Does it not make \r\n    sense that he would have gone and made arrangements to catch up those two \r\n    mortgages if he would have had the money available to him? I mean, why, if \r\n    he had $98,000.00 he could have brought things current months ago. And I know \r\n    I'm getting beyond what we're hearing today[,] but isn't that just common \r\n    sense.\r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: That's what I'm saying. It appears \r\n    to be some $140,000 worth of â€¦.\r\n\r\n  The Court: That's the principal too. No, sir, he \r\n    could have brought them current. \r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: Well, what I'm saying is that \r\n    if he bought the property back at $96,000.00[,] he has therefore saved what \r\n    amounts to maybe $45,000, $50,000.\r\n\r\n  The Court: By beating his credit.\r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: Well, okay, here we go again, \r\n    Your Honor. This the whole point. I think you're treating Mr. Moore differently \r\n    because he, in fact, seems to be a guy who beats his credit.\r\n\r\n  The Court: I'm \r\n    treating him differently because he had absolutely no credit worthiness based \r\n    on the debts in this case. \r\n\r\n\r\n. . . . \r\n\r\n\r\n  The Court: The Court's not trying to protect \r\n    anybody. The only thing I'm trying to ensure is that somebody â€¦ the purpose \r\n    of a bid is that you're going to come up with the rest of your money. If you \r\n    don't[,] then it's some detriment to you. And again, in that Hudson \r\n    case, (5) if such a person can resell the property \r\n    being at a profit or finds that he's made a profitable purchase[,] then he \r\n    makes his check good and complies with his bid, otherwise he does nothing \r\n    and there's not [sic] redress to him. And that's talking about a personal \r\n    check or certified check, but isn't that really what the issue is? Let's assume \r\n    Mr. Moore had not come up with the money, he would be out absolutely nothing. \r\n    \r\n\r\n  Moore's Counsel: Oh, certainly. In other counties[,] \r\n    he might be doing jail time, Judge. I suspect the way you feel about him[,] \r\n    he probably would be.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Don't tempt me. I'd rather stay silent \r\n    on that.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Alan W. Pullen, president of Community, \r\n  who attended the foreclosure sale, testified he was surprised at the referee's \r\n  time limit requirement applied after Moore's successful bid. He averred he had \r\n  never witnessed an immediate compliance requirement and that the standard practice \r\n  in many counties require the deposit paid at the end of the day of the sale. \r\n  Pullen stated the normal practice in Fairfield County is to allow successful \r\n  bidders to tender their deposits by 5:00 p.m. the same day of the sale. \r\n\r\nOn March 31, 1999, Rowe tendered the balance of \r\n  his bid price on the property to the Clerk of Court for Fairfield County. The \r\n  special referee confirmed the second sale by order filed April 22, 1999, and \r\n  orally denied reconsideration of this order on September 29, 1999. On \r\n  October 6, 1999, Moore filed his notice of appeal. Thereafter, on October 18, \r\n  1999, Moore petitioned the South Carolina Court of Appeals for a writ of supersedeas; \r\n  however, this petition was withdrawn March 6, 2000. \r\n\r\nIn a letter addressed to all interested parties \r\n  dated March 8, 2000, the referee stated: \"Unless a Motion or other appropriate \r\n  proceeding is filed objecting to such recording [of the deed to Rowe] and disbursement, \r\n  I intend to file and disburse on March 17, 2000.\" The record contains no further \r\n  correspondence to the referee. Thereafter, the deed to Rowe and the accounting \r\n  of the special referee were filed March 23, 2000. Community, the first priority \r\n  lienholder on the property that was sold, moved to dismiss Moore's appeal on \r\n  the ground it has become moot. Community's motion was denied by this Court on \r\n  May 17, 2000. (6) \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nA real estate foreclosure is an action in equity. \r\n  MI Co., Ltd. v.

Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 341 S.C. 539, 535 S.E.2d 139 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000) cert. granted.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nMoore argues the referee erred by prescribing the theretofore unannounced fifteen minute time\r\nlimit for depositing the earnest money with the court after the close of the first sale of the Fairfield\r\nproperty.  We agree.\r\n\r\nThe terms and conditions of a judicial sale are \r\n  controlled by the court order, Rule 71, SCRCP, the practice and custom of the \r\n  county in which the property is being sold, and by statute. See Federal \r\n  Nat'l Mortgage Assoc. v. Brooks, 304 S.C. 506, 405 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. \r\n  1991); Charles B. Simmons Jr., A Primer for Mortgage Foreclosures in South \r\n  Carolina, 6 S.C. Lawyer 29, 31 (May/Jun 1995).\r\n\r\nAt a minimum, the trial court's order of judgment \r\n  shall contain: (1) a sufficient legal description of the property being sold; \r\n  (2) a provision for the necessary legal advertisement; (3) the time and location \r\n  of the sale; (4) notice of any senior liens, taxes, or other rights to which \r\n  the property to be sold is subject; (5) the amount of good faith deposit necessary \r\n  at the time of the sale; and (6) the date that compliance must be made with \r\n  the bid. Rule 71(b), SCRCP; see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-660 \r\n  (1977) (reciting substantially similar requirements that must be advertised); \r\n  Farr v. Sims, 9 S.C. Eq. (Rich. Cas.) 122 (1832) (noting minimum requirements \r\n  for notice to the public for a judicial sale); 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales \r\n  Â§74 (1995) (\"A notice of sale should give the title of the cause, describe the \r\n  property to be sold, and state the date, hour, place, and terms of the sale. \r\n  As a practical matter, a notice is sufficient if it gives the title of the cause \r\n  and the date of the decree and states that the sale will be made in pursuance \r\n  of the decree.\").\r\n\r\nEssentially, through this order, the \r\n  trial court is fulfilling its duty to properly inform the public of every material \r\n  element of the judicial sale. That is, \"[t]o enable persons to buy, they ought \r\n  to be apprised of the terms on which the property is to be sold.\" Farr, \r\n  9 S.C. Eq. at 131. Thus, the courts reviewing a judicial sale should guard against \r\n  any undue surprise or partiality affecting the sale. \"[A]ny conduct on the part \r\n  of those actively engaged in the selling or bidding [at a judicial sale] that \r\n  tends to prevent a fair, free, open sale or stifle or suppress free competition \r\n  among bidders, is contrary to public policy, vitiates the sale, and constitutes \r\n  ground for setting it aside upon the complaint of the injured party.\" Ex \r\n  parte Keller, 185 S.C. 283, 291, 194 S.E. 15, 19 (1937) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nThis being said, we reiterate the well-established rule for South Carolina foreclosure sales that:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A judicial sale should not be set aside except \r\n    for cogent reasons. The purpose of the law and of the proceedings in which \r\n    a sale has been decreed is that it shall be final. As was said in Farrow \r\n    v. Farrow, 88 S.C. 333, 70 S.E. 459 [1911], the successful bidder makes \r\n    himself a party to the cause, and, except where title to the property is defective, \r\n    or where he can show fraud, misrepresentation, mistake, or other circumstances \r\n    of unfairness in the sale, he may be compelled by the court to perform his \r\n    contract of purchase. In the absence of such circumstances, therefore, his \r\n    contract should be upheld. These principles are well established. Henry \r\n    v. Blakely, 216 S.C. 13, 56 S.E.2d 581 [1949]; Appeal of Paslay, \r\n    230 S.C. 55, 94 S.E.2d 57 [1956].\r\n\r\n\r\nSpillers v.

That is, \"where a party in interest has been \r\n  misled to his detriment by the officer making the sale, through no \r\n  fault of his own, relief may be had.\" Hudson v. Inman, 179 \r\n  S.C. 399, 406, 184 S.E. 102, 105 (1936) (emphasis in original) (quoting Bonham \r\n  v. Cave, 102 S.C. 308, 311-12, 86 S.E. 681, 682 (1915)); see also \r\n  50A C.J.S. Judicial Sales Â§ 79 (1997) (\"A mistake or some surprise or \r\n  accident in connection with a judicial sale is ground for setting it aside, \r\n  either before or after confirmation, provided the mistake was an injurious one, \r\n  and would result in no substantial hardship other than rescinding the bargain.\").\r\n\r\nIn this appeal, we must analyze the special referee's \r\n  actions in conjunction with his order of sale. Although the referee acted as \r\n  his own selling officer, he was still bound by the limits of his written decree \r\n  of sale. When the public has been informed through the order and the advertisements, \r\n  the rules of the foreclosure sale are set. (8) \r\n  See Ex parte Keller, 185 S.C. 283, 194 S.E. 15 (1937) (recognizing \r\n  the legal principle that an order of sale is a public document, and all bidders, \r\n  as well as other persons, are charged with notice of its terms); Hudson v. \r\n  Inman, 179 S.C. 399, 184 S.E. 102 (1936); see also Federal \r\n  Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n v. Brooks, 304 S.C. 506, 405 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 1991) \r\n  (stating the purchaser should principally rely on, and is on notice of, the \r\n  terms provided in the foreclosure decree).\r\n\r\nGenerally, \"[i]n the conduct of a judicial sale, \r\n  the selling officer acts in a ministerial capacity as the arm of the court to \r\n  carry out its orders.\" Brooks, 304 S.C. at 510, 405 S.E.2d at 606 (citation \r\n  omitted). \"He in no way acts in a judicial capacity.\" Id. Thus, the selling \r\n  officer has no authority to modify the terms and conditions of the foreclosure \r\n  decree in any material way. Id.; see also 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial \r\n  Sales Â§114 (1995) (\"Since the officer conducting the sale must abide by \r\n  the terms and conditions of the decree or order of sale, he or she may not alter \r\n  the terms as set forth in the order of sale.\") (footnotes omitted). The officer \r\n  has very little discretion and must conduct the sale within the confines of \r\n  the decree.\r\n\r\nThe amended foreclosure order of the Fairfield \r\n  property set forth, in relevant part, that the sale was: \r\n\r\n\r\n  FOR CASH. The Special Referee will require a deposit \r\n    of five (5%) per cent of the amount bid (in cash or equivalent), the same \r\n    to be applied on the purchase price upon compliance with the bid, but in case \r\n    of noncompliance within 30 days after the date of the sale, same to be forfeited \r\n    and applied to costs and the first mortgage lien. \r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, by these terms, the purchaser was required \r\n  to tender his entire bid within a set time after the foreclosure sale. He was \r\n  also required to tender a deposit at some point to prove his good faith bid \r\n  on the property. However, we read no requirement that the purchaser was to tender \r\n  this deposit immediately after the hammer falls closing the sale. This provision \r\n  says nothing of the timing requirements for a sale. In fact, the exact timing \r\n  of a judicial sale is not set by statute; rather, under the direction of a master \r\n  (9) or other appropriate court officer, the sale is conducted on the \r\n  day of sale between \"eleven and five o'clock.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-690 (1977); \r\n  Rule 71(b), SCRCP. However, the officer may prevent sales before they start \r\n  by giving notice that the sales for that day have been closed. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-39-690 (1977); see also Pickett v. Pickett, 11 S.C. \r\n  Eq. (2 Hill Eq.) 470 (1836) (holding subsequent sale of property after sheriff \r\n  announced he would sell no more property that day was void).\r\n\r\nWhen, as in the case at hand, the foreclosing creditor \r\n  waives his right to a deficiency judgment, the sale is deemed closed on the \r\n  day of sale and the advertisement of sale should state \"that no personal or \r\n  deficiency judgment is demanded and that the bidding will not remain open after \r\n  the sale but that compliance with the bid may be made immediately.\" \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-760 (1977); see also Goethe v. Cleland, \r\n  323 S.C. 50, 448 S.E.2d 574 (Ct. App. 1994) (stating where no deficiency judgment \r\n  is requested, the bidding in the foreclosure sale need not remain open for thirty \r\n  days to allow for upset bids); Rule 71(b), SCRCP (\"Unless the pleadings state \r\n  that no personal or deficiency judgment is demanded or any right to such judgment \r\n  is expressly waived in writing, the bidding shall not be closed upon the day \r\n  of sale but shall remain open until the thirtieth day after such sale exclusive \r\n  of the day of the sale.\").\r\n\r\nHere, however, the referee did not require immediate \r\n  compliance for the bid either in his order or in his amended notice of sale; \r\n  instead, the referee required compliance within thirty days after the date of \r\n  the sale. Without further explanation, the referee also stated in his order \r\n  that he \"will require a deposit of 5% on the amount of the bid (in cash or equivalent).\" \r\n  A decree of sale may require a good faith deposit or guaranty of cash \"at the \r\n  conclusion of the bidding.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-740 (1977). However, this \r\n  earnest money is not required prior to the conclusion of the bidding and can \r\n  be no more than 5% of the bid price. Id. \"Such a deposit is a proper \r\n  safeguard against spurious bidding upon the one hand and an aid in carrying \r\n  into effect the terms of sale upon the other.\" Ex parte Floyd, 145 S.C. \r\n  364, 375, 142 S.E. 805, 808 (1928); see also Hudson v. Inman, \r\n  179 S.C. 399, 184 S.E. 102 (1936) (stating the requirement of an earnest money \r\n  deposit promotes the purchasing party's compliance with the terms of sale). \r\n  Thus, for example:\r\n\r\n\r\n  To allow a person who is not financially responsible \r\n    to give a worthless check as a deposit places such person in the advantageous \r\n    position of complying with his bid at his pleasure. If such person can resell \r\n    the property bid in at a profit, or finds that he has made a profitable purchase, \r\n    then he makes his check good and complies with his bid; otherwise, he does \r\n    nothing and there is no redress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHudson, 179 S.C. at 403, 184 S.E. at 104; \r\n  see also 47 Am. Jur. 2d Judicial Sales Â§134 (1995) (\"The \r\n  requirement of a deposit of cash or other security by prospective bidders, to \r\n  insure compliance with the contract of sale on the part of one whose bid is \r\n  accepted, is customary.\") (footnote omitted). \r\n\r\nAs with the referee's authority to set and advertise \r\n  the timing for compliance with the bid, the referee may establish a time for \r\n  the earnest money deposit. Here, the special referee's order was silent as to \r\n  the time when the earnest money deposit was required to be paid. Lacking such \r\n  guidance, Moore, as the prevailing bidder, had a reasonable time within which \r\n  to tender his deposit. The law does not require immediate compliance without \r\n  warning. The earnest payment merely illustrates the prospective purchaser's \r\n  bona fide assurance to the court that he fully intends to perform under the \r\n  purchase contract.\r\n\r\nHere, Moore bid on the property expecting he would \r\n  have a reasonable time within which to tender his earnest payment to the court. \r\n  Instead, he was \"stunned,\" as were others, by the referee's pronouncement of \r\n  an immediate tender requirement. Moore testified he attempted to reach his financier \r\n  within the fifteen minute window to cover his 5% earnest obligation. Although \r\n  he was unable to deposit his money within the newly prescribed time limit, Moore \r\n  did, in fact, tender the requisite deposit by 4:30-4:45 p.m. on the same day \r\n  of the sale. The only evidence contrary to Moore's good faith efforts to comply \r\n  is the referee's acknowledged different treatment of Moore as a credit risk. \r\n  We find it was unreasonable for the referee to spring the restrictive time limit \r\n  on the parties, without notice, and after conducting the sale under different \r\n  terms.\r\n\r\nIn Farr v. Sims, 9 S.C. Eq. (Rich. Cas.) \r\n  122 (1832), the Court of Appeals found a judicial sale void where the advertisement \r\n  stated the sale was for cash, but the officer demanded payment in specie upon \r\n  request of a creditor. The Court noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This was a short notice; but if the Sheriff had \r\n    advertised the sale to be for specie, it might have availed to protect them \r\n    both [the sheriff and the creditor] from legal censure. As it was, however, \r\n    the Sheriff gave no such notice until the day of sale, and this failure of \r\n    duty, on his part, must also attach to the creditor; for, in effecting the \r\n    sale, the Sheriff is the agent of the creditor, the debtor, and the purchaser, \r\n    and his acts may, more or less, affect them all. \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 131.\r\n\r\nWhen the officer changed the conditions of the \r\n  sale, \"[i]t was, in fact, a sale without being advertised, for one of the most \r\n  important conditions of the sale was not disclosed in the advertisement. In \r\n  this respect, the sale was void, for want of authority on the part of the Sheriff \r\n  to sell.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIn Ex parte Keller, 185 S.C. 283, 194 S.E. \r\n  15 (1937), the master supplemented the foreclosure decree with a condition not \r\n  found in the decree. Quoting McMaster v. Arthur, 33 S.C. 512, 515, 12 \r\n  S.E. 308, 309 (1890), the Keller Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The master supplemented the order of the court \r\n    by a condition not found in said order, to-wit, that the land should be sold \r\n    subject to the claim of the homestead. This addition to the order \r\n    was made by the master on the day of sale, when Crawford &amp; \r\n    Co., attorneys of the petitioner, gave notice of this claim. But by what authority \r\n    could the master thus supplement said order? We know of none; and, even admitting \r\n    for this case, that, had the order been carried out according to its terms, \r\n    the result might have been different, yet, said order not having been executed, \r\n    the matter stands as if there had been no sale. It was a void sale, \r\n    the master having no authority to sell as he did (Baily v. \r\n    Baily, [30 S.C. Eq.] (9 Rich. Eq.) [392], 395 [1857]), and consequently \r\n    the petitioner was not bound to pay in her bid.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 294, 194 S.E. at 20 (emphasis added), \r\n  cited with approval by Federal Nat'l Mortgage Ass'n v. Brooks, 304 S.C. \r\n  506, 405 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\nThe Keller Court also explained that the \r\n  open-ended statutory provision for the purchasing party's compliance guarantees \r\n  the purchasing party a reasonable time to tender his bid, if due the day of \r\n  sale, or his earnest money, if no specific time is given. The sale order required \r\n  the successful bidder to tender 3% of his bid with the court \"immediately after \r\n  the sale as evidence of good faith.\" Id. at 289, 194 S.E. at 18. Among \r\n  other problems, the appellant failed to accompany his winning bid with a contemporaneous \r\n  earnest money deposit. The Court thus interpreted \r\n  the timing requirement and concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It follows that even had the bid of appellant \r\n    been a legal bid, he could not be declared the highest bidder not having complied \r\n    with the terms of the order of sale, bottomed upon the statute, by filing \r\n    with the special referee the necessary deposit either in cash or certified \r\n    check, immediately following his bid, or within a reasonable time \r\n    thereafter on that day.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 296, 194 S.E. at 21 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nStated another way, a purchaser who has demonstrated \r\n  the prima facie intent to comply with the earnest deposit may deposit this sum \r\n  with the court no later than by the end of the day of sale at 5:00 p.m. Where \r\n  the party is on notice of a set time when compliance must be made, on the other \r\n  hand, he is effectively estopped from denying the efficacy of the mandate. See \r\n  Hudson v. Inman, 179 S.C. 399, 404, 184 S.E. 102, 104 (1936) (\"[A] bidder \r\n  not complying with the terms of the decree and the advertisement will not be \r\n  heard to complain that he was lulled into security in not being required publicly \r\n  to comply with the terms of the decree and advertisement of the sale of the \r\n  property.\"); see also Ex parte Floyd, 145 S.C. 364, 379, \r\n  142 S.E. 805, 810 (1928) (holding that since the decree required the purchaser \r\n  to deposit his earnest money before 4 o'clock on the day of sale, \"then it was \r\n  equally necessary that the purchaser at the second sale [at 4 o'clock] make \r\n  the required deposit immediately. Otherwise it was wholly unnecessary to have \r\n  a resale, for the manifest purpose of requiring the deposit and providing for \r\n  the resale was to have in hand the deposit before 4 o'clock, or immediately \r\n  thereafter.\").\r\n\r\nDelving further, we note Keller is merely \r\n  restating the basic tenets of the common law. We find an early expression of \r\n  this most basic principle in Seymour v. Preston, 17 S.C. Eq. (Speers \r\n  Eq.) 481 (1844). In Seymour, the sheriff of Charleston conducted a foreclosure \r\n  sale wherein Seymour made the highest bid equal to the mortgage debt on the \r\n  property with nothing left for the junior judgment lienholders. However, Seymour \r\n  did not timely tender his bid. He did not tender his bid until after receiving \r\n  notice that the purchaser at a second sale of the property had already complied \r\n  with his bid. Although the court found Seymour had forfeited his right under \r\n  the contract of sale by not complying with his bid, the court conclusively re-emphasized \r\n  that Seymour could have secured the property by complying with his bid on the \r\n  day of sale. The court explains:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [N]o one will be found hardy enough to contend, \r\n    that if one agree[s] to sell property to another for cash [in an analogous \r\n    private sale], and the purchaser offer[s] him the money two months after, \r\n    the seller would be bound to perform his part of the contract; and that is \r\n    this case. By the law and usage regulating sheriff's, and other official sales, \r\n    a purchaser at a sale for cash, must pay the money on the day of \r\n    sale. I know â€¦ that it frequently happens that the officer making \r\n    the sales takes upon himself to allow the purchaser a short time to pay the \r\n    money, and there is no impropriety in it, when it is done with the assent \r\n    of the creditor and the debtor, â€¦ [but] if the purchaser has neglected to \r\n    pay the purchase money, he has forfeited his right under the contract of sale, \r\n    certainly he is not entitled to favor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeymour, 17 S.C. Eq. at 485 (emphasis added), \r\n  cited in 50A C.J.S. Judicial Sales Â§ 38 (1997) (\"In the absence \r\n  of a statute otherwise providing, when the sale is for cash, payment in cash \r\n  should be made on the day of sale in order to entitle the purchaser to have \r\n  the sale confirmed.\"). \r\n\r\nThus, \"in the absence of fraud or collusion, we \r\n  do not think that a failure to comply literally with the terms of sale as to \r\n  the cash payment, the moment the hammer falls, is such \r\n  failure in itself as will in every case forfeit the bid.\" Yates v. Gridley, \r\n  16 S.C. 496, 502 (1882) (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nOur review of the record reveals Moore tried, in \r\n  good faith, to comply with the special referee's surprise edict after the fact \r\n  that he should tender his earnest money fifteen minutes after the close of the \r\n  bidding. Thereafter, by 4:30-4:45 p.m. the same day of sale, Moore deposited \r\n  his earnest money with the court as proof of the veracity of his bid. This assurance, \r\n  however, was too late to appease the referee for the property had already been \r\n  resold. The referee's support for the resale, however, came not from the efforts \r\n  of the successful bidder before him or based on any provisions, in fairness, \r\n  disclosed to the prospective purchasers before the auction; rather, the referee's \r\n  reaction came from his own knowledge of the proceedings leading up to the foreclosure \r\n  sale. \r\n\r\nThe referee admits he \"[treated Moore] differently \r\n  because [Moore] had absolutely no credit worthiness based on the debts in this \r\n  case.\" We agree Moore's standing as a debtor is a proper factor for the court \r\n  to consider. Nevertheless, while it is valid for the selling officer to require \r\n  guaranteed funds to discourage spurious bids, the officer has no discretion \r\n  to make surprise announcements that have a chilling effect on the bidding. See \r\n  Hamrick v. Summey, 282 S.C. 424, 320 S.E.2d 703 (1984).\r\n\r\nIn Hamrick, all of the persons attending \r\n  a creditor's auction were recognized by the sellers except for the highest bidder. \r\n  Under the rules of the auction, a successful bidder was required to make a 20% \r\n  deposit on the day of sale by cash or check approved by the seller. However, \r\n  since the highest bidder was unknown, the officer refused to accept his check \r\n  unless he signed an agreement to bring certified funds two days later. The unknown \r\n  bidder refused to comply with this requirement. The property was then resold \r\n  and the Circuit Court confirmed the second sale. On appeal, the Supreme Court \r\n  found \"[t]here was no discrimination against [the unknown bidder] in seeking \r\n  to have him pledge certificates of deposit on the Monday following the sale, \r\n  but this was merely an effort to give some strength and credibility to his bid.\" \r\n  Id. at 429, 320 S.E.2d at 706. That is, accepting the unknown bidder's \r\n  uncertified check \"would have jeopardized the entire sale.\" Id.\r\n\r\nIf the purchaser is ready and willing to secure \r\n  his deposit in compliance with his bid, the selling officer can not change the \r\n  terms for the judicial sale. \"All that the Court can require, therefore, is, \r\n  that he should do now, what he ought to have done then; give [security] according \r\n  to the terms of the sale.\" Young v. Teague, 8 S.C. Eq. (Bail. Eq.) 13, \r\n  20 (1830); see also 50A C.J.S. Judicial Sales Â§ 40 (1997) \r\n  (\"If, however, the purchaser was always ready and willing to furnish the security \r\n  required by the order of sale, the failure of the commissioner to take it is \r\n  not ground for setting the sale aside, but the purchaser will be required to \r\n  comply.\") (citing Teague, 8 S.C. Eq. at 20). \r\n\r\nIn Teague, the purchaser was ready and willing \r\n  to execute his bond on the property, but the commissioner declined to take it \r\n  \"because he thought it an unnecessary expense.\" Teague, 8 S.C. Eq. at \r\n  15-16. The commissioner delivered titles to the purchaser; thereafter, other \r\n  attendees at the sale sought to set aside these deeds arguing they had intended \r\n  to bid more for the property at the auction themselves. However, because the \r\n  purchaser's minor non-compliance was caused by the selling officer and \"[i]t \r\n  appears [the purchaser] did not refuse [to comply], but on the contrary was \r\n  ready and willing to comply,\" the sale to him was valid. Id. at 20.\r\n\r\nEven if the referee's surprise edict was a valid \r\n  amendment to his order, we find the referee's strict construction of the order's \r\n  limitations is unwarranted. To defeat the first sale of the Fairfield property, \r\n  the referee relies on our statutory requirement that a purchaser must comply \r\n  with every requirement dictated in the judgment order to honor the sales contract. \r\n  That is: \r\n\r\n\r\n  If the purchaser shall fail to comply with the \r\n    terms aforesaid[,] the [officer] shall proceed to resell at the risk of the \r\n    defaulting purchaser either on the same or some subsequent sale day, as the \r\n    plaintiff may direct, and, in the absence of any direction by the plaintiff, \r\n    the [officer] shall resell on the same day, if practicable, and if not on \r\n    the next succeeding sale day, making in every such case proclamation that \r\n    he is reselling at the risk of such defaulting former purchaser.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-710 (1977); see also \r\n  Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v. Sansbury, 164 S.C. 452, 162 S.E. 579 (1932).\r\n\r\nThis statutory limitation has been in effect in \r\n  South Carolina for more than a century. However,\r\n\r\n\r\n  [this statute] was not intended to prevent a bona \r\n    fide purchaser from receiving title because he was not prepared to comply \r\n    with his bid at the moment the hammer fell to 'shell out the cash.' In this \r\n    day of banks, drafts, and checks, it is not to be expected that a bidder at \r\n    sheriffs' sales should be laden down with rolls of currency with which to \r\n    comply with his bid. It is not progressive and in keeping with the spirit \r\n    of the age. It is not equitable. \r\n\r\n\r\nBrown v. Barnwell Mfg. Co., 46 S.C. 415, \r\n  420, 24 S.E. 191, 193 (1896). \r\n\r\n In Brown, a certain lot was knocked down \r\n  to the attorney for Simon Brown. After compiling the documents of the sale, \r\n  the sheriff asked the attorney to comply with his bid immediately, extended \r\n  to approximately two hours after the sale. The attorney tried to reach Brown \r\n  to no avail, during which time the property was resold. The Brown Court \r\n  found this strict construction of the statute was unwarranted. The tribunal \r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Under all the circumstances, it seems to this \r\n    court that the sheriff should have, at least, allowed the attorney all the \r\n    time possible before the expiration of the legal hours of sale, \r\n    on the day when the property was sold, for complying with his \r\n    bid; especially when the attorney was taken by surprise by the requirement \r\n    of strict compliance with the terms of sale.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 425-26, 24 S.E. at 195 (emphasis \r\n  added). \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe rule that a purchaser at a foreclosure sale \r\n  has until 5 o'clock p.m. on the sales date unless the \r\n  order of the court and the notice of sale specifically \r\n  provide for a different payment time for the deposit. \r\n\r\nWe find the special referee's surprise amendment \r\n  to his order of sale after the close of the bidding was invalid. The referee's \r\n  action does not comport with our understanding of the fairness inherently necessary \r\n  in a foreclosure sale or with the common law that, unless modified by the decree, \r\n  does not require an immediate tender of the purchaser's deposit the moment the \r\n  hammer falls. Without pre-announced limits, the highest bidder at a foreclosure \r\n  sale who has the manifest intent to comply with his bid has until the end of \r\n  the day of sale to tender his earnest deposit with the court. \r\n\r\nThe referee erred in setting aside the first sale \r\n  of the property prematurely. Thus, the second sale is invalid and should be \r\n  set aside. Although an innocent third party who bids and wins at the second \r\n  foreclosure sale \"should not be punished for the fraud of another [that voids \r\n  this sale], he shall not avail himself of it.\" Farr v. Sims, 9 S.C. Eq. \r\n  (Rich. Cas.) 122, 133 (1832) (quoting Robson v. Calze, 1 Doug. 228). \r\n  For the foregoing reasons, we find the decision of the special referee is\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurring in result only: \r\n   Although I concur in the ultimate judgment of the Court, I write separately \r\n  to express my concern over the wisdom of adopting a bright-line rule of 5:00 \r\n  p.m. on the day of the foreclosure sale for deposits to be made, in the absence \r\n  of any specific provisions in the order or notice of sale. In my view, this \r\n  Court has neither the authority nor legal support to establish such a rule. \r\n  \r\n\r\nInitially, because the requirements for a judicial \r\n  sale are governed primarily by statute and Rule 71, SCRCP, and no provision \r\n  sets forth a precise time for the payment of bid deposits, I believe the establishment \r\n  of a five o'clock deadline is wholly within the province of our Legislature. \r\n  See Henderson v. Evans, 268 S.C. 127, 130, 232 S.E.2d 331, 333 \r\n  (1977) (\"[I]t is not the province of [a court] to perform legislative functions.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, our case law is clear that the rules \r\n  regarding such matters are discretionary with the selling authority, subject \r\n  only to a requirement of reasonableness. See Ex Parte Keller v. Hutto, \r\n  185 S.C. 283, 289, 296, 194 S.E. 15, 21 (1937) (interpreting the phrase \"immediately \r\n  after the sale\" in a judicial sale order referencing a required 3% good faith \r\n  deposit to mean either \"immediately following [the] bid, or within a reasonable \r\n  time thereafter on that day\") (emphasis added); Harrington v. Blackston, \r\n  311 S.C. 459, 464-65, 429 S.E.2d 826, 830 (Ct. App. 1993) (\"Except to the extent \r\n  controlled by statute, the terms of a judicial sale are within the discretion \r\n  of the court ordering the sale.\").\r\n\r\nReasonableness, in turn, depends on the circumstances \r\n  of each sale. See Ex Parte Floyd v. Carmon, 145 S.C. 364, 367, \r\n  142 S.E. 805, 807 (1928) (holding that even where the terms of a judicial sale \r\n  order specified $500 be deposited on the bid \"before 4 o'clock p.m. on the day \r\n  of [the] sale,\" the time for paying the deposit could be extended in the master's \r\n  discretion where warranted by the facts and circumstances, including the parties' \r\n  waiver of any time requirement); Brown v. Barnwell Mfg. Co., 46 S.C. \r\n  415, 422, 424-26, 24 S.E. 191, 193-95 (1896) (in holding that \"[u]nder all the \r\n  circumstances . . . the sheriff should have, at least, allowed the purchaser \r\n  all the time possible before the expiration of the legal hours of sale, on the \r\n  day when the property was sold, for complying with his bid . . .,\" the supreme \r\n  court, regarding appellant's exception (7), wherein it was claimed the trial \r\n  court erred in \"holding and concluding as a matter of law that the \r\n  [purchaser] had until the expiration of the legal hours of sale within which \r\n  time to comply with the bid,\" stated: \"A careful consideration of the decree \r\n  of the circuit judge satisfies us that the seventh [and other] exceptions were \r\n  taken under a misapprehension of said decree. The language of the circuit \r\n  court was intended merely to illustrate the spirit of our statute relating \r\n  to resales by sheriffs.\") (emphasis added); Yates v. Gridley, 16 S.C. \r\n  496, 497, 504 (1882) (affirming sale to purchaser who failed to comply with \r\n  exact terms of judicial sale, i.e., \"cash sufficient to pay costs and disbursements \r\n  of suit,\" by paying such not on the day of sale in December but sometime in \r\n  January; supreme court held the fact that the terms of the sale were not immediately \r\n  complied with when they were met \"within so short a time afterwards\" was insufficient \r\n  to annul purchaser's deed).\r\n\r\nIn addition, I think the decision to craft such \r\n  a rule would conflict with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-690 (1977), which states: \r\n  \"The hours of [a judicial] sale shall be between eleven and five o'clock.\" If, \r\n  under the terms of the statute a judicial sale can occur as late as 5:00 p.m. \r\n  on the date of sale, then, under the proposed rule, a purchaser would have no \r\n  time to make the required deposit. \r\n\r\nFinally, I believe an absolute five o'clock deadline \r\n  would not comport with standard principles of equity governing judicial sales. \r\n  Accordingly, because the statutory scheme governing foreclosure sales is silent \r\n  and our cases in the past have imposed a reasonableness requirement but not \r\n  an absolute deadline, I would decline to do so now.  \r\n1.  Fairfield Real Estate Company, \r\n  Inc. was formerly Fairfield Oil Company. The company changed its name by filing \r\n  its Articles of Amendment to its Articles of Incorporation on October 12, 1988. \r\n2.  Branham was a former shareholder \r\n  in Fairfield. He sold his stake to the company in 1986. Fairfield gave Branham \r\n  a series of notes and mortgages in exchange for his interest. Fairfield eventually \r\n  defaulted on its obligation to Branham. Branham consequently pursued foreclosure. \r\n  This foreclosure action and the priorities of several mortgage liens on the \r\n  subject property is the subject of a separate appeal filed by Jerry Branham \r\n  on January 19, 1999. By unpublished opinion, we affirmed the referee's findings \r\n  and order of sale under his Order of Foreclosure filed December 18, 1998. Branham \r\n  v. Fairfield Real Estate Co., Op. No. 2001-UP-303 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May \r\n  31, 2001). \r\n3.  The property is described \r\n  as: \r\n\r\n\r\n  All those piece, parcel or lots of land containing \r\n    collectively 33.03 acres, more or less, lying, being and situate at, and near, \r\n    the intersection of S.C. Hwy No. 34 and Secondary Rd S-20-159, approximately \r\n    two (2) miles Southeast of the Town of Ridgeway in the County of Fairfield, \r\n    State of South Carolina. Said parcels being more particularly shown and designated \r\n    as Parcel No. 8 containing 9.99 acres, parcel No. 26 containing 9.00 acres, \r\n    and parcel No. 27 containing 14.04 acres, and that portion of parcel No. 21 \r\n    containing approximately 1.75 acres representing the fifty foot wide driveway \r\n    running from S-20-159 to the southwestern corner of Parcel No. 22, all as \r\n    more particularly shown on a plat made by Carl A. Holland, Jr. dated March \r\n    24, 1987 recorded in Plat Cabinet \"B\" at Page 350 in the office of the Clerk \r\n    of Court for Fairfield County.\r\n\r\n  Being a portion of the property conveyed to Fairfield \r\n    Real Estate Company, Inc. formerly Fairfield Oil Company by deed of David \r\n    Dubose Gailland, II recorded September 23, 1986 in Deed Book \"IW\" at Page \r\n    289. \r\n\r\n4.  Since the referee had no \r\n  recollection of first requiring Moore to tender his deposit within five minutes \r\n  of the close of bidding, this requirement was presented by testimony from Alan \r\n  W. Pullen, president of Community.\r\n\r\n5.  Hudson v. Inman, \r\n  179 S.C. 399, 184 S.E.2d 102 (1935).  \r\n6.  Community argues again on \r\n  appeal that this issue is moot. A case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, \r\n  will have no practical legal effect upon the existing controversy. Mathis \r\n  v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't, 260 S.C. 344, 195 S.E.2d 713 (1973), \r\n  cited in Arnold v. Association of Citadel Men, 337 S.C. \r\n  265, 523 S.E.2d 757 (1999). This is true when some event occurs making it impossible \r\n  for the reviewing court to grant effectual relief. Id. However, a foreclosure \r\n  sale that was improperly conducted so as to prejudice interested parties is \r\n  void and, therefore, the sale may be set aside by the reviewing court. Howell \r\n  v. Gibson, 208 S.C. 19, 37 S.E.2d 271 (1946) (holding a mistake or surprise \r\n  in connection with the sale is grounds for setting it aside provided the mistake \r\n  is harmful and not a mistake of law or one due to the negligence of the party \r\n  complaining) (citation omitted); Farr v. Sims, 9 S.C. Eq. (Rich. Cas.) \r\n  122, 134 (1832) (\"If the Sheriff fraudulently sells a debtor's property, his \r\n  sale, it is conceded, is void. If the sale is void, must not his deed to the \r\n  purchaser be void also? * * * I apprehend the sale and deed are both nullities.\"); \r\n  Federal Nat'l Mort. Ass'n v. Brooks, 304 S.C. 506, 405 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1991) (ruling judicial sale was set aside because, in part, the clerk of \r\n  court, not the designated foreclosure referee, advertised and conducted the \r\n  sale). Moore's action is not moot. \r\n\r\n7.  When consideration is so \r\n  inadequate that it shocks the conscience of the court, the sale is void and \r\n  will be set aside. See Hamilton v. Patterson, 236 S.C. 487, 494, \r\n  115 S.E.2d 68, 71 (1960) (\"It is well settled in this State 'that inadequacy \r\n  of price, unless so gross as to shock the conscience of the court or accompanied \r\n  by circumstances from which fraud may be clearly inferred, will not justify \r\n  the overthrow of a judicial sale.'\") (citation omitted); Hughes v. Wilburn, \r\n  156 S.C. 443, 153 S.E. 487 (1930) (ruling a bid one-eightieth of the inventoried \r\n  value of the property was so grossly inadequate as to be shocking to the court); \r\n  Peoples Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n v. Graham, 291 S.C. 178, 352 S.E.2d \r\n  511 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding sale price of $48,100, received for mortgaged property \r\n  subsequently appraised at $73,000, was not so inadequate as to shock the conscience \r\n  or to give rise to inference of fraud so as to require that judicial sale be \r\n  set aside). \r\n8.  In limited circumstances, \r\n  however, a court ordering the foreclosure sale may amend its own order. Thus, \r\n  for example, in In re Receivership of Great Western Beet Sugar Co., 125 \r\n  P. 799 (Idaho 1912), the receiver auctioning property was given leave to extend \r\n  the time period for the successful bidder to tender his twenty five percent \r\n  deposit. The decree originally required the receiver to \"promptly collect any \r\n  cash payment required\" at the time of sale. Id. at 801. However, the \r\n  appellate court found the trial court could reasonably extend the time to comply \r\n  \"where no injury is done to any one by failure of the purchaser to pay at once \r\n  the sum due on his bid.\" Id. That is, \"a trial judge in equity â€¦ has \r\n  discretionary power to modify all orders affecting such sale by subsequent orders.\" \r\n  Id.; cf. Goethe v. Cleland, 323 S.C. 50, 448 S.E.2d 574 \r\n  (Ct.

Cottrell, and the \r\n  National Bank of South Carolina, as Trustee of the Martin L. Cottrell Trust. \r\n  The court held Marilyn Cottrell was not an omitted spouse pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 62-2-301. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn 1996, 56-year-old Martin Cottrell, his brother \r\n  Willard, and his sister-in-law met with Attorney Thomas Cothran to create Martin's \r\n  estate plan. (1) Martin told Cothran he wanted \r\n  his assets to remain in his bloodline. Cothran drafted a will bequeathing Martin's \r\n  personal property to his brother and devising his home to his father. The remainder \r\n  of Martin's estate formed a residuary trust for the benefit of his niece and \r\n  two nephews. Martin executed the will on April 23, 1996.\r\n\r\nMartin returned to Cothran's office a year and a half later,\r\nthis time with his girlfriend, Marilyn\r\nAnne Jackson.  Martin wanted to revise his estate plan to include Marilyn and to accommodate\r\nany future marriage to her, but to keep his assets ultimately within his family bloodline.  In an\r\naffidavit submitted to the Circuit Court, Cothran described this meeting as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  On November 18, 1997, Affiant met with Marty \r\n    and Marilyn Anne Jackson to discuss revisions to Marty's estate plan. At this \r\n    meeting[,] both of them participated in the discussion of how to modify the \r\n    recently created drafts of Marty's estate plan. Marty again expressed to Affiant \r\n    his feeling that keeping family assets in the bloodline was very important \r\n    to him, but benefits to his blood kin would be delayed until after Marilyn['s] \r\n    life time (sic) needs were taken care of by way of [a] trust for her. Marty \r\n    had previously told Affiant that he wanted a trust for Marilyn's benefit in \r\n    such a way that she would have her needs taken care of during her life time \r\n    (sic)[,] but he stated very clearly that he wanted any assets remaining at \r\n    her later death to benefit his family. During a two hour conference, Affiant, \r\n    Marty, and Marilyn fully discussed estate plan options including outright \r\n    gifts, gifts in trust, provisions for spouse and blood kin, etc. Marilyn expressed \r\n    appreciation for the provisions made for her and she expressed full agreement \r\n    that such provisions were fair and appropriate to provide for her and to provide \r\n    for Marty's brother's family.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Marty repeatedly said that he wanted Marilyn \r\n    to marry him and he made the estate plan provisions for her in contemplation \r\n    of their eventual marriage. Marty wanted life time (sic) benefits for Marilyn \r\n    in his estate plan even if they were never married. Affiant, Marty, and Marilyn \r\n    fully discussed (during the November 18th conference) the estate tax advantages \r\n    of a trust[,] which qualifies for the federal estate tax marital deduction \r\n    by providing for a surviving spouse for life and then the remainder being \r\n    available for the family of the spouse who dies first. This type of trust \r\n    is commonly referred to as a \"Qualified Terminable Interest Trust\" or a \"QTIP\" \r\n    trust and can save estate taxes only if the parties are legally husband and \r\n    wife. Marty wanted the trust for Marilyn designed to take advantage of this \r\n    tax saving device after he and Marilyn were married, but did not want to have \r\n    to change his estate plan after they were married. Therefore, the estate plan \r\n    was designed to put into effect his wishes to protect Marilyn regardless of \r\n    their marriage, but was clearly (as articulated by Marty and approved by Marilyn) \r\n    prepared in contemplation of their marriage even though a wedding date was \r\n    not set at the time of the signing of Marty's estate plan on November 21, \r\n    1997.\r\n\r\n  &nbsp;  \r\n  Marty signed his estate plan (Revocable Trust \r\n    Agreement and Will) on November 21, 1997. Provisions were included for Marilyn's \r\n    benefit if Marty and Marilyn were not married at the time of Marty's death. \r\n    Other provisions were included for Marilyn's benefit if they were married \r\n    at the time of Marty's death. The \"QTIP\" provisions could only apply if they \r\n    were married at the time of Marty's death; therefore, on the face of the estate \r\n    plan, Marty clearly made his estate plan in contemplation of marriage to Marilyn. \r\n    This is in full accord with Marty's wishes as stated to Affiant during the \r\n    estate planning process and as explained by Affiant to both Marty and Marilyn.\r\n\r\nOn April 4, 1998, 58-year-old Martin married 49-year-old \r\n  Marilyn. Within eleven days of the marriage, both of them were dead. Martin \r\n  died of an acute myocardial infarction on April 7, 1998. Marilyn died on April \r\n  15, 1998, from a cerebellar infarction due to basilar artery thrombosis. Neither \r\n  Martin nor Marilyn had any surviving children. \r\n\r\nMartin did not execute a new will after the marriage. \r\n  His last will and testament was the one Cothran drafted in 1997. This will, \r\n  dated November 21, 1997, provided:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I [Martin Cottrell] am not married. I have no \r\n    children. I have a special friend, MARILYN ANNE JACKSON, for whom I am making \r\n    certain provisions in my estate plan (whether under this instrument or under \r\n    any other instrument). Except as otherwise specifically provided, \r\n    I intend for these provisions to apply for her benefit whether or not we should \r\n    ever become husband and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nIn the will, Martin bequeathed his personal and \r\n  household effects to Marilyn.\r\n\r\nThe Revocable Trust Agreement, also dated November \r\n  21, 1997, provided: \r\n\r\n\r\n  The Settlor [Martin Cottrell] is not married. \r\n    The Settlor has no children. The Settlor has a special friend, MARILYN ANNE \r\n    JACKSON, for whom he is making certain provisions in his estate plan (whether \r\n    under this instrument or under any other instrument). Except as otherwise \r\n    specifically provided, the Settlor intends for these provisions \r\n    to apply for her benefit whether or not they should ever become husband and \r\n    wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n\r\nIn addition to the Trust \r\n  Agreement's references to Marilyn as Martin's \"special friend,\" the Agreement \r\n  contained numerous references to Marilyn as the Settlor's \"wife\" or \"spouse\" \r\n  and the Trust C provisions were only effective in the event Martin and Marilyn \r\n  married.  (2)\r\n\r\nMartin's brother, Willard, was appointed personal representative of Martin's estate.  Marilyn's\r\nsister, Shirley Green, was appointed personal representative of Marilyn's estate.\r\n\r\nBy petition dated December 3, 1998, Green filed an action claiming Marilyn was an \"omitted\r\nspouse\" and entitled to Martin's entire estate.  The action further alleged  breach of contract,\r\nunjust enrichment, and the creation of a constructive trust.  Besides the entire estate, Green sought\r\nthe delivery of personal property and homestead exemptions.\r\n\r\nOn January 4, 1999, Willard Cottrell moved for removal of the action to the Circuit Court.  In a\r\nmotion filed with the court on June 24, 1999, Green sought summary judgment.  Willard later\r\nmoved for summary judgment.\r\n\r\nThe Circuit Court heard the parties' cross motions \r\n  on September 8, 1999. The judge subsequently ruled Marilyn was not an \"omitted \r\n  spouse\" within the meaning of Â§62-2-301 because Martin's will was made in contemplation \r\n  of his marriage to Marilyn and \"Marilyn Anne Cottrell was clearly provided for \r\n  within the meaning of the omitted spouse statute and that there is no genuine \r\n  issue of material fact in this regard.\" The trial judge granted summary judgment \r\n  to Willard. (3) Green appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nAn action under the omitted spouse statute is an \r\n  action at law. Timmerman v. Timmerman, 331 S.C. 455, 502 S.E.2d 920 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).\r\n\r\n\"Summary judgment is appropriate when 'the pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.'\" \r\n  Bruce v.

Holnam, Inc., 344 S.C. 129, 542 S.E.2d 743 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nGreen argues genuine issues of material fact existed \r\n  regarding whether Marilyn was an \"omitted spouse\" under Â§ 62-2-301. Specifically, \r\n  Green alleges the court failed to take notice of the language of the will that \r\n  the parties were not married and to weigh the distribution of the assets to \r\n  determine \"if there was a meaningful 'providing for'\" of Marilyn.\r\n\r\n Section 62-2-301 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (a) If a testator fails to provide by will for \r\n    his surviving spouse who married the testator after the execution of the will, \r\n    the omitted spouse, upon compliance with the provisions of subsection (c), \r\n    shall receive the same share of the estate he would have received if the decedent \r\n    left no will unless:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) it appears from the will that \r\n      the omission was intentional; or\r\n\r\n    (2) the testator provided for the \r\n      spouse by transfer outside the will and the intent that the transfer be \r\n      in lieu of a testamentary provision is shown by statements of the testator \r\n      or from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  (b) In satisfying a share provided by this section, \r\n    the devises made by the will abate as provided in Â§ 62-3-902.\r\n\r\n  (c) The spouse may claim a share as provided by \r\n    this section by filing in the court and mailing or delivering to the personal \r\n    representative, if any, a claim for such share within eight months after the \r\n    date of death or within six months after the probate of the decedent's will, \r\n    whichever limitation last expires.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\n   (4)\r\n   \r\nThis statute forms part \r\n  of the South Carolina Probate Code, which went into effect on July 1, 1987. \r\n  The legislative purpose behind the Probate Code was: \r\n\r\n  (1) to simplify and clarify the law concerning \r\n    the affairs of decedents, missing persons, protected persons, minors, and \r\n    incapacitated persons;\r\n\r\n  (2) to discover and make effective \r\n    the intent of a decedent in the distribution of his property;\r\n\r\n  (3) to promote a speedy and efficient system for \r\n    liquidating the estate of the decedent and making distribution to his successors;\r\n\r\n  (4) to facilitate use and enforcement of certain \r\n    trusts;\r\n\r\n  (5) to make uniform the law among the various jurisdictions. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-102 (1987) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe omitted spouse statute \"attempts to accomplish \r\n  two ends -- carrying out the decedent's probable intent and protecting the still-surviving \r\n  spouse.\" David E. Wagner, Article, The South Carolina Probate Code's Omitted \r\n  Spouse Statute and In Re Estate of Timmerman, 50 S.C. L. Rev. 979, 979 (1999).\r\n\r\nA surviving spouse who wishes to qualify as an \r\n  \"omitted spouse\" must demonstrate: \r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) the decedent spouse executed the will in question \r\n    prior to the marriage; \r\n\r\n  (2) the will does not provide for her as the surviving \r\n    spouse; \r\n\r\n  (3) the omission was unintentional; and \r\n\r\n  (4) the decedent did not provide for the spouse \r\n    with transfers outside of the will.  \r\n    (5)\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 983 (citing S.C. Code Ann Â§ 62-2-301(a)).\r\n\r\nGreen clearly passed the first of these hurdles. \r\n  Martin's will was executed before his marriage to Marilyn. To determine whether \r\n  the second condition\r\n  was met -- whether Martin \"provided for\" Marilyn in the will -- we look to:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) specific language in the will; or \r\n\r\n  (2) \"sufficient extrinsic evidence that a bequest \r\n    was made 'in contemplation of marriage.'\" \r\n\r\n\r\nSee Miles v. Miles, 312 S.C. 408, \r\n  440 S.E.2d 882 (1994) (holding a spouse has not been provided for in the absence \r\n  of specific language in the will or extrinsic evidence a bequest was made in \r\n  contemplation of marriage).\r\n\r\nGreen cites Miles in support of her proposition \r\n  that Marilyn was not provided for by the will. In that case, Grady Miles executed \r\n  a will on October 26, 1989, leaving Georgia Mae Hall his automobile and a life \r\n  estate in his home. At the time Grady executed the will, Georgia had rejected \r\n  numerous proposals of marriage from him. Georgia finally agreed to marry Grady \r\n  a year after the will was executed. Grady and Georgia married and Grady died \r\n  on September 21, 1991, without executing a new will. Georgia asserted she was \r\n  an \"omitted spouse\" and filed an action claiming Grady's entire estate.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court held Grady's bequest and devise \r\n  to Georgia prior to their marriage did not forestall application of the omitted \r\n  spouse statute as there was no evidence the bequest and devise were made in \r\n  contemplation of marriage. The Court ruled \"a spouse has not been 'provided \r\n  for' within the meaning of Â§62-2-301 unless the decedent considered the surviving \r\n  spouse in that capacity at the time the will was executed.\" Id. at 411, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 883.\r\n\r\nGreen maintains Martin \"could not have considered \r\n  his special friend in the capacity of his wife - and he clearly did not.\" Green \r\n  relies heavily on Miles; however, we find the facts of that case are \r\n  distinguishable. The most obvious distinction between Miles and the instant \r\n  case is that Martin's will and trust contain numerous, explicit references and \r\n  bequests to Marilyn in her capacity as Martin's \"wife\" or \"spouse.\" The face \r\n  of the will refers to Martin's possible future marriage to Marilyn and the Trust \r\n  Agreement specifically refers to Marilyn in her potential capacity as Martin's \r\n  wife. In Miles, there was a total absence of any reference in the will \r\n  to Georgia as a spouse.\r\n\r\nMartin's attorney affirmed Martin executed the \r\n  will and the accompanying trust agreement to care for Marilyn both in her capacity \r\n  as \"special friend\" and as \"wife.\" Marilyn was actively involved in the creation \r\n  of Martin's estate plan. Marilyn accompanied Martin to Cothran's office and \r\n  both Cottrell and Marilyn consulted with Cothran about the plan. Martin \"repeatedly \r\n  said that he wanted Marilyn to marry him\" and he did not want to change his \r\n  estate plan after they married. \r\n\r\nThere is no evidence in the record Marilyn rejected \r\n  Martin's proposal or that at the time he executed the will, Martin had any reason \r\n  to doubt that Marilyn would become his wife in the future. Cothran opined Martin \r\n  \"made the estate plan provisions for [Marilyn] in contemplation of their eventual \r\n  marriage.\"\r\n\r\nThe QTIP trust further distinguishes the facts \r\n  of this case from those of Miles. Martin executed the trust documents \r\n  on the same day he executed the will. The will refers to the trust. Trust C \r\n  would only take effect in the event Martin and Marilyn married. There would \r\n  have been no need for Martin to create a QTIP trust had he not contemplated \r\n  marriage to Marilyn at the time he executed both the will and the trust. Viewing \r\n  the above in the light most favorable to Marilyn, we conclude she failed to \r\n  demonstrate a genuine issue of material fact existed that Martin did not provide \r\n  for her in his will. Cf. In re Estate of Norem, 561 So.2d 434 \r\n  (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1990) (reversing summary judgment to wife seeking status \r\n  as pretermitted spouse when wife made no showing trust provision for Norem's \r\n  \"intended spouse\" was not made in contemplation of marriage). \r\n   (6)\r\n\r\nThe exclusions also prohibit Marilyn from qualifying \r\n  as an \"omitted spouse\" under the statute. Green failed to demonstrate a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact existed that Marilyn was unintentionally \r\n  omitted from Martin's will. Once again, we note the will plainly stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have a special friend, MARILYN ANNE JACKSON, \r\n    for whom I am making certain provisions in my estate plan (whether under this \r\n    instrument or under any other instrument). Except as otherwise specifically \r\n    provided, I intend for these provisions to apply for her benefit \r\n    whether or not we should ever become husband and wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Compare Uniform Probate \r\n  Code Â§ 2-301(a)(2) (stating the surviving spouse is not entitled to an intestate \r\n  share when \"the will expresses the intention that it is to be effective notwithstanding \r\n  any subsequent marriage\").\r\n\r\nThe Revocable Trust Agreement contained a similar \r\n  provision: \"Except as otherwise specifically provided, the Settlor \r\n  intends for these provisions to apply for [Marilyn's] benefit whether or not \r\n  they should ever become husband and wife.\" (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n Cothran's affidavit provides further evidence \r\n  Martin did not want to revise his estate plan after his marriage to Marilyn \r\n  and that Martin wanted to keep his assets within the bloodline. \"Marty wanted \r\n  the trust for Marilyn designed to take advantage of this tax saving device after \r\n  he and Marilyn were married, but did not want to have to change his estate plan \r\n  after they were married.\" This indicated Martin's failure to devise more of \r\n  his estate to Marilyn was intentional.\r\n\r\nGreen also failed to present any evidence creating \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact that Marilyn was not provided for by transfers \r\n  outside of Martin's will, namely the QTIP Trust. In In Re Estate of Timmerman, \r\n  331 S.C. 455, 502 S.E.2d 920 (Ct. App. 1998), this Court examined the sufficiency \r\n  of transfers outside of a will.\r\n\r\n The Honorable George Bell Timmerman, former Circuit \r\n  Court judge and governor, was married to Helen Timmerman for 45 years before \r\n  her death in 1980. While married to Helen, Timmerman executed a will leaving \r\n  his entire estate to her or to her sister, Margaret Dupre Long, if Helen predeceased \r\n  him. The will additionally named several nieces and nephews as alternate beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nIn 1993, 82-year-old Timmerman married Ingrid Zimmer. \r\n  Ingrid was over 30 years younger than Timmerman. Timmerman died less than two \r\n  years later of injuries resulting from an auto accident. Although Timmerman \r\n  consulted two estate-planning lawyers prior to his death, he never executed \r\n  any of the documents they prepared for him. \r\n\r\nIngrid brought an action under the omitted spouse \r\n  statute. The Probate Court held she was not an \"omitted spouse\" because of large \r\n  transfers totaling $1,191,000 Timmerman made to her outside of the will. \r\n  (7) This Court affirmed explaining \"the sheer magnitude of the transfers \r\n  from Timmerman to Ingrid is enough to support the probate court's finding that \r\n  Timmerman did not intend for Ingrid to receive any benefits under the omitted \r\n  spouse statute.\" Timmerman, 331 S.C. at 459, 502 S.E.2d at 922. As further \r\n  support for the ruling, this Court noted that despite seeking estate planning \r\n  advice, Timmerman \"chose to leave his old will intact.\" Id. Martin similarly \r\n  chose to leave his prior will and estate plan intact.\r\n\r\nGreen seeks to distinguish Timmerman by \r\n  arguing Marilyn only received \"nominal\" property as Martin's special friend \r\n  and no provisions were made for her after the marriage. The evidence in this \r\n  case demonstrates that Martin did not want to change his will after marriage \r\n  and that he provided for Marilyn by means of transfers outside the will. Additionally, \r\n  on the same day he executed the will, Martin specifically created a QTIP trust \r\n  for Marilyn in the capacity of his wife. This trust was above and beyond the \r\n  bequests to Marilyn as \"special friend.\"\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Probate Code attempts to reconcile two competing \r\n  goals: to effectuate the testator's intent and to provide for the surviving \r\n  spouse. Martin's intent to provide for Marilyn with the QTIP Trust and other \r\n  bequests is evident from the face of the will and trust agreement.\r\n\r\nBecause Green failed to demonstrate a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact existed regarding Marilyn's qualification as an \"omitted spouse\" \r\n  under the statute, the judgment of the Circuit Court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and SHULER, JJ., concur. \r\n1.   Cothran \r\n  had known Martin since 1993.  \r\n2.   Article \r\n  VI, (1)(a) of the Agreement stated \"Trust C shall be all of the Trust estate \r\n  as to which a \"QTIP election\" is made. All other assets of the Trust estate \r\n  including that part which is effectively disclaimed by the Settlor's \r\n  special friend (if she is the Settlor's wife) under paragraph (3) \r\n  herein shall become a part of Trust B.\" (emphasis added). It further stated \r\n  in subsection (c):\r\n\r\n\r\n  The term \"QTIP\" means \"qualified terminable interest \r\n    property\" as defined in the Internal Revenue Code. A \"QTIP election\" means \r\n    an election made by the Personal Representative of the Settlor's estate (or \r\n    other authorized person) made pursuant to Internal Revenue Code section \r\n    2056(b)(7) or any similar section which has the effect of qualifying \r\n    any asset to which it applies as part of the marital deduction in the Settlor's \r\n    estate tax calculation. No QTIP election may be made if the Settlor's \r\n    special friend is not the Settlor's wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n(italics in original) (emphasis added). \r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) Disclaimed Property to Trust \r\n    C. If the Settlor's special friend survives the Settlor and \r\n    she is the Settlor's wife and she or her legal representative makes a \r\n    qualified disclaimer (as defined in Section 2518 of the Internal \r\n    Revenue Code) of (a) any portion of the Trust estate that would otherwise \r\n    pass to her by the Settlor's Will, or (b) any property that would pass to \r\n    her outside of the Settlor's Will so as to cause that property to become part \r\n    of the Settlor's probate estate or the Settlor's taxable estate, the property \r\n    that is disclaimed shall pass to the trustee (in the same manner as if the \r\n    Settlor's special friend had predeceased the Settlor) and shall be held, administered, \r\n    and distributed under the terms of Trust C. No disclaimed \r\n    property shall become a part of Trust C if the \r\n    Settlor's special friend is not the Settlor's wife.\r\n\r\n  (3) Disclaimed Property to Trust B. \r\n    If the Settlor's special friend survives the Settlor and \r\n    she is the Settlor's wife  and she or her legal representative makes a \r\n    qualified disclaimer (as defined in Section 2518 of the Internal \r\n    Revenue Code) of any portion of Trust C, the portion that \r\n    is disclaimed shall pass to the trustee of Trust B (in the \r\n    same manner as if the Settlor's special friend had predeceased the Settlor) \r\n    and shall be held, administered, and distributed under the terms of Trust \r\n    B.\r\n\r\n\r\n(italics in original) (emphasis in original, in \r\n  part, and added, in part). \r\n\r\nArticle VIII mandated: \"There shall \r\n  be no Trust C unless the Settlor's special friend is also his wife; therefore[,] \r\n  all references in this ARTICLE are to the Settlor's \"wife.\" (emphasis \r\n  in original, in part, and added, in part). Trust C provisions directed the trustee \r\n  to pay all income from the trust to the Settlor's wife during \r\n  her lifetime. At the wife's death, any remaining principal of consent of the \r\n  Settlor's spouse if the spouse survived the Settlor.\r\n\r\nArticle XII addressed the Marital Deduction Savings \r\n  Clause for Trust C, stating in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is the Settlor's intention that the Settlor's \r\n    wife under the provisions of Trust C have substantially \r\n    that degree of beneficial enjoyment of the Trust Estate during her lifetime[,] \r\n    which the principles of the law of trusts accord to a person who is unqualifiedly \r\n    designated as the life beneficiary of a trust[,] and the Trustee shall not \r\n    exercise its discretion in a manner [that] is not in accord with this expressed \r\n    intention. The Trustee shall invest the Trust Estate so it will \r\n    produce for the Settlor's wife during her lifetime an income or use which \r\n    is consistent with the value of the Trust Estate and with its preservation. \r\n    It is expressly provided that the Trustee shall not[,] in the exercise of \r\n    its discretion[,] make any determination inconsistent with the foregoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original, in part, and added, in part). \r\n   \r\n 3.   The \r\n  trial court did not address whether an action under the omitted spouse statute \r\n  survives the omitted spouse and may be brought by a personal representative. \r\n  We decline to address that issue. \r\n4.   Compare \r\n  this section with the Uniform Probate Code Â§2-301(a) (as amended in 1993), which \r\n  states:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If a testator's surviving spouse married the testator \r\n    after the testator executed his [or her] will, the surviving spouse is entitled \r\n    to receive, as an intestate share, no less than the value of the share of \r\n    the estate he [or she] would have received if the testator had died intestate \r\n    as to that portion of the testator's estate, if any, that neither is devised \r\n    to a child of the testator who was born before the testator married the surviving \r\n    spouse and who is not a child of the surviving spouse nor is devised to a \r\n    descendant of such a child or passes under Sections 2-603 or 2-604 to such \r\n    a child or to a descendant of such a child unless:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1) it appears from the will or other evidence \r\n      that the will was made in contemplation of the testator's marriage to the \r\n      surviving spouse;\r\n\r\n    (2) the will expresses the intention that it is \r\n      to be effective notwithstanding any subsequent marriage; or\r\n\r\n    (3) the testator provided for the spouse by transfer \r\n      outside the will and the intent that the transfer be in lieu of a testamentary \r\n      provision is shown by the testator's statements or is reasonably inferred \r\n      from the amount of the transfer or other evidence.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n5.  The first two criteria are \r\n  described as \"qualifying\" conditions and the latter two as \"exclusionary\" conditions. \r\n  David E.

I. Du Pont de Nemours at several locations, \r\n  including the facility located in Camden, South Carolina. The trial court granted \r\n  the respondents' motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction based \r\n  upon the Door Closing Statute. (1) Murphy and \r\n  her husband appeal. (2) We reverse and remand. \r\n  (3)  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nJanet B. Murphy and David M. Murphy, who are wife \r\n  and husband, brought this action seeking damages for injuries that they sustained \r\n  after Janet developed mesothelioma from an alleged household exposure to asbestos. \r\n  The Murphys allege Janet developed the disease as a result of inhaling asbestos \r\n  fibers trapped in her father's clothing. From 1966 to 1969, Janet was a resident \r\n  of South Carolina while her father, Dr. Charles Baker, worked for E.I. Du Pont \r\n  de Nemours at its facility in Camden. Before and after that time, he worked \r\n  at other Du Pont facilities in Virginia and Europe. Dr. Baker testified by deposition, \r\n  however, that he was exposed to more asbestos in Camden than in the other locations. \r\n  \r\n\r\nDr. Baker stated that one of his major projects \r\n  at the Camden plant was the development of a larger, higher capacity spinning \r\n  cell for spinning Orlon acrylic fiber. He stated that the equipment involved \r\n  in the spinning process was continually reconfigured which exposed him to insulation \r\n  material while he observed the removal and re-installation of the equipment. \r\n  He was also exposed to asbestos in other areas of the Camden plant where various \r\n  equipment changes were taking place. Dr. Baker stated there was always evidence \r\n  of some dust in the area and he specifically recalled times when his clothes \r\n  were dusty.\r\n\r\nJanet, born in 1960, lived at home with her parents \r\n  until she entered college in 1978. In 1982 she moved to Virginia where her condition \r\n  was eventually diagnosed. (4) Shortly thereafter, \r\n  Dr. Baker came to believe he had exposed his daughter to asbestos through his \r\n  clothing. He held her as an infant and maintained a close relationship with \r\n  her as she grew. Janet testified in her deposition that she would routinely \r\n  crawl into his lap when he returned home from work and they would read stories \r\n  or watch television.\r\n\r\nDr. Victor L. Roggli, a board certified pathologist \r\n  with extensive experience with asbestos related diseases, examined Janet's tissue \r\n  specimens, medical records, and exposure history. In an affidavit submitted \r\n  to the court, he concluded: \"Janet Murphy's exposure to the asbestos fibers \r\n  in her father's clothes while he was employed by Du Pont at the Camden, South \r\n  Carolina facility from January 1966 to July 1969 was a proximate cause of the \r\n  development of [her] mesothelioma in that these Camden, South Carolina exposures \r\n  significantly contributed to the development of her mesothelioma.\" Dr. Roggli \r\n  also stated that Janet's \"Camden, S. C. exposure from January 1966 to July 1969 \r\n  was sufficient, in and of itself, to have caused mesothelioma.&quot;\r\n\r\nThe respondents moved to dismiss the action, asserting \r\n  the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Murphys' complaint \r\n  based upon the application of the Door Closing Statute. The trial court agreed \r\n  and dismissed the Murphys' claims, finding that the South Carolina Door Closing \r\n  Statute restricted its subject matter jurisdiction \"for claims brought by non-resident \r\n  plaintiffs against non-resident defendants to causes of action that shall have \r\n  arisen in this state,\" and further that the Murphys' action did not arise in \r\n  South Carolina because the injury-the impairment from the development of mesothelioma-was \r\n  diagnosed in Virginia. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis is an appeal from the grant of a motion to \r\n  dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. The question of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction is a question of law for the court. Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., \r\n  315 S.C. 329, 433 S.E.2d 890 (Ct. App. 1993), vacated on other grounds by, \r\n  319 S.C. 240, 460 S.E.2d 392 (1995). In determining whether to dismiss based \r\n  on lack of jurisdiction, the court may consider \"affidavits and other evidence \r\n  outside the pleadings . . .\" without converting the motion into one for summary \r\n  judgment. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 529, 511 S.E.2d 69, \r\n  74 (1999).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nAs a preliminary matter, the respondents contend \r\n  the order of the circuit court is not immediately appealable because the Murphys' \r\n  claims against one defendant still remain. The trial court did not grant the \r\n  motion to dismiss with respect to Covil Corporation because it is a South Carolina \r\n  corporation.\r\n  \r\n  The respondents rely upon State ex rel. McLeod v. C&amp;L Corp., 280 \r\n  S.C. 519, 313 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 1984), in support of their argument. In that \r\n  case, the trial court granted summary judgment to two defendants during the \r\n  course of the proceedings. Although an immediate appeal was not taken, after \r\n  the entry of a final order, the Attorney General filed a cross appeal raising \r\n  the issue of summary judgment. The two defendants argued the cross appeal should \r\n  be dismissed because the summary judgment order was a final order from which \r\n  an appeal had not been timely perfected. The supreme court denied the motion \r\n  to dismiss and transferred the case to this court for disposition. Our opinion \r\n  notes the supreme court's ruling on the motion to dismiss was binding on this \r\n  court. Judge Bell, writing for this court, stated that the Attorney General's \r\n  appeal from the final order was sufficient to bring the intermediate order granting \r\n  summary judgment before the court for review. The opinion states that \"[w]hen \r\n  multiple defendants are joined in the same action, an order dismissing some \r\n  but not all of them is ordinarily not final or appealable.\" Id. at 529, \r\n  313 S.E.2d at 340.\r\n\r\nThis particular point regarding dismissal of some, \r\n  but not all, multiple defendants has not been cited subsequently by our courts. \r\n  The McLeod case was cited as a general related authority in Plaza \r\n  Dev. Services v. Joe Harden Builder, Inc., 296 S.C. 115, 370 S.E.2d 893 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1988). In that case, this court held that an order granting a Rule \r\n  12(b)(6), SCRCP, motion as to some but not all claims against a single defendant \r\n  was not immediately appealable. However, the Plaza Development case was \r\n  overruled on that point by Link v. School Dist. of Pickens County, 302 \r\n  S.C. 1, 393 S.E.2d 176, nt. 2 (1990). In Link, the supreme court noted \r\n  it had previously held in Lebovitz v. Mudd, 289 S.C. 476, 347 S.E.2d \r\n  94 (1986) that an order granting a Rule 12(b)(6) motion as to one of multiple \r\n  claims is directly appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Section 14-3-330(2) because \r\n  it affects a substantial right and strikes out part of a pleading.\r\n\r\nIt is correct that the grant of the Rule 12(b)(1) \r\n  motion in this case is not a final order as there is a remaining defendant. \r\n  However, the practical effect of the grant of the motion is that it strikes \r\n  out the Murphys' complaint with respect to the respondents. Viewing McLeod \r\n  in light of Lebovitz and Link, we conclude an order granting a \r\n  Rule 12 motion as to some, but not all of the defendants in a case, is directly \r\n  appealable under Section 14-3-330(2) because it affects a substantial right \r\n  and strikes out part of a pleading.\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nThe Murphys contend the trial court erred in determining \r\n  that their cause of action \"arose\" in the state where the diagnosis was made \r\n  rather than where the exposure occurred for purposes of the South Carolina Door \r\n  Closing Statute. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Door Closing Statute, S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1976), provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  An action against a corporation created by or under \r\n    the laws of any other state, government or country may be brought in the circuit \r\n    court: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n* * *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (2) By a plaintiff not a resident of this state \r\n    when the cause of action shall have arisen or the \r\n    subject of the action shall be situated within this state.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added). This statutory provision prohibits \r\n  a non-resident from maintaining an action against a foreign corporation in a \r\n  South Carolina court unless the cause of action arose in South Carolina \r\n  or the subject of the action is located here. (5)\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that the Door Closing Statute \r\n  serves three basic legislative objectives related to the state's interests. \r\n  First, it favors resident plaintiffs over non-resident plaintiffs. Central \r\n  R.R. &amp; Banking v. Georgia Constr. &amp; Inv. Co., 32 S.C. 319, 11 S.E. \r\n  192 (1890). Second, it provides a forum for wrongs connected with the state \r\n  while avoiding the resolution of wrongs in which the state has little interest. \r\n  Rosenthal v. Unarco Industries, Inc., 278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 (1982); \r\n  Cox v. Lunsford, 272 S.C. 527, 252 S.E.2d 918 (1979). Third, it encourages \r\n  activity and investment within the state by foreign corporations without subjecting \r\n  them to actions unrelated to their activity within the state. Lipe v. Carolina, \r\n  C. &amp; O. Ry. Co., 123 S.C. 515, 116 S.E. 101 (1923).\r\n\r\nThe Door Closing Statute thus denies access to \r\n  our courts to non-resident plaintiffs with claims that have, at best, a tenuous \r\n  connection to this state. As evidenced in Rosenthal, the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court employs, in part, a connectedness test to determine the applicability \r\n  of the statute. Rosenthal, 278 S.C. at 424, 297 S.E.2d at 641.\r\n\r\nFederal courts interpreting the Door Closing Statute \r\n  have consistently recognized and followed our supreme court's emphasis on the \r\n  alleged wrong's connection or nexus to South Carolina. See Proctor \r\n  &amp; Schwartz, Inc. v. Rollins, 634 F.2d 738, 739 (4th Cir. 1980) (noting \r\n  that under the Door Closing Statute courts are denied subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  to entertain a suit involving a \"foreign cause of action brought by a foreign \r\n  plaintiff against a foreign corporation\"); Bumgarder v. Keene Corp., \r\n  593 F.2d 572 (4th Cir. 1979) (affirming the dismissal of an action under the \r\n  South Carolina Door Closing Statute because the non-resident's exposure to asbestos \r\n  occurred in North Carolina and the action could have been maintained there); \r\n  Collins v. R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 901 F. Supp. 1038, 1044 (D.S.C. \r\n  1995) (6) (granting defendant's motion for summary \r\n  judgment under the Door Closing Statute because the non-resident plaintiff failed \r\n  to submit proof \"that [his] injuries were 'directly connected' to his cigarette \r\n  purchases in South Carolina\").\r\n\r\nThe trial court concluded: \"South Carolina courts \r\n  use the verbs 'arise' and 'accrue' interchangeably while determining when \r\n  a cause of action comes into existence. . . . Thus a cause of action arises, \r\n  accrues, and springs into action only when all of the elements exist and one \r\n  has a right to seek relief . . . .\" (Emphasis in original) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nTo be sure, in the typical tort setting, the terms \r\n  are often interchangeable. See Stephens v. Draffin, 327 S.C. 1 \r\n  n.4, 488 S.E.2d 307 n.4 (1997). In Cornelius v. Atlantic Greyhound Lines, \r\n  177 S.C. 93, 180 S.E. 791 (1935), for example, our supreme court in a wrongful \r\n  ejectment action equated \"arise\" with \"accrue.\" There, the right of action arose \r\n  and accrued simultaneously. The instant case, however, presents a situation \r\n  that demonstrates the difference between the terms.\r\n\r\nA cause of action \"arises\" when the act or omission \r\n  that creates the right to bring suit happens or begins. Roques v. Continental \r\n  Cas. Co., 135 So. 51, 52-53 (La. Ct. App. 1931) (\"In 1 Words and Phrases, \r\n  Second Series, page 267, we find the following: 'The word 'arise' is used in \r\n  various senses with the words 'begin, mount, appear, happen, proceed from, exist.' \r\n  It has not the same significance as the word 'accrue,' which signifies 'result, \r\n  add, acquire, receive, benefit.' A cause of action 'arises,' *** when the obligation \r\n  was created which gave rise to a right of action as soon as such right accrued \r\n  thereon. Doughty v. Funk, 84 P. 484, 486, 15 Okl. 643, 4 L. R. A. (N. \r\n  S.) 1029 [(Okla. 1905)].'\").\r\n\r\nA cause of action \"accrues\" when it becomes \"complete \r\n  so that the aggrieved party can begin and prosecute such action.\" New York \r\n  Times Co. v. Conner, 291 F.2d 492, 495 (5th Cir. 1961); see also \r\n  Heinrich ex rel. Heinrich v. Sweet, 118 F. Supp. 2d 73, 78 (D. Mass. \r\n  2000) (\"According to Black's Law Dictionary . . . there is a subtle, yet important, \r\n  difference between the two words. 'Accrue' means '[t]o come into existence as \r\n  an enforceable claim or right.' Black's Law Dictionary 21 (7th ed. 1999). In \r\n  contrast, 'arise' means '[t]o originate' as in 'a federal claim arising under \r\n  the U.S. Constitution.'\" (citation omitted)); Randy's Sanitation, Inc. v. \r\n  Wright County, Minn., 65 F. Supp. 2d 1017, 1022 (D. Minn. 1999) (\"As a general \r\n  rule, a claim does not accrue until the plaintiff has 'a complete and present \r\n  cause of action.'\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\nThe record establishes that the alleged wrongdoing, \r\n  from which the Murphys' right to bring this action proceeds, originated in South \r\n  Carolina. Their claims, therefore, arose in this state even though they \r\n  did not accrue until the mesothelioma was diagnosed.\r\n\r\nIn applying the Door Closing Statute, the manifestation \r\n  of injury through diagnosis, while relevant, is not dispositive in every case \r\n  for the purpose of determining whether a cause of action shall have arisen in \r\n  South Carolina. Such an approach is too simplistic and would lead to results \r\n  contrary to\r\n  existing case law and the legislative goals of the statute. \r\n   (7)\r\n\r\nWe hold that the Murphys may properly maintain their action in South Carolina, notwithstanding\r\nthe fact that the injury was diagnosed in Virginia.  The Murphys have demonstrated a sufficient\r\nconnection to this state by showing that the act giving rise to their right of action occurred in\r\nSouth Carolina.  We further believe that the exercise of jurisdiction under these circumstances\r\nwould be entirely consistent with, and would serve, the laudable goals of the Door Closing\r\nStatute.  Accordingly, South Carolina must open its courtroom doors to the\r\nMurphys' claims.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, reverse and remand to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, A.C.J., CURETON, SHULER, JJ., DAVIS, MOREHEAD, and WILLIAMS,\r\nA.J., concur.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs in part and dissents in part in a separate opinion in which MCKELLAR,\r\nA.J., concurs. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUFF, J.:  I \r\n  respectfully concur in part and dissent in part.

(8) Janet Murphy, a Virginia \r\n  resident, alleged she developed mesothelioma as a result of \"household or familial\" \r\n  exposure to asbestos fiber on the clothing of her father, Dr. Charles Baker.\r\n\r\n\r\n    BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJanet Baker Murphy was born in Virginia in 1960. \r\n  She lived with her parents, the Bakers, until 1978 when she entered college. \r\n  After attending college, she returned to Virginia where she has resided since \r\n  1982. In July of 1995, Murphy was diagnosed with mesothelioma.\r\n\r\nJanet Murphy's father, Dr. Charles Baker, is a \r\n  chemical engineer who was employed by E. I. Du Pont de Nemours from 1951 until \r\n  his retirement in 1984. He worked at the Du Pont facility in Waynesboro, Virginia \r\n  from 1951 until 1966. From 1966 until 1969, Dr. Baker was employed at the Du \r\n  Pont plant in Camden, South Carolina. He returned to the Waynesboro facility \r\n  in mid-1969 and remained there until 1974. Dr. Baker spent the years from 1974 \r\n  until the summer of 1978 at a Du Pont facility in the Netherlands. He returned \r\n  to the Waynesboro plant in 1978 where he remained until his retirement in 1984.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Baker, his work over the years \r\n  at various Du Pont facilities caused him to be exposed to asbestos dust and \r\n  fibers. Dr. Baker testified by deposition that one of his major projects at \r\n  the Camden plant was the development of a larger, higher capacity spinning cell \r\n  for spinning Orlon acrylic fiber. The equipment involved in the spinning process \r\n  was continually reconfigured. Dr. Baker stated he was exposed to insulation \r\n  material while observing the removal and re-installation of the equipment. He \r\n  was also exposed to asbestos in other areas of the Camden plant where various \r\n  equipment changes were taking place. He stated there was always evidence of \r\n  some dust in the area and he specifically recalled times when his clothes were \r\n  dusty.\r\n\r\nAfter his daughter was diagnosed with mesothelioma, \r\n  Dr. Baker came to believe he had exposed his daughter to asbestos through his \r\n  clothing. He held her as an infant and maintained a close relationship with \r\n  her as she grew. Janet Murphy testified in her deposition that as a child she \r\n  was \"daddy's little girl.\" She would crawl into his lap and they would read \r\n  stories or watch television on a daily basis. When her father came home from \r\n  work, she would go through his coat pockets looking for mints. \r\n\r\nIn their motions to dismiss, the respondents asserted \r\n  the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Murphys' complaint \r\n  based upon application of the Door Closing Statute. After the receipt of memoranda \r\n  of law and a hearing, the circuit court granted the motions.\r\n\r\nThe court stated that since the Murphys were not \r\n  residents of South Carolina, jurisdiction rested on where the cause of action \r\n  arose. The court held that a cause of action \"arises, accrues, and springs into \r\n  action only when all of the elements exist and one has a right to seek \r\n  relief (i.e. a cause of action) based on such elements. Mere threat of future \r\n  injury is too speculative to support present adjudication.\" The trial court \r\n  concluded Janet Murphy's cause of action did not arise until she was diagnosed \r\n  with mesothelioma in Virginia in 1995. At that point, the final element (i.e. \r\n  injury) needed for a valid cause of action occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\n    DISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n The Murphys argue the trial court erred in its \r\n  application of the Door Closing Statute. They assert that, with respect to an \r\n  asbestos disease case, the cause of action arises in the state of exposure as \r\n  opposed to the state of diagnosis. The Murphys argue the statute's requirement \r\n  that the \"cause of action shall have arisen . . .within this state\" requires \r\n  a geographical connection to South Carolina. Since some of Janet Murphy's exposure \r\n  occurred in this state from 1966 through1969, the appellants contend they meet \r\n  the jurisdictional requirements of the Door Closing Statute.\r\n\r\nIn support of their geographical nexus argument, \r\n  the Murphys rely heavily upon three Door Closing Statute cases. In Bumgardner \r\n  v. Keene Corp, 593 F.2d 572 (4th Cir. 1979), the federal appeals \r\n  court held no countervailing federal considerations required it to ignore application \r\n  of the South Carolina Door Closing Statute. Accordingly, the circuit court affirmed \r\n  the district court decision to dismiss the asbestos disease case. The case states \r\n  Bumgardner could have maintained his suit in North Carolina, \"the state where \r\n  he lived, worked and was allegedly exposed to asbestos.\" Id. at 573. \r\n  In Collins v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co., 901 F. Supp. 1038 (D.S.C. 1995), \r\n  the federal district court held the Door Closing Statute jurisdictionally barred \r\n  a wrongful death suit by a Georgia resident against several foreign corporations. \r\n  The cause of action allegedly arose from Collins's development of emphysema \r\n  as a result of smoking cigarettes manufactured by the various corporate defendants. \r\n  The district court concluded Collins's claims arose in Georgia \"[b]ecause any \r\n  cigarette purchases by Collins in South Carolina were incidental to his job \r\n  as a truck driver and were minimal in nature, and because all of the remaining \r\n  connections to plaintiff's claims are with Georgia. . . .\" Id. at 1044. \r\n  In that regard, the court noted Collins lived in Georgia; worked for a Georgia \r\n  trucking company; and was diagnosed, treated, and died in Georgia. Finally, \r\n  in Rosenthal v. Unarco Industries, Inc., 278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 \r\n  (1982), the South Carolina Supreme Court held the Door Closing Statute was constitutional \r\n  as it did not violate equal protection. In the opinion, the court noted the \r\n  Door Closing Statute barred the plaintiff's claims as he was a New York State \r\n  resident and it was undisputed \"the plaintiff has sustained no exposure and \r\n  has not been employed within the state of South Carolina.\" Id. at 425, \r\n  297 S.E.2d at 642.\r\n\r\nI do not believe these three cases offer definitive \r\n  support for the appellants' position. The Bumgardner case is a two paragraph \r\n  opinion which provides no specific analysis of the facts as they relate to application \r\n  of the Door Closing Statute. The Collins case notes the facts of geographical \r\n  nexus with South Carolina, but it also makes a conclusion that \"one test for \r\n  determining where a cause of action arises is to ascertain where the delict \r\n  or wrong has its effect.\" Collins, 901 F. Supp. at 1044. Such an argument \r\n  cuts against the appellants' position since undoubtedly the delict in this case \r\n  has its effect in Virginia. Finally, the Rosenthal case is not dispositive \r\n  because the focus of that opinion was the constitutional law question.\r\n\r\nThe Door Closing Statute relates to the subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction of the circuit courts. Nix v. Mercury Motors Express \r\n  Inc., 270 S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978). Our supreme court has stated \r\n  the Door Closing Statute accomplishes several legislative objectives rationally \r\n  related to the state's interest. These objectives are (1) favoritism to resident \r\n  plaintiffs over nonresident plaintiffs, (2) provision of a forum for wrongs \r\n  connected with the state while avoiding the resolution of wrongs in which the \r\n  state has little interest, and (3) encouragement of activity and investment \r\n  in the state by foreign corporations without subjecting them to actions unrelated \r\n  to their activity within the state. Rosenthal v. Unarco Industries Inc., \r\n  278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 (1982).\r\n\r\nThe crucial language in the statute is \"when the \r\n  cause of action shall have arisen . . . within this [s]tate.\" In Ophuls &amp; \r\n  Hill v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 160 S.C. 441, 158 S.E. 824 (1931), \r\n  the supreme court defined the term \"cause of action\" in the context of the Door \r\n  Closing Statute. The court stated \"the cause of action has been described \r\n  as being a legal wrong threatened or committed against the complaining party.\" \r\n  Id. at 450, 158 S.E. at 827. See also Knight v. Fidelity &amp; Casualty \r\n  Co. of New York, 184 S.C. 362, 192 S.E. 558 (1937). With respect to the \r\n  term \"arise\" in the Door Closing Statute, the supreme court in Cornelius \r\n  v. Atlantic Grey Hound Lines, 177 S.C. 93, 180 S.E. 791 (1935), equated \r\n  \"arise\" with \"accrue\" and stated that a \"cause of action accrues when facts \r\n  exist which authorize one party to maintain an action against another.\" Id. \r\n  at 96, 180 S.E. at 792. (quoting 1 C.J. 1146). Beyond the context of the Door \r\n  Closing statute, the supreme court has stated that our cases have used the verbs \r\n  \"arise\" and \"accrue\" interchangeably and a cause of action in tort accrues at \r\n  the moment when the plaintiff has a legal right to sue on it. Stephens v. \r\n  Draffin, 327 S.C. 1, 488 S.E.2d 307 (1997).\r\n\r\nThe elements of a cause of action in tort are (1) \r\n  duty, (2) breach of that duty, (3) proximate causation, and (4) injury. Shipes \r\n  v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, 269 S.C. 479, 238 S.E.2d 167 (1977). In the \r\n  factual context of this case, all of those elements were met when Janet Murphy \r\n  was diagnosed with mesothelioma. Prior to that point, the element of injury \r\n  had not been established. Once injury was established, the cause of action or \r\n  \"legal wrong\" had \"arisen\" and Murphy could maintain an action in tort against \r\n  the respondents. Accordingly, the cause of action arose in Virginia, not South \r\n  Carolina.\r\n\r\nFor the above stated reasons, I would affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MCKELLAR, A.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  S.C.Code Ann. Â§15-5-150 \r\n  (1976); see also Nix v. Mercury Motor Express, Inc., 270 \r\n  S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978) (holding that the application of the Door Closing \r\n  Statute is a question of subject matter jurisdiction).  \r\n2.  Janet's husband, David Murphy, \r\n  claims loss of consortium. \r\n3. This case was originally \r\n  heard by a panel of this court, which issued an opinion affirming the trial \r\n  court's dismissal of the Murphys' claims. See Murphy v. Owens-Corning \r\n  Fiberglas Corp., Op. No. 3203 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 26, 2000). On October \r\n  5, 2000, the full Court of Appeals voted to rehear the case en banc pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. section 14-8-90 (Supp. 2000). Accordingly, the original panel \r\n  opinion is hereby withdrawn and the following opinion substituted therefor.\r\n\r\n4. Janet Murphy was diagnosed \r\n  with mesothelioma in July, 1995. As a result of the disease, Janet died during \r\n  the seven months that followed expedited oral argument. \r\n5.  We note that \"subject of \r\n  the action\" is typically inapplicable in personal injury actions. See \r\n  Ophuls &amp; Hill, Inc. v. Carolina Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 160 S.C. 441, \r\n  450, 158 S.E. 824, 827 (1931) (quoting Columbia Nat'l Bank v. Rizer, \r\n  153 S.C. 43, 55, 150 S.E. 316, 320 (1929), \"The subject of the action is . . \r\n  . not the wrong which gives the plaintiff the right to ask the interposition \r\n  of the court, nor is it that which the court is asked to do for him, but it \r\n  must be the matter or thing, differing both from the wrong and the relief, in \r\n  regard to which the controversy has arisen, concerning which the wrong has been \r\n  done; and this is, ordinarily, the property, or the contract and its subject-matter, \r\n  or other thing involved in the dispute.\") (emphasis omitted). \r\n6.  The fourth circuit affirmed \r\n  the decision in an unpublished opinion, reported in full at 1996 WL 452595. \r\n  The court stated: \"His purchase and use of cigarettes in South Carolina, which \r\n  remains unproven except for an insignificant percentage of the total packages \r\n  he bought and consumed . . . is too tenuous to qualify as 'causing' death in \r\n  the instant case.\" Id. at *2. The present case is clearly distinguishable. \r\n  The affidavit of Dr. Victor L. Roggli establishes a direct connection between \r\n  Janet Murphy's South Carolina exposure to asbestos and her subsequent development \r\n  of mesothelioma. \r\n7. For example, if a party were \r\n  injured by a foreign corporation from exposure to asbestos solely in South Carolina, \r\n  yet the diagnosis or manifestation of injury occurs only after the party moved \r\n  to another state, the dissent's approach would foreclose that party from maintaining \r\n  an action in our courts. Conversely, if a party were injured by exposure to \r\n  asbestos solely in a state other than South Carolina, yet the diagnosis or manifestation \r\n  of injury occurred here, the dissent's approach would permit the action to be \r\n  filed and pursued in the South Carolina courts merely because the \"element of \r\n  injury\" had been established in South Carolina. Such results would be contrary \r\n  to existing law and recognized legislative objectives. \r\n8.    \r\n  As relevant to this case, S.C.Code Ann. Â§15-5-150 (1977) provides \"[a]n action \r\n  against a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, government, \r\n  or country may be brought in the circuit court: (2) [b]y a plaintiff not a resident \r\n  of this State when the cause of action shall have arisen . . . within this State.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3355","title":"State v.

Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\nAssistant Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, Assistant Attorney General Melody J.\r\nBrown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor John R. Justice, of Chester, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J.:    Leroy Wilkes appeals his convictions for assaulting two correctional facility\r\nemployees, arguing the indictments did not confer subject matter jurisdiction on the trial court. (1)\r\nWe agree and vacate.\r\n\r\nWith limited exceptions, \"[n]o person may be held to answer for any crime the jurisdiction over\r\nwhich is not within the magistrate's court, unless on a presentment or indictment of a grand jury\r\nof the county where the crime has been committed . . . .\"  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11; S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 17-19-10 (1985).  This provision has been interpreted to mean that, in the absence of an\r\nindictment by the grand jury or a valid waiver of presentment, the circuit court lacks subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction over the offense. State v. Evans, 307 S.C. 477, 415 S.E.2d 816 (1992);\r\nState v.\r\nBeachum, 288 S.C. 325, 342 S.E.2d 597 (1986); Summerall v. State, 278 S.C. 255, 294 S.E.2d\r\n344 (1982). A circuit court, therefore, has subject matter jurisdiction only if:  (1) there has been\r\nan indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or\r\n(3) the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.\r\nCarter v. State,\r\n329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\nAn indictment is sufficient if the offense is stated with [enough] certainty and particularity to\r\nenable the court to know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is\r\ncalled upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon.  The true test\r\nof the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but\r\nwhether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently\r\napprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.\r\n\r\n\r\nBrowning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (citations omitted).  Ordinarily,\r\nan indictment \"phrased substantially\" in the language of the pertinent statute is sufficient.\r\nState v.\r\nShoemaker, 276 S.C. 86, 88, 275 S.E.2d 878, 879 (1981).\r\n\r\nWilkes was indicted and subsequently convicted of violating S.C. Code Ann. section 16-3-630,\r\nwhich provides criminal penalties for any \"assault upon an employee of a state or local\r\ncorrectional facility performing job-related duties . . . .\"  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-630 (Supp. 2000). \r\nThus, in order to contain the necessary elements of the offense, an indictment must allege first,\r\nthat an assault occurred; second, that the victim of the assault was a state or local correctional\r\nfacility employee; and third, that the employee was performing job-related duties.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the body of the first indictment charges:  \"That Leroy Wilkes did in Chester\r\nCounty on or about April 24, 1999 assault Officer Marilyn K. Givens while she was attempting to\r\nprocess him after arrest.\"  The body of the second indictment is identical to the first, except that it\r\nidentifies a male officer, Eric Schmid, as the victim of the assault.  Although both indictments\r\nallege Wilkes assaulted officers who were processing him, and thus performing job-related duties,\r\nthey fail to identify the officers as correctional facility employees. See \r\nBrown v. State, 343 S.C.\r\n342, 350, 540 S.E.2d 846, 850 (2001) (vacating convictions for lack of subject matter jurisdiction\r\nwhere \"the indictments on their face failed to contain a necessary element of the offense\").\r\n\r\nDespite this failure, the State asserts two grounds for finding the indictments in question conferred\r\njurisdiction.  First, the State argues the body of each indictment alleges the crime in the language\r\nof the statute.  Specifically, the State contends the officer's status as correctional facility\r\nemployees is contextually implied in the indictment.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nAlthough the indictments allege Wilkes assaulted officers who were attempting to process him\r\nafter his arrest, we do not think this implies that the officers were employees of a correctional\r\nfacility.  They could easily have been the arresting officers, who were not employees of such a\r\nfacility.   \r\n\r\nNext, the State argues the indictments are sufficient when the charging language in the body of\r\neach indictment is considered in conjunction with its caption.  Both of the indictments are\r\ncaptioned, \"ASSAULT ON CORRECTIONAL FACILITY EMPLOYEE Â§16-3-630.\" (2)  The State\r\ncontends the bodies of the indictments, combined with the statutory reference in the captions,\r\nenabled Wilkes to know what offenses he was \"called upon to answer\" as well as what plea he\r\nshould enter on the charges. Carter, 329 S.C. at 362, 495 S.E.2d at 777.  Again, we must disagree.\r\n\r\nClearly, the caption of an indictment is not part of the grand jury's findings.  Wilson v. State, 327\r\nS.C. 45, 488 S.E.2d 322 (1997); State v. Lark, 64 S.C. 350, 42 S.E. 175 (1902);\r\nState v. Warren,\r\n330 S.C. 584, 500 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1998), rev'd on other grounds, 341 S.C. 349, 534 S.E.2d\r\n687 (2000). For purposes of conferring jurisdiction, the grand jury presents upon its oath only\r\nthat which appears below the caption in the charging body of the indictment. Cf. \r\nState v. Bennett,\r\n156 S.E.2d 725, 726 (N.C. 1967) (\"The caption of an indictment . . . is not part of it and the\r\ndesignation therein of the offense sought to be charged can neither enlarge nor diminish the\r\noffense charged in the body of the instrument.\").\r\n\r\nReliance upon a caption to bolster a fatally deficient indictment is, therefore, contrary to the\r\nconstitutional mandate that, for most offenses, a defendant may only be required to answer an\r\nindictment of the grand jury.  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 11; cf. \r\nState v. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 141, 202\r\nS.E.2d 852, 854 (1974) (holding the State \"may not support a conviction for an offense intended\r\nto be charged by relying upon a caption to the exclusion of the language contained in the body of\r\nthe indictment\").\r\n\r\n\r\nThe indictment or information does not have to expressly allege each element of the crime if the\r\nstatute violated is referred to in the information or indictment and the missing element is set forth\r\nin the statute.  However, a reference to the statute and the class of crime in the caption of the\r\ninformation is not part of the information and cannot supply a missing essential element in the\r\ninformation. \r\n\r\n\r\n42 C.J.S. Indictments and Informations Â§ 113 (1991) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nMoreover, this case is distinguishable from State v.\r\nAssmann, 46 S.C. 554, 24 S.E. 673 (1896),\r\nwhere an indictment that failed to allege the county in which the crime occurred was held to\r\nconfer jurisdiction because the county's name appeared in the caption and margin.\r\nId. at 559-60,\r\n24 S.E. at 675.  In that case, as well as in numerous cases cited therein, the indictment was held\r\nvalid because the county named in the caption and margin was incorporated by reference into the\r\nbody itself with language such as \"the county and state aforesaid.\" Id. at 559-60, 24 S.E. at 673-75;\r\nsee also  State v. Nelson, 514 S.W.2d 581 (Mo. 1974) (holding that the person named as the\r\ndefendant in the caption and referred to in the body of the indictment by the words \"the\r\ndefendant\" was clearly the party charged with the offense stated); State v. Johnson, 335 S.E.2d\r\n770, 771 (N.C. 1985) (holding that the use of referencing language such as \"the defendant named\r\nabove\" is sufficient to satisfy the requirement that a valid indictment must name or otherwise\r\nidentify the defendant, where the defendant's name appeared in the caption).  Here, no such\r\nreference exists.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause the indictments failed to allege the victims were correctional facility employees, a\r\nnecessary element of the offense, the trial court lacked  subject matter jurisdiction to convict\r\nWilkes of the assaults.  Accordingly, the resulting convictions and sentences are\r\n\r\n\r\nVACATED.\r\n\r\nCURETON, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Respectfully,\r\nI dissent. In evaluating the sufficiency of an indictment, this court should\r\n&quot;look at the issue with a practical eye in view of the surrounding\r\ncircumstances.&quot; State v.\r\nGunn, 313 S.C. 124, 130, 437 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1993); see\r\nalso State v. Thompson,\r\n305 S.C. 496, 501 n.1, 409 S.E.2d 420, 423 n.1 (Ct. App. 1991) (giving &quot;a\r\ncommon sense reading [to] the indictment as a whole&quot;). If the offense is\r\nstated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the trial court to\r\nknow what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called\r\nupon to answer, the indictment passes legal muster. Carter\r\nv. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998); State\r\nv. Hamilton, 344 S.C. 344, --, 543 S.E.2d 586, 597 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nWhen these indictments are viewed in their entirety with a practical eye, I\r\nbelieve they were sufficient to enable both the trial court and Wilkes to know\r\nwhat crimes they alleged.\r\nThe indictments state that Givens and\r\nSchmid were &quot;officers&quot; and that the assault occurred while they\r\nattempted to process Wilkes &quot;after arrest.&quot; The majority holds the\r\nindictments are fatally defective because the language employed could be\r\nconstrued to identify Givens and Schmid as arresting officers rather than\r\nofficers employed by a state or local correctional facility as provided by S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 16-3-360 (Supp. 2000). I disagree. In my view, the indictments are\r\nnot fatally defective simply because they fail to allege that Givens and Schmid\r\nwere correctional facility employees. The caption of each indictment clearly\r\nstates the charge as &quot;assault on correctional facility employee.&quot;\r\nMoreover, the title, located just above the charging language on the same page,\r\nreads &quot;assault on correctional facility employee&quot; and refers to\r\n&quot;Â§ 16-3-630.&quot;\r\nI do not read State\r\nv. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 202 S.E.2d 852 (1974), as broadly as the\r\nmajority opinion to hold that a reviewing court cannot consider a caption or a\r\ntitle in reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment. Tabory\r\nholds that &quot;the State may not support a conviction for an offense intended\r\nto be charged by relying upon a caption to the exclusion of the\r\nlanguage contained in the body of the indictment.&quot; 262 S.C. at 141,\r\n202 S.E.2d at 854 (emphasis supplied). It does not hold that the caption of an\r\nindictment may not be considered when, as here, it is consistent with the\r\ncharging language, nor does it prohibit the court from looking at the title of\r\nan indictment when scrutinizing it for legal sufficiency. In the past, this\r\ncourt has looked to the title of an indictment as a factor in determining\r\nsufficiency. See Hamilton,\r\n344 S.C. at --, 543 S.E.2d at 597 (considering title in finding indictment\r\nsufficient). If there was any doubt in the mind of the trial judge or Wilkes as\r\nto what type of &quot;officers&quot; Givens and Schmid were, it was clarified by\r\nthe language in the title located immediately above the charging language.\r\nViewing the indictments &quot;with a practical eye,&quot; I would hold that\r\nwhere they specifically identify the victims as officers assaulted by Wilkes\r\nafter his arrest, and the title cites the relevant statute and refers to\r\ncorrectional facility employees, the indictments are sufficient to confer\r\njurisdiction on the trial court. Accordingly, I would affirm the trial judge.\r\n1.   Wilkes was also convicted of resisting arrest, but that conviction is not part of this appeal.\r\n  2.  Additionally, the words \"assault on correctional officer\" and \"assault on correctional facility\r\nemployee\" appear in the titles of the first and second indictments respectively.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3356","title":"Keeney's Metal Roofing, Inc. v.

Lynn, of North Charleston, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        Richmond Truesdale, Jr., of Adams Run, \r\n          pro se.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCONNOR, J.:  Richmond Truesdale, Jr., was convicted in magistrate's court of uttering a fraudulent check in violation of\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-11-60 (1987 &amp; Supp. 2000).  He appealed and the circuit court ordered the matter remanded for trial,\r\nfinding there was no evidence Truesdale entered a valid guilty plea.  The State appeals. (1)  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\nOn October 18, 1995, Truesdale was arrested for allegedly writing a fraudulent check in the amount of $168.00 to the South\r\nCarolina Department of Revenue and Taxation.  Truesdale was scheduled to appear for trial before magistrate Bonnie\r\nKoontz-Stickels (now Koontz) on November 9, 1995.    \r\n\r\nOn that day, Truesdale reported to Judge Koontz's court.  It is undisputed that court was delayed that day, although there is\r\nsome dispute about the reason.  During the delay, the arresting officer and Judge Koontz's staff advised those present that\r\nanyone who wanted to plead guilty and make restitution could do so immediately, rather than waiting for the magistrate.\r\nTruesdale agreed to pay restitution of $168.00 for the check and a $25.00 returned check fee, plus court costs of $94.00. \r\nTruesdale paid $25.00 of his court costs and signed a Standard Time Payment form agreeing to pay the remaining balance\r\nof $71.82 by November 30, 1995. (2)  Judge Koontz was not present during this time. (3) \r\n\r\nOn November 20, 1995, Truesdale timely filed a handwritten appeal with Judge Koontz asserting he was denied the right to\r\na jury trial.  According to Judge Koontz, Truesdale spoke to her sometime after he filed his appeal, indicating that he\r\nneeded more time to pay the remaining court costs.  Therefore, she reminded him that he had until the end of the month to\r\npay the balance.  Truesdale subsequently paid the remaining court costs on the November 30, 1995 due date.  Judge Koontz\r\nstated she assumed the appeal was moot at that point and closed the file.    \r\n\r\nIn contrast, Truesdale maintains he contacted the magistrate's office several times to inquire about the status of his appeal,\r\nand Judge Koontz advised him the papers regarding the disposition of his case were at the police department.  Truesdale\r\nthereafter went to the circuit court and determined a return and other papers pertinent to the appeal had not been forwarded\r\nto the circuit court from the magistrate's office.  In October 1996, Truesdale went to the Charleston County Police\r\nDepartment to check his criminal record.  He had a conviction for a fraudulent check. \r\n\r\nIn March of 1998, Truesdale filed a petition for a writ of mandamus against Judge Koontz.  The petition was dismissed by\r\nthe circuit court for failure to properly serve the magistrate.  Truesdale filed another petition and properly served Judge\r\nKoontz.  On September 20, 1999, the circuit court construed Truesdale's petition as a motion to restore the appeal and\r\ndirected the magistrate to file a return.  Judge Koontz filed a return on September 30, 1999.  \r\n\r\nOn October 6, 1999, the appeal was heard before the circuit court.  Truesdale maintained that he was coerced into pleading\r\nguilty, after consistently asserting his right to a jury trial.  According to Truesdale, Officer Casale told him that if he did not\r\npay restitution, the return fee, and court costs, he would go to jail.  Truesdale states he never pled guilty before a judge and\r\nalways made it clear that he desired a jury trial.  The circuit court remanded the matter for trial, stating \"[t]here was no\r\nevidence that a plea was entered before a judge.\"  This appeal followed. (4)\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the circuit court erred in reversing Truesdale's conviction for check fraud on the basis there was no\r\nevidence Truesdale entered a guilty plea to the charge. \r\n\r\n\"A defendant's knowing and voluntary waiver of \r\n  a statutory or constitutional right must be established by a complete record; \r\n  and may be accomplished by colloquy between the court and the defendant, between \r\n  the court and defendant's counsel, or both.\" State v. Ray, 310 S.C. 431, \r\n  437, 427 S.E.2d 171, 174 (1993). \"Of course, a guilty plea may not be accepted \r\n  unless it is voluntarily entered with an understanding of the nature and consequences \r\n  of the charge and the plea.\" State v. Lambert, 266 S.C. 574, 578, 225 \r\n  S.E.2d 340, 341-42 (1976).\r\n\r\n\"[B]efore a court can accept a guilty plea, a defendant \r\n  must be advised of the constitutional rights he is waiving. Specifically, a \r\n  defendant must be aware of the privilege against self-incrimination, the right \r\n  to a jury trial, and the right to confront one's accusers.\" Roddy v. State, \r\n  339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000) (citation omitted). \"[T]he trial \r\n  judge usually questions the defendant about the facts surrounding the crime \r\n  and punishment that could be imposed.\" Id. at 34, 528 S.E.2d at 421. \r\n  However, the trial judge need not \"direct the defendant's attention to each \r\n  and every constitutional right and obtain a separate waiver of each.\" Lambert, \r\n  266 S.C. at 578-79, 225 S.E.2d at 342.\r\n\r\nIn the current appeal, the arrest warrant indicates Truesdale was found guilty before Judge Koontz on November 9, 1995. \r\nHowever, both \"bench trial\" and \"plea\" are circled on the line designated for the type of disposition.  On the line indicating\r\nthe sentence imposed, the notation \"94 STP\" appears, which presumably stands for the $94.00 court costs and the Standard\r\nTime Payment form completed. \r\n\r\nIt is undisputed that Truesdale never appeared before Judge Koontz or any other magistrate to enter a formal guilty plea\r\nafter having been advised of his constitutional rights.  However, the State contends that Truesdale indicated to the clerk and\r\nthe deputy that he wished to plead guilty and he posted the required bond, which included restitution in the amount of\r\n$193.00 ($168.00 plus a $25.00 returned check fee), and a portion of the court costs.  The State asserts:  \"As clear evidence\r\nof this, the Defendant signed a Standard Time Payment and timely paid the remainder plus the required 3% fee.\"  The State\r\nargues \"[t]he requirement that the plea is voluntary and freely given can be verified by the Magistrate by the Respondent's\r\npayment of the restitution and court costs.\"  The State maintains Truesdale's case is no different from the procedure for\r\nforfeiting bond and entering a conviction when a defendant is issued a Uniform Traffic Ticket and pays the bond before\r\ntrial, and that the same procedure is appropriate here.  \r\n\r\nWe agree with the circuit court that the Standard \r\n  Time Payment form is insufficient evidence that Truesdale intended to enter \r\n  a guilty plea to the fraudulent check charge. This situation is distinguishable \r\n  from the procedures followed in disposing of charges under a Uniform Traffic \r\n  Ticket. First, the Uniform Traffic Ticket statute enumerates certain offenses \r\n  that can be charged under the ticket, such as littering, ticket scalping, parking \r\n  on private property without permission, trespassing, etc. S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 56-7-10 (Supp. 2000). Secondly, in the case of traffic offenses, South Carolina \r\n  has a specific statutory provision that the payment of bond and the forfeiture \r\n  of that bond prior to trial for traffic offenses shall have the same effect \r\n  as a guilty plea and conviction. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-6220 (1991); see \r\n  also Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999) (discussing \r\n  statutes where Legislature has defined bond forfeiture as the equivalent of \r\n  conviction). However, the offense of uttering a fraudulent check cannot be charged \r\n  with a Uniform Traffic Ticket. Moreover, Truesdale was properly charged with \r\n  issuing a fraudulent check by a warrant. \r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the circuit court, the deputy county attorney could not identify any comparable provision allowing the\r\nentry of a guilty plea and a conviction without the judge in this instance, and no citation to authority has been provided on\r\nappeal.  We note, however, that under section 34-11-70(c) of the South Carolina Code, a magistrate may properly dispose\r\nof a fraudulent check charge prior to trial upon the defendant's payment of restitution and court costs, but the statute\r\nspecifically provides that the resulting disposition is a dismissal, not a conviction:\r\n\r\n\r\nAny court, including magistrates, may dismiss any prosecution initiated pursuant to the provisions of this chapter on\r\nsatisfactory proof of restitution and payment by the defendant of all administrative costs accruing not to exceed forty-one\r\ndollars submitted before the date set for trial after the issuance of a warrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-11-70(c) (Supp. 2000) (At the \r\n  time of Truesdale's offense, the amount of administrative costs did not exceed \r\n  twenty-five dollars. An amendment to the statute has since increased this amount.); \r\n  cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;34-11-90(a) (Supp. 2000) (conviction for \r\n  a first offense is punishable by a fine of not less than $50 nor more than $200 \r\n  or by imprisonment for not more than 30 days). \r\n\r\nAccordingly, since we find there is no record of a guilty plea in this case, and the check charge was not dismissed, we\r\naffirm the order of the circuit court remanding the matter for trial.\r\n\r\nWe have considered the State's argument that our decision will essentially eliminate the quick disposition of magistrate\r\ncases.  The State appears to interpret a decision affirming the circuit court to require all defendants to appear before the\r\nmagistrate in every case.  Although this decision will impact the procedure for certain cases, it will not have the far-reaching implications that concern the State.  Specifically, it should only affect those cases which do not fall within the\r\nstatutorily prescribed procedure permitting bond forfeitures or payment of restitution and fines prior to appearing before the\r\nmagistrate. (5)\r\n\r\n        Based on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is \r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. (6)  \r\n\r\nHUFF and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Initially, the magistrate \r\n  was listed as a party in the caption for this appeal. Because we questioned \r\n  whether the magistrate had standing, we requested the deputy county attorney \r\n  and Truesdale to file supplemental briefs addressing this issue. These briefs \r\n  confirmed that the appeal is properly on behalf of the State. See, e.g., \r\n  State v. Barbee, 280 S.C. 328, 313 S.E.2d 297 (1984) (appeal by the State \r\n  from circuit court's decision reversing and remanding respondent's magistrate \r\n  court conviction); State v. Eaves, 260 S.C. 523, 197 S.E.2d 282 (1973) \r\n  (same); State v. Adams, 244 S.C. 323, 137 S.E.2d 100 (1964) (same). Thus, \r\n  we have amended the caption to reflect the proper parties and the caption as \r\n  originally presented in the magistrate's court. See Rule 238(a), SCACR. \r\n2.   The Standard Time Payment added a 3% collection fee to the $94 court costs, or $2.82, leaving $71.82 due after\r\nTruesdale's payment.\r\n3.   Truesdale has paid the restitution due to the Department of Revenue.     \r\n 4.  The circuit court did not \r\n  address the timeliness of Truesdale's petition for a writ of mandamus and the \r\n  issue is not argued here. Accordingly, we need not consider it. Although Truesdale \r\n  should have proceeded with a mandamus much sooner than he did, there is not \r\n  a per se time limit for filing a petition for a writ of mandamus. See \r\n  State v. Barbee, 280 S.C. 328, 313 S.E.2d 297 (1984) (defendant allowed \r\n  to petition for a writ of mandamus to compel magistrate to file with the circuit \r\n  court a record of the trial proceedings even after the appeal reached the Supreme \r\n  Court); State v. Eaves, 260 S.C. 523, 197 S.E.2d 282 (1973) (same); cf. \r\n  State v. Adams, 244 S.C. 323, 326, 137 S.E.2d 100, 101 (1964) (It is \r\n  the duty of the defendant as the moving party to prosecute an appeal with due \r\n  diligence and have it promptly disposed of, and should the magistrate fail to \r\n  perform the ministerial duty of filing a return, it is incumbent on the defendant \r\n  to obtain the magistrate's compliance by a petition for a writ of mandamus, \r\n  if necessary). We note, however, there is no dispute as to the timeliness of \r\n  Truesdale's notice of appeal to the magistrate. \r\n 5.  Moreover, contrary to the \r\n  State's assertion, we do not foresee any impact on trials in absentia, given \r\n  this mode of case resolution is decidedly different from the procedure employed \r\n  in this case. In order for a criminal defendant to be tried in absentia, certain \r\n  requirements must first be met. Rule 16, SCRCrimP. A trial judge must determine \r\n  a defendant voluntarily waived his right to be present at trial in order to \r\n  try the case in absentia. Id.; State v. Ritch, 292 S.C. 75, 354 \r\n  S.E.2d 909 (1987); State v. Jackson, 288 S.C. 94, 341 S.E.2d 375 (1986); \r\n  State v. Castineira, 341 S.C. 619, 535 S.E.2d 449 (Ct. App. 2000). The \r\n  judge must make findings of fact on the record that the defendant (1) received \r\n  notice of his right to be present; and (2) was warned that the trial would proceed \r\n  in his absence should he fail to attend. Jackson, 288 S.C. at 96, 341 \r\n  S.E.2d at 375; Castineira, 341 S.C. at 623, 535 S.E.2d at 451. \r\n\r\n\r\n  Our decision in no way limits this procedure. \r\n  Although the instant case presents a different procedural posture in that a \r\n  trial was not conducted, Truesdale did appear in magistrate's court. If Truesdale \r\n  had not appeared and the magistrate was present to make the requisite findings, \r\n  Truesdale could have properly been tried in his absence. \r\n 6.  Because we find Truesdale \r\n  should have been given the opportunity to either plead guilty before the magistrate \r\n  or proceed to trial, we find it unnecessary to address the State's second issue \r\n  concerning the factual basis of the circuit court's ruling. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3358","title":"S.C.

South Carolina Coastal Conservation \r\n  League (SCCCL) and Sierra Club appeal, arguing the South Carolina Beachfront \r\n  Management Act prohibits such construction. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn April 1996 Port Royal Plantation applied to \r\n  the Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM), a division of DHEC, \r\n  for a permit to construct four new groins and refurbish a series of seventeen \r\n  existing groins (a \"groin field\") along approximately 8,000 feet of shoreline \r\n  at Hilton Head. (1) OCRM issued the permit on \r\n  October 2, 1996.  \r\n\r\nSCCCL and Sierra Club filed a petition for administrative \r\n  review of the permit decision and requested a contested case hearing before \r\n  the ALJD. The petition named Port Royal Plantation and OCRM as respondents, \r\n  and the administrative law judge (ALJ) granted the Town of Hilton Head's motion \r\n  to intervene. Thereafter, the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment. \r\n  Prior to the hearing, the parties stipulated to the relevant facts and agreed \r\n  that the only issue remaining was a question of law for the court: Whether the \r\n  Beachfront Management Act prohibited the proposed construction.  \r\n\r\nBy order dated June 16, 1998, the ALJ found the \r\n  permit to refurbish the groin field and construct new groins valid. SCCCL and \r\n  Sierra Club appealed this decision to the OCRM's Coastal Zone Management Appellate \r\n  Panel, which adopted the order of the ALJ and affirmed on December 17. SCCCL \r\n  and Sierra Club subsequently sought judicial review in the circuit court, which \r\n  likewise affirmed DHEC's grant of the permit in an order filed February 7, 2000. \r\n  This appeal followed. \r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper when \"the pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. \r\n  318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997).  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, a reviewing court may reverse the decision \r\n  of an administrative agency if a party's substantial rights are prejudiced by \r\n  a decision which \"violate[s] constitutional or statutory provisions . . . .\" \r\n  Weaver v. S.C. Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368, 374, 423 S.E.2d 340, 343 \r\n  (1992); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(6) (Supp. 2000).  \r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole issue in this appeal is whether the groin \r\n  construction and refurbishment permit issued by DHEC to Port Royal Plantation \r\n  violates the statutory provisions of the Beachfront Management Act. We believe \r\n  it does.  \r\n\r\nIn 1977 our Legislature passed the Coastal Zone \r\n  Management Act (CZMA) to \"protect, preserve, restore and enhance the coastal \r\n  resources of South Carolina.\" 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1(C)(1) (Supp. 2000); \r\n  see Beard v. S.C. Coastal Council, 304 S.C. 205, 207, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  620, 621 (1991) (\"Like the 1988 Beachfront Management Act, the purpose of the \r\n  1977 Act was to protect, restore and enhance the coastal environment.\"). To \r\n  accomplish this goal, the CZMA created a state agency, the South Carolina Coastal \r\n  Council, to administer and enforce its provisions. (2) \r\n  Id. The Council's regulatory authority, however, was inadequate to forestall \r\n  extensive private beachfront development along the coast and, as a result, erosion \r\n  became a serious threat. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-250(4) (Supp. 2000); \r\n  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(1) &amp; (2).  \r\n\r\nRealizing the gravity of the problem, the Legislature \r\n  enacted the Beachfront Management Act in 1988. (3) \r\n  Promulgated to further the coastal protection afforded under the CZMA, the Act \r\n  was a direct response to a report by the Blue Ribbon Committee on Beachfront \r\n  Management that determined South Carolina's beach/dune system was in crisis. \r\n  (4) See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(3). Specifically, \r\n  the report noted that \"over fifty-seven miles of our beaches [were] critically \r\n  eroding,\" thereby threatening \"life, property, the tourist industry, vital State \r\n  and local revenue, marine habitat, and a national treasure[.]\" Id.  \r\n\r\n\r\nTo combat the erosional threat, the Beachfront \r\n  Management Act devised a statutory scheme to restore the beach/dune system by \r\n  promoting gradual retreat from the beachfront over a forty-year period. See \r\n  Â§ 48-39-280; 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(6). To this end, the legislation \r\n  directed DHEC to \"develop and institute a comprehensive beach erosion control \r\n  policy,\" and prohibited the use of any \"critical area,\" including the beach, \r\n  without first obtaining a permit from DHEC. Â§ 48-39-120(A) &amp; 130(A). \r\n  (5)  \r\n\r\nIn general, three methods are used to manage the \r\n  problem of shoreline erosion: armoring the beach with \"hard\" erosion control \r\n  devices; renourishing the beach with sand; and retreating from the beach altogether. \r\n  (6) 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(5). Enactment of the Beachfront \r\n  Management Act evidences a clear legislative choice favoring the latter two \r\n  policies. See, e.g., Â§ 48-39-290(B)(2) (governing all construction, reconstruction \r\n  and alterations between the baseline (7) and \r\n  the setback line, (8) thereby prohibiting the \r\n  construction of new erosion control devices seaward of the setback line except \r\n  for the protection of a pre-existing public highway and strictly regulating \r\n  the repair or replacement of such devices if destroyed); Â§ 48-39-250(5) (\"The \r\n  use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices such as seawalls, \r\n  bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatened structures adjacent to \r\n  the beach has not proved effective. . . . In reality, these hard structures, \r\n  in many instances, have increased the vulnerability of beachfront property to \r\n  damage from wind and waves while contributing to the deterioration and loss \r\n  of the dry sand beach which is so important to the tourism industry.\"); Â§ 48-39-260(3) \r\n  (stating that the policy of South Carolina is to \"severely restrict the use \r\n  of hard erosion control devices to armor the beach/dune system and to encourage \r\n  the replacement of hard erosion control devices with soft technologies as approved \r\n  by [DHEC] which will provide for the protection of the shoreline without long-term \r\n  adverse effects\"). (9) \r\n\r\nReflecting this preference, the Beachfront Management Act expressly states that \"[n]o new\r\nconstruction or reconstruction is allowed seaward of the baseline,\" as determined by DHEC,\r\nexcept the following:  \r\n\r\n\r\n(1) wooden walkways no larger in width than six feet\r\n(2)  small wooden decks no larger than one hundred forty-four square feet\r\n(3) fishing piers which are open to the public . . .\r\n(4) golf courses\r\n(5) normal landscaping\r\n(6) structures specifically permitted by special permit as provided in   subsection (D)\r\n(7) pools may be reconstructed if they are landward of an existing,   functional erosion control\r\nstructure or device . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 48-39-290(A). (10) \r\n  We agree with SCCCL and Sierra Club that this section precludes OCRM from issuing \r\n  any permits for the construction or refurbishment of groins, which \r\n  clearly are constructed seaward of the baseline and do not fit within a statutory \r\n  exception. (11) \r\n\r\nAlthough Respondents acknowledge, as did the circuit \r\n  court and ALJD, that this conclusion stems from a \"literal reading\" of section \r\n  48-39-290(A), (12) they argue the section should \r\n  not be interpreted in isolation from other provisions of the Beachfront Management \r\n  Act. (13) We agree. See, e.g., Williams \r\n  v. Williams, 335 S.C. 386, 389-90, 517 S.E.2d 689, 690-91 (1999) (\"[T]his \r\n  Court's primary function is to ascertain the intention of the legislature. . \r\n  . . The Court should consider not merely the language . . . being construed, \r\n  but the word[s] and [their] meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole \r\n  statute and the policy of the law.\"); Gardner v. Biggart, 308 S.C. 331, \r\n  333, 417 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1992) (\"A statutory provision should be given a reasonable \r\n  and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed \r\n  in the statute.\") (quoting Hay v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 273 S.C. 269, 273, \r\n  255 S.E.2d 837, 840 (1979)); Burns v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., \r\n  297 S.C. 520, 522, 377 S.E.2d 569, 570 (1989) (\"In ascertaining [legislative] \r\n  intent, statutes which are part of the same Act must be read together.\"). However, \r\n  even construing the Act as a whole, Respondents' arguments are unavailing.\r\n\r\nInitially, we believe Respondents are correct in \r\n  asserting that groins, as defined herein, are not \"erosion control structures \r\n  or devices\" as defined in the Act. On its face, the statutory definition of \r\n  \"erosion control structures or devices\" does not reference groins and enumerates \r\n  only three types: seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments. See Â§ 48-39-270(1). \r\n  However, because the word \"include\" may be seen as one of limitation or enlargement, \r\n  we must turn to rules of construction to ascertain the Legislature's true intent. \r\n  See Baker v. Chavis, 306 S.C. 203, 208-09, 410 S.E.2d 600, 603 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1991) (citing N.C. Turnpike Auth. v. Pine Island, Inc., 265 \r\n  N.C. 109, 143 S.E.2d 319 (1965) (\"includes\" is ordinarily a word of \r\n  enlargement and not of limitation) (emphasis added); Frame v. Nehls, \r\n  550 N.W.2d 739, 742 (Mich. 1996) (stating that \"[w]hen used in the text of a \r\n  statute, the word 'includes' can be used as a term of enlargement or of limitation, \r\n  and the word in and of itself is not determinative of how it is intended to \r\n  be used,\" the court, upon reviewing the entire act containing the statute at \r\n  issue along with its legislative history, construed \"includes\" followed by two \r\n  descriptive provisions to be a term of limitation despite other, more expansive \r\n  uses of the defined term throughout the act); Black's Law Dictionary \r\n  763 (6th ed. 1990) (depending on context \"include\" may express enlargement or \r\n  limitation).\r\n\r\nIn our view, the statutory collocation suggests \r\n  an intent to circumscribe the definitional meaning of \"include\" by stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Erosion control structures or devices include: \r\n    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n     (a) seawall: a special type of retaining wall \r\n      that is designed specifically to withstand normal wave forces;\r\n      (b) bulkhead: a retaining wall designed to retain fill material but not \r\n      to withstand wave forces on an exposed shoreline;\r\n      (c) revetment: a sloping structure built along an escarpment or in front \r\n      of a bulkhead to protect the shoreline or bulkhead from erosion. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 48-39-270(1). In other words, the legislative \r\n  decision to set forth each erosion control structure mentioned in a separate, \r\n  individually-defined format reinforces the inference that lawmakers intended \r\n  \"include\" to limit the definition. The statute, therefore, is interpreted best \r\n  through application of the rule of construction known as &quot;expressio unius \r\n  est exclusio alterius,\" meaning \"to express or include one thing implies the \r\n  exclusion of another, or of the alternative.\" Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. \r\n  79, 86, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000) (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 602 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999)). Applying this rule, we may presume the Legislature meant to \r\n  exclude other structures also designed to deter erosion when they only listed \r\n  seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments in the statute.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion is supported by the fact that the \r\n  three structures designated in the statute, namely seawalls, bulkheads, and \r\n  revetments, parallel the shoreline and function as a barrier to \"armor\" it against \r\n  the elements and retain sand in an effort to inhibit erosion, while groins are \r\n  constructed perpendicular to the shore and operate to impede erosion by controlling \r\n  the natural movement of sand that results from waves hitting the beach at an \r\n  angle. See generally Â§ 48-39-250(5) (\"[A]rmoring in the form of hard \r\n  erosion control devices such as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap to protect \r\n  erosion-threatened structures adjacent to the beach has not proved effective. \r\n  These armoring devices have given a false sense of security to beachfront property \r\n  owners.\"); Â§ 48-39-260(3) (policy of the state is to \"severely restrict the \r\n  use of hard erosion control devices to armor the beach/dune system\"); 23A S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(D)(23) (\"Groins are usually perpendicular to the shore \r\n  and extend from the shoreline into the water far enough to accomplish their \r\n  purpose.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, restricting the statutory meaning of \r\n  erosion control structures to seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments corresponds \r\n  to related provisions in the Act. See Â§ 48-39-280(A)(1) (\"In standard \r\n  erosion zones in which the shoreline as been altered naturally or artificially \r\n  by the construction of erosion control devices, groins, or other manmade \r\n  alterations . . . .\") (emphasis added); Â§ 48-39-290(B)(2) (section governing \r\n  the construction and reconstruction of erosion control devices and which by \r\n  definition applies only to structures situated between the baseline and the \r\n  setback line, thereby excluding anything built on the active beach); Â§ 48-39-290(B)(2)(b)(iv) \r\n  (subsection strictly regulating the repair or replacement of \"erosion control \r\n  structures or devices\" and setting forth specific assessment and measuring instructions \r\n  solely for seawalls, bulkheads, and revetments); Â§ 48-39-250(5) (stating that \r\n  \"[t]he use of armoring in the form of hard erosion control devices such as seawalls, \r\n  bulkheads and rip-rap to protect erosion-threatened structures adjacent \r\n  to the beach has not proven effective.\") (emphasis added). \r\n  (14) \r\n\r\nHaving determined groins are not \"erosion control \r\n  structures or devices\" as contemplated by the Beachfront Management Act, it \r\n  is readily apparent that some statutory sections are not relevant to our analysis. \r\n  For example, section 48-39-290(B)(2), governing construction, reconstruction \r\n  and alteration of erosion control devices, does not apply. Section 48-39-120(B), \r\n  authorizing DHEC to issue permits for erosion control structures, similarly \r\n  is inapplicable. On the other hand, subsection 48-39-290(A)(6)(D) does apply, \r\n  because it concerns permits \"to build or rebuild a structure other than an erosion \r\n  control structure or device.\" However, because it bans all construction on the \r\n  \"active beach,\" the subsection still operates to preclude the development or \r\n  refurbishment of groins. See Â§ 48-39-290(A)(6)(D). \r\n  (15)  \r\n\r\nAlthough Respondents do not rely on section 48-39-120(F) in their brief, both the circuit court\r\nand ALJD construed this section as authorizing DHEC to issue permits for the construction and\r\nreconstruction of new or existing groins.  The section provides:  \r\n\r\n\r\n[DHEC], for and on behalf of the State, may issue permits not otherwise provided by state law, for\r\nerosion and water drainage structure in or upon the tidelands, submerged lands and waters of the\r\nState below the mean high-water mark as it may deem most advantageous to the State for the\r\npurpose of promoting the public health, safety and welfare, the protection of public and private\r\nproperty from beach and shore destruction and the continued use of tidelands, submerged lands\r\nand waters for public purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 48-39-120(F).  The statute does not define \"erosion and water drainage structure.\"  Even\r\nassuming, arguendo, that the term \"erosion and water drainage structure\" could be interpreted to\r\nencompass groins, subsection (F) may not be employed to validate construction expressly\r\nprohibited by the clear language of section 48-39-290(A).\r\n\r\nIn finding the permit issued by DHEC in this case \r\n  valid, the ALJD erroneously interpreted the phrase \"not otherwise provided by \r\n  state law.\" While no South Carolina case has construed this precise language, \r\n  State v. Jenkins, 26 S.C. 121, 1 S.E. 437 (1887), is instructive.\r\n\r\nIn Jenkins, our supreme court held Article \r\n  4 Â§ 18 of the state constitution, granting courts of general sessions exclusive \r\n  jurisdiction in all criminal cases \"which shall not be otherwise provided by \r\n  law,\" governed jurisdiction in cases of petit larcency because no other provision \r\n  of law limited punishment for the crime such that jurisdiction could be had \r\n  by trial justices as specified in Article 1 Â§ 19. (16) \r\n  Jenkins, 26 S.C. at 123, 1 S.E. at 438. In so doing, the court further \r\n  noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If the general assembly had since [the enactment \r\n    of the constitution] limited the punishment of petit larceny as mentioned \r\n    in art. I., section 19, this, under the language of the section, would have \r\n    conferred exclusive jurisdiction upon trial justices, and consequently would \r\n    have ousted the jurisdiction of the General Sessions, as by such [legislative] \r\n    act jurisdiction in such cases would have been \"otherwise provided by law.\" \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 123-24, 1 S.E. at 439. \r\n\r\nBecause we view subsection (F)'s reference to permits \r\n  \"not otherwise provided by state law\" as synonymous with the phrase \"shall not \r\n  be otherwise provided by law\" interpreted in Jenkins, we find the Legislature \r\n  intended to restrict DHEC's authority to issue permits for erosion and water \r\n  drainage structures to those circumstances in which no other provision of state \r\n  law applies. (17) See id.; City \r\n  of New York v. Dist. Council 37, Am. Fed'n of State, County &amp; Mun. Employees, \r\n  AFL-CIO, 692 N.Y.S.2d 593, 598 (1999) (language in city charter stating \r\n  mayoral power exists only to the extent \"not otherwise provided by law\" implies \r\n  that the mayor's powers \"are subject to the constraints, if any, contained in \r\n  the Taylor Law and other state laws\"). Accordingly, since section 48-39-290(A) \r\n  clearly pertains to all beachfront construction and reconstruction \r\n  seaward of the baseline, section 48-39-120(F) cannot serve to ratify the groin \r\n  permit issued to Port Royal Plantation. (18) \r\n   \r\n\r\nThe circuit court's analysis of subsection (F) \r\n  is similarly misplaced. In finding the groin permit valid, the circuit court \r\n  relied in part on DHEC's interpretation of the provision, which would \"allow \r\n  the construction or reconstruction of groins in conjunction with beach nourishment.\" \r\n  While we agree with the circuit court that the construction given a statute \r\n  by the agency charged with its administration is entitled to the utmost consideration \r\n  on appeal such that it will not be overruled absent compelling reasons, see \r\n  Captain's Quarters Motor Inn, Inc. v. S. C. Coastal Council, 306 S.C. \r\n  488, 413 S.E.2d 13 (1991), an agency's construction \"affords no basis for the \r\n  perpetuation of a patently erroneous application of [a] statute.\" Monroe \r\n  v. Livingston, 251 S.C. 214, 217, 161 S.E.2d 243, 244 (1968). Thus, because \r\n  DHEC's interpretation of section 48-39-120(F) conflicts directly with the express \r\n  language of section 48-39-290(A), it cannot serve as a basis for upholding Port \r\n  Royal's permit. See Hodges, 341 S.C. at 88, 533 S.E.2d at 582 \r\n  (\"[T]his Court should not completely disregard the text of an unambiguous statute \r\n  based on an alleged conflict with an earlier statute.\").\r\n\r\nThe circuit court further noted that DHEC has promulgated \r\n  regulations specifically governing groins. See, e.g., 23A S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Regs. at 30-13(N) (setting forth standards for the \"special permits\" required \r\n  of \"[g]roins, jetties and offshore breakwaters,\" because such structures \"interfere \r\n  with the natural transport of sediment\"). (19) \r\n  It is well settled, however, that \"[a]lthough a regulation has the force of \r\n  law, it may not alter or add to a statute.\" Goodman v. City of Columbia, \r\n  318 S.C. 488, 490, 458 S.E.2d 531, 532 (1995); Soc'y of Prof'l Journalists \r\n  v. Sexton, 283 S.C. 563, 567, 324 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1984) (finding DHEC regulation \r\n  that contravened statutory provisions invalid because a regulation \"must fall \r\n  when it alters or adds to a statute\"); compare U.S. Outdoor Adver., \r\n  Inc. v. S. C. Dep't of Transp., 324 S.C. 1, 481 S.E.2d 112 (1997) (upholding \r\n  definition of statutory term provided by agency regulation where the statute \r\n  specifically authorized DOT to enact regulations more limiting than the terms \r\n  of the statute); Glover v. Suitt Constr. Co., 318 S.C. 465, 458 S.E.2d \r\n  535 (1995) (employing agency regulation to aid statutory interpretation where \r\n  both the regulation and statute evinced the same legislative intent). \r\n  \r\n\r\nRespondents urge this Court to uphold Port Royal's \r\n  permit because groins purportedly extend the life of beach renourishment projects, \r\n  a declared goal of the Beachfront Management Act. (20) \r\n  See Â§ 48-39-260(5) (stating policy of South Carolina is to \"promote carefully \r\n  planned nourishment as a means of beach preservation and restoration where economically \r\n  feasible\"). In particular, Respondents claim an absolute ban on all groin construction \r\n  and reconstruction would lead to \"a result so absurd that it could not have \r\n  been intended\" by the Legislature, because groins are essential to the preservation \r\n  of newly deposited beach sand. We need not decide whether groins in fact enhance \r\n  such projects, a determination inappropriate for summary judgment, because, \r\n  in the absence of ambiguity or contrary statutory provisions, the plain language \r\n  of section 48-39-290 must control. See Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, \r\n  533 S.E.2d at 581 (\"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered \r\n  the best evidence of the legislative intent or will.\") (quoting Norman J. Singer, \r\n  Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§ 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992)); City \r\n  of Columbia v. ACLU of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749 \r\n  (1996) (\"Where the terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those \r\n  terms according to their literal meaning.\"). \r\n\r\nFinally, Respondents argue the Court is required \r\n  to read the 1999 South Carolina Beach Restoration and Improvement Trust Act, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-40-10 to - 70 (Supp. 2000), in conjunction with the Beachfront \r\n  Management Act to glean the Legislature's true intent regarding the construction \r\n  or reconstruction of groins. We disagree. \r\n\r\nIn making this argument, Respondents rely on language \r\n  found in section 48-40-20, specifically a definition of renourishment which \r\n  reads in part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \"Beach renourishment\" means the artificial establishment \r\n    and periodic renourishment of a beach with sand . . . as described in Section \r\n    48-39-270, to include where considered appropriate and necessary by [OCRM], \r\n    groin construction and maintenance to extend the life of such projects. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\nÂ§ 48-40-20(3) (emphasis added). Although we agree \r\n  this provision is indicative of some purposeful consideration of groins, this \r\n  Court may not disregard the otherwise clear intent of the Legislature. \r\n\r\nThe General Assembly enacted the Beach Restoration \r\n  and Improvement Trust Act for the express purpose of establishing a \"trust\" \r\n  to provide matching funds to qualifying local governments for beach restoration \r\n  projects. See Â§ 48-40-30(1). In so doing, the Legislature chose not to \r\n  amend the Beachfront Management Act, but rather to create the fund in a separate \r\n  chapter of Title 48. Indeed, the definition of beach renourishment therein is \r\n  prefaced by the unambiguous phrase \"[a]s used in this chapter.\" Â§ 48-40-20 \r\n  (emphasis added). In our view, these decisions evince a legislative intent to \r\n  leave the mandatory provisions of the Beachfront Management Act intact. \r\n\r\nMoreover, under our general rules of statutory \r\n  construction, the Beach Restoration and Improvement Trust Act, a general statute, \r\n  cannot supersede the more specific Beachfront Management Act. See Wooten \r\n  ex rel. Wooten v. S. C. Dep't of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d \r\n  355, 357 (1999) (\"A specific statutory provision prevails over a more general \r\n  one.\"); Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Nat'l Vendors Div. of \r\n  Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995) (\"The general \r\n  rule of statutory construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more \r\n  general one.\"). \r\n\r\nIn the final analysis, we believe our construction \r\n  of section 48-39-290 fully comports with the purpose and policy of the Beachfront \r\n  Management Act. See, e.g., S.C. Coastal Mgmt. Program Document \r\n  IV-53 to IV-54 (1977, 1979) (pursuant to section 48-39-90(D), the \"final management \r\n  plan for the State's coastal zone,\" states that the \"trapping of sand by a groin \r\n  can have severe impacts on the adjacent shoreline down the beach\") \r\n  (emphasis added); Â§ 48-39-250(6) (\"Erosion is a natural process which becomes \r\n  a significant problem for man only when structures are erected in close proximity \r\n  to the beach/dune system. It is in both the public and private interests \r\n  to afford the beach/dune system space to accrete and erode in its natural cycle. \r\n   This space can be provided only by discouraging new construction in close \r\n  proximity to the beach/dune system and encouraging those who have erected structures \r\n  too close to the system to retreat from it.\") (emphasis added); Â§ 48-39-260(3) \r\n  (the policy of South Carolina is to \"severely restrict the use of hard erosion \r\n  control devices to armor the beach/dune system and to encourage the replacement \r\n  of hard erosion control devices with soft technologies \r\n  (21) as approved by [DHEC] which will provide for the protection of \r\n  the shoreline without long-term adverse effects\") (emphasis added); Â§ 48-39-260(4) \r\n  (the policy of our state is to \"encourage the use of erosion-inhibiting \r\n  techniques which do not adversely impact the long-term well-being of the beach/dune \r\n  system\") (emphasis added); 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-11(D)(5) (&quot;[DHEC] \r\n  shall be guided by the prohibitions against construction contained in Section \r\n  48-39-290 and Section 48-39-300 . . . . These structures interfere with \r\n  the natural system and impact the highest and best uses of the system. \r\n  . . .\") (emphasis added). \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBecause we hold as a matter of law that the Beachfront \r\n  Management Act prohibits DHEC from issuing permits for the construction or reconstruction \r\n  of new or existing groins, the grant of summary judgment to Respondents is reversed \r\n  and the case remanded to the circuit court for entry of an order granting summary \r\n  judgment to SCCCL and Sierra Club. \r\n\r\n\r\n  REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n\r\n  HEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.  \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  A groin is a structure built \r\n  on the beach, often of large rocks or timber, running perpendicular to the shore \r\n  and extending into the ocean. It is designed to retard erosion by trapping littoral \r\n  drift, i.e., the shifting sand along the shore that results from wave action. \r\n  See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 30-1(D)(23) (Supp. 2000). A \"groin field\" \r\n  is a series of two or more groins in close proximity which exert overlapping \r\n  areas of influence. Id. \r\n2.  A 1993 amendment to the \r\n  CZMA merged the South Carolina Coastal Council with DHEC, creating the OCRM \r\n  and Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel. See Â§ 48-39-40; 23A S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(A)(1). \r\n3.  In 1990 the Legislature \r\n  amended the Act in response to litigation and the aftermath of Hurricane Hugo. \r\n  See generally Newman Jackson Smith, Analysis of the Regulation of \r\n  Beachfront Development in South Carolina, 42 S.C. L. Rev. 717 (1991). \r\n4.    \r\n  The beach/dune system is defined as \"all land from the mean high-water mark \r\n  of the Atlantic Ocean landward to the 40 year setback line described in Â§ 48-39-280.\" \r\n  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(D)(5). \r\n5.   \"Critical \r\n  areas\" are defined as any of the following: (1) coastal waters, (2) tidelands, \r\n  (3) beach/dune systems, and (4) beaches. 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(D)(13). \r\n 6.   \r\n  \"Beach nourishment\" is defined as \"the artificial establishment and periodic \r\n  renourishment of a beach with sand that is compatible with the existing beach \r\n  in a way so as to create a dry sand beach at all stages of the tide.\" Â§ 48-39-270(4); \r\n  see also 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(D)(19)(d). \r\n7.   The \r\n  baseline of a standard [non-inlet] erosion zone generally is fixed at the crest \r\n  of the primary oceanfront sand dune. Where alterations have occurred, either \r\n  natural or man-made, DHEC must establish the baseline using the best scientific \r\n  and historical data available indicating where the crest would have been located \r\n  had the shoreline not been altered. See Â§ 48-39-280(A)(1). \r\n8.   The \r\n  setback line is established by DHEC landward of the baseline at a distance forty \r\n  times the average annual erosion rate or not less than twenty feet. See \r\n  Â§ 48-39-280(B). \r\n9.   DHEC \r\n  regulations explicitly embrace this patent expression of legislative intent. \r\n  See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(2) (\"[H]ard erosion control devices \r\n  can result in increased erosion, a lowering of the beach profile . . . and a \r\n  decrease in the ability of the beach/dune system to protect upland property \r\n  from storms and high tides. Often the result of attempting to protect upland \r\n  property with hard erosion control structures is that dry sand beaches disappear, \r\n  thereby placing many millions of tourist dollars in jeopardy and destroying \r\n  this natural legacy for future generations.\"); 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(4) \r\n  (\"It has been clearly demonstrated that the erosion problems of this State are \r\n  caused by a persistent rise in sea level, a lack of comprehensive beach management \r\n  planning, and poorly planned oceanfront development, including construction \r\n  of hard erosion control structures, which encroach upon the beach/dune system.\"); \r\n  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-1(C)(6) (The CZMA, as amended, \"rejects construction \r\n  of new erosion control devices and adopts retreat and renourishment as the basic \r\n  state policy towards preserving and restoring the beaches of our state.\"); 23A \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-11(D)(2) (&quot;[DHEC] shall promote soft-solutions \r\n  to erosion within the context of a policy of retreat of development from the \r\n  shore and prevent the strengthening and enlargement of existing erosion control \r\n  structures.\"). \r\n10.  Subsection \r\n  (D) authorizes DHEC to issue \"special permits\" to build or rebuild structures \r\n  other than erosion control structures or devices only if such structures \r\n  are not located on the \"active beach.\" Â§ 48-39-290(D). The active beach is defined \r\n  as \"that area seaward of the escarpment or the first line of stable natural \r\n  vegetation, whichever first occurs, measured from the ocean.\" Â§ 48-39-270(13). \r\n  Groins, therefore, by definition constructed on the active beach, are excluded \r\n  from this statutory exception.  \r\n11.    \r\n  It cannot seriously be debated that the development or refurbishing of groins \r\n  constitutes \"construction\" or \"reconstruction\" as contemplated by section 48-39-290(A). \r\n  See Attachment A to Port Royal Plantation's Permit Application (\"Work \r\n  will consist of the addition of armor rock and bedding stone so as to reconstruct \r\n  more meaningful structure elevations and cross-sections.\"); Joint Pub. Notice \r\n  of the U.S. Army Corps of Eng'rs, Charleston Dist. and the S.C. Dep't of Health \r\n  &amp; Envtl. Control Office of Ocean &amp; Coastal Res. Mgmt. (existing groin \r\n  materials include \"palm tree trunks, concrete rubble and granite stones\"); DHEC \r\n  Critical Area Permit (special condition allows \"only rock material\" to be used \r\n  for \"groin construction\").  \r\n12.   Indeed, \r\n  Respondents admit the plain language of the statute bars the construction of \r\n  groins: \r\n\r\n\r\n  If Â§ 48-39-290(A) and (D) are interpreted literally, \r\n    without reference to other portions of the Act, then it would appear that \r\n    the construction or reconstruction of groins is prohibited. Groins are not \r\n    mentioned in the enumerated exceptions found in Â§ 48-39-290(A) and groins, \r\n    by their nature, are constructed partially on the active beach and in intertidal \r\n    areas, in contradiction to Â§ 48-39-290(D). \r\n\r\n\r\nFinal Brief of Respondents at 11-12.  \r\n13.    \r\n  We note here that because the brief of Amicus Curiae DeBordieu Colony Community \r\n  Association sets forth essentially the same arguments as that of DHEC, Port \r\n  Royal Plantation, and the Town of Hilton Head, we include DeBordieu in our use \r\n  of the term \"Respondents.\" \r\n 14.  We \r\n  realize section 48-39-250(5)'s reference to \"erosion control structures such \r\n  as seawalls, bulkheads, and rip-rap\" could be interpreted to expand \r\n  the definition of erosion control structures beyond those enumerated in section \r\n  48-39-270(1) (emphasis added). The Beachfront Management Act does not define \r\n  the term \"rip-rap.\" However, although \"rip rap\" may be defined solely as \"large \r\n  rocks\" or chunks of stone, see Seyler v. Burlington Northern Santa \r\n  Fe Corp., 102 F.Supp.2d 1226 (D. Kan. 2000), it usually refers to a retaining \r\n  wall made of rip rap material or, alternatively, the use of rip rap material \r\n  to reinforce such a wall. See, e.g., Muir v. Coastal Res. Mgmt. Council, \r\n  WL 345817 at n.1 (R.I. Super. March 21, 2001) (\"A revetment is a structure built \r\n  to armor a sloping shoreline face usually composed of one or more layers o[f] \r\n  stone or concrete riprap. . . . A riprap consists of stone or concrete blocks \r\n  that are dumped or placed and installed without mortar.\"); Steptoe v. True, \r\n  38 S.W.3d 213, 215 (Tex. App. 2001) (discussing a bulkhead made out of \"rip-rap\"); \r\n  Oliver v. Amity Mut. Irrigation Co., 994 P.2d 495, 498 (Colo. Ct. App. \r\n  1999) (defining riprap as \"a foundation or sustaining wall of stones\"); Payne \r\n  v. City of Galveston, 772 S.W.2d 473, 475 (Tex. App. 1989) (\"On the beach \r\n  at the base of the seawall are piles of granite and limestone boulders, called \r\n  'rip-rap,' which stabilize the sand at the base of the wall from erosion.\"); \r\n  State v. Putman, 552 A.2d 1247, 1248 (Del. Super. Ct. 1988) (defining \r\n  revetment as \"rip-rapping\"); Barrie v. Cal. Coastal Comm'n, 241 Cal. \r\n  Rptr. 477, 485 (Ct. App. 1987) (discussing \"riprap\" located at the base of a \r\n  seawall); Webster's New World College Dictionary 1237 (4th ed. 1999) \r\n  (citing primary definition of rip rap as \"a foundation or wall made of large \r\n  chunks of stone thrown together irregularly or loosely\"). The use of \"rip-rap\" \r\n  in section 48-39-250(5), therefore, is consistent with the limited definition \r\n  of erosion control structures or devices contained in section 48-39-270(1). \r\n15.   Respondents \r\n  are correct in asserting the Legislature purposely enacted the special permit \r\n  provision contained in exception (6) of section 48-39-290(A) to prevent unconstitutional \r\n  takings of the type ultimately struck down in Lucas v. S. C. Coastal Council, \r\n  505 U.S. 1003 (1992). Section 48-39-290 was enacted as part of the 1990 amendments \r\n  to the Beachfront Management Act, originally enacted in 1988. According to Respondents, \r\n  therefore, the plain language of the section should not control because it \"is \r\n  inconsistent with the historical basis for the 1990 amendments.\" To the contrary, \r\n  we believe section 48-39-290's blanket prohibition on any construction on the \r\n  active beach fully accords with Lucas, as the active beach, by definition, \r\n  is not subject to claims of private ownership. \r\n16.   This \r\n  constitutional provision vested jurisdiction in trial justices, i.e., justices \r\n  of the peace or \"other officers authorized by law,\" for all non-felony offenses \r\n  where the punishment did not exceed a $100 fine or thirty days imprisonment. \r\n  See S.C. Const. 1868 art. I, Â§ 19.  \r\n17.   \"Not \r\n  otherwise provided by law\" has been held analogous to \"unless otherwise provided \r\n  by law,\" Arends v. Iowa Select Farms, L.P., 556 N.W.2d 812, 815 (Iowa \r\n  1996), and &quot;except as otherwise provided by law,\" Matthews v. Purcell \r\n  Seed &amp; Grain Co., 867 P.2d 1359, 1360 (Okla. Ct. App. 1993). \r\n18.   Of \r\n  course, had the Legislature desired to override the express prohibition of section \r\n  48-39-290(A), it could have amended subsection (F) and authorized DHEC to issue \r\n  permits, notwithstanding any other provision of state law, for erosion \r\n  and water drainage structures, see Mosteller v. County of Lexington, \r\n  336 S.C. 360, 364, 520 S.E.2d 620, 622 (1999) (finding the Legislature's use \r\n  of the phrase \"[n]otwithstanding any other provision of law\" in a statute indicates \r\n  a clear intention to exclude other provisions of law so that the section employing \r\n  such language trumps the requirements of other applicable sections), or, alternatively, \r\n  included an exception in section 48-39-290 for groins and similar structures. \r\n  See Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 53, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993) \r\n  (\"A basic presumption exists that the legislature has knowledge of previous \r\n  legislation when later statutes are passed on a related subject.\"). \r\n19.   \r\n  Interestingly, DHEC regulation 30-13(N) directly conflicts with other, more \r\n  specific agency regulations. See 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-11(D)(4) \r\n  (\"No permit shall be issued which is inconsistent with the state [coastal management] \r\n  plan . . . .\"); 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. at 30-11(D)(5) (&quot;[DHEC] shall \r\n  be guided by the prohibitions against construction contained in Section 48-39-290 \r\n  and Section 48-39-300 . . . .\").  \r\n20.   Respondents \r\n  also claim that read literally, section 48-39-290(A) would proscribe renourishment \r\n  altogether, because the process of artificially nourishing the beach with sand \r\n  is a \"construction\" project that utilizes heavy equipment like trucks and backhoes. \r\n  This argument is meritless. See Black's Law Dictionary 308, 1278 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999) (defining \"construction\" as \"[t]he act of building\" \r\n  or \"the thing so built\"; also defining \"reconstruction\" as \"[t]he act \r\n  or process of rebuilding\") (emphasis added); Webster's New World \r\n  College Dictionary 192 (4th ed. 1999) (defining parallel meaning of \"build\" \r\n  as \"to make by putting together materials, parts, etc.\"). Obviously, since the \r\n  placing of sand on the open beach can in no way be described as \"building\" or \r\n  \"rebuilding,\" section 48-39-290(A) has no effect on clearly permitted nourishment \r\n  projects. \r\n21.   \"Soft\" \r\n  solutions or technologies, as defined by DHEC, consist of beach nourishment \r\n  and sand scraping. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3359","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn the early morning hours of June 10, 1998, Lawrence \r\n  Brockman, an employee of the Fast Stop convenience store, was taking gas pump \r\n  readings when he was approached by a man inquiring what time the store would \r\n  close. After Brockman explained that he was in the process of closing the store, \r\n  the man turned and walked away. Brockman later described him as a black male \r\n  approximately five feet, nine inches tall.\r\n\r\nBrockman then re-entered the store and went back \r\n  behind the counter to the register. As Brockman looked up, \r\n  he saw a man at the front door wearing a mask or goggles and waving a gun. The \r\n  man did not enter the store, nor did he point the gun at anyone inside the store. \r\n  Rather, Brockman testified he stopped at the door for approximately two seconds, \r\n  then turned and fled. In his description to the police, Brockman \r\n  stated only that the perpetrator was a black male.\r\n\r\nAnnie Sarratt, Brockman's common law wife, also \r\n  witnessed the incident. She testified that before Brockman left the store to \r\n  check on the gas pumps, she was suspicious of someone in dark clothing loitering \r\n  in front of the store. When Brockman returned, she asked what had taken so long. \r\n  Brockman responded that he was attempting to determine who was ducking around \r\n  the corner of the building. Sarratt then testified:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I saw Mr. Brockman duck down and I didn't know \r\n    what was going on. But I looked around. Somebody was in the door, two, two \r\n    men. One man with dark clothing and I forgot what the other man had on. But \r\n    [he] was waving something. So I ran to the poker machine and I ducked down \r\n    and then they left. . . . They didn't come on in the store. But they had the \r\n    door open and one guy [was] doing something like this [and] saying something. \r\n    And the guy in the black ran. The other guy was still standing there and I \r\n    said what was he saying. . . . [H]e wouldn't answer. He left.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarratt testified both perpetrators were black \r\n  males, one of whom wore a hooded piece of clothing and waved something. She \r\n  also identified one of the perpetrators as the man who had spoken to Brockman \r\n  outside the store. On cross-examination, Brockman testified the man he spoke \r\n  to was not the defendant, Terry Nesbitt, whom he knew.\r\n\r\nOfficer James Powell was the first officer to respond \r\n  to the reported armed robbery. En route to the scene, Powell observed a black \r\n  male fitting the description of the suspect and a white male walking side-by-side \r\n  down railroad tracks near the store. The black male was the defendant, Terry \r\n  Nesbitt. Powell testified that although he could not identify the object, Nesbitt \r\n  had something black in his right hand. As Powell swung his patrol car around, \r\n  Nesbitt fled down the tracks and into the woods. Shortly thereafter, a K-9 officer \r\n  and his dog tracked Nesbitt and discovered him lying in the woods. Upon discovery, \r\n  Nesbitt stated, \"I threw it down.\"\r\n\r\nThe officers handcuffed Nesbitt and placed him \r\n  in a patrol car. A search of the area along the route Nesbitt had been chased \r\n  produced a black nylon stocking cap and a pair of goggles. While sitting in \r\n  the patrol car, Nesbitt waived his Miranda rights and gave the following \r\n  statement:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Me and Michael and two other guys, black males, \r\n    were sitting beside the store. . . . Michael said we would do the store. We \r\n    smoked two rocks and I stayed at the back of the store. Michael had the gun. \r\n    It looked like a .32 auto. I was going down Druid Street when they went in \r\n    the store. Michael is a white male about six foot, twenty-six to twenty-seven \r\n    years old, dark colored clothes, lives on Oak Dale Court. Michael changed \r\n    clothes at the end of Druid Street and gave me the gun. The other two black \r\n    males, I, I don't know their names. One lives at the boarding house on Druid \r\n    Street. The other one I don't know anything about him. They are in their thirties. \r\n    They always hanging around the store bumming for quarters. Me and Michael \r\n    were walking down Henry Street. He was going home and I was too. Michael gave \r\n    me the gun as he took a piss in the street. Then the police came up and I \r\n    ran.\r\n\r\n\r\nNesbitt was subsequently charged with attempted \r\n  armed robbery. At trial, he moved for a directed verdict based on the insufficiency \r\n  of the evidence. The trial court denied the motion. Nesbitt was convicted and \r\n  sentenced to ten years imprisonment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed \r\n  verdict in a criminal case, the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the State. State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997); \r\n  State v. Green, 327 S.C. 581, 491 S.E.2d 263 (Ct. App. 1997). \"[I]f there \r\n  is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably \r\n  tending to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that \r\n  the case was properly submitted to the jury.\" State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. \r\n  50, 62, 502 S.E.2d 63, 69 (1998); Huggins, 325 S.C. at 110, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  at 118. This Court is concerned with the existence or non-existence of evidence, \r\n  not its weight. Id.; Green, 327 S.C. at 586, 491 S.E.2d at 265. \r\n  Accordingly, the trial judge should grant the motion for directed verdict in \r\n  those cases where the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the defendant \r\n  is guilty. Green, 327 S.C. at 587, 491 S.E.2d 265.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nNesbitt argues the trial court erred in failing \r\n  to grant a directed verdict because the State failed to offer sufficient evidence \r\n  to prove that an attempted armed robbery occurred or that Nesbitt took part \r\n  in it. We disagree.\r\n\r\nAttempt crimes are generally ones of specific intent \r\n  such that the act constituting the attempt must be done with the intent to commit \r\n  that particular crime. State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 532 S.E.2d 283 \r\n  (2000). \"In the context of an 'attempt' crime, specific intent means that the \r\n  defendant consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate \r\n  offense. In other words, the completion of such acts is the defendant's purpose.\" \r\n  Id. at 397, 532 S.E.2d at 285 (citing United States v. Calloway, \r\n  116 F.3d 1129 (6th Cir. 1997)). Additionally, the State must prove that the \r\n  defendant's specific intent was accompanied by some overt act, beyond mere preparation, \r\n  in furtherance of the intent, and there must be an actual or present ability \r\n  to complete the crime. State v. Evans, 216 S.C. 328, 57 S.E.2d 756 (1950); \r\n  State v. Quick, 199 S.C. 256, 19 S.E.2d 101 (1942). \"The preparation \r\n  consists in devising or arranging the means or measures necessary for the commission \r\n  of the crime; the attempt or overt act is the direct movement toward the commission, \r\n  after the preparations are made.\" Quick, 199 S.C. at 260, 19 S.E.2d at \r\n  103.\r\n\r\nIn Quick, our supreme court stated the following \r\n  in determining whether a particular defendant's conduct constitutes an overt \r\n  act:\r\n\r\n\r\n  It is well settled that the \"act\" is to be liberally \r\n    construed, and in numerous cases it is said to be sufficient that the act \r\n    go far enough toward accomplishment of the crime to amount to the commencement \r\n    of its consummation. While the efficiency of a particular act depends on the \r\n    facts of the particular case, the act must always amount to more than mere \r\n    preparation, and move directly toward the commission of the crime. In any \r\n    event, it would seem, the act need not be the last proximate step leading \r\n    to the consummation of the offense.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 259, 19 S.E.2d at 102. \r\n\r\nNesbitt's statement referring to the perpetrators' \r\n  agreement to \"do the store\" constitutes direct evidence that the specific intent \r\n  to rob the store existed. Therefore, the determinative issue before this Court \r\n  is whether the perpetrators' conduct as presented by the State was a sufficient \r\n  overt act to sustain a conviction for attempted armed robbery.\r\n\r\nAlthough we are unaware of any South Carolina cases \r\n  factually analogous to the situation presented here, other jurisdictions have \r\n  addressed similar scenarios. In State v. Ward, three men drove to a motel \r\n  with the intention of robbing it and its owner. 601 S.W.2d 629 (Mo. Ct. App. \r\n  1980). One of the men waited in the getaway car as the other two approached \r\n  the motel entrance, armed and masked. The hotel manager testified he was inside \r\n  the motel lobby when he heard a rattling at the outside door and saw the defendant, \r\n  Ward, pointing a gun at him. As the manager ran from the lobby, he shouted \"don't\" \r\n  and \"take the money.\" Id. at 630. When he returned with a shotgun, the \r\n  getaway car was leaving the scene. Although the defendant never entered the \r\n  store, he admitted he was at the scene but left because he \"changed [his] mind.\" \r\n  Id. Ward was later convicted of attempted armed robbery.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Ward argued his actions constituted \r\n  mere preparation to rob the store. The Missouri Court of Appeals disagreed and \r\n  affirmed Ward's conviction, stating:\r\n\r\n\r\n  An overt criminal act is one going beyond mere \r\n    preparation and done after and in furtherance of a prior plan to commit a \r\n    crime. We agree with the trial court's conclusion that overt acts were shown \r\n    by \"defendant's act of going up to the door of the motel office, masked, with \r\n    shotgun in hand, and a getaway car waiting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nId. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nIn Young v. State, police set up a surveillance \r\n  of local banks in an area that had experienced a number of recent robberies. \r\n  493 A.2d 352 (Md. 1985). Early one afternoon, the police observed Young driving \r\n  an automobile in a manner that led them to believe that he was casing the banks. \r\n  Later that afternoon, Young left his vehicle and proceeded toward the front \r\n  door of one of the banks. He added a stocking cap, white gloves, and an eyepatch \r\n  to his attire. A bank manager observed Young approaching the door. Young's jacket \r\n  collar was turned up, his right hand was in his jacket pocket, and his left \r\n  hand was in front of his face. Unaware that the bank had closed for the day, \r\n  Young was surprised to discover that the door was locked. He then fled, running \r\n  past the windows while covering his face.\r\n\r\nPolice stopped Young as he attempted to drive away \r\n  and ordered him to exit the vehicle. As he stepped out, the butt of a .22 caliber \r\n  pistol was sticking out of his right jacket pocket. A pair of white surgical \r\n  gloves, a black eyepatch, a blue knit stocking cap, and a pair of sunglasses \r\n  were located on the front seat.\r\n\r\nIn affirming Young's conviction for attempted armed \r\n  robbery, the court noted that \"the determination of the overt act which is beyond \r\n  mere preparation in furtherance of the commission of the intended crime is a \r\n  most significant aspect of criminal attempts.\" Id. at 357. The court \r\n  went on to hold that Young's conduct leading to his apprehension established \r\n  the necessary overt act toward the commission of armed robbery. The court stated: \r\n  \"Even if we assume that all of Young's conduct before he approached the door \r\n  . . . was mere preparation, . . . when Young tried to open the bank door . . \r\n  . that act constituted a 'substantial step' toward the commission of the intended \r\n  crime.\" Id. at 360. (1)\r\n\r\nIn State v. Parker, the defendant, Parker, \r\n  armed with a gun, was lying beside a hedge across the street from a market store. \r\n  311 S.E.2d 327 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984). He then crossed the street and got on a \r\n  bicycle, which he rode a short distance before returning to the area near the \r\n  hedge. Shortly thereafter, a police officer responding to a complaint from a \r\n  suspicious employee arrived at the scene. Parker quickly walked away and was \r\n  arrested while attempting to reach his bicycle.\r\n\r\nIn reversing Parker's conviction for attempted \r\n  armed robbery, the court found that Parker's actions amounted to no more than \r\n  mere preparation. The court stated: \"Although lurking outside a place of business \r\n  with a loaded pistol may be unlawful conduct, it does not constitute the sort \r\n  of overt act which would clearly show that defendant attempted to rob that business.\" \r\n  Id. at 329.\r\n\r\nWe believe the facts presented in the instant case \r\n  more closely resemble those addressed in Ward and Young than in \r\n  Parker. In Parker, the defendant never made any advance toward \r\n  his intended target. In this case, as in Ward and Young, the perpetrators \r\n  approached the entrances of the buildings while armed and disguised and committed \r\n  an overt act in attempting to gain entrance.\r\n\r\nAccording to Brockman, a black male masking his \r\n  appearance approached the entrance of the store brandishing a weapon. Sarratt \r\n  testified that one of two perpetrators opened the door and said something before \r\n  fleeing the scene. We find that these actions move directly toward the commission \r\n  of an armed robbery. While the conduct may not have been the last proximate \r\n  step toward the commission of the offense, the acts committed went beyond mere \r\n  preparation. In our view, these acts are sufficient to meet the overt act requirement \r\n  espoused in Quick. It should not be necessary to subject victims to a \r\n  face-to-face confrontation with a lethal weapon in order to find the essential \r\n  element of an overt act. From the sum of all evidence presented, the jury could \r\n  infer that an armed robbery was immediately forthcoming, or that the attempt \r\n  had begun.\r\n\r\nNesbitt also argues, however, that even if the \r\n  State presented sufficient evidence to establish that an attempted armed robbery \r\n  occurred, it failed to establish that he took part in it. We disagree.\r\n\r\n Although the State relied exclusively on circumstantial \r\n  evidence to establish Nesbitt's participation, a trial judge is nevertheless \r\n  required to submit the case to the jury if there is \"any substantial evidence \r\n  which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused, or from which his \r\n  guilt may be fairly and logically deduced.\" See State v. Lollis, \r\n  343 S.C. 580, 584, 541 S.E.2d 254, 256 (2001) (quoting State v. Mitchell, \r\n  341 S.C. 406, 409, 535 S.E.2d 126, 127 (2000)) (emphasis added); see also \r\n  State v. Stokes, 299 S.C. 483, 386 S.E.2d 241 (1989); State v. Edwards, \r\n  298 S.C. 272, 379 S.E.2d 888 (1989); State v. Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, \r\n  89 S.E.2d 924 (1955).\r\n\r\nClearly, the trial judge should grant a directed \r\n  verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the defendant \r\n  is guilty. State v. Martin, 340 S.C. 597, 533 S.E.2d 572 (2000) (citing \r\n  State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978)). It is equally clear, \r\n  however, that this Court must view the evidence in a light most favorable to \r\n  the State. State v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999).\r\n\r\nSarratt testified the two perpetrators that approached \r\n  the store were black males, one of whom was wearing a hooded piece of clothing. \r\n  Brockman testified one of the men was wearing a mask or goggles and was armed \r\n  with a gun. Nesbitt admitted he was present when the discussion to \"do the store\" \r\n  occurred and at one point had possession of the gun. Officer Powell arrived \r\n  at the scene shortly after the attempted robbery and observed Nesbitt in the \r\n  vicinity of the store carrying a black object. When Powell approached Nesbitt, \r\n  he fled into the woods. After his apprehension, Nesbitt stated, \"I threw it \r\n  down.\" The police later found a stocking cap and goggles along the route Nesbitt \r\n  had been chased.\r\n\r\nViewing this evidence as we must, in a light most \r\n  favorable to the State, we find there is substantial circumstantial evidence \r\n  from which Nesbitt's participation in the attempted armed robbery could fairly \r\n  and logically be deduced. The trial judge was, therefore, required to submit \r\n  the case to the jury.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  trial court is \r\n\r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED. \r\n\r\n   HEARN, C.J. and CURETON, J., concur. \r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n 1.  In determining the existence \r\n  of an overt act which is beyond mere preparation, the Maryland Court of Appeals \r\n  adopted the \"substantial step\" approach, which posits that a person is guilty \r\n  of an attempt to commit a crime where he purposely does or omits to do anything \r\n  which constitutes a substantial step in a course of conduct planned to culminate \r\n  in his commission of the crime.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn November 1998, Beaufort Realty Company, Inc. \r\n  (Beaufort Realty) submitted a plat subdividing Bay Point Island to the Administrator, \r\n  who exempted the plat from approval under the Beaufort County Development Standards \r\n  Ordinance (Ordinance) because all the lots shown were five acres or more in \r\n  size and no new access was required. In December 1998, a similar plat for Rose \r\n  Island was presented to the Administrator, who likewise stamped that plat exempt. \r\n  The League, a non-profit conservation advocacy group, challenged these decisions \r\n  and requested the matters be consolidated for hearing.\r\n\r\nThe Board held a hearing on both of these matters \r\n  and issued an order overturning the Administrator's determinations that the \r\n  plats were exempt from the Ordinance. Beaufort Realty appealed \r\n  the decision of the Board to the circuit court.\r\n\r\nIn March 1999, Beaufort Realty altered and resubmitted \r\n  the plats. Again, after consulting with the county's development review team, \r\n  the Administrator exempted the plats for each island. (1) \r\n  The League challenged the exemptions to the Board. Following a hearing, the \r\n  Board again overturned the Administrator's decision. Beaufort Realty appealed \r\n  this decision to the circuit court.\r\n\r\nThese matters were consolidated for hearing.  The circuit court reversed the Board on all four\r\nappeals, finding the League lacked standing to appeal the Administrator's decisions to the Board,\r\nand therefore, the Board was without legal authority to overturn the Administrator.  This appeal\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe League argues the circuit court erred in finding the League lacked standing to appeal the\r\nAdministrator's decisions to the Board.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"An organization has standing only if it alleges \r\n  that it or its members will suffer an individualized injury; a mere interest \r\n  in a problem is not enough.\" Carolina Alliance for Fair Employment v. S.C. \r\n  Dep't of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 337 S.C. 476, 487, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  795, 800 (Ct. App. 1999) (citing Sierra Club v. Morton, 405 U.S. 727 \r\n  (1972)). The United States Supreme Court has established the following requirements \r\n  to show standing: (1) the plaintiff must suffer an \"injury in fact\" that is \r\n  (a) concrete and particularized and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural \r\n  or hypothetical; (2) the injury is fairly traceable to the challenged action \r\n  of the defendant; and (3) it is likely, as opposed to merely speculative, that \r\n  the injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Lujan v. Defenders \r\n  of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). The Lujan Court also held \r\n  that it is \"substantially more difficult\" to establish standing where a challenge \r\n  to the government action is brought by one who is not the object of the action, \r\n  but rather seeks to challenge government action or inaction because of alleged \r\n  illegality. Id. An organization has standing to bring suit on behalf \r\n  of its members when its members would otherwise have standing to sue in their \r\n  own right, the interests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose, \r\n  and neither the claim asserted nor the relief requested requires the participation \r\n  of individual members in the lawsuit. Hunt v. Washington State Apple Adver. \r\n  Comm'n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Rule 201, SCACR, provides that \"[o]nly \r\n  a party aggrieved by an order, judgment, or sentence may appeal.\" A party is \r\n  aggrieved by a judgment or decree when it operates on his or her rights of property \r\n  or bears directly on his or her interest. Cisson v. McWhorter, 255 S.C. \r\n  174, 178, 177 S.E.2d 603, 605 (1970); Bivens v. Knight, 254 S.C. 10, \r\n  13, 173 S.E.2d 150, 152 (1970). The word \"aggrieved\" refers to a substantial \r\n  grievance, a denial of some personal or property right, or the imposition on \r\n  a party of a burden or obligation. Id. A party cannot appeal from a decision \r\n  which does not affect his or her interest, however erroneous and prejudicial \r\n  it may be to some other person's rights and interests.\r\n\r\nThe League has not alleged that it or its members \r\n  have suffered or will suffer an individualized injury as the result of the filing \r\n  of the subdivision plats. Although the League alleges its members will suffer \r\n  injury if the islands are developed, the injury is purely conjectural and hypothetical. \r\n  There is no evidence in the record that either the League or its members have \r\n  suffered any actual injury by the filing of the subdivision plats.\r\n\r\nThe League relies on Friends of the Earth v. \r\n  Laidlaw Environmental Services, 528 U.S. 167 (2000). In Laidlaw, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court held certain environmental groups had standing \r\n  to bring suit pursuant to the Clean Water Act against Laidlaw, a wastewater \r\n  treatment facility. When Laidlaw discharged excessive pollutants into a river, \r\n  Friends of the Earth (Friends) and other environmental groups filed an action \r\n  seeking declaratory and injunctive relief, civil penalties, costs, and attorney \r\n  fees. The Court found Friends demonstrated sufficient injury to establish standing, \r\n  citing the testimonial evidence of various members of the groups who had already \r\n  been adversely affected by the pollutants. Id. at 181-83. For instance, \r\n  some members who lived along the river near the plant had to refrain from recreational \r\n  activities such as fishing, hiking, camping, swimming, boating, and picnicking. \r\n  One member also attested to decreased property values.\r\n\r\nHowever, Laidlaw is distinguishable from \r\n  the instant case for two reasons. First, the League did not call any of its \r\n  members as a witness, whereas Friends called many of its members to testify. \r\n  See Laidlaw, 528 U.S. at 181-82; see also Carolina Alliance, \r\n  337 S.C. at 487, 523 S.E.2d at 800 (holding that an organization has standing \r\n  only if it shows its members will suffer injury). Although the League's attorney \r\n  argued that there was an injury in fact, arguments of counsel are not evidence. \r\n  See McManus v. Bank of Greenwood, 171 S.C. 84, 89, 171 S.E. 473, \r\n  475 (1933) (\"This court has repeatedly held that statements of fact appearing \r\n  only in argument of counsel will not be considered.\"); Bowers v. Bowers, \r\n  304 S.C. 65, 68, 403 S.E.2d 127, 129 (Ct. App. 1991); Gilmore v. Ivey, \r\n  290 S.C. 53, 58, 348 S.E.2d 180, 184 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\nSecondly, the League has shown only the potential \r\n  for future harm, whereas Friends clearly demonstrated in Laidlaw that \r\n  many of its members had already suffered harm. See Laidlaw, 528 \r\n  U.S. at 181-82. Even the League's own attorney stated before the Board that \r\n  its members had not suffered any harm, but merely feared the prospect of future \r\n  harm: \"We have many members in Beaufort County who have--the prospect \r\n  of exempting these islands from development would view it with severe concern \r\n  [sic], so we have stepped in to appeal the decision\" (emphasis added). Prospective \r\n  concern falls far short of the standard of \"concrete and particularized and \r\n  . . . actual or imminent\" harm set forth in Lujan. 504 U.S. at 560. Consequently, \r\n  the League did not present evidence of injury in fact.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the League does not allege injuries traceable \r\n  to the challenged action of Beaufort Realty. Mere filing of plats in itself \r\n  does not work any injury on the League's members or the public at large. Therefore, \r\n  the filing of the plats and the alleged harm to League members are not causally \r\n  connected.\r\n\r\nTherefore, we hold the League does not have standing \r\n  under the three-pronged Lujan test or under Rule 201, SCACR, since neither \r\n  it nor its members are aggrieved parties who have suffered injury in fact. Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n  AFFIRMED. \r\n\r\n  ANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.  \r\n\r\n1.

We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of April 5, 1997, Ramona and Richard Granger were performing lawn care at the home of Edyth Richards\r\nand Frances Gilbert when they noticed a bicycle leaning against the outside of the fence.  They observed James on the front\r\nporch of the residence, walking away from the front door.  His pockets were bulging.  When Mrs. Granger asked James if\r\nhe needed help, he replied that he was looking for \"the rent man.\"  Mrs. Granger told James no such person lived there. \r\nJames got on the bicycle and pedaled quickly away.\r\n\r\nMr. Granger asked his wife to check the front door.  When she said the door was open, he decided to follow James.  Mr.\r\nGranger called 911 on his cellular phone as he drove behind James.  James was apprehended after he abandoned his bicycle\r\nand hid behind a tree.  He had a screwdriver sticking out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nUpon investigation, police determined someone forcibly gained entry to the home of Richards and Gilbert through the front\r\ndoor.  Further, someone had rummaged through both bedrooms.  Several items were missing, including thirteen rolls of\r\nquarters.  Police later returned the missing property. (1)  After his arrest, James gave an oral statement in which he denied\r\nburglarizing the residence.\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  In a prosecution for first degree burglary where the aggravating circumstance is the defendant's prior convictions for\r\nburglary, housebreaking, or both, should the State be limited to introducing two prior convictions?\r\n\r\nII.  Does the trial court improperly allow the introduction of hearsay evidence by submitting the actual indictments of a\r\ndefendant's prior burglary convictions to the jury?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Introduction of Prior Convictions\r\n\r\nJames contends the trial court erred in allowing the State to introduce seven of his prior convictions for burglary where the\r\nState could have established the aggravating circumstance necessary to elevate the instant charge to first degree burglary\r\nwith the introduction of only two prior convictions.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nRulings on the admissibility of evidence are left \r\n  to the sound discretion of the trial court. State v. Blassingame, 338 \r\n  S.C. 240, 525 S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1999). The trial court's evidentiary rulings \r\n  will therefore be reversed only upon a showing of an abuse of discretion which \r\n  results in prejudice. State v. Fulton, 333 S.C. 359, 509 S.E.2d 819 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1998).\r\n\r\nJames was indicted for first degree burglary in violation of South Carolina\r\nCode section 16-11-311(A)(2), which reads: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(A) A person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to\r\ncommit a crime in the dwelling, and . . .\r\n\r\n(2) the burglary is committed by a person with a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a\r\ncombination of both â€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) (Supp. 2000) (emphasis added).  The trial court permitted the State to introduce seven\r\nof James' prior convictions for burglary over defense objections to the introduction of more than two prior offenses.  James\r\nmaintains introduction of more than two of his prior convictions was not necessary and was unduly prejudicial.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Hamilton, 327 S.C. 440, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 512 (Ct. App. 1997), this Court held that under section 16-11-311(A)(2), \r\n  \"prior burglary or housebreaking convictions are clearly an element of burglary \r\n  in the first degree.\" Id. at 446, 486 S.E.2d at 515. As such, the prosecution \r\n  in Hamilton was entitled to present evidence relevant and material to \r\n  that element of the offense, despite our \"well-established rule that evidence \r\n  that an accused has committed other crimes is not admissible in the prosecution \r\n  for the crime charged.\" Id. at 447, 486 S.E.2d at 515. The Court reasoned \r\n  that the prosecution could not be forced to stipulate generally to the prior \r\n  offenses or to the fact that the defendant had the legal status to be charged \r\n  with first degree burglary because such stipulation might cause a substantial \r\n  gap in the evidence needed for the jury to find the defendant guilty of the \r\n  offense. Id. at 446, 486 S.E.2d at 515.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Hamilton Court analyzed the prejudicial \r\n    impact of the evidence:\r\n\r\n  [H]ad the South Carolina General Assembly wished \r\n    to use the prior convictions as merely a sentence enhancer rather than as \r\n    an element of the crime, it could have done so â€¦. Certainly, a cogent argument \r\n    can be made that the statute contravenes the well-established rule that evidence \r\n    that an accused has committed other crimes is not admissible in the prosecution \r\n    for the crime charged. Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Gregory, 191 S.C. \r\n    212, 220, 4 S.E.2d 1, 4 (1939); State v. Williams, 31 S.C.L. (2 Rich.) \r\n    418, 421-22 (1845). It is not this court's province, however, to question \r\n    the wisdom of a legislative enactment.\r\n\r\n  Finally, Appellant asserts it was error to allow \r\n    proof of the prior burglary offenses because the evidence was not admissible \r\n    under any of the exceptions recognized in State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, \r\n    118 S.E. 803 (1923). Appellant's argument is misplaced, however, since the \r\n    State did not offer proof of his prior burglary convictions to establish motive, \r\n    intent, identity, or common scheme or plan. Here, Appellant's prior burglary \r\n    convictions were presented solely to prove an element of the crime for which \r\n    he was charged. Evidence which is logically relevant to a material element \r\n    of the offense charged should not be excluded merely because it may also show \r\n    guilt of another crime. See State v. Tillman, 304 S.C. 512, \r\n    518, 405 S.E.2d 607, 611 (Ct. App.), cert. denied, (Sept. 5, 1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHamilton, 327 S.C. at 447, 486 S.E.2d at \r\n  515-16 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court recently discussed this issue \r\n  in State v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000). The Court rejected \r\n  a claim that section 16-11-311(A)(2), \"'as interpreted in State v. Hamilton,'\" \r\n  unconstitutionally deprives defendants of due process of law \"'because evidence \r\n  required to prove the status element of prior convictions dilutes the State's \r\n  burden of proof with respect to the remaining elements of the offense.'\" Id. \r\n  at 154-55, 526 S.E.2d at 229. In concluding the statute did not facially violate \r\n  due process, the Court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo deter repeat offenders, the General Assembly chose to include two or more prior burglary and/or housebreaking\r\nconvictions as an element of first degree burglary.  The United States Supreme Court has held this is a valid state purpose\r\nwhich does not violate due process.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenton, 338 S.C. at 154, 526 S.E.2d at 230 \r\n  (emphasis added)(internal citation omitted). The Court noted \"evidence of other \r\n  crimes is admissible to establish a material fact or element of the crime charged.\" \r\n  Id. at 155, 526 S.E.2d at 230 (citing State v. Johnson, 293 S.C. \r\n  321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987)).\r\n\r\nJames contends that a Rule 403 analysis negates \r\n  the admissibility of the additional convictions. Benton states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [W]e note evidence of other crimes is admissible \r\n    to establish a material fact or element of the crime charged. State v. \r\n    Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987). . . . For purposes of an \r\n    element of first degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), we conclude the \r\n    probative value of admitting the defendant's prior burglary and/or housebreaking \r\n    convictions is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect. Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\nFurther, while generally inadmissible, propensity evidence is not prohibited.  Propensity evidence is admissible if offered\r\nfor some purpose other than to show the accused is a bad person or he acted in conformity with his prior convictions.  Rule\r\n404, SCRE (evidence of other crimes is not admissible to prove character to show action in conformity but to show motive,\r\nabsence of mistake or accident, intent, identity, the existence of common scheme or plan).  Here, appellant's two prior\r\nburglary convictions were offered to prove a statutory element of the current first degree burglary charge, not to suggest\r\nappellant was a bad person or committed the present burglary because he had committed prior burglaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBenton, 338 S.C. at 155-56, 526 S.E.2d at \r\n  230 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nSection 16-13-311(A)(2) provides a person is guilty of first degree burglary if he commits a burglary and has two or more\r\nconvictions for burglary, housebreaking, or a combination thereof.  Nothing in the statute limits the number of convictions\r\nthe State may use to prove this element of the offense.  Certainly had the General Assembly intended to limit the use of\r\nprior convictions to two in order to prevent the possibility of undue prejudice to the defendant, it could have easily done so. \r\nBecause the element is two or more qualifying prior offenses, we find no error in the court's admission of James' seven\r\nprior burglary convictions.\r\n\r\nWe are mindful of the potential for prejudicial \r\n  effect in the admission of such evidence. However, as is required, the trial \r\n  court instructed the jury to limit its consideration of James' prior convictions \r\n  to the particular purpose for which the convictions were offered. See \r\n  Benton, 338 S.C. at 156, 526 S.E.2d at 231; Hamilton, 327 S.C. \r\n  at 447, 486 S.E.2d at 516. See also Rule 105, SCRE (when evidence is \r\n  admissible for one purpose but not for another, the court, upon request, shall \r\n  restrict the evidence to its proper scope and instruct the jury accordingly). \r\n  The Court issued this instruction immediately after the admission of the evidence \r\n  and again during its general jury charge. These instructions required the jury \r\n  to consider James' prior convictions only to the extent necessary to determine \r\n  whether he was guilty of the aggravating circumstance charged, and not to consider \r\n  the offenses as evidence of bad character or as evidence of whether he committed \r\n  the burglary in question. We find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nII.  Admission of Prior Indictments\r\n\r\nJames maintains the trial court erred in admitting the prior indictments and submitting them to the jury for consideration. \r\nHe argues the indictments contain inadmissible, prejudicial hearsay.  This issue is not preserved.\r\n\r\nJames first objected to the introduction of the \r\n  indictments on this ground after the close of all evidence and the charge of \r\n  the jury. This objection was untimely. The State introduced the indictments \r\n  during the presentation of its case. Because James failed to contemporaneously \r\n  object on the ground he now asserts, this issue is not preserved. See \r\n  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001)(contemporaneous objection \r\n  required at trial to properly preserve error for appellate review); State \r\n  v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000)(issue not preserved if party \r\n  argues one ground for objection at trial and a different ground on appeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the trial court did not err in admitting seven of James' prior convictions for burglary.  Further, we find James'\r\ncontention that the indictments  should have been excluded because they contain inadmissible, prejudicial  hearsay is not\r\npreserved for our review.  Accordingly, James' first degree burglary conviction is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nHUFF, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J., concurring:  I agree with the decision to affirm this case but write separately because I believe the element\r\nof first degree burglary found in Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2) simply requires the State to prove at least two earlier convictions for\r\nburglary and/or housebreaking.  Thus, in my view, the statutory language referencing \"two or more\" prior convictions does\r\nnot mandate the admission of James' entire prior record for burglary; rather, the admissibility of his prior convictions is\r\ngoverned by traditional rules of evidence. \r\n\r\n  Hamilton and Benton do not dispense \r\n  with the requirement that all evidence be more probative than prejudicial. Instead, \r\n  these cases merely hold that two prior convictions for burglary, where necessary \r\n  to prove an essential element of the crime charged, are inherently more probative \r\n  than prejudicial. See Benton, 338 S.C. at 155-56, 526 S.E.2d at \r\n  230 (\"For purposes of an element of first degree burglary under Â§ 16-11-311(A)(2), \r\n  we conclude the probative value of admitting the defendant's prior burglary \r\n  and/or housebreaking convictions is not outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\"); \r\n  see also Hamilton, 327 S.C. at 446, 486 S.E.2d at 515 (implicitly \r\n  finding two prior convictions more probative than prejudicial because they were \r\n  an element of the crime that the State was required to prove; the court noted \r\n  that had the convictions been ruled inadmissible, \"there would have been a substantial \r\n  gap in the evidence necessary for the jury to convict Hamilton of burglary in \r\n  the first degree\"). \r\n\r\n  While I feel constrained by Benton and \r\n  Hamilton to find the trial court did not err in admitting all seven burglary \r\n  convictions, see, e.g., Hamilton, 327 S.C. at 445, 486 S.E.2d \r\n  at 514 (citing the \"fundamental principle\" that the State \"is entitled to prove \r\n  its case with evidence of its own choosing\"), I am mindful that neither case \r\n  involved the admission of more than two prior convictions into evidence. To \r\n  me, it is readily apparent that the problem arising from this case, the seemingly \r\n  unnecessary introduction of extremely prejudicial evidence of numerous prior \r\n  burglary convictions, stems directly from what appears to be a general prosecutorial \r\n  policy of refusing to accept a defendant's offer to admit the validity of the \r\n  predicate prior convictions. In my view, just because the State is entitled \r\n  to reject a defendant's \"stipulation\" in this regard does not mean that in the \r\n  interest of fairness it should.\r\n1. \r\nThe jury heard no testimony concerning where the\r\npolice recovered the stolen quarters because of a search and seizure violation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3362","title":"Johnson v.

Arbabi appeals the trial court's decision confirming title in \r\n  Gary Johnson for a condominium Johnson purchased at a tax sale. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nIn January 1981, Dr. Arbabi and his wife, Akram \r\n  Arbabi, as tenants in common, executed a contract to purchase a condominium \r\n  in the Island Club Horizontal Property Regime on Hilton Head Island from the \r\n  Island Club Investment Company (\"ICIC\"). The sale price was $90,000. ICIC financed \r\n  the transaction. Title to the property was to remain in ICIC's name until the \r\n  Arbabis paid their debt in full.\r\n\r\nThe Arbabis decided in 1989 or 1990 to pay off \r\n  the balance due ICIC. Prior to recording the deed in the Arbabis' names, Dr. \r\n  Arbabi's attorney requested copies of the property tax bills for 1988, 1989, \r\n  and 1990 from the Beaufort County Tax Assessor. The attorney additionally asked \r\n  the Tax Assessor's office to send all future tax bills to the Arbabis' primary \r\n  address at 3739 White Trillium Drive East in Saginaw, Michigan. The Beaufort \r\n  County authorities never responded to this letter. On September 3, 1991, the \r\n  Arbabis recorded their deed in the names of \"Mohammad B. Arbabi and Akram Arbabi.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe property taxes for 1990 were not paid. The \r\n  Beaufort County Treasurer issued a warrant of execution against ICIC. On May \r\n  1, 1991, Herschel J. Evans, Jr., the Deputy County Treasurer, sent a notice \r\n  of the delinquent tax sale to ICIC. Evans seized the property on July 2, 1991, \r\n  and the County took exclusive possession. The County Treasurer advertised the \r\n  tax sale in the name of ICIC. Johnson bought the property at the tax sale for \r\n  $7,000.\r\n\r\nDr. Arbabi moved out of the couple's White Trillium \r\n  Drive East home in July 1992 due to marital difficulties. By letter dated September \r\n  1, 1992, which was addressed jointly to Dr. and Mrs. Arbabi, the County Treasurer \r\n  stated the property had been sold and could be redeemed by paying $2,329.40 \r\n  by October 7, 1992. The notice was sent to the White Trillium Drive East address. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn November 1992, the County Treasurer issued Johnson \r\n  a tax deed, which indicated the defaulting taxpayer was ICIC. The deed additionally \r\n  stated the tax collector mailed \"to the owner of record on February 1, 1992 \r\n  (year of expiration of redemption period) a Notice addressed to Mohammed B. \r\n  and Akrem Arabi [sic] (owner of record on February 1, immediately preceding \r\n  the end of the redemption period).\"\r\n\r\nJohnson commenced an action to quiet title in January \r\n  1993. Dr. Arbabi filed an answer and brought a third-party complaint against \r\n  the Beaufort County Treasurer's Office and the County Treasurer, individually, \r\n  seeking to have the tax deed voided. (1) Mrs. \r\n  Arbabi did not make a return. Both Johnson and Dr. Arbabi moved for summary \r\n  judgment. The Circuit Court held the County had complied \r\n  with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-40(d) (2) in advertising \r\n  the property in the name of ICIC, the delinquent taxpayer for the 1990 taxes. \r\n  Dr. Arbabi's motion was denied upon this ground. The court decided, however, \r\n  the County did not comply with Â§ 12-51-120.  \r\n   (3)  \r\n\r\nThe judge found: \"Each owner had an interest in the property and the statute requires that each\r\nowner receive notice by 'certified mail return receipt requested -- deliver to addressee only.'  One\r\nnotice addressed to two owners does not comply with the notice requirements of S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n12-51-120.\"  Consequently, the court granted summary judgment to Dr. Arbabi and the tax deed\r\nwas declared invalid.  Upon Johnson's motion to alter or amend the judgment, the court modified\r\nits order. The judge declared Mrs. Arbabi to be in default.  He additionally granted Johnson the\r\nrelief requested in the complaint, but only as to the undivided half-interest of Mrs. Arbabi.  Dr.\r\nArbabi was ordered to pay Johnson one-half of the bid price and other amounts associated with\r\nthe sale.\r\n\r\nDr. Arbabi appealed the Circuit Court's decision. \r\n  In an unpublished opinion, Johnson v. Arbabi, Op. No. 96-UP-008 (S.C.Ct.App. \r\n  filed January 8, 1996), this Court deemed the trial court's issuance of relief \r\n  to Dr. Arbabi was erroneous: \"Dr. Arbabi did not state as a ground for his motion \r\n  the County's failure to comply with Â§ 12-51-120 â€¦. Hence, the circuit court \r\n  should not have addressed this ground.\" This Court determined the parties were \r\n  back to the respective positions they occupied before the summary judgment order \r\n  and the case would continue as if the ruling on Dr. Arbabi's motion had not \r\n  been made.\r\n\r\nOn remand, the trial court found the County Treasurer complied with\r\nÂ§ 12-51-40(d) when it advertised the property in the name of ICIC because: (1) ICIC was the\r\ndefaulting taxpayer; and (2) the County Treasurer was not aware of the unrecorded land contract\r\nbetween ICIC and the Arbabis.  The judge additionally ruled the County Treasurer satisfied Â§ 12-51-120 when it sent only one notice via restricted delivery to the White Trillium Drive East\r\naddress.  Mrs. Arbabi signed for the notice, which was addressed jointly to Dr. and Mrs. Arbabi;\r\nhowever, Dr. Arbabi no longer lived at the residence.  The court decreed Mrs. Arbabi acted as Dr.\r\nArbabi's agent; thus, her knowledge of the proceedings in Beaufort County was imputed to him. \r\nFurther, Dr. Arbabi was found to have ratified the actions of his wife: \"[Dr.] Arbabi made Mrs.\r\nArbabi his agent by not returning to the White Trillium address after they separated â€¦ [Dr.]\r\nArbabi did not stop Mrs. Arbabi from receiving his mail â€¦ [Dr.] Arbabi ratified the actions of his\r\nwife that were done on his behalf and the conduct of the parties establishes the agency\r\nrelationship.\"  Dr. Arbabi's argument regarding the County Treasurer's lack of adherence to Â§ 12-51-130, (4) a provision that in part specifies the recital of certain procedural information in the\r\nissuance of a tax deed, was rejected.  The judge noted the issue was not raised in Dr. Arbabi's\r\npleadings and asseverated he would have ruled against Dr. Arbabi even if the issue had been\r\nproperly before the court.  Johnson was declared to hold a valid title to the condominium.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThis is an action in equity. See Godfrey \r\n  v. Webb, 277 S.C. 246, 285 S.E.2d 883 (1982) (ruling suit to set aside a \r\n  tax deed is in equity); Bryan v. Freeman, 253 S.C. 50, 168 S.E.2d 793 \r\n  (1969) (holding an action to quiet title is equitable in nature). Therefore, \r\n  this Court may find facts according to our own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence. Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1976). In addition, this appeal presents novel issues of law. In \r\n  such a circumstance, we are free to decide issues presented to us with no particular \r\n  deference to the trial court's findings.

Agency Relationship Between \r\n  Dr. and Mrs. Arbabi\r\n\r\nDr. Arbabi argues the trial court erred in holding \r\n  Mrs. Arbabi was his agent at the time she received the redemption notice and \r\n  that consequently, her knowledge of the tax sale was imputed to him. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn 1992, the law required tax authorities to send \r\n  property owners notice of the redemption period's approaching end by \"certified \r\n  mail, return receipt requested -- deliver to addressee only.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 12-51-120 (Supp. 1991). The General Assembly amended the statute in 1996 to \r\n  substitute \"restricted delivery\" for \"deliver to addressee only\" to conform \r\n  with postal regulation terminology. Act No. 431, 1996 Acts 2622. The United \r\n  States Postal Service describes \"restricted delivery\" service as permitting \r\n  \"a mailer to deliver only to the addressee or addressee's authorized \r\n  agent.\" In re Ryan Inv. Corp., 335 S.C. 392, 394-95, 517 \r\n  S.E.2d 692, 693 (1999) (quoting United States Postal Services Domestic Mail \r\n  Manual Â§ S916.1.1) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nOn remand, the trial court concluded an agency \r\n  relationship could be implied from the relationship that existed between Dr. \r\n  Arbabi and Mrs. Arbabi. This Court holds an implied agency cannot satisfy the \r\n  requirements relating to the receipt of a redemption notice. An addressee's \r\n  \"authorized agent\" can only be a person acting pursuant to the express authority \r\n  of the addressee. See United States Postal Services Domestic Mail Manual \r\n  Â§ S916.3.1 (\"Mail marked 'Restricted Delivery' is delivered only to the addressee \r\n  or to the person authorized in writing as the addressee's agent to receive the \r\n  mail â€¦.\").\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, the following colloquy occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Counsel for Dr. Arbabi: I would ask that there \r\n    is certainly no evidence here that there was [an] agency relationship.\r\n\r\n  The Court: Well, let me ask you this. A husband \r\n    is always an agent for a wife and a wife is always an agent for her husband \r\n    in a situation like this. I mean ---\r\n\r\n  . . . . \r\n\r\n  The Court: I'm just thinking. You know, just like \r\n    you have parents are natural guardians[,] so you've got natural agents .â€¦\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court's pronouncement on this facet of agency \r\n  law was incorrect. \r\n\r\nA spouse, whether husband or wife, is not the agent \r\n  of the other by virtue of the marital relationship that exists between them. \r\n  Restatement (Second) of Agency Â§ 22, cmt. b (1957). In Barber v. Carolina \r\n  Auto Sales, 236 S.C. 594, 115 S.E.2d 291 (1960), the wife traded in the \r\n  husband's car for a new automobile while the husband was stationed in Germany \r\n  with the Army. The wife did not have permission, express or otherwise, to dispose \r\n  of the husband's car. Upon his return, the husband brought a conversion action \r\n  against the dealership. A nonsuit was granted by the trial court upon the grounds, \r\n  inter alia, the husband's absence created the implied authority \r\n  in the wife to act on his behalf and trade the automobile. The Supreme Court \r\n  disagreed with the trial court's assessment:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Where the wife is left in possession of the husband's \r\n    property during his absence, as where he has absconded and his whereabouts \r\n    are unknown, the law will imply or presume that she is acting as his agent \r\n    and that she has authority to exercise the usual and ordinary control over \r\n    the property. However, the mere fact that the husband is absent \r\n    does not give rise to a presumption that the wife is his agent generally; \r\n    her authority springs from and is limited to what can be reasonably presumed \r\n    to be the intention of the husband; it does not extend beyond the authority \r\n    which is usually and customarily conferred by husbands under the same or similar \r\n    circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 598, 115 S.E.2d at 293 (citations \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added); see also 41 C.J.S. Husband &amp; \r\n  Wife Â§ 56 (1991) (\"A spouse may constitute the other spouse as an agent \r\n  either expressly or impliedly; but, if agency is implied, it must be by conduct, \r\n  and not merely from a party's position as a spouse. Moreover, agency of a spouse \r\n  should not be implied lightly, especially when the other spouse may be prejudiced \r\n  seriously.\") (footnotes omitted); Annotation, 41 Am. Jur. 2d Husband and \r\n  Wife Â§ 155 (1995) (\"Agency between spouses does not automatically arise \r\n  from the marital relationship itself.\") (footnote omitted); S.C. Jur. Agency \r\n  Â§ 6 (1994) (\"No presumption arises from the fact of the marital relationship, \r\n  without more, that [a spouse] is the agent of [the other spouse].\") (footnote \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\nA spouse is not jure mariti the agent \r\n  of the other spouse. Pitt v. Speight, 24 S.E.2d 350 (N.C. 1943). If such \r\n  an agency is relied upon, it must be proven. Id.; see also \r\n  Hinson v. Roof, 128&nbsp;S.C.&nbsp;470, 475, 122 S.E. 488, 490 (1924) \r\n  (\"The marriage relation of the parties â€¦ is not necessarily enough to establish \r\n  the fact that the one is the agent of the other. There must be other proof.\") \r\n  (quoting Lunge v. Abbott, 95 A. 942, 943 (Me. 1915)). The existence of \r\n  agency between husband and wife is governed by the same rules that apply to \r\n  other forms of agencies. True v. Cudd, 106 S.C. 478, 91 S.E. 856 (1917). \r\n  At trial, Dr. Arbabi denied authorizing his wife to accept certified mail on \r\n  his behalf. Concomitantly, there is no evidence in the record indicating Dr. \r\n  Arbabi permitted Mrs. Arbabi to act upon his behalf regarding management of \r\n  the Beaufort County property. We hold the trial court erred in finding Mrs. \r\n  Arbabi was Dr. Arbabi's agent when she received the notice of the right to redeem.\r\n\r\nII. Sufficiency of Single \r\n  Notice\r\n\r\nDr. Arbabi argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  the County Treasurer complied with Â§ 12-51-120 when it mailed a joint redemption \r\n  notice to Dr. Arbabi and Mrs. Arbabi. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court and this Court \r\n  have held the enforcing agencies of government to strict compliance with all \r\n  the legal requirements surrounding tax sales. E.g., Dibble v. Bryant, \r\n  274 S.C. 481, 265 S.E.2d 673 (1980); Manji v. Blackwell, 323 S.C. 91, \r\n  473 S.E.2d 837 (Ct. App. 1996). Because notice to landowners, as required by \r\n  the tax sales statutes, is constructive rather than actual, the courts requires \r\n  strict compliance with these statutes. Southern Region Indus. Realty, Inc. \r\n  v. Timmerman, 285 S.C. 142, 328 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1985); Taylor v. \r\n  Jennings, 233 S.C. 600, 106 S.E.2d 391 (1958); Osborne v. Vallentine, \r\n  196 S.C. 90, 12 S.E.2d 856 (1941); Dickson v. Burckmyer, 67 S.C. 526, \r\n  46 S.E. 343 (1903); see also 72 Am. Jur. 2d State and Local \r\n  Taxation Â§ 1019 (1974) (stating the requirements of the statute as to the \r\n  service and proof of service of the notice required to terminate an owner's \r\n  right to redeem from a tax sale are considered mandatory and required to be \r\n  strictly followed). \"The sound view is that all requirements of the law leading \r\n  up to tax sales which are intended for the protection of the taxpayer against \r\n  surprise or the sacrifice of his property are regarded to be mandatory, and \r\n  are to be strictly enforced.\" Aldridge v. Rutledge, 269 S.C. 475, 478, \r\n  238 S.E.2d 165, 166 (1977) (quoting Osborne, 196 S.C. at 94, 12 S.E.2d \r\n  at 858); see also Marx v. Hanthorn, 148 U.S. 172, 180, \r\n  13 S. Ct. 508, 510, 37 L.Ed. 410 (1893) (\"As there must be express statutory \r\n  authority for selling lands for taxes, and as such sale is in the nature of \r\n  an ex parte proceeding, there must be, in order to make out a \r\n  valid title â€¦ compliance with the provisions of the law authorizing the sale. \r\n  A statutory power, to be validly executed, must be executed according to the \r\n  statutory directions.\").\r\n\r\nA taxing authority's failure to give the required \r\n  notice is not excused regardless of whether the taxpayer received actual notice. \r\n  Manji, 323 S.C. at 93, 473 S.E.2d at 838 (citing Aldridge, 269 \r\n  S.C. at 478, 238 S.E.2d at 166); see also South Carolina Fed. \r\n  Sav. Bank v. Atlantic Land Title Co., 314 S.C. 292, 295, 442 S.E.2d 630, \r\n  632 (Ct. App. 1994) (\"Statutory requirements protecting against tax sale forfeiture \r\n  of real property are strictly construed, and statutory notice requirements may \r\n  not be circumvented simply by establishing actual notice of a tax sale.\") (citation \r\n  omitted). Failure to give proper notice is a fundamental defect that renders \r\n  the proceedings absolutely void. Donohue v. Ward, 298 S.C. 75, 378 S.E.2d \r\n  261 (Ct. App. 1989); see also 72 Am. Jur. 2d State and Local \r\n  Taxation Â§ 916 (1974) (\"Statutory requirements of notice of a tax sale are \r\n  imperative and must be complied with; in the absence of notice to the tax delinquent, \r\n  a sale passes no title to the tax purchaser.\") (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\nIt is well established \"[w]hen â€¦ land is owned \r\n  in fee by tenants in common, notice to one of them [of the impending tax sale] \r\n  is not sufficient, and if notice is not given to all of them, the sale is void, \r\n  at least against those who have not been notified.\" 72 Am. Jur. 2d State \r\n  and Local Taxation Â§ 924 (1974) (footnote omitted). The same rule applies \r\n  regarding redemption notices: each co-tenant is equally entitled to separate \r\n  notice. Without proper notice, the entire transaction is void. As a practical \r\n  matter, we find one notice addressed to two or more tenants in common cannot \r\n  meet the requirements of Â§ 12-51-120. In sending a single notice, a tax authority \r\n  assumes the co-tenant who receives the notice will share it with the other co-tenants. \r\n  Such an assumption does not comport with our case law requiring strict compliance \r\n  with the notice requirements to afford each co-tenant protection against surprise \r\n  or the sacrifice of his property. Accordingly, we find the trial court erred \r\n  in holding the County Treasurer complied with Â§ 12-51-120. \r\n  (5) \r\n\r\nThis Court has promulgated: \"[W]here a statute \r\n  requires as a condition precedent to foreclosing a taxpayer's rights in property \r\n  sold for taxes that he be given notice of his right to redeem, such a requirement \r\n  is 'generally regarded as jurisdictional, and therefore, the owner's right of \r\n  redemption cannot be cut off unless the required notice is given.'\" Good \r\n  v. Kennedy, 291 S.C. 204, 207, 352 S.E.2d 708, 711 (Ct. App. 1987) (quoting \r\n  72 Am. Jur. 2d State and Local Taxation Â§ 1010 (1974)).\r\n\r\nCourts in other jurisdictions have recognized or \r\n  held the statutory provisions regarding notice to redeem are mandatory, and \r\n  that strict compliance with these requirements is essential to the validity \r\n  of a tax proceeding.

Gipson, 69 So.2d 305 (Fla. 1954) \r\n  (holding notice of right to redeem to one spouse was insufficient and tax deed \r\n  was void); Brousseau v. Conklin, 3 N.W.2d 260, 261 (Mich. 1942) (\"Until \r\n  the statutory notice is served upon all parties entitled thereto and proof thereof \r\n  is made and filed, the right of redemption remains to all.\" (citation omitted)); \r\n  Bodinger v. Garrison, 294 N.Y.S. 916 (N.Y. App. Div. 1937) (ruling failure \r\n  of holder of tax deed to give notice to redeem to all interested parties, as \r\n  required by law, vitiates tax deed); Teslovich v. Johnson, 406 A.2d 1374 \r\n  (Pa. 1979) (concluding tax sale was voided where separate and individual notice \r\n  was not provided to each named owner of the property, per the mandate of the \r\n  state law).\r\n\r\nIn contrariety, other tribunals have held the failure \r\n  to provide notice to a party having an interest in property renders the sale \r\n  as to that party's interest invalid, but does not prevent the sale from being \r\n  valid and effective as to the parties duly served. 72 Am. Jur. 2d State and \r\n  Local Taxation Â§ 925 (1974); see also, e.g., Hatcher \r\n  v. Howes, 128 S.W. 335 (Ky. 1910) (holding while sale of interest of a property \r\n  owner was void for lack of notice, it does not invalidate the sale of remaining \r\n  interests); In re Interstate Land Co., 43 So. 173 (La. 1906) (finding \r\n  adult co-owner was not entitled to relief when he received notice; however, \r\n  notice to adult was not binding on minor co-owners); Nugent v. Lindsley, \r\n  135 A. 271 (N.J. Ch. 1926) (voiding sale of interests of owners who had not \r\n  been served, but upholding sale of interests of those who had received notice).\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's tax sales laws were promulgated \r\n  to protect the government against wilful, persistent, and long standing delinquents. \r\n  They were not created to punish taxpayers who have failed to pay their taxes \r\n  because of legitimate mistake or error. The divestiture of a person's property \r\n  due to outstanding tax obligations is a drastic and serious measure. When government \r\n  issues notices relating to tax sales and redemption, it must do so in punctilious \r\n  compliance with the procedures outlined within the 1976 Code. Failure to assiduously \r\n  follow the delineated processes may result in the inequitable deprivation of \r\n  an owner's rights in his property. Therefore, we hold any material deviation \r\n  from the notice requirements will eventuate in the complete abrogation of a \r\n  transaction granting title to a tax sale purchaser. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe rule Â§ 12-51-120 requires the notice of the \r\n  right to redeem to be mailed to the owner of record or the owner's \"authorized \r\n  agent.\" The law of implied agency is not applicable \r\n  to the notice requirements of a tax sale. Under the statute and the regulations \r\n  of the United States Postal Service, an addressee's \"authorized agent\" is an \r\n  agent acting with express authority of the addressee.\r\n\r\nFinally, given this state's mandate that all proceedings \r\n  leading to a tax sale must strictly fulfill the statutory requirements to avoid \r\n  a forfeiture of the taxpayer's property, we hold a taxing authority's failure \r\n  to provide a co-tenant with notice of redemption voids the entire sale. As the \r\n  County Treasurer failed to provide Mr. Arbabi notice as required by Â§ 12-51-120, \r\n  we find the entire tax sale is void. The trial court thus erred in quieting \r\n  title to the condominium in Johnson. \r\n\r\n\r\n  REVERSED. \r\n     (6)\r\n\r\n  HEARN, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n  STILWELL, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J. (dissenting): \r\n   While I agree with the majority's analysis and result on \r\n  the question of the agency relationship between Dr. and Mrs. Arbabi, under the \r\n  peculiar circumstances of this case I respectfully disagree with their conclusion \r\n  on the question of the sufficiency of the legal notice. Therefore, I dissent.\r\n\r\nThe critical issue is whether the tax collector \r\n  of Beaufort County strictly complied with the requirements of S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 12-51-120 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2000) in sending only one written notice addressed \r\n  to co-tenants at their home address rather than two notices to the same address.\r\n\r\nWhile the law of this state unquestionably requires \r\n  the taxing authorities to strictly comply with all the legal requirements surrounding \r\n  tax sales, (7) I think those requirements were \r\n  met in this case. First, there is no question but that the correct method of \r\n  mailing was employed. That is the factual distinction between this case and \r\n  Manji v. Blackwell, (8) where the notice \r\n  was sent certified mail only and not \"deliver to addressee only.\" That deviation \r\n  from the requirement of the statute was the sole reason the tax sale was held \r\n  to be invalid in Manji.\r\n\r\nSecond, the correct and appropriate address was \r\n  utilized. That is the distinguishing factor between this case and the cases \r\n  of Benton v. Logan, (9) and Good&nbsp;v. \r\n  Kennedy. (10) In Benton, it was determined \r\n  that the tax official failed to exercise due diligence in determining the best \r\n  address available when a notice was returned to him marked \"Forwarding Order \r\n  Expired.\" No such return was made in this case. In Good, the tax collector \r\n  used an address other than the one on the deed and a tax sale was set aside \r\n  for that reason. There is no question but that the correct address of Dr. and \r\n  Mrs. Arbabi was utilized in this case, as it was the address they put on their \r\n  deed and was additionally confirmed by letter from Dr. Arbabi's personal attorney \r\n  directing any and all notices to him be sent to the address utilized by the \r\n  county treasurer.\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances, the sole question then \r\n  is whether the county treasurer should have sent two separate notices to the \r\n  same address. If so, should he have sent two notices, both addressed to both \r\n  people, or should he have sent the two notices addressed individually? It is \r\n  respectfully submitted either way the result would have been identical to the \r\n  result in this case. \r\n\r\nIt is as important to point out what this case \r\n  does not involve as what it does involve. It does not involve failing to send \r\n  the required notice to the delinquent taxpayer. The notice was sent to Dr. Arbabi \r\n  at his best address. It does not involve multiple owners who each provide separate \r\n  addresses for tax notice purposes. Both owners provided the same address. It \r\n  does not involve a failure to exercise due diligence. There was no reason for \r\n  the treasurer to believe that Dr. Arbabi was not being appropriately noticed \r\n  pursuant to the statute. It makes little sense to me that where multiple owners \r\n  provide only one address for notice purposes each one must be sent a separate \r\n  notice but all to the same address.\r\n\r\nHad the statute in question been worded so as to \r\n  provide that the mailing must be made to \"each owner of record,\" I would have \r\n  no complaint with the result reached by the majority. However, the statute merely \r\n  requires notice be sent \"'to the owner of record' . . . at the best address \r\n  of the owner available.\" The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and effectuate the intent of the legislature. (11) \r\n  Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the meaning \r\n  of a clear and unambiguous statute. (12)\r\n\r\nUnder the circumstances of this case, I would hold \r\n  that the specific requirements of the statute have been met and, while it is \r\n  regrettable that Dr.&nbsp;Arbabi did not receive actual notice, that is not \r\n  required by the statute and his failure to receive notice is not attributable \r\n  to any omission on the part of the treasurer, but is solely due to his own unfortunate \r\n  situation. I would affirm. \r\n1.    \r\n  Dr. Arbabi's claims against Beaufort County and the treasurer are not part of \r\n  this appeal. \r\n2.    \r\n  Section Â§ 12-51-40(d) stated, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The property must be advertised for sale at public \r\n    auction. The advertisement must be in a newspaper of general circulation within \r\n    the county or municipality, if applicable, and must be entitled \"Delinquent \r\n    Tax Sale.\" It shall include the delinquent taxpayer's name and the description \r\n    of the property, a reference to the county auditor's map-block-parcel number \r\n    being sufficient for a description of realty. The advertising must be published \r\n    once a week prior to the legal sales date for three consecutive weeks for \r\n    the sale of real property, and two consecutive weeks for the sale of personal \r\n    property.  \r\n\r\n3.    \r\n  When the County Treasurer sent the redemption notice to the Arbabis, Â§ 12-51-120 \r\n  read, in part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  Neither more than forty-five days nor less than \r\n    twenty days prior to the end of the redemption period for real estate sold \r\n    for taxes, the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent \r\n    taxes shall mail a notice by \"certified mail, return receipt requested -- \r\n    deliver to addressee only\" to the owner of record immediately preceding the \r\n    end of the redemption period at the best address of the owner available to \r\n    the person officially charged with the collection of delinquent taxes that \r\n    the real property described on the notice has been sold for taxes and if not \r\n    redeemed by paying taxes, assessments, penalties, costs and eight percent \r\n    interest on the bid price in the total amount of  ________ dollars \r\n    on or before  ________ (twelve months from date of sale) â€¦ a tax title \r\n    will be delivered to the successful purchaser at the tax sale. \r\n\r\n4.   When this dispute arose, Â§ 12-51-130 propounded, in part:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tax title shall include, among other things, the name of the defaulting taxpayer, the date of the execution, the date the\r\nrealty was posted and by whom, and the dates each certified notice was mailed to the party or parties of interest, to whom\r\nmailed and whether or not received by the addressee.\r\n\r\n5.  In its prior opinion, this Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"[E]ven if the issue of notice under Â§12-51-120 \r\n    [had been properly presented to] the trial court, we hold the statute does \r\n    not require separate notices to have been sent to the Arbabis. A joint notice \r\n    was sufficient if the statue was otherwise complied with and both Dr. and \r\n    Mrs. Arbabi signed the certified mail receipt for the joint notice.\" This \r\n    statement was obiter dictum and is not binding on our present \r\n    consideration of the issue.  \r\n\r\n6.  In light of this disposition, \r\n  we need not examine Dr. Arbabi's remaining issues on appeal. See Futch \r\n  v.
