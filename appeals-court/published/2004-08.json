Dickson, of Orangeburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  In this workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  case, Vaughn Homes, Inc. appeals the circuit courtâ€™s order reversing the full \r\n  commission and concluding Vaughn was liable for injuries sustained by an employee \r\n  of its subcontractor.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nVaughn Homes, a housing contractor, subcontracted with Jack Clark Constructions \r\n  for framing work.Â  Roy House, an employee of Clark, filed a workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claim after he was injured in the course and scope of his employment with Clark.Â  \r\n  At the time of Houseâ€™s accident, Clark did not have workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  \r\n\r\nWhen he was initially engaged to perform the work, Clark presented Vaughn with \r\n  a certificate indicating he had workersâ€™ compensation coverage from June 5, \r\n  1997, to June 5, 1998.Â  Upon the expiration of the original term, Clark provided \r\n  a certificate indicating continued coverage until June 7, 1999.Â  The history \r\n  of the policy indicates several instances of cancellation and reinstatement, \r\n  all based on nonpayment of premiums, until, in March 1999, Clark received notification \r\n  from his agent that the policy was due to expire in June.Â  A notice of cancellation \r\n  was served on Clark prior to the date of expiration, but Clark failed to pay \r\n  the renewal premium.Â  \r\nClark applied for a new policy with another insurance \r\n  agency on July 1, 1999, but coverage was declined.Â  Clark continued to perform \r\n  work for Vaughn, but admitted he neither notified Vaughn that his coverage had \r\n  lapsed for nonpayment nor advised Vaughn that his application for other coverage \r\n  was declined.Â  Clark, however, continued to verbally advise Vaughn that he did \r\n  have coverage.Â  \r\nFollowing hearings on Houseâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation claim, the single commissioner \r\n  transferred Vaughnâ€™s liability to the South Carolina Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund, \r\n  concluding Clark committed fraud by failing to notify its higher-tier contractor \r\n  of a lapse in coverage pursuant to South Carolina Code section 42-1-415(C) (Supp. \r\n  2003).Â  The full commission affirmed but the circuit court reversed, finding \r\n  Vaughn had notice of the expiration of Clarkâ€™s policy and failed to require \r\n  proof of coverage after the policy expired.Â  \r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\n When reviewing an appeal from the workersâ€™ compensation commission, the circuit \r\n  and appellate courts are proscribed from weighing the evidence or substituting \r\n  their judgment for that of the full commission on questions of fact.Â  However, \r\n  the reviewing court may reverse when a decision is predicated on an error of \r\n  law.Â  Pratt v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 353 S.C. 339, 344-45, 577 S.E.2d \r\n  475, 477-78 (Ct. App. 2003), affâ€™d as modified, 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d \r\n  272 (2004).Â  Statutory interpretation is a question of law.Â  Stewart v. Richland \r\n  Memâ€™l Hosp., 350 S.C. 589, 593, 567 S.E.2d 510, 512 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nVaughn argues it may transfer liability for Houseâ€™s injuries to the fund pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code Ann. section 42-1-415 (Supp. 2003).Â  Vaughn contends \r\n  the circuit court erred by interpreting section 42-1-415 to require a higher-tier \r\n  contractor to continue to collect proof of insurance coverage from its subcontractor \r\n  after originally collecting documentation at the time of hire.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe full commission affirmed the single commissionerâ€™s decision to relieve \r\n  Vaughn of liability based on the finding Clark committed fraud pursuant to section \r\n  42-1-415(C) (Supp. 2003).Â  In reversing, the circuit court concluded Vaughn \r\n  had notice that Clarkâ€™s policy would expire, and reasoned the burden fell upon \r\n  Vaughn to require appropriate evidence of continued coverage.Â  The court further \r\n  determined the commission erred as a matter of law in finding Clark committed \r\n  fraud, based essentially on two premises.Â  The first premise was that Clark \r\n  never represented to Vaughn that he had insurance coverage for any period of \r\n  time subsequent to June 7, 1999, and therefore could not be guilty of fraudulently \r\n  representing that he did.Â  As a second premise, the circuit court concluded \r\n  the expiration of a policy at the end of its term was not the type of â€œlapseâ€ \r\n  contemplated by the provisions of section 42-1-415.Â  \r\nHowever, neither the commissionâ€™s finding of fraud nor the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  focus on notice is determinative of whether liability may be transferred under \r\n  section 42-1-415.Â  Under subsection 42-1-415(A), a statutory employer, such \r\n  as Vaughn, may transfer liability to the fund when a subcontractorâ€™s employee \r\n  is injured if the statutory employer submits documentation to the fund that \r\n  the subcontractor has represented himself as having workersâ€™ compensation coverage \r\n  â€œat the time the . . . subcontractor was engaged to perform work.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(A) (Supp. 2003); see also Harrell v. Pineland Plantation, \r\n  Ltd., 337 S.C. 313, 330, 523 S.E.2d 766, 774-75 (1999) (noting that pursuant \r\n  to section Â§ 42-1-415(A), â€œa statutory employer is no longer directly liable \r\n  for workersâ€™ compensation payments whenever documentation is presented to the \r\n  commission that a contractor or subcontractor represented himself to the statutory \r\n  employer as having workersâ€™ compensation insuranceâ€).Â  Subsection (B) permits \r\n  a higher-tier contractor to qualify for reimbursement of benefits paid if it \r\n  collects documentation of insurance coverage â€œat the time the . . . subcontractor \r\n  is engaged to perform work.â€Â  S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (B).Â  \r\n When the language of a statute is plain, unambiguous and conveys a clear and \r\n  definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are unnecessary and \r\n  the court may not impose another meaning.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. \r\n  79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  Under these circumstances, the court will \r\n  not resort to subtle or forced construction in an attempt to limit or expand \r\n  a statuteâ€™s scope.Â  Paschal v. State Election Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 434, 436-37, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1995).Â  \r\nSubsections (A) and (B) of section 42-1-415 set out the procedure the higher-tier \r\n  contractor must follow in order to relieve itself of responsibility for workplace \r\n  injuries to the employees of its subcontractors.Â  Vaughn complied fully with \r\n  the mandate of subsections (A) and (B) when it collected documentation of insurance \r\n  at the time Clark â€œwas engaged to perform work.â€Â  The statute does not require \r\n  a prime contractor to continue collecting proof of its subcontractorâ€™s insurance \r\n  coverage after the subcontractor is engaged to perform the work.Â  We are loath \r\n  to read such a requirement into a statute that otherwise contains such straightforward \r\n  language.Â  \r\nSubsection (C) of section 42-1-415 is directed toward the subcontractor, places \r\n  upon it the duty to notify the higher-tier contractor of any lapse in coverage, \r\n  and sets forth the consequences of the subcontractorâ€™s failure to do so when \r\n  it provides, in relevant part:\r\n \r\n  Knowing and wilful failure to notify, by certified mail, the higher tier \r\n    . . . contractor . . . who originally was provided documentation of workersâ€™ \r\n    compensation coverage of a lapse in coverage within five days after the lapse \r\n    is considered fraud and subjects the . . . subcontractor who represented himself \r\n    as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance to the penalties for fraud provided \r\n    by law. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(C).Â  \r\nThe use in subsection (C) of the word â€œoriginallyâ€ lends support to the reasoning \r\n  that the information given at the inception of the engagement is the controlling \r\n  factor, negating any statutory requirement on the part of the higher-tier contractor \r\n  to continue collecting proof of insurance.Â  \r\n\r\n  Statutes which are part of the same legislative scheme should be construed \r\n    together.Â  In construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a \r\n    whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory law must \r\n    be construed together and each one given effect, if it can be done by any \r\n    reasonable construction.Â  \r\n\r\nState v. Gordon, 356 S.C. 143, 152, 588 S.E.2d \r\n  105, 110 (2003) (internal citation omitted). \r\nWe hold that because Vaughn complied with the provisions of section 42-1-415(A) \r\n  and (B), it is entitled to shift the burden of paying workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  benefits to the fund.Â  The order of the circuit court is, therefore,\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nHUFF, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3851","title":"Shapemasters Golf Course Builders, Inc. v.

(â€œS.C. Corp.â€), a South Carolina \r\n  corporation engaged in the business of golf course construction.Â  In 2001, the \r\n  same parties established Shapemasters Golf Course Builders, Inc. (â€œN.C. Corp.â€), \r\n  a North Carolina corporation for the same purpose. \r\nRespondents Cagle and Harbin ceased active involvement in S.C. Corp., and only \r\n  remained associated with the company as shareholders.Â  At that point, Appellant \r\n  Jeffrey Stein operated S.C. Corp. and Respondents Harbin, Cagle, and Burger \r\n  operated N.C. Corp.Â  Appellants claim Stein, Harbin, and Cagle own S.C. Corp., \r\n  and Harbin, Cagle, Burger, and Stein own N.C. Corp. \r\n  [1]  \r\nIn December 2001, Respondents commenced this action against Appellants asserting \r\n  several causes of action.Â  Appellants answered and counterclaimed seeking, in \r\n  part, an accounting, stock buy out, and a temporary restraining order.Â  \r\nBoth parties filed motions for the appointment of a custodian to protect the \r\n  assets of the various companies while the case was being litigated.Â  Respondents \r\n  agreed to the appointment of a custodian for N.C. Corp., but Appellants objected \r\n  to a custodian being appointed for S.C. Corp. on grounds that such an appointment \r\n  would be unduly costly and burdensome.Â  \r\nThe trial court found that Respondents successfully made a prima facie case \r\n  to justify the appointment of a custodian to oversee S.C. Corp.Â  The court granted \r\n  Respondentsâ€™ request for an appointment in an order dated July 15, 2002.Â  The \r\n  courtâ€™s order delineated the responsibility of the custodian, including that \r\n  he or she should assemble and review both of the companiesâ€™ financial statements, \r\n  seek to maximize profits, and serve bi-monthly income and expenditure reports \r\n  on attorneys for each party.Â  \r\nAppellants filed a motion to alter or amend the July 15, 2002 order. In addition, \r\n  Appellants filed supplemental motions seeking the withdrawal of the courtâ€™s \r\n  July 15, 2002 order, referral to a master-in-equity, the termination of discovery, \r\n  elimination of a custodian for S.C. Corp., restraining orders preventing anyone \r\n  from competing with the two companies or obtaining employment with a competitor, \r\n  restraining order preventing Respondents from using the name or logo â€œShapemastersâ€ \r\n  in their business dealings, eliminating any commingling of assets between the \r\n  two companies, and the designation of a CPA to audit the companies.Â  \r\nIn response to these motions the trial court issued a second order dated December \r\n  21, 2002.Â  This order vacated the courtâ€™s July 15, 2002 order.Â  The court ordered \r\n  mediation and referred the case to a master-in-equity with the reservation that \r\n  the master should report any jury matters.Â  The court also ordered an audit \r\n  going back to 1996, denied Appellantsâ€™ request to eliminate the need for a custodian, \r\n  appointed Richard E. Heath as the custodian, denied Appellantsâ€™ request to end \r\n  discovery, and denied Appellantsâ€™ requests that Respondents be restrained from \r\n  working for competitors. As to the use of the name and logo â€œShapemasters,â€ \r\n  the trial court specifically reserved ruling on the issue, stating that the \r\n  master should address it in his final order.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES \r\n  [2] \r\n\r\n   \r\n    I.\r\n    \r\n    Is the denial of a restraining order immediately appealable? \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Did the trial court err in refusing to grant Appellantsâ€™ \r\n      motion for a restraining order?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n   \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    Is the appointment of a custodian immediately appealable? \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.&nbsp;\r\n    \r\n     \r\n      Did the trial court err in appointing a custodian to oversee \r\n        operations? \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n I.&nbsp;Restraining Order\r\nAppellants first assert the trial court erred in refusing to grant Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  motion for a restraining order with regards to the use of the â€œShapemastersâ€ \r\n  name and logo and regarding Cagleâ€™s, a Respondent in this matter, employment \r\n  with a direct competitor.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAppellants correctly argue that the refusal to \r\n  grant a restraining order is immediately appealable.Â  â€œAn order or decree in \r\n  a court of common pleas granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction \r\n  is immediately appealable.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§ 14-3-330(4); see also \r\n  Appeal of Paslay, 230 S.C. 55, 64, 94 S.E.2d 57, 61 (1956) (appeal lay \r\n  from the restraining order or temporary injunction). However, we must first \r\n  determine whether the issue is preserved for appellate review.\r\nAppellants further argue the trial court erred \r\n  in refusing to grant an injunction regarding the use of the name Shapemasters \r\n  as the company logo and name.Â  Appellants argue that Cagle and other Respondents \r\n  in this matter are not only using the company name, but also working with a \r\n  direct competitor. \r\nThe trial judge did not rule on the use of the \r\n  Shapemasters name and logo issue. Further, Appellants failed to pursue a Rule \r\n  59 motion on the December 2002 order; therefore, the issue is not preserved \r\n  for review. [3] Â  Moreover, we believe Appellantsâ€™ arguments \r\n  are without merit.Â  Appellants consented to the use of the name and logo when \r\n  they established N.C. Corp.Â  N.C. Corp. has been conducting business under the \r\n  Shapemasters name since its formation in 2001.Â  To require N.C. Corp to cease \r\n  the use of the name and logo during the pendency of this action would disrupt \r\n  business and have an unduly negative impact on N.C. Corp. Appellants and Respondents \r\n  are shareholders in N.C. Corp. and will share any profits generated by N.C. \r\n  Corp.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Appellants have failed to show irreparable \r\n  harm with regards to Appellantsâ€™ employees working for competitors.Â  See \r\n  FOC Lawshe Ltd. Pâ€™ship v. Intâ€™l Paper Co., 352 S.C. 408, 416, 574 S.E.2d \r\n  228, 232 (Ct. App. 2002) (â€œGenerally, to obtain an injunction, a party must \r\n  demonstrate irreparable harm, a likelihood of success on the merits, and an \r\n  inadequate remedy at law.â€). The fact that Appellantsâ€™ employees occasionally \r\n  work for direct competitors is not unduly harmful to Appellants as there is \r\n  no evidence in the record that the employees acquired, or attempted to acquire, \r\n  any business for the competitor.Â  In fact, the record reflects that the employeesâ€™ \r\n  function for competitors is one of providing labor as heavy machine operators.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\n II.&nbsp;&nbsp;Appointment of Custodian\r\nAppellants next assert that the appointment of \r\n  a custodian is immediately appealable and that the trial court erred in appointing \r\n  a custodian to manage the daily operations of the companyâ€™s affairs.Â  Appellants \r\n  assert that the appointment of a custodian has the same effect as the appointment \r\n  of a receiver.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(4) (stating an appellate \r\n  court has jurisdiction to review an interlocutory order refusing the appointment \r\n  of a receiver).Â  We disagree.\r\nReceivers and custodians are distinguishable.Â  \r\n  A receiverâ€™s duty is to wind up and liquidate the business and affairs of a \r\n  corporation, while custodians manage the affairs of the corporation.Â  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. 33-14-320 (Supp. 2003).Â  A receiver, in performing its duties, \r\n  may:\r\n\r\n  [D]ispose of all or any part of the assets of the corporation wherever located, \r\n    at a public or private sale, if authorized by the court; and (ii) may sue \r\n    and defend in his own name as receiver of the corporation in all courts of \r\n    this State.\r\n\r\nHowever, a custodian may:\r\n\r\n  [E]xercise all of the powers of the corporation, through or in place of its \r\n    board of directors or officers, to the extent necessary to manage the affairs \r\n    of the corporation in the best interests of its shareholders and creditors.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-320(c)(2).\r\nâ€œOne of the purposes of a receivership is that the \r\n  assets shall be held in impartial hands, that the proceeds may be administered \r\n  according to the priorities of the claims thereto.â€Â  National Cash Register \r\n  Co. v. Burns, 217 S.C. 310, 316, 60 S.E.2d 615, 618 (1950). The refusal \r\n  of a trial court to appoint a receiver should be immediately appealable because \r\n  of the potential harm in not having an unbiased party to protect a corporationâ€™s \r\n  assets.Â  We do not believe the same level of harm attends an order to appoint \r\n  a custodian.Â  The custodian in this matter was appointed specifically for the \r\n  purposes of â€œoverseeing ongoing projects and to allocate man and machinery among \r\n  the proposed projects to maximize profits.â€Â  The trial court did not commit \r\n  error in appointing a custodian and assigning him with the aforementioned duties.Â  \r\n  Additionally, we do not believe the term receiver, as set forth in section 14-3-320(4) \r\n  has the same effect as the term custodian.Â  Therefore the courtâ€™s order to appoint \r\n  a custodian is interlocutory and not immediately appealable.  [4] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe lower court did not err in refusing to grant a restraining order regarding \r\n  the use of the Shapemastersâ€™ name and logo.Â  Further, the appointment of a custodian \r\n  is interlocutory in nature and does not fall into a delineated exception. Â As \r\n  such, the trial courtâ€™s rulings are\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; DISMISSED IN PART; AND REMANDED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Respondents aver that prior to the establishment of N.C. Corp., Burger \r\n    became a 25% shareholder in S.C. Corp.Â  Accordingly, Respondents assert the \r\n    four partners own equal 25% interests in both companies.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Appellants state a total of seven issues on appeal. However, we feel \r\n    that most of the issues may be condensed into four issues for our consideration. \r\n    Appellantsâ€™ remaining issues are unsupported by authority and are deemed abandoned.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  See I'On v. Town of \r\n    Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (stating parties should \r\n    raise all necessary issues and arguments to trial court and attempt to obtain \r\n    a ruling); Townsend v. City of Dillon, 326 S.C. 244, 486 S.E.2d 95 \r\n    (1997) (holding issues not ruled upon by the trial judge are not preserved \r\n    for appellate review); Noisette v.

Â§Â§ 1001 to -1461 (Supp. 2003) (â€œERISAâ€).Â  The jury rendered a \r\n  verdict in favor of Respondents.Â  The trial court subsequently denied Requaâ€™s \r\n  post-trial motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and new trial.Â  \r\n  Requa now appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nBACKGROUND\r\nRequa was an insurance agent doing business \r\n  in Moncks Corner, South Carolina.Â  At the center of this case is a health insurance \r\n  plan administered by Fidelity Group, Inc., that Requa marketed to American AVK \r\n  Company for its employees.Â  At issue was whether Requa was liable for Fidelityâ€™s \r\n  failure to pay legitimate medical expense claims filed by Holroyd, one of American \r\n  AVKâ€™s employees.\r\nFidelityâ€™s Health Insurance Plan\r\nThe program administered by Fidelity was \r\n  not a typical insurance plan.Â  Rather than being developed and sold by a traditional \r\n  insurance company, the Fidelity plan was the product of an association of several \r\n  distinct entities.Â  \r\nAround 1995, a purported employee union \r\n  called the International Workers Guild (IWG) (also known as the International \r\n  Workers Association) entered into a collective bargaining agreement with a purported \r\n  employerâ€™s association, the National Association of Business Owners and Professionals \r\n  (NABOP). [1] Â  Under this agreement, \r\n  employees joining IWG would be provided healthcare benefits through a third-party-trust \r\n  called the International Guild Health and Welfare Trust Fund (IWG Fund).Â  The \r\n  arrangement provided in part that employers would join the collectively bargained \r\n  agreement prepared by the organizers of the arrangement with IWG and NABOP.Â  \r\n  Employees paid membership dues to IWG, and the employers made monthly contributions \r\n  on behalf of their enrolled employees.Â  The IWG Fund managed the plan, and Fidelity \r\n  marketed it and administered claims. \r\nRequa was recruited to market the \r\n  Fidelity plan to his customers by John Branham and Marty Geitler, the exclusive \r\n  general agents for the Plan.Â  Over the course of two meetings, Branham and Geitler \r\n  explained the structure and benefits of the Plan and provided Requa with marketing \r\n  materials prepared by Fidelity.Â  Several months later, Requa executed a marketing \r\n  agreement to act as agent for the Fidelity Plan. \r\nRequaâ€™s Solicitation of American \r\n  AVK\r\nIn late 1996, Requa sent a letter to American AVK \r\n  Company, a subsidiary of an international company with offices in California \r\n  and South Carolina, soliciting interest in a group health insurance program \r\n  from Fidelity Group, Inc. \r\nThe letter described the pricing, benefits, and \r\n  network of care providers that were included in the Fidelity plan.Â  Requa made \r\n  various claims in the letter about the quality of the Fidelity plan.Â  He wrote \r\n  that it offered â€œgreat benefits with reasonable prices,â€ had â€œ[a] history of \r\n  low rate increases and an A+ rate,â€ was â€œ#1 in benefits compared to other carriers,â€ \r\n  and was â€œ[l]ocally strong with reciprocal access nationwide.â€Â  In addition to \r\n  these more subjective claims, Requa specifically noted that â€œ[t]he Fidelity \r\n  Group has an average annual rate increase of only 3.4% over the last 8 years.â€Â  \r\n  The letter further claimed Fidelity was reinsured through â€œReliance [Reinsurance \r\n  Company], rated A+ by A.M. Best.â€ [2] Â  The Fidelity plan was the only product promoted \r\n  in the letter.\r\nShortly after receiving Requaâ€™s letter, American \r\n  AVK decided to enroll in the Fidelity Plan.Â  American AVK paid monthly premiums \r\n  for the coverage and the participating employees made monthly contributions.\r\nFailure of the Fidelity Plan\r\nWithin months of American AVKâ€™s enrollment \r\n  in the Plan, Fidelity began having problems paying claims in a timely manner.Â  \r\n  No later than July 1997, Requa was aware Fidelity was experiencing problemsâ€”specifically \r\n  advising one of his clients that â€œ[t]he Fidelity Group has apparently experienced \r\n  rapid growthâ€”too soonâ€”without the capacity to handle it.â€ \r\nAlso in July 1997, Requa received a letter \r\n  from the South Carolina Department of Insurance notifying him that the Fidelity \r\n  Groupâ€™s insurance plan and Requaâ€™s involvement in marketing that plan were the \r\n  subject of an investigation as to whether Fidelity had complied with state law \r\n  regulating the sale of insurance.Â  The letter instructed Requa to immediately \r\n  cease the marketing and sale of the Plan until the Department of Insurance was \r\n  able to make a final determination. \r\nIt is undisputed that Requa did not advise \r\n  American AVK or its employees of the difficulties experienced by the Fidelity \r\n  Plan or the ongoing investigation when he learned of the problems.Â  In May 1998, \r\n  Requa claimed he sent a letter to all of his clients enrolled in the Fidelity \r\n  Plan, including American AVK, advising them that â€œyour health insurer, The Fidelity \r\n  Group, has some serious problems and that it may be time to move to another, \r\n  more competent carrier.â€ Respondents, however, deny ever having received this \r\n  letter. \r\nHolroydâ€™s Unpaid Claims\r\nThis action arises from unpaid medical \r\n  claims submitted to Fidelity by one of American AVKâ€™s enrolled employees, Christopher \r\n  Holroyd.Â  Holroyd suffered severe heart attacks in July and October 1998.Â  He \r\n  incurred approximately $65,000 in medical costs, which Fidelity did not pay.Â  \r\n  Because Requa failed to inform them of Fidelityâ€™s problems, Holroyd, his wife, \r\n  Gillian, and American AVK filed the underlying action against Requa.Â  The jury \r\n  returned a verdict in favor of Respondents on the charges of negligence, negligent \r\n  misrepresentation, and breach of fiduciary duty.Â  Respondents were awarded $365,000 \r\n  in actual damages and $180,000 in punitive damages.\r\nRequa moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  (JNOV), a new trial absolute, and a new trial nisi remittitur, which were denied.Â  \r\n  Requa appeals. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn ruling on directed verdict or JNOV motions, \r\n  the trial court is required to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably \r\n  can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the \r\n  motions.â€Â  Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 \r\n  S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â  The motions must be denied by the trial court when \r\n  the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.Â  Steinke \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, \r\n  386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999).Â  On appeal from the denial of a motion for \r\n  a directed verdict or JNOV, this Court will reverse the trial court only where \r\n  there is no evidence to support the ruling below.Â  Id.; Creech v. \r\n  South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 29, 491 S.E.2d \r\n  571, 573 (1997).Â  \r\nâ€œFurther, a trial courtâ€™s decision granting or \r\n  denying a new trial will not be disturbed unless the decision is wholly unsupported \r\n  by the evidence or the courtâ€™s conclusions of law have been controlled by an \r\n  error of law.â€Â  Sabb, 350 S.C. at 427, 567 S.E.2d at 236; Vinson v. \r\n  Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 405, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  In determining \r\n  whether the judge erred in denying a motion for a new trial, we must look at \r\n  the testimony and inferences raised therefrom in favor of the nonmoving party.Â  \r\n  Welch v. Epstein, 342 S.C. 279, 302-03, 536 S.E.2d 408, 420 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Timeliness of Appeal\r\nAs a threshold matter, \r\n  Respondents argue this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to consider this \r\n  appeal because Requaâ€™s post-trial motions were not timely filed.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 59(b), SCRCP, provides \r\n  that â€œ[t]he motion for new trial shall be made promptly after the jury is discharged, \r\n  or in the discretion of the court not later than 10 days thereafter.â€Â  In the \r\n  present case, the jury rendered its verdict on December 20, 2001.Â  Requa filed \r\n  his post-trial motions twenty-six days later on January 15, 2002.Â  Respondents \r\n  assert that Requaâ€™s failure to make his post-trial motion within the ten days \r\n  prescribed by Rule 59(b) divests this Court of jurisdiction to review the case.\r\nThe juryâ€™s verdict in \r\n  this case did not constitute an adjudication of all the claims in the case.Â  \r\n  The parties agreed that Respondentsâ€™ claim brought under the Unfair Trade Practices \r\n  Act (UTPA) would be submitted to the trial court.Â  The trial court stated at \r\n  the conclusion of trial that a written order on the UTPA claim would be issued \r\n  at a later date.Â  Respondents sent Requa a notice on January 8, 2002, that they \r\n  intended to withdraw their UTPA claim.Â  The UTPA claim, however, was formally \r\n  withdrawn by Respondents on January 23, 2002.Â Â  \r\nRule 54(b), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\nWhen more than one claim for \r\n  relief is presented in an action, whether as a claim, counterclaim, cross-claim, \r\n  or third-party claim, or when multiple parties are involved, the court may direct \r\n  the entry of a final judgment as to one or more but fewer than all of the claims \r\n  or parties only upon an express determination that there is no just reason for \r\n  delay and upon an express direction for the entry of judgment. In the absence \r\n  of such determination and direction, any order or other form of decision, however \r\n  designated, which adjudicates fewer than all the claims or the rights and liabilities \r\n  of fewer than all the parties shall not terminate the action as to any of the \r\n  claims or parties, and the order or other form of decision is subject to revision \r\n  at any time before the entry of judgment adjudicating all the claims and the \r\n  rights and liabilities of all the parties.\r\n\r\nThe trial court had \r\n  not ruled on all of the claims presented at the time the jury rendered its verdict.Â  \r\n  The trial court also made no â€œexpress determinationâ€ that there was no reason \r\n  for delay in entering judgment on the claims that had been submitted to the \r\n  jury.Â  Accordingly, the time for filing post-trial motions did not begin to \r\n  run until the time Respondentsâ€™ UTPA claim had been withdrawn.Â  Requa filed \r\n  his post-trial motions within seven days of the informal notice of withdrawal \r\n  and eight days prior to the formal withdrawal.Â  Requaâ€™s post-trial motions were \r\n  therefore timely under the rules.\r\nFurther, this Court \r\n  generally only lacks jurisdiction over an appeal when the notice of appeal is \r\n  untimely.Â  The notice of appeal must be served in civil cases within thirty \r\n  days after receipt of written notice of entry of final order.Â  When a party \r\n  makes a timely post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, to \r\n  alter or amend the judgment, or for a new trial, â€œthe time for appeal for all \r\n  parties shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written notice of entry \r\n  of the order granting or denying such motion.â€Â  Rule 203(b)(1), SCACR.Â  The \r\n  failure to timely serve a notice of appeal â€œdivests this court of subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction and results in dismissal of the appeal.â€Â  Canal Ins. Co. v. \r\n  Caldwell, 338 S.C. 1, 5, 524 S.E.2d 416, 418 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nAs previously discussed, Requa \r\n  timely filed his post-trial motions after the UTPA claim was informally dismissed.Â  \r\n  The trial court issued his order denying Requaâ€™s post-trial motions on January \r\n  25, 2002.Â Â  Requa filed and served his notice of appeal on the same day.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  Requa served his notice of appeal within the time prescribed by the rules, and \r\n  this Court has jurisdiction to entertain this appeal.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  ERISA Preemption\r\nA primary component \r\n  of Requaâ€™s defense in the present case was his argument that the state law claims \r\n  Respondents asserted were preempted and barred by ERISA.Â  The trial court denied \r\n  Requaâ€™s motions for directed verdict and for JNOV based on ERISA preemption.Â  \r\n  Requa appeals these rulings.\r\nInitially, Requa argues \r\n  one of the trial courtâ€™s rulings mandated a finding that Respondentsâ€™ claims \r\n  were preempted by ERISA.Â  One way to come within the purview of ERISA is if \r\n  a healthcare plan provided to employees is an â€œemployee welfare benefit planâ€ \r\n  (EWBP).Â  Whether a plan is an EWBP is a question of fact.Â  Intâ€™l Assâ€™n of \r\n  Entrepreneurs of Am. Benefit Trust v. Foster, 883 F.Supp. 1050, 1056 (E.D.Va. \r\n  1995).Â  A plan can be established as an EWBP if: (1) it is established by a \r\n  bona fide employer or employee group, and (2) the purpose is to provide the \r\n  beneficiaries, through the purchase of insurance or otherwise, medical or other \r\n  benefits.Â  29 U.S.C. Â§ 1002 (1); Foster, 883 F. Supp. at 1056.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe trial court in the present \r\n  case ruled in a pre-trial motion for summary judgment that the healthcare plan \r\n  â€œsold by Requa to Plantiffs is and was at all relevant times insurance.â€Â  At \r\n  trial, Requa requested that he be permitted to refer to the plan during trial \r\n  as a â€œgroup health insurance plan,â€ and the trial court allowed him to do so.Â  \r\n  Therefore, Requa argues the trial court determined the plan was a group health \r\n  insurance plan which qualified as an Employee Welfare Benefit Plan, and thus, \r\n  ERISA preempted Respondentsâ€™ state law claims.Â  Although the trial court permitted \r\n  Requa to refer to the healthcare plan as a group health insurance plan, this \r\n  does not amount to a legal finding that the plan fell within the purview of \r\n  ERISA and it does not alter the prior order finding the plan was â€œinsurance.â€Â  \r\n  Accordingly, this argument has no merit.Â  \r\nIn any event, Congress \r\n  imposed comprehensive federal oversight of employee benefit plans with the passage \r\n  of ERISA.Â  ERISA provides for express preemption of â€œany and all State laws \r\n  insofar as they may now or hereafter relate toâ€ employee benefit plans.Â  29 \r\n  U.S.C. Â§ 1144(a).Â  â€œA state law claim â€˜relates toâ€™ an employee benefit plan \r\n  if it has a connection with or reference to the plan.â€Â  Heaitley v. Brittingham, \r\n  Dial &amp; Jeffcoat, 320 S.C. 466, 469, 465 S.E.2d 763, 765 (Ct. App. 1995) \r\n  (citing Shaw v. Delta Air Lines Inc., 463 U.S. 85, 97 (1983)).Â  Although \r\n  ERISAâ€™s preemption language is broad, state law claims â€œwhich affect employee \r\n  benefit plans in â€˜too tenuous, remote, or peripheral a mannerâ€™ do not relate \r\n  to the planâ€ and, thus, are not preempted by ERISA.Â  Id.; Dist. of \r\n  Columbia v. Greater Washington Bd. of Trade, 506 U.S. 125 (1992).Â  \r\nThis Court has previously addressed \r\n  whether certain state law claims for damages due to misrepresentation and professional \r\n  negligence were preempted by ERISA.Â  In Heaitley, a widow sought damages \r\n  from her deceased husbandâ€™s former partnership for continuing to accept his \r\n  life insurance premiums during his lifetime despite deleting him from the policy.Â  \r\n  This Court held her state law claim was only â€œindirectlyâ€ related to ERISA in \r\n  that she was not seeking to recover benefits under the policy.Â  The widow was \r\n  seeking damages for misrepresentation of coverage.Â  Heaitley, 320 S.C. \r\n  at 469-70, 465 S.E.2d at 765.Â  \r\nIn Medical Park OB/GYN, \r\n  P.A. v. Ragin, 321 S.C. 139, 467 S.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1996), a physicianâ€™s \r\n  office relied upon the faulty representations of Ragin in the creation of an \r\n  employee benefit plan.Â  Because Ragin failed to inform Medical Park regarding \r\n  mandatory contributions to the plan, the plan was severely underfunded and Medical \r\n  Park was subject to substantial legal liability.Â  Medical Park sued Ragin for \r\n  negligent misrepresentation, breach of fiduciary duty, and professional negligence.Â  \r\n  Noting the purpose of ERISA was to protect the interest of participants in employee \r\n  benefit plans, this court held that the â€œrelationship between Medical Parksâ€™ \r\n  claims and the regulation or administration of an ERISA plan is too tenuous, \r\n  remote, or peripheral to trigger pre-emption.â€Â  Medical Park, 321 S.C. \r\n  at 145, 467 S.E.2d at 264-65.Â  Because adjudication of Medical Parkâ€™s state \r\n  law claims would not â€œaffect the rights of any plan participants or beneficiaries \r\n  and [would] not threaten the uniform regulation or administration of employee \r\n  benefit plans,â€ this court held the state law claims did not fall within ERISAâ€™s \r\n  preemptive scope.Â  Id. at 146, 467 S.E.2d at 265.Â Â Â  \r\nThe United States Court \r\n  of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit has also decided that state law claims for \r\n  professional malpractice were not preempted by ERISA.Â  In Coyne &amp; Delany \r\n  Co. v. Selman, 98 F.3d 1457 (4th Cir. 1996), the Fourth Circuit considered \r\n  whether an employerâ€™s professional malpractice claim it brought against an insurance \r\n  agent was preempted by ERISA.Â  In that case, as in the present case, the employer \r\n  alleged it had been fraudulently induced by the insurance agent to purchase \r\n  group health insurance for its employees.Â  Id. at 1463-64.Â  The Fourth \r\n  Circuit held that fraudulent inducement claims against insurance agents were \r\n  not preempted, finding that:\r\n\r\n  \r\nWe believe that [plaintiffâ€™s] malpractice claim against\r\ninsurance professionals is a â€œtraditional state-based law[ ] of general\r\napplicability [that does not] implicate the relations among the traditional\r\nERISA plan entities,â€ including the principals, the employer, the plan, the\r\nplan fiduciaries and the beneficiaries.&nbsp; There is no question that\r\n[plaintiffâ€™s] malpractice claim is rooted in a field of traditional state\r\nregulation.&nbsp; Common law professional malpractice, along with other forms of\r\ntort liability, has historically been a state concern. Moreover, a common law\r\nprofessional malpractice claim is â€œa generally applicable [law] that makes no\r\nreference to, or functions irrespective of, the existence of an ERISA plan.â€&nbsp;\r\nThe state law at issue in this case imposes a duty of care on all professionals,\r\nincluding all insurance professionals. Common law imposes the duty of care\r\nregardless of whether the malpractice involves an ERISA plan or a\r\nrun-of-the-mill automobile insurance policy. Thus, the duty of care does not\r\ndepend on ERISA in any way. Finally, the state law malpractice claim does not\r\naffect relations among the principal ERISA entities.&nbsp; Defendantsâ€™\r\nmalpractice, if any, occurred before the faulty plan went into effect and before\r\ndefendants began to act as Plan Administrator and Plan Supervisor. Accordingly,\r\nthe claim is asserted by [plaintiff], in its capacity as employer, against the\r\ndefendants in their capacities as insurance professionals, not in their\r\ncapacities as ERISA fiduciaries.\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. at 1471 (internal citations \r\n  omitted).\r\nTurning to the instant \r\n  case, we similarly find the state law claims are not preempted by ERISA.Â  Respondents \r\n  brought claims of misrepresentation, fraud, and negligence against Requa.Â  Respondents \r\n  sought damages from Requa for his professional malpractice in failing to adequately \r\n  investigate the Fidelity plan and in failing to inform them when it became evident \r\n  that the Fidelity plan had problems.Â  The malpractice claims are rooted in the \r\n  common law of tort liability.Â  Like the malpractice claims in Heaitley \r\n  and Medical Park, these common law claims do not impactâ€”even in a tenuous \r\n  fashionâ€”employee benefit structures or their administration, bind employers \r\n  or plan administrators to particular choices, or preclude uniform administrative \r\n  practice.\r\nFurthermore, Respondentsâ€™ \r\n  claims are not aimed at obtaining ERISA benefits.Â  Rather, they brought this \r\n  action seeking damages proximately caused by Requaâ€™s misrepresentations in marketing \r\n  the Fidelity Plan and his negligent failure to apprise Respondents of the Planâ€™s \r\n  financial and regulatory difficulties.Â  If Respondents prevail on their claims, \r\n  Requa will be liable in his individual capacity for his negligence as an insurance \r\n  professional.Â  Thus, the connection between the state law claims and the employee \r\n  benefit plan is so tenuous such that ERISA does not preempt them.Â  \r\nFor these reasons, we \r\n  cannot say that the common law tort action at issue in this case â€œrelate[s] \r\n  to any employee benefit planâ€ within the meaning of 29 U.S.C. Â§ 1144(a).Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find there was evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s denial of Requaâ€™s motions \r\n  for directed verdict and JNOV. [3] \r\n  Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Contested Evidentiary Rulings\r\nRequa next appeals several of \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s rulings on evidentiary matters raised at trial.Â  We address \r\n  each of these issues separately below.\r\nThe decision to admit or exclude \r\n  evidence is within the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion.Â  Washington v. Whitaker, \r\n  317 S.C. 108, 118, 451 S.E.2d 894, 900 (1994); Haselden v. Davis, 341 \r\n  S.C. 486, 497, 534 S.E.2d 295, 301 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The judgeâ€™s ruling to admit \r\n  or exclude evidence will only be reversed if it constitutes an abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to an error of law.Â  Carlyle v. Tuomey Hosp., 305 S.C. 187, \r\n  192, 407 S.E.2d 630, 633 (1991).Â  To warrant reversal, however, Requa â€œmust \r\n  show both the error of the ruling and the resulting prejudice.â€Â  Recco Tape \r\n  &amp; Label Co. v. Barfield, 312 S.C. 214, 216, 439 S.E.2d 838, 840 (1994).\r\n\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Admission of Evidence as to Unpaid Medical Bills\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and Premiums Paid \r\n  \r\n\r\nRequa argues the trial \r\n  court erred by admitting evidence of the amount of premiums paid and unpaid \r\n  medical bills for Holroyd and other employees enrolled in the Plan.Â  He essentially \r\n  argues that the jury should not have considered evidence of the total amount \r\n  of premiums paid by American AVK on behalf of all of its employees when the \r\n  only employee joined in the lawsuit was Holroyd.Â  We find no error.\r\nAt the start of the \r\n  trial, Requa moved to exclude evidence of the amount of premiums paid and the \r\n  amount of the unpaid claims under the Fidelity plan, arguing the evidence of \r\n  both amounted to a claim for recission and would be confusing to the jury.Â  \r\n  The trial court denied the motion.Â  However, Requa himself testified during \r\n  the trial that the Holroyds had $65,000 in unpaid medical bills and that $15,000 \r\n  in premiums had been paid to Fidelity.Â  Requa later withdrew his objection to \r\n  the presentation of the medical bills.Â  The Holroyds testified, without objection, \r\n  regarding the receipt and amount of unpaid medical bills.Â  Although Requa moved \r\n  for directed verdict at the end of Respondentsâ€™ case, he argued the evidence \r\n  of both the premiums and unpaid medical bills was not the proper measure of \r\n  damages.Â Â Â  \r\nRequa also argued in his post-trial \r\n  motion to alter or amend the judgment that the evidence of both medical bills \r\n  and the premiums paid was not proper measures of damages, was irrelevant, or, \r\n  if relevant, was more prejudicial than probative.Â  The trial court ruled that \r\n  both the medical bills and the premiums paid were appropriate to be submitted \r\n  on Respondentsâ€™ claims.Â  The court further noted that even if the jury inappropriately \r\n  considered the total amount of premiums paid, it was impossible to determine \r\n  that fact as the jury returned a general verdict. \r\nThere are preservation problems \r\n  with Requaâ€™s issue on appeal.Â  Although Requa opposed the introduction of the \r\n  evidence of medical bills and premiums paid before the testimony, after the \r\n  testimony, and in a post-trial motion, he did not object when the evidence was \r\n  actually introduced during the trial.Â  In fact, the evidence that Requa complains \r\n  about in this appeal was also elicited from his own testimony without objection.Â  \r\n  Failure to object to the introduction of evidence at the time the evidence is \r\n  offered constitutes a waiver of the right to have the issue considered on appeal.Â  \r\n  See Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. 352, 356, 488 S.E.2d 878, 880 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997) (holding that a contemporaneous objection is â€œrequired to properly \r\n  preserve an error for appellate reviewâ€); Cogdill v. Watson, 289 S.C. \r\n  531, 537, 347 S.E.2d 126, 130 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œThe failure to make an objection \r\n  at the time evidence is offered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.â€).Â  \r\n  Because Requa failed to object at the time the evidence was introduced, we do \r\n  not believe this issue is preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n\r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Requaâ€™s Request to Cross-examine Respondents Regarding \r\n  Allegations Made in the Original Complaint\r\n\r\nRequa next argues the \r\n  trial court erred by not allowing him to cross-examine Respondents regarding \r\n  a statement in their original complaint.Â  \r\nOne of the contested \r\n  issues at trial was whether Requa informed American AVK that there were problems \r\n  with Fidelity.Â  Respondentsâ€™ original complaint stated that they had received \r\n  a letter from Requa in May 1998 informing them that their â€œhealth insurer, the \r\n  Fidelity Group, has some serious problems and that it may be time to move to \r\n  another more competent carrier.â€Â  Respondents filed an amended complaint which \r\n  did not include the assertion that Requa wrote them to inform them of the problems \r\n  with Fidelity.Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Requa sought \r\n  to cross-examine Holroyd about the assertion in the original complaint.Â  Respondents \r\n  objected, claiming the statement was inadvertently copied from a complaint filed \r\n  in a separate action.Â  The trial court concluded the statement in the original \r\n  complaint was the result of a scrivenerâ€™s error and its inadvertent inclusion \r\n  in the original complaint should not be allowed to prejudice Respondents.Â Â  \r\n  We find no error.\r\nOur courts have corrected \r\n  scrivenersâ€™ errors when warranted.Â  See Canal Ins. Co. v. Caldwell, \r\n  338 S.C. 1, 7, 524 S.E.2d 416, 419 (Ct. App. 1999) (finding that a party was \r\n  not bound by a scrivenerâ€™s error regarding commencement time on insurance policy).Â  \r\n  In this case, Requa understood the statement had been culled from another complaint \r\n  and acknowledged this at trial.Â  Furthermore, Requa did not object when Respondents \r\n  amended their complaint to delete the statement.Â  Because there was evidence \r\n  to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling on this matter, the judge did not err in \r\n  denying Requaâ€™s motion for a new trial as to this issue.Â  \r\n\r\nC. Â Â Â Â  Unpaid Medical \r\n  Bills of Others\r\n\r\nDuring cross-examination, \r\n  Requa admitted that his policyholders have â€œa million dollars in unpaid claims.â€Â  \r\n  Requaâ€™s counsel objected, a bench conference was held, and Requaâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  continued.Â  During closing arguments, Respondentsâ€™ counsel argued that â€œthereâ€™s \r\n  a million dollars in unpaid claims on Requa . . . .â€Â  Requaâ€™s general objection \r\n  was sustained.Â  However, without objection from Requa, the trial court had Requaâ€™s \r\n  testimony regarding his policyholdersâ€™ unpaid claims read to the jury prior \r\n  to deliberations. \r\nRequa failed to place \r\n  the grounds for his first objection on the record, failed to request a curative \r\n  instruction when the testimony was referred to during closing arguments, and \r\n  failed to object when the trial court ordered the testimony read to the jury.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  Wilder Corp. \r\n  v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (holding that an objection \r\n  must be sufficiently specific to inform the trial court of the point being urged \r\n  by the objector); State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 18, 482 S.E.2d 760, \r\n  766 (1997) (holding that where a party objects to closing arguments and the \r\n  objection is sustained, but counsel did not move to strike or request a curative \r\n  instruction, the issue is not preserved for appellate review); see also \r\n  Murray v. Bank of America, 354 S.C. 337, 347, 580 S.E.2d 194, 200 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (same); Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. at 356, 488 S.E.2d at 880 \r\n  (holding that a contemporaneous objection is â€œrequired to properly preserve \r\n  an error for appellate reviewâ€).\r\n\r\nD.Â Â Â Â Â  Evidence of Damage to Respondentsâ€™ Credit Rating\r\n\r\nRequa next argues the trial court \r\n  erred by allowing testimony regarding damage to the Holroydsâ€™ credit rating.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRequa testified at trial \r\n  that unpaid medical bills could affect the Holroydsâ€™ credit rating.Â  Without \r\n  objection, Gillian Holroyd testified that because Holroydâ€™s medical bills remained \r\n  unpaid, they feared losing their home, and they were receiving distressing telephone \r\n  calls from creditors.Â  No evidence was admitted regarding the Holroydsâ€™ credit \r\n  rating or any changes to the rating.Â  \r\nIn his motion for a new trial, \r\n  Requa complained about Gillian Holroydâ€™s testimony, arguing he was denied access \r\n  to the Holroydsâ€™ credit reports prior to trial.Â  In denying the motion for a \r\n  new trial on this issue, the trial court found Gillianâ€™s testimony was cumulative \r\n  to Requaâ€™s own testimony and that Requa had failed to argue anything regarding \r\n  denial of access to credit reports before the motion for a new trial. \r\nWe first note that the evidence \r\n  submitted on this issue, without objection, only indicated that the Holroyds \r\n  had outstanding bills and were receiving distressing telephone calls from creditors.Â  \r\n  There was no evidence with regard to the credit ratings of the Respondents.Â  \r\n  In his argument in support of this issue, Requa even admits that no evidence \r\n  was submitted with regard to Gillian Holroydâ€™s or American AVKâ€™s credit ratings.Â  \r\n  Because no evidence of credit ratings was admitted at trial, Requaâ€™s argument \r\n  has no merit.Â  \r\nFurther, Gillian Holroydâ€™s testimony \r\n  was cumulative to Requaâ€™s testimony, and the evidence regarding the distressing \r\n  phone calls was admitted without objection.Â  As such, the issue is not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.Â  Doe v. S.B.M., 327 S.C. at 356, 488 S.E.2d at \r\n  880.Â Â  \r\nBecause there is evidence \r\n  to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling, we find no error with the denial of the \r\n  new trial motion based on the credit rating â€œevidence.â€Â  \r\n\r\nE.Â Â Â Â Â  Evidence of Future \r\n  Damages\r\n\r\nRequa next argues that the trial \r\n  court erred by admitting evidence of future damages in the form of increased \r\n  premiums for health insurance Holroyd will be forced to pay, allegedly due to \r\n  the Fidelity Planâ€™s failure to pay Holroydâ€™s legitimate medical expense claims.Â  \r\n  We find no error.\r\nâ€œUnder current South Carolina \r\n  law, the standard of admissibility for evidence of future damages is â€˜any evidence \r\n  which tends to establish the nature, character, and extent of injuries which \r\n  are the natural and proximate consequences of the defendantâ€™s acts . . . if \r\n  otherwise competent.â€™â€ Pearson v. Bridges, 344 S.C. 366, 372, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  617, 620 (2001) (quoting Martin v. Mobley, 253 S.C. 103, 109, 169 S.E.2d \r\n  278, 281-82 (1969)).\r\nDuring Requaâ€™s testimony, he \r\n  admitted that Holroydâ€™s premiums would increase substantially due to his heart \r\n  attack.Â  Without objection, Holroydâ€™s expert, John Oâ€™Brien, testified that Holroyd \r\n  would have a difficult time getting health insurance and he would be plagued \r\n  with â€œheftyâ€ premiums because his heart condition would be considered a preexisting \r\n  condition. \r\nRespondents offered expert testimony \r\n  that Holroydâ€™s heart condition will be considered a preexisting condition when \r\n  he signs on with a new insurance carrier.Â  Because of the preexisting condition, \r\n  he will be required to pay a much higher rate for insurance coverage than he \r\n  had in the past.Â  Had the Fidelity Plan honored its commitment to pay the legitimate \r\n  medical claims of its enrollees, the need for Holroyd to obtain new coverage \r\n  would not have arisen.Â  Instead, Holroyd was left without coverage and in the \r\n  market for a new insurer at the time he was recovering from a catastrophic illness.Â  \r\n  If, as the jury found, Requa was negligent in his failure to investigate the \r\n  adequacy of the Fidelity Plan and had represented the Plan accurately when marketing \r\n  it to American AVK, the Holroyds may have never been subject to paying the higher \r\n  premiums the expert projected.Â  Allowing the jury to consider evidence of future \r\n  damages is, therefore, wholly appropriate.\r\n\r\nF.Â Â Â Â Â  Use of Mortality Tables \r\n  in Assessing Future Damages\r\n\r\nRequa also argues the trial court \r\n  erred in charging the jury on the mortality tables to quantify Holroydâ€™s future \r\n  damages.Â  Here, too, we find no error.\r\nThe trial court must \r\n  charge the current and correct law applicable to issues raised in the pleadings \r\n  and supported by the evidence.Â  Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 390, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).Â  When reviewing a jury instruction for error, this \r\n  court must consider the charge â€œâ€˜as a whole in light of the evidence and issues \r\n  presented at trial.â€™â€Â  Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 497, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575 (1999).Â  \r\nThe Legislature has \r\n  provided life expectancy tables to be considered when it is necessary in civil \r\n  actions to determine the life expectancy of any person.Â  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 19-1-150 (1985) (â€œWhen it is necessary, in any civil action or other \r\n  mode of litigation, to establish the life expectancy of any person from any \r\n  period in his life, whether he be living at the time or not, the table below \r\n  shall be received in all courts and by all persons having power to determine \r\n  litigation as evidence (along with other evidence as to his health, constitution \r\n  and habits) of the life expectancy of such person.â€). \r\n  [4] \r\nDuring the charge conference, \r\n  the parties debated whether the mortality tables should be charged to the jury.Â  \r\n  Requa argued that under ERISA, Holroyd would have â€œcredible coverage that would \r\n  have extended to any future coverageâ€ such that future damages, and the mortality \r\n  tables, were not an issue.Â  Noting there was evidence in the record regarding \r\n  future damages in the form of increased premiums, the trial court decided to \r\n  give the charge concerning the mortality tables.Â  The jury was instructed as \r\n  follows:\r\n\r\nNow, at this time, Mr. Holroyd \r\n  is 52 years of age.Â  We have in this state a statute that has been established \r\n  by way of actuarial study that states what oneâ€™s life expectancy should be at \r\n  a certain age.Â  This is allowed into evidence at a trial.Â  At this age, 52, \r\n  Mr. Holroyd, has a life expectancy of 23.7 years.Â  In determining how long one \r\n  would live, you may consider life expectancy.Â  You may also consider other evidence \r\n  in the case which bears on his health, age, physical condition, or any other \r\n  factors that you deem appropriate in determining whether or not you would â€“ \r\n  in determining how you would use that life expectancy.Â  \r\nYou would not use that life expectancy \r\n  at all unless you determined that Mr. Holroyd would have some damages in the \r\n  future.Â  That has nothing to do with what has happened, has only to do with \r\n  what may happen in the future.\r\n\r\nRequa informed the trial court \r\n  that he had no objections to the instructions.Â  In his post-trial motions, however, \r\n  Requa argued that charging the mortality tables was error because any increase \r\n  in premiums was due to the heart attack, not Requaâ€™s actions and the future \r\n  damages were in contravention of federal law.Â  The trial court denied the motion, \r\n  finding there was evidence to support the charge and Requa failed to object \r\n  after the instruction was given.Â Â  \r\nEven assuming Requa \r\n  properly preserved this argument for appellate review, we find no error with \r\n  the instruction.Â  There was evidence that Holroyd would suffer future damages \r\n  due to increased premiums.Â  The jury could properly consider the mortality tables \r\n  to determine the amount of future damages.Â  Because there was evidence to support \r\n  the charge, the trial court correctly instructed the jury with regard to the \r\n  mortality tables.Â  The trial court did not err in denying Requaâ€™s post-trial \r\n  motion with regard to this issue.Â  \r\nIV.Â Â Â  Change of Venue\r\nRequa next argues the trial court \r\n  erred by failing to grant his motion for change of venue.Â  We disagree.Â  â€œA \r\n  motion for a change of venue is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge and will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50, 67, 502 S.E.2d 63, 71 (1998).\r\nThis action was filed \r\n  in Charleston County in January 1999.Â  Requa did not assert the defense of improper \r\n  venue in his pleadings, and he did not file his motion for change of venue until \r\n  April 2000.Â  The matter did not ultimately come before the trial court for hearing \r\n  until February 2001, at which time the case had already been placed on the trial \r\n  roster and was subject to being called for trial at any time.Â  Moreover, there \r\n  is evidence that most of the discovery had been completed prior to the hearing.\r\nRequa points out that \r\n  the right of a defendant to be tried in the county of his residence is a substantial \r\n  right and argues he did not waive that right.Â  A defense of improper venue may \r\n  be waived if not made by motion under Rule 12, SCRCP, or raised as an affirmative \r\n  defense in a responsive pleading.Â  Henley v. North Trident Regâ€™l Hosp., \r\n  275 S.C. 193, 195, 269 S.E.2d 328, 328 (1980) (holding that the right to be \r\n  tried in the county of oneâ€™s residence, â€œwhile it is a â€˜substantial and valuable \r\n  right,â€™ . . . relates only to the question of venue and can be waivedâ€).\r\nIn Henley, our \r\n  supreme court held that the defendantâ€™s failure to challenge venue until five \r\n  months after the complaint had been filed was unreasonable, and he had therefore \r\n  waived his right to be tried in the county of his residence.Â  We find the same \r\n  result is warranted in the present case where the delay continued for many more \r\n  months and was not pursued with the trial court until the case was nearing trial.\r\nAccordingly, we find \r\n  the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Requaâ€™s motion for change \r\n  of venue.\r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Damages\r\nRequa next argues the \r\n  trial court erred in failing to grant his motion for a new trial or, in the \r\n  alternative, a new trial nisi remittitur on the grounds the damages awarded \r\n  by the jury were grossly disproportionate to the evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œWhen a party moves \r\n  for a new trial based on a challenge that the verdict is either excessive or \r\n  inadequate, the trial judge must distinguish between awards that are merely \r\n  unduly liberal or conservative and awards that are actuated by passion, caprice \r\n  or prejudice.â€Â  Allstate Ins. Co. v. Durham, 314 S.C. 529, 530, 431 S.E.2d \r\n  557, 558 (1993).Â  The trial court must set aside a verdict only when it is shockingly \r\n  disproportionate to the injuries suffered and thus indicates that passion, caprice, \r\n  prejudice, or other considerations not reflected by the evidence affected the \r\n  amount awarded.Â  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 404, 477 S.E.2d at 723.Â  In other \r\n  words, to warrant a new trial absolute, the verdict reached must be so â€œgrossly \r\n  excessiveâ€ as to clearly indicate the influence of an improper motive on the \r\n  jury.Â  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 379-80, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).Â  \r\n  Although the decision to grant or deny a new trial absolute based on the excessiveness \r\n  of a verdict rests in the sound discretion of the trial court, an abuse of discretion \r\n  occurs if the trial courtâ€™s findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence \r\n  or the conclusions reached are controlled by an error of law.Â  Krepps v. \r\n  Ausen, 324 S.C. 597, 607, 479 S.E.2d 290, 295 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nRequa first claims the \r\n  juryâ€™s award of $365,000 in actual damages is unsupported by the evidence because \r\n  Respondents only presented evidence of $65,000 in unpaid medical bills. Â The \r\n  evidence offered by Respondents not only included unpaid medical bills, but \r\n  also included embarrassment, humiliation, credit problems, increased future \r\n  insurance premiums, stress, premiums paid, and decreased coverage due to preexisting \r\n  conditions in a new policy.Â  We find no reason, therefore, to disturb the juryâ€™s \r\n  verdict.\r\nWith respect to punitive \r\n  damages, Requa argues the juryâ€™s award of $180,000 was clearly motivated by \r\n  passion, caprice, and prejudice.Â  Here, too, we see no reason to disturb the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s finding that the punitive damages award was supported by and not \r\n  disproportionate to the evidence.Â  The trial court separately listed and addressed \r\n  the eight factors required in a post-trial review of punitive damages awards \r\n  under our Supreme Courtâ€™s ruling in Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104, \r\n  406 S.E.2d 350 (1991).Â  Requaâ€™s culpability, knowledge, and ability to pay are \r\n  amply supported by the evidence contained in the record.Â  \r\nIn light of all the evidence \r\n  presented, we find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding the \r\n  actual and punitive damages were not disproportionate to the evidence.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated \r\n  above, we find: that the Respondentsâ€™ claims were not preempted by federal ERISA \r\n  laws; that the trial court correctly ruled on Requaâ€™s evidentiary objections; \r\n  that Requaâ€™s motion for a change of venue was correctly denied; and that the \r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Requaâ€™s motions for new \r\n  trial.Â  The judgment of the trial court is therefore\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n&nbsp;HUFF and STILWELL, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Testimony from Respondentsâ€™ witnesses indicated that the entities \r\n    were not true employer or employee organizations under ERISA.Â Â  However, the \r\n    trial court did not make specific findings in this regard, and it is not necessary \r\n    to our decision in this case.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  A.M. Best Company rates insurance companies based on their financial \r\n    ability to meet their ongoing obligations.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Â We also note that Requa admits in his brief that it was his burden \r\n    to prove the existence of a recognized ERISA plan before the trial court could \r\n    determine whether state law claims were preempted.Â  He also admits that the \r\n    fact of whether the Fidelity plan was an ERISA plan was â€œa question of fact \r\n    that has yet to be determined.â€Â  Requaâ€™s admitted failure to provide any evidence \r\n    at trial that the plan was an ERISA plan is an additional ground supporting \r\n    the trial courtâ€™s decision to deny his motions for directed verdict and JNOV.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  This statute was amended in April 2004.Â  The amendment \r\n    has no effect on the issue in this case.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3853","title":"McClain v.

McClain appeals the \r\n  dismissal of his causes of action against Pactiv Corporation and Joseph P. Berley.Â  \r\n  He argues the trial court erred in (1) ruling his intentional infliction of \r\n  emotional distress claim was barred by the exclusivity provision of the South \r\n  Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act and (2) concluding his remaining claimsâ€”civil \r\n  conspiracy, false arrest, abuse of legal process, and invasion of privacyâ€”were \r\n  barred by the doctrine of collateral estoppel.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in \r\n  part, and remand. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nThis case arises from McClainâ€™s allegations \r\n  that his former employer, Pactiv, and fellow employees conspired with each other \r\n  and with law enforcement to have him arrested and involuntarily committed after \r\n  he spoke in favor of a union at a plant meeting regarding an ongoing unionization \r\n  campaign.Â  At the meeting, Pactivâ€™s plant manager, Joseph R. Garrison, Jr., \r\n  spoke against labor unions and McClain suggested the union be allowed to speak \r\n  to the workers.Â  \r\nMcClain alleges that in the days following \r\n  the meeting, Pactivâ€™s director of occupational health, Dr. Joseph Berley, called \r\n  McClainâ€™s former psychiatrist; told him McClain had made threatening statements \r\n  to employees who did not support the union; â€œpassed along lies, rumors, gossip, \r\n  and innuendoâ€; and asked about how to get McClain committed.Â  Also, Pactiv employees \r\n  including Robin Montgomery, Pactivâ€™s head of corporate security, met with officers \r\n  from the local sheriffâ€™s department.Â  McClain asserts the employees also related \r\n  false and unsubstantiated statements to the officers.Â  According to Garrison, \r\n  they were alerting the officers of safety concerns raised by several employees \r\n  involving McClain.Â  After the meeting, sheriffâ€™s officers discovered an outstanding \r\n  warrant against McClain, stopped him on his way to work, and took him into custody.Â  \r\n\r\nAfter arresting McClain, officers took him to a \r\n  hospital.Â  McClain was then involuntarily committed to a mental health facility.Â  \r\n  McClain claims that while he was committed, Berley reported false information \r\n  to McClainâ€™s treating psychiatrist for the purpose of prolonging his commitment.Â  \r\n\r\nFollowing McClainâ€™s commitment, a probate court \r\n  found him mentally ill and ordered him to undergo an outpatient treatment program.Â  \r\n  McClain asserts Berley also attempted to affect the outcome of the proceeding \r\n  by sending a fax to McClainâ€™s physician at the mental facility.Â  \r\nMcClain first brought suit in federal court against \r\n  Pactiv, Berley, other Pactiv employees, and members of the Aiken County Sheriffâ€™s \r\n  Department.Â  His complaint asserted causes of action under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 \r\n  and several state law claims including civil conspiracy, false arrest, defamation, \r\n  abuse of legal process, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional \r\n  distress.Â  Both the Pactiv defendants and the law enforcement defendants were \r\n  granted summary judgment.Â  The district court found McClain presented no evidence \r\n  the law enforcement officers acted improperly or violated his constitutional \r\n  rights.Â  As to the Pactiv employees, the court found there was no evidence linking \r\n  them to a conspiracy involving the alleged constitutional violations.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the court held McClain â€œhas not been able to produce any affidavit, deposition, \r\n  or other form of evidence to support his theory that the Pactiv Individuals \r\n  were involved in the decision to arrest or commit him.â€Â  \r\nHaving granted summary judgment on the federal \r\n  actions, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over McClainâ€™s remaining \r\n  state law claims and dismissed them without prejudice. Â On appeal, the \r\n  Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nThereafter, McClain filed this action.Â  The trial court dismissed \r\n  several defendants and causes of action that are not subjects of this appeal.Â  \r\n  The order on appeal dismissed the remaining claims against Pactiv and Berley \r\n  and thus ended the action.Â  The court agreed with Pactiv that the intentional \r\n  infliction of emotional distress claim was barred by the exclusivity provision \r\n  of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  The court also found McClainâ€™s claims for \r\n  civil conspiracy, false arrest, abuse of legal process, and invasion of privacy \r\n  were barred by collateral estoppel because of the order in the federal action.Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Intentional \r\n  Infliction of Emotional Distress\r\nMcClain argues the trial court erred in ruling \r\n  his claim for intentional infliction of emotional distress was barred by the \r\n  exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe rights and remedies of an injured worker under \r\n  the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act constitute the workerâ€™s exclusive remedies against \r\n  the employer.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985).Â  Our supreme court has held \r\n  the intentional infliction of emotional distress constitutes a personal injury \r\n  that falls within the scope of the act.Â  Loges v. Mack Trucks, Inc., \r\n  308 S.C. 134, 137, 417 S.E.2d 538, 540 (1992).Â  The court later affirmed and \r\n  clarified this holding by stating: â€œIt is only when the tortfeasor/co-employee \r\n  is the â€˜alter egoâ€™ of the employer that the liability falls outside the scope \r\n  of the Act.â€Â  Dickert v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 311 S.C. 218, 220, \r\n  428 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1993).Â  The alter ego exception applies only to â€œâ€˜dominant \r\n  corporate owners and officers.â€™â€Â  Id. at 221, 428 S.E.2d at 701 (quoting \r\n  2A Larson, Workmenâ€™s Compensation, Â§Â§ 68.21 and 68.22).Â  McClain argues \r\n  Montgomery and Berley are alter egos of Pactiv and thus the claim is not governed \r\n  by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.Â  Nothing in the record before us suggests \r\n  either Montgomery or Berley is a dominant corporate owner or officer.Â  We therefore \r\n  reject McClainâ€™s argument that the alter ego exception applies to this case \r\n  and hold the trial court correctly dismissed this cause of action as barred \r\n  by the exclusivity provision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act.\r\nII.Â  Collateral \r\n  Estoppel\r\nMcClain also argues the trial court erred in ruling \r\n  his remaining claims were barred by collateral estoppel.Â  As to the false arrest, \r\n  abuse of legal process, and invasion of privacy claims, we agree.Â  As to the \r\n  civil conspiracy claim, we affirm the dismissal on a different ground.\r\nThe doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, \r\n  serves to prevent a party from relitigating in a subsequent action an issue \r\n  actually and necessarily litigated and determined in a prior action.Â  Shelton \r\n  v. Oscar Mayer Foods Corp., 325 S.C. 248, 251, 481 S.E.2d 706, 707 (1997).Â  \r\n  In the current action, the trial court found all of McClainâ€™s remaining claims \r\n  barred by the district courtâ€™s ruling.Â  In reaching this conclusion, the trial \r\n  court relied on the following portion of the district courtâ€™s order:\r\n\r\n[McClain] alleges that the Pactiv Individuals not only conspired \r\n  with the Sheriff to have [McClain] picked up by deputies, but that they also \r\n  conspired to place [McClain] in a mental health facility against his will in \r\n  order to squelch his pro-union activity.Â  However, [McClain] has not been able \r\n  to produce any affidavit, deposition or other form of evidence to support \r\n  his theory that the Pactiv Individuals were involved in the decision to arrest \r\n  or commit him.Â  Moreover, Sheriff Sellers and Officer Rowland have submitted \r\n  sworn affidavits in which they declare that the Pactiv Individuals did nothing \r\n  more than ask for extra security at a personnel meeting and were not involved \r\n  with the decision to serve the 1995 arrest warrant or to commit [McClain].\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)\r\nThis passage of the district courtâ€™s order was \r\n  part of its decision that there was no link between the Pactiv employees and \r\n  the alleged violations of McClainâ€™s constitutional rights.Â  That is, the court \r\n  found no evidence the Pactiv employees were acting under color of state law.Â  \r\n  Because the district court dismissed McClainâ€™s federal actions, it specifically \r\n  declined to exercise jurisdiction over his state law claims.Â  Nothing in the \r\n  district courtâ€™s order can be construed as a conclusive determination of the \r\n  issues in McClainâ€™s false arrest, abuse of legal process, or invasion of privacy \r\n  claims.Â  \r\nMcClain argues his civil conspiracy action is also not barred \r\n  by the district courtâ€™s order.Â  He notes that in addition to a conspiracy between \r\n  law enforcement and Pactiv employees, he also asserted in his complaint that \r\n  Pactiv and its employees conspired with each other, a matter not decided in \r\n  any fashion by the district courtâ€™s order.Â  However, McClainâ€™s conspiracy claim \r\n  cannot survive on this theory, as the law is clear that a corporation cannot \r\n  conspire with itself.Â  Anderson v. S. Ry. Co., 224 S.C. 65, 69, 77 S.E.2d \r\n  350, 351 (1953) (holding conspiracy cause of action could not be sustained after \r\n  involuntary nonsuit and jury verdict left corporation as the only remaining \r\n  defendant because a corporation cannot conspire with itself); Goble v. Am. \r\n  Ry. Express Co, 124 S.C. 19, 27-28, 115 S.E 900, 903 (1923) (ruling although \r\n  a corporationâ€™s agents may render the corporation liable for torts committed \r\n  in the scope of their employment, an agent or multiple agents may not render \r\n  the corporation liable for a civil conspiracy involving only corporate agents); \r\n  16 Am. Jur. 2d Conspiracy Â§ 56 (1998) (noting because a corporation cannot \r\n  conspire with itself, a civil conspiracy is not possible where the co-conspirators \r\n  are employer and employee or principal and agent).Â  \r\nWe therefore affirm the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal \r\n  of McClainâ€™s intentional infliction of emotional distress cause of action and \r\n  his cause of action for civil conspiracy, but reverse the dismissal of his state \r\n  law causes of action for false arrest, abuse of legal process, and invasion \r\n  of privacy, and remand these claims to the circuit court.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3854","title":"State v.

Hagler, of \r\n  Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney \r\n  General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson \r\n  and Senior Assistant Attorney General Norman Mark Rapoport, all of Columbia; \r\n  Solicitor Donald V. Myers and Assistant Solicitor C. Dayton Riddle, both of \r\n  Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Heyward Leon Rogers was convicted \r\n  of two counts of first degree criminal sexual conduct, assault and battery with \r\n  intent to kill, kidnapping, and strong arm robbery.Â  On appeal, Rogers argues \r\n  the court erred by (1) allowing the solicitor to ask leading questions during \r\n  the deaf victimâ€™s direct examination, (2) allowing the victimâ€™s son to serve \r\n  as her interpreter during cross-examination, (3) failing to grant Rogersâ€™ motion \r\n  for a mistrial after learning that six jurors were exposed to a newspaper article \r\n  about the trial, (4) admitting a purse into evidence before the victim identified \r\n  it, (5) admitting fingerprint results into evidence, and (6) sentencing him \r\n  to life without parole when his last conviction for a most serious crime was \r\n  nineteen years prior to this conviction.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn the evening of September 28, \r\n  2002, the victim left a fast food restaurant in West Columbia and was walking \r\n  toward a video poker parlor when a man pushed her to the ground and raped her.Â  \r\n  The victim fought back and eventually caused her perpetrator to flee by throwing \r\n  sand in his eyes.Â  When the perpetrator fled, he took with him the victimâ€™s \r\n  purse and her newly purchased food.Â Â  A police officer on patrol found the victim \r\n  shaking and crying on the side of the road, and he called an ambulance.Â  The \r\n  victim was transported to the hospital where a rape protocol kit was prepared.Â  \r\n  A week later, the victim helped the police draw a composite sketch of her assailant, \r\n  which was used to arrest Rogers.Â  \r\nThe victim, who was fifty-seven years old at the time \r\n  of the attack, has been deaf since the age of eight.Â  As a result, her speech \r\n  is difficult to understand, and she communicates through some vocalization combined \r\n  with gestures.Â  Because of this unique system of communication, both the solicitor \r\n  and Rogersâ€™ counsel had problems eliciting testimony from the victim at trial.Â  \r\n  To cope with the problems, the trial court allowed the extensive use of leading \r\n  questions during the victimâ€™s direct examination.Â  During cross-examination, \r\n  however, leading questions alone did not facilitate communication between the \r\n  victim and defense counsel.Â  Thus, the court found it necessary to allow the \r\n  victimâ€™s son to serve as an interpreter. \r\nRogers was convicted on all charges and sentenced \r\n  concurrently to fifteen years for robbery and four sentences of life without \r\n  possibility of parole for the other charges.Â  We affirm.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn criminal cases, the appellate court sits to \r\n  review errors of law only. We are bound by the trial courtâ€™s factual findings \r\n  unless they are clearly erroneous.â€Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 5-6, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 827, 829&nbsp;(2001) (citation omitted).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRogers raises \r\n  six issues on appeal:Â  (1) the failure to appoint an interpreter during the \r\n  victimâ€™s direct-examination; (2) the use of the victimâ€™s son as an interpreter \r\n  during the victimâ€™s cross-examination; (3) the denial of a motion for new trial \r\n  after discovering jury misconduct; (4) the admission of the victimâ€™s purse into \r\n  evidence; (5) the admission of fingerprint evidence; and (6) the propriety of \r\n  a life without parole sentence. \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victimâ€™s direct examination. \r\n   \r\n\r\nRogers first argues the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to supply an interpreter for the victim during direct \r\n  examination.Â  We find this issue is not preserved for our review. Â \r\nBecause of the victimâ€™s communication \r\n  problems, the trial court allowed the solicitor to use leading questions.Â  Defense \r\n  counsel repeatedly objected to the use of leading questions; however, counsel \r\n  never objected to the courtâ€™s failure to appoint an interpreter, nor did counsel \r\n  recommend an interpreter be appointed. Â Now, Rogers asks this court to \r\n  find error in the trial courtâ€™s failure to do what was never asked of it.\r\nâ€œIt is axiomatic that an issue \r\n  cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to \r\n  and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Wilder \r\n  Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).Â  â€œThere are \r\n  four basic requirements to preserving issues at trial for appellate review.Â  \r\n  The issue must have been (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) \r\n  raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the \r\n  trial court with sufficient specificity.â€Â  Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate \r\n  Practice in South Carolina 57 (2d ed. 2002).\r\nHere, Rogers never raised \r\n  the issue of using an interpreter during direct examination to the trial court.Â  \r\n  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Victimâ€™s cross-examination  \r\n\r\nRogers also argues the \r\n  trial court erred by failing to supply the victim with a qualified interpreter \r\n  during cross-examination.Â  Rogers contends the interpreter was not qualified \r\n  because he was the victimâ€™s son.Â  We disagree.\r\nSoon \r\n  after Rogersâ€™ counsel began cross-examining the victim, it became apparent that \r\n  the victim could not understand many of counselâ€™s questions.Â  When the victim \r\n  did comprehend the questions, defense counsel could not understand her responses.Â  \r\n  Because of these problems, the solicitor offered the victimâ€™s sister and the \r\n  victimâ€™s son as interpreters, as they were the only two people available who \r\n  could interpret the victimâ€™s unique method of communication.Â  Defense counsel \r\n  objected to the use of the sister because she was also a witness in the case.Â  \r\n  Counsel also objected to the son because he was related to the victim.Â  The \r\n  court appointed the victimâ€™s son as interpreter, after finding that it was in \r\n  the best interest of the witness and in the best interest of justice.Â  Â We \r\n  find no error in this decision.\r\nSection \r\n  15-27-15 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003) regulates the use of interpreters \r\n  in criminal proceedings.Â  This section requires the use of qualified interpreters, \r\n  who are defined in part as not being family members of the deaf witness.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-27-15(B)(1) (Supp. 2003).Â  However, the requirement of a qualified \r\n  interpreter can be waived by the deaf person or by the judge in the fulfillment \r\n  of justice.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-27-15(A) (Supp. 2003).Â Â  Specifically, the \r\n  statute states that â€œ[i]f a person elects to use an interpreter other than a \r\n  qualified interpreter provided for in this section, the court must first make \r\n  a determination that this action is in the best interest of the individual and \r\n  is in the best interests of justice.â€Â  In this case, the trial court understood \r\n  the required findings and made the determination that the use of the victimâ€™s \r\n  son as interpreter was in the best interest of the victim and of justice.\r\nThe trial court was confronted \r\n  with a difficult situation at trial and fashioned a solution that protected \r\n  the interests of the victim and justice (as the statute governing interpreters \r\n  requires) while also affording Rogers with a means to cross-examine his accuser.Â Â  \r\n  Thus, we find no error.\r\n\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trial Publicity  \r\n\r\nRogers next argues the \r\n  trial court erred when it denied his motion for new trial after jury misconduct \r\n  was discovered.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring the course of the \r\n  trial, it came to the courtâ€™s attention that a newspaper containing an article \r\n  about the ongoing trial was in the jury room.Â  At the beginning of proceedings \r\n  on the day of the articleâ€™s publication, the trial court spent considerable \r\n  time questioning the jury if any members had either read, seen, or had the article \r\n  mentioned to them.Â  Six jurors answered these questions in the affirmative.Â  \r\n  These six jurors were then questioned individually by the court.Â Â  Three of \r\n  them had not even seen the article, but had been apprised of its existence by \r\n  others.Â  These three jurors stated that they did not read or discuss the article \r\n  because it would have been inappropriate.Â  They further testified they had not \r\n  formed any opinion in this case as a result of this limited exposure to the \r\n  articleâ€™s existence. \r\nThe three other jurors \r\n  all stated they had looked at the article.Â  One juror stated he saw the headline \r\n  of the article, but did not read it because of the courtâ€™s instructions.Â  He \r\n  further said he did not see anyone in the jury room read the paper and nothing \r\n  had caused him to form an opinion in this case.Â  Another juror admitted that \r\n  she was to blame for bringing the newspaper into the jury room.Â  She explained \r\n  that when a fellow juror told her the newspaper contained an article on the \r\n  trial, she found the appropriate section of the newspaper, folded it, and placed \r\n  it in her purse. During this action, she said she was only exposed to the headline.Â  \r\n  This juror also testified nothing caused her to form an opinion in this case. \r\n\r\nFinally, the sixth juror \r\n  admitted she scanned the article though she did not remember any information \r\n  regarding Rogers.Â  Importantly, she remembered having read details in a paragraph \r\n  following one referencing Rogersâ€™ prior record.Â  As a result, the judge excused \r\n  this juror.Â Â  \r\nâ€œThe granting or refusing of \r\n  a motion for a mistrial lies within the sound discretion of the trial court \r\n  whose ruling will not be disturbed on appeal in the absence of an abuse of discretion \r\n  amounting to an error of law.â€ \r\n  State v. Wasson, 299 S.C. 508, 510, 386 S.E.2d 255, 256&nbsp;(1989).Â  \r\n  In evaluating news articles appearing during trial, the trial court must determine \r\n  if they are prejudicial and whether jurors read the articles.Â  Id. at \r\n  511, 386 S.E.2d at 256.Â  If such prejudicial exposure has occurred, the court \r\n  must craft an appropriate curative measure.Â  Id.Â  In Wasson, our \r\n  supreme court affirmed the denial of a mistrial where two jurors had read an \r\n  article discussing the defendantâ€™s other pending charges because the jurors \r\n  had stated the article did not affect their decision to find the defendant guilty.Â  \r\n  Id. at 511, 386 S.E.2d at 257.\r\nIn this case, five of the six \r\n  jurors had very limited exposure to the article, and all testified it had not \r\n  caused them to form any opinions.Â  The final juror was dismissed because she \r\n  had read most of the article.Â  We find the trial court thoroughly evaluated \r\n  each jurorâ€™s exposure to the news article and took the appropriate measures \r\n  to safeguard Rogersâ€™ right to a fair trial.Â  Therefore, we find no error.\r\n\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission of victimâ€™s purse \r\n   \r\n\r\nRogers next argues that the \r\n  admission of the victimâ€™s purse into evidence was error because it had not been \r\n  identified by the victim.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe purse \r\n  was entered into evidence during the testimony of Mark Jones, the police officer \r\n  who retrieved the purse after a homeowner called and reported finding it in \r\n  his yard.Â  The purse was admitted at trial after Jones testified that it was \r\n  the purse he retrieved, that the purse matched a description given by the victim, \r\n  and that it contained an item displaying the victimâ€™s name.Â  The victimâ€™s description \r\n  of the missing purse and the discovery of items bearing her name within it link \r\n  the purse to the victim and the crime.Â  Therefore, admission of the purse at \r\n  that time was not erroneous.Â  \r\nMoreover, \r\n  the victim eventually identified the purse as belonging to her.Â  Thus, even \r\n  if the purse had been admitted without a proper foundation, the foundation was \r\n  ultimately provided, and there would be no prejudice to Rogers.Â  See \r\n  State v. Pollard, 261 S.C. 389, 200 S.E.2d 233 (1973) (finding no prejudice \r\n  where drugs were entered into evidence prior to testimony of a complete chain \r\n  of custody because the chain was eventually provided); see also Rule \r\n  104(b), SCRE (allowing admission of evidence subject to the introduction of \r\n  other supporting evidence).Â  Therefore, we find no error in the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  admission of the purse into evidence.\r\n\r\n  5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Admission of fingerprint evidence \r\n   \r\n\r\nRogers also argues the trial \r\n  court erred by allowing fingerprint results into evidence without a proper chain \r\n  of custody.Â  We disagree.\r\nRogersâ€™ fingerprint was found \r\n  on a slip of paper in the victimâ€™s purse and these results were entered into \r\n  evidence through the testimony of a fingerprint analyst.Â  Rogers contends the \r\n  evidence should be excluded because the purseâ€™s chain of custody was defective.Â  \r\n\r\nInitially, we note that because \r\n  the purse is a non-fungible piece of evidence, chain of custody is not required \r\n  for its admission.Â  State v. Glenn, 328 S.C. 300, 305, 492 S.E.2d 393, \r\n  395 (Ct. App. 1997) (â€œ[W]here the issue is the admissibility of non-fungible \r\n  evidence â€“ that is, evidence that is unique and identifiable â€“ the establishment \r\n  of a strict chain of custody is not required . . . .â€).Â  However, even if a \r\n  chain needed to be established, it had been.Â  At trial, every individual who \r\n  had possession of the purse, which contained the slip of paper, testified to \r\n  having it and denied tampering with it.Â  \r\nRogers points to a period of \r\n  one week when law enforcement had returned the purse to the victim before retrieving \r\n  the purse again and performing fingerprint tests on its contents.Â  Apparently, \r\n  Rogersâ€™ concern is that some form of tampering might have occurred while it \r\n  was in the victimâ€™s possession.Â  However, the proof of chain of custody does \r\n  not have to negate all possibility of tampering.Â  The State only needs to establish \r\n  a complete chain of evidence as far as practicable.Â  Id.Â  The period \r\n  of time during which the purse was returned to the victim is accounted for by \r\n  the testimony of the victimâ€™s sister, who lives with the victim.Â  The sister \r\n  testified that during the week the purse was in her home, the bag containing \r\n  the purse was never opened.Â  Additionally, the officer who returned the purse \r\n  testified that when she went to retrieve it, the bag containing the purse was \r\n  where she had left it. \r\nSouth Carolina law does not \r\n  require testimony as to the exclusion of any possibility of tampering.Â  Rather, \r\n  â€œwhere the identity of persons handling the specimen is established, . . . evidence \r\n  regarding its care goes only to the weight of the specimen as credible evidence,â€ \r\n  not to the admissibility of the evidence.Â  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. \r\n  419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837&nbsp; (2001).Â  Accordingly, we find no error in \r\n  the admission of the fingerprint results.\r\n\r\n  6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life without parole \r\n   \r\n\r\nFinally, Rogers argues a sentence \r\n  of life without parole is cruel and unusual punishment under this set of facts.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nRogers was sentenced to life \r\n  without parole pursuant to section 17-25-45(A) of the South Carolina Code.Â Â  \r\n  Section 17-25-45(A) requires that â€œupon a conviction for a most serious offense \r\n  . . . a person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life without \r\n  the possibility of parole if that person has one or more prior convictions for: \r\n  (1) a most serious offense.â€Â  \r\nNineteen years prior to the \r\n  convictions addressed in this opinion, Rogers was convicted of assault and battery \r\n  with intent to kill, which is a â€œmost serious offense.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  However, Rogers argues this prior offense was too remote in time \r\n  to be used to enhance his sentence for the current crime.Â  \r\nIn State v. Burdette, \r\n  335 S.C. 34, 37-38, 515 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1999), the supreme court affirmed imposing \r\n  a life without parole sentence where the appellantâ€™s prior offense occurred \r\n  seventeen years before the triggering offense, just two years less than the \r\n  span of time in our case.Â  Furthermore, section 17-25-45(A) has withstood repeated \r\n  constitutional challenges, including assertions of cruel and unusual punishment.Â  \r\n  See, e.g., State v. Jones, 344 S.C. 48, 56-59, 543 S.E.2d \r\n  541, 545-47&nbsp;(2001) (holding â€œtwo-strikesâ€ law constitutional under separation \r\n  of powers, cruel and unusual punishment, equal protection and ex post facto \r\n  challenges).Â  Thus, we find no error in imposing a life without parole sentence \r\n  in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons stated above, \r\n  Rogersâ€™ convictions and sentences are\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, \r\n  J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3855","title":"State v.

We reverse and remand. \r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  FACTS\r\nAppellant Byron Slater was with some friends on \r\n  the evening of February 3, 2001, at a school gymnasium where there had been \r\n  a dance. Following the dance, Slater went outside, where he started talking \r\n  with â€œsome females.â€ While there, he became aware of a disturbance near a truck. \r\n  Slater walked to his car, retrieved a gun, and started to walk toward the truck. [1]  Slater then changed his mind. He walked back \r\n  toward his car, where three friends, Ellis Judon (the driver), Kenyon Nichols, \r\n  and Deshawn Brown, were waiting for him. Moments later, Slater noticed that \r\n  another disturbance was taking place in an adjacent parking lot and wanted to \r\n  see what was going on. Slater asked Judon to drive there. [2]  In that second parking lot, an apparent robbery \r\n  was unfolding. The victim was on the ground, being stomped by five men. Slater \r\n  knew neither the victim nor his attackers. \r\nSlater testified that he walked up to the robbery \r\n  and surprised one of the attackers. The man then turned around and pointed a \r\n  gun toward Slater. Slater quickly turned around and started running back toward \r\n  his car. As he ran, he heard a gunshot and responded by shooting his own gun \r\n  behind him. Slater got into the car where his friends were waiting for him. [3]  He continued shooting in the air as the car \r\n  pulled away. In the ensuing chaos, the victim of the attempted robbery lay dying \r\n  on the ground. He had been shot twice.Â  \r\nBack in the car, Slater said that he thought he \r\n  had â€œhitâ€ someone. Slater and his three friends drove to Slaterâ€™s house, where \r\n  Slater left the gun. The four then went back to the parking lot where the shooting \r\n  had occurred. On the way, the police stopped them and searched the car but did \r\n  not find any weapon. \r\nEarly the next morning, detectives from the city \r\n  of North Charleston went to Slaterâ€™s residence to arrest him. Following the \r\n  arrest, they obtained a search warrant for Slaterâ€™s house. The detectives recovered \r\n  various ammunitions from Slaterâ€™s yard and from inside his house, including \r\n  two guns, some projectiles, bullets, and shell casings. \r\nAt the police station, Slater told the police that \r\n  he â€œdidnâ€™t shoot anybody.â€ However, a ballistics expert testified at trial that \r\n  the fatal bullets came from Slaterâ€™s gun, as did the ones retrieved from the \r\n  crime scene. Additionally, numerous witnesses placed Slater at the crime scene \r\n  with a gun. Slater himself admitted to shooting his gun, but insisted that he \r\n  did not mean to shoot anyone. The jury convicted Slater of murder, though the \r\n  trial judge had included a manslaughter option in the jury charge. [4]  The trial judge expressly refused to include \r\n  a self-defense charge. \r\n \r\n  ISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the trial judge err in refusing to include a self-defense charge, reasoning \r\n  that Slater had brought about the difficulty?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial judge err in allowing the victimâ€™s mother to testify that her \r\n  son did not have a criminal record?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the trial judge err in allowing a detective to testify that an eyewitness \r\n  to the crime had denied hearing any gunshot other than Slaterâ€™s?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nSlater argues that the trial judge committed reversible \r\n  error in refusing to include a self-defense charge. We agree.\r\nThe evidence presented at \r\n  trial determines the law to be charged. State v. Goodson, 312 S.C. 278, \r\n  280, 440 S.E.2d 370, 372 (1994). If there is any evidence in the record \r\n  to support self-defense, the issue should be submitted to the jury. State \r\n  v. Burkhart, 350 S.C. 252, 261, 565 S.E.2d 298, 302 (2002); State v. \r\n  Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 261, 433 S.E.2d 848, 849 (1993). A trial judgeâ€™s failure \r\n  to do so is reversible error. State v. Day, 341 S.C. 410, 416, 535 S.E.2d \r\n  431, 434 (2000). Additionally, â€œ[c]urrent law requires the State to disprove \r\n  self-defense, once raised by the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt.â€ Burkhart, \r\n  350 S.C. at 261, 565 S.E.2d at 303 (citing State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. \r\n  538, 544, 500 S.E.2d 489, 494 (1998)). \r\nFor a defendant to argue self-defense, \r\n  the record must demonstrate that â€œ(1) [he] was without fault in bringing on \r\n  the difficulty; (2) [he] actually believed he was in imminent danger of losing \r\n  his life or sustaining serious bodily injury; (3) a reasonably prudent person \r\n  of ordinary firmness and courage would have entertained the same belief; and \r\n  (4) [he] had no other probable means of avoiding the danger.â€ State v. Chapman, \r\n  336 S.C. 149, 153, 519 S.E.2d 100, 103 (1999).Â  Moreover, â€œ[o]ne who provokes \r\n  or initiates an assault cannot escape criminal liability by invoking self-defense.â€ \r\n  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999). However, \r\n  a defendant can restore his right to self-defense if he withdraws from the conflict \r\n  and communicates that decision to the opponent. Id.Â  \r\nHere, there was some evidence to support \r\n  a self-defense charge. Slater maintains that when he approached the altercation \r\n  between the victim and his attackers, an attacker pointed a gun at Slater. Slater \r\n  then turned and ran. While running away, Slater heard gunshots and returned \r\n  fire, not looking in the direction where he was firing. Slater testified, â€œwhen \r\n  I walked up on him, I guess I surprised him and he turned to me and he had a \r\n  gun in his hand. And I see his gun and I started running.â€ He added, â€œYeah, \r\n  when I walked up on him like here, like he turned to me, like had the gun pointed \r\n  at me like he surprised.â€ Additionally, Mark Nelson, a friend of the victim, \r\n  testified that he saw one of the attackers â€“ someone other than Slater â€“ with \r\n  a gun. \r\nThe State insists that Slater bears some responsibility \r\n  for the tragedy because he was in unlawful possession of a gun and carried that \r\n  gun into the altercation. However, the mere unlawful possession of a firearm, \r\n  with nothing more, does not automatically bar a self-defense charge. See \r\n  State v. Burris, 334 S.C. 256, 262, 513 S.E.2d 104, 108 (1999) (explaining \r\n  that â€œa person can be acting lawfully, even if he is in unlawful possession \r\n  of a weaponâ€). As importantly, Slater testified that he turned and started to \r\n  run away from the attacker holding the gun. Therefore, even if Slater \r\n  initially contributed to the difficulty, that he turned and ran away would restore \r\n  his right to self-defense. See Bryant, 336 S.C. at 346, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  at 322 (explaining that an appellantâ€™s attempt to leave the scene of a confrontation \r\n  would signal that the â€œappellant truly intended to withdrawâ€ from the situation). \r\n  See also State v. Rogers, 329 S.C. 520, 525, 466 S.E.2d 360, 363 \r\n  (1996) (reasoning that Rogers faced no overt threat because his opponent was \r\n  moving away from him and said nothing to evince a threat).Â  \r\nThe dissent contends that Slater â€œprovoked a conflict \r\n  by running toward an altercation while conspicuously holding a cocked and loaded \r\n  gun.â€ The record provides otherwise. Slater testified, â€œI walked up on [the \r\n  attacker] . . . [the gun] was by my side . . . in my right hand.â€ That testimony \r\n  is uncontroverted. The dissent apparently assumes that (1) one of the attackers \r\n  saw Slaterâ€™s gun; (2) was afraid for his own safety; and (3) started to shoot \r\n  as a result. That scenario is plausible, but the record fails to establish it. \r\n  [5]  It is just as likely that Slaterâ€™s gun was inconspicuous, especially \r\n  given that the regrettable events of that evening occurred when â€œit was pretty \r\n  darkâ€ and that Slater had his gun by his side.\r\nCiting Bryant, the dissent argues that â€œSlater \r\n  failed to effectively communicate his intent to withdrawâ€ to the attacker with \r\n  the gun. We disagree. In Bryant, the victim apparently caught the appellant \r\n  breaking into the victimâ€™s truck. Id. at 343, 520 S.E.2d at 321. The \r\n  two struggled, and the appellant stabbed the victim to death with a screwdriver. \r\n  Id. at 344, 520 S.E.2d at 321. The appellant argued that he was entitled \r\n  to a self-defense charge because he had dropped his knife to the ground before \r\n  the fight began. Id. According to him, that gesture indicated his intent \r\n  to withdraw and restored his right to self-defense. Id. Our supreme court \r\n  rejected the argument. \r\nThe court initially found that the appellant brought on the \r\n  difficulty because the attempted break-in was â€œin violation of law and reasonably \r\n  calculated to produce the occasion.â€ Id. at 345, 520 S.E.2d at 322. The \r\n  court clarified, however, that, â€œâ€˜[i]f, after commencing the assault, the aggressor \r\n  withdraws in good faith from the conflict and announces in some way to his adversary \r\n  his intention to retire, he is restored to his right of self-defense.â€™â€ Id. \r\n  (citation omitted). In that case, the appellant himself admitted that the victim \r\n  did not see him drop the knife, and therefore could not have known about the \r\n  alleged withdrawal. The court reasoned, as said earlier, that â€œ[i]f appellant \r\n  truly intended to withdraw he could have easily left the open parking lot.â€ \r\n  Id. at 346, 520 S.E.2d at 322. \r\nHere, Slater merely walked toward the altercation; he threatened \r\n  or assaulted no one. [6]  More \r\n  importantly, Slater immediately â€œturned and ranâ€ after seeing the attackerâ€™s \r\n  gun. Slater did exactly what the supreme court looked for in Bryant: \r\n  he left â€“ quickly.Â  \r\nAdmittedly, as the dissent posits, the attacker may have \r\n  thought that Slater was withdrawing simply â€œto gain [some] tactical advantage.â€ \r\n  However, our task is not to determine the attackerâ€™s state of mind. Rather, \r\n  as instructed by our supreme court, we are to see only whetherÂ  â€œany evidenceâ€ \r\n  in the record supports a self-defense charge. [7]  Day, 341 S.C. at 416, \r\n  535 S.E.2d at 434. We find that there is some. The trial judge, therefore, erred \r\n  in not including the charge. \r\nHaving found that the exclusion of the \r\n  requested self-defense charge was error, we need not address Slaterâ€™s remaining \r\n  issues.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse and remand \r\n  for a new trial on both charges. [8] \r\n  \r\nANDERSON, J., concurs and HEARN, C.J., dissents \r\n  separately.\r\n \r\n HEARN, C.J., dissenting: Because \r\n  Slater failed to effectively communicate his intent to withdraw after he provoked \r\n  a dangerous situation, I do not believe he was entitled to a charge of self-defense.Â  \r\n  Therefore, I respectfully dissent. \r\nA person who provokes an assault cannot \r\n  claim a right to self-defense unless that person â€œâ€˜withdraws in good faith from \r\n  the conflict and announces in some way to his adversary his intention to retire.â€™â€Â  \r\n  State v. Bryant, 336 S.C. 340, 345, 520 S.E.2d 319, 322 (1999) (quoting \r\n  55 A.L.R.3d at 1003).Â  Here, all the evidence, including Slaterâ€™s own testimony, \r\n  indicates that he provoked a conflict by running toward an altercation while \r\n  conspicuously holding a cocked and loaded handgun, even though he had no personal \r\n  connection to the people involved in the fight. [9] Â  \r\nSlater argues that he withdrew from the conflict \r\n  because (1) he began to run when a man involved in the turmoil pointed a gun \r\n  at him, and (2) he did not shoot his gun until he heard someone else fire first.Â  \r\n  However, in his testimony, Slater admitted that the events - his running, hearing \r\n  the shot, and firing back - all â€œhappened so fast.â€Â  Slater further admitted \r\n  that he not only shot backwards as he was running away, but that he also shot \r\n  in the air after he had gotten inside a car and was riding away from the scene.Â  \r\n  In my view, even if Slater intended to withdraw, neither his words nor his actions \r\n  communicated this intent. See id. (â€œOneâ€™s right to self-defense \r\n  is restored after a withdrawal from the initial difficulty with the victim if \r\n  that withdrawal is communicated to the victim by word or act.â€); State v. \r\n  Graham, 260 S.C. 449, 196 S.E.2d 495 (1973).Â  \r\nWhile the trial court is required to charge the \r\n  jury on self-defense if there is any evidence supporting the charge, all the \r\n  evidence in the record shows that Slater provoked a dangerous situation and \r\n  no evidence indicates that he ever communicated his withdrawal after the\r\nprovocation.Â  Despite Slaterâ€™s claim that he attempted \r\n  to retreat, he admitted that he still had a cocked and loaded gun in his hand.Â  \r\n  With a dangerous weapon readily available for Slater to use, the person whom \r\n  Slater had approached could not have known whether Slater was withdrawing from \r\n  the conflict or whether Slater was retreating to gain tactical advantage.Â  See \r\n  40 C.J.S. Homicide Â§ 125 (1991) (â€œAs long as a person keeps his gun in \r\n  his hand prepared to shoot, the person opposing him is not expected or required \r\n  to accept any act or statement as indicative of an intent to discontinue the \r\n  assault.â€); see also Bryant, 336 S.C. at 346, 520 S.E.2d at 322 \r\n  (finding the defendant failed to effectively communicate his withdrawal even \r\n  though he threw down his knife because the defendant admitted the victim did \r\n  not see him drop the knife).Â  Because Slater failed to communicate his intent \r\n  to withdraw, his right to use self-defense was never restored.Â  Therefore, I \r\n  find no error in the trial courtâ€™s refusal to charge self-defense.\r\nBecause I disagree with the majorityâ€™s \r\n  decision to reverse on the failure to charge self-defense, I briefly address \r\n  Slaterâ€™s additional arguments on appeal.Â  In addition to his argument regarding \r\n  self-defense, Slater also contends the trial court erred by allowing the victimâ€™s \r\n  mother to testify that her son did not have a criminal record.Â  \r\nRule 404(a)(2), SCRE, states that although character \r\n  evidence is generally not allowed, â€œ[e]vidence of a character trait of peacefulness \r\n  of the victim offered by the prosecution in a homicide case [is admissible when \r\n  it is used] to rebut evidence that the victim was the first aggressor.â€Â  Here, \r\n  because the gist of Slaterâ€™s defense at trial was that he had been shot at first, \r\n  evidence regarding the victimâ€™s character was properly offered to rebut the \r\n  inference that the victim may have been the initial shooter. \r\n  [10]  Therefore, I find no error in the trial court allowing this testimony.\r\nSlaterâ€™s final argument on appeal is that the trial \r\n  court erred by admitting hearsay testimony of a police officer.Â  I disagree.\r\nAt trial, Deshawn Brown, who was accompanying Slater on \r\n  the night of the incident, testified he heard a gunshot earlier in the evening \r\n  when he and Slater were â€œstanding by the school by the gym.â€ Â On redirect examination, \r\n  Brown testified that he remembered giving a statement to the police.Â  When asked \r\n  whether he told the investigating officers that he heard gunshots earlier that \r\n  night, Brown replied that he did not. Â Brown explained that he never told anyone \r\n  about the gunshots he heard because, until the trial, he had never been asked \r\n  about hearing any other gunshots that night. \r\nAt a later point in Slaterâ€™s trial, the State \r\n  questioned one of the officers who had questioned Brown, and the following exchange \r\n  occurred:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Q:\r\n         Did you ask them about guns at the scene of the crime?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:Â \r\n         Yes, I did.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:Â \r\n         Did you ask them about anybody else shooting at the \r\n  scene of the crime?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:\r\n         Yes, I did.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:&nbsp;\r\n         Well, when you were interviewing Deshawn Brown, did \r\n  he ever tell you that he heard anybody else shooting out there?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Defense Counsel:Â &nbsp;\r\n         Objection, your Honor, thatâ€™s not proper.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        The Court:Â \r\n         No, sir, I will â€“ no, sir, Iâ€™ll permit that \r\n  question.Â  Go ahead.\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        Q:Â &nbsp;\r\n        Did he ever tell you\r\n          that?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        A:&nbsp;\r\n        I interviewed Deshawn Brown.Â  He never once told us \r\n  about anybody else shooting at the scene.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSlater contends on appeal that the above testimony was inadmissible \r\n  hearsay because it refers to a statement â€œother than one made by the declarant \r\n  while testifying at trial or hearing, offered into evidence to prove the truth \r\n  of the matter asserted.â€Â  See Rule 801(c), SCRE.\r\nWhile the above testimony regarding the statements \r\n  of Brown is hearsay, we find that it is admissible under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  \r\n  This rule provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nExtrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement by \r\n  a witness is not admissible unless the witness is advised of the substance of \r\n  the statement, the time and place it was allegedly made, and the person to whom \r\n  it was made, and is given the opportunity to explain or deny the statement.Â  \r\n  If a witness does not admit that he has made the prior inconsistent statement, \r\n  extrinsic evidence of such statement is admissible.\r\n\r\nRule 613(b), SCRE (emphasis added).Â  When a witness is presented \r\n  with the requisite circumstances surrounding an alleged inconsistent statement \r\n  and nevertheless continues to deny before the court ever making the statement, \r\n  another personâ€™s testimony that the witness did, in fact, make that statement \r\n  is admissible under Rule 613(b), SCRE.Â  See State v. Fossick, \r\n  333 S.C. 66, 69-70, 508 S.E.2d 32, 33 (1998).\r\nIn the case before us, the investigating officer \r\n  testified that he asked all the witnesses (including Brown) about whether anyone \r\n  else was shooting a weapon at the scene of the crime.Â  He testified Brown had \r\n  not told him about anyone else shooting.Â  Because Brown denied ever being asked \r\n  this question after he was presented with all the requisite circumstances, the \r\n  officerâ€™s testimony constituted extrinsic evidence of a prior inconsistent statement \r\n  and was admissible under Rule 613(b).Â  Thus, the judge acted properly in overruling \r\n  Slaterâ€™s objections to the testimony.\r\nAccordingly, based on the foregoing, I \r\n  would affirm Slaterâ€™s conviction.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Slater testified that he retrieved the gun â€œto shoot it in the air \r\n    . . . something that young people be doing like after parties or clubs or \r\n    whatever.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]    There is some dispute as to these facts. Slater contends that he \r\n    never returned to his car because he realized another confrontation was taking \r\n    place in another parking lot and walked over there instead, still carrying \r\n    his gun. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Nichols and Brown, too, had gotten out of the car, but apparently \r\n    returned before Slater.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The jury also convicted Slater on one count of possession of a firearm \r\n    during the commission of a violent crime.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  The men involved in the robbery were apparently never apprehended. \r\n    They did not participate in the proceedings, so what they may have seen is \r\n    unclear.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  If the gun was indeed inconspicuous (see earlier discussion), it \r\n    is difficult to imagine how Slaterâ€™s act of walking toward the robbery was \r\n    â€œin violation of law and reasonably calculated to produceâ€ the difficulty. \r\n    The cases cited by the Bryant court all involved robbers or other felons \r\n    claiming self-defense when the would-be victims tried to defend themselves. \r\n    See id. at 345, 520 S.E.2d at 322.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  Additionally, the supreme court \r\n    cautioned that â€œa trial judge should specifically tailor the self-defense \r\n    instruction to adequately reflect the facts and theories presented by the \r\n    defendant.â€ Day, 341 S.C. at 418, 535 S.E.2d at 435.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  See Burkhart, 350 S.C. at 264, 565 S.E.2d at 304 (ordering \r\n    a new trial on charges of possession of a firearm during the commission of \r\n    a violent crime after overturning the underlying conviction on the violent \r\n    crime).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  Slater made no claim of â€œdefense of others at trial,â€ nor did his \r\n    testimony in any way reflect an intention to enter the conflict in defense \r\n    of those being attacked.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]  After the victimâ€™s mother testified, Slater \r\n    presented testimony that powder residue on the victimâ€™s hands could have resulted \r\n    from the victim firing a weapon, further indicating that the defenseâ€™s strategy \r\n    was to implicate the victim as the initial shooter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3856","title":"Degenhart v.

Brown, Jr., Family Court \r\n  Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3856\r\nHeard June 24, 2004 â€“ Filed August 16, 2004 \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJ. Mark Taylor and M.

Degenhart appeals \r\n  a family court order denying his request for termination of alimony.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nPaul V. Degenhart and Debra V. \r\n  Burriss were married in 1989.Â  The couple separated and entered into a written \r\n  separation agreement in August 1999. Â Following one year of separation, \r\n  they were divorced.Â  The final divorce order incorporated the written separation \r\n  agreement verbatim.Â  The section of this agreement pertaining to alimony reads \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nHusband agrees to pay Wife alimony in the amount of $2,500.00 \r\n  per month payable on the 1st day of each month beginning with the \r\n  month of September, 1999 for a period of the earlier of seven years or upon \r\n  the remarriage of Wife.Â  \r\n\r\nUnder the heading â€œModification and Binding Effect \r\n  of Agreement,â€ the agreement provides:\r\n\r\nThe provisions of this AGREEMENT shall not be modified or \r\n  changed except by mutual consent and agreement of the parties expressed in writing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the coupleâ€™s divorce, but after \r\n  entering into the separation agreement, Wife met William R. Hall.Â  The two began \r\n  spending the night together on a regular basis in November 1999, and they continue \r\n  to share an exclusive sexual relationship.Â  Wife and Hall began cohabitating \r\n  in a rental house in September 2000, around the time of Husband and Wifeâ€™s divorce.Â  \r\n  One year later, Wife and Hall purchased a home.Â  The house was jointly titled \r\n  and mortgaged, and the two equally divided the down payment and the tax deduction \r\n  for the mortgage interest.Â  Additionally, they have taken numerous vacations \r\n  together.Â  Despite their sexual relationship and cohabitation, Wife and Hall \r\n  maintain separate bank accounts and do not hold themselves out to be married. \r\n\r\nIn August 2002, Husband initiated the underlying \r\n  action for termination of his alimony obligation, based solely on the cohabitation \r\n  of Wife and Hall.Â  The family court denied his request, and Husband appeals. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nQuestions concerning alimony rest within the sound \r\n  discretion of the family court judge whose conclusion will not be disturbed \r\n  absent a showing of abuse of discretion.Â  Bryson v. Bryson, 347 S.C. \r\n  221, 224, 553 S.E.2d 493, 495 (Ct. App. 2001); Bannen v.Bannen, 286 S.C. \r\n  24, 26, 331 S.E.2d 379, 380 (Ct. App. 1985).Â  â€œAn abuse of discretion occurs \r\n  when the decision is controlled by some error of law or is based on findings \r\n  of fact that are without evidentiary support.â€Â  Bryson, 347 S.C. at 224, \r\n  553 S.E.2d at 495; McKnight v. McKnight, 283 S.C. 540, 543, 324 S.E.2d \r\n  91, 93 (Ct. App. 1984).\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nBased on the terms of Husband and \r\n  Wifeâ€™s agreement and the law of alimony modification, the family court determined \r\n  it did not have the authority to modify Husbandâ€™s alimony obligation.Â  We agree.\r\nSection 20-3-130 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (Supp. 2003) outlines in great detail the nature of alimony awards under \r\n  South Carolina law.Â  Subsection (G) states in relevant part: â€œThe parties may \r\n  agree in writing if properly approved by the court to make the payment of alimony \r\n  as set forth [in this statute] nonmodifiable and not subject to subsequent \r\n  modification by the court.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(G) (Supp. 2003) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  While the family court normally has the authority to modify alimony, [1]  once an alimony agreement that specifically \r\n  disallows modification is approved by the court and merged into a judicial order, \r\n  it is binding on the parties and the court and is not subject to modification.Â  \r\n  Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 353, 306 S.E.2d 624, 627 (1983) (â€œThe \r\n  parties may specifically agree that the amount of alimony may not ever be modified \r\n  by the court . . . .â€); Croom v. Croom, 305 S.C. 158, 161, 406 S.E.2d \r\n  381, 383 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  \r\nIn Croom, this court reversed the \r\n  modification of an alimony obligation because the court-adopted alimony agreement \r\n  provided â€œthe terms and conditions of the agreement and any court order approving \r\n  it â€˜shall not be modifiable by the parties or any court without written \r\n  consent of the Husband and Wife.â€™â€Â  305 S.C. at 159, 406 S.E.2d at 382 (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  Husband would have us find Croom inapposite to the case before \r\n  us because this agreement lacks language specifically stating that the family \r\n  court cannot modify the agreement.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhile this agreement does not expressly \r\n  state that the family court cannot modify the agreement, it is clear \r\n  and specific about how the agreement can be modified, that being â€œby \r\n  mutual consent and agreement of the parties expressed in writing.â€Â  Because \r\n  the family court â€œmust enforce an unambiguous contract according to its terms \r\n  regardless of its wisdom or folly, apparent unreasonableness, or the partiesâ€™ \r\n  failure to guard their rights carefully,â€ we see no reason to require â€œmagic \r\n  wordsâ€ for an unambiguous agreement to gain efficacy.Â  Lindsay v. Lindsay, \r\n  328 S.C. 329, 340, 491 S.E.2d 583, 589 (Ct. App. 1997).Â Â Â  The agreement here, \r\n  by stating that its terms â€œshall not be modified or changed except by mutual \r\n  consent,â€ clearly denies the family court the jurisdiction to modify the agreement \r\n  by its own authority or at the behest of only one of the parties.Â  Therefore, \r\n  it was properly enforced.\r\nHusband also contends that recent case law and \r\n  amendments to section 20-3-150 of the South Carolina Code may, in certain situations, \r\n  trump the longstanding rule that alimony agreements can be made nonmodifiable \r\n  by agreement of the parties.Â  Again, we disagree.Â  \r\nIn the case of Bryson v. Bryson, \r\n  347 S.C. 221, 224-25, 553 S.E.2d 493, 494 (Ct. App. 2001), this court held certain \r\n  relationships, although not legal marriages, could by their nature constitute \r\n  relationships â€œtantamount to marriageâ€ and warrant alimony modification pursuant \r\n  to section 20-3-170.Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-170 (1985) (providing \r\n  that changed circumstances may warrant a modification or termination of alimony).Â  \r\n  A substantial element of determining whether a relationship is tantamount to \r\n  marriage is the cohabitation of the parties.Â  See Bryson, 347 \r\n  S.C. at 226 n.7, 553 S.E.2d at 496 n.7.Â  Later amendments to section 20-3-150, \r\n  further defining â€œcohabitationâ€ as previously applied in Bryson, read \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n[U]pon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of \r\n  the supported spouse the amount fixed in the decree for his or her support shall \r\n  cease, and no further alimony payments may be required from the supporting spouse.\r\nFor purposes of this subsection and unless otherwise agreed \r\n  to in writing by the parties, â€œcontinued cohabitationâ€ means the supported spouse \r\n  resides with another person in a romantic relationship for a period of ninety \r\n  or more consecutive days.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added to relevant 2002 amendments.)\r\nWe first note that Bryson did not \r\n  concern an alimony agreement with terms that made the agreement nonmodifiable \r\n  by the family court and therefore is not specifically applicable to the case \r\n  at bar.Â  Nothing in this courtâ€™s holding in Bryson changed the longstanding \r\n  rule that parties could agree to make alimony nonmodifiable.Â  See Bryson, \r\n  347 S.C. at 224-25, 553 S.E.2d at 495 (â€œThus, the doctrines of law of the case \r\n  and res judicata do not apply to those family court actions that are modifiable \r\n  based on changes in circumstances.â€) (emphasis added).Â  Furthermore, because \r\n  â€œthe legislature cannot create a statute which applies retroactively to divest \r\n  vested rights,â€ the 2002 amendments to section 20-3-150 have absolutely no bearing \r\n  on Husband and Wifeâ€™s agreement, which was incorporated into an order in 2000.Â  \r\n  Russo v. Sutton, 310 S.C. 200, 205 n.5, 422 S.E.2d 750, 753 n.5 (1992).\r\n Accordingly, the order of the family court \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n STILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]    See, e.g., S.C.

Black and Mary Bass Lohr, both of Beaufort, for Appellants.\r\nJames Howarth Ritchie, Jr., of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: This case arises from numerous \r\n  voided tax sales of real property in Beaufort County.Â  After the sales were \r\n  voided, the County returned the purchase prices to the successful bidders but \r\n  refused to return the interest the money had earned.Â Â  The bidders sued and, \r\n  under a theory of restitution, were awarded an amount equal to the interest \r\n  earned by Beaufort County during the time it held the biddersâ€™ money.Â  The County \r\n  appeals.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nKey Corporate Capital, Inc., \r\n  National Tax Assistance Corporation, and TransAm Tax Certificate Corporation \r\n  (â€œbiddersâ€) purchased a number of properties at Beaufort County tax sales in \r\n  1998 and 1999.Â  The Beaufort County Treasurer voided twelve of these tax sales \r\n  pursuant to the authority vested in the Treasurer by section 12-51-150 of the \r\n  South Carolina Code (2000).Â  The voiding of the tax sales resulted solely from \r\n  the actions or inactions taken by Beaufort County and its agents.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the Treasurer discovered a series of â€œerrors, oversights, and/or miscommunications \r\n  within the Beaufort County offices, meaning the Treasurerâ€™s Office and/or the \r\n  Auditorâ€™s Office.â€Â  These errors included â€œa deed recording error resulting \r\n  in an invalid notice to the defaulting taxpayer,â€ a failure to accurately credit \r\n  the payment of delinquent taxes, and â€œa flaw with regard to statutory notice \r\n  to the delinquent taxpayer.â€Â Â  \r\nWhen the tax sales were voided \r\n  by the County of Beaufort, Treasurer of Beaufort County, and Tax Collector of \r\n  Beaufort County (â€œthe Countyâ€), the amounts paid for the properties were refunded \r\n  to the bidders.Â  However, the County retained the purchase price on each property \r\n  for at least thirty days, and in some cases, the County held the purchase price \r\n  for over a year. \r\nThe County actually accrued $28,010.93 \r\n  in interest by holding the monies involved in these voided tax sales.Â  The bidders \r\n  sued the County, arguing that in addition to recouping the amount of their bid, \r\n  they should also receive the interest their money earned while in the Countyâ€™s \r\n  possession.Â  The master-in-equity agreed and ruled that under a theory of restitution, \r\n  the bidders were entitled to the actual interest earned by the County prior \r\n  to the return of the purchase price.Â Â  We affirm.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œWhen legal and equitable actions are maintained \r\n  in one suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes \r\n  of the applicable standard of review on appeal.â€Â  Kiriakides v. Atlas Food \r\n  Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc., 338 S.C. 572, 580, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000) (quoting Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92 n.1, 485 S.E.2d \r\n  97, 99 n.1 (1997).Â  â€œIn an action at equity, this court can find facts in accordance \r\n  with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  West v. Newberry Elec. \r\n  Co-op.,&nbsp;357 S.C. 537, 542, 593 S.E.2d 500, 502&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).Â  \r\n  â€œIn an action at law, tried without a jury, the appellate court standard of \r\n  review extends only to the correction of errors of law.â€Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. \r\n  v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327, 334, 577 S.E.2d 468, 472&nbsp;(Ct. \r\n  App. 2003).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe County first argues that section 12-51-150 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2000), which governs voided tax sales, compels our \r\n  court to allow the County to retain the interest while holding a successful \r\n  bidderâ€™s money. Â We disagree.\r\nSection 12-51-150 states:\r\nIn the case that the official in charge of the tax sale \r\n  discovers before a tax title has passed, the failure of any action required \r\n  to be properly performed, the official may void the tax sale and refund the \r\n  amount paid to the successful bidder.\r\n\r\nThe County argues that because this section only \r\n  addresses the return of the purchase price upon the voiding of a tax sale, the \r\n  statute allows the County to keep the interest earned on the money.Â  However, \r\n  we do not believe the statuteâ€™s silence on the subject entitles the County to \r\n  retain the interest.Â  \r\n\r\nIn contrast to section 12-51-150â€™s silence, other \r\n  code sections relevant to tax sales address which party is entitled to interest \r\n  in certain situations.Â  For instance, under section 12-51-130, the County \r\n  is â€œentitled to the earnings for keeping the overage [amount paid at auction \r\n  greater than the amounts owed by delinquent taxpayer].â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-130 \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Section 12-51-100, however, provides that a successful bidder \r\n  is entitled to receive interest on the bid price in the event the property is \r\n  redeemed.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-51-100 (2000).Â  Because other statutes are explicit \r\n  about which party is entitled to keep interest on bid prices from tax sales, \r\n  the silence of section 12-51-150 does not, by itself, indicate the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent. \r\nThe County also argues that, because section 12-51-150 \r\n  does not specifically grant bidders the right to recoup the interest the County \r\n  earns on their money, the County is entitled to the interest pursuant to the \r\n  supreme courtâ€™s decision in Red Oak Lands, Inc. v. Lane, 268 S.C. 631, \r\n  235 S.E.2d 718 (1977).Â  We disagree.\r\nIn the Red Oak Lands case, a corporation \r\n  (Red Oak) bought property at a tax sale but was later divested of title to that \r\n  property.Â Â  Red Oak sued the tax collector for the damages it sustained from \r\n  this divestment pursuant to sections 65-2782 through 65-2785 of the South Carolina \r\n  Code (1962), which entitled a divested tax sale purchaser to a lien on the property \r\n  for the amount paid at the tax sale or to recover that amount directly from \r\n  the taxing authority.Â Â  These statutes, however, required the divested tax sale \r\n  purchaser to bring suit against the taxing authority within two years of the \r\n  sale.Â  Id. at 634, 235 S.E.2d at 720.Â  \r\nThe trial court found that Red Oak failed to state \r\n  facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.Â  Id. at 632-633, 235 \r\n  S.E.2d at 719.Â  On appeal, Red Oak argued, among other things, that the trial \r\n  court erred in refusing to grant its request to replead.Â  Specifically, Red \r\n  Oak wanted to amend its complaint to include a common law action for the tax \r\n  collectorâ€™s misfeasance related to the sale.Â  The supreme court found the statutory \r\n  remedy provided to tax sale purchasers was exclusive, and therefore â€œit would \r\n  be a futile gesture to grant Red Oak the right to repleadâ€ because the two-year \r\n  limitation period provided by Section 65-2785 had expired.Â  Id. at 636, \r\n  235 S.E.2d at 720. \r\nThe Red Oak Lands court held that the exclusive \r\n  remedy for recovery of the purchase price of a tax sale was the remedy provided \r\n  by statute.Â  However, unlike Red Oaks, the bidders in this case are not attempting \r\n  to assert a common law cause of action against the County for recovery of the \r\n  purchase price in addition to the cause of action provided by statute. \r\n  Instead, the bidders acknowledge that their only relief stems from section 12-51-150.Â  \r\n  However, they argue that because section 12-51-150 is silent regarding which \r\n  party is entitled to the interest, we should consider the rules of equity when \r\n  interpreting the statute and find that the statuteâ€™s requirement that the County \r\n  return the bid price implicitly directs the County to return actual interest \r\n  earned as well.Â  We agree.\r\nEquity is reserved for situations when there is \r\n  no adequate remedy at law.Â  Santee Cooper Resort, Inc. v. South Carolina \r\n  Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 298 S.C. 179, 185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123&nbsp;(1989).Â  \r\n  For a court to justify refusing to exercise equity, the remedy at law must be \r\n  adequate.Â  Chisolm v. Pryor, 207 S.C. 54, 60, 35 S.E.2d 21, 24&nbsp;(1945).Â  \r\n  Furthermore, â€œ[i]t is not enough that there is some remedy at law, but that \r\n  remedy must be as practical, efficient, and prompt as the remedy in equity.â€Â  \r\n  Id.  \r\nIn this case, no adequate legal remedy exists.Â  Section \r\n  12-51-150 requires the return of the purchase price, but is silent as to any \r\n  interest earned.Â  Without resorting to equitable remedies, no remedy exists \r\n  to prevent the County from reaping a benefit from its own mistakes.Â  \r\nThe County argues that, pursuant to Santee Cooper \r\n  Resort, Inc. v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, 298 S.C. 179, \r\n  185, 379 S.E.2d 119, 123&nbsp;(1989),Â  â€œ[t]he courtâ€™s equitable powers must \r\n  yield in the face of an unambiguously worded statute.â€Â  However, in Santee \r\n  Cooper Resort, Inc., the supreme court found an adequate legal remedy existed \r\n  when it was confronted by clear â€œstatutory alternatives adequately enabl[ing] \r\n  the Consumer Advocate to achieve the goal of consumer protection.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\n  This is in sharp contrast to the case at hand.Â  Here, the statute contains no \r\n  statutory provision addressing the issue of interest, and without resorting \r\n  to equity, no remedy would exist.Â  It is an equitable maxim that â€œ[e]quity will \r\n  not suffer a wrong without a remedy.â€Â  Lane v. New York Life Ins. Co.,&nbsp;147 \r\n  S.C. 333, 369, 145 S.E. 196, 207&nbsp;(1928); see also State ex rel. \r\n  Daniel v. Strong, 185 S.C. 27, 43, 192 S.E. 671, 678 (1937) (â€œ[E]quity abhors \r\n  a wrong without a remedy.â€).Â  Where, as here, a wrong has been suffered, and \r\n  no adequate legal remedy exists, it is well within the courtâ€™s powers to fashion \r\n  an equitable remedy. \r\nIn this case, the master-in-equity used the equitable \r\n  remedy of restitution to disgorge from the County the interest it earned on \r\n  the biddersâ€™ money.Â  In order to recover under a theory of restitution, the \r\n  bidders must show: (1) they conferred a non-gratuitous benefit on the County; \r\n  (2) the County realized some value from the benefit; and (3) it would be inequitable \r\n  for the County to retain the benefit without paying the bidders for its value.Â  \r\n  Sauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of South Carolina, 354 S.C. 397, 409, 581 \r\n  S.E.2d 161, 167&nbsp;(2003).\r\nIn the case at hand, the bidders clearly meet the \r\n  first two elements of restitution: (1) the bidders paid for real property expecting \r\n  to gain title; and (2) the County received $28,010.93 in interest while holding \r\n  the biddersâ€™ money.Â  As to the third element, the County argues that no inequity \r\n  occurred because a clear and disclosed term of the tax sale was that, in the \r\n  event the sale was voided, the bidder would not receive interest on the bid \r\n  price.Â Â Â  Importantly, however, the County never argued that this notice estops \r\n  the bidders from claiming that they are entitled to interest.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  we do not believe that the bidders should be precluded from pursuing their equitable \r\n  entitlement to interest merely because the County, apparently relying on section \r\n  12-51-150â€™s silence, notified bidders that no interest would be awarded in the \r\n  event the sale was voided.\r\nBalancing all the equities, we find that, in spite \r\n  of the Countyâ€™s notice to bidders, it would be unjust to allow the County to \r\n  keep the interest on the purchase prices of tax sales that were voided due to \r\n  the Countyâ€™s own errors and omissions.Â  To reward the County for its own internal \r\n  errors would discourage the County from carefully conducting tax sales.Â  Further, \r\n  because the amount of interest earned is determined in part by the amount of \r\n  time the County retains a bidderâ€™s purchase price, the County would have little \r\n  incentive to promptly return the bidderâ€™s money after a tax sale is voided.Â Â  \r\n  Thus, equity dictates that bidders, not the County, are entitled to the interest \r\n  their money actually earns while in the possession of the County when a tax \r\n  sale is voided.\r\nAccordingly, the master-in-equityâ€™s decision to award $28,010.93 \r\n  in restitution is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3858","title":"O'Braitis v.

Polk, both of Columbia, \r\n  for Appellant.\r\nDemetri K. Koutrakos, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.: Â Â Â  Charlotte Oâ€™Braitis brought \r\n  this action seeking the partition of real property and an accounting for rents \r\n  and profits against her sister, Catheryne Ruth Oâ€™Braitis, alleging Catheryne \r\n  ousted her from a piece of real property the two parties own.Â  Charlotte appeals \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s order granting the partition but denying her request for expenses \r\n  and rents caused by Catheryneâ€™s alleged ouster.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nCharlotte and Catheryneâ€™s father \r\n  passed away on April 19, 1997, and left his home to his four children in equal \r\n  shares.Â  Two of the siblings gave their share of the property to Catheryne, \r\n  who had lived in the home assisting her father since 1983.Â  Charlotte, who resides \r\n  in California, retained her one-quarter share of the property.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nUpon learning of her fatherâ€™s death, Charlotte \r\n  and her domestic partner, Dr. Weissman, visited the subject property for the \r\n  first time since 1983.Â  The day after her fatherâ€™s funeral, Charlotte and Dr. \r\n  Weissman began going through the home in order to find Charlotteâ€™s personal \r\n  belongings.Â  While they attempted to find her things, Charlotte testified that \r\n  her siblings hovered over her and that her brother became verbally abusive and \r\n  confrontational.Â  Because of her brotherâ€™s behavior, Charlotte called the sheriffâ€™s \r\n  office.Â  The officer, acting on his own volition and without any instruction \r\n  from Catheryne, ordered Charlotte and Dr. Weissman off of the property and issued \r\n  a trespassing warrant under which Charlotte and Dr. Weissman were not allowed \r\n  on the property for six months.\r\nApproximately one year later, Charlotte and Dr. \r\n  Weissman visited the property for the purpose of reviewing personal property \r\n  of her fatherâ€™s estate. Charlotte testified that Catheryne did not welcome her \r\n  on the property; however, the evidence shows that Catheryne did not deny Charlotte \r\n  access to the property. [1] Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn September 1998, Charlotte and Dr. Weissman returned \r\n  to the property again for the purpose of reviewing personal property of the \r\n  estate.Â  During this visit, Catheryne hired a Richland County police officer \r\n  to keep things under control.Â  The officer testified that Charlotte walked into \r\n  the house without knocking and went through the personal property without supervision.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn April 1999, Charlotte filed an action against \r\n  her siblings in probate court, seeking an accounting, termination of the appointment \r\n  of the personal representative, and other relief.Â  In the probate action, Charlotte \r\n  alleged Catheryne interfered with and obstructed her right to enter the subject \r\n  property and sought to recoup money she spent on attorneyâ€™s fees and other expenses \r\n  incurred during the probate of her fatherâ€™s estate.Â  The parties later entered \r\n  into an agreement pursuant to section 62-3-912 of the South Carolina code, and \r\n  the probate court action was then dismissed with prejudice on June 1, 2000, \r\n  pursuant to an order of dismissal to which all parties consented. \r\nOn August 4, 2000, Charlotte brought this action \r\n  for a partition and an accounting of rents and profits based on Catheryneâ€™s \r\n  ouster of her from the property.Â  Catheryne asserted counterclaims for partition \r\n  and accounting and alleged Charlotteâ€™s claims were barred by res judicata.Â  \r\n  The case was referred to the master-in-equity.Â  The master issued an order granting \r\n  partition, denying compensation for ouster, and allowing Catheryne to purchase \r\n  Charlotteâ€™s portion of the property for the net price (after offsets) of $2,264.31. \r\n  Â Charlotte filed a motion to reconsider, which the master denied.Â  This \r\n  appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA partition action, as well as an action \r\n  for accounting, is an action in equity.Â  In an appeal from an equitable action, \r\n  this court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance with its own view of \r\n  the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Doe v. Clark, 318 S.C. 274, 276, \r\n  457 S.E.2d 336, 337 (1995).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require \r\n  this court to disregard the findings at trial or ignore the fact that the trial \r\n  judge was in a better position to assess the credibility of the witnesses.Â  \r\n  Dorchester County Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOuster \r\nCharlotte first argues the master erred in finding \r\n  that Catheryne was not obligated to pay the expenses she incurred and the rent \r\n  that she lost during the time she was allegedly ousted from the property.Â  We \r\n  disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œâ€˜Ousterâ€™ is the actual turning out or keeping \r\n  excluded a party entitled to possession of any real property.â€Â  Freeman v. \r\n  Freeman, 323 S.C. 95, 99, 473 S.E.2d 467, 470 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œBy actual \r\n  ouster is not meant a physical eviction, but a possession attended with such \r\n  circumstances as to evince a claim of exclusive right and title and a denial \r\n  of the right of the other tenants to participate in the profits.â€Â  Woods \r\n  v. Bivens, 292 S.C. 76, 80, 354 S.E.2d 909, 912 (1987).Â  Freeman \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\nThe acts relied upon to establish an ouster must be of an \r\n  unequivocal nature, and so distinctly hostile to the rights of the other cotenants \r\n  that the intention to disseize is clear and unmistakable.Â  Only in rare, extreme \r\n  cases will the ouster by one cotenant of other cotenants be implied from exclusive \r\n  possession and dealings with the property, such as collection of rents and improvement \r\n  of the property.Â Â  \r\n\r\n323 S.C. at 99, 473 S.E.2d at 470 (citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nCharlotte argues that Catheryne ousted her from \r\n  the property by (1) refusing to give her a key to the property; [2]  (2) not allowing her unfettered access to the \r\n  property; and (3) acquiescing in the trespass warrant issued by the police officer.Â  \r\n  Charlotte contends these actions closely resemble those of the defendant in \r\n  Parker v. Shecut, 349 S.C. 226, 562 S.E.2d 620 (2002).Â  In Parker, \r\n  a sister brought suit against her brother alleging he ousted her from a beach \r\n  house they inherited jointly from their mother.Â  The supreme court found an \r\n  ouster had occurred based on evidence that the brother changed the locks to \r\n  the house, refused to give his sister a working key, and otherwise denied his \r\n  sister access to the property.Â  Id. at 230-31, 562 S.E.2d at 623.Â  \r\nWe find the present case differs significantly \r\n  from Parker. It is uncontested that Catheryne allowed Charlotte access \r\n  to the property every time she visited.Â  In fact, on all three of Charlotteâ€™s \r\n  visits to the property, she and Dr. Weissman walked freely through the house, \r\n  looking at and going through personal property.Â  According to the police officer, \r\n  when Charlotte and Dr. Weissman arrived for the September 1998 visit, â€œ[t]hey \r\n  came to the front door, just walked straight on in, no knock at all, whatsoever.â€Â  \r\n  The officer also stated they â€œwent around the house by themselvesâ€ and â€œwere \r\n  going through every bit of the property.â€Â  This is hardly a denial of access \r\n  to the property. \r\nFurthermore, any acquiescence by Catheryne in \r\n  the trespass warrant of April 1997 is not enough to support a finding of ouster.Â  \r\n  It is important to note that Charlotte, not Catheryne, was the one who called \r\n  an officer to the scene when the altercation ensued between Charlotte and her \r\n  siblings.Â  Because Charlotte enlisted the help of an outside party to settle \r\n  the dispute, she cannot now attribute the effect of the trespass warrant to \r\n  Catheryne.Â  Based on all the above, we find Catheryneâ€™s actions toward Charlotte \r\n  do not amount to ouster.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Not only do we hold no ouster occurred, \r\n  we also hold Charlotteâ€™s claim for an accounting is barred by res judicata, \r\n  or more specifically, issue preclusion.Â  Under the doctrine of issue preclusion, \r\n  if an issue of fact or law was actually litigated and determined and necessary \r\n  to a valid and final judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent \r\n  action on that claim or a different claim.Â  Carman v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage \r\n  Control Commâ€™n, 317 S.C. 1, 6, 451 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1994).Â  \r\nHere, Charlotte filed a petition in probate court \r\n  seeking an accounting for the attorneyâ€™s fees and expenses she incurred while \r\n  traveling between California and South Carolina.Â  Charlotte also alleged in \r\n  the probate court action that she was entitled to rent from Catheryne because \r\n  Catheryne interfered with her right to enter the property. Â Thus, in the probate \r\n  court action, just as in the present action, Charlotte sought the expenses she \r\n  incurred and the rent she lost during the time she was allegedly denied access \r\n  to the property.Â  In fact, Charlotte even admitted while testifying in the present \r\n  action that she had filed a complaint against Catheryne in probate court raising \r\n  the same issues that she raises in this action. \r\nThe probate court dismissed the action with prejudice \r\n  pursuant to an order of dismissal to which the parties consented.Â  A dismissal \r\n  with prejudice acts as an adjudication on the merits and therefore precludes \r\n  subsequent litigation just as if the action had been tried to a final adjudication.Â  \r\n  Jones v. City of Folly Beach, 326 S.C. 360, 366, 483 S.E.2d 770, 773 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In a subsequent action involving the same subject matter, \r\n  the dismissal finally settles all matters litigated in the earlier proceedings, \r\n  and all matters which might have been litigated therein.Â  Nunnery v. Brantley \r\n  Constr. Co, 289 S.C. 205, 209, 345 S.E.2d 740, 743 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  Because \r\n  Charlotte raised the same issue in the probate action and that issue was necessary \r\n  to and determined in an adjudication on the merits, she is precluded from raising \r\n  the issue again in this action.Â  \r\nCharlotte attempts to make a distinction between \r\n  the issues raised to the probate court and the trial court by arguing that, \r\n  in the probate court action, she sought access to the subject property for \r\n  the purpose of inspecting the personal property only because that is the only \r\n  relief available in Probate Court. Â We find this argument unconvincing.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a fundamental principle of jurisprudence that material \r\n  facts or questions which were directly in issue in a former action, and were \r\n  there admitted or judicially determined, are conclusively settled by a judgment \r\n  rendered therein, and that such facts or questions become res judicata \r\n  and may not again be litigated in a subsequent action between the same parties \r\n  or their privies, regardless of the form that the issue may take in the subsequent \r\n  action.Â  \r\n. . .\r\nThe rule will also apply even though the subsequent action \r\n  is upon a different cause of action, and involves a different subject matter, \r\n  claim, or demand, than the earlier action.Â  In such cases, it is likewise \r\n  immaterial that the two actions have a different scope, or are \r\n  based on different grounds, or are tried on different theories, \r\n  or are instituted for different purposes, and seek different relief.\r\n\r\n46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments Â§ 539 (1994) (emphasis \r\n  added).Â Â  \r\nTherefore, Charlotteâ€™s argument that, in the probate \r\n  action, she only sought access to the property for the purpose of inspecting \r\n  personal property is not enough to allow her present claim for ouster to go \r\n  forward.Â  In addition, this distinction fails because Charlotte testified that \r\n  all her visits to the property were for the purpose of inspecting personal property.Â  \r\n  She cannot now claim that she wanted access to the property for any other reason \r\n  than to inspect the personal property of her fatherâ€™s estate.Â  It is clear that \r\n  she raised the same issue in both the probate court and the trial court.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Charlotteâ€™s claim that she is due an accounting based on Catheryneâ€™s ouster \r\n  is barred by res judicata.Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Trial Courtâ€™s Calculation of the Net Price \r\n  for Charlotteâ€™s Share of the PropertyÂ  \r\nCharlotte next argues the trial court incorrectly \r\n  calculated the net price Catheryne should pay for Charlotteâ€™s share of the property \r\n  by crediting Catheryne for the amount the property increased in value due to \r\n  Catheryneâ€™s improvements to the property.Â  We find the trial court correctly \r\n  determined the net price.Â  \r\nCatheryne spent approximately $9,859.80 in making \r\n  improvements to the property, such as renovating the living room, dining room, \r\n  and the kitchen.Â  Catheryne testified that due to the improvements, the property \r\n  increased in value from $53,000 to $55,000.Â  Charlotte argues Catheryne should \r\n  not receive credit for the $2,000 increase because Catheryne made these improvements \r\n  unilaterally, and thus, at her own risk.Â  It is immaterial that Catheryne made \r\n  these improvements without Charlotteâ€™s consent.Â  As our court explained in Ackerman \r\n  v. Heard: \r\n\r\nThe general rule is that a joint tenant who, at his own expense, \r\n  places permanent improvements upon the common property is entitled in a partition \r\n  suit to compensation for the improvements whether his cotenants assented thereto \r\n  or not.Â  Compensation is allowed not as a matter of legal right but purely from \r\n  the desire of a court of equity to do justice and to prevent the one tenant \r\n  from becoming enriched at the expense of another.Â  In the absence of consent, \r\n  which we did not have in the case before us, the amount of compensation is estimated \r\n  by and limited to the amount by which the value of the common property \r\n  has been enhanced.Â  \r\n\r\n287 S.C. 626, 628-29, 340 S.E.2d 560, 562 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1986) (emphasis in original).Â  Because the improvements to the property \r\n  increased the value of the property by $2,000, the trial court properly gave \r\n  Catheryne $2,000 in credit.Â  While we agree with the trial judgeâ€™s decision \r\n  to reimburse Catheryne for the improvements to the property, we point out a \r\n  clarification in the amount Catheryne must pay Charlotte.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  order misstated the amount of increase in value to be $2,500, but his later \r\n  order denying Charlotteâ€™s motion to reconsider corrected the error.Â  However, \r\n  the trial court did not specifically correct the net price to be paid to Catheryne \r\n  based on an increase in value of $2,000.Â  To clarify this issue for the parties, \r\n  we find that Catheryne must pay Charlotte $2,764.31 for her share of the property \r\n  based on an increase in the fair market value of the property of $2,000, and \r\n  taking into consideration the trial courtâ€™s calculations for taxes, insurance, \r\n  and attorneyâ€™s fees.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\n Charlotte claims the trial court erred \r\n  in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees to Catheryne because Charlotte was required to bring \r\n  this action based on Catheryneâ€™s ouster.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe determination of whether to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in partition actions rests within the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  \r\n  S&amp;W Corp. of Inman v. Wells, 283 S.C. 218, 220, 321 S.E.2d 183, 185 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The trial court may â€œfix attorneysâ€™ fees in all partition \r\n  proceedings and, as may be equitable, assess such fees against any or all of \r\n  the parties in interest.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-61-110 (Supp. 1976).\r\nAlthough Charlotte argues she was required to \r\n  bring this partition action because of Catheryneâ€™s ouster, as discussed above, \r\n  no ouster occurred.Â  Moreover, Catheryne was forced to defend allegations that \r\n  were previously raised and dismissed with prejudice in the probate court action.Â  \r\n  Based on the above, and giving deference to the trial court, we find the award \r\n  of attorneyâ€™s fees was proper.\r\nCONCLUSION&nbsp; \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the \r\n  trial court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSTILWELL, J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Certain incidents did occur, \r\n    however, which made Charlotte feel threatened.Â  For instance, Charlotte and \r\n    Catheryneâ€™s brother â€œgoose-steppedâ€ around the outside of the house with a \r\n    pellet gun slung over his shoulder and a Nazi flag on his back in front of \r\n    Dr. Weissman, who is Jewish. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Charlotte claims she repeatedly requested a key to the house after \r\n    her fatherâ€™s death in 1997, but Catheryne never gave her one.Â  Catheryne explained \r\n    that she did not give Charlotte a key because the estate had not yet been \r\n    settled and every time Charlotte was in the house something was broken. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3859","title":"Stark Truss Company v.

Cruickshanks, IV, of Clinton; and Steele B. Windle, \r\n  III, of Charlotte, for Appellants.\r\nPaul B.

Â National issued Superior a labor and materials payment \r\n  bond on the project. Â A dispute arose between Superior and Stark Truss \r\n  concerning the condition of the trusses provided.Â  Superior refused to pay in \r\n  full for the materials, and Stark Truss refused to deliver the remaining materials \r\n  without full payment. Â Superior obtained replacement materials from another \r\n  supplier. Â In June 2002, Stark Truss filed a $49,799 payment bond claim \r\n  with National for the remaining balance of the purchase order price.Â  National \r\n  denied Stark Trussâ€™s claim on the basis of the existence of a bona fide dispute. \r\n\r\nOn July 12, 2002, Stark Truss filed \r\n  a summons and complaint against Appellants for the remaining balance plus interest. \r\n  Â The summons and complaint were served upon Superior on July 24 and upon \r\n  National on July 26. Â National gave its defense in the matter to Superior \r\n  on August 5, 2002, apparently intending for Superior to answer on its behalf.Â  \r\n\r\nSuperior did not send a copy of \r\n  Stark Trussâ€™s summons and complaint or Nationalâ€™s suit papers to its attorneys \r\n  until September 5, 2002.Â  Upon receipt that same morning, Appellantsâ€™ attorneys \r\n  immediately telephoned Stark Trussâ€™s attorneys and requested an extension of \r\n  time in which to file an answer. Â Later that day, Appellantsâ€™ attorneys \r\n  were contacted by one of Stark Trussâ€™s attorneys and informed that default proceedings \r\n  had already begun, with the motion for entry of default judgment and affidavit \r\n  of default being mailed that morning prior to the initial call.Â  Stark Truss \r\n  denied the request for an extension. Â Â \r\nThe Appellantsâ€™ joint answer and counterclaim for \r\n  damages in excess of $75,000 was prepared, filed with the court on September \r\n  6, 2002, and served on Stark Truss.Â  Stark Trussâ€™s affidavit of default, motion \r\n  for entry of default judgment, and a proposed order directing entry of default \r\n  judgment, dated September 5, 2002, were received and filed five days later on \r\n  September 11, 2002. Â Based on Stark Trussâ€™s motion, the court issued \r\n  an order, without a hearing, simultaneously granting entry of default and a \r\n  default judgment against Appellants. \r\nOn September 12, Stark Truss served on \r\n  Appellantsâ€™ attorneys its motion to dismiss Appellantsâ€™ counterclaims, asserting \r\n  the compulsory claims were barred by the default judgment.Â  Appellants filed \r\n  a â€œMotion to Set Aside Entry of Default Judgmentâ€ on October 22, 2002, in which \r\n  Appellants argued both the entry of default and default judgment should be set \r\n  aside.Â  At the motions hearing, Appellants argued that because they filed an \r\n  answer and counterclaim prior to the courtâ€™s receipt of the motion for entry \r\n  of default and default judgment, they had appeared in the matter, rendering \r\n  the facts supporting the motion for default judgment inaccurate.Â  Appellants \r\n  also asserted that because they had appeared, entry of default was improper \r\n  and required the entry of default judgment to be set aside.Â  Appellantsâ€™ attorney \r\n  informed the circuit court that there was no good explanation for not filing \r\n  an answer within thirty days, other than the fact that Superiorâ€™s president \r\n  was â€œstruggling with some depression and a lot of things slipped through his \r\n  fingers.â€Â Â  \r\nOn November 15, 2002, the circuit \r\n  court issued an order holding that Appellants had failed to present sufficient \r\n  proof of either â€œgood causeâ€ for relief from default under Rule 55(c), SCRCP, \r\n  or â€œmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglectâ€ under Rule 60(b), \r\n  SCRCP sufficient to vacate the entry of default judgment.Â  Since the counterclaims \r\n  were compulsory and the answer was not timely filed, the court also granted \r\n  Stark Trussâ€™s motion to dismiss all counterclaims.Â  Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe decision whether to set aside an entry \r\n  of default or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge.Â  Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  900, 902-903 (1989); Wham v. Shearson Lehman Bros., Inc., 298 S.C. 462, \r\n  465, 381 S.E.2d 499, 502 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  This decision will not be reversed \r\n  absent an abuse of that discretion.Â  Thompson, 299 S.C. at 119, 382 S.E.2d \r\n  at 902-903; In Re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251, 259, 495 S.E.2d 454, \r\n  459 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the order was controlled \r\n  by an error of law or when the order is without evidentiary support.Â  Id. \r\n  Â Â \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nA.\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred in entering \r\n  default and in refusing to set aside the entry of default because they appeared \r\n  in the matter by filing their answer and counterclaim prior to the filing of \r\n  the motion for entry of default.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nA determination in this case requires an evaluation \r\n  of Rule 55, SCRCP regarding default judgments.Â  When interpreting a court rule, \r\n  â€œwe apply the same rules of construction used in interpreting statutes.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the words of [the rule] must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without \r\n  resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the rule.â€Â  Green \r\n  v. Lewis Truck Lines, Inc., 314 S.C. 303, 304, 443 S.E.2d 906, 907 (1994).Â  \r\n  When the language of a court rule is clear and unambiguous, the court is obligated \r\n  to follow its plain and ordinary meaning.Â  \r\nUnless an extension is granted, a defendant must \r\n  serve his answer within thirty days â€œafter the service of the complaint upon \r\n  him.â€Â  Rule 12(a), SCRCP.Â  If a party has failed to â€œplead or otherwise defend [1]  as provided by [the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure] and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise,â€ \r\n  the clerk of court will enter default.Â  Rule 55(a), SCRCP.Â  Entry of default \r\n  is a ministerial act which a clerk is required to perform once default is made \r\n  to appear by the affidavit of the moving party.Â  See Thynes v. Lloyd, \r\n  294 S.C. 152, 153-54, 363 S.E.2d 122, 123 (Ct. App. 1987) (holding that â€œwhether \r\n  default was actually entered is of no consequence since the entry of default \r\n  is a purely ministerial act which the clerk was required to perform once the \r\n  default was made to appear by the affidavitâ€ of the moving party).Â  \r\nAppellants initially argue the circuit court erred in entering \r\n  default.Â  Although Appellantsâ€™ late answer amounted to a â€œpleadingâ€ filed prior \r\n  to entry of default, it did not comply with the time requirements of Rule 12(a), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  Appellants clearly failed to file an answer within thirty days of service \r\n  of the summons and complaint upon them and they were technically in default.Â  \r\n  Thus, Appellantsâ€™ answer was not a valid pleading or defense â€œas provided byâ€ \r\n  the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  A plain reading of Rule 55(a) allows entry of \r\n  default when a pleading or defense is asserted in a manner noncompliant with \r\n  the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  To hold otherwise would render the requirements \r\n  in Rule 12(a), SCRCP, meaningless.Â  We find the courtâ€™s entry of default was \r\n  proper.\r\nAppellants point to cases from other jurisdictions holding \r\n  that entry of default is improper if even a late answer is filed prior to entry \r\n  of default.Â  See, e.g., Moore v. Sullivan, 473 S.E.2d 659, \r\n  660 (N.C. Ct. App. 1996) (â€œAfter an answer has been filed, even if the answer \r\n  is untimely filed, a default may not be entered.â€).Â  That is not the current \r\n  law in this state.Â  Further, filing a late answer would not alter the fact that \r\n  Appellants were in default, especially if entering default is a ministerial \r\n  act to be automatically performed once an affidavit shows the defendant has \r\n  failed to comply with the requirements of the rules.Â  Thynes, 294 S.C. \r\n  at 153-54, 363 S.E.2d at 123.Â  \r\nAppellants also argue the circuit court erred in \r\n  denying their motion to set aside the entry of default.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 55(c), SCRCP, allows the circuit court to \r\n  set aside an entry of default â€œfor good cause shown.â€Â  Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  â€œIn \r\n  deciding whether good cause exists, the trial court should consider the following \r\n  factors: (1) the timing of the defendantâ€™s motion for relief; (2) whether the \r\n  defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of prejudice to the \r\n  plaintiff if relief is granted.â€Â  Pilgrim v. Miller, 350 S.C. 637, 640, \r\n  567 S.E.2d 527, 528 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. dismissed (April 25, 2003).Â  \r\n  Whether to grant relief from entry of default is a decision within the sound \r\n  discretion of the circuit court.Â  Wham, 298 S.C. at 465, 381 S.E.2d at \r\n  502.Â  In reviewing the courtâ€™s exercise of discretion, the issue before the \r\n  appellate court is not whether it believes good cause existed to set aside the \r\n  default, â€œbut rather, whether the [trial judgeâ€™s] determination is supportable \r\n  by the evidence and not controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Pilgrim, 350 \r\n  S.C. at 640-41, 567 S.E.2d at 528.Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ motion for relief from entry of default \r\n  was filed over a month after the circuit court entered default judgment.Â  They \r\n  argued that the entry of default should be set aside because they appeared prior \r\n  to entry of default.Â  The attorney for Appellants informed the circuit court \r\n  that Superiorâ€™s president had no good reason, other than depression, for failing \r\n  to act when he was served with the summons and complaint.Â  The attorney did \r\n  not give any reason for Nationalâ€™s failure to serve and file its answer to the \r\n  summons and complaint.Â  Based on these facts, we find there was evidence to \r\n  support the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to set aside the entry of default.Â Â Â  \r\nB.\r\nAppellants argue that because they filed a late \r\n  answer, they made an â€œappearanceâ€ in the action and entry of default judgment \r\n  was improper.Â  They further argue that the circuit court erred in refusing to \r\n  set aside the default judgment.Â  We agree.\r\nRule 55(b)(1), SCRCP, entitled â€œCases Involving Liquidated \r\n  Damages or Sum Certain,â€ provides that where the amount sought is a sum certain \r\n  and the defaulting party has not made an appearance, the judge may enter \r\n  default judgment for the amount sought without holding a hearing.Â  Rule 55(b)(2), \r\n  entitled â€œAll Other Cases,â€ provides, in pertinent part, that a party who has \r\n  â€œappearedâ€ in the action is entitled to notice and a hearing before judgment \r\n  by default may be entered.Â  A party may seek relief from a default judgment \r\n  for mistake, inadvertence, newly discovered evidence, fraud or other misconduct, \r\n  where the judgment is void, or where the judgment has been satisfied.Â  Rule \r\n  60(b), SCRCP.Â Â  \r\nWhether Appellantsâ€™ late answer amounted to an \r\n  â€œappearanceâ€ in this case is a critical question.Â  This court has previously \r\n  discussed whether a late filing constitutes an â€œappearance.â€Â  In Dymon v. \r\n  Hyman, 305 S.C. 170, 406 S.E.2d 388 (Ct. App. 1991), the defendant filed \r\n  and served his answer late, and the plaintiff acknowledged service of the late \r\n  answer.Â  However, the plaintiff informed the defendant that he considered the \r\n  defendant to be in default.Â  Two months later, the plaintiff sought and obtained \r\n  a judgment by default without giving notice to the defendant.Â  The defendant \r\n  learned of the default judgment months later, and the circuit court denied the \r\n  motion for relief from judgment.Â  Interpreting the prior version of Rule 55(b)(1), [2]  this court held that the defendantâ€™s late answer \r\n  was an â€œappearanceâ€ and thus the defendant was entitled to notice and a hearing \r\n  on the motion for default judgment.Â  Because no notice was given, this court \r\n  reversed the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to set aside the void judgment.Â  Dymon, \r\n  305 S.C. at 171, 406 S.E.2d at 389.Â  \r\nAppellants in the present case clearly filed their answer \r\n  and counterclaims more than thirty days after they were served with the summons \r\n  and complaint.Â  However, as in Dymon, Appellantsâ€™ late answer, filed \r\n  before Stark Trussâ€™s motions were received by the circuit court, constituted \r\n  an appearance in the matter.Â  Appellants were entitled to notice and a hearing \r\n  before judgment by default was entered.Â  Dymon, 305 S.C. at 171-72, 406 \r\n  S.E.2d at 389.Â  Because no notice was given and no hearing was held, the default \r\n  judgment was void.Â  The circuit court erred in refusing to relieve Appellants \r\n  from the void judgment.Â  Id.; see also Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP (â€œOn \r\n  motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may relieve a party or his \r\n  legal representative from a final judgment, order, or proceeding [where] . . \r\n  . the judgment is void.â€).\r\nC.\r\nAppellants assert the circuit court erred in granting \r\n  Stark Trussâ€™s motion to dismiss their counterclaims as compulsory.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe circuit court found, and Appellants do not \r\n  dispute, that the counterclaims asserted with the late answer were compulsory.Â  \r\n  Rule 13(a), SCRCP, provides that compulsory counterclaims must be asserted along \r\n  with a responsive pleading.Â  As Appellants were in default and failed to timely \r\n  file and serve their answer, they also failed to timely assert their counterclaims.Â  \r\n  In this instance, we find the circuit court did not err in dismissing the Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  counterclaims.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellants failed to timely serve and file their answer and \r\n  compulsory counterclaims on Stark Truss pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  \r\n  Thus, the entry of default was proper, the circuit courtâ€™s refusal to set aside \r\n  the entry of default was supported by the evidence, and the dismissal of Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  compulsory counterclaims was proper.Â  However, as Appellants made an appearance \r\n  in this action by filing a late answer, they were entitled to notice before \r\n  entry of default judgment.Â  The circuit courtâ€™s refusal to set aside the void \r\n  default judgment was error.Â  We reverse the refusal to set aside the default \r\n  judgment and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  â€œThe words â€˜otherwise defendâ€™ refer to the interposition of various \r\n    challenges to such matters as service, venue, and the sufficiency of the prior \r\n    pleading, any of which might prevent a default if pursued in the absence of \r\n    a responsive pleading.â€Â  10A Charles Allen Wright, Arthur R.

[1] Â  For the reasons set forth below, we vacate \r\n  Leeâ€™s convictions.\r\nFACTS \r\nDiana Baldwin married Larry Lee on August 29, 1982.Â  After they married, Diana, \r\n  Lee, Dianaâ€™s two daughters, who were six and seven years old, and her one-year-old \r\n  son moved into a home in Aiken.Â  In the latter part of 1988, the Department \r\n  of Social Services (DSS) began an investigation when Leeâ€™s stepdaughters alleged \r\n  that he had sexually abused them.Â  The allegations of abuse first arose during \r\n  a juvenile criminal investigation being conducted against the stepdaughters \r\n  by law enforcement officers.Â  As a result of the investigation, DSS removed \r\n  the girls from the home on September 15, 1988, and placed them in the custody \r\n  of their aunt on an emergency basis until a hearing could be held in the family \r\n  court.Â  Within two to three months, DSS returned the girls to their home.Â  Diana \r\n  and Lee ultimately divorced in September of 1992. \r\nThough the solicitorâ€™s office represented the State during all hearings before \r\n  the family court, the State took no further action on the matter for more than \r\n  twelve years after the childrenâ€™s return home.Â  On May 14, 2001, an Aiken County \r\n  grand jury indicted Lee for four counts of first-degree CSC with a minor and \r\n  one count of lewd act upon a child, all arising from the allegations involving \r\n  the stepdaughters.Â  Around this same time, Lee was indicted for additional counts \r\n  of CSC with a minor for incidents that occurred with different victims, including \r\n  a niece, between 1985 and 1988 and in 1999. \r\n  [2] \r\nOn May 17-21, 2001, Lee was tried only on the indictments involving the stepdaughters.Â  \r\n  Based on the delay, Leeâ€™s counsel requested at the pre-trial hearing that the \r\n  court dismiss these indictments.Â  During the pre-trial hearing, Leeâ€™s counsel \r\n  informed the judge the State was aware of the charges in 1988 but did not arrest \r\n  Lee until March 2001 and did not indict him until May 2001.Â  According to Leeâ€™s \r\n  counsel, the DSS worker who was involved in the case wrote a letter on January \r\n  6, 1989, stating DSS â€œbelieved there was criminal activityâ€ and requested law \r\n  enforcement make an investigation into the criminal matter.Â  Leeâ€™s counsel also \r\n  stated she was unable to locate records to determine whether this investigation \r\n  had taken place.Â  Because the State was aware of potential criminal charges \r\n  against Lee in 1988 and did not bring them until the 1999 charges involving \r\n  Leeâ€™s niece, counsel argued the charges involving the stepdaughters should be \r\n  dismissed.Â  She contended Lee suffered substantial prejudice as a result of \r\n  the Stateâ€™s â€œnegligentâ€ delay in bringing the charges.Â  She claimed Lee was \r\n  prejudiced due to the destruction of crucial records, the absence of witnesses, \r\n  and the witnessesâ€™ inability to recall the alleged incidents in detail.Â Â  \r\nSpecifically, counsel pointed out that the subject \r\n  matter of the original investigation against the stepdaughters could not be \r\n  determined given the DSS file had been destroyed and the juvenile officer who \r\n  originally reported the matter to DSS recalled no details of the investigation.Â  \r\n  In similar fashion, the stepdaughtersâ€™ school records were no longer available.Â  \r\n  In addition, the attorney that originally represented Lee before the family \r\n  court no longer practiced law in South Carolina and could not be located.Â  Based \r\n  on these hindrances, Leeâ€™s counsel moved for the trial judge to dismiss the \r\n  indictments because the delay in indicting Lee had affected his ability to mount \r\n  an adequate defense.Â  Though the State offered no explanation for the delay \r\n  of more than twelve years, it countered that Lee offered no evidence the State \r\n  intentionally delayed prosecution of the charges. \r\nAt the conclusion of the hearing, the judge denied \r\n  Leeâ€™s speedy trial motion, but stated there â€œmay be a 5th Amendment right for \r\n  pre-indictment or pre-arrest matter, but the law seems to indicate that one, \r\n  there has to beâ€”show prejudice and two you have to show intention on the part \r\n  of the government to try and . . . put the individual in a worse position.â€ \r\n  Â The judge then denied the motion.\r\nThe day of the trial, Leeâ€™s counsel renewed her \r\n  motion.Â  She argued Leeâ€™s right to a fair trial had been compromised by the \r\n  â€œexcessive delay on the part of the State.â€Â  The judge again denied the motion, \r\n  stating â€œthe 6th Amendment, the right begins at the time of arrest or indictment \r\n  and if youâ€™re alleging on the 5th Amendment, then youâ€™ve got to show prejudice \r\n  . . . and you also got to show there was some intent on the part of the State \r\n  to put you in a position, a disadvantage.â€  \r\n  [3]  \r\nThe jury convicted Lee of four counts of first-degree \r\n  CSC with a minor and one count of lewd act upon a child.Â  The judge sentenced \r\n  Lee to an aggregate of forty-five years imprisonment.Â  Lee appeals his convictions \r\n  and sentences.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nLee argues his convictions should be vacated because of the excessive pre-indictment \r\n  delay.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œThe Due Process Clause plays a limited role in protecting against oppressive \r\n  pre-indictment delay.â€ State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 72, 480 S.E.2d \r\n  64, 68 (1997); see United States v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783, 789-90 \r\n  (1977) (analyzing Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment with respect to \r\n  pre-indictment delay); United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324 (1971) \r\n  (recognizing Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment provides basis for dismissing \r\n  indictment as a result of pre-indictment delay). \r\nIn Brazell, our supreme court considered \r\n  the issue of pre-indictment delay.Â  In its analysis, the court relied on decisions \r\n  of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.Â  The court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n  The United States Supreme Court has developed a two-prong inquiry when pre-indictment \r\n    delay is alleged to violate due process.Â  First, the defendant has the burden \r\n    of proving the pre-indictment delay caused substantial actual prejudice to \r\n    his right to a fair trial.Â  Second, if the defendant shows actual prejudice, \r\n    the court must consider the prosecutionâ€™s reasons for the delay and balance \r\n    the justification for delay with any prejudice to the defendant.Â  If the court \r\n    finds the delay was an intentional device to gain a tactical advantage over \r\n    the accused, the court should dismiss the indictment. Id.; Howell \r\n    v. Barker, 904 F.2d 889 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1016, \r\n    111 S. Ct. 590, 112 L.Ed.2d 595 (1990); United States v. Automated Medical \r\n    Laboratories, Inc., 770 F.2d 399 (4th Cir. 1985).Â  When balancing \r\n    the prejudice and the justification, â€œ[t]he basic inquiry then becomes whether \r\n    the governmentâ€™s action in prosecuting after substantial delay violates â€˜fundamental \r\n    conceptions of justiceâ€™ or â€˜the communityâ€™s sense of fair play and decency.â€™â€Â  \r\n    Howell, 904 F.2d at 895 (quoting United States v. Automated Medical \r\n    Laboratories, Inc., 770 F.2d 399, 404 (4th Cir.1985)).\r\n\r\nBrazell, 325 S.C. at 72-73, 480 S.E.2d at \r\n  68-69.\r\nReliance on the Fourth Circuitâ€™s interpretation of the pre-indictment delay \r\n  test is significant in that it applies a less stringent standard as compared \r\n  to other federal circuits. Â See Jones v. Angelone, 94 F.3d 900, \r\n  905 (4th Cir. 1996) (recognizing that federal circuits, with the \r\n  exception of the Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, have held that â€œin order \r\n  to establish that a lengthy pre-indictment delay rises to the level of a due \r\n  process violation, a defendant must show not only actual substantial prejudice, \r\n  but also that â€˜the government intentionally delayed the indictment to gain an \r\n  unfair tactical advantage for other bad faith motivesâ€™â€ (quoting United States \r\n  v. Crooks, 766 F.2d 7, 11 (1st Cir.), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 996 \r\n  (1985))).\r\nUnder the Fourth Circuitâ€™s standard, a defendant \r\n  who meets the initial burden of proving substantial actual prejudice does not \r\n  have to further prove improper prosecutorial motive as the cause for the delay.Â  \r\n  Howell v. Barker, 904 F.2d 889, 894-95 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \r\n  498 U.S. 1016 (1990).Â  In rejecting the decisions from the majority of the federal \r\n  circuits, the Fourth Circuit reasoned as follows:\r\n\r\n  Taking this position to its logical conclusion would mean that no matter \r\n    how egregious the prejudice to a defendant, and no matter how long the preindictment \r\n    delay, if a defendant cannot prove improper prosecutorial motive, then no \r\n    due process violation has occurred.Â  This conclusion, on its face, would violate \r\n    fundamental conceptions of justice, as well as the communityâ€™s sense of fair \r\n    play.Â  Moreover, this conclusion does not contemplate the difficulty defendants \r\n    either have encountered or will encounter in attempting to prove improper \r\n    prosecutorial motive.Â  \r\n\r\nHowell, 904 F.2d at 895.\r\nDespite the clear reliance on Fourth Circuit precedent in Brazell, the \r\n  State contends our supreme court did not adopt the more lenient standard for \r\n  pre-indictment delay.Â  Instead, â€œthe State submits that the burden is on the \r\n  defendant to show that the delay was intentional and to gain a tactical advantage.â€ \r\n  Â Â We disagree with this contention.\r\nAlthough a trial court should dismiss an indictment \r\n  if the defendant shows improper prosecutorial motive for delaying indictment, \r\n  such a showing is not required for pre-indictment delay to violate due process.Â  \r\n  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 72, 480 S.E.2d at 69.Â  While a finding of improper \r\n  prosecutorial motive ends the inquiry, the absence of such a showing does not \r\n  likewise terminate the analysis.Â  Instead, the proper course is to proceed to \r\n  the two-prong inquiry applied in the Fourth Circuit in the case of United \r\n  States v. Automated Medical Laboratories, Inc., 770 F.2d 399, 403-04 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1985), and adopted by our supreme court in Brazell.Â  Under this \r\n  test, the defendant first has the burden of proving the pre-indictment delay \r\n  caused substantial actual prejudice to his right to a fair trial.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n  Second, the court must then consider the Stateâ€™s reason for the delay and balance \r\n  the justification for delay with any prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id.\r\nHere, the trial court erred as a matter of law in placing \r\n  the burden on Lee to prove substantial actual prejudice as well as the Stateâ€™s \r\n  improper motive for the delay.Â  Because the court required Lee to demonstrate \r\n  intentional delay by the State, the courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error \r\n  of law.Â  United States v. Lynch, No. 94-5350, 1995 WL 325670, at *2 (4th \r\n  Cir. June 1, 1995) (recognizing district courtâ€™s decision regarding pre-indictment \r\n  delay was a mixed question of law and fact and will only be reversed if clearly \r\n  erroneous) (citing United States v. Beszborn, 21 F.3d 62 (5th Cir. 1994), \r\n  cert. denied, Westmoreland v. United States, 513 U.S. 934 (1994)).Â  \r\n  Without this additional burden, we find Lee established that the delay caused \r\n  substantial actual prejudice.\r\nÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  In applying the first prong, â€œsubstantial \r\n  prejudiceâ€ requires a showing that the defendant â€œâ€˜was meaningfully impaired \r\n  in his ability to defend against the stateâ€™s charges to such an extent that \r\n  the disposition of the criminal proceeding was likely effected [sic].â€™â€Â  Brazell, \r\n  325 S.C. at 73, 480 S.E.2d at 69 (quoting Jones v. Angelone, 94 F.3d \r\n  900, 907 (4th Cir. 1996)).Â  â€œWhen the claimed prejudice is the unavailability \r\n  of a witness, courts require that the defendant identify the witness he would \r\n  have called; demonstrate, with specificity, the expected content of that witnessâ€™ \r\n  testimony; establish that he made serious attempts to locate the witness; and \r\n  finally, show that the information the witness would have provided was not available \r\n  from other sources.â€Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 73, 480 S.E.2d at 69.\r\nWe note Lee did more than merely rely on the length \r\n  of the delay to establish substantial actual prejudice.Â  As Leeâ€™s counsel pointed \r\n  out, the delay of twelve years presented a significant obstacle in preparing \r\n  an adequate defense and receiving a fair trial.Â  All the records from the family \r\n  court case have been destroyed.Â  No records contemporaneous with the alleged \r\n  offenses are available, particularly those explaining why the stepdaughters \r\n  were placed back into Leeâ€™s home after being removed.Â  Leeâ€™s efforts to acquire \r\n  the same information from other sources were likewise unavailing.Â  Leeâ€™s original \r\n  attorney could not be located, and the DSS investigator could recall no specifics \r\n  about the investigation.Â  Without this information, Leeâ€™s counsel could not \r\n  adequately cross-examine the victims and other family members regarding the \r\n  alleged incidents and the juvenile investigation that prompted DSS to become \r\n  involved.Â  Moreover, Leeâ€™s counsel was also prevented from refuting the delayed \r\n  disclosure evidence presented by the State through its expert witness. \r\nBecause Lee established that he was actually and \r\n  substantially prejudiced, the inquiry turns to a consideration of the Stateâ€™s \r\n  reasons for the pre-indictment delay.Â  Under the second prong of the test, the \r\n  court must balance the Stateâ€™s justification for the delay against the prejudice \r\n  to the defendant.Â  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 72, 480 S.E.2d at 68-69.Â  In \r\n  this case, the State has offered no explanation for the delay in indicting Lee.Â  \r\n  Given there is no valid justification, we find the Stateâ€™s prosecution of Lee \r\n  violated â€œâ€˜fundamental conceptions of justiceâ€™â€ and â€œâ€˜the communityâ€™s sense \r\n  of fair play and decency.â€™â€ Id. at 73, 480 S.E.2d at 69 (quoting Howell \r\n  v. Barker, 904 F.2d 889, 895 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1016 \r\n  (1990)); see Howell, 904 F.2d at 895 (affirming district courtâ€™s \r\n  finding of unconstitutional pre-indictment delay where actual prejudice was \r\n  assumed and conceded and the State failed to offer valid justification for the \r\n  pre-indictment delay that prejudiced defendant).Â  Accordingly, Leeâ€™s convictions \r\n  involving his former stepdaughters are\r\nVACATED.\r\nHEARN, C.J. and STILWELL, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  Pursuant to Anders \r\n    v.

Williams, 305 \r\n    S.C. 116, 406 S.E.2d 357 (1991), Leeâ€™s appellate counsel filed a brief along \r\n    with a petition to be relieved, stating her examination of the record indicated \r\n    the appeal was without merit.Â  Lee filed a separate pro se response.Â  \r\n    Following our Anders review, this court ordered the parties to brief \r\n    the following issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whether the trial judge erred in declining to dismiss Leeâ€™s indictments \r\n    on the ground Leeâ€™s Fifth Amendment due process rights were violated as a \r\n    result of pre-indictment delay?\r\n\r\n\r\n  This issue is now our sole appellate consideration.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Although it is not entirely clear, it appears Leeâ€™s former stepdaughters \r\n    again came forward with their allegations after being informed of the more \r\n    recent 1999 incidents.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Â Leeâ€™s counselâ€™s arguments \r\n    regarding Leeâ€™s right to a speedy trial were intertwined with her motion to \r\n    dismiss for pre-indictment delay; thus, we briefly address this issue.Â  Here, \r\n    Lee was arrested in March of 2001 and indicted and tried in May 2001.Â  Because \r\n    there was not a significant delay between the time Lee was arrested and the \r\n    time he was tried, there is no merit to his contention that he was denied \r\n    his right to a speedy trial.Â  Therefore, we concluded during our Anders \r\n    review that the judge did not err in denying the motion to dismiss on this \r\n    ground. See State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 74, 480 S.E.2d 64, \r\n    70 (1997) (The Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution \r\n    as well as Article 1, Section 14 of the South Carolina Constitution provide \r\n    that a criminal defendant is entitled to a speedy trial.); see also \r\n    United States v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 313-15 (1971) (discussing pre-indictment \r\n    delay in the context of the Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision; concluding \r\n    Sixth Amendment speedy trial provision does not provide defendant protection \r\n    until he or she is indicted).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
