Frazier appeals his convictions for murder and\r\npossession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. He argues the\r\ntrial court committed reversible error in (1) declining to charge self-defense; (2)\r\n\ndeclining to charge voluntary manslaughter; and (3) charging that malice may be\r\ninferred from the use of a deadly weapon. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and\r\nremand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nFACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nFrazier shot Jermaine Richardson, \"Baldy,\" in the head at the Pardue Street\r\nApartments in Lancaster around 9:30 pm on March 9, 2007. Baldy and Andre\r\nHood drove to the incident in a blue, four-door Cadillac, Baldy in the driver's seat\r\nand Hood in the front passenger's seat. When the police arrived, only Baldy\r\nremained in the car, and the front two doors of the car were open. No weapons\r\nwere recovered. The windows were tinted, and the driver's side window had four\r\nbullet holes in it. The window had not shattered because the tint kept it together.\r\n\r\nBaldy later died from his wounds, and a Lancaster County grand jury indicted\r\nFrazier for murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\ncrime. The State presented twenty-five witnesses. A number of the witnesses\r\ntestified Baldy attacked Frazier earlier in the night. They also testified Frazier\r\nnever calmed down after the attack and immediately made threats to James Ross\r\n(\"Pop Charlie\") that he would kill Baldy and Pop Charlie. Six of the witnesses\r\ntestified they later saw Frazier walk up to Baldy's car, look in the driver's side\r\nwindow, and shoot into the window three to four times.\r\n\r\nFrazier testified he and Baldy were initially friends until they had a falling out. As\r\na result of the decline in their friendship, Baldy initiated an altercation in early\r\nFebruary 2007 during which he punched and shot at Frazier, who escaped\r\nunharmed. Later that month, they had words during a concert. About a week later,\r\nFrazier began seeing Tawanna Stalk. Around that time, he purchased a nine\r\nmillimeter pistol for protection from Baldy.\r\n\r\nFrazier recounted that he arrived at Stalk's apartment at 7:30 pm on the night of the\r\nshooting. He brought the gun and placed it under a chair in the apartment's front\r\nroom. Stalk, Ayana Parker, and a number of others were also present. Everyone\r\nbegan to smoke marijuana and drink alcohol. An hour later, Pop Charlie knocked\r\non the apartment door. At Pop Charlie's suggestion, Frazier along with two others\r\nleft the apartment. Frazier testified he did not bring his gun because he was\r\ncomfortable with the group and did not expect to see Baldy.\r\n\nThe group went to the apartment of Stalk's rear neighbor, Parker, and entered her\r\nkitchen. Frazier sold Pop Charlie a blunt, and Frazier then lit his own. Frazier\r\ntestified that he looked down and, upon looking up, Pop Charlie slapped him,\r\nknocking him to the floor. Frazier testified he had not seen Baldy in Parker's\r\napartment, but while he lay on the floor, Baldy jumped on and began to beat him.\r\nFrazier passed out from the beating and awoke on the kitchen floor. He testified he\r\nlooked outside and saw Baldy getting in a car, leaving.\r\n\r\nAccording to Frazier, he did not suffer any bruises or bleeding as a result of the\r\nfight. However, he was \"mad\" and \"pissed off,\" and he asked Pop Charlie why\r\nthey jumped him. He and Pop Charlie began to argue, and a third party eventually\r\nheld Frazier back from the argument. Pop Charlie left Parker's apartment, and\r\nshortly thereafter, Frazier did as well.\r\n\r\nFrazier testified he walked back to Stalk's apartment. He knocked on the door, and\r\nPop Charlie answered. He and Pop Charlie resumed arguing, and they walked into\r\nthe kitchen. Pop Charlie got a knife, and Frazier grabbed his gun in response,\r\naiming it at Pop Charlie.\r\n\r\nFrazier stated he stepped outside to leave, when a friend of his arrived. The friend\r\njoined Frazier's argument with Pop Charlie in the doorway of the apartment, and\r\nStalk intervened, eventually separating them.\r\n\r\nFrazier testified that the blue Cadillac drove up to the front of Stalk's apartment\r\nwhile he and his friend argued with Pop Charlie. At that time, Frazier was\r\nstanding on the sidewalk outside Stalk's apartment, with his hands by his side and\r\nhis gun tucked in his pants. Frazier heard Pop Charlie yell, \"There goes your\r\nman,\" and then he heard gunshots behind him. As he turned around, he saw Hood\r\nat the passenger side of the Cadillac, door open, leaning over the car, shooting at\r\nhim with a rifle. Frazier ran toward and ducked behind the front corner of a Ford\r\nExplorer on the sidewalk in front of a next-door apartment. From that position, he\r\nstood up and shot back at the blue Cadillac three times.\r\n\r\nFrazier testified he first noticed the blue Cadillac when he heard gunshots behind\r\nhim. He did not know Baldy owned the blue Cadillac, nor did he know Baldy was\r\ndriving the car. He claimed he did not see anyone other than Hood exit the blue\r\nCadillac, nor did he see anyone else with a weapon. According to Frazier, he did\r\nnot know Baldy had been shot until the next morning.\r\n\nFrazier testified six minutes elapsed from the time he awoke on the floor of\r\nParker's kitchen until the shooting began in front of Stalk's apartment.1 He testified\r\nhe did not have enough time to calm down between the time he was jumped and\r\nthe time of the shooting. He also testified he shot at the blue Cadillac to defend\r\nhimself and because he was still \"worked up\" about the earlier attack. However, he\r\ndenied ever threatening Pop Charlie or leaving the area to retrieve a gun.\r\n\r\nAn investigating officer testified Frazier \"initially\" told the officer he saw Baldy\r\ndriving the blue Cadillac earlier \"in the area that night\" but subsequently changed\r\nhis story to indicate he knew nothing about the shooting and never saw the car or\r\nBaldy that evening.\r\n\r\nAn expert in trace analysis of gunshot residue introduced tests during trial that\r\nrevealed \"quantities of metal consistent with gunshot residue\" on the back of\r\nBaldy's right hand. Moreover, the gunshot residue expert explained that it was\r\npossible for the residue to end up on Baldy's hands even if he did not shoot a\r\nfirearm because, when a bullet perforates an object—such as a car window—the\r\nlead in the bullet can vaporize and land on either side of the perforated object. The\r\nexpert could not testify, however, as to whether it was more likely that the residue\r\noccurred this way or by Baldy firing a weapon. Investigators also found copper\r\nbullet jackets in the vehicle, and the State's bullet expert testified it would not be\r\nimpossible for the jackets to separate from the bullets when the bullets went\r\nthrough the tinted window if the gun was shot from inside the car.\r\n\r\nAfter the parties presented their cases, they talked with the trial court about\r\nwhether to charge self-defense, voluntary manslaughter, and the inference of\r\nmalice based upon the use of a deadly weapon. The court denied the motions to\r\ncharge the jury on self-defense and voluntary manslaughter. In declining to charge\r\nself-defense, the court reasoned Frazier failed to comply with a duty to retreat by\r\nfiring back once he ducked behind the Explorer because he was safe at that point\r\nand could have returned to Stalk's apartment. Relying on State v. Childers, 373\r\nS.C. 367, 645 S.E.2d 233 (2007) (plurality), the court declined to charge voluntary\r\nmanslaughter for three reasons: (1) no evidence showed Frazier was \"under the\r\nsway of a prior provocation\"; (2) no evidence showed Frazier knew Baldy was in\r\n\r\n\r\n1Parker explained that 30 minutes elapsed from the scuffle in her kitchen until\r\nafter Baldy was shot.\r\n\nthe automobile during the shooting; and (3) the evidence showed Frazier's reason\r\nfor shooting was not to shoot Baldy but to retaliate to the shots he heard.\r\n\r\nThe court further charged the jury the following:\r\n\r\n             Inferred malice may arise also when the deed is done\r\n             with a deadly weapon, and a revolver pistol is a deadly\r\n             weapon. This inference regarding malice being inferred\r\n             from the use of a deadly weapon is simply an evidentiary\r\n             fact to be considered by you along with the other\r\n             evidence in this case and you can give it such weight as\r\n             you decide it should have, if any.\r\n\r\nThe court reasoned State v. Belcher, 385 S.C. 597, 685 S.E.2d 802 (2009), did not\r\npreclude the charge because the case did not involve self-defense or voluntary\r\nmanslaughter.\r\n\r\nThe jury found Frazier guilty of both murder and possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime. He received concurrent sentences of 50 years'\r\nimprisonment for murder and 5 years' imprisonment for possession of a firearm.\r\nThis appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n1. \t   Did the trial court err in declining to charge self-defense?\r\n\r\n2. \t   Did the trial court err in declining to charge voluntary manslaughter?\r\n\r\n3. \t   Did the trial court err in charging the jury that malice may be inferred from\r\n       the use of a deadly weapon?\r\n\r\nLAW & ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.     \t ELF-DEFENSE\r\n       S\r\n\r\nFrazier contends the trial court erred in declining to charge self-defense because\r\nthe record contains evidence he was shot at with a rifle from behind, ducked\r\nbehind the front corner of a nearby vehicle, and shot back at his assailants. He\r\ncontends evidence shows Baldy was not only a driver but also a gunman himself,\r\n\nFrazier was not in a place of safety when he ducked behind the corner of the\r\nExplorer, and Frazier would have exposed himself to further danger if he ran to\r\nStalk's apartment from the Explorer.2 We agree.\r\n\r\n\"If there is any evidence in the record from which it could reasonably be inferred\r\nthat the defendant acted in self-defense, the defendant is entitled to instructions on\r\nthe defense, and the trial judge's refusal to do so is reversible error.\" State v. Light,\r\n378 S.C. 641, 650, 664 S.E.2d 465, 469 (2008). Self-defense requires four\r\nelements:    (1) the defendant must be without fault in bringing on the\r\n             difficulty; (2) the defendant must have been in actual\r\n             imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious\r\n             bodily injury, or he must have actually believed he was in\r\n             imminent danger of losing his life or sustaining serious\r\n             bodily injury; (3) if his defense is based upon his belief\r\n             of imminent danger, the defendant must show that a\r\n             reasonably prudent person of ordinary firmness and\r\n             courage would have entertained the belief that he was\r\n             actually in imminent danger and that the circumstances\r\n             were such as would warrant a person of ordinary\r\n\r\n2 The State argues Frazier failed to preserve his arguments that (1) Baldy was not\r\nsimply a driver but also a shooter and (2) Frazier could not return to the apartment\r\nwithout risking further serious injury. We disagree. On the record during the\r\ncharging stage, Frazier argued evidence existed that \"the victim was actually firing\r\nthe weapon\" and that Frazier \"was being attacked by the victim and his\r\nconfederate.\" Moreover, Frazier argued he was entitled to fire back at the blue\r\nCadillac because he was in an unsafe position. The trial court responded that\r\nFrazier could have run to Stalk's apartment, and Frazier disputed that assertion by\r\narguing \"he had to expose himself to fire to\" run to the apartment. Thus, the\r\narguments have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, and they are\r\npreserved for review. See State v. Dickman, 341 S.C. 293, 295, 534 S.E.2d 268,\r\n269 (2000) (noting an argument on a jury charge is not preserved for appeal if it is\r\nnot made below); State v. Johnson, 333 S.C. 62, 64 n.1, 508 S.E.2d 29, 30 n.1\r\n(1998) (\"[W]here a party requests a jury charge and, after opportunity for\r\ndiscussion, the trial judge declines the charge, it is unnecessary, to preserve the\r\npoint on appeal, to renew the request at conclusion of the court's instructions.\").\r\n\n             prudence, firmness, and courage to strike the fatal blow\r\n             in order to save himself from serious bodily harm or the\r\n             loss of his life; and (4) the defendant had no other\r\n             probable means of avoiding the danger.\r\n\r\nId. at 649, 664 S.E.2d at 469. \"[C]urrent law requires the State to disprove self-\r\ndefense, once raised by the defendant, beyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v.\r\nWiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 544, 500 S.E.2d 489, 492-93 (1998).\r\n\r\nHere, evidence in the record supports Frazier's contention he had no probable\r\nmeans of avoiding the danger other than to fire upon the blue Cadillac. Frazier\r\ntestified he fired his weapon because Hood was shooting at him from the car that\r\nBaldy was driving. Once the right to fire in self-defense arises, a person is not\r\nrequired to wait until his adversary is on equal terms in order to defend himself.\r\nState v. Starnes, 340 S.C. 312, 322, 531 S.E.2d 907, 913 (2000). Thus, assuming\r\nFrazier satisfied the other elements of self-defense, he was not required to risk\r\nserious injury by running toward Stalk's apartment or waiting for his alleged\r\nassailants to flank or shoot through the Explorer. See also id. (providing one\r\n\"doesn't have to wait until his assailant gets the drop on him, he has the right to act\r\nunder the law of self-preservation and prevent his assailant [from] getting the drop\r\non him\" (internal quotation marks omitted)); State v. Jackson, 227 S.C. 271, 279,\r\n87 S.E.2d 681, 685 (1955) (\"[I]t is one's duty to avoid taking human life where it is\r\npossible to prevent it even to the extent of retreating from his adversary unless by\r\ndoing so the danger of being killed or suffering serious bodily harm is increased or\r\nit is reasonably apparent that such danger would be increased.\").\r\n\r\nMoreover, taken in the light most favorable to Frazier, evidence in the record\r\nsupports the remaining elements of self-defense.\r\n\r\nFirst, evidence in the record indicates Frazier was in actual, imminent danger of\r\ndeath or serious bodily injury. No gun was found in the blue Cadillac, but four\r\nbullet holes passed through Baldy's car window even though Frazier testified he\r\nfired his weapon only three times. Further, the State's expert witnesses explained\r\nthe gun-shot residue on Baldy's hands and the location of the bullet jackets in the\r\nCadillac could indicate that Baldy fired upon Frazier in addition to Hood. This\r\nevidence could reasonably indicate Baldy was a gunman himself.\r\n\r\nSecond, evidence in the record could also reasonably support a finding that Frazier\r\nwas without fault in bringing on the difficulty. According to Frazier, Baldy\r\n\nreturned to the apartment armed after attacking Frazier without cause. Frazier\r\ntestified he was in an argument with Pop Charlie at that time. But that argument\r\nwas not the proximate cause of Baldy and Hood's shooting. Frazier and Pop\r\nCharlie were not engaged in a physical altercation, and although Frazier's gun was\r\nin his pants at the time, nothing in Frazier's story indicates that he was clutching\r\nthe firearm or that the firearm was visible to Hood or Baldy when he was arguing\r\nwith Pop Charlie. Frazier testified that when Baldy and Hood fired, his back was\r\nto the blue Cadillac, his gun was in his pants, and his hands were not on the\r\nweapon. Cf. State v. Slater, 373 S.C. 66, 71, 644 S.E.2d 50, 53 (2007) (holding the\r\ndefendant was not without fault in bringing on the difficulty because the defendant\r\n\"carried the cocked weapon, in open view, into an already violent attack in which\r\nhe had no prior involvement\" and his \"actions, including the unlawful possession\r\nof the weapon, proximately caused the exchange of gunfire, and ultimately the\r\ndeath of the victim\"). Because there is evidence in the record from which a jury\r\ncould find Frazier's conduct was not reasonably calculated to bring on the\r\ndifficulty, as well as evidence supporting the other elements of self-defense, we\r\nreverse his convictions and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nII.   VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER\r\n\r\nFrazier contends the trial court erred in declining to charge voluntary manslaughter\r\nbecause evidence showed he fired at Baldy out of anger arising from the initial\r\njumping and in response to shots fired by both Baldy and Hood. We affirm the\r\ntrial court's denial of Frazier's request for a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\n\r\nTo warrant the court declining to give a manslaughter charge, there must be no\r\nevidence whatsoever tending to support the charge. Starnes, 388 S.C. at 596, 698\r\nS.E.2d at 608. If there is, the defendant is entitled to the charge. Id. In\r\ndetermining whether to give the charge, \"the court must view the evidence in the\r\nlight most favorable to the defendant.\" State v. Cottrell, 376 S.C. 260, 262, 657\r\nS.E.2d 451, 452 (2008).\r\n\r\n\"Voluntary manslaughter is the intentional and unlawful killing of a human being\r\nin sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.\" State v. Smith, 391\r\nS.C. 408, 412-13, 706 S.E.2d 12, 14 (2011). \"The sudden heat of passion, upon\r\nsufficient legal provocation, . . . while it need not dethrone reason entirely, or shut\r\nout knowledge and volition, must be such as would naturally disturb the sway of\r\nreason, and render the mind of an ordinary person incapable of cool reflection, and\r\nproduce what, according to human experience, may be called an uncontrollable\r\n\nimpulse to do violence.\" Childers, 373 S.C. at 373, 645 S.E.2d at 236 (internal\r\nquotation marks omitted). The sudden heat of passion \"must cause a person to lose\r\ncontrol.\" Starnes, 388 S.C. at 598, 698 S.E.2d at 609. \"[I]n determining whether\r\nan act which caused death was impelled by heat of passion[, as with manslaughter],\r\nor by malice[, as with murder], all the surrounding circumstances and conditions\r\nare to be taken into consideration, including previous relations and conditions\r\nconnected with the tragedy, as well as those existing at the time of the killing.\"\r\nState v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 575, 647 S.E.2d 144, 169 (2007).\r\n\r\nHere, the record is devoid of any evidence Frazier shot Baldy in a \"heat of\r\npassion.\" Frazier testified he was \"mad\" and \"worked up\" from the earlier beating.\r\nHowever, despite the earlier incident, Frazier testified he never attacked anyone\r\nuntil fired upon. At that time, he ran to the Explorer, ducked behind it for cover,\r\nand then stood and returned fire. Considering the circumstances surrounding the\r\nincident, it is clear he shot back as a calculated, strategic move to protect himself.\r\nFrazier's story does not establish he fired his weapon in a heat of passion causing\r\nan uncontrollable impulse to do violence, and no other evidence in the record\r\ncould reasonably support such a contention. The trial court properly declined\r\nFrazier's request to charge the law on voluntary manslaughter. See Starnes, 388\r\nS.C. at 599, 698 S.E.2d at 609 (\"A person may act in a deliberate, controlled\r\nmanner, notwithstanding the fact that he is afraid or in fear. Conversely, a person\r\ncan be acting under an uncontrollable impulse to do violence and be incapable of\r\ncool reflection as a result of fear. The latter situation constitutes sudden heat of\r\npassion, but the former does not. . . . Turning to the facts of this case, viewing the\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to Appellant, there is no evidence to support a\r\nvoluntary manslaughter charge. . . . While . . . Appellant was in fear, there is no\r\nevidence Appellant was out of control as a result of his fear or was acting under an\r\nuncontrollable impulse to do violence. The only evidence in the record is that\r\nAppellant deliberately and intentionally shot Jared and Bill and that he either shot\r\nthe men with malice aforethought or in self-defense.\").\r\n\r\nIII.   INFERRED MALICE\r\n\r\nFrazier argues the trial court erred in permitting an inference of malice based upon\r\nhis use of a firearm under Belcher. We agree.\r\n\r\nAs said above, evidence in the record could reasonably support Fraizer's claim of\r\nself-defense. Thus, the trial court erred in charging that malice may be inferred\r\nfrom the use of a deadly weapon. See Belcher, 385 S.C. at 612, 685 S.E.2d at 810\r\n\n(\"[W]here evidence is presented that would reduce, mitigate, excuse or justify a\r\nhomicide . . . caused by the use of a deadly weapon, juries shall not be charged that\r\nmalice may be inferred from the use of a deadly weapon.\"); Dickey, 394 S.C. at\r\n499, 716 S.E.2d at 101 (\"A person is justified in using deadly force in self-defense\r\nwhen . . . .\").\r\n\r\nIV.   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe affirm the denial of Frazier's motions for charges on voluntary manslaughter.3\r\nWe reverse the denial of Frazier's motion for a charge on self-defense and against a\r\ncharge on malice. Thus, we remand for a new trial on the murder and firearm\r\nconvictions.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and GEATHERS, JJ., concurring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 A recurring issue throughout this case has been whether Frazier was entitled to a\r\ncastle doctrine charge. However, we decline to address that issue because we\r\nreverse for a new trial on the self-defense issue. See Belcher, 385 S.C. at 613 n.11,\r\n685 S.E.2d at 811 n.11 (declining to address a remaining issue because the court\r\nreversed and remanded for a new trial due to an erroneous jury charge).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5070","title":"Lincoln General v.

Wiseman, Stephen Lynwood, and Russell G.\r\nHines, all of Young Clement Rivers LLP, of Charleston,\r\nfor Respondents.\r\n\nTHOMAS, J.: After a car accident, Lincoln General Insurance Company,\r\nindividually and as subrogee of Jose Salgado, Blanca Acosta, Miguel S., Ofelia S.\r\nand Cathy Alafaro (collectively, Respondents) sued Progressive Northern\r\nInsurance Company, Avery Strickland, and Jennifer Strickland. Lincoln General\r\nsought a declaratory judgment that Jennifer Strickland's policy with Progressive\r\ncovered the accident, pursuant to the South Carolina Motor Vehicle Financial\r\nResponsibility Act (the MVFRA), for the mandatory minimum policy limits, even\r\nthough the driver was disqualified from coverage under Jennifer Strickland's\r\npolicy. The trial court granted summary judgment to Lincoln General.\r\nProgressive appeals. We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nThe facts are not disputed. Jennifer Strickland and Avery Strickland were married.\r\nJennifer took out an insurance policy with Progressive on a motor vehicle she\r\nowned. The record does not contain the entire insurance policy. The record\r\ncontains an endorsement that provides the following:\r\n\r\n            You have named the following person as excluded\r\n            drivers under this policy:\r\n\r\n            Avery Strickland           Date of Birth: March 25, 1978\r\n\r\n            No coverage is provided for any claim arising from an\r\n            accident or loss involving a motorized vehicle being\r\n            operated by an excluded person. This includes any claim\r\n            for damages made against any named insured, resident\r\n            relative, or any other person or organization that is\r\n            vicariously liable for an accident or loss arising out of the\r\n            operation of a motorized vehicle by the excluded driver.\r\n\r\n            ....\r\n\r\n            I declare that either the driver's license of the excluded\r\n            persons named in this Named Driver Exclusion election\r\n            has been turned into the Department of Motor Vehicles,\r\n            or that an appropriate policy of liability insurance or\r\n            other security as may be authorized by law has been\r\n\n            properly executed in the name of the person to be\r\n            excluded.\r\n\r\nThe named driver endorsement was signed by Jennifer and indicated that Avery\r\nsurrendered his license to the Department of Motor Vehicles. No party disputes\r\nthe accuracy of this representation.\r\n\r\nIn March 2009, Jennifer entrusted the vehicle to Avery. While operating the car,\r\nhe was involved in an accident with a vehicle owned by Jose Salgado. Avery was\r\nat-fault, but Progressive refused coverage, contending Jennifer's policy was\r\ninapplicable while he was driving. Lincoln General paid uninsured motorist\r\nbenefits to the occupants of Salgado's car under his policy.\r\n\r\nRespondents brought suit against Progressive, Jennifer, and Avery. Among other\r\nclaims and prayers for relief, Respondents sought declaratory judgment that\r\nJennifer's policy with Progressive covered the minimum limits mandated by the\r\nMVFRA.\r\n\r\nRespondents and Progressive both moved for summary judgment. The trial court\r\ngranted summary judgment to Lincoln General. It found the MVFRA required\r\nProgressive to cover the claim up to the mandatory minimum limits of liability,\r\ndespite the named driver endorsement in Jennifer's policy. The court reasoned the\r\nMVFRA provides that an owner's liability policy is \"absolute\" when injury occurs\r\nand South Carolina case law requires liability carriers to cover losses up to the\r\nstatutory limits regardless of the endorsement. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUE ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in granting Lincoln General summary judgment based upon a\r\nfinding that Progressive must afford automobile liability insurance coverage up to\r\nthe minimum limits despite the named driver endorsement?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. When reviewing the grant of a summary\r\njudgment motion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court\r\nunder Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Nakatsu v. Encompass Indem. Co., 390 S.C. 172, 177,\r\n700 S.E.2d 283, 286 (Ct. App. 2010). Summary judgment is proper when there is\r\n\nno genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a\r\njudgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n\r\nLAW & ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nProgressive argues the trial court erred in awarding minimum limits liability\r\ncoverage because the named driver endorsement in Jennifer's policy was statutorily\r\nauthorized and therefore is not inconsistent with the public policy established by\r\nthe MVFRA. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent\r\nof the Legislature. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\n\"All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that the legislative\r\nintent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that\r\nlanguage must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.\"\r\nBroadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Comm'n, 342 S.C. 373, 380, 537\r\nS.E.2d 543, 546 (2000). The court should give words their plain and ordinary\r\nmeaning, without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the\r\nstatute's operation. Auto Owners Ins. Co. v. Rollison, 378 S.C. 600, 609, 663\r\nS.E.2d 484, 488 (2008). However, statutes relating to an insurance contract are\r\ngenerally part of the contract as a matter of law. Nakatsu, 390 S.C. at 178, 700\r\nS.E.2d at 287. To the extent a policy conflicts with an applicable statute, the\r\nstatute prevails. Id.\r\n\r\nUnder the MVFRA, an insurance carrier's liability for \"insurance required by this\r\nchapter\" is \"absolute whenever injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle\r\nliability policy occurs.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-9-20(5)(b)(1) (2006). Automobile\r\ninsurance policies may not be issued unless they \"contain[] a provision insuring the\r\npersons defined as the insured\" in liability coverage at a minimum of $25,000 per\r\nperson for bodily injury, $50,000 per accident for bodily injury, and $25,000 per\r\naccident for injury to property. S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-140(A) (Supp. 2011). An\r\n\"insured\" is statutorily defined to include the named insured and resident relative.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-30(7) (2002). As a result, resident relatives of the named\r\ninsured are generally covered as an \"insured\" under the named insured's policy\r\nregardless of whether the named insured gave them permission to operate the\r\ncovered vehicle. See S.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-140(A) (Supp. 2011) (providing that\r\nautomobile insurance policies must provide coverage to \"the persons defined as the\r\ninsured\"); § 38-77-30(7) (\"'Insured' means the named insured and, while resident\r\n\nof the same household, the spouse of any named insured and relatives of either\r\n. . . .\").\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the MVFRA is to give greater protection to those injured through\r\nthe negligent operation of automobiles. Penn. Nat'l Mut. Cas. Ins. Co. v. Parker,\r\n282 S.C. 546, 551, 320 S.E.2d 458, 461 (Ct. App. 1984). The legislation requires\r\ninsurance for the benefit of the public, and an insurer may not \"nullify its purposes\r\nthrough engrafting exceptions from liability as to uses which it was the evident\r\npurpose of the statute to cover.\" Id. Therefore, our courts will strike down policy\r\nprovisions that have \"the effect of limiting the coverage requirements of the\r\nstatute[s].\" See id. (striking an omnibus provision purporting to provide coverage\r\nto certain automobiles \"not used for business or commercial purposes other than\r\nfarming\" because it had the effect of limiting an insured's coverage in\r\ncontravention of the mandatory minimum limits).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, our courts have consistently cautioned that \"[r]easonable\r\nexclusionary clauses which do not conflict with the legislative expression of the\r\npublic policy of the State as revealed in the various motor vehicle insurance\r\nstatutes are permitted.\" Id. In fact, our Code specifies certain exclusions that may\r\nbe included in automobile insurance policies. For example:\r\n\r\n             The automobile policy need not insure any liability under\r\n             the Workers' Compensation Law nor any liability on\r\n             account of bodily injury to an employee of the insured\r\n             while engaged in the employment, other than domestic,\r\n             of the insured, or while engaged in the operation,\r\n             maintenance, or repair of the motor vehicle nor any\r\n             liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in\r\n             charge of, or transported by the insured.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-220 (2002). Section 56-9-20(5)(c) of the MVFRA\r\ncontains similar language. See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-9-20(5)(c) (2006) (\"The\r\nmotor vehicle liability policy need not insure any liability under the Workers'\r\nCompensation Law nor any liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an\r\nemployee of the insured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of\r\nthe insured, or while engaged in the operation, maintenance, or repair of the motor\r\nvehicle, nor any liability for damage to property owned by, rented to, in charge of,\r\nor transported by the insured.\").\r\n\nFurther, under section 38-77-340 of our Code, the named insured may agree with\r\nthe insurer that the named insured's policy \"shall not apply\" while certain persons\r\noperate the motor vehicle:\r\n\r\n             Notwithstanding the definition of \"insured\" in Section\r\n             38-77-30, the insurer and any named insured must, by the\r\n             terms of a written amendatory endorsement, the form of\r\n             which has been approved by the director or his designee,\r\n             agree that coverage under such a policy of liability\r\n             insurance shall not apply while the motor vehicle is being\r\n             operated by a natural person designated by name. The\r\n             agreement, when signed by the named insured, is binding\r\n             upon every insured to whom the policy applies and any\r\n             substitution or renewal of it. However, no natural person\r\n             may be excluded unless the named insured declares in the\r\n             agreement that (1) the driver's license of the excluded\r\n             person has been turned in to the Department of Motor\r\n             Vehicles or (2) an appropriate policy of liability\r\n             insurance or other security as may be authorized by law\r\n             has been properly executed in the name of the person to\r\n             be excluded.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-77-340 (Supp. 2011). The purpose of this section is to\r\n\"alleviate the problem often faced by the owner of a family policy, who . . . has a\r\nrelatively safe driving record but is forced to pay higher premiums because another\r\nmember of the family . . . is by definition also included in the policy coverage.\"\r\nLovette v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 274 S.C. 597, 600, 266 S.E.2d 782, 783 (1980)\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted) (discussing predecessor statute).\r\n\r\nHere, Progressive is not required to provide minimum limits. The named driver\r\nendorsement statute says that, \"[n]otwithstanding the definition of 'insured' in\r\nSection 38-77-30, . . . a policy of liability insurance shall not apply\" when the\r\nnamed driver is operating the vehicle. Thus, \"the legislative expression of the\r\npublic policy of the State as revealed in the various motor vehicle insurance\r\nstatutes\" specifies that an insurer's obligation to provide minimum limits for\r\n\"insureds\" is inapplicable when the person named in the endorsement is driving\r\nand the statute's remaining requirements are satisfied. Because the policy is not in\r\neffect when the named driver is operating the vehicle and such an endorsement is\r\npart of our state's public policy, the MVFRA's mandate that \"[t]he liability of the\r\n\ninsurance carrier with respect to the insurance required by this chapter shall\r\nbecome absolute whenever injury or damage covered by the motor vehicle liability\r\npolicy occurs\" does not apply.\r\n\r\nWe have expounded similar principles in a case addressing a predecessor to the\r\ncurrent named driver endorsement statute in South Carolina Insurance Company v.\r\nBarlow, 301 S.C. 502, 392 S.E.2d 795 (Ct. App. 1990). There, we repeated the\r\nlongstanding principle that insurers may limit liability to certain persons if the\r\nlimitation \"is not in contradiction of some statutory inhibition or public policy.\"\r\nId. at 506, 392 S.E.2d at 797. We then recognized that our legislature intended to\r\nprotect the public by adopting an \"omnibus clause statute\" that required insurance\r\npolicies to cover not only the named insured but also the named insured's resident\r\nspouse. Id. at 508, 392 S.E.2d at 797. However, we also noted the predecessor\r\nendorsement statute \"is not inhibited by\" that public policy. Id. (emphasis added).\r\nWhile the omnibus clause statute protected the public, the predecessor\r\nendorsement statute \"protect[ed], in limited situations, the right of the parties to\r\nmake their own contract.\" Id.\r\n\r\nRespondents cite to a number of cases to support their argument that the named\r\ndriver endorsement does not obviate Progressive's duty to provide minimum limits\r\nbecause the General Assembly promulgated the MVFRA to protect third parties.\r\nSee S.C. Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 382 S.E.2d 11 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1989); Parker, 282 S.C. 546, 320 S.E.2d 458. We agree the MVFRA was\r\ncreated to protect third parties. But our cases that hold an injured party can obtain\r\ncoverage for the minimum limits on a policy despite purportedly falling within an\r\nexclusion do not address policy provisions explicitly authorized by statute at the\r\ntime of the injury. See, e.g., Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Charleston, Inc. v. Aetna\r\nCas. & Sur. Co., 303 S.C. 301, 303-04, 400 S.E.2d 147, 148 (1991) (holding a\r\nprovision in a car dealership's policy that \"excluded liability coverage for an\r\nindividual using a covered vehicle while working in the business of servicing\r\nautomobiles\" was invalid with respect to a permissive user who was an employee\r\nof another car dealership because the exclusion contravened the MVFRA's\r\nrequirement that the policy to cover persons defined as \"insured,\" including\r\npermissive users, and noting: \"certain statutes provide specific exemptions which\r\nmay be properly included in an automobile liability policy, thus giving rise to a\r\nstrong inference that no other exceptions were intended\" (overruling Stanley v.\r\nReserve Ins. Co., 238 S.C. 533, 121 S.E.2d 10 (1961), and Am. Fire & Cas. Co. v.\r\nSur. Indem. Co., 246 S.C. 220, 143 S.E.2d 371 (1965), to the extent they were\r\ninconsistent with the opinion)); Jordan v. Aetna Cas. & Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 294,\r\n\n297, 214 S.E.2d 818, 820 (1975) (holding exclusion purporting to relieve the\r\ninsurer of liability for injuries sustained by the named insured, resident spouses and\r\nrelatives as well as permittees was unenforceable because it was contrary to the\r\nMVFRA: \"While parties are generally permitted to contract as they desire, freedom\r\nto contract is not absolute and coverage required by law may not be omitted. . . . It\r\nis settled law that statutory provisions relating to an insurance contract are part of\r\nthe contract, and that a policy provision which contravenes an applicable statute is\r\nto that extent invalid\"); Mumford, 299 S.C. at 18, 382 S.E.2d at 13 (holding a\r\nprovision that excluded third party liability coverage for \"intentional acts\" was\r\ninvalid because (1) it contravened the minimum limits requirement; (2) sections of\r\nthe MVFRA \"list certain exclusions which may properly be placed in an\r\nautomobile liability policy,\" none of those sections list an intentional acts\r\nexclusion, and \"[t]his omission suggests such an exclusion is not valid\"; and (3)\r\n\"[s]ection 38-77-310 expressly authorizes an intentional acts exclusion for personal\r\ninjury protection coverage,\" which suggests the legislature did not intend to\r\nauthorize a similar provision for third party liability coverage); Parker, 282 S.C. at\r\n554-55, 320 S.E.2d at 463 (holding void a provision purporting to provide\r\ncoverage to certain automobiles \"not used for business or commercial purposes\r\nother than farming\" as contravening the minimum limits requirement under the\r\nMVFRA and \"find[ing] support for[the] holding\" in the existence of other sections\r\nunder the MVFRA because \"[t]hese sections list certain exemptions which may\r\nproperly be included in an automobile liability policy,\" \"[a] business use or other\r\nuse exclusion is not included,\" and the expressions of these exclusions \"give rise to\r\na strong inference that no other exceptions were intended\").\r\n\r\nIn contrast, and consistent with the principles stated in Barlow, we have held that\r\nclaimants were validly excluded from all automobile coverage due to a statutorily\r\npermitted exclusion despite the MVFRA's mandate. See State Farm Mut. Auto.\r\nIns. Co. v. N. River Ins. Co., 288 S.C. 374, 375-76, 342 S.E.2d 627, 627 (Ct. App.\r\n1986) (holding a policy provided \"no coverage\" because an exclusion for bodily\r\ninjury to \"any employee of an insured arising out of his or her employment\" was\r\n\"consonant with two provisions\" of the MVFRA that provided \"a motor vehicle\r\nliability policy need not insure any liability covered by the worker's compensation\r\nlaw nor any liability on account of bodily injury to or death of an employee of the\r\ninsured while engaged in the employment, other than domestic, of the insured, or\r\nwhile engaged in the operation, maintenance or repair of the motor vehicle\"). In\r\nBarlow and North River, the exclusions did not contravene public policy because\r\nthe exclusions were public policy themselves.\r\n\nRespondents also rely heavily upon United Services Automobile Association v.\r\nMarkosky, 340 S.C. 223, 530 S.E.2d 660 (Ct. App. 2000), and Allstate Insurance\r\nCompany v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Company, 619 P.2d 329 (Utah\r\n1980), in support of their arguments. However, those cases are not applicable.\r\n\r\nIn Markosky, an insured failed to notify its insurer of a traffic accident, and this\r\ncourt rejected an argument that the MVFRA required the insurer to pay more than\r\nthe mandatory minimum liability limits to a third party despite the existence of\r\ngreater policy limits. 340 S.C. at 230-31, 530 S.E.2d at 664. The court\r\nacknowledged that an insured's failure to follow the notice provisions of a\r\nminimum limits policy does not void the policy. Id. at 227-28, 530 S.E.2d at 663\r\n(citing Shores v. Weaver, 315 S.C. 347, 354-55, 433 S.E.2d 913, 916-17 (Ct. App.\r\n1993)). But it noted that other courts have addressed \"identical\" mandatory limits\r\nstatutes and held similar conduct on the insured's part could defeat entitlement to\r\nrecovery of more than the minimum limits because the protection afforded by the\r\nMVFRA to the policy applied only to coverage required by that legislation. Id. at\r\n228, 530 S.E.2d at 663 (citing Odum v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 401 S.E.2d 87,\r\n91-92 (N.C. Ct. App. 1991), and Swain v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 116 S.E.2d\r\n482, 487-88 (N.C. 1960)). The court opted to adopt such an approach in light of\r\nthe legislative directive to construe the MVFRA so as to make its application\r\nuniform with substantially identical legislation. Id.\r\n\r\nIn recognizing the need to construe the MVFRA uniformly with similar statutes,\r\nthis court footnoted thirteen opinions from other states. One of those opinions was\r\nthe aforementioned Allstate Insurance Company v. United States Fidelity &\r\nGuaranty Company, which contains a proposition that summarizes the heart of\r\nRespondents' argument on appeal:\r\n\r\n             Contracting parties are free to limit coverage in excess of\r\n             the minimum required limits, and the [named driver]\r\n             exclusion found in the contract is valid in relation to any\r\n             coverage exceeding the minimum amounts. Thus, a\r\n             balance is struck between the necessity of securing\r\n             minimum automobile liability coverage and the\r\n             availability of lower premiums because of the exclusion\r\n             of high insurance risks.\r\n\r\nAllstate Ins. Co, 619 P.2d at 333.\r\n\nNeither Markosky, its citation of Allstate, nor Allstate itself provide good authority\r\nfor holding that an insurer is required to provide coverage in this case.\r\nFirst, Allstate held that a named driver provision was void under Utah law to the\r\nextent it purported to avoid the protection of mandatory minimum limits\r\nestablished by Utah's No-Fault Insurance Act. Allstate Ins. Co, 619 P.2d at 333.\r\nThe Allstate opinion did not address whether any Utah statute specifically\r\nauthorized named driver exclusions. After the Utah court decided Allstate, the\r\nUtah legislature promulgated a statute that provided a policy may include a named\r\ndriver provision to \"specifically exclude\" certain named drivers \"from coverage.\"\r\nSee Utah Code Ann. § 31A-22-302.5 (2011). Second, the issue in Markosky\r\ninvolved whether the insured's conduct in breach of its duty to notify the insured of\r\nan accident would result in minimum coverage. Markosky did not address the\r\nissue here—whether the MVFRA required minimum limit coverage despite a\r\nstatute that specifically authorized a provision as part of the state's public policy.\r\nThird, the citation in Markosky that included Allstate also included decisions from\r\nstate courts that have adopted positions consistent with ours. Cf. State Farm Auto.\r\nIns. Co. v. Dressler, 738 P.2d 1134, 1138 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1987) (\"[I]t is\r\ninconceivable that the legislature would purposely enact statutory language that\r\nauthorized the insurer to exclude coverage for personal liability incurred by the\r\nunacceptable driver and to exclude vicarious liability incurred due to the\r\nunacceptable driver's conduct, but not to exclude coverage for the named insured's\r\npersonal liability for negligently entrusting a vehicle to the same unacceptable\r\ndriver. Accordingly, we hold that State Farm's driver exclusion endorsement\r\nvalidly insulated State Farm from any liability or obligation under appellant\r\nDonald Dressler's automobile liability policy for any claim generated as a result of\r\nJoyce Dressler's operating the insured vehicle.\" (emphasis added)); Detroit Auto.\r\nInter-Ins. Exch. v. Comm'r of Ins., 272 N.W.2d 689, 691 (Mich. Ct. App. 1978) (\"It\r\nis defendant's position that since the Legislature enacted a comprehensive,\r\ncompulsory insurance scheme, it would be inconsistent to permit named driver\r\nexclusions, as this would force accident victims to obtain a recovery from the\r\npersonal holdings of those responsible. Defendant contends that the Legislature\r\nwould not permit a class of drivers, named excluded drivers, to drive totally\r\nuncovered by some residual liability insurance. While such a class might have\r\nexisted before No-Fault, that situation was remedied by the requirement of\r\nuninsured motorist coverage. Defendant's position is appealing until one confronts\r\nM.C.L. s 500.3009(2); M.S.A. s 24.13009(2). That statute expressly permits the\r\nexclusion from coverage of a named person, and provides that the vehicle owner\r\n\nand others legally responsible for the excluded section remain fully, personally\r\nliable.\").1\r\n\r\n\"'[T]he legislature has determined that for all vehicles registered in South Carolina,\r\nat least minimal coverage is necessary to protect the public.'\" Markosky, 340 S.C.\r\nat 230, 530 S.E.2d at 664 (quoting Shores, 315 S.C. at 355, 433 S.E.2d at 917)).\r\nHowever, the legislature has also determined that \"coverage under such a policy of\r\nliability insurance shall not apply\" while a named driver is operating the vehicle so\r\nlong as the remaining statutory requirements are satisfied. § 38-77-340. As in\r\nBarlow, the named driver endorsement statute \"is not inhibited by\" the MVFRA's\r\npublic policy because it constitutes separately approved public policy. Barlow,\r\n301 S.C. at 507-08, 392 S.E.2d at 797 (emphasis added). While the MVFRA\r\nprotects the public, the named driver endorsement statute \"protects, in limited\r\nsituations, the right of the parties to make their own contract.\" Id.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe MVFRA does not permit recovery of minimum limits liability coverage on a\r\nmotor vehicle liability insurance policy when a person named in a policy provision\r\npursuant to section 38-77-340 is operating the motor vehicle and the requirements\r\nof the statute are satisfied because the policy \"shall not apply\" under those\r\ncircumstances. Consequently, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to\r\n\r\n\r\n1 States disagree as to whether a named driver exclusion authorized by statute is\r\ncompletely or only partly enforceable, but these decisions often turn upon the\r\nlanguage and existence of applicable statutes.

We\r\nreverse and remand to the trial court.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn May 24, 2009, Broadnax entered a Church's Fried Chicken (Church's) around\r\n5:00 p.m. He pointed a gun at three of the employees and forced one to remove all\r\nthe register's money. Broadnax then placed the money into a bag and fled the\r\nscene. An employee followed Broadnax outside and observed him getting into a\r\ntruck that subsequently drove away. The police responded, and they were able to\r\ntrack a similar truck several blocks away from the Church's. The police stopped\r\nthe truck and removed the driver. Broadnax was found inside, crouched down in\r\nthe passenger seat. A gun and a bag of clothing were located underneath the\r\npassenger seat. On November 19, 2009, a grand jury indicted Broadnax for armed\r\nrobbery, and on June 10, 2010, the case was called to trial before a jury.\r\n\r\nIn a pre-trial hearing, Broadnax admitted he was convicted of armed robbery in\r\n1979 and 1991.1 The State had served him with notice of LWOP on May 18, 2010,\r\nbased on those previous armed robbery charges. Broadnax argued he was not\r\nadequately informed of the possibility of LWOP at the time of his prior\r\nconvictions; thus, it was a violation of his Sixth Amendment rights. Further, he\r\nmaintained he relinquished his right to go to trial in 1991 in reliance on the\r\nrepresentation and assurance of his attorney, who did not inform him of the\r\nsubsequent possibility of LWOP; thus, his rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth\r\nAmendments as well as all the South Carolina constitutional equivalent provisions\r\nwere violated. The trial court withheld ruling on the issue to allow the State to\r\nsubmit case law on the issues. At the end of the pre-trial hearing, the State\r\nsubmitted case law, but there was no ruling made from the bench on the issue.2\r\n\r\nBroadnax further objected to the solicitor's total discretion in noticing LWOP\r\nsentences under section 17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011), and\r\nmaintained the unfettered discretion violated his substantive due process rights.\r\nBroadnax stated he had been willing to plead guilty to his current charge, but the\r\nsolicitor had \"it out for him.\" Broadnax stated that in the interest of judicial\r\n\r\n1 Broadnax had three armed robbery convictions from 1991, but only one armed \n\r\nrobbery conviction from 1979. \n\r\n2 This issue was not raised on appeal; thus, it is not preserved. \n\r\n\neconomy, the prosecution sometimes uses the threat of LWOP as a method to\r\ninduce a plea, and they will choose not to go forward with LWOP when a\r\ndefendant will plea. He requested to proffer testimony from Investigator A. L.\r\nThomas to show the prosecution's arbitrary and capricious actions. However,\r\ninstead of proffering Investigator Thomas's testimony, Broadnax proffered\r\ntestimony from a law clerk, Jacob Taylor Bell, who could testify to the same\r\nevidence. Bell stated he was present for a conversation regarding plea offers\r\nbetween Investigator Thomas and Broadnax's counsel. In that conversation,\r\nBroadnax indicated he was willing to plead to twenty years, but Bell testified\r\nInvestigator Thomas \"explicitly said [the prosecutor] had her fangs out for\r\nBroadnax.\" The trial court explained that \"when you've got the notice that lists\r\nthree or four different armed robbery offenses, I fail to see that there is any\r\narbitrariness in the use of the life without parole notice,\" and denied Broadnax's\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nBroadnax then argued section 17-25-45 violated the Equal Protection Clause and\r\nmaintained the statutory discretion given to solicitors in deciding whether to notice\r\nLWOP was capricious and arbitrary. He contended it would depend on the county,\r\n\"[o]r even less, it [would] depend[] on which solicitor a defendant draws as to\r\nwhether or not they will get LWOP when they are willing to plead to something.\"\r\nHe contended that with no defined standard to guide prosecutors, a situation is\r\ncreated where similarly situated defendants are treated differently depending on the\r\ncounty jurisdiction. In support of his argument, Broadnax cited Bush v. Gore, 531\r\nU.S. 98 (2000). The trial court denied that motion as well.\r\n\r\nDuring the trial, Broadnax decided to testify in his own defense, and the trial court\r\nconducted an inquiry into his prior record to determine which convictions could be\r\nadmitted into evidence. The trial court found three out of his four prior armed\r\nrobbery convictions were admissible, in addition to prior convictions for\r\ntransaction card theft, grand larceny, and petit larceny, pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2),\r\nSCRE.3 The trial court noted State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003) supported its decision that the armed robbery convictions were crimes\r\nof dishonesty. However, the trial court also stated Al-Amin involved a defendant\r\non trial for murder, whereas Broadnax was charged with armed robbery, noting the\r\ndifference had the potential to increase the prejudicial impact of admitting the prior\r\narmed robbery convictions. Despite that distinction, the trial court followed the\r\n\r\n3No issue was raised relating to the time element established in Rule 609(b),\r\nSCRE.\r\n\ncourt in Al-Amin, and determined that case made it clear no Rule 403 analysis\r\napplied to any convictions admitted for impeachment purposes under Rule\r\n609(a)(2). Defense counsel then requested permission to elicit testimony from\r\nBroadnax on direct examination about the prior convictions without having waived\r\nhis objection to that same testimony. He did not want to be \"hamstrung\" and\r\nwished to avoid the prior convictions being exploited by the State on cross-\r\nexamination. \"[I]t [was defense counsel's] understanding that this [was] only for\r\nimpeachment purposes and it's not for [] propensity. And if such an objection\r\narises, [he] would of course make it on the record.\" The trial court agreed to\r\nBroadnax's strategy of eliciting testimony about the prior convictions on direct\r\nexamination but not waiving his objection to that testimony.\r\n\r\nAfter the jury returned with a guilty verdict, Broadnax renewed all his objections.\r\nHe also moved for a new trial based on violations of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nSpecifically, Broadnax contended the State denied him his due process right to a\r\nfair trial by eliciting testimony of his three prior convictions for armed robbery and\r\nby misusing the word \"innocent\" so as to improperly shift the burden to the\r\ndefendant.4 The trial court denied all his motions, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\nISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in admitting Broadnax's three prior armed robbery\r\nconvictions for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2)?\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in denying Broadnax's motion to withdraw the notice of\r\nLWOP based on the arbitrary use of the prosecution's discretion in the plea\r\nbargaining process?\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in denying Broadnax's motion to withdraw the notice of\r\nLWOP based on the lack of standards guiding solicitors in when they should seek a\r\nsentence of LWOP?\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err in denying Broadnax's motion that the jury be instructed\r\nBroadnax was facing a mandatory sentence of LWOP?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4Broadnax did not raise the issue of the State's alleged misuse of \"innocent\" on\r\nappeal.\r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"In criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.\" State v.\r\nBaccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006) (citing State v. Wilson, 345\r\nS.C. 1, 5, 545 S.E.2d 827, 829 (2001)). \"This [c]ourt is bound by the trial court's\r\nfactual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.\" Id. (citing State v.\r\nQuattlebaum, 338 S.C. 441, 452, 527 S.E.2d 105, 111 (2000)).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nPrior Convictions\r\n\r\nBroadnax argues the trial court erred in admitting the prior armed robbery\r\nconvictions into evidence for purposes of impeachment under Rule 609(a)(2).\r\nSpecifically, Broadnax maintains that since the armed robberies should not have\r\nbeen admitted for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2), the trial court\r\nshould have analyzed them pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1); thus, a balancing test was\r\nnecessary. We agree.\r\n\r\nAs a threshold matter, we address the State's argument that Broadnax did not\r\npreserve this issue for our review. See State v. Liverman, 386 S.C. 223, 243, 687\r\nS.E.2d 70, 80 (Ct. App. 2009) (holding issues must be raised to and ruled upon by\r\ntrial court to be preserved for review); see also State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386,\r\n393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1994) (\"A contemporaneous objection is required to\r\nproperly preserve an error for appellate review.\"); State v. Burton, 326 S.C. 605,\r\n609, 486 S.E.2d 762, 764 (Ct. App. 1997) (\"Failure to object when the evidence is\r\noffered constitutes a waiver of the right to object.\"). We disagree.\r\n\r\nBroadnax raised his objection directly prior to taking the stand in his own defense.\r\nAfter the trial court issued its ruling on admissibility, Broadnax stated he would be\r\neliciting the challenged testimony in order to avoid having the State exploit it.\r\nThus, we believe this issue was properly preserved for our review. See State v.\r\nMueller, 319 S.C. 266 at 267-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410-11 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding\r\nthat because no evidence was presented between the ruling on impeachment\r\nevidence and the defendant's testimony, there was no basis for the trial court to\r\nchange its ruling, and \"if a party has obtained a final ruling on the admissibility of\r\nimpeachment evidence, that party does not lose his right to challenge on appeal the\r\nadmissibility of the evidence by eliciting the evidence during direct examination\").\r\nWe continue now to the merits of Broadnax's argument.\r\n\nRule 609(a), SCRE provides that for the purpose of attacking the credibility of a\r\nwitness:     (1) evidence that a witness other than an accused has\r\n             been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to\r\n             Rule 403, if the crime was punishable by death or\r\n             imprisonment in excess of one year under the law under\r\n             which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an\r\n             accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be\r\n             admitted if the court determines that the probative value\r\n             of admitting this evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect\r\n             to the accused; and\r\n\r\n             (2) evidence that any witness has been convicted of a\r\n             crime shall be admitted if it involved dishonesty or false\r\n             statement, regardless of the punishment.\r\n\r\n\"Under Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE, if a crime is viewed as one involving dishonesty,\r\nthe court must admit the prior conviction because, prior convictions involving\r\ndishonesty or false statement must be admitted regardless of their probative value\r\nor prejudicial effect.\" State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 517, 633 S.E.2d 152, 155\r\n(2006); see State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 425-27, 578 S.E.2d 32, 43-44 (Ct. App.\r\n2003) (stating crimes involving dishonesty or false statements are \"automatically\r\nadmissible for impeachment purposes because they have the greatest probative\r\nvalue on the issue of truth and veracity\").\r\n\r\nOur supreme court held in State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 517, 633 S.E.2d 152, 155\r\n(2006) that \"a conviction for robbery, burglary, theft, and drug possession, beyond\r\nthe basic crime itself, is not probative of truthfulness.\" See United States v. Smith,\r\n181 F.Supp.2d 904 (N.D. Ill. 2002) (stating that since the government did not show\r\nthat any of the convictions of robbery, burglary, theft, or drug possession involved\r\nany false statements or acts of deceit beyond the basic crime itself, they were not\r\nadmissible under the Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a)(1)). Unlike in Al-Amin, our\r\nsupreme court has stated stealing is not always a crime of dishonesty if there are no\r\nadditional affirmative false statements or acts of deceit beyond the crime itself.\r\n\r\nIf the crime of armed robbery is not considered a crime of dishonesty under\r\n609(a)(2), it may still be admitted under Rule 609(a)(1), but it would be subject to\r\n\na balancing test. Under Rule 609(a)(1), the trial court must determine if the\r\nprobative value of admitting the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect to the\r\naccused. Moreover, our supreme court laid out other various factors to consider\r\nwhen determining whether to admit prior convictions under 609(a)(1): (1) the\r\nimpeachment value of the prior crime; (2) the point in time of the conviction and\r\nthe witness's subsequent history; (3) the similarity of the past crime and the\r\ncharged crime; (4) the importance of the defendant's testimony; and (5) the\r\ncentrality of the credibility issue. Bryant, 369 S.C. at 517 n.1, 633 S.E.2d at 155\r\nn.1 (citing State v. Martin, 347 S.C. 522, 530-31, 556 S.E.2d 706, 710-11 (Ct. App.\r\n2001)).\r\n\r\nAfter careful consideration of previous case law, we take this opportunity to follow\r\nBryant in deciding these prior armed robberies, without more, are not crimes of\r\ndishonesty.5 We are not ruling that the prior armed robberies are per se\r\ninadmissible; however, as the court in Bryant stated, to be admissible under Rule\r\n609(a)(2), there simply must be something beyond the basic crime. In the present\r\ncase, the State did not show any further affirmative false statements or acts of\r\ndeceit beyond the basic crime itself. Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in\r\nadmitting Broadnax's prior convictions of armed robbery pursuant to Rule\r\n609(a)(2), SCRE, and the probative value of Broadnax's prior armed robbery\r\nconvictions should have been weighed against their prejudicial effect prior to their\r\nadmission pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\r\n\"Error is harmless where it could not reasonably have affected the result of the\r\ntrial.\" Bryant, 369 S.C. at 518, 633 S.E.2d at 156 (citing In re Harvey, 355 S.C.\r\n53, 63, 584 S.E.2d 893, 897-98 (2003)). \"Generally, appellate courts will not set\r\naside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.\" Id. (citing\r\nState v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 175, 399 S.E.2d 595, 596 (1991)). \"Thus, an\r\ninsubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where a\r\ndefendant's guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no\r\nother rational conclusion can be reached.\" Id. (citing State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 4-\r\n5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 583-84 (1989)). \"The circumstances of each individual case are\r\nto be considered.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n5We recognize this court held in Al-Amin that armed robbery was a crime of\r\ndishonesty pursuant to Rule 609(a)(2). State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 425, 578\r\nS.E.2d 32, 43 (Ct. App. 2003). However, since Al-Amin, our supreme court has\r\ndecided Bryant.\r\n\nBecause Broadnax's prior convictions were the identical charge as the offense in\r\nthe present case, we cannot conclude Broadnax was not prejudiced by the\r\nadmission of those prior convictions. See State v. Howard, 396 S.C. 173, 180-81,\r\n720 S.E.2d 511, 515-16 (Ct. App. 2011); see also Bryant, 369 S.C. at 517-18, 633\r\nS.E.2d at 156 (holding that when a prior offense is similar to the charged offense\r\nthe \"danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant from impeachment by that prior\r\noffense weighs against its admission\"); State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 343-44, 529\r\nS.E.2d 71, 76-77 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding that the prior convictions are \"similar or\r\nidentical to charged offenses, and the likelihood of a high degree of prejudice to\r\nthe accused is inescapable\"). Because we find the admission of Broadnax's prior\r\narmed robberies created such a high degree of prejudice in this case, we reverse\r\nand remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nThe determination of this issue is dispositive, and thus, we decline to address\r\nBroadnax's remaining arguments relating to a solicitor's discretion in noticing\r\nLWOP and the trial court's denial of his request to inform the jury of his potential\r\nLWOP sentence. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating that if an appellate court's ruling on\r\na particular issue is dispositive of an appeal, rulings on remaining issues are\r\nunnecessary).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J. (concurring in part and dissenting in part): I agree with the\r\nmajority that Broadnax's prior armed robbery convictions, without more, were not\r\nadmissible under Rule 609(a)(2) for impeachment purposes, but would remand on\r\nthe issue of whether or not they could have been admitted under Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\r\nAs the majority notes, the South Carolina Supreme Court held in State v. Bryant,\r\n369 S.C. 511, 517, 633 S.E.2d 152, 155 (2006), that \"a conviction for robbery,\r\nburglary, theft, and drug possession, beyond the basic crime itself, is not probative\r\nof truthfulness.\" (emphasis added). By including the phrase \"beyond the basic\r\ncrime itself,\" the court has declined thus far to hold that such crimes are never\r\n\nprobative of truthfulness. Rather, in qualifying its ruling, it allowed for the\r\npossibility that upon a proper showing, a witness could be impeached by a\r\nconviction for not only one of these crimes, but convictions for other crimes that\r\nare rarely if ever recognized as crimes involving dishonesty or false statement. See\r\nid. (noting violations of narcotics laws as well as firearms violations, \"are\r\ngenerally not probative of truthfulness\" (emphasis added)). Therefore, our\r\nsupreme court has not completely prohibited the admission of convictions for\r\nrobbery, burglary, theft, drug possession or other narcotics violations, and firearms\r\nviolations under Rule 609(a)(2) if the proponent can show through evidence such\r\nas prior plea colloquies, indictments, or other reliable information from previous\r\nproceedings that the witness to be impeached gave a false statement or otherwise\r\nbehaved dishonestly when committing the offense leading to the conviction sought\r\nto be admitted. If so, the conviction at issue could be admitted in trial courts of\r\nthis State under Rule 609(a)(2) even though the underlying offense itself is not \"'in\r\nthe nature of crimen falsi, the commission of which involves some element of\r\ndeceit, untruthfulness, or falsification bearing on the accused's propensity to testify\r\ntruthfully.'\" State v. Shaw, 328 S.C. 454, 457 n.4, 492 S.E.2d 402, 404 n.4 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997) (quoting Notes of Conference Report, H.R. No. 93-1597, reprinted in 3\r\nWeinsteins's Evidence 609-39 (1976), quoted in United States v. Ortega, 561 F.2d\r\n803, 806 (9th Cir. 1977)).\r\n\r\nHere, the trial judge, relying on State v. Al-Amin, 353 S.C. 405, 578 S.E.2d 32 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2003), admitted Broadnax's prior armed robbery convictions for\r\nimpeachment purposes under Rule 609(a)(2) as crimes \"involv[ing] dishonesty or\r\nfalse statement.\" See Rule 609(a)(2), SCRE. I agree with the majority that Bryant,\r\nwhich was issued by the South Carolina Supreme Court after this court decided Al-\r\nAmin, gives guidance to this court. Armed robbery, absent presentation of facts\r\nand circumstances by the State to demonstrate an act of dishonesty or false\r\nstatement was involved in the crime, is not per se a crime that \"involved\r\ndishonesty or false statement\" that would be admissible under Rule 609(a)(2). As\r\nthe majority points out, the State did not show any false statements or dishonest\r\nconduct beyond the convictions themselves. Under Bryant, without this additional\r\ninformation, the corresponding armed robbery convictions would not be probative\r\nof Broadnax's truthfulness as a witness and would therefore be inadmissible under\r\nRule 609(a)(2).\r\n\r\nAs the majority has done, I agree it would then be appropriate to inquire whether\r\nBroadnax's prior armed robbery convictions could have been admitted under Rule\r\n\n609(a)(1).6 Under Rule 609(a)(1), evidence of these convictions \"shall be admitted\r\nif the court determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence\r\noutweighs its prejudicial effect to the accused.\" However, I am reluctant to have\r\nthis court make this determination without first giving the trial court the\r\nopportunity to rule on the issue. See State v. Scriven, 339 S.C. 333, 340, 529\r\nS.E.2d 71, 74 (Ct. App. 2000) (\"[Rule 609(a)(1)] requires the trial judge to balance\r\nthe probative value of the evidence for impeachment purposes against the prejudice\r\nto the accused.\" (emphasis added)). We have followed this practice even when the\r\nsimilarity between the prior offenses and the offense on which the accused was\r\ntried raised a potential for prejudice. See id. at 340-44, 529 S.E.2d at 74-77\r\n(holding the trial court must conduct a balancing test under Rule 609(a)(1) to\r\ndetermine whether an accused facing trial on charges for distributing cocaine and\r\nmarijuana could be impeached with his prior drug convictions).\r\n\r\nTherefore, I agree with the majority that the trial court erred in holding Broadnax's\r\nprior convictions for armed robbery were admissible for impeachment purposes\r\npursuant to Rule 609(a)(2), but would remand for a determination by the trial court\r\nof their admissibility for impeachment purposes pursuant to Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 The record indicates a reference was made to Rule 609(a)(1), SCRE, when\r\ncounsel presented their arguments as to whether Broadnax's convictions were\r\nadmissible to impeach his credibility, thus indicating that if the trial court\r\ndetermined they were not admissible under Rule 609(a)(2), the State was prepared\r\nto argue that they could be admitted under Rule 609(a)(1).\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5073","title":"Fortner v.

In this appeal from the Appellate Panel of\r\nthe Workers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel), SUA Insurance\r\nCompany (SUA) contends the Appellate Panel erred in finding Fortner was a\r\nstatutory employee of Thomas M. Evans Construction & Development, LLC\r\n(Evans Construction) at the time of his injuries. We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nFrom 2004 to 2006, Fortner worked for Evans Construction, owned by Thomas\r\nEvans, Jr. (Evans, Jr.). While Fortner was employed with Evans Construction,\r\nThomas Evans, III (Evans, III), son of Evans, Jr., worked as an onsite supervisor\r\nfor the company. Fortner left Evans Construction in 2006. In 2009, due to a\r\ndownturn in the economy, Evans, III also left Evans Construction and began his\r\nown company, Thomas Evans Custom Building and Renovations, Inc. (Custom\r\nBuilding). Evans, Jr. owns approximately one percent in Custom Building, while\r\nEvans, III has an undetermined ownership interest in Evans Construction from\r\nwhich he would benefit financially.\r\n\r\nCustom Building performs a large number of kitchen and bathroom renovations,\r\nwhereas Evans Construction performs more homebuilding \"from the ground up.\"\r\nInitially, Evans Construction allowed Custom Building to use its credit with\r\ndifferent accounts, i.e., building materials, because Custom Building had not yet\r\nestablished credit. Evans Construction's accounting department kept a running tab\r\nof those expenses, and Custom Building paid down its tab after a job completion.\r\n\nFurther, Evans Construction occasionally used Custom Building's employees for a\r\nspecific job, but not as permanent employees. When that occurred, the employee\r\nwould continue on Custom Building's payroll, and Evans Construction credited\r\nCustom Building's tab.\r\n\r\nWhile Evans, III was employed with Evans Construction, he secured a job on the\r\nSerenbetz property for the company, which consisted of a $600,000 makeover of\r\nthe home. Evans Construction was paid upon job completion in July of 2009.\r\nSubsequently, in 2010, the Serenbetz property suffered a suspected power surge\r\nthat caused the heating and air conditioner to malfunction and damaged the floors,\r\nwalls, and cabinets. Evans, III's company, Custom Building, was then hired to\r\nrepair the damage.\r\n\r\nIn March of 2010, Fortner took a position with Custom Building as a painting\r\nsupervisor on the Serenbetz property. Two weeks into Fortner's employment with\r\nCustom Building and the Friday before the accident, Evans, III asked Fortner to\r\npressure wash the Serenbetz property because the owners were returning to town,\r\nand the home \"needed . . . to look immaculate for when the owners got back.\"\r\nEvans, III further requested that Fortner locate a pressure washer for the task. On\r\nSunday, Fortner called and told Evans, III he could not find a pressure washer, and\r\nEvans, III asked Fortner to call him on Monday morning to remedy the situation.\r\nOn Monday morning, Evans, III told Fortner to meet him at a pressure washer\r\nrental store. While at the store, Evans, III rented the pressure washer with Custom\r\nBuilding's credit card, and then helped Fortner load it onto a truck to carry back to\r\nthe Serenbetz property. Fortner testified they unloaded the pressure washer once\r\nthey reached the Serenbetz property, and then Evans, III walked him through the\r\nhome to explain everything that needed to be fixed once he finished pressure\r\nwashing. Evans, III disputed this fact and stated he never took Fortner inside to\r\nshow him what needed to be fixed. However, they both agree Evans, III showed\r\nFortner that the air conditioner cover needed a coat of paint and impressed upon\r\nFortner the importance of \"making sure that the house was clean the best that [he]\r\ncould get it clean.\" After the walk-through, Evans, III left the Serenbetz property,\r\nand Fortner began pressure washing on the roof. While pressure washing, Fortner\r\nlost his balance and fell, sustaining injuries. A fellow worker called Evans, III to\r\ninform him of the accident and then called 911.\r\n\r\nEvans, Jr. testified he spoke with Evans, III on either a Saturday or Sunday about\r\nhiring Fortner as a replacement supervisor because Evans Construction's supervisor\r\nhad suffered a heart attack. Evans, Jr. claimed a change in employment occurred\r\nthe morning of April 19, 2010. Evans, Jr. admitted the decision had not been\r\n\ndiscussed with Fortner before his accident occurred. Evans, Jr. further asserted\r\nthat it was he, on behalf of Evans Construction, who asked Evans, III to power\r\nwash the Serenbetz property as a gesture of goodwill because Mr. Serenbetz was\r\ncoming to town, and Evans, Jr. wanted to \"look good.\" Evans Jr. explained it was\r\nmore convenient for Evans, III to take care of the task because Evans, III was\r\nworking at the Serenbetz property. Kelly Gabel, Evans Construction's office\r\nmanager, confirmed that Evans Construction's employees maintained properties\r\nthrough pressure washing them and performing lawn care services.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the accident, Evans, Jr. spoke with Evans, III several times, and\r\nhe alleged that at least one call was to confirm the pressure washing. Telephone\r\nrecords established that Evans, Jr. received calls from his son at 8:36 a.m. lasting\r\nabout ten minutes, at 9 a.m. lasting about seven minutes, at 9:30 a.m. lasting about\r\ntwo minutes, at 9:32 a.m. lasting about one minute, and 9:48 lasting about five\r\nminutes. Evans, Jr. asserted he was not aware of Fortner's accident until around 10\r\na.m., when Evans, III called to inform him of what had occurred. Additionally,\r\nEvans, Jr. claimed he did not know Evans, III was not carrying workers'\r\ncompensation insurance until a few days after Fortner's accident. Evans, III was\r\nunclear as to which phone call might have been the one informing Evans, Jr. of\r\nFortner's accident. However, Evans, III testified Fortner normally started work\r\naround 8 a.m., and his fall probably occurred around 8:10 a.m.\r\n\r\nFortner believed he was working for Evans, III until two days after his accident\r\nwhen his wife informed him that Evans, III told her at the hospital Fortner had\r\nbeen switched to Evans Construction's payroll on the morning of his accident.\r\nNeither Evans, Jr. nor Evans, III personally spoke with Fortner to tell him about\r\nthe change in employment. Fortner admitted Evans, III had spoken with him once\r\nbefore the accident regarding the possibility of working for both Custom Building\r\nand Evans Construction because the painting supervisor for Evans Construction\r\nhad suffered a heart attack. Fortner was told his services might be necessary to\r\n\"keep things going for both companies until they get someone to fill in for [the\r\nother supervisor].\" However, Fortner claimed that was the only notification he\r\nreceived regarding a potential change in his employment status. Fortner also stated\r\nhe would not have had any objections to working between the companies if that\r\nhad been necessary. He testified it was common for workers in the construction\r\nindustry to \"bounce back and forth between companies\" because they go where the\r\nwork is located.\r\n\r\nAfter Fortner's injuries, Evans, III, on behalf of Custom Building, issued two\r\nchecks to assist Fortner during his unemployment. Evans, Jr. and Gabel claimed\r\n\nEvans Construction credited Custom Building's tab for the checks, explaining that\r\nbecause Evans, III knew how to contact Fortner, it was more convenient for Evans,\r\nIII to give him the check.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing, the parties stipulated Fortner was entitled to workers' compensation\r\nbenefits as a result of his injury. Fortner and SUA contended Fortner was\r\nemployed by Custom Building at the time of his injury. Evans Construction,\r\nWorkers' Compensation Uninsured Employers' Fund (UEF), and Custom Building\r\nall maintained Fortner was either employed directly by Evans Construction, or\r\nalternatively, Evans Construction was the statutory employer of Fortner at the time\r\nof his injury. The single commissioner found Fortner to be the most credible of the\r\nwitnesses that testified, while Evans, Jr. and Benjamin Fortner, Jr., Fortner's father,\r\nwere marginally credible. The commissioner found Evans, III was not credible at\r\nall. The commissioner concluded that unless Fortner \"knew of and agreed to a new\r\nemployer-employee relationship with [Evans Construction], replacing the one\r\ntheretofore existing with [Custom Building], his rights under the Workers'\r\nCompensation Act [WCA] against his regular employer were unabridged.\" Thus,\r\nhe ruled that Custom Building, or UEF if Custom Building was unable or\r\nunwilling to pay, was liable. While the commissioner denied the argument that\r\nFortner was a direct employee of Evans Construction, he did not address the\r\nstatutory employer argument in his final order.\r\n\r\nEvans Construction, Custom Building, and UEF (collectively referred to as\r\nRespondents) filed applications for review with the Appellate Panel following the\r\nsingle commissioner's decision. The single issue before the Appellate Panel was\r\nwhether Thomas Evans Custom Building and Renovation (Custom Building) or\r\nEvans Construction would be held liable for Fortner's injuries. The Appellate\r\nPanel determined the commissioner erred in failing to find that Fortner was a\r\nstatutory employee of Evans Construction at the time of his accident, citing Ost v.\r\nIntegrated Prods., 296 S.C. 241, 371 S.E.2d 796 (1988). The Appellate Panel\r\nfound Fortner was under the direction and control of Evans Construction at the\r\ntime he was injured because it was Evans, Jr.'s decision to have the home pressure\r\nwashed. Further, because Evans, Jr. and Gabel testified that Evans Construction\r\nregularly performed pressure washing activities or contracted with others to\r\nperform the pressure washing, and Evans Construction owned its own pressure\r\nwashing equipment, the Appellate Panel concluded Fortner was performing an\r\nactivity within the general trade, business, or occupation of Evans Construction,\r\nthe principal employer. It further found Fortner was performing an activity that\r\nwas an integral part of the business because of the close business connection\r\nbetween the two companies, basing that finding largely on testimony from Evans,\r\n\nJr. and Evans, III. The Appellate Panel explicitly adopted the single\r\ncommissioner's findings of fact regarding the witnesses' credibility and amended\r\nthe commissioner's order to find that Fortner was a statutory employee of Evans\r\nConstruction pursuant to section 42-1-400 of the South Carolina Code (1985).\r\nSUA subsequently filed this appeal.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"The determination of whether a worker is a statutory employee is jurisdictional\r\nand, therefore, the question on appeal is one of law.\" Posey v.

Bellini, 359 S.C. 433, 440, 597 S.E.2d 863, 867 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-400: \"Owner\" and \"Subcontract\"\r\n\r\nSUA first argues the Appellate Panel erred in applying the three-part test set forth\r\nin Voss without initially determining whether Evans Construction was an \"owner\"\r\nfor purposes of the statute and whether there was a \"subcontract\" in place. We\r\ndisagree. See Voss v. Ramco, Inc., 325 S.C. 560, 568, 482 S.E.2d 582, 586 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1997).\r\n\r\nThe statutory employment section of the WCA provides:\r\n\n             When any person, in this section . . . referred to as\r\n             \"owner,\" undertakes to perform or execute any work\r\n             which is a part of his trade, business or occupation and\r\n             contracts with any other person (in this section . . .\r\n             referred to as \"subcontractor\") for the execution or\r\n             performance by or under such subcontractor of the whole\r\n             or any part of the work undertaken by such owner, the\r\n             owner shall be liable to pay to any workman employed in\r\n             the work any compensation under this Title which he\r\n             would have been liable to pay if the workman had been\r\n             immediately employed by him.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-400 (1985).\r\n\r\n\"Whatever the parties contract to call their relationship is not controlling in a\r\nstatutory employment analysis.\" Pineland, 337 S.C. at 322, 523 S.E.2d at 770; see\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-610 (1985) (\"No contract or agreement, written or implied,\r\nand no rule, regulation or other device shall in any manner operate to relieve any\r\nemployer, in whole or in part, of any obligation created by this Title except as\r\notherwise expressly provided in this Title.\"); see also Wilson v. Daniel Int'l Corp.,\r\n260 S.C. 548, 553, 197 S.E.2d 686, 688 (1973) (stating that the terminology used\r\nby the parties is not controlling of their relationship). \"The term 'owner' as used in\r\nSection 42-1-400 is synonymous with 'principal contractor'.\" Murray v. Aaron\r\nMizell Trucking Co., 286 S.C. 351, 354, 334 S.E.2d 128, 130 (Ct. App. 1985)\r\n(citing Marchbanks v. Duke Power Co., 190 S.C. 336, 362-63, 2 S.E.2d 825\r\n(1939)).\r\n\r\nDespite concern over the Appellate Panel's credibility findings, the record contains\r\nindisputable evidence that Evans, Jr., on behalf of Evans Construction, requested\r\nCustom Building to pressure wash the Serenbetz property for the purpose of\r\nengendering goodwill with the Serenbetzes. Custom Building accepted the request\r\nand had Fortner complete the task. Essentially, although Fortner was not aware of\r\nit, he was pressure washing the Serenbetz property at the direction of Evans\r\nConstruction. Custom Building paid Fortner for his hours spent pressure washing,\r\nand Evans Construction paid Custom Building by crediting its tab.\r\n\r\nEvans, Jr. and Evans, III created a contractor-subcontractor relationship between\r\nEvans Construction and Evans Custom Building with the agreement to pressure\r\nwash the Serenbetz property. The preponderance of the evidence supports the\r\nAppellate Panel's finding that section 42-1-400 applied to these facts.\r\n\nSection 41-1-410\r\n\r\nSUA maintains that because the Appellate Panel used the term \"contractor\" and\r\n\"owner\" interchangeably, it implicated section 42-1-410 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (1985). We disagree.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, the terms owner and contractor can be used interchangeably.\r\nMizell Trucking Co., 286 S.C. at 354, 334 S.E.2d at 130 (citing Marchbanks, 190\r\nS.C. at 362-63, 2 S.E.2d at 836). Accordingly, the Appellate Panel's word usage\r\ndoes not necessarily implicate a particular statute, and it specifically based its\r\ndecision on section 41-1-400.\r\n\r\nVoss Three-Part Analysis\r\n\r\nSUA contends even if section 42-1-400 applied to these facts, the Appellate Panel\r\nerred in determining that Evans Construction was Fortner's statutory employer.\r\nWe disagree.To determine whether the work performed by a\r\n            subcontractor is a part of the owner's business, this\r\n            [c]ourt must consider whether (1) the activity of the\r\n            subcontractor is an important part of the owner's trade or\r\n            business; (2) the activity performed by the subcontractor\r\n            is a necessary, essential, and integral part of the owner's\r\n            business; or (3) the identical activity performed by the\r\n            subcontractor has been performed by employees of the\r\n            owner.\r\n\r\nVoss, 325 S.C. at 568, 482 S.E.2d at 586 (citing Smith v. T.H. Snipes & Sons, Inc.,\r\n306 S.C. 289, 292, 411 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1991)). \"If any one of these tests is\r\nsatisfied, the injured worker is considered the statutory employee of the owner.\"\r\nId. (citing Riden v. Kemet Elecs. Corp., 313 S.C. 261, 263, 437 S.E.2d 156, 158\r\n(Ct. App. 1993)). \"Any doubts as to a worker's status are to be resolved in favor of\r\ncoverage under the [WCA].\" Id. (citing Riden, 313 S.C. at 263-64, 437 S.E.2d at\r\n158).\r\n\r\nEvans, Jr. stated Evans Construction owned pressure washers, but it was more\r\nlogical to rent one near the job site rather than to move one of the company's\r\npressure washers forty miles for just one job. He and Gabel testified that Evans\r\n\nConstruction's employees pressure wash properties on a consistent basis, the\r\nidentical activity performed by Fortner. Evidence in the record established that the\r\nthird prong of the Voss analysis was satisfied. Moreover, the purpose of having the\r\nSerenbetz property pressure washed was to engender goodwill. Evans, Jr. claimed\r\nmaintaining goodwill was crucial to Evans Construction's business, satisfying the\r\nfirst prong of the Voss analysis.\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of the evidence supports a finding that at least the first and\r\nthird prongs of the Voss test are fulfilled, and thus, Evans Construction was\r\nFortner's statutory employer. Accordingly, we affirm the Appellate Panel.\r\n\r\nPublic Policy\r\n\r\nSUA maintains by upholding the Appellate Panel's decision that Evans\r\nConstruction was Fortner's statutory employer, we would detrimentally expand the\r\nscope of the statutory employer doctrine. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe concept of statutory employment provides an exception to the general rule that\r\ncoverage under the WCA requires the existence of an employer-employee\r\nrelationship. Posey v. Proper Mold & Eng'g, Inc., 378 S.C. 210, 217, 661 S.E.2d\r\n395, 399 (Ct. App. 2008); see § 42-1-410. \"The statutory employee doctrine\r\nconverts conceded non-employees into employees for purposes of the [WCA]. The\r\nrationale is to prevent owners and contractors from subcontracting out their work\r\nto avoid liability for injuries incurred in the course of employment.\" Glass v. Dow\r\nChem. Co., 325 S.C. 198, 201 n.1, 482 S.E.2d 49, 50 n.1 (1997). \"The effect of . . .\r\n[statutory employment] provisions when brought into operation is to impose the\r\nabsolute liability of an immediate employer upon the owner and/or general\r\ncontractor although it was not in law the immediate employer of the injured\r\nworkman.\" Parker v.

We reverse.\r\n\nFACTS & PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nI.    The Practice\r\n\r\nColumbia Heart is a corporate medical practice that provides comprehensive\r\ncardiology services. Its physicians are all cardiologists, although each performs\r\ndifferent subspecialties within that field.\r\n\r\nJ. Kevin Baugh, M.D., and Barry J. Feldman, M.D. (collectively, Respondents) are\r\ncardiologists who had been shareholders and employees of Columbia Heart since\r\nbefore 2000. They specialize in interventional cardiology. Interventional\r\ncardiology is a subspecialty of general cardiology focusing on certain invasive\r\nprocedures such as the implantation of medical balloons and stents to unblock\r\narteries. Usually interventional cardiology must be performed in a hospital with\r\ncapability to perform open-heart surgery in case complications arise from\r\ninterventional procedures.\r\n\r\nII.   The Agreements\r\n\r\nWhen Respondents became shareholders, they each entered employment\r\nagreements that forfeited money payable to them upon termination if they\r\ncompeted with Columbia Heart in Lexington and Richland Counties within a year.\r\nThese agreements contained no other provisions that discouraged competition, and\r\ntheir consideration was a compensation system attached as an exhibit.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, Columbia Heart's shareholders embarked on the construction of a new\r\nmedical office building in Lexington County through a limited liability company\r\n(the LLC). The LLC was almost entirely owned by the shareholder-physicians of\r\nColumbia Heart. Columbia Heart was to be the anchor tenant, but it did not own\r\nany interest in the LLC. Each member of the LLC signed personal obligations on\r\nthe project debt in proportion to their equity in the LLC. Because of (1) the\r\ninvestment and liabilities undertaken by Columbia Heart's shareholders as\r\nmembers of the LLC and (2) a recent departure of a large number of Columbia\r\nHeart physicians, Columbia Heart sought to bind its shareholder-physicians more\r\ntightly to the medical practice. Thus, in July 2004 Columbia Heart's shareholder-\r\nphysicians entered into the agreements at issue (the Agreements).1\r\n\r\n1Columbia Heart's non-shareholder physicians had different employment\r\nagreements than its shareholders.\r\n\nThe Agreements contain two separate non-competition provisions, one in Article 4\r\nand one in Article 5. Section 4.5(i) of Article 4 provides the following:\r\n\r\n             Notwithstanding any other provision in this Agreement in\r\n             the event at any time during the twelve (12) month period\r\n             immediately following the expiration or termination (for\r\n             any reason, whether with or without Cause) of this\r\n             Agreement Physician continues or commences the active\r\n             practice of medicine in the field of cardiology within a\r\n             twenty (20) mile radius of any Columbia Heart office at\r\n             which Physician routinely provided services during the\r\n             year prior to the date of expiration or termination of this\r\n             Agreement, then Physician shall forfeit any monies\r\n             payable to Physician pursuant to this Section 4.5\r\n             following Physician's continuation or commencement of\r\n             the practice of medicine in violation of this Section\r\n             4.5(i).\r\n\r\nSection 5.1 of Article 5 says the following:\r\n\r\n             Physician, in the event of termination or expiration of\r\n             this agreement for any reason, during the twelve (12)\r\n             month period immediately following the date of\r\n             termination or expiration of this Agreement, shall not\r\n             Compete . . . with Columbia Heart.\r\n\r\nSection 5.2 defines specific terms \"[f]or purposes of Article 5\":\r\n\r\n             \"Compete\" means directly or indirectly, on his own\r\n             behalf or on behalf of any other Person, other than at the\r\n             direction of Columbia Heart and on behalf of Columbia\r\n             Heart: (A) organizing or owning any interest in a\r\n             business which engages in the Business in the Territory;\r\n             (B) engaging in the Business in the Territory; and (C)\r\n             assisting any Person (as director, officer, employee,\r\n             agent, consultant, lendor, lessor or otherwise) to engage\r\n             in the Business in the Territory.\r\n\n\"Business\" is defined as \"the practice of medicine in the field of cardiology.\"\r\n\"Territory\" is defined as \"the area within a twenty (20) mile radius of any\r\nColumbia Heart office at which Physician routinely provided services during the\r\nyear prior to the date of termination or expiration of this Agreement.\"\r\n\r\nNo separate monetary consideration was paid to any shareholder-physician to sign\r\nthe Agreements, nor did the Agreements change the compensation system\r\nestablished by Respondents' prior agreements.\r\n\r\nIII.     Respondents' Departure and Ensuing Litigation\r\n\r\nColumbia Heart opened a new office in the LLC's building in December 2005. In\r\nApril 2006, Respondents left Columbia Heart in accordance with the Agreements.\r\nTen shareholders remained.\r\n\r\nWithin a month after departing, Respondents opened a new practice, Lexington\r\nHeart Clinic, where they treated patients in cardiology and hired a number of\r\nColumbia Heart's administrative and medical support staff. Lexington Heart was\r\non the same campus as Columbia Heart's Lexington office, separated by an\r\napproximate distance of 300 yards. Columbia Heart's physicians were rotated in\r\npairs to work in its new Lexington office until the office closed in September 2006\r\nbecause of fiscal unsustainability.\r\n\r\nRespondents filed suit against Columbia Heart, raising a number of claims. They\r\nraised a declaratory judgment action against Columbia Heart, seeking two things:\r\n(1) a ruling that the Agreements contain unenforceable non-competition provisions\r\nand (2) injunctions to prohibit Columbia Heart from enforcing those provisions.\r\nRespondents also claimed violation of the Wage Payment Act, seeking treble\r\ndamages for unpaid compensation, plus costs and attorney's fees. Columbia Heart\r\nanswered and sought damages for contract and fiduciary duty counterclaims but\r\ndid not seek injunctive relief.\r\n\r\nThe trial court conducted a bench trial addressing Respondents' declaratory\r\njudgment and wage payment claims.2 It held the Agreements' non-competition\r\nprovisions unenforceable and awarded Respondents unpaid compensation under\r\nthe Wage Payment Act. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Trial will proceed on the remaining actions after these claims are resolved.\r\n\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1. \t    Did the trial court err in holding the Agreements contain unenforceable non-\r\n        competition provisions?\r\n\r\n2. \t    Did the trial court err in holding Respondents are entitled to unpaid\r\n        compensation under the Wage Payment Act?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one suit, the court is presented\r\nwith a divided scope of review, and each action retains its own identity as legal or\r\nequitable for purposes of review on appeal.\" Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 17, 640\r\nS.E.2d 486, 495 (Ct. App. 2006). \"The proper analysis is to view the actions\r\nseparately for the purpose of determining the appropriate standard of review.\" Id.\r\nat 17-18, 640 S.E.2d at 495.\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. \t    Declaratory Judgment Action\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Columbia Heart contends the Agreements' non-competition provisions\r\nare enforceable for a number of reasons. Respondents raise alternative sustaining\r\ngrounds. We address these arguments in turn.\r\n\r\nThe trial court found the Agreements were supported by consideration and subject\r\nto review for whether their non-competition provisions were reasonable. The court\r\naddressed the provisions in Article 5 and Article 4 separately. It found Article 5's\r\nterritory restriction was reasonable because the twenty-mile radius was necessary\r\nto protect Columbia Heart's legitimate business interests and was not unduly\r\nburdensome on Respondents' ability to earn a living. The court also found Article\r\n5's restriction against \"the practice of medicine in the field of cardiology\" was not\r\noverbroad. However, the court held Article 5's prohibition of \"assisting any Person\r\n. . . to engage in the [practice of medicine in the field of cardiology]\" was\r\nunreasonable under Preferred Research, Inc. v. Reeve3 and Faces Boutique, Ltd. v.\r\nGibbs.4 The court reasoned this restriction \"goes beyond restricting [Respondents]\r\n\r\n3   292 S.C. 545, 357 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n4   318 S.C. 39, 455 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\n\nfrom doing what they did for\" Columbia Heart and would bar them from assisting\r\nany cardiology practice \"in any capacity.\" The court thus held the restriction was\r\nnot necessary to protect a legitimate interest of Columbia Heart, and it found the\r\nrestriction could not be blue-penciled from the rest of Article 5. And as a result,\r\nthe court struck the entire covenant as unenforceable. In tandem, the court struck\r\nthe non-competition provision in Article 4 because the court found the provision\r\nwas a \"part of, intended to be part of, and cannot be logically separated from the\r\nconsequences of violating the non-compete provisions of Article 5.\"\r\n\r\nTo determine the standard of review for a claim brought under the Declaratory\r\nJudgment Act, we look to the main purpose of the complaint, as reflected by the\r\ncharacter of the claims, evidence, and relief sought. Cullen v. McNeal, 390 S.C.\r\n470, 481, 702 S.E.2d 378, 384 (Ct. App. 2010). Respondents' declaratory\r\njudgment claim seeks a determination that the Agreements' non-competition\r\nprovisions are unreasonable and an injunction. An injunction is an equitable\r\nremedy, and the interpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law, as\r\nis the question of whether a non-competition clause is reasonable. Madden v. Bent\r\nPalm Invs., LLC, 386 S.C. 459, 467, 688 S.E.2d 597, 601 (Ct. App. 2010);\r\nPreferred Research, 292 S.C. at 547-48, 357 S.E.2d at 490. Thus, we interpret the\r\nAgreements and address necessary factual questions involving the declaratory\r\njudgment action de novo. Milliken & Co. v. Morin, 399 S.C. 23, 30, 731 S.E.2d\r\n288, 291 (2012); Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221\r\nS.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).\r\n\r\n\"While recognizing the legitimate interest of a business in protecting its clientele\r\nand goodwill, we are equally concerned with the right of a person to use his talents\r\nto earn a living.\" Sermons v. Caine & Estes Ins. Agency, Inc., 275 S.C. 506, 509,\r\n273 S.E.2d 338, 338 (1980). Therefore, restrictions on competition \"are generally\r\ndisfavored and will be strictly construed against the employer.\" Rental Uniform\r\nServ. of Florence, Inc. v. Dudley, 278 S.C. 674, 675, 301 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1983).\r\nHence, they \"must be narrowly drawn to protect the legitimate interests of the\r\nemployer.\" Faces Boutique, 318 S.C. at 42, 455 S.E.2d at 708. Such an\r\narrangement is enforceable only if it is (1) supported by valuable consideration; (2)\r\nnecessary to protect the employer in some legitimate interest; (3) not unduly harsh\r\nand oppressive in curtailing the employee's legitimate efforts to earn a livelihood;\r\nand (4) otherwise reasonable from the standpoint of sound public policy. Rental\r\nUniform Serv., 278 S.C. at 675-76, 301 S.E.2d at 143. The arrangement must be\r\nreasonably limited \"with respect to time and place,\" but an otherwise reasonable\r\nlimitation on the solicitation of former clients can substitute for a territory\r\nrestriction. Rental Uniform Serv., 278 S.C. at 675-76, 301 S.E.2d at 143; Wolf v.\r\n\nColonial Life & Acc. Ins. Co., 309 S.C. 100, 109, 420 S.E.2d 217, 222 (Ct. App.\r\n1992).\r\n\r\nA.      The Agreements Are Subject to Reasonableness Review\r\n\r\nColumbia Heart argues the trial court erred in finding the Agreements' non-\r\ncompetition provisions are unenforceable. Columbia Heart contends that under\r\nJ.W. Hunt & Co. v. Davis, 5 the non-competition provisions are not subject to\r\nreasonableness review because Respondents were two of twelve shareholders in a\r\nprofessional association that operates \"in practice\" as a partnership.6 The trial\r\ncourt rejected this argument, and so do we.\r\n\r\nIn J.W. Hunt & Co. v. Davis, an accounting partnership sued a former partner for\r\nproviding services to the partnership's clients after resigning from the partnership.\r\n313 S.C. at 353, 437 S.E.2d at 558. The firm sought to enforce a provision in the\r\npartnership agreement. Id. While an earlier partnership agreement \"prohibited a\r\nwithdrawing partner from rendering any accounting services to the partnership's\r\nclients for a five year period,\" the provision in issue stated the following:\r\n\r\n               In the event a partner . . . leaves the employ of the Firm\r\n               and such Partner either \"directly or indirectly\" within a\r\n               period of three (years) of such departure from the Firm\r\n               does work for former or existing clients of the Firm, such\r\n               [P]artner shall pay the following as liquidated damages\r\n               . . . . The meaning of \"directly or indirectly\" is that such\r\n               Partner will not render public accounting services in any\r\n               of its phases . . . .\r\n\r\nId. at 353 n.1, 437 S.E.2d at 558 n.1. The trial court held the provision was not\r\nsubject to review for whether it was a reasonable restraint on trade. Id. This court\r\nagreed. Id. It reasoned the provision was not a \"covenant not to compete\" because\r\nit \"neither prohibit[ed] [the withdrawing partner] from practicing public accounting\r\nfor any specific period of time nor from servicing any client in any specific\r\n\r\n5   313 S.C. 352, 437 S.E.2d 557 (Ct. App. 1993) (cert. denied).\r\n6As an alternative sustaining ground, Respondents argue Columbia Heart\r\nconceded the Agreements were subject to reasonableness review. We disagree.\r\nThe issue was never conceded and is otherwise preserved.\r\n\ngeographic region.\" Id. at 355, 437 S.E.2d at 559. The provision instead\r\n\"allow[ed] a withdrawing partner to service former clients provided the partner\r\npays the partnership liquidated damages calculated by using a formula prescribed\r\nby [the provision].\" Id. at 353, 437 S.E.2d at 558. The court also distinguished its\r\ncircumstances from the facts of a case where our supreme court held a provision\r\nwas subject to reasonableness review, Almers v. South Carolina National Bank,\r\n265 S.C. 48, 217 S.E.2d 135 (1975).\r\n\r\nIn Almers, a vice president was covered under a profit sharing program with his\r\nemployer bank. Id. at 50, 217 S.E.2d at 135. He had acquired an 85% vested\r\ninterest in the program as he departed to work for another bank in substantially the\r\nsame duties. Id. After he left, his former bank terminated his benefits under the\r\nprogram pursuant to the following provision in the plan:\r\n\r\n             Notwithstanding anything in this Plan to the contrary, no\r\n             benefit shall be paid hereunder subsequent to the date any\r\n             Participant, former Participant or Retired Employee\r\n             enters any employment in the State of South Carolina, if\r\n             in the opinion of the Board such employment is in\r\n             competition with or to the detriment of The South\r\n             Carolina National Bank of Charleston.\r\n\r\nId. at 50-51, 217 S.E.2d at 136. On appeal, our supreme court acknowledged this\r\nprovision was not \"the classic example of a direct restraint\" on competition, the\r\n\"covenant not to compete.\" Id. at 51, 217 S.E.2d at 136. The court instead\r\ncharacterized the provision as a \"forfeiture clause\" and noted that \"the consequence\r\n[of the clause] is not the inability to engage in competitive employment, but the\r\nforfeiture of pecuniary benefits should [the bank] . . . determine that an employee\r\nwith accrued benefits had\" competed against the bank. Id. at 52, 217 S.E.2d at\r\n136. Despite the distinction, the court held that \"a forfeiture clause in a profit or\r\npension plan which provides that upon employment with a competitor a participant\r\nis divested of rights under the plan is invalid unless\" it satisfies the same\r\nreasonableness review applied to covenants not to compete. Id. at 56, 217 S.E.2d\r\nat 138-39.\r\n\r\nIn rejecting the Almers analogy, the J.W. Hunt court explained the following:\r\n\r\n             Unlike Almers, there is no employment relationship\r\n             involved in this case. Instead, the relationship here is a\r\n             partnership agreement between partners with equal\r\n\n               bargaining power. When Article VII was adopted in\r\n               1986, Davis formally assented to Article VII by signing\r\n               the agreement. Although the partnership agreement was\r\n               subsequently amended five times, Article VII remained\r\n               intact. As opposed to the sole protection of an\r\n               employer's interest accomplished through the forfeiture\r\n               of accrued benefits in Almers, Article VII, a provision for\r\n               which Davis bargained, afforded Davis protection against\r\n               withdrawing partners from the time of the Article's\r\n               adoption until Davis' withdrawal in 1990.\r\n\r\nId. at 355-56, 437 S.E.2d at 559-60 (citations omitted) (alterations in original).\r\n\r\nJ.W. Hunt does not apply to the provisions of this case. First, the Agreements are\r\ncontracts of employment.\r\n\r\nFurther, the non-competition provisions in the Agreements are substantively\r\ndifferent than the provision in J.W. Hunt. Unlike the provision in J.W. Hunt,\r\nArticle 5's non-competition provision is a covenant not to compete. Section 5.1\r\ndirectly prohibits certain types of competitive conduct within a certain territory for\r\na certain period of time. None of our courts have declined to apply a\r\nreasonableness analysis to covenants not to compete, and thus, Section 5.1 is\r\nsubject to reasonableness review. Like the provision in J.W. Hunt, Article 4's non-\r\ncompetition provision is not a covenant not to compete. Unlike in J.W. Hunt,\r\nhowever, Article 4's provision is a forfeiture clause. While the clause in J.W. Hunt\r\nrequired the partner to pay a certain amount upon competition, Article 4 upon\r\ncompetition divests Respondents' rights to \"any monies payable to Physician\r\npursuant to this Section 4.5\" under the Agreements. Forfeiture clauses are\r\ngenerally subject to reasonableness review, and none of our courts have declined to\r\napply a reasonableness analysis to forfeitures. See also Wolf, 309 S.C. at 106, 420\r\nS.E.2d at 220 (providing forfeiture clauses \"are subject to the same requirements\r\nand strict analysis as covenants not to compete\") (per curiam).\r\n\r\nB.       Article 5's Activity Restriction Is Reasonable\r\n\r\nColumbia Heart also argues the trial court erred in finding Article 5's restriction\r\nagainst assisting a person to engage in the practice of medicine in the field of\r\ncardiology is not necessary to protect a legitimate interest of Columbia Heart.7\r\n\r\n7   No party contends Article 4's activity restriction is unreasonable.\r\n\nColumbia Heart specifically contends the covenant's prohibition against assisting\r\nthe practice of medicine in the field of cardiology is necessary to prevent\r\nRespondents from indirectly engaging in activities they clearly could not\r\nparticipate in directly. We agree.\r\n\r\nHere, the record evidences that Columbia Heart's patients, referral sources, and\r\nother goodwill would be at risk if Respondents were able to assist others to engage\r\nin the practice of cardiology. Patients stay with and follow their doctors, and\r\ngeneral practitioners refer patients to cardiologists based upon both the reputation\r\nof the doctor and the doctor's practice, current and past. If the Agreements did not\r\nprohibit Respondents from assisting another person to engage in the practice of\r\nmedicine in the field of cardiology, Respondents could treat Columbia Heart's\r\npatients and use Columbia Heart's referral sources and goodwill simply by staying\r\none step from the medical services provided. Therefore, the restriction is\r\nnecessary to protect a legitimate interest of Columbia Heart.\r\n\r\nRespondents maintain this case is controlled by Preferred Research, Inc. v. Reeve\r\nand Faces Boutique, Ltd. v. Gibbs. However, those cases are inapposite.\r\n\r\nIn Preferred Research, an attorney executed a licensing agreement to perform real\r\nestate title work and related services for a company. 292 S.C. at 546, 357 S.E.2d at\r\n489. The agreement described the company's business as \"a national service in the\r\nfields of courthouse records research and verification, title searches, title insurance\r\ncommitments and policies, loan closings, real estate appraising, credit\r\ninvestigations, examination of records affecting title to real estate and personal\r\nproperty and related services.\" Id. at 548, 357 S.E.2d at 490. The agreement\r\nfurther provided the following:\r\n\r\n             In the event of termination of this Agreement for any\r\n             reason whatsoever, Licensee shall not thereafter engage\r\n             either directly or indirectly as principal or employee,\r\n             alone or in association with others, in a similar business,\r\n             in any capacity, to that licensed and established\r\n             hereunder within an airline radius of twenty-five (25)\r\n             miles of any of Licensee's places of business established\r\n             under this Agreement and within the Territory described\r\n             in Exhibit \"B\" attached hereto and by reference\r\n             incorporated herein, for a period of twelve (12) months.\r\n\nId. at 547, 357 S.E.2d at 490. Applying Georgia law, this court held the activity\r\nrestriction was broader than necessary to protect the company because it would\r\nprevent the attorney from working in any capacity for any employer who engaged\r\nin any of the activities encompassed by the company's business. Id. at 548, 357\r\nS.E.2d at 490.\r\n\r\nIn Faces Boutique, a facial spa that provided skin care and face lifts employed the\r\ndefendant, an esthetician who performed facials. 318 S.C. at 41, 455 S.E.2d at\r\n708. The defendant's employment contract contained the following covenant:\r\n\r\n             For a period of three (3) years after the termination of\r\n             this agreement, the Employee will not, WITHIN THE\r\n             TOWN OF HILTON HEAD ISLAND, SC, directly or\r\n             indirectly, own, manage, operate, control, be employed\r\n             by, participate in, or be connected in any manner with the\r\n             ownership, management, operation, advertisement or\r\n             control of any business in direct competition with the\r\n             type of business conducted by [Employer].\r\n\r\nId. The court held the covenant restricted the defendant's employment\r\nopportunities beyond what was necessary for the protection of the spa's legitimate\r\nbusiness interests. Id. a 43, 455 S.E.2d at 708. It reasoned the owner of the spa\r\nadmitted the covenant prohibited the defendant from being employed \"at any place\r\nof business engaged in the selling of cosmetics or giving facials, even if [the\r\ndefendant] herself did not participate in these activities\" and \"even though, in such\r\na situation, [the] business would not be threatened.\" Id.\r\n\r\nThe \"any capacity\" restrictions employed in Preferred Research and Faces\r\nBoutique are broader than the restriction here. Article 5 only prohibits \"assisting\r\nany Person . . . to engage in [the practice of medicine in the field of cardiology].\"\r\nAssuming Respondents do not violate the other restrictions, they could work for a\r\nbusiness that practices medicine in the field of cardiology so long as they do not\r\nassist a person to engage in the practice of cardiology. Although Respondents do\r\nnot contest that they breached the restrictions here, whether a shareholder-\r\nphysician has actually assisted someone to engage in the practice of medicine in\r\nthe field of cardiology could be a question of fact in other cases.\r\nWe accordingly find the trial court erred in determining the scope of activity\r\nrestricted by Article 5's covenant not to compete was unreasonable. We thus must\r\nconsider Respondents' additional grounds for sustaining the trial court's finding\r\nthat the Agreements' non-competition provisions are unenforceable.\r\n\nC.    The Agreements Are Supported by New Consideration\r\n\r\nRespondents contend as an additional sustaining ground that the Agreements are\r\nunenforceable because they are not supported by new consideration. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"[W]hen a covenant [not to compete] is entered into after the inception of\r\nemployment, separate consideration, in addition to continued at-will employment,\r\nis necessary in order for the covenant to be enforceable.\" Poole v. Incentives\r\nUnlimited, Inc., 345 S.C. 378, 382, 548 S.E.2d 207, 209 (2001). \"[T]here is no\r\nconsideration when the contract containing the covenant is exacted after several\r\nyears' employment and the employee's duties and position are left unchanged.\" Id.\r\n\r\nRespondents executed the Agreements after they became employed by Columbia\r\nHeart, and the Agreements did not change the general compensation system agreed\r\nto by the parties under their prior employment contracts. However, Section 4.5(l)\r\nof Article 4 of the Agreements provides the following:\r\n\r\n            Physician shall be paid Five Thousand and No/100\r\n            Dollars ($5,000.00) per month for each of the twelve (12)\r\n            months following termination, so long as the Physician is\r\n            not in violation of Article 5 of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nThis language established that Columbia Heart promised to pay each Respondent a\r\ntotal of $60,000 over twelve months after termination so long as they did not\r\nviolate the non-competition provision in Article 5. In Article 5, Respondents\r\npromise not to compete with Columbia Heart, and the parameters of that promise\r\nare more restrictive than the covenants in the prior agreements. Consequently, the\r\nAgreements are supported by new consideration. See Evatt v. Campbell, 234 S.C.\r\n1, 8, 106 S.E.2d 447, 451 (1959) (\"Mutual promises . . . constitute a good\r\nconsideration.\").\r\n\r\nRespondents maintain Columbia Heart's promise to pay $60,000 in severance after\r\ntermination was illusory because they will not receive the money if they compete\r\nin violation of Article 5. However, a promise is not illusory merely because its\r\nenforceability depends upon the performance of a reciprocal promise.\r\nConsequently, the Agreements are supported by new consideration.\r\n\nD.       Article 5's Territory Restriction Is Reasonable\r\n\r\nAs a further additional sustaining ground, Respondents argue the Agreements' non-\r\ncompetition provisions are unenforceable because Article 5's territory restriction is\r\nunreasonable.8 Respondents maintain the nearest medical facilities outside the\r\nterritory restriction that are authorized to perform elective invasive procedures\r\ncritical to their subspecialty, interventional cardiology, are 55 miles away. In other\r\nwords, they argue the territory restriction would in practical effect force them to\r\nmake a significant relocation in order to perform their practice. They contend the\r\nterritory restriction is therefore not tied to a legitimate interest of Columbia Heart\r\nand constitutes an unduly oppressive restraint on their ability to earn a living. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nHere, the territory restriction is necessary to protect a legitimate interest of\r\nColumbia Heart. The plain terms of the restriction prohibit Respondents from\r\ncompeting within a 20-mile radius of Columbia Heart offices at which\r\nRespondents \"routinely provided services\" during the last year of their\r\nemployment. At the height of its size, Columbia Heart had permanent offices in\r\nProvidence Hospital, Palmetto Richland Memorial Hospital, and Lexington\r\nMedical Center, as well as clinics throughout the state. Respondents worked\r\nprimarily at Columbia Heart's Lexington and Richland County offices. Although\r\nColumbia Heart receives referrals from all over South Carolina, most of its\r\nphysicians' patients come from the county where the physicians' main office is\r\nlocated. The restriction is limited to areas where Respondents primarily dealt with\r\nColumbia Heart patients, and no evidence in the record shows a large number of\r\nthese patients were located within a distance significantly smaller than the 20-mile\r\nradius. See Stringer v. Herron, 309 S.C. 529, 532, 424 S.E.2d 547, 548 (Ct. App.\r\n1992) (holding a covenant in an employment contract unreasonable where it\r\nprohibited a veterinarian from competing against his prior veterinary medicine\r\npractice \"within fifteen miles of any veterinary practice operated by the employer\r\n. . . at the time of termination of employment\" because the 15 mile radius around\r\neach location overlapped with the others and reached into adjoining counties and\r\nanother state despite the fact that the \"overwhelming majority\" of the practice's\r\nclients \"lived much closer than 15 miles from at least one of the practice\r\nlocations\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8   No party contends Article 4's territory restriction is unreasonable.\r\n\nFurther, the fact that the practical effect of the territory restriction will make it\r\ndifficult for Respondents to practice their subspecialty in interventional cardiology\r\ndoes not indicate under our facts that the restriction is unnecessary to protect\r\nColumbia Heart's legitimate interests. See Rental Uniform Serv., 278 S.C. at 676,\r\n301 S.E.2d at 143 (\"A geographic restriction is generally reasonable if the area\r\ncovered by the restraint is limited to the territory in which the employee was able,\r\nduring the term of his employment, to establish contact with his employer's\r\ncustomers.\"). Such an argument more appropriately addresses whether the\r\ncovenant is unduly oppressive.\r\n\r\nIn this case, the territory restriction's practical effect on Respondents' practice is\r\nnot unduly harsh or oppressive in curtailing their legitimate efforts to earn a\r\nlivelihood. Respondents highlight Cardiovascular Surgical Specialists, Corp. v.\r\nMammana9 for their argument that the territory restriction is unreasonable because\r\nof the practical effect on Respondents' practices. There, a medical practice\r\nspecializing in cardiovascular and thoracic surgery imposed a covenant not to\r\ncompete that prohibited one of its surgeons from, among other things, owning,\r\noperating, or participating in cardiovascular or thoracic surgery for two years after\r\ntermination. 61 P.3d at 213-14. Testimony indicated the prohibition would\r\neffectively bar the physician from practicing in cardiovascular and thoracic surgery\r\nwithin 100 miles of his former practice's location due to the remoteness of other\r\nhospitals. Id. at 214. The court struck the restriction because the employer\r\ntestified, \"It would be unlikely that if the non-compete was abided by, that\r\nsomeone would stay in the community for two years, not practice, and then have a\r\nviable practice at the end of two years.\" Id. The court further rejected the\r\nargument that the physician could switch to another medical specialty. Id.\r\n\r\nUnlike in Mammana, Columbia Heart is a full-service cardiology practice, and\r\nRespondents specialized in general cardiology, with a subspecialty in\r\ninterventional cardiology. While the restriction in Mammana prevented the\r\nphysician from practicing in his field far beyond the technical terms of the\r\nprovision, here Respondents can continue to practice in their field—offering\r\ncardiology services not involving interventional cardiology—outside the 20-mile\r\nradius.10 Moreover, Respondents have not established their inability to perform\r\n\r\n9   61 P.3d 210 (Okla. 2002).\r\n10Both sides' testimony indicates that interventional procedures constitute only 5 to\r\n10% of Respondents' time. Further, one witness testified interventional cardiology\r\nconstitutes \"probably three or four percent\" of Respondents' income \"at most.\"\r\n\ninterventional procedures would prevent them from having a viable practice after\r\nthe one-year period. The evidence indicates board certification in interventional\r\ncardiology lasts for ten years, and Respondents' ability to obtain credentialing in\r\nthat field after the one-year period would depend upon subsequent negotiations\r\nbetween Respondents and the hospitals at which they attempt to obtain\r\ncredentialing. Consequently, Respondents have not shown the restriction would be\r\nunduly burdensome on their ability to earn a living, and the trial court did not err in\r\nfinding the territory restriction in Article 5's covenant was reasonable.11\r\n\r\nE. \t   Article 5 and Article 4 Are Subject to Review for Whether They Contain\r\n       Penalties\r\n\r\nAs another sustaining ground, Respondents assert the Agreements' non-\r\ncompetition provisions are not enforceable because they contain penalties for\r\nviolation of their restrictions. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"Parties to a contract may stipulate as to the amount of liquidated damages owed in\r\nthe event of\" breach. Foreign Academic & Cultural Exch. Servs., Inc. v. Tripon,\r\n394 S.C. 197, 204, 715 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2011). They likewise may stipulate that a\r\nbreaching party will lose a right to which the party is entitled under the agreement.\r\nTate v. Le Master, 231 S.C. 429, 441-42, 99 S.E.2d 39, 45-46 (1957) (providing\r\nthat parties may stipulate to the \"forfeiture\" of rights under a contract). However,\r\nif the stipulation is a penalty, it will not be enforced. Foreign Academic, 394 S.C.\r\nat 204, 715 S.E.2d at 334; Tate, 231 S.C. at 442, 99 S.E.2d at 46.\r\n\r\nWhether a provision is a penalty is a question of construction and is generally\r\ndetermined by the intention of the parties. Tate, 231 S.C. at 429, 99 S.E.2d at 39.\r\n\"When the language of a contract is clear, explicit, and unambiguous, the language\r\nof the contract alone determines the contract's force and effect and the court must\r\nconstrue it according to its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.\" ERIE Ins. Co. v.\r\n\r\nAnother witness testified 90% of cardiology patients are managed medically, and\r\nless than 10% require interventional procedures each year.\r\n11 We do not address the trial court's findings that Article 4 and Article 5's non-\r\ncompetition provisions were intended to operate together in all cases and were thus\r\nunenforceable because Article 5 contained an unreasonable activity restriction. We\r\nfind Article 5 enforceable. Therefore, the argument that Article 4 must fail\r\nbecause Article 5 fails does not apply to this case.\r\n\nWinter Consrt. Co., 393 S.C. 455, 461, 713 S.E.2d 318, 321 (Ct. App. 2011). We\r\nmust \"look at the whole contract, its subject-matter, the ease or difficulty in\r\nmeasuring the breach in damages and the magnitude of the stipulated sum, not only\r\nas compared with the value of the subject of the contract, but in proportion to the\r\nprobable consequences of the breach.\" Id. at 460, 713 S.E.2d at 322 (quoting\r\nFoster v. Roach, 119 S.C. 102, 107, 111 S.E. 897, 899 (1922)). Where the\r\nstipulation \"is reasonably intended by the parties as the predetermined measure of\r\ncompensation for actual damages that might be sustained by reason of\r\nnonperformance, the stipulation is for liquidated damages.\" Tate, 231 S.C. at 440,\r\n99 S.E.2d at 45-46. \"However, where the stipulation is not based upon\r\ncontemplated actual damages but is intended to provide punishment for breach of\r\nthe contract, it is a penalty.\" Moser v. Gosnell, 334 S.C. 425, 432, 513 S.E.2d 123,\r\n126 (Ct. App. 1999). The stipulation will be deemed a penalty if it \"is so large that\r\nit is plainly disproportionate to any probable damage resulting from breach of\r\ncontract.\" Lewis v. Premium Inv. Corp., 351 S.C. 167, 172, 568 S.E.2d 361, 363\r\n(2002).\r\n\r\nIt is clear the Agreements' remedies were created in part to deter departures from\r\nthe practice. However, that fact does not by itself indicate the remedies are\r\npenalties. A stipulation for breach will often serve as a disincentive to breach.\r\nHere, the probable damages caused by a shareholder-physician's competition\r\nwould have been difficult to estimate at the time the Agreements were created.\r\nAlthough patients follow their doctors, the continuance of that relationship relies\r\nupon the uncertain actions and feelings of the patients. Further, Columbia Heart\r\ngenerates income through the delivery of services, and the practice's accounts\r\nreceivable does not reflect what the company actually collects through those\r\nservices. In this particular practice, the accounts receivable actually collected\r\nranged between 37% and 48%. Lastly, the parties entered the Agreements\r\nknowing Columbia Heart itself planned to—and did—incur $5 million in debt to\r\nfurnish its space in the LCC's Lexington building with equipment and furniture.\r\nThe practice's ability to utilize these assets thus would depend upon the physicians'\r\nabilities to continue or increase services provided. As a result, the effect of a\r\ndoctor's departure on a practice's business, while expected to be negative, would\r\nhave been highly uncertain.\r\n\r\n1.    Article 5's Stipulated Damages Provision Is Not a Penalty\r\n\r\nArticle 5 provides remedies \"available to Columbia Heart in the event of a breach\r\nof\" the covenant. Those remedies included Section 5.4(a), a stipulated damages\r\nprovision:\r\n\n             In the event that Physician, at his or her option, desires to\r\n             practice in violation of the provisions contained in\r\n             Section 5.1, Physician shall pay Columbia Heart\r\n             liquidated damages in advance of practicing in violation\r\n             of that Section in an amount equal to One Hundred\r\n             Percent (100%) of Physician's Income . . . . For purposes\r\n             of this Agreement, \"Physician's Income\" shall mean the\r\n             average W-2 compensation of physician-shareholders of\r\n             Columbia Heart in the calendar year prior to the date of\r\n             termination or expiration of this Agreement.\r\n\r\n             These damages are in partial restitution for the loss or\r\n             damage which Columbia Heart will suffer as a result of\r\n             such breach and in partial recovery of its investment in\r\n             the practice of Physician, which together constitute full\r\n             payment of such losses or damages. Notwithstanding\r\n             anything to the contrary stated herein, payment of such\r\n             liquidated damages (together with the forfeiture\r\n             described in Article 4 above) will entitle Physician to\r\n             practice in breach of the provisions contained in Section\r\n             5.1 without further liability to Columbia Heart for such\r\n             breach.\r\n\r\nArticle 5 subsequently states:\r\n\r\n             Physician has carefully read and considered the\r\n             provisions of this Agreement and agrees that the\r\n             restrictions set forth herein, particularly those in Sections\r\n             5.1, 5.2, . . . , and 5.4 (together with the remedy set forth\r\n             in Article 4), are fair and reasonably required for the\r\n             protection of Columbia Heart.\r\n\r\nArticle 5's stipulated damages provision is not a penalty. It reasonably attempted\r\nto provide a conservative estimate of damages sustained by Columbia Heart when\r\na shareholder-physician departed and competed. The parties agreed at trial that the\r\namount established by the average shareholder-physician's taxable income from the\r\nyear before equaled roughly $591,710 and that Respondents are financially able to\r\npay that amount. Further, Respondents' taxable income for each year was\r\ngenerally \"six figures\" less than the net revenue earned by each shareholder-\r\n\nphysician for the practice. Because patients tend to follow their doctors, the use of\r\na physician's W-2 income for the prior year is a logical estimate of the income to\r\nbe lost by the practice when the physician leaves. The provision further contains\r\nan acknowledgment the stipulated amount reflects a portion of the damages\r\nColumbia Heart would suffer from breach. Consequently, the stipulated damages\r\nprovision is enforceable. Cf. ERIE Ins. Co., 393 S.C. at 461, 464, 713 S.E.2d at\r\n321, 322 (holding the language of a contract that imposed a 15% fee to cover the\r\nburden of overseeing completion of a project after the project's breach was\r\nreasonably intended as a predetermined measure of loss from breach because it\r\nvaried the recoverable damages based upon the outstanding work).\r\n\r\n2. \t   Article 4's Forfeiture Is Not a Penalty\r\n\r\nArticle 4's forfeiture provides that if Respondents competed with Columbia Heart\r\nin violation of Article 4, they \"shall forfeit any monies payable to [them] pursuant\r\nto this Section 4.5.\" Section 4.5(l) provides that upon termination, Respondents\r\nwere entitled to $60,000. Section 4.5(f) provides that upon termination without\r\ncause, Respondents were entitled to:\r\n\r\n             (i) \t   All salary earned or accrued but unpaid as of the\r\n                     date of [termination]12; and\r\n\r\n             (ii) \t Physician's Prorata Share of the Current Year's\r\n                    Actual Collection Percentage of the accounts\r\n                    receivable of Columbia Heart, computed on the\r\n                    date of termination of this Agreement.\r\n\r\nArticle 4 defined \"Physician's Prorata Share\" and \"Current Year's Actual\r\nCollection Percentage.\" Those definitions indicate the shareholder-physician is\r\nentitled to a percentage of the accounts receivable earned by Columbia Heart\r\nbetween the beginning of the fiscal year and time of termination (the defined share\r\nof accounts receivable). The percentage of earned accounts receivable is based\r\nupon the shareholder-physician's ownership in Columbia Heart at termination and\r\nthe percentage of accounts receivable actually collected by Columbia Heart in the\r\nlast fiscal year.\r\n\r\n\r\n12This section states \"Physician's death,\" but every party agrees the language is a\r\ntypo.\r\n\nSection 4.6 of Article 4 provides:\r\n\r\n             Physician acknowledges that the forfeiture described in\r\n             Section 4.5(i) is intended as partial restitution for the\r\n             damages which Columbia Heart will suffer as a result of\r\n             competition by Physician with Columbia Heart.\r\n             Physician further acknowledges that such forfeiture . . . ,\r\n             is fair and reasonably required for the protection of\r\n             Columbia Heart.\r\n\r\nLike Article 5's stipulated damages provision, Article 4's forfeiture is not a penalty.\r\nHere, the Agreements indicate that if a shareholder-physician was to compete in\r\nviolation of Article 4, Article 4 would simultaneously divest the shareholder-\r\nphysician's rights to earned but unpaid salary, the defined share of accounts\r\nreceivable, and the $60,000 severance pay. The defined share of accounts\r\nreceivable is a formula that estimates the accounts receivable attributable to the\r\nphysician until the physician left during the current year. Reviewed in that light,\r\nits forfeiture may conservatively estimate probable damage caused by a departed\r\nshareholder-physician's competition with Columbia Heart for a period equal to the\r\namount of time the physician worked for the practice in the year he left. See ERIE\r\nIns. Co., 393 S.C. at 461, 464, 713 S.E.2d at 321, 322 (holding the language of a\r\ncontract that imposed a 15% fee to cover the burden of overseeing completion of a\r\nproject after the project's breach was reasonably intended as a predetermined\r\nmeasure of loss from breach because it varied the recoverable damages based upon\r\nthe outstanding work). In contrast, the amounts reflecting earned but unpaid salary\r\nand $60,000 severance pay are not on their face related to Columbia Heart's\r\nprobable loss suffered by a shareholder-physician's departure and competition. But\r\nthe damages to be expected by competition are highly difficult to predict, and the\r\nAgreements involved large sums of money, sophisticated shareholder-physicians,\r\nand arm's length negotiation. Article 4 itself says the forfeiture was \"reasonable\"\r\nand \"intended as partial restitution\" for Columbia Heart's damages caused by\r\ncompetition. The money actually forfeited by each Respondent pursuant to Article\r\n4 totaled near $240,000,13 and the difference between the stipulated damages in\r\nArticle 5 and the revenue loss Columbia Heart could expect in one year if a\r\nshareholder-physician took patients away from the practice equaled about \"six\r\n\r\n13Each Respondent's defined share of accounts receivable equaled around\r\n$172,000, and each Respondent sought the $60,000 severance pay and about\r\n$8,000 in earned but unpaid salary.\r\n\nfigures,\" or $100,000.14 Although Article 4's forfeiture would as a result divest\r\neach Respondent of items worth $140,000 more than the estimate of the net\r\nrevenue each shareholder-physician might earn for the practice in serving its\r\npatients, Columbia Heart's loss of patients was not the only foreseeable loss\r\nresulting from departure and competition by shareholder-physicians. Probable\r\ndamages to Columbia Heart could include other losses resulting from the closing\r\nof an office, and no evidence allows us to conclude the $140,000 difference is an\r\nunreasonable estimate of those uncertain losses. See Restatement (Second) of\r\nContracts § 356 cmt. b (\"To the extent that there is uncertainty as to the harm, the\r\nestimate of the court or jury may not accord with the principle of compensation\r\nany more than does the advance estimate of the parties.\"), cited by ERIE Ins. Co.,\r\n393 S.C. at 462, 713 S.E.2d at 322. Considering the Agreements as a whole and\r\nthe circumstances surrounding their entry—especially the millions of dollars\r\nColumbia Heart incurred in opening the new practice—the forfeiture in Article 4\r\ncould reasonably be intended to compensate Columbia Heart for part of the\r\nprobable damages resulting from the shareholder-physician's departure and\r\ncompetition in contravention of Article 4. See id. § 356 cmt. b (\"The amount fixed\r\nis reasonable to the extent that it approximates the actual loss that has resulted\r\nfrom the particular breach, even though it may not approximate the loss that might\r\nhave been anticipated under other possible breaches. Furthermore, the amount\r\nfixed is reasonable to the extent that it approximates the loss anticipated at the time\r\nof the making of the contract, even though it may not approximate the actual loss.\r\nThe second factor is the difficulty of proof of loss. The greater the difficulty either\r\nof proving that loss has occurred or of establishing its amount with the requisite\r\ncertainty, the easier it is to show that the amount fixed is reasonable.\" (citations\r\nomitted)). Consequently, the forfeiture in Article 4 is enforceable.\r\n\r\nII.   Wage Payment Action\r\n\r\nColumbia Heart contends the trial court erred in awarding Respondents the unpaid\r\ncompensation they sought under the Wage Payment Act. We agree.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Respondents sought payment from Columbia Heart under the Wage\r\nPayment Act for compensation left unpaid after they departed from the practice.\r\nBoth doctors sought amounts owed for their defined share of accounts receivable\r\nand earned but unpaid salary. Dr. Feldman sought payment for unpaid director's\r\n\r\n\r\n14We consider Article 5's stipulated damages provision along with Article 4's\r\nforfeiture because Respondents breached the non-competition provisions of both.\r\n\nfees, but Dr. Baugh did not. Respondents did not seek payment for the $60,000\r\nseverance pay.\r\n\r\nThe parties agreed that Respondents had competed in contravention of the\r\nAgreements, but the trial court held the non-competition provisions were\r\nunenforceable. Thus, the court found Respondents had not lost their rights to the\r\nabove compensation by competing with Columbia Heart, and it awarded\r\nRespondents compensation for their wage payment claims. The court declined to\r\ngrant treble damages or attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nActions seeking damages for a violation of the Wage Payment Act are actions at\r\nlaw. Mathis v. Brown & Brown of S.C., Inc., 389 S.C. 299, 307, 698 S.E.2d 773,\r\n777 (2010). In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial court's findings are\r\nconclusive on appeal when supported by competent evidence. Id. Accordingly,\r\nour standard of review is limited to correcting errors of law and determining\r\nwhether the trial court's findings are supported by competent evidence. Id.\r\n\r\nUnder the Wage Payment Act, Respondents are entitled to recover in a civil action\r\n\"all wages due\" but unpaid by Columbia Heart when Respondents left the practice.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 41-10-50 (Supp. 2012); S.C. Code Ann. § 41-10-80(C) (Supp.\r\n2012). The Act provides the trial court the discretion to award treble damages,\r\nattorney's fees, and costs as well. Mathis, 389 S.C. at 315, 698 S.E.2d at 781.\r\n\r\nUnder the Act, \"wages\" are defined as the following:\r\n\r\n             [A]ll amounts at which labor rendered is recompensed,\r\n             whether the amount is fixed or ascertained on a time,\r\n             task, piece, or commission basis, or other method of\r\n             calculating the amount and includes vacation, holiday,\r\n             and sick leave payments which are due to an employee\r\n             under any employer policy or employment contract.\r\n             Funds placed in pension plans or profit sharing plans are\r\n             not wages subject to this chapter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 41-10-10(2) (Supp. 2012). In other words, the Act \"defines\r\n'wages' as 'all amounts . . . which are due to an employee under any . . .\r\nemployment contract.'\" Dumas v. InfoSafe Corp., 320 S.C. 188, 195 n.4, 463\r\nS.E.2d 641, 645 n.4 (Ct. App. 1995) (quoting § 41-10-10(2)).\r\n\nHere, because the forfeiture in Article 4 is enforceable and Respondents have\r\nforfeited their rights to compensation under that article, no evidence indicates the\r\ndefined shares of accounts receivable, unpaid draws, and director's fees are \"due\"\r\nto them under the Agreements. Accordingly, the items are not \"wages\" and the\r\ntrial court erred in holding Respondents were entitled to them pursuant to their\r\nwage payment claims.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe reverse the trial court's finding that the non-competition provisions in Article 5\r\nand Article 4 are unenforceable. We also reverse the trial court's finding that\r\nRespondents were entitled to damages for unpaid director's fees, draws, and the\r\ndefined share of accounts receivable under the Wage Payment Act.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nHUFF and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5016","title":"SCPIF v.

The County seeks review of the trial court's order granting\r\nsummary judgment to Respondents, arguing that the account in question is lawful\r\nand Respondents' current action is barred by res judicata. The County also seeks\r\nreview of a second order granting Respondents' request for attorney's fees and\r\ncosts. We reverse.    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nFor its 1994-95 fiscal year, the County established an account in its annual\r\noperating budget entitled \"County Council Reserves.\" Funds in this account were\r\nset aside to enable Council to address \"special community needs not normally\r\nfalling with [sic] the operational purview of County government\" and to \"provide\r\nfor nonrecurring community requests.\" In 1996, Council adopted a resolution\r\nlimiting the use of the Council Reserves account to \"infrastructure purposes such\r\nas flooding and drainage, roads, lights, sewer, and public buildings and grounds.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1996, Edward D. Sloan, Jr. (Sloan), filed an action against the County\r\nchallenging the legality of the Council Reserves account, beginning with fiscal\r\nyear 1994-95. Sloan's Third Amended Complaint listed donations from the County\r\nto several private organizations and political subdivisions spanning \"from 1994\r\nthrough September, 1997.\" The complaint, which set forth eleven causes of action,\r\ntook issue with the use of Council Reserves for non-county matters. The\r\ncomplaint also cited perceived procedural irregularities in the continued use of\r\nCouncil Reserves without Council voting on each expenditure or appropriation. In\r\nthe complaint's \"Sixth Cause of Action,\" Sloan alleged that the creation and use of\r\nthe Council Reserves account violated section 7-81 of the Greenville County Code.\r\n\r\nIn the complaint, Sloan sought a declaration that establishing the Council Reserves\r\naccount and disbursing public funds as described in the complaint violated \"the\r\napplicable statutes, Constitutions, ordinances, and policies.\" Sloan also sought\r\npreliminary and permanent injunctions against the County's \"appropriation,\r\nexpenditure, disbursement, and donation of public funds from the 1996-97 'Council\r\nReserves' in violation of the S.C. Constitution and Code and the Greenville County\r\nCodes [sic] regarding procedures for appropriation and expenditures.\"\r\n\nSloan subsequently filed a motion for summary judgment. In his supporting\r\nmemorandum, Sloan explained his allegation that the Council Reserves account\r\nviolated section 7-81 of the County of Greenville, South Carolina Code of\r\nOrdinances (Greenville County Code) as follows:\r\n\r\n             [Section 7-81(b) requires that] all \"requests for county\r\n             funds will be submitted to council for review during the\r\n             regular county budget process . . . .\" Rather than the\r\n             entire council reviewing \"requests for county funds\" that\r\n             are \"submitted for council review during the regular\r\n             county budget process,\" individual council members\r\n             receive requests throughout the year and respond to them\r\n             by submitting individual requisitions to the clerk of\r\n             county council . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). The summary judgment motion and supporting memorandum\r\nrequested, among other relief, an order enjoining Council's appropriations of public\r\nfunds to entities when: (1) the appropriations were not made by County Council as\r\na whole, but rather by individuals in violation of section 7-81(a) of the Greenville\r\nCounty Code, and (2) the requests were not submitted to Council during the\r\nregular county budget process, in violation of section 7-81(b) of the Greenville\r\nCounty Code. On February 10, 1998, the circuit court conducted a bench trial on\r\nstipulated facts. The circuit court subsequently issued an order ruling that the\r\nCounty was entitled to judgment in its favor, with one exception not relevant to\r\nthis case.1 The circuit court concluded that Council had complied with section 7-\r\n81. The circuit court stated that there was nothing in the record to support a\r\nfinding that the County's actions rose \"to the level of illegality in violation of the\r\nCounty Code.\" Sloan did not appeal this order.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, on August 2, 2005, the County passed an ordinance adopting its\r\nbudget for the 2006-07 fiscal year. Included in the operating expenses for the\r\nCounty Council Division of the Legislative and Administrative Services\r\nDepartment were line items for the Council Reserves, which included a separate\r\nline item for each Council member. Each individual Council member's routine\r\nexpenses were funded from these line items. The line items were also available to\r\nfund costs \"associated with special, non-recurring community requests for\r\n\r\n1The circuit court addressed in a separate order a proposed disbursement to the\r\nCrestwood Forest Village Committee. The court found that this proposed\r\ndisbursement was in violation of Council's guidelines for use of Council Reserves.\r\n\ninfrastructure purposes\" and for \"contributions to local governments in Greenville\r\nCounty for community projects.\" More specifically, each Council member's\r\nexpenses and costs, designated as \"Council District Expense,\" were described by\r\nthe County as follows:\r\n\r\n            Funds for a Council Member to address:\r\n\r\n            ●Cost of general business supplies such as pens, paper,\r\n            stationary, . . . ;\r\n            ●Cost of special documents, incentives and awards given\r\n            either to the public or county employees . . . ;\r\n            ●Cost of periodicals, professional journals, and reference\r\n            books;\r\n            ●Cost of per diem and mileage involved in the conduct\r\n            of county business;\r\n            ●Costs associated with community functions,\r\n            conferences and training seminars . . . ;\r\n            ●Costs associated with special, non recurring [sic]\r\n            community requests for infrastructure purposes such as:\r\n                   ●Flooding\r\n                   ●Roads\r\n                   ●Lights\r\n                   ●Sewer and drainage\r\n                   ●Public buildings and grounds\r\n                   ●Infrastructure related studies\r\n            ●Contributions to local governments in Greenville\r\n            County for community projects; . . . .\r\n\r\nIn 2006, Sloan, along with SCPIF, the foundation he chaired, filed the present\r\naction, challenging the Council Reserves account, a/k/a the \"Council District\r\nExpense\" account, within the County's 2006-07 budget.2 In their complaint,\r\nRespondents specifically challenged \"[c]osts associated with special, nonrecurring\r\ncommunity requests for infrastructure purposes[.]\" The complaint's sole cause of\r\n\r\n2 The complaint indicates that this account has been \"variously known as the\r\nCouncil District Expense Fund, Council Reserves, Discretionary Funds, or the\r\nSlush Fund.\" Likewise, in its appellate brief, the County indicates that several\r\nyears after creating the Council Reserves account, it began using the name\r\n\"Council District Expense\" for the account. For the remainder of this opinion, we\r\nrefer to the account as \"Council Reserves.\"\r\n\naction states, \"Council's delegation of legislative power to an individual member . .\r\n. is unconstitutional and illegal, as explained in a South Carolina Attorney General\r\nopinion dated November 13, 2003[.]\"3\r\n\r\nIn their complaint, Respondents also sought injunctive relief as well as a\r\ndeclaration that Council's \"delegation of [its] discretionary spending authority\" was\r\n\"illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional.\" The County submitted a motion to dismiss,\r\nand the parties submitted cross-motions for summary judgment. In its motion to\r\ndismiss, the County asserted that the present action was barred by res judicata and\r\ncollateral estoppel. However, at the motions hearing, the County expressly waived\r\nits collateral estoppel defense.\r\n\r\nRelying on Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen, 333 U.S. 591 (1948), the\r\ncircuit court concluded that the action was not barred by res judicata by reasoning\r\nthat the County's different fiscal years were comparable to the different tax years at\r\nissue in Sunnen. The circuit court also ruled that the creation of the Council\r\nReserves account constituted an illegal delegation of legislative authority by\r\nCouncil to its individual members. However, the court declined to base its ruling\r\non constitutional grounds, stating: \"Plaintiffs have alleged a Constitutional basis\r\nfor the legal proposition that County Council may not delegate legislative\r\nauthority. However, Defendants' concession that County Council may not delegate\r\nlegislative authority makes it unnecessary to decide whether this prohibition is\r\nbased on the Constitution or not.\"\r\n\r\nIn a separate hearing, the circuit court received evidence on Respondents'\r\nattorney's fees, pursuant to section 15-77-300 of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n2011).4 The court subsequently issued an order granting Respondents' request for\r\n$60,084.15 in fees and costs incurred through January 31, 2010. The court also\r\nallowed Respondents to \"file an affidavit addressing fees incurred after January 31,\r\n2010.\" This appeal followed.5 ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\n3 Attorney General opinions are persuasive but not binding authority. Charleston\r\nCnty. Sch. Dist. v. Harrell, 393 S.C. 552, 560-61, 713 S.E.2d 604, 609 (2011).\r\n4 In a case brought by a party contesting \"state action,\" section 15-77-300\r\nauthorizes an award of attorney's fees to the prevailing party, other than the State\r\nor a political subdivision of the State, under certain circumstances.\r\n5 The County timely filed a Notice of Appeal following each of the two orders\r\nissued by the circuit court; the appeals were consolidated.\r\n\n1. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the present action was not barred by\r\nres judicata?\r\n\r\n2. Did the circuit court err in concluding that the creation of the Council Reserves\r\naccount unlawfully delegated legislative authority to Council members in their\r\nindividual capacities?\r\n\r\n3. Did the circuit court err in awarding attorney's fees and costs to Respondents?\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nSummary Judgment\r\n\r\nThis court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same\r\nstandard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Jackson v.\r\nBermuda Sands, Inc., 383 S.C. 11, 14 n.2, 677 S.E.2d 612, 614 n.2 (Ct. App.\r\n2009). Rule 56(c), SCRCP, provides that summary judgment shall be granted\r\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" \"The purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases\r\nnot requiring the services of a fact finder.\" Matsell v. Crowfield Plantation Cmty.\r\nServs. Ass'n, Inc., 393 S.C. 65, 70, 710 S.E.2d 90, 93 (Ct. App. 2011) (citing\r\nGeorge v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001)).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the circuit court noted in its order: \"The parties agree that the\r\ncase presents questions of law to be decided on undisputed facts.\" Neither party\r\nchallenges this statement on appeal. Therefore, this court need not determine\r\nwhether there are genuine issues of fact. The court need only concern itself with\r\nthe resolution of questions of law.\r\n\r\nAttorney's Fees\r\n\r\nIn a case brought by a party who is contesting state action, a court may award\r\nattorney's fees to the prevailing party, unless the prevailing party is the State or any\r\npolitical subdivision of the State, if (1) the court finds that the agency acted\r\nwithout substantial justification in \"pressing its claim against the party[;]\" and (2)\r\nthe court finds that there are no special circumstances that would make the award\r\nof attorney's fees unjust. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-77-300 (Supp. 2011). An appellate\r\n\ncourt may not disturb such an award unless the appellant shows that the trial court\r\nabused its discretion in considering the applicable factors. Heath v. Cnty. of Aiken,\r\n302 S.C. 178, 182, 394 S.E.2d 709, 711 (1990).\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. Res Judicata\r\n\r\nThe County maintains the circuit court erred in concluding that the present action\r\nwas not barred by res judicata. We agree.\r\n\r\n   A. South Carolina Law\r\n\r\n\"Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties when the claims arise out\r\nof the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between\r\nthose parties.\" Judy v. Judy, 393 S.C. 160, 172, 712 S.E.2d 408, 414 (2011)\r\n(citation omitted). \"Under the doctrine of res judicata, a litigant is barred from\r\nraising any issues which were adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which\r\nmight have been raised in the former suit.\" Id. (citation and quotation marks\r\nomitted).\r\n\r\n\"Res judicata bars relitigation of the same cause of action while collateral estoppel\r\nbars relitigation of the same facts or issues necessarily determined in the former\r\nproceeding.\" Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 436, 480 S.E.2d 455, 460 (Ct. App.\r\n1997). In Beall v. Doe, this court distinguished the two concepts as follows:\r\n\r\n             The doctrines of res judicata and collateral estoppel are,\r\n             of course, two different concepts. A final judgment on\r\n             the merits in a prior action will conclude the parties and\r\n             their privies under the doctrine of res judicata in a second\r\n             action based on the same claim as to issues actually\r\n             litigated and as to issues which might have been litigated\r\n             in the first action. Under the doctrine of collateral\r\n             estoppel, on the other hand, the second action is based\r\n             upon a different claim and the judgment in the first action\r\n             precludes relitigation of only those issues actually and\r\n             necessarily litigated and determined in the first suit.\r\n\r\n281 S.C. 363, 369 n.1, 315 S.E.2d 186, 190 n.1 (Ct. App. 1984) (citations and\r\nquotation marks omitted).\r\n\n\"Res judicata's fundamental purpose is to ensure that no one should be twice sued\r\nfor the same cause of action.\" Yelsen Land Co. v. State, 397 S.C. 15, 22, 723\r\nS.E.2d 592, 596 (2012) (citation and quotation marks omitted). \"The doctrine [of\r\nres judicata] flows from the principle that public interest requires an end to\r\nlitigation and no one should be sued twice for the same cause of action.\" Duckett\r\nv. Goforth, 374 S.C. 446, 464, 649 S.E.2d 72, 81 (Ct. App. 2007) (emphasis added)\r\n(citation omitted); see also S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 248,\r\n551 S.E.2d 274, 278 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"'The doctrine of res adjudicata (or res\r\njudicata) in the strict sense of that time-honored Latin phrase had its origin in the\r\nprinciple that it is in the public interest that there should be an end of litigation and\r\nthat no one should be twice sued for the same cause of action.'\" (quoting First Nat'l\r\nBank of Greenville v. U.S. Fid. & Guar. Co., 207 S.C. 15, 24, 35 S.E.2d 47, 56\r\n(1945))).\r\n\r\n\"The doctrine of collateral estoppel, or issue preclusion, on the other hand, rests\r\ngenerally on equitable principles.\" Town of Sullivan's Island v. Felger, 318 S.C.\r\n340, 344, 457 S.E.2d 626, 628 (Ct. App. 1995) (citing Watson v. Goldsmith, 205\r\nS.C. 215, 31 S.E.2d 317 (1944)). In Watson, our supreme court contrasted the\r\norigin of the doctrine of collateral estoppel with the origin of res judicata:\r\n\r\n             Estoppel rests generally on equitable principles, which\r\n             res judicata does not, but upon the two maxims which\r\n             were its foundation in the Roman law, nemo debet bis\r\n             vexari pro eadem causa (no one ought to be twice sued\r\n             for the same cause of action) and interest reipublicae ut\r\n             sit finis litium (it is the interest of the state that there\r\n             should be an end of litigation[])[.] . . . Res judicata is\r\n             rather a principle of public policy than the result of\r\n             equitable considerations, which [the] latter estoppel is.\r\n\r\n205 S.C. at 221-22, 31 S.E.2d at 319-20 (citations omitted) (emphasis added); see\r\nalso First Nat'l Bank of Greenville, 207 S.C. at 24, 35 S.E.2d at 56-57 (citing\r\nWatson) (contrasting the origins of res judicata and collateral estoppel).\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the parties do not dispute that the 1996 action involved the\r\nsame parties or their privies—Sloan brought the 1996 action; and, along with\r\n\nSCPIF, the foundation he chaired, he brought the present action.6 See Yelsen, 397\r\nS.C. at 22, 723 S.E.2d at 596 (holding that the concept of privity rests on each\r\nparty's relationship to the subject matter of the litigation); Richburg v. Baughman,\r\n290 S.C. 431, 434, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986) (\"The term 'privy', when applied to\r\na judgment or decree, means one so identified in interest with another that he\r\nrepresents the same legal right. One in privity is one whose legal interests were\r\nlitigated in the former proceeding.\").\r\n\r\nHowever, Respondents maintain that in the 1996 action, the circuit court neither\r\nruled on nor could have ruled on the County's 2006 and 2007 appropriations and\r\nexpenditures. Respondents argue that res judicata does not bar their challenge to\r\nthese specific appropriations because \"the allegations arise from different fiscal\r\nyears.\" We find this argument unavailing. In the present action, Respondents'\r\ncomplaint challenges the legality of the practice underlying these expenditures,\r\ni.e., use of the Council Reserves account as a delegation of legislative authority to\r\nindividual Council members, a practice continuing from year to year since the\r\n1994-95 fiscal year. Likewise, the Third Amended Complaint in the 1996 action\r\nchallenged this same practice with regard to multiple fiscal years.\r\n\r\nIn determining whether allegations arising from different fiscal years must be\r\nbrought in the same action, the Restatement (Second) of Judgments is instructive:\r\n\r\n             (1) When a valid and final judgment rendered in an\r\n             action extinguishes the plaintiff's claim pursuant to the\r\n             rules of merger or bar . . . the claim extinguished includes\r\n             all rights of the plaintiff to remedies against the\r\n             defendant with respect to all or any part of the\r\n             transaction, or series of connected transactions, out of\r\n             which the action arose.\r\n             (2) What factual grouping constitutes a \"transaction\",\r\n             and what groupings constitute a \"series\", are to be\r\n             determined pragmatically, giving weight to such\r\n             considerations as whether the facts are related in time,\r\n             space, origin, or motivation, whether they form a\r\n             convenient trial unit, and whether their treatment as a\r\n\r\n\r\n6In his affidavit dated February 19th, 2007, Sloan stated that he was the Chairman\r\nof the Board of Directors and President of SCPIF.\r\n\n             unit conforms to the parties' expectations or business\r\n             understanding or usage.\r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 24 (1982 & Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).\r\nThe plaintiff's claim is extinguished even when the plaintiff is \"prepared in the\r\nsecond action (1) [t]o present evidence or grounds or theories of the case not\r\npresented in the first action, or (2) [t]o seek remedies or forms of relief not\r\ndemanded in the first action.\" Id. at § 25 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHere, the \"Sixth Cause of Action\" in Sloan's 1996 complaint effectively challenged\r\nthe creation and use of the Council Reserves account as an illegal delegation of\r\nlegislative authority in violation of section 7-81 of the Greenville County Code.\r\nSee Greenville County Code § 7-81 (requiring the appropriation of public funds to\r\nbe made only by Council as a body); Gregory v. Rollins, 230 S.C. 269, 274, 95\r\nS.E.2d 487, 490 (1956) (\"It is fundamental that the appropriation of public funds is\r\na legislative function.\"). The circuit court, in the 1996 action, concluded that\r\nCouncil had complied with section 7-81. The circuit court stated that there was\r\nnothing in the record to support a finding that the County's actions rose \"to the\r\nlevel of illegality in violation of the County Code.\" Sloan did not appeal the circuit\r\ncourt's ruling. In the present action, Respondents base their claim challenging the\r\ncreation and use of the Council Reserves account on the ground that the Council's\r\ndelegation of legislative power to its individual members is \"unconstitutional.\"7\r\n\r\nEven if a constitutional challenge to the Council's delegation of authority to\r\nindividual members through the Council Reserves account was neither raised nor\r\nruled on in the 1996 action, the theory could have been brought in the prior action.\r\nHence, both the cause of action and this theory of relief are barred in the present\r\naction. See Restatement (Second) of Judgments §§ 24, 25 (1982 & Supp. 2012)\r\n(applying claim preclusion \"with respect to all or any part of the transaction, or\r\nseries of connected transactions, out of which the [first] action arose\" even when\r\nthe plaintiff is prepared to present a theory in the second action not presented in the\r\nfirst action).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n7 Neither Respondents' pleadings nor their appellate brief cite any specific\r\nconstitutional provision supporting the general assertion that the use of the Council\r\nReserves account is unconstitutional. Further, at oral argument, counsel did not\r\narticulate any specific constitutional provision on which Respondents may rely for\r\ntheir assertion.\r\n\nIn Judy, our supreme court addressed the question of whether a claim should have\r\nbeen raised in a prior action and stated:\r\n\r\n             Res judicata bars subsequent actions by the same parties\r\n             when the claims arise out of the same transaction or\r\n             occurrence that was the subject of a prior action between\r\n             those parties. Under the doctrine of res judicata, \"[a]\r\n             litigant is barred from raising any issues which were\r\n             adjudicated in the former suit and any issues which might\r\n             have been raised in the former suit.\"\r\n\r\n393 S.C. at 172, 712 S.E.2d at 414 (quoting Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of\r\nConway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999)) (emphasis added). The\r\ncourt also explained the term \"cause of action\" for res judicata purposes: \"[F]or\r\npurposes of res judicata, \"cause of action\" is not the form of action in which a\r\nclaim is asserted but, rather the cause for action, meaning the underlying facts\r\ncombined with the law giving the party a right to a remedy of one form or another\r\nbased thereon.\" Id. (emphasis added) (citations and quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nHere, Respondents' claim, which challenges the County's use of the Council\r\nReserves account to delegate spending authority to its individual members,\r\nconstitutes the \"same transaction or occurrence\" that was the subject of the prior\r\ncase. Although the budget years and dollar amounts differ, the \"cause for action,\"\r\nas defined in Judy, is the same in both the 1996 action and the present action.\r\n\r\nOur supreme court's recent discussion of res judicata in Judy acknowledged that\r\nthere are certain circumstances in which the policy underlying the doctrine of res\r\njudicata is outweighed by a more compelling policy; there, the court looked to the\r\nRestatement (Second) of Judgments § 26 for guidance on those circumstances in\r\nwhich courts should decline to apply res judicata. 393 S.C. at 168 n.5, 712 S.E.2d\r\nat 412 n.5 (quoting Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1)(a)-(c) (1982 &\r\nSupp. 2011)); see also Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1)(a)-(f) cmts. a-j\r\n(1982 & Supp. 2012) (discussing exceptions to the general rule against claim\r\nsplitting). Nonetheless, in Judy, the court did not find any of these exceptions\r\napplicable to the plaintiff's filing of a claim for waste in circuit court after having\r\nraised a waste claim in his probate court pleadings. 393 S.C. at 168-74, 712 S.E.2d\r\nat 412-15. Likewise, we find none of these exceptions applicable to Respondents'\r\npresent claim. The parties have not cited, nor have we found, any binding\r\nauthority applying any of these exceptions to a case with facts similar to the\r\npresent case.\r\n\nWhile the potential adverse impact on the public interest has been recognized as a\r\nreason to depart from the doctrine of collateral estoppel,8 the parties have not cited,\r\nnor have we found, any binding authority recognizing a comparable exception for\r\nres judicata.9 Rather, the doctrine of res judicata itself is a doctrine founded upon\r\nthe objective of preserving and protecting the public interest. See, e.g., Duckett,\r\n374 S.C. at 464, 649 S.E.2d at 81 (\"The doctrine [of res judicata] flows from the\r\nprinciple that public interest requires an end to litigation and no one should be sued\r\ntwice for the same cause of action.\").\r\n\r\nPrevious opinions of this court have addressed circumstances in which it was\r\ninappropriate to apply the doctrine of res judicata. In Mr. T v. Ms. T, the plaintiff\r\nfiled a paternity action naming his ex-wife as a defendant and alleging that she\r\ncommitted fraud in leading him to believe he was the biological father of her\r\nchildren. 378 S.C. 127, 130-32, 662 S.E.2d 413, 415-16 (Ct. App. 2008). The\r\nplaintiff also sought relief from the parties' prior decree of divorce, which had\r\nincorporated the parties' settlement agreement and had found that two children\r\nwere born of the marriage. Id. at 130-32, 662 S.E.2d at 414-16. The family court\r\nhad found that the plaintiff's paternity action was barred by \"res judicata/collateral\r\nestoppel.\" Id. at 131, 662 S.E.2d at 415. On appeal, the plaintiff argued that the\r\nfamily court erred in this regard. Id. at 132, 662 S.E.2d at 415-16. This court\r\nreversed the family court's dismissal of the case and remanded the case for further\r\ndevelopment of the record. Id. at 139, 662 S.E.2d at 419.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 See Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 28(5) (1982 & Supp. 2012)\r\n(referencing the \"public interest\" exception to collateral estoppel).\r\n9 We see no injustice in this dichotomy because the reach of issue preclusion is\r\nbroader than that of claim preclusion. Unlike claim preclusion, issue preclusion\r\ncan affect the outcome of a different, unrelated claim and can also affect a party in\r\na second action with an unrelated third party. See Restatement (Second) of\r\nJudgments § 27 (1982 & Supp. 2012) (\"When an issue of fact or law is actually\r\nlitigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination is\r\nessential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a subsequent action\r\nbetween the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\"); Restatement\r\n(Second) of Judgments § 29 (1982 & Supp. 2012) (\"A party precluded from\r\nrelitigating an issue with an opposing party, in accordance with §§ 27 and 28, is\r\nalso precluded from doing so with another person unless the fact that he lacked full\r\nand fair opportunity to litigate the issue in the first action or other circumstances\r\njustify affording him an opportunity to relitigate the issue.\").\r\n\nAlso, in Johns v. Johns, this court held a consent order's finding that the parties had\r\na common-law marriage should not be given res judicata effect because the\r\nmarriage was bigamous and South Carolina's policy of not recognizing bigamous\r\nmarriages had been expressed in a statute declaring them to be void. 309 S.C. 199,\r\n201-03, 420 S.E.2d 856, 858-59 (Ct. App. 1992). Likewise, in Jennings v.\r\nDargan, this court held that an order approving a settlement regarding paternity\r\nand child support was void and thus did not have a preclusive effect against the\r\nchild in her action for support. 308 S.C. 317, 320-21, 417 S.E.2d 646, 647-48 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1992). The court so ruled because the record did not indicate the family court\r\nhad complied with statutes requiring a finding that the settlement was in the best\r\ninterest of the minor and requiring review and approval of the settlement. Id. The\r\ncourt acknowledged the policy respecting finality of judgments but stated that the\r\npolicy expressed in the cited statutes (protecting minors) was the overriding\r\nconcern. Id.\r\n\r\nWe find these opinions to be consistent with the requirement that a judgment must\r\nbe \"valid\" in order to preclude a second action concerning the same transaction,\r\nand this validity requirement is already built into the doctrine of res judicata. See\r\nBasnight, 346 S.C. at 248-49, 551 S.E.2d at 278 (citing Griggs v. Griggs, 214 S.C.\r\n177, 184, 51 S.E.2d 622, 626 (1949)) (\"Under the doctrine of res judicata, a final\r\njudgment on the merits rendered by a court of competent jurisdiction, without\r\nfraud or collusion, is conclusive as to the rights of the parties and their privies.\"\r\n(emphasis added)); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 24(1) (1982 & Supp.\r\n2012) (conditioning the extinguishment of the second claim on the validity and\r\nfinality of the prior judgment); Restatement (Second) of Judgments § 26(1) cmt. j\r\n(1982 & Supp. 2012) (discussing the defendant's fraud, misrepresentation, or\r\nmistake as a factor contributing to the prior judgment). In each of these cases,\r\nthere existed a specific, compelling concern as to the validity of the prior\r\njudgment. No such concern has been presented in the present case.\r\n\r\n   B. The Sunnen Decision\r\n\r\nIn concluding that the present action was not barred by res judicata, the circuit\r\ncourt relied primarily on the reasoning of Commissioner of Internal Revenue v.\r\nSunnen, 333 U.S. 591 (1948). The circuit court stated:\r\n\r\n             Because the 'Council District Expense Fund' appears in\r\n             each annual budget for Greenville County, the enactment\r\n             of each budget creates separate legal claims. As the\r\n             United States Supreme Court has explained in the context\r\n\n            of federal income taxes levied on an annual basis, '[e]ach\r\n            year is the origin of a new liability and a separate cause\r\n            of action.' Commissioner of Internal Revenue v. Sunnen,\r\n            333 U.S. 591, 598 (1948). The same reasoning applies\r\n            here. The fact that Mr. Sloan might have, or even did,\r\n            challenge the legality of an identical line item in a\r\n            previous budget does not bar Plaintiffs from the causes of\r\n            action brought in this case.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court's reliance on the tax-year analysis in Sunnen was misplaced;\r\nSunnen's explanation of res judicata in the context of differing tax years is not\r\nbinding outside of the tax context. See United States v. Stauffer Chemical Co., 464\r\nU.S. 165, 172 n.5 (1984) (rejecting the general applicability of Sunnen's collateral\r\nestoppel analysis outside of the tax context); see also Peugeot Motors of Am., Inc.\r\nv. E. Auto Distribs., Inc., 892 F.2d 355, 359 (4th Cir. 1989) (\"We do not believe\r\nthat the mere fact that Peugeot's questioned policies continued after the 1981\r\nlitigation allows Eastern to make the same legal claim about the same policies that\r\nwere litigated and on account of which relief was denied in prior litigation.\").\r\nCompare Grp. Health Inc. v. United States, 662 F. Supp. 753, 764 (S.D.N.Y. 1987)\r\n(holding the plaintiff's claim that a Medicare regulation was unconstitutional did\r\nnot depend \"on the specific cost year involved\") and Carroll Twp. Auth. v. Mun.\r\nAuth. of City of Monongahela, 518 A.2d 337, 341 (Pa. Commw. Ct. 1986) (holding\r\nthat a township authority's 1985 complaint against a city's municipal authority\r\nchallenging the inclusion of legal fees as an operating expense in utility rates\r\npresented a claim that was identical to the claim in the township authority's 1983\r\ncomplaint because it did not appear that the 1985 complaint challenged \"the actual\r\namount paid or to be paid by [the city] for legal services as being excessive\" and\r\nthe ultimate issue in both actions appeared to be \"one and the same, to wit, whether\r\nany legal fees incurred by [the city] in defending its rate charges may be passed on\r\nto [the township authority] through their inclusion in operating expenses\") with\r\nM.C.G. v. Hillsborough Cnty. Sch. Bd., 927 So. 2d 224, 227 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App.\r\n2006) (\"A cause of action to establish entitlement to services under the IDEA by its\r\nnature pertains to a particular period of time and is based on the factual\r\ncircumstances at that time.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nLike the claims challenging a regulation in Group Health, the claim in the present\r\ncase does not depend on any specific budget year; the complaint states \"for several\r\nyears Defendants have authorized and operated a fund variously known as the\r\n\nCouncil District Expense Fund, Council Reserves, Discretionary Funds, or the\r\nSlush Fund.\" (emphasis added). The complaint further states \"County Council's\r\ndelegation of legislative power to an individual member, as described herein, is\r\nunconstitutional and illegal, as explained in a South Carolina Attorney General\r\nopinion dated November 13, 2003 . . . .\" The complaint's prayer seeks injunctive\r\nrelief as well as an order \"Declaring that the delegation of the discretionary\r\nspending authority is illegal, invalid, and unconstitutional[.]\"\r\n\r\nFurther, as in Carroll Township Authority, the complaint in the present case does\r\nnot challenge specific dollar amounts as excessive. Hence, no specific budget or\r\nmonetary amount constituted the \"res\" in the 1996 action or the present action.\r\nRather, the complaint challenges the practice underlying the Council Reserves\r\naccount, i.e., the delegation of authority to individual council members. Moreover,\r\nunlike the relief sought in M.C.G., i.e., the provision of educational services by a\r\nlocal school board, the relief sought in the present case does not depend on any one\r\ntime period; rather, the complaint challenges the creation and continued use of the\r\nCouncil Reserves account as an illegal delegation of legislative authority.\r\n\r\nIn sum, Sunnen does not alter our application of South Carolina preclusion\r\nprinciples to the present action. Therefore, the circuit court erred in holding that\r\nthe present action was not barred by res judicata.\r\n\r\nII. Attorney's Fees\r\n\r\nThe County asserts that the trial court abused its discretion in awarding attorney's\r\nfees to Respondents. We agree. In a case brought by a party who is contesting\r\nstate action, a court may award attorney's fees to the prevailing party under certain\r\ncircumstances. S.C. Code Ann. § 15-77-300 (Supp. 2011). Because the present\r\naction is barred by res judicata, Respondents do not qualify as prevailing parties.\r\nTherefore, we reverse the award of attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the orders granting summary judgment and attorney's fees\r\nand costs to Respondents.\r\n\nREVERSED.10\n\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10 Because this action is barred by res judicata, we decline to address the merits of\r\nthe present action.

The circuit court\r\ngranted partial summary judgment to Shenandoah, and thus narrowed the issue for\r\ntrial to whether Lorenzo intended to defraud the insurance company when he did\r\nnot disclose information related to his medical history on the insurance application.\r\nAt trial, the court granted Shenandoah's motion for a directed verdict. Lakeisha\r\nSmallwood appeals the directed verdict. We hold a jury could reasonably conclude\r\nthat Shenandoah failed to meet its burden of proving Lorenzo made the\r\n\nmisrepresentations with the requisite fraudulent intent. Therefore, the issue should\r\nhave been decided by a jury. We reverse and remand for trial.\r\n\r\n      I.     Facts\r\n\r\nLorenzo Smallwood joined the U.S. Marine Corps following the 9/11 terrorist\r\nattacks and served tours of duty in both Afghanistan and Iraq. He was honorably\r\ndischarged from the Marines in 2004. On October 2, 2006, Lorenzo visited the\r\nemergency department of William Jennings Bryan Dorn Veteran's Medical Center\r\nin Columbia. He complained to nurse Pamela O'Toole about not being able to\r\nsleep well in the two years since his return from his tours overseas and stated he\r\nbelieved he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). O'Toole noted on\r\nher medical assessment, \"[p]atient admits to drug and alcohol use.\" However,\r\nLorenzo's exact statement concerning his drug use is unclear from the record, and\r\nby the time of trial, O'Toole had no independent recollection of treating Lorenzo.\r\nO'Toole referred him to an urgent-care doctor to discuss his psychological\r\nsymptoms and also referred him for a psychological evaluation to be performed at\r\na later date.\r\n\r\nLater in the afternoon, Lorenzo saw Nirav Pathak, M.D., who recorded in his notes\r\nLorenzo \"cannot sleep well,\" \"feels depressed,\" and \"thinks that he suffers from\r\nPTSD since he came home 2 years ago from Iraq/Afghanistan.\" Dr. Pathak also\r\nnoted, \"alcoholic, 12 pack beer every day.\" In his assessment, Dr. Pathak wrote,\r\n\r\n             Substance Abuse (Alcohol) – current; \n\r\n             Cocaine Abuse – current. \n\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Pathak later testified, he explained that this assessment of Lorenzo \"was\r\nbased upon what [he] had talked to [Lorenzo] about.\" Though neither Dr. Pathak's\r\nnotes nor his testimony reveal exactly what Lorenzo told him, Dr. Pathak testified\r\nthat his notes showed Lorenzo expressed his understanding of the assessment.\r\nHowever, Dr. Pathak could not confirm, nor is it clear from the record, that\r\nLorenzo agreed because, by the time of trial, Dr. Pathak also had no independent\r\nrecollection of treating Lorenzo. Dr. Pathak referred Lorenzo for a mental health\r\nconsultation, which was scheduled for November 24, 2006, but Lorenzo did not\r\nshow up for the appointment.\r\n\r\nA year later, on November 19, 2007, Lakeisha Smallwood sought an insurance\r\npolicy through Shenandoah on the life of her husband Lorenzo. She initially\r\nconsulted Lorenzo's aunt, Gayle Smallwood, who sold insurance for Shenandoah.\r\n\nGayle asked her colleague, Laura Haynes, an independent insurance agent\r\nrepresenting Shenandoah, to write the policy. Haynes met Lorenzo and Lakeisha\r\nat their home to fill out the insurance application. While seated at the kitchen\r\ntable, Haynes asked Lorenzo the application questions and recorded his answers on\r\nthe application. Lakeisha and Gayle were present at the home when the\r\napplication was being filled out but were primarily in another room with Lorenzo's\r\nand Lakeisha's children. Haynes testified she told Lorenzo to answer the\r\napplication questions truthfully, and that both Lorenzo and Lakeisha had an\r\nopportunity to review the application before they signed it. The application\r\ncontained a number of questions regarding Lorenzo's medical history, particularly,\r\n\r\n             Within the last 10 years, have any persons proposed for\r\n             coverage been diagnosed or treated by a member of the\r\n             medical profession for . . . mental or nervous disorder,\r\n             alcohol or drug dependency?\r\n\r\n             Within the past 5 years, have any persons proposed for\r\n             coverage . . . [u]sed cocaine?\r\n\r\nLorenzo answered \"No\" to each of these questions. Shenandoah issued the policy.\r\n\r\nOn September 18, 2008, Lorenzo was shot to death. The shooter was found guilty\r\nof voluntary manslaughter and sentenced to eighteen years. Shenandoah denied\r\nLakeisha's claim on the policy on the ground that Lorenzo provided false\r\nstatements on the application regarding his medical history.\r\n\r\n      II.    Procedural History\r\n\r\nShenandoah brought an action against Lakeisha to void the life insurance policy.\r\nTo void a life insurance policy for misrepresentation on the application, an insurer\r\nmust prove five elements by clear and convincing evidence: (1) the applicant made\r\na false statement on the application; (2) the applicant knew the statement was false;\r\n(3) the applicant's misrepresentation was material to the risk undertaken by the\r\ninsurance company; (4) the insurer issued the policy in reliance on the\r\nmisrepresentation; and (5) the applicant made the misrepresentation with the intent\r\nto defraud the insurance company. Lanham v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C.,\r\nInc., 349 S.C. 356, 364, 563 S.E.2d 331, 334 (2002).\r\n\nShenandoah filed a motion for summary judgment, which was partially granted\r\nwhen the Honorable George C. James, Jr. ruled the first four elements were\r\nestablished as a matter of law. As to the fifth element, Judge James wrote:\r\n\r\n             While there is certainly a circumstantial inference that\r\n             [Lorenzo] made the misrepresentations with the intent to\r\n             defraud the plaintiff, the evidence presented to the court\r\n             is also susceptible of the inference (at least at this stage)\r\n             that he made the misrepresentations to hide his alcohol\r\n             and drug abuse and his mental health issues from his\r\n             wife. A jury should decide this issue, especially in light\r\n             of the plaintiff's heightened burden of proof.\r\n\r\nThe case was called to trial before the Honorable W. Jeffrey Young. Shenandoah\r\ntried the case on the basis that Lorenzo's answers to the questions regarding mental\r\nor nervous disorder, drug or alcohol dependency, and cocaine use were made with\r\nthe intent to defraud Shenandoah.1 The court granted Shenandoah's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict after the close of all evidence. Lakeisha filed a motion to alter or\r\namend the judgment, which the court denied, stating, \"This is another of those 'rare\r\ncases in which the undisputed facts can reasonably give rise to only one inference,\r\nnamely, that the policy was procured by fraud.'\" (quoting Johnson v. N.Y. Life Ins.\r\nCo., 165 S.C. 494, 501, 164 S.E. 175, 177 (1932)).\r\n\r\n      III.   Directed Verdict Standard\r\n\r\n\"When reviewing the trial court's ruling on a motion for a directed verdict . . . , this\r\nCourt must apply the same standard as the trial court . . . .\" RFT Mgmt. Co. v.\r\nTinsley & Adams L.L.P., 399 S.C. 322, 331, 732 S.E.2d 166, 171 (2012). Viewing\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the\r\nnonmoving party, \"[t]he trial court must deny a motion for a directed verdict . . . if\r\nthe evidence yields more than one reasonable inference.\" 399 S.C. at 331-32, 732\r\nS.E.2d at 171. On appeal from an order granting a motion for a directed verdict,\r\ntherefore, the appellate court must determine whether it would have been\r\nreasonably possible for the jury to return a verdict for the party opposing the\r\nmotion. Erickson v. Jones St. Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 463, 629 S.E.2d\r\n653, 663 (2006). \"If the evidence is susceptible to more than one reasonable\r\n\r\n1 Lorenzo made other false statements on the application. However, Shenandoah\r\ndid not present evidence of those misrepresentations in its motion for summary\r\njudgment or at trial.\r\n\ninference, the case should be submitted to the jury.\" Id. Ordinarily, an applicant's\r\nintent to defraud an insurance company is a question for the jury to decide.\r\nWinburn v. Minn. Mut. Life Ins. Co., 261 S.C. 568, 578, 201 S.E.2d 372, 376\r\n(1973); Johnson, 165 S.C. at 501, 164 S.E. at 177.\r\n\r\n      IV.    Directed Verdict Analysis\r\n\r\nWe begin our analysis of the facts by acknowledging that there is not much\r\nevidence in the record of Lorenzo's intent, as is to be expected in cases where the\r\napplicant is deceased. The intent with which misrepresentations are made on a life\r\ninsurance application is usually shown by circumstantial evidence, since the direct\r\nevidence is \"locked up in the heart and consciousness of the applicant.\" Smiley v.\r\nWoodmen of the World Life Ins. Soc., 249 S.C. 461, 465, 154 S.E.2d 834, 836\r\n(1967) (quoting Johnson, 165 S.C. at 500, 164 S.E. at 177). The lack of evidence\r\nof intent works against the party who bears the burden of proof.\r\n\r\nShenandoah presented evidence from which a jury could reasonably conclude,\r\nbased on the clear and convincing evidence standard, that Lorenzo made the\r\nmisrepresentations with the intent to defraud the insurance company. However,\r\nthe question we must answer is whether there is evidence in this record from which\r\na jury could reasonably reach the opposite conclusion—that Shenandoah failed to\r\nprove by clear and convincing evidence that Lorenzo intended to defraud the\r\ninsurance company. We find there is.\r\n\r\nThere are several plausible explanations for Lorenzo's failure to disclose the\r\nrequested information. For example, a jury could reasonably conclude he was\r\nattempting to hide this information from his wife, who did not know he had used\r\ndrugs. Haynes testified that if Lorenzo had disclosed his drug use, Lakeisha would\r\nhave seen that on the application when she signed it. His aunt Gayle's presence\r\nwhen the application was being completed and Gayle's friendship with Haynes\r\ncould provide another reason Lorenzo wanted to hide the information. Gayle\r\ntestified Lorenzo was extremely close to her—she was \"like a second mother to\r\nhim\" and had no knowledge of his previous drug use. As to Shenandoah's claim\r\nthat Lorenzo's failure to disclose his PTSD was fraudulent, in addition to the fact\r\nthat Lakeisha did not know Lorenzo thought he had PTSD, there is no evidence\r\nLorenzo was ever diagnosed with or treated for it—only Lorenzo's statement to\r\nO'Toole and Dr. Pathak that he suspected he suffered from it.\r\n\r\nThe facts of this case are significantly different from the facts of cases our courts\r\nhave deemed \"rare\" enough to merit determination of fraudulent intent as a matter\r\n\nof law. In Johnson, for example, the insured had been treated for alcoholism on\r\nten separate occasions, was at one point confined to a hospital, and was warned by\r\nhis physician to discontinue the use of alcohol completely to avoid \"ruin[ing] his\r\nhealth.\" 165 S.C. at 499, 164 S.E. at 176. However, when the insured filled out\r\nhis application for insurance only fourteen months after his last treatment for\r\nalcoholism,2 he denied any consumption of alcohol other than \"[a]n occasional\r\ndrink\" and claimed he had neither drunk alcohol to excess nor seen a doctor in the\r\nfive years leading up to his application. 165 S.C. at 498, 164 S.E. at 176. He also\r\nfalsely answered \"no\" and \"none\" to questions that would have revealed his severe\r\nalcoholism, including \"Have you ever consulted a physician or practitioner for any\r\nailment or disease . . . ?\" and \"What physicians or practitioners . . . have you\r\nconsulted or been examined or treated by within the past five years?\" Id. On these\r\nfacts, our supreme court stated \"this is one of those rare cases in which the\r\nundisputed facts can reasonably give rise to only one inference, namely, that the\r\npolicy was procured by fraud.\" 165 S.C. at 501, 164 S.E. at 177.\r\n\r\nIn Winburn, the insured was diagnosed with angina and was hospitalized for nine\r\ndays for \"an infected right Bartholin's gland cyst, an upper respiratory infection,\r\nsubacute bronchitis, and hypertensive arteriosclerotic heart disease, with coronary\r\ninsufficiency\" less than two years prior to filling out an application for life\r\ninsurance. 261 S.C. at 572, 577, 201 S.E.2d at 373, 376. Although the application\r\nspecifically asked whether the insured knew \"of any impairment now existing in\r\nyour health\" or had \"consulted a physician for any illness\" within three years prior\r\nto filling out the application, the insured did not reveal this information on her\r\napplication. 261 S.C. at 573, 201 S.E.2d at 374. Our supreme court affirmed the\r\ncircuit court's order granting the insurance company's motion for a directed verdict,\r\nstating:     We recognize that ordinarily, the question of fraud in a\r\n             case of this kind is for the jury, but we feel that this is\r\n             one of those rare cases where the only reasonable\r\n             conclusion from the uncontradicted facts is that the\r\n             insured intended to deceive and defraud the respondent\r\n             when she deliberately suppressed the truth and gave false\r\n             answers as to her health or physical condition and prior\r\n             medical treatment, of which she had full knowledge.\r\n\r\n2 See 165 S.C. at 504, 164 S.E. at 178 (Carter, J., dissenting) (stating the insured's\r\nlast treatment for alcoholism was November 7, 1928, and he made the application\r\nfor insurance January 8, 1930).\r\n\n261 S.C. at 578, 201 S.E.2d at 376.\r\n\r\nIn Parker v. Pacific Mutual Life Insurance Company of California, 179 S.C. 117,\r\n183 S.E. 697 (1935), a disability insurance case, the insured stated he had\r\npreviously suffered from influenza and pneumonia, but that he had completely\r\nrecovered seven years prior to filling out the application. 179 S.C. at 119, 120, 183\r\nS.E. at 697, 698. In reality, the insured experienced frequent and recurring attacks\r\nof both illnesses during that seven-year period and had consulted numerous\r\nphysicians regarding his condition. 179 S.C. at 124-29, 183 S.E. at 700-02. The\r\ninsured was a physician practicing in a specialty dealing with the illnesses he\r\nsuffered from and, as the court stated, \"he was certainly aware of their significance\r\nand materiality in connection with his application for insurance.\" 179 S.C. at 122,\r\n183 S.E. at 699. Based on these facts, the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n             It is inconceivable that Dr. Parker did not know that, if he\r\n             told the insurance company [the truth], the insurance\r\n             would not have been issued to him. The only reasonable\r\n             inference to be drawn, therefore, is that Dr. Parker\r\n             deliberately withheld this information, with the\r\n             fraudulent purpose of procuring the insurance.\r\n\r\n179 S.C. at 133, 183 S.E. at 703-04.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the facts concealed by the insured is a consistent theme in these\r\n\"rare\" cases. In Johnson, Winburn, and Parker for example, the facts concealed\r\nwere indisputably known by the insured to relate directly to a significantly\r\nincreased risk of death or, in Parker, disability. From the insureds' knowledge of\r\nthis increased risk, the court found the existence of fraudulent intent in those cases\r\nas a matter of law. Additionally, in the cases the trial court cited in support of its\r\ndirected verdict, the insured was diagnosed with a grave illness and applied for life\r\ninsurance with the intent to defraud the insurance company as to that illness.3 In\r\n\r\n3 See, e.g., Nationwide Life Ins. Co. v. Attaway, 254 F.2d 30, 32, 34 (4th Cir. 1958)\r\n(fraud as a matter of law where insured received extensive treatment for symptoms\r\ntypical of heart disease that he did not disclose); Washington v. Garden State Life\r\nIns. Co., No. 3:06-2824-MBS, 2007 WL 2363827, at *1-2, 4 (D.S.C. Aug. 16,\r\n2007) (insured renewed application for insurance six months after HIV diagnosis\r\nbut stated he had not tested positive for HIV or consulted a doctor in last five\r\nyears); Reese v. Woodmen of the World Life Ins. Soc., 221 S.C. 193, 203, 69 S.E.2d\r\n\nthese cases, the insured obviously knew at the time of the misrepresentation that he\r\nor she faced a substantially increased risk of death from the very condition he or\r\nshe lied about on the insurance application.\r\n\r\nThis case, on the other hand, is not one of those rare cases. Shenandoah presented\r\nno evidence that Lorenzo, at age twenty-six, associated his alcohol or cocaine use\r\nwith any increased medical risk. The medical records from Lorenzo's visit to Dorn\r\nMedical Center reveal that he admitted \"drug and alcohol use\" to a nurse, and that\r\na doctor assessed it as alcohol and cocaine \"abuse.\" However, neither the nurse\r\nnor the doctor remembered at trial what Lorenzo said that led them to write what\r\nthey wrote in the records. Viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving\r\nparty, Dr. Pathak's used the term \"abuse\" to refer to isolated cocaine and alcohol\r\nuse. As to any mental disorder, the record contains nothing more than Lorenzo's\r\nsuspicion he had PTSD. These facts support a reasonable inference that Lorenzo's\r\nfailure to disclose the information was not fraudulent. See Metro. Life Ins. Co. v.\r\nBates, 213 S.C. 269, 282, 280, 49 S.E.2d 201, 206 (1948) (supreme court reversed\r\na directed verdict for insurance company, stating \"[c]onscious fraud could not be\r\ninferred from mere inaccurate answers,\" and a \"[r]easonable inference . . . is . . .\r\nthat [the insured] considered [one consultation with a physician] of insufficient\r\nconsequence to notify the company\") (quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n      V.     Shenandoah's Other Arguments\r\n\r\nShenandoah makes two additional arguments that we reject. First, Shenandoah\r\nargues the fact that Lorenzo signed the application containing the\r\nmisrepresentations is conclusive evidence he did so with fraudulent intent. We\r\ndisagree. The simple fact that an answer on a signed application is false does not\r\n\r\n919, 923 (1952) (intent to defraud inferred as a matter of law because of applicant's\r\nrecent and extended medical care for serious heart disease); Robinson v. Pilgrim\r\nHealth & Life Ins. Co., 216 S.C. 141, 145, 57 S.E.2d 60, 62 (1949) (fraud as a\r\nmatter of law where insured stated he was generally in sound health and concealed\r\na recent operation for tuberculosis); Murray v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 193 S.C. 368,\r\n370-71, 8 S.E.2d 314, 315 (1940) (insured stated he had not been treated by a\r\nphysician and had no health problems when he had been hospitalized for advance\r\ntuberculosis); McLester v. Metro. Life Ins. Co., 175 S.C. 425, 428-29, 179 S.E.\r\n490, 491-92 (1935) (fraud as a matter of law where insured was informed she had\r\nan incurable cancer, sought an insurance agent's office away from her town, and\r\nfailed to disclose her cancer).\r\n\nsatisfy an insurer's burden of proving the applicant made the misrepresentation\r\nwith the intent to defraud the company. See Smiley, 249 S.C. at 465, 154 S.E.2d at\r\n836 (stating \"the mere signing of the application containing the answers alleged to\r\nbe false is not conclusive\" of fraudulent intent (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\nSecond, Shenandoah argues there is no evidence in the record to support Lakeisha's\r\nposition that Lorenzo concealed the information to hide it from his wife and aunt.\r\nThis argument misapplies the burden of proof. See Lanham, 349 S.C. at 364, 563\r\nS.E.2d at 334 (\"[T]he burden of proof rests upon the insurer to show, by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence, . . . that [the statements] were made with intent to . . . defraud\r\nthe company.\"). In holding that a jury could reasonably conclude Shenandoah\r\nfailed to meet its burden of proof, we do not rely on the existence of evidence\r\npresented by Lakeisha. Rather, we hold that the evidence Shenandoah presented is\r\ninsufficient to support a conclusion that it proved Lorenzo's fraudulent intent\r\nclearly and convincingly as a matter of law. Our discussion of \"several plausible\r\nexplanations\" is simply to illustrate that there is more than one inference a jury\r\nmay reasonably draw from this evidence. This is particularly true in light of the\r\nclear and convincing standard of proof Shenandoah must meet. See Duncan v.\r\nFord Motor Co., 385 S.C. 119, 138, 682 S.E.2d 877, 886 (Ct. App. 2009) (\"Clear\r\nand convincing evidence is: that degree of proof which will produce in the mind of\r\nthe trier of facts a firm belief as to the allegations sought to be established. The\r\nclear and convincing standard is the highest burden of proof known to civil law.\"\r\n(internal citations and quotation marks omitted)).\r\n\r\n      VI.    Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe do not condone Lorenzo's misrepresentations. We find, however, a jury could\r\nhave reasonably concluded Shenandoah failed to prove Lorenzo made the\r\nmisrepresentations with the intent to defraud the insurance company. Therefore,\r\nthe trial court should not have directed a verdict in favor of Shenandoah.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nPIEPER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J. dissents.\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J., dissenting: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the order of\r\nthe circuit court. I disagree with the majority's holding that a jury could reasonably\r\nconclude that Shenandoah failed to meet its burden of proving Lorenzo made the\r\n\nmisrepresentation with the requisite fraudulent intent. The undisputed evidence\r\nindicates that Lorenzo reported alcohol and cocaine abuse to a nurse and treating\r\nphysician just one year prior to completing the insurance application at issue in the\r\nthis case.\r\n\r\nFurther, I disagree with the majority's reliance on its finding that no evidence\r\nindicated that Lorenzo associated his alcohol or cocaine use with any increased\r\nmedical risk. I believe the association of a prospective insured's drug and alcohol\r\nabuse to an increased medical risk is patently apparent. See Sadel v. Berkshire Life\r\nIns. Co. of Am., 473 Fed. Appx. 152, 156 (3d Cir. 2012) (affirming the trial court's\r\norder granting the insurance company summary judgment on its rescission\r\ncounterclaims because clear and convincing evidence indicated the insurer's\r\napplication included fraudulent statements, namely denying past drug use and\r\ntreatment for drug use); Burkert v. Equitable Life Assur. Soc. of Am., 287 F.3d 293,\r\n297-98 (3d Cir. 2002) (noting that under Pennsylvania law, misrepresentations\r\nregarding alcohol abuse in a life insurance application are deemed to be made in\r\nbad faith as a matter of law and extending those holdings to drug abuse); Life Ins.\r\nCo. of Ga. v. Helmuth, 357 S.E.2d 107, 108-09 (Ga. Ct. App. 1987) (reversing the\r\ntrial court's denial of an insurance company's directed verdict motion based on\r\nundisputed evidence that the insured concealed information about her past\r\ntreatment for drug and alcohol use). Moreover, evidence that Lorenzo failed to\r\ndisclose his drug and alcohol use in order to conceal his conduct from his wife and\r\naunt is purely speculative and, further, is irrelevant to the question of his intent to\r\ndefraud Shenandoah. I believe that, as a matter of law, Lorenzo's knowing and\r\nwillful concealment of his drug and alcohol abuse demonstrated an intent to\r\ndefraud Shenandoah and, thus, the trial court did not err in granting Shenandoah's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5077","title":"Bishop v.

We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS/ PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nRetirees are a group of retired firefighters and police officers who each worked at\r\nleast twenty years for the City of Columbia. Retirees elected to have group health\r\ninsurance provided by the City through BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina.\r\nPrior to July 1, 2009, the City paid all costs required to fund the group health\r\ninsurance for employees and retirees. Retirees received newsletters stating retiree\r\nhealth insurance was free and were told by the City's human resources department\r\nthat retiree health insurance would be at no cost to the retiree.\r\n\r\nRetirees received an employee handbook and an insurance benefits booklet each\r\nyear they were employed by the City. Under the heading \"Employee Benefits,\" the\r\nemployee handbook provided, \"All employees who retire at age 65 or later . . . will\r\nbe kept under the City's group coverage with the City making a cash contribution.\"\r\nThe employee handbook also outlined a policy for employees who retire with\r\ntwenty years or more of continuous service, stating, \"Currently the City will, at no\r\ncost to eligible employees, continue health coverage for eligible employees.\"\r\n\r\nThe employee handbook's cover page stated in large font that the employee\r\nhandbook was \"(NOT A CONTRACT).\" The next page of the employee\r\nhandbook was dedicated to an \"IMPORTANT NOTICE,\" which stated,\r\n\"NOTHING IN THIS HANDBOOK . . . SHALL BE DEEMED TO\r\nCONSTITUTE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT.\" The important notice\r\nfurther noted, \"The City reserves the right to revise, supplement, or rescind any\r\npolicies or portion of the employee handbook, from time to time, as it deems\r\nappropriate in its sole and absolute discretion.\"\r\n\r\nThe insurance benefits booklet provided to employees and Retirees each year\r\nstated health insurance was \"not just fringe benefits, but because the City pays the\r\nvast majority of the cost for [Retirees], they represent a significant cost of\r\ncompensation far beyond your paycheck.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nRetirees stated they relied on assurances made by supervisors that retiree health\r\ninsurance would continue to be free, and they stated they accepted lesser salaries\r\nwhile employed by the City because of the City's policy of providing free health\r\ninsurance to retirees.\r\n\r\nIn planning for the 2009-2010 budget, the City considered a number of cost-saving\r\nmeasures, including shifting part of rising health care costs to participants in the\r\nCity's group health insurance plan. Plan participants, including Retirees, received\r\ninformation, offered objections, and attended meetings concerning the proposed\r\nchanges to the group health insurance policy. On May 6, 2009, the City Council\r\nunanimously voted to require financial contributions by employees and retirees for\r\nparticipation in the group health insurance plan beginning July 1, 2009. Each of\r\nthe Retirees left employment with the City before July 1, 2009.\r\n\r\nOn August 10, 2009, thirteen retirees sued the City seeking: (1) reimbursement of\r\nall premiums paid since July 1, 2009; (2) individual health insurance on the same\r\nterms as provided on the date of retirement prior to July 1, 2009; (3) guarantee of\r\nno future reductions in benefits for life; and (4) guarantee of no charges for health\r\nbenefits for life. The Retirees alleged four causes of action: (1) breach of contract;\r\n(2) promissory estoppel; (3) violation of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices\r\nAct; and (4) declaratory judgment. With the consent of the City, the Retirees\r\namended their complaint to assert equitable estoppel as a cause of action. The City\r\nfiled a motion to dismiss, and the circuit court dismissed Retirees' unfair trade\r\npractices claim but allowed the remaining actions to proceed. The City timely\r\nfiled a motion for reconsideration, or in the alternative, a motion to stay pending\r\nappeal. The circuit court denied both of the City's motions. The City made a\r\nsummary judgment motion on May 6, 2010. After a hearing, the circuit court\r\ngranted the City summary judgment on Retirees' breach of contract, promissory\r\nestoppel, and equitable estoppel causes of action.1 Seven of the thirteen retirees\r\nbring this appeal.\r\n                                                            \r\n1The circuit court found Retirees' claims were not actionable in contract because:\r\n(1) Retirees were at-will employees and the City promised Retirees unvested fringe\r\nbenefits, rather than compensation; (2) the City could not be legally bound by\r\npromises and representations made by its employees; (3) the City's handbooks and\r\nbenefits booklets used present tense language that did not make permanent\r\nguarantees to support a contractual right; (4) any contract for future benefits would\r\nviolate public policy because it would bind future city councils in the performance\r\nof their governmental functions; and (5) the benefits are governed by the contract\r\nbetween the City and BlueCross BlueShield of South Carolina. The court found\r\n\r\n \r\n\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the same\r\nstandard applied by the [circuit] court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Bovain v. Canal\r\nIns., 383 S.C. 100, 105, 678 S.E.2d 422, 424 (2009). Rule 56(c) provides a circuit\r\ncourt may grant a motion for summary judgment \"if the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Id. (quoting Rule 56(c),\r\nSCRCP). \"In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence and\r\nall inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in\r\nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt.\r\nCo., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 329-30, 673 S.E.2d 801, 802 (2009).\r\n\r\n\"A court considering summary judgment neither makes factual determinations nor\r\nconsiders the merits of competing testimony; however, summary judgment is\r\nappropriate when a properly supported motion sets forth facts that remain\r\nundisputed or are contested in a deficient manner.\" David v. McLeod Reg'l Med.\r\nCtr., 367 S.C. 242, 250, 626 S.E.2d 1, 5 (2006). In Hancock, our supreme court\r\nclarified that the level of evidence required to defeat a motion for summary\r\njudgment is dependent upon the non-moving party's burden of proof at trial. 381\r\nS.C. at 330-31, 673 S.E.2d at 803.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.            Breach of Contract\r\n\r\nRetirees argue the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment on their cause\r\nof action for breach of contract because the record establishes the City breached\r\nthe contract they had with Retirees. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, Retirees argue the City offered to pay the cost of the retiree health\r\ninsurance through the employee handbook, insurance benefits booklet, and\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nRetirees' claims were not actionable in promissory or equitable estoppel because\r\nthe actions and statements of the City's employees could not bind a municipality in\r\nthe council–manager form of government; Retirees are deemed to know this\r\nlimitation; and Retirees therefore could not reasonably rely on any of the alleged\r\npromises or representations in deciding to work for the City.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nstatements made by City representatives. Retirees contend they accepted the offer\r\nby complete performance, working for the City for over twenty years. Further,\r\nRetirees argue working for the City for more than twenty years constituted valid\r\nconsideration for the contract because they could have earned higher salaries from\r\nother employers.\r\n\r\nThe City argues the employee handbook, insurance benefits booklet, and verbal\r\nrepresentations do not create a unilateral contract for continuing free health\r\ninsurance. We agree with the City and address each assertion in turn.\r\n\r\nA.    Employee Handbook\r\n\r\nRetirees argue the employee handbook created a unilateral contract. We disagree.\r\n\r\nA unilateral contract has three elements: (1) a specific offer; (2) communication of\r\nthe offer to the employee; and (3) performance of job duties in reliance on the\r\noffer. Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Co-op., Inc., 335 S.C. 330, 336, 516 S.E.2d 923,\r\n926 (1999). \"The issue of whether an employee handbook constitutes a contract\r\nshould be submitted to the jury when the issue of the contract's existence is\r\nquestioned and the evidence is either conflicting or is capable of more than one\r\ninference.\" Watkins v. Disabilities Bd. of Charleston Cnty., 444 F.Supp.2d 510,\r\n514 (D.S.C. 2006). However, a court should resolve whether the employee\r\nhandbook constitutes a contract as a matter of law when the employee handbook's\r\npolicies and disclaimers, taken together, establish that an enforceable promise does\r\nor does not exist. Id. An employee handbook forms a contract when: (1) the\r\nhandbook provisions and procedures in question apply to the employee; (2) the\r\nhandbook sets out procedures binding on the employer; and (3) the handbook does\r\nnot contain a conspicuous and appropriate disclaimer. Grant v. Mount Vernon\r\nMills, Inc., 370 S.C. 138, 146, 634 S.E.2d 15, 20 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\nHere, we find the employee handbooks applied to the Retirees during their\r\nemployment, and the employee handbooks set out a policy of continuing free\r\nhealth insurance. Specifically, the 1987 version stated, \"The City of Columbia\r\nhereby declares as a matter of policy that the City government . . . can better serve\r\nthe public by administering . . . a personnel program which provides for and\r\nincorporates the following: . . . 5. Providing a program of extended benefits\r\nincluding . . . retirement benefits. \" Later versions of the handbook added the\r\nfollowing: \"Currently, the City will, at no cost to eligible employees, continue\r\nhealth coverage for eligible employees in accordance with the following\"\r\neligibility requirements. We hold a contract does not exist.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nIn Marr v. City of Columbia, 307 S.C. 545, 547, 416 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1992), our\r\nsupreme court held an employee handbook did not form a contract when the\r\nemployee handbook had a large disclaimer on the front cover stating, \"Not a\r\nContract\"; there was no evidence the employee handbook was treated as a contract\r\nnotwithstanding the disclaimer; and there was no evidence the parties waived the\r\ndisclaimer. Further in Marr, the next page of the employee handbook contained an\r\n\"IMPORTANT NOTICE\" that explicitly stated nothing in the handbook should be\r\ndeemed to constitute a contract. Id. The court went on to state the following:\r\n\r\n            If an employer wishes to issue policies, manuals, or\r\n            bulletins as purely advisory statements with no intent of\r\n            being bound by them and with a desire to continue under\r\n            the employment at will policy, he certainly is free to do\r\n            so. This could be accomplished merely by inserting a\r\n            conspicuous disclaimer or provision into the written\r\n            document. . . . Where, as here, the employer\r\n            conspicuously disclaims the handbook as a contract and\r\n            the parties have not waived the disclaimer, summary\r\n            judgment for the employer on the issue of whether the\r\n            handbook forms an employment contract is appropriate.\r\n\r\nId.\r\n\r\nSince at least 1987 the employee handbooks contained the same disclaimer as the\r\nemployee handbook in Marr, stating in large font, \"Not a Contract\" on the front\r\ncover of the employee handbooks. Further, the page after the cover page of the\r\nemployee handbooks was devoted to an \"IMPORTANT NOTICE,\" which\r\nprovided in bold, conspicuous language: \"NOTHING IN THIS HANDBOOK OR\r\nIN ANY OF THE CITY'S PERSONNEL POLICIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO\r\nCONSTITUTE A CONTRACT OF EMPLOYMENT . . . .\" Each Retiree signed\r\nnumerous acknowledgment forms confirming the employee handbooks did not\r\ncreate a contract. We find the plain language of the employee handbook\r\nconspicuously disclaims the existence of a contract, and no evidence indicates the\r\nCity treated the handbook as a contract despite the disclaimer.\r\n\r\nMoreover, our current statutory framework supports the conclusion that the\r\nemployee handbook contained a conspicuous disclaimer. On March 15, 2004, the\r\nSouth Carolina General Assembly passed section 41-1-110 of the South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\nCode (Supp. 2011), which states a handbook shall not create an employment\r\ncontract if it is conspicuously disclaimed. Section 41-1-110 provides:\r\n\r\n                             It is the public policy of this State that a handbook,\r\n                             personnel manual, policy, procedure, or other document\r\n                             issued by an employer or its agent after June 30, 2004,\r\n                             shall not create an express or implied contract of\r\n                             employment if it is conspicuously disclaimed. For\r\n                             purposes of this section, a disclaimer in a handbook or\r\n                             personnel manual must be in underlined capital letters on\r\n                             the first page of the document and signed by the\r\n                             employee. For all other documents referenced in this\r\n                             section, the disclaimer must be in underlined capital\r\n                             letters on the first page of the document. Whether or not\r\n                             a disclaimer is conspicuous is a question of law.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Section 41-1-110 applies to all employee handbooks issued by\r\nthe City after June 30, 2004.2 The only employee handbook provided in the record\r\nafter June 30, 2004, is the employee handbook for 2005. As said before, the\r\nsecond page of the 2005 employee handbook contained a disclaimer stating,\r\n\"NOTHING IN THIS HANDBOOK OR IN ANY OF THE CITY'S PERSONNEL\r\nPOLICIES SHALL BE DEEMED TO CONSTITUTE A CONTRACT OF\r\nEMPLOYMENT . . . .\" This disclaimer was in all capital letters and was\r\nunderlined. Additionally, beginning in 2004, Retirees signed a disclaimer\r\ncontained in the employee handbook. Analogizing to the current statute, we find\r\nthe disclaimer contained in the 2005 employee handbook was conspicuous as a\r\nmatter of law, and the City did not waive the disclaimer. See § 41-1-110 (\"[A]\r\nhandbook . . . issued by an employer . . . shall not create an express or implied\r\ncontract of employment if it is conspicuously disclaimed.\"); Marr v. City of\r\nColumbia, 307 S.C. 545, 547, 416 S.E.2d 615, 616 (1992) (\"Where, as here, the\r\nemployer conspicuously disclaims the handbook as a contract and the parties have\r\nnot waived the disclaimer, summary judgment for the employer on the issue of\r\nwhether the handbook forms an employment contract is appropriate.\").\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court did not err in granting summary judgment on\r\nRetirees' breach of contract claim.\r\n\r\nB.            Insurance Benefits Booklet\r\n                                                            \r\n2All other employee handbooks provided in the record are not subject to section\r\n41-1-110 as they were issued prior to June 30, 2004.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nRetirees also argue the insurance benefits booklet created a unilateral contract for\r\ncontinuing free health insurance. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWe need not address whether performance in accordance with the insurance\r\nbenefits booklet creates a unilateral contract because, even if it did, nowhere in the\r\ninsurance benefits booklet does it provide that Retirees are entitled to continuing\r\nfree health insurance. Under the title, \"Retiree Participation Requirements (Must\r\nhave 20 years of City Employment),\"3 the insurance benefit booklet states:\r\n\r\n                             Health coverage is available to retiring employees and\r\n                             dependents if certain eligibility requirements are met . . .\r\n                             . An eligible participant must qualify for a City of\r\n                             Columbia Retirement Program, Fire Fighters Retirement,\r\n                             or Police Retirement. The participant must have worked\r\n                             for the city as a regular employee (at least 30 hours a\r\n                             week) . . . . Retiree Health Coverage for this program\r\n                             will be paid under the benefits specified in this booklet\r\n                             until the attainment of 65. At age 65, the retiree must be\r\n                             enrolled in Medicare PART A and PART B under TITLE\r\n                             XVIII of the Social Security Act.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find the circuit court did not err in finding the insurance benefits\r\nbooklet did not create a contract for continuing free health insurance for Retirees.\r\n\r\nC.            Representations by City Employees\r\n\r\nRetirees argue representations made by City employees, such as supervisors and\r\nhuman resource employees, created enforceable unilateral contracts that were\r\nconsummated by Retirees' continued employment with the City. We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the City's employees to contract with Retirees is limited to the\r\nauthority that can be traced from those employees to the provisions of legislation\r\nfrom which they derive their power. See S.C. Code Ann. § 5-7-160 (2011) (\"All\r\npowers of the municipality are vested in the council, except as otherwise provided\r\nby law, and the council shall provide for the exercise thereof and for the\r\n                                                            \r\n3 The number of years of employment required to qualify for participation in the\r\nRetiree Program increased over the years from no time requirement, to ten years, to\r\nfifteen years, to twenty years.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nperformance of all duties and obligations imposed on the municipality by law.\");\r\nCity of Columbia Ordinance § 1-2(a) (providing that whenever the ordinances\r\nrequire or authorize the head of a department or other officer of the city to do some\r\nact or perform some duty, the department head or other officer is authorized to\r\ndesignate, delegate and authorize subordinates to do the required act or perform the\r\nrequired duty unless the terms of the provision specifically designate otherwise);\r\ncf. 56 Am. Jur. 2d Municipal Corporations, Etc. § 237 (\"The general rule with\r\nregard to municipal officers is that they have only such powers as are expressly\r\ngranted by . . . sovereign authority or those which are necessarily to be implied\r\nfrom those granted.\").\r\n\r\nHere, the City has adopted the council–manager form of municipal government.\r\nCity of Columbia Ordinance § 2-1. Under that form, the City's legislative and\r\npolicy powers are vested in the City Council, and the salaries of the City's\r\nemployees and officials must be approved by the City Council. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n5-13-30 (2011); City of Columbia Ordinance § 2-111. The City Manager is the\r\nchief executive officer and administrative head of the City. Thus, he is responsible\r\nfor the administration of the municipality's affairs, including the employment of\r\nassistants to exercise such supervisory responsibilities over departments as he may\r\ndelegate. S.C. Code Ann. § 5-13-90 (2011); City of Columbia Ordinance § 2-\r\n114(a)-(b). Further, each officer and department head has supervisory control of\r\nhis department subject to the City Manager's direction and is authorized to delegate\r\npower to subordinates to perform their duties. City of Columbia Ordinance § 2-\r\n151(a)-(b); City of Columbia Ordinance § 2-125.\r\n\r\nTherefore, to survive summary judgment on this argument, Retirees must provide a\r\nscintilla of evidence that the supervisors and human resource personnel who made\r\nthe alleged promises had authority to create contracts for continuing free life\r\ninsurance. Retirees have failed to do so. They have failed to show any action by\r\nthe City Council or City Manager authorizing such contracts or granting the\r\nauthority to these employees to enter the contract. They also failed to provide any\r\nevidence the supervisors and human resource employees who made the promises\r\neither had authority to enter these contracts directly or through the proper\r\ndelegation of authority. Consequently, these alleged promises cannot bind the City\r\nunder a theory of unilateral contract.4\r\n                                                            \r\n4The City also argues, and Retirees dispute, that summary judgment on the\r\ncontract claims was appropriate because: (1) Retirees were \"at-will\" employees; (2)\r\ncontracts for continuing free health insurance would violate public policy; and (3)\r\nRetirees could not have a permanent right to free lifetime health insurance under\r\n\r\n \r\n\nII.           Promissory Estoppel and Equitable Estoppel\r\n\r\nRetirees argue the circuit court erred in granting the City's motion for summary\r\njudgment on the promissory estoppel and equitable estoppel causes of action.\r\nRetirees maintain a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether they\r\nreasonably relied on statements by City's representatives and written promises to\r\nprovide continuing free health insurance after retirement. We agree in part.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, to prove estoppel against a city, the relying party must prove: (1)\r\nlack of knowledge and of the means to obtain the knowledge of the truth as to the\r\nfacts in question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct; and (3) a\r\nprejudicial change in position. S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. Horry Cnty., 391 S.C. 76,\r\n83, 705 S.E. 2d 21, 25 (2011). Similarly, the elements of promissory estoppel are:\r\n(1) a promise unambiguous in its terms; (2) the party to whom the promise is made\r\nreasonably relies on it; (3) the reliance is expected and foreseeable by the party\r\nwho makes the promise; and (4) the party to whom the promise is made must\r\nsustain injury in reliance on the promise. Woods v. State, 314 S.C. 501, 505, 431\r\nS.E.2d 260, 263 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nA.            Written Promises\r\n\r\nRetirees assert summary judgment was inappropriate because there is evidence\r\nthey reasonably relied to their detriment on the City's written promises to provide\r\nfree health insurance made in the employee handbook, insurance benefits booklet,\r\nand employee newsletters.5 We agree in part.\r\n\r\nRetirees argue they relied upon the employee handbook and benefits booklet in\r\ndeciding to remain employed with the City each year until they reached twenty\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\nAlston v. City of Camden, 322 S.C. 38, 471 S.E.2d 174 (1996). Because we affirm\r\nthe grant of summary judgment against the contract claims on other grounds, we\r\nneed not address these arguments. See Futch v. McAllister Towing Inc., 335 S.C.\r\n598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review\r\nremaining issues when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the\r\nappeal).\r\n5 We do not address the employee newsletters in light of our finding that summary\r\njudgment was not appropriate as a result of the City's oral promises and\r\nrepresentations.\r\n\r\n \r\n\nyears' service. However, the employee handbook conspicuously disclaimed any\r\nbinding promises, and the benefits booklet made no promises of continuing free\r\nhealth insurance at all. Therefore, Retirees cannot claim reasonable reliance on\r\nthose materials, and the estoppel claims cannot survive summary judgment to the\r\nextent the claims are based on them.\r\n\r\nB.    Statements by City Employees\r\n\r\nRetirees argue summary judgment on estoppel was inappropriate because there is a\r\ngenuine issue of fact as to whether they reasonable relied on promises and\r\nrepresentations made by City employees. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe acts of a city official acting within the proper scope of his or her authority may\r\ngive rise to estoppel against a municipality. Charleston Cnty. v. Nat'l Advert. Co.,\r\n292 S.C. 416, 418, 357 S.E.2d 9, 10 (1987); Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle\r\nBeach, 285 S.C. 216, 221, 329 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1985) (\"Government agents,\r\nacting within the proper scope of their authority, can by their acts give rise to\r\nestoppel against a municipality.\"); Abbeville Arms v. City of Abbeville, 273 S.C.\r\n491, 493-94, 257 S.E.2d 716, 718 (1979) (holding the city was not immune from\r\nan estoppel claim because a permit applicant bought property in reliance upon: (1)\r\na zoning ordinance passed by the city council and a zoning map issued by the city\r\npursuant to the ordinance that indicated the applicant's property was zoned for the\r\napplicant's intended purpose and (2) a statement by the city zoning administrator\r\nconfirming what the ordinance and zoning map said). \"The public cannot be\r\nestopped, however, by the unauthorized or erroneous conduct or statements of its\r\nofficers or agents which have been relied on by a third party to his detriment.\" S.C.\r\nCoastal Council v. Vogel, 292 S.C. 449, 453, 357 S.E.2d 187, 189 (Ct. App. 1987).\r\n\r\nThe City cites to a number of cases, arguing that they indicate Retirees could not\r\nrely upon the representation of City employees as to whether they were entitled to\r\nfree health insurance for life. However, two of the cases do not involve\r\ngovernmental entities. See McLaughlin v. Williams, 379 S.C. 451, 457-58, 665\r\nS.E.2d 667, 671 (Ct. App. 2008); West v. Gladney, 341 S.C. 127, 134-35, 533\r\nS.E.2d 334, 337-38 (Ct. App. 2000). Other cases involve civil rights claims\r\nalleging violations of the plaintiffs' constitutional rights as a result of official\r\npolicy by the City. See Stanley v. Kirkpatrick, 357 S.C. 169, 176, 592 S.E.2d 296,\r\n299 (2004); Todd v. Smith, 305 S.C. 227, 230-31, 407 S.E.2d 644, 646-47 (1991).\r\nAnother case addresses whether a public officer could sustain a contract claim.\r\nSee Piedmont Pub. Serv. Dist. v. Cowart, 319 S.C. 124, 131, 459 S.E.2d 876, 880\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\n(Ct. App. 1995), aff'd by 324 S.C. 239, 478 S.E.2d 836 (1996). Further cases hold\r\nthat estoppel will not lie against a governmental entity when the government's\r\nemployee gives erroneous information in contradiction of a statute. See Berkeley\r\nElec. Co-op., Inc. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 308 S.C. 205, 210-11, 417 S.E.2d\r\n579, 582-83 (1992); Am. Legion Post 15 v. Horry County, 381 S.C. 576, 584, 674\r\nS.E.2d 181, 185 (Ct. App. 2009); Morgan v. S.C. Budget & Control Bd., 377 S.C.\r\n313, 319-20, 659 S.E.2d 263, 267 (Ct. App. 2008). One also holds that a party\r\ncannot reasonably rely on government conduct to create a contract where the\r\ngovernmental actor purports to act pursuant to legislation that itself does not give\r\nauthority to make the contract. See Ahrens v. State, 392 S.C. 340, 353-57, 709\r\nS.E.2d 54, 61-63 (2011). Lastly, a case holds that the plaintiffs could not rely upon\r\nrepresentations by a governmental employee where the employee explicitly said\r\nhis assertions were subject to the school board's approval. See Davis v. Greenwood\r\nSchool Dist., 365 S.C. 629, 634-35, 620 S.E.2d 65, 67-68 (2005).\r\n\r\nNone of the above cases answer whether a private party may rely on the\r\nrepresentations of municipal employees for estoppel claims when the authority to\r\nmake those representations can be traced back to the legislation that granted the\r\nmunicipal authority. See Oswald v. Aiken Cnty., 281 S.C. 298, 303, 315 S.E.2d\r\n146, 150 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"The County cannot escape liability to Oswald under a\r\npolicy it had the general power to implement on the ground that the administrator\r\nwas not technically authorized to approve payment for compensatory time.\").\r\nHere, the evidence does not conclusively indicate the City's employees gave\r\ninformation that contradicted a statute or ordinance. Nor does the evidence\r\nconclusively indicate the employees acted outside their authority when they\r\nexplained Retirees' benefits.\r\n\r\nRetirees provided a scintilla of evidence that they reasonably relied upon the\r\nrepresentations and promises of the City's human resource employees' explanations\r\nof the health insurance benefits to their detriment. Retirees presented evidence the\r\nCity's human resource employees repeatedly told them that retiree health insurance\r\nwould continue to be free throughout retirement, specifically during discussions on\r\nhow to explain the City's obligations to new recruits. The City provided\r\nemployees with newsletters stating free insurance would continue upon retirement.\r\nThe City Manager indicated that human resource employees were authorized to\r\ninform Retirees about their insurance benefits, and the City's ordinances support\r\nthis testimony.6\r\n                                                            \r\n6 See City of Columbia Ordinance § 2-114 (\"(a) Duties. The city manager shall be\r\nthe chief executive officer of the city and head of the administrative branch of city\r\n\r\n \r\n\nRetirees also testified that several supervisors informed them they would receive\r\nfree health insurance for life during their individual merit interviews and\r\nevaluations, which were incidental to the supervision of their employment.\r\nTherefore, the employment review context during which the representations were\r\nmade provides a scintilla of evidence to suggest the representations and promises\r\nwere within the supervisors' authority and reasonably relied upon.\r\n\r\nTherefore, instead of holding Retirees were charged with knowledge of the extent\r\nto which the City's employees were incorrect, it is a question of fact as to whether\r\nthese explanations were authorized and reasonably relied upon. As a result, the\r\ntrial court erred in granting summary judgment on Retirees' estoppel claims.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we find the trial court properly granted summary judgment\r\nagainst Retirees on their contract claims. We also find the trial court properly\r\ngranted summary judgment against Retirees on all of their estoppel claims to the\r\nextent those claims are based upon the employee handbook and benefits booklet.\r\nHowever, we find the trial court erred in granting summary judgment against\r\nRetirees on their estoppel claims based upon representations made by their\r\nsupervisors and the City's human resource personnel.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court's rulings are\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\ngovernment.

Gray argues the master erred in allowing Bank to\r\nproceed with its foreclosure action before her compulsory legal counterclaims were\r\nadjudicated. We reverse and remand.\r\n\nFACTS\r\n\r\nGray purchased an unimproved lot in Oconee County as a real estate investment.\r\nOn March 30, 2010, Bank filed a summons, complaint, and lis pendens seeking an\r\norder of foreclosure and a deficiency judgment against Gray in regards to Bank's\r\nfirst mortgage on the lot. On May 18, 2010, Gray filed an answer, and Bank\r\nsuccessfully moved to have the matter referred to the Oconee County master.\r\n\r\nOn June 17, 2010, Gray amended her answer and asserted five counterclaims:\r\nbreach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty, fraud, violations of the South Carolina\r\nUnfair Trade Practices Act, and tortious interference with economic opportunities.\r\nGray prayed for actual and punitive damages, attorney's fees, and costs. Bank\r\nreplied, denying Gray's counterclaims and asserting defenses.\r\n\r\nOn August 4, 2010, Bank filed a motion for separate trials pursuant to Rule 42(b),\r\nSCRCP. On August 25, 2010, a hearing was held before the master. Bank argued\r\nits equitable foreclosure action should be tried separately from Gray's legal\r\ncounterclaims. Bank also argued it should be allowed to proceed with its\r\nforeclosure action immediately because Gray had failed to protect the property\r\nfrom being sold at a tax sale, failed to pay costs incidental to the ownership of\r\nproperty such as homeowners' association dues and taxes, and did not occupy the\r\nlot as her residence.1 Bank contended that because the lot at issue was a vacant lot,\r\nproceeding with the foreclosure action immediately would not prejudice Gray.\r\nBank did not dispute that Gray's counterclaims were compulsory but argued that\r\nextenuating circumstances, namely that the lot's vacancy and Bank's continued\r\nexpenditures to maintain the property, warranted trying the foreclosure action\r\nbefore Gray's legal counterclaims.\r\n\r\nGray stated she had no objection to the bifurcation and remand of the legal claims\r\nto the circuit court but argued that her counterclaims were compulsory and that her\r\nlegal claims must be tried first. The master orally ruled that the foreclosure should\r\nproceed and that trying it first did not \"jeopardize[]\" Gray because the lot was\r\nvacant. In addition, the master instructed that Gray could add \"the loss of a\r\nvacant lot . . . to [her] damages claim maybe.\" The master issued a written order\r\non September 2, 2010, allowing the actions to be tried separately, remanding\r\nGray's legal claims to the circuit court, and allowing the foreclosure action to\r\n\r\n\r\n1In its brief, Bank notes that, following the hearing, it paid the 2009 Oconee\r\nCounty taxes to prevent the lot from being sold at a delinquent tax sale.\r\n\nproceed as soon as the docket allowed. The order specifically protected Gray's\r\nright to a jury trial on her legal claims. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nGray argues the master erred in holding Bank could proceed with its foreclosure\r\naction as soon as the docket allowed, thus allowing Bank's equitable claims to be\r\nadjudicated before Gray's compulsory legal counterclaims. Gray contends her\r\nactions are compulsory legal counterclaims and that there are factual issues\r\ncommon to both claims. We agree.\r\n\r\nWhen a defendant in an equitable action asserts a compulsory counterclaim that\r\nalleges actions at law, both the plaintiff and the defendant have a right to have a\r\njury trial on the issues raised by the compulsory legal counterclaim. Johnson v.\r\nS.C. Nat'l Bank, 292 S.C. 51, 54, 354 S.E.2d 895, 896 (1987). If there are factual\r\nissues common to both the legal and equitable claims, the legal claim, \"absent the\r\nmost imperative circumstances,\" must be tried, that is, disposed of, first. Id. at 56,\r\n354 S.E.2d at 897 (internal quotation marks omitted). In such cases, the United\r\nStates Supreme Court has cautioned that the discretion to try an equitable claim\r\nfirst \"is very narrowly limited and must, whenever possible, be exercised to\r\npreserve jury trial.\" Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 510 (1959).\r\nAccordingly, the Court indicated that such discretion should only be exercised in\r\nthe face of \"irreparable harm\" to the plaintiff if the legal claims were to be tried\r\nfirst. Id. \"If there are no common factual issues, it is within the trial judge's\r\ndiscretion which claim will be tried first.\" Johnson, 292 S.C. at 56, 354 S.E.2d at\r\n897.\r\n\r\nWe hold the master erred in allowing the foreclosure action to proceed prior to a\r\njury trial on Gray's legal counterclaims. Gray's counterclaims, which are\r\ncompulsory, rest on her allegations, inter alia, that Bank \"wrongfully, unlawfully,\r\nintentionally, willfully, and illegally declared Gray to be in default and/or . . .\r\naccelerated the balance due on the note and mortgage[,]\" fraudulently induced\r\nGray into executing the note and mortgage, and intentionally \"frustrated [Gray's]\r\nability to comply with the terms and conditions on her part to be performed.\"\r\nThese allegations all involve questions of fact that will most certainly arise in the\r\nforeclosure action, especially when considered in light of Gray's defenses to the\r\nforeclosure action, including unclean hands.\r\n\r\nBecause we find that Bank's equitable claim and Gray's legal counterclaims share\r\ncommon questions of fact, Gray's counterclaims must be tried first \"absent the\r\n\nmost imperative circumstances.\" Johnson, 292 S.C. at 56, 354 S.E.2d at 897\r\n(internal quotation marks omitted). No such showing has been made here. At the\r\nhearing on the motion to bifurcate, Bank argued that the foreclosure action should\r\nproceed because the value of the lot was declining based on the general state of the\r\neconomy and because Bank would have to pay taxes on the lot to prevent it from\r\nbeing sold at a tax sale scheduled for later in the year. These circumstances would\r\npossibly, if not likely, occur in every foreclosure action currently pending.\r\nFurther, neither of these concerns represent the kind of \"irreparable harm\"\r\ncontemplated by the Supreme Court that would justify infringing on Gray's\r\nconstitutional right to a trial by jury. Bank may recoup its payment of any taxes in\r\nthe foreclosure sale pursuant to section 29-3-30 of the South Carolina Code (2007)\r\nand may be entitled to a deficiency judgment for any balance remaining on the\r\nnote after the foreclosure sale should the proceeds from the foreclosure sale fail to\r\nsatisfy the full amount of the indebtedness. See S.C. Code Ann. § 29-3-660 (2007)\r\n(authorizing the court to direct the payment by the mortgagor of any remaining\r\nbalance of the mortgage debt left unsatisfied after a sale of the mortgaged\r\nproperty); see also Am. Gen. Fin. Servs., Inc. v. Brown, 376 S.C. 580, 583, 658\r\nS.E.2d 99, 100 (2008) (\"[T]he general rule is that if the mortgaged premises are\r\nsold under a foreclosure decree and fail to bring a sufficient amount to satisfy the\r\ndebt, the mortgagee is entitled, absent any statutory limitation or waiver on his\r\npart, to a personal judgment for the remaining deficiency.\" (internal quotation\r\nmarks omitted)). Accordingly, Bank has failed to demonstrate that this case falls\r\ninto the very limited class of cases in which a trial on the equitable claim before a\r\njury trial on any legal claims or counterclaims is justified.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the master's order to the extent it allows the\r\nforeclosure action to proceed prior to Gray's legal counterclaims and remand for\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nFEW, C.J., and PIEPER, J., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5078","title":"Estate of Livingston v.

We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nAtn Burns Livingston died in 1999. His will named his two children, Emma and\r\nClyde, as sole heirs and PRs of his estate. In 2000, Clyde applied for farm operator\r\nstatus with the USDA. Clyde signed the application in two capacities, signing as\r\nthe farmer applicant and noting he was signing on behalf of the estate, which was\r\nthe owner of the land. From 2000 to 2008, Clyde received USDA subsidy\r\npayments totaling $29,902.\r\n\r\nOn January 18, 2002, the probate court removed Clyde as co-PR of the estate on\r\nthe ground that he and Emma could not cooperate. Emma has served as the sole\r\nPR of the estate since that time. In April 2002, Emma received a letter from the\r\nUSDA regarding Clyde's status as a farm operator. She spoke with officials at the\r\nlocal USDA office, who informed her that Clyde had been receiving farm subsidy\r\npayments.\r\n\r\nEmma notified her attorney, who had been assisting her with the closing of the\r\nestate, about the subsidy payments. Her attorney discussed this issue with Clyde's\r\nattorney and on May 30, 2006, Emma brought a claim seeking reimbursement for\r\nthe USDA subsidies on behalf of the estate. The case was filed in the probate court\r\nand was removed to circuit court in April 2007. The case was then referred to the\r\nmaster on August 19, 2008. Also in 2008, Emma, as PR of the estate, began\r\nreceiving the USDA subsidies. Because the issues before the master were so\r\nnumerous, the case was trifurcated.\r\n\nPrior to trial, the master heard Clyde's motion for summary judgment on Emma's\r\nclaim concerning the USDA payments, but deferred ruling on the motion until after\r\nhearing the evidence at trial. When trial began on March 24, 2010, Emma testified\r\nand introduced the USDA records and a summary of benefit amounts paid. Clyde\r\nmoved for an involuntary nonsuit on the grounds that the USDA payments were\r\nnot property of the estate and the statute of limitations in section 15-3-530 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2005) would bar the claim. The master deferred ruling on\r\nthe motion.\r\n\r\nOn November 17, 2010, the master granted Clyde's motions for summary judgment\r\nand involuntary nonsuit in part and denied them in part. The master found the\r\nUSDA payments were part of the estate and found Clyde liable for receiving them;\r\nhowever the master limited Emma's recovery to $11,690 because the \"[t]he statute\r\nof limitations limits [Emma]'s recovery, on behalf of the estate, to the USDA\r\npayments that were made within three years before this action was commenced.\"\r\nThe master determined the recoverable portion of Emma's claim involved only\r\n$23,380, and because Clyde was a devisee entitled to one half of the estate, Emma\r\nhad the right to $11,690. The master further based his decision on section 62-3-\r\n619 of the South Carolina Code (2009), executor de son tort, finding half of the\r\nfarm subsidy payments would have gone to Clyde because he and Emma were the\r\nsole and equal devisees of the estate despite any limitation in recovery. The master\r\ndenied Emma's request for prejudgment interest because she did not plead that\r\nprejudgment interest should be awarded. Both parties appealed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nRule 41(b) permits the defendant, \"[a]fter the plaintiff in an action tried by the\r\ncourt without a jury has completed the presentation of his evidence,\" to move for a\r\ndismissal on the ground that upon the facts and the law the plaintiff has shown no\r\nright to relief. Rule 41(b), SCRCP (emphasis added); Silvester v. Spring Valley\r\nCountry Club, 344 S.C. 280, 284, 543 S.E.2d 563, 565 (Ct. App. 2001);\r\n See also Johnson v. J.P. Stevens & Co., 308 S.C. 116, 118, 417 S.E.2d 527, 529\r\n(1992) (holding Rule 41(b), allows the judge as the trier of facts to weigh the\r\nevidence, determine the facts, and render a judgment against the plaintiff at the\r\nclose of his case if justified). Because a dismissal under these circumstances has\r\nthe same effect as summary judgment, the standard for summary judgment applies.\r\n\nId. at 284-85, 543 S.E.2d at 566; Ex parte United Servs. Auto. Ass'n, 365 S.C. 50,\r\n53, 614 S.E.2d 652, 653 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases not\r\nrequiring the services of a fact finder. George v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548\r\nS.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). When reviewing the grant of a summary judgment\r\nmotion, this court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP; summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\r\nFleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). In determining\r\nwhether a genuine issue of fact exists, the evidence and all reasonable inferences\r\ndrawn from it must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\r\nSauner v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).\r\n\"Once the moving party carries its initial burden, the opposing party must come\r\nforward with specific facts that show there is a genuine issue of fact remaining for\r\ntrial.\" Sides v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 362 S.C. 250, 255, 607 S.E.2d 362, 364 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2004).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    USDA BENEFITS\r\n\r\nClyde argues the USDA benefits are not estate property because they were a\r\nproduct of a contract between himself and the USDA based on his status as a\r\nfarmer operator. He maintains the estate was not a farm operator, and as such he is\r\nsolely entitled to the benefits. Furthermore, he suggests he is a cotenant entitled to\r\npossess the whole of the land, which includes the USDA benefits. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 62-3-101 of the South Carolina Code (2009) states:\r\n\r\n             The power of a person to leave property by will and the\r\n             rights of creditors, devisees, and heirs to his property are\r\n             subject to the restrictions and limitations contained in this\r\n             Code to facilitate the prompt settlement of estates,\r\n             including the exercise of the powers of the [PR]. Upon\r\n             the death of a person, his real property devolves to the\r\n             persons to whom it is devised by his last will or to those\r\n             indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving lapse,\r\n\n             renunciation, or other circumstances affecting the\r\n             devolution of testate estates, or in the absence of\r\n             testamentary disposition, to his heirs, or to those\r\n             indicated as substitutes for them in cases involving\r\n             renunciation or other circumstances affecting the\r\n             devolution of intestate estates, subject to the purpose of\r\n             satisfying claims as to exempt property rights and the\r\n             rights of creditors, and the purposes of administration,\r\n             particularly the exercise of the powers of the [PR] under\r\n             [s]ections 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-711, and his\r\n             personal property devolves, first, to his [PR], for the\r\n             purpose of satisfying claims as to exempt property rights\r\n             and the rights of creditors, and the purposes of\r\n             administration, particularly the exercise of the powers of\r\n             the [PR] under [s]ections 62-3-709, 62-3-710, and 62-3-\r\n             711, and, at the expiration of three years after the\r\n             decedent's death, if not yet distributed by the [PR], his\r\n             personal property devolves to those persons to whom it is\r\n             devised by will or who are his heirs in intestacy, or their\r\n             substitutes, as the case may be, just as with respect to real\r\n             property.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Notwithstanding the immediate passage of title to heirs and\r\ndevisees, the PR is entitled to possession of all real property during administration\r\nand has broad powers over real property during administration. S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n62-3-709 (2009); S.C. Code Ann. § 62-1-201(33) (2009).\r\n\r\nSection 62-3-709 provides in part:\r\n\r\n             Except as otherwise provided by a decedent's will, every\r\n             [PR] has a right to, and shall take possession or control\r\n             of, the decedent's property, except that any real property\r\n             or tangible personal property may be left with or\r\n             surrendered to the person presumptively entitled thereto\r\n             unless or until, in the judgment of the [PR], possession of\r\n             the property by him will be necessary for purposes of\r\n             administration.\r\n\nThe PR does not need to prove to the possessor of estate properties that such\r\nproperties are needed for administration. Id. Section 62-3-709 further provides,\r\n\"The request by a [PR] for delivery of any property possessed by an heir or devisee\r\nis conclusive evidence, in any action against the heir or devisee for possession\r\nthereof, that the possession of the property by the [PR] is necessary for purposes of\r\nadministration.\" This statute imposes upon the PR the responsibility and authority\r\nto \"take all steps reasonably necessary for the management, protection, and\r\npreservation of, the estate in his possession.\" Id.\r\n\r\nSection 62-3-711(a) of the South Carolina Code (2009) outlines the powers of the\r\nPR and states:  Until termination of his appointment or unless\r\n                otherwise provided in Section 62-3-910, a [PR] has\r\n                the same power over the title to property of the estate\r\n                that an absolute owner would have, in trust however,\r\n                for the benefit of the creditors and others interested in\r\n                the estate. Except as otherwise provided in\r\n                subsection (b), this power may be exercised without\r\n                notice, hearing, or order of court.\r\n\r\nThe Reporter's comments to section 62-3-711 note, \"Under this section, [s]ection\r\n62-3-101, and [s]ection 62-3-709, title to personal property (as well as real\r\nproperty) devolves at or soon after death to heirs and devisees, and not to the\r\n[PR].\" The Reporter's comments to section 62-3-709 state:\r\n\r\n             Section 62-3-101 provides that title to real and personal\r\n             property devolves on death or thereafter to heirs or\r\n             devises \"subject . . . to administration.\" Section 62-3-711\r\n             vests in the [PR] a power over title to real and personal\r\n             property during administration. This section deals with\r\n             the [PR]'s duty and right to possess assets, real and\r\n             personal. It proceeds from the assumption that it is\r\n             desirable wherever possible to avoid disruption of the\r\n             possession of the decedent's assets by his heirs or\r\n             devisees. But if the [PR] considers it advisable he may\r\n             take possession and his judgment is made conclusive. It\r\n             is likely that the [PR]'s judgment could be questioned in a\r\n\n             later action but this possibility should not interfere with\r\n             the [PR]'s administrative authority as it relates to\r\n             possession of the estate.\r\n\r\nUnder section 62-3-101, real property immediately passes to the named heirs.\r\nHowever, Emma has the authority as PR to retain the real property under section\r\n62-3-711. Section 62-3-711 states that \"this power may be exercised without\r\nnotice, hearing, or order of court.\" Because Emma retained the authority over the\r\nestate as the PR, the property did not pass to Clyde despite his status as a named\r\nheir in the will. The probate code presents this as an absolute right derived out of\r\nnecessity to manage the estate. Thus, when a PR asserts his or her authority over\r\nthe property, the PR usurps the rights of the heirs regarding the control of the real\r\nproperty while the estate is still being administered. In this case, the estate is still\r\nbeing administered; thus, Emma has the authority to retain and control the property\r\nin her capacity as PR. § 62-3-709; § 62-1-201(33). Emma's right to retain the\r\nauthority over the estate supersedes Clyde's argument that he was acting within his\r\nauthority as a cotenant of Emma's based on his status as an heir.\r\n\r\nClyde also asserts the lease agreement grants him the right to contract with the\r\nUSDA. The lease agreement does not convey the right or express permission to\r\ncontract with the USDA or the authority to sign for the property as the owner of\r\nthe land. Also, on the application for benefits, Clyde noted the estate owned the\r\nland not him as an heir. Without express authority through ownership or contract,\r\nClyde did not have the authority to enter a contractual relationship with the USDA.\r\nTherefore, the master properly determined the USDA benefits belonged to the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nII.   STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS\r\n\r\nClyde argues the master erred in concluding the statute of limitations did not bar\r\nEmma's claim for USDA subsidies. Clyde suggests because Emma became aware\r\nin 2002 that he was receiving subsidies, the statute of limitations began to run upon\r\nEmma's discovery. Thus, allowing recovery based on the amount of payments he\r\nreceived within three years before the action was brought was in error. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\nThe statute of limitations begins to run when a cause of action ought to have\r\nreasonably been discovered. Dean v. Ruscon Corp., 321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645\r\n(1996). In Dean, the supreme court stated:\r\n\r\n             The statute runs from the date the injured party either\r\n             knows or should have known by the exercise of\r\n             reasonable diligence that a cause of action arises from the\r\n             wrongful conduct. We have interpreted the \"exercise of\r\n             reasonable diligence\" to mean that the injured party must\r\n             act with some promptness where the facts and\r\n             circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of\r\n             common knowledge and experience on notice that a\r\n             claim against another party might exist. Moreover, the\r\n             fact that the injured party may not comprehend the full\r\n             extent of the damage is immaterial.\r\n\r\nId. at 363-64, 468 S.E.2d at 647 (citations omitted). \"The date on which discovery\r\nof the cause of action should have been made is an objective, rather than a\r\nsubjective, question.\" Hedgepath v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 348 S.C. 340, 355-57,\r\n559 S.E.2d 327, 336 (Ct. App. 2001). \"Reasonable diligence is intrinsically tied to\r\nthe issue of notice.\" Id. In Joubert v. South Carolina Department of Social\r\nServices, the court explained, \"We have interpreted the 'exercise of reasonable\r\ndiligence' to mean that the injured party must act with some promptness where the\r\nfacts and circumstances of an injury place a reasonable person of common\r\nknowledge and experience on notice that a claim against another party might\r\nexist.\" 341 S.C. 176, 191, 534 S.E.2d 1, 8 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Dean, 321\r\nS.C. at 364, 468 S.E.2d at 647).\r\n\r\nNo direct case law discusses USDA benefits and statute of limitations in this\r\ncontext in South Carolina. However, our courts have examined the role of the\r\nstatute of limitations in other settings. In the insurance context, the general rule is\r\nthe renewal of a policy of insurance for a fixed term is in effect a new contract and\r\nmust contain all the essential elements of a valid contract. Knight v. State Farm\r\nMut. Auto. Ins. Co., 297 S.C. 20, 22-23, 374 S.E.2d 520, 522 (Ct. App. 1988).\r\nThis is true even though the parties' renewal contract continues to enforce the terms\r\nof the expiring contract and no new policy of insurance is issued. Id. The\r\nexception to the general rule is when the renewal is consummated in pursuance of\r\n\na provision in the expiring policy. Id. In such instance, the renewal is an extension\r\nof the old contract. Id.\r\n\r\nThe supreme court has held that when a nuisance is continuing and the injury is\r\nabatable, the statute of limitations does not run merely from the time of the original\r\nintrusion on the property and cannot be a complete bar. Silvester v. Spring Valley\r\nCountry Club, 344 S.C. 280, 287, 543 S.E.2d 563, 567 (Ct. App. 2001). Rather, a\r\nnew statute of limitations begins to run after each separate invasion of the property.\r\nId.; see Cutchin v. S. C. Dep't of Highways & Pub. Transp., 301 S.C. 35, 37, 389\r\nS.E.2d 646, 648 (1990) (stating if the injury is permanent, the plaintiff has a single\r\ncause of action that cannot be split; however, if the cause of the injury is abatable,\r\neach injury gives rise to a new cause of action (citing Webb v. Greenwood Cnty.,\r\n229 S.C. 267, 277, 92 S.E.2d 688, 692 (1956))).\r\n\r\nThe master properly determined the statute of limitations was not a complete bar\r\non the USDA benefits. Similar to the supreme court and this court's rulings in\r\nother statute of limitations cases, because each application with the USDA was for\r\na fixed duration, it required a separate renewal each year and the benefit was\r\ncontingent upon an offer and acceptance by the USDA. Therefore, the master\r\nproperly determined the statute of limitations was not an absolute bar on Emma's\r\nrights to collect on a portion of the USDA benefits.\r\n\r\nThis action was commenced in 2006. Under section 15-3-530, any claim between\r\n2000 to 2002 would be barred by the three-year statute of limitations. The\r\nremaining USDA applications for benefits from 2003 to 2007 were appropriately\r\nbefore the master. Accordingly, we affirm the master's finding the statute of\r\nlimitations was not a complete bar.\r\n\r\nIII.   PARTITION\r\n\r\nEmma argues the master erred in relying on section 15-61-25 of the South Carolina\r\nCode (2009) because this is a partition action brought under section 62-3-911 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), which is contained in the probate code.\r\nEmma contends because the action originated in the probate court, the probate\r\ncode continues to apply to the partition. She suggests the order of priority for\r\nabatement would be ignored by not applying the proper statute. We find the\r\nmaster should have applied the probate code's partition statute.\r\n\nThe master relied on section 15-61-25 in ordering partition of the property, which\r\nstates:      For the purposes of this section, \"joint tenants and tenants\r\n             in common\" include heirs or devisees. Upon the filing of\r\n             a petition for partition of real property owned by joint\r\n             tenants or tenants in common, the court shall provide for\r\n             the nonpetitioning joint tenants or tenants in common\r\n             who are interested in purchasing the property to notify\r\n             the court of that interest no later than ten days prior to the\r\n             date set for the trial of the case. The nonpetitioning joint\r\n             tenants or tenants in common shall be allowed to\r\n             purchase the interests in the property as provided in this\r\n             section whether default has been entered against them or\r\n             not.\r\n\r\nThe probate code's partition statute, contained in section 62-3-911, states:\r\n\r\n             When two or more heirs or devisees are entitled to\r\n             distribution of undivided interests in any personal or real\r\n             property of the estate, the [PR] or one or more of the\r\n             heirs or devisees may petition the court prior to the\r\n             closing of the estate, to make partition. After service of\r\n             summons and petition and after notice to the interested\r\n             heirs or devisees, the court shall partition the property in\r\n             kind if it can be fairly and equitably partitioned in kind.\r\n             If not subject to fair and equitable partition in kind, the\r\n             court shall direct the [PR] to sell the property and\r\n             distribute the proceeds.\r\n\r\nIn Waddell v. Kahdy, 309 S.C. 1, 4, 419 S.E.2d 783, 785 (1992), the supreme court\r\nfound the probate code governs an action when it is moved to circuit court, and\r\nremains primarily within the scope of the probate code. Id. The court under an\r\nassumption that the action was removed pursuant to section 62-1-302 of the South\r\nCarolina Code (1991) based its decision on the fact the action originated in the\r\nprobate court. Waddell, 309 S.C. at 4, 419 S.E.2d at 785. Here, the case was\r\nremoved to circuit court pursuant to section 62-1-302 for the purpose of partition.\r\n\nWhile no case has addressed the application of the revised circuit court statute, we\r\nfind Waddell controlling. Because the action remains primarily an action governed\r\nby the probate code, we find the probate code should have continued to be applied\r\nafter the removal to the master. Waddell, 309 S.C. at 4, 419 S.E.2d at 785.\r\nFurthermore, because a partition statute is provided in the probate code, the master\r\nshould have relied upon that statute in addressing the partition issue. Capco of\r\nSummerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Constr. Co., 368 S.C. 137, 142, 628 S.E.2d 38, 41\r\n(2006) (\"Where there is one statute addressing an issue in general terms and\r\nanother statute dealing with the identical issue in a more specific and definite\r\nmanner, the more specific statute will be considered an exception to, or a qualifier\r\nof, the general statute and given such effect.\"). Therefore, we reverse and remand\r\nthis issue for the master to apply the probate code's statute.\r\n\r\nIV.   EXECUTOR DE SON TORT\r\n\r\nEmma maintains the master erred in allowing Clyde to retain one-half of the value\r\nof the benefits to the estate pursuant to the executor de son tort statute. She argues\r\nthis ruling allows Clyde to retain one-half of the gross value of the estate's\r\nreceivables, which would require her to shoulder the entire burden of the\r\nadministration of the estate. She argues the master erred in concluding Clyde\r\nwould have received half of the USDA subsides. She maintains the estate was\r\nentitled to all of the payments and Clyde's share would be distributed after\r\nadministration of the estate. We agree and find this ruling was premature.\r\n\r\nThe master's finding bypassed the distribution and order of abatement proscribed in\r\nthe probate code; thus awarding one-half of the value of the property was an error\r\nof law. Section 62-3-902 of the South Carolina Code (2009) specifically states the\r\norder of abatement in which testamentary gifts are reduced to pay debts or other\r\nclaims against the estate. By allowing Clyde to retain one-half of the value of the\r\nestate benefits, the master ignored the plain language of the abatement statute and\r\ncompletely disregarded the possibility that the assets of the estate were insufficient\r\nto pay all debts, claims, and devises. Without considering the estate as a whole\r\nfrom the purview of the probate court, there is no conceivable method by which the\r\nmaster could divide the subsidy award in half. Therefore, we reverse and remand\r\nthe master's finding that Clyde was entitled to one-half of the USDA benefits prior\r\nto the estate's distribution pursuant to section 62-3-902.\r\n\r\nV.    TITLE OF PROPERTY\r\n\nEmma maintains the trial court erred in concluding that judgments of an heir-at-\r\nlaw affect the ability of a PR of an open estate to convey good title to real estate.\r\nBased on our determination that this case be reversed to address the partition\r\nstatute and the division of estate property, we need not address this issue. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d\r\n591, 598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not review remaining issues when\r\nits determination of a prior issue is dispositive of the appeal).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on all of the foregoing, the order of the master is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nSHORT and LOCKEMY, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"5079","title":"Barnes v.

Johnson\r\nappeals the award of $75,616.17 to Clyde and Kathy Barnes. We reverse.\r\n\n                      FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY \n\r\n\r\nAppellant James E. Johnson (Johnson) and Respondent Clyde Barnes (Barnes) are\r\ncousins who previously conducted informal business transactions together.1 On\r\nAugust 25, 2003, Johnson purchased an eight-acre tract of property on New Cut\r\nRoad in Spartanburg with a \"dilapidated\" house located on it. Johnson purchased\r\nthe property for $131,733.61; he made a down payment of $30,733.61 and\r\nborrowed $101,000 from BB&T. Two days later, Johnson purchased a \"fire\r\npolicy\" from Nationwide Insurance Company, insuring the house from loss due to\r\nfire and lightning. The policy listed Johnson as the named-insured of the tenant-\r\noccupied home and BB&T as the mortgagee.\r\n\r\nConcurrent with Johnson acquiring the real property, Clyde and Kathy Barnes\r\nwere living in Florida and looking for a Spartanburg-area home. Seeing an\r\nopportunity for mutual benefit with a previous business partner, Johnson and\r\nBarnes agreed that Barnes would, with the intent and possibility of later purchasing\r\nthe property from Johnson: (1) move to the Spartanburg property; (2) pay for all\r\nmaintenance, repairs, taxes, insurance, utilities, and the related mortgage in\r\nJohnson's name; (3) improve the home and surrounding acreage, at Barnes'\r\ndiscretion and own expense;2 and (4) be able to purchase the home from Johnson if\r\nBarnes obtained his own financing. Beyond these general conditions, fundamental\r\nterms of their agreement, such as timing, pricing, and even repayment terms, were\r\nunclear.3 In fact, the trial court expressly found \"[t]he parties in their testimony\r\ndisagree as to how the financial arrangements should be handled and as to the\r\nexact terms of their agreement.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Both Clyde and Kathy Barnes are Respondents. Hereinafter, we refer to both\r\nRespondents as \"Barnes.\"\r\n2 Notably, the property was then in \"very bad condition\" and required considerable\r\nrenovation; over about approximately one year beginning in September 2003,\r\nBarnes cleaned and painted the house, and replaced doors, carpeting, the air\r\nconditioning unit, and the hot water heater. Barnes also constructed a barn and\r\ninstalled a fence on the premises, which he subsequently dismantled and partially\r\nrecouped.\r\n3 The trial court's order recognized that both parties agreed \"they entered into an\r\noral agreement the intention of which was that Barnes could move into the house\r\nand occupy the real property.\" However, the court also found that beyond this\r\ngeneral arrangement, the record is unclear \"as to how the financial arrangements\r\nshould be handled and as to the exact terms of their agreement.\"\r\n\nThe record also reflects testimony alluding to another, related agreement. Barnes\r\ntestified about an understanding \"to sell the property [to a third party], repay\r\nJohnson his portion of the proceeds as far as what he invested in the property, and\r\nsplit the profit.\" Barnes further described this understanding as an agreement to\r\n\"split the money.\" The record, however, is unclear whether the referenced \"profit\"\r\nconsisted of capital gains or proceeds of the sale, i.e., \"split the money,\" and\r\nwhether certain previous contributions (down payments, principal payments, on\r\nthe mortgage, etc.) should be excluded from, or otherwise accounted for within,\r\nany such \"profit\" calculations. Thus, agreements allegedly existed to either: (1)\r\nsell the property to Barnes, whereby he would directly benefit from his related\r\nimprovements; or (2) sell the property to a third-party with Barnes and Johnson\r\nsplitting any \"profits.\" Based upon these understandings, Barnes and his wife\r\ninitially made improvements, beginning in September 2003, and later inhabited the\r\ndwelling in 2004.\r\n\r\nIn July 2005, while Barnes was in arrears as to both utility bills and payments on\r\nthe mortgage in Johnson's name, a medical emergency necessitated the Barneses'\r\nreturn to Florida. While the home was unoccupied, on July 23, 2005, lightning\r\nstruck and burned the home beyond repair. Upon finding the home's charred\r\nremnants, Barnes retrieved a stove and refrigerator from the debris, removed the\r\nfencing, and dismantled the barn he built upon the property.\r\n\r\nThereafter, on October 11, 2005, Johnson used $92,332.12, taken from the $95,000\r\nin insurance proceeds paid to Johnson as the named-insured, to pay off his\r\nmortgage held by BB&T. Three days later, Johnson sold the property to Michael\r\nMcDonald and Jed Aho for $136,000. Johnson did not remit any of these\r\ngenerated funds to Barnes.\r\n\r\nOn June 19, 2006, Barnes filed this action against Johnson alleging breach of\r\ncontract, conversion, unjust enrichment and quasi contract, and promissory\r\nestoppel. Johnson counterclaimed, contending Barnes: (1) was a tenant who had\r\nabandoned the property in July 2005—then $2,618.79 in arrears as to rent\r\npayments and $470.32 behind on utility bills; and (2) owed Johnson $45,000 for\r\nthe dismantled and removed barn. Barnes responded that Johnson's counterclaims\r\nwere barred by \"unclean hands, laches, and estoppel.\" Prior to trial, however,\r\nBarnes withdrew the breach of contract action.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court conducted a bench trial on October 6, 2008. At trial, Barnes\r\nproduced receipts for $9,639.59 in materials purchased to improve the home and\r\n\nproperty. Barnes also asserted he spent approximately $22,000 in building the\r\nbarn, which he later dismantled and partially removed.\r\n\r\nThe trial court concluded that Barnes established the promissory estoppel and\r\nunjust enrichment claims against Johnson.4 As to the trial court's finding that\r\npromissory estoppel existed, this conclusion only related to the parties' initial\r\nagreement that Barnes could live in the house with the possibility of later\r\npurchasing the home from Johnson if Barnes obtained adequate financing. The\r\ntrial court did not address whether promissory estoppel existed due to any\r\nreasonable reliance and subsequent damages related to the parties' second\r\nagreement−selling the home to a third party and splitting the profits.\r\n\r\nThe trial court awarded Barnes damages of $75,616.17. The trial court\r\nsubsequently denied Johnson's motions for a new trial, or alternatively, to alter or\r\namend the judgment. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                              ISSUES ON APPEAL\r\n\r\nI.

Unjust Enrichment and Quantum Meruit\r\n\r\nJohnson contends the trial court erred in finding Barnes was entitled to damages,\r\nunder a theory of quantum meruit, because Barnes \"conferred no benefit to\r\n[Johnson] who recognized no benefit and did not retain any benefit.\" We agree.\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court explained that quantum meruit is a remedy for\r\nunjust enrichment:\r\n\r\n            This Court has recognized quantum meruit as an\r\n            equitable doctrine to allow recovery for unjust\r\n            enrichment. Absent an express contract, recovery under\r\n            quantum meruit is based on quasi-contract, the elements\r\n            of which are: (1) a benefit conferred upon the defendant\r\n            by the plaintiff; (2) realization of that benefit by the\r\n            defendant; and (3) retention by the defendant of the\r\n            benefit under conditions that make it unjust for him to\r\n            retain it without paying its value.\r\n\r\nColumbia Wholesale Co. v.

App. 1984) (confining the monetary value of a defendant's unjust\r\nenrichment to the increase in market value of the defendant's real property brought\r\nabout by the plaintiff's efforts).\r\n\r\nIn his brief, Johnson asserts:\r\n\r\n             Nothing in the record supports any claim by the Barnes\r\n             that this increase in value [$4,266.39] was due to their\r\n             efforts. The barn built by the Barnes was torn down by\r\n             the new owners and given to the Barnes to remove. The\r\n             fences were taken down and also given to the Barnes to\r\n             remove. In conclusion, the record is bare of any\r\n             improvements upon which a value has been placed and\r\n             the lack of any such value leaves the Court to simply\r\n             speculate.\r\n\r\nWe agree with Johnson's assertion that Barnes failed to introduce evidence\r\nshowing that his efforts increased the market value of Johnson's property.\r\n\r\nJohnson neither benefited from, nor was enriched by, Barnes' work to improve\r\nJohnson's property. Although the parties agreed that Barnes would move onto the\r\nproperty and make improvements, the fire consumed any then-existing potential\r\nbenefit to Johnson that was attributable to Barnes' efforts. Furthermore, Barnes\r\ndoes not claim that Johnson's receipt of insurance proceeds of $95,000 was in any\r\nway related to Barnes' efforts to improve the property: the home was insured by\r\nJohnson before Barnes began making repairs; Johnson was the named-insured; the\r\nfire was an unanticipated event; Johnson was the policy holder and BB&T was\r\nlisted on the policy as the mortgagee. \"The authorities generally agree that a\r\ncontract of fire insurance is a personal contract between the insurer and insured, by\r\nwhich the former undertakes to indemnify the latter for the loss he sustains by\r\nfire.\" Steinmeyer v. Steinmeyer, 64 S.C. 413, 420, 42 S.E. 184, 186 (1902).\r\n\nAdditionally, after the fire the then-empty land sold for $136,000, an amount just\r\nabove its previous purchase price with the dilapidated home of $131,733.61. This\r\nprovides further support that Barnes' efforts did not benefit Johnson. This modest\r\nincrease in selling price did not result from Barnes' labors; rather, it is a corollary\r\nto the modest inflation the trial court found existed within the surrounding area.\r\nBoth sales involved: (1) a property without an immediately inhabitable dwelling,\r\nand (2) the difference in price being accounted for by inflation in the land's\r\ninherent value. Finally, construction of the barn, by Barnes, did not enrich\r\nJohnson. Barnes dismantled the entire barn and salvaged a portion of the\r\nstructure's materials.\r\n\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, Barnes failed to show any conferred benefit\r\nunjustly enriching Johnson. Accordingly, the trial court erred in awarding\r\nrecovery under a theory of quantum meruit.\r\n\r\nII.   Promissory Estoppel\r\n\r\nJohnson also contends the trial court erred in finding Barnes successfully\r\nestablished the elements to recover under promissory estoppel. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina first used the term \"promissory estoppel\" in\r\n1981. Higgins Constr. Co. v. S. Bell Tel. & Tel. Co., 276 S.C. 663, 665-66, 281\r\nS.E.2d 469, 470 (1981).5 In Higgins, the court explained the doctrine of\r\npromissory estoppel, stating:\r\n\r\n             [A]n estoppel may arise from the making of a promise,\r\n             even though without consideration, if it was intended that\r\n             the promise should be relied upon and in fact it was\r\n             relied upon, and if a refusal to enforce it would be\r\n             virtually to sanction the perpetration of fraud or would\r\n             result in other injustice.\r\n\r\n276 S.C. at 665, 281 S.E.2d at 470.\r\n\r\n5The court pointed out, however, that the doctrine of promissory estoppel had been\r\napplied in Furman University v. Waller, 124 S.C. 68, 117 S.E. 356 (1923). There,\r\nWaller had pledged $10,000 to Furman University's capital campaign. In reliance\r\non the pledges received, Furman constructed a dormitory. Id. at 73, 117 S.E. at\r\n358. The court held that Waller's estate was estopped from refusing to fulfill the\r\npledge. Id. at 86-88, 117 S.E. 363-64.\r\n\nUnder the Higgins case and its progeny, the party asserting promissory estoppel\r\nmust demonstrate: (1) a promise with unambiguous terms; (2) reasonable reliance\r\nupon the unambiguous promise; (3) foreseeability of the promisee's reliance; and\r\n(4) injury sustained in relying on the promise because of the promisor's\r\ninconsistent disposition. Id.; Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist. 50, 365 S.C. 629, 634,\r\n620 S.E.2d 65, 67 (2005). Notably, neither meeting of the minds nor consideration\r\nis a necessary element. Satcher v. Satcher, 351 S.C. 477, 484, 570 S.E.2d 535, 538\r\n(Ct. App. 2002). Thus, in the interest of equity, the doctrine \"looks at a promise,\r\nits subsequent effect on the promisee,\" and where appropriate \"bars the promisor\r\nfrom making an inconsistent disposition of the property.\" Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAlthough promissory estoppel is a flexible doctrine that aims to achieve equitable\r\nresults, it, like all creatures of equity, has limitations. See Craft v. S.C. Comm'n for\r\nBlind, 385 S.C. 560, 568, 685 S.E.2d 625, 629 (Ct. App. 2009) (withholding the\r\nequitable remedy from an injury independent from the promisor's inconsistent\r\ndisposition); Rushing v. McKinney, 370 S.C. 280, 295, 633 S.E.2d 917, 925 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006) (holding absence of clearly articulated terms between parties precludes\r\nrecovery in promissory estoppel). Specifically, the doctrine's elements represent a\r\nbalancing between affording a remedy where contract law cannot, and ensuring the\r\ndoctrine's application is not, itself, an inequity against the party estopped. See\r\nSatcher, 351 S.C. at 484, 570 S.E.2d at 538-39 (reasoning even absent a meeting of\r\nthe minds and exchanged consideration, sufficient proof for enforcement still exists\r\nif there is an unambiguous promise, reasonable reliance, foreseeability, and related\r\ninjury); see e.g., Craft, 385 S.C. at 564-68, 685 S.E.2d at 627-29 (refusing to apply\r\npromissory estoppel to remedy an injury occurring after a blind vendor's reliance\r\nupon an unambiguous promise, because the complained of harm resulted\r\nindependently from the promisor's inconsistent disposition).\r\n\r\nTo this end, and particularly because promissory estoppel applies without a\r\ncontract, the promise to be enforced must be unambiguous with clearly articulated,\r\ndefinite terms, while the sustained injury must result from an inconsistent\r\ndisposition by the promisor. See Craft, 385 S.C. at 568, 685 S.E.2d at 629)\r\n(holding an injury that would have occurred independent of any inconsistent\r\ndisposition is beyond promissory estoppel's reach); Rushing, 370 S.C. at 295, 633\r\nS.E.2d at 925 (holding that an agreement with unclear terms was ambiguous);\r\nSatcher, 351 S.C. at 483-84, 570 S.E.2d at 538-39 (refusing to apply promissory\r\nestoppel where the promise was unclear and lacked details). Therefore, the\r\npresence of either an ambiguous promise or an injury not arising out of the\r\ninconsistent disposition precludes promissory estoppel's application, though\r\n\nperceived inequities may exist. See Craft, 385 S.C. at 568, 685 S.E.2d at 629\r\n(denying recovery in promissory estoppel for blind vendor who failed to\r\ndemonstrate injury in reliance upon a promise with a later inconsistent disposition);\r\nSatcher, 351 S.C. at 486-87, 570 S.E.2d at 540 (finding a promise without details\r\nambiguous, despite evidence of \"some agreement regarding [the deceased\r\ngrandfather's intent to transfer farmland to his grandson]\"); cf. Davis, 365 S.C. at\r\n634-35, 620 S.E.2d at 68 (precluding recovery in promissory estoppel, despite\r\nteachers' reliance upon superintendent's promise of an incentive payment because\r\nthe payment was conditioned on the school board's approval). Thus, promissory\r\nestoppel has broad applicability to prevent injustice, but where a promise is unclear\r\nor the alleged harms are unconnected to the inconsistent disposition, the doctrine\r\ndoes not risk imposing its own inequity against the party sought to be estopped.\r\n\r\nConsistent with these principles, promissory estoppel is inapplicable to any\r\nagreement related to either Barnes' potential purchase of the home (the first alleged\r\npromise), or the cousins splitting profits upon sale of the property to a third party\r\n(the second alleged promise).6 Both alleged promises include significant\r\nambiguities related to key terms and, thus, lack promissory estoppel's requisite\r\nclarity, definiteness, and specificity. Additionally, Barnes' complained-of injury is\r\nindependent from the alleged inconsistent disposition of the property and,\r\ntherefore, not sustained in reliance upon any alleged promise. Either of these two\r\nfindings alone precludes a remedy in promissory estoppel. We now address the\r\npresence of ambiguity and lack of an inconsistent disposition causing injury.\r\n\r\n      A.     Ambiguity\r\n\r\nBecause one may properly invoke promissory estoppel absent elements typically\r\nrequired for a contract, such as a meeting of the minds or exchanged consideration,\r\nthe doctrine still requires, by clear and convincing evidence, a \"promise\r\nunambiguous in its terms.\" See Satcher, 351 S.C. at 483-87, 570 S.E.2d at 538-40\r\n(holding an unclear agreement that lacked details was not shown by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence to be unambiguous); Rushing, 370 S.C. at 295, 633 S.E.2d at\r\n925 (holding that an agreement was ambiguous and not enforceable under\r\npromissory estoppel because the party seeking enforcement of the promise \"could\r\n\r\n6 The trial court specifically based its finding of promissory estoppel upon the first\r\nalleged promise. Nonetheless, the trial court based its damages calculations upon\r\nthe \"increase in the value of the property\" \"attributable to [Barnes'] improvements,\"\r\na factor more relevant to the second alleged promise.\r\n\nnot clearly articulate [its] terms\"). This necessity for unambiguous terms, in the\r\nabsence of a contract, reflects balancing the availability of an equitable remedy\r\nwith ensuring the remedy's appropriate application. See Satcher, 351 S.C. at 483-\r\n84, 570 S.E.2d at 538-39 (stating promissory estoppel requires \"a promise\r\nunambiguous in its terms\" and \"[u]nlike a contract, which requires a meeting of the\r\nminds and consideration, promissory estoppel looks at a promise [and] its\r\nsubsequent effect on the promisee\").\r\n\r\nConsistent with this balancing of interests and the lack of a contract specifically\r\ndefining the agreement, an inability \"to clearly articulate the terms of [an] alleged\r\noral contract,\" including how an existing \"capital contribution\" would be treated\r\nand specifically how the parties \"would settle up,\" renders an agreement\r\nambiguous. Rushing, 370 S.C. at 295, 633 S.E.2d at 925; see Satcher, 351 S.C. at\r\n487, 570 S.E.2d at 540 (finding, despite testimony that some agreement existed, an\r\nunclear, unspecific promise to be ambiguous); see also 28 Am. Jur. 2d Estoppel\r\nand Waiver § 52 (2011) (\"The promise must be clear and unambiguous and\r\nsufficiently specific so that the judiciary can understand the obligation assumed\r\nand enforce the promise according to its terms.\").\r\n\r\nWe find the first alleged promise, whereby Johnson would sell the property to\r\nBarnes subsequent to Barnes first procuring his own financing, is ambiguous.\r\nInitially, clear and convincing evidence of the selling price does not exist. In\r\nBarnes' own attempts to arrange financing, even he was unsure how much principal\r\nhe needed to borrow to effectuate the purchase; Barnes told the banker, \"you'll\r\nhave to ask [Johnson] assuming that, a hundred thousand.\" Additionally, in\r\nresponse to questioning at trial about the agreed purchase price and related terms,\r\nBarnes further testified that he \"assumed a hundred thousand dollars,\" in the form\r\nof loan proceeds, plus forty-thousand dollars to be paid \"whenever [he] could.\"\r\nEven if not controverted, such testimony does not evidence a clearly articulated\r\nand specific promise unambiguous in its terms. Furthermore, while Johnson does\r\nconcede that Barnes could have purchased the home from him if Barnes had\r\nobtained sufficient financing, Johnson also asserted that he never gave Barnes a\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the lack of a definite selling price, uncertainty surrounds other key\r\nterms of the agreement. The record also never clearly reveals how or when Barnes\r\nintended to repay Johnson's prior capital contributions; when the record does\r\ngenerally refer to these critical terms, the references are entirely based upon\r\nassumption.\r\n\nAlthough it does appear a general understanding existed that Barnes could\r\npurchase the home, clear and convincing evidence of several key terms was never\r\nclearly articulated by Barnes. Interestingly, even the trial court recognized the\r\nrecord's significant uncertainty and \"disagree[ment] as to how the financial\r\narrangements should be handled and as to the exact terms of the agreement,\" a\r\nfinding incompatible with the court's subsequent award based upon a theory of\r\npromissory estoppel.7\r\n\r\nWe find the record does not reflect an unambiguous promise by Johnson that\r\nBarnes could purchase the home. See Rushing, 370 S.C. at 295, 633 S.E.2d at 925\r\n(holding an agreement ambiguous because the party seeking enforcement of the\r\npromise \"could not clearly articulate [its] terms\"); Satcher, 351 S.C. at 486-87, 570\r\nS.E.2d at 540 (finding an unclear promise without details to be ambiguous, despite\r\ntestimony of \"some agreement regarding [disposition of the subject property]\").\r\nBecause the first alleged promise is ambiguous, promissory estoppel is an\r\nunavailable remedy. See Rushing, 370 S.C. at 295, 633 S.E.2d at 925 (holding an\r\nagreement with terms not clearly articulated is not enforceable through promissory\r\nestoppel).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, significant ambiguity exists regarding the potentially contingent, second\r\nalleged promise that Barnes and Johnson would sell the property to a third party\r\nand thereafter split any resulting profits. Regarding this alleged promise, Barnes\r\ntestified that he would \"give a hundred for it,\" \"put 40,000 down, and whenever we\r\nsell it, we'll split whatever profits that we get.\" It is entirely unclear whether this\r\nsecond alleged promise is contingent upon completion of the first alleged promise,\r\ni.e., Barnes' purchase of the home with a subsequent resale to a third party, or\r\nwhether it was a potential course of action completely independent from a prior\r\npurchase by Barnes. In fact, the trial court's specific findings of fact made no\r\nmention of this promise existing as either an independent promise or as a corollary\r\nto the first alleged promise.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, at no point is \"profit,\" a key term of this second alleged promise,\r\ndefinite. It is unclear whether profit is to be based upon Johnson's original cost and\r\ndown payment, whether Johnson's returns would be reduced by any improvements\r\nBarnes made, whether Barnes' initial payments on Johnson's loan balance\r\nincreased Barnes' share of the profits, or whether Barnes' cost-basis, assuming he\r\n\r\n7The trial court's specific findings of fact as to the alleged agreement's terms did\r\nnot include key terms such as purchase price or repayment conditions.\r\n\ndid first purchase the home, applied to determining total profit and each party's\r\nrespective share. Given the paucity of evidence on this issue, as well as the\r\nvagueness and indeterminate nature of what little evidence does exist, the record\r\ndoes not clearly articulate the alleged second promise to sell the property to a third\r\nparty and split any generated profits. Thus, even if a general understanding to sell\r\nthe property to a third party did loosely exist, the second alleged promise's context\r\nand central terms are either ambiguous or entirely undefined. Such uncertainty\r\nrenders judicial enforcement of the second alleged promise inappropriate. See\r\nSatcher, 351 S.C. at 483-87, 570 S.E.2d at 538-40 (holding an unclear agreement is\r\nnot enforceable through promissory estoppel).\r\n\r\nBecause key terms requisite to bringing either alleged promise within the scope of\r\npromissory estoppel are absent, indefinite, or unclear within the record, we hold\r\nboth alleged promises were ambiguous and, thus, unenforceable.\r\n\r\n      B.     Injury In Reliance\r\n\r\nThe final element of promissory estoppel requires demonstrating that the\r\nreasonably relying promisee sustains injury due to a disposition inconsistent with\r\nalleged promise. Craft, 385 S.C. at 568, 685 S.E.2d at 629; Satcher, 351 S.C. at\r\n484-85, 570 S.E.2d at 538. Because the doctrine only applies when the promisor's\r\ninconsistent disposition harms the promisee, the doctrine does not insure the\r\npromisee against all potential external forces acting against the promisee's interest\r\nor guarantee realization of an agreement's benefit. See Craft, 385 S.C. at 567-68,\r\n685 S.E.2d at 629 (holding where a promisee reasonably and foreseeably relies\r\nupon an unambiguous promise, but where the alleged injuries are not caused by the\r\npromisor's inconsistent disposition, promissory estoppel does not exist). In order\r\nto demonstrate that the injury was sustained in reliance upon an alleged promise,\r\nthe promisee must show, but for the promisor's inconsistent disposition, the\r\ncomplained-of injury would not have otherwise resulted. See id. (holding\r\npromissory estoppel is not appropriate when the complained-of harm does not\r\nresult from the promisor's inconsistent disposition).\r\n\r\nFor instance, in Craft, this court found promissory estoppel inapplicable to a\r\nvendor's claim for loss of existing employment, which occurred after the vendor\r\nquit his job in reasonable reliance upon an offer of new employment that never\r\nmaterialized. Id. There, a canteen vendor, licensed through the Commission for\r\nthe Blind (Commission), worked at Greenville County Square. Id. at 563, 685\r\nS.E.2d at 626. Upon learning more desirable vending sites were available through\r\nthe Commission, the vendor submitted his bid for a new location. Id. In reliance\r\n\nupon his bid's subsequent acceptance, the vendor resigned from his County Square\r\nposition. Id. at 563, 685 S.E.2d at 626-27. However, the Commission's contract to\r\noperate the new location subsequently fell through; thus, the vendor was unable to\r\nwork the new location. Id. at 563-64, 685 S.E.2d at 626-27. Moreover, Greenville\r\nCounty had since closed County Square's canteen. Id. at 563, 685 S.E.2d at 627-\r\n29. The vendor then sued the Commission, alleging the Commission's promise of\r\nnew employment reasonably induced him to leave his job at County Square,\r\ncausing his loss of employment at County Square. Id. at 565-68, 685 S.E.2d at\r\n627-29. Although the vendor did reasonably leave County Square in anticipation\r\nof an unambiguous agreement, this court concluded the vendor did not\r\n\"demonstrate that he sustained injury . . . in reliance on the Commission's\r\npromise\"; he could no longer work there for reasons beyond the Commission's\r\ncontrol, and, thus, his unemployed status was not due to the Commission's\r\ninconsistent disposition. Id. at 568, 685 S.E.2d at 629.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the home at issue in the present matter no longer existed following the\r\nfire and, thus, as in Craft, an external factor, and not any alleged inconsistent\r\ndisposition, caused the complained-of injury. In fact, the injury claimed by Barnes\r\nis even less connected to the alleged inconsistent disposition than was the\r\ncomplained-of injury in Craft.\r\n\r\nPrior to Johnson selling the then-unimproved property to a third party, an act of\r\nnature had already frustrated both alleged mutual agreements. Barnes could no\r\nmore live in the then-scorched home than could his previous efforts in improving\r\nthe home later contribute to the unimproved land's value at sale to a third party.8\r\nConsequently, the fire caused Barnes' injury. Therefore, as in Craft, the promisor's\r\nactions did not harm the reasonably relying promisee. Because Johnson's sale\r\n(alleged inconsistent disposition) of the property did not injure Barnes, Barnes\r\nnecessarily cannot demonstrate any sustained injury in reliance on the alleged\r\nagreements. Thus, despite Barnes' sympathetic situation, promissory estoppel is an\r\ninapplicable remedy.\r\n\r\nIn summation, Barnes failed to demonstrate either an unambiguous promise or an\r\ninjury sustained in reliance upon such a promise. The absence of either showing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8 The trial court found Barnes' efforts \"increase[d] the value of the property\" at sale\r\nto the third party. Any improvements made by Barnes, however, were either\r\ndestroyed by fire or disassembled by Barnes for removal.\r\n\nprecludes recovery by Barnes in promissory estoppel. Accordingly, the trial court\r\nerred in ordering recovery under a theory of promissory estoppel.9\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, the decision of the circuit court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \n\r\n\r\nHUFF and THOMAS, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9In view of our disposition of this case, we need not address appellant's remaining\r\narguments.
