Â Ettel\r\n  had known the victim on a casual basis for two months prior to the attack as he\r\n  frequented a club where she worked as a bartender.Â  The night of the attack,\r\n  Ettel told the victim he was too intoxicated to drive home and asked her for a\r\n  ride to his apartment.Â  Once she entered his apartment, Ettel forced her onto\r\n  the couch and stated he would cut her into pieces if she did not remain\r\n  silent.Â  Ettel drove the victim back to his car the next morning after she told\r\n  him she would not tell the police.Â   \r\nBefore Ettelâ€™s release from prison for the criminal\r\n  sexual conduct conviction, the State filed a petition for Ettelâ€™s civil\r\n  commitment pursuant to the Sexually Violent Predator Act[1] (SVP Act).Â  The circuit court found probable cause to believe Ettel was a\r\n  sexually violent predator and ordered a probable cause hearing.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, the circuit court ordered Ettel to undergo a psychiatric evaluation,\r\n  which was performed by Dr. Pamela Crawford, M.D., (Dr. Crawford) a forensic\r\n  psychiatrist with the Department of Mental Health.Â Â   \r\nDuring Dr. Crawfordâ€™s interview\r\n  with Ettel, Ettel admitted to three sexual offenses that did not result in\r\n  convictions.Â  The first offense occurred when Ettel worked at an appliance\r\n  store in Michigan and grabbed a customerâ€™s breasts and attempted to kiss her.Â \r\n  He was charged with assault and intent to commit gross indecency and\r\n  kidnapping, but he was found not guilty.Â  The second offense pertained to an\r\n  incident when Ettel kidnapped a hitchhiker in Montana, took her to his house\r\n  against her will, and tried to grope her breasts.Â  He was charged with sexual\r\n  misconduct, but the charges were subsequently dropped.Â  The third offense\r\n  occurred at an animal hospital in Montana when Ettel attempted to sexually\r\n  assault a woman who worked at the hospital.Â  He was charged with sexual intercourse\r\n  without consent, but these charges were dropped when he was extradited to South Carolina for the sexual assault on the bartender.Â  Based on Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  evaluation, she concluded Ettel suffered from the mental abnormality of\r\n  paraphilia, not otherwise specified, and had a history of extreme violence,\r\n  which made it likely he would engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined\r\n  for long-term control, care, and treatment under the SVP Act.Â   \r\nBefore trial, Ettelâ€™s counsel moved to exclude any\r\n  testimony regarding the sexual offenses that did not result in convictions as\r\n  well as evidence regarding Ettelâ€™s prior murder conviction.[2]Â \r\n  Dr. Crawford testified in camera about the evidence supporting\r\n  her opinion, and the circuit court denied Ettelâ€™s motion to exclude the\r\n  evidence.Â  At trial, Dr. Crawford testified about her conclusions from Ettelâ€™s\r\n  evaluation and discussed the disputed evidence to support her findings.Â  Based\r\n  on the evidence, the jury found Ettel satisfied the definition of a sexually\r\n  violent predator, and Ettel was sentenced to long-term commitment under the SVP\r\n  Act.Â   \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nEttel claims the circuit court committed\r\n  reversible error when it permitted Dr. Crawford to testify about his previous\r\n  sexual offenses that did not result in convictions and his previous murder\r\n  conviction.Â  Ettel claims the prejudicial effect of the evidence substantially\r\n  outweighed its probative value.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe admission of evidence is within\r\n  the discretion of the circuit court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Â In re Corley, 353 S.C. 202, 205, 577 S.E.2d 451, 453\r\n  (2003). Â Generally, all relevant evidence is admissible. Â Rule 402, SCRE; State\r\n    v. Pittman, 373 S.C. 527, 578, 647 S.E.2d 144, 170 (2007).Â  Evidence is\r\n  relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in\r\n  controversy. Â Rule 401, SCRE. Â However, relevant evidence may be excluded if\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative value. Â Rule\r\n  403, SCRE.\r\nUnder the SVP Act, a sexually violent predator is\r\n  defined as a person who (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense\r\n  and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes\r\n  the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a\r\n  secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment. Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-48-30(1)(a), (b) (Supp. 2007).\r\nAfter the State files a petition to\r\n  request a probable cause hearing, the circuit court must make a probable cause\r\n  determination as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-70, -80(A) (Supp. 2007).Â  If the probable cause\r\n  determination is made, the person must undergo an evaluation by a\r\n  court-approved expert as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(D) (Supp. 2007).Â  Experts are allowed to have\r\n  â€œreasonable access to the person for the purpose of the examination, as well as\r\n  access to all relevant medical, psychological, criminal offense,\r\n  and disciplinary records and reports.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2007) (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nThese offenses can include both\r\n  convictions and offenses not resulting in convictions as long as they are\r\n  relevant to the determination of whether a person is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  See White v. State, 375 S.C. 1, 9, 649 S.E.2d 172, 176\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007) (holding past convictions and prior offenses not resulting in\r\n  convictions that bear on whether a person is a sexually violent predator are\r\n  admissible in a SVP case).Â  Because a â€œpersonâ€™s dangerous propensities are the\r\n  focus of the SVP Act,â€ consideration of â€œ[p]ast criminal history is therefore\r\n  directly relevant to establishing 44-48-30(1)(a),â€ which in turn bears directly\r\n  on whether one suffers from a mental abnormality under section 44-48-30(1)(b).Â  In re Corley, 353 S.C. at 206-07, 577 S.E.2d at 453-54.Â  \r\n \r\nThe circuit court properly admitted Dr. Crawfordâ€™s\r\n  testimony regarding Ettelâ€™s prior sexual offenses as well as his prior murder\r\n  conviction. Â The prior sexual offenses and the murder conviction were\r\n  relevant because Dr. Crawford relied on them in evaluating Ettelâ€™s need for and\r\n  likelihood of success in treatment as well as his ability to control his\r\n  behavior in the future.Â  See State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557,\r\n  564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (holding admission of motion did not violate\r\n  defendantâ€™s due process rights because it was relevant in evaluating\r\n  defendantâ€™s need for and probability of success in treatment and was not\r\n  unfairly prejudicial as it was one of several sources on which the expert based\r\n  her opinion); see also Rule 401, SCRE (â€œâ€˜Relevant evidenceâ€™ means\r\n  evidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of\r\n  consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable\r\n  than it would be without the evidence.â€).Â   \r\nLooking at Ettelâ€™s prior sexual\r\n  offenses established a â€œpattern of behavior of sexual assaults,â€ and this\r\n  pattern was significant because as Dr. Crawford stated, â€œ[F]uture behavior [can\r\n  only be predicted] based on past behavior.â€Â  Additionally, the murder\r\n  conviction was relevant due to the crimeâ€™s level of violence.Â  Dr. Crawford\r\n  stated, â€œWhether or not [the murder] was a sexual crime . . . it goes to\r\n  [Ettelâ€™s] propensity to commit further violent crimes.â€Â  Based on the\r\n  officersâ€™ recollection of the crimes, Dr. Crawford learned â€œthere may have been\r\n  a sexual motivation in [the] crime,â€ which would aid in her diagnosis. Â Â \r\nFurther, the possibility of unfair\r\n  prejudice did not substantially outweigh the probative value of the testimony. Â Regarding\r\n  its probative value, Dr. Crawford used the information to develop her â€œopinion\r\n  in terms of [Ettel] not being able to control his behaviorâ€ and to diagnose\r\n  Ettel with paraphilia.Â  As for the testimonyâ€™s possible prejudice, the\r\n  prior sexual offenses not resulting in convictions as well as the murder\r\n  conviction were not the only sources of Dr. Crawfordâ€™s diagnosis.Â  Dr. Crawford\r\n  testified that even without considering this evidence, her opinion as to\r\n  whether Ettel had a mental abnormality or personality disorder would not\r\n  change.Â  Dr. Crawford stated she additionally relied on, among other sources,\r\n  Ettelâ€™s past criminal sexual conduct conviction, Ettelâ€™s statements during her\r\n  extensive clinical forensic interviews with him, interviews with individuals\r\n  close to Ettel, administrative records, Ettelâ€™s prior psychological evaluation,\r\n  and his record while in a sex offender treatment program.Â   \r\nBecause Dr. Crawfordâ€™s testimony regarding\r\n  Ettelâ€™s prior sexual offenses not resulting in convictions and previous murder\r\n  conviction was relevant and the probative value outweighed any prejudicial\r\n  effect, the circuit court acted within its discretion and properly admitted the\r\n  testimony.Â  See Gaster, 349 S.C. at 557, 564 S.E.2d at 94 (finding\r\n  disputed evidence was relevant and its probative value outweighed any\r\n  prejudicial effect such that circuit court properly admitted the evidence\r\n  within its discretion).Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s order is\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] \r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Benjamin Aplin, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â  Isiah\r\n  James, Jr. appeals the Administrative Law Courtâ€™s (ALC) dismissal of his appeal\r\n  for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We affirm.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn\r\n  June 18, 1979, James pled guilty to two counts of voluntary manslaughter and\r\n  armed robbery.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to two, thirty-year consecutive\r\n  terms of imprisonment for each count of voluntary manslaughter, and a\r\n  twenty-five-year consecutive term of imprisonment for armed robbery.Â   \r\nJames\r\n  first became eligible for parole in 1988, and the South Carolina Board of\r\n  Probation, Parole and Pardon Services (Board) rejected his application.Â  Over\r\n  the years, the Board rejected Jamesâ€™ parole several more times.Â  In 2005, James\r\n  filed a request for the Board to reconsider his most recent parole rejection.Â \r\n  In this request for reconsideration, James asserted his due process rights were\r\n  violated because only five of the seven board members were present for his\r\n  hearing.Â  The Board denied his request for rehearing, finding â€œthe reasons\r\n  stated in [Jamesâ€™] request did not affect the decision of the Parole Board.â€Â  Thereafter,\r\n  James appealed to the ALC, asserting once more that his due process rights were\r\n  violated.Â  The ALC dismissed his appeal due to a lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSection\r\n  1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) sets forth the standard of\r\n  review when the court of appeals is sitting in review of a decision by the ALC\r\n  on an appeal from an administrative agency.Â  â€œThe review of the administrative\r\n  law judgeâ€™s order must be confined to the record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-23-610(C) (Supp. 2006). Â The court of appeals may reverse or modify the\r\n  decision only if substantive rights of the appellant have been prejudiced\r\n  because the decision is clearly erroneous in light of the reliable and\r\n  substantial evidence on the whole record, arbitrary or otherwise characterized\r\n  by an abuse of discretion, or affected by other error of law.Â  Id.Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nJames argues the ALC erred in dismissing his appeal on the grounds\r\n  that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We agree that the ALC has subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction over all inmate grievances, but also affirm that Jamesâ€™\r\n  appeal should have been dismissed.  \r\nOur supreme court recently offered clarification of Al-Shabazz\r\n  v. State[1] and its progeny as to an ALCâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction in Furtick v.\r\n    South Carolina Department of Corrections, 374 S.C. 334, 649 S.E.2d 35\r\n  (2007).[2] Â In Furtick, the court reemphasized its clarification of jurisdiction in Slezak v. South Carolina Dept. of Corrections, stating â€œthe ALC has\r\n  jurisdiction over all inmate grievance appeals that have been properly\r\n  filed; the ALC however, is not required to hold a hearing in every matter.â€Â  Id. at 340, 649 S.E.2d at 38 (emphasis in original) (explaining Slezak v. South\r\n    Carolina Dept. of Corrections, 361 S.C. 327, 605 S.E.2d 506 (2004)).Â  The\r\n  court continues that the ALC could summarily dismiss any appeal where the\r\n  inmateâ€™s grievance does not implicate a state-created liberty or property\r\n  interest.Â  Id.Â   \r\nAlthough the ALC had subject matter jurisdiction to hear Jamesâ€™\r\n  claim, his appeal does not implicate a state created liberty or property\r\n  interest and therefore dismissal was appropriate.Â  In determining the existence\r\n  of a liberty interest, â€œan inmate has the\r\n  right of review by the [ALC] after the final decision that he is ineligible for parole, but . . . a parole-eligible inmate does not have the same right of\r\n  review after the decision denying parole . . . This distinction stems from the\r\n  fact that parole is a privilege, not a right.â€\r\n  Â Sullivan v. Depâ€™t of Corrections, 355 S.C. 437, 586 S.E.2d 124 n.4 (2003) (emphasis in original). Â In the case before\r\n  us, the Board denied Jamesâ€™ parole, but did not permanently deny his\r\n  eligibility; therefore his grievance does not implicate a liberty or property\r\n  interest.\r\nMoreover, the inquiry into whether an inmate is entitled to review\r\n  of a parole boardâ€™s final decision is based on whether the inmate â€œhas a\r\n  liberty interest in gaining access to the parole board.â€Â  Furtick v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole &amp; Pardon Services., 352 S.C. 594, 598, 576\r\n  S.E.2d 146, 149 (2003).Â  As previously illustrated, Jamesâ€™ appeal does not\r\n  involve any liberty interest, and he consequently has no right to a review of\r\n  the Boardâ€™s decision.  \r\nJames\r\n  next asserts that because the Parole Board conducted its hearing with only five\r\n  of the seven members present and voting, it denied him a right to a hearing\r\n  altogether.Â  We disagree.\r\nJames\r\n  submitted this argument to the ALC on appeal, but the ALCâ€™s order did not\r\n  address the issue in its order.Â  Thereafter, James made no Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion to alter or amend the proposed order, and under this courtâ€™s general\r\n  preservation rules, this argument would not be preserved for our review.Â  See Great Games, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 339 S.C. 79, 529\r\n  S.E.2d 6 (2000) (stating where a party raises an issue, the trial court fails\r\n  to rule upon the issue, and the party fails to raise the courtâ€™s omission by\r\n  way of a Rule 59 motion, the issue is not ruled upon and, therefore, not\r\n  preserved on appeal).Â  We note the issue of whether a Rule 59(e) motion is\r\n  necessary, or even cognizable to an ALC is one that has not been decided in South Carolina.Â  Pursuant to this courtâ€™s request for certification, this precise issue is\r\n  now pending before the South Carolina Supreme Court.Â  Assuming without deciding\r\n  that a Rule 59(e) motion is not necessary to an ALC in order to preserve an\r\n  issue on appeal, and in the interests of judicial economy, we will address the\r\n  merits of Jamesâ€™ contention.\r\nChapter\r\n  21 of Title 24 of the South Carolina Code (2007) provides the statutory framework\r\n  for the Board of Probation, Parole, and Pardon Services.Â  However, Chapter 21\r\n  does not specify the exact number of board members that must be present for a\r\n  parole hearing.Â  The chairperson of the Parole Board may direct the board\r\n  members to meet in three-person panels, and any unanimous vote of a panel is\r\n  considered a final decision of the board.Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-30(A) (2007).Â  In order to grant parole of a violent crime as\r\n  defined in Section 16-1-60, under which Jamesâ€™ guilty pleas to voluntary\r\n  manslaughter and armed robbery fall, a two-thirds majority vote of the full\r\n  board is required.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-30(B) (2007); See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (2007).Â  Conversely, the statute does not require a certain\r\n  number of board members to be present in order to deny parole for someone\r\n  convicted of a violent crime.Â   \r\nâ€œIn\r\n  the absence of any statutory or other controlling provision, the common-law\r\n  rule that a majority of the whole board is necessary to constitute a quorum\r\n  applies, and the board may do no valid act in the absence of a\r\n  quorum.â€Â  Garris v. Governing Bd. of the State Reinsurance Facility, 333\r\n  S.C. 432, 453, 511 S.E.2d 48, 59 (1998).Â  Here, five members of the Board were\r\n  present, and each voted to deny Jamesâ€™ parole.Â  A unanimous and majority\r\n  decision was reached by a quorum in this hearing; thus Jamesâ€™ contention is\r\n  without merit.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough\r\n  we agree the ALC has subject matter jurisdiction over all inmate grievances, no\r\n  liberty interest was implicated in this case and James was not entitled to an\r\n  appeal.Â  Consequently, the ALC did not err in dismissing his case.Â  The ALCâ€™s\r\n  order is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.[3] Â \r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Al-Shabazz\r\n  v.

Terry (Landowner) appeals the decision of the Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Appellate Panel (Appellate Panel) affirming the order of the\r\n  Administrative Law Court (ALC) which upheld the Office of Ocean and Coastal\r\n  Resource Managementâ€™s (OCRM) denial of his application for a recreational dock\r\n  permit.Â  We affirm.  \r\nFACTS\r\nIn June\r\n  1991, Tamsburg Properties (Developer) applied to the Coastal Council for a\r\n  permit to install ten private docks, one community dock, and a community boat\r\n  ramp within Bakers Landing, a proposed residential subdivision in Dorchester County along the shoreline of the Ashley River.[1]Â \r\n  Developerâ€™s application to build multiple docks generated controversy among the\r\n  interested parties, and extensive discussions took place involving OCRM staff,\r\n  Developer, and public agencies.Â  A public hearing on the application was also\r\n  held.Â  During this same time, planning was underway to create a Special Area\r\n  Management Plan (SAMP) to conserve the\r\n  natural and historic character of the Ashley River corridor, an area that now includes\r\n  the Bakers Landing subdivision.Â   \r\nOn February 6, 1992, Coastal Councilâ€™s Permitting Committee issued\r\n  a permit to Developer authorizing installation of eight private docks and one\r\n  community dock.Â  The Coastal Council conditioned the permit upon Developerâ€™s\r\n  agreement to the following conditions: a community boat ramp would not be\r\n  built; the community dock would not be used for permanent moorage; pier heads\r\n  would not be located over wetlands vegetation; and no additional docks or modifications\r\n  to permitted docks would be allowed within the boundaries of the subdivision.Â  Because\r\n  there was no appeal of OCRMâ€™s issuance of this permit to Developer, it became a\r\n  final agency decision.Â   \r\nIn 1998, Landowner purchased a lot in Bakers Landing that bordered\r\n  a tributary of the Ashley River.[2]Â \r\n  In 2002, he applied for a permit to construct a dock.Â  Based on the pre-existing, special conditions permit OCRM issued to Developer in 1992, OCRM denied Landownerâ€™s permit application in a letter dated August 9, 2002, which stated: \r\n \r\n\r\n\tOCRM,\r\n  in its 1991 review of a multiple dock application made by the developers of\r\n  Bakers Landing, Tamsberg Properties (91-3D-185-P), conditionally limited the\r\n  development to 8 private docks and 1 community use dock, to which [D]eveloper\r\n  agreed.Â  The 1991 general dock permit served as the Dock Master Plan for all\r\n  docks within the Bakers Landing Development, and consequently must be used as a\r\n  framework for subsequent permitting decisions.Â  The [Landownerâ€™s] application\r\n  goes against the terms of the [Developerâ€™s] permit and is a piecemeal attempt\r\n  to permit additional docks where OCRM has already acted.Â  Therefore, OCRM staff\r\n  has determined that this application must be denied.\r\n\r\nLandowner requested a contested case hearing before the Administrative\r\n  Law Court (ALC).[3] Â The ALC upheld OCRMâ€™s denial of the permit application, and Landowner appealed\r\n  to the Appellate Panel.Â  The Appellate Panel found no error of law and held\r\n  that substantial evidence in the record supported the ALCâ€™s decision. Â This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD\r\n  OF REVIEW [4]\r\nIn administrative law cases, the ALC serves as the\r\n  fact-finder and is not restricted by the findings of the administrative\r\n  agency.Â  Dorman v. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159,\r\n  164, 565 S.E.2d 119, 122 (Ct. App. 2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-600(A)-(B)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  An aggrieved party may appeal the ALCâ€™s decision to the agencyâ€™s\r\n  Appellate Panel; however, the Panelâ€™s review is confined to the record and is\r\n  governed by South Carolina Code section 1-23-610(C).Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  Appellate Panel can reverse the ALCâ€™s decision if it determines the ALCâ€™s\r\n  findings are not supported by substantial evidence contained in the record or\r\n  are affected by an error of law. Â Dorman at 165, 565 S.E.2d at 122; see also Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 353, 461\r\n  S.E.2d 388, 391 (1995) (stating the ALCâ€™s findings are supported by substantial\r\n  evidence if, looking at the record as a whole, there is evidence from which\r\n  reasonable minds could reach the same conclusion the ALC reached).  \r\nAfter an aggrieved party has\r\n  exhausted all administrative remedies, the party is entitled to judicial review\r\n  by the South Carolina Court of Appeals.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-380(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).Â  Judicial review is confined to the record and is governed by\r\n  South Carolina Code section Â§1-23-380 (A)(5), which provides: \r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  court may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the agency as to the\r\n  weight of the evidence on questions of fact. Â The court may affirm the decision\r\n  of the agency or remand the case for further proceedings. Â [However,] [t]he\r\n  court may reverse or modify the decision if substantial rights of the appellant\r\n  have been prejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences,\r\n  conclusions, or decisions are: (a) in violation\r\n  of constitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory \r\n\tauthority of the agency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) affected\r\n  by other error of law; (e) clearly erroneous in\r\n  view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the whole record;\r\n  or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized\r\n  by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â 1992 Permit as a\r\n  Basis for OCRMâ€™s Denial \r\nLandowner argues\r\n  the basis for OCRMâ€™s denial of his application for a dock permit was improper.Â \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nFirst,\r\n  Landowner contends OCRM improperly denied his application because regulations\r\n  controlling Dock Master Plans (DMPs) did not exist when OCRM issued a permit to\r\n  Developer in 1992. Â Richard Chinnas, who served as Coastal Councilâ€™s permitting\r\n  coordinator in 1992, testified the Council began implementing a comprehensive\r\n  approach to dock master planning in 1987 under its general permitting\r\n  authority.Â  At that time, the Coastal Council authorized multiple dock permits,\r\n  which it characterized as â€œDMPs,â€ although the process governing DMPs was not\r\n  formalized until 1993.Â  Chinnas testified the Coastal Councilâ€™s permitting\r\n  authority allowed it to issue Developer a permit prohibiting installation of\r\n  additional docks and the permit continued to be enforceable, whether it was\r\n  called a DMP or a general permit.[5]Â  \r\n \r\nOur\r\n  review of the record shows substantial evidence supports the ALCâ€™s finding that\r\n  OCRM properly denied Landownerâ€™s permit application based on the special\r\n  provisions contained in the permit the Coastal Council issued to Developer in\r\n  1992.Â   \r\nB.Â Evaluation of\r\n  Permit Application on its Merits\r\nLandowner\r\n  argues OCRM failed to consider his permit application on its individual merits and\r\n  contends Developerâ€™s permit expired in 1995.Â  We disagree.\r\nOCRMâ€™s\r\n  letter of August 9, 2002 stated the basis for denying Landownerâ€™s permit\r\n  application was the 1992 permit issued to Developer, which was conditioned upon\r\n  there being no additional docks in the subdivision.Â  OCRMâ€™s letter also\r\n  indicated the statutes and regulations it relied upon in denying Landownerâ€™s\r\n  application.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  ALCâ€™s order stated its decision to uphold OCRMâ€™s denial of the permit was based\r\n  on the unique facts of this case, and upon:\r\n\r\n\toverriding\r\n  considerations flowing from Regs. 30-11(C)(1) (the need to consider the extent\r\n  to which long-range, cumulative effects of the project may result within the\r\n  context of other possible development and the general character of the area)\r\n  and Regs. 30-11(C)(2) (the need to consider the extent to which the overall\r\n  plans and designs can be submitted together and evaluated as a whole, rather\r\n  than submitted piecemeal and in aÂ  fragmented way which limits comprehensive\r\n  review).Â  \r\n\r\nThe ALC concluded granting\r\n  Landownerâ€™s permit application was â€œsimply incompatibleâ€ with the consideration\r\n  owed these regulations.  \r\nChinnas\r\n  testified the Coastal Council issued dock permits containing special conditions\r\n  when it was possible to review all potential impacts at the time a new\r\n  development was proposed in order to avoid future â€œpiecemealâ€ applications.Â  He\r\n  stated this type of permit â€œgave us the opportunity to cumulatively review the\r\n  whole project, essentially lock the project inâ€ when the proposed development\r\n  was â€œstill a piece of raw land.â€Â  Chinnas also testified the permitâ€™s\r\n  expiration date governs only the construction period and the conditions remain\r\n  enforceable until they are amended.Â   \r\nWe\r\n  find substantial evidence in the record supports the ALCâ€™s finding that OCRM reviewed\r\n  Landownerâ€™s application on its individual merits, yet within the context of the\r\n  1992 permit prohibiting additional docks.\r\nC.Â Ashley River SAMP\r\nOn\r\n  appeal to this court, Landowner asks us to consider the specific policies of\r\n  the Ashley River SAMP.[6]Â \r\n  However, OCRMâ€™s letter denying Landownerâ€™s permit application, the ALCâ€™s\r\n  decision, and the Appellate Panelâ€™s ruling each stated the permitâ€™s denial was\r\n  based upon the original dock plan issued to Developer in 1992 and on\r\n  consideration of the applicable regulations; the orders did not address the\r\n  SAMP policies.Â  Accordingly, this issue is not preserved for our review.Â  See Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t. of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560\r\n  S.E.2d 410, 417 (2002) (â€œ[I]ssues not raised to and ruled on by the agency are\r\n  not preserved for judicial consideration.Â  Likewise, issues not raised to and\r\n  ruled on by the ALJ are not preserved for appellate consideration.â€).  \r\nD.Â Subsequent Events \r\nLandowner\r\n  contends the special conditions contained in OCRMâ€™s 1992 permit are â€œrendered\r\n  moot by multiple amendments.â€Â  We disagree.  \r\nA\r\n  review of the record shows OCRM had allowed some minor changes to be made to\r\n  the nine docks constructed under Developerâ€™s 1992 permit; these changes include\r\n  the addition of safety rails, navigation lights, and benches to the existing\r\n  docks.Â  Yet, the record also shows OCRM denied several applications to modify\r\n  existing docks, and some dock owners had modified their docks without seeking a\r\n  permit.Â   \r\nChinnas\r\n  testified the ALC authorized one additional dock under a consent order to\r\n  resolve confusion related to the placement of a joint dock under the 1992\r\n  permit.Â  However, he also stated the ALCâ€™s consent order did not constitute a\r\n  modification to the permitâ€™s special condition prohibiting additional docks.Â  \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  ALCâ€™s order expressly addressed both subsequent modifications to existing docks\r\n  and the ALCâ€™s consent order authorizing one additional dock; however, the ALC\r\n  dismissed Landownerâ€™s argument as unpersuasive:  \r\n\r\n\tI have\r\n  given consideration to the fact that modifications have occurred to the\r\n  existing docks and that at least one dock has been added beyond the nine\r\n  originally authorized.Â  However, the addition of handrails to many docks has\r\n  resulted from safety concerns and the other modifications have not been\r\n  extensive.Â  Further, only one new dock added since the original dock plan was\r\n  issued was a dock which arose due to extenuating circumstances.Â  Even that dock\r\n  was not allowed until a consent order was executed through the ALC.Â  Thus, there\r\n  is no evidence of wholesale additions of docks to the subdivision.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the denial of [Landownerâ€™s] dock is not inconsistent with the past\r\n  practice of OCRM in Bakers Landing.\r\n\r\nChinnas\r\n  testified Bakers Landing has ten waterfront lots that are currently restricted\r\n  from building docks by Developerâ€™s 1992 permit.Â  The Homeownerâ€™s Association\r\n  stated in a letter to OCRM that if it granted Landownerâ€™s application â€œequity\r\n  would require that all properties in Bakers Landing that border on the river or\r\n  marsh should be granted permits upon application.â€Â   \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the ALCâ€™s conclusion that minor modifications to the nine permitted\r\n  docks and a consent order allowing the addition of one dock during the fifteen\r\n  years following issuance of Developerâ€™s permit is not sufficient to warrant\r\n  alteration of the conditions OCRM placed on the 1992 permit.  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find the final order of the ALC was unaffected by an error of law and that substantial\r\n  evidence in the record supports its order upholding OCRMâ€™s denial of\r\n  Landownerâ€™s application for a dock permit.Â  Accordingly, the final order of the\r\n  Appellate Panel is\r\nAFFIRMED.[7]\r\nPIEPER,\r\n  J., and CURETON, A.J., concur. \r\n\r\n[1] The South Carolina Coastal Council was subsequently\r\n  incorporated into OCRM within the Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control (DHEC).Â   \r\n[2] In documents Landowner filed with his dock permit\r\n  application, he stated he paid the fair market value of $65,000 for his lot in\r\n  1998. Â \r\n[3] The South Carolina Department of Archives and History\r\n  intervened in support of OCRMâ€™s denial of Landownerâ€™s dock permit, contending â€œthe\r\n  proposed dock would cause undue adverse impacts on the historical and cultural\r\n  values of the Ashley River Historic District, would be inconsistent with the\r\n  Ashley River Special Area Management Plan, and thus would violate the Coastal\r\n  Zone Management Act and the OCRM regulations.â€Â   \r\n[4] The procedural posture of this case is unique because\r\n  the ALC and the Appellate Panel heard Landownerâ€™s appeal prior to the passage\r\n  of 2006 Act No. 387, which was enacted to provide a uniform procedure for hearing\r\n  contested cases and appeals from administrative agencies.Â  Act 387 became\r\n  effective on July 1, 2006 and amended the South Carolina Code sections\r\n  referenced in this opinion. Â See 2006 Act No. 387.\r\n[5] In our review of the record, we note the Coastal\r\n  Councilâ€™s 1991 minutes referred to its consideration of a â€œdock master planâ€\r\n  for Bakers Landing.Â   \r\n[6] On February 14, 1992, this section of the river was\r\n  designated as being within the SAMP.Â  Chinnas testified the Coastal Councilâ€™s decision\r\n  to issue a special conditions permit to Developer was not driven by SAMP and,\r\n  in fact, had SAMP been the driving factor in its decision, the resulting permit\r\n  would have granted only one dock.Â   \r\n[7] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\n  Rule 215, SCACR.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4367","title":"State v.

Page appeals his convictions for conspiracy, attempted armed robbery, and\r\n  possession of a pistol by a person under the age of 21.Â  Page contends the\r\n  circuit court erred in allowing the State to introduce evidence that a\r\n  nontestifying co-defendant implicated Page in a statement to police where the\r\n  statement did not fall into a hearsay exception, and Pageâ€™s counsel did not\r\n  â€œopen the doorâ€ to the admission of the statement.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 16, 2003, Willie Cunningham (Victim)\r\n  was shot and killed near his home in York, South Carolina.Â  Katrina Howard (Girlfriend)\r\n  testified she had driven Page and Lamont McCollum to York that day to the Hall\r\n  Street Apartments.[1] Â Upon arriving in York, Page and McCollum gathered with a group of approximately\r\n  eight individuals in a park near the apartments.Â  Both Page and McCollum showed\r\n  the group, which included co-defendants A.J. Williams and Terrence McKnight, a\r\n  gun each was carrying.Â  The group was smoking marijuana and discussing â€œmaking\r\n  a lick,â€ which Williams testified was slang for â€œcoming up on some extra money,\r\n  doing something to come up with some extra money some way or somehow.â€Â  \r\nRashad Simpson (Nephew), Victimâ€™s nephew, lived with Victim at the\r\n  time of the murder. Â Nephew testified that on the same afternoon he was\r\n  approached by Page and McCollum, neither of whom he knew, asking where they could\r\n  buy marijuana.Â  Nephew responded in the negative and walked away.Â  Later that\r\n  afternoon, the group, led principally by McCollum and Page, concocted a plan to\r\n  rob Victimâ€™s trailer while Nephew was away.Â  McCollum indicated that if\r\n  Williams and McKnight served as lookouts, they â€œwould get a cut of whatever\r\n  [McCollum and Page took] from [Victim]â€™s house.â€Â  Shortly thereafter, the group\r\n  of four approached Victimâ€™s trailer. Â McCollum and Page went directly to the\r\n  porch, and Williams testified he and McKnight stood off to the side of the\r\n  trailer.Â  Before McCollum and Page could go inside, Victim came to the door of\r\n  his trailer.Â  A discussion ensued, and Williams saw Victim reach for the gun\r\n  that McCollum had pulled out of his pocket.Â  Then, Williams testified, McCollum\r\n  â€œpulled back the gun . . . and shot him two times in the chest.â€Â  \r\nNone of the four participants came immediately forward to the police.Â \r\n  Instead, Williams was first caught on tape some nine months later describing Victimâ€™s\r\n  death to a fellow inmate who was wearing a wire, while both were incarcerated\r\n  on other charges.Â  Williams thereafter gave a full statement to Detective Sara\r\n  Robbins (Detective).Â  At the time of his arrest, McKnight gave police an oral\r\n  statement that was later memorialized in writing, as well as a second written\r\n  statement implicating himself and the other co-defendants.Â  In addition,\r\n  Girlfriend gave a statement conflicting with that of Williams, putting both\r\n  McCollum and Page on Nephewâ€™s porch, but indicating Page was the one who shot Victim.Â  \r\nPage made a pre-trial motion to suppress the statements implicating\r\n  him if McKnight chose not to testify, but the motion was denied.Â  At trial, a\r\n  redacted version of McKnightâ€™s statement, replacing any mention of Page with\r\n  â€œanother guyâ€ or the â€œother guy,â€ was admitted into evidence over Pageâ€™s\r\n  objection.Â  McKnight was present at the trial, but chose not to testify.Â  McKnightâ€™s\r\n  statements confirm that both McCollum and Page had guns on the day in question,\r\n  and were interested in robbing Victimâ€™s trailer.Â  \r\nOn cross-examination, Page questioned Detective extensively about her\r\n  investigation and the steps leading to the charges and ultimate arrests of\r\n  Page, McCollum, and McKnight.[2]Â \r\n  Pageâ€™s cross-examination of Detective attempted to show how the State had very\r\n  little evidence to link Page to the murder and attempted armed robbery.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  the State made a motion to admit McKnightâ€™s full and complete statement on the\r\n  basis Page had opened the door to allow the unredacted evidence.Â  The circuit\r\n  court agreed, and admitted McKnightâ€™s unredacted statement. Â \r\nThe jury found Page guilty of conspiracy, attempted armed robbery,\r\n  and possession of a pistol by a person under the age of 21. Â Page was found not\r\n  guilty of murder. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed\r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Â State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002). Â An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of\r\n  the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error\r\n  of law. Â State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467\r\n  (2000).Â  In criminal cases, the appellate\r\n  court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Butler, 353 S.C. 383,\r\n  388, 577 S.E.2d 498, 500&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003).Â  We are bound by the trial\r\n  courtâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  Id.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPage asserts the circuit court erred in finding\r\n  his counsel had â€œopened the doorâ€ to the admission of the unredacted statement\r\n  of his nontestifying co-defendant.Â  We disagree and affirm.Â  \r\nâ€œThe constitutional\r\n  right to confront and cross examine witnesses is essential to a fair trial in\r\n  that it promotes reliability in criminal trials and insures [sic] that\r\n  convictions will not result from testimony of individuals who cannot be\r\n  challenged at trial.â€ Â State v. Martin, 292 S.C. 437, 439, 357 S.E.2d\r\n  21, 22 (1987). Â The introduction of a nontestifying co-defendantâ€™s statement\r\n  which implicates a defendant violates a defendantâ€™s right\r\n  to confrontation because no opportunity to cross-examine the co-defendant is\r\n  presented. Bruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123 (1968). Â Because the right to confrontation is so fundamental,\r\n  limiting instructions are not an adequate substitute. Â Id.; See also State v. Dennis, 337 S.C. 275, 523 S.E.2d 173 (1999) (recognizing that\r\n  in Bruton, the Supreme Court held that a\r\n  defendantâ€™s rights under the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment are\r\n  violated by the admission of a nontestifying co-defendantâ€™s confession that\r\n  inculpates a defendant, even if a cautionary instruction is given).\r\nRedaction\r\n  has come into play as a tool to allow admission of a co-defendantâ€™s confession\r\n  against the confessor in a joint trial. State v. Holmes, 342 S.C. 113, 119,\r\n  536 S.E.2d 671, 674 (2000). Â The point of redaction is to permit the confession\r\n  to be used against the nontestifying confessor, while avoiding implicating his\r\n  co-defendant.Â  Id. Â The Confrontation Clause is not violated when a\r\n  defendantâ€™s name is redacted but other evidence links the statementâ€™s\r\n  application to the defendant, if a proper limiting\r\n  instruction is given.Â  See Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200, 211\r\n  (1987) (holding â€œthe Confrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a\r\n  nontestifying co-defendantâ€™s confession with a proper limiting instruction\r\n  when, as here, the confession is redacted to eliminate not only the defendantâ€™s\r\n  name, but any reference to his or her existence.â€).\r\nHere, as stated\r\n  above, after Pageâ€™s cross-examination of Detective, the State moved to admit\r\n  McKnightâ€™s unredacted statement on the basis that Page had opened the door to\r\n  this testimony due to his questions on Detectiveâ€™s investigative techniques and\r\n  the sufficiency of evidence linked to Page.Â  It is firmly established that\r\n  otherwise inadmissible evidence may be properly admitted when opposing counsel\r\n  opens the door to that evidence.Â  State v. Young, 364 S.C. 476, 485, 613\r\n  S.E.2d 386, 391 (Ct. App. 2005) cert. granted, Jan. 2007; See also State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 632, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004) (â€œGiven\r\n  that [defendants] maintained that [the company] did not allow pornographic materials\r\n  or links on the website, it is patent that they opened\r\n  the door to this line of inquiry.â€); State v. White,\r\n  361 S.C. 407, 415-16, 605 S.E.2d 540, 544 (2004) (ruling expert could testify\r\n  that she believed the victim in this case because defendant opened\r\n  the door by cross-examining expert about other cases in\r\n  which she did not believe victim); State v. Dunlap, 353 S.C. 539, 541,\r\n  579 S.E.2d 318, 319 (2003) (holding defense counselâ€™s opening statement â€œopened the door to the introduction\r\n  of evidence rebutting the contention that [defendant] was merely an addictâ€); State\r\n    v. Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 175, 508 S.E.2d 870, 878 (1998) (â€œ[B]ecause\r\n  appellant opened the door about\r\n  his relationship with his wife, the solicitor was entitled to cross-examine him\r\n  regarding the relationship, even if the responses brought out appellantâ€™s prior\r\n  criminal domestic violence conviction.â€).Â  \r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the court found Page attempted to elicit replies from Detective\r\n  indicating the only evidence she had gathered linking Page to the crime were contradictory\r\n  statements and testimony of Williams and Girlfriend, while, in reality, she had\r\n  also used co-defendant McKnightâ€™s statements. Â This, the court determined,\r\n  reflected on Detectiveâ€™s credibility as a witness and on the quality of the\r\n  investigation she undertook that led to Pageâ€™s arrest.Â  As a result, the court\r\n  found Page had opened the door during his cross-examination to the extent that\r\n  Detectiveâ€™s testimony warranted bolstering.Â  Detective was then allowed to\r\n  testify the â€œother guyâ€ identified in McKnightâ€™s statement was Page, and the\r\n  court gave a limiting instruction to the jury that it should not consider the\r\n  evidence against Page, but only as to the credibility of Detective and her\r\n  investigation.Â  \r\nWhether a person\r\n  opens the door to the admission of otherwise inadmissible evidence during the\r\n  course of a trial is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State\r\n    v. Adcock, 194 S.C. 234, 234, 9 S.E.2d 730, 732 (1940).Â  See also Corbett v. Fleetwood Homes of North Carolina, 213 F.3d 630 (Table), 2000\r\n  WL 530325 (C.A.4 (S.C.)) (2000).Â  While we recognize the discretionary\r\n  authority of the trial judge in this area, we believe he erred in finding that\r\n  Pageâ€™s counselâ€™s zealous representation of his client required the admission of\r\n  this inadmissible evidence in order to rehabilitate Detectiveâ€™s investigative\r\n  techniques.Â  Nevertheless, we find any error resulting from the admission of\r\n  the unredacted statement was harmless. Â \r\nError is harmless\r\n  where it could not reasonably have affected the trialâ€™s outcome. Â State v.\r\n    Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151 (1985). Â No definite rule of law governs the finding that an error\r\n  was harmless; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error\r\n  must be determined from its relationship to the entire case. Â State v.\r\n    Reeves, 301 S.C. 191, 193-94, 391 S.E.2d 241, 243 (1990).Â  In\r\n  considering whether error is harmless, a caseâ€™s particular facts must be\r\n  considered along with various factors including:\r\n\r\n  ... the importance of the witnessâ€™ testimony in the\r\n    prosecutionâ€™s case, whether the testimony was cumulative, the presence or\r\n    absence of evidence corroborating or contradicting the testimony of the witness\r\n    on material points, the extent of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and,\r\n    of course, the overall strength of the prosecutionâ€™s case.\r\n\r\nState v. Clark, 315 S.C. 478,\r\n  481, 445 S.E.2d 634, 635 (1994) (quoting Delaware v. Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)). Â Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial\r\n  is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence\r\n  such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€ Â State v. Bailey,\r\n  298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989). Â Generally, appellate courts will\r\n  not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.\r\n  Â State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  \r\nHarmless error was\r\n  found in State v. Gillian, where the testimony was â€œlargely cumulativeâ€\r\n  to testimony from other witnesses and other evidence suggested Gillian was\r\n  guilty.Â  State v. Gillian, 360 S.C. 433, 456-57, 602 S.E.2d 62, 74-75\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004), affâ€™d as modified on other grounds, 373 S.C. 601, 646\r\n  S.E.2d 872 (2007).Â  In Gillian, we stated that â€œ[n]o definite rule of law\r\n  governs the finding that an error was harmless; rather, the materiality and\r\n  prejudicial character of the error\r\n  must be determined from its relationship to the entire case.â€Â  Id., at 454-55, 602 S.E.2d at 73. \r\nApplying the Van\r\n  Arsdall factors to the case at hand, we note that all of McKnightâ€™s\r\n  statement mentioning Page was either cumulative or corroborated by other\r\n  witnesses.Â  McKnightâ€™s statement references Page specifically on four\r\n  occasions.Â  The first two occasions, McKnight references the two â€œlittle pocket\r\n  gunsâ€ McCollum and Page were carrying. Â As described above, co-defendant\r\n  Williams had already testified McCollum was carrying â€œa little small .25â€ and\r\n  that â€œit was an automatic.â€Â  Meanwhile, Williams testified that Page carried â€œa\r\n  little .32, old rusty looking .32 . . . revolver.â€Â  \r\nThe third occasion\r\n  McKnightâ€™s statement mentions Page, it places him at the apartments, and repeats\r\n  that â€œ[McCollum] and Page kept playing with their guns, pulling them out and\r\n  pointing at us playing.â€Â  In addition to Williamsâ€™ testimony that Page had a\r\n  gun, the testimony or statements of four people placed Page at the apartments.Â \r\n  These included: Â Nephew, Girlfriend, Williams, and Mary Burress whose statement\r\n  placing McCollum and Page on her porch at the Hall Street Apartments the day of\r\n  Victimâ€™s murder was read into evidence by Detective during her testimony.Â \r\n  Finally, McKnightâ€™s statement placed Page on Nephewâ€™s porch during the\r\n  commission of the murder.Â  As indicated above, the testimony of both Williams\r\n  and Girlfriend had already placed Page on the porch; therefore McKnightâ€™s\r\n  statement was merely cumulative to the evidence already on the record. Â \r\nMoreover, prior to the admission of the unredacted statement, Detective was asked to respond to\r\n  a question on cross-examination from Page as to whether she corroborated the\r\n  details of Williamsâ€™ statements to police.Â  Detective testified that â€œ[the\r\n  police] did talk to other people and were unable to corroborate [Williamsâ€™s\r\n  statements] until we corroborated it through Terrance McKnightâ€™s statement.â€\r\n  Â (emphasis added).Â  This testimony was not objected to at the time.Â  A\r\n  contemporaneous objection is required to preserve issues for direct appellate\r\n  review.Â  Webb v. CSX Transp., Inc., 364 S.C. 639, 657, 615 S.E.2d 440,\r\n  450 (2005).Â  As the Supreme Court has stressed on several occasions, the\r\n  Constitution entitles a criminal defendant to a fair trial, not a perfect one. Â See United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 508-509 (1983); Bruton,\r\n  391 U.S. 135.Â  Â \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs a result of the foregoing, we hold that any error allowing the introduction of Pageâ€™s nontestifying\r\n  co-defendantâ€™s statement implicating Page to the police was harmless beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.Â  The decision of the\r\n  circuit court is accordingly\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  and THOMAS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Howard\r\n  was McCollumâ€™s girlfriend and was pregnant with his child at the time of the\r\n  incident; McCollum is a co-defendant in this case.Â  \r\n[2] Williams, as referenced above, was already in\r\n  custody, and gave Detective several statements which led to the other\r\n  defendantsâ€™ arrests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4368","title":"Estate of Nicholson v.

Burnett, South Carolina Department of Health and Human\r\n  Services, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nWILLIAMS, J.: Â Ronald D. Nicholson, as the Personal Representative (the PR) for the Estate of\r\n  Ada B. Nicholson (Mother), appeals the decision of the Administrative Law\r\n  Judge (ALJ) affirming the South Carolina Department of Health and Human\r\n  Servicesâ€™ (the Department) denial of Max Nicholsonâ€™s (Son) request for an undue\r\n  hardship waiver under the South Carolina Medicaid program (Medicaid).Â  We affirm.Â \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nIn April 1996, Mother began receiving services from Community Long\r\n  Term Care (CLTC), a program provided by Medicaid.Â  CLTC provides services to\r\n  Medicaid recipients who elect to receive assistance in their homes rather than\r\n  seek admission to a nursing facility.Â  Mother continued to receive these\r\n  services until January 1999 when she moved into Easley Nursing Home (the Nursing\r\n  Home). Â While in the Nursing Home, Motherâ€™s care was paid for by Medicaid.Â  In\r\n  July 2004, Mother passed away.Â  Motherâ€™s estate consisted of a partial interest\r\n  in her home.Â  \r\nFollowing Motherâ€™s death, the Department determined it had paid\r\n  $206,616.26 for CLTC and/or nursing home care on Motherâ€™s behalf, and\r\n  subsequently, the Department filed a claim in that amount against Motherâ€™s\r\n  estate.Â  The PR then requested a hardship waiver on behalf of Son, who was\r\n  incarcerated at the time, claiming Son had lived with Mother for more than two\r\n  years prior to her entering the Nursing Home, which would preclude the\r\n  Department from asserting an interest in Motherâ€™s home.Â  Son had been\r\n  incarcerated since October 2002.Â   \r\nThe Department denied the PRâ€™s request.Â  The Department stated the\r\n  hardship waiver would not be granted for the following reasons: (1) Sonâ€™s\r\n  income exceeded 185% of the federal poverty guidelines; (2) Son was not\r\n  actually residing in Motherâ€™s home at the time the waiver was requested; and\r\n  (3) Son had not lived in Motherâ€™s home in over two and a half years prior to\r\n  Motherâ€™s institutionalization.Â  Pursuant to the provisions of the Appeals and\r\n  Hearings regulations of the Department, the PR appealed the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  denial, and a hearing was scheduled.Â   \r\nThe Hearing Officer assigned to review the PRâ€™s appeal\r\n  subsequently concurred with the Departmentâ€™s decision to deny the waiver.Â  The\r\n  Hearing Officer additionally found CLTC services were the functional equivalent\r\n  of nursing home care.Â  The PR then appealed the Hearing Officerâ€™s decision to\r\n  the Administrative Law Court.Â  Although the ALJ did not rule on the issue of\r\n  whether CLTC is the functional equivalent of institutionalization, the ALJ did\r\n  find Son was not â€œactually residingâ€ in Motherâ€™s home when the waiver\r\n  application was submitted.Â  The ALJ, therefore, upheld the Hearing Officerâ€™s\r\n  denial of Sonâ€™s hardship waiver.Â  This appeal follows.Â   \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œAppeals from decisions by the [D]epartment are heard pursuant to\r\n  the Administrative Procedures Act [(APA)] . . . .â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-6-190\r\n  (2002).Â Â  The APA, therefore, determines the standard of judicial review for\r\n  cases initially heard by the Department. Â Toddâ€™s Ice Cream, Inc. v. S.C.\r\n    Employment Sec. Commâ€™n, 281 S.C. 254, 257, 315 S.E.2d 373, 375 (Ct. App.\r\n  1984).Â  â€œIt is well settled that in reviewing a decision by an administrative\r\n  agency, this Court will not substitute its judgment for that of the agency\r\n  concerning the weight of the evidence as to questions of fact.â€Â  Kearse v.\r\n    State Health and Human Servs. Fin. Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 198, 200, 456 S.E.2d\r\n  892, 893 (1995).Â  â€œPursuant to the APA, this [C]ourt may reverse or modify an\r\n  agency decision which is either affected by error of law or clearly erroneous\r\n  in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence in the record.â€ Â S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation v. Girgis, 332 S.C. 162, 166,\r\n  503 S.E.2d 490, 492 (Ct. App. 1998). Â The substantial evidence standard is met\r\n  if a reasonable mind might accept the evidence as adequate to support the\r\n  agencyâ€™s conclusion.Â  Kearse, 318 S.C. at 200, 456 S.E.2d at 893.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe PR argues the ALJ erred in finding Son was not â€œactually residingâ€\r\n  in Motherâ€™s home when the hardship application was made.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nThe Department may seek recovery of medical assistance paid under\r\n  Medicaid from the estate of an individual who, at the age of fifty-five or\r\n  older, received medical assistance consisting of nursing facility services or\r\n  home and community-based services.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-7-460(A)(2) (Supp.\r\n  2007).Â  The Department must waive recovery, however, upon proof of undue\r\n  hardship asserted by an heir or devisee of the decedent.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  43-7-460(C) (Supp. 2007).Â   \r\nAn undue hardship exists if the surviving child of the decedent\r\n  lived in the home of the decedent for at least two years immediately prior to\r\n  the decedentâ€™s institutionalization.Â  Section 43-7-460(C)(1)(d). Â The child\r\n  claiming this hardship, however, must have been â€œactually residing in\r\n  the [decedentâ€™s] home at the time the hardship [was] claimed.â€Â  Section\r\n  43-7-460(C)(1) (emphasis added).Â  Another situation allowing for an undue hardship\r\n  waiver is when the claimant has been living in the decedentâ€™s home two years\r\n  prior to the decedentâ€™s death, owns no real property, and earns below a certain\r\n  income level.Â  Section 43-7-460(C)(2)(a), (c), (d).Â  As in the previous example,\r\n  however, the claimant must have been â€œactually residing in the\r\n  [decedentâ€™s] home at the time the hardship [was] claimed.â€Â  Section\r\n  43-7-460(C)(2)(b) (emphasis added).Â  The statute fails to define the phrase\r\n  â€œactually residing.â€Â  Consequently, we must turn to the rules of statutory\r\n  construction to ascertain the phraseâ€™s meaning.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to determine and give effect to the\r\n  intent of the legislature.Â  Charleston County Sch. Dist. v.\r\n    State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993).Â  The\r\n  best evidence of legislative intent is the text of the statute. Â Jones v.\r\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 231, 612 S.E.2d 719, 724 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).Â  If â€œthe terms of the statute are clear, the court must apply those\r\n  terms according to their literal meaning.â€Â  City of Columbia v. Am. Civil\r\n    Liberties Union of S.C., Inc., 323 S.C. 384, 387, 475 S.E.2d 747, 749\r\n  (1996).Â  Â Â If there is any ambiguity in the statute, however, that ambiguity\r\n  â€œshould be resolved in favor of a just, equitable, and beneficial operation of\r\n  the law.â€Â  Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 340, 478 S.E.2d\r\n  74, 77 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]he language [of the statute] must\r\n  also be read in a sense which harmonizes with its subject matter and accords\r\n  with its general purpose.â€Â  Cox v. BellSouth Telecomm., 356 S.C. 468,\r\n  472, 589 S.E.2d 766, 768 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  â€œWhere a word is not defined in a\r\n  statute, our appellate courts have looked to the usual dictionary meaning to\r\n  supply its meaning.â€Â  Lee v. Thermal Engâ€™g Corp., 352 S.C. 81, 91-92,\r\n  572 S.E.2d 298, 303-04 (Ct. App. 2002).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nâ€œResideâ€ has been defined as (1) to dwell permanently or\r\n  continuously; (2) to have a settled abode for a time; or (3) to have oneâ€™s\r\n  residence or domicile.Â  Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 1931\r\n  (1986).Â  However, in the legal field, the term â€œresideâ€ has been defined as to\r\n  â€œ[l]ive, dwell, abide, sojourn, stay, remain, [or] lodge.â€ Blackâ€™s law dictionary 1176 (5th ed. 1979).Â  Additionally, the\r\n  term â€œresidenceâ€ has been defined as â€œ[t]he place where one actually lives, as\r\n  distinguished from a domicile . . . .â€ Â Blackâ€™s law dictionary 1050 (7th ed. 2000).Â  â€œDomicileâ€ has been\r\n  defined as â€œ[t]he place at which a person is physically present and that the\r\n  person regards as home; a personâ€™s true, fixed, principal, and permanent home,\r\n  to which that person intends to return and remain even though currently\r\n  residing elsewhere.â€Â  Id. at 396. Â \r\nIn light of these definitions, â€œresidenceâ€ is a somewhat general\r\n  and fluid term. Â When read alone, the word â€œresidenceâ€ is susceptible to\r\n  varying interpretations.Â  Phillips v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 195 S.C. 472, 476,\r\n  12 S.E.2d 13, 15 (1940).Â  It may have a restricted or enlarged meaning, and\r\n  therefore, the precise meaning of the term is dependent upon the explanatory\r\n  context.Â  Id. at 476-77, 12 S.E.2d at 15-16.\r\nThe context in which â€œactually residingâ€ is used in Section\r\n  43-7-460 indicates the phrase has a restricted meaning of physical presence,\r\n  rather than a broader meaning of domicile. Â The statute allows for waivers of\r\n  the Stateâ€™s recovery only in situations when the ramifications would be\r\n  extremely detrimental to the claimant.Â  See Section 43-7-460(C) (stating\r\n  the Department must waive recovery if an heir or devisee proves undue hardship\r\n  will ensue).Â  The requirement that the claimant must actually be living in the\r\n  decedentâ€™s home when the undue hardship waiver is claimed is one way the\r\n  statute ensures the waivers are permitted in only those limited situations.Â  Â Â \r\nThis restricted meaning of physical presence is bolstered by the\r\n  emphasis added by the adverb â€œactually.â€Â  This adverb stresses the importance\r\n  that the claimant must currently be living in the decedentâ€™s home when the\r\n  hardship is claimed.Â  Looking at the language of the statute, it is\r\n  insufficient to show the decedentâ€™s home is the claimantâ€™s domicile without\r\n  proof the home is also the claimantâ€™s current residence.Â  This interpretation\r\n  is in line with previous case law which has recognized that â€œâ€˜residenceâ€™ is a\r\n  more elastic and flexible term than domicile or citizenship.Â  A person may have\r\n  only one domicile, but may have several residences.â€Â  Cook v. Fed. Ins. Co.,\r\n  263 S.C. 575, 582, 211 S.E.2d 881, 884 (1975).Â  We also note, while a personâ€™s\r\n  â€œlegal residenceâ€ is often determined by his or her domicile, a personâ€™s\r\n  â€œactual residenceâ€ will be determined by his or her â€œpresent physical\r\n  location.â€Â  25 Am. Jur. 2d Domicil Â§ 9 (2008).Â  This distinction between actual\r\n  residence and legal residence has long been recognized. See Phillips,\r\n  195 S.C. at 477, 12 S.E.2d at 16 (â€œBut a distinction has long been made between actual residence and legal residence.â€) (emphasis in original).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nFinding the phrase â€œactually residingâ€ requires physical presence\r\n  in the decedentâ€™s home, Son must have been currently living in Motherâ€™s home when\r\n  the hardship waiver application was made.

Subsequently Mr. T filed a complaint with the Sumter County Family Court\r\n  seeking a divorce from Ms. T and seeking joint, legal custody of the partiesâ€™\r\n  minor children. In paragraph five (5) of Mr. Tâ€™s complaint, he alleged that\r\n  â€œtwo children have been born of this marriage.â€ Â In paragraph six (6) of his complaint,\r\n  Mr. T alleged that he was entitled to joint, legal custody of the children.Â  Ms.\r\n  T then filed an answer and counterclaim admitting the allegations contained in\r\n  paragraph five (5) of Mr. Tâ€™s complaint and denying that he was entitled to\r\n  joint, legal custody of their children.\r\nThe\r\n  parties subsequently entered into an agreement which was placed in the record. Â The\r\n  agreement specified that the parties agreed that Ms. T would have sole custody\r\n  of the partiesâ€™ two minor children. The agreement of the parties provided for\r\n  reasonable and liberal visitation by Mr. T and it also provided for the payment\r\n  of child support by Mr. T. He agreed to pay child support for the children in\r\n  the amount of $1,219.69 each month.\r\nThe\r\n  parties submitted their agreement to the Sumter County Family Court for\r\n  approval and the court approved their agreement. The couple was divorced by\r\n  Final Divorce Decree filed on October 18, 1999, which specifically set forth\r\n  and incorporated the partiesâ€™ agreement. Â Pursuant to that decree, the court\r\n  specifically found that â€œ[t]wo children have been born of this marriage.â€ Â No\r\n  appeal was taken from this order. \r\nMr.\r\n  T filed the present lawsuit alleging that from the time of the birth of the\r\n  children, through the time of the divorce and until recent months, he was under\r\n  the false and mistaken belief that these children were his biological children.\r\n  Mr. T also alleged that during a summer visit in 2005, he noticed that his\r\n  sonâ€™s physical appearance was similar to that of a man by the name of Michael\r\n  Alston (Alston). Â Respondent Alston was named as a party to the present\r\n  lawsuit.Â  Mr. T also attached to his original complaint a DNA paternity test\r\n  suggesting that he was not the biological parent of the children.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the temporary hearing on March 10, 2006, counsel for Ms. T asked the court to\r\n  continue the matter or to dismiss the complaint based on the courtâ€™s lack of in\r\n  personam jurisdiction over her and the courtâ€™s lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction based on res judicata/collateral estoppel grounds.Â  Alston also\r\n  joined in the relief requested by Ms. T alleging he was a resident of Washington D.C. Â The Honorable W. Jeffery Young took Ms. Tâ€™s motion to dismiss under\r\n  advisement and allowed the parties thirty (30) days within which to prepare and\r\n  submit briefs to the court regarding Ms. Tâ€™s oral motion to dismiss.\r\nOn\r\n  March 22, 2006, Mr. T amended his pleadings to allege fraud on the part of Ms.\r\n  T. Â She then filed her answer and counterclaim to the amended complaint on\r\n  April 19, 2006. Â In her answer and counterclaim, Ms. T objected to the court\r\n  considering the paternity test which was attached to Mr. Tâ€™s pleadings.\r\nThereafter,\r\n  the court issued its order dismissing the complaint with prejudice based upon\r\n  the prior divorce decree stating that there was â€œa clear finding of paternityâ€\r\n  and the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction based on res judicata/collateral\r\n  estoppel. The courtâ€™s order of dismissal was filed on June 1, 2006.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to a motion for reconsideration, a hearing was held on September 6, 2006; that\r\n  motion was denied.[2]\r\nOn\r\n  September 28, 2006, Mr. T filed his Notice of Appeal. The appeal was dismissed\r\n  on November 9, 2006 and was reinstated on December 21, 2006. On or about March\r\n  1, 2006, Mr. T filed a Motion to Argue against Precedent with this court which\r\n  was subsequently denied.[3] \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to correct errors of law\r\n  and to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102 (2005); Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 311, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717 (1989).Â \r\n  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to disregard\r\n  the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Lacke v. Lacke, 362 S.C. 302, 307, 608\r\n  S.E.2d 147, 149-50 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  The issue presented on appeal is purely a\r\n  question of law.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nMr. T claims that\r\n  the family court erred in granting the respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss for lack\r\n  of subject matter jurisdiction based on res judicata/collateral estoppel\r\n  grounds.Â  The procedural posture of this case is critical to this\r\n  courtâ€™s analysis.Â  Mr. T has filed an independent action challenging the\r\n  original decree on various grounds. The first cause of action in Mr. Tâ€™s\r\n  amended complaint brings the underlying paternity action pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-952 (1985). Â Â In his second cause of action, he seeks relief on the\r\n  ground that prospective enforcement of the existing decree would be inequitable\r\n  and it should therefore be set aside pursuant to Rule 60(b)(5), SCRCP.Â \r\n  Finally, in his third cause of action, he seeks relief generally under Rule\r\n  60(b) which the court may liberally construe as either a motion or an\r\n  independent action.[4]Â  Some of the causes of action suggest more than one ground of relief but throughout\r\n  his pleading, he asserts various allegations of inequity and fraud or\r\n  misrepresentation. Â In any event, where the interests of minors or incompetents\r\n  are involved, â€œ[p]rocedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to\r\n  zealously guard the rights of minors.Â  Where the rights and best interests of a\r\n  minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the parties.â€ S.C. Dept. of Soc. Servs.,\r\n    v. Roe, 371 S.C. 450, 463, 639 S.E.2d 165, 172 (Ct. App. 2006) (citations\r\n  omitted).\r\nThe family court\r\n  judge found that the original divorce decree made a clear finding of paternity.\r\n  Â The court cites to paragraph four of the divorce decree which states that\r\n  â€œ[t]wo children have been born to this marriage.â€Â  The family court judge then\r\n  concluded that the court â€œhas no jurisdiction since the action is barred by res\r\n  judicata/collateral estoppel.â€Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel principles are not\r\n  matters of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Subject matter jurisdiction refers to a court's\r\n  power to hear and determine cases of the general class or category to which proceedings\r\n  in question belong. Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) (citation omitted). Â Preclusive concepts such as res\r\n  judicata and collateral estoppel are not jurisdictional matters.Â  Weston v.\r\n    Margaret J. Weston Med. Ctr., 2007 WL 2750216 at *4 n.6 (D.S.C. Sept. 20, 2007)\r\n  (citing Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Indus. Corp., 544 U.S. 280, 125\r\n  S.Ct. 1517 (2005)).Â  While the family court order referenced jurisdiction, we\r\n  believe the further reference to preclusion principles suggests the court\r\n  dismissed the case under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.\r\nIn doing so, the\r\n  family court judge relied on the factual similarities between the case at hand\r\n  and this courtâ€™s decision in Mr. G v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. 305, 465 S.E.2d\r\n  101 (Ct. App. 1995).Â  However, the case at hand is procedurally distinguishable\r\n  from Mr. G. Â Here, Mr. T not only filed an independent action challenging\r\n  the original decree, but also specifically seeks relief under Rule 60(b)(5); Â in Mr. G, the court specifically noted that the family court never ruled on\r\n  the Rule 60(b)(5) issue and declined to consider it on appeal.Â  Accordingly, sitting\r\n  as a panel, we do not need to reconsider the precedent set by Mr. G in\r\n  order to determine this appeal.[5]\r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  the intrinsic/extrinsic fraud analysis of Mr. G, the presence of extrinsic\r\n  fraud is not the only mechanism by which a prior judgment can be set aside.Â  Rule\r\n  60(b), SCRCP states, in part:\r\n\r\n  (b)\r\n    Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud,\r\n    etc. On motion and upon such terms as are\r\n    just, the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final\r\n    judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n\t(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;\r\n\t(2)\r\n  newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered\r\n  in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);(3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;\r\n\t(4) the judgment is void;\r\n\t(5) the\r\n  judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment upon\r\n  which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer\r\n    equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.\r\n    The motion\r\n      shall be made within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2), and (3)\r\n      not more than one year after the judgment, order or proceeding was entered or\r\n      taken. A motion under this subdivision (b) does not affect the finality of a\r\n      judgment or suspend its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a\r\n        court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment,\r\n        order, or proceeding, â€œorâ€ to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.\r\n      During the pendency of an appeal, leave to make the motion must be obtained\r\n      from the appellate court. Writs of coram nobis, coram vobis, audita querela,\r\n      and bills of review and bills in the nature of a bill of review, are abolished,\r\n      and the procedure for obtaining any relief from a judgment shall be by motion\r\n      as prescribed in these rules or by an independent action.\r\n\r\n\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The language of Rule 60 specifically excludes motions under\r\n  Rule 60(b)(4) and (5) from the one year limitation within which prior judgments\r\n  may be attacked and indicates these motions must be brought within a reasonable\r\n  time.Â  Furthermore, Rule 60(b)(5) allows the court to entertain motions to\r\n  relieve a party from a prior judgment based on the competing equities of the\r\n  circumstances that establish the judgmentâ€™s prospective application is no\r\n  longer equitable.\r\nFinally,\r\n  aside from the five subsections mentioned above, Rule 60 explicitly indicates\r\n  that it in no way limits the courtâ€™s power to entertain an independent action\r\n  â€œto relieve a party from a judgment . . . â€˜orâ€™ to set aside a judgment\r\n  for fraud upon the court.â€ (emphasis added).Â  While the most common ground for\r\n  an independent action is for fraud, the rule is not restricted to only that\r\n  ground. The structure of this rule and its use of the word â€œorâ€ indicate to\r\n  this court two potential independent action attacks on a judgment, order or\r\n  proceeding: 1) one based on such rare, special, exceptional or unusual\r\n  circumstances that may warrant equitable relief, including accident or mistake\r\n  or 2) one based in equity for fraud upon the court. See, 11 CHARLES ALAN\r\n  WRIGHT, ARTHUR R. MILLER &amp; MARY KAY KANE, FEDERAL PRACTICE. &amp; PROCEDURE\r\n  Â§ 2868 (2d ed. 1995).\r\n\r\n  The\r\n    Eighth Circuit characterized the independent action as follows:\r\n\tThe\r\n  indispensable elements of such a cause of action are 1) a judgment which ought\r\n  not, in equity and good conscience, to be enforced; 2) a good defense to the\r\n  alleged cause of action on which the judgment is founded; 3) fraud, accident,\r\n  or mistake which prevented the defendant in the judgment from obtaining the\r\n  benefit of his defense; 4) the absence of fault or negligence on the part of\r\n  the defendant; and 5) the absence of any adequate remedy at law.\r\n\r\nNatâ€™l Sur. Co. of N.Y. v. State Bank of Humboldt, 120\r\n  Fed. 593 (8th Cir. 1903).Â  In essence, the rule merely reflects many\r\n  of the considerations attendant to an equitable analysis.Â  Further, since the\r\n  independent action referenced in the rule is one in equity, the court may\r\n  consider equitable defenses such as laches, unclean hands, and whether an\r\n  adequate legal remedy exists.Â  The court may also consider other policy doctrines\r\n  such as parens patriae; we do not suggest this list is exclusive.Â \r\n  However, what we do suggest is that equity only intervenes when the\r\n  circumstances so require, but to do so, a court must be aware of all of the\r\n  circumstances before it acts.Â Â  Thus, the parties must be allowed to develop\r\n  the record accordingly.\r\nWe find it\r\n  necessary to review some of the cases prior to this date to test how they\r\n  reflect these equitable principles.Â  In Eichman v. Eichman, 285 S.C.\r\n  378, 329 S.E.2d 764 (1985), the husband was barred from asserting that he was\r\n  not the father of the child.Â  There were no allegations of fraud; however, based\r\n  on the elements cited above, it can be argued that the husband was at fault\r\n  since there was an indication the child was born before husband was married and\r\n  he arguably could have explored the matter fully based on that knowledge but\r\n  intentionally chose not do so in hopes of reconciliation.Â  Thus, his own\r\n  voluntary decisions could reasonably preclude his request for relief.Â  In Evans\r\n    v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 366 S.E.2d 44 (Ct. App. 1988), the former husband\r\n  sought to collaterally attack a child support decree and filed a Rule 60 motion\r\n  based on evidence that he could not father a child throughout his life.Â  The\r\n  case was dismissed for failure to state a claim but that order was reversed\r\n  because acts of the wife inducing him to sign a document denied husband the\r\n  opportunity to be heard. Â Â Similarly, in Arnold, discussed herein, the\r\n  trial court determined that the husband was estopped to contest paternity.Â \r\n  However, the husband alleged fraud and the court reversed finding that the trial\r\n  court made no determination whether there existed a genuine issue of fact\r\n  regarding fraud since res judicata would not preclude vacation of the order if\r\n  the requisite type of fraud was present.Â  The court also indicated that for\r\n  collateral estoppel purposes, there was no contention that the parties actually\r\n  litigated the question of paternity.\r\nTherefore, even if\r\n  we were to assume based on precedent that any fraud alleged is intrinsic in\r\n  nature, the judgment and concurrent finding of paternity are nonetheless\r\n  vulnerable to attack outside of the fraud context under Rule 60(b)(5) and\r\n  through an independent action if the appropriate circumstances are present.[6]Â \r\n  If the family court had reached this stage of the analysis, it would have been\r\n  necessary for it to consider â€œwhetherâ€ res judicata or collateral estoppel should\r\n  apply based on the circumstances presented.Â  However, the parties were never\r\n  given an opportunity to develop the record on these issues because the court\r\n  merely determined it lacked jurisdiction based on those same preclusion\r\n  principles without giving consideration to any possible exceptions to these\r\n  rules. Â We understand the family courtâ€™s concern, as well as hesitation, since there\r\n  is little guidance in our case law on the various exceptions to preclusion\r\n  principles.\r\nAs indicated, these\r\n  preclusion concepts have been subjected to exceptions to their application.Â  This\r\n  court, in Pye v. Aycock, 325 S.C. 426, 437-38, 480 S.E.2d 455, 460-61\r\n  (Ct. App. 1997), adopted the Restatement (Second) of Judgments Â§ 28 (1982),\r\n  which states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  an issue is actually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment,\r\n  and the determination is essential to the judgment, relitigation of the issue\r\n  in a subsequent action between the parties is not precluded in the following\r\n  circumstances:\r\n\t(5)\r\n  There is a clear and convincing need for a new determination of the issue (a)\r\n  because of the potential adverse impact of the determination on the public\r\n  interest or the interests of persons\r\n  not themselves parties in the initial action, (b) because it was not\r\n  sufficiently foreseeable at the time of the initial action that the issue would\r\n  arise in the context of a subsequent action, or (c) because the party sought to\r\n  be precluded, as a result of the conduct of his adversary or other special circumstances,\r\n  did not have an adequate opportunity or incentive to obtain a full and fair\r\n  adjudication in the initial action.\r\n\r\nThe mere presence of the\r\n  various exceptions, many of which are founded in equity principles, warrants\r\n  affording the parties the opportunity to develop the record.Â  As noted in the\r\n  Restatement provision adopted in Pye, the adverse impact upon the\r\n  interests of persons not parties to the original litigation may also be\r\n  considered.Â  Here, neither the alleged biological father, nor the children,\r\n  were parties to the original litigation.\r\nAs\r\n  articulately stated in People v. Plevy, 52 N.Y.2d 58, 64, 417 N.E.2d 518,\r\n  521 (1980) (citation omitted), preclusive doctrines are â€œnot to be rigidly or mechanically applied and must on occasion, yield to more fundamental\r\n  concerns.â€[7]Â \r\n  More precisely, the application of res judicata and collateral estoppel â€œmay be\r\n  precluded where unfairness or injustice results, or public policy requires it.â€ Nelson v. OHG, 354 S.C. 290, 315, 580 S.E.2d 171, 184 (Ct. App. 2003) revâ€™d\r\n    in part, 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005) (citing State v. Bacote,\r\n  331 S.C. 328, 331, 503 S.E.2d 161, 163 (1998); Carrigg v. Cannon, 347\r\n  S.C. 75, 552 S.E.2d 767 (Ct. App. 2001).\r\nPublic policy\r\n  suggests that â€œSouth Carolina, as parens patriae, protects and\r\n  safeguards the welfare of its children. Family Court is vested with the\r\n  exclusive jurisdiction to ensure that, in all matters concerning a child, the\r\n  best interest of the child is the paramount consideration.â€ Harris v. Harris,\r\n  307 S.C. 351, 353, 415 S.E.2d 391, 393 (1992) (citation omitted). Â â€œThis principle\r\n  is founded upon the state's duty to protect those of its citizens who are\r\n  unable because of infancy to take care of themselves, and on the right of the\r\n  child, as citizen and ward, to the stateâ€™s protection.â€ Cook v. Cobb,\r\n  271 S.C. 136, 145, 245 S.E.2d 612, 617 (1978) (citation omitted).Â  Nothing in\r\n  the record herein suggests that the interests of the children were ever considered.[8]Â  \r\nAn\r\n  accurate determination of paternity not only significantly affects the\r\n  interests of the parents or alleged parents of the children, but also\r\n  significantly affects the interests of the children both now and in the future.\r\n  Â A conclusion that parentage was adjudicated in the first proceeding based on\r\n  principles of finality is indeed troubling, especially when considering the\r\n  fundamental interests involved herein. Significant changes in testing\r\n  procedures, including DNA analysis, have been developed since many of these\r\n  principles were adopted and these tests allow more certainty in the\r\n  determination of parentage.Â  Moreover, knowledge of a biological parent is\r\n  important for purposes of medical history, genetic defects, inheritance rights\r\n  and other matters; all of these considerations are best left to the family court.\r\nNothing\r\n  herein should be construed as a finding by this court as to a bright line test\r\n  in which to consider the issues presented. Â We specifically decline to do so in\r\n  the absence of a well-developed record. Â We state only that these decisions\r\n  cannot be made in a vacuum based on strict notions of finality or upon assumption\r\n    and speculation about the best interests of the children.Â  That decision is\r\n  properly one for the learned judges of the family court after balancing the\r\n  interests of all parties involved, including the children, as well as any equitable\r\n  circumstances presented that would warrant equitable relief if the court\r\n  determines, after development of the record, that equitable relief is\r\n  appropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nHaving considered the\r\n  record on appeal, we hereby reverse the order of dismissal for lack of\r\n  jurisdiction and remand the matter so that the family court may allow the\r\n  parties to fully develop the record on the issues presented consistent with our\r\n  decision.Â  Once developed, the court must adequately balance the competing\r\n  interests of all those involved as well as any equitable circumstances\r\n  presented in the case and evaluate the applicability of the various exceptions\r\n  to res judicata and collateral estoppel.[9]Â \r\n  While this court acknowledges the policy consideration which thrives for\r\n  finality of judgments, the equities of a case may be just as significant in\r\n  overriding such finality.Â  This especially rings true when the issue before the\r\n  court is a determination of something so fundamental as the identity of a\r\n  biological parent.Â  Further, because the children have an identifiable interest\r\n  in a determination of parentage and the proceedings herein, the court on remand\r\n  should consider whether the appointment of a guardian ad litem is appropriate.[10]\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nHUFF, J., and GOOLSBY, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We have omitted the names of the parents and children\r\nfrom our opinion.\r\n[2] The court never addressed the arguments that it\r\nlacked in personam jurisdiction over the parties.\r\n[3] This court denied Mr. Tâ€™s motion to argue against\r\n  published precedent for two reasons.Â  First, this court, sitting as a three\r\n  judge panel, lacks the authority to rule against prior published precedent\r\n  without en banc review.Â Â  Second, as discussed herein, the case at hand is\r\n  distinguishable from the precedent set by Mr. G v. Mrs. G, 320 S.C. 305,\r\n  465 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995), and the present case on appeal can be resolved\r\nwithout review of the precedent in Mr. G.Â  \r\n[4] See Bankerâ€™s Mortg. Co. v. U.S., 423 F.2d 73, 77 (5th Cir. 1970); U.S. v. Buck, 281 F.3d 1336, 1342 (10th\r\nCir. 2002).\r\n[5] Further, we note the South Carolina Supreme Court has\r\n  adopted the intrinsic/extrinsic fraud distinction in an independent action\r\n  context.Â  However, that case dealt with the issue of fraud and not the other\r\n  aspects of Rule 60 or an independent action based on special circumstances\r\n  outside the context of fraud.Â  See Chewning v. Ford Motor Co.,\r\n  354 S.C. 72, 579 S.E.2d 605 (2003).Â  Moreover, in Arnold v. Arnold, 285\r\n  S.C. 296, 328 S.E.2d 924 (Ct. App. 1985), the court reversed an order of\r\n  summary judgment as to a subsequent attack on paternity because the question of\r\n  fraud had not been adequately addressed.Â  However, Judge Goolsby, in dissent,\r\n  opined that Arnold failed to demonstrate any facts, which if proved, would\r\n  establish extrinsic fraud.Â  We only read Arnold as being procedural in\r\n  nature although recognizing on remand in that case the need to demonstrate the\r\nrequisite fraud necessary for relief since fraud was the issue presented.\r\n[6] We note that in Ray v. Ray, 374 S.C. 79, 82,\r\n  647 S.E.2d 237, 242 (2007), Justice Pleicones, in his dissent, recognized the\r\n  possibility of some exceptional circumstance involving intrinsic fraud which\r\n  would justify equitable relief.Â  He did not provide an example but such a\r\n  statement safeguards the broad inherent power of a court to effectuate equity\r\n  under the proper circumstances.Â  However, that dissent is not controlling as to\r\nour ruling herein.\r\n[7] Although this concept originated in the context of\r\n  collateral estoppel, South Carolina courts have applied the concept equally to\r\n  res judicata.Â  See State v. Bacote, 331 S.C. 328, 331, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  161, 163 (1998); Carrigg v. Cannon, 347 S.C. 75, 81, 552 S.E.2d 767, 770\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001); Nelson v. OHG, 354 S.C. 290, 315, 580 S.E.2d 171, 184\r\n(Ct. App. 2003) revâ€™d in part, 362 S.C. 421, 608 S.E.2d 855 (2005). \r\n[8] Mr. T requested the appointment of a GAL in his\r\n  complaint; however, the record does not indicate that a GAL was ever appointed\r\nto represent the interests of the children.\r\n[9] Because the family court did not address any issues\r\n  as to in personam jurisdiction, these issues are not properly preserved for our\r\n  review but the family court may address these matters on remand if raised by\r\nthe parties.\r\n[10] See also S.C.

Thomas Cooper, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 4370 \r\nHeard September 11, 2007 â€“ Filed April 17, 2008\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        A. Camden Lewis and Brady R. Thomas, both of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n        Pope D.\r\n          Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTHOMAS,\r\n  J.:Â  This is a legal malpractice action.Â  The trial judge granted partial summary\r\n  judgment to Respondents Kenneth B. Wingate and his law firm, Sweeney Wingate\r\n  &amp; Barrow, finding they did not owe a fiduciary duty to Deborah Spence (Wife)\r\n  concerning her late husbandâ€™s life insurance policy.Â  Wife appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nViewing the record in the light most\r\n  favorable to Wife, we find the following:Â  On August 13, 2001, Wingate commenced\r\n  legal representation of Wife.Â  The purpose of the representation was to\r\n  negotiate an agreement on Wifeâ€™s behalf with the four sons of her husband, Congressman\r\n  Floyd W. Spence, concerning the division of Spenceâ€™s probate estate.Â  Wife and Spenceâ€™s\r\n  sons entered into such an agreement on August 15, 2001.Â  During the course of\r\n  Wingateâ€™s representation of Wife, Wife also consulted with him about her\r\n  husbandâ€™s Federal Group Life Insurance Policy and informed him Spence had named\r\n  her as beneficiary.Â  On August 16, 2001, Spence died.Â  Either in mid-August or\r\n  early September, Wingate became the attorney for Spenceâ€™s estate.Â  \r\nIn 1988, Spence had named each of\r\n  his four sons and Wife as equal beneficiaries under the life insurance policy.Â \r\n  Shortly before his death, however, Spence attempted to make Wife the sole\r\n  beneficiary of the policy.Â  After Spence died, the Members Services Office of the\r\n  United States House of Representatives determined the proceeds of the policy\r\n  should be divided equally among Wife and the four sons and made payment accordingly.Â  \r\nWife brought this action against\r\n  Respondents, alleging negligence, professional negligence, breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty, and civil conspiracy.Â  After Respondents answered, they moved for partial\r\n  summary judgment, claiming they were not liable to Wife or Spenceâ€™s estate in\r\n  connection with Spenceâ€™s congressional life insurance policy.Â  Following a\r\n  hearing, the trial judge granted partial summary judgment to Respondents,\r\n  holding that â€œ[b]y statute, [Respondent] owed no duty or obligation to [Wife]\r\n  with respect to the congressional life insurance police or the manner in which\r\n  it was paid.â€ Â This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing a grant of summary judgment, the\r\n  appellate court uses the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.Â  Nexsen v. Haddock, 353 S.C. 74, 77, 576 S.E.2d 183, 185\r\n  (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Summary judgment should be granted when â€œthe pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Â Nevertheless, â€œ[a]n issue is not preserved where the trial\r\n  court does not explicitly rule on an argument and the appellant does not make a\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend the judgment.â€Â  Jones v. State Farm Mut.\r\n    Auto. Ins. Co., 364 S.C. 222, 235, 612 S.E.2d 719, 726 (Ct. App. 2005); see\r\n      also Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 565, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510\r\n  (2006) (â€œGenerally, an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the circuit\r\ncourt to be preserved.â€).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nOn appeal, Wife argues a genuine\r\n  issue of material fact exists as to whether Respondents breached a fiduciary\r\n  duty owed to her arising from Wingateâ€™s earlier representation of her in a\r\n  related matter.Â  Respondents contend this argument is not preserved for review\r\n  because the trial judge did not explicitly rule on this argument and Wife did\r\n  not move to alter or amend the appealed order on that ground.Â  In her reply\r\n  brief, Wife maintains no motion to alter or amend was necessary because the\r\n  sole argument she advanced as the basis for the existence of a fiduciary duty\r\n  was Respondentsâ€™ prior legal representation of her.Â  \r\nWe agree with Respondents that it\r\n  was incumbent on Wife to move under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, for a ruling on the\r\n  issue of whether Respondents owed her a fiduciary duty based on her status as\r\n  their former client in order to preserve this argument for appeal.Â  In granting\r\n  partial summary judgment to Respondents, the trial judge relied on South\r\n  Carolina Code section 62-1-109.Â  That section provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  Unless expressly provided otherwise in\r\n    a written employment agreement, the creation of an attorney-client relationship\r\n    between a lawyer and a person serving as a fiduciary shall not impose upon the\r\n    lawyer any duties or obligations to other persons interested in the estate,\r\n    trust estate, or other fiduciary property, even though fiduciary funds may be\r\n    used to compensate the lawyer for legal services rendered to the fiduciary.Â \r\n    This section is intended to be declaratory of the common law and governs\r\n    relationships in existence between lawyers and persons serving as fiduciaries\r\n    as well as such relationships hereafter created.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-109 (Supp. 2007).[1]Â \r\n  This statute provides only that a lawyerâ€™s representation of a fiduciary in a\r\n  probate matter does not, without more, impose on the lawyer responsibilities to\r\n  other parties with interests in the fiduciary property.Â  It does not address\r\n  whether attorneys representing fiduciaries could be accountable to such claimants\r\n  for other reasons.\r\nEven if, as Wife asserts, the only\r\n  argument she offered in opposition to the summary judgment motion was that\r\n  Respondents owed her a fiduciary duty regarding Spenceâ€™s life insurance policy\r\n  because she had consulted with Wingate in the past about the matter, the trial judge\r\n  apparently overlooked the prior attorney-client relationship.Â  A careful\r\n  examination of the appealed order indicates the trial judge considered only (1)\r\n  Wingateâ€™s later role as the attorney for Spenceâ€™s estate, and (2) the fact that\r\n  Wingate did not represent Wife individually at the time of Spenceâ€™s death.Â  The\r\n  trial judge did not mention Wifeâ€™s alternative theory of liability that, as a former\r\n  client of Respondents, she had a continuing fiduciary relationship with them\r\n  that would not be affected by section 62-1-109.Â  There is nothing in the\r\n  appealed order suggesting the trial judge determined this statute absolved\r\n  Wingate of all responsibilities to Wife regardless of when or how they arose. Â Absent\r\n  an explicit ruling on the argument Wife advances in her appeal, we cannot\r\n  disturb the trial judgeâ€™s decision. Â See Shealy v. Aiken County,\r\n  341 S.C. 448, 460, 535 S.E.2d 438, 444-45 (2000) (holding a general ruling by\r\n  the trial court is insufficient to preserve a specific issue for appellate\r\n  review); Van Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 446, 453, 523\r\n  S.E.2d 486, 490 (Ct. App. 1999) (stating a reviewing court cannot address an issue\r\n  on which there is an implicit rather than explicit ruling).\r\nUnder these circumstances, we cannot in good\r\n  conscience address the issue of whether Wingateâ€™s prior representation of Wife in\r\n  a related matter creates genuine issues of material fact as to whether\r\n  Respondents owed and breached a fiduciary duty to Wife.Â  The trial judge did\r\n  not rule on this argument and was never requested to correct this omission.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs.Â  HEARN, C.J., dissents\r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\nHEARN, C.J. (dissenting):\r\nI respectfully dissent.Â Â  I would hold the issue is\r\n  preserved for our review, and that the circuit court judge erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment on Wifeâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty claim.\r\nWifeâ€™s allegation that Wingate breached his fiduciary duty to her with regard\r\n  to Spenceâ€™s congressional life insurance policy was based upon their prior\r\n  attorney-client relationship.Â  As the majority opinion notes, and as Wingateâ€™s\r\n  counsel conceded during oral argument, Wifeâ€™s only argument in opposition to\r\n  Wingateâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the breach of fiduciary claim was this\r\n  prior attorney-client relationship.Â  Inexplicably, and erroneously, the circuit\r\n  court judge ruled that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-109 (Supp. 2005) precluded Wifeâ€™s\r\n  claim for breach of fiduciary duty, apparently believing that statute\r\n  completely resolved Wifeâ€™s argument concerning the partiesâ€™ prior\r\n  attorney-client relationship.Â Â Â  In its order, the circuit court stated:&nbsp;\r\n  â€œBy statute, [Wingate] owed no duty or obligation to [Wife] with respect to the\r\n  congressional life insurance policy or the manner in which it was paid.â€&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n  Because the issue of Wingateâ€™s prior representation of Wife was the only argument made by Wife in support of her claim for breach of fiduciary duty, and\r\n  because the circuit court ruled on this issue, a Rule 59(e) motion was\r\n  unnecessary.Â  See Elam v. South Carolina Department of\r\n    Transportation, 361 S.C. 9. 25, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (â€œCivil\r\n  procedure and appellate rules should not be written or interpreted to create a\r\n  trap for the unwary lawyer or party); Hardaway Concrete Co. Inc. v. Hall\r\n    Contracting Corp., 374 S.C. 216, 225, 647 S.E.2d 488, 493 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (holding a Rule 59(e) motion unnecessary to preserve an argument for appeal\r\n  where the issue was raised to, and ruled upon by the circuit court).\r\nOn\r\n  the merits, I would hold that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to\r\n  whether Wingate breached a fiduciary duty when he failed to advise or assist\r\n  Wife with the life insurance policy.Â  Accordingly, I believe the circuit court\r\n  erred in ruling that, as a matter of law, no duty was owed.\r\nâ€œA fiduciary relationship is founded on the trust\r\n  and confidence reposed by one person in the integrity and fidelity of\r\n  another.â€Â  Moore v. Moore, 360 S.C. 241, 250, 599 S.E.2d 467, 472\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).Â  â€œAn attorney/client relationship is by nature a fiduciary\r\n  one.â€Â  Hotz v. Minyard, 304 S.C. 225, 230, 403 S.E.2d 634, 637 (1991).Â \r\n  â€œOne standing in a fiduciary relationship with another is subject to liability\r\n  to the other for harm resulting from a breach of duty imposed by the\r\n  relation.â€Â  Smith v. Hastie, 367 S.C. 410, 417, 626 S.E.2d 13, 17 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2005).\r\nHere, it is undisputed that Wingate represented\r\n  Wife while negotiating an agreement between her and Spenceâ€™s sons regarding\r\n  Spenceâ€™s probate estate.Â  During that representation, Wife alleges she informed\r\n  Wingate of her status as sole beneficiary under her husbandâ€™s life insurance\r\n  policy.Â  Soon thereafter, Wife was told Wingate had become the attorney for her\r\n  husbandâ€™s estate.Â  However, Wife alleges that Wingate never severed their\r\n  attorney-client relationship.Â  Wife claims that when Wingate informed her he\r\n  was going to be the attorney for her husbandâ€™s estate, he told her that she no\r\n  longer needed a lawyer.Â  At a subsequent family meeting, Wife claims Wingate\r\n  suggested she give the sons the entire life insurance policy, despite his\r\n  knowledge that Spence had designated her as the sole beneficiary.Â  Upon hearing\r\n  this suggestion, Wife alleges she asked Wingate â€œto put his hat back on as\r\n  [her] attorney and help [her].â€Â  According to Wife, Wingate refused to assist\r\n  her.\r\nBased on these allegations, there is evidence to\r\n  support Wifeâ€™s claim that a fiduciary relationship existed between her and\r\n  Wingate, and that Wingate breached this fiduciary duty.Â  Wingate had been her\r\n  attorney, and in that capacity, she discussed with him her claim to Spenceâ€™s\r\n  life insurance.Â  Thereafter, Wife alleges Wingate began representing the estate\r\n  without severing their attorney-client relationship, advised her not to obtain\r\n  a new attorney, refused to counsel her on how to claim her benefits, and even\r\n  suggested she give up all of her rights under the policy.Â  While a jury may\r\n  ultimately find Wingate committed no wrongdoing, I would hold the circuit court\r\n  erred in making that determination as a matter of law.\r\nAccepting Wifeâ€™s allegations as true, as we must\r\n  when reviewing an order granting summary judgment, Wingate, as Wifeâ€™s attorney,\r\n  owed her certain fiduciary duties.Â  Hotz, 304 S.C. at 230, 403 S.E.2d at\r\n  637.Â  These duties are distinct from any duties arising from Wingateâ€™s\r\n  representation of the estate.Â  Therefore, I would hold the allegations by Wife\r\n  are sufficient to present a genuine issue of material fact for the jury to determine\r\n  whether Wingateâ€™s conduct amounted to a breach of a fiduciary duty.Â  See Id. (concluding summary judgment was improperly granted where evidence\r\n  indicated a factual issue existed as to whether a fiduciary duty had been\r\n  breached). [2]\r\nAccordingly, I would REVERSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The trial court cited the version appearing in the\r\n  2005 supplement of the South Carolina Code, which is identical to that\r\n  appearing in the 2007 supplement.\r\n[2] I note that Wifeâ€™s allegations also support damages\r\n  caused by Wingateâ€™s breach of fiduciary duty. Â Specifically, Wife claims that\r\n  as a result of Wingateâ€™s breach, the insurance benefits were divided five ways\r\n  among Wife and her husbandâ€™s four sons instead of being paid solely to her.Â \r\n  Moreover, Wife claims that had Wingate not breached this fiduciary duty, and\r\n  either helped her file a declaratory judgment or advised her to hire another\r\n  lawyer, she would not have suffered these damages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4371","title":"State v.

Â On December 30, 2003, the night of the shooting, Anderson and Sims\r\n  attended a birthday party, and Anderson gave Sims a ride home.Â  The two men\r\n  engaged in a conversation about their past disagreements, and Anderson spoke of\r\n  taking care of his â€œbeefsâ€ before the New Year.Â  Previously, the men were in a\r\n  dispute over whether Sims owed Anderson money.Â  Sims testified, during their\r\n  ride home, he believed Anderson was reaching under his seat to obtain a firearm\r\n  and Sims fatally wounded Anderson with a weapon he had on his person.Â  Sims\r\n  recounted the events:\r\n\r\n  We was\r\n    talking about past arguments that we had.Â  He was telling me that he had all\r\n    these â€“ all these different guns.Â  He started telling me about how â€“ he started\r\n    telling me about how he could have then have brought harm to me and my family,\r\n    how he could have then have brought harm to me and my family.\r\n  So . . .\r\n    when we was pulling up my driveway, he was telling me that I was taking â€“ I was\r\n    taking food out â€“ out his unborn baby, out his unborn babyâ€™s mouth.Â  He said\r\n    that I was taking food out his unborn babyâ€™s mouth.\r\n  And when\r\n    he stopped the car he was telling me that â€“ he was telling me that he was going\r\n    to take care of all his beefs before the New Year.Â  He was telling me that he\r\n    was going to â€“ that he was going to end all his beefs before the New Year, that\r\n    he was going to end all his beefs before the New Year.\r\n  And he\r\n    was reaching underneath his seat.Â  So I thought he was fixing to â€“ he was\r\n    fixing to grab him a gun to shoot me.Â  So I pulled out my gun.Â  Out of fear I\r\n    shot.\r\n  . . . \r\n  . . . I\r\n    thought he was reaching for his gun.Â  So I thought he was reaching for his gun\r\n    to shoot me and kill me.Â  So out of fear I pulled my gun out and shot.\r\n\r\nWhen\r\n  asked by his counsel whether he intended to kill Anderson, Sims replied:\r\n\r\n  No.Â  I\r\n    didnâ€™t mean to kill him.Â  I was pulling my gun out because I thought he was\r\n    fixing to kill me.Â  I guess just out of â€“ out of fear I shot.\r\n\r\nSims\r\n  enlisted his girlfriend, Natalie English; his friend, Derrick Ruff; and Ruffâ€™s\r\n  girlfriend, Nikki Davis, to hide the body and dispose of the remaining\r\n  evidence.Â  During her direct examination by the State, Davis proffered:\r\n\r\n  Well, it\r\n    was like around 3 something in the morning and I heard a knock at the door.Â \r\n    And I wasnâ€™t going to answer the door.Â  I was like, Derrickâ€™s mom just kept,\r\n    you know, telling me to open the door.Â  So I went and I opened the door.Â  And\r\n    Keith came in with Natalie with his arm folded.\r\n  . . .\r\n  He told\r\n    me to wake up â€œBlackâ€, which is Derrick, and I told him I canâ€™t get him up.Â \r\n    You just â€“ you get him up yourself, basically.Â  So he started hitting on\r\n    Derrick, you know, to get him up.Â  And Derrick got up. . . .\r\n  . . . \r\n  So he\r\n    started hitting him to get him up.Â  And Derrick finally got up and told him,\r\n    you know, to go in the back.Â  And they went to the back and they started\r\n    talking.Â  Which Natalie, you know, she was already in.Â  She came.Â  She sat â€“\r\n  . . .\r\n  So I\r\n    just started rubbing her back and telling her that everything was going to be\r\n    all right and stuff.Â  And she wouldnâ€™t tell me.Â  I kept asking her what was\r\n    going on.Â  She wouldnâ€™t tell me what was going on.Â  And so she asked me if I\r\n    wanted to go to Charleston.Â  And I told her, yeah, I needed to go to Charleston because at the time I was two months pregnant with my daughter and I needed to\r\n    get my Medicaid card and my social security card and stuff like that.Â  So I\r\n    told her, yeah, I was going to go.Â  So I started getting dressed and stuff like\r\n    that.Â  And then at that time Keith came out first, and Derrick he was still in\r\n    the kitchen or whatever.Â  And Keith asked me whether or not I was going or\r\n    not.Â  I told him, yeah, I was going.Â  And he asked me if they had â€“ if we had\r\n    any bricks or anything like that.Â  So I told him, I donâ€™t know.Â  Just go look in\r\n    the backyard.\r\n  . . .\r\n  . . .\r\n    And we went to a Shell station afterwards.Â  And Derrick got out to get gas.Â \r\n    And at the time it was just â€“ and Natalie got out and she went in the store.Â \r\n    And at the time it was just me and Keith inside the car.Â  And, you know, I was\r\n    joking with him and stuff, just like, why didnâ€™t you get me anything for my\r\n    birthday and stuff like that.Â  You know, he gave me $10 for my birthday or\r\n    whatever.Â  And he told me to go inside the store to make sure Natalie was\r\n    getting everything that he told them to get.\r\n  So I got\r\n    out of the car and I went and I just peeked my head inside the store.Â  And at\r\n    that time she had, you know, like the gloves and stuff like on top of the\r\n    counter.Â  So I figured thatâ€™s what he told her to get.Â  And I came back out\r\n    into the car.Â  And everybody came and they got inside the car.Â  And then we\r\n    headed to â€“ \r\n  . . .\r\n  And we\r\n    parked right in front of the ladyâ€™s house.Â  And I just figured that they were\r\n    going to go.Â  And so we all were going to go inside the house.Â  But me and\r\n    Natalie stayed inside the car and Keith and Derrick got out.Â  And they started\r\n    toting like this long thing I guess to a car, and a chain, you know, some\r\n    bricks, just toting it to the back of the house right behind me.\r\n  . . .\r\n  The next\r\n    thing I knew he [Sims] sped from behind the house inside of another car.Â  And\r\n    thatâ€™s when I, you know, started pushing Natalie.Â  Iâ€™m asking her whatâ€™s going\r\n    on?Â  Did he steal a car or whatâ€™s going on?Â  Where did he that from and stuff\r\n    like that.Â  And then she told me, you know, Keith had murdered somebody. . . . \r\n  . . . \r\n  Keith\r\n    dragged him out and he started to drag him by himself but I guess he couldnâ€™t\r\n    do it.Â  And Derrick started to help.Â  And they got like just a little bit with\r\n    the â€“ he had just got a little bit with the guy and then Derrick came back and\r\n    got Natalie.Â  And Natalie told me to come on.Â  And â€“ and while we were â€“ or\r\n    when I got out of the car Keith was â€“ he told me to put my socks on my hands,\r\n    which I just did what he said.Â  I put my socks on my hands.Â  And Natalie\r\n    grabbed one leg and I grabbed the other. . . . \r\n  . . . \r\n  We just\r\n    started dragging him.Â  And we just dragged him â€˜til we â€“ we got like to this\r\n    little balcony thing.Â  And then the guy was just laying like flat on the\r\n    ground.Â  And Keith was just saying things to him.Â  And we were just trying to\r\n    get him â€“ we were just trying to get him through.\r\n  . . .\r\n  . . . So\r\n    he said that our next best thing was to just try to lift him up.Â  So we lifted\r\n    him up and it took a while.Â  And we just finally got him over.Â  And everybody\r\n    just ran or walked off and never looked back.Â  But before â€“ while we was\r\n    walking off, Keith stayed and I heard a splash.Â  And I just walked back to the\r\n    car.Â  And they got back into the car.Â  And Keith brought some things to the car\r\n    inside a paper bag.Â  And I looked inside the bag and there was a cellphone and\r\n    a chain and the guyâ€™s wallet.\r\n  . . .\r\n  And we\r\n    left there and just kept on going.Â  And somewhere during that time we â€“ he\r\n    [Sims] told me to get rid of it [the contents of the paper bag].Â  Actually he\r\n    told me to get ride of it. . . .\r\n\r\nSims objected to Davis being permitted to testify English said â€œKeith had murdered somebody,â€ arguing it\r\n  was hearsay.Â  The trial court overruled the objection without comment.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the trial judge err in allowing one co-conspirator to testify to another\r\n  co-conspiratorâ€™s statement relating Simsâ€™ own statement of guilt,\r\n  characterizing it as non-hearsay, and finding it was calculated to induce\r\n  participation in disposing of the victimâ€™s body and other evidence?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œIn\r\n  criminal cases, the appellate court sits to review errors of law only.â€Â  State\r\n    v.

United States, 315 U.S. 60, 62 S.Ct. 457, 86\r\n    L.Ed. 680 (1942), the declarations of one conspirator made in\r\n    furtherance of the objects of the conspiracy to a third party are admissible\r\n    against all of the members, but only after proof that each defendant was a\r\n    member of the conspiracy.\r\n  Under Glasser there was a preferred order of\r\n    proof; nonhearsay which established membership in the conspiracy must precede the hearsay\r\n    declarations.Â  However, order of proof is\r\n    discretionary with the trial judge and declarations made by a conspirator to a\r\n    third party may be admitted in advance of evidence which would prima facie\r\n    establish the existence of the conspiracy.Â  State v. Rutledge, 261 S.C. 44, 198 S.E.2d 250\r\n    (1973); In accord: United States v. Vaught, supra.\r\n  . . . Moreover, once a conspiracy has been\r\n    established,\r\n  â€œ[E]vidence\r\n    establishing beyond a reasonable doubt a connection of a defendant with the\r\n    conspiracy, even though the connection is slight, is sufficient to convict him\r\n    with knowing participation in the conspiracy. United States v. Dunn, 564 F.2d 348, 357 (9th Cir.\r\n      1977).â€ \r\n  United States v. Jabara, 618 F.2d 1319, 1328 (9th Cir.\r\n    1980).\r\n\r\nState\r\n  v. Gilchrist, 342 S.C. 369, 372, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 869 (2000), superseded Sullivan in a footnote:\r\n\r\n  Rule\r\n    801(d)(2)(E) provides that a statement by a co-conspirator during\r\n    the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy is not hearsay.Â  Under the\r\n    Federal Rules of Evidence, this same rule has been interpreted to allow\r\n    admission of a co-conspirator's statement only where there is evidence of the\r\n    conspiracy independent of the statement sought to be admitted.Â  See,\r\n      e.g., United States v. Asibor, 109 F.3d 1023 (5th Cir. 1997); United States v. Clark, 18 F.3d 1337 (6th Cir. 1994); United States v. Smith, 893 F.2d 1573 (9th Cir. 1990); United States v. Urbanik, 801 F.2d 692 (4th Cir. 1986).FN1Â  Here, there is no independent evidence of a\r\n    conspiracy between Robertson and appellant.Â  The fact that Robertson was indicted for criminal conspiracy is not sufficient in itself to establish a conspiracy\r\n    since an indictment is not evidence of the crime charged.Â  41 Am.Jur.2d\r\n      INDICTMENTS AND INFORMATIONS Â§ 1.\r\n  \r\n    FN1. Before enactment\r\n      of the SCRE, precedent of this Court indicates that prima facia evidence of a\r\n      conspiracy was required to support the admission of a co-conspirator's\r\n      statement.Â  State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 282 S.E.2d 838 (1981).\r\n  \r\n  Further, a statement by a co-conspirator must advance\r\n    the conspiracy to be admissible under Rule\r\n      801(d)(2)(E). State v. Anders, 331 S.C. 474, 503 S.E.2d 443 (1998) (admission to crime does not qualify as statement in furtherance of\r\n    conspiracy).FN2Â  \r\n  \r\n    FN2. As explained in United States v. Arias-Villanueva, 998 F.2d 1491, 1502 (9th Cir. 1993):\r\n    While\r\n      mere conversation or narrative declarations are not admissible under this rule,\r\n      statements made to induce enlistment, further participation, prompt further action,\r\n      allay fears, or keep coconspirators abreast of an ongoing conspiracy's\r\n      activities are admissible.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAn\r\n  example of a statement by a co-conspirator being inadmissible as hearsay is\r\n  found in State v. Anders, 331 S.C. 474, 476, 503 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1998).\r\n  Â In Anders, a witness overheard one of the conspirators (Simmons) say\r\n  â€˜â€œRobert [Anders] was going to pay him big for blowing up the building.â€â€™Â  Id.Â  Additionally, the witness heard Simmons explain how he set the fire.Â  Id.Â  â€œThe trial court ruled the statements were admissible against Anders on the\r\n  basis they were made by Simmons in the furtherance of a conspiracy, so as to be\r\n  admissible against both Anders and Simmons.â€Â  Id.Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  ultimately affirmed in result, but â€œheld Simmonsâ€™ statement was not admissible\r\n  under the co-conspirator exception since, even if made during the\r\n  conspiracy, the statement in no way advanced the conspiracy.â€Â  Id. at 476-477, 503 S.E.2d at 444 (emphasis in original).Â  The Supreme Court\r\n  reversed the Court of Appeals, but agreed with the characterization of the\r\n  statement as not falling under the co-conspirator exception to the rule against\r\n  hearsay:Â  \r\n\r\n  We agree with the Court of\r\n    Appeals' holding that Simmons' admission to the crime in no way furthered the\r\n    conspiracy.Â  Accord United States v. Posner, 764 F.2d 1535 (11th Cir.1985), cert. denied (although statements made to â€œallay suspicionsâ€ may be â€œin furtheranceâ€ of\r\n    conspiracy, â€œspilling the beansâ€ does not further conspiracy); United States v. Pallais, 921 F.2d 684 (7th Cir.1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 842,\r\n      112 S.Ct. 134, 116 L.Ed.2d 101 (1991) (casual admissions of\r\n    culpability are not â€œin furtheranceâ€ of conspiracy and are insufficiently\r\n    reliable to be considered by the jury).Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals\r\n    correctly ruled the statement was not admissible under the co-conspirator\r\n    exception.Â  See State v. Sullivan, 277 S.C. 35, 42, 282 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1981) (exception to rule against hearsay permits statements of one conspirator made\r\n    during the pendency of the conspiracy, and in furtherance thereof, to be\r\n    admitted against a co-conspirator once prima facie evidence of a conspiracy is\r\n    proved); see also South\r\n      Carolina Rules of Evidence, Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\r\n\r\nId. at 477, 503 S.E.2d at 444.\r\nMore\r\n  recently, a case involving hearsay and co-conspiratorâ€™s statements is State\r\n    v. Anderson, 357 S.C. 514, 517, 593 S.E.2d 820, 821 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The\r\n  State alleged Anderson conspired with Jamal Manick and Fred Moss to rob the\r\n  victim.Â  Id. at 515, 593 S.E.2d at 820.Â  Bobby Lukie rode with Moss and\r\n  Manick to the restaurant where Manick shot and killed Lamont Rappley.Â  Id. at 516, 593 S.E.2d at 821.Â  Similarly to the case at hand, Anderson presents a situation where a co-conspirator testified for the State[1]:\r\n\r\n  At trial, Lukie testified that around 11:00 p.m. on the night of\r\n    the murder, he drove by a convenience store and noticed Ross and Manick\r\n    standing outside the store.Â  Lukie stated that when he asked Ross and Manick\r\n    what they were doing, Ross told him â€œthey had a lick or something like that.â€Â \r\n    Defense counsel objected, arguing this testimony was hearsay.Â  The State argued\r\n    the testimony was admissible as non-hearsay because the statement was made in\r\n    furtherance of the conspiracy.Â  The trial court agreed and overruled the\r\n    defense's objection.\r\n\r\nId. at 517, 593 S.E.2d at 821.Â  Discussing hearsay and the\r\n  co-conspirator exception, the Court of Appeals inculcated:\r\n\r\n  Rule\r\n    801(d)(2)(E), SCRE, provides that â€œa statement by a coconspirator of\r\n    a party during the course and in furtherance of the conspiracyâ€ is not\r\n    hearsay.Â  See also State v. Gilchrist, 342 S.C. 369, 371, 536 S.E.2d 868, 869 (2000) (noting that Rule\r\n      801(d)(2)(E) allows for the admission of a coconspirator's statement\r\n    where there is evidence of the conspiracy independent of the statement sought\r\n    to be admitted).Â  Here, there was evidence presented at trial that Ross and\r\n    Manick conspired with [Anderson] to rob and murder the victim.Â  The statements\r\n    allegedly made to Lukie by Ross were sufficient to allow the jury to reasonably\r\n    infer that the statements were made in furtherance of the conspiracy,\r\n    especially in light of the fact that Lukie agreed to accompany Ross and Manick\r\n    in their robbery of the victim.Â  Accordingly, we find no error in the trial\r\n    court's ruling that the statement was not hearsay.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nIn\r\n    the case sub judice, there was evidence presented, in the form of\r\n    Davisâ€™ own testimony, indicating Davis, Sims, English and Ruff had a mutual\r\n    understanding and conspired to hide Andersonâ€™s body and dispose of all\r\n    remaining evidence of the shooting.Â  While Davisâ€™ testimony implies she knew\r\n    nothing of Andersonâ€™s death until the statement by English, her testimony\r\n    directly prior to the statement is sufficient to show she knew or should have\r\n    known the scope of the conspiracy.Â  Additionally, her conduct subsequent to\r\n    Englishâ€™s statement proves her involvement in the conspiracy.Â  Thus, Englishâ€™s\r\n    statements are admissible as non-hearsay against all four individuals,\r\n    including Sims.Â  The statement was sufficient to allow a jury to reasonably\r\n    infer it was made to induce enlistment, advance participation, or prompt additional\r\n    action on Davisâ€™ part in furtherance of the conspiracy to hide the details of Andersonâ€™s death, especially in light of the fact Davis was already acting in collusion\r\n    with English, Sims and Ruff.Â  Consequently, we find no error in the admission\r\n    of Davisâ€™ testimony.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nÂ  We\r\n  rule the trial judge properly allowed one co-conspirator to testify to another\r\n  co-conspiratorâ€™s statement relating to appellantâ€™s own statement of guilt\r\n  because the statement was calculated to induce participation in the combined\r\n  and joint effort to dispose of the victimâ€™s body, the gun, and other evidence\r\n  of murder.Â  We hold the statement was NOT hearsay, but\r\n  constituted relevant and admissible probative evidence in this murder.Â \r\n  ACCORDINGLY, the conviction and sentence of the appellant are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nSHORT and THOMAS,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Moss testified the phrase â€œhaving a lickâ€ meant they\r\ncould rob the victim.Â  Id. at 516, 593 S.E.2d at 821.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4372","title":"Robinson v.

Markley Dennis, Jr., Circuit Court\r\n  Judge\r\nOpinion No. 4372\r\nSubmitted February 1, 2008 â€“ Filed April\r\n  18, 2008\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tGeorge J. Morris and Walter Bilbro, Jr., both\r\n  of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tLouis H. Lang, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.:Â  In\r\n  this action to quiet title, Kathleen Brown, along with the other named\r\n  appellants, appeals an order granting summary judgment to Daniel Duggan.Â  We\r\n  affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants\r\n  filed a complaint and lis pendens on February 1, 2005, to quiet\r\n  title to approximately 28.6 acres of heirsâ€™ property.Â  On January 24, 2006, both\r\n  the complaint and lis pendens were amended to list numerous other\r\n  parties with potential claims to the property. \r\nIdentified as part of the 28.6 acres was a 0.540-acre parcel (the\r\n  Duggan Property) conveyed by Robert L. Tuttle to Duggan in 2003.Â  Tuttle and\r\n  Christl Gehring acquired the Duggan Property in 2002 pursuant to a judgment of\r\n  foreclosure and sale in 2000.Â  Shortly after the judicial sale, Gehring\r\n  conveyed her interest in the property to Tuttle. \r\nIn their amended complaint, Appellants requested the 2000\r\n  foreclosure be set aside because of ineffective service of process on Kathleen\r\n  and Bobbie L. Brown, the mortgagors of Duggan Property when it went into\r\n  foreclosure.Â  On April 27, 2005, Duggan filed an answer in which he asserted\r\n  various affirmative defenses, including the doctrines of res judicata and\r\n  collateral estoppel and his status as a bona fide purchaser for value without\r\n  notice.Â  On February 28, 2006, Duggan filed a return and joinder to a summary\r\n  judgment motion filed by two other defendants in the case.[2]Â  In his return and joinder, Duggan\r\n  again asserted as affirmative defenses section 15-39-870, his status as a bona\r\n  fide purchaser for value without notice, and the doctrines of res judicata and\r\n  collateral estoppel.Â  \r\nIn response to Dugganâ€™s summary judgment motion, Appellants\r\n  submitted an affidavit from Keith Brown, Kathleen Brownâ€™s son, challenging\r\n  statements in the affidavits of service filed in the 2000 foreclosure action\r\n  that he was served on behalf of Kathleen and Bobbie Brown.Â  Specifically, Keith\r\n  stated that he was not the person served and that both Kathleen and Bobbie,\r\n  respectively his mother and sister, were incompetent at the time of the\r\n  foreclosure action and subsequent sale.Â  Appellants also submitted affidavits\r\n  from two relatives who supported Keithâ€™s assertion that Kathleen and Bobbie\r\n  were incompetent.\r\nThe trial judge found Appellantsâ€™ complaint about â€œirregularities\r\n  in the proceedingsâ€ could not overcome the â€œclear statutory imperativeâ€ of\r\n  section 15-39-870, under which the doctrine of res judicata would protect a\r\n  bona fide purchaser for value without notice.Â  Accordingly, summary judgment\r\n  was granted to Duggan.Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œSummary judgment is appropriate if the pleadings,\r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with\r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€ Â Moore v. Weinberg, 373 S.C. 209, 215-16, 644 S.E.2d 740 743 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  â€œSummary judgment is not appropriate where further inquiry into the facts of\r\n  the case is desirable to clarify the application of the law.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œ[W]hen plain, palpable, and indisputable facts exist\r\n  on which reasonable minds cannot differ, summary judgment should be granted.â€Â  Ellis v. Davidson, 358 S.C. 509, 518, 595 S.E.2d 817, 822 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the grant of summary judgment to Duggan was error because evidence of\r\n  ineffective service of process on Kathleen and Bobbie in the foreclosure\r\n  proceeding warranted reopening the 2000 foreclosure action and setting aside\r\n  the subsequent sale of the Duggan Property.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\tSouth Carolina Code\r\n  section 15-39-870 provides as follows: \r\n\t\r\n\t\tUpon the\r\n  execution and delivery by the proper officer of the court of a deed for any\r\n  property sold at a judicial sale under a decree of a court of competent\r\n  jurisdiction that proceedings under which such sale is made shall be deemed res\r\n  judicata as to any and all bona fide purchasers for value without notice,\r\n  notwithstanding such sale may not subsequently be confirmed by the court.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-870\r\n  (2005).Â  The rationale for the statute is the well established public policy of\r\n  protecting good faith purchasers and upholding the finality of a judicial sale.\r\n  Â See Cumbie v. Newberry, 251 S.C. 33, 37, 159 S.E.2d 915, 917\r\n  (1968) (stating â€œa sound public policy requires the validity of judicial sales\r\n  be upheld, if in reason and justice it can be doneâ€); Wooten v. Seanch,\r\n  187 S.C. 219, 222, 196 S.E 877, 878 (1937) (upholding a foreclosure sale in\r\n  which the mortgagee purchased the property sold and further stating that, to\r\n  set aside a sale, â€œthere must be such irregularity in\r\n  the proceedings as to show that the sale was not fairly made, or that appellant\r\n  was defrauded or misled to his injury and lossâ€).\r\nIn Cumbie\r\n  v. Newberry, the defaulting mortgagor received notice that his foreclosed\r\n  land was to be sold at public auction.Â  When the first bidder did not complete\r\n  the sale, the land was sold at a subsequent auction.Â  Notice of the second\r\n  auction was published, but the defaulting mortgagor did not receive personal\r\n  notice.Â  The defaulting mortgagor sought to rescind the sale, arguing lack of\r\n  personal jurisdiction. Â The supreme court stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  furtherance of [public policy] . . . a purchaser in good faith at a judicial\r\n  sale is not affected by irregularities in the proceedings or even error in the\r\n  judgment under which the sale is made; but is required at his peril only to\r\n  make inquiry as to the jurisdiction of the court which ordered the sale, and\r\n  whether all proper parties were before the court when the order was made. \r\n\r\nCumbie, 251 S.C. at 37, 159 S.E.2d at 917 (citations\r\n  omitted); see also 27 S.C. Jur. Mortgages Â§ 125 (1996) (â€œForeclosure\r\n  proceedings are res judicata as to any bona fide purchaser for value without\r\n  notice, even though the sale is not later confirmed by the court.â€).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold the requirements of section 15-39-870 were satisfied in this case.Â  First,\r\n  the Master had competent jurisdiction to execute and deliver the deed to the\r\n  Duggan Property pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure and sale by a â€œcourt of\r\n  competent jurisdiction.â€Â  In support of his motion for summary judgment, Duggan\r\n  submitted a series of documents, all of which were matters of public record,\r\n  indicating the judgment of foreclosure and sale and subsequent exchanges of\r\n  title to the Duggan property were properly executed.Â  Included in the documents\r\n  was the judgment of foreclosure and sale.Â  The judgment stated (1) service was\r\n  made upon defendants, Kathleen and Bobbie; (2) both Kathleen and Bobbie were in\r\n  default; (3) the attorneys of record were notified of the hearing; and (4)\r\n  neither Kathleen nor Bobbie was in the United States military service.Â  The\r\n  judgment further indicated the property was to be sold by the Charleston County\r\n  Master-in-Equity and listed the terms of the sale.Â  Duggan also provided a deed\r\n  from the Master conveying the property to Tuttle and Gehring and indicating the\r\n  property was sold pursuant to the judgment of foreclosure and sale.Â  \r\nSecond, Duggan was\r\n  a bona fide purchaser without notice.Â  To claim the status of a bona fide\r\n  purchaser, a party must show (1) actual payment of the purchase price of the\r\n  property, (2) acquisition of legal title to the property, or the best right to\r\n  it, and (3) a bona fide purchase, â€œi.e., in good faith and with integrity of dealing, without\r\n  notice of a lien or defect.â€Â  Spence v. Spence, 368 S.C. 106, 117,\r\n  628 S.E.2d 869, 874-75 (2006).Â  In addition, â€œ[t]he\r\n  bona fide purchaser must show all three conditionsâ€”actual payment, acquiring of\r\n  legal title, and bona fide purchaseâ€”occurred before he had notice of a title\r\n  defect or other adverse claim, lien, or interest in the property.â€Â  Id., 628 S.E.2d at 875. \r\nThere\r\n  appears to be no dispute that Duggan satisfied the first two conditions.Â  Appellants,\r\n  however, claim the Master lacked jurisdiction to sell the Duggan Property\r\n  because of defects in service, as evidenced by the affidavit of Keith Brown, in\r\n  which he denied receiving service copies of the foreclosure papers that were to\r\n  be served on Kathleen and Bobbie, and the affidavits from Brown and other relatives\r\n  stating Kathleen and Bobbie were incompetent.Â  Based on these affidavits, Appellants assert Kathleen and Bobbie were never properly notified of\r\n  the underlying foreclosure proceeding as required by Rule 4(d)(2) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  None of these affidavits, however, were\r\n  matters of record at the time of the foreclosure sale.\r\nAppellants\r\n  also argue Duggan presented no evidence that proper newspaper publication of\r\n  the foreclosure sale occurred or that John Doe or Jane Doe was named in the\r\n  foreclosure action to represent unknown parties, minors, incompetents, or persons\r\n  who could possibly be in the military, apparently suggesting these omissions\r\n  should have alerted Duggan that lawful service of process on all necessary parties\r\n  was lacking.Â  We, however, have found no specific rulings in the appealed order\r\n  on Appellantsâ€™ arguments concerning lack of newspaper publication or the\r\n  failure to name all necessary defendants in the foreclosure, and there is no\r\n  indication that Appellants moved to alter or amend on either of these grounds;\r\n  therefore, these issues are not preserved for appeal.Â  See Noisette\r\n    v. Ismail, 304 S.C. 56, 58, 403 S.E.2d 122, 124 (1991) (holding that, when the trial court does not explicitly\r\n  rule on an issue at trial and the appellant fails to move to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment on that ground, the issue is not properly before the appellate court\r\n  and should not be addressed). Â Moreover, there is no evidence that\r\n  either Duggan or his predecessors-in-title had notice, constructive or\r\n  otherwise, of Appellantsâ€™ claims that Kathleen and Bobbie were incompetent and\r\n  were not properly served in the foreclosure action.Â  Pursuant to section\r\n  15-39-870, then, we hold Dugganâ€™s title is not affected by Appellantsâ€™ claims\r\n  of defective service of process in the foreclosure action.\r\nIn light of our disposition, we need not address\r\n  Dugganâ€™s arguments concerning laches and abandonment as additional reasons to\r\n  uphold the grant of summary judgment.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340-41, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993)\r\n  (explaining the appellate court need not address a remaining issue when\r\n  resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nHEARN, C.J., and ANDERSON, J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant\r\n  to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Â Defendants Lisa M.

Partainâ€™s tort claim.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS  \r\nOn March 30, 2006,\r\n  Amos Keith Partain (Partain) purchased a vehicle from Upstate Automotive Group\r\n  (Upstate). Â Partain contends that he negotiated with Upstate for the purchase\r\n  of a specific black 2006 Nissan truck. Â During the negotiations, Partain claims\r\n  he visited the dealership several times and test-drove the truck he intended to\r\n  buy.\r\nUpon signing the\r\n  paperwork for the purchase and after participating in a â€œvehicle introduction,â€ Partain drove the truck home where he allegedly discovered that the truck in\r\n  his possession was not the one he had test-driven and had intended to buy.\r\nOn April 28, 2006, Partain filed a complaint against Upstate alleging that Upstate violated the\r\n  Unfair Trade Practices Act by selling Partain a different truck than the one he\r\n  had negotiated to purchase.Â  On May 8, 2006, Upstate filed a motion to dismiss\r\n  and to compel arbitration consistent with an arbitration agreement the parties\r\n  allegedly signed.\r\nAfter a hearing,\r\n  the circuit court denied the motion finding[1] that the claim was not arbitrable since the claim was a tort independent of the\r\n  contract and because the alleged tortious behavior was not reasonably\r\n  foreseeable. Â The court only addressed whether the nature of the claim herein\r\n  was covered by the arbitration clause and presumed the validity of the\r\n  arbitration clause. This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnless the parties agree otherwise, the question of\r\n  the arbitrability of a claim is for judicial determination. Chassereau v.\r\n    Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 644 S.E.2d 718 (2007). Â While\r\n  arbitrability determinations are subject to de novo review, appellate courts\r\n  will not reverse a circuit courtâ€™s factual findings if any evidence reasonably\r\n  supports the findings. Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach, Inc., 373 S.C.\r\n  14, 644 S.E.2d 663 (2007).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nUpstate argues that\r\n  the circuit court erred in determining that the arbitration agreement did not\r\n  apply to Partainâ€™s claim.Â  We agree.\r\nBoth federal and\r\n  state public policy strongly favor the arbitration of disputes. Chassereau\r\n    v. Global Sun Pools, Inc., 373 S.C. 168, 644 S.E.2d 718 (2007).Â  A court should\r\n  order arbitration, unless the court can say with positive assurance that the\r\n  arbitration clause is not susceptible to any interpretation covering the\r\n  dispute. Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d\r\n  110, 118 (2001).Â  â€œHowever, arbitration is a matter of contract, and a court\r\n  cannot require a party to submit to arbitration any dispute, which he has not\r\n  agreed to submit.â€ Aiken v. World Fin. Corp. of S.C., 373 S.C. 144, 148,\r\n  644 S.E.2d 705, 708 (2007). \r\nâ€œTo decide whether\r\n  an arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute a court must determine whether\r\n  the factual allegations underlying the claim are within the scope of the broad\r\n  arbitration clause, regardless of the label assigned to the claim.â€ S.C.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Great W. Coal (Kentucky), Inc., 312 S.C. 559, 563, 437\r\n  S.E.2d 22, 25 (1993). â€œAny doubts concerning the scope of the arbitration clause\r\n  should be resolved in favor of arbitration.â€ Id.Â  â€œA broadly-worded\r\n  arbitration agreement applies to disputes that do not arise under the governing\r\n  contract when a â€˜significant relationshipâ€™ exists between the asserted claims\r\n  and the contract in which the arbitration clause is contained.â€Â  Zabinski,\r\n  346 S.C. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119; see Long v. Silver, 248 F3d\r\n  381 (4th Cir. 2001).Â  However, â€œ[b]ecause even the most broadly worded arbitration\r\n  agreements still have limits founded in general principles of contract law,\r\n  [courts] will refuse to interpret any arbitration agreement as applying to\r\n  outrageous torts that are unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the context\r\n  of normal business dealings.â€ Aiken, 373 S.C. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709.\r\n\r\n\tIn the case at bar,\r\n  the pertinent part of the arbitration agreement states:\r\n\tBuyer/Lessee\r\n  acknowledges and agrees that all claims, demands, disputes or controversies of\r\n  every kind or nature that may arise between them concerning any of the\r\n  negotiations leading to the sale, lease or financing of the vehicle, terms and\r\n  provisions of the sale, lease or financing shall be settled by binding\r\n  arbitration conducted pursuant to the provision of 9 U.S.C. section 1 et. Seq.\r\n  and according to the Commercial Rules of the American Arbitration\r\n  Association[.] Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, it is the\r\n  intention of the buyer/lessee and the dealer to resolve by binding arbitration\r\n  all disputes between them concerning the vehicle[,] its sale, lease or\r\n  financing and its condition including disputes concerning the terms and condition\r\n  of the sale, lease or financing, the condition of the vehicle, any damage to\r\n  the vehicle, the terms and meaning of any of the documents signed or given in\r\n  connection with the sale, lease or financing, any representations, promises or\r\n  omissions made in connection with the negotiations for the sale, lease or\r\n  financing of the vehicle, or any terms, conditions or representations made in\r\n  connection with the financing, credit life insurance, disability insurance and\r\n  vehicle extended warranty or service contract purchased or obtained in\r\n  connection with the vehicle. \r\n\r\nWe do not construe this\r\n  arbitration agreement as encompassing all claims that may arise between Partain\r\n  and Upstate. Rather, we interpret this clause as applying only to disputes\r\n  arising out of or relating to the underlying agreement. Accordingly, to compel\r\n  arbitration, a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ must exist between Partainâ€™s claim\r\n  and the contract containing the arbitration agreement. Vestry and Church\r\n    Wardens of Church of Holy Cross v. Orkin Exterminating Co., 356 S.C. 202,\r\n  209, 588 S.E.2d 136, 140 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nGenerally, regardless\r\n  of the label Partain assigns to the claim, the arbitration clause will apply if\r\n  the requisite relationship exists with the underlying agreement. See Great\r\n    W. Coal (Kentucky), 312 S.C. at 563, 437 S.E.2d at 25. The underlying\r\n  agreement between Upstate and Partain was for the sale of a vehicle. Partainâ€™s\r\n  claim is that Upstate, in executing the sale of the vehicle to Partain,\r\n  violated unfair trade practices.[2] The facts alleged by Partain are that he negotiated the purchase of a\r\n  particular black 2006 Nissan truck and subsequent to that sale, Upstate switched\r\n  vehicles and transferred a different vehicle to Partain than the one he had\r\n  negotiated to purchase. We find that whether Partain received the vehicle he\r\n  contracted to purchase is central to the agreement between Upstate and Partain.\r\n  Accordingly, a significant relationship in fact does exist between Partainâ€™s\r\n  unfair trade practice claim and the underlying agreement. \r\nHaving\r\n  found a significant relationship exists between Partainâ€™s claim and the\r\n  underlying agreement, we must next determine whether Upstateâ€™s actions\r\n  constituted â€œillegal and outrageous acts that [were] unforeseeable to a\r\n  reasonable consumer in the context of normal business dealings.â€ Chassereau,\r\n  373 S.C. at 172, 644 S.E.2d at 720.Â  Recently, our supreme court refused â€œto\r\n  interpret any arbitration agreement as applying to outrageous torts that are\r\n  unforeseeable to a reasonable consumer in the context of normal business\r\n  dealings.â€ Aiken, 373 S.C. at 151, 644 S.E.2d at 709. Â In Chassereau, the court held a provision in an installation agreement requiring any\r\n  disputes related to an above-ground swimming pool be subject to arbitration did\r\n  not encompass unforeseen acts of the installer's employee that were\r\n  historically associated with the tort of outrage. 373 S.C. 168, 644\r\n  S.E.2d 718. Â Similarly, in Aiken, the\r\n  court held that an arbitration clause in a loan agreement between borrower and\r\n  finance company did not apply to borrower's tort claims because the theft of\r\n  the borrowerâ€™s personal information was outrageous conduct that borrower could\r\n  not possibly have foreseen. 373 S.C.\r\n  144, 644 S.E.2d 705. Â These cases merely â€œseek to distinguish those outrageous torts,\r\n  which although factually related to the performance of the contract, are\r\n  legally distinct from the contractual relationship between the parties.â€ Id. at 152, 644 S.E.2d at 709.[3]\r\nIn the\r\n  present case, we find the conduct alleged does not meet the standard\r\n  established in Chassereau and Aiken.[4] Though the conduct alleged by\r\n  Partain, if true, is conduct this court would never condone or regard lightly,\r\n  when the underlying tort claim is significantly related to the contract and the\r\n  arbitration agreement is not violative of public policy, statutory law or the Constitution,\r\n  this court will compel arbitration consistent with the strong presumption in its\r\n  favor under our stateâ€™s policy. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe respectfully\r\n  conclude the circuit court erred in denying the motion to compel arbitration.\r\n  Since no other issues were raised as to the validity of the provision or\r\n  otherwise, the decision is hereby\r\nREVERSED.\r\nHEARN,\r\nC.J. and CURETON, A.J., concur.Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The circuit court made no findings upon the merits of\r\nthe allegations.\r\n[2] Partain did not assert a breach of contract claim or\r\nany other cause of action.\r\n[3] Moreover, in Simpson v. MSA of Myrtle Beach,\r\n  Inc., 373 S.C. 14, 27, 644 S.E.2d 663, 670, our Supreme Court indicated\r\n  that contracts between a consumer and automobile retailer may be viewed with\r\n  â€œconsiderable skepticism.â€Â  Notwithstanding, just as the supreme court\r\n  indicated that adhesion contracts are not per se unconscionable, the court did\r\n  not go so far as to indicate that similar consumer/automobile retailer\r\n  contracts are per se unconscionable.Â  The court reiterated that parties are\r\n  always free to â€œcontract away their rights.â€Â  Id., 373 S.C. at 28, 644\r\n  S.E.2d at 670.Â  The freedom to contract does not necessarily preclude an\r\n  attempt to set aside a contract based on various grounds including, but not limited\r\n  to, unconscionability.Â  However, unlike the Simpson case, the\r\n  arbitration provision herein was not attacked on grounds of unconscionability;\r\n  instead, the provision was presumed to be valid by the court.Â  On appeal,\r\nneither party has challenged the validity of the arbitration provision. \r\n[4] The trial court never made a specific finding as\r\n  to whether the alleged acts were outrageous under Chassereau and Aiken.\r\n  However, the court did find that the plaintiff could not have foreseen the\r\ntortious conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4374","title":"Wieters v.

Carroll, Dr. William B. Ellison, Jr., Dr. Jeffrey M. Deal\r\n  (Deal), and Sharron C. Kelly, Hospital and these individuals (collectively\r\n  Hospital Personnel) appeal an order compelling discovery.Â  Dr. Esther Lerman\r\n  Freeman (Freeman) is a defendant but not a party to this appeal.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nWieters is a physician licensed to practice in South Carolina.Â  His medical staff privileges were summarily suspended by Hospital.Â \r\n  Pursuant to the Hospitalâ€™s Medical Staff Bylaws, he was granted a hearing by a\r\n  committee of the medical staff and an appellate hearing before a committee of\r\n  the Hospitalâ€™s Board.Â  After each hearing, the respective committee upheld the\r\n  suspension.Â  \r\nAs required by federal law, Hospital reported Wietersâ€™\r\n  suspension to the National Practitioner Data Bank.Â  Wieters sued Hospital and\r\n  Hospital Personnel for defamation, alleging the report they transmitted to the\r\n  National Practioner Data Bank contained false information about him.Â  He\r\n  maintains Hospital, Hospital Personnel, and Freeman engaged in a conspiracy to\r\n  injure him.\r\nDuring discovery, Wieters, through his attorney,\r\n  deposed Deal and a non-party witness, Dr. Donald Pocock (Pocock).Â  Wieters\r\n  inquired about the circumstances that led to the summary suspension of other\r\n  physicians at Hospital, its affiliate Roper Hospital, and other hospitals where\r\n  the witnesses had worked.Â  Both Deal and Pocock testified how many physicians\r\n  they recall being suspended during their service on peer review committees, but\r\n  both deponents were instructed by their counsel or Hospitalâ€™s counsel to not\r\n  answer questions concerning what led to the other physiciansâ€™ suspensions,\r\n  citing the confidentiality provisions of South Carolinaâ€™s Peer Review Statute,\r\n  section 40-71-20 of the South Carolina Code.\r\nHospital and Hospital Personnel sought a protective\r\n  order pursuant to Rule 26, SCRCP.Â  Wieters moved to compel the witnesses to\r\n  answer the deposition queries.Â  The circuit court issued an order compelling\r\n  Deal and Pocock to answer general questions regarding other summary suspensions\r\n  without identifying the physicians involved.Â  The relevant section of the order\r\n  reads:\r\n\r\n\tDeposition questions not\r\n  answered.Â  This case is about, in\r\n  part, the information which related to a summary suspension of the plaintiff\r\n  doctor.Â  In deposition, witnesses Dr. Deal and Dr. Pocock were asked to provide\r\n  a general description of the circumstances which prompted other applications of\r\n  summary suspension.Â  All such information was refused, and the witnesses\r\n  instructed not to answer, citing privilege.Â  The Hospital defendants filed a\r\n  motion for a protective order claiming the information was protected peer\r\n  review citing S.C. Code Â§ 40-71-20 and McGee v. Bruce Hospital, 468\r\n  S.E.2d 633 (1996).\r\n\tThe information relates to\r\n  the claim of the plaintiff and should be provided.Â  The plaintiff has not\r\n  requested identifying information, only the nature of the circumstances that\r\n  gave rise to other applications of summary suspension, and no privilege\r\n  prohibits that information being provided.Â  The plaintiff may pose the\r\n  questions the witnesses were instructed not to answer, and to make any related\r\n  follow up questions.\r\n\r\nHospital and Hospital Personnel appeal the order\r\n  compelling Deal and Pocock to answer the deposition questions.[1]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tIs the circuit courtâ€™s order compelling discovery appealable?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\tDo the deposition questions unanswered by Deal and Pocock pertain to confidential committee proceedings protected by the Peer\r\n  Review Statute, South Carolina Code section 40-71-20?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA circuit\r\n  court judgeâ€™s rulings on discovery matters will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent a clear abuse of discretion.Â  Dunn v.

Greenville Terrazzo Co., Inc., 327 S.C. 538, 542, 489 S.E.2d 679, 681\r\n  (Ct.

App. 1984).Â  â€œAny judgment or decree, leaving\r\n  some further act to be done by the court before the rights of the parties are\r\n  determined, is interlocutory and not final.â€Â  Ex parte Wilson, 367 S.C.\r\n  7, 625 S.E.2d 205 (2005).\r\nAn\r\n  order directing a non-party to submit to discovery is not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  Lowndes Products, Inc. v. Brower, 262 S.C. 431, 205 S.E.2d\r\n  184 (1974).Â  Instead, a non-party must be held in contempt before an appeal may\r\n  be taken challenging the validity of the discovery order.Â  Ex parte\r\n    Whetstone, 289 S.C. 580, 347 S.E.2d 881 (1986).Â  \r\nAn\r\n  order compelling a party to submit to discovery is interlocutory and not\r\n  directly appealable.Â  Hamm v.

Graham, 357 S.C.\r\n  227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004).Â  Section 14-3-330 states:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law\r\n  in law cases, and shall review upon appeal:\r\n\t(1) Any\r\n  intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in\r\n  actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought\r\n  there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or\r\n  jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal\r\n  be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such\r\n  final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting\r\n  the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n\t(2) An\r\n  order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in\r\n  effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might\r\n  be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c)\r\n  strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action;\r\n\t(3) A\r\n  final order affecting a substantial right made in any special proceeding or\r\n  upon a summary application in any action after judgment; and\r\n\t(4) An\r\n  interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas granting, continuing,\r\n  modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting, continuing, modifying, or\r\n  refusing the appointment of a receiver.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2007).\r\nAn\r\n  order granting a motion to disqualify a partyâ€™s attorney in a civil case\r\n  affects a substantial right and may be immediately appealed.Â  Hagood v.\r\n    Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 607 S.E.2d 707 (2005).Â  Such an order must be\r\n  immediately appealed or any later objection in a subsequent appeal will be\r\n  waived.Â  Id.Â  The order to unseal the record of a divorce proceeding is\r\n  immediately appealable.Â  Ex parte Capital U-Drive-It, Inc., 369 S.C. 1,\r\n  8, 630 S.E.2d 464, 468 (2006) (â€œ[W]e agree with courts which have been inclined\r\n  to find such an order immediately appealable because, after a court file is\r\n  unsealed and the information released, no appellate remedy is likely to repair\r\n  any damage done by an improper disclosure.â€).Â  The denial of appellantâ€™s motion\r\n  to proceed anonymously meets the benchmark for appellate review.Â  Doe v.\r\n    Howe, 362 S.C. 212, 216, 607 S.E.2d 354, 356 (Ct.

Â McClanahan\r\n    v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002); Ray\r\n      Bell Constr. Co., Inc. v. Sch.

Farm Bureau Mut. Ins. Co. v. Mumford,\r\n  299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct.

AT &amp;\r\n    T Commcâ€™ns of S. States, Inc., 361 S.C. 576, 580, 606 S.E.2d 468, 470\r\n  (2004); Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v.

Â \r\nWhen a\r\n  statuteâ€™s terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there is no room for\r\n  statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according to its\r\n  literal meaning. Â Miller v. Aiken, 364 S.C. 303, 307, 613 S.E.2d 364,\r\n  366 (2005); Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314\r\n  S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994).Â  If a statuteâ€™s language is unambiguous\r\n  and clear, there is no need to employ the rules of statutory construction and\r\n  this Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning. Â Tilley v.\r\n    Pacesetter Corp., 355 S.C. 361, 373, 585 S.E.2d 292, 298 (2003); Paschal\r\n      v.

App. 1997) (â€œWhere the language of the statute is clear and explicit,\r\n  the court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not\r\n  in the legislatureâ€™s language.â€). Â What a legislature says in the text of a\r\n  statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Â Bayle,\r\n  344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 740 (Ct. App. 2001). Â The words of a statute\r\n  must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or\r\n  forced construction. Â Durham v. United Cos. Fin. Corp., 331 S.C.\r\n  600, 604, 503 S.E.2d 465, 468 (1998); Adkins v. Comcar Indus., Inc., 323\r\n  S.C. 409, 411, 475 S.E.2d 762, 763 (1996); Worsley Cos. v. S.C.

Â Under the plain\r\n  meaning rule, it is not the courtâ€™s place to change the meaning of a clear and\r\n  unambiguous statute. Â Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578,\r\n  581 (2000); Bayle, 344 S.C. at 122, 542 S.E.2d at 739.Â  \r\nIf the\r\n  language of an act gives rise to doubt or uncertainty as to legislative intent,\r\n  the construing court may search for that intent beyond the borders of the act\r\n  itself. Â Morgan, 352 S.C. at 367, 574 S.E.2d at 207; see also Wade\r\n    v. Berkeley County, 348 S.C. 224, 229, 559 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2002) (â€œ[W]here\r\n  a statute is ambiguous, the Court must construe the terms of the statute.â€). Â An\r\n  ambiguity in a statute should be resolved in favor of a just, beneficial, and\r\n  equitable operation of the law. Â Hudson, 336 S.C. at 247, 519 S.E.2d at\r\n  582; Brassell, 326 S.C. at 561, 486 S.E.2d at 495; City of Sumter Police Depâ€™t v.

Â In construing a statute, the court looks to the language\r\n  as a whole in light of its manifest purpose. Â State v. Dawkins, 352 S.C.\r\n  162, 166, 573 S.E.2d 783, 785 (2002); Adams v. Texfi Indus., 320\r\n  S.C. 213, 217, 464 S.E.2d 109, 112 (1995); Brassell, 326 S.C. at 560,\r\n  486 S.E.2d at 494.\r\nA\r\n  statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair\r\n  interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.\r\n  Â See Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. S.C. Second Injury Fund, 363\r\n  S.C. 612, 621, 611 S.E.2d 297, 301 (Ct.

Â A court should not\r\n  consider a particular clause in a statute as being construed in isolation, but\r\n  should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole statute and the\r\n  policy of the law.Â  See Liberty Mut.

Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-20\r\n  (Supp. 2007).\r\nDeal\r\n  and Pocock have been ordered by the circuit court to reveal knowledge learned\r\n  in their service on committees within the scope of South Carolina Code section\r\n  40-71-10.Â  The protections of the Peer Review Statute extend to:\r\n\r\n\tan\r\n  appointed member of a committee of a medical staff of a licensed hospital,\r\n  provided the medical staff operates pursuant to written bylaws that have been\r\n  approved by the governing board of the hospital&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. for any act\r\n  or proceeding undertaken or performed within the scope of the functions of the\r\n  committee&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-71-10\r\n  (Supp. 2007).\r\nThe\r\n  cognoscenti of health care nomology trust and rely upon Peer Review Statutes as\r\n  the quiddity and hypostasis of the hospital/physician relationship.Â  The\r\n  quintessence and elixir of the peer review process is confidentiality.Â  In\r\n  enacting the Peer Review Statute, the General Assembly struck a balance between\r\n  a litigantâ€™s need to know with the publicâ€™s interest in quality health care\r\n  through meaningful peer review.Â  The legislature stated that only in one narrow\r\n  circumstance does a litigant have access to peer review information, an â€œappeal\r\n  from the committee action.â€\r\nIf\r\n  peer review information is subject to compulsion beyond the narrow boundaries enacted\r\n  by the legislature, the foundation of the peer review process would be severely\r\n  compromised.Â  Without the promise of confidentiality of the information,\r\n  physicians would not fully and completely participate in the process or not\r\n  participate at all.Â  The lack of candor and openness would hinder and thwart\r\n  hospitals in their efforts to effectively monitor physicians.Â  This is not an\r\n  appeal from the committee action, so the exception to the confidentiality of\r\n  peer review information does not apply.\r\nIn McGee\r\n  v. Bruce Hospital System, the South Carolina Supreme Court expounded upon\r\n  the reasoning behind the Peer Review Statute, citing cases from West Virginia and Florida:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  overriding public policy of the confidentiality statute is to encourage health\r\n  care professionals to monitor the competency and professional conduct of their\r\n  peers to safeguard and improve the quality of patient care.Â  The underlying\r\n  purpose behind the confidentiality statute is not to facilitate the prosecution\r\n  of civil actions, but to promote complete candor and open discussion among\r\n  participants in the peer review process.\r\n\r\n312 S.C. 58, 61, 439 S.E.2d\r\n  257, 259 (1993) (citations omitted).Â  The Court found that the peer review\r\n  statute protects documents acquired by the committee of the medical staff as\r\n  part of its decision-making process.Â  Id. at 63, 439 S.E.2d at 260.\r\nThe\r\n  Court distinguished the committeeâ€™s decision-making process from its\r\n  consequence:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  find that the outcome of the decision-making process is not protected.Â \r\n  Permitting discovery of the effect of the committee proceedings does not\r\n  inhibit open discussion.Â  In our view, the confidentiality statute was intended\r\n  to protect the review process, but not restrict the disclosure of the result of\r\n  the process.\r\n\r\nId. (citations omitted).\r\nThe Supreme\r\n  Court echoed its holding from McGee in Durham v. Vinson, 360 S.C.\r\n  639, 602 S.E.2d 760 (2004).Â  The Court analyzed whether the defendant\r\n  physicianâ€™s privileging file was protected under the Peer Review Statute and determined\r\n  the file was not subject to discovery or disclosure.Â  The Court articulated:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  trial court erred by allowing Durhamâ€™s counsel to ask Dr. Vinson about his\r\n  failure to fully disclose his privileging file, a file that he was under no\r\n  obligation to disclose pursuant to section 40-71-20.Â  If physicians can be\r\n  questioned before the jury about the refusal to produce this privileged\r\n  information, the effect is to pressure them toward disclosure of the\r\n  privileging file.Â  As occurred here, the exercise of the statutory right not to\r\n  disclose the information would be used against the physician as evidence the\r\n  physician is hiding something.Â  Allowing this to occur does not serve the\r\n  policy goals of promoting candor and open discussion among participants in the\r\n  peer review process.\r\n\r\nId. at 649, 602 S.E.2d at 765.\r\nDeal\r\n  and Pocock have answered questions about the outcome of committee actions,\r\n  namely how many physicians have been suspended while each one was serving as a\r\n  committee member.Â  They have refused to answer questions relating to what led\r\n  to the suspension of those physicians.Â  The Peer Review Statute is salutary and\r\n  salubrious.Â  All committee actions are safeguarded and protected by the Peer\r\n  Review Statute.Â  The reasons considered by a committee to summarily suspend a physician\r\n  are confidential just like the documents and testimony reviewed when a physician\r\n  applies for clinical privileges or appeals a suspension of clinical privileges.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  Peer Review Statute serves the important public policy goal of ensuring quality\r\n  medical care to citizens of South Carolina by protecting confidences revealed\r\n  to committees evaluating the qualifications of physicians practicing in\r\n  hospitals.Â  The necessitude and essentiality for this information to remain private\r\n  is so momentous, portentous, and consequential that appellate courts of this\r\n  state will address orders jeopardizing this confidentiality despite their\r\n  interlocutory nature.\r\nWe\r\n  hold the efficaciousness and applicability of the South Carolina Peer Review\r\n  Statute mandates the revelation by physicians of the outcome of committee\r\n  actions.Â  We rule that any further questions delving into the committeeâ€™s\r\n  proceedings are absolutely protected and safeguarded by the statutory\r\n  provisions encapsulated in the Peer Review Statute.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nSHORT\r\n  and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The parties briefed the refusal of Dr. Stephen\r\n  Shapiro (Shapiro) to answer the same questions at his deposition, which was\r\n  conducted after the circuit court issued its order regarding Deal and Pocock.Â \r\n  Because there is no order from the circuit court regarding Shapiroâ€™s deposition,\r\n  the matter is not properly before this Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4375","title":"RRR, Inc. v.

Countryman, both of Charleston, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tOtto W. Ferrene, Jr., of Hilton Head Island, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J.:Â  Thomas M. Toggas and Katherine\r\n  Toggas (Appellants) appeal the circuit courtâ€™s order denying their motion to\r\n  alter, amend or vacate judgment, and instead affirming the findings of the jury.Â \r\n  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellants contracted with RRR, Inc., to\r\n  rent their beachfront condo on Hilton Head, South Carolina to guests.Â  The contract\r\n  provided for the rental commission, costs of cleaning and maintenance to be\r\n  deducted from the gross rental funds, and that Appellants would be responsible\r\n  for any damages arising from bookings made by RRR that were not honored.Â  RRR\r\n  booked Appellantsâ€™ condo during the busy weeks of the Family Circle Tennis\r\n  Tournament and the MCI Heritage Golf Tournament, which were held in consecutive\r\n  weeks in Hilton Head.Â  Thereafter, Appellants refused to honor the bookings, and\r\n  RRR was required to find comparable units out of its own pocket for the\r\n  short-term guests it had previously booked that were then out of a place to\r\n  stay.Â  \r\nAt the time of the double booking, RRR, in the normal course of\r\n  business, had in its possession rental funds it had received from Appellantsâ€™\r\n  prior rentals. Â According to the contract, RRR attempted to use these funds as\r\n  partial payment for the out of pockets expenses incurred in finding the\r\n  short-term guests additional lodging.Â  Appellants disagreed with this practice,\r\n  and a dispute arose.Â  Over the course of the next week, Appellants began\r\n  calling the cell phone of the owner of RRR, as well as its business phone.Â  During\r\n  these calls and messages that were left, Appellants coupled extreme profanity and\r\n  lewd name-calling of RRRâ€™s female employees, with threats to shut RRR down and\r\n  ruin its business.Â  According to testimony, Appellants also made calls to the\r\n  Chamber of Commerce, the Beaufort County Sheriffâ€™s Department, the local\r\n  newspaper, and the South Carolina Real Estate Commission.Â  RRRâ€™s business\r\n  apparently began to suddenly and severely decline, and RRR eventually brought\r\n  suit against Appellants alleging three causes of action:Â  breach of contract,\r\n  breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, and unlawful use of a\r\n  telephone.Â  \r\nDuring the course of this four year dispute, Appellants have been\r\n  represented by four different attorneys.Â  Attorney T. Wayne Yarborough,\r\n  attorney number two, represented Appellants before the trial until a fee dispute\r\n  led to his filing three separate motions to be relieved as counsel.Â  Yarboroughâ€™s\r\n  second motion was denied by Master-in-Equity Kemmerlin until the parties could\r\n  resolve their differences in a fee dispute resolution.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  Yarborough filed a third motion, and this was granted by Circuit Court Judge\r\n  Gregory in April, 2003.Â  Yarborough immediately sent a copy of the order\r\n  relieving him as counsel by certified mail, return receipt requested, along\r\n  with two voided checks from Appellants totaling three thousand dollars, as well\r\n  as a check from Yarborough to Appellants for two thousand dollars.Â  Appellant\r\n  Thomas Toggas signed for this mail, which also notified Appellants they should\r\n  obtain counsel within thirty days, and\r\n  that if they did not, they would be listed and contacted as pro se from that point forward.\r\nThe\r\n  case was thereafter called to trial without Appellants present in July, 2003.Â \r\n  Testimony presented at the trial indicated the Clerk of Court sent notice of\r\n  the court roster indicating the case would be called to Appellants; however,\r\n  Appellants contend they received no such notice.Â  A jury trial and verdict\r\n  resulted in a finding of $1,550 actual damages to each Thomas and Katherine\r\n  Toggas on the breach of contract claim. Â The breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act claim resulted\r\n  in a verdict against Thomas Toggas in the amount of $75,000 in actual damages,\r\n  and $500,000 in punitive damages.Â  Finally, the jury found damages on the\r\n  unlawful communication charge against Thomas Toggas in the amount of $4,781,\r\n  and $60,000 in punitive damages. \r\nThe judgment was mailed to Appellantsâ€™ home of record, and\r\n  Appellants subsequently filed a motion to alter, amend or vacate the judgment.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the motions for a new trial absolute, vacation of the\r\n  judgment, and new trial nisi remittitur were denied.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. Excusable Neglect\r\nAppellants first\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in refusing to set aside the judgment for\r\n  excusable neglect under Rule 60, SCRCP, claiming they received no notice of the\r\n  trial. Â We disagree.\r\nWhether to grant or\r\n  deny a motion under Rule 60(b) lies within the sound discretion of the judge.Â  Raby\r\n    Constr., L.L.P. v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 17, 594 S.E.2d 478, 482&nbsp;(2004).Â \r\n  An appellate courtâ€™s standard of review, therefore, is limited to determining\r\n  whether there was an abuse of discretion.Â  Id. at 18, 594 S.E.2d at\r\n  482.Â  Relief under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, lies within the sound discretion of\r\n  the circuit court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion.Â  Paul Davis Sys., Inc. v. Deepwater of Hilton Head, LLC, 362\r\n  S.C. 220, 225, 607 S.E.2d 358, 360&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2004).\r\n\r\n\tRule 60(b)(1), SCRCP provides in pertinent part:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court\r\n  may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order,\r\n  or proceeding for the following reasons: (1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise,\r\n  or excusable neglect . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\nâ€œAlthough most often used\r\n  when relief is sought from a judgment by default, Rule 60(b)(1) applies to any\r\n  final judgment.â€ Â Goodson v. Am. Bankers Ins. Co. of Fla., 295 S.C. 400,\r\n  402, 368 S.E.2d 687, 689 (Ct. App. 1988). â€œRelief under this section is within\r\n  the sound discretion of the circuit court and will not be disturbed absent a\r\n  clear abuse of that discretion.â€ Â Id.Â  â€œSuch an abuse arises when the circuit\r\n  court issuing the order was controlled by an error of law or when the order,\r\n  based upon factual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.â€ Â Id. Â See also Ledford v. Pennsylvania Life Insurance Co., 267\r\n  S.C. 671, 230 S.E.2d 900 (1976); Ricks v. Weinrauch, 293 S.C. 372, 360\r\n  S.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1987). Â â€œWhile these cases deal with the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  discretion in setting aside default judgments, the principles are equally applicable\r\n  to motions for relief from any final judgment.â€Â  Goodson, 295 S.C. at\r\n  402, 368 S.E.2d at 689.\r\nAppellantsâ€™ basis\r\n  for claiming excusable neglect is that they did not receive actual notice that\r\n  the trial was imminent.Â  Whether Appellants received notice of the impending\r\n  trial is not clear from the record; however, the circuit court found\r\n  specifically that notice was given Appellants by the clerk of court.Â  The foundation\r\n  of this finding was the testimony of both the Clerk of Court Elizabeth Smith,\r\n  and Deputy Clerk of Court Joni Fields.Â  Fields testified she had sent\r\n  Appellants a copy of the July roster to their Washington D.C. address of record\r\n  because Appellants were listed as pro se.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  circuit court found Appellantsâ€™ testimony that they did not receive notice to\r\n  not be credible, stating the testimony was â€œfilled with calculated and obvious\r\n  misstatements and deliberate lies.â€Â  â€œCredibility determinations regarding testimony are a matter for the\r\n  finder of fact, who has the opportunity to observe the witnesses, and those determinations are entitled to great deference on appeal.â€Â  Okatie River, L.L.C. v. Southeastern Site Prep, L.L.C., 353 S.C. 327,\r\n  338, 557 S.E.2d 468, 474 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Accordingly, the circuit court did\r\n  not abuse its discretion in finding one witnessâ€™s testimony more credible than\r\n  anotherâ€™s in denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to set aside the judgment due to\r\n  excusable neglect. \r\nII. New Trial; New Trial Nisi Remittitur \r\nAppellants next\r\n  contend the circuit court erred in refusing to grant their motion for a new\r\n  trial absolute, or a new trial nisi remittitur pursuant to Rule\r\n  59, SCRCP. Â We disagree.\r\nA circuit court may\r\n  grant a new trial absolute on the ground that the verdict is excessive or\r\n  inadequate. Â Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 379, 426 S.E.2d 802, 805\r\n  (1993).Â  â€œThe juryâ€™s determination of damages, however, is entitled to\r\n  substantial deference.â€ Â Id. Â The circuit court should grant a new trial\r\n  absolute on the excessiveness of the verdict only if the amount is so grossly\r\n  inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court and clearly\r\n  indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice,\r\n  partiality, corruption or some other improper motives.Â  Id. at 379-80,\r\n  426 S.E.2d at 805. Â \r\nThe grant or denial\r\n  of new trial motions rests within the discretion of the circuit court and its\r\n  decision will not be disturbed on appeal unless its findings are wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or the conclusions reached are controlled by error\r\n  of law. Â Umhoefer v. Bollinger, 298 S.C. 221, 224, 379 S.E.2d 296, 297\r\n  (Ct. App. 1989). Â See also Boozer v. Boozer, 300 S.C. 282,\r\n  387 S.E.2d 674 (Ct. App. 1988) (Court of appeals has no power to review circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s ruling unless it rests on basis of fact wholly unsupported by evidence\r\n  or is controlled by error of law.). Â â€œIn deciding whether to assess error to a\r\n  courtâ€™s denial of a motion for a new trial, we must consider the testimony and\r\n  reasonable inferences to be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the\r\n  nonmoving party.â€ Â Umhoefer, 298 S.C. at 224, 379 S.E.2d at 297.\r\nBased on the\r\n  standard described above, the circuit court was left with Appellantsâ€™ testimony\r\n  to decide if the juryâ€™s determination of fault and resulting damages was\r\n  unsupported by the evidence or based on errors in law.Â  Appellants testified\r\n  they only received several checks from Yarborough, representing monies paid by\r\n  Appellants in advance and due back after Yarborough was relieved as counsel,\r\n  and at no time were put on notice that Yarborough had been actually been\r\n  relieved.Â  However, Yarborough testified he sent Appellants a letter explaining\r\n  he had been relieved as counsel, that Appellants should retain new counsel\r\n  within thirty days, and that if they did not, they would be listed and\r\n  contacted as pro se from that point forward.Â  The letter also\r\n  included as enclosures two voided checks from Appellants, as well as a refund\r\n  check from Yarborough in the amount of two thousand dollars.Â  The letter and its\r\n  enclosures were sent via certified mail, and Yarborough produced a return\r\n  receipt signed by Thomas Toggas proving Appellantsâ€™ receipt.Â  Furthermore, both\r\n  Thomas and Katherine Toggas provided affidavits in support of their motion to\r\n  alter or amend judgment, swearing to receipt of notice that Yarborough had been\r\n  relieved pursuant to the letter described above.Â  The circuit court found\r\n  Appellantsâ€™ credibility to be â€œabsolutely zero.â€Â  We therefore cannot say the\r\n  circuit courtâ€™s decision to deny Appellantsâ€™ motion for a new trial absolute was\r\n  an abuse of discretion. \r\nSimilarly, the circuit\r\n  court alone has the power to grant a new trial nisi when it finds the\r\n  amount of the verdict to be merely inadequate or excessive. Â McCourt by and\r\n    Through McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 308, 457 S.E.2d 603, 607 (1995).Â \r\n  â€œCompelling reasons, however, must be given to justify invading the juryâ€™s\r\n  province in this manner.â€ Â Bailey v. Peacock, 318 S.C. 13, 14, 455\r\n  S.E.2d 690, 691 (1995).\r\nWhile the circuit\r\n  court may not impose its will on a party by substituting its judgment for that\r\n  of the jury, it may give the party an option in the way of additur or remittitur,\r\n  or, in the alternative, a new trial. Â Jones v. Ingles Supermarkets, Inc.,\r\n  293 S.C. 490, 493, 361 S.E.2d 775, 776 (Ct. App. 1987).Â  The circuit court has wide discretionary power to\r\n  reduce the amount of a verdict which, in its judgment, is excessive. Â Daniel\r\n    v. Sharpe Const. Co., 270 S.C. 687, 690, 244 S.E.2d 312, 314 (1978). The\r\n  decision of the circuit court to reduce the verdict will not be disturbed\r\n  unless it clearly appears that the exercise of discretion was controlled by a\r\n  manifest error of law.Â  Id. Â The circuit court, being cognizant of the\r\n  evidentiary atmosphere at trial, is in a far better position to review the\r\n  damages than this court. Â Id.Â  Accordingly, great deference is given to\r\n  the circuit court, especially in the area of damages. Â Id. Â \r\nIn this case, the\r\n  circuit court did a full analysis of the damages awarded RRR by the jury,\r\n  including the appropriateness and excessiveness of the punitive damage award.Â \r\n  As enumerated by our supreme court in Gamble v. Stevenson, upon a\r\n  post-trial motion challenging an award of punitive damages, a circuit court may\r\n  consider the following factors in its review:Â  (1) defendantâ€™s degree of\r\n  culpability; (2) duration of the\r\n  conduct; (3) defendantâ€™s awareness or concealment; (4) the existence of similar\r\n  past conduct; (5) likelihood the award will deter the defendant or others from\r\n  like conduct; (6) whether the award is reasonably related to the harm likely to\r\n  result from such conduct; (7) defendantâ€™s ability to pay; and finally, (8)\r\n  â€œother factorsâ€ deemed appropriate.Â  Gamble v. Stevenson, 305 S.C. 104,\r\n  111-12, 406 S.E.2d 350, 354 (1991).\r\nAfter conducting a\r\n  full Gamble review, the circuit court determined the award of damages\r\n  and punitive damages was appropriate given the conduct of Appellants.Â  We can\r\n  find no error of law amounting to an abuse of discretion in this determination.\r\nIII. No Private Right of\r\n  Action\r\nAppellants also\r\n  contend Section 16-17-430 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2006) is a criminal\r\n  statute, and does not otherwise provide a private right of action to a\r\n  litigant.Â  Appellants maintained in their answers and counterclaims to RRRâ€™s\r\n  complaint, as well as in the memorandum in support of their motion to alter,\r\n  amend or vacate the judgment, that RRRâ€™s cause of action for unlawful use of\r\n  the telephone was not properly pled or proven.Â  However, Appellants were not\r\n  present at the trial, and therefore did not timely object to the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  instruction to the jury that 16-17-430 created a private right of action.Â  As a\r\n  result, this issue is not preserved for our review. Â Although we question whether or not this statute does,\r\n  indeed, create a private right, in order for an issue to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit\r\n  court.Â  It is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the circuit court to be\r\n  preserved.Â  Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510\r\n  (2006).Â  Moreover, a party cannot use a motion to reconsider, alter or amend a\r\n  judgment to present an issue that could have been raised prior to the judgment\r\n  but was not.Â  Dixon v. Dixon, 362 S.C. 388, 399, 608 S.E.2d 849, 854\r\n  (2005) (issue raised for first time in Rule 59, SCRCP, motion is not preserved\r\n  for review).\r\nIV. Entry of Default and\r\n  Notice\r\nNext, Appellants\r\n  contend they were not provided notice as prescribed under Rule 55, SCRCP.Â  Appellants\r\n  maintain RRR should have been required to seek a default judgment in this\r\n  situation, and because Appellants had previously appeared or otherwise defended\r\n  in the action against them, under Rule 55(b)(2), they were entitled to written\r\n  notice of the motion or application for judgment at least three days prior to\r\n  the hearing.Â  Claiming to have never received this notice, Appellants assert\r\n  the damages award should be vacated.Â  We disagree.\r\nRule 55(a), SCRCP,\r\n  states â€œWhen a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought\r\n  has failed to plead or otherwise defend ... the\r\n  clerk shall enter his default upon the calendar.â€ Â This case is similar to that\r\n  of Goodson, where Appellants had not â€œfailed to pleadâ€ and no default\r\n  was entered by the clerk; rather as Appellants themselves point out, they have\r\n  actively defended the action for four years.Â  Goodson, 295 S.C. 400, 368\r\n  S.E.2d 687.Â  Furthermore, Rule 55(b), SCRCP, provides for written notification\r\n  where there has been an application for judgment by default.Â  Id. at\r\n  404, 368 S.E.2d at 690.Â  Here, as in Goodson, there was no application\r\n  for default, and the case went before a jury and a full trial was held on the\r\n  matter.\r\n\r\n\tMoreover, Rule\r\n  54(c), SCRCP, provides:Â  \r\n\t\r\n\t\tA\r\n  judgment by default shall not be different in kind from or exceed in amount\r\n  that prayed for in the demand for judgment. Except as to a party against whom a\r\n  judgment is entered by default, every final judgment shall grant the relief to\r\n  which the party in whose favor it is rendered is entitled, even if the party\r\n  has not demanded such relief in his pleadings.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn addition, â€œ[a]lthough\r\n  there appears to be authority for the proposition that a failure to appear at\r\n  trial after answering the complaint should entitle a defendant to default\r\n  status, the majority view appears to permit the plaintiff to proceed to\r\n  judgment on the merits. Â See 11A Words and Phrases â€œDefaultâ€ 272-274 (1971); Coulas v. Smith, 96 Ariz. 325, 395 P.2d 527 (1964); Tartaglia v.

Branham, of Lexington, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN,\r\n  C.J.:Â  Richard Freeman appeals the\r\n  special refereeâ€™s order setting aside a judicial sale.Â  Freeman contends Wells\r\n  Fargo Bank, NA (the Bank) failed to meet its burden of proof to vacate the sale\r\n  because it failed to present evidence as to the value of the property.Â  We\r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nThe Bank obtained a mortgage from Barbara Turner\r\n  in the amount of $82,025 on real property located in Bamberg County, South Carolina.Â  When Turner failed to make her payments, the Bank sought foreclosure of\r\n  the mortgage, and the case was referred to a special referee.Â  In July of 2005,\r\n  the referee held a hearing on the merits, as evidenced by a written transcript\r\n  of testimony submitted in the record.Â  Turner did not attend the hearing, and\r\n  was ultimately found in default.Â  The referee found the debt due to the Bank\r\n  totaled $86,565.13, and ordered the property sold at public auction.Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt the public auction, Freeman submitted the\r\n  highest, and ultimately successful bid of $3,000 for the property.Â  Thereafter,\r\n  the Bank served Freeman with a Motion to Set Aside and Vacate Sale.Â  The Bank\r\n  argued the sale should be set aside because:Â  (1) the Bankâ€™s attorney failed to\r\n  take all necessary steps to ensure the Bank would have a representative present\r\n  and prepared to bid at the sale; and (2) the successful bid of $3,000.00 was so\r\n  low as to shock the conscience of the court. \r\nThe special referee granted the Bankâ€™s motion, concluding\r\n  Freemanâ€™s bid of $3,000 amounted to only 3.65% of the property value, and\r\n  therefore, constituted a grossly inadequate sale price that shocks the\r\n  conscience under the test set forth in Poole v. Jefferson Standard Life Ins.\r\n    Co., 174 S.C. 150, 157, 177 S.E. 24, 27 (1934).Â  The referee declined to\r\n  address the Bankâ€™s other arguments, including the existence of â€œcircumstances\r\n  warranting court interference,â€ finding it was unnecessary to do so, given the\r\n  gross inadequacy of the sale price.Â  Subsequently, Freeman filed a Rule 59(e),\r\n  SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment.Â  The special referee denied the\r\n  motion, and this appeal followed.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œA mortgage\r\n  foreclosure is an action in equity.Â  Our scope of review of a case heard by a\r\n  master who enters a final judgment is to determine facts in accordance with our\r\n  own view of the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  E. Sav. Bank, FSB v.\r\n    Sanders, 373 S.C. 349, 354, 644 S.E.2d 802, 805 (2007) (quoting Hayne\r\n      Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475\r\n  (1997)).Â  However, the determination of whether a judicial sale should be set\r\n  aside is a matter left to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Investors\r\n    Sav. Bank v. Phelps, 303 S.C. 15, 17, 397 S.E.2d 780, 781 (Ct. App. 1990).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nFreeman asserts the special referee erred\r\n  in finding the Bank had met its burden of proof in order to vacate the\r\n  foreclosure sale.Â  Specifically, Freeman asserts the Bank failed to prove the\r\n  value of the property.Â  We disagree.\r\nA\r\n  judicial sale will be set aside when either:Â  (1) the sale price â€œis so gross\r\n  as to shock the conscience[;]â€ or (2) the sale â€œis accompanied by other\r\n  circumstances warranting the interference of the court.â€Â  Poole, 174\r\n  S.C. at 157, 177 S.E. at 27.Â Â  In Poole, the court set aside a sale on\r\n  the ground that the highest bid price, which amounted to approximately 12.5% of\r\n  the property value, was so grossly inadequate that it shocked the courtâ€™s conscience.Â \r\n  Since the opinion in Poole, our courts have continued to set aside\r\n  judicial sales based on â€œgrossly inadequateâ€ sales prices.Â  See Investors\r\n    Sav. Bank v. Phelps, 303 S.C. 15, 397 S.E.2d 780 (Ct. App. 1990) (stating\r\n  that sales prices amounting to 4.2%, 4.4%, and less than 10% of the property\r\n  value all fall within the percentage range of a grossly inadequate sales\r\n  price). \r\nIn the\r\n  case before us, the special referee found the original amount of the foreclosed\r\n  note and mortgage was $82,025, and that the total debt due to the Bank under\r\n  the note and mortgage, as of July 7, 2005, was $86,563.13.Â  As a result, the\r\n  court concluded Freemanâ€™s high bid of $3,000 was only 3.65% of the original\r\n  principal amount of the foreclosed note and mortgage.Â  This, the court found,\r\n  constituted a grossly inadequate sale price that shocked the conscience under\r\n  the Poole test.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  amount of the foreclosed note and mortgage are evidence of the propertyâ€™s\r\n  value.Â  Investors Savings Bank v. Phelps, 303 S.C. 15, 18-19, 397 S.E.2d\r\n  780, 782 (Ct. App. 1990).Â  Although the note and mortgage were not presented as\r\n  evidence at the hearing on the motion to set aside the sale, they were admitted\r\n  into evidence at the initial hearing regarding the default proceedings against\r\n  Turner, and they were attached to the original summons and complaint instituting\r\n  the action.Â  A purchaser at a judicial sale is deemed to have notice of all\r\n  things disclosed by the record.Â  See Ex parte Keller, 185 S.C.\r\n  283, 293, 194 S.E. 15, 19 (1937) (Even though judicial sale purchaser was not a\r\n  party to the action originally, as a purchaser at the sale, he made himself a\r\n  party to the suit, and is assumed to have notice of all things disclosed by the\r\n  record.).Â  Additionally, the sale and terms of a foreclosure are ordered and\r\n  dictated by the Judgment of Foreclosure and Notice of Sale, which are both a\r\n  matter of public record.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  Freeman testified at the hearing on the motion to set aside the sale that he\r\n  was prepared to bid up to $75,000.00 for the property.Â  Fair market value is\r\n  the amount at which property would change hands between a willing buyer and\r\n  willing seller.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 597 (6th ed. 1990). Therefore\r\n  Freemanâ€™s testimony is also evidence of the value of the property.[1]Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold the record contains sufficient evidence of the value of\r\n  the property to support the decision of the special referee that Freemanâ€™s bid\r\n  was so grossly inadequate as to shock the conscience.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the special referee is \r\nAFFIRMED.[2]Â  \r\nPIEPER, J., and CURETON, A.J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Freeman also asserts the lower court applied the\r\n  wrong legal standard because it did not require the Bank to prove excusable\r\n  neglect.Â  However, a party does not have to prove excusable neglect if the\r\n  judicial sale is found to shock the conscience; rather a showing of excusable\r\n  neglect is only required when a party is seeking to have a judicial sale set\r\n  aside based on the second prong of the Poole test.Â  Poole, 174\r\n  S.C. at 157, 177 S.E. at 27.Â  Here, we need not address Freemanâ€™s remaining\r\n  arguments because we find the sale was properly set aside based on the first\r\n  prong of Poole.Â  &nbsp;See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n    598 (1999) (ruling an appellate court need not review remaining issues\r\n  when its determination of a prior issue is dispositive of\r\n  the appeal).\r\n[2] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4377","title":"Hoard v.

Dawes Cooke, Jr., and P.\r\n          Gunnar Nistad, both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this medical malpractice action, Jamia Hoard and her parents, Karen Elizabeth Hoard and William\r\n  Dwight (collectively the Hoards), appeal the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary\r\n  judgment to Dr. Robert H. Smith on their cause of action for medical\r\n  malpractice.Â  The Hoards assert they provided evidence Dr. Smith was a\r\n  proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nJamia was born on March 30, 2002, at Roper Hospital (the Hospital) in Charleston.Â  Shortly thereafter, she developed a\r\n  respiratory condition and was transferred to a level II nursery,[1] where Dr. Marshall Goldstein, a\r\n  neonatologist,[2] was her primary physician.Â  Jamiaâ€™s condition necessitated an\r\n  intravenous line to administer medication and fluids.Â  Because the nursing\r\n  staff was unable to start a peripheral intravenous line, Dr. Goldstein ordered Karen\r\n  Johnson, a certified neonatal nurse practitioner, to place an umbilical\r\n  intravenous line.[3]Â  Johnson placed the line on the afternoon of March 30, 2002.Â  When\r\n  inserted eleven to thirteen centimeters, the optimal location for such a\r\n  catheter, the line would not draw[4] blood. Nurse Johnson then placed the line at fourteen centimeters.Â  Following the\r\n  Hospitalâ€™s protocol, a chest x-ray was taken on March 30 to confirm the position\r\n  of the line. Â \r\nThe next morning, Dr. Smith, a radiologist, reviewed Jamiaâ€™s chest\r\n  x-ray and prepared a report stating, â€œAn umbilical vein catheter has been\r\n  placed.Â  The tip terminates high within the right atrium.Â  There are persistent\r\n  bilateral coarse infiltrates essentially unchanged compared with the prior\r\n  one.Â  No pneumothorax is seen.â€Â  Dr. Smithâ€™s report was approved at\r\n  10:34 a.m. and sent to Jamiaâ€™s floor.Â  At 2 p.m. that afternoon Dr. Goldstein\r\n  reviewed Dr. Smithâ€™s report. Â He did not adjust the placement of the\r\n  line.Â  \r\nAt 4:15 a.m. on April 1, Jamia went into cardiac arrest.Â  Jamia\r\n  was transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit[5] of the Medical University of South\r\n  Carolina (MUSC) where it was determined the wall of the right atrium was\r\n  perforated allowing blood and intravenous fluid to fill the pericardial sac\r\n  around the heart, effectively causing tamponade.[6]Â  MUSC physicians ascertained that the umbilical intravenous line most likely\r\n  eroded the wall of the heart a few hours prior to the cardiac arrest, and as a\r\n  result Jamia suffered severe brain damage.Â  \r\nJamia and her parents separately filed\r\n  professional negligence actions against the Hospital; Carolina Care Alliance,\r\n  the owner and operator of the Hospital; Nurse Johnson; Dr. Smith; and Dr.\r\n  Goldstein.Â  The Hoards asserted Dr. Smith violated his standard of care\r\n  by failing to note in his x-ray report the line was improperly placed and this\r\n  failure was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries. Â The Hoards claimed\r\n  Dr. Goldstein may not have known the line was improperly placed and if Dr.\r\n  Smith had alerted him to the placement, Dr. Goldstein would have moved the\r\n  line, and prevented the cardiac arrest.Â  \r\nIn his deposition, Dr. Paul Koenigsberg, a radiologist from Florida, testified that Dr. Smith violated the standard of care by failing to note on the\r\n  chart or notify someone the line was improperly placed. Â Dr. Goldstein\r\n  testified he knew the line was not optimally placed but chose not to reposition\r\n  it for several reasons, including the lineâ€™s proven efficacy over twenty-two\r\n  hours and the possibility of moving a blood clot that may have formed at the\r\n  tip of the line. Â Dr. Anne Hansen, an assistant professor at Harvard University Medical School, described Dr. Goldsteinâ€™s reasons for not moving the\r\n  line as a non-valid concern. \r\nThe Hoards settled their claims with the Hospital, Carolina Care\r\n  Alliance, Nurse Johnson, and Dr. Goldstein. Â Dr. Smith made a motion for\r\n  summary judgment.Â  The trial court granted the motion, finding the Hoards did\r\n  not provide evidence Dr. Smith was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  The\r\n  Hoardsâ€™ motion for amendment of judgment was denied. Â This appeal followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary\r\n  judgment motion, this court applies the same standard which governs the trial\r\n  court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP: summary judgment is proper when there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law.&nbsp; Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493,\r\n  567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002).&nbsp; In determining whether a triable issue of\r\n  fact exists, the evidence and all factual inferences drawn from it must be\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.&nbsp; Sauner v.\r\n    Pub. Serv. Auth., 354 S.C. 397, 404, 581 S.E.2d 161, 165 (2003).&nbsp; If evidentiary\r\n  facts are not disputed but the conclusions or inferences to be drawn from them\r\n  are, summary judgment should be denied. Baugus v. Wessinger, 303 S.C.\r\n  412, 415, 401 S.E.2d 169, 171 (1991).&nbsp; \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Hoards contend the trial court erred in granting Dr. Smithâ€™s motion for summary\r\n  judgment because they provided evidence Dr. Smith was a proximate cause of\r\n  Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  The Hoards assert a jury could have disregarded Dr.\r\n  Goldsteinâ€™s testimony and found Dr. Smithâ€™s failure to alert Dr. Goldstein of\r\n  the lineâ€™s position was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œMedical\r\n  malpractice lawsuits have specific requirements that must be satisfied in order\r\n  for a genuine factual issue to exist.â€Â David v. McLeod Regâ€™l\r\n    Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 247, 626 S.E.2d 1, 3&nbsp;(2006).Â  Specifically, a\r\n  plaintiff alleging medical malpractice must provide evidence showing: (1) the\r\n  generally recognized and accepted practices and procedures that would be\r\n  followed by average, competent practitioners in the defendantâ€™s field of\r\n  medicine under the same or similar circumstances, and (2) the defendant\r\n  departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards.Â  Jones v. Doe,\r\n  372 S.C. 53, 61, 640 S.E.2d 514, 518&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2006).Â  Additionally, the plaintiff must demonstrate the defendantâ€™s\r\n  departure from such generally recognized practices and procedures proximately\r\n  caused the plaintiffâ€™s alleged injuries and damages. Â David, 367 S.C. at\r\n  248, 626 S.E.2d at 4.Â  \r\nIf\r\n  the subject matter does not lie within common knowledge but requires special\r\n  learning to evaluate the conduct of the defendant, then the plaintiff must offer\r\n  expert testimony to establish both the required standard of care and the\r\n  defendantâ€™s failure to conform to that standard. Id.Â  Because â€œmany\r\n  malpractice suits involve ailments and treatments outside the realm of ordinary\r\n  lay knowledge, expert testimony is generally necessary.â€Â  Ellis v. Oliver,\r\n  323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 795&nbsp;(1996). When plaintiffs rely\r\n  solely upon medical expert testimony as the only evidence of proximate cause,\r\n  the medical expert must, with reasonable certainty, state it is their opinion the\r\n  injuries complained of most probably resulted from the defendantâ€™s negligence.Â  Id.Â  The testimony â€œmust provide a significant causal link between the\r\n  alleged negligence and the plaintiffâ€™s injuries, rather than a tenuous and\r\n  hypothetical connection.â€ Â Id.\r\nFor\r\n  this court to reverse grants of summary judgment, plaintiffs must have provided\r\n  some evidence for each element of their claims.Â  In the present case, the\r\n  Hoards must have presented evidence Dr. Smith violated the standard of care and\r\n  that violation was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  \r\n1.Â The Hoards presented\r\n  evidence regarding a radiologistâ€™s standard of care and violations of that\r\n  standard.Â  Dr. Koenigsberg testified radiologists have a duty and standard of\r\n  care to immediately convey urgent information to the person who ordered the\r\n  film.Â  He also testified it would be outside a radiologistâ€™s standard of care\r\n  to not directly communicate to the treating physician or his nurses that an\r\n  umbilical venous line was not properly positioned. Â Another radiologist\r\n  from Florida, Dr. Rodan, testified that when a radiologist sees a line high in\r\n  the right atrium, to be within the standard of care, he should state his\r\n  impression there is a deviation from the normal placement of a line. Â Dr.\r\n  Rodan further stated â€œif there is a malposition it needs to be stated in such\r\n  language that the referring physician knows that itâ€™s in an inappropriate\r\n  location and that they should consider doing something such as repositioning\r\n  the catheter.â€Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the Hoards provided evidence to support their assertion Dr. Smith violated the\r\n  standard of care, and we turn our examination to whether there is evidence Dr.\r\n  Smith was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.\r\n2.Â The Hoards claim Dr.\r\n  Smithâ€™s failure to alert Dr. Goldstein to the position of the line was a\r\n  proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  Dr. Smith\r\n  asserts the Hoards did not provide any evidence of proximate cause because Dr. Goldstein\r\n  testified he knew the line was not optimally positioned. However, a jury could\r\n  have chosen not to believe Dr. Goldsteinâ€™s testimony. Simply because testimony\r\n  is uncontradicted does not render it undisputed. Â Black v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, 198, 410 S.E.2d 595, 596 (Ct. App.\r\n  1991).Â  The question of the inherent probability of the testimony and the\r\n  credibility of the witness remains. Id.Â  Even when evidence is not contradicted,\r\n  the jury may believe all, some, or none of the testimony and the matter is\r\n  properly left to the jury to decide.Â  Ross v. Paddy,&nbsp;340 S.C. 428, 434, 532 S.E.2d 612, 615&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2000).Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  asked if Dr. Smithâ€™s alleged failure to communicate orally with Dr. Goldstein\r\n  in any way caused the cardiac arrest, Dr. Koenigsberg explained if there was a\r\n  delay between the placement of the line and the time at which the treating\r\n  physicians realized the line was in an abnormal position, that could have\r\n  caused the pericardial effusion. Â Dr. Koenigsberg also stated he believed Dr.\r\n  Smith was negligent for failing to call someone responsible for Jamiaâ€™s care\r\n  and inform them the tip of the catheter was in an abnormal position. Â Dr.\r\n  Koenigsberg testified if Dr. Goldstein knew of the lineâ€™s placement prior to\r\n  the line perforating the wall of the heart and had the opportunity to pull the\r\n  line back before injury occurred, Dr. Smith did not cause the pericardial\r\n  effusion.[7] Â However, Dr. Koenigsberg also responded affirmatively when asked, â€œIs\r\n  it your opinion that Dr. Smithâ€™s alleged failure to orally communicate with\r\n  Jamia Hoardâ€™s health care personnel, caused her to have a pericardial\r\n  effusion?â€ \r\nIn\r\n  addition, Dr. Rodan testified, â€œI think the lack of completeness of [Dr.\r\n  Smithâ€™s] report did contribute to the complications that occurred to the\r\n  patient.â€ Â Assuming Dr. Goldstein did not know the location of the\r\n  catheterâ€™s tip was outside the standard of care, Dr. Rodan testified Dr.\r\n  Smithâ€™s failure to point out the deviation from the standard of care was â€œa\r\n  contributing cause to the complications that occurred.â€ Â Dr. Rodan believed\r\n  â€œsome of the complications thatâ€¦ occurred may be a direct responsibility of the\r\n  radiologist because of his inadequate report.â€ \r\nAn\r\n  examination of the record shows the Hoards provided evidence supporting their\r\n  assertion Dr. Smith was a proximate cause of Jamiaâ€™s injuries.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the order of the trial court is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, and THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Nurseries can be\r\n  distinguished based on the needs of an infant and the abilities of a facility.Â \r\n  Level II nurseries provide care for infants who need more help or closer\r\n  monitoring than a Level I nursery can provide.Â  Infants in Level II nurseries\r\n  may need intravenous fluids or medications, assistance to maintain their body\r\n  temperature, feeding assistance, or monitoring for sleep apnea.Â  Level III\r\n  nurseries or newborn intensive care units (NICUs) provide even greater care to\r\n  infants, including subspecialty services, the use of ventilators, close\r\n  observation of infants whose condition is unstable, and care following surgery.\r\n[2] Neonatology is a subspecialty of pediatric medicine,\r\n  concerning the care and treatment of newborns.Â  \r\n[3] An umbilical\r\n  intravenous line is a catheter that is placed in the vein of the umbilical\r\n  cord. \r\n[4] A catheter â€œdrawsâ€ when you exert negative pressure on the\r\n  catheter and blood flows out of the body through the catheter.Â  \r\n[5] MUSCâ€™s neonatal intensive care unit is the regionâ€™s\r\n  Level III care facility.\r\n[6] Tamponade is the restriction of heart function by\r\n  fluid in the pericardial sac.Â  \r\n[7] Pericardial effusion is an accumulation of fluid in\r\n  the pericardial sac.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4378","title":"Thomson v.

Benjamin Stevens, of Spartanburg, and John S. Nichols, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tRichard H. Rhodes, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:&nbsp; Colin Thomson (Husband) appeals from the final order of the family\r\n  court granting Amy Thomson (Wife) a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty\r\n  and ordering him to pay: (1) $99 per week in child support; (2) one-half of\r\n  accumulated marital debt; (3) thirty-six percent of the childrenâ€™s future\r\n  uninsured medical bills; and (4) $5,000 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Husband\r\n  also appeals the courtâ€™s declaration that Wife owned all the property in her\r\npossession.Â  We affirm.[1] \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn February 2004, Husband and Wife met on a dating website.Â  Wife held\r\n  a masterâ€™s degree and worked as a college swim coach and teacher. Â She owned a furnished\r\n  home in Spartanburg, South Carolina.Â  Husband, a Canadian citizen, worked in\r\n  furniture sales.Â  Prior to their marriage, Wife agreed to sponsor Husbandâ€™s\r\n  application for a visa.Â  After their August 2004 marriage, Husband moved into Wifeâ€™s\r\n  home. Â Wife worked two jobs; however, Husband delayed submitting his visa application until February 2005 and,\r\n  consequently, remained unemployed\r\n  until May 2005.Â  \r\nShortly after their marriage, Wife became pregnant. Â Her pregnancy\r\n  was considered â€œhigh-riskâ€ because she was thirty-seven years old and expecting\r\n  twins. Â The children were born six weeks prematurely and remained in the\r\n  newborn intensive care unit for twelve days.Â  After Wife returned to work, wifeâ€™s\r\n  mother Carrie Bailey, who had moved from Michigan to the home to help care for\r\n  the children, remained in the home to provide child-care.Â  \r\nOn August 18, 2005, Wife filed a complaint seeking: (1) a divorce\r\n  on the ground of physical cruelty; (2) sole custody of the children; (3) equitable\r\n  division of marital debt; (4) child support; and (5) attorneysâ€™ fees. Â While Wife\r\n  and the children were attending a function at Wifeâ€™s school, Husband vacated\r\n  the home and removed numerous items of Wifeâ€™s personal property.Â  Based upon Wifeâ€™s\r\n  motion for emergency relief, wherein she claimed Husband had become â€œvolatile\r\n  and irrational,â€ the family court issued an ex parte order that mutually restrained\r\n  Husband and Wife from interaction, temporarily restrained Husband from contact\r\n  with the children, and granted Wife temporary custody. Â \r\nAt a subsequent hearing, the family court, finding Husband was not\r\n  an immediate threat to the children or a flight risk, granted him unsupervised\r\n  visitation. Â Further, the family court ordered Husband to pay child support of\r\n  $133 per week, to return the personal property he removed from Wifeâ€™s home, and\r\n  it imposed a mutual restraining order. Â \r\nUltimately, the family court issued a final order granting Wife a\r\n  divorce on the ground of physical cruelty, sole custody of the children, and $5,000\r\n  toward her attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  Husband was awarded visitation within the United States, and was ordered to pay child support of $99 a week, in addition to thirty-six\r\n  percent of the childrenâ€™s future medical bills that were not covered by insurance.\r\n  Â The court also ordered Husband and Wife to divide their accumulated marital\r\n  debt and the childrenâ€™s unpaid medical bills. Â Additionally, the court declared\r\n  Wife owned all of the property in her possession as well as the property the\r\n  court had previously ordered Husband return to her. Â Husbandâ€™s appeal\r\n  followed.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  divorce action is a matter in equity heard by the family court judge; on\r\n  appeal, the courtâ€™s scope of review extends to the finding of facts based on\r\n  its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  McLaughlin v. McLaughlin, 283 S.C. 404, 405-06, 323 S.E.2d\r\n  781, 782 (1984). Â However, our broad scope of review does not require us to\r\n  disregard the findings of the family court or to ignore the fact that the trial\r\n  judge saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to evaluate\r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Â Tinsley\r\n    v. Tinsley, 326 S.C. 374, 380, 483 S.E.2d 198, 201 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Physical Cruelty \r\nHusband contends the family court erred in granting Wife a divorce\r\n  on the ground of physical cruelty.Â  We disagree. Â \r\nPhysical\r\n  cruelty is â€œactual personal violence, or such a course of physical treatment as\r\n  endangers life, limb or health, and renders cohabitation unsafe.â€ Â Brown v.\r\n    Brown, 215 S.C. 502, 508, 56 S.E.2d 330, 333 (1949).Â  In considering what\r\n  acts constitute physical cruelty, the court must consider the circumstances of\r\n  the particular case.Â  Gibson v. Gibson, 283 S.C. 318, 322, 322 S.E.2d\r\n  680, 682 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  \r\nIn Gibson,\r\n  the husband appealed a family court order denying him a divorce on the ground\r\n  of physical cruelty after his intoxicated wife allegedly locked herself in the bedroom\r\n  and shot a rifle into the closed door.Â  The husband claimed a splinter from the\r\n  door struck him in the face; however, his wife claimed he was in a different\r\n  room when she fired the gun. Â Id. at 322, 322 S.E.2d at 682.Â  The family\r\n  court held that because the husband was not physically injured, the wifeâ€™s\r\n  conduct did not constitute physical cruelty.Â  Id. at 322, 322 S.E.2d at\r\n  683.Â  \r\nPrior\r\n  to Gibson, no South Carolina case directly addressed whether it was\r\n  necessary for a spouse to prove bodily injury when seeking a divorce on the\r\n  ground of physical cruelty.Â  Id. at 323, 322 S.E.2d at 683. Â On appeal, the Gibson court conducted an extensive review of the applicable case law\r\n  and held: \r\n\r\n\t[I]f\r\n  the wrongful act involves actual violence directed by one spouse at the other, â€œbodily\r\n  injuryâ€ is not required in order to find â€œphysical cruelty.â€\r\n  Â A single assault by one spouse upon the other spouse,\r\n  then, can constitute a basis for a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty;\r\n  however, the assault must be life threatening or it must be either indicative\r\n  of an intention to do serious bodily harm or of such a degree as to raise a\r\n  reasonable apprehension of great bodily harm in the future.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 323, 322 S.E.2d at 683 (emphasis in original). \r\nThe Gibson court found that although the wife committed a single act of â€œactual violenceâ€\r\n  by firing the rifle, it was unclear whether her act was one of â€œactual personal violenceâ€ directed against Husband.Â  Id. at 323-24, 322 S.E.2d at 683. Â The Gibson court remanded the case to the family court for findings\r\n  regarding the credibility of the parties and the circumstances surrounding the\r\n  wifeâ€™s firing the gun.Â  Id. at 324, 322 S.E.2d at 683-684.Â  See Lucas\r\n    v. Lucas, 279 S.C. 121, 302 S.E.2d 863 (1983) (finding it difficult to fathom\r\n  the reason the family court did not grant wife a divorce on the grounds of\r\n  physical cruelty, but finding no abuse of discretion in the courtâ€™s decision to\r\n  grant the divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s separation); see also McDowell v. McDowell, 300 S.C. 96, 99-100, 386 S.E.2d 468, 470 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989) (affirming the family courtâ€™s grant of a divorce to a husband on the\r\n  ground of physical cruelty where the court found his wifeâ€™s single act of\r\n  â€œaccidentallyâ€ shooting him was life threatening, indicative of her intention\r\n  to do serious bodily harm, and totally out of proportion to his attempt to\r\n  recover a vehicle from her).Â  \r\nHere, Wife testified Husband first physically abused her in\r\n  February 2005, when she was pregnant with twins. Â Wife stated she and Husband\r\n  argued over their finances, and she had gone into the bedroom to calm down when\r\n  â€œhe came in there and I mean basically pulled me off the bed three times by my\r\n  legs.â€Â  Husband, meanwhile, testified Wife kicked him as he tried to retrieve\r\n  bills from under the bed, and he admitted he responded by pulling her off the\r\n  bed by her legs.Â  After this altercation, Husband and Wife separated briefly; however,\r\n  Wife said Husband returned a week later, â€œagainst [her] wishes.â€Â  \r\nWife also testified Husband â€œroughed her upâ€ on her wrist and\r\n  breast and shattered a glass picture on her stomach; however, the record does\r\n  not indicate when these alleged acts of physical violence occurred. Â Husband admitted\r\n  â€œ[t]here was an incredible amount of physical violence in the houseâ€ and contended\r\n  Wife physically abused him by throwing juice at him and punching him in the\r\n  stomach.Â  Wife admitted throwing juice at Husband after he told her he never\r\n  wanted to marry her, but she denied ever hitting him.Â  \r\nWhere\r\n  issues relate to proof regarding which party, if either, is entitled to a\r\n  divorce, and the evidence is in conflict and susceptible to different\r\n  inferences, â€œit becomes the duty of the trial judge to determine not only the\r\n  law of the case but the facts as wellâ€ because the judge observed the witnesses\r\n  and could â€œattach[] to each oneâ€™s testimony such credence as was due.â€Â  Anders\r\n    v. Anders, 285 S.C. 512, 514, 331 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985).Â  Here, the family\r\n  courtâ€™s final order noted its â€œparticular attention to the demeanor of the party\r\n  [testifying] and the substance of that testimonyâ€ and stated concerns regarding\r\n  the credibility of Husbandâ€™s testimony and the testimony of Husbandâ€™s only\r\n  witness, his brother. Â By contrast, the courtâ€™s order did not express concerns\r\n  regarding Wifeâ€™s credibility. Â \r\nGiven\r\n  Wifeâ€™s condition at the time of the alleged act of physical violence, Husbandâ€™s\r\n  acknowledgement that there was a great deal of physical violence in the home,\r\n  and the fact that the family court judge had the opportunity to observe the demeanor\r\n  of the parties, we find sufficient evidence in the record to support the family\r\n  courtâ€™s decision to grant Wife a divorce on the ground of physical cruelty. Â \r\nB.&nbsp; Condonation\r\nHusband claims that even if his acts rose to the level\r\n  of physical cruelty, the evidence shows Wife condoned his misconduct when she\r\n  allowed him to move back into the marital residence.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œOrdinarily condonation is an affirmative defense that must be pleaded.â€Â  McLaughlin v. McLaughlin,\r\n  244 S.C. 265, 272, 136 S.E.2d 537, 540 (1964).Â  However, the issue of\r\n  condonation in a divorce proceeding may be raised for the first time on appeal.Â  Id.Â  But see Doe v. Doe, 286 S.C. 507, 511, 334\r\n  S.E.2d 829, 832 (Ct. App. 1985) (suggesting McLaughlin â€œmay have been\r\n  superseded by the subsequent adoption of Family Court Rule 11 which expressly\r\n  provides that â€˜recrimination and condonation shall be pleaded as affirmative defenses.â€™â€); Rule 8(c), SCRCP (stating when\r\n  pleading to a preceding pleading, a party must set forth the affirmative\r\n  defense of condonation).Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Husband raises the affirmative defense of condonation for the first time on\r\n  appeal. Â He acknowledges the family courtâ€™s order does not address condonation,\r\n  yet he asks this court to examine the record and find condonation.Â  We decline\r\n  to do so because this issue was neither pled nor raised to the family court\r\njudge.\r\n\r\nC.&nbsp; Child\r\n  Support \r\nHusband asserts the family court abused its discretion in ordering\r\n  him to pay child support of $99 per week.Â  Specifically, Husband contends the family\r\n  court made no findings to support this award.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen\r\n  an order from the family court fails to make specific findings of fact in\r\n  support of the courtâ€™s decision, the appellate court may remand the matter to\r\n  the family court or, â€œwhere the record is sufficient, make its own findings of\r\n  fact in accordance with the preponderance of the evidence.â€Â  Badeaux v.\r\n    Davis, 337 S.C. 195, 203, 522 S.E.2d 835, 839 (Ct. App. 1999). Â Additionally,\r\n  the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (Guidelines) allow a court to\r\n  impute potential gross income to a parent who is unemployed or underemployed.Â  See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 114-4720 (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the family courtâ€™s written order minimally complies with Rule 26(a), SCRCP, the\r\n  record is sufficient for this court to make findings on this issue which\r\n  support the family court order.[2] Â Husband testified he received\r\n  a letter from the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) in November 2005,\r\n  stating that because Wife had withdrawn her sponsorship of his visa application,\r\n  he was no longer eligible to work in the United States, and must leave the\r\n  country by April 22, 2006.Â  The courtâ€™s\r\n  order found Husband planned to return to Halifax, where he had a job offer\r\n  paying $13 per hour to work forty hours per week.Â  Wife submitted a financial\r\n  declaration showing gross monthly income of $3,916 and a monthly expense of\r\n  $153 for the childrenâ€™s health insurance. Â Although the family courtâ€™s order\r\n  did not state that it had imputed income to Husband based on his testimony, or had\r\n  applied the Guidelines, we find the record contained the facts needed for the\r\ncourt to compute Husbandâ€™s child support obligation pursuant to the Guidelines.\r\nBased on the\r\n  record before us, we project monthly wages of $2,080 to Husband.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion by ordering Husband to pay $99 per\r\nweek in child support.Â  \r\nD.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Division of Marital Debt\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in finding marital debt of $36,560\r\n  and ordering Husband to pay one-half ($18,280) to Wife at a rate of $300 per\r\n  month.Â  Specifically, Husband argues Wife did not sufficiently document that the\r\n  debt incurred during the marriage was related to expenses in support of the\r\n  marriage.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œFor\r\n  purposes of equitable distribution, â€˜marital debtâ€™ is debt incurred for the\r\n  joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally jointly liable for the debt or whether one party is legally\r\n  individually liable.â€Â  Hardy\r\n    v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436-37, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993) (emphasis\r\n  in original). Â The same rules of fairness and equity that apply to the\r\n  equitable distribution of marital property also apply to the equitable division of marital\r\n  debts.Â  Id. at 437, 429 S.E.2d at 814. Â â€œ[T]he\r\n  burden of proving a spouseâ€™s debt as nonmarital rests upon that party who makes\r\n  such [an] assertion.â€Â  Id. at 437, 429 S.E.2d at 814. Â It is a â€œrebuttable\r\n  presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to the beginning of\r\n  marital litigation is a marital debt and must be factored\r\n  in the totality of equitable apportionment.â€Â Wooten\r\n    v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 546, 615 S.E.2d 98, 105 (2005).Â  \r\nWife testified she expected Husband to be unemployed during the\r\n  ninety-day visa application process, and she had accepted a second job coaching\r\n  three evenings a week to get them through this period.Â  Husband testified he\r\n  sold his assets before he left Canada and arrived in the United States with only a leased car, personal effects, and between $2,000 and $6,000.Â  Husband\r\nagreed he was totally dependent on Wife during that time.Â  \r\nHusband did not begin working until May 2005, nine months after\r\n  their marriage.Â  Wife testified Husband\r\n  did not contribute financially to their marriage, even after he began earning approximately $1,800 a month working at\r\n  Ashley Furniture.Â  She testified\r\n  his only financial contribution to their marriage was $150.[3]Â  Husband did not dispute Wifeâ€™s trial\r\n  testimony and agreed he had not paid any medical bills or contacted the childrenâ€™s\r\n  health care providers to negotiate a payment plan. Â Additionally, Husband did\r\n  not contradict Wifeâ€™s testimony that she made monthly payments on Husbandâ€™s\r\n  outstanding Canadian debts, paid Husbandâ€™s INS application fee of $1,000, paid\r\n  his speeding tickets, and gave him money to open a checking account.Â  Husband stated\r\n  they dined frequently at restaurants, took short vacations together, and purchased\r\n  nursery furniture.Â  Husband also testified he â€œspent many nights in motels just\r\ntrying to get away . . . .â€Â  \r\nWife presented documentation showing her credit card debt had\r\n  increased from $4,500 at the time she married Husband to $36,560 when they separated\r\n  a year later.Â  Wife testified her savings of $8,500 were depleted by paying\r\n  bills related to their household expenses.Â  Wife additionally testified they\r\n  borrowed $4,500 from her mother and $5,460 from her aunt to pay their bills. Â Husband\r\n  testified he was aware of these loans.Â  At trial, Wife presented a summary\r\n  showing $36,560 in marital debt, exclusive of unpaid medical bills.Â  Wife\r\n  introduced this summary into evidence without objection.Â  Husband did not\r\n  challenge Wifeâ€™s statement of marital debt at trial.\r\nAccordingly, we find the family court did not abuse its discretion\r\n  in adopting Wifeâ€™s summary of $36,560 in marital debt, and ordering Husband and\r\n  Wife to evenly divide the debt with Husband paying $300 per month to Wife until\r\n  his $18,280 obligation is satisfied.Â  See Honea v. Honea,\r\n  292 S.C. 456, 458, 357 S.E.2d 191, 192 (Ct. App. 1987) (â€œThe trial courtâ€™s\r\n  findings come to us with a presumption of correctness.Â  The burden is on [Appellant]\r\n  to demonstrate the family court committed reversible error.Â  . . . Â [A] party\r\n  cannot sit back at trial without offering proof, then come to this Court\r\n  complaining of the insufficiency of the evidence to support the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings.â€). Â \r\nE.&nbsp; Equitable\r\n  Division of the Marital Estate \r\nHusband argues the family court failed to properly apportion the\r\n  marital estate.Â  We disagree. \r\nSection 20-7-473 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2007)\r\n  defines marital property as â€œall real and personal property which has been\r\n  acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date\r\n  of filing or commencement of marital litigation.â€Â  However, the statute specifically\r\n  excludes from marital property, â€œproperty acquired by either party before the\r\n  marriage,â€ and states â€œ[t]he court\r\n  does not have jurisdiction or authority to apportion nonmarital\r\n  property.â€ Â Id.\r\nâ€œFamily\r\n  court judges have wide discretion in determining how marital property is to be distributed. Â They may use any\r\n  reasonable means to divide the property equitably, and\r\n  their judgment will not be disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Murphy\r\n    v. Murphy, 319 S.C. 324, 329, 461 S.E.2d 39, 41-42 (1995). Â Property\r\n  which is nonmarital at the time of its acquisition may be transmuted into\r\n  marital property â€œ(1) if it becomes so commingled with marital property as to\r\n  be untraceable; (2) if it is titled jointly; or (3) if it is utilized by the\r\n  parties in support of the marriage or in some other manner so as to evidence an\r\n  intent by the parties to make it marital property.â€ Â Johnson v. Johnson,\r\n  296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nWife testified she owned her Spartanburg home and its furnishings\r\n  prior to her marriage.Â  She testified no marital property was acquired during\r\n  the marriage.Â  Husband did not challenge Wifeâ€™s\r\n  testimony.Â  The record contains no facts to support transmutation\r\n  of Wifeâ€™s separate property into marital property.Â  Moreover, Husband did not\r\n  offer evidence showing any marital property was acquired.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  family court did not abuse its discretion in declaring the property in Wifeâ€™s\r\n  possession, including the home she purchased prior to her marriage, to be nonmarital\r\n  property. \r\nF.&nbsp; Childrenâ€™s\r\n  Future Medical Bills \r\nHusband\r\n  contends the family court erred in ordering him to pay thirty-six percent of the\r\n  childrenâ€™s future medical bills that are not covered by health insurance.Â  While\r\n  Husband does not dispute the courtâ€™s authority to determine a parentâ€™s\r\n  contribution towards medical costs, he contends â€œthe figure of 36% appears from\r\n  thin air.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAs stated above, based upon testimony concerning his prospective\r\n  employment in Canada, we projected monthly gross income to him of $2,080.Â  Wifeâ€™s\r\n  gross monthly income is $3,916, from which $153 a month is deducted for the\r\n  childrenâ€™s health insurance.Â  As a result, Husbandâ€™s imputed income of $2,080 comprises\r\n  thirty-six percent of the $5,843 total monthly gross income available to\r\n  Husband and Wife.Â  Accordingly, we find the family court properly determined\r\n  Husbandâ€™s share of the childrenâ€™s future uninsured medical bills.Â  \r\nG.&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™\r\n  Fees. \r\nHusband\r\n  contends the family court erred in ordering Husband to pay $5,000 towards\r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  award of attorneysâ€™ fees will not be overturned absent an abuse of discretion. Â Stevenson\r\n    v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d 901, 903 (1988). Â â€œIn deciding\r\n  whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees, the family court should consider the partiesâ€™\r\n  ability to pay their own fee, the beneficial results obtained by counsel, the\r\n  respective financial conditions of the parties, and the effect of the fee on\r\n  each partyâ€™s standard of living.â€ Â Arnal v. Arnal, 363 S.C. 268, 290,\r\n  609 S.E.2d 821, 833 (Ct. App. 2005), affâ€™d as modified, 371 S.C. 10, 636\r\n  S.E.2d 864 (2006).Â  When the family court finds an award of attorneysâ€™ fees is\r\n  justified, the amount of fees should be determined by considering: (1) the\r\n  nature, extent, and difficulty of the case; (2) the time necessarily devoted to\r\n  the case; (3) counselâ€™s professional standing; (4) the contingency of\r\n  compensation; (5) the beneficial results obtained; and (6) the customary legal\r\n  fees for similar services.Â  Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 161,\r\n  403 S.E.2d 313, 315 (1991). \r\nWifeâ€™s attorney submitted a fee affidavit documenting\r\n  fees of $8,481 in this action.Â  Based on the beneficial results obtained by\r\n  Wife and the time necessarily devoted to the case, we find no abuse of discretion\r\n  in the courtâ€™s decision to order Husband to pay $5,000 toward Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees.Â  Accordingly, the order of the family court is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE\r\nand THOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to\r\nRule 215, SCACR.\r\n[2] Husbandâ€™s testimony revealed the financial\r\ndeclarations he submitted to the family court were inaccurate. \r\n[3] Wife stated Husband gave her $150 to pay a bill after\r\n  their marriage counselor told him to make a contribution to the marriage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"4379","title":"Madren v.

Williams, Jr., Circuit Court\r\nJudge\r\nOpinion No. 4379\r\nHeard March 5, 2008 â€“ Filed April 28, 2008 \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn S. Nichols, of Columbia, W. ScottÂ  Palmer, of Santee, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tMax G. Mahaffee, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTHOMAS, J.: Thomas\r\n  Bradford appeals the trial courtâ€™s finding he breached a real estate contract\r\n  with Clyde and Nancy Madren and the resulting award of $55,000.Â  Bradford also\r\n  appeals the trial courtâ€™s finding that Clyde Madren is not barred from bringing\r\n  suit under South Carolina licensing statutes.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  2002, Clyde and Nancy Madren purchased a tract of land in St. George for\r\n  $82,000.Â  The Madrens divided the tract into three parcels with houses on two\r\n  of the parcels while the third parcel was a vacant lot.Â  A house at 703 Raysor Street was situated on one of the three parcels.Â  The Madrens were remodeling the\r\n  Raysor Street house (House) in August 2002 when Thomas and Miriam Bradford\r\n  approached them about purchasing the House.Â  \r\nThe Madrens and Bradfords entered into a Buy and Sell Residential\r\n  Real Estate Contract (Contract) on August 31, 2002. Â The Contract specified\r\n  October 15, 2002, as the closing date. Â The\r\n  Contract was subject to the Bradfords obtaining $120,000 in financing. Â Â In order\r\n  for the Bradfords to secure the necessary financing, the bank required a home appraisal.Â  The Bradfords believed the Madrens would complete several\r\n  home renovations before a closing could take place.Â  Thomas Bradford and Nancy Madren\r\n  communicated numerous times through phone calls and emails regarding renovations, when appraisers could look at the House, and when the closing could\r\n  occur. Â Such communications continued past the Contractâ€™s October 15 closing\r\n  date.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 31, 2002, the Madrens notified the Bradfords renovations were complete\r\n  and the House was ready for a â€œwalk-through.â€Â  Five days later Thomas Bradford\r\n  responded with an e-mail stating he and his wife no longer intended to purchase\r\n  the House.Â  According to Thomas Bradford, they chose not to purchase the House\r\n  because they did not want to extend the closing date any further. \r\nOn December 31,\r\n  2002, the Madrens brought an action for breach of contract and specific\r\n  performance[1] against the Bradfords.Â  Bradford[2] moved to dismiss the Madrensâ€™ claim on the grounds that Clyde Madren did not\r\n  have a contractorâ€™s license. Â The trial court denied the motion to dismiss. Â The\r\n  trial court found the parties had entered into a binding contract in which time\r\n  was not of the essence.Â  Due to his emails, the trial court found Thomas\r\n  Bradford waived compliance with the Contractâ€™s closing date. Â In addition to finding the Bradfords breached the\r\n  Contract, the trial court further held\r\n  the Bradfords could not defend their breach based on the partiesâ€™ failure to meet the agreed closing date.Â  The trial court awarded the Madrens\r\n  $55,000 in damages.Â  Bradford appealed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn\r\n  appeal of a case tried without a jury, the appellate courtâ€™s jurisdiction is\r\n  limited to correction of errors at law.Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley,\r\n  365 S.C. 157, 164, 616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005).Â  The judgeâ€™s findings are\r\n  equivalent to a juryâ€™s findings in a law action.Â  King v. PYA/Monarch, Inc.,\r\n  317 S.C. 385, 389, 453 S.E.2d 885, 888 (1995).Â  Questions regarding credibility\r\n  and weight of evidence are exclusively for the trial judge.Â  Sheek v.\r\n    Crimestoppers Alarm Sys., 297 S.C. 375, 377, 377 S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App.\r\n  1989). The appellate court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s findings of fact\r\n  as long as they are reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Epworth, 365\r\n  S.C. at 164, 616 S.E.2d at 714.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Contractorâ€™s License\r\nBradford argues the trial court erred in denying his motion to\r\n  dismiss based on Section 40-11-30 of the South Carolina Code (2006).Â \r\n  Specifically, Bradford argues the Contract should not be enforced because Clyde\r\n  Madren, in his sole proprietorship, did not possess a contractorâ€™s license.Â  We\r\n  find this affirmative defense was not appropriately pled.\r\nApproximately\r\n  one month before the trial commenced, Bradford filed[3] a motion to dismiss arguing Clyde Madren did not possess a contractorâ€™s license\r\n  as required by South Carolina Code Section 40-11-30, et seq. (1976).Â  Bradford\r\n  further argued the Madrensâ€™ action was barred under South Carolina licensing\r\n  statutes that state, â€œ[a]n entity which does not have a valid license as\r\n  required by this chapter may not bring an action either at law or in equity to\r\n  enforce the provisions of a contract.â€ S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-11-370 (1976).Â  Bradford had filed his answer and counterclaim a year and nine months prior with no mention\r\n  of any licensing statute.Â  Bradford did not file an amended answer asserting any\r\n  affirmative defenses in the interim.Â  At the beginning of the trial, the trial\r\n  court denied Bradfordâ€™s motion to dismiss based on the lack of a contractorâ€™s\r\n  license.Â  A post-trial Rule 59(e) motion to reconsider was also denied. \r\nA\r\n  party, in replying to a preceding pleading, shall affirmatively set forth his\r\n  defenses to the opposing partyâ€™s complaint. Rule 8(c),\r\n    SCRCP. â€œEvery defense, in law or fact, to a cause of action in any\r\n  pleadingâ€¦ shall be asserted in the responsive pleading thereto....â€ Rule 12(b),\r\n    SCRCP.Â  Generally, affirmative defenses to a cause of action in any pleading\r\n  must be asserted in a partyâ€™s responsive pleading. Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 85, 650 S.E.2d 465, 470 (2007) (citing Wright v. Craft, 372 S.C. 1, 20-21, 640 S.E.2d 486, 497 (Ct. App. 2006)).Â \r\n  Statutory prohibition is in the nature of an affirmative defense precluding\r\n  enforcement of a contract and should be pled.Â  Costa and Sons Const. Co. v.\r\n    Long, 306 S.C. 465, 469, 412 S.E.2d 450, 453 (Ct. App. 1991) (citing Rule\r\n  8(c), SCRCP).\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  failure to plead an affirmative defense is deemed a waiver of the right to\r\n  assert it.â€Â  Whitehead v. State, 352 S.C. 215, 220, 574 S.E.2d 200, 202\r\n  (2002).Â  Rule 15(b), SCRCP, provides an exception to the waiver rule by\r\n  permitting a party to amend his pleadings to conform to the evidence. Â No such\r\n  motion was ever made by Bradford.Â  We find Bradford should not be able to argue\r\n  for a potential benefit from an affirmative defense without his being required\r\n  to affirmatively plead it.Â  See Parrish v. Allison, Op. No. 4322\r\n  (S.C. Ct. App. Filed Dec. 19, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 43 at 58), 656 S.E.2d\r\n  382 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s denial of the motion on this\r\n  basis.[4]\r\nII.Â  Extension of Closing\r\n  Date\r\nBradford\r\n  next contends the trial court erred in ruling that by his action, conduct, and\r\n  written word, Bradford agreed to extend the closing date beyond October 28,\r\n  2003.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  written contract may be modified by the parties thereto in any manner they\r\n  choose, notwithstanding, agreement prohibiting its alteration except in a\r\n  particular manner.â€Â  Evatt v. Campbell, 234 S.C. 1, 6-7, 106 S.E.2d 447,\r\n  450 (1959).Â  Additionally:Â  \r\n\r\n\tIt is\r\n  well established in this state that time is not of the essence of a contract to\r\n  convey land unless made so by its terms expressly or by implication. When the\r\n  contract does not include a provision that â€œtime is of the essence,â€ the law\r\n  implies that it is to be done within a reasonable time. In equity, strict\r\n  compliance with time limits contained in a contract will not ordinarily be enforced,\r\n  except with regard to option contracts. \r\n\r\nFaulkner v. Millar, 319 S.C. 216, 219-20, 460 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1995)\r\n  (citations omitted).\r\nThe\r\n  determination of whether Bradfordâ€™s actions constituted waiver is a question of\r\n  fact.Â  See Hobgood v. Pennington, 300 S.C. 309, 314, 387 S.E.2d\r\n  690, 693 (Ct. App. 1989) (â€œWhere time is not originally of the essence, it may\r\n  be made so by one party giving notice to the other that he will insist on\r\n  performance by a certain date, provided the time allowed by the notice is\r\n  reasonable, which is a question of fact for the jury depending on the\r\n  circumstances of the particular case.â€);Â  Atkinson v. Atkinson, 279 S.C.\r\n  454, 455, 309 S.E.2d 14, 15 (Ct. App. 1983) (stating a finding of fact depends\r\n  on a courtâ€™s decision of â€œwhether a certain event either did or did not occur\r\n  or that a particular circumstance either did or did not exist.â€)Â  Therefore,\r\n  the issue before us is whether the trial courtâ€™s finding, that Bradfordâ€™s conduct waived strict compliance, is reasonably supported by evidence contained\r\n  in the record.Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C. 157, 164,\r\n  616 S.E.2d 710, 714 (2005).Â  We find the record contains such support.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Contract stated the â€œClosing Date shall be October 15, 2002,â€ it did not indicate\r\n  time was of the essence.Â  Additionally, the Contract stated, â€œ[b]uyer shall\r\n  notify Seller or listing agent in writing, by 12:00 noon 10 days from date\r\n  Buyer is notified house is complete of any deficiencies revealed by\r\n  inspection.â€Â  The Bradfords entered into the Contract understanding a lot of\r\n  work still needed to be completed on the House.Â Â Â  Furthermore, Clyde Madren\r\n  testified he told the Bradfords, â€œ[W]ith any renovation, when you get into it,\r\n  you donâ€™t know what youâ€™re going to find beyond the next wall, and there, there\r\n  could be some slow downs.â€Â  From the beginning the Bradfords knew the\r\n  completion of the renovations would actually set the closing date.Â  \r\nNumerous\r\n  emails between the parties also evidence the agreed upon changes in the closing\r\n  dates.Â  In one particular example, on October 21, 2002, seven days after the\r\n  closing date of the Contract, Bradford emailed Nancy Madren after his mortgage\r\n  companyâ€™s appraiser had not finished the appraisal.Â  Bradford wrote, â€œ[i]n\r\n  light of this, doesnâ€™t look like we can close this week.Â  Monday the 28th is the earliest target.â€Â  In another email Bradford wrote, â€œ[w]hen you have a\r\n  schedule for finishing the remaining items, please furnish it, and your estimated\r\n    closing date so we can set up another.â€ (emphasis added).Â  On October 31,\r\n  2002, the Madrens notified Bradford the renovations were complete and the house\r\n  was ready for a walk-through.Â  In response, Bradford sent an email stating he\r\n  and his wife decided against purchasing the House. Â By this time, the Madrens\r\n  had complied with Bradfordâ€™s many renovation requests.Â  Consequently, Bradfordâ€™s own requests further delayed the closing date. \r\nWe\r\n  hold the aforementioned evidence reasonably supports the trial courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that Bradfordâ€™s conduct modified the closing date in his real estate contract\r\n  with the Madrens.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  \r\nIII.&nbsp; Amount of Damages\r\nBradford contends the trial court erred in awarding damages of\r\n  $55,000 to the Madrens.Â  Bradford argues the figure was not supported by sufficient evidence and was instead based\r\n  on surmise and speculation.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nWhen calculating\r\n  damages for breach of contract, damages should place a nonbreaching party in\r\n  the position he would have enjoyed had the contract been performed.Â  Collins\r\n    Entmâ€™t., Inc. v. White, 363 S.C. 546, 559, 611 S.E.2d 262, 268-69 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005).Â  Generally, damages will consist of â€œ(1) out-of-pocket costs actually\r\n  incurred as a result of the contract; and (2) the gain above costs that would\r\n  have been realized had the contract been performed.â€ Id. at 559, 611\r\n  S.E.2d at 269.Â  Though a party need not prove damages with mathematical\r\n  certainty, the evidence should allow a court to reasonably determine an\r\n  appropriate amount.Â  Yadkin Brick Co. v. Materials Recovery Co., 339 S.C. 640, 646, 529 S.E.2d 764, 767 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  Furthermore, an amount of\r\n  damages cannot be left to conjecture, guess, or speculation.Â  Collins,\r\n  363 S.C. at 559, 611 S.E.2d at 269.\r\nIn\r\n  the present action, Clyde Madren testified the couple invested $40,000 of labor and materials into the home.Â  Madren also\r\n  testified he and his wife purchased the\r\n  entire tract of land for $82,000 and subdivided it into three separate parcels, one of\r\n  which contained the House.Â  Of the\r\n  $82,000 originally spent to purchase the single tract, Madren attributed $25,000\r\n  of the purchase price to the Raysor Street house.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order explained the $55,000 in damages was calculated\r\n  by subtracting the Madrensâ€™ original purchase price for the House ($25,000) and\r\n  the Madrensâ€™ estimated cost of labor and materials ($40,000) from the\r\n  Contractâ€™s purchase price of the House ($120,000). \r\nAdditionally, Bradford argues Clyde Madren arbitrarily assigned the $25,000 purchase price to the Raysor Street home, and consequently the $55,000 in damages is without basis.Â  However, Bradford offered no evidence for the value of the House when it was purchased by the\r\n  Madrens, so he cannot now protest the trial courtâ€™s adoption of Madrenâ€™s value,\r\n  as it was the only value offered to the court.Â  Hough v. Hough, 312 S.C.\r\n  344, 347, 440 S.E.2d 387, 389 (Ct. App. 1994) (holding a husband who failed to\r\n  present any evidence on issue of valuation of marital estate could not complain\r\n  on appeal that trial court erred in its valuation of the estate).\r\nWe\r\n  find the trial court properly calculated damages based on the criteria set\r\n  forth in Collins, 363 S.C. at 559, 611 S.E.2d at 268-9.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we believe Clyde Madrenâ€™s testimony amounted to evidence from which the trial court\r\n  could reasonably determine an appropriate damage award under Yadkin, 339\r\n  S.C. at 646, 529 S.E.2d at 767.Â  â€œIn a law case tried without a jury, questions\r\n  regarding credibility and weight of evidence are exclusively for the trial\r\n  judge.â€Â  Sheek v. Crimestoppers Alarm Systems, 297 S.C. 375, 377, 377\r\n  S.E.2d 132, 133 (Ct. App. 1989).Â  We therefore defer to the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  decision to believe Clyde Madrenâ€™s testimony regarding financial figures and\r\n  use those figures in calculating damages.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the order of the trial court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and\r\nKITTREDGE J., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Madrens later abandoned their specific\r\nperformance claim because the House was in foreclosure.Â  \r\n[2] Miriam Bradford passed away before the trial of this\r\naction. \r\n[3] Bradfordâ€™s counsel at trial differed from his counsel\r\non appeal.Â  \r\n[4] This court may affirm the trial court based on any\r\ngrounds found in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR; Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.

David Ware.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nVortex, formed in 2000 in Columbia, South Carolina, is a sports agency corporation.Â  Ware and Bralyn Bennett each\r\n  owned one-third of Vortex, and Terry Williams and Walt Gee each owned one-sixth.Â \r\n  Ware was the President of Vortexâ€™s Team Sports Division and served as Vortexâ€™s\r\n  attorney.Â  Vortex did not issue any stock or formalize the corporation in\r\n  writing.Â  Vortexâ€™s clients were primarily National Football League (NFL) players\r\n  to whom it provided financial, legal, and marketing assistance.Â  The owners\r\n  agreed Bennett would be the only paid employee and the other owners would be\r\n  paid once Vortex made a profit.Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  NFL, sports agents and players enter into Standard Representation Agreements\r\n  (SRAs).Â  SRAs permit an agent to negotiate on the playerâ€™s behalf. Â Under NFL\r\n  policy, SRAs can only be signed by the agent.Â  Industry custom includes agents who\r\n  verbally assign their SRAs to the companies with whom they are affiliated.Â  An SRA\r\n  generally includes a â€œcompensation for serviceâ€ clause entitling the agent to a\r\n  certain percentage of the playerâ€™s compensation in exchange for the agentâ€™s\r\n  services in negotiating the contract.Â  The NFL limits the agentâ€™s maximum\r\n  compensation to three percent.Â  A player may terminate an SRA with five daysâ€™\r\n  notice to the agent.Â  NFL teams do not give players guaranteed contracts, and\r\n  thus, agentsâ€™ fees are not guaranteed. \r\nBennett\r\n  and Ware were Vortexâ€™s sports agents.Â  When Vortex began operating, Bennett represented\r\n  three players and Ware represented one player.Â  When those players were paid,\r\n  Vortex would receive the agentâ€™s fees.Â  Â Vortex pledged the income stream from\r\n  all of its SRAs as collateral for its bank loans.Â  \r\nIn 2001,\r\n  Vortex signed five new clients.Â  By spring of 2003, Vortex had twenty clients,\r\n  including Terence Newman of the Dallas Cowboys and Clinton Portis of the\r\n  Washington Redskins.Â  Vortex anticipated earning $400,000 to $500,000 solely\r\n  from Newmanâ€™s contract.Â  Vortex, however, was still a fledging company with a\r\n  substantial amount of debt to service.Â  It was not yet profitable and Bennett\r\n  no longer received an annual salary.\r\nIn 2003, Ware began negotiating, on Vortexâ€™s\r\n  behalf, with CSMG, an Illinois sports agency that was considering acquiring\r\n  Vortex.Â  Vortex believed CSMG would provide marketing services for Vortexâ€™s\r\n  clients but Vortex would continue providing contract negotiations.Â  However,\r\n  this never came to fruition.Â  Unbeknowst to Vortex, CSMG began negotiating with\r\n  Ware for him to leave Vortex and join CSMG with his Vortex clients.Â  Ultimately,\r\n  Ware began working for CSMG while he was still an officer, shareholder, and\r\n  attorney for Vortex.\r\nCSMG agreed to pay Ware a signing bonus of\r\n  $200,000 and an annual salary of $150,000.Â  Additionally, Ware would receive\r\n  half of the revenues collected from players with whom he had signed SRAs.Â  Once\r\n  Ware left Vortex for CSMG, less than half of Vortexâ€™s twenty clients stayed\r\n  with Vortex, while the others left for CSMG or other agencies. \r\nVortex filed suit against: (1) Ware; (2) CSMG;\r\n  (3) Constangy, Brooks &amp; Smith, Wareâ€™s law firm for the majority of the time\r\n  he served as Vortexâ€™s attorney; and (4) Ware and Associates, Wareâ€™s law firm\r\n  when he first became Vortexâ€™s attorney.Â  The causes of action against CSMG\r\n  included aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and tortious\r\n  interference with a contract.Â  Prior to trial, Vortex settled with all parties\r\n  except CSMG.Â  \r\nAt trial, CSMG moved for directed verdicts\r\n  on aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary duty and tortious interference\r\n  with a contract.Â  The trial court denied the motions.Â  Ultimately, the jury\r\n  found for Vortex on both of those causes of action.[1] Â The jury awarded Vortex $2,200,000\r\n  in actual damages and $500,000 in punitive damages.Â  The trial court reduced Vortexâ€™s\r\n  award by the settlements received from the other defendants.Â  This appeal\r\n  followed.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. CSMGâ€™s Appeal\r\nA.Â \r\n  Directed Verdict\r\nCSMG\r\n  argues the trial court erred in denying its directed verdict motions.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nWhen ruling on a directed verdict motion, the trial court is required\r\n  to view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom\r\n  in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  \r\nSabb v. South Carolina State Univ., 350 S.C. 416, 427, 567 S.E.2d 231, 236 (2002).Â \r\n  This court must follow the same standard.Â  Welch v. Epstein, 342\r\n  S.C. 279, 299, 536 S.E.2d 408, 418 (Ct. App. 2000). Â â€œIf more\r\n  than one reasonable inference can be drawn or if the inferences to be drawn\r\n  from the evidence are in doubt, the case should be submitted to the jury.â€Â  \r\nChaney v. Burgess, 246 S.C. 261, 266, 143 S.E.2d\r\n  521, 523 (1965). Â This court will only reverse the circuit\r\n  court when no evidence supports its ruling.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t\r\n    of Labor, Licensing, &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142,\r\n  148 (1999).\r\n1.Â  Aiding and Abetting a Breach of Fiduciary Duty\r\nCSMG argues the trial court erred in denying its\r\n  motion for a directed verdict on Vortexâ€™s aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty cause of action because Vortex offered no evidence from which a jury could\r\n  find CSMG knowingly assisted and participated in Wareâ€™s breach.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  elements for the cause of action of aiding and abetting a breach of fiduciary\r\n  duty are: (1) a breach of a fiduciary duty owed to the plaintiff; (2) the\r\n  defendantâ€™s knowing participation in the breach; and (3) damages. Â Future\r\n    Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 99, 478 S.E.2d 45, 50&nbsp;(1996).Â \r\n  â€œThe gravamen of the claim is the defendantâ€™s knowing participation in the\r\n  fiduciaryâ€™s breach.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe trial court ruled Ware owed Vortex a fiduciary\r\n  duty.Â  Vortex presented evidence CSMG encouraged Ware not to pay Vortex the\r\n  money he received on SRAs he signed before he left for CSMG.Â  Ware emailed\r\n  David Schwartz, CSMGâ€™s senior vice-president and general counsel, stating:\r\n\r\n\tI\r\n  realize that our deal is a little different since CSMG wants all my clients and\r\n  the fees due to me but is not assuming the debt of VORTEX.Â  Although I donâ€™t\r\n  wholly own VORTEX I still have to pay the debt but I have no problem giving\r\n  CSMG any fees that I am entitled to. \r\n\r\nSchwartz responded: â€œI have\r\n  added language which will, in a sense, give your guarantee that you will make\r\n  CSMG whole if there are third-party claimants to the fees paid or owed by your\r\n  clients, so weâ€™re willing to dump the whole asset purchase agreement.â€Â  The\r\n  language Schwartz referred to was a clause in CSMGâ€™s employment agreement with\r\n  Ware, which stated:\r\n\r\n\tAs\r\n  consideration for entering into this Employment Agreement, [CSMG] expects to\r\n  receive the fees currently owed to [Ware] by the clients set forth on Exhibit A\r\n  [Vortexâ€™s Clients], as well as future fees that will be owed by such clients. .\r\n  . .Â  [Ware] agrees that if any fees due to be paid . . . are diminished or\r\n  delayed because a third party claims entitlement to such fees, or because the\r\n  client contends the fees are owed to a third party, then [Ware] shall promptly\r\n  pay to [CSMG] an amount that would make [CSMG] whole . . . .â€Â  \r\n\r\nMarty Pereira, CSMGâ€™s Executive\r\n  Vice-President and Chief Financial Officer, stated in an email: â€œAfter having a\r\n  couple of conversations with [Ware], I think I have [him] convinced that he\r\n  should not pay off the loan, in any manner, until some kind of agreement is\r\n  reached with Vortex.â€ Â We note CSMG originally approached Vortex seeking\r\n  to acquire the entire company, and later, enter into a collaborative venture,\r\n  but ultimately decided only to hire Ware, who held the majority of Vortexâ€™s\r\n  SRAs.Â  \r\nCSMG\r\n  argues it had no actual knowledge of Wareâ€™s breach of fiduciary duties to\r\n  Vortex nor did it substantially assist Ware with the breach.Â  However, Vortex\r\n  presented evidence CSMG knew Ware was one of several partners and the attorney\r\n  for Vortex, not simply an employee.Â  There is also evidence CSMG knew Ware had\r\n  certain financial obligations to Vortex, even if he was no longer an employee.Â \r\n  Therefore, there is evidence CSMG had actual knowledge Ware owed a fiduciary\r\n  duty to Vortex.Â  Further, there is evidence CSMG knowingly encouraged Ware to breach\r\n  that duty because there is evidence it encouraged Ware to withhold the SRA fees\r\n  from Vortex.Â  Accordingly, because Vortex presented evidence CSMG aided and\r\n  abetted in a breach of fiduciary duty, the trial court did not err in denying\r\n  the directed verdict motion.\r\n2.Â  Tortious Interference with a Contract \r\nCSMG next contends\r\n  the trial court erred in denying its motion for a directed verdict on Vortexâ€™s\r\n  tortious interference with a contract action because Vortex presented no\r\n  evidence CSMG: (1) knew of Vortexâ€™s contract with Ware; (2) knew hiring Ware\r\n  interfered with that contract; or (3) lacked justification to hire Ware.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  elements of a cause of action for tortious interference with contract are: (1)\r\n  existence of a valid contract; (2) the wrongdoerâ€™s knowledge thereof; (3) his\r\n  intentional procurement of its breach; (4) the absence of justification; and\r\n  (5) resulting damages.â€ Â Camp v. Springs Mortgage Corp.,&nbsp;310 S.C.\r\n  514, 517, 426 S.E.2d 304, 305&nbsp;(1993).\r\nThere\r\n  is evidence CSMG knew Ware was responsible for debt repayment.Â  Further, the\r\n  inclusion of the clause in the employment contract providing that Ware would be\r\n  responsible for any fees from clients in which a third party demanded an\r\n  interest is evidence CSMG anticipated Vortex might claim entitlement to the\r\n  fees.Â  We also note CSMG had previously convinced Fletcher Smith, III, an\r\n  attorney and CSMGâ€™s executive vice-president of sports, to leave the law firm\r\n  where he was employed to work for CSMG.Â  CSMG knew Smithâ€™s former law firm required\r\n  him to pay the law firm money received under SRAs Smith signed while working\r\n  for the law firm.Â  Although Ware was an at-will employee of Vortex, and thus,\r\n  free to leave at any time, he also had certain obligations to Vortex in his\r\n  positions as shareholder, vice-president, and general counsel.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Ware had an agreement with Vortex to forward to Vortex the income from his\r\n  SRAs. Â Clearly, as acknowledged by CSMGâ€™s emails, it had some knowledge that income\r\n  from Wareâ€™s SRAs would go to the outstanding debt of Vortex.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find Vortex presented evidence for each of the elements of tortious\r\n  interference with a contract, and thus, the trial court did not err in denying\r\n  CSMGâ€™s directed verdict motion on the cause of action.\r\nB.Â  Expert\r\n  Witness\r\nCSMG maintains the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting Professor Freemanâ€™s expert testimony.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nJohn\r\n  Freeman is a professor of law at the University of South Carolina School of Law\r\n  and teaches, inter alia, business, agency and partnership, and legal\r\n  ethics.Â  Professor Freeman was qualified as an expert â€œin the field of duties\r\n  owed by corporate lawyers, officers, or shareholders in connection with\r\n  transactions involving business in a South Carolina closed corporation.â€Â  Before\r\n  Professor Freeman testified, the trial court conducted a hearing to determine the\r\n  admissibility of his testimony.Â  CSMG argued Professor Freeman should not be\r\n  allowed to testify because he would be making a legal conclusion as to whether\r\n  Ware owed Vortex a fiduciary duty.Â  The trial court determined the issue of the\r\n  existence of the fiduciary duty was for the court and ruled Ware owed Vortex a\r\n  fiduciary duty.Â  Â The trial court ruled Professor Freeman could â€œtestify as to\r\n  what occurred as far as breach of duties are concerned.â€ \r\nâ€œIf\r\n  scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will assist the trier of\r\n  fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, a witness\r\n  qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education,\r\n  may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€Â  Rule 702, SCRE.Â  When\r\n  expert testimony is based upon facts sufficient to form the basis for an\r\n  opinion, the trier of fact determines its probative value. Â Small v. Pioneer\r\n    Mach., Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 470, 494 S.E.2d 835, 846&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1997).Â  Generally,\r\n  expert testimony pertaining to issues\r\n    of law is inadmissible. Â Dawkins v. Fields,&nbsp;354\r\n  S.C. 58, 66, 580 S.E.2d 433, 437&nbsp;(2003).Â  â€œA trial courtâ€™s ruling to\r\n  exclude or admit expert testimony will not be disturbed on appeal absent a\r\n  clear abuse of discretion.â€ Mizell v. Glover,&nbsp;351 S.C. 392, 406,\r\n  570 S.E.2d 176, 183&nbsp;(2002).Â  \r\nCSMG relies on Dawkins,\r\n  in which the supreme court found an affidavit by Professor Freeman inadmissible.Â \r\n  354 S.C. at 66-67, 580 S.E.2d at 437.Â  In Dawkins, the supreme court\r\n  found most of the document was legal argument regarding why the trial court\r\n  should deny summary judgment.Â  Id.Â  The supreme court stated: â€œProfessor\r\n  Freemanâ€™s affidavit inappropriately attempted to usurp the trial courtâ€™s role\r\n  in determining whether petitioners were entitled to summary judgment.â€ Â Id. at 65, 580 S.E.2d at 437.Â  However, the supreme court noted an opinion is not\r\n  objectionable simply because it embraces an ultimate issue to be decided by the\r\n  trier of fact. Â Id. Â The supreme court also found the affidavit contained\r\n  â€œsome helpful, factual information,â€ such as, Professor\r\n  Freemanâ€™s opinion on the value of stock and that selling it for significantly\r\n  less than that value was improper.Â  Id. at 66, 580 S.E.2d at 437.\r\nIn the present\r\n  case, the trial court ruled on the legal issue of whether Ware owed Vortex a\r\n  fiduciary duty.Â  See Clearwater Trust v. Bunting, 367 S.C. 340, 346,\r\n  626 S.E.2d 334, 337 (2006) (noting the existence of a fiduciary duty is a\r\n  question of law for the court).Â  Professor Freemanâ€™s testimony consisted of\r\n  specific acts Ware committed and how those acts constituted a breach of his fiduciary\r\n  duty.Â  Specifically, Professor Freeman testified Ware participated in\r\n  self-dealing by sacrificing Vortexâ€™s interests for Wareâ€™s own interest.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Professor Freeman testified Ware was deceptive to Vortex.Â  Professor Freeman\r\n  noted the lack of documents detailing Vortexâ€™s agreements and policies and\r\n  testified Ware, as Vortexâ€™s general counsel, would have been responsible for\r\n  preparing such agreements and his failure to do so should not entitle him to a â€œfree\r\n  pass.â€ \r\nWe\r\n  find Professor Freemanâ€™s testimony consisted of specialized knowledge that assisted\r\n  the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.Â \r\n  He was qualified as an expert, and thus, was allowed to testify as to his\r\n  opinion relating to those facts.Â  He did not make improper legal conclusions or\r\n  instructions but simply opined regarding acts Ware committed that breached his\r\n  fiduciary duty.Â Â  Accordingly, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in\r\n  admitting Professor Freemanâ€™s expert testimony.\r\nC.Â  Damages\r\nCSMG argues the\r\n  trial court erred in admitting speculative evidence of damages consisting of Vortexâ€™s\r\n  lost revenue from renegotiated contracts.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial court is vested with considerable discretion\r\n  over the amount of a damages award, and our review of the amount of\r\n  damages is limited to the correction of errors of law. Â Austin v. Specialty Transp.\r\n    Servs, Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 310-11, 594 S.E.2d 867, 873 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004).Â  In reviewing a damages award, we do not\r\n  weigh the evidence, but determine if any evidence supports the award.Â  Id. at 311, 594 S.E.2d at 873.\r\nWhen\r\n  the tortious conduct of a defendant causes a plaintiff to lose prospective\r\n  profits, the plaintiff may recover such profits when he can prove: (1) it is\r\n  reasonably certain that such profits would have been realized except for the\r\n  tort; and (2) such lost profits can be ascertained and measured from the\r\n  evidence produced with reasonable certainty. Â Petty v. Weyerhaeuser Co.,&nbsp;288\r\n  S.C. 349, 355, 342 S.E.2d 611, 615&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1986).Â  Certainty means the\r\n  damages may not be left to mere speculation or conjecture. Â Id.Â \r\n  However, the law does not require absolute certainty of lost profits but only\r\n  reasonable certainty that the damages are not purely speculative and there\r\n  exists a fairly accurate method to estimate the lost profits.Â  Id. \r\nWe\r\n  find Vortexâ€™s damages were not merely speculative.Â  The trial court admitted damages\r\n  for players who actually renegotiated their contracts after leaving Vortex.Â  The\r\n  trial court excluded testimony regarding players who may possibly renegotiate\r\n  their contracts in the future.Â  Prior to Wareâ€™s departure, no player had left\r\n  Vortex.Â  Based on these facts, it is not mere speculation to determine players\r\n  would have stayed with Vortex absent CSMGâ€™s actions.Â  Accordingly, we find the\r\n  trial court did not abuse its discretion in admitting damages consisting of Vortexâ€™s lost revenue from\r\n  renegotiated contracts.\r\nII.Â  Vortexâ€™s Appeal\r\nVortex\r\n  contends the trial court erred in setting off the verdict by the amount of its\r\n  settlement with Ware.Â  Vortex contends the settlement with Ware was based on\r\n  different causes of action than those it prevailed on against CSMG and the\r\n  injury caused by CSMG was not the same as that caused by Ware. Â Â We disagree. \r\n\r\n\tSection 15-38-50 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (2005) provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tWhen a\r\n  release or a covenant not to sue or not to enforce judgment is given in good\r\n  faith to one of two or more persons liable in tort for the same injury or the\r\n  same wrongful death:\r\n\t\t(1) it does not discharge any of\r\n  the other tortfeasors from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless\r\n  its terms so provide, but it reduces the claim against the others to the extent\r\n  of any amount stipulated by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of\r\n  the consideration paid for it, whichever is the greater; and\r\n\t\t(2) it discharges the tortfeasor\r\n  to whom it is given from all liability for contribution to any other\r\n  tortfeasor.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-50\r\n  (2005).Â  \r\nIn Ellis\r\n  v. Oliver,&nbsp;335 S.C. 106, 112, 515 S.E.2d 268, 272&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1999),\r\n  the plaintiff brought negligence causes of action against a hospital and\r\n  similar causes of action including wrongful death against a doctor.Â  The\r\n  plaintiff appealed the trial courtâ€™s set-off of her award from the doctor with\r\n  her settlement with the hospital. Â Id. Â The\r\n  plaintiff contended because the measure of damages was different for the two\r\n  causes of action, then two different injuries occurred.Â  Id. at 113, 515\r\n  S.E.2d at 272. Â This court noted the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s â€œclaims against Richland Memorial and Dr. Oliver arose out of the\r\n  same factual scenarioâ€ and found the plaintiff â€œconfuse[d] the concept of damages\r\n  with the meaning of the word injury as used in the statute.Â  Injury, as used in\r\n  the statute, is broad enough to include all damages.â€Â  Id. Â Â \r\nIn the present case, we likewise find the claims against CSMG and\r\n  Ware arose out of the same factual scenario. Â â€œSection 15-38-50 grants the court no discretion in determining the equities\r\n  involved in applying a set-off once a release has been executed in good faith\r\n  between a plaintiff and one of several joint tortfeasors.â€ Â Id. Â This\r\n  court has previously recognized â€œa strict application of the statute may lead\r\n  to unintended results; however, this is a matter for the legislature to correct\r\n  if our interpretation is contrary to its intent.â€Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find the trial court did not err in setting off Vortexâ€™s award with its\r\n  settlement from Ware.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in denying CSMGâ€™s directed\r\n  verdict motions.Â  Additionally, the trial court did not err in admitting\r\n  Professor Freemanâ€™s expert witness testimony.Â  Further, the trial court did not\r\n  err in allowing damages regarding contracts of Vortexâ€™s former clients that\r\n  were actually renegotiated.Â  Finally, the trial court did not err in setting\r\n  off Vortexâ€™s jury award with its settlement with Ware. Â According, the trial\r\n  court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and\r\nTHOMAS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The jury found for CSMG on Vortexâ€™s cause of action for civil conspiracy. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
