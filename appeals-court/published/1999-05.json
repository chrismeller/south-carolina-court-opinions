Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-35-900 et seq. (Supp. 1998).(1) Thomason \r\n  objected to the filing. Abba moved to enforce the judgment. The trial judge \r\n  denied the motion. Abba appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAbba obtained a default judgment \r\n  against Thomason in Florida for $31,015.95 with interest accruing at 12%. The \r\n  order was dated April 15, 1983, and recorded on May 6, 1983.(2) \r\n  On December 23, 1996, Abba filed the Florida judgment and supporting affidavit \r\n  with the Greenville, South Carolina, Clerk of Court. Thomason objected to the \r\n  filing, arguing he had resided in South Carolina since 1984, and the ten year \r\n  statute of limitations, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-600 (1976), therefore barred prosecution \r\n  of the action. Abba then moved to enforce the foreign judgment. In a supporting \r\n  affidavit, Abba's president asserted it did not discover that Thomason had moved \r\n  to South Carolina until May or June of 1996 and that it did not know where Thomason \r\n  was from the time it obtained its judgment until the time it discovered Thomason \r\n  resided in South Carolina. \r\n  \r\nThomason did not offer any affidavits \r\n  to support his objection to the filing of the foreign judgment. At the hearing, \r\n  however, the trial judge allowed Thomason and his nephew, Bo Barrett, to testify \r\n  as to Thomason's residency in this state. Thomason testified that he moved to \r\n  Hilton Head, South Carolina, on December 5, 1984. He stated he obtained a South \r\n  Carolina driver's license in 1984 or 1985. He also asserted his South Carolina \r\n  and federal tax returns showed his South Carolina address beginning in 1985. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRelying on Payne v. Claffy, \r\n  281 S.C. 385, 315 S.E.2d 814 (Ct. App. 1984), the trial judge held the ten year \r\n  statute of limitations of Â§ 15-3-600 applied to an action to enforce a foreign \r\n  judgment. He held the Legislature did not abrogate the application of this statute \r\n  of limitations to the enforcement of foreign judgments by enacting the Uniform \r\n  Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act. Accordingly, the ten year statute of limitations \r\n  applied to Abba's action and its motion to enforce the judgment was denied. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAbba raises three issues on appeal. \r\n  It contends the trial judge erred in (1) applying the limitations period of \r\n  Â§ 15-3-600 to the UEFJA; (2) failing to apply the discovery rule to the limitations \r\n  period of Â§ 15-3-600; and (3) allowing live testimony to be presented in opposition \r\n  of Abba's motion to enforce the foreign judgment. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1. Application of Â§ 15-3-600 to the \r\n  UEFJA \r\n  \r\nAbba argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in applying the limitations period of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-600 (1976) to the \r\n  UEFJA, which contains no limitations period. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nSection 15-3-600 is a catch-all statute \r\n  of limitations which provides, \"An action for relief not provided for in this \r\n  chapter must be commenced within ten years after the cause of action shall have \r\n  accrued.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-600 (1976). Prior to the enactment of the UEFJA, \r\n  this court held that, in an action on a foreign judgment, the statute of limitations \r\n  to be applied is ordinarily the statute of the state where the action is brought \r\n  and not that of the jurisdiction in which the judgment was obtained. Payne, \r\n  at 386-387, 315 S.E.2d at 815. We found, although no statute expressly limits \r\n  the time within which actions on foreign judgments must be brought, Â§ 15-3-600 \r\n  indirectly applies and can serve to bar prosecution of foreign judgments. Id. \r\n  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-30 (1976), this statute of limitations is \r\n  tolled while the judgment debtor resides outside of South Carolina. Thus, the \r\n  limitation period does not begin to run until the judgment debtor moves to South \r\n  Carolina and the courts of this state become empowered to adjudicate between \r\n  the parties upon the particular cause of action. Id. In Payne, \r\n  because the judgment debtor had resided in South Carolina less than ten years \r\n  and the judgment remained enforceable in Virginia, the action on the Virginia \r\n  judgment was not barred in South Carolina. \r\n  \r\nPayne unequivocally mandates \r\n  application of the ten year statute of limitations to enforcement of a foreign \r\n  judgment at common law. Abba contends, however, because Payne was decided \r\n  some nine years prior to adoption of the UEFJA, and because the Act itself contains \r\n  no limitations period, the statute of limitations pursuant to Payne has \r\n  no application under the Act. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nWe note that jurisdictions are divided \r\n  on the issue of whether a state's statute of limitations for enforcing foreign \r\n  judgment applies to proceedings under the UEFJA. See Fairbanks v. Large, \r\n  957 S.W.2d 307, 308 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997) (citing Sara L. Johnston, Annotation, \r\n  Validity, Construction, and Application of Uniform Enforcement of Foreign \r\n  Judgments Act, 31 A.L.R.4th 706 (1984 &amp; Supp. 1997)). We are persuaded \r\n  by cases from jurisdictions which apply their statute of limitations for enforcement \r\n  of foreign judgments under the UEFJA to domesticate a foreign judgment. \r\n  \r\nIn Fairbanks, the Kentucky \r\n  Court of Appeals addressed the issue of whether the statute of limitations which \r\n  applied in the enforcement of foreign judgment actions brought under common \r\n  law also applied to enforcement brought under the subsequently adopted UEFJA. \r\n  The court found no logical distinction between the two enforcement proceedings \r\n  and held an action by a judgment creditor under the UEFJA was subject to Kentucky's \r\n  statute of limitations on foreign judgments. In Lawrence Systems, Inc. v. \r\n  Superior Feeders, Inc., 880 S.W.2d 203 (Tex. Ct. App. 1994), the Texas Court \r\n  of Appeals held its statute of limitations for enforcing foreign judgments applied \r\n  equally to proceedings under its UEFJA as it did to common law actions for the \r\n  enforcement of foreign judgments. The court found, \"[f]or limitation purposes, \r\n  there is no logical difference between the two enforcement proceedings.\" Id. \r\n  at 208. \r\n \r\n The purpose of the UEFJA is to provide \r\n  a simpler, more expedient procedure to enforce foreign judgments; it is not \r\n  to endow foreign creditors with substantive rights not otherwise available in \r\n  the forum state. Fairbanks, supra, at 309. There is nothing in the UEFJA \r\n  to suggest it is designed to circumvent the established statute of limitations \r\n  for enforcing foreign judgments. Id. While the procedure may be easier \r\n  and less costly to pursue than that of a common law action, it is nevertheless \r\n  an enforcement procedure, the goal of which is identical to a suit to enforce \r\n  judgment. Id. Thus, there is no logical basis for imposing two different \r\n  periods of limitation. Id. at 309-310. \r\n  \r\nOur Legislature enacted the UEFJA \r\n  in 1993, but did not provide a limitations period for filing foreign judgments \r\n  pursuant to the act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-900 et seq. (Supp. 1998). \r\n  The Legislature, however, is presumed to enact legislation with reference to \r\n  existing law, and there is a strong presumption it does not intend, by statute, \r\n  to change common law rules. Hoogenboom v. City of Beaufort, 315 S.C. \r\n  306, 318 n. 5, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 n. 5 (Ct. App. 1993). Further, a statute \r\n  is not to be construed as in derogation of common law rights if another interpretation \r\n  is reasonable. Id. See also O'Laughlin v. Windham, 330 S.C. 379, \r\n  498 S.E.2d 689 (Ct. App. 1998) (strong presumption exists that General Assembly \r\n  does not intend to supplant common law principles when enacting legislation). \r\n  We therefore conclude enactment of the UEFJA did not abrogate the common law \r\n  rule of Payne that the ten year statute of limitations under Â§ 15-3-600 \r\n  applies to actions to enforce foreign judgments. \r\n  \r\nWe find that, absent some specific \r\n  limitations period for enforcement under the UEFJA, the catch-all limitation \r\n  period of Â§ 15-3-600 applies to the time in which a foreign judgment must be \r\n  filed pursuant to the UEFJA, just as it does to an action to enforce a foreign \r\n  judgment under common law. As the Kentucky Court of Appeals explained, \"[W]e \r\n  believe it would be anomalous for the Legislature to endow foreign judgment \r\n  creditors with a greater period to collect from debtors in [this state] than \r\n  creditors with domestic judgments.\" Fairbanks v. Large, 957 S.W.2d 307, \r\n  310 (Ky. Ct. App. 1997).(3) \r\n  \r\n2. Discovery Rule \r\n  \r\nAbba argues the trial judge erred \r\n  when he refused to apply the discovery rule to the limitations period set forth \r\n  in Â§ 15-3-600. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe legislature has imposed the discovery \r\n  rule on several causes of action. See Â§Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 1998) (extending \r\n  discovery rule to action governed by 15-3-530(5), actions for any injury to \r\n  the person or rights of another, not arising on contract); 15-3-530(7) (Supp. \r\n  1998) (fraud); 15-3-530 (9) (Supp. 1998) (action against directors and stockholders \r\n  of banks; 15-3-545 (Supp. 1998) (medical malpractice action). The rule has been \r\n  judicially applied to other causes of action. See Dean v. Ruscon Corp., \r\n  321 S.C. 360, 468 S.E.2d 645 (1996) (holding discovery rule is applicable to \r\n  action for trespass or damage to real property); Santee Portland Cement Co. \r\n  v. Daniel Int'l Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 384 S.E.2d 693 (1989), overruled on \r\n  other grounds by Atlas Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Nat'l Vendors \r\n  Division of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995) (holding \r\n  the discovery rule applies to breach of contract actions); Mills v. Killian, \r\n  273 S.C. 66, 254 S.E.2d 556 (1979) (holding the discovery rule applies to professional \r\n  negligence causes of action). While the court in Santee, supra, judicially \r\n  applied the discovery rule to contract actions, it did not adopt the rule for \r\n  all causes of action. Mathews v. City of Greenwood, 305 S.C. 267, 269 \r\n  n.1, 407 S.E.2d 668, 669 n.1 (Ct. App. 1991). See also Jones v. City of Folly \r\n  Beach, 326 S.C. 360, 483 S.E.2d 770 (Ct. App. 1997) (wherein this court \r\n  refused to extend discovery rule to actions for libel and slander). \r\n \r\nAbba argues that pursuant to Mills, \r\n  supra, the discovery rule applies to actions subjected to the Â§ 15-3-600 \r\n  statute of limitations. We disagree. In Mills, the supreme court held \r\n  the discovery rule applied in a cross-claim for professional negligence to prevent \r\n  the action from being barred by either the six year statute of limitations of \r\n  the former Â§ 15-3-530 or the ten year statute of limitations of section 15-3-600. \r\n  We find the supreme court's application of the discovery rule in Mills \r\n  is limited to actions for professional negligence and does not automatically \r\n  extend to every action falling within the catch-all limitations period of Â§ \r\n  15-3-600. Accordingly, we must decide the novel issue of whether the discovery \r\n  rule applies in actions pursuant to the UEFJA. \r\n  \r\nUnder the discovery rule, the statutory \r\n  period of limitations begins to run when a person could or should have known, \r\n  through the exercise of reasonable diligence, that a cause of action might exist \r\n  in his or her favor, rather than when a person obtains actual knowledge of either \r\n  the potential claim or of the facts giving rise thereto. Burgess v. American \r\n  Cancer Society, 300 S.C. 182, 386 S.E.2d 798 (Ct. App. 1989). The rule requires \r\n  an injured party to act promptly when the facts and circumstances of the injury \r\n  would place a reasonable person on notice that a claim against another party \r\n  might exist. Dean, supra at 363-364, 468 S.E.2d 647. The discovery rule \r\n  has evolved as a means of mitigating harsh and unjust results from a rigid application \r\n  of the statute of limitations where an injury or cause is not immediately evident \r\n  to the plaintiff. The rule protects plaintiffs' interests in prosecuting actions \r\n  and pursuing their rights where circumstances prevent them from knowing they \r\n  have been harmed. Santee, supra at 271, 384 S.E.2d at 694. In some situations, \r\n  \". . . the accrual upon discovery rule represents the more equitable and rational \r\n  view.\" Id. at 272, 384 S.E.2d 695. \r\n  \r\nWe agree with the trial judge that \r\n  the concerns necessitating the application of the discovery rule in other actions \r\n  are absent from an action to enforce a foreign judgment. A judgment creditor \r\n  is on notice that it has a claim against the judgment debtor once the foreign \r\n  judgment is final. Such circumstances do not prevent the judgment creditor from \r\n  knowing he has been harmed, and there are no harsh or unjust results militating \r\n  against rigid application of the statute of limitations. Accordingly, we find \r\n  the trial judge did not err in refusing to apply the discovery rule. We hold \r\n  the ten year limitations period of Â§ 15-3-600, for enforcement of Abba's foreign \r\n  judgment under the UEFJA, began to run when Thomason became a resident of South \r\n  Carolina, not when Abba discovered Thomason was a South Carolina resident. \r\n  \r\n3. Live Testimony \r\n  \r\nAbba argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in allowing Thomason, with no prior notice to Abba, to provide live testimony \r\n  to oppose Abba's motion to enforce the Florida judgment in violation of Rule \r\n  6(d), SCRCP. We find no reversible error. \r\n  \r\nThe UEFJA provides the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure apply to a hearing on a foreign judgment creditor's \r\n  motion for enforcement under the Act. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940(B) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  Rule 6(d), SCRCP, provides that when a motion is supported by affidavit, \"additional \r\n  or opposing affidavits may be served not later than two days before the hearing, \r\n  unless the court permits them to be served at some other time.\" \r\n  \r\nThe record on appeal does not provide \r\n  the basis for Abba's objections to Thomason's live testimony or any argument \r\n  as to how it was prejudiced by the admission of the testimony. Rather, it contains \r\n  only Abba's assertions that allowing Thomason to supplement the record with \r\n  witnesses was improper and Thomason should not be allowed to call an additional \r\n  witness, Bo Barrett. The record is completely devoid of any argument by Abba \r\n  that the live testimony did not comply with Rule 6(d), SCRCP. \r\n  \r\nAn appellant must make a specific \r\n  objection to the admission of evidence to preserve the issue for appeal. McKissick \r\n  v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  The same ground argued on appeal must have been argued to the trial judge. Id. \r\n  An appellate court may not address an issue that is not preserved. Hendrix \r\n  v. Eastern Distribution, Inc., 320 S.C. 218, 464 S.E.2d 112 (1995). Additionally, \r\n  as the appellant, Abba bears the burden of providing an adequate record for \r\n  this court to conduct a proper review. D &amp; D Leasing Co. of South Carolina, \r\n  Inc. v. Gentry, 298 S.C. 342, 380 S.E.2d 823 (1989); Windham v. Honeycutt, \r\n  290 S.C. 60, 348 S.E.2d 185 (Ct. App. 1986). Because this issue has not been \r\n  properly preserved, we cannot address it on appeal. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order \r\n  below is \r\n \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nSTILWELL, J., concurring. HEARN, \r\nJ., dissenting in a separate opinion\r\n \r\n HEARN, J.: Respectfully, \r\n  I dissent. While I recognize the holding of Payne v. Claffy, 281 S.C. \r\n  385, 315 S.E.2d 814 (Ct. App. 1984), that the general statute of limitations \r\n  contained in S.C. Code section 15-3-600 indirectly applies to an action on a \r\n  foreign judgment, I would hold it does not apply to a proceeding under the Uniform \r\n  Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act (UEFJA). \r\n  \r\nThe UEFJA establishes a summary procedure \r\n  for enrolling a foreign judgment in this state. The registration procedure under \r\n  the Act is not an action like the common-law proceeding to enforce a foreign \r\n  judgment in Payne.(1d) See Hunter \r\n  Technology, Inc. v. Scott, 701 P.2d 645, 646 (Colo. Ct. App. 1985) (\"'The \r\n  [Uniform] Act does not involve the institution of an action to enforce the judgment; \r\n  it requires, to give the foreign judgment immediate legally enforceable consequences, \r\n  only that it be filed in accordance with its provisions.'\" (quoting Producers \r\n  Grain Corp. v. Carroll, 546 P.2d 285, 287 (Okla. Ct. App. 1976))); Wright \r\n  v. Trust Co. Bank, 466 S.E.2d 74, 75 (Ga. Ct. App. 1995) (\"The uniform law \r\n  provides a summary procedure for endowing a filed foreign judgment with the \r\n  same effect as a judgment of the court in which it is filed. It is not a new \r\n  action . . . .\"(citation omitted)); Hill v. Value Recovery Group, L.P., \r\n  964 P.2d 1256, 1259 (Wyo. 1998) (\"Filing a foreign judgment under the [UEFJA] \r\n  does not involve a court proceeding and, therefore, is not a civil action . \r\n  . . .\"). \r\n  \r\nThe majority relies on two recent \r\n  opinions from other jurisdictions. Both Texas and Kentucky have applied their \r\n  enforcement of foreign judgment statutes of limitations to registering foreign \r\n  judgments in those states. In the Texas case, the language of the statute of \r\n  limitations on which the Texas Court of Appeals relies is very different from \r\n  that governing our decisions. Texas has had a statute for over seventy-five \r\n  years that specifically limits actions on foreign judgments against domestic \r\n  debtors to ten years. See Lawrence Sys., Inc. v. Superior Feeders, \r\n  Inc., 880 S.W.2d 203, 206 (Tex. App. 1994). This Texas statute applies to \r\n  any \"action.\" Tex. Civ. Prac. Code Ann. Â§16.066(b) (West 1986). The Texas court \r\n  noted that the UEFJA required filing of the foreign judgment and giving notice \r\n  to the debtor. Because filing and notice are essential elements in an \"action\" \r\n  for enforcement, the court found its statute of limitations broad enough to \r\n  apply to \"actions\" under the UEFJA. Lawrence Systems, 880 S.W.2d at 208. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBy contrast, our statute of limitations \r\n  at issue, Code section 15-3-600, applies only to a \"cause of action.\" In my \r\n  view, this specifically limits its applicability to causes of action, a term \r\n  that contemplates a proceeding between adverse parties, not a unilateral act \r\n  such as registration under the UEFJA. \r\n  \r\nAdmittedly, some jurisdictions have \r\n  made facially appealing arguments to the effect that where the end result is \r\n  the same, the means should be treated the same. See Fairbanks v. Large, \r\n  957 S.W.2d 307, 309 (Ky Ct. App. 1997) (\"While the [UEFJA] procedure may be \r\n  easier and less costly to pursue, it is nevertheless an enforcement procedure, \r\n  the goal of which is identical to a suit to enforce a judgment.\"). However, \r\n  I do not find these rationales persuasive because the legal landscape of enforcing \r\n  foreign judgments has changed with the passage of the UEFJA. \r\n  \r\nUnder the protections of full faith \r\n  and credit, foreign judgments that are valid, final, unsatisfied, and uncontested \r\n  may be registered under our UEFJA. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-920(A) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  Once the judgment is registered properly, it must be docketed and indexed like \r\n  a South Carolina judgment. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-920(B) (Supp. 1998). After \r\n  the foreign judgment has become a South Carolina judgment under the UEFJA, the \r\n  judgment debtor may then challenge the now South Carolina judgment on \"any . \r\n  . . ground for which relief from a judgment of this state is allowed.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-35-940 (Supp. 1998). Although at that point a statute limiting \r\n  the enforcement period may be implicated, a general statute of limitations should \r\n  not be applied. \r\n  \r\nHowever, those defenses affecting \r\n  South Carolina's ability to afford a foreign judgment full faith and credit \r\n  through registration would still be allowed. For example, lack of personal jurisdiction \r\n  to the original judgment is a defense to proper registration of a foreign judgment \r\n  in South Carolina. See PYA/Monarch, Inc. v. Sowell's Meats &amp; Servs., \r\n  Inc., 327 S.C. 469, 478, 486 S.E.2d 766, 771 (Ct. App. 1997) (reversing \r\n  the trial court's accord of full faith and credit to a North Carolina judgment \r\n  because the judgment debtor had insufficient minimum contacts with North Carolina \r\n  to support the judgment; because the initial judgment was void, there was no \r\n  judgment to register in South Carolina). \r\n  \r\nMoreover, a judgment registered under \r\n  the UEFJA would also be subject to South Carolina Code section 15-39-30. See \r\n  Commercial Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, Op. No. 2929, Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 4, at 21 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 18, 1999). Riddle addressed \r\n  the time for enforcement of a foreign judgment domesticated by a common-law \r\n  action and held that Code section 15-39-30 does not begin to run until that \r\n  foreign judgment is domesticated. See Id. at 24 (\"[T]he Illinois \r\n  judgment was transmuted into a South Carolina judgment when it was domesticated \r\n  . . . . [T]he ten year period for enforcement of the judgment, began on that \r\n  date.\"). Likewise, the ten year enforcement period would not start to run until \r\n  a foreign judgment is properly registered under the UEFJA. \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, the result in Commercial \r\n  Credit harmonizes with the full faith and credit protections evoked by this \r\n  case. South Carolina limitations periods should not apply to a foreign judgment \r\n  until that foreign judgment becomes a valid South Carolina judgment. Therefore, \r\n  if a foreign judgment is valid and enforceable in that foreign jurisdiction, \r\n  South Carolina should give that judgment full faith and credit under the UEFJA, \r\n  which was designed to facilitate such acceptance. \r\n  \r\nThe majority invokes the principle \r\n  that the General Assembly is presumed to enact legislation with reference to \r\n  existing law and that, therefore, the enactment of the UEFJA did not abrogate \r\n  the common-law rule in Payne. A more compelling rule of statutory construction \r\n  in this instance is the principle that legislation enacted for a specific purpose \r\n  like the UEFJA supplants the general law that previously applied in the area, \r\n  particularly a general statute of limitations which was held to apply only \"indirectly\" \r\n  to actions brought under prior law. See Witzig v. Witzig, 325 \r\n  S.C. 363, 366, 479 S.E.2d 297, 299 (Ct. App. 1996) (\"It is a well settled principle \r\n  of statutory construction that 'specific laws prevail over general laws, and \r\n  later legislation takes precedence over earlier legislation.'\" (quoting Langley \r\n  v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 403, 438 S.E.2d 242, 243 (1993))); cf. Byrd \r\n  v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 435, 468 S.E.2d 861, 866 (1996) (\"The \r\n  enactment of later statutory provisions delineating a specific disciplinary \r\n  process evinces an intent by the Legislature that students use such procedures \r\n  and not the earlier-enacted, more general appeals procedure.\"). \r\n  \r\nI recognize the majority's concern \r\n  that it seems anomalous for the legislature to endow foreign judgment creditors \r\n  with a potentially greater period to enforce their judgments in South Carolina \r\n  than that afforded domestic creditors. I would note, though, that the actual \r\n  enforcement period would be the same once the foreign judgments were registered \r\n  in this state. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-39-30. The real distinction is \r\n  the potentially greater period that foreign judgment creditors would have to \r\n  register their judgments in South Carolina under the UEFJA rather than under \r\n  the common-law procedure. In my view, our state's law should keep pace with \r\n  developing policy considerations such as those behind the UEFJA. As reflected \r\n  in the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the Constitution, courts of one state \r\n  must give such force and effect to a judgment of a sister state as that judgment \r\n  would have in the sister state. See NationsBank of N.C. v. Parson, \r\n  324 S.C. 506, 512, 477 S.E.2d 735, 738 (Ct. App. 1996). The validity and effect \r\n  of a foreign judgment must be determined by the laws of the state that rendered \r\n  the judgment, not by the laws of this state. Id.; PYA/Monarch, Inc. \r\n  v. Sowell's Meats &amp; Servs., Inc., 327 S.C. 469, 478, 486 S.E.2d 766, \r\n  771 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse. \r\n1.  Abba has assigned \r\n  its interest in the Florida judgment to Eugenia T. Barrett, Thomason's sister. \r\n  \r\n2.  Under Florida \r\n  law, the judgment remains valid and enforceable for 20 years from the date of \r\n  entry. \r\n3.  See Commercial \r\n  Credit Loans, Inc. v. Riddle, Op. No. 2929 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Jan. 18, 1999) \r\n  (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 4 at 21) (an original South Carolina judgment is extinguished \r\n  ten years from the date of entry). \r\n1d.  We use the \r\n  term \"registered\" to denote those foreign judgments which are filed in accordance \r\n  with the UEFJA. The term \"domesticated\" refers to the common-law procedure of \r\n  bringing an action upon the foreign judgment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2984","title":"Richland County School District Two, et al. v.

SCDE argues the District's freeze violates the \r\n  Education Improvement Act (EIA). We affirm. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The South Carolina Education Finance \r\n  Act of 1977 (EFA) provides a statewide minimum salary schedule for certified \r\n  employees. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 59-20-10 et seq. (1990 &amp; Supp. \r\n  1998). The EFA requires each school district to \"pay each certified teacher \r\n  or administrator an annual salary at least equal to the salary stated in the \r\n  statewide minimum salary schedule for the person's experience and class.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-50(4)(a) (Supp. 1998). No teacher \"employed in the same position, \r\n  over the same time period, shall receive less total salary, including any normal \r\n  incremental increase, than that [teacher] received for the fiscal year before \r\n  the implementation of this article.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-50(4)(a) (Supp. \r\n  1998). \r\n  \r\n The South Carolina Education Improvement \r\n  Act (EIA) amended EFA \"to raise salaries in order to attract and retain qualified \r\n  teachers.\" Jackson v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 316 S.C. 177, 180, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 859, 861 (1994) (citing Act No. 512, 984 S.C. Acts 2997). Teacher's \r\n  salaries now contain a combination of EFA funds, EIA funds, and optional local \r\n  salary supplements. Jackson, 316 S.C. at 180, 447 S.E.2d at 861. In conjunction \r\n  with EIA's purpose, the statute presently reads: \"[u]nder this schedule, school \r\n  districts are required to maintain local salary supplements per teacher no less \r\n  than their prior fiscal level.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-50(4)(b) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  This provision prohibits districts \"from supplanting any local salary supplements \r\n  with EIA funds.\" Jackson, 316 S.C. at 180, 447 S.E.2d at 861. \r\n  \r\n When the District analyzed whether \r\n  their local salary supplement freeze complied with State law, the statute actually \r\n  stated: \"[u]nder this schedule, school districts are required to maintain local \r\n  salary supplements per teacher no less than their 1983-84 level.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 59-20-50(4)(b) (1990). The 1991 State Appropriations Act supplemented \r\n  the statutory language with a legislative proviso reading: \"School districts \r\n  are required to maintain local salary supplements per teacher, no less than \r\n  their prior fiscal year level.\" Act No. 171, 1991 S.C. Acts Sections 28.39.(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n The State's minimum salary schedule \r\n  sets salaries through seventeen years of experience. The District supplied a \r\n  local salary schedule exceeding the State's minimum salary schedule for years \r\n  of experience and salary amounts. We refer to the various experience levels \r\n  on either schedule as 'steps.' SCDE designates the position where the vertical \r\n  columns (education) and horizontal rows (experience) intersect a 'cell.' \r\n  \r\n The District's schedule increases \r\n  local salary supplements each year for the first twenty-one years of employment \r\n  and at five year intervals after the first twenty-one years. In the 1991-92 \r\n  fiscal year, the District encountered financial hardship because the State provided \r\n  no additional funds for salary increases and the county council provided $756,906 \r\n  less than requested. Consequently, the District froze local salary supplement \r\n  payments for two categories of certified teachers and administrators (collectively \r\n  teachers): (a) teachers with more than seventeen years of experience, i.e., \r\n  those beyond the State salary schedule and (b) teachers employed under extended-year \r\n  contracts who already receive additional compensation because of the added length \r\n  of their yearly contracts. \r\n  \r\n A District basketball coach, Bobby \r\n  Cunningham, complained to SCDE about the freeze. SCDE conducted an informal \r\n  review and contacted the District regarding a potential liability. The District \r\n  maintained the freeze complied with State law. SCDE conducted a formal audit \r\n  for the 1993-94 year to determine whether the District maintained their local \r\n  salary supplements. SCDE found the District failed to pay 139 instructional \r\n  employees in accordance with the District's salary schedule for a cumulative \r\n  underpayment of $67,096. SCDE also charged the District with violating the legislative \r\n  provision in the State Appropriations Act by failing to maintain their local \r\n  salary supplements per teacher at a level no less than their prior fiscal year. \r\n  See Act No. 171, 1991 S.C. Acts Section 28.39; Act. No. 501, 1992 S.C. \r\n  Acts Section 28.60. SCDE informed the District by letter that if the District \r\n  failed to bring itself into compliance with State law, SCDE would conduct a \r\n  formal audit and, if necessary, initiate the cessation of the District's EFA \r\n  funding. \r\n  \r\n SCDE concedes the State offset the \r\n  District's increased EFA funds by reducing the amount of EIA funds provided. \r\n  The parties stipulate that the District maintained local salary supplements \r\n  for teachers in 1991-92 at levels no less than the local salary supplement paid \r\n  in the previous fiscal year. \r\n  \r\n The District filed a declaratory \r\n  judgment action seeking a declaration of their rights under EFA section 59-20-50(4) \r\n  and the proviso in the State Appropriations Act for the Fiscal Year 1991. The \r\n  circuit court declared the District acted in compliance with the law and refused \r\n  to accept SCDE's argument to interpret the statutory language 'per teacher' \r\n  as 'per cell.' SCDE appeals.(2) We affirm. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n SCDE asserts both the Appropriations \r\n  Act proviso and the statutory language stating \"school districts are required \r\n  to maintain local salary supplements per teacher, no less than their prior fiscal \r\n  level\" require a 'per cell' analysis rather than a 'per teacher' analysis. SCDE \r\n  maintains the \"local salary supplement correspond[s] to the 'cell' or experience/education \r\n  level of the individual teacher, not the dollar amount the teacher is paid in \r\n  local salary supplements.\" SCDE therefore argues the District must pay teachers \r\n  during the 1991-92 year the same local salary supplement paid teachers with \r\n  the same years of experience during the 1990-91 year. The District claims per \r\n  teacher means 'each teacher' and argues both the Appropriations Act proviso \r\n  and the plain meaning of the statutory language requires a 'per teacher' analysis \r\n  which prohibits each teacher from receiving a local salary supplement less than \r\n  the local salary supplement that teacher received the prior fiscal year. \r\n  \r\n The plain meaning of the legislative \r\n  language, whether the Appropriations Act proviso or statutory provision, compels \r\n  interpreting 'per teacher' as 'each teacher' in the ordinary meaning ascribed \r\n  such terms. The District acted properly in freezing local salary supplements \r\n  where each teacher received a local salary supplement at least equal to the \r\n  supplement that teacher received in the prior fiscal year. \r\n  \r\n \"The primary rule of statutory construction \r\n  requires that legislative intent prevail if it can reasonably be discovered \r\n  in language used construed in light of intended purpose.\" Stephen v. Avins \r\n  Construction Co., 324 S.C. 334, 338, 478 S.E.2d 74, 76 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  \"The legislature's intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language \r\n  of the statute.\" Stephen, 324 S.C. at 339, 478 at 77. \"If a statute's \r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, \r\n  there is no need to employ rules of statutory interpretation, and the court \r\n  has no right to look for or impose another meaning.\" South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Revenue and Taxation v. Rosemary Coin Machines, Inc., 331 S.C. 234, 245, \r\n  500 S.E.2d 176, 182 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, \r\n  317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995)). \"[W]ords used in a statute must be given \r\n  their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction \r\n  to limit or expand the operation of the statute.\" Greenville Hospital System \r\n  v. Provident Life &amp; Accident Ins. Co., 330 S.C. 436, 442, 499 \r\n  S.E.2d 232, 235 (Ct. App. 1998) (citing Koenig v. South Carolina Dept. of \r\n  Public Safety, 325 S.C. 400, 403-04, 480 S.E.2d 98, 99 (Ct. App. 1996)). \r\n  \"The statute as a whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation \r\n  consonant with the purpose, design and policy of lawmakers.\" Rosenbaum v. \r\n  S-M-S 32, 311 S.C. 140, 143, 427 S.E.2d 897, 898 (1993). \r\n  \r\n The State Appropriations Act in \r\n  question stated: \"School districts are required to maintain local salary supplements \r\n  per teacher, no less than their prior fiscal year level.\" Act No. 171, 1991 \r\n  S.C. Acts Section 28.39. We conclude the plain meaning of this language precludes \r\n  the District from decreasing a particular teacher's local salary supplement \r\n  from the amount received in the prior fiscal year but permits freezing that \r\n  teacher's local salary supplement amount. To read 'per teacher' as 'per cell' \r\n  effectually removes the phrase 'per teacher' from the statute and renders that \r\n  language unnecessary. The plain language provides no indication 'per teacher' \r\n  means the District must pay teachers with ten years of experience during the \r\n  1991-92 year the same local salary supplement teachers with ten years of experience \r\n  received during the 1990-91 year and we decline to extend or contort the language \r\n  to create this 'per cell' meaning. \r\n  \r\n The policy for the EIA and EFA substantiates \r\n  our conclusion. The EIA amended the EFA to raise South Carolina's teachers' \r\n  salaries to the southeastern average. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-50(4)(b) (1990 \r\n  as amended in Supp. 1997) (\"In projecting the southeastern average, the division \r\n  shall include in the South Carolina base teacher salary all local teacher supplements \r\n  and all incentive pay.\"). To ensure teacher's salaries actually increased with \r\n  additional funds from the State, the EIA included the language at issue to prohibit \r\n  school districts from using EIA funds to supplant local supplements. Jackson, \r\n  316 S.C. at 180, 447 S.E.2d at 861 (the legislative language prohibits a school \r\n  district from supplanting any local salary supplements with EIA funds). A former \r\n  SCDE official testified that a per teacher analysis rather than a per cell analysis \r\n  furthers the EIA's statutory purpose of raising salaries to the southeastern \r\n  average by preventing school districts from supplanting local funds with EIA \r\n  funds. The official testified the per cell analysis poses problems because it \r\n  shifts the financial burden of maintaining salaries at the southeastern average \r\n  from the State to the local district taxpayer because for each dollar increase \r\n  in local salary supplement, the State subtracts an equal dollar amount in EIA \r\n  funding. Prohibiting the District from decreasing a particular teacher's local \r\n  supplement amount from the prior fiscal year ensures the District will not supplant \r\n  local supplements with EIA funds and ensures no burden is unfairly shifted to \r\n  the State's effort to maintain teacher's salaries at the southeastern average. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n An SCDE auditor testified that applying \r\n  a per teacher analysis permits phasing out local salary supplements forcing \r\n  the EIA to contribute a larger amount which could wipe out the EIA and unduly \r\n  burden the State. We find SCDE's argument disingenuous. A teacher's salary is \r\n  now computed by adding (a) the EFA base salary amount, (b) the local salary \r\n  supplements, and (c) then using the EIA funds as a plug to ensure the total \r\n  teacher's salary equates with the southeastern average. Thus, for every dollar \r\n  a school district increases their local salary supplement, the EIA funds provided \r\n  by the State decrease by an equal dollar amount. When considering nothing requires \r\n  school districts to pay local salary supplements, SCDE's argument that the District \r\n  is shifting the burden on the State to maintain teacher's salaries at the southeastern \r\n  average is actually an attempt by SCDE to shift the burden to school districts \r\n  who choose to offer local supplements in an effort to attract the highest caliber \r\n  teachers. \r\n  \r\n Despite the deference normally afforded \r\n  an administrative agency's statutory construction, the plain meaning of the \r\n  proviso's language provides a compelling reason to reject SCDE's interpretation \r\n  of 'per teacher' as 'per cell.' Dunton v. South Carolina Bd. of Examiners \r\n  in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 223, 353 S.E.2d 132, 133 (1987) (\"[t]he construction \r\n  of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded \r\n  the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling \r\n  reasons\"); Lloyd v. South Carolina Dep't of Health and Environmental Control, \r\n  328 S.C. 419, 428-29, 491 S.E.2d 592, 597 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. granted, \r\n  (May 15, 1998), case remanded for settlement (July 17, 1998). (\"It is well established \r\n  that \"construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration \r\n  will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled \r\n  absent compelling reasons. Even so, an administrative construction 'affords \r\n  no basis for the perpetuation of a patently erroneous application of the statute.' \r\n  In this regard, '[w]here the terms of the statute are clear, the court must \r\n  apply those terms according to their literal meaning.' An appellate court cannot \r\n  construe a statute without regard to its plain meaning and may not resort to \r\n  a forced interpretation in an attempt to expand or limit the scope of a statute.\") \r\n  (citations/omitted).. \r\n \r\n Finally, our ruling does not open \r\n  a Pandora's box permitting school districts to eliminate local supplements for \r\n  at least two reasons. First, the plain language of the statute specifically \r\n  prohibits school districts from reducing a particular teacher's supplement from \r\n  the previous year. Second, school districts still possess an incentive to provide \r\n  local supplements to attract the highest caliber teachers. \r\n  \r\n Pursuant to the above analysis, \r\n  we hold the plain meaning of the legislative language in question permitted \r\n  the District's freeze on local salary supplements.(3) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n HEARN and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  From 1986 \r\n  until the legislature amended section 59-20-50(4)(b), each State Appropriations \r\n  Act included a similar legislative proviso. See Act. No. 540, 1986 S.C. \r\n  Acts 4402; Act No. 170, 1987 S.C. Acts Section 30.4; Act No. 658, 1988 S.C. \r\n  Acts Section 30.41; Act No. 189, 1989 S.C. Acts Section 28.39; Act. No. 612, \r\n  1990 S.C. Acts Section 28.39; Act No. 171, 1991 S.C. Acts Section 28.39; Act. \r\n  No. 501, 1992 S.C. Acts Section 28.60; Act No. 164, 1993 S.C. Acts Section 20.54; \r\n  Jackson, 316 S.C. at 180, 447 S.E.2d at 859. \r\n2.  SCDE failed \r\n  to address and does not contest the circuit court's ruling that the Proviso \r\n  does not apply to teachers with more than seventeen years of experience because \r\n  the State minimum salary schedule stops after the seventeenth year. The issue \r\n  is therefore not preserved. Rule 207, SCACR (\"Ordinarily, no point will be considered \r\n  which is not set forth in the statement of the issues on appeal.\"). \r\n3.  We express \r\n  no opinion on the validity of the District's salary schedule. We only address \r\n  whether the District may freeze local salary supplements under the legislative \r\n  proviso to the State Appropriations Act. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2985","title":"Cullum Mechanical Construction Co., Inc. v.

(Architect), Miller-Sharpe, Inc. (General Contractor), John \r\n  M. Miller, Donald R. Sharpe, and General Accident Insurance Company of America \r\n  (Surety), seeking $426,728.87 for unpaid goods and services on a project to \r\n  upfit areas of the Baptist Medical Center.(1) \r\n  The trial court granted Architect's summary judgment motion, finding it owed \r\n  no legal or contractual duty to Cullum, a subcontractor. After a bench trial, \r\n  the trial court ruled in favor of Surety, finding Cullum was not a third-party \r\nbeneficiary under the bid bond. Cullum appeals both orders. We affirm.\r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nIn the fall of 1992, Owner retained \r\n  Architect to upfit the 8th and 9th floors of Baptist Hospital. Architect prepared \r\n  a Project Manual dated April 11, 1993, to be used by potential contractors in \r\n  submitting bids. General Contractor was among those contractors invited to bid \r\n  on the project. On May 4, 1993, General Contractor submitted its bid of $3,540,700.00. \r\n  After some initial changes, Owner executed a contract on June 10, 1993, with \r\n  General Contractor for $3,260,430.00. The Notice to Proceed date was June 11, \r\n  1993. \r\n  \r\nAs portions of the work were completed, \r\n  Architect certified payments to General Contractor: (1) $77,670.00 on June 28, \r\n  1993; (2) $114,967.80 on July 26, 1993; (3)$463,784.40 on August 30, 1993; (4) \r\n  $476,515.80 on October 4, 1993; (5) $384,043.50 on November 3, 1993; and (6) \r\n  $449,082.00 on December 3, 1993. \r\n  \r\nDespite receiving these monies, totaling \r\n  $1,966,063.50, General Contractor did not pay its subcontractors. On October \r\n  11, 1993, Cullum wrote General Contractor, stating: \"[A]s of September, we had \r\n  billed you $442,065.60 and haven't received any payments. Please get our July \r\n  and August payments to us immediately.\" It was not until November 10, 1993, \r\n  however, that Cullum executed its contract with General Contractor. The contract's \r\n  cover letter also acknowledged payment problems: \"We billed $225,499.50 on August \r\n  19, 1993, and received this payment on November 9, 1993. This is not promptly \r\n  or timely as indicated by the contract. We have also billed $127,712.70 on September \r\n  20, 1993, and payment is due but not received.\" \r\n  \r\nOther subcontractors began to complain \r\n  about nonpayment. In response to Owner's inquiry, Architect requested a copy \r\n  of General Contractor's payment bond on November 12, 1993. On December 7, 1993, \r\n  General Contractor submitted a \"General Agreement of Indemnity\" issued by Chubb \r\n  Group of Insurance Companies dated August 24, 1993. Despite not receiving a \r\n  payment bond from General Contractor, Architect apparently approved reducing \r\n  the retainage from ten to five percent in December 1993. Moreover, Architect \r\n  certified additional payments totaling $1,284,893.95: (1) $635,911.45 on December \r\n  23, 1993; (2) $503,063.85 on January 31, 1994; (3) $94,819.95 on March 2, 1994; \r\n  and (4) $51,098.70 on April 14, 1994.(2) \r\n  \r\nFinally, on May 13, 1994, General \r\n  Contractor admitted there was no payment bond on the project and that the monies \r\n  it received from Owner had been used to pay unrelated legal bills. Cullum and \r\n  other subcontractors sued Owner, General Contractor, Surety, and two principals \r\n  of General Contractor; Cullum also sued Architect. Uncollectible default judgments \r\n  were obtained against General Contractor. Cullum's claims against Owner were \r\n  settled.(3) The trial judge granted Architect's \r\n  motion for summary judgment. Cullum appeals this order. After a trial concerning \r\n  Surety's liability, the trial judge found for Surety. Cullum, on behalf of all \r\n  plaintiffs, appeals this order. \r\n  \r\nAPPEAL AS TO \r\n  ARCHITECT \r\n  \r\nCullum first argues the trial court \r\n  erred by granting Architect's summary judgment motion. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\"Summary judgment is proper where \r\n  there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.\" Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. \r\n  318, 325, 487 S.E.2d 187, 191 (1997); see Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Summary \r\n  judgment should be granted when it is clear that \"further inquiry into the facts \r\n  is not desirable to clarify application of the law.\" Hyder v. Jones, \r\n  271 S.C. 85, 87, 245 S.E.2d 123, 124-25 (1978); Parker v. Williams &amp; \r\n  Madjanik, Inc., 269 S.C. 662, 664, 239 S.E.2d 487, 488 (1977). \r\n  \r\nCullum acknowledges it had no contract \r\n  with Architect.(4) However, relying on Tommy \r\n  L. Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating Co. v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc., \r\n  320 S.C. 49, 463 S.E.2d 85 (1995), Cullum contends Architect owed it a professional \r\n  duty distinct from any contractual duty. Cullum maintains the project manual, \r\n  the contracts between Owner and Architect, and the contract between Owner and \r\n  General Contractor create a genuine issue of material fact whether Architect \r\n  owed the subcontractors a legal duty. Cullum contends Architect undertook to \r\n  marshal and assemble contract documents and to supervise payments on the project, \r\n  thereby creating a duty to do so with due care. Further, Cullum alleges that \r\n  Architect had a legal duty not to injure foreseeable parties with whom it had \r\n  a special relationship even absent contractual privity. \r\n  \r\nCullum introduced expert testimony \r\n  supporting its assertion of a special relationship between subcontractors and \r\n  Architect. Cullum's expert, Roy D. Smith, opined: \r\n  \r\nUnder [Architect's] professional \r\n  services contract with Baptist Medical Center (\"Owner\") it was Jenkins, Hancock \r\n  &amp; Sides' (\"Architect\") professional responsibility to marshall [sic] and \r\n  assemble the contract documents, including review of the payment and labor bond \r\n  for sufficiency under the contract documents. . . . The Architect breached its \r\n  professional duty of care by failing to secure a payment bond from the contractor \r\n  as part of the preconstruction submittal package. The Architect breached it \r\n  professional duty of care by misrepresenting that failure to Cullum. \r\n  \r\nThe Architect also had a professional \r\n  duty to accurately certify payment requests of the contractor in order that \r\n  those items for which the Owner was issuing payment were in fact performed or \r\n  delivered. The Architect owed a professional duty not to certify payment applications \r\n  without reasonably assuring that the labor and payment bond had been provided. \r\n  The Architect breached its professional duty by approving such payment application \r\n  without ascertaining the existence of the labor and material payment bond. . \r\n  . . \r\n  \r\nThe Architect breached its professional \r\n  duty of care to Cullum by certifying several payment requests without obtaining \r\n  written documentation that Cullum had been paid and obtaining the surety's consent \r\n  for reduction of retainage. \r\n  \r\nWhile a tortfeasor may be liable \r\n  for dereliction of a contractual duty owed to third parties not in privity with \r\n  the tortfeasor, \"[i]t is essential to liability for negligence that the parties \r\n  have some relationship recognized by law to support the duty owed by the tort-feasor.\" \r\n  Barker v. Sauls, 289 S.C. 121, 122, 345 S.E.2d 244, 244 (1986) (citations \r\n  omitted). The trial court refused to impose a duty in tort, because \"nothing \r\n  in the present case suggests any 'special relationship' between Cullum, a sub-contractor \r\n  of Miller-Sharpe, Inc., and Jenkins, Hancock &amp; Sides, the architectural \r\n  firm engaged by the owner.\" We agree. \r\n  \r\nUnder current case law, a design \r\n  professional owes a legal duty to foreseeable parties that are not in privity \r\n  only to design and supervise construction with due care. See Tommy \r\n  L. Griffin Plumbing, 320 S.C. at 55-56, 463 S.E.2d at 88-89; see also \r\n  Beachwalk Villas Condominium Assoc., Inc. v. Martin, 305 S.C. 144, 146-47, \r\n  406 S.E.2d 372, 374 (1991) (extending the holding in Kennedy to architects \r\n  and finding an implied warranty of workmanship even absent privity); Kennedy \r\n  v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335, 345-46, 384 S.E.2d 730, \r\n  737 (1989) (\"[B]uilders [must] undertake construction commensurate with industry \r\n  standards. Where a building code or industry standard does not apply, public \r\n  policy further demands the imposition of a legal duty on a builder to refrain \r\n  from constructing housing that he knows or should know will pose serious risks \r\n  of physical harm. We recognize[ ] such a duty . . . should extend to foreseeable \r\n  parties.\"); Hill v. Polar Pantries, 219 S.C. 263, 269-71, 64 S.E.2d 885, \r\n  887-88 (1951) (implying a duty to supervise and placing liability for failure \r\n  to adequately design and supervise against the \"design professional,\" a freezer \r\n  locker operator who represented himself to be an expert in freezer lockers). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHowever, a legal duty must be ascertained \r\n  after a case-specific determination of the parties' relationship. In Tommy \r\n  L. Griffin Plumbing, the South Carolina Supreme Court recognized that under \r\n  certain circumstances, a relationship may exist between design professionals \r\n  and third parties \"such that the design professional owes a professional duty \r\n  to the plaintiff arising separate and distinct from any contractual duties.\" \r\n  Id. at 55, 463 S.E.2d at 89. There, the supreme court held the design \r\n  professional, an engineer who supervised the construction of a water trunk for \r\n  Charleston County, owed a duty to the contractor not to negligently design or \r\n  negligently supervise the project. The liability sought in this case is more \r\n  attenuated, i.e., whether a design professional, such as Architect, owes a duty \r\n  to a subcontractor, Cullum, based on the contractual obligations Architect owed \r\n  to Owner and General Contractor. \r\n  \r\nCullum alleges that Architect failed \r\n  to marshal and assemble the contract documents with due care, injuring Cullum \r\n  through inadequate business assurances required of Architect by its contract \r\n  with Owner. Although that contract limits Architect's contractual duties to \r\n  Owner's benefit, Cullum argues that the construction documents gave Architect \r\n  effective control over all facets of the work and over all parties performing \r\n  the construction; thus, Architect was required to use due care in the exercise \r\n  of those duties. Specifically, Cullum asserts the documents expressly required \r\n  Architect to verify the existence of the payment and performance bonds, to obtain \r\n  lien waivers from subcontractors whenever it approved and certified progress \r\n  payments, and to obtain Surety's approval for the reduction in the retainage. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe are reluctant to impose upon Architect \r\n  a legal duty to Cullum under these facts. There is no evidence in the record \r\n  that Cullum relied on Architect to secure any bonds for the project. In fact, \r\n  Cullum's actions lead us to the opposite conclusion. Cullum had an ongoing relationship \r\n  with General Contractor and sought to continue that relationship at the expense \r\n  of sound business practices. Cullum did not execute a contract with General \r\n  Contractor until five month after it began work. When Cullum executed the contract, \r\n  it did so with knowledge of General Contractor's history of untimely payments \r\n  and without proof a payment bond was in place. Any interested party, including \r\n  Cullum, could have requested proof of a payment bond for the project. It appears \r\n  Cullum made a business judgment not to press General Contractor for proof of \r\n  the payment bond until it was certain it would not be paid otherwise. \r\n  \r\nAlthough Cullum and other subcontractors \r\n  complained to Architect about General Contractor's failure to pay, such complaints \r\n  are insufficient to give rise to an independent legal duty flowing from Architect \r\n  to Cullum. Moreover, the subcontractors themselves knew they should be signing \r\n  lien waivers from Owner to release payments to General Contractor, but no waivers \r\n  had been presented to them. These facts put Cullum on notice that its interests \r\n  may not be protected, and it cannot now claim that Architect was obliged to \r\n  act as Cullum's protector. \r\n  \r\nWe decline to extend the reasoning \r\n  of Tommy L. Griffin Plumbing to hold Architect liable to Cullum on these \r\n  facts. Therefore, we affirm the trial judge's decision to grant summary judgment \r\n  for Architect. \r\n  \r\nAPPEAL AS TO \r\n  SURETY \r\n  \r\nCullum argues the trial court erred \r\n  by finding Surety was not liable to the subcontractors for failing to provide \r\n  a payment bond as promised in the bid bond. We disagree. \r\n \r\n\"The cardinal rule of contract interpretation \r\n  is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the parties.\" Chan v. \r\n  Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395 S.E.2d 731, 734 (Ct. App. 1990). In determining \r\n  the intention of the parties, a court first looks to the language of the contract. \r\n  C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. \r\n  Comm'n, 296 S.C. 373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988). If the language is \r\n  clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force and \r\n  effect. Id.; Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 101, 328 S.E.2d 334, \r\n  336 (1985). \r\n \r\nCullum argues that because the contract \r\n  documents required a payment bond, Surety issued the bid bond with the implicit \r\n  guarantee that it would also issue the payment bond. Further, continues Cullum, \r\n  it is this guarantee that was intended to benefit third parties such as Cullum. \r\n  The bid bond provided: \r\n  \r\nThe condition of this obligation \r\n  is such that if the aforesaid Principal [Miller-Sharpe, Inc.] shall be awarded \r\n  the contract, the said Principal will, within the time required, enter into \r\n  formal contract and give a good and sufficient bond to secure the performance \r\n  of the terms and conditions of the contract, then this obligation [is] to be \r\n  void; otherwise, the Principal and Surety will pay unto the Obligee [Baptist \r\n  Medical Center] the difference in money between the amount of the bid of said \r\n  Principal and the amount for which the Obligee legally contracts with another \r\n  party to perform the work if the latter amount be in excess of the former, but \r\n  in no event shall liability hereunder exceed the penal sum hereof, provided, \r\n  however, neither Principal nor Surety shall be bound hereunder unless Obligee \r\n  shall, prior to execution of the contract furnish evidence satisfactory to the \r\n  Surety of the Obligee's ability to make payment to the Principal in accordance \r\n  with the terms of the contract. \r\n  \r\nCullum acknowledges that \"[General \r\n  Contractor] never requested or paid for a payment or performance bond . . . \r\n  . Payment and performance bonds were never issued\" by Surety. Although Cullum \r\n  contends Surety promised it would issue a payment bond, the terms of the bid \r\n  bond clearly require General Contractor, not Surety, to obtain a payment bond. \r\n  There is simply no enforceable promise by Surety to provide a payment bond. \r\n  Moreover, because General Contractor did not obtain a payment bond, Surety's \r\n  obligation under the bid bond became void. Therefore, the trial court did not \r\n  err in ruling for Surety. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  The other \r\n  appellants filed similar lawsuits. Apparently, only Cullum sued Architect. By \r\n  stipulation, all appellants will be bound by the court's determination in Cullum's \r\n  suit against Surety. \r\n2.  Additional \r\n  applications for payment were completed by General Contractor on March 24, 1994, \r\n  for $166,112.50; and on April 22, 1994, for $3,957.70. Apparently, neither of \r\n  these payments were approved by Architect. \r\n3.  At oral argument, \r\n  Counsel for Architect stated mechanics' liens had been filed. Cullum's counsel \r\n  did not dispute that, but clarified that its remedy against Owner was inadequate. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-20 (1991) (\"However, in no event shall the \r\n  total aggregate amount of liens on the improvement exceed the amount due by \r\n  the owner.\"). The record shows that Owner owed only $&nbsp;170,259.50 on the \r\n  entire contract, and Cullum was due $ 426,728.87; therefore, the mechanics' \r\n  lien remedy against Owner was inadequate. \r\n4.  Only two contractual \r\n  relationships existed in this case, that between Owner and General Contractor \r\n  and that between Owner and Architect. The General Conditions to the Contract \r\n  for Construction contained the following provision: \r\n1.1.2 THE CONTRACT \r\nThe Contract Documents form the Contract \r\n  for Construction. . . . The Contract Documents shall not be construed to create \r\n  a contractual relationship of any kind (1) between the Architect and Contractor, \r\n  (2) between the Owner and a Subcontractor or a Subcontractor or (3) between \r\n  any persons or entities other than the Owner and Contractor. . . . \r\nAlso, provision 4.2.1 of the AIA \r\n  contract between Owner and Architect specifically limits Architect's contractual \r\n  obligations to Owner and explicitly denies any duty to third parties. Thus, \r\n  there was no contractual relationship between General Contractor and Architect, \r\n  much less between Architect and the subcontractors like Cullum. \r\nCullum's contractual link to this \r\n  project was its relationship with General Contractor. The Standard Form Agreement \r\n  that Owner executed with Architect contained this language in Provision 9.7: \r\n  \"Nothing in this Agreement shall create a contractual relationship with or a \r\n  cause of action in favor of a third party against either the Owner or Architect.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2986","title":"Tatum, et al. v.

Tatum appeals a circuit court order granting \r\n  the Medical University of South Carolina's (MUSC) motion to dismiss pursuant \r\n  to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP. Tatum contends the circuit court erred in finding workers' \r\n  compensation benefits were Tatum's exclusive remedy, thus barring her medical \r\n  malpractice claims against MUSC. We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL \r\n  HISTORY \r\n  \r\nOn November 3, 1993, Tatum injured \r\n  her back while transporting a pig in the course of her employment as an animal \r\n  care technician with MUSC. MUSC is operated and funded as a public institution \r\n  of the State of South Carolina and is a governmental entity as defined in the \r\n  South Carolina Tort Claims Act. \r\n \r\nTatum's complaint sets forth the \r\n  following facts. At the direction of MUSC, Dr. Nicholson, an assistant professor \r\n  with MUSC's Back Pain Clinic, diagnosed Tatum with a \"midline broadly based \r\n  disc herniation.\" On March 25, 1994, after repeated cervical epidural injections, \r\n  MUSC referred Tatum to Dr. Patel for surgical consultation. MUSC employed Dr. \r\n  Patel as an assistant professor and neurological surgeon. On April 6, 1994, \r\n  Dr. Patel surgically fused two of Tatum's vertebrae. On April 29, 1994, Dr. \r\n  Patel repeated the surgery because the original bone graft site collapsed. \r\n  \r\nDuring the second surgery, Dr. Patel \r\n  inserted a synthes plate by drilling and placing screws in Tatum's vertebrae. \r\n  Dr. Patel failed to inform Tatum that he planned on inserting the plate and \r\n  failed to discuss the potential risks prior to surgery. During the procedure, \r\n  Dr. Patel, or someone under his supervision, drilled through the vertebrae, \r\n  damaging Tatum's cervical spinal cord and the nerves affecting Tatum's arms \r\n  and upper extremity. Tatum alleges a reasonable patient would not have consented \r\n  to the drilling if the risks had been fairly and adequately explained. \r\n  \r\nOn June 13, 1994, after Tatum reported \r\n  experiencing difficultly swallowing, Dr. Patel performed an additional surgery \r\n  to remove a dislodged synthes plate because a screw became loosened and protruded \r\n  into Tatum's esophagus. MUSC provided Tatum with the above services through \r\n  University Medical Associates (UMA), a part of MUSC's Clinical Practice Plan. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMUSC advised Tatum her symptoms and \r\n  complaints resulted from various causes other than the above surgical procedures. \r\n  On January 26, 1995, Tatum first learned Dr. Patel's surgery caused permanent \r\n  damage to her spinal cord. Tatum has pursued her workers' compensation remedy \r\n  and has received a final award. \r\n  \r\nTatum filed this suit against MUSC \r\n  alleging Dr. Patel negligently punctured her spinal canal, which caused injury \r\n  to her cervical spinal cord, and negligently failed to inform her of the risks \r\n  associated with the procedures employed. Tatum further alleges she did not learn \r\n  of the puncture until seeking treatment from a secondary source because MUSC \r\n  failed to notify her of the surgical complications. Tatum's complaint included \r\n  a loss of consortium claim brought by her husband. \r\n  \r\nMUSC filed an amended answer arguing \r\n  the Workers' Compensation Act provided the exclusive remedy because Tatum's \r\n  injuries arose out of and in the course of her employment. MUSC moved to dismiss \r\n  pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, arguing that public entities and their employees \r\n  cannot exempt themselves from the workers' compensation provisions. MUSC further \r\n  asserted that under South Carolina Code section 42-15-70 (1976), an employer \r\n  is not liable for a physician's malpractice, and any malpractice injury is merged \r\n  into the workers' compensation award. The circuit court granted MUSC's motion \r\n  to dismiss, finding workers' compensation was Tatum's exclusive remedy. \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA motion to dismiss must be based \r\n  solely upon the allegations set forth in the complaint. Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP; \r\n  Jarrell v. Petoseed Co., Inc., 331 S.C. 207, 209, 500 S.E.2d 793, 794 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1998). \"Viewing the evidence in favor of the plaintiff, the motion \r\n  must be granted if facts alleged in the complaint and inferences reasonably \r\n  deducible therefrom do not entitle the plaintiff to relief on any theory of \r\n  the case.\" Jarrell, 331 S.C. at 209, 500 S.E.2d at 794. \"The question \r\n  to be considered is whether in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, and \r\n  with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim \r\n  for relief.\" Holy Loch Distrib., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 332 S.C. 247, 252, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 787, 790 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\n MUSC contends South Carolina Code \r\n  section 42-1-540 (1976), mandates workers' compensation benefits as Tatum's \r\n  exclusive remedy. Tatum urges this court to adopt a \"dual capacity\" analysis \r\n  whereby her employer could also be liable in malpractice as her physician. \r\n  \r\nTatum's initial injury is unquestionably \r\n  subject to the provisions of the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act, S.C. \r\n  Code Â§ 42-1-10 et seq. (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998). \"The State, its municipal \r\n  corporations and political subdivisions thereof, and the employees of the State \r\n  or its municipal corporations or political subdivisions are subject to this \r\n  title.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-320 (Supp. 1998).(1) \r\n  MUSC is a governmental entity funded and operated as a public institution of \r\n  the State of South Carolina, and Tatum was an employee of MUSC at the time of \r\n  her injury. \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina's workers' compensation \r\n  laws were enacted to provide a comprehensive approach for compensating employees \r\n  injured on the job. \"The employee receives the right to swift and sure compensation; \r\n  the employer receives immunity from tort actions by the employee. This quid \r\n  pro quo approach to [workers'] compensation has worked to the advantage \r\n  of society as well as the employee and employer.\" Parker v. Williams &amp; \r\n  Madjanik, 275 S.C. 65, 70, 267 S.E.2d 524, 526 (1980). \r\n  \r\nTo ensure the exclusivity of the \r\n  remedy provided to the employee, the Workers' Compensation Act provides in pertinent \r\n  part: \r\n  \r\nThe rights and remedies granted by \r\n  this Title to an employee when he and his employer have accepted the provisions \r\n  of this Title, respectively, to pay and accept compensation on account of personal \r\n  injury or death by accident, shall exclude all other rights and remedies \r\n  of such employee, his personal representative, parents, dependents or next \r\n  of kin as against his employer, at common law or otherwise, on account \r\n  of such injury, loss of service or death. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-540 (1985) \r\n  (emphasis added); see Carter v. Florentine Corp., Inc., 310 S.C. \r\n  228, 230, 423 S.E.2d 112, 113 (1992) (\"Where an employer is covered by Workers' \r\n  Compensation, the Act is the exclusive remedy of an employee injured in the \r\n  course and scope of employment.\"), overruled on other grounds by Ballenger \r\n  v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994); Meyer v. Piggly Wiggly \r\n  No. 24, Inc., 331 S.C.261, 264, 500 S.E.2d 190, 191-92 (Ct. App. 1998) (noting \r\n  the circuit court lacks jurisdiction to entertain a suit against the employer \r\n  when workers' compensation is the employee's exclusive remedy). The Workers' \r\n  Compensation Act further provides: \r\n  \r\n[T]he employer shall not be liable \r\n  in damages for malpractice by a physician or surgeon furnished by him pursuant \r\n  to the provisions of this section, but the consequences of any such malpractice \r\n  shall be deemed part of the injury resulting from the accident and shall be \r\n  compensated for as such. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-70 (1985). \r\n  \r\n \r\nThese statutes together form the \r\n  basis for MUSC's contention that it cannot be held liable in tort for Dr. Patel's \r\n  alleged malpractice. MUSC argues that any second injury attributable to Dr. \r\n  Patel merely collapses into the workers' compensation award. \r\n  \r\nTatum, on the other hand, argues \r\n  that these statutes address the \"free choice of doctor\" controversy and should \r\n  not be read to prevent malpractice actions against all treating physicians. \r\n  See Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, 5 Larson's Workers' Compensation \r\n  Law Â§ 61.12(b) &amp; (c) (1998). In South Carolina, unlike some other states, \r\n  the employer directs the employee to a particular treating physician for a work-related \r\n  injury. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1976); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-509(A) \r\n  (1990). The employee cannot choose her own treating physician without risking \r\n  being barred from further compensation. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60. \r\n  \r\nWe agree that Code section 42-15-70 \r\n  does not bar a medical malpractice suit against a negligent treating physician. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560 (1976) (authorizing suits for damages against \r\n  third parties). The purpose of the statute was simply to insulate the employer \r\n  from liability for a treating physician's negligence merely because the employer \r\n  exercised control in choosing the physician. We can discern no broader purpose \r\n  to the initial clause of section 42-15-70 exculpating an employer from liability \r\n  for malpractice. This interpretation accords with the basic workers' compensation \r\n  policy of insulating an employer from tort liability arising directly as a result \r\n  of an industrial accident. See Parker, 275 S.C. at 70, 267 S.E.2d \r\n  at 526. \r\n  \r\nWe likewise agree that section 42-15-70's \r\n  second clause, which MUSC alleges merges a malpractice claim into a workers' \r\n  compensation award, should not be construed to bar a separate claim for damages. \r\n  That clause has been interpreted to include as a compensable injury \"[e]very \r\n  natural consequence which flowed from this [work-related] injury, unless the \r\n  result of an independent intervening cause, sufficient to break the chain of \r\n  causation.\" Whitfield v. Daniel Constr. Co., 226 S.C. 37, 41, 83 S.E.2d \r\n  460, 462 (1954); see also Mullinax v. Winn-Dixie Stores, Inc., \r\n  318 S.C. 431, 458 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\nIn Whitfield, an employee \r\n  suffered a scalp injury at work and was given a prescription barbiturate instead \r\n  of a narcotic for pain because the company doctor had lost the privilege of \r\n  prescribing narcotics. The employee died after driving into a guard rail on \r\n  his way home from work that day. The supreme court remanded the case to determine \r\n  whether the barbiturate caused the employee to lose control of his truck and \r\n  if so, ordered that the death was compensable under workers' compensation law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nEssentially, any malpractice committed \r\n  during the treatment of a compensable work-related injury that exacerbates the \r\n  injury will also be compensable by the employer. Tatum has already received \r\n  a final award under workers' compensation that, we assume, takes into account \r\n  the enhanced injuries to her spinal column and upper extremity, which Tatum \r\n  attributes to Dr. Patel's negligence. Neither party argues holding MUSC liable \r\n  as the employer in this way is error. \r\n  \r\nThere is no doubt that, in addition \r\n  to her workers' compensation award, Tatum would be entitled to pursue a medical \r\n  malpractice action against Dr. Patel individually if he were engaged in the \r\n  private practice of medicine. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560. However, \r\n  South Carolina's Tort Claims Act (SCTCA) bars such an action in the present \r\n  case. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 et seq. (1986 &amp; Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\nThe SCTCA provides \"the exclusive \r\n  remedy for any tort committed by an employee of a governmental entity.\" S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(a) (Supp. 1998). Section 15-78-70(c) grants a physician-employee \r\n  of a governmental entity immunity for tort claims \"as long as the tort was committed \r\n  within the scope of official duty or was not committed 'with actual fraud, actual \r\n  malice, intent to harm, or a crime involving moral turpitude.'\" Higgins v. \r\n  Medical Univ. of S.C., 326 S.C. 592, 602, 486 S.E.2d 269, 274 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (quoting S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(b)). Negligence alone is insufficient \r\n  to impose liability on the governmental employee individually. Both this court \r\n  and our supreme court previously held that a doctor who performs medical services \r\n  for MUSC through UMA qualifies for section 15-78-70(c) immunity. Proveaux \r\n  v. Medical Univ. of S.C., 326 S.C. 28, 32, 482 S.E.2d 774, 776 (1997);(2) \r\n  Higgins, 326 S.C. at 603, 486 S.E.2d at 274-75. \r\n  \r\nThus, instead of suing Dr. Patel \r\n  individually, Tatum must name MUSC as the party defendant under the terms of \r\n  Code section 15-78-70(c). However, this SCTCA directive directly conflicts with \r\n  the workers' compensation exclusivity provision. Tatum is thus a victim of the \r\n  circuitous statutory logic which, at least in theory, was enacted to benefit \r\n  her. Although Tatum cannot sue MUSC for directing her to see Dr. Patel because \r\n  of the workers' compensation exclusivity provision, she should be able to sue \r\n  Dr. Patel individually as a third-party tortfeasor. Because Dr. Patel is employed \r\n  by MUSC, however, she must sue MUSC as Dr. Patel's employer, something she cannot \r\n  do because of the exclusivity provision. \r\n  \r\nTatum argues that this circuitous \r\n  result cannot have been intended by the General Assembly. She urges this court \r\n  to adopt a theory of liability known as the \"dual capacity\" doctrine, which \r\n  allows an employee to commence a traditional tort action against an employer \r\n  despite the Workers' Compensation Act, if the employer \"occupies, in addition \r\n  to his capacity as employer, a second capacity that confers on him obligations \r\n  independent of those imposed on him as an employer.\" Parker v. Williams &amp; \r\n  Madjanik, 275 S.C. 65, 75, 267 S.E.2d 524, 529 (1980) (quoting Larson, 2A \r\n  Larson's Workmen's Compensation Law Â§ 72:80 (1976)). \r\n  \r\nSome jurisdictions apply the dual \r\n  capacity doctrine in situations like Tatum's where a hospital's or doctor's \r\n  employee suffers a second or aggravated injury caused by the employer-hospital's \r\n  or employer-doctor's negligence.(3) Wright \r\n  v. Louisiana, 639 So. 2d 258 (La. 1994) (medical malpractice tort claim \r\n  allowed against employer-hospital); Guy v. Arthur H. Thomas Co., 378 \r\n  N.E.2d 488 (Ohio 1978) (same); Sturtevant v. County of Monterrey, 279 \r\n  Cal. Rptr. 161 (Ct. App. 1991) (same); see also Russell v. Orr, \r\n  700 So. 2d 619 (Miss. 1997) (remanding for further factual development on employment \r\n  relationship between negligent treating physicians and employer-hospital to \r\n  determine viability of vicarious liability tort claim by employee against employer-hospital); \r\n  Goins v. Mercy Ctr. for Health Care Servs., 667 N.E.2d 652 (Ill. App. \r\n  Ct. 1996) (tort claim for breach of Confidentiality Act allowed against employer-hospital); \r\n  Firestein v. Kingsbrook Jewish Med. Ctr., 528 N.Y.S.2d 85 (App. Div. \r\n  1988) (tort claim for negligence allowed against employer-hospital). The rationale \r\n  compelling application of the dual capacity doctrine in these situations is \r\n  \"that the medical relationship between the employer and employee is separate \r\n  from the employment relationship.\" Michael A. DiSabatino, Annotation, Modern \r\n  Status: \"Dual Capacity Doctrine\" as Basis for Employee's Recovery from Employer \r\n  in Tort, 23 A.L.R. 4th 1151, 1156 (1983 &amp; Supp. 1998). \r\n \r\nApplication of the dual capacity \r\n  doctrine has been criticized in some cases, however, for \"ignoring [the doctrine's] \r\n  central requirement of a second and distinct legal persona, not merely \r\n  a second theory of liability in the same person.\" 6 Larson's  Â§ 72.61(c), \r\n  at 14-290.60 (criticizing D'Angona v. County of Los Angeles, 613 P.2d \r\n  238 (Cal. 1980), which held a hospital liable for negligently employing the \r\n  treating doctor rather than holding hospital vicariously liable for treating \r\n  doctor's malpractice).(4) \r\n  \r\nTo combat overextending the dual \r\n  capacity doctrine, Larson proposes changing the phraseology to \"dual persona\" \r\n  doctrine to highlight the requirement of a separate legal persona rather than \r\n  merely a separate theory of liability. Id. at Â§ 72.81(a), at 14-290.88-9. \r\n  Thus, the dual persona doctrine would only apply \"if the employer had a second \r\n  capacity that created obligations to the employee independent of its obligations \r\n  as employer . . . [where] the second capacity must be so completely independent \r\n  as to create a separate legal person.\" Id. at Â§ 72.81(c), at 14-290.110-11.(5) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWhile a dual capacity doctrine does \r\n  exist in South Carolina, its current incarnation clearly does not address the \r\n  situation presented here. Willis v. Aiken County, 203 S.C. 96, 104-5, \r\n  26 S.E.2d 313, 316 (1943) (approving a dual capacity doctrine that permits executive \r\n  officers to recover under workers' compensation if the officer engaged in \"manual \r\n  labor or the ordinary duties of a workman,\" and holding a deputy sheriff was \r\n  not only an administrator but also routinely performed manual labor when discovering \r\n  and destroying illegal liquor operations; thus, deputy sheriff's injury during \r\n  such a raid was compensable). \r\n  \r\nMore recently, our supreme court \r\n  has expressly declined to expand the dual capacity doctrine on the facts presented \r\n  before it. Johnson v. Rental Uniform Serv. of Greenville, 316 S.C. 70, \r\n  447 S.E.2d 184, 184-5 (1994); Parker v. Williams &amp; Madjanik, 275 \r\n  S.C. 65, 75, 267 S.E.2d 524, 529 (1980). However, an in-depth examination of \r\n  the doctrine and the cases in South Carolina convinces us that the situation \r\n  presented here is distinctly different from the other situations in which the \r\n  doctrine has been explicitly rejected. Utilizing Larson's distinction between \r\n  the dual capacity doctrine and dual persona doctrine, we do not read the decisions \r\n  of our supreme court in Parker and Johnson as barring a dual persona \r\n  claim. \r\n  \r\nIn Parker, 275 S.C. 65, 267 \r\n  S.E.2d 524, an employee hired by a sub-sub contractor sued the general contractor \r\n  after suffering fatal injuries when a wall collapsed while the employee was \r\n  erecting a roof. The employee sought recovery against the general contractor \r\n  under the dual capacity doctrine, alleging the general contractor engaged in \r\n  architectural and engineering activities in addition to general contracting \r\n  duties. Id. at 75, 267 S.E.2d at 529. Our supreme court found the general \r\n  contractor to be the statutory employer and held, \"Assuming without deciding \r\n  that there are instances where the dual-capacity doctrine could be applied, \r\n  it is clear that under the facts of this case the doctrine is inapplicable.\" \r\n  Id. \r\n  \r\nIn rejecting the employee's argument, \r\n  the supreme court focused on the fact that the \"employee was engaged in work \r\n  which was directly related to his employment\" at the time of the injury and \r\n  thus found the employee's claims exactly the type of claim workers' compensation \r\n  was designed to cover. Id. The supreme court apparently refused to find \r\n  the general contractor occupied a second capacity with obligations independent \r\n  from those imposed as a general contractor because the employee was engaged \r\n  in the very activity at the time of the injury that he was hired to perform. \r\n  Thus, the employer owed the employee no additional duties. \r\n  \r\nThe supreme court's decision in Johnson, \r\n  316 S.C. 70, 447 S.E.2d 184, offers a similar analysis.(6) \r\n  In Johnson, the employer owned a chemical processing plant and assumed \r\n  the general contractor's role in constructing the plant after terminating the \r\n  original general contractor. Once the plant was in operation, an employee suffered \r\n  serious burns when a special dryer exploded and caused a flash fire. Because \r\n  the employee received workers' compensation benefits, the Workers' Compensation \r\n  Act barred a tort action against the employer. The employee sought to sue the \r\n  employer in its capacity as a general contractor under the dual capacity doctrine. \r\n  In a brief per curiam opinion, our supreme court declined to adopt the dual \r\n  capacity doctrine as the law of South Carolina. Id. \r\n  \r\nAs with Parker, the employee \r\n  in Johnson was acting in the capacity for which she was employed at the \r\n  time of the accident. Even if the employer undertook a second capacity, the \r\n  employer did not owe the employee any duty independent from its duties as an \r\n  employer. Because the employer never assumed obligations independent from those \r\n  imposed as an employer, the employer never assumed a dual or second persona. \r\n  Thus, neither Parker nor Johnson presented compelling facts to \r\n  develop a dual persona analysis. \r\n  \r\nThe present case presents a much \r\n  different factual situation. Tatum was not working in the capacity for which \r\n  she was hired by MUSC when she was injured by Dr. Patel's alleged malpractice. \r\n  Once MUSC began to treat Tatum for her injury, the duties it owed her transmuted \r\n  from those of an employer into those of a hospital treating a patient, including \r\n  a duty to ensure against malpractice. Thus, this secondary relationship \"created \r\n  obligations to the employee independent of its obligations as employer,\" and \r\n  the secondary relationship was so \"completely independent as to create a separate \r\n  legal person.\" 6 Larson's Â§ 72.81(c), at 14-290.110-11. \r\n  \r\nAlthough MUSC was required to direct \r\n  Tatum to a treating physician, it was not required to direct her to be treated \r\n  at its own facilities. Thus, we find that once MUSC referred Tatum to Dr. Patel \r\n  for treatment, its role as her employer ended, and it took on the legally distinct \r\n  persona of her treating hospital. Thus, MUSC's medical treatment of Tatum was \r\n  the same as its treatment of a member of the general public and bore no relation \r\n  to its other persona as Tatum's employer. MUSC conceded at oral argument that \r\n  non-employee members of the general public would have a viable malpractice claim \r\n  against MUSC on the facts presented here, and we see no reason why Tatum should \r\n  be treated differently.(7) \r\n We can discern no tenet of public \r\n  policy which would justify insulating MUSC from liability under these facts. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold that South Carolina recognizes \r\n  the dual persona doctrine in cases where the employer-hospital and its physicians \r\n  negligently treat an employee for a work-related accident and in so doing, exacerbate \r\n  the injury. The Workers' Compensation Act exclusivity provisions do not bar \r\n  a suit against MUSC in this case because MUSC was acting in a totally separate \r\n  capacity as a legally distinct persona at the time of the malpractice. Consequently, \r\n  we reverse the trial judge's dismissal of Tatum's cause of action and remand \r\n  this case for a trial on the merits. \r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  The quoted \r\n  language was in effect at the time Tatum filed her complaint. When Tatum suffered \r\n  her injury, the pre-amended version was in effect, which provided: \"Neither \r\n  the State nor any municipal corporation, nor any political subdivision thereof, \r\n  nor any employee of the State or of any such corporation or subdivision may \r\n  reject the provisions of this Title relative to payment and acceptance of compensation. \r\n  . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-320 (1985) (later amended by 1996 Act No. 424 Â§ \r\n  4, effective June 18, 1996). \r\n2.  The Proveaux \r\n  case actually discussed section 15-78-70(c) before our legislature added language \r\n  specifically covering \"practice plans,\" thus bolstering our conclusion Dr. Patel \r\n  qualifies for individual immunity. \r\n3.  In addition \r\n  to circumventing the employer's liability shield, some jurisdictions employ \r\n  the dual capacity doctrine to hold company doctors or other health care professionals \r\n  liable as co-employees despite a Workers' Compensation Act provision barring \r\n  suits against co-employees. William J. Appel, Annotation, \"Dual Capacity \r\n  Doctrine\" as Basis for Employee's Recovery for Medical Malpractice from Company \r\n  Medical Personnel, 73 A.L.R. 4th 115 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1998). This aspect \r\n  of the dual capacity doctrine is inapplicable to the present case because Dr. \r\n  Patel was not hired as a company doctor to care exclusively for MUSC employees. \r\n  Even if he were, the South Carolina Tort Claims Act would bar Tatum's suit against \r\n  Dr. Patel individually. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-70(c) (Supp. 1998). \r\n4.  The result \r\n  Larson criticizes in the D'Angona case has been abrogated by statute \r\n  in California. Cal. Lab. Code Â§ 3602 (West 1982) (amended in 1982 to provide: \r\n  \"[T]he fact that either the employee or the employer also occupied another or \r\n  dual capacity prior to, or at the time of, the employee's industrial injury \r\n  shall not permit the employee . . . to bring an action at law for damages against \r\n  the employer.\"). However, the dual persona doctrine continues to be viable in \r\n  California in cases like Tatum's. See Sturtevant v. County of Monterrey, \r\n  279 Cal. Rptr. 161 (Ct. App. 1991) (holding statutory amendment to section 3602 \r\n  did not bar suit by employee against hospital-employer because employer did \r\n  not assume dual capacity as health care provider until after the injury \r\n  had occurred). \r\n5.  The new phraseology \r\n  stems from a recognition that typical third-party statutes, like our section \r\n  42-1-560, define third parties as \"a person other than the employer,\" which \r\n  is quite different from \"a person acting in a capacity other than that of employer.\" \r\n  6 Larson's Â§ 72.81(a), at 14-290.91. Thus, Larson advocates invoking \r\n  the doctrine where the employer acts as the employee's physician, see \r\n  Id. at Â§ 72.61(b) n.65.1 (citing Duprey v. Shane, 241 P.2d 78 \r\n  (Cal. Ct. App. 1951) (permitting a suit against employer after finding a chiropractor \r\n  acted as both employer and attending physician)), but not where the employer \r\n  merely negligently employs the doctors. See, e.g., D'Angona, \r\n  613 P.2d 238 (Cal. 1980) (permitting a claim against a hospital for negligently \r\n  employing a doctor) (result later abrogated by statute, see supra \r\n  n.4). \r\n6.  The factual \r\n  discussion stems from a review of the record and briefs on file with the supreme \r\n  court. \r\n7.  Tatum also \r\n  raised an equal protection argument. However, this issue is not preserved for \r\n  our review because Tatum did not raise it in her complaint, she did not argue \r\n  it during the motion hearing, the trial judge did not rule on it, and Tatum \r\n  did not file a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for reconsideration.

We vacate.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nOn June 23, 1997, a Colleton County \r\n  grand jury indicted Clyde Elliott on one count of assault with intent to commit \r\n  criminal sexual conduct (CSC) in the first degree.(1) \r\n  At trial, the indictment was amended to assault with intent to commit CSC in \r\n  the third degree. In addition to an appropriate instruction on assault with \r\n  intent to commit CSC third, however, the trial court instructed the jury on \r\n  ABHAN as a lesser included offense. Elliott did not object to the court's charge. \r\n  The jury subsequently convicted Elliott of ABHAN, and the trial court sentenced \r\n  him to seven years imprisonment, suspended on service of four and two years \r\n  probation. Elliot now appeals.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  \r\nElliott argues the trial court lacked \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction to convict and sentence him for ABHAN, because ABHAN \r\n  is not a lesser included offense of assault with intent to commit CSC third. \r\n  We agree.\r\n  \r\nIn order for the trial court to have \r\n  jurisdiction to convict Elliot for ABHAN when he was indicted for assault with \r\n  intent to commit CSC third, ABHAN would have to be a lesser included offense \r\n  of assault with intent to commit CSC third. Murdock v. State, 308 S.C. \r\n  143, 144, 417 S.E.2d 543, 544 (1992) (circuit court does not have subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict a defendant \"unless there has been an indictment, a \r\n  waiver of indictment, or unless the charge is a lesser included offense of the \r\n  crime charged in the indictment\"). ABHAN can be a lesser included offense of \r\n  assault with intent to commit CSC third only if assault with intent to commit \r\n  CSC third contains all the elements of ABHAN. Carter v. State, 329 S.C. \r\n  355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998) (\"The test for determining when a crime \r\n  is a lesser included offense is whether the greater of the two offenses includes \r\n  all the elements of the lesser offense.\").\r\n  \r\nOne element of ABHAN is a battery. \r\n  State v. Murphy, 322 S.C. 321, 325, 471 S.E.2d 739, 741 (Ct. App. 1996) \r\n  (holding ABHAN includes an element of \"a completed act of violence\" or \"touching \r\n  of the victim\"). Battery, however, is not an element of assault with intent \r\n  to commit CSC third. State v. Morris, 289 S.C. 294, 295 n.1, 345 S.E.2d \r\n  477, 477 n.1 (1986) (\"'Assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct \r\n  . . . shall be punishable as if the criminal sexual conduct was committed.' \r\n  Battery is thus not a necessary element of this offense . . . .\").(2) \r\n  Consequently, ABHAN cannot be a lesser included offense of assault with intent \r\n  to commit CSC third, and the circuit court was without jurisdiction to convict \r\n  Elliot of ABHAN.\r\n  \r\nVACATED.\r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J., GOOLSBY and CONNOR, \r\n  JJ., concur. \r\n1.

The trial judge sentenced \r\n  him to three years imprisonment and payment of a $50,000 fine, suspended on \r\n  service of thirty months and $10,000. Robinson appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nI. SPEEDY TRIAL \r\n   \r\n  \r\nA. Factual Background \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRobinson was arrested in April 1991 \r\n  and indicted for first degree computer crime in September 1991. In December \r\n  1995, the Chief Administrative Judge for Richland County held the last of several \r\n  status conferences in the case and verbally ordered the State to try Robinson \r\n  by January 1996 or he would dismiss the case. \r\n  \r\nThe State called the case for trial \r\n  on January 30, 1996. Robinson made a pre-trial motion to dismiss based on the \r\n  State's violation of his right to a speedy trial and due process rights. Defense \r\n  counsel conceded Robinson never made a formal motion for a speedy trial, but \r\n  argued he sent letters as early as September 1994 to the solicitor and the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge indicating Robinson's willingness to proceed to trial. \r\n  Robinson first filed a motion to dismiss for failure to prosecute on May 10, \r\n  1995. This eventually lead to the January trial date. \r\n  \r\nIn response to the pre-trial motion \r\n  to dismiss, the State contended gathering evidence of the conspiracy and locating \r\n  co-conspirators took substantial time. Specifically, the State maintained the \r\n  case involved a complicated criminal conspiracy which required a thorough investigation. \r\n  Furthermore, the State argued it had difficulty locating one co-defendant whose \r\n  testimony was essential, and had been negotiating with another co-defendant \r\n  who had finally cooperated and was available to testify. The trial judge denied \r\n  Robinson's motion to dismiss. \r\n  \r\nAt the conclusion of the pre-trial \r\n  evidentiary matters, Robinson noted the indictment was defective because the \r\n  solicitor had been the only witness to appear before the grand jury. On defense \r\n  counsel's motion, the trial judge quashed the indictment. \r\n  \r\nOn February 20, 1996, the trial judge \r\n  held a hearing on Robinson's motion to dismiss because the State had failed \r\n  to prosecute the case by January 1996 as mandated by the Chief Administrative \r\n  Judge's verbal order. Although the State initially complied with the order by \r\n  calling the case on January 30, Robinson argued the State violated the order \r\n  when the case was continued because of the defective indictment. The State contended \r\n  the error in the indictment was a mere oversight, not an intent to delay the \r\n  trial. The trial judge denied Robinson's motion to dismiss finding the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge never signed a written order, the State complied with the \r\n  order by calling the case in January, the judge quashed the indictment on defense \r\n  counsel's own motion, and Robinson was not prejudiced by the delay. \r\n  \r\nRobinson was re-indicted on February \r\n  28, 1996, and tried on March 4, 1996. Robinson renewed his motion to dismiss \r\n  which was denied by the trial judge. \r\n  \r\nB. Discussion \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRobinson maintains the trial judge \r\n  erred in denying his motion to dismiss because the five-year delay between his \r\n  arrest and trial resulted in a violation of his due process rights and his right \r\n  to a speedy trial. Alternatively, Robinson argues the case should have been \r\n  dismissed because it was not tried by January 1996 as mandated by the Chief \r\n  Administrative Judge's verbal order. \r\n  \r\nThe Sixth Amendment of the United \r\n  States Constitution, as applied to the states through the Fourteenth Amendment, \r\n  guarantees an accused the right to a speedy trial. See State v. Chapman, \r\n  289 S.C. 42, 344 S.E.2d 611 (1986); Wheeler v. State, 247 S.C. 393, 147 \r\n  S.E.2d 627 (1966). This right is also provided by Article 1, Section 14, of \r\n  the South Carolina Constitution. See State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. \r\n  65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997); Chapman, 289 S.C. at 44, 344 S.E.2d at 612. \r\n  The determination of whether or not an accused has been denied his constitutional \r\n  right to a speedy trial depends on the circumstances of each case. Brazell, \r\n  325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70. In Barker v. Wingo, 407 U.S. 514 (1972), \r\n  the United States Supreme Court adopted a four part balancing test to determine \r\n  when a defendant has been denied the right to a speedy trial. The factors of \r\n  the test include: 1) the length of the delay; 2) the reason the State asserts \r\n  to justify the delay; 3) when and how the defendant asserted his right to a \r\n  speedy trial; and 4) the prejudice to the defendant. Id. at 530. South \r\n  Carolina has also adopted this approach to the speedy trial analysis. See \r\n  Brazell, 325 S.C. at 75, 480 S.E.2d at 70; State v. Smith, 307 \r\n  S.C. 376, 415 S.E.2d 409 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the five-year delay \r\n  is troubling. Although delay alone is not dispositive in the speedy trial analysis, \r\n  this substantial delay by the State in prosecuting the case is sufficient to \r\n  trigger review of the remaining three factors. See Brazell, 325 \r\n  S.C. at 75-76, 480 S.E.2d at 70 (a three-year and five-month delay was sufficient \r\n  to trigger review); State v. Waites, 270 S.C. 104, 240 S.E.2d 651 (1978) \r\n  (two-year and four-month delay in prosecution was sufficient to trigger speedy \r\n  trial analysis); Smith, 307 S.C. at 380, 415 S.E.2d at 411 (three-year \r\n  delay sufficient to trigger speedy trial review). \r\n  \r\nRobinson claims the State caused \r\n  the delay by not calling the case earlier. However, the burden is on Robinson \r\n  to show the delay resulted from the neglect and wilfulness of the State. See \r\n  State v. Dukes, 256 S.C. 218, 182 S.E.2d 286 (1971). Robinson did not \r\n  satisfy this burden. There is no evidence the delay was wilful or intentional. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, Robinson maintains he \r\n  first asserted his right to a speedy trial in 1994 by writing letters to the \r\n  solicitor and Chief Administrative Judge indicating he was ready for trial.(1) \r\n  However, we conclude Robinson first asserted his right to a speedy trial in \r\n  May 1995 when he filed the formal motion to dismiss. Robinson's trial began \r\n  only ten months after his first motion was filed. \"[F]ailure to assert the right \r\n  will make it difficult for a defendant to prove that he was denied a speedy \r\n  trial.\" Barker, 407 U.S. at 532. \r\n  \r\nAdditionally, there is no evidence \r\n  actual prejudice resulted from the delay. Robinson states he \"suffered actual \r\n  prejudice in the loss of witnesses and documents that would have been available \r\n  had the case been tried in a timely manner.\" However, this general assertion \r\n  of prejudice alone is insufficient to establish actual prejudice. Robinson cites \r\n  no specific witness or document that was unavailable because of the delay. Furthermore, \r\n  lost witnesses and documents are also disadvantages that hamper the State. See \r\n  also Chapman, 289 S.C. at 45, 344 S.E.2d at 613 (no prejudice \r\n  found where the inability to locate witnesses also hampered the State); Smith, \r\n  307 S.C. at 381, 415 S.E.2d at 412 (no prejudice found where faded memories \r\n  of witnesses also hampered the State). \r\n  \r\nAlthough the five-year delay in this \r\n  case was substantial, upon our review and balancing of the Barker factors, \r\n  we find Robinson was not denied his constitutional right to a speedy trial. \r\n  The case was tried within one year of Robinson's first formal motion to dismiss. \r\n  The State also presented adequate justification for the delay. Finally, Robinson \r\n  presented no evidence of actual prejudice. \r\n  \r\nMoreover, we conclude the State complied \r\n  with the Chief Administrative Judge's order by calling the case on January 30, \r\n  1996. Although the case was not tried until March of 1996 because of the defective \r\n  indictment, it appears the defect was not a result of wilful neglect on the \r\n  State's part. In fact, it was defense counsel's own motion to quash the indictment \r\n  that caused the case to be continued to the March term of court. Accordingly, \r\n  the trial judge did not err in denying Robinson's motion to dismiss for failure \r\n  to prosecute. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. SEARCH WARRANTS \r\n  \r\nA. Factual Background \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis case involved a complicated \r\n  forgery/credit card conspiracy between Robinson, Dorue Coleman, Michael Gibbs, \r\n  and Eric Brooker. The co-conspirators took customer invoices from a local car \r\n  dealership and gleaned information from the invoices to pull credit reports \r\n  on various individuals. The co-conspirators were looking for victims with excellent \r\n  credit histories. They then utilized information from the credit reports, such \r\n  as addresses and social security numbers, to make false birth certificates, \r\n  drivers licenses, and W-2 forms. Using these false identifications, the co-conspirators \r\n  filled out instant credit applications in various victims' names and purchased \r\n  goods. \r\n  \r\nThe police first learned of the conspiracy \r\n  when one of the victims, David Brooker, contacted the authorities about the \r\n  unauthorized use of his credit to obtain merchandise at Circuit City. On March \r\n  29, 1991, the police obtained and executed a search warrant for a storage unit \r\n  rented in the name of \"David Brooker.\" The police then learned that Gibbs had \r\n  been arrested in Georgia for using \"David Brooker's\" credit information to buy \r\n  goods, and that the receipt for the storage unit was found in Gibbs's possession. \r\n  The authorities tried to interview Gibbs, but he was uncooperative. \r\n  \r\nThe investigation also revealed that \r\n  a \"David Brooker\" was registered at the Budgetel hotel across the street from \r\n  the storage unit. The police obtained a search warrant for the hotel room which \r\n  revealed paperwork, credit reports, drivers licenses, false birth certificates, \r\n  and false credit cards relating to several different victims. Some of the credit \r\n  reports found during the search originated from C&amp;S Bank where Robinson \r\n  was employed. \r\n  \r\nOn the night of the search, the police \r\n  arrested Coleman when he entered the hotel room. Coleman was extremely cooperative \r\n  and gave the police several different statements over the next few days. Coleman \r\n  gave his final statement to the police on April 4, 1991, at approximately 4:55 \r\n  p.m. In his statements, Coleman implicated himself, Robinson, Brooker, and Gibbs. \r\n  Coleman did not know Robinson's last name, but gave a complete description of \r\n  Robinson and Robinson's wife, led the police to Robinson's home, knew Robinson \r\n  was employed at C&amp;S Bank, knew Robinson's wife's name and place of employment, \r\n  and gave details of meetings at Robinson's home. Coleman stated that Robinson's \r\n  part in the scheme was to run credit reports on individuals for the other co-conspirators \r\n  to use in securing false identifications and credit cards. \r\n  \r\nOn April 4, 1991, approximately two \r\n  hours after Coleman's last statement, the police obtained a search warrant for \r\n  Robinson's residence. When Officer Bartlett obtained the search warrant, he \r\n  first verbally explained to the magistrate his reasons for seeking the warrant. \r\n  The purpose of the April 4 search warrant was to enable the officers to look \r\n  for items, such as computer equipment, receipts, and credit reports, connecting \r\n  Robinson to the conspiracy. Bartlett told the magistrate the elements of the \r\n  case, Coleman's involvement in the conspiracy, Coleman's implication of Robinson \r\n  in the conspiracy, and the results of the previous search from the Budgetel \r\n  hotel room. Bartlett also said that he verified Robinson's employment with the \r\n  Credit Recovery Department of C&amp;S Bank. Bartlett further stated that Coleman's \r\n  statements had proven to be accurate, and that he had no reason to doubt Coleman's \r\n  veracity. \r\n  \r\nAfter the verbal explanation of probable \r\n  cause, Bartlett prepared the search warrant affidavit. The search warrant affidavit \r\n  read as follows: \r\n  \r\nthe resident and residence has been \r\n  identified as a co-conspirator in a series of interstate fraud and forgeries. \r\n  The resident identified as Bill Robinson has been implicated by a co-defendant. \r\n  Furthermore, the co-defendant has been in meetings at the residence described \r\n  herein to plan these frauds and forgeries. \r\n  \r\nThereafter, the magistrate swore \r\n  Bartlett, Bartlett signed the affidavit, and the magistrate issued the search \r\n  warrant. Bartlett stated he had no reason to believe that the search warrant \r\n  affidavit was insufficient. \r\n  \r\nRobinson was present during the April \r\n  4 search of his residence. The search revealed receipts for merchandise in several \r\n  victims' names, credit reports and receipts that matched information found in \r\n  the Budgetel hotel room search, computers and stereo equipment, and an instruction \r\n  manual about remote access to the Credit Bureau in Atlanta. \r\n  \r\nOn April 8, the police obtained a \r\n  second search warrant for Robinson's residence. During the first search, police \r\n  officers took serial numbers from various items for which Robinson claimed ownership. \r\n  Upon further investigation, the police discovered the items were obtained by \r\n  fraudulent means. Therefore, the police obtained the April 8 search warrant \r\n  to recover those items. The April 8 search warrant was based entirely upon observations \r\n  made during the execution of the April 4 search warrant. \r\n  \r\nAt trial, Robinson moved to suppress \r\n  any evidence gained as a result of the search warrants. Robinson argued the \r\n  April 4 search warrant affidavit was insufficient on its face to support a finding \r\n  of probable cause and was not properly supplemented by sworn oral testimony. \r\n  Robinson further argued any evidence obtained by the April 8 search was \"fruit\" \r\n  of the first unlawful search. The trial judge agreed the affidavit was deficient \r\n  on its face because it failed to include any facts or underlying reasons concerning \r\n  the informant's veracity. However, the trial judge found the affidavit was properly \r\n  supplemented by Bartlett's sworn oral testimony concerning probable cause. Thereafter, \r\n  he denied Robinson's motion to suppress. \r\n  \r\nB. Discussion \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRobinson argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying his motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of the April \r\n  4 search. Specifically, Robinson argues the search warrant affidavit was insufficient \r\n  on its face to establish probable cause, and the affidavit was not properly \r\n  supplemented by sworn oral testimony. \r\n  \r\nA search warrant may issue only upon \r\n  a finding of probable cause. State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d \r\n  801 (1997). The magistrate's task in determining whether to issue a search warrant \r\n  is to make a practical, common sense decision concerning whether, under the \r\n  totality of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, there is a fair probability \r\n  that evidence of a crime will be found in the particular place to be searched. \r\n  State v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 454 S.E.2d 905 (Ct. App. 1995). This \r\n  decision includes consideration of the veracity of the person supplying the \r\n  information and the basis of his or her knowledge. State v. Johnson, \r\n  302 S.C. 243, 395 S.E.2d 167 (1990); Philpot, 317 S.C. at 461, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  at 907. The affidavit must contain sufficient underlying facts and information \r\n  upon which the magistrate can make a probable cause determination. Philpot, \r\n  317 S.C. at 461, 454 S.E.2d at 907. Mere conclusory statements which give the \r\n  magistrate no basis to make a judgment regarding probable cause are insufficient. \r\n  Id. When a search warrant affidavit is insufficient on its face to establish \r\n  probable cause, it may be supplemented by sworn oral testimony before the magistrate. \r\n  Weston, 329 S.C. at 290, 494 S.E.2d at 802; Johnson, 302 S.C. \r\n  at 249, 395 S.E.2d at 170; Philpot, 317 S.C. at 461, 454 S.E.2d at 907. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIn this case, the search warrant \r\n  affidavit is insufficient on its face to establish probable cause. The affidavit \r\n  provided the magistrate with no information about Coleman's reliability or veracity. \r\n  Specifically, the affidavit does not even mention Coleman by name. Applying \r\n  the totality of the circumstances test, the affidavit did not provide the magistrate \r\n  with sufficient information to make a probable cause determination. See \r\n  Philpot, 317 S.C. at 461, 454 S.E.2d at 907 (no substantial basis for \r\n  probable cause existed where magistrate was given no information regarding the \r\n  reliability of the confidential informant). \r\n  \r\nHowever, we conclude the affidavit \r\n  was properly supplemented by sworn oral testimony. Bartlett testified he first \r\n  verbally informed the magistrate about the basis for probable cause to search \r\n  Robinson's residence. He included in his testimony facts about Coleman's reliability \r\n  and veracity. He then filled out the warrant and affidavit and submitted the \r\n  warrant for the magistrate's signature. When he presented the warrant, Bartlett \r\n  was sworn. He testified the magistrate \"ask[ed] that do you swear the information \r\n  is true, and then [Bartlett] sign[ed] the affidavit.\" (emphasis added). The \r\n  magistrate swore Bartlett not only to the information contained in the affidavit, \r\n  but also retroactively to the information first presented in the form of oral \r\n  testimony. \r\n  \r\nOur courts have not addressed the \r\n  proper procedure for administering an oath, so we must look to other jurisdictions \r\n  for guidance. Although more meticulous in the technical requirements for search \r\n  warrants, federal courts have upheld warrants where the affiant was not sworn \r\n  until after presenting supporting or supplemental facts of the case. See \r\n  United States v. Turner, 926 F.2d 883 (9th Cir. 1991), cert. \r\n  denied, 502 U.S. 830 (1991) (failure to place affiant under oath until after \r\n  she had recited supporting facts for search warrant did not invalidate telephonic \r\n  warrant); United States v. Stefanson, 648 F.2d 1231 (9th Cir. \r\n  1981) (telephonic warrant was valid where oath was given after the oral information, \r\n  rather than immediately before it); United States v. Johnson, 641 F.2d \r\n  652 (9th Cir. 1981) (telephonic warrant was valid where oath was \r\n  given after oral statements were made and information would have been substantially \r\n  identical if the oath had been taken prior to the statements). \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, other jurisdictions \r\n  have upheld warrants where the affiant was not sworn until after stating facts \r\n  necessary to supplement the affidavit. See Ohio v. Wilmoth, 490 \r\n  N.E.2d 1236 (Ohio 1986) (Oath was not constitutionally infirm where it was given \r\n  after officers had testified about probable cause.); cf. Massachusetts \r\n  v. Bass, 512 N.E.2d 519 (Mass. App. Ct. 1987) (Search warrant was upheld \r\n  even though supplemental information contained in unsworn typewritten pages \r\n  was considered in issuing the warrant.); Michigan v. Mitchell, 370 N.W.2d \r\n  392 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985) (Even though the affidavit was unsigned when the search \r\n  warrant was issued, it may be signed and sworn to nunc pro tunc.); New \r\n  York v. Sullivan, 437 N.E.2d 1130 (N.Y. 1982) (As long as there is a method \r\n  of verification alerting the maker of the statement of the consequences of providing \r\n  false information, then the affidavit is supported by \"oath or affirmation,\" \r\n  even if unsworn.); Loudermilk v. Oklahoma, 177 P.2d 129 (Okla. Crim. \r\n  App. 1947) (No particular ceremony is necessary to constitute the act of swearing \r\n  to an affidavit for a search warrant.). \r\n  \r\nMoreover, the purpose of the oath \r\n  requirement is to impress upon the affiant the solemnity of the occasion and \r\n  the need to tell the truth. Johnson, 641 F.2d at 657. Even if Bartlett \r\n  was sworn after presenting his oral testimony, he still understood the need \r\n  to provide truthful information to the magistrate and the criminal consequences \r\n  if he testified falsely. His testimony would have been substantially the same \r\n  whether he was sworn before or after giving this information to the magistrate.(2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRobinson argues State v. York, \r\n  250 S.C. 30, 156 S.E.2d 326 (1967) should control the case before us. We find \r\n  York distinguishable from the present case. In York, a sheriff \r\n  testified he had a \"conversation\" with the magistrate when the search warrant \r\n  was issued. Id. Our Supreme Court held this was insufficient to establish \r\n  that the sheriff furnished information under oath or affirmation. Id. \r\n  at 36, 156 S.E.2d at 328. However, contrary to this case, there was no evidence \r\n  the sheriff had ever been sworn, either before or after his \"conversation.\"(3) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBecause we find the first search \r\n  lawful, evidence found pursuant to the April 8 search warrant was also properly \r\n  admitted. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge did \r\n  not err in denying Robinson's motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result \r\n  of the April 4 and April 8 searches. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nIII. CUSTODIAL STATEMENT \r\n  \r\nA. Factual Background \r\n  \r\n  \r\nDuring the April 4 search, Bartlett \r\n  advised Robinson of his Miranda rights.(4) \r\n  That same night, the police transported Robinson to the police station where \r\n  he was again advised of his Miranda rights. Robinson subsequently waived \r\n  these rights. Bartlett testified Robinson seemed to be well-educated and appeared \r\n  to understand his rights. Furthermore, he was not coerced or threatened into \r\n  making a statement. Thereafter, Robinson gave a seven-page written statement. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn arrest warrant was not served \r\n  on Robinson until April 8. Bartlett testified Robinson's custodial statement \r\n  and the results of the April 4 search were not the only reasons behind Robinson's \r\n  subsequent arrest. Bartlett stated he had probable cause to arrest Robinson \r\n  prior to the execution of the April 4 search warrant. However, Bartlett did \r\n  not procure an arrest warrant until April 8 because he \"wanted to basically \r\n  get everything, get all the ducks in a row, get everything in order, making \r\n  sure [he was] absolutely right [in the arrest].\" When asked on cross-examination \r\n  whether he would have placed Robinson under arrest if nothing had been found \r\n  in the April 4 search, Bartlett responded \"[t]hat is an iffy question, obviously. \r\n  I believe at the time that we could have arrested him; and I think that is probably \r\n  for the delay and that was probably why we waited to do the -- to get the statement \r\n  from him, to make sure we had everything right.\" \r\n  \r\nAt trial, Robinson moved to suppress \r\n  his seven-page custodial statement because it was not given freely and voluntarily. \r\n  The trial judge denied Robinson's motion to suppress. Robinson also argued the \r\n  statement was inadmissible because it was obtained as a direct result of the \r\n  unlawful search. The trial judge denied the motion to suppress on this issue \r\n  after finding the search was lawful. \r\n  \r\nB. Discussion \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRobinson argues the trial judge erred \r\n  in denying his motion to suppress the seven-page custodial statement because \r\n  it should have been inadmissible as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" Robinson \r\n  contends the police lacked probable cause to arrest him prior to the unlawful \r\n  search of his residence on April 4, and therefore, his statement was a result \r\n  of that unlawful search and inadmissible. \r\n  \r\nBecause we hold the April 4 search \r\n  was lawful, we also find that the custodial statement was not \"fruit of the \r\n  poisonous tree.\" Therefore, the trial court properly admitted Robinson's custodial \r\n  statement. \r\n  \r\nEven so, the police still had probable \r\n  cause to arrest Robinson prior to the April 4 search. \r\n \r\nWhen determining the constitutional \r\n  validity of an arrest, a court must consider \"whether, at the moment the arrest \r\n  was made, the officers had probable cause to make it -- whether at that moment \r\n  the facts and circumstances within their knowledge and of which they had reasonably \r\n  trustworthy information were sufficient to warrant a prudent man in believing \r\n  that the [appellant] had committed . . . an offense.\" Beck v. Ohio, 379 \r\n  U.S. 89, 91 (1964). Whether probable cause exists depends upon the totality \r\n  of the circumstances surrounding the information at the officers disposal. State \r\n  v. George, 323 S.C. 496, 476 S.E.2d 903 (1996), cert. denied, 520 \r\n  U.S. 1123 (1997). \r\n  \r\nAs discussed above, co-defendant \r\n  Coleman gave a series of statements to the police implicating Robinson in the \r\n  conspiracy. Coleman stated Robinson's part in the scheme consisted of running \r\n  credit reports on various individuals for use in securing false identifications \r\n  and credit cards. Although Coleman did not know Robinson's last name, he gave \r\n  the police a complete description of Robinson and Robinson's wife, led the police \r\n  to Robinson's home, knew Robinson was employed at C&amp;S Bank, knew Robinson's \r\n  wife's name and place of employment, and gave details of meetings at Robinson's \r\n  home. The search of the Budgetel hotel room had already revealed credit reports, \r\n  and Bartlett had confirmed Robinson was employed with the Recovery Department \r\n  at C&amp;S. We conclude, under the totality of the circumstances, the police \r\n  had probable cause to arrest Robinson prior to the execution of the search warrant. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J. and GOOLSBY, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  The letters \r\n  are not included in the record on appeal. \r\n2.  Although we \r\n  find no error under the facts in this case, a better procedure would be for \r\n  the magistrate to swear the affiant before considering supplemental oral testimony. \r\n  \r\n3.  The State \r\n  also argues that even if the search warrant is invalid, the search warrant should \r\n  be upheld under the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule. However, \r\n  the good faith exception is inapplicable in cases where the affidavit fails \r\n  to provide the magistrate with a substantial basis for probable cause. Weston, \r\n  329 S.C. at 293, 494 S.E.2d at 804; Johnson, 302 S.C. at 248-49, 395 \r\n  S.E.2d at 170. Therefore, the good faith exception may not be used to validate \r\n  the warrant. \r\n4.

Hendricks \r\n  was carrying medical equipment weighing approximately 150 pounds at the time \r\n  of the incident. \r\n  \r\nHendricks filed a Form 50 on March \r\n  30, 1995. On April 11, 1995, Hendricks's vertebrae at L5-S1 were fused. At the \r\n  same time, he underwent an L4-5 laminectomy and foraminotomy, and L5-S1 foraminotomy \r\n  to his spine. On May 1, 1995, Respondents filed a Form 51, contending there \r\n  was no injury by accident and refusing to pay for any of Hendricks's medical \r\n  treatment. \r\n  \r\nA hearing was held on November 30, \r\n  1995, before a commissioner who found that Hendricks had suffered an injury \r\n  to his back and left leg. The commissioner found Hendricks had reached maximum \r\n  medical improvement (MMI) with regard to his back on July 25, 1995, but had \r\n  not reached MMI with regard to his left knee. The commissioner further ordered \r\n  that Respondents were liable for all medical expenses causally related to the \r\n  February 21, 1995, injury until such time as Hendricks reached MMI. \r\n  \r\nOn April 15, 1996, Respondents filed \r\n  an application to stop payment of Hendricks's temporary total disability (TTD) \r\n  benefits, alleging he had reached MMI. Following a hearing, the commissioner \r\n  issued an order finding that Hendricks had reached MMI with regard to his left \r\n  knee on December 11, 1995, and that he had a 20% impairment to the left leg \r\n  and a 19% impairment to the back. The commissioner also found Respondents were \r\n  entitled to a credit for all TTD benefits paid after April 15, 1996, the date \r\n  they filed their stop payment request. Both parties requested review by the \r\n  Full Commission. \r\n  \r\nThe Full Commission modified the \r\n  single commissioner's order in two ways: first, it increased the permanent impairment \r\n  to Hendricks's back to 40%, and second, it awarded Respondents a credit for \r\n  all TTD compensation paid after December 11, 1995, the date Hendricks reached \r\n  MMI. In all other respects, the Full Commission affirmed the single commissioner's \r\n  order. \r\n  \r\nBoth sides appealed to the Pickens \r\n  County Circuit Court. The circuit court judge affirmed the Full Commission's \r\n  decision except for the 40% impairment rating to Hendricks's back. Finding there \r\n  was no substantial, reliable, or probative evidence to support the 40% impairment, \r\n  the circuit court reinstated the single commissioner's award of 19% permanent \r\n  disability to the back. Hendricks appeals.  \r\n  \r\n STANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe duty to determine facts is placed \r\n  solely on the commission. The court reviewing the commission's decision has \r\n  no authority to determine factual issues but must remand the matter to the commission \r\n  for further proceedings. Fox v. Newberry County Mem'l Hosp., 319 S.C. \r\n  278, 280, 461 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1995). On appeal from the commission, this court \r\n  may not substitute its judgment for the commission's as to the weight of evidence \r\n  on questions of fact, but may reverse when the decision is affected by an error \r\n  of law. Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 337, 478 S.E.2d 74, \r\n  76 (Ct. App. 1996). The appellate court's review is limited to deciding whether \r\n  the commission's decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled \r\n  by some error of law. See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, \r\n  276 S.E.2d 304, 306 (1981); Rogers v. Kunja Knitting Mills, Inc., 312 \r\n  S.C. 377, 381, 440 S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHendricks raises eleven issues on \r\n  appeal. They can be fairly summarized as follows: \r\n  \r\n1. Whether the circuit court erred \r\n  in affirming the commission's decision to not award compensation under the general \r\n  disability statutes? \r\n  \r\n\r\n  Whether the circuit court erred \r\n    in reinstating the single commissioner's finding of a 19% impairment to Hendricks's \r\n    back? \r\n     \r\n\r\n3. Whether the circuit court erred \r\n  in affirming the commission's order granting Respondents a credit for any TTD \r\n  payments made after Hendricks reached MMI? \r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether the circuit court erred \r\n      in concluding that Respondents were not liable for medical treatment for \r\n      Hendricks's back after he reached MMI?\r\n     \r\n     \r\n  \r\n\r\n5. Whether the circuit court erred \r\n  in affirming the commission's award under South Carolina Code section 42-9-30 \r\n  when the commission did not review the videotapes admitted into evidence before \r\n  the single commissioner? \r\n  \r\nI. General disability compensation \r\n  versus scheduled member \r\n  \r\nHendricks argues he was qualified \r\n  to receive disability compensation under the general disability statutes, South \r\n  Carolina Code sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998). He contends \r\n  the commission failed to make sufficient findings of fact concerning his entitlement \r\n  to general disability benefits and that the case should be remanded for further \r\n  findings in this regard. We agree this issue should be remanded. \r\n  \r\nHendricks clearly asserted his entitlement \r\n  to general disability compensation before the single commissioner. \"[A] claimant \r\n  may proceed under Â§ 42-9-10 or Â§ 42-9-20 to prove a general disability; alternatively, \r\n  he or she may proceed under Â§ 42-9-30 to prove a loss, or loss of use of, a \r\n  member, organ, or part of the body for which specific awards are listed in the \r\n  statute.\" Fields v. Owens Corning Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 555, 393 S.E.2d \r\n  172, 173 (1990). Nevertheless, the commissioner's order does not address this \r\n  issue.(1) Hendricks also raised this issue before \r\n  the Full Commission and before the circuit court. \r\n  \r\nThe Full Commission affirmed the \r\n  order of the single commissioner in all respects except that it increased the \r\n  permanent disability compensation for injuries to Hendricks's back from 19% \r\n  to 40%; however, it did not analyze whether Hendricks was entitled to total \r\n  or partial permanent disability benefits under section 42-9-10 or section 42-9-20. \r\n  This was error. See Morgan v. JPS Automotives, 321 S.C. 201, 204-05, \r\n  467 S.E.2d 457, 459 (Ct. App. 1996) (Where the single commissioner failed to \r\n  make any findings regarding appellant's claim that her disability extended beyond \r\n  the disability to the scheduled member, the case was remanded to the commission \r\n  for specific findings of fact on that issue.), cert. dismissed as improvidently \r\n  granted, 326 S.C. 261, 486 S.E.2d 263 (1997); see, e.g., Gilliam \r\n  v. Woodside Mills, 319 S.C. 385, 461 S.E.2d 818 (1995) (holding case should \r\n  have been remanded to commission to address claimant's eligibility for an award \r\n  under sections 42-9-10 and 42-9-20 when substantial evidence showed injury not \r\n  confined to scheduled member). Accordingly, we remand this issue to the commission \r\n  for specific findings as to whether Hendricks's disability extends beyond the \r\n  disabilities to the scheduled members. \r\n  \r\nII. Reinstatement of single commissioner's \r\n  finding of a  19% impairment to the back \r\n  \r\nHendricks contends the circuit court \r\n  erred in reinstating the single commissioner's finding of a 19% impairment to \r\n  Hendricks's back rather than affirming the commission's finding of a 40% back \r\n  impairment. We find there was substantial evidence in the record to support \r\n  the commission's conclusion. Therefore, it was error for the circuit court judge \r\n  to substitute his findings of fact on this issue for those found by the commission. \r\n  See Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 135, 276 S.E.2d 304, 306 \r\n  (1981); Rogers v. Kunja Knitting Mills, Inc., 312 S.C. 377, 381, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d 401, 403 (Ct. App. 1994). We reverse and reinstate the commission's finding \r\n  of a 40% impairment, subject to the commission's decision to award Hendricks \r\n  total or partial disability benefits under the general disability versus scheduled \r\n  member statutes. \r\n  \r\nIII. Propriety of credit to Respondents \r\n  for TTD benefits paid after date of MMI \r\n  \r\nHendricks argues it was error to \r\n  grant Respondents a credit for temporary disability benefits paid during the \r\n  period between his reaching MMI on December 11, 1995, and the commission's order \r\n  dated October 23, 1996. Hendricks contends he remained totally disabled and \r\n  unable to work, arguing a finding of MMI does not establish an end to his disability \r\n  or to his entitlement to benefits. We find no error. \r\n  \r\nThe first single commissioner's order, \r\n  dated February 26, 1996, found Hendricks reached MMI with regard to his back \r\n  on July 25, 1995, but found the employer liable for continuing TTD payments \r\n  until Hendricks reached MMI for all injuries arising from his work-related accident. \r\n  This unappealed order is the law of this case. Smith v. South Carolina Dept. \r\n  of Mental Health 329 S.C. 485, 502 n.9, 494 S.E.2d 630, 639 n.9 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997) (\"'[A]ll findings of fact and law by the Hearing Commissioner became and \r\n  are the law of [the] case, except only those within the scope of the exception \r\n  of defendant and the notice given to the parties by the Commission . . . .'\" \r\n  (quoting Ham v. Mullins Lumber Co., 193 S.C. 66, 74, 7 S.E.2d 712, 716 \r\n  (1940))), cert. granted, (Oct. 7, 1998). \r\n  \r\nThe second single commissioner's \r\n  order, dated October 14, 1996, found that Hendricks reached MMI with regard \r\n  to his left knee on December 11, 1995, and that his eligibility for temporary \r\n  disability benefits ended as of that date. These findings were affirmed by the \r\n  commission, which amended the single commissioner's order to grant Respondents \r\n  a credit for any TTD compensation paid after December 11, 1995, the final MMI \r\n  date. \r\n  \r\nOnce the commission affirmed that \r\n  Hendricks had reached MMI, it was then appropriate to terminate TTD benefits \r\n  in favor of either permanent partial or permanent total disability benefits, \r\n  if warranted by substantial evidence in the record. O'Banner v. Westinghouse \r\n  Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 27-8, 459 S.E.2d 324, 326 (Ct. App. 1995) (explaining \r\n  that under Regulation 67-507, an employer successfully rebuts the presumption \r\n  a claimant is still entitled to TTD benefits by producing a certificate of MMI); \r\n  see S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-9-10, -20, -30; Williams v. South Carolina \r\n  Dep't of Mental Retardation, 308 S.C. 438, 440, 418 S.E.2d 555, 557 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992) (remanding to commission to redetermine date of MMI and to recalculate \r\n  TTD benefits based upon the new MMI date). Similarly, it was then appropriate \r\n  for the commission to determine whether to provide a credit to the employer \r\n  and carrier pursuant to South Carolina Code section 42-9-210 (1985). \r\n  \r\nIn arguing that the credit his employer \r\n  received was erroneous, Hendricks relies on Swinton v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Mental Health, 314 S.C. 202, 442 S.E.2d 215 (Ct. App. 1994), for the \r\n  proposition that a claimant's total disability is presumed to continue when \r\n  he is unable to return to work because of an injury, and in such a case a credit \r\n  is not warranted.(2) We do not find Swinton \r\n  controlling because it was a case where the employer unilaterally suspended \r\n  TTD payments under former Regulation 67-504, which clearly required proof not \r\n  only of MMI but also that the employee was capable of returning to work without \r\n  restriction. Id. at 203, 442 S.E.2d at 216; 25A S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 67-504(B) \r\n  (1990) (later amended by 21 S.C. Reg., No. 4 at 87-8, effective April 25, 1997); \r\n  see also Grayson v. Carter Rhoad Furniture, 317 S.C. 306, 310, \r\n  454 S.E.2d 320, 322 (1995) (An employer seeking to terminate TTD benefits pursuant \r\n  to Regulation 67-504 must provide clear proof of the employee's ability to return \r\n  to work without restriction.). Because there was no showing in Swinton \r\n  that the claimant was able to return to work without restriction, it was inappropriate \r\n  in that case to award a credit for TTD benefits paid after the date of MMI. \r\n  Swinton, 314 S.C. at 203-4, 442 S.E.2d at 216; see 25A S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Reg. 67-504(C) (1990) (once employee has reached MMI and returned \r\n  to work for 15 consecutive days, disability is presumptively over); 25A S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Reg. 67-504(F)(2) (1990) (by signing a Form 17 to terminate TTD, employee \r\n  agrees the benefits cease as of the day of return to work). \r\n  \r\nHendricks's case, on the other hand, \r\n  is governed by former Regulation 67-507, under which an employer could petition \r\n  the commission for permission to terminate TTD based only upon MMI; no further \r\n  showing that the employee was able to return to work without restriction was \r\n  required. 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-507(C)(3)(a) (1990) (repealed by 21 S.C. \r\n  Reg., No. 6, Part 2 at 439, effective June 27, 1997); O'Banner v. Westinghouse \r\n  Elec. Corp., 319 S.C. 24, 27-8, 459 S.E.2d 324, 326 (Ct. App. 1995) (rejecting \r\n  notion that employer must provide proof of employee's ability to return to work \r\n  before terminating TTD benefits under regulation 67-507). Regulation 67-507(B) \r\n  clearly envisioned that a disability could continue past the date of MMI, but \r\n  significantly, contained no presumptive date when the TTD benefits were deemed \r\n  ended. \r\n  \r\nFinally, by not appealing the first \r\n  single commissioner's order, Hendricks tacitly agreed to terminate his TTD benefits \r\n  as of his last MMI date. Thus, we find no error in the commission's decision \r\n  to credit Respondents with TTD benefits paid after that date. \r\nIV. Payment of medical treatment \r\n  until Hendricks reached MMI \r\n  \r\nHendricks also contends Respondents \r\n  should pay for medical treatment for his back until he reached MMI for both \r\n  his injury to his back and to his leg. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIn her order dated February 29, 1996, \r\n  the single commissioner stated: \"Under Section 42-15-60, S.C. Code Ann. (1976), \r\n  defendants are liable for all medical expenses causally related to claimant's \r\n  injuries of February 21, 1995 until such time as he reaches maximum medical \r\n  improvement.\" This unappealed order is the law of this case. Smith v. South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Mental Health 329 S.C. 485, 502 n.9, 494 S.E.2d 630, 639 \r\n  n.9 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\nHendricks argues that because he \r\n  still suffered a disability to his back regardless of a finding of MMI on July \r\n  25, 1995, his employer should pay for all treatment costs for his back through \r\n  December 11, 1995. Hendricks contends that although the commissioner determined \r\n  he had reached MMI to his back prior to reaching MMI to his knee, her order \r\n  should be construed to include all medical expenses paid for both his \r\n  knee and his back through the final MMI date. \r\n  \r\nIn an appropriate case, this argument \r\n  may have merit; here, however there is no evidence in the record that any of \r\n  Hendricks's back treatments between the two MMI dates were undertaken to lessen \r\n  the period of disability. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1976) (commission could \r\n  find employer responsible for paying for ongoing treatment beyond the first \r\n  ten weeks of disability, provided such treatment was intended to lessen the \r\n  degree of permanent impairment, or lessen the period of disability). In fact, \r\n  the second single commissioner's order was incorporated by reference into the \r\n  commission's order, including finding of fact number sixteen: \"That further \r\n  medical treatment will not lessen claimant's disability.\" Thus, Respondents \r\n  were liable for all authorized medical expenses related to these injuries only \r\n  through their respective MMI dates. \r\n  \r\nV. Viewing of the videotapes \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAt the hearing before the single \r\n  commissioner, investigator John D. Tuck testified for Respondents. Tuck conducted \r\n  surveillance by videotaping Hendricks on March 18-19, 1996, and July 5, 1996. \r\n  Tuck testified he observed occasions where Hendricks was limping and holding \r\n  or rubbing his back. However, he stated this was not on the videotape. The commissioner \r\n  informed counsel for both parties in advance of the hearing that they each could \r\n  show only three minutes of the videotape. The following discussion took place \r\n  at the hearing: \r\n  \r\nMr. Kale: Your Honor, we at this \r\n  time would like to move for the introduction of the surveillance video and play \r\n  it for you. \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Any objection, Mr. Turnage? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Well, I haven't seen \r\n  what they're going to do. I don't know which portion they have identified. Will \r\n  I have an opportunity to have him go over other portions of the tape? I don't \r\n  know what they have selected. They didn't provide-- \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Have you seen the entire \r\n  videotape? \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: I've seen the whole \r\n  thing. \r\n  \r\nThe Court: So there is nothing in \r\n  there that you have not seen? \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Right. We have not seen. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Then what is your objection? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Because I haven't seen \r\n  what they're going to show. \r\n  \r\nThe Court: You have. You just haven't \r\n  seen it narrowed down. \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Well, if I'll have an \r\n  opportunity to show other portions of the tape, then I will-- \r\n  \r\nThe Court: Did you list videotape \r\n  as something that you were going to show? \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: No, Ma'am, but we also \r\n  received two huge video disks. And if he is going to introduce portions of those \r\n  videotapes, we ought to be able to-- \r\n  \r\nThe Court: It is my understanding \r\n  that he is going to introduce the entire videotape, but during a hearing, I'll \r\n  only watch three minutes. \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Are you going to review \r\n  the entire film? \r\n  \r\nThe Court: No. He retains possession \r\n  of it. \r\n  \r\nMr. Turnage: Well, we have a copy \r\n  and we would like to put the whole thing in the record. \r\n  \r\nThe Court: The whole thing is going \r\n  to be put in record, but whoever puts it in retains possession. We don't retain \r\n  possession of it. \r\n  \r\nCounsel for Respondents played three \r\n  minutes of the video. The video showed Hendricks driving a tractor, driving \r\n  his sports utility vehicle, carrying one of his children under his arm, bending \r\n  and stooping, lifting gallon jugs of milk, and stepping over a plywood board. \r\n  Hendricks's attorney did not show any video footage during the hearing. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHendricks does not contend that the \r\n  single commissioner erred in refusing to allow the parties to play more than \r\n  three minutes of the video. Thus, the propriety of the single commissioner's \r\n  decision to limit each side to three minutes is not before us. Instead, Hendricks \r\n  maintains the commission should have reviewed the video tapes because the tapes \r\n  were admitted into the record as evidence. According to Hendricks, the commission, \r\n  as the ultimate fact finder, was duty bound to view the tapes as part of the \r\n  whole record. The case law and statutory authority support this position. See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (that appellate court cannot substitute its \r\n  judgment for the commission's on issues of fact implies record must contain \r\n  findings of fact to review); see also Smith v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Mental Health, 329 S.C. 485, 498, 494 S.E.2d 630, 636-7 (1997) (finding \r\n  commissioner erred by admitting irrelevant testimony, but then refusing to continue \r\n  hearing to elicit relevant testimony; commissioner allowed attorneys to proffer \r\n  their evidence, but refused to consider it). \r\n  \r\nSection 1-23-320 of the Administrative \r\n  Procedures Act provides in part: \r\n  \r\n(a) In a contested case, all parties \r\n  must be afforded an opportunity for hearing after notice of not less than thirty \r\n  days . \r\n(e) Opportunity shall be afforded \r\n  all parties to respond and present evidence and argument on all issues involved. \r\n  \r\n(g) The record in a contested case \r\n  shall include: \r\n(1) all pleadings, motions, intermediate \r\n  rulings and depositions; \r\n(2) evidence received or considered; \r\n  \r\n(3) a statement of matters officially \r\n  noticed; \r\n(4) questions and offers of proof, \r\n  objections and rulings thereon; \r\n(5) proposed findings and exceptions; \r\n  \r\n(6) any decision, opinion or report \r\n  by the officer or administrative law judge presiding at the hearing. \r\n(i) Findings of fact shall \r\n  be based exclusively on the evidence and on matters officially noticed. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§1-23-320 (1976 &amp; \r\n  Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). Section 1-23-330 provides: \"(1) In contested cases: \r\n  Irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Except \r\n  in proceedings before the Industrial Commission the rules of evidence as applied \r\n  in civil cases in the court of common pleas shall be followed.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 1-23-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\nBecause the evidence regarding the \r\n  extent of Hendricks's disability was in substantial conflict, the entire videotape \r\n  cannot be deemed irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious of the other \r\n  evidence presented. The entire videotape was admitted into evidence by the single \r\n  commissioner. The commissioner made specific reference to the videotape in her \r\n  findings with respect to the extent of Hendricks's impairment. While the Full \r\n  Commission is empowered to reach findings of fact and conclusions of law consistent \r\n  or inconsistent with those of the commissioner, McGuffin v. Schlumberger-Sangamo, \r\n  307 S.C. 184, 186, 414 S.E.2d 162, 163 (1992), the commission must, in keeping \r\n  with section 1-23-320, consider the evidence received before the single commissioner. \r\n  Accordingly, once the videotape was in evidence, the Full Commission should \r\n  have considered it. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe affirm the circuit court and the \r\n  commission with respect to Hendricks reaching MMI for his back on July 25, 1995, \r\n  and for his knee on December 11, 1995. We also affirm the Respondents' receipt \r\n  of a credit for any TTD benefits paid after the final MMI date and affirm the \r\n  finding pursuant to section 42-15-60 that Respondents are not liable for Hendricks's \r\n  medical treatment for his back after July 25, 1995. We reverse and reinstate \r\n  the Full Commission's finding of a 40% impairment to Hendricks's back. We remand \r\n  to the Full Commission the issue of Hendricks's potential entitlement to compensation \r\n  under the general disability statutes, and we direct the commission to consider \r\n  all the evidence in the record when developing its findings of fact regarding \r\n  this remanded issue. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN \r\n  PART, AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  At oral argument, \r\n  counsel for Respondents contended the following sentence in the single commissioner's \r\n  order denied Hendricks's claim for general disability compensation: \"That claimant's \r\n  temporary disability ended on December 11, 1995.\" We do not read this sentence \r\n  as addressing the general disability issue. \r\n2.  We take this \r\n  opportunity to clarify the difference between permanent disability payments \r\n  and temporary disability payments. The concepts of MMI and permanent impairment \r\n  are not mutually exclusive. Simply because a claimant suffers a permanent impairment \r\n  does not preclude him from reaching MMI. Smith v. South Carolina Dep't of \r\n  Mental Health, 329 S.C. 485, 495, 494 S.E.2d 630, 635 (Ct. App. 1997), citing \r\n  Swinton, 314 S.C. 202, 442 S.E.2d 215. Consequently, terminating temporary \r\n  total disability payments does not prevent a claimant from receiving permanent \r\n  total disability payments. \r\n  \r\n Essentially, worker's compensation \r\n  benefits accrue along a time continuum: TTD benefits are available from the \r\n  date of injury through the date of MMI and post-MMI benefits may be awarded \r\n  either as a permanent total or partial disability, or as a percentage of impairment \r\n  to a scheduled member. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 42-9-10, -20, -30 (1976); \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-260 (1996); 25A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 67-507 (1990) (repealed \r\n  by 21 S.C. Reg., No. 6, Part 2 at 439, effective June 27, 1997); O'Banner \r\n  v. Westinghouse, 319 S.C. 24, 27-8, 459 S.E.2d 324, 326 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  To require an employer to prove a claimant's disability ended before terminating \r\n  TTD benefits dilutes the distinction between temporary and permanent disability \r\n  payments, and it dilutes MMI as the definitive moment when a transition between \r\n  the two different types of payments is accomplished. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2989","title":"Coward Hund Construction Co. v.

Markey Stubbs, of Baker, Barwick, Ravenel \r\n          &amp; Bender, of Columbia, for respondents. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY, J.: Coward Hund Construction \r\n  Co., Inc., appeals the grant of summary judgment to Ball Corp. and Carolina \r\n  Glass Contractors, Inc. We dismiss the appeal. \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nCoward Hund sued Ball and Carolina \r\n  Glass alleging claims for negligence, breach of express and implied warranties, \r\n  breach of contract, and indemnification arising from allegedly defective building \r\n  repairs. Subsequently, Carolina Glass moved to dismiss the action, and Ball \r\n  Corp. moved for summary judgment. Carolina Glass's motion to dismiss was apparently \r\n  converted to a summary judgment motion without objection from Coward Hund. The \r\n  trial court heard oral argument on both summary judgment motions from all parties \r\n  to the action. \r\n  \r\nOn April 17, 1997, orders were filed \r\n  granting summary judgment to both defendants. The orders were served on Coward \r\n  Hund's attorney April 22, 1997. Coward Hund filed a motion for reconsideration \r\n  dated April 30, 1997. The trial court heard oral argument on the motion June \r\n  13, 1997, and issued an order denying the motion on June 20, 1997. Coward Hund \r\n  received that order July 10, 1997. \r\n  \r\nCoward Hund filed a second motion \r\n  for reconsideration \"seek[ing] clarification of the issue raised before the \r\n  trial court on two occasions regarding Plaintiff's indemnity claim against Defendants.\" \r\n  After a telephone conference, the trial court issued a supplemental order on \r\n  July 28, 1997, stating, \"the court granted summary judgment to Defendants Carolina \r\n  Glass and Ball Corp. without the court referencing any prejudice regarding Coward-Hund's \r\n  indemnity claims, if any.\" Coward Hund received this order August 4 or August \r\n  5, 1997, and served its notice of appeal September 2, 1997. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nRule 203(b)(1), SCACR, requires that \r\n  the notice of appeal be served on all respondents within thirty days after receipt \r\n  of written notice of entry of the order or judgment. The rule further provides, \r\n  however, that \"[w]hen a timely . . . motion to alter or amend the judgment \r\n  (Rules 52 and 59, SCRCP) . . . has been made, the time for appeal for all parties \r\n  shall be stayed and shall run from receipt of written notice of entry of the \r\n  order granting or denying such motion.\" (emphasis added). A motion under Rule \r\n  59(e) is timely if it is \"served not later than 10 days after receipt of written \r\n  notice of the entry of the order.\" If a timely motion is made pursuant to Rule \r\n  59, the time for appeal runs from the receipt of written notice of entry of \r\n  the order disposing of the motion. Rule 59(f), SCRCP. See Otten v. \r\n  Otten, 287 S.C. 166, 167, 337 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1985) (stating that when \r\n  a party makes a motion for reconsideration, \"the time for appeal from the judgment \r\n  begins to run from the time of the order granting or denying the motion\"). \r\n  \r\nHere, there is no dispute that Coward \r\n  Hund served its notice of appeal within 30 days after receiving the supplemental \r\n  order pursuant to its second motion for reconsideration, but more than 30 days \r\n  after receiving the order denying its first motion. The question before us, \r\n  then, is whether Coward Hund's second Rule 59 motion stayed the time for filing \r\n  its notice of appeal. Because there are no South Carolina cases directly on \r\n  point, we must look to the construction placed on the corresponding federal \r\n  rules of civil procedure. Gardner v. Newsome Chevrolet-Buick, Inc., 304 \r\n  S.C. 328, 404 S.E.2d 200 (1991). \r\n  \r\nWe agree with Ball Corp. that the \r\n  prevailing rule in the federal courts is that a second motion for reconsideration \r\n  is appropriate only if it challenges something that was altered from the original \r\n  judgment as a result of the initial motion for reconsideration. In such a case, \r\n  a new judgment has replaced the previous judgment and the party aggrieved by \r\n  the alteration may move for reconsideration. See 12 James W. Moore et \r\n  al., Moore's Federal Practice Â¶ 59.37 at 59-123 (3d ed. 1999) (\"When \r\n  a court alters a judgment, the party aggrieved by the alteration may ask for \r\n  correction.\"). If, on the other hand, the trial court denies such a motion, \r\n  the finality of the judgment is restored and the appeal time begins to run from \r\n  the date the order is entered. Id. Â¶ 59.36 at 59-123. \r\n  \r\nIn the case before us the trial court \r\n  denied Coward Hund's first motion for reconsideration. The finality of the summary \r\n  judgment orders, then, was restored, and Coward Hund's time for filing its notice \r\n  of appeal began to run upon its receipt of the order denying the motion. \r\n  \r\nCoward Hund asserts on reply that \r\n  its second motion was timely in that that motion sought clarification of the \r\n  trial court's first order on its initial Rule 59 motion. Coward Hund further \r\n  argues that because the trial court did not rule on whether its indemnity claims \r\n  were time-barred, it had no choice but to file the second motion to request \r\n  an express ruling on the matter in order to preserve it for appeal. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"The purpose of Rule 59(e), SCRCP, \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment[,] is to request the trial judge to 'reconsider \r\n  matters properly encompassed in a decision on the merits.'\" Arnold v. State, \r\n  309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992) (quoting Budinich v. Becton \r\n  Dickinson and Co., 486 U.S. 196, 200 (1988)). As one authority has noted, \r\n  \"Once the issue has been properly raised by a Rule 59(e) motion, it appears \r\n  that it is preserved and a second motion is not required if the trial court \r\n  does not specifically rule on the issue so raised.\" James F. Flanagan, South \r\n  Carolina Civil Procedure 475 (2d ed. 1996). \r\n  \r\nWe realize the second motion in this \r\n  case was not merely a successive request to revisit an issue that had already \r\n  been adjudicated in the first motion; nevertheless, the motion did not stay \r\n  the time for Coward Hund to file its notice of appeal. First, Coward Hund is \r\n  not challenging a new ruling in its second motion. See Pelican Bldg. \r\n  Ctrs. v. Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 60, 427 S.E.2d 673, 675 (1993) (stating that \r\n  although the appellant learned for the first time upon receiving the order on \r\n  a post-trial motion that the respondent would be granted certain additional \r\n  relief, the appellant must move under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend the \r\n  judgment to \"preserve the record for appeal\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSecond, we find this case distinguishable \r\n  from Payton v. Kearse, 319 S.C. 188, 460 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  rev'd on other grounds, 329 S.C. 51, 495 S.E.2d 205 (1998). In Payton, \r\n  this court declined to reach the issue of whether a juror's failure to make \r\n  certain disclosures tainted the proceedings, noting that the trial court failed \r\n  to mention or rule on this issue in its order denying the appellant's post-trial \r\n  motions and that the appellant did not request a ruling on the issue through \r\n  a subsequent Rule 59(e) motion. Unlike the issue of indemnification in the present \r\n  case, however, the issue of the juror's failure to respond truthfully to the \r\n  pertinent voir dire questions did not come before the trial court until after \r\n  the trial. It was at that time, then, that the trial court had its first opportunity \r\n  to pass on the issue and failed to do so. \r\n  \r\nFinally, we find Brown v. United \r\n  Ins. Co. of Am., 807 F.2d 1239 (5th Cir. 1987) is persuasive \r\n  in the resolution of this matter. In Brown the appellant, United Insurance, \r\n  filed a successful motion for clarification of the judgment after the trial \r\n  court had denied its timely post-trial motions. On the same day the motion for \r\n  clarification was filed, however, United Insurance also filed a timely notice \r\n  of appeal. Brown moved to dismiss the appeal, arguing the notice of the appeal \r\n  was rendered ineffective under Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(4) by the pendency of the \r\n  undisposed motion for clarification. In denying the motion to dismiss, the Fifth \r\n  Circuit Court of Appeals stated that the motion for clarification, \"even if \r\n  it be considered as substantively a motion to alter or amend the judgment under \r\n  Rule 59(e), was not timely.\" Id. at 1242. The court further reasoned \r\n  that the motion \"must be treated as [a motion] under Fed.R.Civ.P. 60(b) for \r\n  purposes of Rule 4(a)(4).\" Id. Because \"Rule 60(b) motions are not among \r\n  the motions referenced in the [pertinent section] of Rule 4(a)(4), and Rule \r\n  4(a)(4) does not vitiate a notice of appeal filed while a pending Rule 60(b) \r\n  motion remains undisposed of,\" the court held the motion for clarification did \r\n  not nullify either the notice of appeal or the jurisdiction of the appellate \r\n  court. Id. at 1242-43. \r\n  \r\nSimilarly, we hold that whether or \r\n  not Coward Hund needed to file a second post-trial motion to preserve its indemnification \r\n  claim for either appeal or future litigation, that motion is more appropriately \r\n  treated as a motion under Rule 60, SCRCP, and did not toll the time for the \r\n  filing and service of its notice of appeal. See Otten at 167, 337 S.E.2d \r\n  at 208 (stating a motion made under Rule 60(a), SCRCP, does not toll the running \r\n  of the time for appeal); 12 James W. Moore et al., Moore's Federal Practice \r\n  Â¶ 59.11[4][b] at 59-38 (3d ed. 1999) (\"Unlike timely Rule 59 motions, Rule 60 \r\n  motions do not have any tolling effect on the right to appeal from the challenged \r\n  judgment. Therefore, the time to appeal continues to run from the entry of the \r\n  judgment that the Rule 60(b) motion challenges.\"). \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and CONNOR, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2990","title":"Karen Joiner as Guardian Ad Litem for Robert Alex Rivas v.

We vacate and remand. \r\n  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\nThe facts of this case are largely \r\n  undisputed. The mother has a history of mental illness that is controllable \r\n  by medication. In 1993, the year Alex was born, the Department of Social Services \r\n  (DSS) initiated a case against the mother. Prior to that time and continuing \r\n  thereafter, the Lexington County Department of Mental Health was providing the \r\n  mother with mental health services and medication. \r\n  \r\nOn December 29, 1994, DSS received \r\n  a report from law enforcement that the mother's home was in disarray. A DSS \r\n  caseworker visited the home on January 6, 1995, found that it was in poor condition, \r\n  and requested that it be cleaned. A follow-up visit on January 19, 1995, found \r\n  no change. At that point, DSS assumed custody of Alex and the mother's other \r\n  children based on a determination that the children were in danger of physical \r\n  harm. That same day, the family court awarded emergency protective custody of \r\n  Alex to DSS. Shortly thereafter, on January 23, 1995, the court appointed Karen \r\n  Joiner, a volunteer with the South Carolina Guardian ad Litem program, as Alex's \r\n  guardian ad litem. \r\n  \r\nAfter a merits hearing, the family \r\n  court found Alex was physically neglected and continued DSS's custody of him. \r\n  DSS implemented a treatment plan for the mother based on her mental health problems. \r\n  On August 23, 1995, during the course of her treatment plan, the mother tested \r\n  positive for cocaine and marijuana. DSS then implemented a new treatment plan \r\n  that focused on the mother's drug abuse as well as her mental health problems. \r\n  At a judicial review in December of 1995, the court found that Alex continued \r\n  to be threatened with physical harm unless the mother successfully completed \r\n  the treatment plan. The court ordered the mother to receive drug counseling \r\n  and to refrain from drug use. \r\n  \r\nOn January 8, 1996, DSS referred \r\n  the mother to the Lancaster Recovery Center for out-patient evaluation. There, \r\n  the mother reported a ten year history of drug and alcohol use, and revealed \r\n  she had used crack cocaine daily during 1995 and had last used the drug on January \r\n  8, 1996. \r\n  \r\n Based on their assessment, Lancaster \r\n  Recovery recommended the mother enter Springs Memorial Hospital for three weeks \r\n  of treatment. The mother complied, and upon her release, Lancaster Recovery \r\n  referred her to the Lexington-Richland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council (LRADAC) \r\n  for continuing out-patient treatment. \r\n  \r\nThe mother began attending the LRADAC \r\n  program in March of 1996. Shortly thereafter, DSS allowed her unsupervised visitation \r\n  with Alex. Once the unsupervised visits began, the mother stopped regularly \r\n  attending LRADAC. On April 9, 1996, the mother called her DSS caseworker to \r\n  report she had relapsed and used cocaine on April 8, 1996. Sixteen days later, \r\n  on April 24, 1996, DSS returned Alex to the mother.(1) \r\n  \r\n \r\nOn June 10, 1996, after the mother \r\n  had failed to pick up Alex from his grandmother's and again had tested positive \r\n  for cocaine, DSS filed a complaint seeking an ex parte removal order. \r\n  The family court again determined Alex was in imminent danger of harm and awarded \r\n  emergency protective custody to DSS. The court again appointed Karen Joiner \r\n  as the child's guardian ad litem. The next day, the mother entered a new program \r\n  known as the Dual Diagnosis Day Treatment Program. This program was designed \r\n  to assist those diagnosed with both mental illness and chemical dependency. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn June 28, 1996, Karen Joiner, in \r\n  her capacity as guardian ad litem, commenced the instant action seeking termination \r\n  of the mother's parental rights to Alex. The mother answered and counterclaimed, \r\n  alleging: (1) she was pursuing a regular course of treatment for both her mental \r\n  illness and her drug addiction, (2) she had adhered to DSS's treatment plan, \r\n  (3) she had remained drug free since Alex was removed from her custody on June \r\n  10, and (4) she expected her mental health and drug addiction to improve significantly \r\n  in the near future such that she would, within a reasonable time, be able to \r\n  resume custody of Alex and provide him with adequate food, clothing, shelter, \r\n  education, health, and protection. \r\n  \r\nAfter a merits hearing on September \r\n  24, 1996, the family court issued its order terminating the mother's parental \r\n  rights. The court found that Alex had been removed from the mother's home pursuant \r\n  to South Carolina Code section 20-7-736, Alex had been out of the home for a \r\n  period exceeding six months, and despite reasonable and meaningful efforts by \r\n  DSS to offer appropriate rehabilitative services, the mother had not remedied \r\n  the conditions that caused Alex's removal.(2) \r\n  Thus, the court found termination was proper under South Carolina Code section \r\n  20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\nThe family court further found that \r\n  the mother suffered from the diagnosable conditions of mental illness and drug \r\n  addiction, and although her mental condition appeared to be under control, her \r\n  expected recovery from this double problem was \"far from guaranteed.\" In view \r\n  of the mother's past failed rehabilitative efforts, the court found the mother's \r\n  condition was unlikely to change within a reasonable time. Accordingly, the \r\n  court found termination also proper under Code section 20-7-1572(6). Finally, \r\n  the court held--given the age of the child, the length of time the child was \r\n  separated from the mother, the mother's lack of response to earlier treatment, \r\n  and the uncertainty of success of future treatment--the best interests of Alex \r\n  would be served by terminating the mother's parental rights. \r\n  \r\nThe mother's Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion \r\n  seeking reconsideration of the order was denied. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the mother asserts the \r\n  family court erred in failing to appoint an independent guardian ad litem for \r\n  Alex in the termination proceedings. We agree. \r\n  \r\nActions for termination of parental \r\n  rights are creatures of statute. Statutes providing for termination of parental \r\n  rights must be strictly construed in favor of preserving the relationship of \r\n  parent and child. Leone v. Dilullo, 294 S.C. 410, 413, 365 S.E.2d 39, \r\n  40 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Goff v. Benedict, 252 S.C. 83, 86-87, 165 \r\n  S.E.2d 269, 271 (1969)); Wilson v. Higgins, 294 S.C. 300, 304, 363 S.E.2d \r\n  911, 913-14 (Ct. App. 1987). South Carolina's statutory scheme for termination \r\n  of parental rights requires the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a child. \r\n  S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1570(B) (Supp. 1998) (\"A child subject to any judicial proceeding \r\n  under this subarticle must be appointed a guardian ad litem by the family court.\"). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough Ms. Joiner was appointed \r\n  as guardian ad litem for Alex in the initial DSS abuse and neglect action, her \r\n  role as a guardian was transformed when she filed this action to terminate the \r\n  mother's parental rights.(3) As the plaintiff \r\n  who had a stake in the outcome of the termination action, Ms. Joiner could not \r\n  simultaneously serve as a guardian for Alex. Although we have no doubt that \r\n  Ms. Joiner pursued this action because she believed it to be in Alex's best \r\n  interest, she could not function as both an advocate for the termination of \r\n  the mother's parental rights and as a guardian ad litem for Alex. \r\n  \r\nThe family court and this court on \r\n  appeal have a duty to guard zealously the rights of parties under legal disability. \r\n  See, e.g., Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina \r\n  69 (1999). Appellate courts have consistently exercised that duty, even where \r\n  the issue was procedurally barred or not even raised. See Ex parte \r\n  Roper, 254 S.C. 558, 563, 176 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1970) (\"[W]here the rights \r\n  and best interests of a minor child are concerned, the court may appropriately \r\n  raise, ex mero motu, issues not raised by the parties.\" (emphasis added)); \r\n  Galloway v. Galloway, 249 S.C. 157, 160, 153 S.E.2d 326, 327 (1967) (\"The \r\n  duty to protect the rights of minors has precedence over procedural rules otherwise \r\n  limiting the scope of review and matters affecting the rights of minors can \r\n  be considered by this court Ex mero motu.\" (emphasis added)); Caughman \r\n  v. Caughman, 247 S.C. 104, 109, 146 S.E.2d 93, 95 (1965) (\"[T]he duty to \r\n  protect the rights of incompetents has precedence over procedural rules otherwise \r\n  limiting the scope of review.\"); see also Prather v. Tupper, 267 \r\n  S.C. 636, 639-40, 230 S.E.2d 712, 713 (1976) (setting aside a determination \r\n  of illegitimacy where no guardian ad litem was appointed to represent the infant). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAn action to sever permanently the \r\n  parent-child relationship is one of the most serious actions entertained by \r\n  the family court or by this court on appeal.  See Greenville County \r\n  Dep't of Social Servs. v. Bowes, 313 S.C. 188, 194, 437 S.E.2d 107, 110 \r\n  (1993) (\"This Court cannot sanction the precipitous termination of parental \r\n  rights based on emotionally charged complaints not proved to the level of this \r\n  objective standard.\"); see also Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, \r\n  747-48 (1982) (\"Before a State may sever completely and irrevocably the rights \r\n  of parents in their natural child, due process requires that the State support \r\n  its allegations by at least clear and convincing evidence.\"). \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-7-1570(B) \r\n  mandates the appointment of a guardian ad litem for a child subject to a termination \r\n  action; failure to do so divests the court of jurisdiction to render a judgment. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. McDow, 276 S.C. 509, 511, 280 \r\n  S.E.2d 208, 209 (1981). Consequently, the order terminating the parental rights \r\n  of the mother must be vacated, and the case must be remanded for the appointment \r\n  of a guardian ad litem for Alex and a new termination hearing. See South \r\n  Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 558, 340 S.E.2d \r\n  149, 151-52 (1986) (Where the record did not show the family court complied \r\n  with the requirement to appoint counsel for an indigent parent in a termination \r\n  of parental rights action, the case was remanded to the family court.); McDow, \r\n  276 S.C. at 511, 280 S.E.2d at 209 (\"As no guardian ad litem was appointed to \r\n  represent [the father], we must vacate the order terminating his parental rights \r\n  and remand the case for the appointment of a guardian ad litem and a new termination \r\n  hearing.\"). \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAlthough the issue of appointment \r\n  of a guardian ad litem was not raised to the trial judge, we nevertheless hold \r\n  that preservation of error rules should be relaxed because the rights of a minor \r\n  are involved. The failure to appoint a guardian ad litem in a termination of \r\n  parental rights action is such a fundamental error that a new trial is required.(4) \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the family court is \r\n  \r\nVACATED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR, JJ., concurs. \r\nHUFF, JJ., dissents in a separate \r\n  opinion. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHUFF, J., dissenting: \r\n  I respectfully dissent. \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, the mother argues that \r\n  clear and convincing evidence does not support termination of her parental rights \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) because Alex had not lived outside \r\n  her home for a period of six consecutive months immediately proceeding the termination. \r\n  Because this issue was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the trial court, \r\n  it may not be considered on appeal. See South Carolina Department of Social \r\n  Services v. Father and Mother, 294 S.C. 518, 366 S.E.2d 40 (Ct. App. 1988) \r\n  (issue which was not raised below cannot be considered on appeal); Wilder \r\n  Corporation v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998) (issue cannot be \r\n  raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review). \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\nThe mother also asserts the family \r\n  court erred in determining she had not remedied the conditions which caused \r\n  Alex's removal pursuant to Â§ 20-7-1572(2). I disagree. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (1985) \r\n  provided at the time of the hearing that the family court may order termination \r\n  of parental rights where: \r\n  \r\nThe child has been removed from the \r\n  parent pursuant to Â§ 20-7-736, has been out of the home for a period of six \r\n  months, and despite a reasonable and meaningful effort by the agency to offer \r\n  appropriate rehabilitative services, the parent has not remedied the conditions \r\n  which caused the removal. \r\n  \r\nIt is well established that grounds \r\n  for termination of parental rights must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. \r\n  Richland County Department of Social Services v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, \r\n  496 S.E.2d 864 (1998). In reviewing a termination of parental rights, this court \r\n  has authority to review the record and make our own findings of whether clear \r\n  and convincing evidence supports the termination. Id. \r\n \r\nThe mother would have this court \r\n  hold that she has \"remedied\" her drug addiction problem because she has \"been \r\n  drug-free since June 8, 1996.\" Although the record shows a short period of progress \r\n  by the mother in her latest treatment, the mother has a history of relapses \r\n  and failure to follow through with treatment. It is undisputed the mother tested \r\n  positive for cocaine in April, May, \r\n  \r\nand June of 1996, while she was undergoing \r\n  drug rehabilitation treatment. The record further reveals the mother has a history \r\n  of failing to follow through with treatment programs, as evidenced by her failure \r\n  to attend LRADAC sessions when Alex was returned to her, and her failure to \r\n  follow through with the Lancaster Recovery intensive step program after the \r\n  May 1996 positive drug test. I find clear and convincing evidence the mother \r\n  has not remedied the conditions which caused removal. \r\n  \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\nNext, the mother asserts the family \r\n  court erred in finding clear and convincing evidence that termination of her \r\n  parental rights was appropriate under Â§ 20-7-1572(6). Specifically, she argues \r\n  the evidence shows there has already been a change in her \"diagnosable condition.\" \r\n  I disagree. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6) (1985) \r\n  provides in part that the family court may order termination of parental rights \r\n  upon a finding that: \r\n  \r\nThe parent has a diagnosable condition \r\n  unlikely to change within a reasonable time such as alcohol or drug addiction \r\n  . . . and the condition makes the parent unlikely to provide minimally acceptable \r\n  care for the child. \r\n  \r\nIn determining the mother's drug \r\n  addiction was unlikely to change within a reasonable time, the family court \r\n  considered the testimony of Penny Thorne, a certified addictions counselor with \r\n  the dual diagnosis program. Thorne testified the program was designed to move \r\n  along carefully and slowly so as to avoid a setback. Because the program was \r\n  new, no one had yet completed it, but she anticipated client participation in \r\n  the program to be from six to nine months. The mother started the program in \r\n  June 1996 and therefore would not be expected to complete the program until \r\n  sometime between December of 1996 and March of 1997. Further, Thorne admitted \r\n  that even if the mother successfully completed the program, there was no guarantee \r\n  she would, at that time, be able to provide proper parental care for Alex. Thorne \r\n  also admitted that the projected success rate of the dual diagnosis program \r\n  was far less than 30%. In addition to Thorne's testimony, the family court considered \r\n  evidence of the mothers's failure to respond to previous drug rehabilitation \r\n  efforts. I agree with the family court that these considerations, together with \r\n  Alex's young age and the level of care and responsibility commensurate with \r\n  providing care for a young child, constitute clear and convincing evidence that \r\n  the mother's drug addiction is unlikely to change within a reasonable amount \r\n  of time such that she can be expected to provide the child with minimally acceptable \r\n  care. \r\n  \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\nThe mother next asserts this court \r\n  should reverse and vacate the termination order because the family court refused \r\n  to allow her sufficient time to complete the dual diagnosis program in which \r\n  she was enrolled at the time of trial. In support of this contention, the mother \r\n  directs this court's attention to the holding in South Carolina Department \r\n  of Social Services v. Smith, 311 S.C. 426, 429 S.E.2d 807 (1993). \r\n  \r\nIn Smith, the family court \r\n  terminated the parental rights of two mildly retarded parents pursuant to Â§ \r\n  20-7-1572(6). The Supreme Court reversed, holding that clear and convincing \r\n  evidence did not support termination of parental rights under Â§ 20-7-1572(6) \r\n  where (1) the parents had been accepted into a program designed to educate mentally \r\n  retarded persons in parenting skills, family planning, and sexuality, and (2) \r\n  DSS's own witness, a clinical psychologist, testified the parents could benefit \r\n  from the program and should be given the opportunity to do so. \r\n  \r\nThe facts of this case are clearly \r\n  distinguishable from those before the Court in Smith. In Smith, \r\n  due to the parents' mental retardation, no treatment plan or rehabilitation \r\n  plan was proposed by DSS. In the instant case, however, the mother had already \r\n  been offered and participated in drug rehabilitative services and had established \r\n  a history of relapsing into drug use despite treatment. Moreover, the potential \r\n  benefit of the dual diagnosis program is questionable given the low projected \r\n  rate of success as established at trial. Finally, the Smith court established \r\n  a \"reasonable time\" limit of no more than one year from the date the parents \r\n  were accepted into the program, for the family court to reconsider termination \r\n  of parental rights. Here, after learning of the mother's positive drug test \r\n  in August 1995, DSS implemented a new treatment plan, which included treatment \r\n  for drug and alcohol problems. Thus, the mother had already been in drug rehabilitation \r\n  treatment for approximately one year at the time of the September 1996 trial \r\n  of this case. My reading of Smith does not convince me that the Supreme \r\n  Court intended that every parent facing termination of parental rights pursuant \r\n  to Â§ 20-7-1572(6), regardless of that parent's treatment history, be granted \r\n  time to complete every treatment program the parent enters. Such a reading would \r\n  lead to absurd results. Indeed, a parent could avoid termination indefinitely \r\n  by simply enrolling in one treatment program after another. \r\n  \r\nV. \r\n  \r\nFinally, the mother asserts the family \r\n  court erred in failing to appoint an independent guardian ad litem for Alex \r\n  in the termination proceedings. As with the first issue, this argument is made \r\n  for the first time on appeal. It was neither raised to nor ruled upon by the \r\n  trial court and therefore is not preserved for our review. See South Carolina \r\n  Department of Social Services v. Father and Mother, 294 S.C. 518, 366 S.E.2d \r\n  40 (Ct. App. 1988) (issue which was not raised below cannot be considered on \r\n  appeal);Wilder Corporation v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731 (1998) \r\n  (issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised \r\n  to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, I would affirm the order \r\n  of the family court. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  It is undisputed \r\n  that proper procedure was not followed in this case and that Alex was returned \r\n  to the mother against DSS policy. \r\n2.  While noting \r\n  the mother's illegal drug use had not been the original cause for Alex's removal, \r\n  the court found Alex was not returned to the home after the mother's mental \r\n  condition stabilized because of the ensuing drug use. Accordingly, the court \r\n  found, for purposes of section 20-7-1572(2), Alex was \"removed\" because of the \r\n  mother's use of drugs, and her continuing use of drugs despite treatment efforts \r\n  was sufficient to terminate her parental rights. \r\n3.  Ms. Joinerâ€™s \r\n  standing to pursue an action to terminate parental rights has not been challenged. \r\n  See In re Lyde, 284 S.C. 419, 421-22, 327 S.E.2d 70, 71 (1985) (An action to \r\n  terminate parental rights need not be initiated by DSS but may be brought by \r\n  any interested party.); Department of Social Servs. v. Pritchett, 296 S.C. 517, \r\n  520, 374 S.E.2d 500, 501-02 (Ct. App. 1988) (Foster parents have standing to \r\n  bring a termination action.). \r\n4.  We agree with \r\n  the dissent's resolution of the other exceptions raised by Appellant. However, \r\n  based on our disposition of this issue, we have not reached the merits of those \r\n  arguments. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2991","title":"Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P. v.

The master found that Roy Smith and Barbara Smith defaulted \r\n  on a note held by Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P. The master awarded Twelfth $1,002,421.86 \r\n  in damages, including attorney fees. The Smiths appeal the decision. We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nNational Safe Corporation borrowed \r\n  $300,000.00 and $200,000.00 from Pioneer Savings Bank (Pioneer). Pioneer combined \r\n  these two notes and formed a renewal line of credit for $500,000.00. Mr. Smith \r\n  signed the note as president of National Safe Corporation. Mr. and Mrs. Smith \r\n  each signed an unconditional Guarantee of Payment and Performance that guaranteed \r\n  payment of the note. Shortly thereafter, the United States government closed \r\n  Pioneer as a result of the savings and loan crisis and appointed the Resolution \r\n  Trust Corporation (RTC) as receiver. RTC then assigned the note and guarantee \r\n  to Twelfth on November 15, 1994. National Safe Company filed for bankruptcy \r\n  in December, 1996. \r\n  \r\nR.M.A. Partners, L.P., sued the Smiths \r\n  for the balance on the notes in June, 1995. R.M.A. Partners filed a motion for \r\n  summary judgment, but the master denied it because of uncertainty as to the \r\n  identity of the proper plaintiff. The master heard the case on August 13, 1997. \r\n  On the day of trial, R.M.A. Partners made a motion to substitute Twelfth R.M.A. \r\n  Partners, L.P., (Twelfth) as the appropriate plaintiff. The master granted this \r\n  motion over the Smiths' objection. \r\n  \r\nDuring the trial, the master allowed \r\n  the testimony of Judy Every, a portfolio manager with Twelfth, over the Smiths' \r\n  objection that her testimony was hearsay. The master found that the Smiths had \r\n  defaulted on the loan, that Twelfth was the holder of the note, and that the \r\n  Smiths owed $484,010.27 in principal, $10,798.00 in late charges, $504,113.59 \r\n  in interest, and $3,500.00 in attorney fees. The Smiths appeal. \r\n  \r\nISSUES ON APPEAL \r\n  \r\n\r\n  Is the lawsuit barred by South \r\n    Carolina's three-year statute of limitations, or does the federal six-year \r\n    statute of limitations apply?\r\n\r\n  \r\n   \r\n  Is the lawsuit barred by the equitable \r\n    doctrine of laches? \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the substitution of Twelfth \r\n    as plaintiff on the day of trial unduly prejudice the Smiths?\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the master err in allowing \r\n    the testimony of Judy Ray Every?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThis case is an action at law that \r\n  was referred to the master-in-equity with direct appeal to the supreme court. \r\n  The appellate court will correct any errors of law, but it must affirm the master's \r\n  factual findings unless no evidence exists that reasonably supports those findings. \r\n  Jefferies v. Phillips, 316 S.C. 523, 451 S.E.2d 21 (Ct. App. 1994). \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(1) Statute of Limitations \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths argue the master incorrectly \r\n  applied the six-year statute of limitations found in the Financial Institutions \r\n  Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of 1989 (FIRREA), 12 U.S.C. Â§ 1821(d)(14), \r\n  instead of applying the South Carolina three-year statute of limitations. S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§15-3-530 (Supp. 1997). We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe relevant language in the FIRREA \r\n  is found in 12 U.S.C. Â§ 1821(d)(14)(A): \r\n\r\n  Statute of limitations for actions \r\n    brought by conservator or receiver \r\n     \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    In general  \r\n  \r\n\r\nNotwithstanding any provision of \r\n  any contract, the applicable statute of limitations with regard to any action \r\n  brought by the Corporation [i.e., the FDIC] as conservator or receiver shall \r\n  be - \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        in the case of any contract \r\n        claim, the longer of -\r\n        \r\n        (I) the 6-year period beginning on \r\n  the date the claim accrues; or \r\n        (II) the period applicable under \r\n  state law.\r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe statute mentions \"the Corporation,\" \r\n  which has been defined in the statute as the FDIC. FIRREA gives the RTC the \r\n  same rights and powers as the FDIC. 12 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1441a(b)(4)(A). The statute, \r\n            however, is silent as to its applicability to the assignees of the RTC. The \r\n            Smiths argue that this silence means the court must apply the three-year statute \r\n            of limitations. Twelfth argues that the law of assignments, or alternatively, \r\n            the UCC, should determine which statute applies. \r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, it is well established \r\n  that an \"assignee . . . stands in the shoes of its assignor . . .\" Singletary \r\n  v. Aetna Cas. &amp; Sur. Co., 316 S.C. 199, 201, 447 S.E.2d 869, 870 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1994). When a contract is assigned, the assignee should have all the same \r\n  rights and privileges, including the right to sue on the contract, as the assignor. \r\n  Under the UCC in South Carolina, a \"[t]ransfer of an instrument vests in the \r\n  transferee such rights as the transferor has therein.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-3-201 \r\n  (1976). \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths argue that the right in \r\n  question, the RTC's right to sue under the six year statute of limitations, \r\n  would not transfer to Twelfth. They cite Wamco, III, Ltd. v. First Piedmont \r\n  Mortg. Corp., 856 F.Supp. 1076 (E.D. Va. 1994) for the proposition that \r\n  the statute confers a personal benefit, or right, onto the RTC that would not \r\n  transfer to an assignee. \r\n  \r\nWamco, however, is against \r\n  the weight of authorities, as the case itself points out. Also, the Virginia \r\n  Supreme Court refused to follow the Wamco decision and held that the \r\n  right to sue under the six-year statute of limitations is not a personal benefit \r\n  or right. The court further stated \"the receiver's right to sue within the statute \r\n  of limitations period is inherent in its possession of the instruments at issue \r\n  and would thus be among the 'rights, remedies and benefits which are incidental \r\n  to the thing assigned,' and not merely a right 'personal to the assignor and \r\n  for [its] benefit only.'\" Union Recovery Ltd. Partnership v. Horton, \r\n  477 S.E.2d 521, 524 (Va. 1996). \r\n  \r\nThe majority of state and federal \r\n  courts have interpreted the federal statute to grant to the assignee a six-year \r\n  statute of limitations. See, e.g., FDIC v. Bledsoe, 989 F.2d 805 \r\n  (5th Cir. 1993); N.S.Q. Associates v. Beychok, 659 So.2d 729 \r\n  (La. 1995); Tivoli Ventures, Inc. v. Bumann, 870 P.2d 1244 (Colo. 1994) \r\n  (en banc); Investment Co. of the Southwest v. Reese, 875 P.2d 1086 (N.M. \r\n  1994); Jackson v. Thweatt, 883 S.W.2d 171 (Tex. 1994). \r\n  \r\nWe agree that the right to sue under \r\n  the six-year statute of limitations is not personal to the RTC, but is available \r\n  to all assignees or transferees of the RTC. The claim brought by Twelfth, therefore, \r\nis not barred by the statute of limitations.\r\n(2) Laches \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths next argue that laches \r\n  should bar Twelfth from using the extended federal statute of limitations. We \r\n  disagree. Laches is an equitable doctrine consisting of the elements of (1) \r\n  a delay (2) that is unreasonable and (3) that causes prejudice. Terry v. \r\n  Lee, 314 S.C. 420, 445 S.E.2d 435 (1994). Laches within the period of the \r\n  statute of limitations is no defense at law. Crotwell v. Whitney, 229 \r\n  S.C. 213, 92 S.E.2d 473 (1956) (citations omitted). We conclude the Smiths have \r\n  not shown the requisite unreasonable delay since the action was within the statute \r\n  of limitations period. \r\n  \r\n(3) Substitution of Plaintiff \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths next argue that the substitution \r\n  of Twelfth RMA Partners, L.P., for RMA Partners, L.P., unduly prejudiced them. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nRule 15, SCRCP, provides that the \r\n  complaint may only be amended by leave of the court and \"leave to amend shall \r\n  be freely given when justice requires and does not prejudice any other party.\" \r\n  A motion to amend is within the sound discretion of the trial judge and the \r\n  opposing party has the burden of establishing prejudice. Foggie v. CSX Transp., \r\n  Inc., 315 S.C. 17, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993). \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths rely on Valentine v. \r\n  Davis, 319 S.C. 169, 460 S.E.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1997) for the proposition \r\n  that a plaintiff may not add a new plaintiff to a case to assert a claim against \r\n  the defendant. In this case, however, no new claims are being added. The court \r\n  is only changing the name of the plaintiff. The subject of the claim, the underlying \r\n  note on which the Smiths defaulted, is still the same. \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths also argue that the case \r\n  was not brought in the name of the real party in interest and should be dismissed \r\n  under Rule 17, SCRCP. The Smiths have not shown any prejudice. The trial court \r\n  substituted the real party in interest, as Rule 17, SCRCP, expressly allows. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(4) Ms. Every's Testimony \r\n  \r\nFinally, the Smiths argue that the \r\n  master should not have allowed the testimony of Judy Every. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nFirst, they base this argument on \r\n  the fact that she did not take an oath prior to giving the testimony. The record \r\n  shows that no oath was given prior to Every's testimony. The record also shows, \r\n  however, that the Smiths did not object. \"The admission of unsworn testimony \r\n  in a case is a mere irregularity which violates no constitutional provision, \r\n  and does not affect the jurisdiction of the tribunal, and if unsworn testimony \r\n  is received into evidence without objection, it may be considered the same as \r\n  any other evidence in the case.\" 98 C.J.S. Witnesses Â§ 320, at 22 (1957). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths also argue that the master \r\n  erred in allowing the testimony because it was hearsay. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe master allowed the testimony \r\n  under the business records exception to the hearsay rule. The business records \r\n  exception is found in both the South Carolina Code at Â§ 19-5-510 (1985) and \r\n  Rule 803(6) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence. Both exceptions require \r\n  that the evidence be given by a \"custodian or other qualified witness.\" Ms. \r\n  Every testified that the records about which she testified were part of her \r\n  file that she maintained in Twelfth's regular course of business. \r\n  \r\nThe Smiths argue, however, that she \r\n  was not the custodian \"at or near the time\" the records were made. Here, Ms. \r\n  Every's testimony merely conveyed information from a person \"with knowledge\" \r\n  at the time the records were created, a situation expressly allowed under Rule \r\n  803(6). \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHOWELL, C.J., and CONNOR, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n1.  Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2992","title":"Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc. et al. v.

The trial court \r\n  granted partial summary judgment to Merrill Lynch declaring certain claims were \r\n  ineligible for arbitration. The trial court also dismissed the surviving claims \r\n  to arbitration. Merrill Lynch and Havird appeal. We reverse and remand. \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nIn 1981, Havird opened an individual \r\n  securities account with Merrill Lynch. Long serviced Havird's account. According \r\n  to Havird, she specifically informed Merrill Lynch that she needed and desired \r\n  to preserve the principal in her accounts, that her most important priority \r\n  was security, and that her investment principal must remain safe. Havird emphasized \r\n  that she wanted to preserve the principal because it was her primary source \r\n  of retirement funds. Nevertheless, Long invested a large portion of Havird's \r\n  principal in limited partnerships which Havird alleges were speculative, high \r\n  risk, and low quality. When Havird questioned Long about a decrease in the value \r\n  of the limited partnerships, Long \"repeatedly and continually reassured me that \r\n  the investments were both fine and suitable, that these investments were 'the \r\n  perfect thing for me,' that I was not to worry, that 'we're expecting it to \r\n  go back up' in value, and that he continued to act in my best interest.\" \r\n  \r\nIn September, 1993, an out-of-state \r\n  law firm contacted Havird about a potential problem with one of the limited \r\n  partnerships. After investigating the information she received, Havird made \r\n  a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association (AAA) on \r\n  September 30, 1993, alleging stockbroker fraud. Merrill Lynch notified Havird \r\n  that it did not agree to arbitrate before the AAA. \r\n  \r\nIn March, 1994, Havird arranged for \r\n  her AAA claim to be transferred to the National Association of Securities Dealers \r\n  (NASD). She alleged that Long \"invested a large portion of the principal of \r\n  [her] accounts in very speculative, high risk, low quality investments, including \r\n  limited partnerships.\" She claimed the value of her accounts had decreased substantially \r\n  because of these poor investments. \r\n  \r\nOn September 12, 1994, Merrill Lynch \r\n  commenced this action seeking a declaration that Havird's claims were ineligible \r\n  for arbitration because her claims arose more than 6 years prior to her arbitration \r\n  claim. Section 15 of the NASD Code of Arbitration Procedure provides: \r\n  \r\nNo dispute, claim, or controversy \r\n  shall be eligible for submission to arbitration under this Code where six (6) \r\n  years have elapsed from the occurrence or event giving rise to the act or dispute, \r\n  claim, or controversy. This section shall not extend applicable statutes of \r\n  limitations, nor shall it apply to any case which is directed to arbitration \r\n  by a court of competent jurisdiction. \r\n  \r\nHavird answered the action brought \r\n  by Merrill Lynch, denying her claims were ineligible for arbitration and pleading \r\n  counterclaims asserting Merrill Lynch violated a fiduciary duty and a continuing \r\n  duty to assure Havird's investments met her needs. On February 28, 1996, Merrill \r\n  Lynch filed a motion for summary judgment. The motion included a request to \r\n  dismiss Havird's counterclaims because Havird agreed to arbitrate them. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court granted Merrill Lynch's \r\n  summary judgment motion as to claims arising prior to March 4, 1988, six years \r\n  before Havird filed her demand for arbitration with the NASD. The trial court \r\n  dismissed the remaining claims to arbitration. Merrill Lynch and Havird both \r\n  appeal. \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\nHavird contends the trial court erred \r\n  in deciding on the eligibility of her claims for arbitration. According to Havird, \r\n  that determination was for the arbitrator. We agree. \r\n  \r\nThe United States Supreme Court recently \r\n  discussed who should determine arbitrability of claims in First Options of \r\n  Chicago, Inc. v. Kaplan, 514 U.S. 938 (1995). The Kaplan Court stated \r\n  that the arbitration agreement determines whether an arbitrator or a court decides \r\n  on the arbitrability of a claim. Id. at 943. The determination of arbitrability \r\n  is for the arbitrator only if the contract, when viewed in light of the ordinary \r\n  state rules of contract construction, clearly evinces an intent for the arbitrator \r\n  to make the decision. Id. If no such intent can reasonably be gleaned \r\n  from the arbitration agreement, then the court decides the issue of arbitrability \r\n  under established legal principals. Id. As the court stated it: \r\n  \r\n[T]he basic objective in this area \r\n  is not to resolve disputes in the quickest manner possible, no matter what the \r\n  parties' wishes, . . . but to ensure that commercial arbitration agreements, \r\n  like other contracts, \"'are enforced according to their terms.'\" \r\n  \r\nId. at 947 (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe intent of the parties is to be \r\n  determined solely from the language of a contract, if that language is clear \r\n  and unambiguous. Wood v. Maggies Tavern, Inc., 683 N.Y.S.2d 353 (App. \r\n  Div. 1999).(1) A court should give the terms \r\n  of an unambiguous contract their plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. Id. \r\n  at 355. \r\n  \r\nIn the present case, the agreement \r\n  to arbitrate states: \"It is agreed that any controversy between us . . . shall \r\n  be submitted to arbitration . . . .\" The parties further agreed that any arbitration \r\n  proceeding should be \"conducted . . . pursuant to the Code of Arbitration Procedure \r\n  of the [NASD].\" Section 35 of the NASD Code (now Rule 10324 of the Code) provides: \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe arbitrators shall be empowered \r\n  to interpret and determine the applicability of all provisions under \r\n  this Code and to take appropriate action to obtain compliance with any rulings \r\n  by the arbitrator(s). Such interpretations and actions to obtain compliance \r\n  shall be final and binding upon the parties. \r\n  \r\nNational Association of Securities \r\n  Dealers, Inc., Code of Arbitration Procedure, NASD Manual &amp; Notices to Members \r\n  Â¶ 10324 (1998) (emphasis added). The arbitration agreement in question clearly \r\n  and unambiguously prescribes that the arbitrator is to decide the applicability \r\n  of the provisions of the NASD Code. We hold this includes the six-year arbitrability \r\n  limit contained in Section 15. The trial court therefore erred to the extent \r\n  it addressed any issues of arbitrability. Conroy v. Merrill Lynch, 899 \r\n  F.Supp. 1471, 1476 (W.D.N.C. 1995); Smith Barney Shearson v. Sacharow, \r\n  689 N.E.2d 884, 888 (N.Y. 1997); Smith Barney, Inc. v. Bardolph, 509 \r\n  S.E.2d 255, 259 (N.C. App. 1998). \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\nBecause we have determined the parties \r\n  agreed the issue of arbitrability of claims was for the arbitrator to decide, \r\n  we need not address the other issues raised by the parties. We therefore reverse \r\n  the grant of summary judgment and remand to the trial court for entry of an \r\n  order dismissing all claims to arbitration. \r\n \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HEARN, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  It is undisputed \r\n  that the transactions involved here involve interstate commerce. As such, federal \r\n  arbitration law applies. Trident Technical College v.

There is no general federal contract law, however, so state law \r\n  applies to contract construction. Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S. 483, 493 \r\n  n.9 (1987). The trial court concluded that New York law applies to the agreement \r\n  here. This conclusion was not contested on appeal, so it stands as the law of \r\n  the case. See Lindsay v.

The child and her mother, who is Bray's sister, often \r\n  spent weekends at the child's maternal grandmother's home in 1995 and early \r\n  1996. Bray lived in the grandmother's home. \r\n  \r\nThe child, who was five at the time \r\n  of the alleged abuse and seven at the time of trial, testified that she often \r\n  played with Bray in his room when she stayed at her grandmother's house. The \r\n  child's mother stated her daughter loved to play with Bray in his room, that \r\n  they would often play until bedtime, that Bray's door would be closed while \r\n  they played, and that sometimes it would be locked. \r\n  \r\nThe child testified that Bray touched \r\n  her in a bad way. She testified he touched her \"pee pee\" and her \"bottom\" with \r\n  his finger and his tongue, and Bray had her rub his \"front private.\" She stated \r\n  she wet her hands in the bathroom adjoining Bray's bedroom and would then rub \r\n  his penis. She testified that \"we had to keep on doing it and doing it and doing \r\n  it until this white stuff came out.\" Afterward, she remembers Bray wiped the \r\n  \"white stuff\" onto a clean t-shirt. \r\n  \r\nBray admitted owning three pornographic \r\n  magazines. The child testified he showed her the magazines, and she remembered \r\n  seeing \"white stuff\" on one woman's belly. Bray, on the other hand, testified \r\n  that the child was naturally inquisitive and would \"go through about anything \r\n  she wanted to go through.\" One day he entered his bedroom and found her looking \r\n  at the magazines, which he kept under his bed. He attempted to answer the child's \r\n  questions about the pictures, including a question about the \"white stuff,\" \r\n  and hoped that would end the situation. He knew there would be trouble if the \r\n  child's grandmother discovered he had pornographic magazines in the house. \r\n  \r\nThe child did not tell anyone for \r\n  some time about the \"secret\" she had with Bray, so the exact dates of the alleged \r\n  abuse are unknown. She testified she told her grandmother, who did not take \r\n  any action.(1) Soon thereafter, she told her \r\n  parents about seeing photographs of undressed people in magazines and asked \r\n  them, \"What is having sex?\" Her mother was immediately concerned and took the \r\n  child to counseling to determine whether she was a victim of sexual abuse. \r\n  \r\nThe child was initially seen by a \r\n  counselor on March 28, 1996. After one meeting, the counselor suggested the \r\n  child be evaluated at the Lowcountry Children's Center (\"LCC\") in Charleston. \r\n  During a forensic interview with a therapist at LCC on April 2, 1996, the child \r\n  first stated Bray had touched her \"privates\" and she touched his while at her \r\n  grandmother's house. Based upon that interview, LCC made a police report of \r\n  sexual abuse. A medical examination at LCC on April 2 was inconclusive. \r\n  \r\nBray was indicted on one count of \r\n  first degree criminal sexual conduct. The trial judge held an in camera \r\n  hearing to decide whether the child should testify via closed circuit television \r\n  (\"CCTV\"). After taking testimony from the child's therapist and the child's \r\n  mother, but without interviewing the child herself, the trial judge allowed \r\n  the CCTV testimony over defense objections. The jury returned a guilty verdict, \r\n  and the trial court sentenced Bray to thirty years imprisonment. The court provided \r\n  that upon service of seven years the remainder of the sentence would be suspended \r\n  and that Bray would be placed on probation for five years.  This appeal \r\n  followed. \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nBray argues the trial court failed \r\n  to comply with the procedures set forth in State v. Murrell, 302 S.C. \r\n  77, 393 S.E.2d 919 (1990), and its progeny and thus violated his constitutional \r\n  right to confront the witnesses against him. He complains the trial court's \r\n  factual finding regarding the necessity for the child to testify via CCTV was \r\n  not supported by sufficient evidence. We agree. \r\n  \r\nIn Murrell, our supreme court \r\n  described the procedure to be followed by trial courts in invoking South Carolina \r\n  Code section 16-3-1550(E) (Supp. 1998),(2) to \r\n  protect child witnesses. This subsection concerns the need to treat certain \r\n  witnesses, including the very young, sensitively and allows closed or taped \r\n  testimony when appropriate. The court in Murrell explained the guidelines \r\n  to be followed: \r\n  \r\nFirst, the trial judge must make \r\n  a case-specific determination of the need for videotaped testimony. In making \r\n  this determination, the trial court should consider the testimony of an expert \r\n  witness, parents or other relatives, other concerned and relevant parties, and \r\n  the child. Second, the court should place the child in as close to a courtroom \r\n  setting as possible. Third, the defendant should be able to see and hear the \r\n  child, should have counsel present both in the courtroom and with him, and communication \r\n  should be available between counsel and appellant. \r\n  \r\nId. at 80-81, 393 S.E.2d at \r\n  921 (footnote omitted). A trial court's decision to allow testimony via CCTV \r\n  may be reversed only upon a showing that the trial court abused its discretion \r\n  in making the decision or in implementing the appropriate procedure once the \r\n  decision has been made. Id. at 82, 393 S.E.2d at 922. \r\n  \r\nThe first prong of the Murrell \r\n  test requires a case-specific factual inquiry into the necessity for the child \r\n  to testify via CCTV. The evidence supporting a finding of the need for CCTV \r\n  or videotaped testimony must be more than de minimis. State v. Lewis, \r\n  324 S.C. 539, 545, 478 S.E.2d 861, 864 (Ct. App. 1996), cert. denied, \r\n  (June 5, 1997). \r\n  \r\nDuring the hearing to consider whether \r\n  to allow the child to testify outside Bray's presence, the State offered testimony \r\n  from the child's therapist, Kim Charpia, who had seen the child eight times. \r\n  When asked whether the child would be able to testify in open court in front \r\n  of Bray, Charpia stated: \r\n  \r\nI think in general it would be difficult \r\n  for her to be in here with all these adults. I mean, I'm an adult and this is \r\n  intimidating to me. But I think in particular she would be facing her uncle, \r\n  a family member, and grandparents, and they have not believed her statement. \r\n  I think she will shut down and not talk at all. I think she would be overwhelmed \r\n  and intimidated and probably unable to talk with anybody. \r\n  \r\nWhen asked whether it would further \r\n  traumatize the child to testify in front of Bray, Charpia responded: \r\n  \r\nI think it would not be empowering. \r\n  I think it would be further depressing because I think she would -- the fear \r\n  and intimidation of this place, I think you wouldn't get any statement from \r\n  her, and I think it would further depress the whole situation. . . . I think \r\n  it would be empowering if she could talk to a judge and jury and the lawyers, \r\n  of course, about what happened, but if she was to face the family members and \r\n  they were -- I mean, this is her uncle and grandmother and other extending [sic] \r\n  family that they really have not seen to any degree since this happened -- I \r\n  think she would not talk about this. \r\n  \r\nThe child's mother testified that \r\n  \"because of [the child's] age and her mental ability to understand what's going \r\n  on, I just don't think that it would be appropriate for her to come in here \r\n  and face a lot of people that she doesn't know who they are.\" The mother also \r\n  stated that if the child were in the same room with Bray \"she might feel intimidated \r\n  by him.\" When asked what her basis was for feeling the child would be intimidated \r\n  by Bray, the mother replied, \"Because I'm her mother and I think I know what's \r\n  best.\" \r\n  \r\nIn ruling the child would be permitted \r\n  to testify outside Bray's presence, the trial court announced: \r\n  \r\nI think this is probably a classic \r\n  case of why that last part of 16-3-1530, I think, was passed. We've got a young \r\n  child who it's alleged has been molested at the age of five and who is seven \r\n  years of age now. We've got testimony from the mother and the expert which shows \r\n  that except for the mother, at least as far as I know it right now, the rest \r\n  of the family don't believe her. And so I think that's classic. That would -- \r\n  to me would be a classic situation as to why it would be passed. \r\n  \r\nSignificantly, the trial judge did \r\n  not personally interview the child about the possibility of testifying in front \r\n  of Bray despite the supreme court's suggestion to do so in this type of case. \r\n  Murrell, 302 S.C. at 81 n.2, 393 S.E.2d at 921 n.2. \r\n  \r\nIn Murrell, the trial judge \r\n  did not interview the child, but did take testimony from the child's mother, \r\n  aunt, and an expert, all of whom testified about the child's behavior since \r\n  the incident. Further, the expert testified \"specifically about the traumatic \r\n  impact an in-court confrontation would have on the child.\" Id. at 79, \r\n  393 S.E.2d at 920. The court then ruled: \"Dr. Harding testified that in his \r\n  opinion there would be significant harm to the child if he were required to \r\n  testify in the presence of the Defendant. I believe the testimony of Dr. Harding \r\n  concerning potential harm to the child.\" Id. The trial court's ruling \r\n  was upheld on appeal. \r\n  \r\nIn State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. \r\n  351, 353 S.E.2d 451 (1987), upon which the Murrell court relied, the \r\n  trial judge interviewed the three-year-old sexual abuse victim and the child's \r\n  mother in chambers. Both the child and her mother testified the child was afraid \r\n  of the defendant. The trial court's ruling to allow videotaped testimony was \r\n  upheld on appeal. \r\n  \r\nA slightly different procedure was \r\n  used in State v. Lopez, 360 S.C. 362, 412 S.E.2d 390 (1991), which was \r\n  affirmed on appeal. Lopez was not a sexual abuse case, but rather a murder \r\n  trial in which the defendant was accused of murdering her three-year-old stepson. \r\n  At issue was the testimony of the defendant's other two stepsons. The stepsons \r\n  testified in the courtroom, but the defendant was required to sit out of their \r\n  line of sight. In making its decision, the trial judge relied upon testimony \r\n  from both stepsons, a detailed letter from a psychologist who had interviewed \r\n  both children, and the solicitor's testimony regarding a second expert's opinion. \r\n  The supreme court approved the judge's case-specific finding of necessity and \r\n  the method employed, noting, \"In State v. Murrell[ ], we suggested expert \r\n  testimony should be utilized when possible and the trial judge should also personally \r\n  interview the child.\" Id. at 365-66, 412 S.E.2d at 392. \r\n  \r\nIn Starnes v. State, 307 S.C. \r\n  247, 414 S.E.2d 582 (1992), the supreme court affirmed the defendant's conviction \r\n  for first degree criminal sexual conduct. At the pre-trial hearing to determine \r\n  the necessity of videotaped testimony, the child victim stated he was afraid \r\n  of his parents and did not want to testify in front of them. The child's fear \r\n  was confirmed by expert testimony from the child's psychiatrist. The supreme \r\n  court held that the defendant-mother's Sixth Amendment right to confront her \r\n  accusers was not prejudiced by her absence from the pre-trial hearing when her \r\n  attorney was present and cross-examined the child and the expert. \r\n  \r\nRecently, this court held that a \r\n  trial judge's reliance solely on the testimony of an expert was sufficient evident \r\n  to support the necessity for videotaped testimony. In re Cisco K., 332 \r\n  S.C. 649, 506 S.E.2d 536 (Ct. App. 1998). However, the expert there had seen \r\n  the four-year-old victim eighteen times and was able to testify specifically \r\n  about the child's nightmares, fear of being killed, and high anxiety level both \r\n  in and out of the treatment sessions. Further, the expert testified the child \r\n  said \"she never wanted to see Cisco again, wanted to beat him up, and would \r\n  like to see him in jail.\" Id. at 652, 506 S.E.2d at 538. \r\n  \r\nOf these cases, only in Murrell \r\n  and Cisco K. did the trial judge not interview the child. However, the \r\n  testimony in both those cases was much more extensive and specific than that \r\n  relied upon here, and involved the children's strong fear of the respective \r\n  defendants. Further, those cases involved specific findings by the trial judges \r\n  regarding their reasons for ordering the videotaped testimony. \r\n  \r\nBy contrast, the expert testimony \r\n  here came from a social worker who provides family counseling, rather than an \r\n  expert trained specifically in child sexual abuse. She saw the child only eight \r\n  times, the final session being July 22, 1996. The trial took place November \r\n  4-8, 1996. Charpia testified that the child presented symptoms of depression, \r\n  but also stated the child \"continues to blame herself because of the family \r\n  estrangement.\" She testified generally about the child's intimidation of the \r\n  courtroom setting, but pointed to nothing specific about the child's fear of \r\n  the defendant. In fact, she stated that the child loves the defendant, has referred \r\n  to him as her best friend, and was \"afraid that she was in trouble and she was \r\n  going to get Uncle Gary in trouble by talking about this.\" Finally, Charpia \r\n  said, \"[The child] feels like a lot of victims feel. She inappropriately feels \r\n  responsible for a lot of the adult behavior that happened. . . . All I can say \r\n  is that [this child], as any child would feel, feels intimidated by court in \r\n  general . . . and facing her accusers, which are her family.\" \r\n  \r\nThe mother's testimony was, at best, \r\n  also quite generalized. While stating the child has had nightmares since the \r\n  alleged abuse, she admitted the child also had nightmares prior to the alleged \r\n  abuse. The only other behaviors the mother was able to point to that she felt \r\n  were a result of abuse were that the child \"has a tendency like she wants to \r\n  talk back or she doesn't want to do what you ask her to do at times.\" Significantly, \r\n  the mother also conceded that the child loved Bray and considered him her best \r\n  friend. \r\n  \r\n\"It is clear from our case law that \r\n  a trial judge's first-hand observations and impressions of a child, whether \r\n  through testimony, interviewing, or otherwise, are not only required when possible, \r\n  but carry great weight in the evidentiary sufficiency question.\" Lewis, \r\n  324 S.C. at 550, 478 S.E.2d at 867. In Lewis, this court acknowledged \r\n  that, in making a case-specific finding of the necessity for videotaped testimony, \r\n  the \"'trial court must find that the emotional distress suffered by the child \r\n  witness in the presence of the defendant is more than de minimis, i.e., \r\n  more than mere nervousness or excitement or some reluctance to testify.'\" Id. \r\n  at 545, 478 S.E.2d at 861 (quoting Maryland v. Craig, 497 U.S. 836, 856-57 \r\n  (1990) (citations omitted)). \r\n  \r\nWe do not think this burden has been \r\n  met in this case. We realize that while Murrell's suggestion that the \r\n  trial judge interview the child is not mandatory, it was strongly suggested \r\n  as appropriate in all such cases.(3) Given the \r\n  threshold acknowledged in Lewis, we hold that only when the considered \r\n  testimony is strong, specific, and persuasive about the child's fear of the \r\n  defendant and the harm the child will suffer if forced to testify in front of \r\n  the accused may the trial judge forego interviewing the child directly.(4) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nHere, the expert and the mother both \r\n  testified in a generalized manner. Charpia was not an expert in child sexual \r\n  abuse, and her sessions with the child had ended well before trial. Rather than \r\n  showing that the child was intimidated by or afraid of Bray, the testimony here \r\n  showed that the child was afraid of the consequences Bray would suffer from \r\n  her testimony. There was simply no showing of trauma to the child that was not \r\n  common to most intra-family child abuse cases. Consequently, we hold that there \r\n  was insufficient evidence of the necessity of having this child testify via \r\n  CCTV. \r\n  \r\nWe note that violation of a defendant's \r\n  Sixth Amendment right to confrontation is not necessarily reversible error unless \r\n  the defendant suffered prejudice therefrom. Lewis, 324 S.C. at 550, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d at 867; State v. Graham, 314 S.C. 383, 386, 444 S.E.2d 525, 527 \r\n  (1994). \r\n  \r\n\"Whether such an error is harmless \r\n  in a particular case depends upon a host of factors. . . . The factors include \r\n  the importance of the witness' testimony in the prosecution's case, whether \r\n  the testimony was cumulative, the presence or absence of evidence corroborating \r\n  or contradicting the testimony of the witness on material points, the extent \r\n  of cross-examination otherwise permitted, and, of course, the overall strength \r\n  of the prosecution's case.\" \r\n  \r\nId. (quoting Delaware v. \r\n  Van Arsdall, 475 U.S. 673, 684 (1986)). \r\n  \r\nHere, the child's testimony provided \r\n  the only direct evidence of Bray's alleged abuse. A medical examination of the \r\n  child did not validate the sexual abuse claim, and it was not until her interview \r\n  with LCC's therapist that the child mentioned Bray or sexual acts. We note this \r\n  was after an opportunity to tell her grandmother and her parents and after an \r\n  initial psychological evaluation-in other words, after several events had already \r\n  transpired in the investigation into the alleged abuse without the child ever \r\n  mentioning Bray's participation. Bray testified in his own defense and directly \r\n  denied the allegations. Under these circumstances, we find Bray's constitutional \r\n  right to confront his accuser was of paramount importance, and its denial cannot \r\n  be deemed harmless error. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse Bray's conviction \r\n  and remand for a new trial.(5) \r\n  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  Apparently, \r\n  the allegations of abuse in this case have divided this family. The mother, \r\n  father, and child believe the abuse happened, while the remainder of the family, \r\n  including the grandmother and Bray's other siblings, believe the abuse is a \r\n  fabrication. The grandmother testified that although the child once said, \"Uncle \r\n  Gary and I have a secret,\" the child never told her what the secret was and \r\n  never said Bray touched her private parts in a sexual way. \r\n2.

Wife also appeals from the family court's \r\n  failure to order Ronnie Dean Morris (Husband) to pay child support for one of \r\n  the parties' adult children. We affirm as modified. \r\n  \r\nThe parties were married in September \r\n  of 1966. They have four children, the youngest of whom was still a minor at \r\n  the time of trial. The two oldest children have learning disabilities and reside \r\n  with Wife in the marital home, along with the youngest child. \r\n  \r\nThroughout their marriage, Husband \r\n  worked for Proctor and Gamble and provided almost all of the family's financial \r\n  support. Due to opportunities for his career advancement, the family moved four \r\n  times over twenty-six years. The final move was to Greenville, South Carolina, \r\n  where the parties have resided since 1987. Wife primarily cared for the children \r\n  when they were young, but was also employed sporadically and attended college \r\n  at several different schools. At the time of trial, she lacked only seventeen \r\n  credit hours to complete a degree in landscape architecture from Clemson University. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWife brought this action against \r\n  Husband in 1995 seeking, inter alia, a divorce on the ground of adultery, \r\n  equitable distribution of marital property and debt, alimony, custody of the \r\n  parties' minor child, child support for the minor child, and child support for \r\n  two of the parties' adult children. \r\n  \r\nBy order dated May 6, 1997, the family \r\n  court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery and awarded her custody \r\n  of and child support for the parties' minor child, a portion of the marital \r\n  estate, and $1,500 per month in alimony. The family court also awarded child \r\n  support for Lee, one of the parties' adult children, but denied Wife support \r\n  for Andy, another adult child. This appeal followed. \r\n  \r\nLAW / ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Child Support \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Wife argues the family \r\n  court erred in failing to award her child support for Andy. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nIn September of 1993, Gary A. Jones, \r\n  a clinical psychologist, evaluated Andy, who was twenty-four years old at the \r\n  time of trial, to determine whether he suffers from a learning disability. Andy \r\n  obtained an IQ score of seventy-five, which Dr. Jones testified \"placed him \r\n  in the borderline range of intellectual functioning . . . between normal and \r\n  retarded.\" However, Dr. Jones noted there was some indication Andy failed to \r\n  \"try as hard as he could on some parts of the test.\" Dr. Jones further noted \r\n  Andy had scored higher on a previous IQ test. Dr. Jones also administered the \r\n  Gates-McKinney test, which showed a fifth to sixth grade level for Andy's reading \r\n  comprehension, with a considerably higher reading recognition score. According \r\n  to Dr. Jones, Andy's compiled test results indicate he functions at a level \r\n  below that properly classified as learning disabled. \r\n  \r\nAndy performed poorly in school and \r\n  left high school at age twenty-one without graduating. He does not have a driver's \r\n  license. Nonetheless, it is undisputed Andy works and can make financial contributions \r\n  to his own support. At the time of trial, Andy had been employed on a full-time \r\n  basis as a convenience store clerk for one and one-half years. His employment \r\n  duties include working without supervision for eight hours at a time. Between \r\n  May 1995 and December 1996, Andy earned $6.45 per hour and grossed $30,574.51. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSouth Carolina Code section 20-7-420(17) \r\n  (Supp. 1998), empowers the family court \"to provide for child support past age \r\n  eighteen where there are physical or mental disabilities of the child or other \r\n  exceptional circumstances that warrant the continuation of child support beyond \r\n  age eighteen for as long as the physical or mental disabilities or exceptional \r\n  circumstances continue.\" Wife argues that Andy requires support in order to \r\n  remain employed because she provides his transportation to and from work. This \r\n  requires her to be available to drive him and thus precludes her from working \r\n  herself. \r\n  \r\nWe find this argument unavailing \r\n  for several reasons. First, Andy has taken taxis to work when Wife was unavailable \r\n  to drive him and is able to make those arrangements himself. Second, Andy earns \r\n  enough at his job to be able to pay for transportation to and from work. He \r\n  could pay his mother as easily as he could pay a taxi. Third, the support Wife \r\n  argues Andy needs is not necessarily financial, but is rather general guidance \r\n  in his daily life. While we do not know whether Andy is capable of living on \r\n  his own, we do think he is clearly capable of contributing financially to his \r\n  own support. \r\n  \r\nWe note the marked difference between \r\n  Andy's and his brother Lee's needs for financial support. Lee, who was twenty-three \r\n  at the time of trial, suffers from severe emotional problems with a documented \r\n  history of inappropriate social behavior. He has never had a job, has an explosive \r\n  temper, and has difficulty completing routine tasks. Wife and Lee's sister testified \r\n  that Lee engages in ritualistic behaviors from arranging the dishes in the dishwasher \r\n  in a set manner to taking excessive time to sweep a floor. If interrupted in \r\n  the middle of a task, Lee must start over from the beginning of the routine. \r\n  At the time of trial, Lee's bed consisted of a sleeping bag on cardboard and \r\n  carpet scraps he had placed over the joists in the attic storage space under \r\n  the eaves of the home. The family court judge found Lee's limitations severe \r\n  enough to order Husband to continue supporting Lee financially, and Husband \r\n  does not dispute that obligation. \r\n  \r\nIn contrast, Andy, while impaired, \r\n  simply does not have limitations that prevent him from gainful employment outside \r\n  the home. Under the facts and circumstances of this case, we are compelled to \r\n  agree with the family court that Wife failed to establish exceptional circumstances \r\n  sufficient to require Husband to support Andy. Clearly, Andy has demonstrated \r\n  an ability, despite his learning difficulties, to support himself financially. \r\n  We find no abuse of discretion in the family court's determination of this issue. \r\n  \r\nII. Equitable Apportionment \r\n  \r\n Wife next argues the family court \r\n  erred in awarding her only forty-five percent of Husband's retirement account. \r\n  Specifically, Wife asserts the family court failed to give adequate weight to \r\n  her contributions to the marriage or Husband's fault in the breakdown of the \r\n  marital relationship. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n\"The doctrine of equitable distribution \r\n  is based on a recognition that marriage is, among other things, an economic \r\n  partnership.\" Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, \r\n  810 (Ct. App. 1996). Upon dissolution of the marriage, marital property should \r\n  be divided and distributed in a manner which fairly reflects each spouse's contribution \r\n  to its acquisition, regardless of who holds legal title. Id. \r\n  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property \r\n  is within the family court judge's discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal \r\n  absent an abuse of discretion. Bungener v. Bungener, 291 S.C. 247, 251, \r\n  353 S.E.2d 147, 150 (Ct. App. 1987). South Carolina Code section 20-7-472 (Supp. \r\n  1998), lists fifteen factors for the court to consider in making an equitable \r\n  apportionment of the marital estate. The statute vests in the family court the \r\n  discretion to decide what weight should be assigned to the various factors. \r\n  On review, this court looks to the overall fairness of the apportionment, and \r\n  if the end result is equitable, that this court might have weighed specific \r\n  factors differently than the family court is irrelevant. Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  296 S.C. 289, 300-01, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). \r\n  \r\nOur review of the record convinces \r\n  us the family court's award to Wife of forty-five percent of Husband's retirement \r\n  account is fair and equitable under the circumstances. Although fault is one \r\n  factor for the court to consider in equitably dividing marital property, it \r\n  does not justify a severe penalty. Noll v. Noll, 297 S.C. 190, 196, 375 \r\n  S.E.2d 338, 342 (Ct. App. 1988); Rampey v. Rampey, 286 S.C. 153, 156, \r\n  332 S.E.2d 213, 214 (Ct. App. 1985); Gibson v. Gibson, 283 S.C. 318, \r\n  325, 322 S.E.2d 680, 684 (Ct. App. 1984). The family court expressly considered \r\n  several relevant factors in determining an appropriate division of Husband's \r\n  retirement account, including the length of the marriage, the earning potential \r\n  of each spouse, tax consequences, existence of other obligations, the ability \r\n  of each party to meet their financial obligations and expenses, and that \"[H]usband \r\n  was at fault but not entirely in ending the marriage.\" In light of the family \r\n  court's finding that Husband contributed almost all of the family's financial \r\n  support during the marriage and contributed indirect support equal to Wife's \r\n  indirect contributions, we do not think the family court abused its discretion \r\n  in dividing the retirement account. \r\n  \r\nII. Alimony \r\n  \r\nWife argues the family court erred \r\n  in awarding her only $1,500 per month in alimony. We agree. \r\n  \r\nAn award of alimony rests within \r\n  the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion. Williams v. Williams, 297 S.C. 208, 210, 375 S.E.2d \r\n  349, 350 (Ct. App. 1988). \"Alimony is a substitute for the support that is normally \r\n  incident to the marital relationship.\" Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, \r\n  300, 372 S.E.2d 107, 113 (Ct. App. 1988). Alimony should ordinarily place the \r\n  supported spouse, as nearly as is practical, in the same position he or she \r\n  enjoyed during the marriage. Id. It is the family court's duty to make \r\n  an alimony award that is fit, equitable, and just if the claim is well-founded. \r\n  Woodward v. Woodward, 294 S.C. 210, 217, 363 S.E.2d 413, 417 (Ct. App. \r\n  1987). \r\n  \r\nFactors to be considered in making \r\n  an alimony award include: (1) duration of the marriage; (2) physical and emotional \r\n  health of the parties; (3) educational background of the parties; (4) employment \r\n  history and earning potential of the parties; (5) standard of living established \r\n  during the marriage; (6) current and reasonably anticipated earnings of the \r\n  parties; (7) current and reasonably anticipated expenses of the parties; (8) \r\n  equitable apportionment; (9) custody of children; (10) marital misconduct or \r\n  fault; (11) tax consequences; and (12) prior support obligations. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-3-130(C) (1976 &amp; Supp. 1998). No one factor is dispositive. Lide \r\n  v. Lide, 277 S.C. 155, 157, 283 S.E.2d 832, 833 (1981). \r\n  \r\nBoth Husband and Wife were fifty \r\n  years old at the time of trial. Although Wife was unemployed at the time of \r\n  trial, she has attended some college and established a work history during the \r\n  course of the marriage. In determining the award of alimony to Wife, the family \r\n  court imputed an annual income of $16,000 to $17,000 to her. Husband's annual \r\n  income, with benefits, at the time of trial was $108,000. \r\n  \r\nA review of the family court's order \r\n  reveals a studied application of the factors relevant to an alimony award, including \r\n  the court's consideration of Wife's earning capacity. However, in light of the \r\n  fact that Husband earns a considerable income, Wife's standard of living has \r\n  dropped significantly, and Husband admitted to adultery, we find the family \r\n  court's award of $1,500 per month inadequate. We therefore order Husband to \r\n  pay an increased award of $2,000 per month in alimony to Wife, commencing with \r\n  the month of May 1999. \r\n  \r\nIV. Exclusive Possession of Marital \r\n  Home \r\n  \r\nWife next contends the family court \r\n  erred in failing to award her exclusive use of the marital home as an incident \r\n  of support. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nAt the time of trial, the parties' \r\n  marital home had a fair market value of $185,000 and a $93,000 mortgage indebtedness. \r\n  The family court divided the $92,000 in equity equally between the parties and \r\n  ordered Wife to purchase Husband's $46,000 share of the equity within 120 days \r\n  of the order. Alternatively, the family court ordered the parties to sell the \r\n  home. \r\n  \r\nIn South Carolina, family courts \r\n  may grant a spouse possession of a marital home as an incident of support. Whitfield \r\n  v. Hanks, 278 S.C. 165, 293 S.E.2d 314 (1982). This court has recognized, \r\n  however, that such awards are burdensome upon the party who must defer realization \r\n  of the value of his or her share of the martial home. Johnson v. Johnson, \r\n  285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985). In light of this burden, \r\n  we have held that before awarding a spouse exclusive use of the home as an incident \r\n  of support, \"the court must carefully consider the claim of a party that the \r\n  interests of that party or the children are so predominant, when balanced against \r\n  the interests of the other, that an award of exclusive possession of the marital \r\n  home is compelled.\" Id. Some, but not all, of the compelling interests \r\n  the court may consider are: (1) adequate shelter for minors; (2) the inability \r\n  of the occupying spouse to otherwise obtain adequate housing; (3) the size of \r\n  the non-occupying spouse's equity in the home relative to his other assets or \r\n  income; (4) the size of the home relative to the expected use and the cost of \r\n  maintaining the home in comparison to the benefits received; and (5) the potential \r\n  duration of the exclusive possession. Thompson v. Brunson, 283 S.C. 221, \r\n  227-28, 321 S.E.2d 622, 625 (Ct. App. 1984); Johnson, 285 S.C. at 311, \r\n  329 S.E.2d at 445. \r\n  \r\nWife argues that even if she were \r\n  actually earning the income the family court imputed to her, she could not afford \r\n  to stay in the marital home and purchase the husband's equity. Thus, she alleges \r\n  she will be forced to sell the home and move. Not only would it be difficult \r\n  to find a home large enough to accommodate herself and the three sons that live \r\n  with her, but it would be extremely disruptive for the family. Alternatively, \r\n  Wife argues that to remain in the house and purchase Husband's equity would \r\n  force her to liquidate part of her portion of the retirement account, subjecting \r\n  her to taxes and penalties. Wife portrays either scenario as punitive and urges \r\n  this court to award her the marital home as an incident of support. \r\n  \r\nWe note that this marriage had only \r\n  two assets of any significant value: the marital home and the retirement account. \r\n  By delaying Husband's realization of his equity in the home, he is left with \r\n  no liquid assets with which to establish his new life, apart from the income \r\n  he earns. Considering that Wife will be receiving an increased alimony award \r\n  of $2,000 per month, that Wife receives $925.11 per month in child support, \r\n  that Andy can contribute financially to his support, and that Wife's earning \r\n  potential will increase significantly once she completes her remaining seventeen \r\n  credit hours in the Clemson University landscape architecture degree program, \r\n  we do not find it impossible or onerous for Wife to purchase Husband's equity. \r\n  On the other hand, delaying the disposition of the marital home would be onerous \r\n  to Husband, and because it is uncertain when or if Andy and Lee could ever live \r\n  on their own, such a delay may be lengthy. Consequently, we find the family \r\n  court did not err in its order as to disposition of the marital home. \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\nof the family court is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED. \r\n  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2995","title":"Duncan, et al. v.

We affirm. \r\n  \r\nDuncan filed a complaint against \r\n  the District alleging grossly negligent supervision. The District denied the \r\n  allegations and claimed immunity under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTCA).(1) \r\n  At the close of the plaintiff's case and of all the evidence, the District moved \r\n  for a directed verdict, arguing the plaintiff produced no evidence that the \r\n  District was grossly negligent, that the assault was unforeseeable, and that \r\n  the District was entitled to discretionary immunity. The trial court denied \r\n  the motions. The jury returned a verdict for Duncan awarding her $1,000,000 \r\n  actual damages. The trial court reduced the damages award to $250,000 pursuant \r\n  to the SCTCA, but otherwise denied the District's motions for a judgment notwithstanding \r\n  the verdict (JNOV), new trial absolute, and new trial nisi remittur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. \r\n  \r\nThe District contends the trial court \r\n  erred in denying its motions for directed verdict and JNOV. It asserts it exercised \r\n  at least slight care and thus was not grossly negligent. We disagree and find \r\n  sufficient evidence in the record to support the jury's finding of gross negligence. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"In deciding motions for directed \r\n  verdict and those for judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the evidence and \r\n  all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the \r\n  nonmoving party. If more than one inference can be drawn from the evidence, \r\n  the case must be submitted to the jury.\" Howard v. State Farm Mut. Ins. Co., \r\n  316 S.C. 445, 451, 450 S.E.2d 582, 585-86 (1994) (citation omitted). \r\n  \r\nA. \r\n  \r\nThe facts, viewed in the light most \r\n  favorable to Duncan, are as follows. \r\n  \r\nDuncan, sixteen years old, attended \r\n  high school in the District. Her IQ of 38 qualified her for the District's Trainable \r\n  Mentally Handicapped (TMH) program.(2) Sharlene \r\n  Mastic taught Duncan in the TMH class. \r\n  \r\nMastic had planned a trip to Beaufort, \r\n  South Carolina, for her class to participate in the Special Olympics. Mastic's \r\n  responsibilities required her to travel ahead of the class to prepare for the \r\n  events. She received permission from Anderson Taylor, her principal, to do so. \r\n  Approximately 40 students and 8 teachers would travel by bus with Barbara Mitchell, \r\n  Mastic's aide, who would be in charge of supervising the seven students from \r\n  Mastic's class. \r\n  \r\nBecause Mastic doubted Mitchell's \r\n  ability to competently supervise the students by herself,(3) \r\n  \r\n Mastic separately spoke with Taylor \r\n  and Jean Stokes, the assistant principal, about employing a substitute teacher \r\n  to provide additional supervision.(4) Because \r\n  other adults would be present, Taylor determined a substitute was unnecessary. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe students returned from the Beaufort \r\n  trip and, under Mitchell's supervision, waited in front of the District building \r\n  for a bus to take them home. Mitchell left the children to go to the bathroom. \r\n  Duncan, Grant, Valerie Johnson, and Belle Fields, all members of the TMH class, \r\n  then left the group. They went around the side of the District building and \r\n  into a stairwell. Johnson and Fields acted as lookouts while Grant attempted \r\n  sexual intercourse with Duncan.(5) \r\n  \r\nAt some point during these activities, \r\n  Mildred Gadsen, a fourth grade teacher, walked into the District building and \r\n  saw Duncan bent over with her pants and underwear pulled down while Grant stood \r\n  immediately behind Duncan. When Gadsen walked in, Grant ran away and Duncan \r\n  said, \"he made me do it.\" When Gadsen first saw Duncan and Grant, Duncan was \r\n  not struggling or complaining in any way and did not seem upset. When Gadsen \r\n  took Duncan to Mitchell, Duncan cried hysterically. \r\n  \r\nThat evening, Duncan's guardian, \r\n  Eva Mae Duncan (Eva Mae), took Duncan to the hospital for an examination and \r\n  reported the incident to the sheriff's department. The sheriff's report indicated \r\n  that Grant took Duncan by the hand, told Duncan to take off her clothes, had \r\n  sex with Duncan despite her verbal resistance, and then ran when Duncan threatened \r\n  to tell. The hospital's evaluation rape kit did not indicate a rape, although \r\n  the officer that filled out the incident report testified that this is not dispositive \r\n  of whether a rape occurred. \r\n  \r\nAfter the incident, Eva Mae prohibited \r\n  Duncan from returning to school because the District refused to transfer either \r\n  Duncan or Grant to a different classroom. The school officials told Eva Mae \r\n  that they could not remedy the situation and that Eva Mae must send Duncan back \r\n  to class. Eva Mae did not comply with this request. Some time later, the truancy \r\n  officer for Hampton County signed a warrant for the arrest of Duncan's mother, \r\n  Mary Duncan (Mary), who did not have custody of Duncan and had no idea Duncan \r\n  was not attending her classes. Mary was incarcerated, tried and found guilty \r\n  by a local magistrate, and ordered to send Duncan to school. As a result, Eva \r\n  Mae sent Duncan back to school. However, upon returning to class, Duncan became \r\n  withdrawn and indicated a desire not to go to school, behavior she did not display \r\n  prior to the incident. As of the date of trial, Duncan and Grant still attended \r\n  the same class. \r\n  \r\nThere is evidence that Duncan incurred \r\n  substantial emotional harm as a result of the incident at bar. Mitchell testified \r\n  that Duncan was crying hysterically when she returned to the front of \r\n  the District building with Gadsen. Chaslyn Vanderburgh, Duncan's bus driver, \r\n  explained that Duncan was still crying hysterically when she got on the bus. \r\n  Moreover, Eva Mae stated that Duncan was crying when she arrived at home. Eva \r\n  Mae indicated that, after the incident, Duncan would sleep for \"hours and hours\" \r\n  more than usual and appeared to be sadder than before. Each time Duncan talked \r\n  about the details of the incident she became very anxious and upset and cried \r\n  often. \r\n  \r\nLori Ann Rogers, who was qualified \r\n  as an expert in counseling sexually abused children, interviewed Duncan. During \r\n  the interview, Duncan cried and exhibited very anxious and emotional behavior. \r\n  Rogers commented that Duncan felt unsafe and insecure about attending school. \r\n  Rogers claimed that Duncan's future sense of safety would be jeopardized and \r\n  that her psychological problems had been heightened due to Grant's continued \r\n  presence in the classroom. Rogers recommended individual and family counseling \r\n  for Duncan and suggested placing Duncan in a classroom different from Grant \r\n  for her emotional well-being. \r\n  \r\nPatricia Malphrus, who was also qualified \r\n  as an expert in counseling sexually abused children, counseled Duncan. In the \r\n  counseling sessions, Duncan's anxiety escalated when asked to speak of the details \r\n  of the incident. In Malphrus's opinion, Duncan had been traumatized by the incident \r\n  and suffered from an \"adjustment disorder with a mixed disturbance of anxiety \r\n  and [chronic] depression.\" Malphrus also concluded that Duncan would suffer \r\n  future trauma as a result of the incident and that putting Grant and Duncan \r\n  in the same classroom would set back Duncan's recovery. Though Malphrus admitted \r\n  that Duncan had made progress in dealing with the incident, Malphrus testified \r\n  that Duncan needed more counseling. \r\n  \r\nB. \r\n  \r\nPreliminarily, we note that the District \r\n  also argues it cannot be held liable in this case because it is entitled under \r\n  the SCTCA to immunity for its discretionary acts. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 15-78-60(5) (Supp. 1998). The analysis of this issue and the gross negligence \r\n  issue both hinge on whether the record contains any evidence of gross negligence. \r\n  Consequently, we discuss the two issues together. \r\n  \r\nUnder the SCTCA, \r\n  \r\n[t]he State, an agency, a political \r\n  subdivision, and a governmental entity are liable for their torts in the same \r\n  manner and to the same extent as a private individual under like circumstances, \r\n  subject to the limitations upon liability and damages, and exemptions from liability \r\n  and damages, contained herein. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. \r\n  1998). In S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 1998), the SCTCA provides certain \r\n  exemptions from or limitations on the government's liability for its torts. \r\n  The burden of proving any of these exceptions to the general rule of governmental \r\n  liability as a private individual \"is upon the governmental entity asserting \r\n  it as an affirmative defense.\" Strange v. South Carolina Dep't of Highways \r\n  &amp; Pub. Transp., 314 S.C. 427, 430, 445 S.E.2d 439, 440 (1994). The exceptions \r\n  pertinent to this case provide as follows: \r\n  \r\nThe governmental entity is not liable \r\n  for a loss resulting from: \r\n  \r\n(5) the exercise of discretion or \r\n  judgment by the governmental entity or employee or the performance or failure \r\n  to perform any act or service which is in the discretion or judgment of the \r\n  governmental entity or employee; [or] \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(25) [the performance of a] responsibility \r\n  or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection, control, confinement, \r\n  or custody of any student, patient, prisoner, inmate, or client of any governmental \r\n  entity, except when the responsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly \r\n  negligent manner; \r\n  \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-60(5) &amp; \r\n  (25) (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nHowever, this Court has previously \r\n  held that subsection five must be read in conjunction with subsection twenty-five. \r\n  See Jackson v. South Carolina Dep't of Corrections, 301 S.C. 125, \r\n  128, 390 S.E.2d 467, 469 (Ct. App. 1989), aff'd, 302 S.C. 519, 397 S.E.2d \r\n  377 (1990). Thus, \"[i]f discretion is exercised in a grossly negligent manner,\" \r\n  then the governmental entity involved is liable for its torts as if it were \r\n  a private individual. Jackson, 301 S.C. at 128, 397 S.E.2d at 469. We \r\n  must therefore determine if there is any evidence indicating that the District \r\n  was grossly negligent. If such evidence exists, then the District is not entitled \r\n  to immunity under the SCTCA. \r\n  \r\nGross negligence has been defined \r\n  as \"the failure to exercise slight care\"; \"the intentional, conscious failure \r\n  to do something which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of \r\n  a thing intentionally that one ought not to do\"; and \"a relative term\" meaning \r\n  \"the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.\" Hollins \r\n  v. Richland County School Dist. One, 310 S.C. 486, 490, 427 S.E.2d 654, \r\n  656 (1993) (citations omitted). \r\n  \r\nThe record contains evidence from \r\n  which a jury could conclude the District was grossly negligent. Grant testified \r\n  and Mastic concluded that Mitchell left the students unattended while she used \r\n  the restroom, despite her knowledge of the previous sexual encounter between \r\n  two other students. Mastic explained that TMH students need constant supervision \r\n  to ensure their safety. From these facts alone, the jury could determine the \r\n  District was grossly negligent. Nevertheless, even if we assume Mitchell's version \r\n  of the facts to be true, she was only charged with supervising seven students \r\n  and there is no evidence of how two to three students in addition to Duncan \r\n  strayed away from Mitchell's sight. Thus, even in this scenario, the jury could \r\n  conclude that the District was grossly negligent. \r\n  \r\nII. \r\n  \r\nThe District argues expert testimony \r\n  was required to establish the standard of care for TMH students. Because the \r\n  District did not raise this argument below, it is not preserved. See \r\n  Connolly v. People's Life Ins. Co., 299 S.C. 348, 351, 384 S.E.2d 738, \r\n  740 (1989) (holding that a party must state a specific ground for a directed \r\n  verdict motion in order to preserve the issue for appellate review); Glover \r\n  v. North Carolina Mut. Life Ins. Co., 295 S.C. 251, 256, 368 S.E.2d 68, \r\n  72 (Ct. App. 1988) (\"A motion for judgment n.o.v. under Rule 50(b)[, SCRCP,] \r\n  is a renewal of the directed verdict motion and is limited to the grounds asserted \r\n  in the directed verdict motion.\").(6) \r\n  \r\nIII. \r\n  \r\nThe District contends Duncan failed \r\n  to establish the foreseeability of her injuries and thus failed to establish \r\n  legal cause. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nA plaintiff proves legal cause \r\n  \r\nby establishing foreseeability. Foreseeability \r\n  is determined by looking to the natural and probable consequences of the complained \r\n  of act. The defendant's negligence does not have to be the sole proximate cause \r\n  of the plaintiff[']s injury; instead, the plaintiff must prove the defendant's \r\n  negligence was at least one of the proximate causes of the injury. \r\n  \r\nBishop v. South Carolina Dep't \r\n  of Mental Health, 331 S.C. 79, 88-89, 502 S.E.2d 78, 83 (1998) (citations \r\n  omitted). \r\n  \r\n\"[I]n order to establish liability, \r\n  it is not necessary the person charged with negligence should have contemplated \r\n  the particular event which occurred. It is sufficient that he should have \r\n  foreseen his negligence would probably cause injury to someone.\" Greenville \r\n  Mem'l Auditorium v. Martin, 301 S.C. 242 , 245, 391 S.E.2d 546, 547-48 (1990) \r\n  (citation omitted) (emphasis added). \"Ordinarily, the question of proximate \r\n  cause is one of fact for the jury and the trial judge's sole function regarding \r\n  the issue is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable \r\n  inferences that can be drawn from the evidence.\" Small v. Pioneer Mach. Inc., \r\n  329 S.C. 448, 464, 494 S.E.2d 835, 843 (Ct. App. 1997). \r\n  \r\nThe record contains evidence that, \r\n  only two weeks prior to the incident at issue, two students engaged in a sexual \r\n  act when supervised by Mitchell. The record also contains evidence that TMH \r\n  students have normal teenage bodies but only child-like mentalities. Consequently, \r\n  sexual acts between these students were reasonably predictable. Mastic testified \r\n  Mitchell should not be responsible for supervising the students. Mitchell's \r\n  prior employment record provided the District with ample evidence of Mitchell's \r\n  inability to competently supervise students. Thus, there is sufficient evidence \r\n  in the record for the jury to conclude Duncan's injuries stemmed from the natural \r\n  and probable consequences of the District's and Mitchell's gross negligence. \r\n  See Greenville Mem'l Auditorium, 301 S.C. at 245-46, 391 S.E.2d \r\n  at 548 (upholding a jury's foreseeability determination despite it being the \r\n  first instance the incident in question occurred). \r\n  \r\nIV. \r\n  \r\nAfter the trial court announced the \r\n  damages verdict, the foreman of the jury passed a sheet of paper to the court. \r\n  The paper was signed by all the members of the jury and contained three recommendations: \r\n  That Mitchell be reassigned from a teaching aide to an administrative post, \r\n  that the District remove Duncan from the class with her alleged assailant, and \r\n  that the police record of Duncan's mother be cleared of the charge of failing \r\n  to send Duncan to school. On appeal, the District contends the trial court should \r\n  have granted the District's motion for a new trial absolute because the size \r\n  of the damages award and the recommendations indicate that the jury's verdict \r\n  was the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or other improper considerations. \r\n  We disagree. \r\n  \r\nThe trial court must grant \r\n  a new trial absolute \"if the verdict is so grossly excessive that it shocks \r\n  the conscience of the court and clearly indicates the amount of the verdict \r\n  was the result of caprice, passion, prejudice, partiality, corruption, or other \r\n  improper motive.\" Knoke v. South Carolina Dep't of Parks, Recreation and \r\n  Tourism, 324 S.C. 136, 141, 478 S.E.2d 256, 258 (1996). Alternatively, the \r\n  trial court may grant a new trial absolute when, sitting as the thirteenth \r\n  juror, it concludes the jury's verdict is not supported by the evidence. See \r\n  Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 402, 477 S.E.2d 715, 722 (Ct. App. 1996). \r\n  However, \"[t]he jury's determination of damages is entitled to substantial deference.\" \r\n  Knoke, 324 S.C. at 141, 478 S.E.2d at 258. On appeal, the appellate court \r\n  reviews a denial of a new trial motion for an abuse of discretion. See \r\n  Vinson, 324 S.C. at 403-06, 477 S.E.2d at 722-23. The appellate court \r\n  will not reverse the trial court's decision unless it is controlled by an error \r\n  of law or is not supported by the evidence. See id. \r\n  \r\nThe District argues that Sanders \r\n  v. Prince, 304 S.C. 236, 403 S.E.2d 640 (1991), requires the granting of \r\n  a new trial in the case at bar. We disagree. In Sanders, Atlee Prince \r\n  and Naomi Sanders were members of a school board. Sanders was its chairperson \r\n  and Prince was its vice-chairperson. Prince became suspicious that the board \r\n  was mismanaging its funds. As a result, he formed the board's Standing Committee \r\n  on Finance and was elected its chairperson. As chairperson, he ordered an audit \r\n  of the board's finances. Later, he claimed certain board members were attempting \r\n  to impede this audit. 304 S.C. at 237, 403 S.E.2d at 641. Consequently, feeling \r\n  he had no other option, Prince held a news conference and alleged fraudulent \r\n  actions within the Sanders administration. Id. at 237-38, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  at 641-42. Sanders sued for defamation. Id. at 238, 403 S.E.2d at 642. \r\n  Shortly after beginning deliberations, the jury asked the trial court whether \r\n  it could force Prince to resign from the board. Id. at 239, 403 S.E.2d \r\n  at 642. The jury ultimately returned a verdict for Sanders, awarding her $1.25 \r\n  million actual damages and $750,000 punitive damages. Id. at 238, 403 \r\n  S.E.2d at 642. \r\n  \r\nAlthough the trial court properly \r\n  handled the situation, Prince claimed on appeal that the jury's question was \r\n  evidence of passion and caprice affecting the jury's verdict to a degree that \r\n  warranted a new trial. The Supreme Court agreed. It held that the size of the \r\n  verdict as compared to the evidence of damages, in conjunction with the jury's \r\n  question, demanded a new trial. In so holding, it noted that Sanders had been \r\n  re-elected to the board as chairperson and, therefore, could not have suffered \r\n  millions of dollars in damages to her reputation. Id. Thus, while the \r\n  jury's question may have been evidence of an improper motive on the jury's part, \r\n  the lack of evidence to support the size of the verdict played a major role \r\n  in the court's decision. \r\n  \r\nIn contrast, here, the evidence supports \r\n  the large damage award given. There is evidence that Duncan cried hysterically \r\n  from the time she returned to the front of the District building until she arrived \r\n  at the hospital that evening and that she still cries when forced to recall \r\n  the details of the incident. The record indicates that since the incident, Duncan \r\n  has been uncharacteristically withdrawn, sad, and disinterested in school. Both \r\n  experts testified that Duncan was very traumatized by the event and that her \r\n  symptoms of depression had been augmented by Grant's continued presence in the \r\n  classroom with Duncan. Also, both experts predicted future problems for Duncan \r\n  in the form of a loss of her sense of safety and the occurrence of flashbacks. \r\n  \r\nIn addition, the jury in the case \r\n  at bar did not attempt to usurp its authority as did the jury in Sanders. \r\n  304 S.C. at 239, 403 S.E.2d at 642. Here, after the trial court published the \r\n  verdict, the jury passed up to the court certain recommendations. These recommendations \r\n  were not demands or requests to make demands. Significantly, these recommendations \r\n  are consistent with a reasonable view of the evidence and do not indicate that \r\n  the jury's verdict was based on an improper motive. \r\n  \r\nIn conclusion, in contrast to the \r\n  facts in Sanders, the evidence in this case supported a large jury verdict. \r\n  Moreover, the jury's recommendations in this case did not indicate a decision \r\n  made on an improper motive. For these reasons, we cannot conclude that the jury's \r\n  verdict was so grossly excessive as to be motivated by passion, prejudice, or \r\n  any other improper motive. Hence, we uphold the trial court's refusal of the \r\n  District's motion for a new trial absolute.(7) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the trial \r\n  court's orders are AFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10 to -200 (Supp. 1998). \r\n2.  An IQ of 38 \r\n  equates to a mental age of approximately four years and three months. \r\n3.  Mitchell had \r\n  been a teacher in the District for many years. While a teacher, Mitchell's principal \r\n  reprimanded her for failing to control her classroom, poor organizational and \r\n  planning skills, and wasting instructional time. The District refused to renew \r\n  Mitchell's teaching contract because of her failure to control her class and \r\n  supervise her students. The District then placed Mitchell in charge of copying \r\n  for the District. She also worked in the high school library as a health media \r\n  specialist. Mitchell later became a teacher's aide for Leslie Fogleman. \r\n  \r\nFogleman complained to the principal \r\n  and superintendent about Mitchell's inability to handle her responsibilities \r\n  of \"shadowing\" one child and Mitchell's poor conduct such as falling asleep \r\n  in class. Fogleman eventually wrote a letter to the superintendent stating she \r\n  would not return as a teacher if the District placed Mitchell as her aide again \r\n  because it was easier to control the students when Mitchell was asleep in the \r\n  classroom. The District then transferred Mitchell to Mastic's class. \r\n  \r\nMastic testified she experienced \r\n  problems with Mitchell prior to the Beaufort trip, including Mitchell's falling \r\n  asleep in class. On one occasion, Mastic learned that two students in her class \r\n  had sex while Mitchell was charged with their supervision. Mastic discussed \r\n  these problems with her supervisor, assistant principal, and principal on prior \r\n  occasions. However, Mastic was told that the administration could not do anything \r\n  with Mitchell because Mitchell's father was on the District's school board. \r\n  \r\n4.  As noted above, \r\n  two weeks prior to the incident at bar, two students from the TMH class engaged \r\n  in sex while under Mitchell's supervision. Jerome Grant, Duncan's classmate \r\n  and the alleged assailant in this case, saw this prior event. Moreover, Mastic \r\n  testified that TMH students were easily influenced by their surroundings because \r\n  their bodies were much more mature than their minds. Consequently, to protect \r\n  them from sexual misbehavior, she stated that they must be watched very carefully. \r\n  \r\n5.  These facts \r\n  come from Mastic's subsequent investigation of the incident. However, the evidence \r\n  conflicts as to exactly what happened. Mitchell testified that she did not go \r\n  to the bathroom while taking care of the students after their trip. She claimed \r\n  she merely granted Duncan's request to use the bathroom by herself, because \r\n  Duncan often went to the restroom on her own and other adults were around the \r\n  building. Furthermore, after Duncan returned, Mitchell claimed that Duncan denied \r\n  any sexual activity. \r\n6.  At the close \r\n  of the evidence, the District made a motion for a directed verdict, but never \r\n  mentioned the issue of whether expert testimony was required to establish the \r\n  standard of care. However, before announcing his ruling, the trial court took \r\n  up the issue sua sponte. In response, the District merely stated \"that \r\n  if there was a need for such testimony, it should have been presented by the \r\n  plaintiff.\" Even though the trial court discussed the issue, the District never \r\n  took a position on whether expert testimony was required. The District merely \r\n  stated what it believed the consequences of the trial court's conclusion would \r\n  be. This failure to explicitly move for a directed verdict on the issue renders \r\n  it not preserved. See Mize v. Blue Ridge Ry. Co., 219 S.C. 119, \r\n  129-30, 64 S.E.2d 253, 258 (1951) (An issue was not preserved even though the \r\n  trial court explicitly approached the issue, because the appellant did not mention \r\n  the issue in its directed verdict motion; the trial court's discussion did \"not \r\n  have the effect of enlarging the grounds upon which said motion was made.\"). \r\n  \r\n7.  The District \r\n  also claims that the damages award was \"so unduly liberal\" that it indicated \r\n  an intent to punish and was essentially a punitive damages verdict. Accordingly, \r\n  it argues that this Court should analyze the verdict under Constitutional precedent \r\n  limiting the awards of punitive damages. We disagree. As discussed above, the \r\n  evidence presented to the jury was sufficient to support the actual damages \r\n  award. Consequently, we hold that the damages award was not so large as to amount \r\n  to punitive damages. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2996","title":"Catawba Insurance Co. v.

The trial court submitted the permissive use issue \r\n  to the jury, who found Kelvin was driving the automobile with permission at \r\n  the time. Therefore, the trial court held the Nationwide policy provided liability \r\n  coverage and required Nationwide to reimburse Catawba for expenses it incurred \r\n  defending Brown's estate. Nationwide appeals. We reverse and remand. \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nOn October 30, 1994, Kelvin Brown \r\n  ran into a telephone pole while driving a Toyota owned by his aunt, Linda Prince. \r\n  Both Kelvin and his passenger, Thomas Lee Smith, Jr., were killed in the accident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nKelvin's mother, Artricia Brown, \r\n  had borrowed the car from her sister, Prince. She used the car almost every \r\n  weekend because her car was not working. Although Kelvin had his own truck, \r\n  he occasionally used Prince's car. He sometimes borrowed the car directly from \r\n  Prince. When he did, he asked Prince for permission. Additionally, he used the \r\n  car when it was in his mother's possession. Prince knew Kelvin sometimes drove \r\n  the car when Brown borrowed it. She acknowledged Brown could allow Kelvin to \r\n  use the car in Brown's discretion. \r\n  \r\nBrown placed the same restrictions \r\n  on Kelvin's use of Prince's automobile she put on her own car. Because Kelvin \r\n  had his own truck, he had to ask permission to use either her car or her sister's \r\n  car. Brown allowed Kelvin to use the car to go to work, run errands, visit friends \r\n  and attend Mason meetings. She did not allow him to use the car for joy riding \r\n  with friends, going to clubs, or staying out late at night. Brown also placed \r\n  rules on Kelvin's use of his truck. She prohibited him from having too many \r\n  people in the truck and from driving too late at night. \r\n  \r\n However, a friend of Kelvin's testified \r\n  he rode with Kelvin in Prince's car about three times. He stated they would \r\n  spend hours at a time in the car, riding around, listening to music, and going \r\n  to the basketball court and store. \r\n  \r\nOn the day of the accident, Kelvin \r\n  drove Brown in his truck to her sister's house to pick up the car. Kelvin went \r\n  out that evening in his truck. He returned home around eleven o'clock that night \r\n  with a friend, presumably, Thomas Smith. Kelvin told his mother that she needed \r\n  to go to bed. When she went to bed, Brown put the car keys on her mattress. \r\n  After she went to sleep, Kelvin took the keys and left in the car. Kelvin did \r\n  not ask permission to use the car. Kelvin and Thomas Smith were on their way \r\n  to a dance in Greenwood when they wrecked. \r\n  \r\nNationwide's liability policy covered \r\n  Prince's car. Because Kelvin lived with his mother, Catawba insured him under \r\n  her policy. Neither Brown nor her children lived with Prince. \r\n  \r\nBetty Smith, Thomas Lee Smith's personal \r\n  representative, sued Brown. Nationwide denied liability coverage, claiming Kelvin \r\n  was not driving the car with Prince's permission. Catawba tendered its policy \r\n  limits in exchange for a covenant not to execute. Smith, however, refused the \r\n  offer because of the potential coverage under the Nationwide policy. \r\n  \r\n Catawba brought this action against \r\n  Nationwide, Brown, as personal representative of Kelvin's estate, and Smith, \r\n  as personal representative of Thomas Smith's estate. Nationwide denied liability, \r\n  asserting a counterclaim against Catawba and cross-claims against Brown and \r\n  Smith. \r\n  \r\n As noted, the jury found Kelvin \r\n  had implied permission to drive Prince's car at the time of the accident. The \r\n  trial court denied Nationwide's motions for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  and for a new trial. In a written order, the court found Nationwide provided \r\n  primary liability coverage for the accident and consequently owed Brown a defense \r\n  to Smith's civil action. The judge also awarded Catawba the expenses resulting \r\n  from Nationwide's refusal to provide a defense to Brown. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nNationwide first argues the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to grant its motion for judgment notwithstanding the \r\n  verdict because the Respondents failed to establish Kelvin was operating Prince's \r\n  automobile with her express or implied permission. \r\n  \r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion \r\n  for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, we must consider \r\n  the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Brady Dev. \r\n  Co. v. Town of Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 439 S.E.2d 266 (1993); McGill \r\n  v. University of South Carolina, 310 S.C. 224, 423 S.E.2d 109 (1992).

Edwards, 294 S.C. 368, 364 S.E.2d 750 (1988) (The burden \r\n  is on the party seeking coverage to establish that permission was given by the \r\n  named insured.). This permission could be either express or implied. American \r\n  Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Reliance Ins. Co., 268 S.C. 310, 233 S.E.2d 114 (1977). \r\n  \"[W]hether the permission be expressly granted or impliedly conferred, it must \r\n  originate in the language or conduct of the named insured or of some one having \r\n  authority to bind her in that respect.\" Rakestraw v.

Brown clearly required Kelvin to ask permission \r\n  before he used the car. It is undisputed he did not ask permission on the night \r\n  in question. Even though Kelvin had previously used the car without permission, \r\n  this fact alone is not sufficient to infer implied permission. See State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Allstate Ins.

Munn was not entitled to compensation \r\n  for medical treatment of a condition not causally related to Munn's workers' \r\n  compensation injury. Munn appeals and we affirm. \r\n  \r\nIn 1986, Munn injured his back while \r\n  working as a crane operator for Nucor Steel. Munn was awarded permanent disability \r\n  benefits and lifetime medical treatment pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60. \r\n  Thereafter, in 1995, Munn filed a claim seeking payment for medical bills incurred \r\n  as a result of treatment for a heart condition, a condition that Munn acknowledged \r\n  was not causally related to his back injury. The single commissioner denied \r\n  Munn's claim because the medical treatment was not causally related to Munn's \r\n  original injury by accident. The full commission and the circuit court affirmed \r\n  the commissioner's findings. \r\n SCOPE OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA court may not substitute its judgment \r\n  for that of an agency as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact \r\n  unless the agency's findings are clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, \r\n  probative and substantial evidence on the whole record. Clade v. Champion \r\n  Labs., 330 S.C. 8, 496 S.E.2d 856 (1998). This court may reverse the commission \r\n  where its decision is affected by an error of law. Gilliam v. Woodside Mills, \r\n  319 S.C. 385, 461 S.E.2d 818 (1995). \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe applicable statute provides that \r\n  the employer is required to furnish: \r\n  \r\nMedical, surgical, hospital and other \r\n  treatment . . . for a period not exceeding ten weeks from the date of an injury \r\n  to effect a cure or give relief and for such additional time as in the judgment \r\n  of the Commission will tend to lessen the period of disability . . . . \r\n  \r\nIn cases in which total and permanent \r\n  disability results, reasonable and necessary nursing services, medicines, prosthetic \r\n  devices, sick travel, medical, hospital and other treatment or care shall be \r\n  paid during the life of the injured employee, without regard to any limitation \r\n  in this title including the maximum compensation limit. \r\n  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-60 (1985). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMunn argues the medical treatment \r\n  needed for his heart condition was \"reasonable and necessary\" and therefore, \r\n  compensable. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nWhether or not the legislature intended \r\n  the term \"reasonable and necessary\" to include medical treatment for unrelated \r\n  conditions or injuries is a novel issue in South Carolina. This issue, however, \r\n  has been addressed in North Carolina. Because South Carolina adopted large portions \r\n  of North Carolina's workers' compensation legislation, we give great weight \r\n  to North Carolina's decisions in workers' compensation cases. Carter v. Penney \r\n  Tire &amp; Recapping Co., 261 S.C. 341, 348, 200 S.E.2d 64, 67 (1973). \r\n  \r\nIn 1992, the North Carolina Court \r\n  of Appeals interpreted the term \"reasonable and necessary\" under a similar version \r\n  of Â§ 42-15-60 to mean that \"worker's compensation awards for continuing medical \r\n  expenses . . . contemplate only those reasonable and necessary expenses that \r\n  are related to the compensable injury or injuries.\" Errante v. Cumberland \r\n  County Solid Waste Mgt., 415 S.E.2d 583, 587 (N.C. Ct. App. 1992) (emphasis \r\n  in original). \r\n  \r\nSection 42-15-60 does not explicitly \r\n  state that the medical treatment must be causally related to the original compensable \r\n  injury. However, the statute does require the employer to furnish medical treatment \r\n  from the date of \"an injury\" and thus implies that payment for medical treatment \r\n  in cases of permanent disability would be paid only if related to the original \r\n  compensable injury. See Pearson v. JPS Converter &amp; Indus. Corp., \r\n  327 S.C. 393, 489 S.E.2d 219 (Ct. App. 1997), cert. denied, (Feb. 5, \r\n  1998) (holding that Â§ 42-15-60 permitted a permanently disabled claimant to \r\n  continue receiving medical treatment for a traumatic brain injury incurred in \r\n  the work-related accident). \r\n  \r\nFurthermore the general definition \r\n  of \"injury\" and \"personal injury\" under our workers' compensation law \"shall \r\n  mean only injury by accident arising out of and in the course of the employment \r\n  and shall not include a disease in any form, except when it results naturally \r\n  and unavoidably from the accident . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. \r\n  1998). It naturally follows that any medical treatment claimed under Â§ 42-15-60 \r\n  must be causally related to the \"injury by accident\" arising out of and in the \r\n  course of employment. Consequently, we find the only logical application of \r\n  Â§ 42-15-60 is that Munn is not entitled to additional benefits because the medical \r\n  treatment stemming from his heart condition is not causally related to the workers' \r\n  compensation injury he suffered in 1986. \r\n  \r\nMunn relies on Rice v. Froehling \r\n  &amp; Robertson, Inc., 267 S.C. 155, 226 S.E.2d 705 (1976) and Smith \r\n  v. American &amp; Effird Mills, 277 S.E.2d 83 (N.C. Ct. App. 1981) to support \r\n  his position that he is entitled to additional benefits. Both cases are distinguishable \r\n  on their facts. Unlike this case, Rice and Smith involved claimants \r\n  who sought medical treatment for injuries directly related to their original \r\n  compensable injury. These cases did not reach the issue of whether a claimant \r\n  is entitled to lifetime medical treatment where the treatment is unrelated to \r\n  the original compensable injury. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the circuit court is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHEARN and HOWARD, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2998","title":"Dorothy Yoho v.

Michael Smith, of The \r\n          Thompson Law Firm, of Myrtle Beach, for respondent. \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n  \r\nHEARN, J.: Dorothy Yoho sued \r\n  Marguerite Thompson, alleging Thompson's negligence caused injuries to her head, \r\n  neck, shoulders, and back. The jury awarded Yoho $20,000. Yoho moved for a new \r\n  trial absolute or a new trial nisi additur for $193,000, arguing the trial court \r\n  prejudiced Yoho by preventing her from mentioning liability insurance in the \r\n  trial to establish bias. The trial court denied Yoho's motion. We affirm. \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nOn May 30, 1994, Yoho sustained injuries \r\n  in an automobile accident when Thompson's car struck the rear of Yoho's car. \r\n  At the accident scene, Yoho complained of pain only in the back of her head \r\n  and elbow. However, during physical therapy, Yoho complained of cervical pain, \r\n  lumbar pain, left shoulder pain, and head pain. Yoho underwent approximately \r\n  forty to fifty physical therapy sessions and showed improvement. However, Yoho's \r\n  physician's notes reflect the following: \"Physical therapist called. [Yoho] \r\n  is not making progress. Physical therapist believes [she] will be better after \r\n  litigation settled.\" The physical therapist denies making the comment. \r\n  \r\nThompson admitted liability, making \r\n  damages the only contested issue at trial. Testimony from the two sides conflicts \r\n  regarding the extent of Yoho's injuries and the corresponding treatments. The \r\n  record reflects Yoho had already suffered back and left arm injuries prior to \r\n  the accident. \r\n  \r\nBefore trial, Thompson's liability \r\n  insurance carrier paid Yoho the policy limits of $50,000. Yoho's underinsured \r\n  motorist carrier, Nationwide Insurance Co., assumed Thompson's defense under \r\n  South Carolina's insurance law. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (Supp. 1998) (effective \r\n  June 29, 1994). \r\n  \r\nNationwide, through the Thompson \r\n  Law Firm,(1) hired Dr. Brannon to review Yoho's \r\n  medical record and to render an opinion on the severity of Yoho's injuries and \r\n  the medical treatment provided Yoho. Dr. Brannon testified Yoho received unnecessary \r\n  treatment and that Yoho might be seeking a secondary benefit from the accident. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nYoho's counsel moved to cross-examine \r\n  Dr. Brannon about his past business relationship with Nationwide to establish \r\n  potential bias. The trial judge denied the motion. Yoho's counsel proffered \r\n  a previous deposition of Dr. Brannon to illustrate the information Yoho sought \r\n  to expose at trial. Specifically, she sought to introduce Dr. Brannon's following \r\n  statement: \"I do a fair amount of consulting with Nationwide Insurance Company \r\n  and the reason for that is that I've been invited to give lectures to their \r\n  agents and their adjustors . . . .\" \r\n  \r\nOn cross-examination, Yoho established \r\n  that Thompson's attorneys hired and paid Dr. Brannon to review Yoho's medical \r\n  records and testify at trial. Yoho also showed that Dr. Brannon worked for Thompson's \r\n  attorneys on three prior occasions. \r\n  \r\nThe jury returned a $20,000 verdict \r\n  for Yoho. Yoho moved for a new trial absolute or a new trial nisi additur for \r\n  $193,000, arguing the South Carolina Rules of Evidence permit mentioning liability \r\n  insurance in a trial to establish bias. The trial court denied the motion. Yoho \r\n  appeals. \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\"Conduct of a trial, including admission \r\n  and rejection of testimony, is largely within the trial judge's sound discretion, \r\n  the exercise of which will not be disturbed on appeal unless appellant can show \r\n  abuse of such discretion, commission of legal error in its exercise, and resulting \r\n  prejudice to appellant's rights.\" American Fed. Bank v. Number One Main Joint \r\n  Venture, 321 S.C. 169, 174, 467 S.E.2d 439, 442 (1996). \"Normally, we will \r\n  not disturb on appeal a trial court's ruling concerning the scope of cross-examination \r\n  of a witness to test his credibility absent a manifest abuse of discretion.\" \r\n  State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 551, 446 S.E.2d 411, 413 (1994). \r\n  \r\nLAW \r\n  \r\nRule 411, SCRE, states: \"Evidence \r\n  that a person was or was not insured against liability is not admissible upon \r\n  the issue whether the person acted negligently or otherwise wrongfully. This \r\n  rule does not require the exclusion of evidence of insurance against liability \r\n  when offered for . . . [showing] bias or prejudice of a witness.\" Nevertheless, \r\n  \"[a]lthough relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially \r\n  outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading \r\n  the jury . . . .\" Rule 403, SCRE. \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nYoho argues the trial court prejudiced \r\n  her case by improperly denying her the opportunity to cross-examine Dr. Brannon \r\n  about his relationship with Nationwide to establish Dr. Brannon's bias. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nYoho failed to establish prejudice \r\n  because she had alternative means to establish Dr. Brannon's bias or prejudice \r\n  without inquiring into his association with Nationwide. See Danny R. \r\n  Collins, South Carolina Evidence, 94-95 (1995) (noting witnesses may \r\n  be attacked for bias when the witness engaged in other litigation with one of \r\n  the parties or the witness has a past relationship with one of the parties). \r\n  The trial judge even instructed Yoho on these methods to reveal Dr. Brannon's \r\n  bias, such as inquiring into Thompson's attorney's hiring and paying Dr. Brannon \r\n  and cross-examining Dr. Brannon about his reviewing files and testifying regularly \r\n  for defendants as opposed to plaintiffs. These lines of questioning permit an \r\n  inference of bias but avoid the prejudicial problems associated with mentioning \r\n  insurance. \r\n  \r\nOur \"Supreme Court has been meticulous \r\n  in keeping the issue of insurance coverage away from the jury.\" Norris v. \r\n  Ferre, 315 S.C. 179, 182, 432 S.E.2d 491, 493 (Ct. App. 1993); Dunn v. \r\n  Charleston Coca-Cola Bottling Co., 311 S.C. 43, 45, 426 S.E.2d 756, 757 \r\n  (1993) (\"'The long-established rule of our decisions is that the fact that a \r\n  defendant is protected from liability in an action for damages by insurance \r\n  shall not be made known to the jury.'\" (quoting Crocker v. Weathers, \r\n  240 S.C. 412, 424, 126 S.E.2d 335, 340-41 (1962))). \r\n  \r\nThis court addressed a similar case \r\n  in which the plaintiff sought to introduce the liability insurance clause of \r\n  a landscaping agreement to establish the duties the defendant owed. We held \r\n  \"the trial court did not err in excluding the liability insurance clause because, \r\n  even if the clause was relevant to the question of duty, the prejudicial effect \r\n  of its admission would have far outweighed any possible probative value that \r\n  it might have had.\" Landry v. Hilton Head Plantation Property Owners Ass'n, \r\n  317 S.C. 200, 206, 452 S.E.2d 619, 622 (Ct. App. 1994). Moreover, other contractual \r\n  provisions established the opposing party's duties. Id. at 205, 452 S.E.2d \r\n  at 622. Similarly, Yoho had alternative ways to show Dr. Brannon's bias without \r\n  interjecting the issue of insurance into the cross-examination, and the prejudicial \r\n  effect of its admission substantially outweighed the probative value of the \r\n  evidence. \r\n  \r\nThis court also affirmed a trial \r\n  court's limitations on the cross-examination of an expert witness in Johnson \r\n  v. Ward, 288 S.C. 603, 344 S.E.2d 166 (Ct. App. 1986), overruled on other \r\n  grounds by Spahn v. Town of Port Royal, 330 S.C. 168, 499 S.E.2d \r\n  205 (1998). In Johnson the trial court did not allow plaintiff's counsel \r\n  to cross-examine the expert about the expert's prior relationship with the defendant's \r\n  attorneys to show bias. On appeal, this court held that appellant failed to \r\n  prove a manifest abuse of discretion by the trial judge and prejudice to appellant, \r\n  both of which are required for reversal. Id. at 611-12, 344 S.E.2d at \r\n  171. In comparison, Yoho sought to question Dr. Brannon's prior relationship \r\n  with the insurance company, evidence which is more prejudicial than a relationship \r\n  with attorneys involved in the case. \r\n  \r\nConsidering the potential for unfair \r\n  prejudice, for confusion of the issues, and for misleading the jury, the trial \r\n  court acted within its discretion in ruling that the probative value of raising \r\n  the insurance issue was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. \r\n  See Rule 403, SCRE. We find the trial court did not abuse its discretion \r\n  in limiting Yoho's cross-examination of Dr. Brannon to exclude any mention of \r\n  insurance. \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, the trial court's decision \r\n  denying Yoho's request to cross-examine Dr. Brannon on his relationship with \r\n  Nationwide is \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nHUFF and STILWELL, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n1.  At oral argument, \r\n  counsel for Nationwide argued that he, not Nationwide, retained Dr. Brannon \r\n  because of counsel's desire to avoid the very inference Yoho sought to introduce. \r\n  We do not see any distinction in whether this party or its agent actually called, \r\n  retained, and paid Dr. Brannon. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"2999","title":"Bart Eric Alley, et al. v.

Mother appeals an order \r\n  of the family court finding she wilfully failed to visit and support her child \r\n  for six months. We reverse. \r\n  \r\nFACTS \r\n  \r\nMother and Father were married in \r\n  June of 1994. They are the natural parents of Christopher Steven Boyd, Jr. (Child), \r\n  born January 12, 1995. Mother and Father separated in June or July of 1995. \r\n  In March of 1996, they consented to give custody of Child to Eric and Jill Alley.(1) \r\n  The family court approved an agreement granting the Alleys custody with reasonable \r\n  visitation for the natural parents. The agreement specifically provided \"that \r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Alley will not seek child support or attorney fees from Mr. and \r\n  Mrs. Boyd.\" Therefore, no support was ordered.(2) \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe Alleys brought this action for \r\n  termination of parental rights and adoption in April of 1997. Father consented \r\n  to the adoption. Mother denied her rights should be terminated and counterclaimed \r\n  for custody. \r\n  \r\nAt the merits hearing, the Alleys \r\n  testified Child had spent most of his time with them, even before Mother agreed \r\n  to the change of custody. Additionally, Child had lived with them continuously \r\n  since the March 1996 custody agreement. While the Alleys had custody of Child, \r\n  Mother visited him at least every six to eight weeks and, on at least one occasion, \r\n  stayed for three hours. After the filing of this action, the Alleys allowed \r\n  Mother only supervised visitation.(3) \r\n  \r\nThe family court granted the Alleys' \r\n  petition for termination of parental rights and approved their request for adoption. \r\n  In support of its decision, the judge found Mother's visits with Child were \r\n  \"minor contacts\" and not \"visitation\" within the meaning of the termination \r\n  of parental rights statute. Also, he held Mother had not \"made any material \r\n  contributions to the child's care\" despite her \"ability to work.\" \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n  \r\nA ground for termination of parental \r\n  rights must be proved by clear and convincing evidence. Richland County Dep't \r\n  of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998). In reviewing \r\n  a termination of parental rights, the appellate court has the authority to review \r\n  the record and make its own findings of whether clear and convincing evidence \r\n  supports the termination. Earles, 330 S.C. at 32, 496 S.E.2d at 868; \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Brown, 317 S.C. 332, 454 S.E.2d \r\n  335 (Ct. App. 1995). \"Statutes providing for the termination of parental rights \r\n  are to be strictly construed in favor of the parent and the preservation of \r\n  the relationship of parent and child.\" Leone v. Dilullo, 294 S.C. 410, \r\n  413, 365 S.E.2d 39, 40 (Ct. App. 1988) (citing Goff v. Benedict, 252 \r\n  S.C. 83, 165 S.E.2d 269 (1969)); see Horton v. Vaughn, 309 S.C. \r\n  383, 423 S.E.2d 543 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nOn appeal, Mother contends the evidence \r\n  was insufficient to support termination of her parental rights.(4) \r\n  She argues she neither wilfully failed to visit nor support Child. \r\n  \r\nPursuant to South Carolina Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 1998), the family court may order the termination of parental \r\n  rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and finding that \r\n  termination is in the best interest of the child(5): \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3) The child has lived outside of \r\n  the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the \r\n  parent has wilfully failed to visit the child. The court may attach little or \r\n  no weight to incidental visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was \r\n  not prevented from visiting by the party having custody or by court order. The \r\n  distance of the child's placement from the parent's home must be taken into \r\n  consideration when determining the ability to visit. \r\n  \r\n(4) The child has lived outside the \r\n  home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent \r\n  has wilfully failed to support the child. Failure to support means that the \r\n  parent has failed to make a material contribution to the child's care. A material \r\n  contribution consists of either financial contributions according to the parent's \r\n  means or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for \r\n  the care of the child according to the parent's means. The court may consider \r\n  all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully \r\n  failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian \r\n  and the ability of the parent to provide support. \r\n  \r\nWhether a parent's failure to visit \r\n  or support a child is \"wilful\" within the meaning of section 20-7-1572 is a \r\n  question of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case. \r\n  South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 52, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  835, 838 (1992). Generally, the family court is given wide discretion in making \r\n  this determination. However, the element of wilfulness must be established by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence. Id. \"Conduct of the parent which evinces \r\n  a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as 'willful' \r\n  because it manifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to \r\n  receive support and consortium from the parent.\" Id. at 53, 413 S.E.2d \r\n  at 839; Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 S.E.2d 536 (1975); Horton \r\n  v. Vaughn, 309 S.C. 383, 423 S.E.2d 543 (Ct. App. 1992). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Failure to Visit \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAs stated, the family court determined \r\n  Mother's visitations with the Child were merely \"incidental,\" and, therefore, \r\n  attached little or no weight to them. \r\n  \r\nGenerally, \"incidental\" means \"depending \r\n  upon or appertaining to something else as primary; something necessary, appertaining \r\n  to, or depending upon another which is termed the principal; something incidental \r\n  to the main purpose.\" Horton, 309 S.C. at 387, 423 S.E.2d at 545 (quoting \r\n  Archambault v. Sprouse, 218 S.C. 500, 507, 63 S.E.2d 459, 462 (1951)). \r\n  Because the family court may attach little or no weight to \"incidental\" visitations \r\n  in actions for termination of parental rights, parents may not rely upon fortuitous \r\n  meetings between the parent and child as a defense against an abandonment claim. \r\n  Horton, 309 S.C. at 387, 423 S.E.2d at 545. The question of whether a \r\n  parent's visitations with a child are \"incidental\" in nature must be viewed \r\n  in light of the attendant circumstances. See Wilson v. Higgins, \r\n  294 S.C. 300, 363 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 1987) (The question of abandonment is \r\n  one of intent to be determined by the facts and circumstances of each case.). \r\n  \r\n  \r\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances, \r\n  clear and convincing evidence does not demonstrate Mother wilfully failed to \r\n  visit Child, especially in light of our duty to strictly construe the statute \r\n  in Mother's favor. It is undisputed Mother visited Child within six months of \r\n  the filing of the termination action. In fact, she had exercised visitation \r\n  with the child every six to eight weeks. The facts do not support the family \r\n  court's determination these visits were incidental. They were planned, not fortuitous. \r\n  In summary, the evidence simply does not indicate Mother evidenced a \"settled \r\n  purpose to forgo [her] parental [relationship]\" with Child. Leone v. Dilullo, \r\n  294 S.C. 410, 413, 365 S.E.2d 39, 41 (Ct. App. 1988).(6) \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\nII. Failure to \r\n  Support \r\n  \r\nFurthermore, the record does not \r\n  sustain the family court's conclusion Mother wilfully failed to support Child. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nMother acknowledged she did not make \r\n  any direct financial contributions towards Child's care prior to the filing \r\n  of this action. She did, however, give Child birthday and Christmas gifts. Most \r\n  importantly, it appears Mother relied on the custody agreement in which the \r\n  Alleys specifically acknowledged they would not seek child support from her. \r\n  Moreover, they never asked her or the court for support. \r\n  \r\nParticularly in light of the \"non-support\" \r\n  provision in the custody order, we find no wilful intent in Mother's failure \r\n  to pay child support. The record does not show she forewent her parental duties \r\n  by consciously ignoring Child's right to receive support from her. Leone, \r\n  294 S.C. at 413, 365 S.E.2d at 41. \r\n  \r\nIn light of our disposition of the \r\n  above issues, we decline to address Mother's remaining issues on appeal. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nAccordingly, we reverse the family \r\n  court's decision to terminate Mother's parental rights. Because Mother has not \r\n  appealed the determination of custody, custody remains with the Alleys. Mother, \r\n  however, may continue to visit Child. \r\n  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision \r\n  of the family court is \r\n  \r\nREVERSED. \r\n \r\nHOWELL, C.J. and GOOLSBY, J., \r\n  concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.  Jill Alley \r\n  is Mother's distant cousin. \r\n2.  This agreement \r\n  was not binding on the Alleys had they decided to seek child support from the \r\n  court. Peebles v. Disher, 279 S.C. 611, 310 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1983). \r\n  \r\n3.  Jill Alley \r\n  agreed Mother was not \"unfit.\" \r\n4.  Mother does \r\n  not appeal the custody determination. \r\n5.  Effective \r\n  January 1, 1997, a family court judge is required to make the additional finding \r\n  that termination is in the best interest of the child. S.C Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 \r\n  (Supp. 1998); Hooper v. Rockwell, Op. No. 24907 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  Feb. 22, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 8 at 22, 32 n.6). Because the Alleys \r\n  filed this action on April 17, 1997, the family court judge's decision was controlled \r\n  by the amended version of the statute. In his order, the family court judge \r\n  specifically found the termination was in the best interest of the child. \r\n6.  Furthermore, \r\n  Mother's visitation was restricted by the Alleys' decision to allow only supervised \r\n  visitation after this action was filed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3000","title":"State v.

The sole \r\n  question on appeal is whether Peterson could be convicted of burglary \r\n  \r\nbecause the jury failed to convict \r\n  him of the crime that the State offered proof he intended \r\nto commit at the time of breaking \r\n  and entering. We affirm.(1) \r\n  \r\nThe charges against Peterson arose \r\n  out of an incident that allegedly occurred in the victim's residence during \r\n  the early morning hours. The victim testified that Peterson entered her home \r\n  without her consent and sexually attacked her in her bedroom after she awoke \r\n  and found him there. \r\n  \r\nFirst-degree burglary consists of \r\n  the following elements: (1) entry into a dwelling house; (2) without consent; \r\n  (3) with the intent to commit a crime therein; and (4) at least one of a number \r\n  of additional circumstances being present. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311 (Cum. \r\n  Supp. 1998). Here, the focus centers only upon the third element. \r\n  \r\nThe fact that the jury failed to \r\n  convict Peterson of the sexual assault charge does not affect the validity of \r\n  the burglary charge. Indeed, that fact is immaterial. See 13 Am. Jur. \r\n  2d Burglary Â§ 25, at 223 (1964) (\"Except as modified by statute, consummation \r\n  or execution of the intent to steal or commit some felony is not necessary to \r\n  complete the crime of burglary\"); 12A C.J.S. Burglary Â§ 41, at 239 (1980) \r\n  (\"The controlling intent is that of the time when the burglarious entry was \r\n  committed . . . .\"); id. Â§ 42, at 240 (\"To constitute burglary it is \r\n  not necessary that the intended crime shall be committed . . . as the offense \r\n  is complete as soon as the premises are broken and entered or entered alone \r\n  with the necessary intent, and the success or failure of the venture is immaterial\"); \r\n  see also Brown v. State, 429 So. 839 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1983) \r\n  (the defendant's acquittal on robbery and sexual battery charges was not inconsistent \r\n  with his conviction of the charge of entering a dwelling with the intent to \r\n  commit a robbery and a sexual battery); State v. Melton, 189 S.E.2d 757, \r\n  758 (N.C. App. 1972) (where the court sustained the defendant's conviction of \r\n  felonious breaking and entering where the defendant was acquitted of the felonious \r\n  larceny charge, stating, \"It is immaterial that defendant was acquitted of larceny\"); \r\n  cf. State v. Amerson, 244 S.C. 374, 375, 137 S.E.2d 284, 286 (1964) \r\n  (upholding the defendant's conviction for housebreaking notwithstanding his \r\n  acquittal of grand larceny, stating \"It is not essential to the crime of housebreaking \r\n  that one commit grand larceny. It is sufficient that the one breaking and entering \r\n  did so with the intent to commit any crime\"). \r\n  \r\n Here, the State offered proof of \r\n  Peterson's intent at the time he broke and entered the victim's home. The victim \r\n  testified that Peterson grabbed her and covered her mouth; that he was wearing \r\n  gloves; that he threw her on her bed; that he choked her; that he was \"humping\" \r\n  her; that he suggested she cooperate; that she screamed for help; that he told \r\n  her to be quiet so that her child would not wake up; and that when the child \r\n  did awaken and began crying, Peterson released the victim and ran away. \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCONNOR and HEARN, JJ., concur. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n1.

Moore, a family friend, had picked Tyndall \r\n  up at his home in Cherryvale and taken him to his father's home for a visit. \r\n  \r\nChief Allen and Sergeant Wylie Tiller, \r\n  Jr., responded to Moore's call. Moore was outside the house when the officers \r\n  arrived. She informed Chief Allen that Tyndall had threatened to kill her and \r\n  his father. Tyndall's father, who was in poor health and required a wheelchair \r\n  and oxygen, was in the kitchen. He was frightened, upset, and crying. Once inside, \r\n  the officers, with their straight batons drawn, entered the small den off the \r\n  kitchen where Tyndall was located. \r\n  \r\nChief Allen told Tyndall his father \r\n  wanted him to leave and that if he did not comply, he would be placed under \r\n  arrest for trespass after notice. Tyndall refused to leave. Chief Allen stated: \r\n  \"[Y]ou're under arrest for trespassing after notice. Turn around, put your hands \r\n  behind your back.\" Tyndall reached under the couch cushion, withdrew a hammer, \r\n  and started swinging it. The officers backed up toward the kitchen and asked \r\n  Tyndall to put the hammer down. \r\n  \r\nTyndall ran at the officers while \r\n  brandishing the flat side of the hammer and threatening to kill them. Chief \r\n  Allen yelled \"go to guns\" and attempted to push Sergeant Tiller into the kitchen. \r\n  Tyndall struck Tiller on the right side of the head with the hammer. As the \r\n  hammer bounced off of Tiller, it hit Allen's hand. During this time, Tyndall \r\n  was saying: \"I'm going to kill ya'll. You know, I'm going to kill somebody here \r\n  today. I'm going to kill ya'll today.\" Tyndall turned the hammer to the \"claw\" \r\n  side and was preparing to strike again when Chief Allen drew his gun and fired \r\n  at Tyndall's thigh. However, Allen's gun jammed. \r\n  \r\nSergeant Tiller heard Chief Allen's \r\n  gun misfire. Tiller fired his gun into the den about three times, striking Tyndall \r\n  in the legs. Allen corrected his gun and fired a couple of shots into Tyndall's \r\n  legs while warning him to stop swinging the hammer. Chief Allen pointed his \r\n  firearm directly at Tyndall's head and warned him a final time to drop the hammer. \r\n  Tyndall fell to the floor. Chief Allen kicked the hammer away from Tyndall's \r\n  hand and the hammer landed close to the den wall. Chief Allen later \"signed \r\n  a warrant charging [Tyndall] with resisting arrest while being arrested for \r\n  trespass after notice.\" \r\n  \r\nMoore had followed the officers into \r\n  the house and was attending to Tyndall's father in the kitchen. She claimed \r\n  she did not hear words exchanged between the officers and Tyndall. When she \r\n  heard gunfire, she pushed Tyndall's father, in his wheelchair, behind the refrigerator \r\n  and went out the back door. After Tyndall was shot, Moore applied bandages and \r\n  pressure to his gunshot wounds. Although Moore testified she did not see a hammer \r\n  on the floor at this time or at any time \r\n  during the evening's events, she had seen Tyndall threaten his father with a \r\n  hammer on a prior occasion. \r\n  \r\nOfficer Dana Wingate, the crime scene \r\n  investigator, observed the hammer lying on the floor. Before the crime scene \r\n  photographers arrived, Officer Wingate removed the hammer from the floor, apparently \r\n  for safety purposes, and placed it in his car. He mistakenly forgot to include \r\n  the hammer in the crime scene diagram. \r\n  \r\nThomas Taylor, a police instructor \r\n  with experience in crime scene investigation, explained the standard procedure \r\n  for securing the crime scene would not normally include removing the weapon \r\n  from the crime scene. According to Taylor, removal of any item would contaminate \r\n  a crime scene. \r\n  \r\nTyndall was charged with two counts \r\n  of attempted murder, two counts of assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), \r\n  and one count of resisting arrest. He was tried on the resisting arrest charge \r\n  and the two ABIK charges. Tyndall moved to dismiss all charges because he was \r\n  never arrested or prosecuted for trespass after notice. The court denied the \r\n  motion. The judge charged the jury as to ABIK and the lesser included offense \r\n  of ABHAN, but refused to charge the law of simple assault and battery. \r\n  \r\nTyndall was convicted of resisting \r\n  arrest and two counts of ABHAN. The judge denied Tyndall's motion to set aside \r\n  the verdict and grant a new trial. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\nI. Did the trial court err in failing \r\n  to dismiss the charge of resisting arrest? \r\n  \r\nII. Did the trial court err in refusing \r\n  to charge simple assault and battery? \r\n  \r\n  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n  \r\nI. Resisting Arrest \r\n  Charge \r\n  \r\nTyndall contends the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to dismiss the charge of resisting arrest. Specifically, he \r\n  argues he did not unlawfully resist arrest (1) because \"[n]o judicial determination \r\n  was made as to the probable cause to arrest for Trespass after Notice\"; (2) \r\n  because, as owner and co-occupant of the house, it was legally impossible for \r\n  him to be arrested for trespass after notice; and (3) because he was never charged \r\n  or prosecuted for trespass after notice, the underlying offense. We disagree. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTyndall was convicted of violating \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-320(B) (Supp. 1998), which provides: \r\n  \r\nIt is unlawful for a person to knowingly \r\n  and wilfully assault, beat, or wound a law enforcement officer engaged in serving, \r\n  executing, or attempting to serve or execute a legal writ or process or to assault, \r\n  beat, or wound an officer when the person is resisting an arrest being made \r\n  by one whom the person knows or reasonably should know is a law enforcement \r\n  officer, whether under process or not. A person who violates the provisions \r\n  of this subsection is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined \r\n  not less than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars or imprisoned \r\n  not more than ten years, or both. \r\n  \r\nA. Probable Cause \r\n  to Arrest \r\n  \r\nTyndall alleges that, because no \r\n  judicial determination was made as to the officers' probable cause to arrest \r\n  him for trespass after notice, \"the actions taken by the officers were absent \r\n  probable cause and contrary\" to Brinegar v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, \r\n  69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), Beck v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. \r\n  223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964), and Illinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 \r\n  S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983). \r\nA police officer may, without a warrant, \r\n  arrest a person who commits a misdemeanor in his presence. See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-13-30 (1985); Summersell v. South Carolina Dep't of Pub. Safety, \r\n  Op. No. 2934 (S.C. Ct. App. filed February 1, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 5 \r\n  at 22). See also State v. Mims, 263 S.C. 45, 208 S.E.2d 288 (1974)(officer \r\n  has power and authority to arrest without warrant those who have committed violation \r\n  of criminal laws of this State within view of such officer). \r\n  \r\nContrary to Tyndall's arguments, \r\n  he did commit the crime prohibited by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-620 (Supp. 1998), \r\n  commonly known as criminal trespass or trespass after notice. Section 16-11-620 \r\n  reads in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\nAny person who, without legal cause \r\n  or good excuse, enters into the dwelling house, place of business, or on the \r\n  premises of another person after having been warned not to do so or any person \r\n  who, having entered into the dwelling house, place of business, or on the premises \r\n  of another person without having been warned fails and refuses, without good \r\n  cause or good excuse, to leave immediately upon being ordered or requested to \r\n  do so by the person in possession or his agent or representative shall, on conviction, \r\n  be fined not more than two hundred dollars or be imprisoned for not more than \r\n  thirty days (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\nTrespass after notice is a misdemeanor. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-10(C) (Supp. 1998)(all offenses with term of \r\n  imprisonment of less than one year are misdemeanors). \r\n  \r\nThe record reflects Tyndall resided \r\n  in Cherryvale at the time of the altercation with his father. Moore picked him \r\n  up from his home and drove him to his father's residence for a visit. Tyndall's \r\n  claim that he resided in the same home as his father on the day in question \r\n  is unsubstantiated. When the police arrived, Tyndall's father told them to ask \r\n  Tyndall to leave, which the officers did. By refusing to leave upon request, \r\n  Tyndall committed the crime of trespass after notice. See State v. \r\n  Cross, 323 S.C. 41, 448 S.E.2d 569 (Ct. App. 1994). Because Tyndall committed \r\n  this crime in the presence of the police officers, they had the power and authority \r\n  to arrest Tyndall without a warrant. There was no requirement for a judicial \r\n  determination as to probable cause to arrest for trespass after notice. \r\n  \r\nIn a one sentence reference to Brinegar \r\n  v. United States, 338 U.S. 160, 69 S.Ct. 1302, 93 L.Ed. 1879 (1949), Beck \r\n  v. Ohio, 379 U.S. 89, 85 S.Ct. 223, 13 L.Ed.2d 142 (1964), and Illinois \r\n  v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 103 S.Ct. 2317, 76 L.Ed.2d 527 (1983), Tyndall avers \r\n  the actions of the officers were in contrariety to these cases. Thereafter, \r\n  Tyndall makes no reference to Brinegar, Beck, or Gates \r\n  in his brief. He does not include in his argument any discussion of these decisions \r\n  or their applicability to his situation. Conclusory arguments constitute an \r\n  abandonment of the issue on appeal. See Solomon v. City Realty Co., \r\n  262 S.C. 198, 203 S.E.2d 435 (1974)(where only passage in brief relating to \r\n  issue appealed was single conclusory statement which left \"unargued the error \r\n  assigned by [the] exception\" and was not even \"manifestly correct,\" issue was \r\n  held abandoned). Here, Tyndall does not abandon the basic issue. However, his \r\n  reliance upon the cases of Brinegar, Beck, and Gates \r\n  is deemed abandoned. See Cannon v. Cannon, 321 S.C. 44, 467 S.E.2d \r\n  132 (Ct. App. 1996)(issue not argued in brief is deemed abandoned on appeal); \r\n  Stier, Kent &amp; Canady, Inc. v. Jackson, 317 S.C. 179, 452 S.E.2d 606 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1994)(where only argument in appellants' brief regarding issue appeared \r\n  once in footnote and no authority was cited, argument was so conclusory as to \r\n  be deemed abandonment of issue on appeal). Additionally, although Brinegar, \r\n  Beck, and Gates articulate rules in reference to probable cause, \r\n  the principles encapsulated therein have no applicability to the case sub \r\n  judice. \r\n  \r\nB. Owner of Property \r\n  \r\n  \r\nTyndall maintains that because he \r\n  is the title owner of the home in which his father resides he could not be guilty \r\n  of trespassing on his own property. We disagree. \r\n  \r\nInitially, we note Tyndall has not \r\n  provided this Court with a copy of a deed proving his ownership of the property \r\n  in question. Included in the record on appeal is a copy of his motion to set \r\n  aside the verdict. In that motion, Tyndall alleged the property belongs to him \r\n  and parenthetically noted a deed was attached to the motion. We have been provided \r\n  with no copy of any attachment which may have accompanied this motion. An appellant \r\n  has a \r\n  \r\nduty to provide this Court with a \r\n  record sufficient for review of the issues on appeal. State v. Mitchell, \r\n  330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d 642 (1998). \r\n  \r\nMoreover, regardless of who owned \r\n  the property on the date in question, the home was Tyndall's father's \"dwelling \r\n  house.\" The language of section 16-11-620 does not exclude an owner from \r\n  the class of persons who may be convicted of trespass after notice. The section \r\n  provides that \"[a]ny person\" who violates the statute may be convicted. \r\n  A record owner's right to be on the property may be circumscribed if another \r\n  person peaceably possesses the property. For example, the South Carolina Residential \r\n  Landlord and Tenant Act restricts the access of a landlord, even one who is \r\n  the owner, to property in the possession of a tenant. See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 27-40-530 (1991)(restricting a landlord's access to property in possession \r\n  of a tenant); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 27-40-210(6) (1991)(\"'landlord' means the owner \r\n  . . .\"). Because Tyndall refused to leave his father's home after being asked \r\n  to do so, the police officers acted within the scope of their power when they \r\n  arrested him without a warrant for trespass after notice. \r\n  \r\nC. Failure to Prosecute \r\n  Tyndall for Trespass After Notice \r\n  \r\nTyndall claims his conviction for \r\n  resisting arrest cannot stand because he was never charged or prosecuted for \r\n  the underlying offense for which he was being arrested. This contention is meritless. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nSection 16-9-320, the resisting arrest \r\n  statute, does not mandate the underlying arrest be prosecuted as a prerequisite \r\n  for the indictment, prosecution, or conviction of resisting arrest. Furthermore, \r\n  as our Supreme Court explained in State v. Thrift, 312 S.C. 282, 440 \r\n  S.E.2d 341 (1994): \r\n  \r\nBoth the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  and South Carolina case law place the unfettered discretion to prosecute solely \r\n  in the prosecutor's hands. . . . Prosecutors may pursue a case to trial, or \r\n  they may plea bargain it down to a lesser offense, or they can simply decide \r\n  not to prosecute the offense in its entirety. The Judicial Branch is not empowered \r\n  to infringe on the exercise of this prosecutorial discretion. \r\n  \r\nThrift, 312 S.C. at 291-92, \r\n  440 S.E.2d at 346-47 (footnotes omitted). See also S.C. Const. art. V, \r\n  Â§ 24; McLeod v. Snipes, 266 S.C. 415, 223 S.E.2d 853 (1976); State \r\n  v. Becka, 333 S.C. 676, 511 S.E.2d 396 (Ct. App. 1999). The fact that Tyndall \r\n  was never indicted or tried for trespass after notice cannot serve as a bar \r\n  to his prosecution for resisting the arrest. \r\n  \r\nIn addition, Tyndall contends S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-50 (Supp. 1998) requires the State to file \"the necessary \r\n  documents for prosecution of the underlying offense of Trespass after Notice.\" \r\n  There is no such requirement in section 17-13-50. This section states: \r\n  \r\n(A) A person arrested by virtue of \r\n  process or taken into custody by an officer in this State has a right to know \r\n  from the officer who arrests or claims to detain him the true ground on which \r\n  the arrest is made. It is unlawful for an officer to: \r\n  \r\n(1) refuse to answer a question relative \r\n  to the reason for the arrest; \r\n  \r\n(2) answer the question untruly; \r\n  \r\n  \r\n(3) assign to the person arrested \r\n  an untrue reason for the arrest; or \r\n  \r\n(4) neglect on request to exhibit \r\n  to the person arrested or any other person acting in his behalf the precept \r\n  by virtue of which the arrest is made. \r\n  \r\n(B) An officer who violates the provisions \r\n  of this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be fined in \r\n  the discretion of the court or imprisoned not more than ten years, or both. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nThe gravamen of this statute relates \r\n  to the right to be informed of the ground of arrest. Under this code provision, \r\n  an officer has a duty to respond to an arrestee by answering questions relating \r\n  to the arrest. There is no mention of any filing requirement under this law. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nD. Double Jeopardy \r\n  Analysis \r\n  \r\nAlthough not argued, we note for \r\n  the edification of the Bench and Bar that our Supreme Court has concluded a \r\n  person may be convicted of ABHAN and resisting arrest under a factual and legal \r\n  scenario with similitude. Because of the reoccurring prosecutions for ABHAN \r\n  and resisting arrest in General Sessions court, Stevenson v. State, Op. \r\n  No. 24940 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 3, 1999)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 16 at 1), \r\n  provides procedural guidance. Stevenson explicates: \r\n  \r\nPetitioner claims under State \r\n  v. Hollman, 232 S.C. 489, 102 S.E.2d 873 (1958) his convictions for ABHAN \r\n  and resisting arrest violate the prohibition against multiple punishments under \r\n  the Double Jeopardy Clause. The Hollman Court held convictions for resisting \r\n  arrest and ABHAN constituted a violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause. The \r\n  Court stated the assault on the officer was \"the essence of, and inseparable \r\n  from, the resistance of arrest.\" In Hollman, the Court went beyond the \r\n  required elements of each offense and considered the actual proof offered at \r\n  trial in reaching its decision. Therefore, the Hollman Court did not \r\nstrictly apply the Blockburger \"same elements\" test. \r\nHowever, because the Hollman \r\n  court applied the incorrect analysis, we expressly overrule its holding. Instead, \r\n  under the Blockburger \"same elements\" test, convictions for both ABHAN \r\n  and resisting arrest do not constitute a double jeopardy violation. \r\n  \r\nABHAN requires proof of an unlawful \r\n  act of violent injury to the person of another, accompanied by circumstances \r\n  of aggravation. State v. Easler, supra; State v. Jones, \r\n  133 S.C. 167, 130 S.E. 747 (1925), overruled in part on other grounds, \r\n  State v. Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996). The offense of resisting \r\n  arrest requires proof that a person knowingly and wilfully assaulted, beat or \r\n  wounded a law enforcement officer during an arrest when the person resisting \r\n  knew or should have known the officer was a law enforcement officer. S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-9-320(B) (Supp. 1998). \r\n  \r\nABHAN requires proof of a circumstance \r\n  of aggravation which is not required for resisting arrest. Resisting arrest \r\n  requires proof that the person assaulted is a law enforcement officer which \r\n  is not an element of ABHAN. Accordingly, because each requires proof of an element \r\n  the other does not, neither is a lesser included offense of the other and the \r\n  double jeopardy clause is not violated by convicting a defendant of both offenses. \r\n  \r\n  \r\nStevenson at 4-5 (footnotes \r\n  omitted). \r\n  \r\nII. Simple Assault \r\n  and Battery/Lesser Included Offense \r\n  \r\nTyndall was convicted of two counts \r\n  of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature. He complains the trial \r\n  court erred in failing to charge the jury as to the lesser included offense \r\n  of simple assault and battery. As a basis for this argument, he claims the jury \r\n  could have concluded from the trial testimony that no hammer was used.(2) \r\n  We find no error. \r\n  \r\nTyndall was prosecuted on two counts \r\n  of ABIK. The judge charged the jury as to (1) ABIK; and (2) ABHAN. Assault and \r\n  battery with intent to kill is an unlawful act of violent nature to the person \r\n  of another with malice aforethought, either express or implied. State v. \r\n  Foust, 325 S.C. 12, 479 S.E.2d 50 (1996). Assault and battery of a high \r\n  and aggravated nature is an unlawful act of violent injury to another accompanied \r\n  by circumstances of aggravation. State v. Murphy, 322 S.C. 321, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  739 (Ct. App. 1996). Examples of circumstances of aggravation include the use \r\n  of a deadly weapon, the infliction of serious bodily injury, the intent to commit \r\n  a felony, great disparity between the ages and physical conditions of the parties \r\n  involved, and the difference in the sexes. Id. Other circumstances include \r\n  indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, the purposeful infliction \r\n  of shame and disgrace, and resistance to lawful authority. Id. \"In contrast, \r\n  'simple assault and battery' is an unlawful act of violent injury to another, \r\n  unaccompanied by any circumstances of aggravation.\" State v. Sprouse, \r\n  325 S.C. 275, 285-86, 478 S.E.2d 871, 877 (Ct. App. 1996). Simple assault and \r\n  battery is a lesser included offense of ABHAN. See State v. Rucker, \r\n  319 S.C. 95, 459 S.E.2d 858 (Ct. App. 1995). \r\n  \r\nUpon indictment for a greater offense, \r\n  a trial court has subject matter jurisdiction to convict a defendant for any \r\n  lesser included offense. See Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, \r\n  465 S.E.2d 358 (1995). A lesser included offense instruction is required only \r\n  when the evidence warrants such an instruction, and it is not error to refuse \r\n  to charge the lesser included offense unless there is evidence tending to show \r\n  the defendant was guilty only of the lesser offense. Murphy, supra. \r\n  See also Sprouse, supra (trial judge is required to charge \r\n  jury on lesser included offense if there is evidence from which it could be \r\n  inferred defendant committed lesser, rather than greater offense). The trial \r\n  court should refuse to charge a lesser included offense where there is no evidence \r\n  the defendant committed the lesser rather than the greater offense. State \r\n  v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996); State v. Smith, 315 \r\n  S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994). Due process requires that a lesser included \r\n  offense be charged when the evidence warrants it but only if the evidence would \r\n  permit a jury rationally to find the defendant guilty of the lesser offense. \r\n  State v. Small, 307 S.C. 92, 413 S.E.2d 870 (Ct. App. 1992). In order \r\n  to justify a charge of a lesser included offense, the evidence must be capable \r\n  of sustaining either the greater or the lesser offense, depending on the jury's \r\n  view of the facts. Id. \r\n  \r\nTyndall's reliance upon State \r\n  v. Wiggins, 262 S.C. 517, 205 S.E.2d 833 (1974), and State v. Moore, \r\n  245 S.C. 416, 140 S.E.2d 779 (1965), is misplaced. In Wiggins and Moore, \r\n  the testimony at trial posited an issue for the jury to determine whether the \r\n  assault and battery was simple or aggravated. \r\n  \r\nThe possibility that the jury might \r\n  have disbelieved the State's evidence as to the circumstances of aggravation \r\n  and on the remaining evidence found the defendant guilty of simple assault and \r\n  battery does not entitle the defendant to have the lesser offense submitted \r\n  to the jury. State v. Foxworth, 269 S.C. 496, 238 S.E.2d 172 (1977). \r\n  See also State v. Funchess, 267 S.C. 427, 229 S.E.2d 331 (1976)(presence \r\n  of evidence to sustain crime of a lesser degree determines whether it should \r\n  be submitted to the jury and mere contention that jury might accept State's \r\n  evidence in part and might reject it in part will not suffice). No instruction \r\n  should be given by the trial judge, at the request of the defendant, which tenders \r\n  an issue not presented or supported by the evidence. State v. Weaver, \r\n  265 S.C. 130, 217 S.E.2d 31 (1975). \r\n  \r\nIn view of the evidence presented \r\n  in this case, the trial judge did not err in denying Tyndall's request to charge \r\n  the lesser included offense of simple assault and battery. The evidence shows \r\n  Tyndall resisted the officers' \"lawful authority,\" an aggravating circumstance \r\n  of ABHAN. There is no evidence tending to show Tyndall was guilty only of simple \r\n  assault and battery. The only reasonable inference to be drawn from the totality \r\n  of the evidence is that Tyndall committed the offense under circumstances of \r\n  aggravation. \r\n  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe hold the trial court did not err \r\n  in failing to dismiss Tyndall's resisting arrest charge. Tyndall's claim that \r\n  the underlying offense of trespass after notice was not present is rejected. \r\n  The trifurcated attack posited by Tyndall on the offense of trespass after notice \r\n  consisting of \r\nTyndall's allegations (1) no judicial \r\n  determination was made as to the probable cause to arrest for trespass after \r\n  notice; (2) he was owner and co-occupant of the house; and (3) he was never \r\n  charged or prosecuted for trespass after notice has been answered and vetoed \r\n  with specificity in this opinion. Additionally, we conclude the judge did not \r\n  err in refusing to charge the law of simple assault and battery since it was \r\n  not warranted by the evidence. Accordingly, Tyndall's convictions are \r\n  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\nCURETON, J., concurs. STILWELL, J., \r\n  concurs in result only. \r\n\r\n1. Because oral \r\n  argument would not aid the Court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide \r\n  this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR. \r\n2.
