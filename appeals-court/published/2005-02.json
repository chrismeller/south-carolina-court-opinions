[1] \r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 1998, Michael McNelis, Kenneth Taylor, \r\n  and Robert Thompson purchased an automotive crankshaft division of a company \r\n  and incorporated as Carolina Crank &amp; Core, Inc.Â  McNelis, Taylor, and Thompson \r\n  obtained a term loan from Branch Banking and Trust Company of South Carolina [2]  (â€œBankâ€), to assist in the purchase.Â  \r\n  The Bank also agreed to extend a line of credit in the amount of $175,000, as \r\n  evidenced by the companyâ€™s promissory note dated February 2, 1999, with a maturity \r\n  date of February 2, 2000.Â  In addition to other security given by the company \r\n  to the Bank, McNelis, Taylor, and Thompson executed and delivered their personal \r\n  guaranty to the bank thereby securing payment of the indebtedness owed to the \r\n  bank.Â  This line of credit is the indebtedness at issue.\r\nIn May 1999, the Bank increased the line of credit to $225,000, \r\n  as evidenced by the Companyâ€™s promissory note dated May 10, 1999, with the original \r\n  maturity date of February 2, 2000.Â  Again the personal guaranties of McNelis, \r\n  Taylor, and Thompson were executed and delivered to the Bank, securing the indebtedness \r\n  owed to the Bank.Â  The Bank subsequently extended a second line of credit, distinct \r\n  from the original line of credit, in the amount of $100,000.Â  The Company executed \r\n  and delivered its promissory note to the Bank on November 24, 1999, also reflecting \r\n  the same February 2, 2000 maturity date as the original line of credit.Â  Again \r\n  the personal guaranties of McNelis, Taylor, and Thompson were executed and delivered \r\n  to the Bank.Â  \r\nBoth lines of credit matured on February 2, 2000, \r\n  and at that time the Bank agreed to renew the lines of credit for an additional \r\n  three months.Â  Moreover, the Bank combined the two lines of credit into a single \r\n  line with a total indebtedness of $325,000.Â  The Company executed and delivered \r\n  its promissory note to the Bank on February 2, 2000, evidencing this consolidation, \r\n  and also reflecting the new May 2, 2000 maturity date.Â  Once again the personal \r\n  guaranties of McNelis, Taylor, and Thompson were executed and delivered to the \r\n  Bank, securing the indebtedness.Â  \r\nAs of the August 2, 2000 maturity date, the Bank had made \r\n  a decision not to renew the outstanding line of credit due to the poor financial \r\n  condition of the Company.Â  J. Timothy Camp, the Bank loan executive responsible \r\n  for the Companyâ€™s line of credit, informed McNelis, in his capacity as company \r\n  president, that the Bank would be unwilling to renew the line of credit without \r\n  the Company obtaining additional Bank-approved security, including a new guarantor.Â  \r\n\r\nMcNelis informed Camp the company was in the process of acquiring \r\n  an additional investor.Â  McNelis identified Bruce Tipi, the appellant, as the \r\n  potential investor.Â  Tipi decided to become an investor, shareholder, and employee \r\n  of the Company in an agreement formalized on September 25, 2000.Â  \r\nCamp testified the Bank required Tipiâ€™s personal guaranty as a condition \r\n  of renewing the line of credit, and no renewal would have been approved absent \r\n  Tipiâ€™s guaranty.Â  The Credit Approval Report narrative prepared by Camp on October \r\n  4, 2000 illustrated the Bankâ€™s position.Â  The CAR report stated: â€œThe [Company] \r\n  has requested that [Bank] renew an existing $325K line of credit . . . [Bank] \r\n  will require the personal guarantee of Mr. Bruce W. Tipi.â€Â  On October 6, 2000, \r\n  Camp prepared the appropriate documentation to renew the line of credit, which \r\n  included a new promissory note, effective date August 2, 2000, and a guaranty, \r\n  also effective date of August 2, 2000.Â  The guaranty had four signature lines, \r\n  under which the names of McNelis, Taylor, Thompson, and Tipi were typed.Â  Upon \r\n  receipt of the signed documents, including the fully executed guaranty complete \r\n  with the signature of Tipi, the Bank renewed the line of credit effective retroactively \r\n  to August 2, 2000 with a maturity date of April 2, 2001.Â  \r\nUltimately, the Company defaulted on its obligation to the Bank.Â  \r\n  The Bank commenced this action seeking to collect on the outstanding indebtedness \r\n  under the promissory note and under the signed guaranty.Â  Tipi denied liability \r\n  under the signed guaranty, asserting a failure of consideration. [3] Â  The circuit court rejected Tipiâ€™s \r\n  argument and granted summary judgment in favor of the Bank, thus rendering Tipi \r\n  liable under the guaranty.Â  Tipi appeals the grant of summary judgment.&nbsp; \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate â€œif the pleadings, depositions, \r\n  answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, \r\n  if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that \r\n  the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must \r\n  view the facts in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.Â  George \r\n  v. Fabri, 345 S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001). \r\nâ€œIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, this \r\n  court applies the same standard which governs the trial court: summary judgment \r\n  is proper when â€˜there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the \r\n  moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€™â€Â  Regions Bank \r\n  v. Schmauch, 354 S.C. 648, 659, 582 S.E.2d 432, 438 (Ct. App. 2003) (citations \r\n  omitted).Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nTipi \r\n  advances two primary arguments in support of his position that the circuit court \r\n  erred in granting the Bankâ€™s motion for summary judgment.Â  First, Tipi alleges \r\n  the circuit court erred in finding the guaranty was supported by sufficient \r\n  legal consideration.Â  Second, Tipi claims the circuit court erred in finding \r\n  mutual assent existed between Tipi and the Bank.Â  We disagree as to both arguments \r\n  and affirm.\r\n\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  The circuit court correctly found the guaranty was supported by sufficient legal \r\n  consideration.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\nTipi \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding the guaranty was supported by sufficient \r\n  legal consideration.Â  He alleges a lack of sufficient legal consideration because \r\n  the Bank did not advance any additional funds after receipt of the guaranty.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œA guaranty is â€˜a promise to answer for the payment of some debt \r\n  or the performance of some duty in case of the failure of another person who \r\n  is himself in the first instance, liable to such payment or performance.â€™â€Â  \r\n  Crafton v. Brown, 346 S.C. 347, 350-51, 550 S.E.2d 904, 905 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001) (citation omitted).Â  A guaranty must be supported by sufficient legal \r\n  consideration, which can consist of either a benefit to the principal obligor \r\n  or guarantor, or some detriment to the obligee.Â  Hope Petty Motors of Columbia, \r\n  Inc. v. Hyatt, 310 S.C. 171, 178, 425 S.E.2d 786, 791 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  \r\n  Consideration that is wholly past is not valuable consideration.Â  Future \r\n  Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, 97, 478 S.E.2d 45, 49 (1996 (citation \r\n  omitted)).Â  If all debt was pre-existing, the guaranty must â€œbe supported by \r\n  some new consideration other than the original debt.â€Â  Id.Â  Moreover, \r\n  the guarantor need not derive any benefit from either the principal contract \r\n  or the guaranty provided there is a benefit to the principle obligor or a detriment \r\n  to the creditor.Â  Crafton, 346 S.C. at 354, 550 S.E.2d at 907.\r\nIn this \r\n  case, in exchange for receiving Tipiâ€™s guaranty, the Bank agreed to extend the \r\n  line of credit for an additional eight months past the original maturity date, \r\n  thus forbearing on its pre-existing right to enforce other remedies, including \r\n  collection under the original note.Â  This agreement to extend the line of credit \r\n  and forebear exercising remedies available to the Bank was a benefit to the \r\n  Company and Tipi as shareholder, guarantor, and employee, as well as a detriment \r\n  to the Bank.Â  \r\nTipi \r\n  further asserts the circuit court erred in finding consideration was legally \r\n  sufficient because the guaranty was not executed simultaneously with the note.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nIf a \r\n  note and guaranty are executed simultaneously, the consideration of the note \r\n  functions as consideration for the guaranty; however, if the documents are not \r\n  executed simultaneously, there is no presumption of consideration, and the consideration \r\n  must be proved.Â  See id. at 351, 550 S.E.2d at 907.\r\nIn this \r\n  situation, the only evidence regarding the execution of the note and the guaranty \r\n  was testimony offered by Camp.Â  Camp testified he prepared the new line of credit \r\n  and guaranty documents together on October 6, 2000 and delivered them to the \r\n  Company for the requisite signatures.Â  Camp testified that the line of credit \r\n  would not have been renewed prior to the Bankâ€™s receipt of the signed guaranties.Â  \r\n  Additionally, the executed loan renewal documents, including Tipiâ€™s signed personal \r\n  guaranty, were returned to the Bank and entered into the Bankâ€™s computer system \r\n  on October 12, 2000.Â  Tipi offered no evidence to the contrary at trial.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find the circuit court correctly held the note was prepared and executed \r\n  simultaneous to the guaranty, that it was forwarded for signatures contemporaneous \r\n  with the guaranty, and that the Bank renewed the line of credit upon receipt \r\n  of all the signed documents.Â  Moreover, even if the note and guaranty were not \r\n  executed simultaneously, we have previously held the guaranty was supported \r\n  by the additional consideration of the Bank foregoing the remedies available \r\n  to it at the time of the guaranty.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the ruling of the \r\n  circuit court.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        II.\r\n         The circuit court did not err in finding mutual assent existed between \r\n  Tipi and the Bank. \r\n   \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nTipi \r\n  claims the circuit court erred in finding mutual assent existed between Tipi \r\n  and the Bank.Â  We disagree and affirm.\r\nâ€œA contract \r\n  of guaranty, like every other contract, can only be made by the mutual assent \r\n  of the parties.â€Â  Crafton, 346 S.C. at 354, 550 S.E.2d at 907.Â  â€œIf the \r\n  guaranty is signed by the guarantor at the request of the other party, or if \r\n  the latterâ€™s agreement is contemporaneous with the guaranty, the mutual assent \r\n  is proved, and the delivery of the guaranty to him or for his use completes \r\n  the contract.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nBecause \r\n  the guaranty and promissory note were executed contemporaneously, further evidence \r\n  of a meeting of the minds is not necessary.Â  Therefore, the circuit court did \r\n  not err in finding that mutual assent existed between Tipi and the Bank, and \r\n  the grant of summary judgment is hereby\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n GOOLSBY and WILLIAMS, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We decide this case without oral argument pursuant \r\n    to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The loan was initially with First Federal Bank, \r\n    which was purchased by Branch Banking and Trust Company of South Carolina \r\n    in 2001. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The parties agree Tipi, along with McNelis, Taylor, \r\n    and Thompson, executed the guaranty document.Â  The parties disagree only as \r\n    to whether this guaranty is enforceable against Tipi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3943","title":"Arnal v.

Clark, all of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J.:Â Â Â Â  \r\n  David Arnal (Husband) appeals from the final order of the family court which \r\n  granted the parties a divorce, divided the marital property, imputed income \r\n  to Husband, established child support and visitation, and required him to pay \r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees and guardian ad litem fees.Â Â  Laura Lawton Arnal (Wife) also \r\n  appeals, contesting the equitable distribution and the determination of marital \r\n  property.Â  We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe parties were married \r\n  in 1995.Â  In 1999, they had a son who was diagnosed with Downâ€™s Syndrome.Â  Both \r\n  prior to and during the partiesâ€™ marriage, Husband was employed by Wifeâ€™s father \r\n  in his development company.Â  Wifeâ€™s father, Charles Fraser, was one of the main \r\n  developers of Hilton Head Island, where the parties resided.Â  The parties separated \r\n  in 1999, shortly after the child was born.Â  \r\nWife and child now reside \r\n  in Brevard, North Carolina in a home purchased by one of two trusts under which \r\n  she is a beneficiary.Â  Â Â Father remained in Hilton Head and started his \r\n  own consulting and land development business.Â  Wifeâ€™s main source of income \r\n  is from the family trusts.Â  She is also employed part time in order to be able \r\n  to devote time to the childâ€™s special needs. \r\nThis case has a very \r\n  litigious history.Â  Wife initiated the action seeking custody of the child, \r\n  child support, division of the property, and ultimately a divorce.Â  Husband \r\n  answered, requesting joint legal custody, equitable division, and rehabilitative \r\n  or lump sum alimony.Â  \r\nA temporary hearing was held in January 2000, in which the parties were granted \r\n  joint legal custody, with Wife having physical custody and decision-making authority \r\n  with regard to the childâ€™s treatment. That temporary order granted Husband visitation \r\n  in Brevard only and required him to pay $621.78 a month in child support.\r\nIn May 2000, Husband \r\n  moved for a change of custody as a result of Wifeâ€™s failure to begin therapies \r\n  for the child.Â  Additionally, Husband contended Wife had failed to complete \r\n  the childâ€™s vaccinations.Â  By the time of the hearing, Wife had commenced therapy \r\n  and completed the vaccinations, so the change in custody was denied. Â \r\nHusband \r\n  then moved to compel discovery and to amend his pleadings to seek custody of \r\n  the child.Â  In return to Husbandâ€™s motion, Wife sought the following relief: \r\n  psychological testing of the parties; sole custody; sanctions for Husbandâ€™s \r\n  failure to comply with Rule 11, SCRCP; and a restraining order against Husband.Â  \r\n  The court compelled Wife to comply with discovery, declined sanctions against \r\n  Husband, dismissed the motion for a restraining order, and continued the issue \r\n  of custody of the child.Â  Wifeâ€™s request for psychological testing was abandoned.\r\nIn October 2000, the family court denied Wifeâ€™s request for sole custody \r\n  and granted Husband overnight visitation in the Brevard area and visitation \r\n  in Hilton Head once a month.Â  A second order required Husband to answer interrogatories \r\n  and produce requested documents.Â  \r\nThereafter, Wife filed a rule to show cause against Husband seeking \r\n  to compel him to pay his portion of the medical expenses for the child.Â  The \r\n  court found Husband in contempt and ordered him to pay the expenses and $1,000 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Wife filed a subsequent rule to show cause in December \r\n  2000, after Husband failed to pay medical expenses and failed to respond to \r\n  discovery requests.Â  Husband had complied by the date of the hearing, so the \r\n  court did not hold him in contempt, though it reserved the issue of legal fees, \r\n  required Husband to pay the medical expenses, and ordered him to produce documents. \r\n\r\nIn February 2001, upon Wifeâ€™s motion, the family court reviewed Husbandâ€™s \r\n  visitation. The court concluded that because the child â€œha[d] been suffering \r\n  illnesses since December and the final hearing in this matter [was] scheduled \r\n  shortly, and since it [was] the cold and flu seasonâ€ it would be in the childâ€™s \r\n  best interest for all visitation to occur in Brevard rather than having the \r\n  child travel to Hilton Head pending the final hearing.Â Â  Â Â \r\nWife subsequently filed a motion to hold Husband in contempt for his \r\n  failure to respond to discovery and produce documents that he claimed contained \r\n  a confidentiality agreement involving investment property he owned with others.Â Â  \r\n  The family court held Husband in contempt and ordered him to pay $10,000 in \r\n  legal fees to Wife.Â  The same order relieved Husbandâ€™s counsel and appointed \r\n  a new guardian ad litem for the child.Â  Husband did not appeal the contempt \r\n  order until the filing of the current appeal. Â \r\nThis action was tried \r\n  in April 2001.Â Â Â  In its final order, the family court granted Wife sole custody \r\n  of the child and gave her the right to control all medical and educational decisions \r\n  for the child.Â  Â Â Husband received visitation on alternating weekends, \r\n  but the first and third visitation of the month were required to be in Brevard \r\n  rather than at Husbandâ€™s home in Hilton Head.Â Â  Additionally, the visitation \r\n  in Brevard was limited to no more than one hour travel, and Husband was required \r\n  to provide documentation to that effect.Â  The visitation restrictions were to \r\n  end when the minor reached forty-three months of age. \r\n  [1] Â  \r\nThe final order also \r\n  divided the marital property.Â  The court granted Husband the properties he acquired \r\n  through his partnership and split the personal possessions.Â  Additionally, in \r\n  calculating child support, the court imputed income to Husband in the amount \r\n  of $9,060.62 per month and imputed income to Wife in the amount of $5,012.40 \r\n  per month.Â  According to their sworn financial declarations filed pursuant to \r\n  Rule 20, SCRFC, Husband earned $3,656 per month and Wife earned $4,750 per month. \r\n  Husband was required to pay $1,564 in child support and to pay his pro-rata \r\n  share (64%) of uncovered medical expenses.Â  The court required Wife to apply \r\n  for Medicaid and to research and apply for any other financial assistance available \r\n  in order to pay the costs of caring for the child.Â  \r\nThe family court ordered \r\n  the guardianâ€™s fee to be paid equally by the parties up to the date of trial \r\n  and required Husband to bear the full cost of the guardianâ€™s fee at trial.Â  \r\n  The court found Husband should be responsible for the full fee at trial because \r\n  â€œthe issue of visitation was tried primarily because [Husband] would not accept \r\n  the Guardian ad Litemâ€™s recommendations.â€Â  Finally, after analyzing the appropriate \r\n  factors, the court ordered Husband to pay $65,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees in addition \r\n  to the $10,000 and $1,000 awards previously ordered.Â  \r\nHusband filed a motion \r\n  for reconsideration, challenging many aspects of the family courtâ€™s order.Â  \r\n  The motion was denied in October 2001.Â  \r\nSubsequent to the final \r\n  order, Wife filed a rule to show cause seeking to hold Husband in contempt on \r\n  the grounds that: Husband failed to pay uncovered medical expenses, Husband \r\n  failed to pay his August child support in full, Husband failed to provide documentation \r\n  he was not traveling more than one hour from Brevard, and Husband failed to \r\n  pay the remaining balance of $500 on the previous attorneysâ€™ fees award of $1,000. \r\n\r\nThe hearing was held \r\n  on November 6, 2001.Â  During the hearing, Wife presented the fee affidavit of \r\n  one of her two attorneys.Â  The attorney was not present, and Husband requested \r\n  the hearing be continued so that he could cross-examine the attorney on her \r\n  fee.Â  The subsequent hearing was held two days later.Â  \r\nFollowing the second hearing, the family court issued two orders in \r\n  February 2002.Â  One found Husband should pay the increased child support as \r\n  of August 1, but did not find him in willful contempt for failing to do so.Â  \r\n  Additionally, he was found in contempt for failing to make timely payments on \r\n  medical bills and thereafter required to pay uncovered medicals within fourteen \r\n  days from the date Wife mailed him notice.Â  Husband was found in contempt for \r\n  failing to pay the remaining balance on the $1,000 attorneysâ€™ fees and was ordered \r\n  jailed for ten days with the ability to purge the contempt by paying the $500 \r\n  remaining.Â  \r\nThe second order required Husband to pay $4,727.25 in attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  as a result of Wifeâ€™s institution of the rule to show cause.Â  This amount was \r\n  over $2,000 more than the amount submitted at the initial hearing on the rule \r\n  to show cause. \r\nHusband \r\n  has appealed the Amended Final Order, the order denying his motion for reconsideration, \r\n  and the orders resulting from the rule to show cause. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals \r\n  from the family court, this court may find facts in accordance with its own \r\n  view of the preponderance of the evidence.

Regs. 114-4720(A) (Supp. 2003).Â  The guidelines further provide:\r\n\r\nPotential Income.Â  If the court finds that a parent is voluntarily \r\n  unemployed or underemployed, it should calculate child support based on a determination \r\n  of potential income which would otherwise ordinarily be available to the parent.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5) (Supp. \r\n  2003).\r\nDuring the marriage, \r\n  Husband was employed by Wifeâ€™s father.Â  Husbandâ€™s expert testified that his \r\n  annual income during this time was between $35,000 and $40,000, and Wife did \r\n  not contradict this testimony.Â  Following the separation, Husbandâ€™s employment \r\n  with Wifeâ€™s father was terminated, and he started his own consulting and land \r\n  development business.Â  Since beginning his own business, Husband made more money \r\n  than when working for his father-in-law.Â  According to his financial declaration, \r\n  Husband was earning nearly $44,000 at the time of trial.Â  Nevertheless, at Wifeâ€™s \r\n  urging, the family court imputed more income to Husband than he earned at any \r\n  time during the marriage.Â  \r\nWife argues that although \r\n  Husband has increased his income following the separation, he is not earning \r\n  income commensurate with his earning capacity, and that Husband is capable of \r\n  earning substantially more than his current income.Â  Wife points out that Husband \r\n  has an undergraduate degree from Clemson University and a masterâ€™s degree in \r\n  landscape architecture from Harvard University.Â  Wifeâ€™s position is that because \r\n  Husband is so well educated, he could earn more money than he is currently earning. \r\n  Wife essentially argues Husband is not billing his clients a high enough hourly \r\n  rate or billing the maximum number of hours.Â  \r\nEven accepting Wifeâ€™s \r\n  assertions as true, we do not find this to be a case for imputation of income \r\n  because there is no indication that Husband has voluntarily lessened his earning \r\n  capacity.Â  â€œ[T]he failure to reach earning capacity, by itself, does not automatically \r\n  equate to voluntary underemployment such that income must be imputed.â€Â  Kelley \r\n  v. Kelley, 324 S.C. 481, 488-89, 477 S.E.2d 727, 731 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  â€œ[C]ourts \r\n  are to closely examine the payorâ€™s good-faith and reasonable explanation for \r\n  the decreased income.â€Â  Id. at 489, 477 S.E.2d at 731.Â  \r\nIn this case, there \r\n  is no evidence Husband has decreased his income at all.Â  In fact, his income \r\n  has increased since the time of the partiesâ€™ separation.Â  Moreover, the mere \r\n  fact that Husband could make additional income does not warrant the imputation \r\n  of income.Â  There is no evidence that Husbandâ€™s failure to make additional income \r\n  was due to any wrongdoing on his part or motivated by a desire to decrease his \r\n  support obligation.Â  See Mazzone v. Miles, 341 S.C. 203, 209, \r\n  532 S.E.2d 890, 893 (Ct. App. 2000) (declining to impute more than minimum wage \r\n  to husband when there was no evidence that the loss of his job was due to any \r\n  wrongdoing, or that his decision to start his own business was motivated by \r\n  a desire to avoid his child support obligations).Â  â€œ[C]ourts are reluctant to \r\n  invade a partyâ€™s freedom to pursue the employment path of their [sic] own choosing \r\n  or impose unreasonable demands on parties.â€Â  Kelley, 324 S.C. at 489, \r\n  477 S.E.2d at 731.Â  \r\nThe family court erred \r\n  in imputing income to Husband of over $9,000 per month because there is no evidence \r\n  in this record that Husband voluntarily depressed his income.Â  In fact, at the \r\n  time of the hearing, Husband was making more income in his new business \r\n  than he had ever earned during the partiesâ€™ marriage.Â  Following Wifeâ€™s argument \r\n  to its logical conclusion, a family court could impute income to a spouse if \r\n  it merely found that he or she was capable of earning more income.Â  This is \r\n  simply not the test for imputation of income in this state.Â  Therefore, because \r\n  we do not find Husband has voluntarily lessened his earning capacity, we reverse \r\n  the family courtâ€™s decision to impute income to him.Â  \r\nHowever, for purposes \r\n  of setting child support we do not accept Husbandâ€™s income as stated on his \r\n  financial declaration.Â  Accordingly, we now undertake to establish Husbandâ€™s \r\n  income for purposes of determining child support.Â  The guidelines define gross \r\n  income for self-employed persons as:\r\n\r\ngross receipts minus \r\n  ordinary and necessary expenses required for self-employment or business operation \r\n  . . . .Â  However, the court should exclude from those expenses amounts allowed \r\n  by the Internal Revenue Service for accelerated depreciation or investment tax \r\n  credits for purposes of the guidelines and add those amounts back in to determine \r\n  gross income.Â  In general, the court should carefully review income and expenses \r\n  from self-employment or operation of a business to determine actual levels of \r\n  gross income available to the parent to satisfy a child support obligation.Â  \r\n  As may be apparent, this amount may differ from a determination of business \r\n  income for tax purposes.\r\n\r\n27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(5) (Supp. 2003).\r\nHusbandâ€™s financial \r\n  declaration lists his gross monthly income as $3,656.56 per month, or $43,878.72 \r\n  per year.Â  Husbandâ€™s financial expert explained roughly how this number was \r\n  calculated.Â Â Â  The expert testified that Husbandâ€™s consulting and land development \r\n  business generated gross revenues of $91,000 in 2000.Â  He deducted business \r\n  expenses of $37,000 to arrive at a net income of approximately $54,000.Â  The \r\n  expert added back into the net income a $5,010 charitable contribution that \r\n  was incorrectly deducted from the gross revenues as a business expense on Husbandâ€™s \r\n  financial declaration.Â  The expert reduced Husbandâ€™s net income by the losses \r\n  incurred by Husbandâ€™s Bee Blessed Honey Business of approximately $14,800 and \r\n  his Heritage Tent Company of approximately $2,000.Â Â  The expert testified that, \r\n  as a result, Husbandâ€™s net income was in the range of $4,056 per month or $48,672 \r\n  annually. \r\nWe accept the testimony \r\n  of Husbandâ€™s expert that Husband generated gross revenues of $91,000 and business \r\n  expenses of $37,000 in the year 2000.Â  We also agree that the $5,010 charitable \r\n  contribution was incorrectly deducted from Husbandâ€™s gross revenues.Â  However, \r\n  we do not believe Husbandâ€™s monthly income should be reduced by the losses from \r\n  his honey and tent businesses.Â  From our view of the evidence, we agree with \r\n  Wifeâ€™s argument that Husband is operating those businesses as a hobby and therefore \r\n  cannot use them to reduce his monthly income. Â In sum, we find Husbandâ€™s \r\n  income to be the $91,000 in gross revenues, less $37,000 in business expenses, \r\n  plus the $5,010 charitable contribution, equaling $4,917.50 per month or $59,010 \r\n  annually.Â  Thus, we remand [3]  the issue of child support for recalculation \r\n  based on this income.Â  This recalculation should be retroactive to the date \r\n  of the final order.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        2.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the family court erred in failing to impute income to Wife \r\n   \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues that \r\n  the family court erred in failing to impute more income to Wife based on her \r\n  ability to rent a home for less than market value because the home is owned \r\n  by the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust.Â  We disagree.\r\nFollowing the partiesâ€™ \r\n  separation, Wife moved to a home in Brevard, North Carolina which had been recently \r\n  purchased by the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust, a trust in which she may be one of two \r\n  trustees [4]  and is the sole beneficiary.Â Â Â  According to Wifeâ€™s financial \r\n  declaration, she paid $1,000 each month to the Grandchildrenâ€™s trust to rent \r\n  the home.Â  Husband argues that this rental rate is below fair market value, \r\n  and based on his own real estate experience, alleges that the fair market rental \r\n  value of Wifeâ€™s home is $2,760 a month, or one percent of the sales price.Â  \r\n  Husband asks that the difference between the fair market rental value and the \r\n  rent actually paid be considered income as an in-kind subsidization of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  housing by the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust, analogous to income in the form of in-kind \r\n  payments received by a self-employed parent provided for in the child support \r\n  guidelines.Â  \r\nFirst, it is questionable \r\n  whether Husbandâ€™s testimony as to the fair market rental value of Wifeâ€™s home \r\n  provided a sufficient basis on which the family court judge could have imputed \r\n  income to Wife.Â Â  However, even assuming without deciding that Husbandâ€™s assertion \r\n  regarding fair market value is correct, the guidelines provide that â€œgross incomeâ€ \r\n  does not include â€œin-kind income.â€Â  Rather, the guidelines provide that \r\n  â€œthe court should count as income expense reimbursements or in-kind payments \r\n  received by a parent from self-employment or operation of a business if they \r\n  are significant and reduce personal living expenses, such as a company car, \r\n  free housing, or reimbursed meals.â€Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(A)(3)(c) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  Husband makes no argument that Wife receives a reduced rental \r\n  rate in exchange for operating a business or through self-employment.Â  Thus, \r\n  even if Wife is renting her home below fair market value, such a benefit would \r\n  be in-kind income specifically excluded from gross income under the guidelines.Â  \r\n  We therefore find the family court did not err in excluding any difference between \r\n  the fair market value and the actual rent paid from Wifeâ€™s income.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        3.\r\n         Whether \r\n  the family court erred in (a) excluding testimony of W.C. Hoecke regarding Medicaid, \r\n  and (b) failing to assign all uncovered medical expenses to Wife\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family \r\n  court erred in requiring him to pay his pro rata share of the \r\n  childâ€™s medical expenses not covered by health insurance.Â  Husband alleges that \r\n  Medicaid would cover all of the childâ€™s medical costs if the child lived in \r\n  South Carolina, rather than North Carolina.Â  Because Wife voluntarily moved \r\n  to North Carolina, Husband argues that he should not bear the burden of the \r\n  uncovered medical expenses.Â  \r\nThe guidelines state \r\n  that â€œ[e]xtraordinary unreimbursed medical expenses addressed by the court shall \r\n  be divided in pro rata percentages based on the proportional share of combined \r\n  monthly adjusted gross income.â€Â Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720(G) (Supp. \r\n  2003) (emphasis added).Â  The use of the word â€œshallâ€ in the guidelines indicates \r\n  the provision is mandatory.Â  See Charleston County Parents for Public \r\n  Schools, Inc. v. Moseley, 343 S.C. 509, 519, 541 S.E.2d 533, 538 (2001).Â  \r\n  A court may deviate from the guidelines upon considering, among other factors, \r\n  â€œchild-related unreimbursed extraordinary medical expenses.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-852 (C)(8) (Supp. 2003).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAt trial, Husband sought \r\n  testimony from W.C. Hoecke, a pastor and employee of Family Connection of South \r\n  Carolina, Inc., an organization that connects families of children with special \r\n  needs.Â  Â Â The family court excluded the testimony as irrelevant, but \r\n  permitted Husband to make a proffer.Â  During the proffer of Hoeckeâ€™s testimony, \r\n  Hoecke was asked if the child was eligible for Medicaid in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  He testified: â€œI have never come across a child yet with Downâ€™s Syndrome that \r\n  isnâ€™t eligible.â€Â  When questioned again if the partiesâ€™ child specifically would \r\n  qualify, Hoecke testified that â€œ[a]gain, youâ€™re going to have to go to the State \r\n  of South Carolina to get that, but I have never yet found a child with Downâ€™s \r\n  Syndrome that hasnâ€™t qualified . . . .â€Â  \r\nOn appeal, Husband argues \r\n  that this testimony was relevant to Wifeâ€™s claim for contribution from him for \r\n  the childâ€™s uncovered medical expenses and alleges it was error not to assign \r\n  all uncovered medical expenses to Wife.Â  We believe the family court erred in \r\n  not ascertaining whether the childâ€™s uncovered medical expenditures, which are \r\n  substantial, would have been covered by Medicaid if Wife had continued to live \r\n  in South Carolina. [5] Â  We agree \r\n  with Husband that this evidence was certainly relevant to the determination \r\n  of payment of uncovered medical expenses.Â  However, the court also ordered Wife \r\n  to apply for Medicaid on the childâ€™s behalf in North Carolina.Â  Because we are \r\n  remanding the issue of child support to the family court for re-determination, \r\n  the family court is directed to address the issue of the childâ€™s eligibility \r\n  for Medicaid in apportioning the uncovered medicals between the parties.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        4.&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the family court erred in failing to admit evidence of the corpus \r\n  of (a) the Fraser Family Trust, and (b) the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;At trial, Husband sought \r\n  to introduce evidence regarding the corpuses of two trusts of which Wife was \r\n  a beneficiary, the Fraser Family Trust and the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust.Â  The family \r\n  court excluded this evidence as irrelevant, but allowed Husband to proffer the \r\n  amount by providing the court with a sealed envelope stating the corpus amounts.Â  \r\n  Husband contends this was error because the corpuses are relevant to setting \r\n  child support, awarding attorneysâ€™ fees, divvying up uncovered medical bills, \r\n  and his request that Wife reimburse him for a portion of the costs he incurred \r\n  while visiting the child in Brevard. Husband maintains Wife has access to the \r\n  trust property in addition to the income to benefit her and to maintain her \r\n  lifestyle.Â  We agree that the court erred in excluding the evidence as irrelevant.\r\nWife is one of three \r\n  beneficiaries of the Fraser Family Trust and receives income of approximately \r\n  $12,000 per year in distributions from this trust. \r\n  [6] Â  The trustees are Wife, her sister, and her mother.Â  Both Husbandâ€™s \r\n  expert and the trust document indicate the trustees can invade the corpus of \r\n  the trust in order to maintain Wifeâ€™s standard of living.Â  Â Â The trust \r\n  document provides:Â  â€œThe Trustee may at any time and from time to time encroach \r\n  on the principal of this trust in such amounts as the Trustee may deem necessary \r\n  in its judgment to provide for the support of . . . LAURA LAWTON STONE FRASER \r\n  . . . in [her] accustomed manner of living and for [her] education . . . .â€Â Â Â  \r\n  While this invasion of the corpus to maintain Wifeâ€™s standard of living is neither \r\n  mandatory nor within the sole power of Wife, as beneficiary Wife may seek payment \r\n  of the corpus to maintain her standard of living, and as co-trustee Wife has \r\n  the power to influence any distribution.Â  \r\nWhile the documents \r\n  creating the Grandchildrenâ€™s trust are not in evidence, there is some testimony \r\n  regarding this trust.Â  Wifeâ€™s expert testified that Henry Bernheim is the trustee; \r\n  however, Husbandâ€™s expert testified that the trust documents suggest Wife is \r\n  a co-trustee.Â Â Â Â  Wife is the sole income beneficiary and receives approximately \r\n  $25,000 per year in distributions. \r\n  [7]  Â Both Wifeâ€™s and Husbandâ€™s experts testified that Wife could \r\n  not receive any corpus distributions from the Grandchildrenâ€™s Trust.Â  While \r\n  she may not be able to invade the corpus of this trust as she can the Fraser \r\n  Family Trust, this trust purchased the home in which she and her child reside \r\n  in Brevard.Â  Thus, it appears that Wife has the power to influence the investment \r\n  of the trust corpus for her benefit.Â  \r\nIn awarding attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, the family court should consider, among other things, the respective financial \r\n  conditions of the parties and the effect the fee would have on each partyâ€™s \r\n  standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., 307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  812, 816 (1992).Â  Because Wife could invade the corpus of one trust to maintain \r\n  her standard of living and could influence the investment of the other trust \r\n  for her financial benefit, the family court should have considered the trust \r\n  corpuses when deciding whether to award attorneysâ€™ fees. Furthermore, because \r\n  these trusts affected Wifeâ€™s financial condition, the family court should have \r\n  taken them into consideration when determining whether Wife ought to reimburse \r\n  Husband for a portion of the costs he incurred while visiting the child in Brevard. \r\n  [8] Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nAs to the issues of \r\n  child support and uncovered medical bills, we do not believe the amounts of \r\n  the trust corpuses are relevant because the child support guidelines do not \r\n  provide for consideration of nonmarital property.Â  See 27 S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Regs. 114-4720 (Supp. 2003).Â  We therefore find the trust corpuses relevant \r\n  only to the issues of attorneysâ€™ fees and travel costs.Â  However, because of \r\n  our decision infra to reverse the award of attorneysâ€™ fees, we reverse \r\n  and remand only to the extent the trust corpuses affect the issue of travel \r\n  reimbursement.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         5.&nbsp;  \r\n        Whether the family court erred in dividing \r\n  the pre-trial GAL fees equally between the parties when sixty percent of the \r\n  GAL fees were incurred traveling from Hilton Head to Brevard  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family \r\n  court erred in dividing the pre-trial guardian ad litem fees equally between \r\n  the parties when sixty percent of the hours charged were with respect to the \r\n  Wife, and specifically when ten of the 88.45 hours charged were spent traveling \r\n  to the Wifeâ€™s home in Brevard.Â  We disagree.\r\nâ€œAn award of guardian \r\n  ad litem fees lies within the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not \r\n  be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Shirley v. Shirley, \r\n  342 S.C. 324, 341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000) (citation omitted).Â  \r\n  Husband complains that Wifeâ€™s move to Brevard, North Carolina caused the guardian \r\n  to incur additional fees in the form of travel.Â  However, the parties agreed \r\n  to the appointment of the guardian, Ralph Tupper, an attorney who practices \r\n  in Beaufort, South Carolina.Â  Had a guardian been appointed who was nearer to \r\n  Brevard, additional expense would have been incurred when he or she visited \r\n  with Husband in Hilton Head.Â  Thus, we decline to find that the family court \r\n  abused its discretion in splitting the pre-trial guardian fees equally between \r\n  the parties.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        6.  \r\n        &nbsp;Whether the family court erred in assigning \r\n  Husband all of the trial GAL fees\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family \r\n  court erred in imposing upon him the entire cost of the guardianâ€™s fees incurred \r\n  during trial.Â  We agree. \r\nIn apportioning guardian \r\n  fees, the final order stated: â€œI believe the issue of visitation was tried primarily \r\n  because [Husband] would not accept the Guardian ad Litemâ€™s recommendations.Â  \r\n  Thus, I believe that it is fair to require him to be responsible for the Guardian \r\n  ad Litemâ€™s fees at trial.â€Â  Â Â In private actions, a guardian â€œfunctions \r\n  as a representative of the court, appointed to assist the court in making its \r\n  determination of custody by advocating for the best interest of the children \r\n  and providing the court with an objective view.â€Â  Patel v. Patel, 347 \r\n  S.C. 281, 287, 555 S.E.2d 386, 389 (2001).Â  The family court judge, not the \r\n  guardian, is the ultimate decision-maker with respect to visitation and the \r\n  best interest of the child.Â  Therefore, Husband had no obligation to accept \r\n  the recommendation of the guardian regarding visitation.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIn this case, Husband \r\n  had a legitimate interest in seeking overnight visitation in his own home.Â  \r\n  We do not feel Husband should be penalized for litigating a meritorious issue.Â  \r\n  See Green v. Durham Life Ins. Co., 287 S.C. 197, 199, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  478, 480 (1985) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision not to award attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, finding respondent should not be penalized for its decision to litigate \r\n  a meritorious issue).Â  We find the family court abused its discretion in imposing \r\n  on Husband the entire cost of the guardian fees incurred during trial.Â  We find \r\n  it equitable to equally apportion the cost of the guardianâ€™s trial fees between \r\n  the parties.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        7.&nbsp;  \r\n        Whether the family court erred in awarding \r\n  Wife $65,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe family courtâ€™s final \r\n  order required Husband to pay Wife $65,000 for attorneysâ€™ fees, in addition \r\n  to the $10,000 and $1,000 awards previously ordered on the rules to show cause.Â  \r\n  Husband contends the family court erred in awarding the $65,000 in attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees to Wife.Â  We agree.\r\nAn award of attorneyâ€™s fees will not be overturned absent an abuse \r\n  of discretion.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 295 S.C. 412, 415, 368 S.E.2d \r\n  901, 903 (1988).Â  In deciding whether to award attorneyâ€™s fees, the family court \r\n  should consider the partiesâ€™ ability to pay their own fee, the beneficial results \r\n  obtained by counsel, the respective financial conditions of the parties, and \r\n  the effect of the fee on each partyâ€™s standard of living.Â  E.D.M. v. T.A.M., \r\n  307 S.C. 471, 476-77, 415 S.E.2d 812, 816 (1992).Â  \r\nIn awarding attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees to Wife, the family court concluded:Â  \r\n\r\nBoth parties have the \r\n  ability to pay their own fees. . . . [Wife] prevailed on the major issues. . \r\n  . . In light of the equitable division, [Husband] is in a superior financial \r\n  condition. . . . Each partyâ€™s standard of living would be affected, but I believe \r\n  that it would be unfair for [Wife] to have to pay the majority of her attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees since most of the protracted nature of this litigation was precipitated \r\n  by [Husband].Â  \r\n\r\nWe agree with the family \r\n  courtâ€™s initial observation that both parties have the ability to pay their \r\n  own fees.Â  However, we strongly disagree that Husband is to blame for the â€œprotracted \r\n  nature of this litigation.â€Â  While Husband is guilty of prolonging the discovery \r\n  process by claiming a confidentiality privilege that he did not have, Husband \r\n  has already been held in contempt and ordered to pay $10,000 for doing so.Â  \r\n  It is unfair for the family court to continue to punish Husband for that isolated \r\n  incident of misbehavior, and frankly, nothing in the record indicates that Husband \r\n  was more to blame than Wife for this caseâ€™s litigious history.Â  \r\nBecause our opinion \r\n  has afforded the parties a substantially equivalent result and because each \r\n  party has the ability to pay his or her own fees, we reverse the award of attorneysâ€™ \r\n  fees.Â  The parties will bear the cost of their own attorneys.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        8.  \r\n        Whether the family court erred in denying \r\n  Husband Easter and summer visitation.  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues the family court erred in denying him Easter and summer visitation.Â  \r\n  We agree.Â  \r\nâ€œWhen awarding visitation, the controlling consideration is the welfare \r\n  and best interest of the child.Â  As with child custody, the issue of child visitation \r\n  falls within the discretion of the trial judge, and his findings will not be \r\n  disturbed absent an abuse of discretion.â€Â  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. \r\n  7, 12, 471 S.E.2d 154, 158 (1996) (citations omitted).\r\nIn \r\n  its final order, the family court established specific guidelines for holiday \r\n  visitation, but failed to address Easter weekend.Â Â Â  Â The family court \r\n  also declined to award extended summer visitation to Husband.Â  In his motion \r\n  for reconsideration, Husband specifically asked for Easter visitation and extended \r\n  summer visitation, but without explanation, the family court denied his request.\r\nIn \r\n  cases of child custody, our court usually affords great deference to the visitation \r\n  schedule established by the family court; however, we do have the ability, when \r\n  necessary, to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.

Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157, 160 (1992).Â  Where, as here, the best interest of the child is compromised \r\n  by the family courtâ€™s visitation schedule, we are compelled to exercise our \r\n  de novo review. \r\nAs to Easter visitation, \r\n  both parties testified that they are Christians and are involved with church \r\n  and religious activities. Considering the significance of Easter weekend to \r\n  the partiesâ€™ religious faith, we find it to be in the childâ€™s best interest \r\n  to share the holiday in a manner similar to the schedule provided for during \r\n  the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays.Â &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nAdditionally, \r\n  we find it in the childâ€™s best interest to have extended summer visitation with \r\n  Husband.Â  During the trial, Wife argued that frequent travel caused the child \r\n  to regress in therapy and to become sick more often.Â  Addressing this issue \r\n  in its final order, the family court stated:\r\n\r\nI do not believe there \r\n  is a threat to [the childâ€™s] health because of travel in and of itself[.]Â  Because \r\n  of his condition, I believe that at his age, he is more easily susceptible to \r\n  infection, stress and tiring.Â  This concern must be balanced against the need \r\n  to bond with his father.Â Â  Both parents are needed in [the childâ€™s] life. \r\n\r\nWe agree with \r\n  this premise and find an award of summer visitation would have furthered these \r\n  goals.Â  Summer visitation would have reduced any stress associated with frequent \r\n  travel.Â  Furthermore, now that the child is over forty-three months old, all \r\n  experts agree that allowing the child to visit Husband in Hilton Head would \r\n  not adversely affect the childâ€™s development.Â  Moreover, because the child is \r\n  of school age, it is likely impossible for Husband to exercise his weeklong \r\n  visitation during the months of February, June, and October, as originally provided \r\n  for in the final order.Â Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find \r\n  summer visitation, as well as Easter visitation, to be in the best interest \r\n  of the child.Â  We therefore remand this issue to the family court to establish \r\n  a schedule.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        9.  \r\n        Whether the family court erred in valuing \r\n  the Boozer-  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nArnal lots\r\nHusband argues the family court \r\n  erred in valuing certain marital property known as the â€œBoozer-Arnal lotsâ€ based \r\n  on Wifeâ€™s appraiserâ€™s values.Â  Specifically, Husband contends this value should \r\n  not have been accepted by the family court because Wifeâ€™s appraiser valued the \r\n  lots a year after the date of filing and did not adjust for a sales commission.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nMarital property includes â€œall \r\n  real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the \r\n  marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital \r\n  litigation.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2003).Â  Thus, for purposes of \r\n  equitable distribution, the value of marital property is the value of the property \r\n  at the time of the commencement of the marital litigation.Â  See Mallett \r\n  v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 151, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  Importantly, \r\n  however, both parties are entitled to share in any appreciation or depreciation \r\n  that occurs to marital property after separation but before divorce.Â  Hatfield \r\n  v. VanEpps, 358 S.C. 185, 194, 594 S.E.2d 526, 531 (Ct. App. 2004); see \r\n  also Smith v. Smith, 294 S.C. 194, 203, 363 S.E.2d 404, 409 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1987) (â€œWe know of no authority, and the husband does not cite any, that \r\n  holds that only one spouse is entitled to any appreciation in marital assets \r\n  that occurs after the parties separate and before the parties are divorced. \r\n  We would think both parties would be entitled to any such appreciation.â€); Dixon \r\n  v. Dixon, 334 S.C. 222, 228, 512 S.E.2d 539, 542 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œ[I]t \r\n  is not unusual for the value of marital assets to change, sometimes substantially, \r\n  between the time the action was commenced and its final resolution. In such \r\n  a case, the family court has the ability to consider the post-filing appreciation \r\n  or depreciation when valuing and apportioning the marital estate.â€).\r\nIn this case, Wife filed \r\n  for divorce on December 6, 1999.Â  The case came to trial in late April 2001.Â  \r\n  Wifeâ€™s appraiser valued the lots four months prior to trial whereas Husband \r\n  based his valuation on county tax appraisals that were conducted prior to Wife \r\n  filing her complaint.Â  Notably, Husband did not present any evidence that the \r\n  value of the lots stayed the same from the time of filing to the time of the \r\n  final hearing. Furthermore, Husbandâ€™s argument concerning the adjustment for \r\n  commission is speculative and irrelevant to the valuation of the lots.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we find no error in the trial court accepting the valuation provided by Wife.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        10.  \r\n          \r\n        Whether the family court erred in excluding testimony of John L. Hunter, \r\n  when his testimony set the basis for the appreciation of the Six Oaks Cemetery \r\n  due to Husbandâ€™s efforts  \r\n          \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAt trial, Husband sought \r\n  to introduce testimony from John L. Hunter, the administrator of Six Oaks Cemetery.Â  \r\n  Six Oaks Cemetery was owned by the Fraser Family Trust, and Wife managed the \r\n  property during the marriage.Â  Prior to the final hearing, the cemetery was \r\n  sold, and Wife received a portion of the proceeds.Â  At trial, Husband attempted \r\n  to call Hunter to the stand in order to show that the money Wife made from the \r\n  sale was either (a) non-marital property in which Husband had a special equity \r\n  interest because of the contributions he made to the cemetery, or (b) marital \r\n  property because it stemmed from the work Wife performed during the marriage.Â  \r\n  Wife objected to Hunter testifying about the cemetery because Hunter was listed \r\n  as a witness who would testify about â€œa church he was involved with with Mary \r\n  Fraser, . . . intra-family relationships, [and] inquisition of his wife on [an] \r\n  EMS call.â€Â  Husband argued Hunterâ€™s testimony would fall within the scope of \r\n  describing intra-family relationships. The family court sustained Wifeâ€™s objection, \r\n  but allowed Husband to proffer the testimony.Â Â  On appeal, Husband argues the \r\n  family court erred in excluding Hunterâ€™s testimony.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe proffered testimony \r\n  by Hunter concerned the gross receipts of the cemetery and Husbandâ€™s efforts \r\n  in improving the cemetery.Â  Hunterâ€™s testimony did not describe any interaction \r\n  between Husband and Wife or between any other family members.Â  We do not see \r\n  how this testimony comes within the purview of intra-family relationships.Â  \r\n\r\nIntertwined with his \r\n  argument that the proffered testimony should have been considered, Husband also \r\n  asserts that the family court erred in failing to assign to him a special equity \r\n  in the cemetery.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nGenerally, any increase in value \r\n  of nonmarital property is also nonmarital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473(5) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  However, a non-owner spouse has a special equity interest in \r\n  any increase in value of non-marital property resulting from that spouseâ€™s material \r\n  contribution.Â  See Murray v. Murray, 312 S.C. 154, 159, 439 S.E.2d \r\n  312, 316 (Ct. App. 1993).Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-471 (Supp. \r\n  2003).\r\nWe find Husband failed \r\n  to prove he made material contributions to the appreciation of the Six Oaks \r\n  Cemetery.Â  While he testified regarding the use of his landscaping designs and \r\n  his physical labor at the cemetery, there is no testimony concerning any actual \r\n  appreciation in value.Â  Additionally, Wife testified Husband was paid for work \r\n  at the cemetery and that his work amounted to very little time actually spent.Â  \r\n  See Webber v. Webber, 285 S.C. 425, 427-28, 330 S.E.2d 79, 81 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1985) (stating that contributions must be material before court will \r\n  award special equity and review of decision is for abuse of discretion).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we cannot say the family court abused its discretion by refusing to grant Husband \r\n  a special equity interest in the proceeds from the sale of the cemetery.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        11.&nbsp;  \r\n          \r\n        Whether the family court erred in awarding Wife $4,725.25 in attorneysâ€™ fees \r\n  for the contempt action  \r\n          \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion \r\n  of the trial, Wife brought a contempt action against Husband for failing to \r\n  pay child support and medical expenses in a timely manner.Â  During the hearing, \r\n  Wifeâ€™s attorneys submitted an affidavit of attorneysâ€™ fees for $2,635.35 that \r\n  had accrued in connection with the contempt action.Â  This amount included estimated \r\n  fees of $875 for the appearance of Mrs. Rosen, one of Wifeâ€™s attorneys.Â  However, \r\n  due to an illness, Mrs. Rosen did not actually attend the hearing.Â  Instead, \r\n  Wifeâ€™s other attorney, Mr. Rosen, covered the hearing.Â  Mr. Rosen charged $1,125 \r\n  for his appearance at the hearing.Â Â  \r\nHusband requested a \r\n  continuation of the hearing in order to examine Mrs. Rosen regarding the reasonableness \r\n  of her fees.Â  The family court permitted the continuance and allowed Wifeâ€™s \r\n  attorneys to submit supplemental affidavits of attorneysâ€™ fees, which included \r\n  fees incurred by Mr. Rosen, Mrs. Rosen, and a paralegal for their appearance \r\n  at the second hearing, totaling $8,019.Â  After the second hearing, the family \r\n  court awarded Wife $4,725.25 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  This amount included the fees \r\n  incurred by Mr. Rosen for his appearance at the first hearing ($2,885.25 \r\n  [9] ) and four hours of fees for Mr. Rosen, Mrs. Rosen, and the paralegal \r\n  ($1,860) for their appearance at the second hearing.Â  Husband contends this \r\n  was error, and we agree.\r\nInitially, we note that Husband was not at fault for Mrs. Rosenâ€™s \r\n  failure to appear at the first hearing.Â  Furthermore, he should not be penalized \r\n  for exercising his right to question the reasonableness and validity of Mrs. \r\n  Rosenâ€™s charges.Â  See Green v. Durham Life Ins. Co., 287 S.C. \r\n  197, 199, 336 S.E.2d 478, 480 (1985) (affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision not \r\n  to award attorneyâ€™s fees because respondent should not be penalized for litigating \r\n  a meritorious issue).Â  Thus, although the award of attorneyâ€™s fees is within \r\n  the discretion of the family court, \r\n  [10]  we reverse the award to the extent that it reimbursed Wifeâ€™s attorneys \r\n  for their fees from the second hearing.Â  It was an abuse of discretion to penalize \r\n  Husband for exercising his right to cross-examine Mrs. Rosen.Â Â Â Â Â  Husband is \r\n  therefore obligated to pay $2,885.25 rather than $4,725.25 for the fees incurred \r\n  by Wifeâ€™s attorneys for the contempt action.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        12.&nbsp;  \r\n          \r\n        Whether the family court erred in requiring Husband to pay uncovered medicals \r\n  within fourteen days of date of mailing or faxing  \r\n          \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe final order \r\n  of the family court requires Husband to pay Wife his portion of the uncovered \r\n  medical expenses within fourteen days of receiving an itemization by Wife.Â  \r\n  After Husband failed to make timely payments, the family court found Husband \r\n  in contempt and ordered him to provide Wife with a facsimile number to which \r\n  she could send notice of expenses.Â  If Husband failed to provide a number, Wife \r\n  could serve notice by certified mail.Â  In either event, the court ordered Husband \r\n  to pay Wife his portion of the uncovered medical expenses within fourteen days \r\n  from which the notice was faxed or mailed.Â  Husband contends this was error.Â  \r\n  We agree. \r\nWife has not submitted \r\n  any evidence that this short time period is necessary to ensure a timely payment \r\n  of the bills or continued treatment of the child.Â  Therefore, we find fourteen \r\n  days from the time notice is faxed or mailed to be an unreasonably short period \r\n  of time given the nature and potential amount of the childâ€™s uncovered medical \r\n  expenses. See Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 204, 414 \r\n  S.E.2d 157, 160 (1992) (explaining that, in appeals from the family court, the \r\n  appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence).Â  Instead, we find it equitable to both parties for Husband \r\n  to pay Wife his portion of the uncovered medical expenses within thirty days \r\n  of the date notice is faxed or mailed.Â  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        13.&nbsp;  \r\n          \r\n        Whether the family court erred in excluding testimony of Brian Clark  \r\n          \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Wife moved to hold Husband in contempt for discovery abuses.Â  \r\n  The family court found Husband had failed to comply with discovery and imposed \r\n  sanctions on Husband by awarding Wife $10,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  At trial, \r\n  Husband sought to introduce testimony from Brian Clark and certain exhibits \r\n  â€œto clear the air on compliance with discovery requests.â€Â  The family \r\n  court excluded the testimony, stating the issue had already been ruled upon.Â  \r\n  On appeal, Husband argues the testimony was relevant to show that he had fully \r\n  complied with discovery.Â  Husband makes no argument regarding this issue and \r\n  cites no authority. [11] Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find the issue is abandoned on appeal.Â  See Glasscock, Inc. v. \r\n  Fidelity and Guar. Co., 348 S.C. 76, 81, 557 S.E.2d 689, 691 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (â€œ[S]hort, conclusory statements made without supporting authority are deemed \r\n  abandoned on appeal and therefore not presented for review.â€). \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        14. \r\n   \r\n        Whether the family court erred in awarding $10,000 attorneysâ€™ fees due \r\n  to abuse in discovery. \r\n   \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nAs explained above, \r\n  the family court awarded Wife $10,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees after finding Husband \r\n  failed to comply with discovery.Â  Husband argues this was error.Â  We find this \r\n  issue was not timely appealed.\r\nAn order finding a party \r\n  in contempt is immediately appealable.Â  See Hooper v. Rockwell, \r\n  334 S.C. 281, 291, 513 S.E.2d 358, 364 (1999).Â  Because the order was not appealed \r\n  within the thirty-day limit under Rule 203(b)(3), SCACR, we dismiss this issue \r\n  on appeal.Â  See Rule 203(d)(3), SCACR (â€œIf the notice is not timely filed \r\n  or the filing fee is not paid in full, the appeal shall be dismissed, and shall \r\n  not be reinstated except as provided by Rule 231.â€).\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        15.  \r\n          \r\n        Whether the family court judge erred in failing to recuse himself  \r\n          \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nHusband argues \r\n  that the family court judge erred in failing to recuse himself from the hearing \r\n  on Wifeâ€™s action for contempt following the trial.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Code of Judicial Conduct requires a judge to â€˜disqualify himself in a proceeding \r\n  in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.â€™ Canon 3(C)(1) of \r\n  the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR. A judge must exercise sound judicial \r\n  discretion in determining whether his impartiality might reasonably be questioned. \r\n  Absent evidence of judicial prejudice, a judge's failure to disqualify himself \r\n  will not be reversed on appeal. It is not enough for a party seeking disqualification \r\n  to simply allege bias. The party must show some evidence of bias. Furthermore, \r\n  the alleged bias must be personal, as distinguished from judicial, in nature. \r\n\r\n\r\nParker v. Shecut, 340 S.C. 460, \r\n  497, 531 S.E.2d 546, 566 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on other grounds by 349 \r\n  S.C. 226, 562 S.E.2d 620 (2002).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHusband has failed to \r\n  present any evidence of bias by the family court judge.Â  It is not sufficient \r\n  for Husband to assert bias in the contempt action because the same judge presided \r\n  at the final hearing and ruled against him.Â  See Mallett v. Mallett, \r\n  323 S.C. 141, 147, 473 S.E.2d 804, 808 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œThe fact a trial judge \r\n  ultimately rules against a litigant is not proof of prejudice by the judge, \r\n  even if it is later held the judge committed error in his rulings.â€).Â  Therefore, \r\n  we find no error in the family court judgeâ€™s failure to recuse himself. \r\n\r\n  B.&nbsp;&nbsp; WIFEâ€™S CROSS-APPEAL\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         1.&nbsp;  \r\n        Whether the family courtâ€™s equitable \r\n  division of the property was erroneous.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWife argues that \r\n  the family court judgeâ€™s equitable division of marital property was tainted \r\n  because he failed to address the fifteen factors listed in section 20-7-472 \r\n  of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2003).Â  We disagree.\r\nSection 20-7-472 sets forth factors \r\n  the family court should consider when equitably dividing a marital estate and \r\n  vests the family court with discretion to decide what weight to assign each \r\n  factor.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 100, 545 S.E.2d 531,537 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).Â  â€œThis court will affirm the family court judge if it can be determined \r\n  that the judge addressed the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for \r\n  us to conclude he was cognizant of the statutory factors.â€Â  Id.\r\n\r\n In this case, the family court judge specifically stated: â€œI have \r\n  applied the factors listed in Â§ 20-7-472 and relevant case law to divide the \r\n  property . . . .â€Â  Therefore, we are satisfied that the judge was cognizant \r\n  of the fifteen statutory factors set forth in section 20-7-472.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we affirm the family courtâ€™s division of marital property.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         2.&nbsp; \r\n   \r\n        Whether the family court erred in excluding a real estate lot \r\n   \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nWife \r\n  argues the family court erred in excluding from the final order a parcel of \r\n  land that was marital property.Â  The specific lot allegedly excluded was â€œlot \r\n  A 39-4,â€ part of the marital property known as the Boozer-Arnal lots.Â  We find \r\n  this issue is not preserved.\r\nAt trial, Wife offered into evidence appraised values of the â€œBoozer-Arnal \r\n  lots.â€ However, the appraiser mistakenly appraised â€œlot A 38-4,â€ a lot that \r\n  Husband never owned, instead of â€œlot A 39-4,â€ which Husband owned.Â  In the final \r\n  order, the family court identifies the marital property to include the Boozer-Arnal \r\n  property, but specifically excludes the lot improperly appraised by Wifeâ€™s expert, \r\n  lot A 38-4.Â  In valuing these lots, the final order accepts the values of Wifeâ€™s \r\n  expert.Â  Because Wifeâ€™s expert did not value lot A 39-4, Wife did not receive \r\n  any of the lotâ€™s value, even though it was deemed marital property.\r\nAfter the family court \r\n  issued its order, Wife did not file a Rule 59(e) motion raising the issue of \r\n  the value of lot A 39-4 to the family court judge.Â  Thus, this issue is not \r\n  preserved for appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, \r\n  76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998); Halbersberg v.

Hunter regarding Six Oaks Cemetery \r\n  and Brian Clark regarding discovery compliance.Â  Further, we affirm the family \r\n  court judgeâ€™s decision not to recuse himself from the contempt action following \r\n  the final hearing.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe reverse the family courtâ€™s \r\n  decision to impute income to Husband and assign Husband income in the amount \r\n  of $59,010 annually.Â  We also reverse the family courtâ€™s requirement that Husband \r\n  pay all of the guardianâ€™s fees incurred during trial and find the parties should \r\n  bear that expense equally.Â  Further, we reverse the family courtâ€™s exclusion \r\n  of the trust corpuses; denial of Easter and summer visitation; award of $65,000 \r\n  in attorneysâ€™ fees to Wife; award of $4,725.25 in attorneysâ€™ fees on the post-trial \r\n  contempt action; and requirement that Husband pay uncovered medical expenses \r\n  within fourteen days, finding thirty days to be more equitable.Â  Finally, we \r\n  reverse the award of $65,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees to Wife and order each party \r\n  to bear their own attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  \r\nWe remand the issues \r\n  of child support, uncovered medical bills, Easter and summer visitation, and \r\n  reimbursement for Husbandâ€™s trips to Brevard.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED in part, \r\n  REVERSED in part, and REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The partiesâ€™ child reached forty-three months of age on February \r\n    7, 2003.Â  Nevertheless, this court learned during oral argument in September \r\n    of 2004 that Husband is still not exercising weekend visitation in Hilton \r\n    Head.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Husbandâ€™s monthly income as reflected on his financial declaration \r\n    was $3,656.56.Â  This income plus the additional imputed income total $9,060.12.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Because these parties have such a litigious history, we have attempted \r\n    to remand as few issues as possible.Â  However, we are not able to calculate \r\n    child support ourselves because the record does not reflect how much Wife \r\n    pays each month for the childâ€™s health insurance.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  The trust document does not appear in the record.Â  Wifeâ€™s expert \r\n    testified that Henry Bernheim is the trustee, however, Husbandâ€™s expert testified \r\n    that the trust document suggested Wife was a co-trustee with Bernheim.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Evidence in the record indicated that Wife presently lives â€œdown \r\n    the streetâ€ from the South Carolina border.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Wife has also received payment from the trust from sale proceeds \r\n    of Six Oaks Cemetery, an asset contained in the trust corpus.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  This trust corpus has contained some significant assets in the past, \r\n    including the Umbro corporation.Â  After its sale, Wife received approximately \r\n    $134,000 from the trust.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  At trial, the guardian suggested Wife pay Husband $300 per month \r\n    to help defray the cost of exercising visitation in Brevard.Â Â  On appeal, \r\n    Husband argues the family court abused its discretion in failing to follow \r\n    this recommendation.Â  Because we reverse and remand the issue of travel costs \r\n    based on the family courtâ€™s failure to consider the trust corpuses, we need \r\n    not address this issue.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, \r\n    Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining that the \r\n    appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior \r\n    issues is dispositive).Â  Husband also argues that the issue of child support \r\n    should be reversed and remanded because the family court failed to consider \r\n    the expenses he incurred each time he exercised visitation in Brevard.Â  However, \r\n    this argument was not raised to the family court at trial, and therefore is \r\n    not preserved for appeal.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. \r\n    71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  In calculating the fees incurred by Mr. Rosen at the first hearing, \r\n    the family court subtracted the amount estimated by Mrs. Rosenâ€™s appearance \r\n    at the hearing, $875, from the total submitted in the affidavit, $2,635.25, \r\n    and added Mr. Rosenâ€™s fee for his appearance, $1,125, totaling $2,885.25.Â  \r\n    Added to this was the $1,860 in attorneysâ€™ and paralegal fees.Â  Although this \r\n    sum comes to $4,745.25, the family court awarded $4,725.25.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [10]  Lindsay v.

Code Ann. Â§ 62-2-803 (1987).Â  Our supreme court \r\n  has previously held the statute is broad enough to cover conspiracy such that \r\n  a conspirator would be barred from benefiting from the death.Â  Wilson v. \r\n  Wilson, 319 S.C. 370, 372-73, 461 S.E.2d 816, 817 (1995).Â  In this case \r\n  brought under section 62-2-803, the sole issue presented is whether the trial \r\n  court correctly refused to charge the jury that proof of an overt act was required \r\n  to prove the alleged conspiracy.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s refusal to so \r\n  instruct the jury. \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nFollowing their sonâ€™s murder, Lloyd and Helen Pinion brought this action against \r\n  their sonâ€™s widow, Edie Pinion, to prevent her from benefiting from his death.Â  \r\n  Based on a juryâ€™s finding that Edie had conspired with another person to feloniously \r\n  and intentionally kill her husband, \r\n  [1]  the court ordered she could not be an heir or beneficiary from or through \r\n  his estate and was not entitled to collect his life insurance proceeds, retirement \r\n  benefits, or similar contractual payments.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA criminal conspiracy is the combination of two or more persons â€œfor \r\n  the purpose of accomplishing an unlawful object or lawful object by unlawful \r\n  means.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-410 (2003).Â  â€œIt may be proven by the specific \r\n  overt acts done in furtherance of the conspiracy but the crime is the agreement.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316, 323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001).Â  Under \r\n  South Carolina law, criminal conspiracy does not require overt acts.Â  State \r\n  v. Wilson, 315 S.C. 289, 294, 433 S.E.2d 864, 867-68 (1993).Â  A civil conspiracy \r\n  is the combination of two or more persons to injure a plaintiff and cause him \r\n  special injuries thereby.Â  In contrast with a criminal conspiracy, a civil conspiracy \r\n  is actionable only if overt acts pursuant to the conspiracy proximately cause \r\n  damage to the plaintiff.Â  Future Group, II v. Nationsbank, 324 S.C. 89, \r\n  100, 478 S.E.2d 45, 50-51 (1996).Â  Edie sought a jury charge based on the law \r\n  of civil conspiracy.Â  However, section 62-2-803, although not itself a criminal \r\n  statute, applies only to situations where the deceased was intentionally and \r\n  feloniously killed, which is a crime.Â  Thus, it follows any conspiracy triggering \r\n  this statute would also be criminal, rather than civil.Â  Our conclusion is supported \r\n  by Wilson v. Wilson, the case in which our supreme court held the statute \r\n  was broad enough to cover conspiracy.Â  In that case, the court held â€œ[w]hile \r\n  conspiracy could be sufficient to invoke the statute, the elements of criminal \r\n  conspiracy were not established in this instance to support a finding that \r\n  petitioner feloniously and intentionally killed the insured.â€Â  Wilson, \r\n  319 S.C. at 373, 461 S.E.2d at 817 (emphasis added and footnote listing the \r\n  elements of criminal conspiracy omitted).Â  This clearly shows our supreme court \r\n  concluded any conspiracy triggering the application of this statute would be \r\n  criminal.Â  \r\nNevertheless, Edie contends because this is a civil \r\n  action with a civil burden of proof, the civil rather than criminal definition \r\n  of conspiracy should apply.Â  Subsection (e) of section 62-2-803 provides a conviction \r\n  for felonious and intentional killing is conclusive proof under the statute.Â  \r\n  In the absence of a conviction, subsection (e) states the civil â€œpreponderance \r\n  of evidenceâ€ standard applies.Â  However, use of a civil burden of proof does \r\n  not negate the fact the triggering event is the criminal act of a â€œfelonious \r\n  and intentional killing.â€Â  \r\nBecause an overt act is not required to establish criminal conspiracy, \r\n  and the statute applies to one who criminally conspires to commit a felonious \r\n  and intentional killing, the trial court properly refused to instruct the jury \r\n  that an overt act was required in this case.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nANDERSON and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n    Edieâ€™s son, Matt Baum, was convicted of the murder.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3945","title":"S.C.

Caldwell, who purchased Tree Service \r\n  during a time it did business with Labor Limited, and John Martin, Jr., a Tree \r\n  Service manager.Â  In the affidavits and depositions, Caldwell and Martin questioned \r\n  the credibility of the Labor Limited invoices based on their knowledge of the \r\n  normal business practices of Tree Service.Â  The trial court granted the summary \r\n  judgment motion and entered judgment in favor of Labor Limited.Â  Tree Service \r\n  filed a motion to alter or amend pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, and the trial \r\n  court denied the motion.Â  Tree Service appeals.Â  We reverse. \r\nâ€œWhen reviewing the grant of summary judgment, the appellate court \r\n  applies the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), \r\n  SCRCP.â€Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 494, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 \r\n  (2002). â€œSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is no genuine \r\n  issue of material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€ Baird v.

Dana Sinkler, of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.:Â  John Conway sued Charleston \r\n  Lincoln Mercury (CLM) and Haywood Hyman, its sole shareholder and president, \r\n  alleging breach of contract, unpaid wages, fraud, and constructive fraud arising \r\n  from an alleged oral agreement between Hyman and Conway to pay Conway a severance \r\n  allowance.Â  After a bench trial, the trial court issued an order finding for \r\n  CLM and Hyman on all claims.Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nBACKGROUND\r\nCLM initially hired Conway as an independent contractor \r\n  when Hyman was negotiating to sell the company.Â  After one negotiation fell \r\n  through, Conway and another employee, Al Shuman, discussed purchasing CLM.Â  \r\n  However, on a trip to Hymanâ€™s home in Richmond, Virginia, Hyman informed Conway \r\n  he did not intend to sell the company to Conway and Shuman and was in talks \r\n  with another party.Â  Conway alleges Hyman asked him to work to get the company \r\n  ready for sale and to keep Shuman from leaving the company.Â  Conway contends \r\n  Hyman promised him $120,000 in severance in exchange for his efforts should \r\n  he not be offered employment comparable to his then employment following a sale.Â  \r\n  Conway testified he prepared a memorandum memorializing the agreement he made \r\n  with Hyman.Â  Conway asserts he presented a copy of this memorandum to Hyman, \r\n  but Hyman did not sign it.Â  Later, Conway drafted another memorandum, entitled \r\n  â€œMemorandum to File,â€ setting forth his version of the events surrounding the \r\n  agreement and reciting the terms of the agreement as presented to Hyman.Â  Conway \r\n  placed a copy of this memorandum in his personnel file where a CLM accounts \r\n  payable clerk found it approximately a year later.Â  \r\nEventually, another buyer was identified and a \r\n  contract was executed for the sale of CLMâ€™s assets.Â  After the sale closed, \r\n  Conway continued his employment with the dealership for a short time as an independent \r\n  contractor, but never became a full-time employee of the new owner.Â  \r\nConway then filed this action, alleging \r\n  CLM and Hyman failed to pay him the $120,000 severance as promised in the oral \r\n  agreement.Â  Following a non-jury trial, the court ruled in favor of CLM and \r\n  Hyman on all of Conwayâ€™s claims.Â  Among other things, the trial court ruled \r\n  no valid contract between the parties for severance ever existed because the \r\n  written agreement was never executed as Conway anticipated.Â  The court also \r\n  denied Conwayâ€™s post-trial motions.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.Â  Existence of an Oral Contract\r\nConway contends the \r\n  trial court erred in not finding an oral contract existed between he and CLM.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nAn action for breach of contract seeking damages \r\n  is an action at law.Â  Sterling Dev. Co. v. Collins, 309 S.C. 237, 240, 421 S.E.2d 402, 404 (1992).Â  In an action at law \r\n  tried without a jury, the trial courtâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed \r\n  on appeal unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence or controlled \r\n  by error of law.Â  Gordon v. Colonial Ins. Co. of California, \r\n  342 S.C. 152, 155, 536 S.E.2d 376, 378 (Ct. App. 2000).Â \r\nBecause Conway alleges he and Hyman formed the \r\n  contract in Virginia, Virginia law must be applied to determine whether a valid \r\n  contract was formed.Â  Unisun Ins. Co. v. Hertz Rental Corp., 312 S.C. \r\n  549, 551-52, 436 S.E.2d 182, 184 (Ct. App. 1993) (â€œUnless the parties agree \r\n  to a different rule, the validity and interpretation of a contract is ordinarily \r\n  to be determined by the law of the state in which the contract was made.â€).Â  \r\n  Under Virginia law, a writing is not always necessary to form a valid contract.Â  \r\n  Harris v. Citizen Bank &amp; Trust Co., 200 S.E. 652, 665 (Va. 1939).Â  \r\n  However, â€œ[i]f it be understood that its terms are to be reduced to writing \r\n  as an ultimate expression of conclusions reached . . . then a writing is necessary.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 665.Â  \r\nThe trial courtâ€™s conclusion that no valid agreement \r\n  existed is supported by the evidence.Â  The record indicates the parties meant \r\n  for the agreement to be reduced to writing as a prerequisite to the formation \r\n  of a contract.Â  Conway testified that after his conversation with Hyman regarding \r\n  the payment of severance, Conway reduced the terms of that agreement to writing \r\n  and gave Hyman a copy the next morning.Â  Conway admitted Hyman told him he was \r\n  not feeling well and could not read it at that time.Â  \r\nConwayâ€™s memo to file also contains evidence of \r\n  the partiesâ€™ intentions.Â  The memoâ€™s subject line states:Â  â€œEmployment Agreements \r\n  &amp; Severance Pay.â€Â  Conway testified he created the document after his trip \r\n  to Richmond and it â€œmemorialized the agreement Mr. Hyman and I came to [during \r\n  his trip].â€Â  The memo states:Â  \r\n\r\nMr. Conway presented Mr. Hyman a new written Employment \r\n  Agreement for himself as well as a Memorandum outlining the Estate and Business \r\n  Planning that had been discussed previously with Mr. Douglas.Â  Mr. Hyman started \r\n  to look the documents over and then said that he wasnâ€™t feeling well and that \r\n  he couldnâ€™t go through them right then because he wasnâ€™t feeling well and was \r\n  tired.Â  He said he would look them over later and get back to Mr. Conway, since \r\n  he (Mr. Conway) was preparing to leave to return to Charleston.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.)Â  The memorandum then recites the \r\n  â€œtext of the written text of the Employment Agreement.â€Â  The terms of this Employment \r\n  Agreement included Conwayâ€™s right to receive a $120,000 severance at the closing \r\n  of the sale of CLM if CLM were unable to offer him continued employment.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Conwayâ€™s wife, Carol Conway, testified \r\n  she was present when the alleged oral agreement was formed.Â  She confirmed Conway \r\n  produced a written memo the next day that included the points he and Hyman discussed.Â  \r\n  She stated Conway gave a copy of the memo along with other documents to Hyman \r\n  in her presence and said Mr. Hyman remarked â€œhe didnâ€™t feel well.Â  That he didnâ€™t \r\n  want to read over anything like that because he was feeling bad and I assume \r\n  that he really was and that he would sign it, just to leave the papers and he \r\n  would sign them and send them to John.Â  And that was it.â€Â  \r\nThe trial court could infer from this evidence \r\n  that the parties presumed their oral negotiations were to be reduced to writing \r\n  before a contract was formed.Â  Additionally, according to the memo Conway placed \r\n  in the file, the terms of the agreement were in fact reduced to writing in the \r\n  form of an employment agreement.Â  Therefore, Conwayâ€™s testimony, his wifeâ€™s \r\n  testimony, and the file memo contemplating a written agreement, sufficiently \r\n  support the trial courtâ€™s finding that the parties intended for the agreement \r\n  to be reduced to writing.Â  Because the trial court found the prerequisite of \r\n  a written agreement was not satisfied, it properly determined a valid agreement \r\n  did not exist. [1] Â  \r\nII.Â  Hymanâ€™s Deposition\r\nAs part of his argument that an oral agreement \r\n  existed, Conway contends the trial court erred in allowing the defense to admit \r\n  Hymanâ€™s deposition in lieu of testimony.Â  The trial court allowed the deposition \r\n  after the defense submitted a physicianâ€™s letter documenting Hymanâ€™s Alzheimerâ€™s \r\n  disease and significant deterioration of his memory.Â  Conway complains the deposition \r\n  was the sole evidence in support of the position of CLM and Hyman that no valid \r\n  agreement existed and should not have been admitted.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe decision to admit or exclude evidence is within \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent \r\n  an abuse of discretion.Â  Gamble v. Intâ€™l Paper Realty Corp. of South Carolina, \r\n  323 S.C. 367, 373, 474 S.E.2d 438, 441 (1996).Â  To warrant a reversal based \r\n  on the admission of evidence, the appellant must show both error and resulting \r\n  prejudice.Â  Commerce Ctr. of Greenville, Inc. v. W. Powers McElveen \r\n  &amp; Assocs. Inc., 347 S.C. \r\n  545, 559, 556 S.E.2d 718, 726 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  When improperly admitted evidence \r\n  is merely cumulative, no prejudice exists, and therefore, the admission is not \r\n  reversible error.Â  Creech v. South Carolina Wildlife &amp; Marine \r\n  Res. Depâ€™t, 328 S.C. 24, 35, 491 S.E.2d 571, 576 \r\n  (1997).Â  \r\nRegardless of whether the trial court properly \r\n  admitted Hymanâ€™s deposition, Conway did not suffer prejudice from its admission.Â  \r\n  This evidence was merely cumulative to the evidence discussed above.Â  Conwayâ€™s \r\n  own testimony, his wifeâ€™s testimony, and the Memorandum to File support the \r\n  courtâ€™s finding that no valid agreement existed.Â  In addition, when the court \r\n  ruled the deposition admissible, it specifically informed the parties they were \r\n  free to call Hyman as a witness.Â  Conway chose to forgo this opportunity. Â Therefore, \r\n  we find no basis for reversal.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Alleged Discovery Abuses\r\nAfter trial, Conway moved for relief \r\n  from judgment on several grounds under Rule 60, SCRCP, including newly discovered \r\n  evidence.Â  At the hearing on the motion, Conway asked for a new trial and argued \r\n  Hyman and CLM had engaged in a pattern of discovery abuses.Â  The trial court \r\n  denied Conwayâ€™s motion.Â  Conway argues the courtâ€™s ruling as to discovery abuses \r\n  was error.Â  We disagree. \r\nDiscovery rights afford a trial attorney the opportunity to prepare for trial.Â  \r\n  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 113-14, 495 S.E.2d 213, 217 (Ct. App. \r\n  1997).Â  Where these rights are not accorded, prejudice is presumed and unless \r\n  the party that failed to comply establishes a lack of prejudice, reversal is \r\n  required.Â  Id. at 114, 495 S.E.2d at 217.\r\nConway asserts three instances of discovery abuse by CLM and Hyman.Â  They \r\n  neither individually nor collectively support his request for a new trial.Â  \r\n\r\nFirst, he contends the defendants should have apprised him of Hymanâ€™s medical \r\n  condition or provided him with a copy of his doctorâ€™s letter prior to trial.Â  \r\n  Assuming this information should have been revealed to Conway pretrial, we are \r\n  unable to discern how advance warning of Hymanâ€™s condition would have aided \r\n  Conway or made any difference in the case.Â  There is no indication that advance \r\n  knowledge of Hymanâ€™s ailment would have assisted Conway in doing anything more \r\n  than he did.Â  \r\nNext, Conway points to a document the defense offered though an expert witness \r\n  that had never been provided to Conway during discovery.Â  Although the document \r\n  was initially admitted, the trial court later struck it pursuant to Conwayâ€™s \r\n  motion to strike.Â  Because the document was stricken from the record and there \r\n  is no indication that it was relied on by the trial court in its decision, we \r\n  find no prejudice.\r\nConwayâ€™s final assertion of discovery abuse concerns \r\n  the defenseâ€™s failure to provide him with notes and a memo written by James \r\n  Starnes, a consultant Hyman hired to investigate CLMâ€™s outstanding liabilities.Â  \r\n  Conway alleges an excerpt from Starnesâ€™ handwritten notes shows three attorneys \r\n  who represented the defendants, including one who also served as a fact witness \r\n  in the case, all believed Conway was entitled to severance.Â  CLM and Hyman had \r\n  listed Starnes as a fact witness several months before trial, but later decided \r\n  not to call him.Â  After learning he would not be called, Conway cancelled his \r\n  scheduled deposition of Starnes.Â  \r\nAfter trial, as a result of a case Al Shuman brought \r\n  against CLM, Conway discovered Starnesâ€™ documents.Â  The passage in question \r\n  is from Starnesâ€™ handwritten notes and reads:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         J.C.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Ry [Marchant] thinks Alâ€™s entitled to the \r\n  severance\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Zuckerman Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  &quot;Â Â  &quot; Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &quot;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Thompson Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  &quot;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Â  &quot;Â Â  &quot; Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &quot;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nConway argues the note suggests three of Hyman and \r\n  CLMâ€™s attorneys (Marchant, Zuckerman, and Thompson) believed Conway was entitled \r\n  to a severance and the defense made a deliberate decision to withhold this information.Â  \r\n  First, we note the passage originally said â€œAlâ€™s entitled to severanceâ€ and \r\n  it is not clear who struck Al and inserted J.C. or when this took place.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  the passage comes from a portion of the notes Starnes labeled â€œConversation \r\n  w/J. Conway.â€Â  A thorough review of the notes and a comparison of them to the \r\n  memo Starnes prepared based on the notes clearly indicate the source of the \r\n  statements was Conway himself, rather than the three attorneys referenced.Â  \r\n  This deduction is supported by affidavits of Starnes and Marchant.Â  In his affidavit, \r\n  Marchant denied ever telling Starnes or anyone else that he believed Conway \r\n  was entitled to severance pay.Â  Starnes, in his affidavit, stated the disputed \r\n  passage refers to statements Conway made to him and not to comments made by \r\n  Marchant, Zuckerman, or Thompson.Â  He further stated none of the three attorneys \r\n  ever told him they believed Conway was entitled to the severance.Â  Conway was \r\n  not prejudiced by the defenseâ€™s failure to produce Starnesâ€™ documents containing \r\n  Conwayâ€™s own self-serving statements.\r\nThrough their argument and the \r\n  record, Hyman and CLM have established Conway was not prejudiced by any of the \r\n  discovery abuses he alleges occurred.Â  The trial court properly denied Conwayâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial.\r\n AFFIRMED.Â  \r\n ANDERSON and SHORT, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Because we affirm the trial court on this issue, we need not \r\n    address Conwayâ€™s argument that the trial court erred in concluding severance \r\n    pay is not wages under S.C. Code Ann. section 41-10-80 (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3947","title":"Chassereau v.

Parker, of Hampton, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J.:Â  Global Sun-Pools, Inc. and Ken Darwin appeal from the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s order denying their motion to compel arbitration.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn April 19, 2003, Vicki Chassereau and Global-Sun Pools signed a \r\n  contract for the construction of an aboveground pool at Chassereauâ€™s residence \r\n  in Varnville, South Carolina.Â  The purchase price was $6,765.00.Â  The contract \r\n  contained an arbitration provision, more fully described below, that requires \r\n  any arbitrable dispute to be conducted not in Varnville, South Carolina, but \r\n  in Carson City, Nevada.Â  At the same time, Chassereau signed an installment \r\n  sales contract to finance the transaction.Â  \r\nShortly after Global-Sun Pools completed construction, Chassereau \r\n  began experiencing problems with the pool.Â  She requested a part from Global-Sun \r\n  Pools so the pool would function properly.Â  After Global-Sun Pools failed either \r\n  to replace the part or to repair the pool, Chassereau stopped making payments \r\n  on the pool.Â Â Â  \r\nOn September 18, 2003, Chassereau filed a complaint against the appellants \r\n  alleging that, after she stopped making payments, Ken Darwin and other employees \r\n  of Global-Sun Pools made a series of harassing and intimidating telephone calls \r\n  to her workplace, Harper Skilled Nursing Facility.Â  Chassereau asserted Darwin \r\n  and the other employees left â€œmessages disclosing [her] private and personal \r\n  finances to her co-employeesâ€ and â€œmade false and defamatory statements about \r\n  [her] during their conversations with [her] co-employees and supervisor.â€Â  Chassereau \r\n  specifically alleged that Darwin â€œfalsely and with malice defamed [her] by accusing \r\n  her of dishonestyâ€ in conversations with her supervisor, co-employees, and relatives.Â  \r\n  Darwin also allegedly â€œmade numerous [tele]phone callsâ€ to Chassereau â€œin an \r\n  effort to intimidate and harass herâ€ and made harassing telephone calls to Chassereauâ€™s \r\n  relatives.Â  Chassereau asserted the calls continued despite her repeated requests \r\n  that the harassment stop and her supervisorâ€™s request that the calls to their \r\n  place of employment cease.Â  \r\nIn her complaint, Chassereau asserted causes of action for (1) defamation; \r\n  (2) violation of South Carolina law prohibiting unlawful use of a telephone, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-17-430 (2003) [1] ; and (3) intentional infliction of emotional \r\n  distress.Â  \r\nThe appellants filed a motion to stay and to compel arbitration, \r\n  asserting clauses contained in the construction contract and the installment \r\n  sales contract require arbitration.Â  After a hearing, the circuit court denied \r\n  the motion, finding â€œ[t]he complaint is based upon tortious conduct of the employees \r\n  of [Global-Sun Pools] unrelated to the contractâ€ and â€œthe allegations of the \r\n  complaint do not arise out of nor do they relate to the contract[.]â€Â  This appeal \r\n  followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe question whether a claim is subject to arbitration is a matter for judicial \r\n  determination, unless the parties have provided otherwise. \r\n  [2] Â  Appeal from the denial of a motion to compel arbitration is subject \r\n  to de novo review. [3] Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe appellants contend the circuit court erred in refusing to stay \r\n  the legal action and to compel arbitration of Chassereauâ€™s claims because the \r\n  contracts mandate arbitration and the claims are so interwoven with the contracts \r\n  that the claims could not be maintained separately. \r\nArbitration is a matter of contract, and a party cannot be required \r\n  to submit to arbitration any dispute that the party has not agreed to submit. \r\n  [4] Â  â€œArbitration rests on the agreement of the parties, and the range \r\n  of issues that can be arbitrated is restricted by the terms of the agreement.â€ [5] Â  \r\n&nbsp;â€œTo decide whether an arbitration agreement encompasses a dispute \r\n  a court must determine whether the factual allegations underlying the claim \r\n  are within the scope of the broad arbitration clause, regardless of the label \r\n  assigned to the claim.â€ [6] Â  \r\n  â€œAny doubts concerning the scope of arbitration should be resolved in favor \r\n  of arbitration.â€ [7] Â  \r\nIn the current appeal, the partiesâ€™ construction contract contains \r\n  an arbitration provision that, because of its length and format, taxes the eyes.Â  \r\n  It states in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nSECTION G) BINDING ARBITRATION AGREEMENT:Â  ANY DISPUTES ARISING IN ANY MANNER \r\n  RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT THAT CANNOT BE RESOLVED BY NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE \r\n  PARTIES SHALL BE SUBJECTED TO MANDATORY, EXCLUSIVE AND BINDING ARBITRATION IN \r\n  CARSON CITY, NEVADA . . . .Â  THE SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY OF THE PURCHASER \r\n  AND THE OBLIGATION OF THE DEALER FOR THE MATTERS SET FORTH HEREIN WHETHER ON \r\n  WARRANTY, CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE OR STRICT LIABILITY, IS THE REPAIR OF THE DEFECT.Â  \r\n  THE DEALER SHALL IN NO WAY BE LIABLE FOR SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. . \r\n  . .Â  THE COURT SHALL DECIDE WHETHER AN AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE EXISTS OR A CONTROVERSY \r\n  IS SUBJECT TO ANY AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE.  [8] Â  \r\n\r\nThe language at \r\n  issue here is the phrase â€œany disputes arising in any manner relating to this \r\n  agreement.â€Â Â Â  \r\nWe recently held that â€œa clause compelling arbitration for any claim â€˜arising \r\n  out of or relating to this agreementâ€™ may cover disputes outside the agreement, \r\n  but only if those disputes relate to the subject matter of that agreement.â€ \r\n  [9] Â  We observed that, the mere fact that an arbitration clause could apply \r\n  to matters beyond the express scope of the underlying contract did not imply \r\n  that arbitration would be required for every dispute between the parties. [10] Â  We distinguished this language from clauses \r\n  compelling arbitration of any matter arising out of the â€œrelationship of the \r\n  parties.â€Â  In the latter case, it would not matter whether a claim related to \r\n  a contract containing an arbitration clause or not. [11] Â  Rather, the only question would be whether the claim concerned \r\n  the relationship of the parties. \r\n  [12] Â  \r\nOur supreme court has held that â€œ[a] broadly-worded arbitration clause applies \r\n  to disputes that do not arise under the governing contract when a â€˜significant \r\n  relationshipâ€™ exists between the asserted claims and the contract in which the \r\n  arbitration clause is contained.â€ [13] Â  The court noted the following test has been \r\n  used in some jurisdictions to determine whether a particular tort claim falls \r\n  within the scope of an agreement to arbitrate:Â  \r\n\r\nThe test is based on a determination whether the particular tort claim is so \r\n  interwoven with the contract that it could not stand alone.Â  If the tort and \r\n  contract claims are so interwoven, both are arbitrable.Â  On the other hand, \r\n  if the tort claim is completely independent of the contract and could be maintained \r\n  without reference to the contract, the tort claim is not arbitrable. [14] \r\n\r\nIn our opinion, Chassereauâ€™s claims for defamation, unlawful use of a telephone, \r\n  and intentional infliction of emotional distress cannot be considered claims \r\n  â€œarising out ofâ€ the contract [15]  any more than would a claim that Darwin and \r\n  other employees of Global-Sun Pools had gone to Chassereauâ€™s workplace and verbally \r\n  or physically attacked her. \r\nÂ Not only do Chassereauâ€™s claims involve actions taken by the appellants that \r\n  do not arise out of the contract between Chassereau and Global-Sun Pools, the \r\n  claims can also be proved independently of that contract.Â  Being called â€œdishonestâ€ \r\n  to oneâ€™s supervisor, co-workers, and relatives, harassed by repeated phone calls, \r\n  and subjected to intentional infliction of emotional distress, as alleged in \r\n  the complaint, constitutes tortious behavior that the parties, it seems to us, \r\n  could not have reasonably foreseen and for which we seriously doubt they intended \r\n  to provide a limited means of redress. \r\n  [16] Â  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we agree with the circuit courtâ€™s finding that â€œ[t]he \r\n  complaint is based upon tortious conduct of the employees of [Global-Sun Pools] \r\n  unrelated to the contractâ€ and â€œthe allegations of the complaint do not arise \r\n  out of nor do they relate to the contract[.]â€Â  The circuit court, therefore, \r\n  did not err in denying the motion to compel arbitration.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nHEARN, C.J., and WILLIAMS, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  This statute makes it a misdemeanor to use a telephone to \r\n    make harassing, intimidating, threatening, or obscene phone calls.Â  No issue \r\n    is before us as to whether this statute creates a private right of action.Â  \r\n    See, e.g., Whitlaw v.

Rite Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 S.C. 285, 293, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  45, 49 (Ct. App. 2000). \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. In-Court Identification\r\nDuring the investigation police showed DeWitt a photo lineup.Â  \r\n  DeWitt picked out Carlson without hesitation.Â  However, the picture of Carlson \r\n  was approximately four to five times larger than the other photos.Â  The trial \r\n  judge decided to exclude the lineup, finding it unduly suggestive.Â  Although \r\n  the prior identification was not admitted, the trial judge did allow DeWitt \r\n  to identify Carlson in court.Â  The judge found DeWitt could make a reliable \r\n  in-court identification of Carlson based on factors independent of the improperly \r\n  suggestive lineup.Â  \r\nCarlson first argues the trial court failed to conduct a \r\n  proper hearing on the admissibility of DeWittâ€™s out-of-court identification \r\n  pursuant to Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972) and State v. Ramsey, \r\n  345 S.C. 607, 550 S.E.2d 294 (2001).Â  Generally, a trial court must hold an \r\n  in camera hearing when the State offers a witness whose testimony identifies \r\n  the defendant as the person who committed the crime, and the defendant challenges \r\n  the in-court identification as being tainted by a previous, illegal identification \r\n  or confrontation.Â  Ramsey at 613, 550 S.E.2d at 297 (citing State \r\n  v. Cash, 257 S.C. 249, 185 S.E.2d 525 (1971)); State v. Cheatham, \r\n  349 S.C. 101, 561 S.E.2d 618 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  The purpose of the in camera \r\n  hearing is to determine whether the in-court identification was of independent \r\n  origin or was the tainted product of the circumstances surrounding the prior, \r\n  out-of-court identification.Â Â  See Ramsey at 613, 550 S.E.2d at \r\n  297.Â  \r\nDefense counsel did not object to the procedure used in the \r\n  present case.Â  During pretrial motions, the trial judge suggested that the court \r\n  merely view the pictures rather than require testimony.Â  Counsel for Carlson \r\n  responded: â€œNo objection, Your Honor.â€Â  \r\nÂ â€œAn issue may not be raised for the first time on appeal, \r\n  but must have been raised to the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 120-21, 481 S.E.2d 118, 123 (1997) (citation \r\n  omitted); accord State v. Fleming, 254 S.C. 415, 175 S.E.2d 624 \r\n  (1970); State v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 580 S.E.2d 785 (Ct. App. 2003), \r\n  cert. denied.Â  A party cannot complain of an error which his own conduct \r\n  has induced.Â  State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 513, 316 S.E.2d 395, 399 \r\n  (1984).Â  â€œWhere an objection and the ground therefore is not stated in the record, \r\n  there is no basis for appellate review.â€Â  State v. Morris, 307 S.C. 480, \r\n  485, 415 S.E.2d 819, 823 (Ct. App. 1991).Â  A contemporaneous objection is required \r\n  to preserve issues for direct appellate review.Â  State v. King, 334 S.C. \r\n  504, 514 S.E.2d 578 (1999); State v. Thomason, 355 S.C. 278, 584 S.E.2d \r\n  143 (Ct. App. 2003); State v. Greene, 330 S.C. 551, 499 S.E.2d 817 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1997).Â  Cf. State v. McCrary, 242 S.C. 506, 131 S.E.2d 687 \r\n  (1963) (opining the court was without authority to consider question on appeal \r\n  where defendant consented to being tried on two indictments at same time and \r\n  raised no objection to such mode of trial in trial court).\r\nNot only did Carlson fail to object, but he consented \r\n  to the procedure proposed by the trial judge.Â  Consequently, Carlson failed \r\n  to preserve this issue.\r\nAt oral argument, Carlsonâ€™s appellate counsel contended \r\n  that the right to a hearing was a constitutional due process issue and could \r\n  not be waived.Â  We disagree.Â  A plethora of cases from the appellate entities \r\n  of this state recognize that constitutional rights may be waived.Â  For example, \r\n  in Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 591, 576 S.E.2d 144, 145 (2003), our \r\n  supreme court observed that â€œ[e]ntering a guilty plea results in a waiver of \r\n  several constitutional rights . . . .â€Â  In State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. \r\n  335, 526 S.E.2d 248 (Ct. App. 2000), this Court held that the appellant waived \r\n  his First Amendment right to free speech by failing to preserve the issue for \r\n  review.Â  We noted that constitutional arguments are no exception to the error \r\n  preservation rule, â€œand if not raised to the trial court are deemed waived on \r\n  appeal.â€Â  Id. at 339, 526 S.E.2d at 250.Â  See also State v. \r\n  Downs, 361 S.C. 141, 604 S.E.2d 377 (2004) (acknowledging a defendant may \r\n  waive the right to a trial by jury on both guilt and sentencing); State v. \r\n  Owens, 346 S.C. 637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001) (providing the Fifth Amendment \r\n  privilege against self-incrimination may be waived); Brown v. State, \r\n  340 S.C. 590, 533 S.E.2d 308 (2000) (same); State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. \r\n  604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (2001) (recognizing the Sixth Amendment right to confrontation \r\n  may be waived); State v. Thompson, 355 S.C. 255, 584 S.E.2d 131 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2003) (explaining the waiver of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel and \r\n  comparing waiver by affirmative, verbal request with waiver by conduct).\r\nIn the case sub judice, consent was given \r\n  and constituted waiver of any procedural due process rights.Â  \r\nII. Use of Photograph at Trial\r\nCarlson asserts the trial court erred in allowing a photograph of Carlson to \r\n  be admitted into evidence.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe trial judge did not allow the State to use DeWittâ€™s identification of Carlson \r\n  from the photographic lineup because the judge found the disproportionality \r\n  of Carlsonâ€™s picture vis-Ã -vis the other photos rendered the lineup inappropriately \r\n  suggestive.Â  Carlson argues â€œit was error to allow the same photograph or a \r\n  similar photograph into evidence when the court had held the photographs inadmissible \r\n  as being too suggestive from the photo lineup shown to the victim.â€Â  He explains:Â  \r\n  â€œIt seems logical that the court should not allow the admission of a photo into \r\n  evidence after the court has found that the same photo was too suggestive to \r\n  be used as part of the photo lineup.â€Â  \r\nInitially, we note there are two photographs of Carlson in \r\n  the record.Â  The first picture was taken within a month following the shooting.Â  \r\n  This photo depicts Carlson with his mouth closed and is not marked as an exhibit.Â  \r\n  The second photograph was taken approximately a year after the shooting, while \r\n  Carlson was in jail.Â  In the second picture, Carlson has his mouth open, his \r\n  gold teeth prominently displayed.Â  This picture is marked â€œStateâ€™s Exhibit 29.â€Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the record clearly establishes that the second photographâ€”which \r\n  was not utilized in the pretrial lineupâ€”is the photo that was entered into evidence \r\n  and shown to the jury.Â  In arguing Carlsonâ€™s motion to suppress the pretrial \r\n  photo lineup as unduly suggestive, the State mentioned that DeWitt could make \r\n  an independently reliable in-court identification of Carlson because DeWitt \r\n  observed the shooter had gold teeth, and in the picture used in the lineup, \r\n  Carlsonâ€™s mouth was closed, so his teeth were not visible.Â  \r\nAdditionally, counsel for Carlson objected to the admission \r\n  of Stateâ€™s Exhibit 29 on the ground that it might not be an accurate depiction \r\n  of Carlson at the time the shooting occurred, because it was taken about a year \r\n  after the attack.Â  The picture taken a year after the crime cannot be the same \r\n  photograph utilized in the lineup viewed approximately one month after the attack.Â  \r\n  Thus, by counselâ€™s own admission, the photo entered into evidence was not the \r\n  photograph employed in the pretrial lineup. \r\nFurther, the preservation of this issue is dubious.Â  A defendant \r\n  must object to an in-court identification to properly preserve the issue for \r\n  appeal.Â  See State v. Wakefield, 323 S.C. 189, 196, 473 S.E.2d \r\n  831, 835 (Ct. App. 1996) (â€œWakefield was required to object to the in-court \r\n  identification at trial to properly preserve this issue for appeal.â€).Â  Arguments \r\n  not raised to or ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved for appellate \r\n  review.Â  State v. Wise, 359 S.C. 14, 596 S.E.2d 475 (2004), cert. \r\n  denied; State v. Perez, 334 S.C. 563, 514 S.E.2d 754 (1999).Â  â€œA \r\n  defendant may not argue one ground below and another on appeal.â€Â  State v. \r\n  Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 380, 580 S.E.2d 785, 795 (Ct. App. 2003), cert. \r\n  denied; see also State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d \r\n  691 (2003) (â€œA party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground \r\n  on appeal.â€); accord State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  213 (2001).Â  Carlson noted he â€œwould certainly vehemently oppose the introduction \r\n  of the evidence,â€ and cited the justification that the photograph was â€œtaken \r\n  . . a year after he was in jail,â€ and therefore did not â€œrepresent his appearance \r\n  at the time of the crime.â€Â  Now, on appeal, Carlson contends the photograph \r\n  was unduly suggestive and violates Biggers and Ramsey.Â  This constitutional \r\n  argument was not the basis of the objection at trial.Â  \r\nNevertheless, we do not find Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188 (1972), or \r\n  State v. Ramsey, 345 S.C. 607, 550 S.E.2d 294 (2001), controlling.Â  Biggers \r\n  addressed whether a showup identification was so suggestive that it violated \r\n  the defendantâ€™s right to due process.Â  The victim in Biggers viewed several \r\n  suspects in both lineups and showups, and was shown thirty or forty photographs, \r\n  but was unable to identify her attacker.Â  The police called her in to view a \r\n  suspect who was being detained on another charge.Â  Officers attempted to construct \r\n  a lineup, but were unable to find anyone at the city jail or city juvenile home \r\n  matching the defendantâ€™s description.Â  Thus, they conducted a showup instead, \r\n  and the victim identified the defendant as the perpetrator.Â Â  Under the totality \r\n  of the circumstances, the identification was reliable even though the confrontation \r\n  procedure was suggestive.Â  Biggers at 199-201.Â  The Supreme Court found \r\n  â€œno substantial likelihood of misidentification.â€Â  Id. at 201.\r\nIn State v. Ramsey, a distinctive sweater was found \r\n  near a murdered body.Â  Several witnesses testified to seeing the defendant wearing \r\n  the sweater on the day of the murder.Â  Two of the witnesses were police officers \r\n  who had seen an individual wearing the sweater outside the county courthouse \r\n  several days before the homicide.Â  The officers identified the defendant from \r\n  a photo lineup.Â  On appeal, the defendant argued the trial judge erred by refusing \r\n  to hold an in camera hearing to challenge the identification procedure.Â  \r\n  The court noted that the defendant in Ramsey cited cases â€œinvolving situations \r\n  where an in-court identification [was] the product of an unlawful confrontation \r\n  or lineup.â€Â  345 S.C. at 613, 550 S.E.2d at 297.Â  The court held those cases \r\n  were â€œimmaterial because the issue in this case is simply whether an out-of-court \r\n  photographic lineup was impermissibly suggestive, not whether the subsequent \r\n  in-court identification was tainted.â€Â  Id.Â  In the case sub judice, \r\n  the trial judge found the out-of-court photographic lineup was impermissibly \r\n  suggestive; therefore, he did not allow evidence of the pretrial identification.Â  \r\n  Ramsey is inapposite to the facts in this case.\r\nFurther, we disagree with Carlson that â€œ[i]t seems logical that the court should \r\n  not allow the admission of a photo into evidence after the court has found that \r\n  the same photo was too suggestive to be used as part of the photo lineup.â€Â  \r\n  First, Carlsonâ€™s assertion is factually erroneous because the photograph admitted \r\n  into evidence was not the same picture used in the lineup.Â  Second, the trial \r\n  judge found the photo lineup procedure suggestive because Carlsonâ€™s picture \r\n  was four or five times larger than the other photos; in other words, the procedureâ€™s \r\n  suggestiveness emanated from the discrepancy between the sizes of the picturesâ€”not \r\n  Carlsonâ€™s picture itself.Â  It does not follow that because a picture stands \r\n  out from a group it is thereby unduly suggestive in isolation.Â  We reject Carlsonâ€™s \r\n  argument that the picture should not have been entered into evidence.Â  The admission \r\n  of Stateâ€™s Exhibit 29 in no way introduced evidence of the suggestive pretrial \r\n  identification.Â  The picture is relevant because it prominently shows Carlsonâ€™s \r\n  gold teeth, a distinctive feature that was significant in DeWittâ€™s description \r\n  of his assailant.Â  \r\nFinally, we find the in-court identification was proper.Â  \r\n  Criminal defendants are constitutionally protected from identification procedures \r\n  that are so unnecessarily suggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification \r\n  as to deprive them of due process of law.Â  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 \r\n  U.S. 98 (1977); Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 301-02 (1967), overruled \r\n  on other grounds by Griffith v. Kentucky, 479 U.S. 314 (1987).Â  The \r\n  determination is to be made based on the totality of the circumstances.Â  Stovall \r\n  at 301-02; see also State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 229, 522 \r\n  S.E.2d 845, 852 (Ct. App. 1999) (â€œThe query posited is whether under the totality \r\n  of the circumstances the identification was reliable even though the confrontation \r\n  procedure may have been suggestive.â€) (internal quotation marks and citation \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nBecause the trial judge in the instant case did not allow \r\n  the out-of-court photographic lineup into evidence, the issue here is DeWittâ€™s \r\n  in-court identification of Carlson.Â  A conviction based on a suggestive pretrial \r\n  photographic lineup and a subsequent in-court identification will be set aside \r\n  only if â€œthe photographic identification procedure was so impermissibly suggestive \r\n  as to give rise to a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€Â  \r\n  Simmons v. United States, 390 U.S. 377, 384 (1968); accord State \r\n  v. Moore, 343 S.C. 282, 286, 540 S.E.2d 445, 447 (2000) (â€œAn in-court identification \r\n  of an accused is inadmissible if a suggestive out-of-court identification procedure \r\n  created a very substantial likelihood of irreparable misidentification.â€); State \r\n  v. Tisdale, 338 S.C. 607, 611, 527 S.E.2d 389, 392 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  The \r\n  in-court identification is admissible if based on information independent of \r\n  the out-of-court procedure.Â  State v. Rogers, 263 S.C. 373, 210 S.E.2d \r\n  604 (1974).Â  The State bears the burden of proving that the identification was \r\n  based on an independent source by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Id. \r\n  at 377, 210 S.E.2d at 606.Â  \r\nThe record contains ample evidence supporting the reliability \r\n  and independence of DeWittâ€™s identification of Carlson.Â  DeWitt talked to Moore \r\n  and Carlson for fifteen to twenty minutes about two weeks before the shooting \r\n  took place.Â  During that time, Carlson was standing approximately a foot away \r\n  from DeWitt, directly in front of him.Â  When the shooting occurred, DeWitt was \r\n  two to three feet from Carlson.Â  The light in the room was shining brightly.Â  \r\n  DeWitt recognized Carlson because he could see through the sheer bandana Carlson \r\n  was wearing.Â  DeWitt recalled seeing Carlsonâ€™s gold teeth, â€œthe same teeth I \r\n  seen him that same day when he came with Demond Moore to the house.â€Â  DeWitt \r\n  testified that he had a clear view of Carlson throughout the shooting.Â  \r\nWhen DeWitt awoke from the coma approximately one month later, \r\n  he was presented with the photo lineup.Â  DeWitt picked out Carlson without hesitation, \r\n  saying that he was one hundred percent certain of Carlsonâ€™s identity.Â  At trial, \r\n  DeWitt again asserted with certitude that Carlson was the attacker.Â  \r\nThus, DeWitt had an opportunity to view Carlson closely both \r\n  before and during the time the shooting occurred, with an elevated degree of \r\n  attention.Â  He demonstrated a high level of certainty as to the accuracy of \r\n  the identification, and the identification was made as soon as possible after \r\n  the incident occurred.Â  There was no likelihood of misidentification. \r\nTherefore, use of the Stateâ€™s Exhibit 29 at trial was not \r\n  improper.Â  The photograph from the lineup was never admitted into evidence, \r\n  and Carlson did not make a specific objection.Â  The identification was sufficiently \r\n  reliable to make the probability of misidentification insubstantial. \r\nIII. Replay of Testimony During Jury Deliberations\r\nCarlson next challenges the trial judgeâ€™s decision not to \r\n  require the jury to review DeWittâ€™s entire testimony.Â  We affirm. \r\nDuring deliberations, the jury requested to rehear DeWittâ€™s \r\n  testimony.Â  The trial judge granted the request.Â  The poor sound quality, however, \r\n  required the court reporter to read the solicitorâ€™s questions before replaying \r\n  the answers.Â  When dinner arrived, the trial judge recessed the reading and \r\n  stated: â€œWeâ€™ll come back and conclude this at that time after you finish, all \r\n  right?â€Â  The jury sent an oral message to the court through the bailiff that \r\n  it would consider whether to hear the remainder of the testimony after the break.Â  \r\n  The jury never requested to hear the remaining testimony.Â  \r\nAfter the verdict was returned, counsel for Moore moved for \r\n  a new trial, arguing that only a portion of the direct examination of DeWitt \r\n  had been replayed, and none of the cross-examination.Â  Counsel for Carlson joined \r\n  the motion.Â  The trial judge denied the motion, noting that the playback had \r\n  been â€œa laborious and cumbersome procedure,â€ and finding the decision not to \r\n  continue it was within the juryâ€™s discretion.Â  \r\nÂ â€œThe trial judge, in his discretion, may permit the jury \r\n  at their request to review, in the defendantâ€™s presence, testimony after the \r\n  beginning of deliberations.â€Â  State v. Plyler, 275 S.C. 291, 298, 270 \r\n  S.E.2d 126, 129 (1980).Â  The extent of the review is within the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  discretion, which is to be exercised in the light of the juryâ€™s request.Â  Id.Â  \r\n\r\nThe facts of the case sub judice are similar to those \r\n  in Plyler, where the jury requested the testimony of a key witness be \r\n  read back to them.Â  There, â€œ[t]he tape was replayed, and upon the conclusion \r\n  of the direct testimony, the foreman informed the court that the jury had heard \r\n  all they desired.Â  The tape was stopped and the jury returned to their deliberations.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 298, 270 S.E.2d at 129.Â  The defendantâ€™s motion that the jury \r\n  be required to hear the cross-examination was denied by the trial judge.Â  Our \r\n  supreme court affirmed, holding: â€œThe court is not required to submit evidence \r\n  to the jury for review beyond that specifically requested but may, in its discretion, \r\n  have the jury review other evidence relating to the same factual issue so as \r\n  not to give undue prominence to the evidence requested.â€Â  Id.\r\nSimilarly, in State v. Summer, 276 S.C. 11, 274 S.E.2d \r\n  427 (1981), overruled on other grounds by State v. McFadden, 342 \r\n  S.C. 629, 539 S.E.2d 387 (2000), the jury requested to hear both the direct \r\n  and cross-examinations of the victim and a doctor.Â  Apparently, only the direct \r\n  examinations were played.Â  When the jury returned to its deliberations, defense \r\n  counsel objected to the court â€œâ€˜not allowing the jury to listen to the cross-examination \r\n  of the prosecuting witness in the same area of testimony that the jury listened \r\n  to of the direct examination.â€™â€Â  Id. at 16, 274 S.E.2d at 430.Â  The court, \r\n  citing Plyler, emphasized â€œthe broad discretion vested in the trial judge \r\n  in dealing with requests of the jury to review evidence during their deliberations.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  The court explicated: â€œWhile the record fails to show what testimony \r\n  was reproduced for the jury, it is reasonably inferable that the jury was satisfied \r\n  with the courtâ€™s response to their requests and indicated no further need for \r\n  a review of the testimony.â€Â  Id.Â  In view of the appellantâ€™s failure \r\n  to â€œclearly show a failure of the court to comply with the request of the jury \r\n  and the inference that the jury apparently felt their request had been met,â€ \r\n  the court found â€œno abuse of discretion.â€Â  Id.Â  See also State \r\n  v. Lincoln, 213 S.C. 553, 50 S.E.2d 687 (1948), overruled on other grounds \r\n  by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  The rule \r\n  in federal courts is similar.Â  U.S. v. Holmes, 863 F.2d 4, 5 (2nd Cir. \r\n  1988). \r\nWe find no abuse of discretion in the trial judgeâ€™s actions.Â  \r\n  The law imposes no duty on the judge to require the jury to hear additional \r\n  testimony.Â  Plyler, 275 S.C. at 298, 270 S.E.2d at 129.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the preservation of this issue is questionable \r\n  since no objection was made until after the verdict was returned.Â  In order \r\n  to preserve this issue, Carlson must have made a request at trial to have the \r\n  remainder of the testimony replayed.Â  State v. Hartley, 307 S.C. 239, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 182 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  Carlson made such a request, but it was not \r\n  contemporaneous.Â  In Hartley, the jury â€œasked to hear replayed only the \r\n  solicitorâ€™s cross-examination of Hartley.â€Â  Id. at 243, 414 S.E.2d at \r\n  185.Â  This Court held that â€œ[w]e need not address Hartleyâ€™s complaint concerning \r\n  the failure of the trial judge to require the jury . . . to listen to other \r\n  portions of [Hartleyâ€™s] testimony . . . .â€Â  Id. at 244, 414 S.E.2d at \r\n  185.Â  We expounded: â€œHartley never asked the trial judge to have the â€˜other \r\n  portionsâ€™ of Hartleyâ€™s testimony . . . played back to the jury.Â  Moreover, he \r\n  never objected at trial to the playback of only Hartleyâ€™s cross-examination \r\n  by the solicitor.â€Â  Id.Â  We concluded that, even if we were to reach \r\n  the issue, â€œwe would hold the trial judge committed no abuse of discretion.â€Â  \r\n  Id. (citing Plyler, 275 S.C. at 298, 270 S.E.2d at 129).Â  See \r\n  also State v. Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 633, 591 S.E.2d 600, 605 (2004) \r\n  (holding that an objection made after several pages of testimony came too late \r\n  to preserve the issue); State v. King, 334 S.C. 504, 510, 514 S.E.2d \r\n  578, 581 (1999) (concluding that appellant waived review by failing to object \r\n  before the jury verdict); State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d \r\n  869, 873 (1994) (holding that a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve \r\n  an issue for appellate review). \r\nIV. Interaction Between Jury and Bailiff\r\nCarlson contends he should be granted a new trial because \r\n  the bailiff allegedly engaged in an improper discussion with the jury during \r\n  deliberations.Â  The record indicates that during the dinner break the jury sent \r\n  an oral message to the court through the bailiff that it would consider whether \r\n  it wished to hear the remainder of the testimony.Â  Defense counsel moved for \r\n  a new trial, and the trial judge denied the motion, explaining:\r\n\r\nAs to the hearing the entire testimony of the witness, Mr. \r\n  DeWitt, I will say this to you and you may not be aware of it, it would have \r\n  occurred off the record, but when dinner concluded last night the foreperson \r\n  of the jury informed the bailiff who was removing the trash and other cups and \r\n  things of that nature from the room that the jury was going to first consider \r\n  whether they wished to hear any further testimony, and we never heard back from \r\n  the jury again.Â  The implication to the Court, of course, being that they didnâ€™t \r\n  care to hear any more testimony.Â  That was a laborious and cumbersome procedure, \r\n  most difficult for our court reporter and one that was difficult for those listening, \r\n  and I certainly can understand why the jury would not have wanted to continue \r\n  listening to the testimony.Â  I find no error in that, sir.Â  In fact, I find \r\n  that to have been within the discretion of the jury and they exercised their \r\n  discretion and thatâ€™s appropriate. \r\n\r\nCarlson argues this to be a violation of the sanctity of \r\n  the jury system, entitling him to a new trial.Â  Carlson relies on State v. \r\n  Cameron, 311 S.C. 204, 428 S.E.2d 10 (Ct. App. 1993), wherein the court \r\n  remarked: â€œthere was the private communication of the court official to members \r\n  of the jury, an occurrence which cannot be tolerated if the sanctity of the \r\n  jury system is to be maintained.â€Â  Id. at 208, 428 S.E.2d at 12.Â  In \r\n  Cameron, the defendant was accused of entering a bank with intent to \r\n  steal.Â  The trial judge charged the jury that if it found the defendant guilty \r\n  it would have to decide whether or not to recommend mercy.Â  If the jury decided \r\n  not to recommend mercy, the defendant would be given a life sentence.Â  The jury \r\n  returned a verdict of guilty without a recommendation of mercy.Â  However, after \r\n  the verdict, the trial judge discovered that the bailiff had a discussion with \r\n  the forelady of the jury during deliberations.Â  When the forelady informed the \r\n  bailiff that the jury â€œwanted a description about if they went with the sentence \r\n  of mercy that he wouldnâ€™t make it life,â€ the bailiff responded, â€œ . . . donâ€™t \r\n  worry about it the Judge is fair.â€Â  Id. at 206-07, 428 S.E.2d at 11.\r\nThe trial judge refused to declare a mistrial, but a divided \r\n  court of appeals reversed.Â  We held that when a court official engaged in private \r\n  communication with the jury, â€œâ€˜a new trial must be granted unless it clearly \r\n  appears that the subject matter of the communication was harmless and could \r\n  not have affected the verdict.â€™â€Â  Id. at 207-08, 428 S.E.2d at 12 (quoting \r\n  Holmes v. United States, 284 F.2d 716, 718 (4th Cir. 1960)).Â  Yet, we \r\n  observed, â€œThe mere fact . . . that some conversation occurred between a juror \r\n  and the court official would not necessarily prejudice a defendant.â€Â  Cameron \r\n  at 207-08, 428 S.E.2d at 12. \r\nIn this case, there was no communication by the bailiff to \r\n  the jury.Â  The bailiff simply relayed the message without responding.Â  Nor was \r\n  there any indication of improper outside influences.Â  Cameron deals only \r\n  with â€œprivate communications of the court official to members of the juryâ€ and \r\n  is thus inapplicable.Â  Id.Â  \r\nOur supreme court has outlined the proper procedure for this \r\n  situation:Â  \r\n\r\nIf, during deliberation, the jury finds need to review portions \r\n  of the testimony or to consult the court regarding questions of law, the foreman \r\n  should inform the bailiff that the jury wishes to consult with the judge.Â  The \r\n  subject matter of the juryâ€™s inquiry should not be discussed at all.Â  The bailiffâ€™s \r\n  single responsibility is to advise the court of the foremanâ€™s request.Â  The \r\n  matter is then completely in the hands of the trial judge. \r\n\r\nJacobs v. Am. Mut. Fire Ins. Co. of Charleston, 287 \r\n  S.C. 541, 543, 340 S.E.2d 142, 143 (1986). \r\nWe find no error here.Â  The bailiff did exactly what he should \r\n  have doneâ€”he advised the trial judge of the juryâ€™s communication without commenting \r\n  on the subject matter of the case.Â  Furthermore, defense counsel made no objection \r\n  on this ground at trial.Â  Nor was any request made to have the bailiff or jurors \r\n  examined to determine if any prejudicial exchange occurred. \r\nV. Closing Remarks\r\nCarlsonâ€™s next ground for appeal deals with the following \r\n  remarks made by the prosecutor during closing arguments:\r\n\r\nNow, the Defense made a big deal about, you know, â€œDonâ€™t \r\n  get carried away with the brutality of it.Â  Weâ€™re not saying itâ€™s not brutal.Â  \r\n  Weâ€™re so sorry this happened,â€ which Iâ€™ll submit to you I didnâ€™tâ€”these Defendants \r\n  have the right not to testify, and they can, you know, we have the burden of \r\n  proof and theyâ€™ve got a constitutional right not to testify but they canâ€™t come \r\n  in and apologize.\r\n\r\nCounsel for Moore immediately objected.Â  The trial judge \r\n  sustained the objection and gave a curative instruction: â€œThereâ€™s no inference \r\n  to be taken.Â  The Defendants have a right to remain silent and have a right \r\n  not to testify.â€Â  The judge charged the jury that defendants have a constitutional \r\n  right not to testify, and that their failure to testify could not be used against \r\n  them, even to the slightest degree.Â  Defense counsel did not make any further \r\n  motions. \r\nOnce again, this issue has not been preserved for review.Â  \r\n  â€œFailure to object to comments made during argument precludes appellate review \r\n  of the issue.â€Â  State v. Varvil, 338 S.C. 335, 339, 526 S.E.2d 248, 251 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In the instant case, counsel for Moore objected, but Carlson \r\n  did not.Â  In State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 238 S.E.2d 678 (1977), \r\n  the court held appellantâ€™s assertion of error was not preserved because â€œappellantâ€™s \r\n  counsel made no objection . . . at trial.Â  While appellantâ€™s co-defendant did \r\n  object, the appellant may not utilize the objection of another defendant to \r\n  gain review.â€Â  Id. at 555, 238 S.E.2d at 678; see also State \r\n  v. Brannon, 347 S.C. 85, 89, 552 S.E.2d 773, 775 (Ct. App. 2001) (finding \r\n  failure to suppress evidence not preserved where appellant did not join in co-defendantâ€™s \r\n  motion to suppress); State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 123, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  118, 124 (1997) (â€œFinally, the remaining issues raised by appellant are not \r\n  preserved for review since appellant failed to object during trial or join in \r\n  his co-defendantâ€™s objections.â€).Â  Because Carlson did not raise an objection \r\n  to the solicitorâ€™s comments and did not join in his co-defendantâ€™s objection, \r\n  this issue is not preserved.\r\nAdditionally, neither party moved to strike or requested \r\n  a curative instruction.Â  See State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 18, \r\n  482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997) (holding that where an appellant objects to improper \r\n  comments in closing arguments and the objection is sustained, the issue is not \r\n  preserved unless the appellant further moves to strike or requests a curative \r\n  instruction); State v. Primus, 341 S.C. 592, 604, 535 S.E.2d 152, 158 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000), (providing a thorough discussion and concluding â€œthe cases \r\n  are legion in holding that if an appellant objects and the objection is sustained \r\n  but he does not move for a curative instruction or request a mistrial he has \r\n  received what he asked for and cannot be heard to complain on appeal.â€), revâ€™d \r\n  in part on other grounds, 349 S.C. 576, 564 S.E.2d 103 (2002); State \r\n  v. McFadden, 318 S.C. 404, 410, 458 S.E.2d 61, 65 (Ct. App. 1995) (noting \r\n  that appellant must move to strike to preserve issue for appeal). \r\nEven if the issue were properly preserved, there would be \r\n  no reversible error.Â  Improper closing argument does not automatically require \r\n  reversal of a conviction.Â  State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d \r\n  114 (1997); State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996).Â  \r\n  â€œIt is impermissible for the prosecution to comment, directly or indirectly, \r\n  upon the defendantâ€™s failure to testify at trial.â€Â  State v. Cooper, \r\n  334 S.C. 540, 544, 514 S.E.2d 584, 591 (1999).Â  â€œHowever, improper comments \r\n  on a defendantâ€™s failure to testify do not automatically require reversal if \r\n  they are not prejudicial to the defendant.â€Â  Id.Â  The appropriateness \r\n  of a solicitorâ€™s closing argument and the decision whether to grant a defendantâ€™s \r\n  motion for a mistrial are matters within the trial judgeâ€™s discretion that ordinarily \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal.Â  State v. Sweet, 342 S.C. 342, 347, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 91, 93 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  \r\nNegative inferences created by prosecutors can be cured if \r\n  the trial judge gives an immediate curative instruction to the jury.Â  Cooper, \r\n  334 S.C. at 554, 514 S.E.2d at 591.Â  If the trial judge charges the jury during \r\n  jury instructions that the burden of proof is fully on the State, and that the \r\n  jury may not consider a defendantâ€™s failure to testify in its deliberations, \r\n  any prejudicial effect can be cured.Â  Id.Â  The appellant has the burden \r\n  of proving he did not receive a fair trial because of the improper argument.Â  \r\n  State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981).Â  Because the trial \r\n  judge gave an immediate curative instruction upon objection of defense counsel, \r\n  and charged the jury that failure to testify could not be used against either \r\n  defendant, any prejudicial effect was cured.Â  \r\nVI. Brady Claim\r\nCarlson contends the prosecution violated his rights under \r\n  Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), by failing to provide a forty-page \r\n  transcript to defense counsel prior to trial.Â  During cross-examination of Carlsonâ€™s \r\n  alibi witness, Heather Wilson, the prosecution used a transcribed conversation \r\n  between Wilson and an investigator to impeach her.Â  Counsel for Moore objected \r\n  on the ground that he had not been provided a copy.Â  The trial judge required \r\n  the State to provide the transcript to the defense.Â  Counsel for Moore further \r\n  objected that he had not had time to review the document.Â  The trial judge allowed \r\n  cross-examination to continue, but announced that he would permit defense counsel \r\n  to recall the witness after a recess.Â  Moore and Carlson both opted to reserve \r\n  the right to recall Wilson for redirect; however, neither defendant recalled \r\n  her.Â  \r\nWilson averred Carlson was in bed with her on the morning \r\n  DeWitt was attacked.Â  She claimed that Carlson had gotten up that morning to \r\n  get her son to school on time, and, therefore, could not have been at the site \r\n  of the shooting.Â  The State then called the principal of the school Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  son attended.Â  The principal testified that Wilsonâ€™s son had been tardy the \r\n  morning of the attack and had not checked into the office when he arrived.Â  \r\n\r\nCarlsonâ€™s argument is not preserved.Â  We reiterate, Carlson \r\n  cannot use an objection by his co-defendant to preserve an issue for appellate \r\n  review.Â  State v. Carriker, 269 S.C. 553, 555, 238 S.E.2d 678, 678 (1977).Â  \r\n  Additionally, Carlson did not enter a copy of the statement into the record, \r\n  so review is not possible.Â  In State v. Mitchell, 330 S.C. 189, 498 S.E.2d \r\n  642, (1998), the appellant argued the trial judge improperly refused to consider \r\n  a written statement, allegedly made by one of the Stateâ€™s eyewitnesses, which \r\n  was discovered after the jury began deliberating.Â  The court noted that â€œthe \r\n  statement is not in the record on appeal and therefore this Court does not know \r\n  exactly what information it contained.â€Â  Id. at 199, 498 S.E.2d at 647; \r\n  see also State v. Hutto, 279 S.C. 131, 303 S.E.2d 90 (1983) (affirming \r\n  dismissal of indictment for insufficiency of evidence where the State failed \r\n  to meet its burden of presenting a record which was sufficiently complete to \r\n  permit review by the appellate entity).Â  The burden is on the appellant to provide \r\n  a sufficient record for review.Â  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 464 \r\n  n.4, 469 S.E.2d 49, 55 n.4 (1996); State v. Tyndall, 336 S.C. 8, 17, \r\n  518 S.E.2d 278, 283 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\nMoreover, Carlson has not established a Brady violation.Â  \r\n  Suppression by the prosecution of evidence favorable to an accused upon request \r\n  violates due process where the evidence is material either to guilt or to punishment, \r\n  irrespective of the good faith or bad faith of the prosecution.Â  State v. \r\n  Taylor, 333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (1998) (citing Brady v. Maryland, \r\n  373 U.S. 83 (1963)); Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, \r\n  324 (1999).Â  Brady only requires disclosure of evidence that is both \r\n  favorable to the accused and material to guilt or punishment.Â  Taylor, \r\n  333 S.C. 159, 508 S.E.2d 870 (citing United States v. Bagley, 473 U.S. \r\n  667 (1985)).\r\nA Brady claim is based on the requirement of due process. \r\n  Â To establish a due process violation, an accused must demonstrate that the \r\n  evidence was (1) favorable to the accused; (2) in the possession of or known \r\n  to the prosecution; (3) suppressed by the prosecution; and (4) material to guilt \r\n  or punishment.Â  Gibson at 524, 514 S.E.2d at 324 (citing Kyles v. \r\n  Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 432-42 (1995); Brady, 373 U.S. at 87; State \r\n  v. Von Dohlen, 322 S.C. 234, 241, 471 S.E.2d 689, 693 (1996)); State \r\n  v. Jarrell, 350 S.C. 90, 107, 564 S.E.2d 362, 372 (Ct. App. 2002), cert. \r\n  denied.Â  The rule applies to impeachment evidence as well as exculpatory \r\n  evidence.Â  Gibson at 524, 514 S.E.2d at 324 (citing Bagley, 473 \r\n  U.S. at 676).\r\nThere are three categories of Brady violations: (1) \r\n  cases involving nondisclosed evidence or perjured testimony about which the \r\n  prosecutor knew or should have known; (2) cases in which the defendant specifically \r\n  requested the nondisclosed evidence; and (3) cases in which the defendant made \r\n  no request or only a general request for Brady material.Â  Gibson \r\n  at 524-25, 514 S.E.2d at 325 (citing United States v. Agurs, 427 U.S. \r\n  97 (1976)).Â  \r\nPrior to trial, defense counsel moved to compel copies of \r\n  any Brady material and any statements made during the investigation of \r\n  the case.Â  In â€œspecific-requestâ€ or â€œgeneral- or no-requestâ€ situations such \r\n  as this one, favorable evidence is considered material for Brady purposes.Â  \r\n  Gibson at 525, 514 S.E.2d at 325.Â  Reversible error occurs when the prosecution \r\n  suppresses material that had a reasonable probability of achieving a different \r\n  result in the proceeding if it had been disclosed to the defense, thereby undermining \r\n  confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  Id.Â  Exculpatory evidence is \r\n  that which creates a reasonable doubt about the defendantâ€™s guilt.Â  State \r\n  v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641 (1996); Jarrell at 107, 564 \r\n  S.E.2d at 372.Â  The court must make the materiality determination on a case-by-case \r\n  basis.Â  Gibson at 525, 514 S.E.2d at 325.\r\nWe cannot say that nondisclosure of the transcript of Wilsonâ€™s \r\n  prior inconsistent statement to the defense undermined confidence in the outcome \r\n  of the trial.Â  Courts have held that when defense counsel is given the opportunity \r\n  to review and use the inconsistent statement in cross-examination, as was done \r\n  here, there is no reasonable probability the outcome of the trial would have \r\n  been different.Â  See, e.g., Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 660, \r\n  594 S.E.2d 462, 470 (2004).Â  Here, Carlson was given a copy of the statement, \r\n  and he was afforded the opportunity to recall Wilson, which he did not do.Â  \r\n  Additionally, Wilsonâ€™s impeachment did not turn on the transcript, but on the \r\n  school principalâ€™s testimony that Wilsonâ€™s son had been tardy on the morning \r\n  of the shooting.Â  Thus, the suppression did not undermine confidence in the \r\n  outcome of the trial.Â  \r\nVII. Request for New Trial\r\nCarlson argues the trial judge erred in allowing the prosecution \r\n  to continue cross-examining Wilson using the forty-page transcript of her prior \r\n  statement after defense counsel objected.Â  He contends a new trial is warranted.Â  \r\n  We disagree. \r\nCounsel for Carlson did not make a contemporaneous objection \r\n  or provide a copy of the statement in the record for appellate review.Â  Carlson \r\n  has failed to establish a Brady violation and thus cannot show entitlement \r\n  to a new trial.Â  Finally, Carlson did not request a new trial on the basis of \r\n  Brady.Â  Issues not raised and ruled upon by the trial court are not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 691 \r\n  (2003).Â  \r\nVIII. Use of Prior Criminal Record\r\nCarlsonâ€™s final argument on appeal is that the trial court \r\n  erred in informing him that any criminal conviction would be admissible against \r\n  him if he took the witness stand.Â  This argument fails for several reasons. \r\n\r\nCarlson did not testify.Â  The issue, therefore, is not preserved \r\n  for our review.Â  In State v. Glenn, 285 S.C. 384, 330 S.E.2d 285 (1985), \r\n  the South Carolina Supreme Court observed:\r\n\r\nIn Luce v. United States, 469 U.S. 38, 105 S.Ct. 460, \r\n  83 L.E.2d 443 (1994), the United States Supreme Court recently refused to review \r\n  a claim, under Federal Rule of Evidence 609(a), of improper impeachment with \r\n  a prior conviction.Â  The Court reasoned that when the defendant does not testify, \r\n  appellate review is too speculative for several reasons.Â  Those reasons include: \r\n  the freedom of the trial judge to later alter his ruling; the possibility the \r\n  prosecution may not have sought to impeach the defendant with the prior convictions; \r\n  the likelihood that an adverse ruling might not have been the real motivation \r\n  for the defendantâ€™s decision not to testify; and the inability of the appellate \r\n  court to review any error for harmlessness.\r\n\r\nGlenn at 385, 330 S.E.2d at 285-86.Â  The Glenn \r\n  court adopted Luce, holding: â€œwhen the trial judge chooses to make a \r\n  preliminary ruling on the admissibility of prior convictions to impeach a defendant \r\n  and the defendant does not testify at trial, the claim of improper impeachment \r\n  is not preserved for review.â€Â  Id. at 385, 330 S.E.2d at 286; see \r\n  also State v. Ford, 334 S.C. 444, 454, 513 S.E.2d 385, 390 (Ct. App. \r\n  1999).Â  \r\nFurther, the trial judge never ruled on the admissibility \r\n  of Carlsonâ€™s prior convictions.Â  Carlson made a motion in limine to exclude \r\n  any mention of Carlsonâ€™s prior criminal record, which the trial judge took under \r\n  advisement.Â  After the State rested its case, the trial judge informed both \r\n  defendants of their right to testify and stated: â€œif you do testify, if you \r\n  have some prior record, then that will come into evidence on the basis of your \r\n  believability and credibility, not on the basis of your guilt or innocence with \r\n  regard to these charges . . . .â€Â  Immediately after the address, the trial judge \r\n  asked them whether they had any questions about their right to remain silent \r\n  or their right to testify. \r\nCarlson contends that the judgeâ€™s statement constituted \r\n  a ruling on the prior motion in limine.Â  However, we find the trial judge \r\n  was only generally advising the defendants of the possibility they would be \r\n  impeached.Â  Immediately prior to the colloquy, Carlsonâ€™s counsel requested that \r\n  the judge â€œallow him to defer his decision [whether to testify] until after \r\n  we present the rest of our case.â€Â  The judge consented.Â  After Carlsonâ€™s witness \r\n  testified, counsel for Carlson asked the court for a moment to discuss with \r\n  Carlson whether to call another witness or testify.Â  He chose to rest.Â  Carlson \r\n  never sought clarification on the ruling as to which charges would be admissible.Â  \r\n  We are not persuaded a final ruling was made.\r\nCarlson did not testify.Â  Therefore, pursuant to \r\n  Glenn, the issue is not preserved for our review.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that Carlson consented to the procedure used for determining \r\n  the admissibility of the photo lineup.Â  The in-court identification was proper \r\n  because the suggestive photograph was not used, no specific contemporaneous \r\n  objection was raised, and there were sufficient indicia of reliability to indicate \r\n  the in-court identification had an independent basis.Â  We find no abuse of discretion \r\n  in the judgeâ€™s decision not to order the jury to review the entire testimony \r\n  of DeWitt.Â  Additionally, the bailiffâ€™s action in relaying the message from \r\n  the jury to the judge was not improper.Â  Carlsonâ€™s Brady claim is not \r\n  preserved.Â  Carlson failed to demonstrate a Brady violation.Â  Finally, \r\n  we hold the trial judgeâ€™s address to the defendants was not a ruling on the \r\n  admissibility of Carlsonâ€™s prior criminal record, and, even if it were, the \r\n  issue is not preserved.Â  Accordingly, Carlsonâ€™s convictions are hereby \r\n AFFIRMED. \r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  We note that Carlsonâ€™s appellate counsel was not his trial \r\n    counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3949","title":"Liberty Mutual Insurance  v.

Derham Cole, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 3949\r\nHeard February 9, 2005 â€“ Filed February \r\n  22, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nPope D. Johnson, III, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nRobert M. Cook, II, of Batesberg-Leeseville, and Terry Michael Mauldin, of \r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.:Â  Timothy Paul Williams (Claimant) lost his right leg in a work-related \r\n  accident.Â  Liberty Mutual Insurance Company (Liberty) sought reimbursement for \r\n  compensation benefit payments from the South Carolina Second Injury Fund (the \r\n  Fund) based on Claimantâ€™s preexisting impairment.Â  The circuit court ruled that \r\n  Liberty was not entitled to reimbursement of the controverted payments.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nClaimant sustained \r\n  a compensable injury when a steel I-beam fell on his legs.Â  His right leg was \r\n  essentially amputated above the knee in the accident, and his left leg was crushed.Â  \r\n  Claimant was awarded 100% permanent partial disability to his right leg and \r\n  45% permanent partial disability to his left leg.Â  The orders of the single \r\n  commissioner, the appellate panel, and the circuit court all found that Claimantâ€™s \r\n  100% disability to the right leg was caused by the industrial accident alone, \r\n  and his diabetes, a preexisting impairment, played no role in the loss of that \r\n  leg.Â  \r\nLiberty seeks reimbursement \r\n  from the Fund pursuant to section 42-9-400 of the South Carolina Code (1985), \r\n  because of Claimantâ€™s preexisting diabetes.Â  The Fund reimbursed Libertyâ€™s claim \r\n  regarding all medical payments and disability compensation, with the exception \r\n  of the 100% permanent disability paid for the right leg.Â  The Fund argues the \r\n  claim does not qualify for reimbursement because the total loss of the right \r\n  leg was solely attributable to the industrial accident.Â  The hearing commissioner \r\n  ruled in the Fundâ€™s favor.Â  The appellate panel reversed.Â  However, the appellate \r\n  panelâ€™s decision was reversed by the circuit court.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe South Carolina Administrative Procedures Act (APA) establishes the standard \r\n  for judicial review of decisions of the workers' compensation commission.Â  Hargrove \r\n  v. Titan Textile Co., 360 S.C. 276, 599 S.E.2d 604 (Ct. App. 2004); see \r\n  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981); \r\n  Gibson v. Spartanburg Sch. Dist. No. 3, 338 S.C. 510, 526 S.E.2d \r\n  725 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  A reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of \r\n  an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency \r\n  are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence \r\n  on the whole record.â€Â  Bursey v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl. \r\n  Control, 360 S.C. 135, 141, 600 S.E.2d 80, 84 (Ct. App. 2004); S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (Supp. 2003).Â  Under the scope of review established \r\n  in the APA, this Court may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission \r\n  as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may reverse where \r\n  the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Stone v. Traylor Bros., Inc., \r\n  360 S.C. 271, 600 S.E.2d 551 (Ct. App. 2004); Frame v. Resort Servs., Inc., \r\n  357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491 (Ct. App. 2004); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., \r\n  324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) \r\n  (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nThe substantial evidence rule of the APA governs the standard of review in \r\n  a workersâ€™ compensation decision. Frame, 357 S.C. 520, 593 S.E.2d 491; \r\n  Corbin v. Kohler Co., 351 S.C. 613, 571 S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\n  This Courtâ€™s review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision \r\n  is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  \r\n  See Grant v. Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 603 S.E.2d 858 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2004); Gibson, 338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 728-29; \r\n  see also Dukes v. Rural Metro Corp, 356 S.C. 107, 109, 587 S.E.2d \r\n  687, 688 (2003) (â€œThis Court will not overturn a decision by the Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Commission unless the determination is unsupported by substantial evidence.â€); \r\n  Lyles v. Quantum Chem. Co. (Emery), 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d \r\n  292 (Ct. App. 1993) (noting that in reviewing decision of workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  commission, court of appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are \r\n  not supported by substantial evidence or they are controlled by error of law).\r\nSubstantial evidence is not a mere scintilla of evidence, nor the evidence \r\n  viewed blindly from one side of the case, but is evidence which, considering \r\n  the record as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion \r\n  the administrative agency reached in order to justify its action.Â  Pratt \r\n  v. Morris Roofing, Inc., 357 S.C. 619, 594 S.E.2d 272 (2004); Jones v. \r\n  Georgia-Pacific Corp., 355 S.C. 413, 586 S.E.2d 111 (2003); Etheredge \r\n  v.

App. 1999).Â  \r\n  The appellate panel is the ultimate fact finder in workersâ€™ compensation cases \r\n  and is not bound by the single commissionerâ€™s findings of fact.Â  Gibson, \r\n  338 S.C. at 517, 526 S.E.2d at 729; Muir v. C.R. Bard, Inc., 336 \r\n  S.C. 266, 519 S.E.2d 583 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  â€œThe final determination of witness \r\n  credibility and the weight to be accorded evidence is reserved to the Appellate \r\n  Panel.â€Â  Frame, 357 S.C. at 528, 593 S.E.2d at 495 (citing Shealy \r\n  v. Aiken County, 341 S.C. 448, 535 S.E.2d 438 (2000)); Parsons \r\n  v.

Case Produce, Inc., 336 S.C. 154, 519 S.E.2d \r\n  102 (1999); Durant v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, \r\n  361 S.C. 416, 604 S.E.2d 704 (Ct. App. 2004); Corbin v.

Baptist Med. \r\n  Ctr., 343 S.C. 487, 541 S.E.2d 526 (2001); Hicks v. Piedmont Cold \r\n  Storage, Inc., 335 S.C. 46, 515 S.E.2d 532 (1999); Frame at \r\n  528, 593 S.E.2d at 495.Â  It is not within our province to reverse findings of \r\n  the appellate panel which are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Pratt, \r\n  357 S.C. at 274-75, 594 S.E.2d at 622; Broughton, 336 S.C. at \r\n  496, 520 S.E.2d at 637.Â  The appellate court is prohibited from overturning \r\n  findings of fact of the appellate panel, unless there is no reasonable probability \r\n  the facts could be as related by the witness upon whose testimony the finding \r\n  was based.Â  Hargrove at 290, 599 S.E.2d at 611; Etheredge, \r\n  349 S.C. at 455-56, 562 S.E.2d at 681.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Principles of Statutory Construction\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain the intent of \r\n  the legislature.Â  State v. Scott, 351 S.C. 584, 588, 571 S.E.2d \r\n  700, 702 (2002); Georgia-Carolina Bail Bonds, Inc. v. County of Aiken, \r\n  354 S.C. 18, 579 S.E.2d 334 (Ct. App. 2003); see also Gordon v. Phillips \r\n  Utils. Inc., Op. No. 25930 (S.C. filed January 24, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. \r\n  Sh. No. 4 at 44) (â€œThe primary purpose in construing a statute is to ascertain \r\n  legislative intent.â€); Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., \r\n  344 S.C. 194, 205, 544 S.E.2d 38, 44 (Ct. App. 2001) (â€œThe quintessence of statutory \r\n  construction is legislative intent.â€).Â  A statute should be given a reasonable \r\n  and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy expressed \r\n  in the statute.Â  Davis v. NationsCredit Fin. Servs. Corp., 326 S.C. 83, \r\n  484 S.E.2d 471 (1997); Daisy Outdoor Adver. Co. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of \r\n  Transp., 352 S.C. 113, 120, 572 S.E.2d 462, 466 (Ct.

Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one \r\n  that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the \r\n  language used, and that language must be construed in the light of the intended \r\n  purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. \r\n  433, 567 S.E.2d 240 (2002); Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville \r\n  County, 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998); State v.

App. 1999).Â  The determination of legislative \r\n  intent is a matter of law.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n \r\n  v.

App. \r\n  2004); Olson, 344 S.C. at 207, 544 S.E.2d at 45.\r\nThe legislatureâ€™s intent should be ascertained primarily from the plain language \r\n  of the statute.Â  State v.

Ins. Co. v. Mumford, 299 S.C. 14, 19, 382 S.E.2d 11, 14 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989).\r\nWhen faced with an undefined statutory term, the court must interpret the term \r\n  in accord with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch v.

App. 2004).\r\nII.Â  Interpretation of Section 42-9-400\r\nThe instant case requires this Court to determine the scope and reach of section \r\n  42-9-400 of the South Carolina Code (1985).Â  Specifically, the issue is whether \r\n  the statute permits Liberty to recover compensation payments from the Fund when \r\n  the injury for which reimbursement is sought was not affected by the preexisting \r\n  impairment. \r\nSection 42-7-310 of the South Carolina Code (1985) establishes the Second Injury \r\n  Fund.Â  The purpose of the Fund is to â€œencourage the employment of disabled or \r\n  handicapped persons without penalizing an employer with greater liability if \r\n  the employee is injured because of his preexisting condition.â€Â  South Carolina \r\n  Second Injury Fund v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 353 S.C. 117, 122, 576 S.E.2d \r\n  199, 202&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2003) (quoting Liberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina \r\n  Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, 458 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1995)).Â  The \r\n  Fund accomplishes this goal by absorbing some of the risk that such a worker \r\n  will become injured in the workplace.Â  Its creation allows the employer, or \r\n  his insurance carrier, to seek compensation from the Fund when an employee with \r\n  a prior permanent physical impairment incurs a subsequent disability in the \r\n  workplace.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-400 (a) (1985).\r\nSection 42-9-400 (a) provides:Â  \r\n\r\nIf an employee who has a permanent physical impairment \r\n  from any cause or origin incurs a subsequent disability from injury by accident \r\n  arising out of and in the course of his employment, resulting in compensation \r\n  and medical payments liability or either, for disability that is substantially \r\n  greater, by reason of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and \r\n  subsequent injury or by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment, \r\n  than that which would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone, the employer \r\n  or his insurance carrier shall in the first instance pay all awards of compensation \r\n  and medical benefits provided by this Title; but such employer or his insurance \r\n  carrier shall be reimbursed from the Second Injury Fund as created by Â§ 42-7-310 \r\n  for compensation and medical benefits in the following manner: \r\n(1) \r\n  Reimbursement of all compensation benefit payments payable subsequent to those \r\n  payable for the first seventy-eight weeks following the injury.\r\n(2) Reimbursement of fifty percent of medical payments \r\n  in excess of three thousand dollars during the first seventy-eight weeks following \r\n  the injury and then reimbursement of all medical benefit payments payable subsequent \r\n  to the first seventy-eight weeks following the injury; provided, however, \r\n  in order to obtain reimbursement for medical expense during the first seventy-eight \r\n  weeks following the subsequent injury, an employer or carrier must establish \r\n  that his liability for medical payments is substantially greater, by reason \r\n  of the combined effects of the preexisting impairment and subsequent injury \r\n  or by reason of the aggravation of the preexisting impairment, than that which \r\n  would have resulted from the subsequent injury alone.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. (1985).\r\nLiberty argues the appellate panel correctly determined \r\n  this section clearly and unambiguously sets forth the requirements, which, when \r\n  met, trigger the right of reimbursement.Â  Specifically, Liberty claims that \r\n  a plain reading of section 9-42-400(a)(1) gives it the right to reimbursement \r\n  for all compensation benefit payments without regard to whether a nexus \r\n  exists between the payments and the preexisting impairment.Â  However, an examination \r\n  of the law and its application to these facts reveals that the circuit court \r\n  properly rejected this reading of the statute.\r\nThis is an issue of first impression in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  After carefully considering the facts of this case; the nature of the injury; \r\n  the existing case law, which allows reimbursement to be limited to either compensation \r\n  or medical liability when factually supported; and the purpose of the Fund, \r\n  this Court concludes as a matter of law Liberty can only be reimbursed for the \r\n  liability proximately owed to the prior disability.\r\nClaimant, who suffered from diabetes, was working when \r\n  the steel I-beam fell and crushed his legs.Â  At the time the I-beam fell onto \r\n  his right leg, it essentially traumatically amputated the right leg above the \r\n  knee.Â  In addition, the I-beam crushed and fractured his left leg.Â  The preexisting \r\n  diabetes acted to exacerbate the condition of his left leg and contributed to \r\n  increased medical expenses, but the diabetes had no impact on the amputation \r\n  of his right leg or the disability rating given to Claimant because of the loss \r\n  of his right leg.Â  Therefore, the preexisting diabetes had no impact on the \r\n  portion of the award paid for the injury to the right leg.\r\nIn Liberty Mutual Insurance Company v. South Carolina \r\n  Second Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, 458 S.E.2d 550, 551-52 (1995), the \r\n  supreme court ruled a carrier was entitled to reimbursement for medical costs \r\n  but not disability payments.Â  The court noted that while diabetes exacerbated \r\n  the workplace injury and ultimately required a double amputation, the workplace \r\n  accident alone was enough to cause the claimant to become permanently and totally \r\n  disabled.Â  Id. at 517, 458 S.E.2d at 551.Â  Importantly, the court recognized \r\n  the accident was sufficient to trigger permanent and total disability payments.Â  \r\n  The court approved the circuit courtâ€™s interpretation of section 42-9-400(a) \r\n  that â€œif a carrier incurs greater liability for compensation and/or medical \r\n  payments, he is entitled to reimbursement of those.â€Â  Id. at 519, 458 \r\n  S.E.2d at 551.Â  Liberty had incurred greater medical payments because of the \r\n  claimantâ€™s diabetes; however, Liberty â€œdid not incur greater compensation payments \r\n  as the accident rendered [the claimant] totally disabled and [the claimant]â€™s \r\n  diabetes did not increase these payments.â€Â  Id. at 519, 458 S.E.2d at \r\n  551-52.Â  Thus, the insurer could not recover reimbursement for the compensation \r\n  payments, but the court allowed reimbursement for the medical expenses which \r\n  were attributable to the diabetes.\r\nLiberty Mutual stands for the proposition that \r\n  medical and compensation reimbursement do not necessarily follow from each other, \r\n  but are, instead, fact dependant.Â  Following the logic of Liberty Mutual, \r\n  it is appropriate to consider the injuries to the right and left legs separately.Â  \r\n  The diabetes did not exacerbate the injury to the right leg and did not add \r\n  to the medical expenses.Â  The statutory scheme of scheduling the loss of each \r\n  individual member buttresses our conclusion.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-9-30 (15) (1985) (providing the amount of compensation and the period of \r\n  disability for the loss of a leg).\r\nWe are compelled toward this result by the rules of \r\n  statutory interpretation discussed in Liberty Mutual.Â  There, the court \r\n  stated the â€œprimary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent \r\n  of the legislatureâ€ and â€œ[t]he real purpose of the legislature will prevail \r\n  over the literal import of the words.â€Â  Liberty Mutual, 318 S.C. at 519, \r\n  458 S.E.2d at 551 (citations omitted).Â  The court explained the intent and purpose \r\n  of the Fund â€œis to encourage the employment of disabled or handicapped persons \r\n  without penalizing an employer with greater liability if the employee is injured \r\n  because of his preexisiting condition.â€Â  Id.Â  The interpretation of section \r\n  42-9-400 proffered by Liberty in the case sub judice does not advance \r\n  the purpose of the Fund as explicated by the Liberty Mutual court.Â  Instead, \r\n  Libertyâ€™s reading of the statute would provide the insurer with a windfall unrelated \r\n  to Claimantâ€™s preexisting condition.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  interpretation of section 42-9-400, providing for reimbursement for the left \r\n  leg, but not the right, is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nBEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3950","title":"State v.

[1] \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1996 the family court issued a written order \r\n  requiring Appellant and her husband to ensure that their eight-year-old daughter \r\n  â€œregularly attend school and see to it that the minor(s) does/do so attend school \r\n  for the remainder of this school year and future school years, under penalty \r\n  of law.â€Â  In February of 2002, when their daughter was fourteen years old, Appellant \r\n  and her husband were summoned to a rule to show cause hearing to answer allegations \r\n  of educational neglect in connection with their daughter.Â  The family court \r\n  continued the hearing so that the Passmores could obtain counsel.Â  The proceeding \r\n  resumed in April of 2002, and the family court judge found Appellant and her \r\n  husband in willful contempt of the 1996 order.Â  The judge sentenced both of \r\n  them to one year in prison, and she took emergency protective custody of the \r\n  Passmoresâ€™ minor daughter.Â  Appellant contends the sentence violated her federal \r\n  constitutional right to a trial by jury in serious criminal cases.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  The Constitutional Limitation on the Contempt Power \r\nâ€œThe power to punish for contempt is inherent in all courts.Â  Its existence \r\n  is essential to the preservation of order in judicial proceedings, and to the \r\n  enforcement of the judgments, orders and writs of the courts, and consequently \r\n  to the due administration of justice.â€Â  Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, \r\n  382, 287 S.E.2d 915, 917 (1982) (citing McLeod v. Hite, 272 S.C. 303, \r\n  251 S.E.2d 746 (1979); State v. Goff, 228 S.C. 17, 88 S.E.2d 788 (1955)).Â  \r\n  The determination of contempt ordinarily resides in the sound discretion of \r\n  the trial judge.Â  State v. Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. 122, 129, 447 S.E.2d \r\n  213, 217 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nContempt results from the willful disobedience of an order of the court, and \r\n  before a court may hold a person in contempt, the record must clearly and specifically \r\n  demonstrate the acts or conduct upon which such finding is based.Â  Curlee \r\n  at 382, 287 S.E.2d at 918; accord Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. v. Cloyd, \r\n  350 S.C. 596, 606, 567 S.E.2d 514, 519 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  A willful act is â€œone \r\n  done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific intent to do something \r\n  the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law \r\n  requires to be done; that is to say with bad purpose either to disobey or disregard \r\n  the law.â€ Bevilacqua, 316 S.C. at 129, 447 S.E.2d at 217 (internal quotation \r\n  marks and citation omitted).Â  Intent for purposes of criminal contempt is subjective, \r\n  not objective, and must necessarily be ascertained from all the acts, words, \r\n  and circumstances surrounding the occurrence.Â  Id. (citing State v. \r\n  Bowers, 270 S.C. 124, 241 S.E.2d 409 (1978)).\r\nAlthough the contempt power is inherent and essential \r\n  to the preservation of orderly proceedings, it is not unbounded; the power of \r\n  contempt is checked by the sacrosanct right to be tried by a jury of oneâ€™s peers.Â  \r\n  Article III, Section 2, of the United States Constitution provides: â€œThe trial \r\n  of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury . . . .â€Â  The \r\n  right to a jury trial is amplified by the Sixth Amendment, which reads, in part: \r\n  â€œIn all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy \r\n  and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the \r\n  crime shall have been committed . . . .â€\r\nCurrently, these provisions require a contemnor to be allowed a jury trial \r\n  when facing a serious sentenceâ€”i.e., one of greater than six months in prison.Â  \r\n  Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968).Â  However, contemnors have not \r\n  always been afforded the right to a jury trial, even in serious cases.Â  As late \r\n  as 1964, the United States Supreme Court held that there was no right to a jury \r\n  trial in a criminal contempt case.Â  See U.S. v. Barnett, 376 U.S. \r\n  681 (1964).Â  Cheff v. Schnackenberg, 384 U.S. 373 (1966) tempered the \r\n  longstanding rule expressed in Barnett.Â  In Cheff, the Court upheld \r\n  a criminal contempt sentence of six months imposed without the benefit of a \r\n  jury trial.Â  Yet, the Court distinguished the conviction as involving a petty \r\n  offense and concluded: â€œsentences exceeding six months for criminal contempt \r\n  may not be imposed by federal courts absent a jury trial or waiver thereof.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 380.Â  \r\nWith Duncan v. Louisiana, 391 U.S. 145 (1968), the Court declared \r\n  the provisions of the Sixth Amendment were applicable to state governments via \r\n  the Fourteenth Amendment:\r\n\r\nBecause we believe that trial by jury in criminal cases is fundamental to the \r\n  American scheme of justice, we hold that the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees \r\n  a right of jury trial in all criminal cases whichâ€”were they to be tried in federal \r\n  courtâ€”would come within the Sixth Amendmentâ€™s guarantee.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 149 (footnote omitted).Â  The Court further established that â€œin \r\n  the American States, as in the federal judicial system, a general grant of jury \r\n  trial for serious offenses is a fundamental right, essential for preventing \r\n  miscarriages of justice and for assuring that fair trials are provided for all \r\n  defendants.â€Â  Id. at 157-58.Â  However, the Court was careful to note: \r\n  â€œwe hold no constitutional doubts about the practices, common in both federal \r\n  and state courts, of accepting waivers of jury trial and prosecuting petty crimes \r\n  without extending a right to jury trial.â€Â  Id. at 158 (footnotes omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nA pivotal companion case, Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194 (1968), presented \r\n  the question whether a state court could sentence a criminal contemnor to two \r\n  years imprisonment without a jury trial.Â  The Bloom court began by observing \r\n  that the Court had â€œconsistently upheld the constitutional power of the state \r\n  and federal courts to punish any criminal contempt without a jury trial.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 195-96 (emphasis added).Â  The Court acknowledged the holding of \r\n  Cheff that contempt was not an intrinsically serious offense and that \r\n  punishment of six months in prison did not render an offense serious.Â  Justice \r\n  White, writing for the Bloom majority, then explained:\r\n\r\nOur deliberations have convinced us, however, that serious contempts are so \r\n  nearly like other serious crimes that they are subject to the jury trial provisions \r\n  of the Constitution, now binding on the States, and that the traditional rule \r\n  is constitutionally infirm insofar as it permits other than petty contempts \r\n  to be tried without honoring a demand for a jury trial.Â  \r\n. . . .\r\nGiven that criminal contempt is a crime in every fundamental respect, the question \r\n  is whether it is a crime to which the jury trial provisions of the Constitution \r\n  apply.Â  We hold that it is, primarily because in terms of those considerations \r\n  which make the right to jury trial fundamental in criminal cases, there is no \r\n  substantial difference between serious contempts and other serious crimes.Â  \r\n  Indeed, in contempt cases an even more compelling argument can be made for providing \r\n  a right to jury trial as a protection against the arbitrary exercise of official \r\n  power. \r\n\r\nBloom at 198-202. Â \r\nThus, Duncan established that a jury trial must be afforded to a defendant \r\n  facing a serious offense, and Bloom held that Duncan applies in \r\n  the criminal contempt context.Â  Baldwin v. New York, 399 U.S. 66 (1970), \r\n  then presented the Court with the task of defining the line between petty and \r\n  serious offenses.Â  The Court cogently explained:\r\n\r\nIn deciding whether an offense is â€˜petty,â€™ we have sought objective criteria \r\n  reflecting the seriousness with which society regards the offense, . . . and \r\n  we have found the most relevant such criteria in the severity of the maximum \r\n  authorized penalty. . . . [W]e have held that a possible six-month penalty is \r\n  short enough to permit classification of the offense as â€˜petty,â€™ . . . but that \r\n  a two-year maximum is sufficiently â€˜seriousâ€™ to require an opportunity for jury \r\n  trial . . . . The question in this case is whether the possibility of a one-year \r\n  sentence is enough in itself to require the opportunity for a jury trial.Â  We \r\n  hold that it is.Â  More specifically, we have concluded that no offense can be \r\n  deemed â€˜pettyâ€™ for purposes of the right to trial by jury where imprisonment \r\n  for more than six months is authorized.\r\n\r\nId.Â  at 68-69 (footnote and citations omitted).Â  \r\nIn 1974, the Court issued two opinions treating the right to a jury \r\n  trial as affected by multiple contempt sentences of six months or less.Â  In \r\n  Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, 418 U.S. 506 (1974), Codispoti was tried before \r\n  a judge on contempt charges stemming from a prior criminal proceeding in which \r\n  Codispoti was a defendant.Â  His demand for a jury trial in the contempt case \r\n  was denied.Â  Id. at 507-08.Â  The judge found he had committed seven contemptuous \r\n  acts and sentenced him to six months in prison for each of six contempts and \r\n  three months in prison for the seventh, the sentences to run consecutively.Â  \r\n  Id. at 509.Â  Therefore, Codispoti was sentenced to three years and three \r\n  months for his contemptuous acts.Â  Id. at 516.Â  His co-defendant was \r\n  similarly sentenced.Â  Id. at 517.Â  \r\nIn reversing Codispotiâ€™s conviction, the Court reviewed the historical and \r\n  cultural importance the notion of the jury trial holds in the United States:\r\n\r\nThe jury-trial guarantee reflects a profound judgment about the way in which \r\n  law should be enforced and justice administered.Â  A right to jury trial is granted \r\n  to criminal defendants in order to prevent oppression by the Government.Â  \r\n  The Sixth Amendment represents a deep commitment of the Nation to the right \r\n  of jury trial in serious criminal cases as a defense against arbitrary law enforcement.Â  \r\n  Moreover, criminal contempt is a crime in every fundamental respect. . . . (I)n \r\n  terms of those considerations which make the right to jury trial fundamental \r\n  in criminal cases, there is no substantial difference between serious contempts \r\n  and other serious crimes.Â  Indeed, in contempt cases an even more compelling \r\n  argument can be made for providing a right to jury trial as a protection against \r\n  the arbitrary exercise of official power.Â  Contemptuous conduct, though a public \r\n  wrong, often strikes at the most vulnerable and human qualities of a judgeâ€™s \r\n  temperament.Â  Even when the contempt is not a direct insult to the court or \r\n  the judge, it frequently represents a rejection of judicial authority, or an \r\n  interference with the judicial process or with the duties of officers of the \r\n  court.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 515-16 (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).Â  Bloom \r\n  had lucidly established a right to a jury trial where a contemnor was sentenced \r\n  to more than six months in prison; the issue for the Codispoti court \r\n  was whether the defendants â€œwere entitled to jury trials because the prison \r\n  sentences imposed after post-trial convictions for contemptuous acts during \r\n  trial were to be served consecutively and, although each was no more than six \r\n  months, aggregated more than six months in jail.â€Â  Id. at 512-13 (footnote \r\n  omitted).Â  Because â€œthe contempts against each petitioner [were] tried seriatim \r\n  in one proceeding, and . . . the individual sentences were to run consecutively \r\n  rather than concurrently,â€ the Court held: â€œIn terms of the sentence imposed, \r\n  . . . each contemnor was tried for what was equivalent to a serious offense \r\n  and was entitled to a jury trial.â€Â  Id. at 516-17.\r\nIn contrast, Taylor v. Hayes, 418 U.S. 488 (1974), involved a contemptuous \r\n  attorney whose sentences totaled almost four and one half years in the aggregate, \r\n  but ran concurrently and were â€œequivalent to a single sentence of six months.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 495.Â  The Court found the contempts were petty offenses and trial \r\n  by jury was not required.Â  Id. at 496.\r\nShortly after Codispoti and Taylor, the Court recapitulated \r\n  the evolution of the right to trial by jury as follows: \r\n\r\nGreen v. United States, 356 U.S. 165, 78 S.Ct. 632, 2 L.Ed.2d 672 (1958), \r\n  reaffirmed the historic rule that state and federal courts have the constitutional \r\n  power to punish any criminal contempt without a jury trial.Â  United States v. \r\n  Barnett, 376 U.S. 681, 84 S.Ct. 984, 12 L.Ed.2d 23 (1964), and Cheff v. Schnackenberg, \r\n  384 U.S. 373, 86 S.Ct. 1523, 16 L.Ed.2d 629 (1966), presaged a change in this \r\n  rule.Â  The constitutional doctrine which emerged from later decisions such as \r\n  Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968); Frank \r\n  v. United States, 395 U.S. 147, 89 S.Ct. 1503, 23 L.Ed.2d 162 (1969); Baldwin \r\n  v. New York, 399 U.S. 66, 90 S.Ct. 1886, 26 L.Ed.2d 437 (1970); Taylor v. Hayes, \r\n  418 U.S. 488, 94 S.Ct. 2697, 41 L.Ed.2d 897 (1974), and Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, \r\n  418 U.S. 506, 94 S.Ct. 2687, 41 L.Ed.2d 912 (1974), may be capsuled as follows: \r\n  (1) Like other minor crimes, â€˜pettyâ€™ contempts may be tried without a jury, \r\n  but contemnors in serious contempt cases in the federal system have a Sixth \r\n  Amendment right to a jury trial; (2) criminal contempt, in and of itself and \r\n  without regard to the punishment imposed, is not a serious offense absent legislative \r\n  declaration to the contrary; (3) lacking legislative authorization of more serious \r\n  punishment, a sentence of as much as six months in prison, plus normal periods \r\n  of probation, may be imposed without a jury trial; (4) but imprisonment for \r\n  longer than six months is constitutionally impermissible unless the contemnor \r\n  has been given the opportunity for a jury trial.\r\n\r\nMuniz v. Hoffman, 422 U.S. 454, 475-76 (1975).Â  \r\nApproximately half of the states have acknowledged Bloomâ€™s \r\n  prescription.Â  The Supreme Court of Alaska, in State v. Browder, 486 \r\n  P.2d 925 (Alaska 1971), recognized the change in the law brought about by Bloom \r\n  in a case where a contemnor was sentenced to six months in prison for bringing \r\n  a shotgun into a courtroom.Â  Id. at 926-27.Â  However, the Browder \r\n  court concluded that the Alaska Constitution did entitle the contemnor to a \r\n  jury trial for a six-month term of imprisonment.Â  Id. at 935-36.\r\n Bloom \r\n  was addressed by the California Court of Appeal in a case where a contemnor \r\n  was sentenced to 210 days in jail based on forty-two violations of a court order.Â  \r\n  In re Kreitman, 47 Cal.Rptr.2d 595 (Cal. Ct. App. 1995).Â  There, the \r\n  contemnor was not afforded a jury trial; consequently, the court of appeal ordered \r\n  â€œa writ of habeas corpus issue directing the trial court to resentence petitioner \r\n  to a sentence of no more than 180 days.â€Â  Id. at 599.\r\n People v. \r\n  Kriho, 996 P.2d 158 (Colo. Ct. App. 1999) sanctioned Bloom, but found \r\n  the contemnor there was not impermissibly denied a right to a jury trial because \r\n  â€œ[b]efore Kriho was tried for contempt, the People filed a document entitled \r\n  â€˜Notice of Maximum Sentence Not to Exceed Six Months,â€™ which established that \r\n  the People would not seek a jail sentence exceeding six months.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 177.\r\nSimilarly, the \r\n  Delaware Supreme Court, after reviewing the development of the right to a jury \r\n  trial in criminal contempt cases, found that a contemnor was not entitled to \r\n  a trial by jury where he was sentenced to only eighty days for contempt.Â  Thomas \r\n  v. State, 331 A.2d 147 (Del. 1975).\r\nIn Aaron \r\n  v. State, 284 So.2d 673 (Ala. 1973), the Florida Supreme Court deduced that, \r\n  due to Bloom and its line of cases, a â€œjudgeâ€™s denial of a pre-trial \r\n  motion for trial by jury will mean that he cannot impose a sentence of six monthsâ€™ \r\n  imprisonment, or greater, should there be a finding of guilt.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  676.Â  \r\n Dutton v. \r\n  District Court of Third Judicial District, 518 P.2d 1182 (Idaho 1974), is \r\n  another case which endorsed Bloom, but avoided its application because \r\n  â€œpetitioner was found guilty of a misdemeanor.Â  Therefore, he enjoyed no right \r\n  to a jury trial.â€Â  Id. at 1186.\r\nIn McLean \r\n  County v. Kickapoo Creek, Inc., 282 N.E.2d 720 (Ill. 1972), the Supreme \r\n  Court of Illinois reversed the sentence of Lewis, the president of the named \r\n  defendant corporation.Â  Lewis had been sentenced to one year in prison and fined \r\n  $10,000.Â  Lewis planned a rock festival to take place on a farm for Memorial \r\n  Day weekend, 1970.Â  Although he was under a court order not to proceed with \r\n  the festival, Lewis put on the concert and was found in contempt.Â  In reversing \r\n  Lewisâ€™s year sentence, the court found that the facts did not establish that \r\n  Lewis â€œknowingly or expressly waived the right to a jury trial by remaining \r\n  silent during the proceedings.â€Â  Id. at 723. Â Accordingly, his conviction \r\n  was reversed and remanded for a new trial.Â  Id.\r\n Sarich v. \r\n  Havercamp involved a contempt sentence for violation of an injunction against \r\n  practicing dentistry without a license.Â  203 N.W.2d 260 (Iowa 1972).Â  Therein, \r\n  the Iowa Supreme Court held that Bloom, Baldwin, and Duncan \r\n  necessitated the contemnor be given a jury trial where he was â€œexposed to a \r\n  fine of $14,000 maximum or imprisonment for a maximum of 14 years.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 268.Â  \r\n Miller v. \r\n  Vettiner, 481 S.W.2d 32 (Ky. Ct. App. 1972), recognized Bloomâ€™s provision \r\n  that â€œthe Sixth Amendment right to a jury trial applies to criminal contempt \r\n  proceedings in which the offense has been equated with a â€˜seriousâ€™ crime by \r\n  virtue of the extent of punishment authorized by statute.â€Â  Id. at 35.Â  \r\n  However, the $500 fine at issue there was â€œnot enough to equate the offense \r\n  with a â€˜seriousâ€™ crime.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nIn Louisiana \r\n  State Board of Medical Examiners v. Bates, 249 So.2d 127 (La. 1971), the \r\n  Louisiana Supreme Court undertook a thorough review of the applicable Supreme \r\n  Court precedent, and vacated a contemnorâ€™s conviction where, by statute, he \r\n  could have been fined up to $1,000 or sentenced to up to twelve months in prison.Â  \r\n\r\nIn Hinton \r\n  v. State, 222 So.2d 690, 692 (Miss. 1969), the Supreme Court of Mississippi \r\n  concluded, based on Bloom, â€œwhere the confinement is not more than six \r\n  months and the fine not more than $500, that the offense is a petty one and \r\n  the accused is not entitled to a jury trial under the Sixth Amendment to the \r\n  Constitution of the United States.â€Â  Id. at 692.\r\n Ryan v. Moreland, \r\n  653 S.W.2d 244 (Mo. Ct. App. 1983), recognized Bloom and Codispoti, \r\n  but found Ryan distinguishable because â€œthe contempts here did not grow \r\n  out of a unitary course of conduct, i.e., continuing statements of disrespect \r\n  for and villification [sic] of a judge during the course of a trial.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 249.Â  Thus, although the separate contempt sentences amounted to more than \r\n  six months in prison, they were upheld.Â  \r\nThe Court of \r\n  Appeals of New York, in Rankin v. Shanker, 242 N.E.2d 802 (N.Y. 1968) \r\n  noted Bloom is â€œplainly limited in its application to â€˜seriousâ€™ crimes \r\n  in contradistinction to â€˜pettyâ€™ offenses.â€Â  Id. at 807.\r\n In re Davis, \r\n  602 N.E.2d 270 (Ohio App. 1991) recognized a criminal contemnor â€œmust be afforded \r\n  a jury trial for â€˜seriousâ€™ contemptsâ€ and cited Bloom.Â  Davis \r\n  at 278.\r\nIn Commonwealth \r\n  v. Mayberry, 255 A.2d 548 (Pa. 1969), the Pennsylvania Supreme Court recognized \r\n  the rule in Bloom, but based on DeStefano v. Woods, 392 U.S. 631 \r\n  (1968), held that Bloom need not be applied retroactively.Â  Therefore, \r\n  appellantâ€™s sentences totaling five years imprisonment for various contemptuous \r\n  acts were affirmed. \r\n State v. \r\n  Dusina, 764 S.W.2d 766 (Tenn. 1989) cited Bloom and stated: â€œthe \r\n  United States Supreme Court has held that there is no right to a trial by jury \r\n  under the federal constitutionâ€ in cases where a jail sentence of not more than \r\n  six months may be imposed.Â  Id. at 768.\r\n State v. \r\n  Hobble, 892 P.2d 85 (Wash. 1995) subscribed to Bloom, explaining: \r\n  â€œWhere incarceration is the punishment, a jury trial is required only in the \r\n  case of a jail term in excess of 6 months; this principle applies in the case \r\n  of criminal contempt.â€Â  Id. at 94. \r\nIn Hendershot \r\n  v. Hendershot, 263 S.E.2d 90 (W. Va. 1980), the West Virginia Supreme Court \r\n  observed the â€œfederal constitutional right to a jury trial in cases where the \r\n  potential punishment involves imprisonment for more than six months.â€Â  Id. \r\n  at 91.\r\nIn State \r\n  ex rel. Groppi v. Leslie, 171 N.W.2d 192 (Wis. 1969), Groppi was found in \r\n  contempt by the Assembly of the Wisconsin Legislature.Â  The Assembly â€œordered \r\n  his imprisonment for the duration of the 1969 regular session of the Wisconsin \r\n  legislature, or for six months, whichever occurred earlier.â€Â  Id. at \r\n  194.Â  In upholding the sentence, the Wisconsin Supreme Court explained: \r\n\r\nWe are not overlooking [Bloom], wherein the Supreme Court \r\n  after some years of staving off an insistent attack on the summary power of \r\n  the courts in judicial contempt held in one sweep of the sword that in matters \r\n  involving imprisonment of over six months in direct judicial contempts, the \r\n  contemnor was entitled to a jury trial.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 199.Â  The \r\n  court distinguished Groppiâ€™s imprisonment from Bloom: â€œWe do not consider \r\n  this case controlling legislative contempts because as pointed out in this opinion \r\n  the confinement for legislative contempt is inherently not punishment and is \r\n  different from either judicial contempt imprisonment or imprisonment for a crime.â€Â  \r\n  Id.Â  See also Morrow v. Roberts, 467 S.W.2d 393 (Ark. 1971) \r\n  (recognizing the efficacy of the constitutional pronouncement in Bloom); \r\n  Ashford v. State, 750 A.2d 35 (Md. 2000) (same); Spalter v. Kaufman, \r\n  192 N.W.2d 347 (Mich. App. 1971) (same); State v. Smith, 672 P.2d 631 \r\n  (Nev. 1983) (same); Ex parte Williams, 799 S.W.2d 304 (Tex. Cr. App. \r\n  1990) (same); Skinner v. State, 838 P.2d 715 (Wyo. 1992) (same).\r\nSouth Carolina courts have recognized \r\n  the Bloom mandate as well.Â  In Curlee v. Howle, 277 S.C. 377, \r\n  287 S.E.2d 915 (1982), our supreme court observed:\r\n\r\nIn Bloom v. Illinois, 391 U.S. 194, 88 S.Ct. 1477, 20 L.Ed.2d 522 (1968), \r\n  the Supreme Court held that prosecutions for serious criminal contempts \r\n  are subject to the jury provisions of Art. III, Section 2 of the Constitution, \r\n  and of the Sixth Amendment, which is made binding upon the states by virtue \r\n  of the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.Â  In Codispoti v. Pennsylvania, \r\n  418 U.S. 506, . . . (1974) the court held that defendants in state criminal \r\n  trials who are committed to imprisonment of more than 6 months are entitled \r\n  to a jury trial.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 383, 287 S.E.2d at 918; see \r\n  also Poston v. Poston, 331 S.C. 106, 113, 502 S.E.2d 86, 89 (1998) \r\n  (â€œThe United States Supreme Court has held a defendant charged with a serious \r\n  as opposed to a petty criminal contempt is entitled to a jury trial.â€); State \r\n  v. Buchanan, 279 S.C. 194, 304 S.E.2d 819 (1983) (finding that defendantâ€™s \r\n  sentence of six months in prison did not entitle him to a jury trial and citing \r\n  Codispoti).\r\nHere, Appellant was sentenced to one year in prison, but was not \r\n  afforded a right to a jury trial.Â  This constitutes a violation of Article III, \r\n  Section 2, and the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted by Bloom v. Illinois.Â  \r\nII.Â  Mootness\r\nThe State contends that even if Appellantâ€™s sentence was unconstitutional, \r\n  we should affirm because she has served the sentence, rendering the case moot.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA case becomes moot when a judgment, if rendered, would have no practical \r\n  legal effect upon the existing controversy, thus making it impossible for the \r\n  reviewing court to grant effectual relief.Â  Byrd v. Irmo High School, \r\n  321 S.C. 426, 431, 468 S.E.2d 861, 864 (1996); Cheap-Oâ€™s Truck Stop, Inc. \r\n  v. Cloyd, 350 S.C. 596, 603, 567 S.E.2d 514, 517 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  In Sloan \r\n  v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 590 S.E.2d 338 (Ct. App. 2003), we stated \r\n  the law of mootness with exactitude:\r\n\r\nIn general, this court may only consider cases where a justiciable controversy \r\n  exists.Â  A justiciable controversy is a real and substantial controversy which \r\n  is ripe and appropriate for judicial determination, as distinguished from a \r\n  contingent, hypothetical or abstract dispute.Â  Moot appeals differ from unripe \r\n  appeals in that moot appeals result when intervening events render a case nonjusticiable.Â  \r\n  This Court will not pass on moot and academic questions or make an adjudication \r\n  where there remains no actual controversy. . . . The function of appellate courts \r\n  is not to give opinions on merely abstract or theoretical matters, but only \r\n  to decide actual controversies injuriously affecting the rights of some party \r\n  to the litigation.Â  Accordingly, cases or issues which have become moot or academic \r\n  in nature are not a proper subject of review.\r\n\r\nId. at 552, 590 S.E.2d at 349 (internal quotation marks and citations \r\n  omitted). \r\nThe mootness doctrine is subject to several exceptions, however.Â  \r\n  In Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 549 S.E.2d 591 (2001), our supreme \r\n  court enunciated the three primary exceptions to the doctrine:\r\n\r\nFirst, an appellate court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if the issue \r\n  raised is capable of repetition but evading review.Â  Second, an appellate court \r\n  may decide questions of imperative and manifest urgency to establish a rule \r\n  for future conduct in matters of important public interest.Â  Finally, if a decision \r\n  by the trial court may affect future events, an appeal from that decision is \r\n  not moot, even though the appellate court cannot give effective relief in the \r\n  present case.\r\n\r\nId. at 568, 549 S.E.2d at 596 (citations omitted).Â  \r\nWe find the \r\n  first and third exceptions applicable, and, thus, refuse to dismiss Appellantâ€™s \r\n  appeal as moot.\r\nFirst, Appellantâ€™s infelicitous experience is capable of repetition, \r\n  yet evades review.Â  In Byrd v. Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 568 S.E.2d \r\n  861 (1996), the South Carolina Supreme Court clarified the capable of repetition \r\n  but evading review principle, noting an inconsistency in our courtsâ€™ decisions \r\n  on the subject.Â  \r\n\r\nSome cases have held that under the exception, a court can take jurisdiction \r\n  only if (1) the challenged action in its duration was too short to be fully \r\n  litigated prior to its cessation or expiration; and (2) there is a reasonable \r\n  expectation that the same complaining party will be subjected to the action \r\n  again.\r\nOther cases have taken a less restrictive approach in defining the \r\n  exception, holding that a court can take jurisdiction, despite mootness, if \r\n  the issue raised is capable of repetition but evading review.Â  In effect, this \r\n  latter approach differs from the former in that it does not require a reasonable \r\n  expectation that the same complaining party be subjected to the action again.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 431, 568 S.E.2d at 864 (internal quotation marks and citations \r\n  omitted).Â  The court clarified the inconsistency with the pronouncement: â€œthis \r\n  less restrictive approach is the appropriate standard in determining the applicability \r\n  of the evading review exception of the mootness doctrine.â€Â  Id. at 432, \r\n  568 S.E.2d at 864.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the State concedes in its brief: â€œthe sentence \r\n  was in fact too brief to be fully litigated through appeal prior to its expiration \r\n  . . . .â€Â  The issue, then, is whether the constitutional violation suffered \r\n  by Appellant could be inflicted on a contemnor in the future.Â  That the unconstitutional \r\n  sentence was imposed here is evidence enough a judge could make the same error \r\n  in the future.Â  Concomitantly, we find it necessary to remind the bench of the \r\n  constitutional limitation on a judgeâ€™s power of contempt.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Appellantâ€™s case is not moot because the unconstitutional \r\n  sentence could continue to affect her through collateral consequences.Â  Although \r\n  Appellantâ€™s time has been served, she may yet experience the repercussions of \r\n  having been sentenced to a year in prison for contempt of court.Â  For example, \r\n  she might be obliged to indicate jail time served on an employment application.Â  \r\n  Thus, the sentence could affect her ability to obtain future employment.Â  Likewise, \r\n  she could be required to disclose the conviction on a credit application, thereby \r\n  hindering her chances of securing credit.Â  Further, driversâ€™ license applications, \r\n  voter registration applications, and other documents may mandate the divulgence \r\n  of prior convictions.Â  Hence, Appellantâ€™s unconstitutional conviction will continue \r\n  to stigmatize and prejudice her.Â  These significant collateral consequences \r\n  are enough to surmount the mootness doctrine.Â  \r\nIII.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nThe State argues that even if we do not find this case moot, we should \r\n  affirm because the issue was not preserved.Â  \r\nThe general rule of issue preservation states that if an issue was \r\n  not raised and ruled upon below, it will not be considered for the first time \r\n  on appeal.Â Â  State v. Dunbar, 356 S.C. 138, 587 S.E.2d 862 (2003); State \r\n  v. Lee, 350 S.C. 125, 564 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  Our courts have â€œconsistently \r\n  refused to apply the plain error rule.â€Â  Jackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, \r\n  306, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997) (citations omitted).Â  Instead, we have held: \r\n  â€œit is the responsibility of counsel to preserve issues for appellate review.â€Â  \r\n  Id.  \r\nOur supreme court, in Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, \r\n  338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000), explained the rationale behind this longstanding \r\n  rule:Â  \r\n\r\nImposing this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the \r\n  lower court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, \r\n  and arguments.Â  The requirement also serves as a keen incentive for a party \r\n  to prepare a case thoroughly.Â  It prevents a party from keeping an ace card \r\n  up his sleeveâ€”intentionally or by chanceâ€”in the hope that an appellate court \r\n  will accept that ace card and, via a reversal, give him another opportunity \r\n  to prove his case.\r\n\r\nId. at 422, 526 S.E.2d at 724 (citations omitted);Â  see also \r\n  Ellie, Inc. v. Micchichi, 358 S.C. 78, 103, 594 S.E.2d 485, 498 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2004) (â€œWithout an initial ruling by the trial court, a reviewing court \r\n  simply would not be able to evaluate whether the trial court committed error.â€). \r\n\r\nThe issue preservation requirement applies to assertions of constitutional \r\n  violations as well.Â  For example, in Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612, \r\n  576 S.E.2d 156 (2003), the court held that â€œ[a] due process claim raised for \r\n  the first time on appeal is not preserved.â€ Id. at 625, 576 S.E.2d at \r\n  163 (citing Grant v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 \r\n  S.E.2d 388 (1995)); accord Durlach v. Durlach, 359 S.C. 64, 596 \r\n  S.E.2d 908 (2004).Â  And in State v. McWee 322 S.C. 387, 472 S.E.2d 235 \r\n  (1996), where appellant asserted violations of due process and his Eighth Amendment \r\n  rights, the court stated: â€œthis issue is not preserved for review because at \r\n  trial, appellant never cited any constitutional basis for his request to give \r\n  a parole eligibility charge.â€Â  Id. at 391, 472 S.E.2d at 238 (citations \r\n  omitted).Â  \r\nNevertheless, the rule that an unpreserved issue will not be considered \r\n  on appeal does have its exceptions.Â  Foremost is the axiomatic principle of \r\n  law that lack of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, including \r\n  for the first time on appeal.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  773 (1998); State v. Richburg, 304 S.C. 162, 403 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  \r\n  Additionally, our courts have developed the doctrine of futility, which recognizes \r\n  that in circumstances where it would be futile to raise an objection to the \r\n  trial judge, failure to raise the objection will be excused.Â  See State \r\n  v. Pace, 316 S.C. 71, 74, 447 S.E.2d 186, 187 (1994) (finding â€œ[a]s to counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to raise an objection, the tone and tenor of the trial judgeâ€™s remarks \r\n  concerning her gender and conduct were such that any objection would have been \r\n  futile.â€);Â  State v. Higgenbottom, 344 S.C. 11, 542 S.E.2d 718 (2001) \r\n  (employing futility doctrine). \r\nFurther, an exception exists where the interests of minors or incompetents \r\n  are involved.Â  See Shake v. Darlington county Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs., \r\n  306 S.C. 216, 219 n.2, 410 S.E.2d 923, 924 n.2 (Ct. App. 1991) (noting, in a \r\n  termination of parental rights action, that â€œ[a]lthough it is questionable whether \r\n  Mrs. Shake properly raised each of [the] grounds for termination at trial, we \r\n  nevertheless address them all.â€); Joiner ex rel. Rivas v. Rivas, 342 \r\n  S.C. 102, 536 S.E.2d 372 (2000) (approving the court of appealsâ€™ conclusion \r\n  that procedural rules are subservient to the courtâ€™s duty to zealously guard \r\n  the rights of minors); Caughman v. Caughman, 247 S.C. 104, 109, 146 S.E.2d \r\n  93, 95 (1965) (holding that â€œthe duty to protect the rights of incompetents \r\n  has precedence over procedural rules otherwise limiting the scope of review.â€).\r\nAppellant cites State \r\n  v. Johnston, 333 S.C. 459, 510 S.E.2d 423 (1999), as providing her an exception \r\n  to the general rule of issue preservation.Â  In Johnston, the defendant \r\n  was sentenced to ten years in prison for conspiracy.Â  She did not object at \r\n  trial, but on appeal, she contended the trial court lacked the authority to \r\n  impose a sentence of ten years for her conspiracy conviction.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  she argued the issue was one of subject matter jurisdiction and could be raised \r\n  for the first time on appeal.Â  The supreme court observed â€œthis Court has consistently \r\n  held that a challenge to sentencing must be raised at trial, or the issue will \r\n  not be preserved for appellate review.â€Â  Id. at 462, 510 S.E.2d at 425.Â  \r\n  The court rejected Johnstonâ€™s argument that the trial court lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction, stating: â€œSouth Carolina courts have continued to recognize a \r\n  distinction between a trial courtâ€™s sentencing authority and its subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.â€Â  Id. at 463, 510 S.E.2d 423.Â  However, the court acknowledged \r\n  that \r\n\r\nif this Court unyieldingly enforces PCR as the only avenue of relief in this \r\n  case, there is the real threat that Defendant will remain incarcerated beyond \r\n  the legal sentence due to the additional time it will take to pursue such a \r\n  remedy.Â  Under these exceptional circumstances, we hold this case should be \r\n  remanded for resentencing.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 463-64, 510 S.E.2d at 425.Â  We find the exceptional circumstance \r\n  carefully carved out by the Johnston court is not present here.Â  Appellant \r\n  has already served the duration of her sentence; therefore, she does not face \r\n  the threat of continuing incarceration beyond the legal sentence.Â  Johnston \r\n  does not control.Â  \r\nWe find none of these exceptions to the general rule requiring issue \r\n  preservation applicable.Â  Having written to the point of expiation, we come \r\n  to the ineluctable conclusion that we are constrained by the preservation barrier.Â  \r\n  Appellant will be forced to seek redress through the avenue of post-conviction \r\n  relief.Â  See Toal, Vafai, and Muckenfuss, Appellate Practice in South \r\n  Carolina at 62 (2d ed. 2002) (â€œIn criminal cases, although the failure of \r\n  an attorney to preserve an issue at trial will preclude appellate review of \r\n  that issue, it may nonetheless be a ground in a civil action for post-conviction \r\n  relief as a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel.â€) (citing Fossick \r\n  v. State, 317 S.C. 375, 453 S.E.2d 899 (1995)).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nRegrettably, Appellant has suffered a violation of her right to a \r\n  jury trial in this case.Â  However, because she failed to raise an objection \r\n  at trial, we are compelled to let the unconstitutional sentence stand.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the decision of the family court is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n BEATTY and SHORT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    We decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3951","title":"Jones v.

Thayer Rivers, of Ridgeland, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n WILLIAMS, J.:Â  Brenda Jones appeals a special refereeâ€™s decision \r\n  that her use of Lake Daleyâ€™s property for ingress and egress to her own property \r\n  did not create an easement by prescription.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1939, Thomas Washington acquired title to fifty acres of property \r\n  in Jasper County.Â  This property was divided and sold to unrelated parties in \r\n  1963, except for a five-acre parcel Thomas gave to his daughter, Jamie Washington.Â  \r\n  Ms. Washington granted her niece, Brenda Jones, a one-half interest in this \r\n  parcel in 1982.Â  In 1993, Jones was granted the remaining half interest, giving \r\n  her full title to the five-acre property (â€œthe Jones Parcelâ€).Â  Â Â \r\nThroughout the Washington familyâ€™s ownership of the Jones Parcel \r\n  and the larger fifty-acre tract, the only access to the property was by use \r\n  of a trail that followed the northern and eastern boundary of a two hundred \r\n  acre parcel (â€œthe Daley Parcelâ€) situated between it and the nearest public \r\n  road.Â  This trail, the use of which is at issue in this case, followed the Daley \r\n  Parcelâ€™s outer borders, but was situated entirely within the parcelâ€™s boundaries.Â  \r\n  Union Camp owned the Daley Parcel until 1987, when it was sold to Delta Plantation.Â  \r\n  In the late 1990s, Lake Daley purchased the two hundred acres from Delta Plantation.\r\nJonesâ€™s three uncles, who worked the Jones Parcel with their father, \r\n  original owner Thomas Washington, all testified the family actively farmed the \r\n  property from at least the early 1950s until 1959.Â  At some point in the early \r\n  1950s, Union Camp plowed the preexisting access trail for the purpose of creating \r\n  a firebreak.Â  Following Union Campâ€™s plowing, the Washingtons worked the plowed \r\n  path with shovels, leveling out the newly cleared trail to make the path more \r\n  suitable for ingress and egress to their property.Â  Union Camp periodically \r\n  plowed the firebreak, and each time the Washingtons reworked the trail to smooth \r\n  it down for better travel.Â  The Washingtons never requested permission to use \r\n  the trail because they believed, since the trail was the only access to their \r\n  property, they had a valid legal right to maintain and use it for ingress and \r\n  egress.Â  Union Camp, the Daley Parcelâ€™s owner for most of the time period at \r\n  issue, was aware of the Washingtonsâ€™ use and maintenance of the trail and fully \r\n  condoned it for over thirty-five years.Â  Â Â \r\nBecause the Washingtons ceased farming the Jones Parcel around \r\n  1959, their use of the trail became less frequent in the decades that followed.Â  \r\n  They did, however, continue to periodically visit the property and maintain \r\n  the trail following Union Campâ€™s plowing.Â  A nearby resident since the 1960s \r\n  testified that the trailâ€™s use to reach â€œburiedâ€ property was common community \r\n  knowledge.Â  Jones, age 46, testified the trail was used by her family to access \r\n  the parcel â€œas far back as [she] remembered,â€ and she specifically recalls using \r\n  the access herself since the 70s or 80s.Â  Because Jones is not a South Carolina \r\n  resident, however, her visits to the property, though many, were sporadic.Â Â  \r\n\r\nIn the mid-1990s, Delta Plantation, then owner of the Daley Parcel, \r\n  decided to close a road used by several other â€œburiedâ€ landowners that crossed \r\n  directly over the two hundred acre property.Â  To satisfy landowners who possessed \r\n  recorded easements over the closed road, the access trail used by the Washington \r\n  family was expanded into a full-sized road.Â  An employee for Delta Plantation, \r\n  who worked on the trail expansion, testified as to the state of the trail when \r\n  they decided to build the new road.Â  He stated he had maintained and expanded \r\n  the firebreak since the beginning of his employment in 1987.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  when asked if the new road was built over an existing road, he stated, â€œNo . \r\n  . . there was a fireline, but just barely.â€Â  He testified that by the mid-90s \r\n  the trail was nothing more than a â€œdeer trail.â€Â  The employee conceded, however, \r\n  that the path was about eight feet wide in places and would be traversable by \r\n  a small tractor.Â Â Â  \r\nFollowing the trailâ€™s expansion into a fully accessible road, all \r\n  landowners with recorded easements over the closed road were granted written \r\n  easements over the newly created one.Â  Because Jones did not have a recorded \r\n  easement to use the closed road, she was not granted a written easement to use \r\n  the road built over her parcelâ€™s only access. \r\n  [1] Â  Despite a survey her uncle commissioned in 1989 of the Jones Parcel \r\n  which recommended a written easement be obtained from Daley, Jones maintained \r\n  the belief that she had a right to use the newly created road.Â Â  \r\nIn 2001, Jones attempted to haul timber from her parcel over the \r\n  Daley Parcelâ€™s road.Â  Daley objected to this activity.Â  In 2002, Jones brought \r\n  an action against Daley to declare an easement by prescription for ingress and \r\n  egress over the road.Â  The appointed special referee found no easement by prescription \r\n  was created by Jones and her predecessorsâ€™ prior use.Â  This appeal followed.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nEstablishing the existence of an easement is a question of fact in \r\n  a law action.Â  Jowers v.Â  Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551, 357 S.E.2d 710, \r\n  711 (1987); Hartley v. John Wesley United Methodist Church of Johns Island, \r\n  355 S.C. 145, 148, 584 S.E.2d 386, 387 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  The present matter \r\n  was consensually referred to a special referee.Â  Accordingly, our scope of review \r\n  is limited to the correction of errors of law, and we will not disturb the refereeâ€™s \r\n  factual findings that have some evidentiary support.Â  Townes Assocs., Ltd. \r\n  v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 85-86, 221 S.E.2d 733, 775 (1976); Hartley, \r\n  355 S.C. at 148, 584 S.E.2d at 387.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nAs a preliminary matter, we address Daleyâ€™s assertions that \r\n  the issues Jones raises on appeal are not preserved for our review.Â  It is Daleyâ€™s \r\n  position that because Jones pled she â€œowns a right to use the easement of ingress \r\n  and egress by prescription for continuous open hostile and adverse possession,â€ \r\n  she may not now assert a prescriptive easement under a claim of right on appeal.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIt is well-settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first \r\n  time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review.â€ Â Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, \r\n  339 S.C. 406, 412, 529 S.E.2d 543, 546 (2000).Â  In the present case, the special \r\n  referee opened trial by stating to the parties and their lawyers there would \r\n  not be opening or closing arguments in the case.Â  Instead, the referee stated \r\n  he would give both parties â€œten days to submit me a letter in the way of a closing \r\n  argument summarizing what they think that their witnesses said and what their \r\n  position is as to what the ruling . . . that I make should be.â€Â  Jones, unlike \r\n  Daley, availed herself of this opportunity, clearly and cogently raising Jonesâ€™ \r\n  satisfaction of the claim of right element to establishing the easement by prescription.Â  \r\n  The special referee, after ten months of consideration, addressed the claim \r\n  of right issue in his final order, but dismissed Jonesâ€™s arguments, finding \r\n  no easement was established.Â  Because these issues were raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the special referee, we conclude they are preserved for our review.Â  \r\n  Having addressed the issuesâ€™ preservation for appellate review, we move now \r\n  to the merits of the refereeâ€™s legal conclusions.\r\nI. The Requisite Elements of Establishing a Prescriptive Easement\r\nJones argues the referee erred in concluding a prescriptive easement \r\n  can only be established by use that is both adverse and under a claim \r\n  of right.Â  We agree.\r\nRelying on the case of Nelums v. Cousins, 304 S.C. 306, 308, \r\n  403 S.E.2d 681, 682 (Ct. App. 1991), the referee incorrectly stated the elements \r\n  of establishing a prescriptive easement as twenty years of use which is â€œadverse, \r\n  exclusive, continuous, and uninterrupted and occurred under claim of right and \r\n  with the knowledge or acquiescence of [the] owner of [the] servient estate or \r\n  predecessors in title.â€Â  Applying these elements, he concluded Jones failed \r\n  to establish an easement because â€œthere is no exclusive use of the premises \r\n  nor was the use by the Plaintiffâ€™s predecessors in title hostile or adverse \r\n  to that of the owner of the property in question.â€Â  \r\nSince Nelums, South Carolina courts have simplified the elements \r\n  of establishing a prescriptive easement.Â  In order to establish an easement \r\n  by prescription, a party must only show: (1) the continued and uninterrupted \r\n  use or enjoyment of a right for a full period of twenty years; (2) the identity \r\n  of the thing enjoyed; and (3) that the use or enjoyment was adverse or \r\n  under a claim of right.Â  Horry County v. Lachur, 315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 \r\n  S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993); Loftis v. South Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas, 361 \r\n  S.C. 434, 604 S.E.2d 714, 716 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The source of the refereeâ€™s \r\n  understandable confusion on this matter was discussed and resolved in this courtâ€™s \r\n  case of Revis v. Barrett, 321 S.C. 206, 209 n.1, 467 S.E.2d 460, 462 \r\n  n. 1 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  To establish an easement by prescription, one need only \r\n  establish either a justifiable claim of right or adverse and hostile \r\n  use.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, there is an abundance of testimony in the record \r\n  reflecting Jones and her predecessorâ€™s claim of right to the easement.Â  Jones \r\n  testified she believed she had a right to use the access because her family \r\n  had used it to get to and from the parcel for â€œas long as she can remember.â€ \r\n  All three of her uncles testified they openly asserted their perceived right \r\n  to use the pre-existing path with the full knowledge and acquiescence of Union \r\n  Camp, owner of the Daley parcel for over thirty-five years.Â  We find Jones adequately \r\n  demonstrated a substantial belief that she had the right to use the property \r\n  in a manner consistent with the alleged easement, originating from her familyâ€™s \r\n  prior use of the access.Â  See Loftis, 361 S.C. at __, 604 S.E.2d \r\n  at 717; Hartley, 355 S.C. at 151, 584 S.E.2d at 389 (â€œ[I]n order for \r\n  a party to earn a prescriptive easement under claim of right he must demonstrate \r\n  a substantial belief that he had the right to use the parcel or road based upon \r\n  the totality of circumstances surrounding his use.â€); Revis, 321 S.C. \r\n  atÂ  209-210, 467 S.E.2d at 462 (finding a prescriptive easement flowed from \r\n  a partyâ€™s claim of right when she was justifiably under the impression she had \r\n  a right to use the road).Â  Considering only the undisputed facts presented to \r\n  the special referee, Jones satisfied the third element of establishing a prescriptive \r\n  easement. \r\nSimilarly, the referee erred in basing his decision so largely on \r\n  the fact that, because the Daley Parcel owners also used the trail as a firebreak, \r\n  Jonesâ€™s use was not exclusive.Â  As reflected in the enumerated elements above, \r\n  there is no requirement of exclusivity of use to establish a prescriptive easement.Â  \r\n  An easement is the legal assertion that one has a valid right to share in the \r\n  use of anotherâ€™s property for a specific purpose.Â  See 25 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Easements and Licenses Â§ 1 (1996).Â  By the very nature of easements, \r\n  requiring that oneâ€™s use be truly exclusive to establish a prescriptive easement \r\n  would essentially render it impossible to establish.Â  Accordingly, even when \r\n  our courts have applied a requirement of exclusivity, it has been interpreted \r\n  narrowly as merely the requirement that oneâ€™s claim be asserted independently \r\n  of other users.Â  See Nelums, 304 S.C. at 308, 403 S.E.2d at 682.Â  \r\n  Again, the refereeâ€™s confusion on this matter is understandable considering \r\n  the language employed by this court in the second section of Nelums and \r\n  the subtle, yet crucial, differences between establishing a prescriptive easement \r\n  and establishing ownership through adverse possession.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nII. Continued and Uninterrupted Use\r\nAs stated in the previous section, the primary foundation of the \r\n  refereeâ€™s decision was an erroneous application of South Carolina law.Â  The \r\n  referee continued, however, to state that Jonesâ€™s use â€œdoes not appear to have \r\n  been continuous and uninterrupted.â€Â  It is undisputed that since Union Campâ€™s \r\n  acquiescence to the Washingtonsâ€™ use, no overt actions were taken by the owners \r\n  of the Daley Parcel to prevent use of the right of way prior to the actions \r\n  that gave rise to this action.Â  Jonesâ€™s use, therefore, has satisfied the â€œuninterruptedâ€ \r\n  requirement.Â  We are left, however, with the vague finding that the use of Jones \r\n  and her predecessors â€œdoes not appear to have been . . . continued.â€Â  The refereeâ€™s \r\n  firm decision to deny the easementâ€™s establishment on the ground of exclusivity \r\n  left this element largely unexplored.\r\nAs the special referee is the ultimate finder of fact in this action, \r\n  we remand the case for more specific findings on the issue of continued use.Â  \r\n  We note, however, that under long established principles of South Carolina law, \r\n  once a right of way by prescription has been established by twenty years of \r\n  continuous use, a later diminishment in the frequency of that use does not necessarily \r\n  nullify the established right by prescription.Â  Cuthbert v. Lawton, 3 \r\n  McCord 194, 14 S.C.L. 194 (Ct. App. 1825).Â  Furthermore, in order to satisfy \r\n  the continual use requirement, the use must only be of a reasonable frequency \r\n  as determined from the nature and needs of the claimant.Â  See 25 Am. \r\n  Jur. 2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 68 (1996) (â€œ[The element of continued \r\n  use] does not require the use thereof every day for the statutory period or \r\n  even on a weekly or monthly basis; but simply the exercise of the right more \r\n  or less frequently according to the nature of the use and the needs of the claimant.â€).\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the special refereeâ€™s decision is\r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n HEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The road closed by Delta Plantation in the mid-1990s \r\n    did not connect to the Jones Parcel.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3952","title":"State v.

Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Deborah R.J. \r\n  Shupe, all of Columbia; and Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nBEATTY, J.:Â  Kristopher Miller was fourteen years old at the time he \r\n  was charged with the murder of his father.Â  On appeal, he argues the circuit \r\n  court was without jurisdiction to accept his guilty pleas to voluntary manslaughter \r\n  and possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime because \r\n  the family court erroneously waived jurisdiction.Â  We affirm. \r\n  [1]   \r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 2, 2001, Miller shot his father, Steve Miller, nine \r\n  times.Â  Miller then dragged his fatherâ€™s body into the bedroom, covered \r\n  it with blankets, and locked the bedroom door.Â  Unable to clean the blood in \r\n  the living room, Miller placed a blanket over the bloodstains.Â  Shortly thereafter, \r\n  Miller called his paternal grandfather, Dr. Lee Miller, and step-grandmother, \r\n  Joann Bock, and expressed concern that his father had left the home with someone.Â  \r\n  He told them that he was frightened and did not want to be alone.Â  Miller left \r\n  a note stating that he had gone to his grandfatherâ€™s home.Â  When his grandfather \r\n  arrived, Miller was standing in the yard and would not let him enter the home.Â  \r\n  According to Bock, Miller appeared â€œvery, very normal.â€\r\nAt his grandfatherâ€™s home, Miller played computer games while \r\n  Bock prepared dinner.Â  Before eating, Miller asked for a nailbrush so that he \r\n  could scrub his nails.Â  Some time during the evening, Miller called his fatherâ€™s \r\n  home and left a message on the answering machine.Â  In the message, Miller informed \r\n  his father of where he was that evening and then left his grandfatherâ€™s telephone \r\n  number.\r\nBecause several hours passed without hearing from his son, Dr. Miller \r\n  became concerned and called the South Carolina Highway Department as well as \r\n  several local hospitals to determine whether his son had been in an accident.Â  \r\n  When his investigation failed to reveal any information, he filed a missing \r\n  personâ€™s report with the Pendleton Police Department.Â  Around 10:30 p.m., officers \r\n  arrived to start an initial report.\r\nThe next day, Miller, his grandfather, and Bock went to Millerâ€™s \r\n  home.Â  During the drive, Miller commented, â€œI just hope Dadâ€™s okay.â€Â  When they \r\n  entered the home, they found a blanket covered with bloodstains on the living \r\n  room carpet.Â  Dr. Miller followed the bloodstains down the hall to his sonâ€™s \r\n  locked bedroom.Â  After knocking on the door and not receiving any answer, they \r\n  then called 911.\r\nDeputy Cris Vaughn was dispatched to the Miller residence. Â When \r\n  Vaughn kicked open the bedroom door, he discovered Steve Millerâ€™s body under \r\n  several blankets.Â  Investigator Rusty Garrett arrived at the home shortly after \r\n  Vaughn.Â  Garrett questioned Miller about the last time he saw his father \r\n  alive.Â  Miller responded that his father had sent him to his room around 2:15 \r\n  p.m. the previous day when he played with his fatherâ€™s computer without first \r\n  asking permission.Â  Miller then told Garrett that he called his grandfather \r\n  after his father left the home with an unidentified male.Â  After Garrett \r\n  tested Millerâ€™s hands for gunshot residue, Miller told Garrett that his father \r\n  had raped him and that he could not take it anymore.Â  \r\nInvestigator Garrett then transported Miller to the law enforcement \r\n  center.Â  Miller gave a statement after being advised of his Miranda rights.Â  \r\n  In the statement, Miller claimed that his father had sexually abused him since \r\n  he was ten years old.Â  Miller stated the abuse began again when he returned \r\n  to his fatherâ€™s home after living with his aunt and uncle from approximately \r\n  January 1999 until August 2000.Â  Miller further stated that he shot his \r\n  father when his father attempted to abuse him.Â  In an addendum to the \r\n  statement, Miller explained how he shot his father and identified the type of \r\n  weapon that he used.\r\nAfter a sexual assault examination revealed no physical signs of \r\n  abuse, Miller gave a second statement in which he admitted that his father had \r\n  never sexually abused him.Â  He also claimed that he was playing with \r\n  the gun under his jacket when it accidentally discharged.Â  In a final statement, \r\n  Miller again admitted that he had lied about being sexually abused.Â  He also \r\n  stated that the gun went off accidentally but he panicked and kept pulling the \r\n  trigger.Â  He added that he retrieved a second gun from under his fatherâ€™s pillow \r\n  and proceeded to fire at his father until the gun was empty. \r\nOn January 4, 2001, the State filed a juvenile petition charging \r\n  Miller with murder.Â  Pursuant to section 20-7-7605 \r\n  [2]  of the South Carolina Code of Laws, the State moved to transfer jurisdiction \r\n  to the circuit court.Â  The family court judge heard two days of testimony, which \r\n  included:Â  (1) details regarding the investigation of the murder; (2) forensic \r\n  evidence of the crime scene; (3) Millerâ€™s family history; (4) Millerâ€™s academic \r\n  performance; (5) Millerâ€™s mental and emotional state; (6) Millerâ€™s adjustment \r\n  to the DJJ environment; and (7) the differences between a commitment to DJJ \r\n  and the adult prison system.Â  \r\nBoth sides offered a significant amount of testimony regarding Millerâ€™s mental \r\n  and emotional state before and after the incident.Â  Dr. Craig Williams, who \r\n  evaluated Miller for the purposes of the waiver hearing, stated that Miller \r\n  had an above average intelligence with an IQ of 113.Â  Dr. Williams testified \r\n  Miller was immature for his age, had poor interpersonal skills, and did not \r\n  like to be held accountable for his actions.Â  His evaluation also revealed that \r\n  Miller exhibited depressive symptoms.Â  He characterized Millerâ€™s ability to \r\n  engage in normal activities after the shooting as that of a â€œvery bazaar [sic], \r\n  confused individual.â€Â  In terms of Millerâ€™s remorse for shooting his father, \r\n  Dr. Williams testified that Miller â€œwas actually more focused on himself at \r\n  the time about his, his life.â€Â  As to Millerâ€™s family history, Dr. Williams \r\n  testified that Miller informed him that his biological mother had abandoned \r\n  him when he was a year old, his father was verbally and physically abusive, \r\n  and his father abused alcohol.Â  Dr. Williams acknowledged that Miller was taken \r\n  into the custody of DSS for a period of time.Â  Dr. Williams felt that Miller \r\n  could benefit from the highly structured environment in DJJ and the individual \r\n  and group counseling.Â  Based on his evaluation, Dr. Williams believed that Miller \r\n  was functioning more as a child as opposed to an adult and, as a result, should \r\n  be tried as a juvenile.Â  However, he admitted that if Miller were tried as an \r\n  adult he would still receive the same treatment offered to juveniles.\r\nDr. Julian Sharman, a clinical psychologist with DJJ, testified that \r\n  Miller had adapted and done â€œvery wellâ€ living in the â€œspecial needs wingâ€ at \r\n  DJJ.Â  He also felt that Miller had gained social maturity and that there was \r\n  a change in his depressive symptoms.Â  He believed that Miller would benefit \r\n  from the treatment available at DJJ.Â  Based on his assessment, Dr. Sharman concluded \r\n  that Miller should be tried as a juvenile.Â  He acknowledged that if Miller \r\n  were tried as an adult he would remain for a period of time in the juvenile \r\n  system and would for the most part receive the same services offered in the \r\n  juvenile system.Â  He noted that if Miller were tried as an adult, he would likely \r\n  be housed in a secure facility, as opposed to an â€œopen campus,â€ and as a result \r\n  would not have â€œquite as many services.â€ \r\nDr. Elin Berg, a forensic psychiatrist, evaluated Miller at the request \r\n  of the defense.Â  She diagnosed Miller as having a major depressive disorder, \r\n  post-traumatic stress disorder, and a reading disorder.Â  She felt Miller did \r\n  not exhibit psychotic behavior and there was no evidence of an anti-social personality \r\n  disorder.Â  She assessed Miller as ten years old in terms of his maturity level.Â  \r\n  Dr. Berg also believed that Miller was amenable to rehabilitation and could \r\n  receive individual and group therapy at DJJ.Â  Based on her evaluations, Dr. \r\n  Berg recommended that Miller be tried as a juvenile.\r\nAfter the hearing, the family court judge ordered Millerâ€™s case to \r\n  be transferred to circuit court.Â  In his order, the judge outlined in \r\n  detail the testimony of each witness as well as the substance of significant \r\n  exhibits, which included a mental competency evaluation.Â  Based on the evidence, \r\n  the judge concluded, â€œit is unlikely this Juvenile could be successfully rehabilitated \r\n  by, or within, the juvenile system, and it is in the best interests of the Juvenile \r\n  and the community to transfer jurisdiction to the Court of General Sessions.â€Â  \r\n\r\nOn January 15, 2002, an Anderson County grand jury indicted Miller for murder \r\n  and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Approximately \r\n  a week later, Miller pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and the related weapon \r\n  charge.Â  The circuit court sentenced Miller to thirty years imprisonment, suspended \r\n  upon the service of twenty years and five years probation.Â  The court \r\n  sentenced Miller to a concurrent, five-year term of imprisonment for the weapon \r\n  charge.\r\nMiller appeals the family court judgeâ€™s \r\n  order transferring jurisdiction to the circuit court.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe appellate court will affirm a transfer order unless the family \r\n  court has abused its discretion.Â  State v. Avery, 333 S.C. 284, 292, \r\n  509 S.E.2d 476, 481 (1998).Â  â€œThe term â€˜abuse of discretionâ€™ has no opprobrious \r\n  implication and may be found if the conclusions reached by the lower court are \r\n  without reasonable factual support.â€Â  State v. Corey D., 339 S.C. 107, \r\n  118, 529 S.E.2d 20, 26 (2000); Engle v. Engle, 343 S.C. 444, 449-50, \r\n  539 S.E.2d 712, 714 (Ct. App. 2000) (stating an abuse of discretion occurs when \r\n  the court is controlled by an error of law or where the order, based upon the \r\n  findings of fact, is without evidentiary support).Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMiller argues the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to accept his \r\n  guilty pleas because the family court erroneously waived jurisdiction.Â  Specifically, \r\n  Miller contends the family court judgeâ€™s factual conclusions are without evidentiary \r\n  support.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn reaching the decision to waive jurisdiction to the circuit court, \r\n  the family court judge relied on the criteria established in Kent v. United \r\n  States, 383 U.S. 541 (1966), [3] \r\n   which have been â€œimplicitly approved as appropriate criteria.â€Â  Corey \r\n  D., 339 S.C. at 118, 529 S.E.2d at 26.Â  In assessing whether the family \r\n  court judge abused his discretion, â€œwe consider the Kent factors and \r\n  emphasize that the serious nature of the offense is a major factor in the transfer \r\n  decision.â€Â  Id.\r\nAs will be discussed, we find the judge sufficiently outlined the \r\n  factual findings upon which he based his decision and those facts are supported \r\n  by the testimony and evidence presented at the transfer hearing.Â  \r\nUnder the first factor, the judge found that there was â€œno more serious \r\n  offense to the communityâ€ than murder and â€œthat if â€˜protection to the communityâ€™ \r\n  was the sole criteria, there would be no question that waiver to the Court of \r\n  General Sessions would be necessary.â€Â  In making this determination, the judge \r\n  struggled with the testimony that Miller had no history of criminal behavior \r\n  and the experts indicated that Miller could be rehabilitated within the juvenile \r\n  justice system.Â  The judge contrasted this testimony with the fact that:Â  Miller \r\n  possessed above average intelligence; he gave multiple differing accounts of \r\n  the incident; and he attempted to conceal the crime and create an alibi.\r\nMiller concedes that the offense of murder is serious.Â  There is \r\n  also evidence supporting the judgeâ€™s conclusion regarding the protection of \r\n  the community.Â  Although the psychological experts testified that Miller could \r\n  be rehabilitated, they also acknowledged that there was no guarantee that Miller \r\n  would not commit another violent crime.Â  Several of Millerâ€™s own family members \r\n  testified that they were afraid of him.Â  Jeanette and Mark Henry, Millerâ€™s paternal \r\n  aunt and uncle, with whom he stayed for approximately a year and a half preceding \r\n  the shooting, testified that Miller was forced out of their home because he \r\n  was suspended from school for bringing a knife and he wrote a note threatening \r\n  to kill their family.Â  Moreover, the record reflects that Miller did \r\n  not appear to be remorseful after shooting his father.Â  Dr. Williams specifically \r\n  testified that Miller â€œwas actually more focused on himself at the time about \r\n  his, his life.â€Â  In his statement, Miller admitted that:Â  he attempted to conceal \r\n  the shooting by cleaning the living room; he hid one of the weapons at his grandfatherâ€™s \r\n  home; and he wrote a note and left a voicemail message to explain his whereabouts.Â  \r\n  Bock also testified that Miller appeared normal after the incident.Â  Investigator \r\n  Garrett testified that Miller changed his statement several times and ultimately \r\n  admitted that his father did not sexually abuse him, which was the reason Miller \r\n  initially gave as prompting the shooting.Â Â  Â Â \r\nRegarding the second factor, the judge found the evidence established \r\n  that the â€œcrime was committed in an aggressive, violent and wilful manner; and \r\n  that premeditation cannot be excluded from the scenario or sequence of events \r\n  occurring on January 2, 2001.â€Â  The testimony of the investigating officers \r\n  and the forensic evidence supports the judgeâ€™s conclusion.Â  Dr. Woodard, the \r\n  forensic pathologist, testified that the victim had nine gunshot wounds, which \r\n  included three to the front of the body, one to the right side, three to the \r\n  back, and two to the left side of the head.Â  He further testified the pattern \r\n  of the wounds was consistent with the victim crawling on the ground while being \r\n  shot.Â  Investigator Mike Mitchell testified the crime scene evidence indicated \r\n  that the victim was lying on the floor when he was shot in the head.Â  He further \r\n  explained the evidence indicated that the shooter was â€œtrackingâ€ the victim.Â  \r\n  Dorothy Filiatreault, a SLED forensic chemist, testified the victim was shot \r\n  a few times at close range.Â  Miller also admitted, and the forensic evidence \r\n  corroborated, that he shot his father using two separate weapons.Â  Additionally, \r\n  one could infer premeditation from Millerâ€™s act of shooting the weapon through \r\n  his jacket.\r\nWith respect to the third, fourth and fifth factors, there is no \r\n  dispute that evidence supports the judgeâ€™s findings.Â  Without question, \r\n  the offense of murder was committed against a person.Â  Moreover, Miller concedes \r\n  that the evidence â€œmight sustain an indictment for murder.â€Â  Miller also \r\n  admits that the fifth factor is inapplicable to his case given there were no \r\n  co-defendants involved in the shooting.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nIn terms of the sixth factor, the judge indicated that this factor \r\n  â€œcreated the greatest dilemmaâ€ apparently because of the conflicting evidence \r\n  presented by the defense and the State.Â  The judge outlined this evidence and \r\n  ultimately concluded, â€œ[t]he sheer violence of the murder, and the Juvenileâ€™s \r\n  elaborate efforts to create an alibi and/or conceal evidence, . . . show a degree \r\n  of intellect and sophistication even beyond the age of this Juvenile.â€Â Â  \r\n\r\nAs evidenced by the judgeâ€™s order, it is clear that he considered all aspects \r\n  of Millerâ€™s life in reaching this conclusion.Â  Although, as the judge recognized, \r\n  there was evidence that Miller had a difficult home life, he was assessed as \r\n  immature for his age, and he was a loner, there was also evidence weighing in \r\n  favor of transferring jurisdiction to the circuit court.Â  Millerâ€™s allegations \r\n  of abuse were never substantiated other than for limited testimony that Millerâ€™s \r\n  father had been on occasion physically and verbally abusive and the inference \r\n  from Millerâ€™s limited stay in the custody of DSS four years prior to the incident.Â  \r\n  A physical examination of Miller after the shooting did not reveal any evidence \r\n  of sexual abuse.Â  After the examination, Miller in fact admitted that he had \r\n  lied about the sexual abuse.Â  Moreover, Miller spent time away from his father \r\n  when he lived with other relatives.Â  By all accounts, Miller had a good relationship \r\n  with his paternal grandfather and step-grandmother.Â  Millerâ€™s maternal grandmother, \r\n  Carol Click, also testified that Miller spent summers with her family.Â  Miller \r\n  also lived for approximately a year and a half with his paternal aunt and uncle, \r\n  Jeanette and Mark Henry, until they felt he was a threat to their family.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  even though Drs. Williams, Sharman, and Berg diagnosed Miller with depression \r\n  and an anxiety disorder, they found no evidence for which to classify Miller \r\n  as having a definitive anti-social disorder.Â  \r\nAs to the seventh factor, there is no evidence that Miller had any \r\n  prior criminal record or adjudicative history. \r\nConcerning the final factor, the judge found that â€œif this \r\n  Juvenile was to remain within the jurisdiction of the Family Court and be adjudicated \r\n  delinquent and sentenced as required by law, he could not be successfully \r\n  rehabilitated by any program, or by any combination of programs, presently offered \r\n  by this Stateâ€™s juvenile system.â€Â  As a result, the judge believed â€œthat after \r\n  the Juvenile completed his period of juvenile detention, there would remain \r\n  a constant risk to the community that certain stressors placed on this Juvenile, \r\n  even as he entered adulthood, might result in his sudden, violent response to, \r\n  or against, the cause of the stress.â€Â  Although there is evidence to \r\n  support the judgeâ€™s implicit finding that Miller would only serve a limited \r\n  amount of time in DJJ if tried as a juvenile, we find there is no evidence to \r\n  support his conclusion that Miller could not be successfully rehabilitated by \r\n  any program offered in the juvenile system.Â  All of the psychological experts \r\n  as well as Marlene McClain, a former member of the juvenile parole board, recognized \r\n  that if Miller were tried as a juvenile he may only spend thirty-six to forty-four \r\n  months at DJJ.Â  However, they all believed that Miller could benefit from treatment \r\n  that he would receive at DJJ.Â  Dr. Berg specifically testified that she believed \r\n  Miller was â€œamenable to rehabilitation.â€Â  Even Dr. Williams, who indicated that \r\n  Miller may be difficult to rehabilitate, ultimately concluded that â€œ[g]iven \r\n  [Millerâ€™s] level of cognitive ability, with tutoring, therapeutic support, and \r\n  a structured environment, he might perform more adequately at school and might \r\n  be able to develop vocational skills.â€Â  Therefore, we find the judge erred in \r\n  reaching his conclusion regarding the eighth Kent factor.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find there is evidence to support the family court judgeâ€™s ruling \r\n  regarding all of the Kent factors with the exception of factor eight, \r\n  which involves Millerâ€™s potential for rehabilitation within the juvenile system.Â  \r\n  Because, however, there is evidence in the record to support the family court \r\n  judgeâ€™s overall decision to waive jurisdiction over Miller to the circuit court, \r\n  we hold he did not abuse his discretion.Â  Therefore, the circuit court had jurisdiction \r\n  to accept Millerâ€™s guilty pleas.Â  Accordingly, Millerâ€™s convictions and sentences \r\n  are\r\n AFFIRMED. \r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Because oral argument would not aid the court \r\n    in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument \r\n    pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  Section 20-7-7605 provides in pertinent part:\r\n  \r\n  (5) If a child fourteen or fifteen years of age is charged with \r\n    an offense which, if committed by an adult, would be a Class A, B, C, or D \r\n    felony as defined in Section 16-1-20 or a felony which provides for a maximum \r\n    term of imprisonment of fifteen years or more, the court, after full investigation \r\n    and hearing, may determine it contrary to the best interest of the child or \r\n    of the public to retain jurisdiction.Â  The court, acting as committing magistrate, \r\n    may bind over the child for proper criminal proceedings to a court which would \r\n    have trial jurisdiction of the offenses if committed by an adult.\r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-7605(5) (Supp. 2004).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â Â  In approving these factors, our Supreme Court \r\n    has stated:Â  \r\n  \r\n  In Kent, the United States Supreme Court noted the following \r\n    criteria for determining whether jurisdiction should be waived under the District \r\n    of Columbia Juvenile Court Act:\r\n    \r\n  1. The seriousness of the alleged offense to the community and \r\n    whether the protection of the community requires waiver.Â  \r\n  2. Whether the alleged offense was committed in an aggressive, \r\n    violent, premeditated, or willful manner.Â  \r\n  3. Whether the alleged offense was against persons or against \r\n    property, greater weight being given to offenses against persons especially \r\n    if injury resulted.Â  \r\n  4. The prosecutive merit of the complaint, i.e., whether there \r\n    is evidence upon which a Grand Jury may be expected to return an indictment \r\n    . . . .\r\n  5. The desirability of trial and disposition of the entire offense \r\n    in one court when the juvenileâ€™s associates in the alleged offense are adults \r\n    who will be charged with a crime . . . .\r\n  6. The sophistication and maturity of the juvenile as determined \r\n    by consideration of his home, environmental situation, emotional attitude \r\n    and pattern of living.Â  \r\n  7. The record and previous [criminal or adjudicative] history \r\n    of the juvenile . . . .\r\n  8.Â  The prospects for adequate protection of the public \r\n    and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of the juvenile (if he is \r\n    found to have committed the alleged offense) by the use of procedures, services \r\n    and facilities currently available to the Juvenile Court.Â  \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  Corey D., 339 S.C. at 116 n.4, 529 S.E.2d at \r\n    25 n.4 (citing Kent, 383 U.S. at 566-67).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3953","title":"McCall v.

Appellant was identified in the summons and complaint \r\n  by the name under which it chose to conduct business in South Carolina, â€œIKON, \r\n  d/b/a IKON Educational Services.â€ \r\n  [1]  Like many larger companies, IKON operates through a corporate structure \r\n  that includes various subsidiaries and business units that fall under the umbrella \r\n  of a parent corporation.Â  At the top of this corporate structure is IKON Office \r\n  Solutions, Inc., which is an Ohio corporation that operates different businesses \r\n  in the technology field throughout the country.Â  Within this corporation \r\n  is IKON Office Solutionsâ€™ wholly owned subsidiary, IKON Office Solutions Technology \r\n  Services, L.L.C.Â  At the time this cause of action arose, both IKON Office Solutions, \r\n  Inc., and IKON Office Solutions Technology Services, L.L.C., were authorized \r\n  to do business in South Carolina. Â IKON Education Services, however, \r\n  was not technically registered to do business in South Carolina, although IKON \r\n  chose to conduct business in this state under that name.\r\nIKON opened a computer training center in Greenville, \r\n  South Carolina, under the name IKON Education Services.Â  IKON continued to operate \r\n  the Greenville facility until December 2001, when it decided to sell its entire \r\n  technology education unit to Computer Educational Services Corporation (CESC). \r\n\r\nCaught in the middle of this tangle of corporate identity \r\n  was Respondent Jonathan McCall.Â  Just one month before IKON sold its education \r\n  unit to CESC, McCall entered into a contract with IKON Education Services in \r\n  Greenville for a full year of computer training courses.Â  The only parties named \r\n  in the contract were McCall and IKON Education Services.Â  There was no reference \r\n  to any other IKON entity.Â  Within a few weeks of taking over the education operation, \r\n  however, CESC closed the Greenville location and cancelled the classes there. \r\n\r\nOn January 9, 2002, McCall filed the present breach \r\n  of contract action, naming as defendants â€œIKON, d/b/a IKON Educational Servicesâ€ \r\n  and CESC.Â  McCall served a copy of the summons and complaint upon CT Corporation \r\n  System, the registered agent for service of process in South Carolina for IKON.Â  \r\n  However, CT Corporation System returned the summons and complaint to McCallâ€™s \r\n  counsel one week later, advising by letter that it was not the agent for any \r\n  entity by the name ofÂ  â€œIKON Educational Services.â€Â  The letter additionally \r\n  noted that â€œCT Corporation System serves as Registered Agent for more than one \r\n  company with â€˜IKONâ€™ as part of its name.â€Â  Thereafter, McCall served Sonja Cantrell, \r\n  the Office Operational Manager for CESC and former office manager for \r\n  IKON, with the same summons and complaint. [2] Â  \r\nMcCall filed an affidavit of default in February 2002, accompanied \r\n  by two affidavits of service, one addressed to Cantrell and the other to CT \r\n  Corporation System.Â  Upon scheduling of the damages hearing, McCall mailed only \r\n  one notice of the hearing to CESCâ€™s Greenville office address which was also \r\n  the former address for IKON Education Services.Â  \r\nAt the damages hearing, at which neither of the defendants appeared, \r\n  the circuit court granted McCall a default judgment in the amount of $58,407.19 \r\n  against the defendants jointly and severally.Â Â Â  Subsequently, IKON filed a \r\n  motion for relief from judgment under Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, which was denied \r\n  because the circuit court found service upon both defendants â€œwas properly perfected \r\n  and adequate notice was given pursuant to the Code.â€ \r\n  [3] Â  The circuit court also denied IKONâ€™s motion to reconsider.Â  \r\n  This appeal followed.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â &nbsp;  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA motion to vacate or set aside a default judgment is addressed to \r\n  the sound discretion of the trial judge and will not be disturbed absent an \r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  Tri-County Ice and Fuel Co. v. Palmetto Ice Co., \r\n  303 S.C. 237, 242, 399 S.E.2d 779, 782 (1990). An abuse of discretion arises \r\n  when the trial judge was controlled by an error of law or where his order is \r\n  based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Service of Process Was ProperÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAppellant asserts that IKON Education Servicesâ€”as \r\n  â€œmerely a division of IKON Office Solutions Technology Services, LLCâ€â€”was â€œnot \r\n  a legal entity capable of being sued.â€Â  Instead, according to Appellant, â€œ[t]here \r\n  are several recognized corporations existing in South Carolina with IKON as \r\n  part of their name,â€ including IKON Office Solutions, Inc., and its subsidiary, \r\n  IKON Office Solutions Technology Services, L.L.C.Â  Appellant therefore argues \r\n  that McCallâ€™s attempts to serve his summons and complaint upon a phantom entity \r\n  named â€œIKON Educational Servicesâ€ or simply â€œIKONâ€ rather than properly naming \r\n  one of the â€œrecognizedâ€ IKON corporations â€œexisting in South Carolinaâ€ rendered \r\n  the purported service ineffective.Â  We find service was effective, and therefore \r\n  conclude the circuit court properly denied Rule 60 relief in this regard.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â  \r\nAs this issue has been framed by Appellant, its resolution \r\n  would seem to entail a technical analysis of when a corporation may be said \r\n  to â€œexistâ€ for purposes of our civil rules governing service of process.Â  Our \r\n  rules governing service of process do not turn on parsing strict technicalities \r\n  or debating murky legal abstractions.Â  On the contrary, our supreme court has \r\n  specifically held that â€œ[w]e have never required exacting compliance with the \r\n  rules to effect service of process.â€ Roche v. Young Bros. Inc., 318 S.C. \r\n  207, 209-10, 456 S.E.2d 897, 899 (1995) (citing Foster v. Crawford, 57 \r\n  S.C. 551, 36 S.E. 5 (1900); Saunders v. Bobo, 2 Bailey 492 (1831); Miller \r\n  v. Hall, 1 Speers 1 (1842)).Â  â€œRather, we inquire whether the plaintiff \r\n  has sufficiently complied with the rules such that the court has personal jurisdiction \r\n  of the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.â€ Roche, \r\n  318 S.C. at 210, 456 S.E.2d at 899.Â  To establish that service has been properly \r\n  effected, the plaintiff need only show compliance with the civil rules on service \r\n  of process. Moore v. Simpson, 322 S.C. 518, 523, 473 S.E.2d 64, 67 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1996).Â  When these rules are followed, there is a presumption of proper \r\n  service. Roche, 318 S.C. at 211, 456 S.E.2d at 900.\r\nContrary to these principles governing service of process, \r\n  IKON urges us to apply the rules in a manner that demands the strictest technical \r\n  compliance.Â  The company cleaves to the narrow view that because it is registered \r\n  to do business in our state under certain â€œlegalâ€ names, its obligation to answer \r\n  or appear in response to any civil action extends only so far as it has been \r\n  correctly and precisely identified according to the roll maintained by the Secretary \r\n  of State.Â  In this case, IKON would paint itself as a hapless victim of mistaken \r\n  identity, going about its business and never imagining that anyone would attempt \r\n  to sue them under a name that is not officially or legally â€œrecognizedâ€ as a \r\n  corporation that â€œexistsâ€ in South Carolina.Â  Â \r\nIndeed, our courts have rejected similar attempts by parties to avoid service \r\n  of process by seeking refuge under a highly technical interpretation of the \r\n  rules:\r\n\r\nA suit at law is not a childrenâ€™s game, but a serious effort \r\n  on the part of adult human beings to administer justice; and the purpose of \r\n  process is to bring parties into court. If it names them in such terms that \r\n  every intelligent person understands who is meant, as is the case here, it has \r\n  fulfilled its purpose; and courts should not put themselves in the position \r\n  of failing to recognize what is apparent to everyone else.\r\n\r\nGriffin v. Capital Cash, 310 S.C. 288, 292, 423 S.E.2d 143, 146 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1992).Â  It has long been recognized that a corporation may be known by \r\n  several names in the transaction of its general business. See Long \r\n  v. Carolina Banking Co., 193 S.C. 225, 239, 8 S.E.2d 326, 332 (1939).Â Â  \r\n  â€œIf a corporation has acquired a name by usage, an adjudication against it by \r\n  the name so acquired is valid and binding.â€Â  Id.Â  â€œIf [a corporation] \r\n  is sued in a name under which it transacts business, the process will ordinarily \r\n  be sufficient to bring it before the court.â€Â  Griffin, 310 S.C. at 292, \r\n  423 S.E.2d at 146.Â  â€œThe misnomer of a corporation in a notice, summons, or \r\n  other step in a judicial proceeding is immaterial if it appears the corporation \r\n  could not have been, or was not, misled.â€Â  Id.Â  Furthermore, use of a \r\n  trade name will not invalidate the judgment if the misnomer does not cause the \r\n  corporation prejudice.Â  Long, 193 S.C. at 239, 8 S.E.2d at 332.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWe find IKON was neither misled nor otherwise prejudiced by the use of the \r\n  name â€œIKON, d/b/a IKON Educational Servicesâ€ in the summons and complaint.Â  \r\n  The confusion here was created solely by IKON, for it chose the name under which \r\n  it would conduct business in this state.Â Â  The record unmistakably reveals that \r\n  IKON Education Services (or IKON Educational Services) was the name IKON used \r\n  in connection with its computer training courses offered in South Carolina.Â  \r\n  McCall signed a customer agreement entitled â€œIKON Education Services Public \r\n  Class Enterprise Training Pass.â€Â  The name â€œIKON Education Servicesâ€ \r\n  is mentioned no less than five times in the partiesâ€™ contract, including the \r\n  signature line which indicated the terms of the agreement were â€œAccepted by: \r\n  IKON Education Services.â€ Â In this contract, drafted entirely by IKON, no other \r\n  IKON entities are named.Â  \r\nIKON seeks refuge in promotional literature provided to McCall and other potential \r\n  purchasers of its educational services.Â  We acknowledge that this pamphlet does \r\n  contain a reference to IKONâ€™s corporate parent, but it does so obscurely in \r\n  a footnote in miniscule print.Â  To give the reader a sense of this disclosure, \r\n  as best as we can reproduce, at the bottom of the third page of this eight page \r\n  document, the following appears: Â IKON Education Services is a business unit \r\n  of IKON Office Solutions Technology Services, LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary \r\n  of IKON Office Solutions, Inc.Â  Conversely, the booklet prominently and consistently \r\n  refers to the company under the banner logo â€œIKONâ€ and â€œIKON Education Servicesâ€â€”the \r\n  very entity that entered into the contract with McCall.Â  Additionally, these \r\n  materials refer the reader to â€œwww.ikoneducation.comâ€ for further information.Â  \r\n  We find that this obscure and barely legible reference in the promotional literature \r\n  to IKONâ€™s parent does not aid its efforts to escape default.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBecause IKON prominently held itself out as IKON Education Services, it would \r\n  be wholly inequitable to find McCallâ€™s attempts to serve the company under that \r\n  name ineffective.Â  The fact that IKONâ€™s registered agent for service of process, \r\n  CT Corporation, did not recognize IKONâ€™s chosen business unitâ€”IKON Education \r\n  Servicesâ€”is a result of IKONâ€™s own neglect.Â  IKON selected the name under which \r\n  it would conduct business and enter into contracts in this state.Â  IKON now \r\n  looks to us to extricate it from this morass, but we are not inclined to reward \r\n  IKON for its own neglect.Â  We therefore find McCall effectively served IKON \r\n  with his summons and complaint through the companyâ€™s registered agent, CT Corporation \r\n  System.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nII.Â  Inadequate Notice of Damages Hearing\r\nWe turn next to IKONâ€™s claim that it did not receive \r\n  adequate notice of the hearing on damages as mandated by Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP.&nbsp; \r\n\r\nIn the present case, McCall attempted to provide \r\n  notice of the damages hearing to IKON by way of a single letter addressed jointly \r\n  to â€œIKON d/b/a IKON Educational Services and C.E.S.C. (Computer Educational \r\n  Services Corporation).â€Â  This letter was mailed to 1001 Keys Drive in Greenville, \r\n  IKON Education Servicesâ€™ former office location that was taken over by CESC \r\n  following its purchase of the IKON education business in December 2001.Â  IKON \r\n  argues the mailing of one letter addressed to both defendants was not adequate \r\n  to satisfy the notice requirements of Rule 55(b)(2).Â  We agree.\r\nUnder Rule 55(b)(2), SCRCP, â€œ[p]ursuant to Rule 5(a), notice \r\n  of any trial or hearing on unliquidated damages shall also be given to parties \r\n  in default by first class mail to the last known address of such party whether \r\n  or not such party has appeared in the action.â€Â  The service requirements of \r\n  Rule 5(a), SCRCP, incorporated into Rule 55(b)(2) mandate that â€œ[e]very order \r\n  required by its terms to be served, every pleading subsequent to the original \r\n  summons and complaint . . . every written notice, appearance, demand, \r\n  offer of judgment, designation of record or case and exceptions on appeal, and \r\n  similar papers shall be served upon each of the parties . . .â€Â  (emphasis \r\n  added).Â  The plain language of the rule therefore requires that each \r\n  party shall be served separately.Â  Mailing one letter addressed to both IKON \r\n  and CESC, therefore, was not sufficient to comply with Rule 55(b)(2) and Rule \r\n  5(a).\r\nThe need to properly serve each party individually does not \r\n  arise from an arcane or highly technical application of the rules.Â  Rather, \r\n  this requirement serves an essential functionâ€”ensuring that notice is properly \r\n  received by all entitled to it.Â  Addressing a single notice to two distinct \r\n  parties as McCall did in the present case, sharply diminishes the likelihood \r\n  that both will actually receive notice, as such a method necessarily depends \r\n  upon one of the parties â€œpassing alongâ€ the notification to the other.Â  The \r\n  rules of service are designed to eliminate the need for such contingencies.\r\nFinding notification was insufficient, therefore, we vacate \r\n  the award of damages and remand this matter to the circuit court for a new damages \r\n  hearing upon proper notice to IKON.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFinding proper service of the summons and complaint \r\n  upon IKON by delivery to its registered agent, we affirm the circuit court ruling \r\n  denying IKON relief from default.Â  However, we find that McCall failed to properly \r\n  notify IKON of the subsequent damages hearing, so we therefore vacate the award \r\n  of damages and remand this matter to the circuit court for a new hearing on \r\n  damages.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nHUFF and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  IKON conducted business as it relates to this \r\n    action under the name â€œIKON Educational Servicesâ€ or â€œIKON Education Services.â€Â  \r\n    In an attempt to bring some clarity to this admittedly confusing situation, \r\n    when the IKON name will not suffice, we will generally reference IKON Education \r\n    Servicesâ€”the name that appears most frequently in the record and the only \r\n    IKON name appearing in the underlying contract.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Cantrell testified that she immediately notified \r\n    her supervisors at the CESC corporate office in Florida that she had received \r\n    the summons and complaint, though neither supervisor claims knowledge of the \r\n    service.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The court also denied CESCâ€™s motion to set \r\n    aside default judgment.Â  CESC did not appeal this ruling.

Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company, 361 S.C. \r\n  196, 603 S.E.2d 861 (Ct. App. 2004), cert. pending, this court recently \r\n  addressed the proper interpretation of section 38-77-160 in relation to UIM \r\n  coverage. [2] Â  Section 38-77-160 provides in \r\n  relevant part: â€œIf, however, an insured or named insured is protected by uninsured \r\n  or underinsured motorist coverage in excess of the basic limits, the policy \r\n  shall provide that the insured or named insured is protected only to the extent \r\n  of the coverage he has on the vehicle involved in the accident.â€Â  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 38-77-160 (2002). \r\nBurgess was involved in an accident while operating his motorcycle.Â  He collected \r\n  liability benefits from the at-fault driver.Â  Id. at 199, 603 S.E.2d \r\n  at 863.Â  Although he did not have UIM coverage on the motorcycle involved in \r\n  the accident, he owned three other vehicles covered by a Nationwide policy that \r\n  provided UIM coverage of $25,000.Â  The policy contained the exact provision \r\n  at issue in the instant case, which states, in pertinent part:Â  â€œ[t]he amount \r\n  of coverage applicable under this policy shall be the lesser of the coverage \r\n  limits under this policy or the coverage limits on the vehicle involved in the \r\n  accident.â€ Id.Â  Burgess demanded payment from Nationwide.Â  Nationwide \r\n  refused to pay Burgess, arguing that Burgess had not purchased UIM coverage \r\n  for the motorcycle, and the policy provision precluded coverage.Â  Id.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nBurgess afforded this court the opportunity to decide the novel issue \r\n  of whether section 38-77-160 permits an insured who purchases UIM benefits under \r\n  a policy covering vehicles which are not involved in the accident to recover \r\n  basic UIM benefits under those policies.Â  Burgess, 361 S.C. at 202, 603 \r\n  S.E.2d at 865.Â  In Burgess, we noted that our supreme court has addressed \r\n  the public policy reasons for affording UM coverage to insured individuals in \r\n  the following passage: \r\n\r\nâ€œ[U]ninsured motorist coverage is not to provide coverage for the uninsured \r\n  vehicle but to afford additional protection to the insured.â€ Nationwide Mut. \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Howard, 288 S.C. 5, 12, 339 S.E.2d 501, 504 (citing Hogan \r\n  v. Home Ins. Co., 260 S.C. 157, 162, 194 S.E.2d 890, 892 (1973)). \r\n  The court further clarified in Hogan that â€œunlike the provisions relative \r\n  to liability coverage, the statute plainly affords uninsured motorist coverage \r\n  to the named insured and resident relatives of his or her household at all times \r\n  and without regard to the activity in which they were engaged at the time. Such \r\n  coverage is nowhere limited in the statute to the use of the insured vehicle.â€ \r\n  Hogan, 260 S.C. at 162, 194 S.E.2d at 892.\r\n\r\nId. at 201-02, \r\n  603 S.E.2d at 864.Â  Because UIM coverage is a variation of UM coverage, we found \r\n  the legislative intent behind UM coverage was applicable to UIM coverage.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we held that section 38-77-160 does not allow the exclusion or restriction of \r\n  basic UIM coverage, and UIM coverage is personal and portable.Â  Id. at \r\n  202, 603 S.E.2d at 865.Â  In other words, â€œwhere the coverage follows the person \r\n  any person who enjoys the status of an insured under a motor vehicle policy \r\n  of insurance which includes uninsured/underinsured coverage enjoys coverage \r\n  protection simply by reason of having been injured by an uninsured/underinsured \r\n  motorist.â€Â  Id. at 202, 603 S.E.2d at 865 (citing 9 Lee R. Russ &amp; \r\n  Thomas F. Segalla, Couch on Insurance Â§ 123:3 (3d ed. 2004)).Â  \r\nGiven section 38-77-160 applies to both UM and UIM coverage, and the legislative \r\n  intent applies to both types of coverage, we find UM coverage is personal and \r\n  portable and basic UM coverage cannot be excluded or restricted.Â  Therefore, \r\n  Erwood, as an insured, is entitled to receive UM benefits in the basic limits \r\n  from the NationwideÂ  policy she maintained on the non-involved automobile.\r\nB.\r\nErwood next \r\n  argues the circuit court erred in finding that Nationwideâ€™s policy endorsement \r\n  precluded her claim for UM benefits.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn Burgess, we held the policy provision limiting UIM coverage to the \r\n  lesser of the coverage limits under the policy or the coverage limits on the \r\n  vehicle involved in the accident exceeds the limitations allowed by section \r\n  38-77-160 and is therefore inconsistent with public policy and void.Â  Burgess, \r\n  361 S.C. at 206, 603 S.E.2d at 867.Â  The policy provision at issue here contains \r\n  the exact language as the endorsement discussed in Burgess.Â  In view \r\n  of our finding that UM coverage, like UIM coverage, follows the person and not \r\n  the vehicle, we conclude the policy provision is void and without effect.Â  Thus, \r\n  Erwood is not precluded from receiving UM benefits by the policy provision in \r\n  the insurance contract. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court erred when it found Erwood was not entitled to recover UM \r\n  benefits under the policy she maintained on the non-involved vehicle.Â  Because \r\n  we find UM coverage is both personal and portable, and because Nationwideâ€™s \r\n  policy provision is more restrictive than section 38-77-160, the order of the \r\n  circuit court is \r\nREVERSED. \r\nHUFF and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â Â  Because oral argument would not aid the court \r\n    in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument \r\n    pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â Â  We note the circuit court judge did not have \r\n    the benefit of this opinion at the time he issued his decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
