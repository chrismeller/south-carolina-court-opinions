Lawson, of Lawson &amp; Gwin, of Myrtle \r\n          Beach, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCURETON, J.:  \r\nSouth Carolina Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Company (Farm Bureau) filed this declaratory \r\njudgment action against Calvin Lee Wilson, Mark Walton Davis, and Carl King, seeking \r\na determination of the parties' rights under a commercial automobile policy issued \r\nby Farm Bureau to Carl King. The master-in-equity found the policy did not provide \r\nKing coverage because the utility trailer pulled by his truck had a weight capacity \r\nof over 5,000 pounds. King appeals. We affirm. \r\n\r\n    Facts \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKing is in the business of installing mobile homes. Farm \r\n  Bureau issued a commercial policy to King insuring his 1988 Ford utility vehicle. \r\n  King's employee was operating the vehicle while towing a utility trailer when \r\n  the trailer disengaged, crossed the center line, and struck the vehicles occupied \r\n  by Wilson and Davis.\r\n\r\nMark Gore, Farm Bureau's adjuster, investigated the accident. \r\n  Gore testified King told him the capacity of the trailer was 10,000 pounds. \r\n  Gore also stated King admitted the trailer was carrying approximately two hundred \r\n  cement blocks at the time of the accident. The blocks, used to set up mobile \r\n  homes, weigh approximately 30 pounds each.\r\n\r\nRobert Taylor, a mechanical engineer and accident reconstructionist, \r\n  described the trailer as \"in between homemade and factory made.\" Thus, the trailer \r\n  had no manufacturer's capacity nameplate. The trailer was constructed with a \r\n  steel plate on the floor and sides. The bed was approximately six foot by ten \r\n  foot, with eighteen inch sides. The trailer had two axles of a type used to \r\n  transport mobile homes, and four tires, each with a maximum load capacity of \r\n  2,270 pounds. Taylor testified the trailer had a capacity of 6,500 to 7,500 \r\n  pounds.\r\n\r\nDonald Poston, a self-employed welder, testified he manufactured \r\n  the trailer. He had built between thirty and forty trailers, of which approximately \r\n  fifteen or twenty were utility trailers. Poston testified the capacity of the \r\n  trailer is limited by the tongue. The tongue on this trailer was ten-feet long, \r\n  five of which extended beyond the trailer. Poston testified the trailer had \r\n  a capacity of approximately 4,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe master concluded, inter alia, King was not covered by \r\n  the commercial automobile policy because the policy limited liability coverage \r\n  to utility trailers with a capacity of 5,000 pounds or less and King's utility \r\n  trailer had a capacity in excess of 5,000 pounds. \r\n\r\n\r\n    Standard of Review \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nA declaratory judgment action is neither legal nor equitable, \r\n  but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue. Felts v. Richland \r\n  County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991). An action to determine coverage \r\n  under an insurance policy is an action at law. See Travelers Indem. Co. v. \r\n  Auto World, Inc., 334 S.C. 137, 511 S.E.2d 692 (Ct. App. 1999) (noting that \r\n  an action to determine coverage under an automobile insurance policy is an action \r\n  at law). In an action at law tried without a jury, the trial court's findings \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless the findings are found to be without \r\n  evidence reasonably supporting them. Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, \r\n  266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Law/Analysis \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKing argues the master erred in concluding the auto policy \r\n  excluded liability coverage. We disagree. \r\n\r\nPart I of the policy describes liability coverage stating: \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n    I.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  We will:\r\n\r\n  1. pay for bodily injury and property \r\n    damage you or any covered persons are legally obligated \r\n    to pay caused by an accident arising out of the ownership, maintenance or \r\n    use of your auto.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe policy continues with a section defining supplementary \r\n  payments and coverage extensions. The coverage extensions section first describes \r\n  the coverage for \"Use of Other Autos.\" It next describes liability coverage \r\n  for \"Use of Trailers.\" The master relied on this language in finding King not \r\n  entitled to coverage: \r\n\r\n\r\n    USE OF TRAILERS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Bodily Injury  and Property Damage \r\n    Liability Coverage applies to your use of:\r\n\r\n  1. any utility trailer with a capacity \r\n    of 5,000 pounds or less;\r\n    2. any farm trailer with a capacity of 25,000 pounds or less; \r\n    or\r\n    3. any other trailer not owned or leased by you.\r\n\r\n  Bodily Injury  and Property Damage \r\n    Liability Coverage applies to any other owned or leased trailers \r\n    only when listed on the Declarations or subsequent endorsements \r\n    and the premium charge is paid . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nKing argues because the policy does not specifically exclude \r\n  utility trailers with a capacity of more than 5,000 pounds, the master erred \r\n  in reading the exclusion into the policy. Insurance policies are subject to \r\n  general rules of contract construction. Fritz-Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick v. Goforth, \r\n  312 S.C. 315, 440 S.E.2d 367 (1994). This court must enforce, not write, contracts \r\n  of insurance and we must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular \r\n  meaning. Id. An insurer's obligation under a policy of insurance is defined \r\n  by the terms of the policy itself and cannot be enlarged by judicial construction. \r\n  South Carolina Ins. Co. v. White, 301 S.C. 133, 390 S.E.2d 471 (Ct. App. \r\n  1990).\r\n\r\nIt is true that a policy clause extending coverage has to \r\n  be liberally construed in favor of coverage. Torrington Co. v. Aetna Cas. \r\n  and Sur. Co., 264 S.C. 636, 216 S.E.2d 547 (1975). However, if the intention \r\n  of the parties is clear, courts have no authority to torture the meaning of \r\n  policy language to extend coverage that was never intended by the parties. Sphere \r\n  Drake Ins. Co. v. Litchfield, 313 S.C. 471, 438 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1993). \r\n  The fact that the exclusions section of the policy does not specifically include \r\n  a statement excluding utility trailers with a capacity of more than 5,000 pounds \r\n  does not defeat the limitation on covered utility trailers. The clause extending \r\n  coverage to \"any utility trailer with a capacity of 5,000 pounds or less\" is \r\n  not ambiguous. We find the master correctly interpreted the clause as excluding \r\n  coverage of utility trailers with a capacity of more than 5,000 pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nKing also argues that despite the clause limiting coverage \r\n  to utility trailers, the liability portion of the policy provides coverage to \r\n  all trailers under the definitions in the policy. We disagree. \r\n\r\nThe policy provides the following definitions:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      4.\r\n      Auto(s)  means a self-propelled \r\n        motor vehicle, designed primarily to be used on public \r\n        roads and required to be registered under the South Carolina Motor Vehicle \r\n        Registration and Licensing Act.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      8.\r\n      Motor vehicle  means \r\n        a self-propelled vehicle or trailer designed for use \r\n        on public roads.\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      15.\r\n      Trailer(s) means a vehicle designed to be pulled by an\r\n        auto.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nKing argues the term \"auto\" includes a trailer designed \r\n  for use on public roads. Thus, as King's trailer is clearly designed for use \r\n  on public roads, it is entitled to coverage as an \"auto.\" Farm Bureau concedes \r\n  that a \"trailer designed for use on public roads\" is defined as a \"motor vehicle.\" \r\n  However, not all \"motor vehicles\" are \"autos.\" Only \"self-propelled motor vehicles\" \r\n  are \"autos\" under the policy definitions, and \"trailers\" are independently defined \r\n  as vehicles designed to be pulled by an \"auto.\"\r\n\r\nThe language employed in an insurance contract is to be \r\n  understood in its plain, ordinary, and popular sense. Carroway v. Johnson, \r\n  245 S.C. 200, 139 S.E.2d 908 (1965). Courts will not torture the meaning of \r\n  a policy to extend coverage not agreed to by the parties. General Ins. Co. \r\n  v. Palmetto Bank, 268 S.C. 355, 233 S.E.2d 699 (1977). Under a normal reading \r\n  of the policy language, we conclude a utility trailer is not defined as an \"auto\" \r\n  under the policy definitions.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, King argues even if the policy excludes coverage \r\n  to utility trailers with a capacity over 5,000 pounds, the master erred in finding \r\n  his trailer had a capacity of over 5,000 pounds. We disagree. \r\n\r\nPursuant to our standard of review, we may reverse the master's \r\n  factual findings only if they are found to be without evidence reasonably supporting \r\n  them. See Townes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1976). There was conflicting testimony regarding the capacity of \r\n  the trailer ranging from 4,000 to 10,000 pounds. We find there is evidence to \r\n  support the master's conclusion that the trailer had a capacity greater than \r\n  5,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3312","title":"Oliver v.

Oliver filed this contempt action against his ex-wife, Peggy H. Eaddy, \r\n  alleging she violated the terms of a family court visitation order. The family \r\n  court found no evidence of a willful violation and declined to hold Eaddy in \r\n  contempt. Oliver appeals. We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n    FACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOliver and Eaddy married in 1970. On November 21, \r\n  1995, the family court granted a divorce on the ground of one year's continuous \r\n  separation. The final decree gave Eaddy sole custody of the parties' minor son \r\n  Fred, then eleven years old, and awarded Oliver visitation on alternating weekends \r\n  and part of the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays. The order further provided \r\n  visitation as agreed upon for other holidays and extended summer visitation; \r\n  if unable to agree, either party could move the court to decide the issue. Neither \r\n  party appealed this order. \r\n\r\nIn June 1997 Eaddy remarried and relocated to Myrtle \r\n  Beach. Following the move, Eaddy and Oliver agreed to share transportation responsibility \r\n  to facilitate visitation. On June 25 Oliver's attorney wrote Eaddy requesting \r\n  a two-week visitation with Fred during the summer months. The letter encouraged \r\n  Eaddy to negotiate the matter to avoid a court hearing. According to Oliver, \r\n  Eaddy replied in a letter dated June 29, 1997. Therein, Eaddy stated she had \r\n  discussed the matter with their son, but that Fred did not want to stay with \r\n  his father for a two-week period. As a result, no extended visitation occurred \r\n  during the summer of 1997. \r\n\r\nIn April 1998 Oliver's counsel wrote to Eaddy expressing \r\n  his belief that the 1997 visitation problems had been resolved and reaffirming \r\n  Oliver's desire to reach an agreement regarding his alternating weekend and \r\n  1998 summer visitation with Fred. Eaddy refused to cooperate, and Oliver filed \r\n  an ex parte motion on September 15, 1998 seeking an order and rule to show cause \r\n  why Eaddy should not be held in contempt for failure to comply with the visitation \r\n  provisions of the family court's prior order. \r\n\r\nAfter an unsuccessful mediation attempt, the family \r\n  court held a hearing in June 1999. By order filed August 17, 1999, the court \r\n  declined to find Eaddy in contempt and dismissed the rule. The court also found \r\n  Eaddy was entitled to attorney's fees, but did not require Oliver to pay them \r\n  due to his precarious physical and financial health. This appeal followed. \r\n\r\n\r\n    STANDARD OF REVIEW  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nIn appeals from the family court, this Court has \r\n  the \"authority to find facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance \r\n  of evidence.\" Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 546, 466 S.E.2d 373, 375 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1996). Although a determination of contempt is within the trial court's \r\n  discretion, an order refusing to hold a party in contempt \"should be reversed \r\n  when the holding is based on a finding that is without evidentiary support or \r\n  when there is . . . an abuse of discretion.\" Means v. Means, 277 S.C. \r\n  428, 431, 288 S.E.2d 811, 812-13 (1982).\r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Failure to Find Eaddy in Contempt  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOliver first argues the family court erred in failing \r\n  to find Eaddy in contempt of the prior order regarding visitation. We agree. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\"An adult who wilfully violates, neglects, or refuses \r\n  to obey or perform a lawful order of the court . . . may be proceeded against \r\n  for contempt of court.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1350 (Supp. 2000). For purposes \r\n  of contempt, \"[a]n act is willful if 'done voluntarily and intentionally with \r\n  the specific intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent \r\n  to fail to do something the law requires to be done; that is to say, with bad \r\n  purpose either to disobey or disregard the law.'\" Wilson v. Walker, 340 \r\n  S.C. 531, 538, 532 S.E.2d 19, 22 (Ct. App. 2000) (quoting Spartanburg County \r\n  Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 \r\n  (1988)).\r\n\r\nBefore a party may be held in contempt \"the record \r\n  must clearly and specifically reflect the contemptuous conduct.\" Henderson \r\n  v. Henderson, 298 S.C. 190, 197, 379 S.E.2d 125, 129 (1989). Once the movant \r\n  makes a prima facie showing by pleading an order and demonstrating noncompliance, \r\n  \"the burden shifts to the respondent to establish his defense and inability \r\n  to comply.\" Id.; see also Lindsay v. Lindsay, 328 S.C. \r\n  329, 338, 491 S.E.2d 583, 588 (Ct. App. 1997) (&quot;[T]he moving party must \r\n  show the existence of a court order and the facts establishing the respondent's \r\n  noncompliance with the order.\").\r\n\r\nOliver contends he made a prima facie case for \r\n  contempt by producing the order and testifying as to Eaddy's noncompliance, \r\n  and claims the burden then shifted to Eaddy to provide a defense or explanation \r\n  for noncompliance. He specifically asserts Eaddy did not meet this burden because \r\n  she failed to testify or present any evidence in response. We agree. \r\n\r\nIn support of his motion, Oliver testified to ongoing \r\n  problems with Eaddy in arranging visitation, and stated there had been periods \r\n  of several months when he did not see his son. He related that plans were made \r\n  for Fred without his knowledge and that Fred went on other social outings instead \r\n  of coming to visit him as provided in the order. Oliver enumerated his continuing \r\n  problems scheduling visits, in particular Eaddy's refusal to cooperate or keep \r\n  him informed about Fred. Oliver further testified that he had tried several \r\n  times to discuss his lack of visitation with Eaddy; he claimed Eaddy responded \r\n  by telling him Fred did not want to see him, hanging up the phone, and refusing \r\n  to answer letters from his attorney. \r\n\r\nIn particular, Oliver asserted there were several \r\n  weekends in 1998 when Fred did not come for his regular weekend visitation, \r\n  including spring break, Easter, April 15-17, April 24-26, May 8-10, and May \r\n  22-24. Although Oliver admitted the problems with visitation initially were \r\n  better after the mediation, he stated they worsened again when Eaddy gave Fred \r\n  a pick-up truck in the spring of 1999. According to Oliver, he has not seen \r\n  his son since. \r\n\r\nWe agree with Oliver that this evidence constituted \r\n  a prima facie showing of contempt. Indeed, the family court stated that \"it \r\n  is undisputed perhaps that [Oliver] hasn't had visitation according to the order.\" \r\n  Thus, upon presentation of his case, the burden shifted to Eaddy to produce \r\n  at least some evidence tending to establish a defense or explanation for failing \r\n  to comply with the family court order. Because Eaddy chose to produce no \r\n  evidence, including her own testimony, we find she did not meet this burden. \r\n  As a result, the family court abused its discretion in refusing to hold her \r\n  in contempt. We therefore remand the case to the family court for a determination \r\n  on the propriety of appropriate sanctions. See Lindsay, 328 S.C. \r\n  at 338, 491 S.E.2d at 588 (\"Even though a party is found to have violated a \r\n  court order, the question of whether or not to impose sanctions remains a matter \r\n  for the court's discretion.\"); Sutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 409, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d 884, 888-89 (Ct. App. 1987) (\"Although the Family Court is empowered \r\n  to find and punish for contempt, there is no requirement that sanctions be imposed \r\n  upon a finding of contempt.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Failure to Order Future Compliance \r\n     \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOliver next contends the family court erred in \r\n  failing to direct Eaddy to comply prospectively with the court's prior order \r\n  on visitation. The record reflects Oliver first raised this issue in a motion \r\n  to alter or amend the judgment; it is therefore not preserved for our review. \r\n  See Patterson v. Reid, 318 S.C. 183, 185, 456 S.E.2d 436, 437 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995) (\"A party cannot for the first time raise an issue by way of \r\n  a Rule 59(e) motion which could have been raised at trial.\"). Moreover, although \r\n  the family court denied the post-trial motion, the court's order stated: \"Even \r\n  though it is not incumbent upon the Court to remind parties to abide by existing \r\n  court orders, both parties are admonished to uphold all prior orders as specifically \r\n  set forth therein.\" In our view this issue is meritless, as the parties were, \r\n  in fact, admonished to obey all prior orders.\r\n\r\nIII. Attorney's Fees and \r\n  Costs\r\n\r\nFinally, Oliver argues the family court erred in \r\n  failing to award him attorney's fees and costs. In light of our decision to \r\n  reverse the family court's finding on contempt, we similarly reverse the award \r\n  of attorney's fees to Eaddy and remand the issue for reconsideration along with \r\n  the determination on sanctions. See Sexton v.

We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nWillie Wilson (\"the father\") and Laquitta Wilson \r\n  (\"the mother\") are the parents of Willie Jerome Wilson, III, born June 11, 1991; \r\n  Christopher Elmansion Wilson, born December 29, 1992; and Wilshawn Shyheim Wilson, \r\n  born August 30, 1994. The father was convicted of distribution of cocaine in \r\n  1995 and sentenced to sixteen years imprisonment. He has been incarcerated continuously \r\n  since 1995 and is scheduled for release on November 16, 2001. \r\n\r\nTwo years after the father was incarcerated, all \r\n  three children were placed into emergency protective custody with the South \r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services (\"SCDSS\") as a result of physical neglect \r\n  by the mother. The family court thereafter reviewed this case every six months, \r\n  and the father was present at these review hearings. Although he requested an \r\n  opportunity to visit with his children after each review, SCDSS did not permit \r\n  visitation between the father and his children. Thus, the father has not seen \r\n  his children in three years. During a review held on December 18, 1997, the \r\n  family court ordered the father to pay child support \"as able\" through the Richland \r\n  County Family Court.\r\n\r\nOn January 29, 1998, SCDSS filed this action for \r\n  termination of parental rights against the mother, the father, and John Doe. \r\n  SCDSS alleged the father's parental rights should be terminated because he failed \r\n  to visit and support the children for a six-month period immediately preceding \r\n  the commencement of the action. \r\n\r\nOn April 11, 1999, the family court ordered the \r\n  termination of the parental rights of all the parties for failure to visit and \r\n  for failure to support the children. The father appeals this termination. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nIn a termination of parental rights case, the appellate \r\n  court has jurisdiction to review the entire record to determine the facts in \r\n  accordance with its view of the evidence. Richland County Dep't of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Earles, 330 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998). This Court may review the \r\n  record and make its own findings as to whether clear and convincing evidence \r\n  supports termination. South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Broome, \r\n  307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the father asserts the family court \r\n  erred in terminating his parental rights for failure to support or visit his \r\n  children. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe termination of parental rights is governed \r\n  by statute. Code section 20-7-1572 provides for termination of parental rights \r\n  where one or more of the following grounds are present:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (3) The child has lived outside the home of either \r\n    parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully \r\n    failed to visit the child. The court may attach little or no weight to incidental \r\n    visitations, but it must be shown that the parent was not prevented from \r\n    visiting by the party having custody or by court order. The distance \r\n    of the child's placement from the parent's home must be taken into consideration \r\n    when determining the ability to visit;\r\n\r\n  (4) The child has lived outside the home of either \r\n    parent for a period of six months, and during that time the parent has wilfully \r\n    failed to support the child. Failure to support means that the parent has \r\n    failed to make a material contribution to the child's care. A material contribution \r\n    consists of either financial contributions according to the parent's means \r\n    or contributions of food, clothing, shelter, or other necessities for the \r\n    care of the child according to the parent's means. The court may consider \r\n    all relevant circumstances in determining whether or not the parent has wilfully \r\n    failed to support the child, including requests for support by the custodian \r\n    and the ability of the parent to provide support.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 2000) (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\n\r\nWhether a parent's failure to visit or support \r\n  a child is wilful is a question of intent to be determined by the facts and \r\n  circumstances of each case. Broome, 307 S.C. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838. \r\n  Our supreme court has defined wilfulness as \"[c]onduct of the parent which evinces \r\n  a settled purpose to forego parental duties . . . because it manifests a conscious \r\n  indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from \r\n  the parent.\" Id. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839. Generally, the family court \r\n  is given wide discretion in making this determination. However, the element \r\n  of wilfulness must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Id. \r\n  at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838.\r\n\r\nAssuming that one or both of these requirements \r\n  enumerated within section 20-7-1572 have been met, the family court must also \r\n  make a finding that the termination of parental rights is in the best interest \r\n  of the child. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (\"The family court may order the termination \r\n  of parental rights upon a finding of one or more of the following grounds and \r\n  a finding that termination is in the best interest of the child . . . .\"). Our \r\n  supreme court recently emphasized that the courts of this state have for many \r\n  years decided \"all matters involving the custody or care of children in 'light \r\n  of the fundamental principle that the controlling consideration is the best \r\n  interests of the child.'\" Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 295, 513 \r\n  S.E.2d 358, 366 (1999) (quoting In Re Doran, 129 S.C. 26, 31, 123 S.E. \r\n  501, 503 (1924)). As the court noted, the Legislature has placed an increasing \r\n  emphasis on the best interests of the child in abuse and neglect cases as well. \r\n  Id. Furthermore, \"[t]he public policy of this state in child custody \r\n  matters is to reunite parents and children.\" Id. at 296, 513 S.E.2d at \r\n  366. \"When reunification is not possible or appropriate and a party moves to \r\n  terminate the parents' rights, that party must prove a ground for termination \r\n  of parental rights by clear and convincing evidence.\" Id.\r\n\r\nCiting Hamby v. Hamby, 264 S.C. 614, 216 \r\n  S.E.2d 536 (1975), SCDSS argues that the father's voluntary pursuit of lawless \r\n  conduct, resulting in his incarceration, is a sufficient basis for termination \r\n  because the criminal conduct was wilful and naturally leads to the inability \r\n  to visit or support the child during the term of incarceration. Therefore, the \r\n  failure to visit or support the child is, itself, wilful. We disagree with this \r\n  interpretation of section 20-7-1572 and Hamby.\r\n\r\nIn Hamby, our supreme court affirmed the \r\n  family court's findings of abandonment. 264 S.C. at 614, 216 S.E.2d at 536. \r\n  While the Hamby court did recognize that the father had \"voluntarily \r\n  pursued a course of lawlessness which resulted in his imprisonment and inability \r\n  to perform his parental duties,\" the court also examined the parent-child relationship \r\n  and lack of contact not only during the father's incarceration, but also during \r\n  the period before his incarceration and during the father's short intervening \r\n  periods of freedom. Id. at 618, 216 S.E.2d at 538. The basis of the court's \r\n  conclusion that the father had displayed a settled purpose to forego his parental \r\n  duties was not confined to the voluntary nature of the criminal act and its \r\n  natural consequences. The court's analysis included consideration of all of \r\n  the surrounding circumstances reflected in the record, including the nature \r\n  of the parent-child relationship during times when the father was not incarcerated. \r\n  Id. at 618-19, 216 S.E.2d at 538-39; see also Dep't of Soc. \r\n  Servs. v. Henry, 296 S.C. 507, 509, 374 S.E.2d 298, 299-300 (1988) (finding \r\n  \"voluntary pursuit of a course of lawlessness resulting in imprisonment, coupled \r\n  with flagrant indifference towards the children during intervening periods of \r\n  freedom, manifest[ed] abandonment of the [children]\").\r\n\r\nThe father argues that the family court erred in \r\n  terminating his parental rights for wilful failure to visit the children for \r\n  a period of six months. We agree.\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1572(3) specifically provides that \r\n  in order for parental rights to be terminated for failure to visit \"it must \r\n  be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having \r\n  custody.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3) (Supp. 2000). In this case, the family \r\n  court concluded that SCDSS prevented the father from visiting the children based \r\n  solely upon his incarceration. We agree with this conclusion. The record contains \r\n  overwhelming evidence that SCDSS not only refused to facilitate visitation, \r\n  it actually took an active role in preventing the father from visiting his children. \r\n  Despite the father's repeated requests, the caseworkers refused to allow visitation \r\n  both at the correctional facility and after the review hearings. SCDSS now asserts \r\n  that its refusal to arrange visitation was based on a therapist's recommendation, \r\n  although the father was denied visitation with his children for at least six \r\n  months before the therapist drafted this recommendation. Therefore, we find \r\n  this reasoning to be unconvincing. \r\n\r\nDespite the conclusion SCDSS prevented visitation, \r\n  the family court nevertheless terminated the father's parental rights based \r\n  upon a failure to visit because the father did not write or communicate with \r\n  the children during his incarceration. We conclude this was error. Section 20-7-1572(3) \r\n  specifically provides that in order for parental rights to be terminated \"it \r\n  must be shown that the parent was not prevented from visiting by the party having \r\n  custody.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(3). Having found that SCDSS actively prevented \r\n  visitation between the father and his children, the statutory requirement of \r\n  section 20-5-1572(3) has not been met.\r\n\r\nThe father next argues the family court erred in \r\n  terminating his parental rights for wilful failure to support the children for \r\n  a period of six months. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn the judicial review order of December 18, 1997, \r\n  the family court ordered the father to \"pay support as able.\" The uncontradicted \r\n  testimony of the father was that prison policies prevent him from earning any \r\n  income while incarcerated and he has no other source of income. SCDSS provided \r\n  no evidence that the father had any outside means with which to support the \r\n  children.\r\n\r\nSection 20-7-1572(4) specifically states that financial \r\n  contributions are required \"according to the parent's means\" and that, when \r\n  considering whether a parent has failed to support the child, the court may \r\n  consider \"the ability of the parent to provide support.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(4) \r\n  (Supp. 2000). The family court found that the father earned no wages and was \r\n  unable to earn income while employed in prison. The family court further noted \r\n  that no family member had made any contribution to the support of the children \r\n  on the father's behalf. Without considering the father's ability to pay or whether \r\n  the failure to support the children was wilful, the family court terminated \r\n  the father's parental rights on this failure. We conclude this was error. To \r\n  determine whether a parent's failure to support or visit during the time of \r\n  incarceration evinces a settled purpose to forego parental responsibilities \r\n  requires a comprehensive analysis of all of the facts and circumstances. See \r\n  Hamby, 264 S.C. at 614, 216 S.E.2d at 536; Henry, 296 S.C. at 506, 374 S.E.2d \r\n  at 298.\r\n\r\nThe father has been incarcerated at Evans Correctional \r\n  Center since 1995, which was before the children were taken into emergency protective \r\n  custody by SCDSS. There is no evidence in the record that the father failed \r\n  in his parental responsibilities to support or provide the children with a stable \r\n  home prior to his incarceration. The uncontradicted testimony of the father \r\n  is to the contrary. \r\n\r\nAs to the parent-child relationship after the parent's \r\n  incarceration, the mother brought the children to the prison during the early \r\n  portion of the father's incarceration. These visitations ended when SCDSS took \r\n  custody of the children. The father has repeatedly attempted to sustain his \r\n  relationship through requested visitation, which SCDSS has thwarted. The father \r\n  has displayed his concern and desire to plan for the children by calling SCDSS \r\n  on several occasions in an attempt to facilitate placement of the children with \r\n  his parents. Although there is no evidence in the record that the father sent \r\n  cards, letters, or anything of value to the children, the father's undisputed \r\n  testimony is that he is not permitted to receive any income from his prison \r\n  employment. SCDSS did not attempt to verify or contradict this assertion. Furthermore, \r\n  SCDSS has provided no evidence the father has an outside means of providing \r\n  support. \r\n\r\nWe conclude the record does not support a finding \r\n  by clear and convincing evidence that the failure to visit or support the children \r\n  was wilful. The statutory requirements of section 20-7-1572 to permit termination \r\n  of parental rights have not been met. When all of the surrounding facts and \r\n  circumstances are considered, the evidence does not clearly and convincingly \r\n  prove the father has \"evince[d] a settled purpose to forego [his] parental duties.\" \r\n  Broome, 307 S.C. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839.\r\n\r\nAlthough we conclude the underlying statutory basis \r\n  for terminating the father's parental rights has not been established, we hasten \r\n  to point out that, even if the basis did exist, the record is woefully lacking \r\n  in evidence from which a valid conclusion could be reached as to what is in \r\n  the best interests of the children. \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nTerminating the parental rights of an incarcerated \r\n  parent requires consideration of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances \r\n  in the determination of wilfulness. The voluntary pursuit of lawless behavior \r\n  is one factor which may be considered, but generally is not determinative. In \r\n  this case, SCDSS has failed to prove a basis under section 20-7-1572 for termination \r\n  of the father's parental rights by clear and convincing evidence. Therefore, \r\n  the order of the family court terminating the father's parental rights is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nSTILWELL and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3314","title":"State v.

Gossett, of Spartanburg, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J.: Minyard Lee Woody \r\n  was convicted of second degree burglary and sentenced to life in prison without \r\n  the possibility of parole, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp. 2000). \r\n  (1) Woody appeals his burglary sentence, arguing the trial court erred \r\n  by refusing to apply S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (1985) so as to treat his two \r\n  prior convictions as one for purposes of sentencing. We vacate Woody's life \r\n  sentence and remand for re-sentencing on the burglary conviction.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nWoody was convicted of second degree burglary in \r\n  July, 1999. At sentencing, the State asserted this was Woody's third serious \r\n  offense as defined in section 17-25-45 (2) because \r\n  Woody had previously been convicted of two armed robberies. In support of its \r\n  contention, the State presented two indictments to which Woody pleaded guilty \r\n  on January 21, 1981, alleging that on April 24, 1980, Woody committed two armed \r\n  robberies; one of a convenience store, and one of the convenience store's clerk. \r\n   (3) \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWoody argues that the two prior convictions should \r\n  be treated as one, pursuant to section 17-25-50. That section reads as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [i]n determining the number of offenses for the \r\n    purpose of imposition of sentence, the court shall treat as one offense any \r\n    number of offenses which have been committed at times so closely connected \r\n    in point of time that they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding \r\n    under the law they constitute separate and distinct offenses.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (1985). \r\n\r\nThe trial court rejected this argument, concluding \r\n  section 17-25-45(F) contained language defining prior offenses differently for \r\n  purposes of that section only, and therefore, section 17-25-50 did not apply. \r\n  Section 17-25-45(F) reads in applicable part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [f]or the purpose of determining a prior conviction \r\n    under this section only, a prior conviction shall mean the defendant has been \r\n    convicted of a most serious or serious offense, as may be applicable, on a \r\n    separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(F) (Supp. 2000). Finding \r\n  that both prior convictions occurred on a separate, prior occasion from the \r\n  burglary conviction, the trial court considered them as two prior \"most serious\" \r\n  offenses, thereby mandating a sentence of life without parole on the burglary \r\n  conviction.\r\n\r\nWe disagree with the trial court's interpretation \r\n  and conclude that sections 17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50 may easily be reconciled \r\n  so that both apply in the present circumstances. Contrary to the State's argument, \r\n  we find nothing to suggest section 17-25-45(F) somehow abrogates section 17-25-50.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Criminal statutes must be strictly construed against \r\n    the State and in favor of the defendant. The elementary and cardinal rule \r\n    of statutory construction is that the court must ascertain and effectuate \r\n    the intent of the legislature. Therefore, in interpreting a statute, the words \r\n    must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to a subtle \r\n    or forced construction that limits or expands the statute's operation. Statutes, \r\n    as a whole, must receive \"practical, reasonable and fair interpretation consonant \r\n    with the purpose, design and policy of lawmakers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Prince, 335 S.C. 466, 472, 517 \r\n  S.E.2d 229, 232 (Ct. App. 1999) (citations omitted) (quoting Whiteside v. \r\n  Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 888 \r\n  (1993)).\r\n\r\nThe court should not consider the particular clause \r\n  in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with the purpose of the whole \r\n  statute and the policy of the law. Prince, 335 S.C. at 472, 517 S.E.2d \r\n  at 232. Statutory provisions should be read so as to be consistent with the \r\n  purpose of the statute. Id. Furthermore, statutes that are part of the \r\n  same act must be read together and sections that are part of the same general \r\n  statutory scheme must be construed together and each given effect, if reasonable. \r\n  Id.\r\n\r\n Section 17-25-50 requires the trial court to combine \r\n  prior offenses \"arising out of simultaneous acts committed in the course of \r\n  a single incident.\" State v. Boyd, 288 S.C. 206, 209, 341 S.E.2d 144, \r\n  146 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding that under section 17-25-50, two prior violations \r\n  of the Controlled Substances Act occurring in the same incident should be treated \r\n  as one offense, and noting that if multiple prior convictions are obtained for \r\n  violations of the Controlled Substance Act unrelated to one another and not \r\n  arising out of a single incident, there is no prohibition against counting each \r\n  conviction separately for sentencing purposes). In State v. Muldrow, \r\n  259 S.C. 414, 192 S.E.2d 211 (1972), our supreme court recognized that this \r\n  section is a recidivist statute. See Legare v. State, 333 S.C. \r\n  275, 509 S.E.2d 472 (1999).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, section 17-25-45(F) limits prior convictions \r\n  which may trigger the life without parole provision contained in section 17-25-45 \r\n  to those convictions which are separate from and prior to the present adjudication. \r\n  \r\n\r\nConsequently, these two statutes can properly be \r\n  read together and applied to Woody. The two prior armed robberies were closely \r\n  connected offenses within one incident. Therefore, in determining the number \r\n  of prior offenses, they must be treated as one conviction under section 17-25-50 \r\n  for sentencing purposes. As one incident, the armed robbery constituted a single \r\n  \"most serious offense.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(1) (Supp. 2000) \r\n  (defining the term \"most serious offense\"). Applying section 17-25-45(F), this \r\n  conviction is considered a prior \"most serious offense\" because it occurred \r\n  on a separate occasion from the present adjudication on the second degree burglary \r\n  charge.\r\n\r\nWoody's conviction for second degree burglary is \r\n  categorized as a \"serious offense.\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(C)(2) (Supp. \r\n  2000) (defining the term \"serious offense\"). Therefore, his prior \"most serious \r\n  offense\" of armed robbery does not invoke the life without parole provision \r\n  of section 17-25-45(B), which requires two or more such prior convictions as \r\n  a trigger. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(B) (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate Woody's sentence \r\n  of life in prison without possibility of parole for the burglary conviction \r\n  and remand for re-sentencing on that charge in accordance with this opinion. \r\n  \r\n\r\nVACATED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR, and HUFF, JJ., concur. \r\n1.  Woody was also convicted \r\n  of Petit Larceny and received a consecutive ten year sentence. There is no appeal \r\n  from that conviction or sentence. \r\n 2.  Section 17-25-45 is a part \r\n  of the Omnibus Crime Act, and provides in part that a person convicted of a \r\n  \"serious offense\" as defined within the statute must be sentenced to life in \r\n  prison without the possibility of parole if that person has two or more prior \r\n  convictions for \"serious\" or \"most serious\" offenses. \r\n 3.  For the first time on appeal, \r\n  and in contrast to the written brief, the State asserted in oral argument that \r\n  the record does not establish with certainty that the two prior armed robberies \r\n  occurred as one incident. We reject this argument, because the convictions were \r\n  presented to the sentencing judge by both the State and the defense as occurring \r\n  as one incident, at one location, and at one time. Two charges were brought \r\n  because different victims were involved. The trial judge considered them as \r\n  such, and no factual basis was proffered by the State to the contrary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3273","title":"Duke Power Company v.

(Laurens) in Duke's action to enjoin \r\nLaurens from serving customers in a newly annexed area of the city of Fountain \r\nInn. Duke argues Laurens lacks the authority under the Rural Electric Cooperative \r\nAct (1) (Act) to serve these customers. We reverse \r\nand remand. \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\nDuke brought this action to enjoin Laurens, a rural electric cooperative (co-op), from providing power to a newly annexed area\r\nof Fountain Inn known as Country Gardens.  Duke, Laurens, and Fountain Inn stipulated to the following facts: Fountain Inn is\r\nnot a rural area under the Act because its population exceeds 2,500 people; Duke is the principal supplier of electricity to\r\nFountain Inn in terms of both revenue and number of customers; neither Laurens nor Duke served any customers in Country\r\nGardens at the time of annexation; and Fountain Inn adopted an ordinance following annexation  granting Laurens an exclusive\r\nassignment to serve Country Gardens, part of which was previously assigned to Duke by the South Carolina Public Service\r\nCommission. (2)\r\n\r\nBoth Laurens and Duke moved for summary judgment.  The trial court granted summary judgment to Laurens from which\r\nDuke appeals.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\"When an appeal involves stipulated or undisputed \r\n  facts, an appellate court is free to review whether the trial court properly \r\n  applied the law to those facts.\" WDW Prop. v. City of Sumter, 342 S.C. \r\n  6, 8, 535 S.E.2d 631, 632 (2000). In such cases, the appellate court is not \r\n  required to defer to the trial court's legal conclusions. J.K. Const., Inc. \r\n  v. W. Carolina Reg'l Sewer Auth., 336 S.C. 162, 166, 519 S.E.2d 561, 563 \r\n  (1999).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nDuke argues the circuit court erred in finding Laurens could lawfully initiate service in a nonrural area absent an applicable\r\nexception under section 33-49-250.  We agree.  \r\n\r\nRural electric cooperatives are creatures of statute \r\n  and only have such authority as the legislature has given them. See South \r\n  Carolina Elec. &amp; Gas Co. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 275 S.C. 487, 489, 272 \r\n  S.E.2d 793, 794 (1980) (recognizing that regulatory bodies as creatures of statute \r\n  hold only those powers expressly granted by the legislature). The cardinal rule \r\n  of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the intention of \r\n  the legislature. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 \r\n  (2000) (citing Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. Sch. Dist. of Greenville County, \r\n  331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998)). If a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous \r\n  on their face, there is no room for statutory construction and courts must apply \r\n  the statute according to its literal meaning. Carolina Power &amp; Light \r\n  Co. v. City of Bennettsville, 314 S.C. 137, 139, 442 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1994). \r\n\r\n\r\nLaurens was created pursuant to the Act's provision \r\n  granting co-ops the authority to supply energy to rural areas while promoting \r\n  and extending the use of electricity across the state. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-210 \r\n  (1990). Because Laurens is a co-op, this court must look to the Act to see if \r\n  Laurens may lawfully initiate service to Country Gardens. \"Under S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 33-49-250, a rural cooperative may provide service only in rural areas, i.e., \r\n  those with a population under 2500.\" Carolina Power &amp; Light Co. v. Town \r\n  of Pageland, 321 S.C. 538, 542, 471 S.E.2d 137, 139 (1996). The Act defines \r\n  a rural area as one \"not included within the boundaries of any incorporated \r\n  or unincorporated city, town, village or borough having a population in excess \r\n  of twenty-five hundred persons . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-20(1). By stipulation \r\n  of the parties, Fountain Inn is no longer a rural area for purposes of the Act. \r\n  Therefore, an exception must apply for Laurens to serve Country Gardens.\r\n\r\nThe Act provides two exceptions permitting a rural co-op to serve customers within a nonrural area, the annexation exception\r\nand the principal supplier exception.  These exceptions provide:\r\n\r\n\r\n  . . . subject to the provisions of Â§ 58-27-1360, the act of incorporating or annexing into a city or town an area in which the\r\ncooperative is serving shall constitute the  consent of the governing body of such city or town for the cooperative to continue\r\nserving all premises then being served and to serve additional  premises within such area until such time as the governing body\r\nof the city or town shall direct otherwise and such cooperative is empowered to serve, but it shall not extend service to any\r\npremises in any other part of such city or town unless the cooperative was the principal supplier of electricity in such city or\r\ntown; provided,  further, that the right of a cooperative to continue to serve in a city or town in which it was the principal\r\nsupplier of electricity shall not be affected by the subsequent growth of such city or town beyond a population of two thousand\r\nfive hundred persons . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-49-250(1). Both exceptions \r\n  prevent the ouster of co-ops from areas they have historically served due to \r\n  population growth or annexation. See City of Abbeville v. Aiken Elec. \r\n  Coop., Inc., 287 S.C. 361, 369, 338 S.E.2d 831, 835 (1985). These exceptions \r\n  contemplate the co-op's continued service in an area.\r\n\r\nBoth Duke and Laurens stipulated that Duke was the principal supplier of electricity to Fountain Inn.  Therefore, the principal\r\nsupplier exception does not apply by the plain language of the statute.\r\n\r\nLaurens contends the annexation exception applies \r\n  here. We disagree. In Pageland, the court held that a co-op may continue \r\n  serving customers following annexation by a nonrural municipality even where \r\n  the co-op is not the principal supplier of electricity for that municipality. \r\n  321 S.C. at 542-44, 471 S.E.2d at 139-40. The Pageland court found the \r\n  intent of the legislature in adopting the annexation exception was to permit \r\n  a co-op to continue serving existing customers once it lawfully entered the \r\n  area. See also Abbeville, 287 S.C. at 369, 338 S.E.2d at 835. \r\n  In Pageland, the co-op was allowed to continue serving the annexed area \r\n  because it was lawfully serving the customers in question before the annexation. \r\n  Here, this analysis mandates the conclusion that Laurens may not serve Country \r\n  Gardens. This does not result in any ouster because Laurens was not serving \r\n  the area before its annexation.\r\n\r\nLaurens's proposed interpretation of the Act would \r\n  rob section 33-49-250 of any meaning and render it superfluous. \r\n  (3) When construing a statute, we must presume the legislature did \r\n  not intend a futile act. TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Dep't of Revenue, \r\n  331 S.C. 611, 620, 503 S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998). If rural co-ops may serve any \r\n  area designated by a municipality, there is no need for section 33-49-250's \r\n  exceptions. Accordingly, the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Laurens \r\n  is hereby reversed and remanded for the entry of an injunction consistent with \r\n  this opinion.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 33-49-10 \r\n  to 1330 (1990 &amp; Supp. 1999). \r\n2.  Fountain Inn agreed to the \r\n  stipulation of facts but did not participate further in the action and did not \r\n  appear at the hearing. \r\n3. Because we agree with Duke \r\n  that the issue in this case is whether Laurens may lawfully enter a nonrural \r\n  area, we do not reach Laurens's contention that Fountain Inn has a constitutional \r\n  right to choose an electric supplier. Were we to reach this issue, we would \r\n  find the court addressed and rejected a similar contention in Pageland. \r\n  There, Pageland contended the trial court's order was contrary to the holding \r\n  in Berkeley Electric Cooperative, Inc. v. South Carolina Public Service Commission, \r\n  304 S.C. 15, 402 S.E.2d 674 (1991). In Berkeley, a co-op challenged the \r\n  right of the city to designate a private power supplier in a newly annexed area. \r\n  The court upheld the ordinance based on the municipality's constitutional right \r\n  to designate its power supplier. Laurens, like Pageland, relies on Berkeley \r\n  and S.C. Constitution, Article VIII, section 15 for the proposition that a municipality \r\n  has an unlimited right to choose its electric provider. However, in Berkeley \r\n  the rights of a co-op to provide that power were not discussed, and Pageland \r\n  suggests the municipality's right is independent of the powers of a co-op. Pageland, \r\n  321 S.C. at 540, 471 S.E.2d at 138 (\". . . notwithstanding the supplier may \r\n  be prohibited from providing service by its status as a rural cooperative.\"). \r\n  Further, a municipality may not enact measures inconsistent with the general \r\n  laws of the state.

Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, 124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993). We reverse.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nAt the suppression hearing, the trial court viewed two police video tape recordings which depicted a June 4, 1998 traffic stop and thirty minute detention.  One\r\nof the video tapes came from Officer Matthew Durham's patrol car.  The second video tape was obtained from Officer James Littleton's patrol car.  Both\r\nofficers testified at trial regarding the detention.  The tapes, together with the testimony, reveal the following.\r\nAt approximately 10:22 a.m. on June 4, 1998, Officer Matthew Durham, with the Anderson County Sheriff's Department, stopped a vehicle for speeding.  The\r\ndriver of the automobile was Alex Graham.  One of the vehicle's windows was broken.  Shortly after Officer Durham stopped the vehicle, Officer James\r\nLittleton arrived on the scene.  Woodruff was a passenger in the vehicle.  Officer Durham asked to see Graham's driver's license or identification, but Graham\r\nwas unable to produce either.  Graham told Officer Durham his last name was \"Harriston\" and provided an address and date of birth.  Graham informed Officer\r\nDurham that he and Woodruff had been to Atlanta to \"see some girls\" and the vehicle belonged to Woodruff.  Officer Durham called in the information Graham\r\nprovided for verification, along with the automobile's tag number.  Officer Durham testified the resulting report indicated the car belonged to Robert Moore,\r\nwho had been reported missing.\r\n\r\nAccording to Officer Durham, Woodruff, when questioned, declared he owned the automobile, but he was unable to produce a registration for the car.  Upon\r\nfurther questioning, Woodruff indicated he and Graham had taken Graham's girlfriend to Atlanta to \"drop her off.\"  Officer Durham stated Woodruff provided\r\nseveral different names during the stop.\r\n\r\nAbout 10:34 a.m., Officer Durham issued Graham a warning ticket for speeding and asked him for permission to search the car.  Graham consented to the\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nAt approximately 10:35 a.m., prior to the vehicle search, Woodruff got out of the car.  Officer Durham conducted a pat-down on both Graham and Woodruff.\r\nNeither search revealed weapons.  The vehicle search, which lasted approximately ten minutes, produced a small set of scales and a number of identification\r\ncards, none of which depicted either Graham or Woodruff.  Officer Durham stated Woodruff claimed to be one of the persons pictured on one of the\r\nidentification cards, but the claim proved to be false.\r\n\r\nAfter the vehicle search, Officer Durham searched Woodruff a second time.  On direct examination, Officer Durham gave the following account of the second\r\nsearch:\r\n\r\nA.   At that time after all the names and anything was adding  up--kept finding different IDs, the inconsistencies with  their stories, the busted window,--at that\r\ntime I did a more  thorough search on the passenger using my hands and went  down through his groin area and at that time I felt a bulge in  his groin area.\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.   And what did you do when you felt that bulge?\r\n\r\nA.   Asked the subject what was in his pants.\r\n\r\nQ.   And what did he tell you?\r\n\r\nA.   He pulled his britches out and at that time I could visually see  the cocaine in his pants.\r\n\r\nQ.   Did you remove it?\r\n\r\nA.   No, ma'am.\r\n\r\nQ.   Who removed it?\r\n\r\nA.   I asked the subject to remove it for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, Officer Durham testified as follows regarding the second search:\r\n\r\nA.   At that time we started finding more IDs.  I think he produced  the ID and we got to finding IDs in the car.  The stories that  they were giving weren't\r\nadding up as to where they said they  were going and where they were coming from and the  window being busted out of the car.  Supposedly now he's a \r\nmissing person out of North Carolina, and then he goes from  there to that he's not even the owner of the car--At that time  I decided I may have missed\r\nsomething, so, I searched him  again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.   Okay, when you patted him down the first time, you didn't  find any weapons?\r\n\r\nA.   No, sir.\r\n\r\nQ.   You didn't expect to find any weapons when you patted  him down again, did you?\r\n\r\nA.   At that time I wasn't looking for weapons.\r\n\r\nQ.   Well, what were you looking for?\r\n\r\nA.   I was looking to see if there was any more IDs or anything  else on him that made me believe that he isn't who he says he  is.\r\n\r\nQ.   And the second time you searched him this was a more  extensive search, wasn't it?\r\n\r\nA.   Yes, it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.   But,-you felt a bulge in his pants.\r\n\r\nA.   That's correct.\r\n\r\nQ.   Okay, did that bulge feel like a knife?\r\n\r\nA.   A knife?\r\n\r\nQ.  Yeah.\r\n\r\nA.  No.\r\n\r\nQ.   Did it feel like a gun?\r\n\r\nA.   No.\r\n\r\nQ.   Did it feel like brass knuckles?\r\n\r\nA.   No.\r\n\r\nQ.   Did it feel like any type of weapon?\r\n\r\nA.   No.\r\n\r\nQ.   What did it feel like?\r\n\r\nA.   At the time I wasn't sure; that's why I asked him what  he had in his pants and at that time he pulled his waistband  out and when he did that I looked down\r\nin his pants and you  could visually see the cocaine in the bag.\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately thirty minutes elapsed between the time Officer Durham made the traffic stop and the time he conducted the second search of Woodruff.  The\r\nmaterial seized from Woodruff was determined to be 30.34 grams of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nWoodruff argues the trial court erred in refusing \r\n  to suppress the crack cocaine because it was seized pursuant to an unlawful \r\n  and unreasonable thirty minute Terry search. We agree.\r\n\r\nI.  Law\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Amendment guarantees \"[t]he right of \r\n  the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against \r\n  unreasonable searches and seizures.\" U.S. Const. amend IV. The Fourth Amendment \r\n  is applicable to the States through the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth \r\n  Amendment. Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643, 81 S.Ct. 1684, 6 L.Ed.2d 1081 \r\n  (1961).\r\n\r\n\"No right is held more sacred, or is more carefully \r\n  guarded by the common law, than the right of every individual to the possession \r\n  and control of his own person, free from all restraint or interference of others, \r\n  unless by clear and unquestionable authority of law.\" Union Pacific Ry. Co. \r\n  v. Botsford, 141 U.S. 250, 251, 11 S.Ct. 1000, 1001, 35 L.Ed. 734, 737 (1891). \r\n  It has, however, long been recognized that not all personal encounters between \r\n  policemen and citizens involve \"seizures\" of persons thereby bringing the Fourth \r\n  Amendment into play. State v. Foster, 269 S.C. 373, 237 S.E.2d 589 (1977); \r\n  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 525 S.E.2d 535 (Ct.

Mendenhall, 446 U.S. at 554, 100 S.Ct. \r\n  at 1877, 64 L.Ed.2d at 509. So long as the person approached and questioned \r\n  remains free to disregard the officer's questions and walk away, there has been \r\n  no intrusion upon that person's liberty or privacy and, therefore, no constitutional \r\n  justification for the encounter is necessary.

Applying its decision \r\n  in Terry, the Supreme Court in Mimms ruled that, subsequent to \r\n  a valid Terry stop for a traffic violation, a police officer may search \r\n  the individual for weapons where the officer has reason to believe the person \r\n  is armed and dangerous. Mimms, 434 U.S. at 111-12, 98 S.Ct. at 334, 54 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 337. See also Ybarra v.

Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 414, 117 S.Ct. \r\n  882, 887, 137 L.Ed.2d 41, 48 (1997).\r\n\r\nIn assessing whether a suspect is armed and dangerous, \r\n  \"[t]he officer need not be absolutely certain that the individual is armed; \r\n  the issue is whether a reasonably prudent man in the circumstances would be \r\n  warranted in the belief that his safety or that of others was in danger.\" Terry, \r\n  392 U.S. at 27, 88 S.Ct. at 1883, 20 L.Ed.2d at 909. \"[I]n justifying the particular \r\n  intrusion the police officer must be able to point to specific and articulable \r\n  facts which, taken together with rational inferences from those facts, reasonably \r\n  warrant that intrusion.\" Terry, 392 U.S. at 21, 88 S.Ct. at 1880, 20 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 906. See also Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 88 S.Ct. \r\n  1889, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968)(officer must be able to specify particular facts \r\n  on which he based his belief suspect was armed and dangerous; officer is not \r\n  entitled to seize and search every person on the street; mere knowledge of suspect \r\n  being known narcotics dealer who put his or her hand into a pocket as police \r\n  approached does not provide justification). Cf. United States v. Moore, \r\n  817 F.2d 1105 (4th Cir. 1987)(justification found where suspect was only person \r\n  observed in vicinity of building late at night, shortly after alarm sounded, \r\n  and street was dark, officer was alone, and suspected crime was burglary); State \r\n  v. Fowler, 322 S.C. 263, 471 S.E.2d 706 (Ct. App. 1996)(in order to support \r\n  his decision to \"frisk\" defendant subsequent to valid Terry stop, officer \r\n  must be able to specify particular facts on which he based his belief suspect \r\n  was armed and dangerous; reasonable person in officer's position must believe \r\n  frisk was necessary to preserve officer's safety).\r\n\r\nThe scope of a search authorized by Terry \r\n  is limited. In Minnesota v. Dickerson, 508 U.S. 366, 113 S.Ct. 2130, \r\n  124 L.Ed.2d 334 (1993), a police officer stopped a suspect and conducted a patdown \r\n  search. Although the search did not reveal any weapons, the officer conducting \r\n  the search felt a small lump in the suspect's nylon jacket. The officer testified: \r\n  \"'[A]s I pat-searched the front of his body, I felt a lump, a small lump, in \r\n  the front pocket. I examined it with my fingers and it slid and it felt to be \r\n  a lump of crack cocaine in cellophane.'\" Id. at 369, 113 S.Ct. at 2133, \r\n  124 L.Ed.2d at 341. The officer then reached into the suspect's pocket and retrieved \r\n  a small plastic bag containing one-fifth of one gram of crack cocaine.\r\n\r\nOn appeal, the Supreme Court held that police officers \r\n  may seize nonthreatening contraband detected through the sense of touch during \r\n  a protective patdown search permitted by Terry, but only if the officers' \r\n  search stays within the bounds marked by Terry. Id. at 373, 113 \r\n  S.Ct. at 2135-36, 124 L.Ed.2d at 344. Specifically, the Court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\nIf a police officer lawfully pats down a suspect's outer clothing and feels an object whose contour or mass makes its identity immediately apparent, there has\r\nbeen no invasion of the suspect's privacy beyond that already authorized by the officer's search for weapons; if the object is contraband, its warrantless seizure\r\nwould be justified by the same practical considerations that inhere in the plain-view context.\r\n\r\n\r\nDickerson, 508 U.S. at 375-76, 113 S.Ct. \r\n  at 2137, 124 L.Ed.2d at 346. Further, the Dickerson Court instructed: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \"The purpose of this limited search is not to \r\n    discover evidence of crime, but to allow the officer to pursue his investigation \r\n    without fear of violence . . . .\" Adams [v. Williams, 407 U.S. 143, \r\n    146, 92 S.Ct. 1921, 1923, 32 L.Ed.2d 612, 617 (1972)]. Rather, a protective \r\n    search--permitted without a warrant and on the basis of reasonable suspicion \r\n    less than probable cause--must be strictly \"limited to that which is necessary \r\n    for the discovery of weapons which might be used to harm the officer or others \r\n    nearby.\" Terry, supra, at 26, 88 S.Ct. at 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d 889; \r\n    see also Michigan v. Long, 463 U.S. 1032, 1049, and 1052, n.16, \r\n    103 S.Ct. 3469, 3480-81, and 3482, n.16, 77 L.Ed.2d 1201 (1983); Ybarra \r\n    v. Illinois, 444 U.S. 85, 93-94, 100 S.Ct. 338, 343-44, 62 L.Ed.2d 238 \r\n    (1979). If the protective search goes beyond what is necessary to determine \r\n    if the suspect is armed, it is no longer valid under Terry and its \r\n    fruits will be suppressed. Sibron v. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 65-66, \r\n    88 S.Ct. 1889, 1904, 20 L.Ed.2d 917 (1968).\r\n\r\n\r\nDickerson, 508 U.S. at 373, 113 S.Ct at \r\n  2138, 124 L.Ed.2d at 344.\r\n\r\nThe courts of this state have recognized and applied \r\n  the principle that law enforcement officers are not granted, under the purview \r\n  of Terry, a general warrant to rummage and seize at will, \r\n  (1) and that any evidence stemming from an unlawful detention must \r\n  be excluded as \"fruit of the poisonous tree.\" The case of Sikes v. State, \r\n  323 S.C. 28, 448 S.E.2d 560 (1994), involved a traffic stop which resulted in \r\n  a twenty minute detention during which Sikes, the passenger of a vehicle, was \r\n  searched twice before being placed in a police car. When Sikes got out of the \r\n  police car, an officer found a bag of crack cocaine on the back seat. Our Supreme \r\n  Court determined:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When an officer stops a vehicle for a traffic \r\n    violation, he may briefly detain the vehicle and its occupants while \r\n    he examines the vehicle registration and the driver's license. Delaware \r\n    v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 99 S.Ct. 1391, 59 L.Ed.2d 660 (1979) (emphasis \r\n    added). Although Sikes does not challenge the officers' initial stop of the \r\n    automobile, Sikes claims that the officers improperly seized him to run a \r\n    warrant check with no reasonable cause. An individual is \"seized\" when an \r\n    officer restrains his freedom, even if the detention is brief and falls short \r\n    of arrest. The scope and duration of seizure must be strictly tied to and \r\n    justified by the circumstances which rendered its initiation proper. Terry \r\n    v. Ohio, 392 U.S. 1, 88 S.Ct. 1868, 20 L.Ed.2d 889 (1968). In South Carolina, \r\n    we have gone a little further by holding that an officer may stop a car and \r\n    briefly detain the occupants if he has a reasonable suspicion that \r\n    the occupants are involved in criminal activity. Knight v. State, \r\n    284 S.C. 138, 325 S.E.2d 535 (1985) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n  Here the officers' \"reasonable suspicion\" was \r\n    that the car was either stolen or that the driver was uninsured. Under Knight, \r\n    supra, neither of these reasons gave the officers the right to seize \r\n    or question the car's passenger. Moreover, even assuming arguendo that this \r\n    stop was reasonable, certainly a twenty minute detention while the officers \r\n    \"went fishing\" for evidence of some crime was not brief within the definition \r\n    announced in Prouse, supra, or in Knight, supra. \r\n    See also State v. Damm, 246 Kan. 220, 787 P.2d 1185 (1990)(seizure \r\n    of occupants of the vehicle while routine records checks were made of the \r\n    occupants was unreasonable); State v. Johnson, 805 P.2d 761 (Utah 1991)(the \r\n    leap from asking for the passenger's name and date of birth to running a warrants \r\n    check on her severed the rational inference from specific and articulable \r\n    facts and degenerated into an attempt to support an as yet unparticularized \r\n    suspicion or hunch).\r\n\r\n  The detention and arrest of the Petitioner was \r\n    unlawful; therefore, the evidence of the Petitioner's possession of crack \r\n    cocaine would have been inadmissible as fruit of the poisonous tree. Wong \r\n    Sun v. United States, 371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); \r\n    State v. Plath, 277 S.C. 126, 284 S.E.2d 221 (1981).\r\n\r\n\r\nSikes, 323 S.C. at 31-32, 448 S.E.2d at \r\n  562-63 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of an \"on-the-scene\" warrantless \r\n  seizure depends on the balance between the public interest and the individual's \r\n  right to personal security free from arbitrary interference by law enforcement \r\n  officers. See State v. Foster, 269 S.C. 373, 237 S.E.2d 589 (1977)(citing \r\n  United States v. Brignoni-Ponce, 422 U.S. 873, 95 S.Ct. 2574, 45 L.Ed.2d \r\n  607 (1975)). The applicable balancing test employs judicial review of all of \r\n  the circumstances including but not limited to: (1) the seriousness of the offense; \r\n  (2) the degree of likelihood that the person detained may have witnessed or \r\n  been involved in the offense; (3) the proximity in time and space from the scene \r\n  of the crime; (4) the urgency of the occasion; (5) the nature of the detention \r\n  and its extent; (6) the means and procedures employed by the officer; and (7) \r\n  the presence of any circumstances suggesting harassment or a deliberate effort \r\n  to avoid the necessity of securing a warrant. United States v. Holland, \r\n  510 F.2d 453 (9th Cir. 1975); State v. Rodriquez, 323 S.C. 484, 476 S.E.2d \r\n  161 (Ct. App. 1996).\r\n\r\nGiven the intrusive nature of a seizure and considering \r\n  the fact that on occasion a person may be wrongfully stopped, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court has held, as has the Supreme Court of this State, that the scope \r\n  and duration of a Terry detention \"must be strictly tied to and justified \r\n  by the circumstances which rendered its initiation proper.\" Florida v. Royer, \r\n  460 U.S. 491, 500, 103 S.Ct. 1319, 1325, 75 L.Ed.2d 229, 238 (1983); Sikes, \r\n  323 S.C. at 30, 448 S.E.2d at 562. The burden falls upon the State to \"demonstrate \r\n  that the seizure it seeks to justify on the basis of a reasonable suspicion \r\n  was sufficiently limited in scope and duration to satisfy the conditions of \r\n  an investigative seizure.\" Royer, 460 U.S. at 500, 103 S.Ct. at 1326, \r\n  75 L.Ed.2d at 238.\r\n\r\nIn State v. Rodriquez, this Court considered \r\n  the scope of a thirty minute detention. The Court discussed the background of \r\n  a train trip by Rodriquez resulting in his detention and explicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Even assuming an investigative detention was proper \r\n    at that point, we find a thirty minute detention while the officers attempted \r\n    to elicit incriminating evidence from Rodriquez is the type of fishing expedition \r\n    denounced by our Supreme Court in Sikes, 448 S.E.2d at 563 (assuming \r\n    arguendo, that stop of motor vehicle passengers was reasonable, twenty minute \r\n    detention while officers \"went fishing\" for some evidence of crime was not \r\n    brief). In light of the foregoing, we hold the intrusion of the officers in \r\n    this case was not reasonable.\r\n\r\n\r\nRodriquez, 323 S.C. at 494, 476 S.E2d at \r\n  166-67. See also United States v. Sharpe, 470 U.S. 675, 686, 105 \r\n  S.Ct. 1568, 1575, 84 L.Ed.2d 605, 615 (1985)(\"In assessing whether a detention \r\n  is too long in duration to be justified as an investigative stop, [it is] appropriate \r\n  to examine whether the police diligently pursued a means of investigation that \r\n  was likely to confirm or dispel their suspicions quickly, during which time \r\n  it was necessary to detain the defendant.\").\r\n\r\nII.  Analysis\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, Woodruff moved to suppress the crack cocaine Officer Durham found in Woodruff's pants as poisonous fruit of an improper frisk.  After\r\nviewing police video tapes of the incident, the trial court ruled the cocaine admissible, concluding that although the second search was questionable, the officers\r\nacted reasonably in light of the developing scenario.  We hold the evidence was improperly admitted.\r\n\r\nBecause Officer Durham observed Graham speeding, \r\n  he was justified in conducting a traffic stop. Once Graham was lawfully detained \r\n  for speeding, Officer Durham could ask Woodruff to step out of the vehicle. \r\n  Graham consented to a search of the vehicle. There has been no challenge as \r\n  to the propriety of Officer Durham's initial patdown of Woodruff in order to \r\n  search for weapons. Thus, the dispositive issue before us is whether Officer \r\n  Durham discovered the contraband on Woodruff's person while acting within the \r\n  lawful parameters of Terry. \r\n\r\nOfficer Durham's second search of Woodruff was, \r\n  without question, unrelated to any reasonable apprehension Woodruff was armed \r\n  with a weapon. Officer Durham had already searched Woodruff for weapons and \r\n  admitted he was not looking for weapons during the second search. Rather, because \r\n  he feared he may have \"missed something\" the first time he searched Woodruff, \r\n  Officer Durham decided to conduct a second, more thorough search for evidence \r\n  of a crime. In so doing, Officer Durham acted outside the \"strictly circumscribed\" \r\n  search for weapons authorized in Terry. See Terry, 392 U.S. at 26, 88 S.Ct. \r\n  at 1882, 20 L.Ed.2d at 908. In our view, this behavior constitutes the very \r\n  type of evidentiary search, or \"fishing expedition,\" Terry expressly refused \r\n  to authorize and which has been condemned time and again by the United States \r\n  Supreme Court, as well as the courts of this State.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the second search of Woodruff was constitutionally \r\n  violative. Therefore, evidence of his possession of crack cocaine was inadmissible \r\n  as fruit of the poisonous tree. See Wong Sun v. United States, \r\n  371 U.S. 471, 83 S.Ct. 407, 9 L.Ed.2d 441 (1963); Sikes v. State, 323 \r\n  S.C. 28, 448 S.E.2d 560 (1994).

Bailey, of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, CJ.: Joseph Myers appeals his convictions for assault \r\nand battery with intent to kill (ABIK) and assault and battery of a high and aggravated \r\nnature (ABHAN). He argues the trial court erred in admitting character evidence \r\nand in submitting a confusing verdict form to the jury. We affirm. \r\nMyers attended a cookout in February 1998. When \r\n  Robert Thomas arrived, the two began to argue and were asked to take their argument \r\n  outside the house. Once outside, the confrontation turned physical, and Myers \r\n  stabbed Thomas in the neck and abdomen. Mary Young also suffered a cut as she \r\n  tried to persuade them to leave.\r\n\r\nThe Orangeburg County Grand Jury indicted Myers \r\n  on charges of ABIK for assaulting Thomas and ABHAN for assaulting Young. At \r\n  trial, Thomas testified over defense objection that he picked up a board as \r\n  he left the house because \"I kn[e]w [Myers] was dangerous and I kn[e]w that \r\n  he carried a knife.\" Thomas said he dropped the board when Young asked them \r\n  to leave. As he walked away, Myers's girlfriend blocked his way, asking him \r\n  if he wanted to fight. Myers then reached around his girlfriend and began stabbing \r\n  Thomas.\r\n\r\nMyers testified in his own defense. He admitted \r\n  stabbing Thomas, but claimed he only did so because Thomas threatened him with \r\n  the board. He feared Thomas would hit him with the board if he turned to leave. \r\n  Myers testified Thomas did not drop the board until after the stabbing.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the case, the court held a hearing \r\n  to discuss the jury charges and verdict form. The court decided to submit two \r\n  lesser included offenses under the ABIK indictment and one lesser included offense \r\n  under the ABHAN charge. The court drafted a special verdict form with five interrogatories \r\n  consisting of a statement followed by a choice of YES or NO and an instruction. \r\n  (1) The court used the interrogatories because the charges against \r\n  Myers involved two separate victims and each charge had at least one lesser \r\n  included offense. Myers objected to the court's interrogatory verdict form, \r\n  arguing it would confuse the jury. \r\n\r\nAfter the court issued its instructions to the jury, Myers renewed his objection.  By circling YES on two of the five\r\ninterrogatories, the  jury  convicted Myers of ABIK and ABHAN as charged.  This appeal follows.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.  Character Evidence\r\n\r\nFirst, Myers argues the trial court erred in allowing \r\n  Thomas to testify he knew Myers was dangerous and carried a knife. On appeal, \r\n  Myers contends this improperly placed his character into evidence. However, \r\n  at trial the basis of Myers's objection to Thomas's testimony was that the testimony \r\n  was irrelevant. Myers never argued to the trial court that Thomas's testimony \r\n  improperly placed his character into evidence. Because his argument now differs \r\n  from the ground for his trial objection, this issue is not preserved. See \r\n  State v. McCray, 332 S.C. 536, 542, 506 S.E.2d 301, 303 (1998); State \r\n  v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 428, 462 S.E.2d 263, 265 (1995). Myers may not \r\n  argue one ground at trial and then an alternative ground on appeal. See \r\n  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997); State v. Bailey, \r\n  298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989). Accordingly, this issue is not preserved \r\n  for our review.\r\n\r\nII.  Special Verdict Form\r\n\r\nNext, Myers asserts the trial court's use of interrogatories in its verdict form was confusing and may have obscured the jury's\r\nopportunity to find him not guilty. (2)  Myers claims the jury form was confusing and prejudiced him by precluding the jury from\r\nfinding him not guilty.  He further asserts that the trial court did not remedy this error through its oral instructions to the jury. \r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\nThe verdict form required the jury to either circle YES or NO for each individual interrogatory reached and instructed the jury\r\nhow to proceed from one interrogatory to the next.  The term \"not guilty\" did not appear anywhere on the verdict form,\r\nalthough the trial judge stated in her instructions to the jury that one of the possible verdicts was not guilty.\r\n\r\nIt is the preferred practice to submit the possible \r\n  verdict of \"not guilty\" to the jury; however, the law to be charged must be \r\n  determined from the evidence presented. State v. Somerset, 276 S.C. 220, \r\n  221, 277 S.E.2d 593, 594 (1981); State v. Rogers, 275 S.C. 485, 486, \r\n  272 S.E.2d 792, 792 (1980). A jury should be instructed that one verdict it \r\n  can reach is \"not guilty,\" especially where the crime charged is of a serious \r\n  nature. State v. Griggs, 184 S.C. 304, 315-16, 192 S.E. 360, 365 (1937) \r\n  (stating that where the trial judge in his charge instructed the jury that if \r\n  it had a reasonable doubt as to appellant's guilt it must find him not guilty, \r\n  there is no reversible error if the trial judge then fails to tell the jury \r\n  that \"not guilty\" is one verdict it could render). Here, we believe the trial \r\n  judge's clear and cogent jury instructions ameliorated any possible prejudice \r\n  emanating from the failure to include \"not guilty\" on the verdict form.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge carefully explained the verdict \r\n  form, which read that each interrogatory must be answered \"unanimously . . . \r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.\" The judge informed the jury no fewer than fifteen \r\n  times that the State had the burden of proving Myers \"guilty beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.\" While reading the verdict form to the jury, the judge stated at least \r\n  an additional eight times that the State must find Myers \"guilty beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt.\" Further, the words \"reasonable doubt\" were mentioned at least seventeen \r\n  times to the jury, and the jury was advised no less than nine times of its duty \r\n  to find Myers \"not guilty\" if the State failed to meet its burden of proof. \r\n  Additionally, although the verdict form did not have the words \"not guilty\"on \r\n  it, neither did it contain the word \"guilty.\" Thus, given the charge, we do \r\n  not find that the verdict form prevented the jury from finding Myers not guilty.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   The jury form stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Please circle the appropriate answers below and \r\n    follow the accompanying instructions carefully.\r\n\r\n  1. We the jury unanimously find beyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt that Joseph Myers, III did in Orangeburg County on or about February \r\n    17, 1998, commit an ASSAULT AND BATTERY WITH INTENT TO KILL upon Robert Thomas. \r\n    YES NO\r\n\r\n  If your answer is yes, go to question 4, \r\n    if your answer is no then proceed to question 2.\r\n\r\n  2.

YES NO\r\n\r\n  If your answer if yes, go to question 4, \r\n    if your answer is no then proceed to question 3.\r\n\r\n  3.

We the jury unanimously find beyond a reasonable \r\n    doubt that Joseph Myers, III did in Orangeburg County on or about February \r\n    17, 1998, commit a SIMPLE ASSAULT AND BATTERY upon Mary Young. YES \r\n    NO\r\n\r\n  Stop and end your deliberations. \r\n\r\n2.  We address the merits of \r\n  this issue, although we note its preservation is questionable. At trial, Myers \r\n  objected because the jury form might confuse the jury. However on appeal, Myers \r\n  argues the form is defective because it did not contain the words \"not guilty.\" \r\n  Arguably, trial counsel's objections were based on different grounds.

Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J.: John Hamilton appeals from his convictions for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK) and possession of contraband.  Hamilton was\r\nsentenced to life imprisonment without parole for ABIK and ten years for possession of contraband.  He argues the trial court erred in (1) excluding psychiatric\r\ntestimony as irrelevant and (2) denying his motion for a mistrial due to the Solicitor's improper comments during closing arguments.  Additionally, Hamilton\r\nclaims the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction because the indictment for possession of contraband was insufficient.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\nHamilton was an inmate at the Broad River Correctional Institute (Broad River) in Richland County, South Carolina.  Inmates at Broad River are housed in four\r\ndormitories, each divided into two wings.  Each wing houses approximately 125 inmates and is manned by one correctional officer.  On December 13, 1996,\r\nOfficer Brandon Jeter was the correctional officer on duty in Hamilton's dormitory wing.\r\nHamilton worked that morning at his prison job and returned to the dormitory around lunchtime.  Hamilton did not intend to return to work for the afternoon,\r\nbut had forgotten to inform his supervisor, which can result in disciplinary action for an unauthorized absence.  Hamilton stated he asked Officer Jeter to allow\r\nhim to exit the dormitory.  Jeter refused, saying he would open the door after he sorted the mail.  According to Hamilton, by the time Jeter finished sorting the\r\nmail, it would have been too late for him to get to his job and his supervisor would have written him up for refusing to work.  He would then have been placed\r\non lockup, which is administrative segregation.\r\n\r\nA nearby inmate, Karim Almatin, heard Officer Jeter and Hamilton arguing and convinced Hamilton to step into his room, which was located next to Jeter's\r\ndesk.  Almatin told Hamilton he \"need[ed] to let it go.\"  While Hamilton was in Almatin's room, he heard Officer Jeter open the door for a dorm worker. (1) \r\nHamilton attempted to slip out of the door behind the dorm worker.  Jeter refused to allow Hamilton to exit as he was wearing dormitory shoes, similar to flip\r\nflops, which the inmates are not permitted to wear outside.  Hamilton cursed at Jeter but retreated into the dorm.\r\n\r\nHamilton went back into Almatin's cell.  When the dorm worker returned, Officer Jeter opened the door.  Hamilton again attempted to exit.  This time, he\r\nsuccessfully forced his way into the common area.  Officer Jeter and Hamilton exchanged words.  Jeter asked the yard officer, Tara Hopkins, to take Hamilton\r\nto a holding cell while Jeter wrote him up for a disciplinary infraction.  Hopkins told Jeter she could not take Hamilton to the holding cell because he was\r\nwearing improper shoes.  Jeter and Hopkins testified Hamilton yelled words to this effect: \"I'll teach you mother f____rs who to mess with.\"\r\n\r\nHamilton turned around and walked back into the dorm area.  Officer Hopkins followed him.  Hopkins lost sight of Hamilton, stating he \"vanished\" as she\r\nentered the unit.  Hopkins next saw Hamilton approaching Jeter with a homemade knife (shank) in his hand.\r\n\r\nOfficer Jeter was sitting at his desk sorting mail when he heard Officer Hopkins yell: \"Move . . . Get your gas, get your gas.\"  Jeter looked up and saw Hamilton\r\nrunning toward him fumbling with something behind his back.  Jeter jumped out of his chair.  Hamilton chased him around the office and stabbed him in the\r\nback with the shank.  Officer Jeter struck Hamilton and was eventually able to spray him with pepper gas.  While trying to get away from Hamilton, Jeter\r\ndropped the gas and his keys.\r\n\r\nHamilton again pursued Officer Jeter.  Officer Hopkins intervened with a billy stick, striking Hamilton on the wrist to knock the shank out of his hand.  The\r\nshank did not fall because it was tied to Hamilton's wrist.  Hamilton attempted to stab Jeter by reaching around Hopkins.  Jeter and Hopkins testified Hamilton\r\nyelled: \"I'm gonna kill, I'm gonna kill you, mother f____.\"\r\n\r\nOfficer Hopkins retrieved Officer Jeter's gas and sprayed Hamilton with it.  Almatin and another inmate retrieved the keys and assisted Hopkins and Jeter. \r\nHopkins called for assistance and other officers arrived.  At least one officer escorted Hamilton outside the dormitory.  At that time, Hamilton did not have the\r\nshank.\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred around 11:15 a.m.  Thereafter, approximately eight officers instituted a lock-down, (2) a shake-down, (3) and a body strip search of all\r\ninmates in the dormitory wing.  About 1:45 p.m., Officer Gregory Wells found a shank hidden in a mop head in a room about twenty-five feet from the site of\r\nthe incident.  Wells testified he noticed a small amount of wet blood on the mop head, which led him to inspect the mop.\r\n\r\nOfficer Jeter suffered serious injuries and stayed in the hospital approximately five days.  The shank went between Jeter's ribs and penetrated his lung, requiring\r\nsurgery to remove a portion of the lung.  Jeter had not returned to work as a corrections officer at the time of the trial in November of 1998.\r\n\r\nHamilton testified at trial.  He admitted he usually carried a shank and that he carried his shank that day.  In addition, Hamilton admitted he stabbed Jeter.  Yet,\r\nhe denied the shank found by Officer Wells was his shank.  He further denied threatening to kill Jeter.  Hamilton conceded the assault was vicious.  Hamilton\r\ndeclared he \"wasn't being malicious\" when he assaulted Jeter; rather, the verbal altercation \"just escalated\" and the incident was a result of the \"heat of the\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.  Did the Circuit Court err in excluding as irrelevant the testimony of Dr. Rathle, who performed a psychiatric evaluation of Hamilton in March 1997?\r\nII.  Did the Circuit Court err in denying Hamilton's motion for a mistrial based on improper comments in the Solicitor's closing argument?\r\n\r\nIII.  Did the Circuit Court have subject matter jurisdiction to try Hamilton for possession of contraband based on the indictment?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.  Exclusion of Dr. Rathle's Testimony\r\nHamilton contends the Circuit Court erred in excluding the testimony of Dr. Jacques M. Rathle, who completed a psychiatric evaluation of Hamilton in March\r\n1997.  Hamilton asserts the testimony was relevant to the question of malice, a key issue in determining whether Hamilton committed assault and battery of a\r\nhigh and aggravated nature (ABHAN) or ABIK.\r\n\r\nA.  The Proffer\r\n\r\nUpon the close of the State's case, defense counsel made a proffer explaining Dr. Rathle examined Hamilton during a routine examination of all inmates in the\r\nmedium security unit.  Defense counsel requested a ruling that the evidence did not open the door to Hamilton's prior disciplinary records.  Defense counsel\r\nstated that, as a result of the examination, Dr. Rathle diagnosed Hamilton with antisocial personality disorder.  In February of 1997, after he assaulted Officer\r\nJeter, Hamilton was prescribed Buspar.  Dr. Rathle replaced Buspar with Benadryl.  Another doctor later prescribed Vistaril, in lieu of Benadryl.\r\n\r\nThe State objected to the admission of the evidence \r\n  on the ground of relevancy and on the ground the evidence would confuse the \r\n  jury. The trial judge listened to Dr. Rathle's testimony in camera. \r\n  Dr. Rathle testified that, in March of 1997, he diagnosed Hamilton with antisocial \r\n  personality disorder. Dr. Rathle defined a person with antisocial personality \r\n  disorder as one \"who has some difficulty in adjusting to the societal norms \r\n  . . . due to irritability, . . . restlessness, . . . anxiety, [or] . . . lack \r\n  of conformity.\" Dr. Rathle professed the Benadryl or Vistaril had a calming \r\n  effect on a patient with antisocial personality disorder. The intent of prescribing \r\n  the mild tranquilizers, according to Dr. Rathle, is to sedate the prisoner \"to \r\n  be less irritable, by reason of . . . being confined twenty-three, twenty-four \r\n  hours a day in a cell.\"\r\n\r\nThe State again objected to the evidence.  The trial judge excluded the evidence as \"irrelevant evidence on the grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time\"\r\nunder Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\nB.  Standard of Review - Admissibility of Evidence\r\n\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the sound discretion \r\n  of the trial court. State v. McDonald, Op. No. 25225 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  December 18, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 44 at 37); State v. Patterson, \r\n  337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999). A court's ruling on the admissibility \r\n  of evidence will not be reversed by this Court absent an abuse of discretion \r\n  or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant. \r\n  State v. Mansfield, Op. No. 3247 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 2, 2000)(Shearouse \r\n  Adv. Sh. No. 37 at 19); State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 525 S.E.2d \r\n  535 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\nC.  Relevancy: Admissibility of Evidence Under the Common Law \r\n\r\n  The trial judge is given broad discretion in \r\n  ruling on questions concerning the relevancy of evidence. State v. Alexander, \r\n  303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991); State v. Jeffcoat, 279 S.C. 167, \r\n  303 S.E.2d 855 (1983). Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make \r\n  more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly \r\n  bears. Alexander, 303 S.C. at 380, 401 S.E.2d at 148; State v. Schmidt, \r\n  288 S.C. 301, 342 S.E.2d 401 (1986). Only relevant evidence is admissible. See \r\n  State v. Petit, 144 S.C. 452, 142 S.E. 725 (1928). \"'All that is required \r\n  is that the fact shown legally tends to establish, or to make more or less probable, \r\n  some matter in issue and to bear directly or indirectly thereon.' It is not \r\n  required that the inference sought should 'necessarily follow' from the fact \r\n  proved. Evidence is relevant if it makes the desired inference more probable \r\n  than it would be without the evidence.\" Jon P. Thames &amp; W.M. Von Zharen, \r\n  A Guide to Evidence Law in South Carolina 28 (1987)(quoting Francis \r\n  v. Mauldin, 215 S.C. 374, 378, 55 S.E.2d 337, 338 (1949)).\r\n\r\nHowever, not all relevant evidence is admissible. \r\n  Petit, 144 S.C. at 466, 142 S.E. at 730-31. Our Supreme Court, in State \r\n  v. Petit, discussed the admissibility of testimonial evidence:\r\n\r\n\r\nWe feel sure that one of the main reasons for much of the misunderstanding as to when evidence should be allowed, and when it ought to be refused, is due to\r\nfailure to properly distinguish between the legal terms, \"relevancy\" and \"competency,\" so often used in the law of evidence, and, too generally but erroneously,\r\nsupposed to be exactly synonymous.  Many efforts have been made by courts, judges, and law writers to define the words so as to differentiate them correctly. \r\nIn all the definitions we have read of \"relevancy,\" we have been impressed much with that given by the New York Supreme Court:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \"The meaning of the word relevant, as applied to \r\n      testimony, is that it directly touches upon the issue which the parties \r\n      have made by their pleadings, so as to assist in getting at the truth of \r\n      it. It comes from the French relever, which means to assist.\" Platner \r\n      v. Platner, 78 N.Y. 95.\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nAs to the other word \"competency,\" or rather, \"competent \r\nevidence,\" Black's Law Dictionary gives approval to this definition from \r\nMr. Greenleaf: \r\n\r\n  \r\n\"That which the very nature of the thing to be proven requires, as the production of a writing when its contents are the subject of inquiry.\"\r\n\r\n  \r\n  In the \"Preliminary Definitions\" on the subject \r\n    of Evidence, in Corpus Juris, there will be found a part of one sentence \r\n    that expresses very clearly a thought we now have in mind, namely:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n\"* * * It is clear that evidence may be logically relevant and yet inadmissible because not competent, that is, because not the character of proof which the law\r\npermits in the particular case.\"  22 C. J. 65.\r\n\r\n    \r\n  \r\nIrrelevant evidence is never, properly, admissible in a cause; competent evidence is always admissible; relevant evidence may, or may not, be admissible,\r\ndepending upon its competency.\r\n\r\nTaking together the approved definitions of \"relevancy\" and \"competency\" as they are to be applied in the introduction of evidence in the trial of a cause, a fair\r\nand brief statement of a rule to keep in mind, seems to us, to be this: Any evidence that assists in getting at the truth of the issue is relevant, unless, because of\r\nsome legal rule, it is incompetent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPetit, 144 S.C. at 466-67, 142 S.E. at 730-31 \r\n  (emphasis omitted). In State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941), \r\n  the Court affirmed the trial judge's refusal to permit the admission of relevant \r\n  evidence which would confuse the jury. The Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the outset we repeat the time-honored tenet that ordinarily the conduct of a trial, including the admission and rejection of proffered testimony, is largely\r\nwithin the sound discretion of the trial Judge and his exercise of such will not be disturbed by this Court on appeal unless it can be shown that there has been an\r\nabuse of discretion, a commission of legal error in its exercise, and that the rights of the appellant have been thereby prejudiced. . . . .\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n. . . When it became clear to the presiding Judge that the [evidence sought to be admitted] was unconnected (as testified to by the appellant himself) with the\r\nmiscellaneous items upon which the State was seeking conviction he, we think not improperly, ruled out further evidence concerning the former.  The situation\r\nseems to us to have been one peculiarly appropriate for the exercise of discretion as to admissibility of evidence and to guard against the confusion of the jury\r\nby the injection of collateral issues. . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 103-04, 16 S.E.2d at \r\n  534. The Gregory Court found no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\nRelevant evidence may be excluded for undue prejudice \r\n  even though no specific exclusionary rule requires exclusion. State v. Alexander, \r\n  303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991); Jon P. Thames &amp; W.M. Von Zharen, A \r\n  Guide to Evidence Law in South Carolina 28 (1987). The Supreme Court adopted \r\n  the language of Rule 403 of the Federal Rules of Evidence in State v. Alexander, \r\n  303 S.C. at 382, 401 S.E.2d at 149:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that this Court has ever explicitly approved of this general rule, although such a test has been applied in a variety of contexts.  We now adopt\r\nthe language, in pertinent part, of Federal Rule of Evidence 403 that, \"although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially\r\noutweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.\"  (Footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the adoption of the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Evidence, our appellate courts often relied on the Federal Rules of Evidence \r\n  for guidance. See Riddle v. State, 314 S.C. 1, 443 S.E.2d 557 \r\n  (1994)(establishing procedure in accordance with Rule 614 of the Federal Rules \r\n  of Evidence, supplemented by South Carolina common law); State v. Doctor, \r\n  306 S.C. 527, 413 S.E.2d 36 (1992)(following Federal Rule of Evidence 804(b)(3)); \r\n  State v. Sarvis, 317 S.C. 102, 106, 450 S.E.2d 606, 608 (Ct. App. 1994)(stating \r\n  that although Fed. R. Evid. 609(b) is not binding, \"its bright-line rule does \r\n  provide some assistance\"); Johnson v. Pritchard, 302 S.C. 437, 395 S.E.2d \r\n  191 (Ct. App. 1990)(following Rule 803(16) of the Uniform Rules of Evidence \r\n  and Federal Rules of Evidence governing the admissibility of ancient documents); \r\n  Bain v. Self Mem'l Hosp., 281 S.C. 138, 314 S.E.2d 603 (Ct. App. 1984)(adopting \r\n  Rule 805 of the Federal Rules of Evidence). \r\n\r\nD.  Relevancy: Admissibility Under the SCRE\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina adopted the South Carolina Rules \r\n  of Evidence effective September 3, 1995. Relevant evidence is defined as \"evidence \r\n  having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence \r\n  to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would \r\n  be without the evidence.\" Rule 401, SCRE. See also State v. Aleksey, \r\n  Op. No. 25212 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed November 13, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. \r\n  41 at 1)(evidence is relevant if it has a direct bearing upon and tends to establish \r\n  or make more or less probable the matter in controversy). \"All relevant evidence \r\n  is admissible, except as otherwise provided by the Constitution of the United \r\n  States, the Constitution of the State of South Carolina, statutes, these rules, \r\n  or by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.\" Rule \r\n  402, SCRE. \"Evidence which is not relevant is not admissible.\" Id. \"Although \r\n  relevant, evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed \r\n  by the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the \r\n  jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless presentation \r\n  of cumulative evidence.\" Rule 403, SCRE. See also State v. Cooley, \r\n  342 S.C. 63, 536 S.E.2d 666 (2000)(although evidence is relevant, it should \r\n  be excluded where danger of unfair prejudice substantially outweighs its probative \r\n  value).\r\n\r\nRules 401 and 403, SCRE, are identical to their federal counterparts and are consistent with South Carolina common law.  Rules 401 &amp; 403, SCRE (advisory\r\ncommittee's notes).  Rule 402, SCRE, is identical to the federal rule, except as amended to reference South Carolina law.  Rule 402, SCRE (advisory\r\ncommittee's note).\r\n\r\nThe State objected to Dr. Rathle's testimony on the grounds of relevance and confusion of the jury.  The trial judge excluded the evidence as \"irrelevant\r\nevidence on the grounds of prejudice, confusion or waste of time\" under Rule 403, SCRE.\r\n\r\nA trial judge's decision regarding the comparative \r\n  probative value and prejudicial effect of evidence should be reversed only in \r\n  \"exceptional circumstances.\" United States v. Green, 887 F.2d 25, 27 \r\n  (1st Cir. 1989). See also State v. Slocumb, 336 S.C. 619, 633, \r\n  521 S.E.2d 507, 514 (Ct. App. 1999)(in addressing the admissibility of evidence \r\n  under Rule 403, this Court stated: \"[G]iven these reports were relevant and \r\n  the subject of proper cross-examination, we cannot say the trial judge abused \r\n  his discretion in finding the probative value of this testimony outweighed the \r\n  danger for unfair prejudice.\"). We review a trial court's decision regarding \r\n  Rule 403 pursuant to the abuse of discretion standard and are obligated to give \r\n  great deference to the trial court's judgment. See Green, 887 \r\n  F.2d at 27. See also State v. Aleksey, Op. No. 25212 (S.C. Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed November 13, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 41 at 1)(trial judge is \r\n  given broad discretion in ruling on questions concerning relevancy of evidence, \r\n  and his decision will be reversed only if there is a clear abuse of discretion). \r\n  A trial judge's balancing decision under Rule 403 should not be reversed simply \r\n  because an appellate court believes it would have decided the matter otherwise \r\n  because of a differing view of the highly subjective factors of the probative \r\n  value or the prejudice presented by the evidence. United States v. Long, \r\n  574 F.2d 761 (3d Cir. 1978). If judicial self-restraint is ever desirable, it \r\n  is when a Rule 403 analysis of a trial court is reviewed by an appellate tribunal. \r\n  Id.\r\n\r\nThe federal appellate courts are deferential in \r\n  reviewing a trial judge's evidentiary rulings. See Salem v. United \r\n  States Lines Co., 370 U.S. 31, 82 S.Ct. 1119, 8 L.Ed.2d 313 (1962)(stating \r\n  the trial judge has broad discretion in the matter of the admission or exclusion \r\n  of expert evidence and his action is to be sustained unless manifestly erroneous); \r\n  United States v. Love, 134 F.3d 595, 603 (4th Cir. 1998)(reviewing a \r\n  district court's admission of evidence over a Rule 403 objection under a \"broadly \r\n  deferential standard\"); United States v. MacDonald, 688 F.2d 224, 227-28 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1982)(finding \"the appraisal of the probative and prejudicial value \r\n  of evidence under Rule 403 is entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial \r\n  judge; absent extraordinary circumstances, the Courts of Appeal will not intervene \r\n  in its resolution\"); United States v. Leon-Reyes, 177 F.3d 816, 819 (9th \r\n  Cir. 1999)(appellate court reviews district court's decision to admit or exclude \r\n  evidence utilizing an abuse of discretion standard); United States v. Jiminez, \r\n  224 F.3d 1243 (11th Cir. 2000)(reviewing the district court's ruling on admission \r\n  of evidence for abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\nUnder our broadly deferential standard of review, we find Dr. Rathle's testimony was not relevant.  Further, we rule that, even if relevant, the evidence should\r\nbe excluded under Rule 403, SCRE, as tending to confuse the jury.\r\n\r\nE.  Right to Present a Defense\r\n\r\nHamilton maintains the exclusion of Dr. Rathle's testimony deprived him of his constitutional right to fully present a defense.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe right to present a defense is not unlimited, \r\n  but must \"'bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial \r\n  process.'\" Rock v. Arkansas, 483 U.S. 44, 55, 107 S.Ct. 2704, 2711, 97 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 37, 49 (1987)(quoting Chambers v. Mississippi, 410 U.S. 284, \r\n  295, 93 S.Ct. 1038, 1046, 35 L.Ed.2d 297, 309 (1973)). While defendants are \r\n  entitled to a fair opportunity to present a defense, that right does not encompass \r\n  the right to present any evidence, regardless of its admissibility under the \r\n  rules of evidence. See United States v. Lancaster, 96 F.3d 734 \r\n  (4th Cir. 1996).\r\n\r\nII.  Solicitor's Comments During Closing Argument\r\n\r\nHamilton complains the trial judge erred in denying his motion for a mistrial based on the Solicitor's improper comments during the closing argument.\r\n\r\nDuring his closing argument, the Solicitor stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Solicitor]:  [L]adies and gentlemen, . . . I received good legal training at the start of my legal career.  I, like Ms. Quinn, who sits up there with Judge Manning,\r\nworked for a Circuit Court Judge and one thing he told me--\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Your Honor, I would object to that.  I don't know how that's relevant.\r\n\r\nThe Court:  Basis.  Basis of your objection.\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Well - - -\r\n\r\nThe Court:  Overruled. . . . .\r\n\r\n[Solicitor]:  Thank you, your Honor. . . . Mr. Hamilton has violated [the] laws.  He has violated our system of justice and he has asked you to be here.  Ladies\r\nand gentlemen, as the court knows, as our system of justice works, he decided on having a jury trial this week in this case.  He got up on the witness stand and\r\nsaid, \"I don't deny these charges.\"  We could have taken fifteen minutes on Monday morning and gotten rid of that.\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Your Honor, may we approach?\r\n\r\nThe Court:  Sure.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe judge conducted a bench conference.  Thereafter, the Solicitor continued his closing argument:\r\n\r\n\r\n[Solicitor]:  [The defense] tell[s] you this case is not about malice, that this is some type of borderline assault.  Well, ladies and gentlemen, you put me here as a\r\nrepresentative of your system of justice, a representative of your community, and I wouldn't bring in to you a borderline case.\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Your Honor, I object to that also.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this point, another bench conference was held.  The Solicitor then resumed his closing argument.\r\n\r\nA.  Preservation of Error\r\n\r\nHamilton avers the Solicitor improperly commented on Hamilton's exercise of his constitutional right to a jury trial.  The State contends any errors raised by\r\nHamilton in the bench conferences are off the record and, thus, not preserved.  The State further alleges the issue regarding improper argument is not preserved\r\nfor appellate review claiming that, although defense counsel stated \"I object to that also,\" she did not place the basis for the objection on the record.\r\n\r\n1.  Objection Made During Bench Conference\r\n\r\nAfter the judge's instructions to the jury, defense counsel requested an instruction explaining the Solicitor's comments regarding Hamilton's right to a jury trial. \r\nDefense counsel argued the jury needed to be informed that, contrary to the Solicitor's implication, Hamilton did not refuse to plead when given an opportunity. \r\nShe wanted the jury advised \"there were never any plea offers or negotiations or anything ever offered to [Hamilton].\"  The trial judge denied the request and\r\ndeclared: \"Actually, [defense counsel], I think you objected before that actually came out of his mouth, in terms of the guilty plea, although it came close.  It\r\nwas a timely objection.  We had a side-bar conference.  The Solicitor didn't go any further.\"  Defense counsel moved for a mistrial, which was denied.\r\n\r\nAn objection made during an off-the-record conference \r\n  which is not made part of the record does not preserve the question for review. \r\n  York v. Conway Ford, Inc., 325 S.C. 170, 480 S.E.2d 726 (1997). Here, \r\n  the initial off-the-record bench conferences were later made a part of the record \r\n  by the acquiescence and agreement of the judge, Solicitor, and defense counsel. \r\n  Under this scenario, York is inapplicable.\r\n\r\n2.  Objection Must Be on a Specific Ground\r\n\r\nIt is well settled that an objection must be on \r\n  a specific ground. State v. Nichols, 325 S.C. 111, 481 S.E.2d 118 (1997); \r\n  State v. New, 338 S.C. 313, 526 S.E.2d 237 (Ct. App. 1999). A general \r\n  objection which does not specify the particular ground on which the objection \r\n  is based is insufficient to preserve a question for review. State v. Patterson, \r\n  324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997). In order to preserve for review an alleged \r\n  error, the objection should be sufficiently specific to bring into focus the \r\n  precise nature of the alleged error so it can be reasonably understood by the \r\n  trial judge. New, 338 S.C. at 318, 526 S.E.2d at 239. See also \r\n  Campbell v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 301 S.C. 448, 392 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1990)(where \r\n  ground for objection is not stated in record, there is no basis for appellate \r\n  review). Rule 103(a)(1), SCRE, however, only requires specificity where the \r\n  ground for objection is not apparent from the context of the discussion contained \r\n  in the record. New, 338 S.C. at 318, 526 S.E.2d at 239.\r\n\r\nAs part of the first objection to the Solicitor's closing argument, defense counsel explained the basis of her objection was relevancy.  Her second objection\r\nreferred to the initial objection.  After the trial judge's instructions, defense counsel requested curative instructions.  Upon denial of the request, defense counsel\r\nmoved for a mistrial.  We hold the issue is preserved for our review.\r\n\r\nB.  The Test\r\n\r\nA Solicitor's closing argument must be carefully \r\n  tailored so it does not appeal to the personal biases of the jurors. State \r\n  v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996); State v. Linder, \r\n  276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981). Further, the argument may not be calculated \r\n  to arouse the jurors' passions or prejudices and its content should stay within \r\n  the record and its reasonable inferences. Simmons v. State, 331 S.C. \r\n  333, 503 S.E.2d 164 (1998). Moreover, the State cannot, through evidence or \r\n  argument, comment upon a defendant's exercise of a constitutional right. State \r\n  v. Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 323, 360 S.E.2d 317, 319 (1987)(\"When an accused \r\n  asserts a constitutional right, it is impermissible for the state to comment \r\n  upon or argue in favor of guilt or punishment based upon his assertion of that \r\n  right.\").\r\n\r\nThe test of granting a new trial for alleged improper \r\n  closing argument is whether the Solicitor's comments so infected the trial with \r\n  unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process. Darden \r\n  v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 106 S.Ct. 2464, 91 L.Ed.2d 144 (1986); Donnelly \r\n  v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974); State \r\n  v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997); State v. Coleman, \r\n  301 S.C. 57, 389 S.E.2d 659 (1990). See also State v. Brisbon, \r\n  323 S.C. 324, 474 S.E.2d 433 (1996)(test of granting new trial for alleged improper \r\n  closing argument of counsel is whether defendant was prejudiced to extent that \r\n  he was denied a fair trial).\r\n\r\nWe find the Solicitor's comments are highly inappropriate and constitutionally impermissible.\r\n\r\nC.  Harmless Error Analysis\r\n\r\nImproper comments during closing argument, however, \r\n  do not automatically require reversal of a conviction if they are not prejudicial \r\n  to the defendant. State v. Huggins, 325 S.C. 103, 481 S.E.2d 114 (1997); \r\n  State v. Primus, 341 S.C. 592, 535 S.E.2d 152 (Ct. App. 2000), cert. \r\n  granted. The harmless error rule governs improper comments made by a Solicitor \r\n  during closing argument. Primus, 341 S.C. at 608, 535 S.E.2d at 160. \r\n  It is the duty of a reviewing court to consider the trial record as a whole \r\n  and to ignore errors that are harmless, including most constitutional violations. \r\n  United States v. Hasting, 461 U.S. 499, 103 S.Ct. 1974, 76 L.Ed.2d 96 \r\n  (1983).\r\n\r\nThe trial judge is allowed wide discretion in dealing \r\n  with the range and propriety of argument of the Solicitor to the jury. State \r\n  v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 144 S.E.2d 481 (1965); State v. New, 338 \r\n  S.C. 313, 526 S.E.2d 237 (Ct. App. 1999). The defendant bears the burden of \r\n  proving the improper argument deprived him of a fair trial. Johnson v. State, \r\n  325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997); State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, \r\n  468 S.E.2d 620 (1996). See also Coleman, 301 S.C. at 61-62, 389 \r\n  S.E.2d at 661 (appellants bear burden of proving error and prejudice which resulted \r\n  in denial of fair trial). An appellate court will review the alleged impropriety \r\n  of the Solicitor's argument in the context of the entire record, including whether \r\n  there is overwhelming evidence of the defendant's guilt. See Simmons \r\n  v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 503 S.E.2d 164 (1998); State v. Linder, 276 \r\n  S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981).\r\n\r\nOfficers Jeter and Hopkins testified Hamilton assaulted Jeter and attempted to repeatedly assault him.  Hamilton admitted he stabbed Jeter.  Considering the\r\nState's closing argument in the context of the entire record, we find the court's error in allowing the Solicitor's improper comments during the jury argument\r\nwere harmless in light of the overwhelming evidence of Hamilton's guilt.  The Solicitor's comments did not infect Hamilton's trial with unfairness to the extent\r\nthat his conviction was a denial of due process.  Although we find the comments highly inappropriate, we affirm the trial judge's ruling under a harmless error\r\nanalysis.\r\n\r\nIII.  Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\n\r\nFinally, Hamilton argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to try him for possession of contraband because the indictment failed to specify that\r\nthe knife possessed by Hamilton had been declared contraband by the Director of the Department of Corrections.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThe indictment alleged \"Hamilton . . . did . . . unlawfully possess a quantity of contraband, to wit: a homemade knife approximately 12 inches long in violation\r\nof Â§ 24-3-950.\"  South Carolina Code Annotated section 24-3-950 (Supp. 2000) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\nIt shall be unlawful for any person to furnish or attempt to furnish any prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections with any matter declared\r\nby the director to be contraband.  It shall also be unlawful for any prisoner under the jurisdiction of the Department of Corrections to possess any matter\r\ndeclared to be contraband.  Matters considered contraband within the meaning of this section shall be those which are determined to be such by the director and\r\npublished by him in a conspicuous place available to visitors and inmates at each correctional institution.  Any person violating the provisions of this section\r\nshall be deemed guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be punished by a fine of not less than one thousand dollars nor more than ten thousand dollars or\r\nimprisonment for not less than one year nor more than ten years, or both.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn indictment survives legal scrutiny if the offense \r\n  is stated with sufficient certainty and particularity to enable the court to \r\n  know what judgment to pronounce, and the defendant to know what he is called \r\n  upon to answer and whether he may plead an acquittal or conviction thereon. \r\n  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998); State v. Ervin, \r\n  333 S.C. 351, 510 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1998). Under South Carolina Code Annotated \r\n  section 17-19-20, an indictment passes legal muster if it \"charges the crime \r\n  substantially in the language of the common law or of the statute prohibiting \r\n  the crime or so plainly that the nature of the offense charged may be easily \r\n  understood and, if the offense be a statutory offense, that the offense be alleged \r\n  to be contrary to the statute in such case made and provided.\" S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 17-19-20 (1985). See also State v. Tabory, 262 S.C. 136, 202 \r\n  S.E.2d 852 (1974)(indictment phrased substantially in language of statute which \r\n  creates and defines offense charged is ordinarily sufficient). An indictment \r\n  is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the defendant of the elements \r\n  of the offense intended to be charged and informs the defendant of the circumstances \r\n  he must be prepared to defend. Locke v. State, 341 S.C. 54, 533 S.E.2d \r\n  324 (2000).\r\n\r\nIn reviewing the sufficiency of an indictment, \r\n  an appellate court must \"look at the issue with a practical eye in view of the \r\n  surrounding circumstances.\" State v. Gunn, 313 S.C. 124, 129, 437 S.E.2d \r\n  75, 78 (1993). \r\n\r\nHamilton relies upon State v. Tabory, 262 \r\n  S.C. at 139-40, 202 S.E.2d at 853-54, to support his contention the indictment \r\n  was insufficient. Tabory is inapposite because the indictment in  \r\n  Tabory  did not charge a violation of the section relating to contraband.\r\n\r\nViewing the indictment \"with a practical eye,\" we find it stated the charge with sufficient certainty to enable both the trial court and Hamilton to know what\r\ncrime it alleged.  The indictment specifically identified the contraband involved, incorporated the statute, section 24-3-950, by reference, and named the offense\r\nin the title.  Under the circumstances of this case, we determine the indictment vested the trial court with subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold Dr. Rathle's testimony was not relevant.  Additionally, even if the testimony was relevant, the evidence should be excluded under Rule 403, SCRE, as\r\ntending to confuse the jury.  We rule the Solicitor's comments during closing argument were highly inappropriate.  We caution judges to strictly monitor the\r\nargument of Solicitors.  Given the overwhelming evidence of Hamilton's guilt and based on a review of the record as a whole, we conclude the Solicitor's\r\ncomments did not infect Hamilton's trial with unfairness so that he was denied a fair trial.  Thus, the trial court did not err in overruling defense counsel's\r\nobjections and motion for mistrial.  Finally, Hamilton's indictment was sufficient to convey subject matter jurisdiction on the court.

Sheldon on two charges of reckless homicide. \r\n  The State appeals the trial court's pre-trial decision to exclude a report by \r\n  the South Carolina Highway Patrol's Multi-disciplinary Accident Investigation \r\n  Team (MAIT). We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nOn October 10, 1996, Sheldon, a then on-duty South \r\nCarolina State Trooper, was driving his marked patrol vehicle when it collided \r\nwith a car driven by Rodney Stokes. Stokes and his wife, Wendy, died as a result \r\nof the collision. Although state law required the Orangeburg Sheriff's Office, \r\nrather than the Highway Patrol, investigate the collision, MAIT assisted in the \r\ninvestigation. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-765 (Supp. 2000). \r\nBefore trial, Sheldon moved to suppress any and \r\n  all evidence gathered or prepared by MAIT because such evidence was obtained \r\n  in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-765. After a hearing on the motion, the \r\n  trial court granted Sheldon's motion. The State appeals from that order. \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe trial court has considerable discretion in \r\n  ruling on the admissibility of evidence. State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, \r\n  529 S.E.2d 721 (2000). On appeal, the trial court's ruling will not be disturbed \r\n  absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion amounting to an error of law. Id.; \r\n  State v. Smicklevich, 268 S.C. 411, 234 S.E.2d 230 (1977).\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nThe State argues the trial court erred in excluding \r\n  the accident team's report. We agree.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the State Highway Patrol investigates \r\n  any collision involving a law enforcement vehicle that results in an injury \r\n  or death or involves a privately-owned vehicle. Â§ 56-5-765(A). However, such \r\n  collisions involving a vehicle of the Department of Public Safety, including \r\n  the Highway Patrol, must be investigated by the sheriff's office in the county \r\n  where the collision occurred. Â§ 56-5-765(B). Furthermore, a law enforcement \r\n  department or agency may not investigate any collision involving an employee \r\n  of that department or agency if the collision results in injury or death or \r\n  involves a privately-owned vehicle. Â§ 56-5-765(C).\r\n\r\nThe State asserts MAIT's investigation did not \r\n  violate Â§ 56-5-765 because it was \"not the type of investigation contemplated\" \r\n  by that section. It contends that the sheriff's office remained the investigating \r\n  agency, while MAIT merely performed technical portions of the investigation, \r\n  as the sheriff's office had neither the trained personnel nor the equipment \r\n  to conduct a detailed investigation of the dynamics of the collision. Further, \r\n  the State maintains the MAIT report takes into account only objective factors \r\n  which can be measured and replicated and makes no conclusions other than the \r\n  pre-impact speed of the vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe statute, however, clearly prohibits the Highway \r\n  Patrol from investigating accidents involving its employees. Â§ 56-5-765(B), \r\n  (C). There is no exception to this rule. We find the State's argument that MAIT's \r\n  investigation into this collision is not an \"investigation\" under Â§ 56-5-765 \r\n  unconvincing. While the Orangeburg Sheriff's Office may not have had the necessary \r\n  resources to perform the speed tests, it should have sought assistance elsewhere. \r\n  Thus, we agree with the trial court that MAIT's investigation of the collision \r\n  violated Â§ 56-5-765. \r\n\r\nWe next consider whether this violation of Â§ 56-5-765 \r\n  renders the results of the investigation inadmissible. Although Â§ 56-5-765 (D) \r\n  provides for criminal sanctions for a violation of the statute, the statute \r\n  is silent about the admissibility of evidence resulting from an investigation \r\n  made in violation of the statute. \r\n\r\n In the context of the application of the exclusionary \r\n  rule, our supreme court held the \"exclusion of evidence should be limited to \r\n  violations of constitutional rights and not to statutory violations, at least \r\n  where the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice at trial resulting from the \r\n  failure to follow statutory procedures.\" State v. Chandler, 267 S.C. \r\n  138, 226 S.E.2d 553 (1976). We hold evidence obtained in violation of Â§ 56-5-765 \r\n  is not necessarily inadmissible absent a demonstration of prejudice resulting \r\n  from the violation.\r\n\r\nUpon finding a violation of the statute, the trial \r\n  court suppressed the MAIT report. It did not make any findings on whether Sheldon \r\n  would be prejudiced by MAIT's investigation of the collision. The trial court, \r\n  thus, committed an error of law, amounting to an abuse of discretion. We, therefore, \r\n  reverse the order of the trial court suppressing the MAIT report and remand \r\n  to the trial court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3319","title":"Breeden v.

James Breeden, \r\n  Jr. cross-appeals asserting that the circuit court did not have jurisdiction \r\n  to hear Employer's and Carrier's appeal from the full commission because their \r\n  notice of intent to appeal was deficient. As to Employer's and Carrier's appeal, \r\n  we affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand. As to Breeden's cross-appeal, \r\n  we affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nOn December 14, 1993, Breeden was severely injured when \r\n  a truck owned by Piggly Wiggly crossed the center line and hit Breeden's truck \r\n  head on. At the time of the accident Breeden was an owner/operator driving under \r\n  Employer's ICC license. Breeden filed a workers' compensation claim which Employer \r\n  denied on the theory that Breeden was an independent contractor, not an employee. \r\n  The single commissioner found Breeden was an employee, and the full commission \r\n  affirmed. Employer and Carrier did not appeal further. Workers' compensation \r\n  benefits were brought current and provided thereafter. \r\n\r\nOn July 28, 1995, Breeden filed another Form 50 alleging \r\n  he was totally disabled as a result of traumatic physical brain injury. The \r\n  single commissioner found for Breeden and awarded lifetime benefits pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§&nbsp;42-9-10 (Supp. 2000). Employer and Carrier did not \r\n  appeal this decision. \r\n\r\nDuring this same time, Breeden pursued a third party claim \r\n  against Piggly Wiggly. Piggly Wiggly's liability carrier advanced $50,000 to \r\n  help defray expenses, including living expenses, for Breeden's family. This \r\n  was done with Carrier's consent and with the understanding that this money would \r\n  be included as part of the ultimate settlement. Piggly Wiggly had $11&nbsp;million \r\n  in liability insurance coverage, and the parties acknowledge that liability \r\n  was clear. Breeden alleged economic losses alone that were over $9 million including \r\n  future medical expenses and a range of total cognizable damages from $18 to \r\n  $25 million. However, no lawsuit was ever filed against Piggly Wiggly, and Mr. \r\n  Breeden's claim was settled for $4.2 million while his wife's loss of consortium \r\n  claim was settled for $1.8 million. The Breedens' attorney explained that the \r\n  claims were settled for such a low sum compared to the amount of insurance available \r\n  and the extent of provable damages because \"[w]e had to. This family was coming \r\n  apart at the seams.\" \r\n\r\nSubsequent to settling the third party claim against Piggly \r\n  Wiggly, Breeden notified the workers' compensation commission of the settlement \r\n  and moved to have the commission determine Carrier's lien and the balance remaining \r\n  to be paid to Carrier under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(g) (1985). At the hearing, \r\n  Breeden took the position that Carrier's lien should be reduced using the total \r\n  cognizable damages provision of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f). Both sides introduced \r\n  detailed life care plans projecting Breeden's future medical needs. \r\n\r\nThe single commissioner found that Breeden was not entitled \r\n  to a lien reduction and ordered the proceeds from the third party claim distributed \r\n  in accordance with section 42-1-560(g). He also found section 42-1-560(f) relating \r\n  to total cognizable damages was not applicable and did not impact the provisions \r\n  of 42-1-560(g). Additionally, he held \"compensation\" as used in section 42-1-560 \r\n  to include all future medical expenses. The single commissioner awarded Breeden's \r\n  attorneys $1,456,626 in fees and litigation expenses and ordered $801,713.81 \r\n  be paid to Carrier for its lien to date. He ordered the balance of the $4.2 \r\n  million settlement paid to Carrier to hold in trust until further order of the \r\n  commission. The single commissioner then ordered Dr.&nbsp;Weed, Breeden's life \r\n  care plan expert, to update the life care plan and provide it to an insurance \r\n  annuities expert. The expert was ordered to determine the cost to annuitize \r\n  future benefits, including future medical expenses, using rated age costs and \r\n  an installment refund feature. The single commissioner then directed that this \r\n  information would be utilized to determine the present value of future benefits. \r\n  Carrier would be allowed to retain that amount and the balance would be paid \r\n  to Breeden. \r\n\r\nBreeden appealed to the full commission which reversed virtually \r\n  every holding by the single commissioner. The full commission found that it \r\n  would be appropriate under the statutory scheme to utilize the concept of total \r\n  cognizable damages and determined them to be $13.5 million. The commission then \r\n  found that the lien should be reduced, applying the factors from Kirkland&nbsp;v. \r\n  Allcraft Steel Co., 329 S.C. 389, 496 S.E.2d 624 (1998). Using these factors, \r\n  the full commission reduced the Carrier's lien to 31% of what it found its current \r\n  value to be, applied the same reduction to future compensation, and held that \r\n  Carrier's lien did not apply to future medical expenses. Carrier appealed to \r\n  the circuit court which affirmed the full commission. \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n    Employer/Carrier's Appeal  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I. Did the full commission err in its application of the \r\n    Kirkland factors when it determined that Carrier's lien should be reduced?\r\n\r\n  II. Did the full commission err in applying the lien reduction \r\n    to future compensation?\r\n\r\n  III. Did the full commission err in determining that under \r\n    section 42-1-560 Carrier's lien did not include future medical expenses not \r\n    yet incurred at the time of the third party settlement? \r\n\r\n  IV. Did the full commission err in freezing the lien to \r\n    its current amount of $801,713.81?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Breeden's Cross-Appeal \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court have jurisdiction to hear Employer's \r\n    and Carrier's appeal because their notice of intent to appeal was defective?\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nBreeden's Cross-Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n    Jurisdiction of the Circuit Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his cross-appeal, Breeden asserts the circuit court did \r\n  not have jurisdiction to address the order of the full commission because Employer's \r\n  and Carrier's notice of intent to appeal was deficient. We find this argument \r\n  to be without merit.\r\n\r\nBreeden contends Employer's and Carrier's notice of intent \r\n  to appeal did not comply with the requirements of the Administrative Procedures \r\n  Act because the grounds listed for alleged error did not reflect a complete \r\n  explanation of the alleged error. As support for this contention, Breeden cites \r\n  Pringle v. Builder's Transport, which provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  A petition for circuit court review pursuant to the Administrative \r\n    Procedures Act (APA) must direct the court's attention to the abuse allegedly \r\n    committed below, including a distinct and specific statement of the rulings \r\n    of which appellant complains. The circuit court lacks jurisdiction of the \r\n    appeal if the notice is insufficient. \r\n\r\n\r\n298 S.C. 494, 495, 381 S.E.2d \r\n  731, 732 (1989) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\nThe notice of intent to appeal contains twelve exceptions \r\n  to the order of the commission. We have reviewed these twelve exceptions and \r\n  hold that they were sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the APA. They \r\n  are clear as to what the commission ordered and as to the error assigned to \r\n  the provisions of the order. Therefore, we hold the notice of appeal was sufficient \r\n  and the circuit court had jurisdiction over this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Employer/Carrier's Appeal  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I. Kirkland \r\n    Factors \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nEmployer and Carrier argue the commission erred in incorrectly \r\n  applying the Kirkland factors when it determined Carrier's lien should \r\n  be reduced. We agree.\r\n\r\nIn all cases involving the distribution of third party proceeds, \r\n  the threshold issue is whether the carrier's lien should be reduced. Section \r\n  42-1-560(f) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding other provisions of this item, where an \r\n    employee or his representative enters into a settlement with or obtains a \r\n    judgment upon trial from a third party in an amount less than the amount of \r\n    the employee's estimated total damages, the commission may reduce the amount \r\n    of the carrier's lien on the proceeds of such settlement in the proportion \r\n    that such settlement or judgment bears to the commission's evaluation of the \r\n    employee's total cognizable damages at law. Any such reduction shall be based \r\n    on a determination by the commission that such reduction would be equitable \r\n    to all parties concerned and serve the interests of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f) (1985). \r\n\r\nIn Kirkland, our supreme court recognized that the \r\n  commission may reduce the carrier's lien in the manner set forth in the above \r\n  statute, but the reduction is not automatic. 329 S.C. at 394, 496 S.E.2d at \r\n  626. In Kirkland, the court listed four factors the commission should \r\n  consider in deciding whether or in what amount to reduce the lien. The court \r\n  held that \"[i]n considering whether or not to reduce the lien, the commission \r\n  may consider factors such as the strength of the claimant's case, the likelihood \r\n  of third party liability, claimant's desire to settle, and whether carrier is \r\n  unreasonably refusing to consent to a settlement.\" Id. These factors \r\n  all focus on the circumstances surrounding the third party settlement.\r\nEmployer and Carrier contend that in determining whether \r\n  to authorize a reduction of Carrier's lien, the commission erred in failing \r\n  to properly analyze the factors set out in Kirkland. To an extent, we \r\n  agree.\r\n\r\nThe first Kirkland factor analyzed by the commission \r\n  was the likelihood of third party liability. The commission found:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Kirkland provides no guidance as to how this factor \r\n    is to be considered. However, it is only appropriate that the strong likelihood \r\n    of Third Party's liability lends support to reducing the Carrier's lien. The \r\n    weaker the case of third party liability, it is more likely it would be that \r\n    any portion of the third party monies actually received by the Claimant would \r\n    be a windfall to him. Conversely, the stronger the Claimant's case, the more \r\n    equitable it would be for he or his family to receive a greater portion of \r\n    the economic consequences of his tragic injury. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe this rationale to be the opposite of the court's \r\n  intent in Kirkland. In actuality, the stronger the likelihood of third \r\n  party liability, the less weight the commission should give to the claimant's \r\n  request for a reduction in the lien. The employer should not have to shoulder \r\n  an undue proportion of the burden of liability for claimant's damages when a \r\n  third party has unquestioned liability for the claimant's injuries. Therefore, \r\n  as the likelihood of the liability of a third party increases, the justification \r\n  for reducing the carrier's lien is proportionately reduced. Since there is little \r\n  if any question as to Piggly Wiggly's liability in this case, we find this factor's \r\n  weight militates against a reduction in the lien.\r\n\r\nThe next factor in Kirkland is the strength of claimant's \r\n  case. We hold the full commission also applied this factor in a manner opposite \r\n  to that intended in Kirkland. \r\n\r\nThe commission found this factor weighed toward reduction \r\n  because Breeden's total cognizable damages were great. Because liability was \r\n  clear, damages were the primary issue in Breeden's case against Piggly Wiggly. \r\n  Breeden had a strong case against Piggly Wiggly with excellent proof of substantial \r\n  damages. However, Breeden settled his third party claim much lower than his \r\n  actual provable damages. The fact that he had a strong case, yet settled for \r\n  such a relatively low amount, militates against lien reduction. The Employer/Carrier, \r\n  having no right to involve itself in the third party action, should not be penalized \r\n  because the case was undervalued or for whatever other reason, valid or not, \r\n  was not aggressively pursued. Again, this factor's weight militates against \r\n  a reduction in the lien.\r\n\r\nThe third Kirkland factor addressed by the full commission \r\n  is the claimant's desire to settle. This factor relates to the need or desire \r\n  of the claimant to settle his claim against the third party, not against the \r\n  employer or its carrier. Testimony was presented that it was desirable for Breeden \r\n  to settle his third party claim against Piggly Wiggly because his \"family was \r\n  coming apart at the seams.\" Therefore, we find that while Breeden settled for \r\n  an amount substantially smaller than he possibly could have obtained, this factor \r\n  weighs favorably toward a reduction in the lien.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and final Kirkland factor is whether the \r\n  carrier is unreasonably refusing to consent to the settlement. The commission \r\n  interpreted this factor to mean whether the carrier is unreasonably refusing \r\n  to settle its lien against the proceeds of the third party settlement. This \r\n  is incorrect. As pointed out above, the factors in Kirkland focus on \r\n  the circumstances surrounding the third party settlement, not the workers' compensation \r\n  lien. This factor actually relates to a provision in section 42-1-560(f) that \r\n  provides: \"[t]he carrier shall not unreasonably refuse to approve a proposed \r\n  compromise settlement with the third party.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f) (1985). \r\n  It is clear from the record that Carrier interposed no objection to the settlement \r\n  of the third party claim. Therefore, the weight of this factor also militates \r\n  against a reduction in the lien. \r\n\r\nIn addition to the Kirkland factors, the full commission \r\n  included three other factors in its analysis of whether to allow a lien reduction \r\n  and to what degree to reduce Carrier's lien. These factors were: (1) Carrier's \r\n  conduct in fulfilling its statutory obligations; (2) the extent of Breeden's \r\n  injuries; and (3) whether Carrier has an actual exposure. While we are certain \r\n  the four factors set forth in Kirkland are not exclusive, the additional \r\n  factors analyzed by the commission are not mentioned in Kirkland. \r\n\r\nHowever, we find two of the three additional factors utilized \r\n  by the commission are not relevant to the consideration of the lien reduction. \r\n  Carrier's conduct in fulfilling its statutory obligations has no bearing on \r\n  settlement of the third party claim. There has been no evidence presented that \r\n  any act or omission of Carrier prejudiced Breeden's settlement in any manner. \r\n  Likewise, whether Carrier has an actual exposure is not relevant to the determination \r\n  of a lien reduction and has no bearing on the third party settlement. The fact \r\n  that a carrier is re-insured on a claim has nothing to do with the third party \r\n  settlement. Furthermore, a carrier has a right to purchase reinsurance and be \r\n  covered by it without that bearing upon the determination of whether a claimant \r\n  is entitled to a lien reduction. \r\n\r\nWe do, however, find that the extent of Breeden's injuries \r\n  should be considered as a factor in determining whether he is entitled to a \r\n  reduction in the lien. There is no doubt that Breeden is severely injured both \r\n  mentally and physically, and the damages he has suffered will run into the millions \r\n  of dollars. This factor could, of course, be considered as a subset of the analysis \r\n  as to the strength of claimant's case. To the extent that it is considered as \r\n  a separate factor, we hold it should be analyzed in the same fashion as the \r\n  strength of claimant's case factor. \r\n\r\nDue to the seriousness of Breeden's injuries and his legitimate \r\n  desire to settle for the sake of his family, we find a reduction of Carrier's \r\n  lien is warranted. However, we believe the analysis employed by the full commission \r\n  in connection with the Kirkland factors to be erroneous and most probably \r\n  resulted in an excessive reduction. Therefore, we remand this issue to the full \r\n  commission to make a determination on the percentage by which the lien should \r\n  be reduced in light of the total cognizable damages, applying the Kirkland \r\n  factors as set out above. (1) \r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Application of Lien Reduction to Future Compensation \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Employer and Carrier contend the full commission \r\n  erred in applying the lien reduction to future compensation. They assert that \r\n  because distribution of third party proceeds is governed by section 42-1-560(g), \r\n  section 42-1-560(f) does not apply and a lien reduction may not be made to future \r\n  compensation. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSection 42-1-560(f), in pertinent part, speaks in terms \r\n  of \"estimated total damages\" and \"total cognizable damages at law.\" S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(f) (1985). Section 42-1-560(g) provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  When there remains a balance of five thousand dollars or \r\n    more of the amount recovered from a third party by the beneficiary or carrier \r\n    after payment of necessary expenses, and satisfaction of the carrier's lien \r\n    and payment of the share of any person not a beneficiary under this Title, \r\n    which is applicable as a credit against future compensation benefits for the \r\n    same injury or death under either subsection (b) or subsection (c) of this \r\n    section, the entire balance shall in the first instance be paid to the carrier \r\n    by the third party. The present value of all amounts estimated by the Industrial \r\n    Commission to be thereafter payable as compensation, with the present value \r\n    to be computed in accordance with a schedule prepared by the Industrial Commission, \r\n    shall be held by the carrier as a fund to pay future compensation as it becomes \r\n    due, and to pay any sum finally remaining in excess thereof to the beneficiaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(g) (1985). \r\n\r\nEmployer and Carrier assert that these sections cannot be \r\n  read together because section 42-1-560(g) only specifically incorporates sections \r\n  (b) and (c). They further contend there is a conflict between these sections \r\n  and the rules of statutory construction require the subsequent provision, (g), \r\n  to prevail over the prior one, (f). See Nat'l Adver. Co. v. Mount \r\n  Pleasant Bd. of Adjustment, 312 S.C. 397, 400, 440 S.E.2d 875, 877 (1994) \r\n  (stating where conflicting statutory provisions exist, the most recent or last \r\n  in order of arrangement prevails).\r\n\r\nHowever, we see no conflict in these provisions. \"If the \r\n  provisions of the two statutes can be construed so that both can stand, this \r\n  Court will so construe them.\" In the Interest of Shaw, 274 S.C. 534, \r\n  539, 265 S.E.2d 522, 524 (1980). Section 42-1-560(f) provides for a lien reduction \r\n  if a claimant \"enters into a settlement with or obtains a judgment upon trial \r\n  from a third party in an amount less than the amount of the employee's estimated \r\n  total damages.\" Section 42-1-560(g) governs the method of distributing excess \r\n  proceeds from a third party judgment or settlement when future compensation \r\n  will be owed to the claimant. The carrier retains the present value of future \r\n  compensation and establishes a fund by which it pays future compensation benefits \r\n  as they come due. Nothing in the distribution scheme set out in section (g) \r\n  conflicts with the ability of the commission to reduce the entire carrier's \r\n  lien. Section (g) may still be applied after a lien reduction under section \r\n  (f) has been ordered. Furthermore, the clear language of section (f) indicates \r\n  that the lien reduction should apply to future compensation benefits because \r\n  it refers to the \"employee's estimated total damages.\" The fact that these damages \r\n  are to be estimated clearly contemplates that at least some of them have not \r\n  yet accrued but will in the future. Therefore, the lien reduction is based on \r\n  the whole of the damages that the claimant has and will suffer--past, present, \r\n  and future--and should be applied as such.\r\n\r\n\r\n    III. Future Medical Expenses \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nNext, Employer and Carrier argue the commission erred in \r\n  determining that under section 42-1-560 Carrier's lien does not encumber future \r\n  medical expenses which have not been incurred at the time of the third party \r\n  settlement. We agree.\r\n\r\nEmployer and Carrier contend \"compensation\" as it appears \r\n  in section 42-1-560(g) means both income benefits and medically related benefits. \r\n  Therefore, they assert that under section 42-1-560(g) medical expenses yet to \r\n  be incurred by Breeden should also be considered part of Carrier's lien for \r\n  the purpose of establishing a fund from settlement proceeds to pay future medical \r\n  expenses. As support for this argument, Employer and Carrier point to the fact \r\n  that the third party recovery statute, 42-1-560, was adopted from the Model \r\n  Act which includes future medical expenses in its definition of compensation, \r\n  and that for the purposes of section 42-1-560 the legislature expanded the definition \r\n  of \"compensation\" to conform with the Model Act. Additionally, they argue it \r\n  would be inequitable to allow Breeden to receive all of his medical expenses \r\n  from Carrier on the one hand and use the same medical expenses to justify recovery \r\n  from the third party on the other. \r\n\r\nBreeden argues, and the commission found, that this argument \r\n  is incorrect as the word \"compensation\" is specifically defined by the legislature \r\n  in section 42-1-100 as \"the money allowance payable to an employee or to his \r\n  dependents as provided for in this Title and includes funeral benefits provided \r\n  in this Title.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-100 (1985). He contends this definition, \r\n  and not the definition found in the Model Act, is controlling and further notes \r\n  that in section 42-1-560 (a), (b), and (c), the statute refers to \"the right \r\n  to compensation and other benefits under this Title.\" Therefore, he argues, \r\n  the legislature meant to specifically exclude those \"other benefits\" from section \r\n  42-1-560(g) because it failed to mention them as it did in other provisions \r\n  of the same section. \r\n\r\nWe agree with Employer and Carrier that the legislature \r\n  intended future medicals to be included in the calculation of the value of Carrier's \r\n  lien for the purpose of establishing a fund from excess third party settlement \r\n  proceeds to pay future medical compensation benefits. We hold this to be so \r\n  for two compelling reasons. \r\n\r\nFirst, the language employed by the legislature in adopting \r\n  the third party liability section of our Act, closely paralleling the language \r\n  of the Model Act, leads us to the conclusion that the legislative intent was \r\n  for compensation as used in section 42-1-560(g) to include both monetary benefits \r\n  and medical benefits as it does in the definition section of the Model Act. \r\n  While it is true that upon adopting the portions of the Model Act the legislature \r\n  did not amend the definition of compensation as contained in section 42-1-100, \r\n  it did specifically provide, in subsection (b), that the carrier's lien shall \r\n  extend to the proceeds of recovery \"to the extent of the total amount of compensation, \r\n  including medical and other expenses, paid, or to be paid by such carrier . \r\n  . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-560(b) (1985). Therefore, the legislature clearly \r\n  intended for the carrier's lien to extend to medical expenses \"to be paid in \r\n  the future.\" \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and \r\n  effectuate the legislative intent whenever possible.\" Strother v. Lexington \r\n  County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 62, 504 S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998). \r\n\r\n Second, as a matter of policy, it would be inequitable \r\n  to allow a claimant to recover an award from a third party based on damages \r\n  including future medical expenses and then require the carrier to pay those \r\n  same medical expenses which claimant has already recovered without contribution \r\n  from the third party proceeds. This would result in a double recovery for the \r\n  claimant. Our courts have consistently held that there can be no double recovery \r\n  for a single injury. See Collins Music Co. v. Smith, 332 S.C. \r\n  145, 147, 503 S.E.2d 481, 482 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n\r\nThis conclusion comports with the views of Professor Larson \r\n  in his well-respected and oft-quoted work on workers' compensation wherein he \r\n  stated that this \"is the correct result even if the reimbursement provision \r\n  speaks only of 'compensation' paid.\" 6 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larson's \r\n  Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 117.03 (2000). \r\n\r\nFor these reasons, we find that the legislature intended \r\n  future medicals to be included in the calculation of the value of Carrier's \r\n  lien for the purpose of establishing a fund from excess third party settlement \r\n  proceeds to pay future medical benefits. The circuit court erred in affirming \r\n  the full commission's determination that under section 42-1-560(g) Carrier's \r\n  lien does not include future medical expenses which have not yet been incurred \r\n  at the time of the third party settlement. \r\n\r\nThis case should be remanded for a determination by the \r\n  full commission as to the present-day value of future benefits, including medical \r\n  expenses, for the purpose of establishing a fund from excess third party settlement \r\n  proceeds to pay future compensation benefits. Additionally, in light of our \r\n  finding that a lien reduction applies to future damages as well as past and \r\n  present damages, the full commission should, upon determining the value of Carrier's \r\n  future lien, reduce that lien by a percentage not to exceed the percentage by \r\n  which it determines to reduce Carrier's current lien.\r\n\r\n\r\n    IV. Value of Current Lien\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Employer and Carrier assert the full commission \r\n  erred in freezing the current lien amount at $801,713.81. In light of our disposition \r\n  of the above issues, we agree.\r\n\r\nBreeden's damages are ever increasing. They have certainly \r\n  increased since the time of the full commission's hearing. Because we are remanding \r\n  this case to the full commission to determine the proper amount for the lien \r\n  reduction based on the Kirkland factors and to include future medical \r\n  expenses in Carrier's lien, the full commission should bring the amount of Carrier's \r\n  current lien up to date to reflect this increase.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nBased on our determination that the circuit court erred \r\n  in affirming the full commission's order which improperly analyzed the factors \r\n  for lien reduction in Kirkland and failed to include future medical expenses \r\n  in determining the value of Carrier's lien, we affirm in part, reverse in part, \r\n  and remand this case to the full commission to determine the amount by which \r\n  Carrier's lien should be reduced, include future medical expenses in the value \r\n  of Carrier's lien, and bring the value of Carrier's present lien up to date. \r\n  \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit court \r\n  is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., and GOOLSBY, J., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  We offer no opinion as to what relative \r\n  weight the commission may give to any of the factors employed, and we do not \r\n  believe it is necessary to give equal weight to each applicable factor. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3320","title":"Dowaliby v.

Dowaliby's brother, appellant Robert J. Chambless, opposed the petitions. \r\nThe probate court found Thelma Chambless was in need of a guardian and appointed \r\nRobert Chambless, but determined a conservatorship was unnecessary. The probate \r\ncourt awarded attorney's fees to Dowaliby, which the circuit court affirmed. Robert \r\nChambless appeals on behalf of his mother, challenging the award of attorney's \r\nfees. We reverse. \r\n\r\n    FACTS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nThis appeal arises from a dispute between siblings \r\n  Marilu Dowaliby and Robert J. Chambless over the care of their mother, Thelma \r\n  Chambless. On June 11, 1998, Dowaliby filed separate petitions in the Charleston \r\n  County Probate Court seeking the appointment of a guardian and a conservator \r\n  for Thelma Chambless. Dowaliby alleged her mother was suffering from dementia \r\n  and was incapacitated. In the petitions, Dowaliby asked that she be appointed \r\n  as guardian and conservator. \r\n\r\nRobert Chambless, as next of kin, filed an answer \r\n  and counterclaim to Dowaliby's petitions admitting their mother suffered from \r\n  dementia and was unable to manage her own affairs. However, he denied the need \r\n  for the appointment of a conservator, stating their mother had set up an independent \r\n  trust on April 23, 1994, appointing him to be the trustee in the event of her \r\n  incapacity. (1) Also on April 23, 1994, Thelma \r\n  Chambless executed a durable power of attorney in favor of her son, Robert, \r\n  as well as a will naming him the executor. Robert Chambless attached copies \r\n  of the trust, the power of attorney, and the will to his answer. \r\n\r\nChambless asserted their mother had transferred \r\n  to the trust the deeds to her real property prior to becoming incapacitated \r\n  and that all liquid assets were being held in the trust for the purpose of their \r\n  mother's lifetime care. He asked that their mother be declared incompetent and \r\n  that the court recognize the validity of the trust, or that the court \"appoint \r\n  himself or some other uninterested party as a Conservator in the event it is \r\n  determined that the Thelma I. Chambless Trust is for some reason not satisfactory \r\n  in taking care of his mother.\" Chambless asserted he should be appointed conservator \r\n  because he had cared for their mother prior to her being placed in a nursing \r\n  home, and because Dowaliby had been living out of state for years and was not \r\n  a proper person to handle their mother's financial affairs. Chambless asked \r\n  that Dowaliby's petitions be dismissed and that Dowaliby pay attorney's fees \r\n  and costs for his defense of the trust. \r\n\r\nBy order dated February 3, 1999, the probate court \r\n  found \"clear and convincing evidence that Thelma I. Chambless is an incapacitated \r\n  person\" and found good cause to appoint Robert Chambless as the sole guardian. \r\n  (2) In a separate order, the probate court denied the petition for \r\n  appointment of a conservator finding it was unnecessary because Thelma Chambless \r\n  had placed her assets in the trust dated April 23, 1994. The court determined \r\n  the trust and its named trustee, Robert Chambless, were valid and concluded \r\n  there was \"no rationale for supplementing its terms with a Court appointed Conservator.\" \r\n  The probate court reserved the issues of attorney's fees and costs \"for further \r\n  hearing if necessary.\" \r\n\r\nDowaliby's attorney subsequently filed a petition \r\n  seeking $7,427.05 in attorney's fees allegedly incurred on behalf of Thelma \r\n  Chambless. Dowaliby's attorney submitted invoices and an affidavit in support \r\n  of the award. \r\n\r\nThe probate court awarded Dowaliby attorney's fees \r\n  of $4,427.05. In so doing, the probate court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  There is South Carolina case law precedent that \r\n    allows expenditures for reasonable necessities of a ward even if the expenses \r\n    occurred before the appointment of a guardian. (citations omitted). \r\n\r\n\r\nThe probate court found Dowaliby's petitions benefitted \r\n  Thelma Chambless because a guardian was appointed to provide for her care, comfort, \r\n  and maintenance, and the guardian was required to consult with and/or inform \r\n  her daughter and grandchildren regarding health care and placement decisions. \r\n  The court found Thelma Chambless was further benefitted by the court's validation \r\n  of the trust.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court affirmed the award, and Chambless \r\n  appeals. \r\n\r\n\r\n    LAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Chambless asserts Dowaliby is not entitled \r\n  to an award of attorney's fees.\r\n\r\nIt is well established that \"[a]ttorney's fees \r\n  are not recoverable unless authorized by contract or statute.\" Jackson v. \r\n  Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 307, 486 S.E.2d 750, 759 (1997); see Blumberg \r\n  v. Nealco, Inc., 310 S.C. 492, 493, 427 S.E.2d 659, 660 (1993) (\"The general \r\n  rule is that attorney's fees are not recoverable unless authorized by contract \r\n  or statute.\"); Duke Power Co. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 284 \r\n  S.C. 81, 100, 326 S.E.2d 395, 406 (1985) (\"Ordinarily, an attorney must look \r\n  to his client for compensation for services performed by his employment\" unless \r\n  authorized by contract or statute.); Prevatte v. Asbury Arms, 302 S.C. \r\n  413, 415, 396 S.E.2d 642, 643 (Ct. App. 1990) (\"Under the common law of South \r\n  Carolina, a prevailing party has no right to recover attorney's fees. In the \r\n  absence of a common law right, the plaintiff must plead either a contract or \r\n  a statute to receive enhanced damages or attorney's fees.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\r\nBecause there is no contractual provision at issue \r\n  here, we must determine whether there is a statutory basis for Dowaliby to recover \r\n  attorney's fees. (3) Dowaliby argues the award \r\n  of attorney's fees is authorized by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-414 (1987), which \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  If not otherwise compensated for services rendered, \r\n    any visitor, lawyer, physician, conservator, or special conservator appointed \r\n    in a protective proceeding is entitled to reasonable compensation from \r\n    the estate, as determined by the court.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-414 (1987) (emphasis added). \r\n  \r\n\r\n\"A statute allowing attorney fees is in derogation \r\n  of the common law and must be strictly construed.\" Belton v. State, 339 \r\n  S.C. 71, 74, 529 S.E.2d 4, 5 (2000); accord Steinert v. Lanter, \r\n  284 S.C. 65, 325 S.E.2d 532 (1985) (holding statute allowing recovery of costs \r\n  was in derogation of the common law and therefore must be strictly construed \r\n  to allow only the recovery of costs and not attorney's fees); Flynn v. Scott, \r\n  969 S.W.2d 260 (Mo. Ct. App. 1998) (holding attorney was not entitled to recover \r\n  fees absent statutory authorization); In re Guardianship of the Person &amp; \r\n  Estate of Jacobsen, 482 N.W.2d 634 (S.D. 1992) (holding that party unsuccessfully \r\n  petitioning to be named guardian could not recover attorney's fees under a statute \r\n  allowing recovery of attorney's fees as necessary expense for the care and management \r\n  of the estate where said party had not undertaken the care and management of \r\n  the estate and the court was \"unable to find any precise authority allowing \r\n  attorney's fees to petitioners in guardianship proceedings\").\r\n\r\nThe plain language of section 62-5-414 authorizes \r\n  reasonable compensation to lawyers that are \"appointed\" in protective proceedings. \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-414 (1987). Dowaliby's attorney was never appointed to \r\n  represent Thelma Chambless. Rather, the probate court appointed Ruth Williams \r\n  Cupp as Thelma Chambless's attorney and guardian ad litem for these proceedings. \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-303(b) (1987) (providing that unless the allegedly \r\n  incapacitated person has her own counsel the probate court shall appoint an \r\n  attorney to represent her in the proceedings who shall also act as the guardian \r\n  ad litem). (4) \r\n\r\nAccordingly, because we can find no statutory basis \r\n  for an award of attorney's fees to Dowaliby, the probate court's award of attorney's \r\n  fees must be reversed. See First Union Nat'l Bank of South Carolina \r\n  v. FCVS Communications, 328 S.C. 290, 494 S.E.2d 429 (1997) (reversing award \r\n  of attorney's fees because the attorney's fees were not authorized by contract \r\n  or statute); South Carolina Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Tharp, 312 S.C. 243, \r\n  439 S.E.2d 854 (1994) (holding it was error to award attorney's fees without \r\n  statutory authority).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  CONCLUSION \r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the award of attorney's \r\n  fees to Dowaliby is \r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nCURETON and GOOLSBY, JJ., concur. \r\n1.  The Thelma I. Chambless \r\n  Trust included assets such as Thelma Chambless's personal residence (valued \r\n  at $85,000), some home furnishings, and investments of approximately $40,000. \r\n  The total estate was valued at about $137,000. \r\n 2.  The probate court specifically \r\n  found Robert Chambless had fulfilled the role of de facto guardian for his mother \r\n  for \"at least the last four or five years if not longer,\" had assisted her in \r\n  making medical decisions, and had provided care to her both in her own home \r\n  and his before making a placement decision. \r\n 3. It is undisputed that Dowaliby's \r\n  attorney did not enter into a contract with Thelma Chambless or her estate to \r\n  provide legal services. \r\n4.  Furthermore, Dowaliby is \r\n  not seeking expenses incurred prior to her appointment as guardian or conservator, \r\n  as she was never appointed to either position. This situation is, therefore, \r\n  distinguishable from the cases cited by the probate court and the circuit court, \r\n  which provide an appointed guardian may be able to recover expenses incurred \r\n  prior to the formal appointment if such expenditures benefitted the ward. Moreover, \r\n  the probate court determined Robert Chambless, not Dowaliby, was acting as Thelma \r\n  Chambless's guardian for \"at least the last four or five years\" prior to this \r\n  proceeding.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3321","title":"Andrade v.

Brent Kiker and Anne S. Douds, both of Kiker \r\n          &amp; Douds, of Beaufort, for appellant.\r\n\r\n        A. Parker Barnes, Jr., and David S. Black, both \r\n          of A.&nbsp;Parker Barnes, Jr. &amp; Associates, of Beaufort, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J.: In this action alleging \r\n  negligence, violation of the South Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \r\n  Act (UTPA), fraud, and breach of contract, June Andrade appeals the trial court's \r\n  order which: (1) dismissed her action against South Carolina Electric &amp; \r\n  Gas which was based on its vicarious or derivative liability due to the negligence \r\n  of the installer; (2) held SCE&amp;G exempt from the UTPA; and (3) directed \r\n  a verdict against her on the negligence claims against SCE&amp;G. We affirm \r\n  in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1994, June Andrade decided to replace \r\n  the existing heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in her \r\n  Beaufort townhouse and selected two installers from the phone book from which \r\n  to request estimates. One of these installers was Sea Island Air, which attracted \r\n  Andrade with its advertisement proclaiming it to be an SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer. \r\n  \r\n\r\nAfter Andrade contacted Sea Island, its president, \r\n  Jimmy Johnson, visited her at home. Johnson emphasized his SCE&amp;G Quality \r\n  Dealer designation and described himself as \"the biggest dealer in the area.\" \r\n  Johnson extolled the virtues of the Quality Dealer program and SCE&amp;G's financing \r\n  program that was only available to purchasers who used a Quality Dealer as their \r\n  installer. \r\n\r\nWhile Johnson was preparing an estimate for the \r\n  proposed work, Andrade went to an SCE&amp;G office and obtained a brochure which \r\n  explained the Great Appliance Trade-Up Program. The brochure explained that \r\n  to qualify for a special rebate or credit toward the monthly bill, a customer \r\n  must:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Be an electric customer of SCE&amp;G on rates 1, \r\n    7, 8 or 9.\r\n\r\n  Purchase one of the high-efficiency units . . . \r\n    and have it installed by an SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer. SCE&amp;G-certified \r\n    Quality Dealers are the only contractors whose installation work qualifies \r\n    for rebates in our Great Appliance Trade-Up Program, as well as for special \r\n    energy rates for the SCE&amp;G Good Cents or Rate 7 homes. Call your local \r\n    heating and air conditioning contractors to find out if they are certified \r\n    Quality Dealers. Or call SCE&amp;G for a list of participating dealers in \r\n    your area. \r\n\r\n\r\nAndrade testified the brochure \"confirmed everything \r\n  that Mr. Johnson had told me, that the only way that I could get into this program \r\n  sponsored by SCE&amp;G was to go through a Quality Dealer and he was a Quality \r\n  Dealer.\" \r\n\r\nAndrade agreed to have two new HVAC systems installed \r\n  in her home and experienced difficulty almost immediately. She was initially \r\n  disappointed when what she described as five or six teenage boys arrived on \r\n  January 17, 1995 to install the new systems because Johnson had assured her \r\n  he had a \"highly professional team\" working for him. These workers used both \r\n  her bathroom and telephone without permission, played radios loudly and, according \r\n  to Andrade, \"it was just like a party atmosphere.\" After Andrade complained, \r\n  an older, more professional crew arrived the following day. \r\n\r\nThe new crew worked for approximately two days, \r\n  did not complete the installation, and disappeared. Andrade continued to complain \r\n  to Johnson and SCE&amp;G, but received little if any satisfaction or response \r\n  to her entreaties from either. \r\n\r\nFinally, a crew returned, worked sporadically for \r\n  a week, and concluded their work on February 28, 1995. Andrade immediately observed \r\n  difficulties with the operation of the system and informed Johnson of the deficiencies. \r\n  However, she did sign the financing forms authorizing SCE&amp;G to pay Sea Island \r\n  for the work. She testified she signed the forms even though the systems were \r\n  not operating properly because Johnson was \"very intimidating.\" \r\n\r\nAndrade was forced to buy electric heaters to warm \r\n  her house for the balance of the winter. At Andrade's request, the Beaufort \r\n  codes department inspected the installation and listed approximately fifteen \r\n  code violations committed by Sea Island. Andrade also arranged to have the head \r\n  of the local SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer program inspect the installation. When \r\n  this proved unproductive, Andrade saw the general manager of SCE&amp;G's Beaufort \r\n  office and asked him to intervene with Johnson and Sea Island to remedy the \r\n  problems. When all else failed, Andrade was forced to hire another contractor \r\n  to remove and replace the systems installed by Sea Island, and to file this \r\n  suit. \r\n\r\nPrior to trial, Andrade settled with Johnson and \r\n  executed a covenant not to sue in his favor. The covenant expressly reserved \r\n  any and all claims Andrade had against SCE&amp;G. The court granted summary \r\n  judgment to SCE&amp;G on Andrade's UTPA claim and on her claims based on SCE&amp;G's \r\n  vicarious or derivative liability. The court directed a verdict in SCE&amp;G's \r\n  favor on Andrade's remaining causes of action alleging independent negligence \r\n  and misrepresentation. \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS  \r\n\r\n\r\nI. Effect of Covenant Not \r\n  to Sue \r\n\r\nAndrade first argues the court erred in finding \r\n  the covenant not to sue released both Jimmy Johnson and SCE&amp;G, therefore \r\n  granting summary judgment to SCE&amp;G. We disagree.\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear \r\n  there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see Vermeer Carolina's, \r\n  Inc. v. Wood/Chuck Chipper Corp., 336 S.C. 53, 59, 518 S.E.2d 301, 304 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999). In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists such as \r\n  to preclude summary judgment, the evidence and all inferences reasonably drawn \r\n  therefrom must be viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. \r\n  Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Comm'n, 332 S.C. 54, 61, 504 \r\n  S.E.2d 117, 121 (1998).\r\n\r\nIn the covenant Andrade agreed to \"never institute \r\n  any action or suit at law or in equity against covenantee, nor . . . in any \r\n  way aid in the institution or prosecution of any claim . . . for damages . . \r\n  . or compensation&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;arising out of the installation \r\n  of two Rheem Air Conditioner systems in [Andrade's] home&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.\" \r\n  \r\n\r\n However, in the same document Andrade also reserved \r\n  \"all rights of action, claims, and demands against any and all persons other \r\n  than [Johnson], including but not limited to South Carolina Electric &amp; Gas \r\n  Co., Inc. and/or SCANA Corp.\" \r\n\r\nA covenant not to sue is an agreement not to sue \r\n  to enforce a right existing at the time of the making of the agreement. See \r\n  Wade v. Berkeley County, 339 S.C. 513, 520, 529 S.E.2d 743, 747 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2000). A covenant not to sue is not a release. Id. The common law \r\n  rule governing releases until relatively recently was that the release of one \r\n  tortfeasor automatically released all joint tortfeasors. The rule, and the reason \r\n  for the advent of a covenant not to sue, has been explained as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n  At the base of this rule was the theory \r\n    that there could be but one compensation for the joint wrong. If the injured \r\n    party was paid by one of the wrongdoers for the injury he had suffered, each \r\n    wrongdoer being responsible for the whole damage, his cause of action was \r\n    satisfied in exchange for a release, and he could not proceed against the \r\n    others. Thus a release of one joint wrongdoer released all. But when the consideration \r\n    received for the release was not full compensation for the injury, the purpose \r\n    for the harsh rule did not exist. To allow for this, the covenant not to sue \r\n    was developed.\r\n\r\n\r\nAckerman v. Travelers Indem. Co., 318 S.C. \r\n  137, 146-47, 456 S.E.2d 408, 413 (Ct. App. 1995) (quoting James W. Logan, Jr., \r\n  Insurance--Covenant Not to Sue, 21 S.C. L. Rev. 282 (1969)).\r\n\r\nOur supreme court in Bartholomew v. McCartha \r\n  changed the common law rule. 255 S.C. 489, 491-92, 179 S.E.2d 912, 913-14 (1971). \r\n  The court held unless it was the intention of the parties, or the plaintiff \r\n  had received full compensation amounting to a satisfaction, the release of one \r\n  tortfeasor did not release others who wrongfully contributed to the plaintiff's \r\n  injuries. Id. at 492, 179 S.E.2d at 914.\r\n\r\nThis principle was codified in the South Carolina \r\n  Contribution Among Tortfeasors Act (UCATA).  \r\n  (1) \r\n\r\nAndrade argues this provision prohibits the release \r\n  of SCE&amp;G and urges this court to expand the definition of tortfeasor under \r\n  the UCATA to include vicariously liable parties. We decline to do so.\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions are divided as to whether a \r\n  covenant not to sue a primarily liable party while reserving rights against \r\n  a secondarily liable party preserves causes of action against the latter. See \r\n  generally Vitauts M. Gulbis, Annotation, Release of, or Covenant Not \r\n  to Sue, One Primarily Liable for Tort, But Expressly Reserving Rights Against \r\n  One Secondarily Liable, as Bar to Recovery Against Latter. 24 ALR 4th 547, \r\n  552 (1983).\r\n\r\nCourts that hold a covenant not to sue a primarily \r\n  liable party discharges the secondarily liable party have generally fallen into \r\n  one of the following categories: (1) courts that find the agreement discharges \r\n  the primary liability and thus extinguishes the secondary liability; \r\n  (2) (2) courts that find the secondarily liable party's right to indemnification \r\n  renders the covenant illusory; (3) and (3) courts \r\n  that hold the secondarily liable party is not a true tortfeasor. \r\n   (4) \r\n\r\nWhile some of the cases on this subject deal with \r\n  covenants not to sue and others with releases, this distinction should not be \r\n  the determining factor in the end result. The most important factor is the type \r\n  of liability and the relationship inter se of the various allegedly \r\n  liable parties rather than the type of document used to discharge liability. \r\n  It must be determined whether the liability arises only vicariously because \r\n  of the negligence of another party or whether the parties are true joint tortfeasors, \r\n  both being independently negligent toward the third party.\r\n\r\nIn Craven v. Lawson, the Tennessee Supreme \r\n  Court concluded that the UCATA is not applicable to cases involving indemnity \r\n  resulting from vicarious liability. 534 S.W.2d 653, 656 (Tenn. 1976). The court \r\n  concluded the UCATA did not apply to situations involving vicarious liability \r\n  such as that between master and servant. The court recognized \"the right of \r\n  the master or principal to obtain indemnity from the servant or agent in a derivative \r\n  liability situation. Where the right of full indemnity exists between persons \r\n  liable in tort, no right of contribution exists.\" Id. at 656 (emphasis \r\n  added) (citation omitted). Both the Tennessee and South Carolina versions of \r\n  the UCATA specifically preserve the common law rule relating to indemnity. \r\n  (5) \r\n\r\nHowever, there is division even among jurisdictions \r\n  that have adopted the UCATA. Some jurisdictions have construed the act's definition \r\n  of \"tortfeasor\" to include parties that are liable vicariously and have then \r\n  applied other provisions of the act to prevent the release of the secondarily \r\n  liable party. See generally Yates v. New South Pizza, Ltd., 412 \r\n  S.E.2d 666 (N.C. 1992) (holding plaintiff could maintain action against employer \r\n  based on respondeat superior after executing covenant not to sue in favor of \r\n  negligent employee pursuant to North Carolina's UCATA statute).\r\n\r\nIndemnity has been defined as \"[a] contractual \r\n  or equitable right under which the entire loss is shifted from a tortfeasor \r\n  who is only technically or passively at fault to another who is primarily or \r\n  actively responsible.\" Black's Law Dictionary 769 (6th ed. 1990) (emphasis \r\n  added). In contrast, \"contribution\" is defined as the:\r\n\r\n\r\n  [r]ight of one who has discharged a common liability \r\n    to recover of another also liable, the aliquot portion which he ought to pay \r\n    or bear. Under principle of 'contribution,' a tort-feasor against whom a judgment \r\n    is rendered is entitled to recover proportional shares of judgment from other \r\n    joint tort-feasors whose negligence contributed to the injury and who were \r\n    also liable to the plaintiff.\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 328.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, a master or principal only vicariously \r\n  liable does not have an aliquot or proportional portion he or she ought to pay, \r\n  but rather may shift the entire loss to the servant or agent actively \r\n  responsible, and may recover in full from the servant. See Sky City \r\n  Stores v. Gregg Sec. Servs., 276 S.C. 556, 558, 280 S.E.2d 807, 808 (1981); \r\n  Addy v. Bolton, 257 S.C. 28, 34, 183 S.E.2d 708, 710 (1971); Johnson \r\n  v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 142 S.C. 125, 141, 140 S.E. 443, 448 (1927); \r\n  Bell v. Clinton Oil Mill, 129 S.C. 242, 256-57, 124 S.E. 7, 12 (1924); \r\n  Humphries v. Whitlock Combing Co., 309 S.C. 356, 359-60, 422 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  156-57 (Ct. App. 1992); South Carolina Ins. Co. v. James C. Greene&nbsp;&amp; \r\n  Co., 290 S.C. 171, 186, 348 S.E.2d 617, 625-26 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n When Andrade issued a covenant not to sue in Johnson's \r\n  favor, any claims she had against him were terminated. Thus, SCE&amp;G's derivative \r\n  liability based upon Johnson's conduct was extinguished. Were we to find the \r\n  covenant released Johnson but not SCE&amp;G, it would necessarily follow that \r\n  SCE&amp;G could seek indemnification from Johnson and recover the entire amount \r\n  of any verdict against it from him. This would effectively strip the covenant \r\n  not to sue of any real meaning and result in what the court in Nelson v. \r\n  Gillette described as a \"corrosive circle of indemnity.\" 571 N.W.2d 332, \r\n  339 (N.D. 1997).\r\n\r\nThe right of contribution exists only in \r\n  situations involving joint tortfeasors. See Vermeer, 336 S.C at \r\n  64, 518 S.E.2d at 307 (\"Under South Carolina law, there can be no indemnity \r\n  among mere joint tortfeasors.&quot;) (emphasis added). The corollary of this \r\n  proposition is that the right of indemnity exists only in vicarious liability \r\n  situations, and there is no right to contribution between such parties. See \r\n  Craven, 534 S.W.2d at 656 (\"Where the right of full indemnity exists \r\n  between persons liable in tort, no right of contribution exists.\"); see also \r\n  Â§ 15-38-20(F). Thus, the UCATA controls only in situations involving joint tortfeasors.\r\n\r\nJust as the Tennessee version of the UCATA statute \r\n  discussed in Craven, South Carolina law does not change the common law \r\n  of indemnity. See Â§15-38-20(F). The common law of this state provides \r\n  that a covenant not to sue an employee operates as an acquittal of the employer \r\n  who is only derivatively liable. \"[A] covenant not to sue, which ordinarily \r\n  does not release another joint-tortfeasor from liability, does operate as a \r\n  release of the master, liable only under respondeat superior, if given \r\n  to the servant responsible.\" Seaboard Air Line R.R. v. Coastal Distrib., \r\n  273 F. Supp. 340, 343 (D.S.C. 1967); see Wade, 339 S.C. at 520, \r\n  528 S.E.2d at 747 (stating \"'a covenant not to sue is . . . merely an agreement \r\n  not to enforce an existing cause of action, and, although it may operate as \r\n  a release between the parties to the agreement, it will not release a claim \r\n  against joint obligors or joint tort-feasors'&quot;) (quoting 76 C.J.S. Release \r\n  Â§&nbsp;4 (1994)).\r\n\r\nWe hold the covenant not to sue issued in favor \r\n  of Johnson, the agent, released SCE&amp;G, the vicariously liable principal. \r\n  In conclusion, we note even were we to expand the definition of tortfeasor as \r\n  North Carolina has done, we find the UCATA simply is not applicable to cases \r\n  involving indemnity. Consequently, contribution cases cited by Andrade in support \r\n  of her argument are inapposite to the facts of this case. Thus, we affirm the \r\n  grant of summary judgment to SCE&amp;G on this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices \r\n    Act \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAndrade next argues the trial court erred in finding \r\n  SCE&amp;G was exempt from the UTPA, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 39-5-10 to -160 (1985 \r\n  &amp; Supp. 2000), and in subsequently granting SCE&amp;G's motion for summary \r\n  judgment on this cause of action. We agree. \r\n\r\nThe UTPA declares unlawful \"[u]nfair methods of \r\n  competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in the conduct of any \r\n  trade or commerce . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-20(a) (1985). Trade and commerce \r\n  includes \"the advertising, offering for sale, sale or distribution of any services \r\n  . . . .\" S.C.&nbsp;Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-10(b) (1985). \r\n\r\nSection 39-5-40 governs exemptions from the act \r\n  and states in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Nothing in this article shall apply to: \r\n\r\n  (a) Actions or transactions permitted under laws \r\n    administered by any regulatory body or officer acting under statutory authority \r\n    of this State or the United States or actions or transactions permitted by \r\n    any other South Carolina State law.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 39-5-40 (1985). This section has \r\n  been interpreted to exempt actions or transactions allowed or authorized by \r\n  regulatory agencies or by other statutes. Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. \r\n  200, 218, 479 S.E.2d 35, 44 (1996); see Ward v. Dick Dyer &amp; Assocs., \r\n  304 S.C. 152, 156, 403 S.E.2d 310, 312 (1991) (stating only those activities \r\n  that are specifically authorized by a regulation or another statute are \r\n  exempt from the UTPA); Carr v. United Van Lines, Inc., 289 S.C. 194, \r\n  199, 345 S.E.2d 734, 737 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding transaction involved was exempt \r\n  under the UTPA because the action was authorized under regulations and tariffs \r\n  administered by the Interstate Commerce Commission); Trident Neuro-Imaging \r\n  Lab. v. Blue Cross &amp; Blue Shield of South Carolina, Inc., 568 F. Supp. \r\n  1474, 1483 (D.S.C. 1983) (concluding Blue Cross was exempt under the UTPA because \r\n  the South Carolina Commission on Insurance specifically approved Blue Cross' \r\n  exclusion of coverage on physician-owned CAT scans).\r\n\r\nIn support of its summary judgment motion based \r\n  on its alleged exemption under the UTPA, SCE&amp;G presented a copy of the June \r\n  7, 1993 order from the South Carolina Public Service Commission approving SCE&amp;G's \r\n  application for a rate increase. The order indicates the PSC is required by \r\n  section 58-37-20 of the South Carolina Energy Conservation and Efficiency Act \r\n  of 1992 to encourage utilities to invest in cost-effective energy-efficient \r\n  technologies and energy conservation programs. \r\n\r\nAndrade argues that in regard to the Quality Dealer \r\n  Program, \"[t]he PSC Order did not specifically authorize the program . . .\" \r\n  We agree. We find the thrust of the PSC's order deals primarily with SCE&amp;G's \r\n  rate structure. The order does not specifically authorize, regulate, or describe \r\n  how the Quality Dealer Program should be designed or implemented. In fact, the \r\n  words \"Quality Dealer Program\" are not specifically mentioned anywhere in the \r\n  PSC's lengthy order. \r\n\r\nThe order does discuss expenses allocated to SCE&amp;G's \r\n  demand-side management programs which are \"designed to either reduce \r\n  energy demand (kw), reduce energy usage (kwh) or to shift usage to non-peak \r\n  periods, increasing efficiency, thereby reducing SCE&amp;G's requirements to \r\n  build new capacity.\" SCE&amp;G's Great Appliance Trade-Up program is one such \r\n  demand-side management program. (6) However, \r\n  in the supplemental stipulation of the PSC staff and SCE&amp;G, the Quality \r\n  Dealer Program is not listed as one of SCE&amp;G's demand-side management \r\n  programs. \r\n  \r\n  Even if the PSC's order can be construed as authorizing the program, it falls \r\n  far short of providing any regulatory control over its creation or implementation. \r\n  Thus, while the PSC noted Quality Dealers would install the air conditioners, \r\n  it neither defined what a Quality Dealer was nor placed criteria upon the selection \r\n  of Quality Dealers.  \r\nSCE&amp;G submitted an affidavit from David Butler, \r\n  General Counsel for the PSC, in support of its motion for summary judgment. \r\n  Butler stated the PSC would investigate any complaint filed regarding the Quality \r\n  Dealer Program and take the appropriate action. However, this investigation \r\n  would be based on: (1) the PSC's general power to supervise and regulate the \r\n  rates of public utilities under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-3-140 (Supp. 2000), and \r\n  (2) the required compliance of electric utilities with the PSC's orders pursuant \r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-27-40 (1977). It apparently would not take place pursuant \r\n  to any preauthorized plan of regulating or controlling the Quality Dealer Program. \r\n  These sections cited by SCE&amp;G and the PSC's order are broad grants of authority \r\n  and too general for us to conclude as a matter of law that the Quality Dealer \r\n  Program was specifically authorized by an agency or by a statute to such an \r\n  extent that it should be exempt from the provisions of the UTPA. \r\n\r\nIn Taylor, the court found that a medical \r\n  laboratory's conduct in billing for numerous medically unwarranted tests was \r\n  not exempt under the UTPA. 324&nbsp;S.C. at 218, 479 S.E.2d. at 44. Similarly, \r\n  we find the PSC's order indicating that SCE&amp;G was directed to create a program \r\n  encouraging energy conservation and efficiency does not exempt SCE&amp;G's conduct \r\n  in allegedly failing to oversee its Quality Dealer Program, a program it created \r\n  pursuant to general statutory and regulatory directions. In the final analysis, \r\n  SCE&amp;G had discretion in creating the Quality Dealer Program and in determining \r\n  the qualifications for and criteria of those selected as Quality Dealers thereunder. \r\n  We therefore reverse the grant of summary judgment in favor of SCE&amp;G on \r\n  this issue.\r\n\r\nIII. Directed Verdict on \r\n  Negligence\r\n\r\nAndrade contends the trial court erred in granting \r\n  SCE&amp;G a directed verdict on her negligence cause of action. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"When this court reviews a grant of directed verdict, \r\n  the evidence and all reasonable inferences therefrom must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the non-prevailing party.\" Davis v. Tripp, 338 S.C. \r\n  226, 238, 525 S.E.2d 528, 534 (Ct. App. 1999). \"If the evidence is susceptible \r\n  to more than one reasonable inference, the case should be submitted to the jury.\" \r\n  Id. (quoting Quesinberry&nbsp;v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 594, \r\n  503 S.E.2d 717, 720 (1998)).\r\n\r\n\"The elements for a cause of action for the tort \r\n  of negligence are: (1) a duty owed to the plaintiff by the defendant, (2) a \r\n  breach of that duty by the defendant, and (3) damages proximately resulting \r\n  from the breach of duty.\" Hubbard v. Taylor, 339 S.C. 582, 588, 529 S.E.2d \r\n  549, 552 (2000). To maintain a negligence action, the defendant must owe a legal \r\n  duty of care to the plaintiff. Id. Duty is generally defined as \"the \r\n  obligation to conform to a particular standard of conduct toward another.\" Id. \r\n  (quoting Shipes v. Piggly Wiggly St. Andrews, Inc., 269 S.C. 479, 483, \r\n  238 S.E.2d 167, 168 (1977)). \"The existence of a duty owed is a question of \r\n  law for the courts.\" Washington v. Lexington County Jail, 337 S.C. 400, \r\n  405, 523 S.E.2d 204, 206 (Ct. App. 1999).\r\n\r\nAs the court in Hubbard stated, \"an affirmative \r\n  legal duty to act may be created by statute, contract, relationship, status, \r\n  property interest, or some other special circumstance.&quot; 339 S.C. at \r\n  589, 529 S.E.2d at 552 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAndrade argues the court erred in holding SCE&amp;G \r\n  did not owe her a duty under the Quality Dealer Program. Viewing the record \r\n  in the light most favorable to Andrade, we agree. The evidence \r\n  (7) raises the inference SCE&amp;G owed a duty of care to Andrade \r\n  to ensure the proper installation of her HVAC systems.\r\n\r\nSCE&amp;G's Quality Dealer Program Guidelines stated \r\n  \"SCE&amp;G's HVAC Quality Dealer Program is designed to encourage proper \r\n  installation of high efficiency heating and cooling systems. The program \r\n  incorporates high standards of system design, installation, and maintenance.&quot; \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\n\r\nUnder the agreement between SCE&amp;G and its Quality \r\n  Dealers, the Quality Dealers agreed to meet and adhere to all installation requirements, \r\n  mediation procedures, and to abide by the inspection policy. In turn, SCE&amp;G \r\n  agreed to promote high efficiency HVAC equipment and quality HVAC installations \r\n  to its customers. \r\n\r\nThe program agreement further contained a long \r\n  list of installation requirements that must be met by each Quality Dealer. \r\n  (8) The agreement also required Quality Dealers to have certain credentials, \r\n  provide prompt service to all customers, and to participate in yearly training \r\n  provided by SCE&amp;G. The agreement further committed SCE&amp;G to a specific \r\n  procedure involving mediation toward the handling of customer complaints which \r\n  set forth specific requirements for certain action to be taken and concluded \r\n  that discrepancies were expected to be corrected within thirty days after their \r\n  report. \r\n\r\nWe conclude the Quality Dealer Agreement provides \r\n  evidence of a contractual duty undertaken by SCE&amp;G to oversee the proper \r\n  installation of HVAC systems and to address customer complaints regarding improper \r\n  installation. Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Andrade, we \r\n  find the trial court committed reversible error in granting SCE&amp;G a directed \r\n  verdict on Andrade's negligence claim.\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the judgment of the \r\n  trial court is hereby\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-38-10 to -70 (Supp. 2000).  Section 15-38-50  provides:\r\n\r\nWhen a release or a covenant not to sue or not \r\n  to enforce judgment is given in good faith to one of two or more persons liable \r\n  in tort for the same injury or the same wrongful death:\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) it does not discharge any of the other tortfeasors \r\n    from liability for the injury or wrongful death unless its terms so provide, \r\n    but it reduces the claim against the others to the extent of any amount stipulated \r\n    by the release or the covenant, or in the amount of the consideration paid \r\n    for it, whichever is the greater; and \r\n\r\n  (2) it discharges the tortfeasor to whom it is \r\n    given from all liability for contribution to any other tortfeasor.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-50 (emphasis added). \r\n2. See, e.g., Simpson \r\n  v. Townsley, 283 F.2d 743 (10th Cir. 1960) (holding exoneration of primary \r\n  liability removed basis for imputation of negligence). \r\n3.   See, e.g., Holmstead \r\n  v. Abbott G.M. Diesel, Inc., 493 P.2d 625 (Utah 1972) (finding covenant \r\n  would not serve its purpose because of master's right to indemnity). \r\n4. See, e.g., Bacon \r\n  v. United States, 321 F.2d 880 (8th Cir. 1963) (stating secondarily liable \r\n  employer was not a true joint tortfeasor and thus, covenant not to sue employee \r\n  released employer). \r\n5.  South Carolina law provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n  This chapter does not impair any right of indemnity \r\n    under existing law. Where one tortfeasor is entitled to indemnity from another, \r\n    the right of the indemnity obligee is for indemnity and not contribution, \r\n    and the indemnity obligor is not entitled to contribution from the obligee \r\n    for any portion of his indemnity obligation.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-38-20(F) (Supp. 2000).  \r\n6.  The evidence shows SCE&amp;G \r\n  considered the Quality Dealer Program a separate program from the Great Appliance \r\n  Trade-up Program because it had a separate agreement with its Quality Dealers, \r\n  as well as descriptions of the program. For example, in the Great Appliance \r\n  Trade-Up Program Training Guidelines for Quality Dealers, SCE&amp;G provided \r\n  the following guidelines for its Quality Dealers:\r\n\r\nReceiving Training Credit\r\n\r\n1. Quality Dealers must install Heat Pumps which meet \r\nthe 1993 GATU Program guidelines. \r\n\r\n2. Installations must meet the Quality Dealer Program guidelines (emphasis \r\nadded). \r\n7.  Andrade's brief discusses \r\n  evidence proffered but not admitted at trial. The depositions discussed during \r\n  argument to the trial court are not included in the record. Consequently, we \r\n  have not considered such evidence in our deliberations.  \r\n 8.  Andrade testified fifteen \r\n  code violations occurred as a result of Sea Island's faulty installation of \r\n  her HVAC systems. In the SCE&amp;G-Quality Dealer agreement, SCE&amp;G instructed \r\n  the Quality Dealers to \"[s]elect and install systems and accessory equipment \r\n  in accordance with all local, state and national codes.\" (emphasis added). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3322","title":"General Equipment & Supply Company, Inc. v.

(\"General Equipment\") brought this mechanic's lien foreclosure \r\n  action against Keller and Bridgestone Firestone, Inc. (\"Bridgestone\"). General \r\n  Equipment alleged Keller failed to pay for the lease of certain rental equipment \r\n  and supplies and sought judgment in the amount of the unpaid lease.\r\n\r\nOn September 30, 1999, Keller and Bridgestone filed \r\n  an answer denying General Equipment's allegations. Keller also filed a Bond \r\n  and Release of Mechanic's lien at the Aiken County RMC. On November 12, 1999, \r\n  the parties entered into a Consent Order substituting a bonding company, Fidelity, \r\n  for defendant Bridgestone. \r\n\r\nOn January 11, 2000, the parties entered into a \r\n  Consent Order of Reference referring this case to a Master-in-Equity. Following \r\n  this Order of Reference, both sides produced and answered standard interrogatories \r\n  and requests for production. \r\n\r\nOn March 31, 2000, two weeks prior to the scheduled \r\n  trial, Keller and Fidelity filed a notice of motion and motion to compel arbitration. \r\n   (1)&nbsp; \r\n  On April 12, 2000, the Master-in-Equity heard Keller and Fidelity's motion \r\n  and issued an order denying the motion. This appeal follows. \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nKeller and Fidelity argue the Master erred in denying \r\n  their motion to compel arbitration. Keller and Fidelity assert that they did \r\n  not waive their right to arbitration and that General Equipment would not have \r\n  been prejudiced by an enforcement of the Arbitration Clause. We agree.\r\n\r\nIt is generally held that the right to enforce \r\n  an arbitration clause may be waived. Hyload, Inc. v. Pre-Engineered Prods., \r\n  Inc., 308 S.C. 277, 280, 417 S.E.2d 622,624 (Ct. App. 1992). In order to \r\n  establish waiver, a party must show prejudice through an undue burden caused \r\n  by delay in demanding arbitration. Sentry Eng'g &amp; Constr., Inc. v. Mariner's \r\n  Cay Dev. Corp., 287 S.C. 346, 351, 338 S.E.2d 631, 634 (1985). \"There is \r\n  no set rule as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question \r\n  depends on the facts of each case.\" Hyload, Inc., 308 S.C. at 280, 417 \r\n  S.E.2d at 624. Furthermore, it is the policy of this state to favor arbitration \r\n  of disputes. Heffner v. Destiny, Inc., 321 S.C. 536, 537, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  135, 136 (1995).\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a circuit court's decision regarding \r\n  a motion to stay an action pending arbitration, the determination of whether \r\n  a party \"waived its right to arbitrate is a legal conclusion subject to de novo \r\n  review.\" Liberty Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 664, 521 S.E.2d \r\n  749,753 (Ct. App. 1999). However, the circuit court's \"factual findings underlying \r\n  that conclusion will not be overruled if there is any evidence reasonably supporting \r\n  them.\" Id. at 665, 512 S.E.2d at 753.\r\n\r\nThe party seeking to establish waiver has the burden \r\n  of showing prejudice through an undue burden caused by a delay in the demand \r\n  for arbitration. Sentry Eng'g &amp; Constr., 287 S.C. at 351, 338 S.E.2d \r\n  at 634. General Equipment argues there was sufficient evidence which reasonably \r\n  supported the Master's finding that General Equipment would be unduly burdened \r\n  if the Arbitration Clause was enforced. The record, however, contains no evidence \r\n  which demonstrates prejudice to General Equipment. \r\n\r\nIn denying Keller's motion, the Master relied on \r\n  Liberty Builders, and the fact that Keller consented to the referral \r\n  of the case to the Master-in-Equity eighty days prior to filing its motion to \r\n  compel arbitration. Despite Keller's consent to the referral, the burden of \r\n  showing prejudice from Keller's delay in demanding arbitration remains with \r\n  General Equipment. Id. Mere inconvenience is not sufficient to establish \r\n  prejudice. See id.\r\n\r\nThe present case is distinguishable from the case \r\n  relied on by the Master. In Liberty Builders v. Horton, Liberty, the \r\n  party seeking arbitration pursued active litigation against the Hortons for \r\n  two and one-half years and availed itself of the circuit court's assistance \r\n  on forty separate occasions. The court held that \"Liberty waived its right to \r\n  enforce the arbitration clause by submitting the dispute to the court and availing \r\n  itself of that system for two and one-half years.\" Liberty Builders, \r\n  336 S.C. at 668, 521 S.E.2d at 754. The court further found that Liberty's delay \r\n  in requesting arbitration prejudiced the Hortons by subjecting them to lengthy \r\n  litigation and extensive attorney fees. Id. at 666, 521 S.E.2d 753.\r\n\r\nIn the present case, the parties were involved \r\n  in litigation for less than eight months. The litigation consisted of routine \r\n  administrative matters and limited discovery which did not involve the taking \r\n  of depositions or extensive interrogatories. Prior to the filing of the motion \r\n  to compel arbitration, the parties availed themselves of the circuit court's \r\n  assistance twice. The parties consented to an order substituting the defendant \r\n  and an order referring the action to the Master-in-Equity, both of which are \r\n  standard procedures in cases of this type. In essence, neither party availed \r\n  itself of the circuit court's assistance in such a manner as to cause a lengthy \r\n  delay or cause either party to incur significant attorney's fees. Furthermore, \r\n  Keller's motion to compel arbitration was filed within a reasonable time after \r\n  the commencement of the action.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe record does not support the factual findings \r\n  of the Master that General Equipment was prejudiced by the delay in arbitration. \r\n  Keller and Fidelity did not waive their right to arbitration, and were entitled \r\n  to have the Arbitration Clause enforced. Therefore, we hold the Master erred \r\n  in denying Keller and Fidelity's motion to compel arbitration. \r\n\r\nThe order of the trial court is\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nCONNOR and HUFF JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. General Equipment does not \r\n  dispute that its agreement with Keller contains a valid arbitration clause that \r\n  comports with the requirements of S.C. Code section 15-49-10(a).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3323","title":"State v.

Firetag, of Charleston, pro se.\r\n\r\nDeputy County Attorney Thomas E. Lynn, of Charleston Heights, for respondent.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  Firetag Bonding Service appeals the forfeiture of $525 secured by an appearance recognizance given by Firetag to guarantee the appearance\r\nof Alvin L. Gardner to answer charges in magistrate's court for driving under suspension and for transporting in a motor vehicle alcoholic liquors in an open\r\ncontainer.  The terms of the appearance recognizance, among other things, required Gardner to appear before the magistrate on August 16, 1999 \"AND/OR\r\nNEXT ENSUING TERM.\"  Gardner did not appear--neither on August 16, 1999, nor on October 18, 1999, the date for which the magistrate rescheduled the\r\ncase after Gardner initially failed to appear.  After Gardner also failed to appear on October 18, 1999, the magistrate tried him in his absence, found him guilty\r\nof both offenses, and issued a bench warrant for his arrest.  On December 22, 1999, the magistrate ordered the amount of the appearance recognizance forfeited. \r\nFiretag appealed the forfeiture to the circuit court.  The latter affirmed the magistrate.  \r\n\r\nThe dispositive issue concerns a stamped notation inserted by Firetag on the back of the appearance recognizance.  The notation reads: \"NOTICE: NO\r\nCONTINUANCE WITHOUT PRIOR CONSENT FROM BONDING COMPANY.\"  Firetag argues the notation constituted a binding term within the\r\nappearance recognizance and therefore it could not be held to guarantee Gardner's appearance before the magistrate beyond August 16, 1999, unless the\r\nmagistrate notified Firetag of the continuance of Gardner's case and Firetag approved of the continuance.  Here, Firetag claims: (1) the magistrate failed to\r\nnotify it that Gardner's case had been continued, and (2) it never approved the continuance of Gardner's case to the October date. \r\n\r\n    We affirm the judgment below. (1)\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the conditions of an appearance recognizance, including when a defendant must appear in court to answer the charge or charges, are fixed by\r\nlaw. (2)  The applicable statute provides in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\r\nEvery appearance recognizance or appearance bond will be conditioned on the person charged personally appearing before the court specified to answer the\r\ncharge or indictment and to do and receive what shall be enjoined by the court, and not to depart the State, and be of good behavior toward all the citizens\r\nthereof . . . . (3)  \r\n\r\n\r\nAs is readily apparent, nothing in this section authorizes a surety, such as Firetag, to set the conditions of an appearance recognizance regarding when and\r\nwhere the defendant must appear.  \"What\" a defendant must \"do and receive,\" i.e., the conditions of the appearance recognizance, are those things \"enjoined by\r\nthe court,\" not the surety.  The stamped notation on the back of the appearance recognizance at issue that seeks to limit the magistrate's authority to continue\r\nthe defendant's case constitutes, therefore, an unauthorized condition.  As such, the notation is nothing more than mere surplusage and in no way affects the\r\nvalidity of the appearance recognizance itself. (4)\r\n\r\nIndeed, Gardner's failure to appear on August 16, 1999, was alone a sufficient basis for the magistrate to forfeit the amount of the appearance recognizance, (5)\r\nnotwithstanding the stamped notation.  Gardner's failure to appear did not require the magistrate to continue the case and thus afford both Gardner and Firetag a\r\nsecond chance to avoid forfeiture.\r\n\r\nFiretag raises several other issues not otherwise embraced within the question discussed; however, we do not address them and affirm pursuant to Rule\r\n220(b)(2), SCACR. (6)\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, ANDERSON, and STILWELL, JJ., concur.\r\n1.   Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal and because the amount involved in this case does not exceed $1,000, we\r\ndecide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n2.

Haselden, of Howser, Newman &amp; Besley; and General Counsel Rose Mary McGregor, of State Accident Fund, both\r\nof Columbia, for respondents.\r\n\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nSHULER, J.:  In a decision affirmed by the workers' compensation commission and the circuit court, the single commissioner\r\nfound Ralph Schurlknight's claim for benefits barred by the statute of limitations.  Schurlknight appeals.  We affirm.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSchurlknight worked as a fireman for the City of North Charleston from 1973 until August of 1997. (1)  Between 1976 and 1997,\r\nSchurlknight served as a captain and rode in the passenger seat of the fire truck between five and fifteen times per week.  On\r\neach call, Schurlknight was exposed to the sirens and air horns which were several feet from his seat.  Schurlknight would\r\nleave his window down to listen for traffic and other emergency vehicles, and turned the radio up to a volume that could be\r\nheard over the sirens and horns.\r\n\r\nSchurlknight had a hearing test performed on April 14, 1995 as part of a routine physical.  Dr.\r\nWeissglass, Schurlknight's\r\nphysician, reported Schurlknight had \"some hearing loss that fits the pattern of noise induced.\" Schurlknight testified he was\r\ntold he had a \"slight, slight hearing impairment\" which the physician would monitor each year.  Prior to the physical,\r\nSchurlknight had not noticed any hearing loss.  Dr. Weissglass recommended Schurlknight wear hearing protection and\r\nreferred him to the Charleston Speech and Hearing Center (the Center).\r\n\r\nSchurlknight received counseling at the Center regarding the adverse communication effects of his hearing impairment and was\r\nsubsequently referred to vocational rehabilitation services for funding assistance for hearing aids.  The Center's report, which\r\nwas mailed to Schurlknight on May 3, 1995, indicated that Schurlknight's hearing loss was moderate and imposed a\r\ncommunication handicap.  Dr. Fenwick, who reported on Schurlknight's condition, described \"a history of bilateral hearing\r\nloss which has slowly progressed over the last several years.\"  On May 10, 1995, Dr. Fenwick recommended Schurlknight\r\nobtain annual audiograms concluding the \"hearing loss will likely continue to worsen and [Schurlknight] may ultimately need\r\nhearing aids in the future, although I would expect that this would be 10 years away.\"\r\n\r\nSchurlknight continued his work as a fireman and did not file a claim as he was still able to perform his job and he believed Dr.\r\nWeissglass would monitor his hearing at his annual physicals.\r\n\r\nSchurlknight had another physical and hearing test performed in February of  1996, in anticipation of the North Charleston\r\nDistrict's merger with the City of North Charleston.  Dr. Weissglass again performed the physical and the hearing test and,\r\naccording to Schurlknight, described his hearing loss as \"minor, go back to work.\"\r\nDr. Weissglass reported \"[Schurlknight]\r\nneeds protective gear for hearing and annual audiograms.\"  Schurlknight testified that he did not wear his hearing protection\r\nbecause he could not hear the radio transmission while in the fire truck if he wore ear plugs.  Schurlknight continued to work\r\nuntil August of 1997, when he left the fire department due to unrelated medical problems. (2)  Schurlknight has not worked since\r\n1997.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the fire department, Schurlknight noticed more severe hearing loss.  In December of 1997, Dr. Fenwick\r\nperformed another audiogram.  Schurlknight's understanding of the results is that his hearing loss is severe.  Dr. Fenwick\r\nreported Schurlknight's loss as 22.5% to the right ear and 37.5% to the left ear resulting in a binaural hearing impairment of\r\n12.5%, describing the loss as \"mild to moderately - severe.\"\r\n\r\nSchurlknight filed his Form 50 claim for benefits on March 6, 1998.  The City of North Charleston and the State Accident Fund\r\nfiled a Form 51 denying the claim based, inter alia, on the statute of limitations.  The single commissioner denied the claim,\r\nfinding it barred by the two year statute of limitations. The single commissioner concluded Schurlknight \"knew that he had a\r\nworkers' compensation claim for a hearing loss at least by May 1995.\"\r\n\r\nSchurlknight appealed to the full commission arguing essentially four issues: 1) Schurlknight was not aware he had a\r\ncompensable claim until much later than May of 1995; (2) Schurlknight timely filed his claim as he continued to incur damage\r\nuntil his last exposure in August of 1997 and it was thus not barred by the statute of limitations; 3) Schurlknight suffered from\r\npermanent partial disability; and 4) Schurlknight's hearing loss is causally related to his employment.\r\n\r\nIn a two-to-one decision, the full commission affirmed the single commissioner.  The dissenting commissioner concluded,\r\ninter\r\nalia, the City of North Charleston and the State Accident Fund were estopped from denying the claim as they gave\r\nSchurlknight sufficient reason to believe they would provide yearly testing and take care of his hearing problems.\r\n\r\n Schurlknight appealed to the circuit court raising the same issues raised to the full commission. The circuit court concluded the\r\nissues were: 1) the statute of limitations; and 2) estoppel.  Concluding the discovery rule applied, the circuit court affirmed the\r\ncommission's ruling that the statute of limitations barred the claim.  The circuit court did not rule on the estoppel issue.  This\r\nappeal follows.\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workers'\r\nCompensation Commission.  Lark v. Bi-Lo, 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).  In an appeal from the commission, this\r\nCourt may not substitute its judgment for that of the commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, but may\r\nreverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6) (Supp. 2000);\r\nStephen v. Avins\r\nConstr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996); see also \r\nSmith v. Union Bleachery/Cone Mills, 276 S.C. 454, 456,\r\n280 S.E.2d 52, 53 (1981) (court may reverse or modify agency's decision \"if substantial rights of the appellant have been\r\nprejudiced because the administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are .  .  . affected by other error of law.\");\r\nLyles v. Quantum Chem. Co., 315 S.C. 440, 434 S.E.2d 292 (Ct. App. 1993) (in reviewing decision of workers' compensation\r\ncommission, [the] court of appeals will not set aside its findings unless they are not supported by substantial evidence or they\r\nare controlled by error of law).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nSchurlknight argues the commission erred in barring his claim based upon the statute of limitations.  We disagree.  South\r\nCarolina Code Annotated Section 42-15-40 provides in part:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe right to compensation under this title is barred unless a claim is filed  with the commission within two years after an\r\naccident, or if death  resulted from accident, within two years of the date of death.\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-15-40 (Supp. 2000).  In Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992), the\r\nsupreme court held the discovery rule applied in workers' compensation actions.  Under the discovery rule, the statute would\r\nbegin to run from the date Schurlknight either knew or should have known of his compensable injury. (3)  \r\nId.  The commission,\r\nadopting the single commissioner's findings, concluded Schurlknight knew he had a claim for a hearing loss by May of 1995.\r\n\r\nSchurlknight's medical records indicate that in May of 1995, he was counseled at the Center in regard to the \"adverse\r\ncommunication effects of his hearing impairment\" and was \"referred to vocational rehabilitation for funding assistance for\r\nhearing aids.\"  Schurlknight's medical records also indicate that his hearing loss was moderate and imposed a communications\r\nhandicap.\" We agree with the commission that Schurlknight knew or should have known of his compensable injury by May of\r\n1995.  Even assuming that Schurlknight was unaware of his compensable injury by May of 1995, Schurlknight certainly knew\r\nor should have known of his compensable injury after his audiogram in February of 1996. (4)  Accordingly, Schurlknight's Form\r\n50, filed on March 6, 1998, is barred by the two-year statute of limitations.    \r\n\r\nSchurlknight also argues that in repetitive trauma claims to which the limitation period for accidents applies, the date on which\r\nthe claim occurs is the last date of exposure to the repetitive trauma.  That is, Schurlknight proposes that the statute of\r\nlimitations should begin to run only after the date of Schurlknight's last exposure to his noisy environment.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nThis Court is bound by the holding in Mauldin and must apply the discovery rule.  We are unaware of any case overruling the\r\nsupreme court's ruling in Mauldin.  Additionally, in\r\nPee v. AVM Inc., Op. No. 3280 (S.C. Ct. App. 2001, filed January 8,\r\n2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 40), this Court stated in dicta that Mauldin is applicable to repetitive trauma injuries:\r\n\r\n\r\n[O]ur supreme court ruled that the two-year limitation provided in section  42-15-40 begins to run from the date the claimant\r\nfirst discovers the  compensable injury.  It is this discrete event which provides the necessary  certainty as to time.\r\n\r\n\r\nPee, Shearouse Adv.\r\nSh. No. 2 at 48.\r\n\r\nSchurlknight also argues because he was led to believe he need not take action to pursue his claim, the City of North\r\nCharleston should be estopped from asserting the statute of limitations.  The issue of estoppel was not ruled upon by the circuit\r\ncourt.  In addition, Schurlknight did not move to alter or amend the order of the circuit court for failure to consider the issue\r\nunder Rule 59(e), SCRCP.  Therefore, this issue is not preserved for appeal.  See \r\nTalley v. S.C. Higher Educ. Tuition Grants\r\nComm'n, 289 S.C. 483, 347 S.E.2d 99 (1986) (an issue raised to but not ruled on by the trial court is not preserved unless the\r\ncomplaining party moves to amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order on appeal is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nSTILWELL, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurs in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nHOWARD, J., concurring:   I concur in the reasoning and decision of the majority opinion.  I write separately to clarify what I\r\nbelieve to be the distinction between the date of discovery of a compensable injury in Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308\r\nS.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992), and the date of discovery of a compensable injury in this case.\r\n\r\nIn Mauldin, the claimant first injured her knee on January 2, 1985.  She reported it and received emergency room treatment\r\npaid for by her employer/worker's compensation carrier.  She was diagnosed with a knee sprain, and the injury was handled as\r\na \"medical only\" claim, minor injury, and was then closed. Id. at 20, 416 S.E.2d 640.  During the next two years, she\r\nexperienced intermittent swelling, which was diagnosed by her family physician as arthritis.\r\nId.  It was not until October 1987\r\nthat she experienced swelling which did not subside, at which time she was first diagnosed with a torn medial meniscus in the\r\nknee.  Our supreme court ruled that under those circumstances, the claimant first discovered a compensable injury in October\r\n1987 with the diagnosis of torn medial meniscus.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Schurlknight was first told he had a permanent hearing loss significant enough to require a hearing aid in May\r\n1995.  By its very nature, this condition was not transient or minor.  Furthermore, he was advised to protect his ears when the\r\nsiren was blaring, which he felt he could not do without missing radio transmissions or traffic indicators.  Therefore, under his\r\nown version of his job duties, this injury adversely impacted Schurlknight's ability to perform as a fireman.  Consequently,\r\nfacts putting a reasonable claimant on notice of a compensable injury were available to Schurlknight in May 1995.\r\n\r\nAlthough I agree that the above resolution is mandated by our Workers' Compensation Act and caselaw, it is a harsh rule to\r\napply in a repetitive trauma case.  See \r\nPee v. AVM, Inc., Op. No. 3280 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 8, 2001) (Shearouse Adv.\r\nSh. No. 2 at 40).  The employee is punished for continuing to perform the job during the early stages of the injury by denial of\r\nthe right to make a legitimate claim for benefits when the injury finally renders the claimant unable to perform the job. \r\nFurthermore, it is likely to undermine the employee/employer relationship by requiring the employee to file an early claim even\r\nthough he or she is still able and ready to work.\r\n\r\nRepetitive trauma cases fall in between the traditional concept of \"injury by accident\" and \"occupational disease.\"  They have\r\nsome characteristics of each.  See \r\nPee, Op. No. 3280 (S.C. Ct. App. filed January 8, 2001) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 40). \r\nOther states have addressed this problem by ruling in repetitive trauma cases that the statutory period for filing a claim begins\r\nto run at such time as the employee is no longer able to work at his job. See, e.g.,\r\nRoss v. Oxford Paper Co., 363 A.2d 712, 714\r\n(Me. 1976); Barker v. Home-Crest Corp., 805 S.W.2d 373, 373-74 (Tenn. 1991); 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson\r\nLarson's\r\nWorkers' Compensation Law Â§ 50.05 (2000).  However, without further guidance from our supreme court,\r\nMauldin cannot be\r\nextended to reach this result.  Of course, the clearest resolution would be through legislative action that comprehensively\r\naddresses repetitive trauma injuries such as that involved here and carpal tunnel syndrome as found in\r\nPee. \r\n \r\n1.    Schurlknight worked for the North Charleston District until their merger with the City of North Charleston in approximately\r\n1996.             \r\n              \r\n2.   Schurlknight suffered from cluster migraine headaches.  \r\n3.     Our supreme court further explained the discovery rule in\r\nDean v. Ruscon Corp., :\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to the discovery rule, the statute of limitations begins to run  when a cause of action reasonably ought to have been\r\ndiscovered.  The  statute runs from the date the injured party either knows or should have  known by the exercise of reasonable\r\ndiligence that a cause of action  arises from the wrongful conduct.  We have interpreted the \"exercise of  reasonable diligence\"\r\nto mean that the injured party must act with some  promptness where the facts and circumstances of an injury place a \r\nreasonable person of common knowledge and experience on notice that  a claim against another party might exist.  Moreover,\r\nthe fact that the  injured party may not comprehend the full extent of the damage is  immaterial.\r\n\r\n\r\nDean, 321 S.C. 360, 363-64, 468 S.E.2d 645, 647 (1996) (citations omitted).     \r\n4.     Defense Counsel:  And you were again told that you had a hearing loss.  I believe you said a slight hearing loss.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Schurlknight:  Slight hearing loss but that they would monitor it.\r\n\r\n  Q:  And at that visit on February 29th of 1996 , Dr. Weissglass also told you that your hearing loss was probably caused from\r\nbeing around sirens and air horns for 20 years?\r\n\r\n  A: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  Q: So, in February of '96 you were aware that you had a hearing loss?\r\n\r\n  A: Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n  Q: And that it was probably caused by loud noises on the job?\r\n\r\n  A: Right. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3325","title":"Father v.

(1)  Father cross-appeals, alleging he is entitled to sanctions against the Department under Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules\r\nof Civil Procedure.  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND FACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\nFather received legal custody of his two minor sons, Child 1 and Child 2, pursuant to a divorce and custody decree dated March 2, 1995.  The custody issue was\r\nstrongly contested by the children's mother.  In an unpublished opinion dated February 9, 1998, this court affirmed the custody decision.\r\n\r\nOn June 8, 1998, the Department received a report of suspected child abuse concerning Child 2, the younger child, who was then twelve years old. (2) Among\r\nother things, the reporter of the alleged incident stated to the Department that Father had shoved a pot scrubber brush into Child 2's mouth and hit him in the\r\nchest. (3)  Another intake report, dated June 10, 1998, noted additional concerns. (4)  After receiving these reports, the Department initiated an investigation.\r\n\r\nOn June 22, 1998, a Department investigator met with both Father and the children in Father's home.  After interviewing both children together without Father\r\nbeing present in the room, the investigator discussed the matter with Father.  Early in his interview with the investigator, Father signed a treatment plan\r\npresented by the investigator after being assured by the investigator that the plan would not go into effect until a thorough investigation was done.  Father also\r\nsigned a release authorizing any hospital, physician, school, clinic, or law enforcement agency to furnish information regarding the children to the investigator.\r\n\r\nAs the interview progressed, however, Father began to have concerns that the investigator was unwilling to review information he had sent her earlier about the\r\ncustody suit.  Consequently, Father contacted his attorney, who that same day sent a letter to the Department stating Father was rescinding the release and his\r\nagreement regarding the treatment plan, but both he and counsel would cooperate in the investigation.  On July 2, 1998, Father's attorney hand-delivered to the\r\ninvestigator various documents from the prior custody action and subsequent appeal.\r\n\r\nThe Department concluded its investigation on July 29, 1998, and determined the case was indicated (5) for threat of physical abuse and mental injury.  A\r\nDetermination Fact Sheet dated July 31, 1998, cited certain \"FACTS/OBSERVATIONS\" (6) to support its decision and noted these facts or observations were\r\nsupported by the children's statements and \"collaterals.\"\r\n\r\nOn August 12, 1998, Father's attorney sent a letter to counsel for the Department, requesting an internal appeal of the Department's determination that the\r\nreport was founded. (7)  The Department, however, transferred the case to a caseworker, who designed a treatment plan requiring counseling and continued\r\nmonitoring. (8)  In August 1998, the Department prepared a \"court information sheet\" in anticipation of seeking judicial approval for intervention.\r\n\r\nOn September 2, 1998, Father's attorney wrote to counsel for the Department, noting among other things that \"DSS did not communicate with the children's\r\ncounselor or their prior Guardian ad Litem.\"  On or about September 18, 1998, counsel for the Department left a voice message for Father's attorney stating the\r\naction would proceed in family court.\r\n\r\nOn September 22, 1998, however, before the Department initiated any court action, Father filed the present lawsuit, seeking an order determining the case to be\r\nunfounded.  On September 25, 1998, the family court, after a hearing on September 23, issued an order:  (1) appointing Dr. Jane Rankin, the guardian ad litem\r\nfor the children in the custody matter, to serve in the same capacity in the present action; (2) appointing Tony M. Jones to serve as attorney for the guardian ad\r\nlitem; and (3) restraining all Department employees from contacting the children without obtaining permission at least two days in advance from Rankin, Jones,\r\nand Father's attorneys.  On November 9, 1998, the Department answered, seeking an order dismissing the action. (9)  \r\n\r\nThe family court held a final hearing on March 3, 1999.  At the hearing, Father submitted an affidavit in support of attorney fees and costs and moved for\r\nsanctions pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act and Rule 11 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\n\r\nBy order dated May 17, 1999, the family court found that \r\n  \"[t]he DSS case shall be unfounded and dismissed.\" In the order, the family \r\n  court also declined to award Father attorney fees, costs, and sanctions. In \r\n  support of its decision to deny this request, the family court cited Spartanburg \r\n  County Department of Social Services v. Little to support its holding that \r\n  \"S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 . . . disallows recovery of attorney's fees against \r\n  the State in all child abuse and neglect actions, regardless of whether the \r\n  State lacked substantial justification to press the claim.\" \r\n  (10) As to the applicability of the South Carolina Frivolous Civil \r\n  Proceedings Sanctions Act, the family court held \"that statute does not specifically \r\n  override the provisions of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-77-300 . . . , which specifically \r\n  precludes the award of fees against the State in child abuse and neglect actions.\" \r\n  Similarly, the family court held \"Rule 11 does not specifically provide that \r\n  it is applicable to the award of attorney's fees against the State in child \r\n  abuse and neglect actions.\" \r\n\r\nPursuant to Father's motion to alter or amend, however, the family court awarded Father $22,000 in attorney fees pursuant to the South Carolina Frivolous Civil\r\nProceedings Sanctions Act.  In granting Father relief under the Act, the family court held the Department \"failed to conduct a proper or suitable investigation\r\nand the limited investigation it did conduct was performed in a grossly negligent manner.\"  In so holding, the family court reasoned:\r\n\r\n\r\nDSS did not act to secure a proper purpose.  I find and conclude that if DSS had thoroughly investigated this matter, they could not have reasonably believed in\r\nthe existence of the facts upon which its claims and defenses have been based.  The findings of DSS against [Father] were frivolous.  I further find and conclude\r\nthat this litigation was extended because of the failure of DSS to properly investigate the allegations, and then they continued a vigorous defense of this case,\r\ndespite the lack of credible evidence of abuse and neglect. . . . DSS form 3027 indicates DSS had full knowledge at the beginning of its investigation that the\r\nchildren's mother . . . was making the report, that she had lost custody as a result of the Family Court trial and an appeal.  DSS also had full knowledge at the\r\nbeginning of its investigation that the mother had psychological problems and had been attempting to alienate the children from their father.  DSS failed to\r\nconduct a proper or suitable investigation and failed to consider the evidence provided by [Father] prior to indicating the case.  Because DSS was aware that the\r\nmother was the reporter, the prior litigation between the parents and the circumstances surrounding that litigation were relevant for consideration in the\r\ninvestigation of the abuse allegations. \r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Department's Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Department first asserts the family court erred in \r\n  reversing its initial ruling that attorney fees are not available under South \r\n  Carolina Department of Social Services v. Little. \r\n  (11) In support of its position, the Department contends that, notwithstanding \r\n  the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act, it is statutorily \r\n  exempt from the assessment of sanctions in the form of attorney fees in child \r\n  abuse and neglect actions. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"The Court's primary function in interpreting a statute is to ascertain the intent of the General Assembly.\" (12)  That intent must be gleaned from the language\r\nchosen by the legislature. (13)  Statutes, however, should be \"construed with reference to the whole system of law of which they form a part.\" (14)  A statute as a\r\nwhole \"must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.\" (15)        \r\n\r\nUnder South Carolina Code section 15-77-300, a prevailing party who has contested state action may \"recover reasonable attorney's fees to be taxed as court\r\ncosts against the appropriate agency\" upon findings by the trial court \"that the agency acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim\" and \"there are\r\nno special circumstances that would make the award of attorney's fees unjust.\" (16)  The statute, however, further provides that \"[t]he provisions of this section\r\ndo not apply to . . . child abuse and neglect actions.\" (17)\r\n\r\nIn Little, the South Carolina Supreme Court held \r\n  section 15-77-300 precluded the family court from assessing attorney fees and \r\n  costs against the state in a child abuse and neglect action notwithstanding \r\n  the enactment of South Carolina Code section 20-7-420(38), which allows for \r\n  the assessment of \"suit money, including attorney's fees . . . for or against \r\n  a party to an action brought in or subject to the jurisdiction of the family \r\n  court.\" (18) Recovery under section 20-7-420(38), \r\n  however, does not require a showing of bad faith on the part of the party against \r\n  whom fees and costs are sought.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act provides for the assessment of attorney fees and court costs against \"[a]ny person\r\nwho takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding if:  (1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of\r\nsecuring the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon which the proceedings are based;  and (2) the proceedings have terminated in\r\nfavor of the person seeking an assessment of the fees and costs.\" (19)  The Act expressly defines the term \"person\" to include \"any governmental entity.\" (20) \r\nUnlike section 15-77-300, it has no provisions prohibiting its application against the state in child abuse and neglect actions.\r\n\r\nThe text of sections 15-36-10 through -50 refers only to assessments in the form of attorney fees and court costs.  Nevertheless, we believe these provisions can\r\nbe reconciled with section 15-77-300.  The very fact that the legislature entitled this chapter the \"South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act\"\r\nindicates the chapter was not enacted solely to compensate an aggrieved party for expenses incurred to fight a baseless claim. (21)  Moreover, this legislation is\r\nunique in that it requires a litigant seeking relief under its provisions to show the adverse party acted to further a purpose that is not a legitimate objective of\r\ngood faith litigation.  This requirement goes beyond showing the adverse party \"acted without substantial justification in pressing its claim,\" the prerequisite for\r\nrecovering against a governmental agency under section 15-77-300.\r\n\r\nIn view of the designation of sections 15-36-10 through -50 as a \"sanctions act\" and the stringent requirements for recovery under these provisions, we hold an\r\naward of sanctions against the South Carolina Department of Social Services in a child abuse and neglect action is not necessarily barred by section 15-77-300. \r\nAlthough awards under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act are limited to attorney fees and costs, this limitation serves only as a\r\nmeasure of the sanctions allowable under the Act and does not undermine the fundamental objective of deterring egregious misuses of the court system by\r\ngovernmental agencies as well as by private parties. (22)\r\n\r\n2.  We disagree with the Department's argument that the family court did not have jurisdiction to determine what constitutes a negligent child protective\r\nservices investigation.  Liability under the Act can attach upon the requisite showing of inappropriate conduct in \"any civil proceeding.\" (23)  Without question,\r\nthe family court has jurisdiction to interpret and apply the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. (24)        \r\n\r\n3.  The Department further contends that an award of attorney fees was error because its case decision was not an adjudication of civil proceedings.  In our\r\nview, this argument evidences a misunderstanding of the procedural history of this case and the reasoning behind the family court's decision to impose\r\nsanctions.   The sanctions were based not only on the family court's finding that the Department \"failed to thoroughly investigate this matter . . . and . . .\r\n[Father] was unable to have the case unfounded by any other means,\" but also on its determination that, even after the lawsuit was filed, the Department and its\r\nattorneys failed to further investigate the allegations against Father despite numerous opportunities to do so. (25)\r\n\r\n4.  Regarding the merits of the Department's appeal, however, we hold the facts of this case do not warrant the harsh sanctions imposed by the family court.\r\n\r\n\"The determination of whether attorney's fees should be awarded under the Frivolous Proceedings Act is treated as one in equity.\" (26)  In reviewing such an\r\naward, an appellate court may take its own view of the evidence. (27)\r\n\r\nA litigant seeking relief under the Act \"has the burden of proving\" all the statutory prerequisites for recovery, including a showing that \"the primary purpose for\r\nwhich the proceedings were procured, initiated, continued, or defended was not that of securing the proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the\r\ncivil proceedings . . . .\" (28)  Moreover, the Act expressly provides that a person \"must be considered to have acted to secure a proper purpose . . . if he reasonably\r\nbelieves in the existence of the facts upon which his claim is based and . . . reasonably believes that under those facts his claim may be valid under the existing\r\nor developing law . . . .\" (29)\r\n\r\nWe are mindful of the problems cited by both Father and the family court concerning the Department's investigation of the serious allegations in the report. \r\nNevertheless, we hold the preponderance of the evidence shows Father failed to meet his burden of proving the Department did not act to secure a proper\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent from Father's own testimony that he held a device used to clean the household toilets two or three inches from Child 2's face, at which time the\r\nchild \"swung at\" his father.  Despite the confusion as to whether the device was a pot scrubber or a toilet brush, the conflicting evidence as to whether the\r\ndevice was actually placed in the child's mouth, and the Department's failure to make certain inquiries requested by Father and his attorneys, it is our view,\r\nafter reviewing the record in its entirety, that Father did not show the Department's decision to pursue the matter further was unreasonable or improperly\r\nmotivated.\r\n\r\nFirst, regardless of whether the device involved was a pot scrubber or a toilet brush, it was undisputed that it had been used to clean toilets.  We cannot fault the\r\ninvestigator for her concern \"that they could receive e-coli from a toilet brush after it has been in a commode.\" \r\n\r\nSecond, the Department's decision to become involved in the case was based not only on Father's allegedly pushing a toilet brush into Child 2's mouth, but\r\nalso on concerns of mental injury to both children.  Whether or not the specific allegations of mental injury were true, the Department investigator testified in\r\nher deposition that, while she was interviewing Child 1 and Child 2, both children would \"freeze\" and \"hush\" when Father would walk back and forth.  When\r\nthe investigator asked the children whether they were \"scared of somebody,\" both children became visibly upset. (30)  The investigator described the \"demeanor\r\nof the children and how they cringed every time [Father] would walk past the doorway\" to other Department employees before a group determination as to how\r\nto proceed on the case was made.\r\n\r\nFinally, notwithstanding vigorous arguments by Father's attorneys about the Department's alleged refusal to interview certain mental health professionals, the\r\nevidence at trial fails to convince us that the information these professionals would have given had they been consulted earlier would have been sufficient to\r\nalleviate the concerns raised in the report.   \r\n\r\nDr. Tyson, who performed psychological examinations on the children for the custody action in 1994, was not actively involved with the family at the time of\r\nthe present lawsuit, some four years later.  He stated his current contact with Father and the children consisted of \"casual observation\" and \"regular feedback\"\r\nfrom Dr. Marcus, the children's current counselor. (31)  \r\n\r\nFrom what we can tell, Dr. Marcus, the children's current counselor, did not testify at the hearing, either in person or by deposition, and the record on appeal\r\ndoes not include any reports or other documents from her about the case.  Moreover, Dr. Tyson testified that Dr. Marcus was seeing the children only on an \"as\r\nneeded\" basis, presumably as determined by Father, and appointments had become increasingly less frequent because the relationship between Father and the\r\nchildren had stabilized since the time Father and the children's mother had divorced.\r\n\r\nAlthough Dr. Rankin served as guardian ad litem for the children in both the custody action and the present matter, the portion of her testimony reproduced in\r\nthe record was unclear as to the extent of her involvement with the children at the time the matter first came to the Department's attention.  Moreover, Dr.\r\nRankin's testimony concerning what Child 2 told her about the altercation appears to support the Department's concerns that the child was afraid of his\r\nfather. (32)    \r\n\r\nThe specific factual circumstances of this case, then, warrant a finding by this court that Father did not show the Department abused its discretion in\r\ndetermining the reports it had received against him were \"indicated.\" (33)  We therefore reverse the family court's imposition of sanctions against the Department.\r\n\r\nFather's Appeal\r\n\r\n\r\nFather asserts the family court erred in failing to award sanctions in the form of attorney fees against the Department pursuant to Rule 11 of the South Carolina\r\nRules of Civil Procedure.  We disagree.\r\n\r\nRule 11(a), SCRCP, provides in part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nThe signature of an attorney or party constitutes a certificate by him that he has read the pleading, motion or other paper; that to the best of his knowledge,\r\ninformation and belief there is good ground to support it; and that it is not interposed for delay.\r\n\r\n      . . . \r\n\r\nIf a pleading, motion or other paper is signed in violation of this Rule, the court, upon motion or upon its own initiative, may impose upon the person who\r\nsigned it, a represented party, or both, an appropriate sanction, which may include an order to pay to the other party or parties the amount of the reasonable\r\nexpenses incurred because of the filing of the pleading, motion or other paper, including a reasonable attorney's fee.  \r\n\r\n\r\nThe criteria for Rule 11 sanctions are essentially the same as those for sanctions under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act. (34) \r\nBecause we have held that the facts of this case do not warrant the imposition of sanctions against the Department pursuant to the Act, we likewise affirm the\r\nfamily court's refusal to sanction the Department under Rule 11.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nCURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n1.

As noted in the excerpt from the appealed order quoted later in this opinion, the Department knew the reporter was the children's mother.\r\n3.   The maltreatment factors enumerated in the intake sheet were as follows:\r\n\r\nR/S physical violence in the home by Dad.  Saturday afternoon Dad shoved a pot scrubber brush in child's mouth and hit the child in the chest.  R/S [Child 1]\r\nheard what was going on - he is not abused by the Dad.  R/S child was upset and crying.\r\n4.   The intake sheet dated June 10, 1998, stated:\r\n\r\nR/S Gun in the home.  R/S Dad screams all the time; was taking tranquilizers in the past.  Dad is very strong and is a control freak.  Boys are afraid of dad. \r\nChild has run away in the past out of fear of dad.  Dad destroys anything given to the children.  The younger child would rather be in foster care.\r\n5.  See S.C. Code Ann.

The \"FACTS/OBSERVATIONS\" cited on the Determination Fact Sheet to support the Department's decision were as follows: \r\n\r\n\r\n[Father] pushed a toilet brush into [Child 2's] mouth that had been used to clean the toilets before.\r\n\r\n[Father] cusses [sic] at the children and calls them \"faggots.\"\r\n\r\n[Child 2] and [Child 1] are scared of [Father].\r\n\r\n[Father] pushed the children w/ his fingers in their chest.\r\n\r\n7.

The treatment plan form noted Father was not cooperating and contained a handwritten notation stating \"client fighting finding.\"  \r\n9.   Correspondence included in the record indicates the Department received another report against Father on or about September 28, 1998, concerning events\r\nthat allegedly occurred on September 27, 1998.  It appears from this correspondence that Father's attorneys were made aware that the reporter was the\r\nchildren's mother.

And you don't - - - Obviously - - - How old is - - - [Child 1 is] 14 - - - for a boy to cry that old - - - Nobody can manipulate you to the point of\r\nsomebody crying in front of a stranger that he doesn't even know.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we believe Father mischaracterizes the investigator's assessment of the children's statement that they were living with their father because \"dad\r\npaid the judge off.\"  Contrary to what Father says in his respondent's brief, the investigator never said she found this statement credible, only that she felt the\r\nchildren believed what they were saying and she could not rule out anything.\r\n31.   In fact, Dr. Tyson's reports had been sent to the investigator by either Glenn or his attorneys, and the investigator testified she had considered them but did\r\nnot give them any weight because \"Dr. Tyson's statements were before this case.\"\r\n32.   On direct examination by her attorney, Dr. Rankin stated, \"As [Father] walked past [Child 2], [Child 2] said he put his hand up to defend himself because\r\nhe thought he was going to push it at him, and that is all [Child 2] told me.\"\r\n33.

Verdery brought this action seeking to set aside a power of attorney \r\n  and a revocation of an earlier power of attorney, both executed by her mother, \r\n  Doris W. Thames. Verdery alleges that on December&nbsp;16, 1996, the date both \r\n  documents were executed, Thames lacked mental capacity. The probate court dismissed \r\n  Verdery's action, holding Thames was mentally competent when she executed the \r\n  power of attorney in favor of Betty Jane Daniels and revoked the former power \r\n  of attorney which appointed Verdery her attorney in fact. The circuit court \r\n  affirmed. Verdery appeals, and we affirm.\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\nThames, who was \r\n  in her late eighties at the time of trial, has been married to Harry A. Thames \r\n  (Mr. Thames) since 1969. Verdery and Daniels are her daughters from a previous \r\n  marriage, and Daniels' husband, C. Covert Daniels, is her son-in-law. \r\n  \r\n\r\nThames had been living with her husband, but in \r\n  the latter part of 1995 she began living at Verdery's home in Orangeburg. During \r\n  March of 1996, Verdery attempted to have a guardian and a conservator appointed \r\n  for her mother, apparently on the ground that her mother suffered from dementia \r\n  and was mentally incompetent. After reviewing the medical evidence, the probate \r\n  court declined Verdery's request, concluding Thames was mentally competent. \r\n  \r\n\r\nIn May of 1996, Thames, while still living with \r\n  Verdery, executed a durable power of attorney in Verdery's favor. In the summer \r\n  of that year, Mr. Thames brought a family court action seeking visitation with \r\n  or custody of his wife. Under a consent order in that case, Thames remained \r\n  in Verdery's home, but other family members, including her husband, were granted \r\n  limited visitation. The order also prohibited family members from discussing \r\n  or transacting business during these visits. The court later held Mr. Thames \r\n  in contempt after he, Daniels, and Daniels' son, during a visit with Thames, \r\n  took her to a bank where she withdrew money and refused to return her to Verdery's \r\n  home. The family court's order included the following statements regarding Thames' \r\n  competency:\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Defendant, Doris O. [sic] Thames, is not competent \r\n    to manage her affairs. Dr. Vann Beth Shuler expressed her medical opinion \r\n    that Defendant Thames was not competent. The Court further finds from Defendant \r\n    Thames' testimony that she is not competent and has very little memory. \r\n\r\n  . . .\r\n\r\n  It appears that Defendant Thames is not competent \r\n    and constantly gives contradictory statements. \r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Thames later brought an action in probate court \r\n  to have a guardian appointed for Thames, alleging she was an \"incapacitated \r\n  person.\" The court appointed him guardian, noting that the parties' counsel \r\n  stipulated that she was incapacitated. In its order, the probate court discussed \r\n  in detail the difference between a guardian and a conservator. The court did \r\n  not appoint a conservator. \r\n\r\nLess than one month later, Thames executed the \r\n  documents which are the subject of this lawsuit. In addition to asking that \r\n  the documents be set aside, Verdery asked the court to recognize her as the \r\n  attorney in fact for Thames, enjoin Daniels and her husband from interfering \r\n  with Verdery's management of Thames' business affairs, order Daniels and her \r\n  husband to make an accounting to Verdery regarding transfers of Thames' real \r\n  and personal property, and award Verdery attorney's fees and costs.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nWhile Verdery raises several grounds for appeal, \r\n  her arguments essentially boil down to two main issues: (1) what is the applicable \r\n  standard of review for an appellate court in an action to set aside a power \r\n  of attorney and a revocation of a power of attorney for lack of mental capacity; \r\n  and (2) based on the appropriate standard of review, did the circuit court err \r\n  in affirming the probate court's finding that Thames was competent to execute \r\n  the challenged documents on December 16, 1996?\r\n\r\nI. Standard of Review\r\n\r\nVerdery first argues the circuit court erred in \r\n  concluding this was an action at law and thus applied the wrong standard of \r\n  review. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe standard of review applicable to cases originating \r\n  in the probate court is controlled by whether the underlying cause of action \r\n  is at law or in equity. Howard v. Mutz, 315 S.C. 356, 361-62, 434 S.E.2d 254, \r\n  257-58 (1993) (noting the circuit court may not disturb the probate court's \r\n  findings of fact on appeal in an action at law unless there is no evidence to \r\n  support them as compared to an equitable action in which the circuit court may \r\n  make factual findings according to its own view of the preponderance of evidence). \r\n  The question of whether an action to set aside a power of attorney and a revocation \r\n  of a power of attorney on the ground of mental incompetency is at law or in \r\n  equity has not been previously addressed in South Carolina. Therefore, we must \r\n  examine a power of attorney, and the capacity required to execute and revoke \r\n  one, in light of other existing legal authority to determine the nature of Verdery's \r\n  cause of action.\r\n\r\nBoth Verdery and Daniels compare the current lawsuit \r\n  to actions to set aside other legal instruments or transactions on the basis \r\n  of a lack of mental capacity. Verdery argues that her cause of action is akin \r\n  to an action to set aside a deed or petition signature on the basis of mental \r\n  incompetence, which is an action in equity. Vereen v. Bell, 256 S.C. \r\n  249, 251-52, 182 S.E.2d 296, 297 (1971) (applying an equitable standard of review \r\n  on appeal for an action to rescind and cancel a deed for lack of capacity); \r\n  Ballenger v. City of Inman, 336 S.C. 126, 130, 518 S.E.2d 824, 827 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999) (applying an equitable standard of review on appeal for an action \r\n  to set aside the signature on land annexation petition for lack of mental capacity). \r\n  Likewise, an action to rescind a contract is in equity. Gibbs v. G.K.H., \r\n  Inc., 311 S.C. 103, 105, 427 S.E.2d 701, 702 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\n\r\nDaniels, on the other hand, equates the current \r\n  action to a will contest, which is an action at law. Estate of Cumbee v. \r\n  Cumbee, 333 S.C. 664, 670, 511 S.E.2d 390, 393 (Ct. App. 1999). This general \r\n  principle applies even when the ground for setting aside the will is lack of \r\n  mental capacity. Estate of Weeks v. Drawdy, 329 S.C. 251, 262, 495 S.E.2d \r\n  454, 460 (Ct. App. 1997) (applying a legal standard of review on appeal in an \r\n  action to set aside a will on the sole ground of lack of capacity).\r\n\r\nA durable power of attorney allows a person, the \r\n  principal, to designate another as his or her attorney in fact to act on the \r\n  principal's behalf as provided in the document even if the principal becomes \r\n  mentally incompetent. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-501 (Supp. 2000); see also \r\n  3 Am. Jur. 2d Agency Â§ 23 (1986) (\"A power of attorney is an instrument \r\n  in writing by which one person, as principal, appoints another as his agent \r\n  and confers upon him the authority to perform certain specified acts or kinds \r\n  of acts on behalf of the principal. The written authorization itself is the \r\n  power of attorney.\" (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\nWith a durable power of attorney, a principal creates \r\n  an agency in another that continues despite the principal's later physical disability \r\n  or mental incompetency. See Â§ 62-5-501; see also 3 Am. Jur. 2d \r\n  Agency Â§ 28 (\"The only requirement is that an instrument creating a durable \r\n  power contain language showing that the principal intends the agency to remain \r\n  effective in spite of his later incompetency.&quot;). Moreover, in order for \r\n  the principal to create the agency relationship in the first instance, the principal \r\n  must have the mental capacity to contract. 3 Am. Jur. 2d Agency Â§ 12 \r\n  (\"A person who is not in a mental condition to contract and conduct his business \r\n  is not in a condition to appoint an agent for that purpose.\"). Therefore, in \r\n  order to execute or revoke a valid power of attorney, the principal must possess \r\n  contractual capacity.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has defined contractual capacity \r\n  as a person's ability to understand, at the time the contract is executed, the \r\n  nature of the contract and its effect. In re: Nightingale's Estate, 182 \r\n  S.C. 527, 542, 189 S.E. 890, 896 (1937) (\"[A] mere infirmity of mind, if it \r\n  does not amount to an incapacity to understand, at the time of the execution \r\n  of a contract, the nature of the act done and the effect thereof, . . . does \r\n  not render a person incapable of executing a valid and binding contract.\"); \r\n  see also 53 Am. Jur. 2d Mentally Impaired Persons Â§ 156 (1996) \r\n  (\"The test for lack of [contractual] capacity is generally said to be whether \r\n  an individual lacks sufficient mental capacity to understand in a reasonable \r\n  manner the nature of the transaction in which he or she is engaging, and to \r\n  understand its consequences and effect upon his or her rights and interests.\" \r\n  (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions addressing this issue have \r\n  found contractual capacity is required to execute a power of attorney. Younggren \r\n  v. Younggren, 556 N.W.2d 228, 232 (Minn. Ct. App. 1996) (holding a person \r\n  is competent when he signs a power of attorney if he has sufficient mental capacity \r\n  to understand, to a reasonable degree, the nature and effect of his act); Testa \r\n  v. Roberts, 542 N.E.2d 654, 658 (Ohio Ct. App. 1988) (\"[For a power of attorney,] \r\n  the test to be used to determine mental capacity is the ability of the principal \r\n  to understand the nature, scope and the extent of the business she is about \r\n  to transact.\").\r\n\r\nBecause a person must possess contractual capacity \r\n  to execute or revoke a valid power of attorney, we believe a cause of action \r\n  to set aside such a document is more closely akin to an action to set aside \r\n  a contract, deed, or petition than it is to a will contest. Additionally, the \r\n  reasoning of courts from other jurisdictions analogizing powers of attorney \r\n  to contracts lends persuasive influence to this conclusion. \r\n  (1) Moreover, \"[p]ersons of unsound minds, like infants, are under \r\n  the special protection of the courts of equity with respect to their persons, \r\n  property, and legal transactions.\" Shepard v. First Am. Mortgage Co., \r\n  289 S.C. 516, 518, 347 S.E.2d 118, 119 (Ct. App. 1986). Therefore, we hold that \r\n  an action to set aside a power of attorney and an instrument revoking a power \r\n  of attorney on the ground of a lack of mental capacity sounds in equity.\r\n\r\nIn an equitable action, tried by the judge alone, \r\n  without a reference, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in accordance \r\n  with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Townes Assoc. v. \r\n  City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976); Greer \r\n  v. Spartanburg Technical Coll., 338 S.C. 76, 79, 524 S.E.2d 856, 858 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1999). However, this broad scope of review does not require the appellate \r\n  court to ignore the findings below when the trial court was in a better position \r\n  to evaluate the credibility of the witnesses. Greer, 338 S.C. at 79, \r\n  524 S.E.2d at 858; see also Dorchester County Dep't of Soc. Servs. \r\n  v. Miller, 324 S.C. 445, 452, 477 S.E.2d 476, 480 (Ct. App. 1996). In addition, \r\n  the appellant still has the burden of convincing this court the trial judge \r\n  committed error in his findings. Greer, 338 S.C. at 79, 524 S.E.2d at \r\n  858; see also Dorchester County, 324 S.C. at 452, 477 S.E.2d at \r\n  480. Even though the circuit court applied an erroneous scope of review, that \r\n  does not end the inquiry because we are at liberty to find the facts in accordance \r\n  with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n    II. Thames' Competency  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Verdery poses some twenty-two issues on \r\n  appeal, they all hinge on the question of Thames' mental capacity as of December \r\n  16, 1996. \r\n\r\nHaving carefully reviewed the record, we find ample \r\n  evidence to support the probate court's finding that Thames possessed the requisite \r\n  mental capacity to execute the challenged instruments on the date in question. \r\n  Where a transaction is challenged on the ground of mental incompetency, the \r\n  individual's competency on the date of that transaction must be determined. \r\n  Grapner v. Atlantic Land Title Co., 307 S.C. 549, 551, 416 S.E.2d 617, \r\n  618 (1992). Furthermore, the party alleging incompetence bears the burden of \r\n  proving incapacity at the time of the transaction by a preponderance of the \r\n  evidence. Id. We agree with the circuit court and the probate court that Verdery \r\n  failed to meet her burden.\r\n\r\nAt trial, Verdery relied primarily on the probate \r\n  court's order appointing Thames' husband her guardian as evidence of her lack \r\n  of mental capacity on the date in question. Verdery's reliance on this order \r\n  is misplaced. In that action, counsel for the parties stipulated Thames was \r\n  incapacitated and in need of a guardian. The probate court, however, discussed \r\n  the difference between a guardianship and a conservatorship, including the respective \r\n  duties of each. (2) Because the court appointed \r\n  a guardian for Thames and not a conservator, the court's reference to her as \r\n  incapacitated can only be seen as an adjudication of her physical condition. \r\n  We do not view the probate court's order in this action as an adjudication of \r\n  Thames' mental capacity.\r\n\r\nVerdery also points to the family court's October \r\n  1996 contempt order as proof that Thames lacked mental capacity to revoke her \r\n  old power of attorney and issue a new one. Although the family court's order \r\n  makes several references to Thames as incompetent and unable to manage her affairs, \r\n  such language was mere dicta since it was irrelevant to the court's decision \r\n  to hold Thames' husband in contempt. Furthermore, the family court lacks jurisdiction \r\n  to declare an adult incompetent because the probate court has exclusive jurisdiction \r\n  over such matters. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-1-302(a)(2) (Supp. 2000).\r\n\r\nEven if we were to consider these two orders as \r\n  adjudications of Thames' mental incompetency, they still would not be dispositive \r\n  in this case. An adjudication of incompetency is merely prima facie evidence \r\n  of that fact. Grapner, 307 S.C. at 551, 416 S.E.2d at 618. A prior adjudication \r\n  of an individual's incompetence does not conclusively bind the trial court in \r\n  another action where the person's competency is directly at issue. Church \r\n  v. Trotter, 278 S.C. 504, 506, 299 S.E.2d 332, 333 (1983) (\"In a contract \r\n  setting, particularly, this Court has looked specifically to the condition of \r\n  a party at the time of a transaction.\").\r\n\r\nIn addition to the probate court and family \r\n  court orders, Verdery offered the testimony of Dr. Vann Beth Meyers Shuler, \r\n  who examined Thames upon a prior probate judge's request and found her mentally \r\n  incompetent to make decisions regarding her welfare or finances. Doctor Shuler \r\n  reported Thames' mental deficiencies were permanent, thus supporting Verdery's \r\n  claim that Thames lacked capacity to execute the challenged documents. However, \r\n  Dr. Shuler also testified Thames had been incompetent since the first time she \r\n  saw her in February 1996. This testimony, if found to be credible, is in direct \r\n  conflict with the finding of the probate court in March 1996 that Thames was \r\n  mentally competent and would also invalidate the May 1996 power of attorney \r\n  in Verdery's favor that Verdery now seeks to enforce. Verdery subpoenaed Thames \r\n  to testify, but the trial court quashed the subpoena after hearing testimony \r\n  from Thames' personal physician that the stress of testifying would be hazardous \r\n  to Thames' physical health.   \r\n  (3)  \r\n\r\nFinally, Verdery herself testified that her mother \r\n  lacked mental capacity to revoke the earlier power of attorney and to issue \r\n  a new one on December 16, 1996. She also testified Daniels knew her mother lacked \r\n  mental capacity to execute such instruments. \r\n\r\nIn contrast to Verdery's offer of proof, Daniels \r\n  and her husband produced five witnesses who testified to Thames' mental capacity \r\n  in December of 1996. Rebecca Bryant, a certified nursing assistant, and Dorothy \r\n  Josey, a registered psychiatric nurse, visited Thames in her home in December \r\n  1996 to care for and examine her. Bryant testified that around Christmas of \r\n  1996, she saw Thames five times a week in visits lasting forty-five minutes \r\n  to an hour. Bryant recalled Thames' mental state was \"good\" for her age when \r\n  she saw her. Josey testified Thames was oriented to person, place, and time \r\n  during her December 19 and 20, 1996 visits. Likewise, when Josey saw Thames \r\n  on December 23 and 25, 1996, Thames was \"cooperative and talkative\" in addition \r\n  to being oriented to time, place and person. Doctor Lea B. Givens, Thames' personal \r\n  physician, saw Thames on December 12, 1996, and approximately thirteen other \r\n  times between September 1993 and August 1997. While Dr. Givens said he had not \r\n  conducted a detailed mental exam of Thames, he testified that each time he saw \r\n  her, Thames was pleasant, answered his questions, and was oriented to time and \r\n  place. \r\n\r\nThe other two witnesses, Angela Hester and Daniels, \r\n  were present on December 16, 1996, when Thames revoked her prior power of attorney \r\n  and executed a new one. Hester, a legal assistant at the law firm where Thames \r\n  executed the challenged instruments, signed the documents as a witness. She \r\n  specifically recalled explaining the documents to Thames and, when asked, Thames \r\n  told Hester she understood. Daniels testified she went with her mother to the \r\n  attorney's office and Thames \"knew exactly what she was doing\" when she signed \r\n  the disputed documents on December 16, 1996.\r\n\r\nThus, under either a legal or equitable standard \r\n  of review, we find the evidence contained in the record fully supports the probate \r\n  court's finding that Thames possessed the requisite mental capacity to execute \r\n  the documents in question on December 16, 1996.\r\n\r\nThe dispositive issues having been decided, any \r\n  remaining issues on appeal need not be addressed. Rule 220(b)(2), SCACR. \r\n\r\nFor the reasons discussed, the order of the circuit \r\n  court affirming the order of the probate court is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nANDERSON and HOWARD, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1. See Testa, \r\n  542 N.E.2d at 658 (recognizing a power of attorney is derived from the law of \r\n  contracts); see also Younggren, 556 N.W.2d at 234 (upholding the \r\n  trial court's determination that the rescission of a power of attorney on grounds \r\n  of mental incapacity was an equitable cause of action).  \r\n2.  The court noted, \"A guardian, \r\n  unlike a conservator, is appointed to protect the person of the incapacitated \r\n  person. This means . . . making provision[s] for the care, comfort and maintenance \r\n  of the incapacitated person.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. A conservator, on the other \r\n  hand, is named to act for an incapacitated person in dealing with property and \r\n  business affairs . . . .\" See also S.C. Code Ann.

Although Verdery challenged \r\n  the court's decision to quash Thames' subpoena at trial, she has not asserted \r\n  this as error on appeal. The unappealed decision of the trial court, right or \r\n  wrong, is the law of the case. Town of Mount Pleasant v. Jones, 335 S.C. \r\n  295, 298, 516 S.E.2d 468, 470 (Ct.
