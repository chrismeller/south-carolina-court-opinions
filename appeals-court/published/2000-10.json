Lingenfelter, \r\n          Jr., of Hanahan, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n________ \r\n   \r\nANDERSON, J.: Mark \r\n  Hadfield filed this action against Sam Gilchrist, d/b/a Gilchrist's Service \r\n  Center, and d/b/a Gilchrist Towing Company (Gilchrist) for damages sustained \r\n  by Hadfield's vehicle while impounded on Gilchrist's lot. The magistrate awarded \r\n  Hadfield $4,035.00. The Circuit Court affirmed the decision of the magistrate. \r\n  Gilchrist appeals. We affirm. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL \r\n  BACKGROUND \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGilchrist owns a motor vehicle \r\n  towing service and maintains a storage facility for the retention of the towed \r\n  vehicles. Gilchrist operates under a license issued by the City of Charleston. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHadfield, a medical student \r\n  at MUSC, went to retrieve his 1988 Lincoln Continental from the parking spot \r\n  where his wife parked the vehicle.(1) The parking \r\n  spot, located near MUSC, was on private property owned by Allen Saffer. Hadfield's \r\n  wife parked the vehicle on Saffer's property without Saffer's permission. The \r\n  vehicle was not in the parking spot when Hadfield arrived as Saffer had called \r\n  Gilchrist to have the vehicle removed. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGilchrist towed Hadfield's \r\n  car to his storage facility. Gilchrist maintained a chain link fence around \r\n  the storage area, and had an employee on the lot around the clock. The employees' \r\n  duties included periodically leaving the office to check on the storage area \r\n  which was some distance away from the office. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHadfield called to retrieve \r\n  his vehicle, but was informed he would have to wait until the next morning and \r\n  pay towing and storage fees. Upon Hadfield's arrival to pick up his car the \r\n  following morning, he paid the fees. When he went to the storage area to collect \r\n  his vehicle, Hadfield discovered the vehicle had been extensively vandalized. \r\n  The vandals stole the radio/compact disc player, smashed windows, and pulled \r\n  many electrical wires out of the dashboard. The vehicle depended heavily upon \r\n  computers and never functioned properly after the incident. The vandals entered \r\n  the storage area by cutting a hole in the fence. They vandalized between six \r\n  and eight vehicles on the lot that night. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe magistrate, in summarizing \r\n  Hadfield's testimony, concluded Hadfield's attempts to persuade Gilchrist to \r\n  pay for the damages were futile. Hadfield secured estimates for the damage to \r\n  the automobile. At trial before the magistrate, Hadfield offered the testimony \r\n  of an Assistant Manager at Rick Hendrick Collision Center. He estimated the \r\n  cost of the repairs at $4,021.43. Hadfield entered evidence showing replacement \r\n  glass cost $185.00, excluding installation cost of $55. Hadfield left the vehicle \r\n  on Gilchrist's lot as he could not afford to repair it. After more than 60 days \r\n  elapsed, Hadfield sold the vehicle for $1,000.00. \r\n   \r\nThe magistrate found Gilchrist \r\n  liable for the damages as a bailee, and entered judgment in favor of Hadfield \r\n  for $4,035.00. Gilchrist appealed to the Circuit Court, which affirmed the decision \r\n  of the magistrate. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSTANDARD \r\n  OF REVIEW \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe standard of review to \r\n  be applied by a Circuit Court in an appeal of a magistrate's judgment is prescribed \r\n  by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1976): \r\n  \r\n   \r\nUpon hearing the appeal \r\n  the appellate court shall give judgment according to the justice of the case, \r\n  without regard to technical errors and defects which do not affect the merits. \r\n  In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court \r\n  below, in whole or in part, as to any or all the parties and for errors of law \r\n  or fact. \r\n   \r\nIn Burns v. Wannamaker, \r\n  281 S.C. 352, 315 S.E.2d 179 (Ct. App. 1984), this Court amplified: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs is readily apparent, \r\n  Section 18-7-170 confers authority upon the Circuit Court to reverse a magistrate's \r\n  findings of fact when exercising appellate jurisdiction in an appeal from a \r\n  magistrate's judgment. See Dingle v. Northwestern R. Co., 112 \r\n  S.C. 390, 99 S.E. 828 (1919); Redfearn v. Douglass, 35 S.C. 569, 15 S.E. \r\n  244 (1892); cf. Vacation Time of Hilton Head Island, Inc. v. Kiwi \r\n  Corp., [280 S.C. 232], 312 S.E.2d 20 (Ct. App. 1984)(where the Circuit Court \r\n  reversed a magistrate's findings of fact in an ejectment action). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBurns, 281 S.C. at \r\n  357, 315 S.E.2d at 182.\r\n  \r\n   \r\nWhile the Circuit Court \r\n  maintains a broad scope of review, our standard is more limited:  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n[T]he Court of Appeals will \r\n  presume that an affirmance by a Circuit Court of a magistrate's judgment was \r\n  made upon the merits where the testimony is sufficient to sustain the judgment \r\n  of the magistrate and there are no facts that show the affirmance was influenced \r\n  by an error of law [Bagnal v. Southern Express Co., 106 S.C. 395, 400, \r\n  91 S.E. 334, 335-36 (1917); Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. 367, 369-70, 76 \r\n  S.E. 986, 986-87 (1913); see 5B C.J.S. Appeal &amp; Error Â§ 1817 \r\n  at 152-53 (1958) ] . . . . \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBurns, 281 S.C. at \r\n  357, 315 S.E.2d at 182. Our Supreme Court, in Stanford v. Cudd, 93 S.C. \r\n  367, 76 S.E. 986 (1913), held that where the testimony is sufficient to sustain \r\n  a judgment of the magistrate's court, and it is affirmed on appeal to the Circuit \r\n  Court, this Court will assume the Circuit Court affirmed the judgment on the \r\n  merits, in the absence of facts showing the affirmance was controlled or affected \r\n  by errors of law. The Court enunciated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn obedience to the statute \r\n  [S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170], the circuit court might have concluded that the \r\n  magistrate erred in refusing some or all of the defendant's requests, or in \r\n  admitting some or all of the testimony objected to by defendant, but the court \r\n  might have thought, upon consideration of the case on the merits, that, notwithstanding \r\n  such errors, the plaintiff was entitled to judgment; and as there was evidence \r\n  which would have warranted such a conclusion, and as we cannot say that the \r\n  judgment was affected or controlled by any error of law, it must be affirmed. \r\n   \r\nStanford, 93 S.C. \r\n  at 370, 76 S.E. at 987. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe rule is articulated \r\n  in Price v. Charleston &amp; W.C. Ry., 93 S.C. 576, 77 S.E. 703 (1913): \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs the circuit court is \r\n  required to give judgment, in such cases, according to the justice of the case, \r\n  without regard to technical errors and defects, which do not affect the merits \r\n  [S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170], and as the record does not disclose the grounds \r\n  upon which the court rendered its judgment, we must assume that it was rested \r\n  upon some sound and meritorious ground, and sustain it, if the record discloses \r\n  any such ground.\r\nPrice, 93 S.C. at \r\n  578, 77 S.E. at 703. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe Circuit Court judge's \r\n  order in this case provided: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAfter careful review of: \r\n  the Return of the Civil Appeal filed by the Magistrate, the pleadings, summary \r\n  of witness testimony, the exhibits and the case law submitted by both parties, \r\n  and appellant [sic] arguments by counsel representing each party, I find that \r\n  according to the justice of the case, the Judgment of the Small Claims Court \r\n  in the amount of $4,000.00 plus costs of $35.00 for a total of $4,035.00 is \r\n  affirmed. \r\n   \r\nUnless we find an error \r\n  of law, we will affirm the judge's holding if there are any facts supporting \r\n  his decision. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nISSUES \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Did the Circuit Court \r\n    err in applying the law of bailments?\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Circuit Court \r\n    err in finding Gilchrist was responsible for damages?\r\n   \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNeither the magistrate nor \r\n  the Circuit Court judge made a finding as to the type of bailment created in \r\n  this case. The type of bailment created may determine the standard of care the \r\n  bailee, Gilchrist, must meet. Therefore, we review the law of bailments. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nI. BAILMENTS \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA bailment is created by \r\n  the delivery of personal property by one person to another in trust for a specific \r\n  purpose, pursuant to an express or implied contract to fulfill that trust. 8A \r\n  Am. Jur. 2d Bailments Â§ 1 (1997). See Home Indem. Co. v. Harleysville \r\n  Mut. Ins. Co., 252 S.C. 452, 460, 166 S.E.2d 819, 824 (1969)(\"Bailment has \r\n  been defined as the delivery of a chattel for some express or particular purpose \r\n  upon a contract, express or implied, that, after the purpose has been fulfilled, \r\n  then the chattel shall be redelivered to the bailor, or otherwise dealt with \r\n  according to his directions.\"). \r\n  \r\n   \r\n Bailments are generally \r\n  classified as being for (1) the sole benefit of the bailor; (2) the sole benefit \r\n  of the bailee; or (3) the mutual benefit of both. 8A Am. Jur. 2d Bailments \r\n  Â§ 7 (1997). Bailments which benefit only one of the parties, the first and second \r\n  classifications, are often described as gratuitous. Id. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA. Gratuitous \r\n  Bailment \r\n   \r\n\"A gratuitous bailment is, \r\n  by definition, one in which the transfer of possession or use of the bailed \r\n  property is without compensation.\" 8A Am. Jur. 2d Bailments Â§ 8 (1997). \r\n  For instance, a gratuitous bailment arises if the bailment is undertaken as \r\n  a personal favor or is involuntary. See United States v. Alcaraz-Garcia, \r\n  79 F.3d 769 (9th Cir. 1996)(gratuitous bailment arises if bailment \r\n  is undertaken either involuntarily or as a personal favor). See also \r\n  McLaughlin v. Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co., 188 S.C. 358, 199 S.E. 413 (1938)(finding \r\n  that although the type of bailment created, where purchaser of new tires left \r\n  old tires at vendor's place of business for between five and seven months after \r\n  purchase, may have started as a bailment for mutual benefit, it ripened after \r\n  time into a gratuitous bailment, solely for the benefit of the bailor); Clott \r\n  v. Greyhound Lines, Inc., 180 S.E.2d 102 (N.C. 1971)(gratuitous bailment \r\n  effected where baggage came into hands of carrier through accident or mistake). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nA gratuitous bailee acts \r\n  without expectation of reward or compensation. See McLaughlin, \r\n  supra. To show the bailment was for the sole benefit of the bailor, the \r\n  bailee must establish that it was not expecting compensation. The Court, in \r\n  Brunson &amp; Boatwright v. Atlantic Coast Line R.R., 76 S.C. 9, 56 S.E. \r\n  538 (1907), illuminated: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe fact that it has the \r\n  right as a warehouseman to collect storage charges makes it a bailee for hire \r\n  and prevents it from claiming that it was merely a gratuitous bailee, at least \r\n  before it gives notice that it will not insist upon such charges, and will not \r\n  longer hold possession of the property as a warehouseman, which the testimony \r\n  does not show was done in this case. Therefore the defendant was not a gratuitous \r\n  bailee . . . . \r\n   \r\nBrunson, 76 S.C. \r\n  at 13-14, 56 S.E. at 539-40. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nB. Bailment \r\n  for Mutual Benefit \r\n  \r\n   \r\nBy contrast, a bailment \r\n  for the mutual benefit of the parties arises when one party takes the personal \r\n  property of another into his or her care or custody in exchange for payment \r\n  or other benefit. 8A Am. Jur. 2d Bailments Â§ 9 (1997). See Gilland \r\n  v. Peter's Dry Cleaning Co., 195 S.C. 417, 11 S.E.2d 857 (1940)(finding \r\n  a bailment for mutual benefit of the parties where plaintiff delivered a dinner \r\n  coat to a cleaning company for cleaning and pressing, and company was to be \r\n  paid a consideration for its services). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nC. Constructive \r\n  Bailment \r\n   \r\nAlthough a bailment is ordinarily \r\n  created by the agreement of the parties, the agreement of the parties may be \r\n  implied or constructive, and the bailment may arise by operation of law. 8 C.J.S. \r\n  Bailments Â§ 15 (1988). Such a constructive bailment arises when one person \r\n  has lawfully acquired possession of another's personal property, other than \r\n  by virtue of a bailment contract, and holds it under such circumstances that \r\n  the law imposes on the recipient of the property the obligation to keep it safely \r\n  and redeliver it to the owner. Id. See also American Ambassador \r\n  Cas. Co. v. City of Chicago, 563 N.E.2d 882 (Ill. App. Ct. 1990), appeal \r\n  denied, 567 N.E.2d 328 (Ill. 1991)(police department was constructive \r\n  bailee of automobile it impounded at time of driver's arrest and thus had duty \r\n  to keep automobile safely and deliver it to its owner). A constructive bailment \r\n  may occur even in the absence of the voluntary delivery and acceptance of the \r\n  property which is usually necessary to create a bailment relationship. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nGilchrist argues he towed \r\n  the vehicle pursuant to the Charleston Municipal Ordinances, and the ordinances \r\n  are for the sole benefit of the vehicle owners. Accordingly, he contends, the \r\n  relationship created is a gratuitous bailment. We disagree. Section 14-32 of \r\n  the City of Charleston, S.C., Municipal Ordinances reads in pertinent part: \r\n  \r\n   \r\nNo person shall abandon \r\n  any motor vehicle on any public street or public grounds or upon privately owned \r\n  property. No person controlling privately owned property shall permit any abandoned \r\n  or unsafe vehicle to remain thereon. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nSection 14-33 of the Municipal \r\n  Ordinances provides: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  Any abandoned motor vehicle \r\n    may be removed to a storage area for safekeeping by or at the direction of \r\n    the Police Department or such other person charged with enforcing the provisions \r\n    hereof.\r\n   \r\n   \r\n\r\nFinally, City of Charleston, \r\n  S.C., Municipal Ordinances Â§ 14-34 states: \r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\n  The owner of any removed \r\n    vehicle, before obtaining possession thereof, shall pay to the city or, as \r\n    appropriate, its agent storing said vehicle, all reasonable costs incidental \r\n    to the removal and storage (of the vehicle) and locating of the owner.\r\n  Should such owner fail \r\n    or refuse to pay the cost, or should the owner's identity or whereabouts be \r\n    unknown and unascertainable after a diligent search and after notice as herein \r\n    prescribed, the stored vehicle may be sold after twenty (20) days notice has \r\n    been given to the department of motor vehicles before the date of sale, and \r\n    after the vehicle has been held for not less than thirty (30) days.\r\n  \r\n   \r\n\r\nClearly, the ordinances \r\n  provide for the payment to the city or its agent, the towing service, for the \r\n  costs of towing and storage. Gilchrist charged Hadfield towing and storage fees. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe vehicle owned by Hadfield \r\n  was plucked by Gilchrist from the private property of Saffer. Gilchrist acted \r\n  pursuant to and by virtue of the licensing authority under the city ordinance. \r\n  Quintessentially, the factual scenario encapsulated in this case is a paradigm \r\n  of a \"constructive bailment.\" We conclude a constructive bailment, for the mutual \r\n  benefit of Hadfield and Gilchrist, was created. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nII. BAILMENT \r\n  ACTION/NATURE OF THEORY \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAlthough contractual in \r\n  nature, and involving the conveyance of personal property, an action for breach \r\n  of the duty of care by a bailor sounds in tort. See Kurt Philip Autor, \r\n  Note, Bailment Liability: Toward a Standard of Reasonable Care, 61 S. \r\n  Cal. L. Rev. 2117, 2124 (Sept. 1988)(\"Perhaps the most fundamental variance \r\n  in bailment classification results from the different theories upon which an \r\n  action in bailment might rest. Confusion is understandable considering the traditional \r\n  adage that a bailment arises in contract, involves the conveyance of personal \r\n  property, and is actionable sounding in tort.\"); Samuel Williston, Williston \r\n  on Contracts Â§ 8:1, at 12, 17 (Richard A. Lord ed., 4th ed. 1992)(bailment \r\n  transaction is regarded as contractual but \"it would perhaps have been better \r\n  to treat these cases as falling within the domain of tort . . . . [T]he true \r\n  nature of the liability is not contractual at all, for if it were, the only \r\n  question would be what the defendant promised\"; instead, bailee for mutual benefit \r\n  is liable for ordinary negligence). Concomitantly, after finding a bailment \r\n  for mutual benefit exists in this case, we must determine whether Hadfield is \r\n  entitled to damages, relying on the application of tort principles rather than \r\n  contract principles. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIII. BAILEE'S \r\n  DEGREE OF CARE/BURDEN OF PROOF \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe degree of care required \r\n  of a bailee for mutual benefit is defined as ordinary care, or due care, or \r\n  the degree of care which would be exercised by a person of ordinary care in \r\n  the protection of his own property. See Harris v. Burnside, 261 \r\n  S.C. 190, 199 S.E.2d 65 (1973)(bailment contract imposes upon bailee duty of \r\n  care, breach of which constitutes a tort); Shoreland Freezers, Inc. v. Textile \r\n  Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 241 S.C. 537, 129 S.E.2d 424 (1963)(finding when food \r\n  processor delivered goods to warehouse for storage, relationship of bailor and \r\n  bailee arose for their mutual benefit and, although warehouse owner was not \r\n  insurer of property left in its custody, it was required to exercise ordinary \r\n  care, or degree of care which would be exercised by person of ordinary care \r\n  and prudence in protection of his own property). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nIn a bailment action alleging \r\n  a breach of the duty of care, the bailor is entitled to be compensated for all \r\n  losses that are the natural consequence and proximate result of the bailee's \r\n  negligence. Dixon v. Besco Eng'g, Inc., 320 S.C. 174, 463 S.E.2d 636 \r\n  (Ct. App. 1995). \"Damages are proximately caused if they are the foreseeable \r\n  result of the defendant's tortious act.\" Id. at 180, 463 S.E.2d at 639 \r\n  (citing Young v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 242 S.E.2d 671 (1978)). \r\n  Proximate cause is a question for the finder of fact. Id.; Parr v. \r\n  Gaines, 309 S.C. 477, 424 S.E.2d 515 (Ct. App. 1992). See also Childers \r\n  v. Gas Lines, Inc., 248 S.C. 316, 149 S.E.2d 761 (1966)(questions of proximate \r\n  cause are normally within province of jury); Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. \r\n  389, 477 S.E.2d 715 (Ct. App. 1996) (ordinarily, question of proximate cause \r\n  is one of fact for jury and trial judge's sole function regarding the issue \r\n  is to inquire whether particular conclusions are the only reasonable inferences \r\n  that can be drawn from the evidence). The Supreme Court, in Shoreland Freezers, \r\n  supra, discussed a bailee's liability under a bailment for mutual benefit:\r\n \r\n Under the decided cases \r\n  in this State, liability of a bailee under a bailment for mutual benefit arises \r\n  upon a showing that (1) the goods were delivered to the bailee in good condition, \r\n  (2) they were lost or returned in a damaged condition, and (3) the loss or damage \r\n  to the goods was due to the failure of the bailee to exercise ordinary care \r\n  in the safekeeping of the property. The burden of proof in such cases, in the \r\n  first instance, rests upon the bailor to make out a prima facie case. This has \r\n  been done when the bailor proves that he delivered the goods to the bailee in \r\n  good condition and their loss or return in a damaged condition. When the bailor \r\n  has so proven, the burden is then shifted to the bailee to show that he has \r\n  used ordinary care in the storage and safekeeping of the property. Fleischman, \r\n  Morris &amp; Co. v. Southern Railway, 76 S.C. 237, 56 S.E. 974, 9 L.R.A.,N.S., \r\n  519; Marlow v. Conway Iron Works, 130 S.C. 256, 125 S.E. 569; Gilland \r\n  v. Peter's Dry Cleaning Co., supra, 195 S.C. 417, 11 S.E.2d 857; \r\n  Albergotti v. Dixie Produce Co., Inc., 202 S.C. 357, 25 S.E.2d 156; Kelley \r\n  v. Capital Motors, Inc., supra, 204 S.C. 304, 28 S.E.2d 836; Arkwright \r\n  Mills v. Clearwater Mfg. Co., 217 S.C. 530, 61 S.E.2d 165. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nShoreland Freezers, \r\n  241 S.C. at 540-41, 129 S.E.2d at 425-26. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nThe burden of proof in this \r\n  case rests first upon the bailor, Hadfield, to prove a prima facie \r\n  case. He must show: 1) the goods were delivered to the bailee in good condition; \r\n  and 2) they were lost or returned in a damaged condition. See Shoreland \r\n  Freezers, Inc. v. Textile Ice &amp; Fuel Co., 241 S.C. 537, 129 S.E.2d 424 \r\n  (1963). See also Fortner v. Carnes, 258 S.C. 455, 189 S.E.2d 24 \r\n  (1972)(burden is upon bailee to prove due or ordinary care on his part, to jury's \r\n  satisfaction, if he is to relieve himself of liability for goods not returned \r\n  in accordance with bailment contract; whether bailee has exercised due care \r\n  with regard to stored goods has to be determined with reference to all circumstances \r\n  of particular case). When the bailor, Hadfield, has so proven, the burden is \r\n  then shifted to the bailee, Gilchrist, to show that he has used ordinary care \r\n  in the good's storage and safekeeping. See Shoreland, supra; \r\n  Marlow v. Conway Iron Works, 130 S.C. 256, 125 S.E. 569 (1924). \r\n  \r\n   \r\nAs the Court explained in \r\n  Arkwright Mills v. Clearwater Mfg. Co., 217 S.C. 530, 61 S.E.2d 165 (1950): \r\n  \r\n   \r\n In one of our most recent \r\n  cases on this subject, the rule as to what constitutes a prima facie case is \r\n  thus stated: \"From a study of the decided cases in this State, it would appear \r\n  that our Court has recognized that certain presumptions may arise in bailment \r\n  cases, especially as to warehousemen, which overlap and shadow the oft repeated \r\n  statement found in negligence cases, that the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur \r\n  does not prevail in this State. In other words, in warehouse bailments, when \r\n  the bailor shows that the bailee has not returned the property, the subject \r\n  of the bailment, or that the property has been lost by theft or fire, or that \r\n  it has been returned in a damaged condition, such bailor has made out a prima \r\n  facie case, and the duty is then shifted to the bailee to show that he has used \r\n  ordinary care in the storage and safekeeping of the property. From these facts, \r\n  coupled with any testimony on the subject the bailor may introduce, it is for \r\n  the jury to say whether the bailee has been negligent, that is failed to use \r\n  ordinary care. Of course if upon all the testimony in the case the only reasonable \r\n  inference that can be drawn there from is that the bailee used due care, it \r\n  would then be the duty of the trial Judge to direct a verdict in the bailee's \r\n  favor.\" Albergotti v. Dixie Produce Co., 202 S.C. 357, 25 S.E.2d 156, \r\n  158. The case of Fleischman, Morris &amp; Co. v. Southern Railway Co., \r\n  76 S.C. 237, 56 S.E. 974, 9 L.R.A.,N.S., 519, announces the same doctrine. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nArkwright Mills, \r\n  217 S.C. at 536-37, 61 S.E.2d at 167. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nHadfield testified before \r\n  the magistrate regarding the \"nice\" condition of the vehicle prior to being \r\n  towed, and the damage to his vehicle, and the other vehicles on the lot. In \r\n  addition, he introduced photographs depicting the damage. Thus, Hadfield made \r\n  out his prima facie case as required under Fortner v. Carnes, \r\n  258 S.C. 455, 189 S.E.2d 24 (1972). The burden then shifted to Gilchrist to \r\n  show that he used ordinary care in protecting the vehicle while in his care.\r\n \r\nGilchrist impounded the \r\n  cars in a storage lot surrounded by a chain link fence. There was an individual \r\n  on the clock at all times. The person on duty spent time in the office and only \r\n  visited the storage lot to check on it. The vandal cut a hole in the fence and \r\n  broke into six to eight cars on the night in question. The fact the guard was \r\n  not on duty at the impound lot and, considering the only other security for \r\n  the vehicles was the chain link fence, the magistrate and Circuit Court judge \r\n  could have concluded Gilchrist failed to exercise ordinary care. As explicated \r\n  above, the decision of whether or not Gilchrist used ordinary care is a question \r\n  of fact. Based on our standard of review, we must affirm the decision of the \r\n  Circuit Court on the facts if it is supported by any evidence, and this Court \r\n  finds no error of law. See Wright v. Ritz Theatre Co., 211 S.C. \r\n  161, 44 S.E.2d 308 (1947); Dingle v. Northwestern R.R., 112 S.C. 390, \r\n  99 S.E. 828 (1919). We find the facts support the finding that Gilchrist breached \r\n  his duty as a bailee to Hadfield, and the Circuit Court was not controlled by \r\n  any error of law. \r\n   \r\nIV. DAMAGES \r\n   \r\nGilchrist asserts the magistrate \r\n  and the Circuit Court judge erred in the finding of damages. Yet, Gilchrist's \r\n  own counsel stated: \"And all they have proved is damages. There's no question \r\n  that the plaintiffs were damaged . . . .\" Hadfield proffered the testimony of \r\n  Rodney Smitz, an assistant manager at Rick Hendrick Collision Center, to explain \r\n  the damages and the cost to repair the vehicle. Gilchrist's counsel did not \r\n  cross examine Smitz regarding the estimates. We find no merit in Gilchrist's \r\n  argument that there was no evidence for the Circuit Court to calculate damages. \r\n  \r\n   \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n  \r\n   \r\nWe rule that where a city \r\n  ordinance is utilized as the legal justification for taking possession of a \r\n  vehicle on private property the person or entity lawfully acquiring possession \r\n  of the property under the ordinance becomes a constructive bailee \r\n  as a matter of law. We find a constructive bailment, for the mutual benefit \r\n  of Hadfield and Gilchrist, was created. Further, we hold an action for breach \r\n  of the duty of care by a bailor, although contractual in nature, sounds in tort. \r\n  We conclude the burden of proof in a constructive bailment case rests first \r\n  upon a bailor to prove a prima facie case and, once so proven, the \r\n  burden shifts to the bailee to show the use of ordinary care in the storage \r\n  and safekeeping of the property. Accordingly, the order of the Circuit Court \r\n  is \r\n   \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\n  \r\n    \r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n1. The \r\n  magistrate found Hadfield's wife parked the vehicle there earlier that day. \r\n  Gilchrist presented evidence the vehicle was parked there for several days. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3247","title":"State v.

Mansfield appeals from his convictions for attempted first degree burglary and unlawfully\r\n\r\ncarrying a pistol.  He argues the trial court erred in (1) denying his motion for a continuance; (2) allowing the State's\r\n\r\nprimary witness to identify him; (3) excluding evidence showing another person committed the crime; and (4) refusing to\r\n\r\nallow the withdrawal of his guilty plea on the weapons charge.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of September 2, 1997, Keith Diamond walked outside his house on Truman Street in Columbia.  Diamond\r\n\r\nlooked over at the home of his neighbor, Bernard James.  He saw a man bending down on James' porch near the front door. \r\n\r\nDiamond initially thought the man was James because he could only see him from behind.  However, as Diamond walked\r\n\r\ntowards the fence between their yards, the man stood up and Diamond realized he was not James because he was much too\r\n\r\nshort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe man was bending and pulling on James' locked screen door.  Once the man opened it, he kicked the front door. \r\n\r\nDiamond yelled at the man to stop what he was doing and \"looked him dead in the face,\" but the man did not respond.  As\r\n\r\nDiamond approached him, the perpetrator walked away from James' home.  Diamond continued to talk to the man.  He did\r\n\r\nnot get too close because the man had his hand under his shirt and Diamond feared he might be armed.  James' burglar alarm\r\n\r\nsounded.  Diamond watched the man walk down the street and noted where the man was headed.  He then called 911.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his call to 911, Diamond reported the attempted burglary and described the culprit.(1) He stated the individual was a light-skinned black male, between 5'5\" and 5'6\" tall, wearing a red jersey, tennis shoes, and short white pants.  He said the man's\r\n\r\nhair was in plaits.  Diamond informed the operator the man was walking toward the Bethel Bishop Apartment Complex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the police arrived at James' residence, they discovered \"fresh damage\" to the wooden front door.  They found the\r\n\r\nlatch from the screen door on a step leading to the porch and a shoe print on the porch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Officer Duren Lee Doughtery, one of the officers dispatched to the Bethel Bishop Apartment Complex, spotted\r\n\r\nMansfield walking between apartment buildings.  Mansfield was the only man Officer Doughtery saw who matched the\r\n\r\ndescription of the suspect.  The officer stopped Mansfield and told him the police were investigating a problem on Truman\r\n\r\nStreet.  Mansfield said he had just come from that area but that he had done nothing wrong.  After the officers notified him\r\n\r\nthat he was under investigative detention, Mansfield ran.  The officers found him a few minutes later hiding in a storage\r\n\r\ncloset.  He was wearing a red jersey, grey sweat pants(2) pulled up to his knees, and Timberland boots.  He had an afro\r\n\r\nhairstyle.  While booking Mansfield, officers recorded his height at 5'7\".  At that time, Mansfield provided the officers with a\r\n\r\nfalse name and two different addresses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOfficers transported Mansfield to the police substation where Diamond identified him as the man who attempted to break\r\n\r\ninto James' house.  Mansfield \"made a voluntary statement that . . . [Diamond] had seen him cutting grass on Truman Street\r\n\r\nwhen he was walking on Truman Street, crossing the railroad tracks.\"  When an investigator confronted Mansfield with the\r\n\r\nevidence against him, he broke down crying, became despondent, and asked \"Why do you need a confession with all the\r\n\r\nevidence that you have?\"  Police later discovered that the shoe print found on James' porch was consistent with the boots\r\n\r\nMansfield was wearing at the time of his arrest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield was charged with attempted burglary in the first degree and unlawful carrying of a pistol.  His first trial, which was\r\n\r\nApril 1-3, 1998, ended in a mistrial.  Thereafter, on April 13, Mansfield's attempted burglary charge was again called for\r\n\r\ntrial.  At the beginning of the second trial, defense counsel moved for a two week continuance to obtain audiotapes of the\r\n\r\nearlier trial.  The court denied the request.  Defense counsel unsuccessfully attempted to (1) prevent Diamond from\r\n\r\nidentifying Mansfield in court and (2) admit evidence that someone else committed the crime. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury convicted Mansfield of attempted burglary in the first degree.  After the verdict, Mansfield pled guilty to unlawful\r\n\r\ncarrying of a pistol.  Defense counsel then attempted to withdraw the plea because he was confused and concerned about a\r\n\r\nnew sentencing form he was required to sign.  The court denied counsel's request, but agreed to pass sentence without the\r\n\r\nnew form.  The court sentenced Mansfield to one year on the weapons charge and thirty-five years on the attempted\r\n\r\nburglary.(3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.   Did the trial court err in denying Mansfield's motion for a continuance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.   Did the trial court err in allowing Diamond to identify Mansfield as the perpetrator?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.   Did the trial court err in excluding evidence that another person committed the crime?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.   Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Mansfield to withdraw his guilty plea?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Continuance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield argues the trial court erred in denying his motion for a continuance.  Mansfield maintains he needed a continuance\r\n\r\nto obtain a trial transcript, which he could have used to impeach Diamond regarding the out-of-court identification.(4)  He\r\n\r\ncontends Diamond's testimony regarding the events surrounding that identification varied dramatically between the first and\r\n\r\nsecond trial and the transcript would have enabled him to prove the identification was the unreliable product of an unduly\r\n\r\nsuggestive identification procedure.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe granting or denial of a motion for continuance is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.  State v. Tanner,\r\n299\r\n\r\nS.C. 459, 385 S.E.2d 832 (1989); State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 385 S.E.2d 827 (1989).  The trial court's\r\n\r\nrefusal of a motion for continuance will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion resulting in\r\n\r\nprejudice to the appellant.  State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 455, 469 S.E.2d 49 (1996);\r\nState v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451,\r\n\r\n385 S.E.2d 827 (1989).  See also Skeen v. State, 325 S.C. 210, 481 S.E.2d 129 (1997)(denial of motion for continuance\r\n\r\nrests within trial court's sound discretion and will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion resulting in prejudice\r\n\r\nto appellant).  Reversals of the refusal of a continuance are about as \"rare as the proverbial hens' teeth.\"  State v. Lytchfield,\r\n\r\n230 S.C. 405, 409, 95 S.E.2d 857, 859 (1957).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, we reject the argument that Diamond's testimony regarding the events leading up to his identification of Mansfield\r\n\r\nvaried to such an extent from the first to the second trial to afford him a basis for effective impeachment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the first trial, Diamond gave the following in camera testimony about the show-up identification:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  --So I'm assuming then that there was a time when Investigator O'Neill took you someplace to identify a suspect; is that\r\n\r\ncorrect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Well, after I gave him the--everything I know, what happened, then that's when he asked did I want to go see the guy. \r\n\r\nHe said, \"We've got him there.\"  I said, \"Yes, sir.  I'd like to see him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  . . . When investigator J. J. O'Neill took you someplace, where did he take you?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  He took me to the city police--little substation off of West Beltline.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  And how much time had occurred from when you very first saw the suspect to where investigator J. J. O'Neill\r\n\r\ntook you to look at him later, approximately how much time?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Let's see.  About maybe anywhere from about--Let's say around 15 or 20 minutes, something like that.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  15 or 20 minutes from when you very first saw him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Let me see.  Wait a minute.  I'm wrong.  I don't--really, I don't exactly remember how much time was it [sic], to tell you\r\n\r\nthe truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Was it more than an hour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No.  It was less than an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  It was less than an hour?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Right.  It was less than an hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  And Investigator J. J. took you to the precinct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  And did he tell you--What did he tell you about what you were getting ready to do?  Did he tell you he was getting ready\r\n\r\nto let you look at somebody and ask you if that was the person-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  He said--no.  He said, \"I want you to Identify\"--He said, \"We have a suspect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  All right.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  \"We have picked up a suspect.  I want you to identify him and make sure that's him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Did he suggest to you that they definitely had the man who did it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Well, he said we have--the only thing he said, he said, \"We have a suspect.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  \"And we want you to take a look at him.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  That's exactly what he said.  Those were his words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  So when you went to the precinct, did this defendant come out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Yeah, that's him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  And you have no question that this man came out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No doubt in my mind.  That's him right there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Is this the same man that you saw on the porch?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  That's the same guy I seen on Mr. James' porch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the Neil v. Biggers(5) hearing on retrial, Diamond testified concerning the events which occurred immediately prior to\r\n\r\nthe show-up:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  And when the police took you to see him-I believe that was Investigator J. J. O'Neill; is that correct?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Did he tell you, We caught your man?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No. They say they got a suspect and they want me to take a look at him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Did he tell you what he would be wearing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No, he did not.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the trial court determined his identification of Mansfield was reliable, Diamond gave the following testimony before the\r\n\r\njury relating to the show-up:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  When ya'll got to the substation, what happened?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Well, they had-they brought us the guy out and before Officer O'Neill stopped his car, I had done pointed him out then,\r\n\r\nthat is him, before he said anything to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Did he tell you there's a man in the parking lot we want you to see?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No, he called ahead and he told-well, when we was on the way to the substation, he called and told them to bring the\r\n\r\nguy out.  I'm bringing the witness who seen him here.  So they brought him out, and before he said anything else to me, I\r\n\r\nhad done pointed him out before he even stopped the car good, that is him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  What was that man wearing?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  The guy they brought out?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Yes, sir?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  The same clothes you just showed me, the red shirt and the white shorts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Are those the same clothes you saw initially?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  The same clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Was that man by himself or with other people when you saw him at the substation?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  I think two or three officers were with him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Officers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Yeah.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Were they standing around him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Were there any other people who were not officers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Which I wasn't paying no attention, I didn't see no one else.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  You were looking at the suspect?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  I was looking exactly at him, yes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Did you ask Investigator O'Neill for a better look of him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No, I did not.  I asked Officer O'Neill, Can I get out to touch him.  I need to just touch him once.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Why did you want to touch him?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Well, it made me so angry to see someone breaking in another person's house, you know, which I ain't never seen that\r\n\r\nhappen before, not in the neighborhood I stay in.  Which it probably have, but I didn't know nothing about it.  And I wanted\r\n\r\nto just get out and touch him, not to be sure that that was him, because I know all the time in my mind that was him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Okay.  Did you know that man prior to this incident?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  The guy that did it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQ.  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  No, I do not know him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield claims \"Diamond's version of events leading up to his identification  . . . varied dramatically between the first and\r\n\r\nsecond trial.\"  He asserts Diamond testified in the first trial that Investigator O'Neill stated:  \"[W]e've got him there. . . . I\r\n\r\nwant you to identify him and make sure that's him\"; where as, in the second trial, \"[i]nstead of admitting that Officer O'Neill\r\n\r\ntold him they had the perpetrator,\" Diamond testified he was told he was being brought to identify a suspect.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Diamond initially testified in the first trial the investigator said police wanted Diamond to identify \"him,\" he later\r\n\r\nclearly states the officer did not indicate they had caught the perpetrator but that they had a \"suspect\" for Diamond to\r\n\r\nidentify positively or negatively.  Diamond testified distinctly and firmly on this point during both the first and second trials. \r\n\r\nAlthough there are variances between Diamond's testimony in the first and second trials, these minor differences add to,\r\n\r\nrather than detract from, his credibility as a witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Asbury, 328 S.C. 187, 493 S.E.2d 349 (1997), the defendant requested a continuance when a case which\r\n\r\noriginally ended in a mistrial was called for retrial and the transcript was not yet available.  Asbury argued the transcript was\r\n\r\nnecessary for the effective impeachment of witnesses.  The trial court denied the motion, concluding the transcript would\r\n\r\nhave been beneficial, but was not essential.  Our Supreme Court affirmed the trial court's ruling, finding Asbury failed to\r\n\r\nestablish prejudice from the lack of access to the transcript from the first trial.  The Court noted the court reporter's back-up\r\n\r\ntapes were available and could have been used for impeachment purposes as needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, as in Asbury, there was not enough time between Mansfield's mistrial and retrial for the preparation of a transcript. \r\n\r\nUnlike the Asbury case, Mansfield's attorney requested a copy of the court reporter's tapes by letter.  However, in the letter,\r\n\r\nwritten a week before trial, defense counsel asked the court reporter to forward the tapes within two weeks even though the\r\n\r\nretrial was scheduled to commence only ten days after the mistrial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield did not need a continuance to achieve his stated objective.  He could have served the court reporter with a\r\n\r\nsubpoena to appear in court and a subpoena duces tecum to bring the tapes with her.  This would have provided Mansfield\r\n\r\nwith the benefit of access to Diamond's prior testimony, which is precisely what he sought with his motion for a\r\n\r\ncontinuance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Mansfield's motion for a continuance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Identification\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield complains the trial court erred in allowing Diamond to identify him as the person who attempted to enter James'\r\n\r\nhome.  He avers Diamond's identification was the unreliable product of an unduly suggestive show-up procedure.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe admissibility of evidence is within the sound discretion of the trial judge.  State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n845 (Ct. App. 1999).  Accordingly, evidentiary rulings of the trial court will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion or the commission of legal error which results in prejudice to the defendant.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA criminal defendant may be deprived of due process of law by an identification procedure that is unnecessarily\r\n\r\nsuggestive and conducive to irreparable mistaken identification. Stovall v. Denno, 388 U.S. 293, 87 S.Ct. 1967, 18\r\n\r\nL.Ed.2d 1199 (1967); Patterson,  supra.  Identifications resulting from single person show-ups have been upheld by the\r\n\r\nUnited States Supreme Court and our Supreme Court.  \"While a showup in which a witness views a single suspect is\r\n\r\ngenerally suggestive, and hence suspect or disfavored, and less preferable than a lineup, even if requested by accused, a\r\n\r\nshowup may be proper in some circumstances.\"  22A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 803 (1989)(footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"[A] showup may be proper where it occurs shortly after the alleged crime, near the scene of the crime, as the witness'\r\n\r\nmemory is still fresh, and the suspect has not had time to alter his looks or dispose of evidence, and the showup may\r\n\r\nexpedite the release of innocent suspects, and enable the police to determine whether to continue searching.\"  22A C.J.S.\r\n\r\nCriminal Law Â§ 803 (footnotes omitted).  \"The closer in time and place to the scene of the crime, the less objectionable is a\r\n\r\nshowup.\"  Id.  \"A showup may be proper even though the police refer to the suspect as a suspect, and even though the\r\n\r\nsuspect is handcuffed or is in the presence of the police . . . .\"  Id. (footnotes omitted).  \"While show-ups have been upheld\r\n\r\nby the Court, these situations usually involve either extenuating circumstances or are very close in time to the crime.\"  State\r\n\r\nv. Hoyte, 306 S.C. 561, 562-63, 413 S.E.2d 806, 807 (1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSingle person show-ups are disfavored because they are suggestive by their nature.  State v. Blassingame, 338 S.C. 240, 525\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 535 (Ct. App. 1999).  However, an identification may be reliable under the totality of the circumstances even when a\r\n\r\nsuggestive procedure has been used.  See Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972); Blassingame,\r\n\r\nsupra.  Suggestiveness alone does not mandate the exclusion of evidence.  State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628\r\n\r\n(1980); State v. Patterson, 337 S.C. 215, 522 S.E.2d 845 (Ct. App. 1999). Reliability is the linchpin in determining the\r\n\r\nadmissibility of identification testimony.  Manson v. Brathwaite, 432 U.S. 98, 97 S.Ct. 2243, 53 L.Ed.2d 140 (1977);\r\n\r\nBlassingame, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an identification is reliable, it is necessary to consider the factors set forth in Neil v. Biggers: 1) the\r\n\r\nopportunity of the witness to view the criminal at the time of the crime; 2) the witness's degree of attention; 3) the accuracy\r\n\r\nof the witness's prior description of the criminal; 4) the level of certainty demonstrated by the witness at the confrontation;\r\n\r\nand 5) the amount of time between the crime and the confrontation.  See Neil, supra; Stewart, supra; Blassingame, supra. \r\n\r\nThe corrupting effect of a suggestive identification is to be weighed against these factors.  Patterson, supra.  After the trial\r\n\r\ncourt determines the witness's identification is reliable, the witness is permitted to testify before the jury.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the suggestive nature of the identification procedure employed by police in this case, Diamond's\r\n\r\nidentification of Mansfield was reliable in light of the totality of the circumstances.  Diamond had a protracted opportunity to\r\n\r\nlook at the man he witnessed trying to break into his neighbor's home.  Diamond consciously observed the man.  When he\r\n\r\nnoticed the man stooping on the porch, Diamond first thought it was his neighbor.  He realized this was not the case when\r\n\r\nthe man stood up and Diamond saw the man was shorter than James.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiamond yelled at the man and once \"looked him dead in the face.\"  He \"[g]ot a good look at him\" and \"kept [his] eyes on\r\n\r\n[Mansfield] all the way.\"  There were no distractions or visual obstructions which kept him from seeing the man. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the attempted burglary occurred in the middle of the afternoon, when lighting was more than adequate. \r\n\r\nDiamond watched with bewilderment as the man did not respond, but simply walked off of the porch and down the street. \r\n\r\nHe followed the man far enough to see him turn onto a different street and head toward an apartment complex across some\r\n\r\nrailroad tracks.  Diamond's attention was heightened as a result of the man's behavior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe description Diamond gave to the officers matched, almost completely, Mansfield's appearance upon arrest.  He\r\n\r\ndescribed a man of Mansfield's race, height, and skin tone, who wore a shirt the same color as Mansfield's.  Diamond stated\r\n\r\nthe man wore white, short pants.  When arrested, Mansfield was wearing grey sweat pants pushed up to his knees.  Although\r\n\r\nDiamond described the perpetrator as having plaits in his hair and wearing tennis shoes while Mansfield had an afro and\r\n\r\nwore boots, his description on the whole was accurate.  Diamond explained Mansfield's hair looked like it had plaits in it\r\n\r\nbecause it was \"packed down\" rather than combed out.  As for Mansfield's shoes, Diamond stated he did not pay much\r\n\r\nattention to the man's shoes because he was focusing on his clothes and face.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Diamond immediately and positively identified Mansfield upon being driven into the parking lot of the police\r\n\r\nsubstation.  When asked how certain Diamond appeared to be when he identified Mansfield, Investigator O'Neill declared:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely no doubt in his mind.  As soon as we pulled in the parking lot and I pulled up to Mr. Mansfield, he\r\n\r\npointed to him.  He said, That's the man who did it, and he pointed.  There wasn't any doubt whatsoever.  It didn't take him\r\n\r\nanytime whatsoever to identify him.  He was absolutely positive.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInvestigator O'Neill recalled asking Diamond whether he was absolutely positive to which Diamond responded,\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly, that's him.\"  Diamond estimated he identified Mansfield less than an hour after first seeing him.  Critically,\r\n\r\nthere was only a brief time between the crime and the identification.  See State v. Hoyte, 306 S.C. 561, 413 S.E.2d 806\r\n\r\n(1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold Diamond's pre-trial identification of Mansfield was reliable under the totality of the circumstances.  The\r\n\r\nidentification satisfies the criteria of State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980), and Neil v. Biggers, 409 U.S.\r\n\r\n188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).  The trial court properly denied Mansfield's motion to suppress Diamond's pre-trial identification of him.  Additionally, the judge did not err in allowing the in-court identification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  Exclusion of Evidence Regarding Guan Perry\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield argues the trial court erred in not allowing him to admit evidence Guan Perry committed the attempted burglary. \r\n\r\nWe disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile searching for the man Diamond described in his call to 911, one of the officers mentioned a man named Guan.(6) \r\n\r\nDefense counsel repeatedly asked officers on cross-examination whether they had investigated any suspect named Guan,\r\n\r\nincluding asking the fingerprint expert whether he had compared the fingerprints found on James' door to Guan Perry's\r\n\r\nfingerprints.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of the State's case, the defense requested permission to introduce a photograph and testimony that Perry, the\r\n\r\nman in the photograph, lived in the apartment complex where Mansfield was found and was there on the day of the\r\n\r\nattempted burglary.  Mansfield proffered testimony of a private investigator that Perry lived in building 21-F of the Bethel\r\n\r\nBishop apartments, that he is approximately 5'7\" or 5'8\", has a medium build, and light black skin.  The investigator testified\r\n\r\nhe talked with Perry.  According to the investigator, Perry was at the apartment complex on September 2 and wore his hair\r\n\r\nin plaits during that month.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has imposed strict limitations on the admissibility of third-party guilt.  State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540,\r\n\r\n514 S.E.2d 584 (1999).  Evidence offered by a defendant as to the commission of the crime by another person is limited to\r\n\r\nfacts which are inconsistent with the defendant's guilt.  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999).  The\r\n\r\nevidence must raise a reasonable inference as to the accused's innocence.  State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n862 (1994), overruled on other grounds by State v. Chapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d 532 (1941), the defendant, a former officer of the Spartanburg Water Works\r\n\r\ndepartment, appealed his conviction for embezzling funds from miscellaneous Water Works accounts.  The trial court limited\r\n\r\nevidence of shortages and a cover-up involving a hospital's water account because that account was unconnected to the\r\n\r\ncharges against defendant.  The Supreme Court rejected Gregory's argument that the testimony concerning the hospital's\r\n\r\naccount tended to prove another person committed the embezzlement of which he was accused.  The Court articulated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he evidence offered by accused as to the commission of the crime by another person must be limited to such facts as are\r\n\r\ninconsistent with his own guilt, and to such facts as raise a reasonable inference or presumption as to his own innocence;\r\n\r\nevidence which can have (no) other effect than to cast a bare suspicion upon another, or to raise a conjectural inference as to\r\n\r\nthe commission of the crime by another, is not admissible. . . . But before such testimony can be received, there must be such\r\n\r\nproof of connection with it, such a train of facts or circumstances, as tends clearly to point out such other person as the\r\n\r\nguilty party.  Remote acts, disconnected and outside the crime itself, cannot be separately proved for such a purpose.  An\r\n\r\norderly and unbiased judicial inquiry as to the guilt or innocence of a defendant on trial does not contemplate that such\r\n\r\ndefendant be permitted, by way of defense, to indulge in conjectural inferences that some other person might have committed\r\n\r\nthe offense for which he is on trial, or by fanciful analogy to say to the jury that someone other than he is more probably\r\n\r\nguilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGregory, 198 S.C. at 104-05, 16 S.E.2d at 534-35 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Gregory, the Supreme Court decided State v. Parker, 294 S.C. 465, 366 S.E.2d 10 (1988).  Parker was convicted of\r\n\r\nmurder and armed robbery.  The victim was found dead at about 5:00 a.m. on a Saturday morning.  He was tied to a fence. \r\n\r\nSeveral days later, an eyewitness reported to police that he had seen a white male bleeding against the fence where victim\r\n\r\nwas found at approximately 4:15-4:25 a.m.  The witness saw a second man there.  He asked that man whether he knew\r\n\r\nwhere a party was and whether he had any marijuana.  When the man answered negatively, the witness returned to his car\r\n\r\nand drove away.  The witness gave a detailed description of the second man to police.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Parker sought to prove Rodney Fyall, the man who found the victim and reported the incident to the police, was the\r\n\r\nguilty party.  After permitting a proffer of testimony, the trial judge denied Parker access to Fyall's psychiatric records. \r\n\r\nFurther, the judge refused to allow Parker to query Fyall in regard to his boxer training, any aggressive or violent behavior\r\n\r\ntraits, or whether he was questioned on the morning of the murder by an occupant of a car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court ruled:  \"[T]he evidence proffered by [Parker] was not inconsistent with his guilt.  The trial judge exercised sound\r\n\r\ndiscretion in excluding it.\"  Parker, 294 S.C. at 467, 366 S.E.2d at 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendant in State v. Southerland, 316 S.C. 377, 447 S.E.2d 862 (1994), overruled on other grounds by State v.\r\n\r\nChapman, 317 S.C. 302, 454 S.E.2d 317 (1995), was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and other crimes related to the\r\n\r\nviolent killing, dismemberment, and burning of a woman.  At trial, Southerland attempted to introduce evidence the victim\r\n\r\nwas involved in a conspiracy to smuggle drugs into prison.  He argued this evidence would have shown the victim's co-conspirators had a motive to murder her and, in turn, decreased the plausibility of his own guilt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn affirming the trial court's exclusion of the proposed evidence, the Supreme Court enunciated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evidence of [Victim's] involvement in a conspiracy to smuggle drugs into prison did not suggest any connection\r\n\r\nbetween the smuggling and [Victim's] death.  At best, this evidence established that someone else may have had a motive to\r\n\r\nkill [Victim].  Motive is not a requirement of the State's case.  Therefore, any evidence indicating that others had a reason to\r\n\r\nkill [Victim] would not exculpate Southerland.  Evidence of the conspiracy to smuggle drugs into prison concerned only a\r\n\r\nremote act disconnected with the murder.  We find that the trial judge exercised sound discretion in excluding this evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSoutherland, 316 S.C. at 383-84, 447 S.E.2d at 866-67.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996), discusses the admissibility of third party guilt.  Williams was\r\n\r\nconvicted of murdering his wife and twelve-year-old adopted son.  The victims were found inside the family van about six\r\n\r\nmiles from their home.  The front bumper of the van was against a tree, and fire had partially damaged the vehicle.  The\r\n\r\nautomobile accident had been staged.  The accident scene and the autopsies revealed the victims were killed prior to the\r\n\r\nengineered car crash.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately one month before the murders, Williams substantially increased life insurance benefits on Wife and Son,\r\n\r\ndesignating himself as beneficiary.  In addition, Williams upgraded existing policies with Allstate Insurance Company to\r\n\r\ninclude auto-related death benefits on both victims, forging his wife's name on the enrollment form. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Williams proffered evidence that there were marijuana manufacturers in the area where the bodies were found who\r\n\r\nhad subsequently threatened the lives of a confidential informant and a narcotics agent.  Williams asserted these men had the\r\n\r\nmotive and opportunity to kill the victims.  The Circuit Court refused to allow this evidence and argument of the theory\r\n\r\nbefore the jury.  On appeal, Williams claimed he had been denied an opportunity to create a reasonable doubt of his guilt. \r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court disagreed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter reviewing the record, we conclude that the evidence offered by Williams failed to establish that the persons arrested for\r\n\r\ngrowing marijuana had any connection whatsoever to the homicides.  Hence, the drug offenses were isolated from the\r\n\r\nhomicides, and evidence pertaining to them should not have been admitted to insinuate that someone other than Williams\r\n\r\ncould have murdered the victims.  Accordingly, because Williams failed to show that the proffered evidence was inconsistent\r\n\r\nwith his guilt, the circuit court exercised sound discretion in excluding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWilliams, 321 S.C. at 335, 468 S.E.2d at 631 (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 513 S.E.2d 606 (1999), the defendant was convicted of murder, kidnapping, and\r\n\r\nconspiracy to commit murder after his wife was found dead in her car in a ditch.  The evidence demonstrated Beckham had\r\n\r\nbeaten his wife unconscious with a gun.  He then asked Richard Anderson, the person he hired to dispose of his wife's body,\r\n\r\nto break her neck.  Beckham instructed Anderson to drive his wife's car off of a mountain road to make her death appear to\r\n\r\nbe an accident.  The victim's car did not roll as planned and ended up in a ditch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeckham attempted to introduce evidence in his trial that there were two men on the mountain road the night of the murder\r\n\r\nand that someone else had been with Anderson.  The trial court's exclusion of this evidence was affirmed on appeal because\r\n\r\nthe evidence Beckham sought to introduce regarding third party guilt would not have served to exculpate him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court, in State v. Cooper, 334 S.C. 540, 514 S.E.2d 584 (1999), addressed the issue regarding admissibility of\r\n\r\nthird-party guilt.  The victim was found dead in his home.  Victim had been cut, stabbed, and slashed over seventy times. \r\n\r\nThe police quickly suspected Cooper, who told officers three completely different stories during the investigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Cooper proffered the testimony of Solomon Nelson who testified that while in a restaurant, he overheard Shirley\r\n\r\nGilmore tell Peter Wayne Marshall that Gilmore, Dottie Suber, and Cooper's girlfriend had murdered Victim.  Marshall\r\n\r\nadmitted having a conversation with Gilmore about the murder but denied that Gilmore told him she killed Victim.  Marshall\r\n\r\nstated Gilmore simply told him that Cooper was not alone in killing Victim.  Finally, Gilmore proffered testimony, denying\r\n\r\nshe told Marshall that she killed Victim.  Gilmore claimed she only told Marshall that she believed Cooper had not\r\n\r\ncommitted the crime.  The trial court excluded the testimony.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Cooper admitted the sole purpose for calling Gilmore was to impeach her with Nelson's testimony, thereby\r\n\r\nsupplying substantive evidence of her guilt in committing the crime.  The Court observed:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[G]ilmore admitted having a conversation with Marshall concerning [Cooper's] case, but denied admitting to the crime. \r\n\r\nAside from Nelson's assertions, there was no credible evidence linking Gilmore to Victim's murder.  Gilmore testified in\r\n\r\ncamera that she had never been to Victim's house.  Thus, there was no evidence that tended clearly to point out that Gilmore\r\n\r\nwas guilty of the crime.  Nelson's testimony would therefore be prohibited under [State v. Gregory, 198 S.C. 98, 16 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n532 (1941)].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCooper, 334 S.C. at 549-50, 514 S.E.2d at 589.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, defense counsel attempted to show that a man named Guan Perry, who matched Diamond's physical\r\n\r\ndescription of the attempted burglar, lived in the apartment complex where Mansfield was found and was home on the day in\r\n\r\nquestion.  This evidence casts a mere \"bare suspicion\" on Perry.  The fact that Perry generally fit the description of the\r\n\r\nperpetrator and lived in the apartment complex does not show his guilt, nor is it inconsistent with Mansfield's guilt.  Because\r\n\r\nthe evidence was not inconsistent with Mansfield's own guilt, the trial court exercised sound discretion in excluding it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  Refusal to Withdraw Guilty Plea\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield maintains the trial court erred in ruling it could not exercise its discretion to allow the withdrawal of his guilty plea\r\n\r\nfor unlawfully carrying a pistol.  We hold the court properly exercised its discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce a defendant enters a plea of guilty, the decision whether to allow withdrawal of the plea is left to the trial court's sound\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  State v. Riddle, 278 S.C. 148, 292 S.E.2d 795 (1982); State v. Barton, 325 S.C. 522, 481 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App.\r\n\r\n1997); State v. Rosier, 312 S.C. 145, 439 S.E.2d 307 (Ct. App. 1993).  The failure to exercise discretion, however, is itself\r\n\r\nan abuse of discretion.  Samples v. Mitchell, 329 S.C. 105, 495 S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App. 1997).  See also Fontaine v. Peitz, 291\r\n\r\nS.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987)(\"When the trial judge is vested with discretion, but his ruling reveals no\r\n\r\ndiscretion was, in fact, exercised, an error of law has occurred.\"); State v. Smith, 276 S.C. 494, 498, 280 S.E.2d 200, 202\r\n\r\n(1981)(\"It is an equal abuse of discretion to refuse to exercise discretionary authority when it is warranted as it is to exercise\r\n\r\nthe discretion improperly.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the jury found Mansfield guilty of attempted burglary in the first degree, he pled guilty to unlawful carrying of a pistol. \r\n\r\nAfter the plea, but prior to sentencing, defense counsel indicated he was uncomfortable with a new sentencing form he was\r\n\r\nrequired to sign.  He was unfamiliar with the form and unwilling to sign it.  As a result, defense counsel moved to withdraw\r\n\r\nMansfield's guilty plea.  The record reflects the following colloquy:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court:  You mean, the plea on the one year?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  On the pistol charge, Your Honor.  We just withdraw that at this time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court:  Well, I don't know how I can let you withdraw it.  I've already accepted it now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Well-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court:  How can I let you withdraw something you've already voluntarily entered into?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  It requires my signature and under these circumstances, I'm just not familiar with this form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court:  Well, I tell you what, don't sign it.  You don't sign it and I'll sentence him without it.  And we'll see what they\r\n\r\ndo with that. The sentence on the pistol charge is one year.  The sentence on the other charge he was just convicted on is 35\r\n\r\nyears.  35 years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]:  Thank you, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMansfield contends the trial court failed to exercise its discretion in refusing to allow the withdrawal of his guilty plea.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.  The court's comment and question concerning the request were merely rhetorical.  The court did not\r\n\r\nmisunderstand the law and thereby fail to exercise its discretion.  Rather, the court, having already found Mansfield's guilty\r\n\r\nplea was voluntary, saw no reason to allow the plea to be withdrawn for the stated reasons.  The court did exercise its\r\n\r\ndiscretion in refusing the request and fashioned a remedy to counsel's concerns, which Mansfield did not object to at trial or\r\n\r\non appeal.  We find no abuse of discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court did not err in denying Mansfield's motion for a continuance.  Further, we hold the court\r\n\r\nproperly denied Mansfield's motion to suppress Diamond's pre-trial identification of him.  Additionally, the judge\r\n\r\ndid not err in allowing the in-court identification.  Moreover, the court correctly excluded the proffered evidence\r\n\r\nconcerning Guan Perry because it cast only a \"bare suspicion\" upon him and was not inconsistent with Mansfield's\r\n\r\nguilt.  Finally, the trial court properly exercised its discretion in refusing to grant Mansfield's request to withdraw\r\n\r\nthe guilty plea.  Accordingly, Mansfield's convictions for attempted burglary in the first degree and unlawful\r\n\r\ncarrying of a pistol are\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. A 911 operator also received a call on James' burglar alarm.\r\n\r\n2. Mansfield's sweat pants apparently were light grey in color.  On the tape containing Diamond's 911 call and\r\n\r\npolice conversations during the search, one of the officers spotted Mansfield and described his pants as white sweat\r\n\r\npants pulled up to his knees.  The same officer later referred to the pants as whitish-grey.  The officer who\r\n\r\ndiscovered Mansfield hiding in the storage closet referred to his pants as white in color.  Diamond testified the\r\n\r\npants looked white to him in the broad daylight.  During her closing argument, the Assistant Solicitor referred to\r\n\r\nthe sweat pants as \"kind of grey\" and argued they could be mistaken for white \"in the September sun.\"\r\n\r\n3.  According to the briefs, the trial court later reduced the attempted burglary sentence to thirty years.\r\n\r\n4.  At trial, Mansfield alleged he needed a two week continuance to obtain the court reporter's tapes from the first trial.\r\n\r\n5.  409 U.S. 188, 93 S.Ct. 375, 34 L.Ed.2d 401 (1972).\r\n\r\n6.  Just before Mansfield was found hiding in a storage closet, one of the police officers asked the  other officers whether any\r\n\r\nof them knew a person named Guan who matched the description of the suspect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3248","title":"Rogers v.

Following the trial of this case, the jury returned a verdict of  $3,000,000, apportioning thirty\r\n\r\npercent to Norfolk and seventy percent to U.S. Silica. On appeal, Norfolk argues: 1) Rogers should not recover under the\r\n\r\nFELA because Norfolk was not negligent; 2) Rogers's negligence was the sole cause of his injuries; 3) the verdict was\r\n\r\nexcessive; 4) the court erred in omitting a jury charge regarding the taxability of the award; and 5) the court erred in holding\r\n\r\npost-trial that the jury's apportionment of damages was not binding on the parties.  We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers, an assistant track supervisor for Norfolk, was injured while inspecting  a hole that appeared around two sets of\r\n\r\nrailroad sidetracks on U.S. Silica's premises. Generally, Rogers's duties were to inspect Norfolk's tracks in his assigned\r\n\r\nwork area, appraise any problems or damage found, and advise his supervisors of necessary repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the day Rogers was injured, his supervisor sent him to inspect a large hole under the tracks on U.S. Silica's premises to\r\n\r\nsee whether the tracks were safe to traverse.  A Norfolk train engineer and conductor discovered the hole upon their return\r\n\r\nfrom a lunch break.  The hole was approximately four to five feet deep, over eight feet across, with steep sides, and\r\n\r\nsomewhat curved in on one side so as to cause the ground above to be undermined.  The train engineer and conductor also\r\n\r\nreported the hole to at least two U.S. Silica employees who made no comment or explanation concerning the cause of the\r\n\r\nhole or any prior problems in the area.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days earlier, the underground slurry pipe that ran below the railroad tracks blew out.(2)  When the blowout occurred,\r\n\r\nU.S. Silica employees bolted a temporary band over the pipe and filled in the hole caused by the blowout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Rogers arrived to inspect the hole, he could see the hole from about 150 feet away.  He testified that he had no idea\r\n\r\nwhat could have caused the hole when he first observed it.  Rogers could not see that some of the ground near the hole was\r\n\r\nundermined because of the manner in which it was undermined and the direction from which he approached the hole. \r\n\r\nRogers told his assistant to \"stand back\" as he went to inspect the hole.  Walking on the steel rails and track structure,\r\n\r\nRogers stood within two to three feet from the hole.  As Rogers attempted to look into the hole, the ground began to give\r\n\r\nway under his right foot.  When he felt the ground giving way, Rogers jerked back from the hole to catch himself, twisted,\r\n\r\nand immediately felt pain in his back.  Rogers reported the accident to his supervisor and went home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon seeking medical treatment for back and left leg pain stemming from the incident, Rogers was diagnosed with a\r\n\r\nherniated disc.  Surgery was performed to remove the ruptured disc, but the surgery did not relieve Rogers's leg pain. \r\n\r\nRogers attempted to return to work after the surgery, but Norfolk would not permit him to do so.  At the time of trial,\r\n\r\nRogers had held five different  jobs, none of which offered benefits and salary comparable to what he received at Norfolk.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers's prognosis was described by Dr. John Eugene Alexander, an orthopedist, as poor.  Although Rogers had sustained\r\n\r\nback injuries before this incident(3), he had been able to return to work with restrictions.  Rogers was working well within\r\n\r\nthose restrictions without difficulty until this incident occurred.  Because of this injury, Rogers has work restrictions on\r\n\r\nlifting, bending, and stooping, as well as an additional twenty percent impairment to his lumbar spine.(4)  Dr. Alexander\r\n\r\nopined that Rogers will never be able to do the type of work he did in the past or to resume his previous recreational\r\n\r\nactivities, and that his condition will  progressively worsen with time.  At the time of trial, Rogers suffered from depression\r\n\r\nand had problems sleeping because of constant pain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of his accident and injuries, Rogers filed suit against Norfolk under the FELA, alleging Norfolk was negligent in\r\n\r\nfailing to provide him with a reasonably safe place to work.  Rogers also brought suit against U.S. Silica for common law\r\n\r\nnegligence, alleging U.S. Silica had negligently failed to maintain its facility, grounds, and property in a reasonably safe and\r\n\r\nsuitable condition for business invitees.  Rogers also alleged U.S. Silica negligently failed to warn him of the dangerous and\r\n\r\nhazardous condition of its facility, grounds and property.  U.S. Silica and Norfolk answered with general denials and\r\n\r\nasserted the affirmative defense of Rogers's contributory negligence.  Norfolk also asserted release, stemming from Rogers's\r\n\r\nexecution of a release in 1990 and one in 1995, and failure to mitigate damages as defenses.  Norfolk also alleged an\r\n\r\nindemnity cross-claim against U.S. Silica.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case was heard by a judge and jury in a five-day trial.  At the close of the evidence, both U.S. Silica and Norfolk moved\r\n\r\nfor directed verdicts.  The trial court denied the motions.  The jury returned a verdict for Rogers in the amount of\r\n\r\n$3,000,000 actual damages.  The jury apportioned thirty percent of the verdict to Norfolk ($900,000) and seventy percent to\r\n\r\nU.S. Silica ($2,100,000). The jury found no negligence on Rogers's part.  Following the return of this verdict, U.S. Silica\r\n\r\nand Norfolk moved for judgment notwithstanding the verdict and, alternatively, for a new trial or new trial nisi remittitur. \r\n\r\nThe trial court denied these motions.  Both defendants then moved for reconsideration on various grounds.  Those motions\r\n\r\nwere also denied.  This appeal followed.(5)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an action at law on appeal of a case tried by a jury, the jurisdiction of this Court extends merely to the correction of errors\r\n\r\nof law, and a factual finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record discloses there is no evidence\r\n\r\nwhich reasonably supports the jury's findings. Townes Assocs. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorfolk argues the trial court erred in denying its motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict (JNOV) because no\r\n\r\nissues of fact existed as to whether Norfolk was negligent. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ruling on motions for directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, the trial court is required to view the\r\n\r\nevidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom in the light most favorable to the party opposing the\r\n\r\nmotions.  The trial court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in\r\n\r\ndoubt.  This Court will reverse the trial court only when there is no evidence to support the ruling below.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSteinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the FELA, a railroad \"shall be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by such carrier ...\r\n\r\nfor such injury ... resulting in whole or in part from the negligence of any of the officers, agents, or employees of such\r\n\r\ncarrier.\"  45 U.S.C. Â§ 51.  The FELA requires that liability arise from negligence which causes the employee's injury. Brady\r\n\r\nv. Southern Ry. Co., 320 U.S. 476 (1943).  \"[U]nder the FELA, 'plaintiffs are still required to prove traditional common law\r\n\r\nelements of negligence: duty, breach, foreseeability, and causation.'\" Brown v. CSX Transp., Inc., 18 F.3d 245, 249 (4th Cir.\r\n\r\n1994) (quoting Robert v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 832 F.2d 3, 6 (1st Cir. 1987)); see also Lyles v. Alabama State Docks\r\n\r\nTerminal Ry., 730 So.2d 123, 124 (Ala.1998) (\"To prevail in a FELA action, the plaintiff must prove the traditional\r\n\r\ncommon-law elements of negligence: duty, breach of duty, foreseeability, and causation.\").  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe [history] has been said to reduce the extent of the negligence required, as well as the quantum of proof necessary to\r\n\r\nestablish it, to the \"vanishing point.\"  While it is still undoubtedly true that there must be some shreds of proof both of\r\n\r\nnegligence and of causation, and that \"speculation, conjecture, and possibilities\" will not be enough, there appears to be little\r\n\r\ndoubt that under [FELA] jury verdicts for the plaintiff can be sustained upon evidence which would not be sufficient in the\r\n\r\nordinary negligence action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorton v. Norfolk Southern Ry Co., Op. No. 3183 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 5, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at 34)\r\n\r\n(quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keaton on Torts Â§ 80, at 579) (alterations in original).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers does not allege he was injured by any activity or instrumentality of Norfolk. Rather, he contends Norfolk sent him to\r\n\r\nan unreasonably unsafe place to work.  \"Under the FELA, an employer has a nondelegable, continuing duty to exercise\r\n\r\nreasonable care in furnishing its employees a safe place to work.\" Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Trimiew, 480 S.E.2d 104,\r\n\r\n106 (Va. 1997); see also Crawford v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 901 S.W.2d 252, 254 (Mo. Ct. App. 1995); McGraw v.\r\n\r\nNorfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 500 S.E.2d 300 (W.Va. 1997). \"This duty exists even when the employees are on the premises of a\r\n\r\nthird party over which the employer has no control.\"  Schrier v. Indiana Harbor Belt R. Co., 430 N.E.2d 204, 207 (Ill. App.\r\n\r\n1981) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe duty of providing a reasonably safe place to work does not require the elimination of all dangers, but it does require the\r\n\r\nelimination of the dangers which could be removed by the exercise of reasonable care on the part of the employer. \r\n\r\nCrawford, 901 S.W.2d 252.  The employee needs only to show that he was injured because of an unsafe condition that could\r\n\r\nhave been reasonably removed by the employer, and that the employer's negligence played any part, even the slightest, in\r\n\r\nproducing the employee's injury.  See Federal Employers' Liability Act, 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51, et seq.; Kaminski v. Chicago River\r\n\r\n&amp; Indian R. Co., 200 F.2d 1 (7th Cir. 1952); Trimiew, 480 S.E.2d at 106 (\". . . plaintiff's proof must justify with reason the\r\n\r\nconclusion that an employer's negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury for which damages are\r\n\r\nsought.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNorfolk contends that it had no knowledge, actual or constructive, that the underground slurry pipe which caused the hole\r\n\r\nwas installed beneath U.S. Silica's spur track(6), and, therefore, was not negligent in sending Rogers to the site.  We agree\r\n\r\nwith Norfolk.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReasonable foreseeability of harm is an essential ingredient of FELA negligence. \"[The railroad] may not be held liable if it\r\n\r\nhad no reasonable way of knowing that the hazard, which caused [the plaintiff's] injury, existed.\"  Brown, 18 F.3d at 250. \r\n\r\n\"Thus . . . the plantiff must show circumstances which a railroad, in the exercise of due care, could have reasonably foreseen\r\n\r\nas creating a potential for harm.\"  McGraw, 500 S.E.2d at 305.  \"Whether a particular danger was foreseeable . . . is a fact\r\n\r\nissue and, 'as with all factual issues under the FELA, the right of the jury to pass on this issue must be liberally construed.'\"\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Syverson v. Consolidated Rail Corp., 19 F.3d 824, 826 (1994).  However, \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nunder the FELA, the weight of the evidence must exceed a scintilla before the case properly may be left to the jury's\r\n\r\ndiscretion.  (Citations omitted).  If, without weighing the credibility of the witnesses, the evidence supports \"but one\r\n\r\nreasonable conclusion as to the verdict,\" the court should decide the matter, thus saving the result \"from the mischance of\r\n\r\nspeculation over legally unfounded claims.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimiew, 480 S.E.2d at 108 (quoting Stover v. Norfolk &amp; W. Ry. Co., 455 S.E.2d 238 (1995) (quoting Brady, 320 U.S. at\r\n\r\n479-80)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its order addressing Norfolk's post-trial JNOV motion, the trial court found  Norfolk had constructive notice of the slurry\r\n\r\npipes underneath the spur tracks at the U.S. Silica plant.  The court determined that Norfolk was familiar with railroad\r\n\r\nindustry standards promulgated by the American Railroad Engineering Association (AREA).  These standards require\r\n\r\nportions of pipes running under railroad tracks to be encased and require industries to notify a railroad if they want to install\r\n\r\npipes beneath any track whether owned by the railroad or the industry.  Additionally, the court determined Norfolk was\r\n\r\n\"surely aware of the nature of U.S. Silica's slurry operations\" at the plant site because track supervisors had inspected the\r\n\r\ntracks at the site before.  The court concluded that \"[t]hese facts alone provide sufficient basis to infer that Norfolk Southern\r\n\r\nhad constructive notice of the presence of slurry pipes underneath the spur track at the U.S. Silica plant,\" and therefore, the\r\n\r\njury could infer that Norfolk had breached its duty of ordinary care by failing to inquire about the encasement of these pipes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, there is no indication from the record that Norfolk had any reason to know that U.S. Silica had slurry pipes\r\n\r\nrunning under its spur tracks, much less that these pipes were not encased as required by the AREA standards and by general\r\n\r\nengineering standards.  Even when the conductor found the hole on the afternoon in question, none of U.S. Silica's\r\n\r\npersonnel made any mention of the slurry pipes below the tracks or that such a pipe under the track had burst two days\r\n\r\nbefore this incident. Norfolk cannot be expected to know the operational details of a sand plant or of the placement of pipes\r\n\r\nit did not know even existed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold it was not reasonably foreseeable that Rogers would be injured by inspecting the track or a hole under the tracks at\r\n\r\nthis location.  Unless a Norfolk employee saw or knew of the prior pipe leaks, or at least knew that pipes were in the ground\r\n\r\nbeneath the tracks, it is impossible for Norfolk to have had actual or constructive knowledge of any danger at this location. \r\n\r\n\"Events too remote to require reasonable prevision need not be anticipated.\" Brady, 320 U.S. at 483.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally under the FELA, an employer's \"'. . . conduct may  become unreasonable if the employer, after being informed\r\n\r\nthat a condition is potentially dangerous, fails to investigate' and, if necessary, correct the problem.\" Gallose v. Long Island\r\n\r\nR. Co., 878 F.2d 80, 85 (2d Cir. 1989) (quoting Mohn v. Marla Marie, Inc., 625 F.2d 900, 902 (9th Cir. 1980)).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employer must conduct proper inspections to discover dangers in places where employees are required to work, and\r\n\r\nmust take reasonable precautions for the employees' safety after determining the existence of such dangers.  But even under\r\n\r\nthe FELA, an employee still must establish that the employer was guilty of some act of negligence in order to recover.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrimiew, 480 S.E.2d at 106 (citations omitted). The degree of care a railroad must exercise is \"commensurate with the\r\n\r\ndanger reasonably to be anticipated.\" Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Dixon, 189 F.2d 525, 527 (5th Cir. 1951).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers was Norfolk's investigator and the Norfolk employee most familiar with the U.S. Silica site.(7)  In fact, Rogers was\r\n\r\nsent to inspect the hole on U.S. Silica's property and determine the dangerousness of the work site.  Rogers was not\r\n\r\nrequired to disregard any of his doctor's earlier recommendations about limiting his physical activities in his position as\r\n\r\ninvestigator.  Given Norfolk's lack of knowledge concerning the nature of the hole, it could not have provided Rogers with\r\n\r\nany warnings that would have prevented the harm to Rogers.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, Rogers asserts Norfolk was negligent in failing to procure U.S. Silica's execution of the railroad's standard sidetrack\r\n\r\nagreement.  Norfolk's predecessor repeatedly asked U.S. Silica's predecessor to execute the sidetrack agreement, but the\r\n\r\nagreement was never signed.  Rogers maintains U.S. Silica's and its predecessor's refusal to execute the sidetrack agreement\r\n\r\nshould have given Norfolk constructive notice that U.S. Silica was not complying with the AREA standards.  However, \r\n\r\nNorfolk had no reason to suspect that U.S. Silica's refusal to sign the sidetrack agreement stemmed from its failure to encase\r\n\r\nthe pipes below the tracks in blatant violation of the industry's standards.(8)    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRogers also maintains, absent the sidetrack agreement, U.S. Silica was under no obligation to comply with the railroad's\r\n\r\nstandards.  When cross-examined by U.S. Silica's attorney, Rogers's expert at trial agreed that U.S. Silica was under no\r\n\r\nobligation to abide by the AREA standards if Norfolk never required that they do so.  In closing argument, Rogers argued\r\n\r\nthat if Norfolk had refused service until the sidetrack agreement was signed, U.S. Silica would have signed the agreement. \r\n\r\nRogers maintains that if U.S. Silica had signed the agreement, it would have abided by the regulations and encased the pipes,\r\n\r\nthereby avoiding Rogers's injury. Therefore, Rogers argues, it was negligent for Norfolk to provide services to U.S. Silica\r\n\r\nwhen it had no assurances that the spur track would be operated in accordance with railroad regulations.  Rogers further\r\n\r\nargues his injury would have been avoided if Norfolk had refused to operate the spur track until the sidetrack agreement was\r\n\r\nexecuted.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if Norfolk should have insisted that U.S. Silica execute the sidetrack agreement,  the causal connection between\r\n\r\nNorfolk's failure to do so and Rogers's injury is extremely tenuous.  The evidence showed U.S. Silica knew about the\r\n\r\nrailroad's regulations, but still failed to comply with them.  U.S. Silica's former plant manager, George Foster, testified he\r\n\r\nknew the company was supposed to notify the railroad before putting pipes under the tracks.  He also testified to knowing\r\n\r\nthat, under the railroad's rules, pipes going under industry tracks should be encased.  Furthermore, encasing pipes which are\r\n\r\nlocated below traversed areas is not just a railroad industry standard, but is a general principle of civil engineering according\r\n\r\nto Rogers's expert.  It is improbable that U.S. Silica would have complied with the standards of the sidetrack agreement if it\r\n\r\nhad been executed.  The execution of the sidetrack agreement would have established Norfolk's right to indemnification\r\n\r\npursuant to the agreement.(9)  It would not have provided Norfolk with any additional assurance that U.S. Silica would abide\r\n\r\nby the railroad's standards.  See Norton v. Norfolk Southern Ry Co., Op. No. 3183 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 5, 2000)\r\n\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 23 at 34) (quoting W. Page Keeton et al., Prosser &amp; Keaton on Torts Â§ 80, at 579) (\"[T]here must\r\n\r\nbe some shreds of proof both of negligence and of causation, and [ ] speculation, conjecture, and possibilities [are] not [ ]\r\n\r\nenough.\").   Because there is no causal connection between Norfolk's failure to get U.S. Silica to sign the sidetrack\r\n\r\nagreement and Rogers's injury, Norfolk has not been shown to be negligent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConsidering the evidence in the light most favorable to Rogers, the only  reasonable inference that can be drawn from the\r\n\r\nevidence in the record is that there was no negligence on the part of Norfolk.  Therefore, the trial court erred in denying\r\n\r\nNorfolk's motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict.(10)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the order of the circuit court is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, J.J. concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   The FELA subjects every common carrier by railroad engaging in interstate commerce to liability to\r\n\r\nemployees injured as a result of the carrier's negligence.   See 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51, et. seq.  State courts have\r\n\r\nconcurrent jurisdiction with federal courts in FELA suits. 45 U.S.C. Â§ 56. \r\n\r\n2.   Slurry is sand that has been mixed with water so that it can be pumped through a pipe.  It has a \"sandblasting\" effect,\r\n\r\nhowever, on the pipes through which it is pumped.  This sandblasting effect causes the plastic pipes to wear out.  Once a\r\n\r\npipe springs a leak, it is a certainty that other leaks will appear soon and the entire pipe must be replaced. Normally, slurry is\r\n\r\npumped through the pipe, but sometimes U.S. Silica's employees wash out the slurry line by pumping pure water through it. \r\n\r\nIf the pipe is not encased within another protective pipe and has a blowout while water is being pumped through it, a hole\r\n\r\nwill form in the sandy ground above the pipe and the ground will eventually cave in. Apparently, this is what caused the hole\r\n\r\nRogers was sent to inspect.\r\n\r\n3.  Rogers made FELA claims on both of these injuries, and both claims were resolved. \r\n\r\n4.   Rogers already had a thirty percent impairment to the back as a result of the two prior back injuries.\r\n\r\n5.   U.S. Silica also brought an appeal of the verdict before this Court.  However, during the pendency of the appeal, Rogers\r\n\r\nand U.S. Silica entered into a settlement agreement and the appeal was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n6.   The evidence in the record establishes without contradiction that U.S. Silica owns and maintains this spur track.  Norfolk\r\n\r\nused the track to reach the industry from its main line.  Norfolk's inspections of the track only involved looking for problems\r\n\r\nwith the track that would make the railroad car derail, such as making sure the distance between the rails (or the gauge) was\r\n\r\nproper.\r\n\r\n7.   In fact, Rogers had inspected this spur tract on numerous prior occasions.  Rogers testified that he had visited the site\r\n\r\napproximately once a month since he was assigned to the territory eighteen months before his injury.\r\n\r\n8.   Correspondence from U.S. Silica's predecessor to Norfolk's predecessor indicates that the industry's failure to execute\r\n\r\nthe sidetrack agreement was unrelated to the unencased pipes below the spur tracks.  According to the correspondence, the\r\n\r\nindustry wanted the railroad to modify the paragraphs in the sidetrack agreement addressing use of the spur track by third\r\n\r\nparties, close clearances, indemnification of the railroad's mistakes, and the right to repair the track.\r\n\r\n9.   Cf. Illinois Cent. Gulf. R. Co. v. Crown Zellerbach Corp., 859 F.2d 386 (5th Cir. 1988); Cazad v. Chesapeake Oil Ry.\r\n\r\nCo., 622 F.2d 72 (4th Cir. 1980); Missouri Pac. R.R. Co. v. International Paper Co., 618 F.2d 492 (8th Cir. 1980).\r\n\r\n10.   Because of the disposition of the above issue, we find it unnecessary to address Norfolk's\r\n\r\nremaining issues on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3249","title":"Nelson v.

The Workers' Compensation Commission, reversing the\r\n\r\nSingle Commissioner, agreed.  The Circuit Court, in reversing the Commission, found Nelson was an independent\r\n\r\ncontractor.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow Cab hired Nelson in 1995 as a part-time taxi driver.  During his tenure at Yellow Cab, Nelson gradually increased the\r\n\r\nnumber of shifts he worked.  In addition, Nelson was employed as a postal worker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 6, 1998, Yellow Cab dispatched Nelson to pick up a passenger in North Charleston for transport to the West\r\n\r\nAshley area.  Nelson was murdered, apparently by the passenger.  The sole question to be determined on appeal is whether\r\n\r\nNelson was an employee or an independent contractor of Yellow Cab at the time of his death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow Cab requires taxi drivers to file an application for employment.  The application form reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is to certify that although I drive a taxicab owned and/or operated by Yellow Cab Company . . . I am in no way\r\n\r\nemployed by the company: that I recieve [sic] no salary or other compensation from the company, and that my only financial\r\n\r\nrelationship with the company is to pay rent on the cab I drive, to pay for the gasoline used by me on my shift, and to return\r\n\r\nthe cab with all keys and equipment in good condition at the end of my shift.  In consideration of the expense in my training\r\n\r\nand indoctrination, I agree and understand that I must drive a company car owned by Yellow Cab Co. and not a terminal fee\r\n\r\ncontractor for at least six months after my indoctrination period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAll drivers must sign the application before working for Yellow Cab.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn conflict with the relationship expressed in the application form, Yellow Cab exercises control over the driver's behavior\r\n\r\nwhile in the taxi, and the manner in which the drivers perform their jobs.  Yellow Cab's \"Drivers Information and Training\r\n\r\nPackage\" includes numerous rules and regulations governing the drivers.  For instance, although there is no uniform for the\r\n\r\ndrivers, Yellow Cab imposes a dress code, prohibiting unbuttoned and/or sleeveless shirts, and requiring a neat, orderly\r\n\r\nappearance.  Failure to observe the dress code is a ground for termination of employment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, in accordance with fares set by the City of Charleston, Yellow Cab mandates a set fare, and drivers must transport\r\n\r\nfour people for the price of one fare.  The drivers are bound to use a Yellow Cab meter as opposed to an Ever Ready\r\n\r\nDispatch, or charging flat rates.  Yellow Cab is the only cab company in the area that uses meters to establish taxi fares.\r\n\r\nYellow Cab acknowledged that a driver's failure to use a Yellow Cab meter constitutes a ground for termination.  The\r\n\r\ndrivers are subject to the Yellow Cab rule prohibiting drivers from transporting non-paying passengers (\"dead-heading\"). \r\n\r\nYellow Cab admitted dead-heading by a driver was cause for termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are numerous other grounds for termination of a taxi driver by Yellow Cab including: possessing a weapon of any kind\r\n\r\nin the taxi; drinking or using drugs while operating the taxi; failing to deliver packages; and filing a false application.  Yellow\r\n\r\nCab conceded it could fire a driver for any reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drivers generally retain their fares.  However, Yellow Cab makes payments to the drivers under special fare situations in\r\n\r\nwhich a driver picks up a certain fare or package, a blue card is issued by the company calling for the pickup, and the driver\r\n\r\nturns the card into Yellow Cab for payment.  These customers are charge account customers billed directly by Yellow Cab. \r\n\r\nYellow Cab neither withholds taxes from the drivers' fares nor issues W-2 or 1099 forms to the drivers.  On his tax return,\r\n\r\nNelson reported his taxi fares as income from a sole proprietorship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drivers lease their taxis from Yellow Cab, paying for either twelve or twenty-four hour shifts.  Nelson leased his taxi for\r\n\r\ntwenty-four hour shifts at $79 per day.  The taxis are painted yellow and identified as Yellow Cab vehicles.  Yellow Cab\r\n\r\nfurnishes the radio and use of the dispatch service.  The drivers pay for their own gas.  The company pays for insurance, a\r\n\r\nportion of which is collected from the drivers, and repairs on the vehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe drivers select the number of hours they want to work during the twenty-four hour shift.  Whenever a driver checks in as\r\n\r\noperating the vehicle as a taxi, he is required to have the radio on and respond to the dispatcher.  Yellow Cab allows the\r\n\r\ndrivers to earn \"vacation,\" which is paid in the form of Yellow Cab giving a car to a driver without requiring lease fees. \r\n\r\nOnce the drivers pay the lease fee, they are entitled to personal use of the taxi whenever they are not checked in as operating\r\n\r\nthe vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the evening Nelson was murdered, Nelson was dispatched by a Yellow Cab dispatcher to pick up the fare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoverage under the Workers' Compensation Act depends on the existence of an employment relationship.  McDowell v.\r\n\r\nStilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947).  Whether an employer-employee relationship exists is an initial\r\n\r\nfact to be established prior to applying the Act.  Dawkins v. Capitol Constr. Co., 250 S.C. 406, 158 S.E.2d 651 (1967); Gray\r\n\r\nv. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000).  In the absence of such a relationship, the Workers'\r\n\r\nCompensation Commission lacks jurisdiction to order or approve an award of benefits.  Glass v. Dow Chem. Co., 325 S.C.\r\n\r\n198, 482 S.E.2d 49 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence or absence of an employment relationship is thus a jurisdictional fact, which the court must determine based on\r\n\r\na review of all the evidence in the record.  Bridges v. Wyandotte Worsted Co., 243 S.C. 1, 132 S.E.2d 18 (1963).  If the\r\n\r\nfactual issue before the Full Commission involves a jurisdictional question, as here, this Court's review is governed by the\r\n\r\npreponderance of the evidence standard.  Vines v. Champion Bldg. Products, 315 S.C. 13, 431 S.E.2d 585 (1993); Lake v.\r\n\r\nReeder Constr. Co., 330 S.C. 242, 498 S.E.2d 650 (Ct. App. 1998).  See also Kirksey v. Assurance Tire Co., 314 S.C. 43,\r\n\r\n443 S.E.2d 803 (1994)(this Court can find facts in accordance with the preponderance of evidence when determining\r\n\r\njurisdictional question in Workers' Compensation case); Canady  v. Charleston County Sch. Dist., 265 S.C. 21, 216 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n755 (1975)(in determining whether Commission had jurisdiction of claim presented, appellate court is not bound by finding\r\n\r\nof fact by Commission; appellate court has both power and duty to review entire record and find therefrom jurisdictional\r\n\r\nfacts, without regard to conclusion of Commission on such issue, and will decide jurisdictional question in accord with\r\n\r\npreponderance of evidence);  Lake, 330 S.C. at 246, 498 S.E.2d at 653 (\"Judicial review of a Workers' Compensation\r\n\r\ndecision is governed by the substantial evidence rule of the Administrative Procedures Act.  However, when the\r\n\r\nCommission's jurisdiction is at issue, the reviewing court is not bound by the Commission's findings of fact upon which\r\n\r\njurisdiction is dependent.\" (citation omitted)); Sanders v. Litchfield Country Club, 297 S.C. 339, 377 S.E.2d 111 (Ct. App.\r\n\r\n1989)(where jurisdictional issue is raised, this Court must review record and make its own determination whether the\r\n\r\npreponderance of evidence supports Commission's factual findings bearing on that issue).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause the issue in the case sub judice is jurisdictional, this Court has the power and duty to review the record and decide\r\n\r\nthe jurisdictional facts in accordance with the preponderance of evidence.  See Lake, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNelson's estate contends the preponderance of evidence establishes Nelson was a Yellow Cab employee at the time of his\r\n\r\ndeath.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWorkers' Compensation laws are intended by the Legislature to relieve workers of the uncertainties of a trial for damages by\r\n\r\nproviding sure, swift recovery for workplace injuries.  Peay v. U.S. Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 437 S.E.2d 64 (1993); Cokeley\r\n\r\nv. Robert Lee, Inc., 197 S.C. 157, 14 S.E.2d 889 (1941).  Although an award will not be made unless an employment\r\n\r\nrelationship existed at the time of the injury, to give effect to this legislative intent, Workers' Compensation statutes are\r\n\r\nconstrued liberally in favor of coverage.  See  Mauldin v. Dyna-Color/Jack Rabbit, 308 S.C. 18, 416 S.E.2d 639 (1992);\r\n\r\nMcDowell v. Stilley Plywood Co., 210 S.C. 173, 41 S.E.2d 872 (1947); Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996); McLeod v. Piggly Wiggly Carolina Co., 280 S.C. 466, 313 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 1984). \r\n\r\nFurthermore, South Carolina's policy is to resolve jurisdictional doubts in favor of the inclusion of employees within\r\n\r\nWorkers' Compensation coverage.   O'Briant v. Daniel Constr. Co., 279 S.C. 254, 305 S.E.2d 241 (1983); Horton v.\r\n\r\nBaruch, 217 S.C. 48, 59 S.E.2d 545 (1950).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe case at bar presents a novel issue in South Carolina: Is a taxi driver, who leases a taxicab for a per diem payment under a\r\n\r\nwritten document entitled \"Drivers Information and Training Package\" and keeps his fares and tips as compensation, an\r\n\r\nemployee covered by Workers' Compensation law, or an independent contractor to whom coverage is unavailable?  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fundamental test of the employment relationship is the right of the employer to control the details of the employee's\r\n\r\nwork.  Gray v. Club Group, Ltd., 339 S.C. 173, 528 S.E.2d 435 (Ct. App. 2000); 3 Arthur Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson,\r\n\r\nLarson's Workers' Compensation Law Â§ 61.01 (1999).  It is not the actual control exercised, but whether there exists the\r\n\r\nright and authority to control and direct the particular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its\r\n\r\naccomplishment.  Young v. Warr, 252 S.C. 179, 165 S.E.2d 797 (1969); Gray, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test is based on the right to control, not the exercise.  3 Larson, supra, Â§ 61.02.  \"Most often the distinction is of\r\n\r\nimportance when a skilled or experienced worker appears to be doing his or her job without supervision or interference.\"  Id. \r\n\r\nBy an \"exercise test,\" the employee would seem to be uncontrolled; yet, \"it will often be found that the employer, in any\r\n\r\nshowdown, would have the ultimate right to dictate the method of work if there were any occasion to do so.\"  Id.  The right\r\n\r\nto control does not require the dictation of the thinking and manner of performing the work.  3 Larson, supra, Â§ 61.02 n.3. \r\n\r\nIt is enough if the employer has the right to direct the person by whom the services are to be performed, the time, place,\r\n\r\ndegree, and amount of said services.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether an individual is an employee or an independent contractor is a fact-specific determination reached by applying\r\n\r\ncertain general principles.  South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546,\r\n\r\n459 S.E.2d 302 (1995); Gray, supra.  There are four factors to determine the right of control:  (1) direct evidence of the\r\n\r\nright or exercise of control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of equipment; and (4) right to fire.  Ray Covington\r\n\r\nRealtors, supra; Tharpe v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 174 S.E.2d 397 (1970); Gray, supra.  In his treatise on Workers'\r\n\r\nCompensation law, Larson academically analyzed the factors:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is commonly assumed that these [factors] work with equal force in both directions; that is, that in each instance, evidence\r\n\r\nof an employment-type arrangement is persuasive of the employee status, while contrary evidence is persuasive of\r\n\r\nindependent contractorship. . . . [Yet], for the most part, any single factor is not merely indicative of, but, in practice,\r\n\r\nvirtually proof of, the employment relation; while, in the opposite direction, contrary evidence is as to any one factor at best\r\n\r\nonly mildly persuasive evidence of contractorship, and sometimes is of almost no such force at all.  Independent\r\n\r\ncontractorship, then, is established usually only by a convincing accumulation of these [factors], while employment, although\r\n\r\na similar accumulation is often attempted, can if necessary often be solidly proved on the strength of one of the four\r\n\r\n[factors].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Larson, supra, Â§ 61.04.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find compelling evidence under the first and fourth factors leading to the ineluctable conclusion that an employment\r\n\r\nrelationship existed.  Yellow Cab retains the right to fire the drivers and the right to control the drivers to the magnitude,\r\n\r\ndegree, and intensity that Nelson is an employee rather than an independent contractor.  Larson discussed the strength of the\r\n\r\nright-to-fire factor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe power to fire, it is often said, is the power to control.  The absolute right to terminate the relationship without liability is\r\n\r\nnot consistent with the concept of independent contract, under which the contractor should have the legal right to complete\r\n\r\nthe project contracted for and to treat any attempt to prevent completion as a breach of contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA[n] . . . illustration[] will show how cogent a consideration the unqualified right to fire can be. . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a Louisiana case, [Deason v. Coal Operators Cas. Co., 43 So. 2d 630, 631 (La. Ct. App. 1950)], a pulpwood producer,\r\n\r\nalthough furnishing his own truck, paying his own employees, and being paid by the cord, was held to be an employee almost\r\n\r\nentirely because he was subject to an absolute right in the employer to terminate the relationship.  The court said:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe essential criterion seems to be found in the ability of the employer to terminate the work at will.  Any employee cannot\r\n\r\ndeem to be independent when his work can be stopped at the will of the employer, because . . . the power to terminate the\r\n\r\nemployment, of necessity, gives to the employer the power to control the activities of the employee. . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamples could be multiplied in which most of the other indicia-method of payment, furnishing of equipment, skilled nature\r\n\r\nof the work, sometimes provision by the employee even of his own assistants and insurance, and not infrequently contractual\r\n\r\ndisavowals of right of control and of employment relation-have pointed toward independent contractorship; yet the one\r\n\r\nelement of right to fire, with its attendant implied right to control, has carried the day for employment relationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Larson, supra, Â§ 61.08[2] (footnotes omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYellow Cab, relying on South Carolina Workers' Compensation Comm'n v. Ray Covington Realtors, Inc., 318 S.C. 546,\r\n\r\n459 S.E.2d 302 (1995), argues the \"right to terminate the working relationship is not inconsistent with Yellow Cab's right to\r\n\r\nterminate the independent contractor relationship.\"  In Ray Covington Realtors, the South Carolina Supreme Court\r\n\r\nexplained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the fourth factor, the right to fire, weighs here in favor of a finding that [Respondent] is an employee, the fact that\r\n\r\n[Respondent] believed appellant could fire him is not inconsistent with appellant's right to terminate the independent\r\n\r\ncontractor relationship.  The dispositive question is appellant's \"right and authority to control and direct [Respondent's]\r\n\r\nparticular work or undertaking, as to the manner or means of its accomplishment.\"  Young v. Warr, [252 S.C. 179, 165\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 797 (1969)].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRay Covington Realtors, 318 S.C. at 549, 459 S.E.2d at 303.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nClearly, Yellow Cab retains rights to control beyond just the right to terminate an independent contractor relationship, as\r\n\r\ndescribed in Ray Covington Realtors.  In conjunction with the right to fire, Yellow Cab reserves rights over the drivers'\r\n\r\ndress, equipment used in the vehicles, fare-setting, dead-heading, and radio dispatch requirements when checked in as a\r\n\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur research reveals there is a split of authority on whether a taxi driver, who leases a taxicab under a per diem payment\r\n\r\nagreement and keeps his fares and tips as compensation, is an employee or independent contractor.  Irrefutably, the majority\r\n\r\nrule holds the taxicab driver is an employee for Workers' Compensation coverage.  These decisions typically are based on\r\n\r\nfactual aspects of the relationship, such as the right of the cab owners to control the drivers' activities and the right to\r\n\r\nterminate.  See Bowdoin v. Anchor Cab, 643 So. 2d 42 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1994); Globe Cab Co. v. Industrial Comm'n,\r\n\r\n427 N.E.2d 48 (Ill. 1981); Penny Cab Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 326 N.E.2d 393 (Ill. 1975); Yellow Cab Co. v. Industrial\r\n\r\nComm'n, 606 N.E.2d 523 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992); Yellow Cab Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 464 N.E.2d 1079 (Ill. App. Ct. 1984);\r\n\r\nWhite Top and Safeway Cab Co. v. Wright, 171 So. 2d 510 (Miss. 1965); Shinuald v. Mound City Yellow Cab Co., 666\r\n\r\nS.W.2d 846 (Mo. Ct. App. 1984); Employers Ins. v.

App. Div. 1958); Ziegler v.\r\n\r\nFillmore Car Serv., Inc., 442 N.Y.S.2d 276 (N.Y. App. Div. 1981); Nesbit v. Powell, 558 S.W.2d 436 (Tenn. 1977). \r\n\r\nSimilarly, numerous decisions under the Social Security Act and unemployment compensation statutes have held drivers of\r\n\r\nleased cabs were employees.  See Jones v. Goodson, 121 F.2d 176 (10th Cir. 1941)(although this case arose under Social\r\n\r\nSecurity Act, for present purposes, the reasoning of the court is apposite); Salt Lake Transp. Co. v. Board of Review, 296\r\n\r\nP.2d 983 (Utah 1956)(analogous even though case was decided under the Unemployment Compensation Act).  Cases\r\n\r\nholding that lessee cab drivers are not employees for Workers' Compensation purposes represent the minority view.  Yellow\r\n\r\nCab Coop., Inc. v. Workers' Compensation Appeals Bd., 277 Cal. Rptr. 434 (Cal. Ct. App. 1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Georgia, in Golosh v. Cherokee Cab Co., 176 S.E.2d 925 (Ga. 1970), addressed whether a claimant\r\n\r\ntaxicab driver was, at the time of his injury, an employee of Cherokee Cab Company rather than an independent contractor. \r\n\r\nIn reversing the finding of the Georgia Court of Appeals that claimant was an independent contractor, the court concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals . . . based its decision solely on a consideration of the manner in which Golosh was compensated by\r\n\r\nCherokee Cab Company as a driver, and disregarded the true test of the nature of the relationship in such cases as many\r\n\r\ntimes set forth in decisions by this court and by the Court of Appeals.  \"The test to be applied in determining whether the\r\n\r\nrelationship of the parties under a contract for the performance of labor is that of employer and servant, or employer and\r\n\r\nindependent contractor, lies in whether the contract gives, or the employer assumes, the right to control the time, manner,\r\n\r\nand method of executing the work, as distinguished from the right merely to require certain definite results in conformity to\r\n\r\nthe contract.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying the foregoing well established test to the facts in this case, it is clear that there was ample evidence to authorize the\r\n\r\nboard to find a retention by the employer of the right of control over the time, manner and method of doing the work.  Under\r\n\r\nthe evidence, the claimant was employed to drive a taxicab owned by Cherokee Cab Company.  Aside from the manner of\r\n\r\ncompensation dealt with by the Court of Appeals, the evidence showed that he was employed for no definite period of time\r\n\r\nand that he could have been discharged or his services dispensed with at any time at the pleasure of the owner and president\r\n\r\nof the company.  The claimant received most, if not all, of his calls to pick up passengers over the radio through the\r\n\r\nCherokee Cab Company's transmitter.  He testified that if he did not wish to go to a particular location to pick up a\r\n\r\npassenger, he simply did not reply to the radio call.  This evidence shows no more than that the employer, due to the nature\r\n\r\nof the work, had, as a practical matter, little direct control over the details of the employee's work and that the employee had\r\n\r\nample opportunity to evade supervision.  However, the claimant testified that the employer could tell him when to come to\r\n\r\nwork, how long to work and when to quit work, and that if he refused to obey the employer's instructions as to working\r\n\r\nhours, the employer could discharge him or refuse to let him drive a cab thereafter.  We have no hesitancy in holding that,\r\n\r\nnothing else appearing, this evidence as to the power to terminate the employment alone is sufficient evidence to authorize a\r\n\r\nfinding that the cab company had the right to control the time, manner and method of doing the work. . . . \"[W]here one is\r\n\r\nemployed generally to perform certain services for another, and there is no specific contract to do a certain piece of work\r\n\r\naccording to specifications for a stipulated sum, it is inferable that the employer has retained the right to control the manner,\r\n\r\nmethod, and means of the performance of the contract, and that the employee is not an independent contractor.\"  The test is\r\n\r\nnot whether the employer did in fact control and direct the employee in the work, but it is whether the employer had that\r\n\r\nright under the employment contract. . . . [T]he mode of payment, while it may be a circumstance tending to indicate the\r\n\r\nnature of the relationship between the parties, it is by no means the controlling or decisive factor to be considered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGolosh, 176 S.E.2d at 926-27 (citations omitted)(emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Supreme Court held, in a circumstance similar to this case, an employer-employee relationship existed between a\r\n\r\ntaxicab owner and injured taxicab driver, who paid a stipulated sum to the owner for the right to drive the taxicab on a\r\n\r\ntwelve hour shift and who kept all fares and tips.  In Morgan Cab Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 324 N.E.2d 425 (Ill. 1975), the\r\n\r\ncourt identified a number of general factors to distinguish between an employee and an independent contractor.  The court\r\n\r\nemphasized:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo one factor may determine what the relationship is between parties in a given case.  It may be necessary to consider a\r\n\r\nnumber of factors with evidentiary value, such as the right to control the manner in which the work is done, the method of\r\n\r\npayment, the right to discharge, the skill required in the work to be done, and who provides tools, materials, or equipment. \r\n\r\nOf these factors the right to control the manner in which the work is done is the most important in determining the\r\n\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMorgan, 324 N.E.2d at 428.  In applying this right to control test, the court upheld the commission's decision that an\r\n\r\nemployer-employee relationship existed between the cab company and the lease cab driver based upon the following\r\n\r\nevidence.  The driver was required to accept radio calls from the dispatcher, to have his radio repaired at a designated shop,\r\n\r\nand to bring the cab to the company garage upon request for inspection or repair.  The cabs were painted alike with the\r\n\r\ncompany's name and telephone number on their sides, and the cab company could refuse the driver a cab for various reasons. \r\n\r\nThe court further determined it was clear the cab company was operating a fleet of cabs for public use rather than simply\r\n\r\nleasing vehicles with no interest in their operation as taxis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In resolving the control factor, courts in taxicab cases have been heavily influenced by: (1) whether the driver accepted\r\n\r\nradio calls from the company; (2) whether the driver had his radio and cab repaired by the company; (3) whether the vehicles\r\n\r\nwere painted alike with the  name of the company and its phone number on the vehicle; and (4) whether the company could\r\n\r\nrefuse the driver a cab.\"  Yellow Cab Co. v. Industrial Comm'n, 606 N.E.2d 523, 525 (Ill. App. Ct. 1992).  Additionally,\r\n\r\ncourts are impacted by the right to discharge the driver or cancel the lease.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preponderance of evidence supports the Commission's factual finding that Nelson was an employee of Yellow Cab at\r\n\r\nthe time of his death.  There is no inflexible rule applicable to all situations to determine whether an individual is an\r\n\r\nemployee.  The existence of the employer-employee relationship is primarily, in any given case, a question of ultimate fact,\r\n\r\ninvolving in its determination a conclusion derived from a consideration of all the evidentiary facts disclosed by the evidence,\r\n\r\nin connection with the application of principles of law to the consideration of the evidence.  See Morgan Cab Co., supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe recognize the Court of Appeals of North Carolina, when faced with an issue comparable to the instant case, ruled the\r\n\r\ntaxicab driver was an independent contractor.  In Alford v. Victory Cab Co., 228 S.E.2d 43 (N.C. Ct. App. 1976), the\r\n\r\nclaimant, a taxicab driver, was shot during an argument with the company's dispatcher.  The commissioner denied\r\n\r\ncompensation to the claimant, holding he was not an employee.  On appeal, the court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis appeal presents the question of whether appellant was an employee or an independent contractor.  Appellant contends\r\n\r\nthat he was not an independent contractor.  He supports his argument by several cases from other jurisdictions.  Our research\r\n\r\nreveals additional authority outside this State in support of the contention that a taxicab driver who rents his cab and keeps\r\n\r\nhis fares and tips as compensation is an employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the few states which have considered the employment status of a claimant on the facts as presented here\r\na majority\r\n\r\nappear to consider the claimant an employee for purposes of workmen's compensation.  In determining whether\r\n\r\nthe claimant is an employee entitled to compensation many of these cases turn on the nature of the claimant's work in\r\n\r\nrelation to the business for which the work is being done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe test we must employ to determine appellant's employment status turns on the amount of control exercised over the\r\n\r\nclaimant.  As stated in Little v. Poole, 11 N.C. App. 597, 601, 182 S.E.2d 206, 209 (1971):\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The test for determining whether a relationship between parties is that of employer and employee, or that of employer and\r\n\r\nindependent contractor, is whether the party for whom the work is being done has the right to control the worker with\r\n\r\nrespect to the manner or method of doing work, as distinguished from the right merely to require certain definite results\r\n\r\nconforming to the contract.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFindings of fact support the Commissioners' conclusion that appellant was an independent contractor, because the right of\r\n\r\ncontrol did not rest in Victory.  Claimant rented a taxicab from Victory for a twenty-four hour period for a flat fee of $15,\r\n\r\nand Victory had no supervision or control over the manner or method claimant chose to operate that cab.  Claimant had\r\n\r\ncomplete control over his work schedule while he used the cab.  He could disregard the radio dispatcher, use the cab for his\r\n\r\nown purposes during the time it was rented, and he kept all the fares and tips he earned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlford, 228 S.E.2d at 45-46 (citations omitted)(emphasis added).  The court affirmed the claimant was not an employee,\r\n\r\nfinding the cab company exercised no control.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur courts often rely on North Carolina law to interpret the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Act.  See Spoone v.\r\n\r\nNewsome Chevrolet-Buick, 309 S.C. 432, 434, 424 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1992)(\"Because South Carolina adopted large\r\n\r\nportions of the North Carolina Workers' Compensation legislation, we rely on North Carolina precedent in Workers'\r\n\r\nCompensation cases.\"); Stephen v. Avins Constr. Co., 324 S.C. 334, 478 S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 1996)(decisions of North\r\n\r\nCarolina courts interpreting that state's Workers' Compensation statute are entitled to weight when South Carolina courts\r\n\r\ninterpret South Carolina Workers' Compensation law because South Carolina statute was fashioned after that of North\r\n\r\nCarolina).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, our courts are not bound by North Carolina precedent.  See Layton v. Hammond-Brown-Jennings Co., 190 S.C.\r\n\r\n425, 3 S.E.2d 492 (1939).  Larson criticized the Alford decision:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe arrangement was renewed each day, and the company had the right to refuse a cab to any driver whose work was not\r\n\r\nsatisfactory.  The court indicated that the test to be employed in North Carolina in determining the claimant's employment\r\n\r\nstatus was the amount of control exercised by the alleged employer, rather than the \"relative nature of the work test.\"  On\r\n\r\nthis basis the court declined to follow what it acknowledged to be the majority result on similar facts in other jurisdictions. \r\n\r\nThe court ignored completely the control implications of the company's right to \"fire\" from day to day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSee 3 Larson, supra, Digest Â§ 60.01D n.2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur courts have consistently held the test to be utilized is the right to control.  The result reached by the Alford court flies in\r\n\r\nthe face of the majority rule in this country.  See\r\nCentral Mgmt. Co. v. Industrial Comm'n of Arizona, 781 P.2d 1374 (Ariz.\r\n\r\nCt. App. 1989)(\"[M]any jurisdictions hold that taxi drivers are employees for workers' compensation purposes. . . . [W]e\r\n\r\njoin those jurisdictions . . . .\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe decline to follow Alford in these circumstances and find Yellow Cab retained the right to exercise sufficient control over\r\n\r\nNelson, including the right to fire, as to render him an employee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe existence of the application form and language denying an employer-employee relationship does not\r\n\r\nchange the nature of the relationship in this case.  The attempt of a contract to specify a particular legal\r\n\r\nrelationship that is designed to evade the Workers' Compensation Act will be disregarded.  3 Larson, supra, Â§\r\n\r\n61.05[1] (citing Spivey v. D.G. Constr. Co., 321 S.C. 19, 467 S.E.2d 117 (Ct. App. 1996)(conversation during\r\n\r\nwhich employer states to employee that they \"get their story straight\" and agree the employee is an\r\n\r\nindependent contractor will be disregarded when the four factors of employment status are present)).  Even\r\n\r\nwithout an evasive intent, \"the contractual designation of the relationship as employment or contractorship may\r\n\r\nbe so plainly and completely at odds with the undisputed facts that the contractual designation must be\r\ndisregarded.&quot;  3 Larson, supra, Â§ 61.05[1].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold the test to be employed in South Carolina in determining the claimant's employment status is the right\r\n\r\nto control, not the amount of actual control exercised.  Giving full efficacy to the test, we rule the \"right to\r\n\r\ncontrol\" maintained by Yellow Cab sustains the factual and legal conclusions of the Workers' Compensation\r\n\r\nCommission.  The preponderance of evidence demonstrates Nelson was an employee of Yellow Cab. \r\n\r\nConcomitantly, we REVERSE the Circuit Court, AFFIRM the Commission, and REMAND for further\r\n\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3250","title":"Collins v.

The trial court held Collins failed to meet the requirement of\r\n\r\nthe uninsured motorist statute, South Carolina Code Annotated Section 38-77-170 (Supp. 1999). \r\n\r\nWe reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Collins was injured in an automobile accident on March 11, 1994.  According to Collins, she was\r\n\r\ntraveling north on Highway 301 when a car traveling on Highway 521 failed to yield the right of\r\n\r\nway where Highway 521 intersects with Highway 301.  Collins swerved into the lane of oncoming\r\n\r\ntraffic to avoid the car.  Because a truck was heading towards her, she swerved back into her\r\n\r\noriginal lane, sideswiping a car driven by Joanne Calvin.  The car that failed to yield the right of\r\n\r\nway did not stop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollins filed this action against John Doe, the unknown driver of the unidentified vehicle pursuant\r\n\r\nto Section 38-77-170.  She alleged Doe's failure to yield the right of way and other acts of\r\n\r\nnegligence, carelessness, and recklessness caused her collision with Calvin.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Collins called Roberta Briggs, Calvin's sister, as a witness. Briggs testified that while she\r\n\r\nwas walking she saw Calvin and waved at her so that she could catch a ride.  Calvin stopped to\r\n\r\nmake a left turn to pick her up.  Briggs stated she saw a light-colored car fail to stop at the yield\r\n\r\nsign and keep going.  The light-colored car passed Calvin on the right, hitting the sidewalk.\r\nBriggs\r\n\r\nsaw Collins swerve out of her lane and try to pass Calvin's car on the driver's side.  Briggs testified\r\n\r\nthat when Collins was not able to get around because of oncoming traffic, she pulled back and hit\r\n\r\nCalvin's car.  On cross-examination, she testified Collins was traveling fast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollins also called Calvin as a witness.  Calvin testified she was coming off of Highway 521 at the\r\n\r\nHighway 301 intersection when she stopped for her sister.  She stated the car traveling behind her\r\n\r\non Highway 521 ran Collins's car into the other lane.  Calvin stated Collins had to hit her to avoid\r\n\r\na head-on collision with a truck.  On cross-examination, she testified she did not see Collins's car\r\n\r\nuntil it hit her. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Collins rested her case, Doe moved for a directed verdict arguing that Collins's failure to\r\n\r\nproduce an affidavit of a witness to the accident as required by Section 38-77-170 rendered her\r\n\r\nunable to recover under the statute.  The trial court granted the motion.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCollins argues the trial court erred in granting Doe's motion for directed verdict.  She asserts that\r\n\r\nalthough she did not present the affidavit of a witness to the accident, the witnesses' trial\r\n\r\ntestimony satisfied the statutory requirements.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-170 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the\r\n\r\ninsured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision,\r\n\r\nunless:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police\r\n\r\nauthority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2)  the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or the accident\r\n\r\nmust have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle; \r\n\r\nprovided however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the\r\n\r\naccident contained in the affidavit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) the insured was not negligent in failing to determine the identity of the other vehicle and the\r\n\r\ndriver of the other vehicle at the time of the accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following statement must be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit provided in\r\n\r\nsubitem (2) above:  A FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS\r\n\r\nAFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL\r\n\r\nPENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The primary concern in interpreting a statute is to determine the intent of the legislature if it\r\n\r\nreasonably can be discovered in the language when construed in the light of its intended purpose. \r\n\r\nWhitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1996);\r\nSingletary v. South Carolina Dep't of Educ.,\r\n\r\n316 S.C. 153, 447 S.E.2d 231 (Ct. App. 1994). \"However plain the ordinary meaning of the words\r\n\r\nused in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a\r\n\r\nresult so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would\r\n\r\ndefeat the plain legislative intention.\" Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C.\r\n\r\n271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).  The uninsured motorist statutes are remedial in nature and\r\n\r\nenacted for the benefit of the injured persons.  They are to be liberally construed so that the\r\n\r\npurpose may be accomplished. Gunnels v. American Liberty Ins. Co., 251 S.C. 242, 161 S.E.2d 822\r\n\r\n(1968); Franklin v. Devore, 327 S.C. 418, 489 S.E.2d 651 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a case such as this where there was no contact with the unknown vehicle, the plain language of\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-170 requires the filing of an affidavit by a corroborating witness.  An affidavit is a\r\n\r\n\"voluntary declaration of facts written down and sworn to by the declarant before an officer\r\n\r\nauthorized to administer oaths.\"  Black's Law Dictionary 58 (7th ed. 1999).  In requiring the witness\r\n\r\nto sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident, the legislature intended to\r\n\r\npreclude false statements by making such a false statement subject to criminal laws.  Testimony at\r\n\r\ntrial is obviously taken under oath. Giving false testimony at trial constitutes the felony of perjury\r\n\r\nand subjects the perjurer to a fine and/or up to five years imprisonment.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-9-10\r\n\r\n(Supp. 1999).  Although Section 38-77-170 does not specifically provide for sworn testimony as a\r\n\r\nsubstitute for an affidavit, we find such testimony fulfills the legislature's intent.  To hold\r\n\r\notherwise would elevate form over substance. See \r\nSouth Carolina Second Injury Fund v. American\r\n\r\nYard Products, 330 S.C. 20, 496 S.E.2d 862 (1998), citing \r\nLiberty Mut. Ins. Co. v. South Carolina\r\n\r\nSecond Injury Fund, 318 S.C. 516, 518, 458 S.E.2d 550, 551 (1995)  (\"[t]he real purpose of the\r\n\r\nlegislature will prevail over the literal import of the words.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Accordingly, we find the trial court erred in holding Collins' claim must fail as a matter of law\r\n\r\nbecause she failed to provide affidavits by her corroborating witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Doe asserts that even if this court holds Collins satisfied Section 38-77-170, he is still entitled\r\n\r\nto a directed verdict because Collins did not produce witnesses to establish John Doe caused the\r\n\r\naccident.  We disagree.  (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, this court, like the trial court, must\r\n\r\nconsider the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  Brady Dev. Co. v. Town\r\n\r\nof Hilton Head Island, 312 S.C. 73, 439 S.E.2d 266 (1993).  A directed verdict should not be granted\r\n\r\nunless only one reasonable inference can be drawn from the evidence. Horry County v. Laychur,\r\n\r\n315 S.C. 364, 434 S.E.2d 259 (1993).  When considering the motion, neither this court nor the trial\r\n\r\ncourt has authority to decide credibility issues or to resolve conflicts in the testimony and evidence.\r\nGarrett v. Locke, 309 S.C. 94, 419 S.E.2d 842 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBriggs testified that she saw a light colored car fail to yield to Collins and she saw Collins swerve\r\n\r\nout of her lane and then sideswipe Calvin's car.  On cross-examination, she stated Collins was\r\n\r\ntraveling too fast to stop.  Calvin also testified an unknown car failed to yield and ran Collins out of\r\n\r\nher lane.  On cross-examination, however, Calvin admitted she did not see Collins until the impact. \r\n\r\nThe testimony by these witnesses verifies the existence of an unknown vehicle driven by an\r\n\r\nunknown driver that failed to yield the right-of-way.  It is a question for the jury as to the weight to\r\n\r\nassign the testimony and whether John Doe's negligence or Collins's own negligence caused the\r\n\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe decision of the lower court is REVERSED and the case\r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANDERSON, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, J., dissents in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY, Judge (dissenting):    I respectfully dissent.  I would affirm, believing as did the trial\r\n\r\njudge, that the absence of the affidavit mandated by the South Carolina General Assembly in\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code section 38-77-170  required him to direct a verdict against the appellant\r\n\r\nLeatrice Williams Collins. (2)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 38-77-170 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the owner or operator of any motor vehicle which causes bodily injury or property damage to the\r\n\r\ninsured is unknown, there is no right of action or recovery under the uninsured motorist provision,\r\n\r\nunless:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the insured or someone in his behalf has reported the accident to some appropriate police\r\n\r\nauthority within a reasonable time, under all the circumstances, after its occurrence;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) the injury or damage was caused by physical contact with the unknown vehicle, or the accident\r\n\r\nmust have been witnessed by someone other than the owner or operator of the insured vehicle;\r\n\r\nprovided however, the witness must sign an affidavit attesting to the truth of the facts of the\r\n\r\naccident contained in the affidavit;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following statement must be prominently displayed on the face of the affidavit provided in\r\n\r\nsubitem (2) above:  A FALSE STATEMENT CONCERNING THE FACTS CONTAINED IN THIS\r\n\r\nAFFIDAVIT MAY SUBJECT THE PERSON MAKING THE FALSE STATEMENT TO CRIMINAL\r\n\r\nPENALTIES AS PROVIDED BY LAW.  (3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, there is no sworn statement in writing, which is what an \"affidavit\" is. (4)  Absent also is the\r\n\r\nmandated signature of a witness on an affidavit \"attesting to the truth of the facts of the accident.\" \r\n\r\nMoreover, the mandated warning concerning false statements appears nowhere \"on the face of [an]\r\n\r\naffidavit.\"  Collins in no way complied with any of the express commands of the statute in question,\r\n\r\nas easy as they are to be understood and observed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn interpreting a statute, we, as appellate judges, are to give effect to the language used by the\r\n\r\nlegislature, (5) especially if, as here, the statute's language is plain and unambiguous. (6)  To do that\r\n\r\nmeans we can only hold that the requirement of a certain affidavit, with prescribed language\r\n\r\nprinted in a particular way and appearing prominently on the face of the affidavit, does not include\r\n\r\na witness' mere testimony given in court under oath.  (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to any suggestion that to disallow in-court testimony under oath is to elevate form over\r\n\r\nsubstance, I can only say that the technical requirement of a signed affidavit containing on its face\r\n\r\ncertain prescribed language is not a mere matter of form; rather, it is one of substance. (8)  Indeed, it\r\n\r\nis an express element of the right of action itself. (9)  The legislature has said there\r\nmust be a signed\r\n\r\naffidavit with certain language that must appear prominently on its face and, if one is not\r\n\r\nprovided, \"there is no right of action or recovery.\" (10)  If the legislature had deemed the in-court\r\n\r\ntestimony of a witness under oath a proper substitute for the particular type of affidavit required\r\n\r\nby section 38-77-170, then the legislature would have said so in plain and unambiguous language.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI would affirm.\r\n\r\n1.  See \r\nI'on, L.L.C.  v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (holding appellate court may\r\n\r\naddress issue the lower court did not rule on where the issue is raised as an additional sustaining ground).  \r\n\r\n2.    When granting respondent John Doe's motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel I am compelled to apply the plain language of the statute.  While in my mind the sworn testimony of\r\n\r\na witness in court is the equivalent of an affidavit from the standpoint of reliability, that is not what the\r\n\r\nstatute clearly requires[.]  I feel that I must give effect to the plain language of the legislature.  This court\r\n\r\ncannot legislate.  [I]f that is not what the legislature had intended and if they had intended that sworn\r\n\r\ntestimony in court would be sufficient, [it] very clearly could have put that in the statute or the statute\r\n\r\ncould be amended to that effect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI feel like that while that testimony is just as reliable as an affidavit might be, there may be other reasons\r\n\r\nthat the legislature chose not to include that in the statute. . . . I think it's clearly a matter for the\r\n\r\nlegislature which I cannot do. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.    S.C. Code Ann.

Smith appeals a family court order terminating her parental rights to her\r\n\r\nminor children, Nicole Octavia Smith and Vincent Davis.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social Services removed Smith's children from the home in\r\n\r\nFebruary of 1995.  They were subsequently returned to her care.  On August 15, 1995, the family\r\n\r\ncourt issued an ex parte order granting DSS emergency protective custody of the children.  The\r\n\r\norder stated Smith was incarcerated and the children were in the custody of an aunt who may be\r\n\r\ninvolved in drugs.  In addition, the order stated Smith had tested positive for drugs in June of 1995\r\n\r\nafter being ordered to remain drug free.  The family court consolidated the February, 1995 action\r\n\r\nwith the August, 1995 action.  The children have remained in the custody of DSS since their\r\n\r\nremoval in August of 1995. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn January 15, 1997, DSS filed a complaint seeking termination of Smith's parental rights. \r\n\r\nFollowing a three day hearing on the matter, the family court determined Smith's parental rights\r\n\r\nto the children should be terminated.  The court found the children had lived outside of Smith's\r\n\r\nhome for a period of six months and Smith had wilfully failed to visit or support them.  In addition,\r\n\r\nthe family court found the children were removed from Smith pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Section\r\n\r\n20-7-736 for at least six months and, despite DSS's reasonable and meaningful efforts to provide\r\n\r\nappropriate rehabilitative services, Smith failed to remedy the conditions that caused removal. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the family court terminated Smith's rights to the children and ordered DSS to submit\r\n\r\na plan for permanent placement of the children. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.  Standard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  In a termination of parental rights case, the best interests of the children are the paramount\r\n\r\nconsideration.  South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 340 S.E.2d 149\r\n\r\n(1986); South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. Richardson, 298 S.C. 130, 378 S.E.2d 601 (Ct. App.\r\n\r\n1989).  A decision by the family court to terminate parental rights must be supported by clear and\r\n\r\nconvincing evidence. Hopkins v. South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs., 313 S.C. 322, 437 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n542 (1993).  On appeal, this court may review the record and make its own findings as to whether \r\n\r\nclear and convincing evidence supports termination. South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992); South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs. v. O'Banner, 291\r\n\r\nS.C. 253, 353 S.E.2d 151 (Ct. App. 1987).  Due deference, however, is accorded the decision of the\r\n\r\nfamily court judge, who saw and heard the witnesses and is in a better position to evaluate their\r\n\r\ncredibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony. Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281,\r\n\r\n513 S.E.2d 358 (1999); see  also \r\nAiken County Dep't of Social Servs. v. Wilcox, 304 S.C. 90, 93, 403\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 142, 144 (Ct. App. 1991) (\"[W]here the evidence presented in the record adequately supports\r\n\r\nthe findings of the trial judge, due deference should be given to his judgment based on his superior\r\n\r\nposition in weighing such evidence.  This is especially true in cases involving the welfare and best\r\n\r\ninterests of children.\") (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  Jurisdiction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith asserts the family court and DSS lacked jurisdiction under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736 by\r\n\r\nvirtue of a failure to find abuse or neglect following the removal of the children from Smith's\r\n\r\nhome. (1)  She argues, because no finding of abuse or neglect was ever made, the children were\r\n\r\nimproperly removed under Â§ 20-7-736(F) and the court, therefore, was deprived of jurisdiction.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first note Smith cites no authority for the proposition that, following removal of a child from the\r\n\r\nhome of a parent, a failure by the court to make a finding of abuse or neglect deprives the family\r\n\r\ncourt of jurisdiction in a subsequent termination of parental rights action.  The law provides the\r\n\r\nfamily court has exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings involving the termination of parental\r\n\r\nrights.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1562 (Supp. 1999).  We are aware of no provision divesting the court\r\n\r\nof that jurisdiction based on alleged improper removal of a child.  Further, whether or not there\r\n\r\nwas no finding of abuse or neglect is questionable.  In an order dated May 22, 1997, the family\r\n\r\ncourt stated, \"That there has been no finding of abuse or neglect in this case and this order shall so\r\n\r\nreflect.\"  However, in an unchallenged order dated September 21, 1995, the family court found, by a\r\n\r\npreponderance of the evidence, physical neglect of the children. (2)  Finally, assuming arguendo the\r\n\r\nMay 1997 order supersedes the September 1995 order and there was therefore no finding of abuse\r\n\r\nor neglect, we hold the lack of such a finding in this case did not deprive the family court of\r\n\r\njurisdiction over a proceeding for termination of Smith's parental rights.  In an unappealed order\r\n\r\ndated December 10, 1996, Smith consented to DSS retaining custody of her children.  She therefore\r\n\r\nacquiesced in the placement of her children in the care of DSS, and the initial reason for removal is\r\n\r\nirrelevant.  Accordingly, we find no jurisdictional defect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  Failure to visit or support\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe termination of parental rights is governed by statute.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572\r\n\r\nprovides for termination upon the family court's finding at least one of several grounds and that\r\n\r\ntermination is in the best interest of the child.  Here, the family court found evidence to sustain the\r\n\r\nfollowing statutory grounds for termination:   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(2) The child has been removed from the parent pursuant to Section 20-7-736, has been out of the\r\n\r\nhome for a period of six months, and the parent has not remedied the conditions which caused the\r\n\r\nremoval;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(3) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that\r\n\r\ntime the parent has wilfully failed to visit the child. . . ;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(4) The child has lived outside the home of either parent for a period of six months, and during that\r\n\r\ntime the parent has wilfully failed to support the child. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (Supp. 1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith argues the legislature did not intend for termination under subsections (3) and (4) when the\r\n\r\nseparation from the home is imposed pursuant to Â§ 20-7-736 under subsection (2).  She asserts\r\n\r\nsubsections (3) and (4) apply only where subsection (2) does not.  We disagree with this\r\n\r\ninterpretation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary concern in interpreting a statute is to determine the intent of the legislature. \r\n\r\nWhitner v. State, 328 S.C. 1, 492 S.E.2d 777 (1996).  Where a statute is complete, plain, and\r\n\r\nunambiguous, legislative intent must be determined from the language of the statute itself.\r\nId.  A\r\n\r\nstatute must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant with the purpose,\r\n\r\ndesign, and policy of the legislature. Beattie v. Aiken County Dep't of Social Servs., 319 S.C. 449,\r\n\r\n462 S.E.2d 276 (1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find no language in the statute to indicate the General Assembly intended to limit the\r\n\r\ntermination of parental rights for failure to support or visit the child to situations where the child\r\n\r\nis out of the home for reasons other than removal by DSS.  Indeed, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1560\r\n\r\n(Supp. 1999) states, \"The purpose of this subarticle is to establish procedures for the reasonable\r\n\r\nand compassionate termination of parental rights where children are abused, neglected, or\r\n\r\nabandoned in order to protect the health and welfare of these children. . . .\"  Section 20-7-736\r\n\r\nprovides for the removal of children from the custody of a parent or guardian in situations where\r\n\r\nthe child is abused or neglected and cannot be protected from unreasonable risk of harm.  See S.C.\r\n\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 20-7-736(B) and (F) (Supp. 1997).  Clearly, the statute as a whole contemplates the\r\n\r\nchildren will be living outside the home based on removal pursuant to Â§ 20-7-736.  Where\r\n\r\nlegislative design is unmistakable, there is no room for construction and the courts are required to\r\n\r\napply the statute literally. Morgan v. South Carolina Dep't of Social Servs., 280 S.C. 577, 313\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 350 (Ct. App. 1984). See \r\nalso  Hooper v. Rockwell,\r\nsupra. (affirming the termination of\r\n\r\nparental rights for wilful failure to support when the child had been taken into emergency\r\n\r\nprotective custody).  Accordingly, we find no merit to Smith's argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith also asserts the evidence does not support a finding that she wilfully failed to visit or\r\n\r\nsupport her children.  We disagree.  Whether a parent's failure to visit or support a child is \"wilful\"\r\n\r\nwithin the meaning of Â§20-7-1572 is a question of intent to be determined from all the facts and\r\n\r\ncircumstances in each case.  Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992).\r\nParental conduct \"which\r\n\r\nevinces a settled purpose to forego parental duties may fairly be characterized as 'willful' because it\r\n\r\nmanifests a conscious indifference to the rights of the child to receive support and consortium from\r\n\r\nthe parent.\" Id. at 53, 413 S.E.2d at 839. While the trial judge is given wide discretion in making\r\n\r\nthis determination, the element of willfulness must be established by clear and convincing\r\n\r\nevidence. Id. at 52, 413 S.E.2d at 838.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith asserts she visited the children many times.  However, the record indicates, while Smith\r\n\r\nvisited the children thirteen times from August of 1995 until January of 1997, the visitations were\r\n\r\noften sporadic, with three and four month lapses between some visits. (3)  Most importantly, she did\r\n\r\nnot visit them at all from January of 1997 until the termination hearings began in December of\r\n\r\n1997.  Smith had a right to reasonable visitation with her children, which she failed to exercise. \r\n\r\nWe find Smith's evident indifference to seeing her children constitutes wilfulness sufficient to\r\n\r\nsupport termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith also argues her failure to support the children was not wilfull.   In an order dated January\r\n\r\n21, 1997, the family court ordered Smith to pay child support of thirty-five dollars per month. \r\n\r\nSmith failed to make any child support payments.  Smith asserts her failure to support the\r\n\r\nchildren was due to her inability to acquire gainful employment caused by her increasing seizure\r\n\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe record shows Smith suffers from epilepsy and has a tenth grade education.  She stated she\r\n\r\nworked at McDonald's until 1995 when she lost her job because of her seizures.  She testified she\r\n\r\nrecently sought employment with Quincy's, McDonald's, and Hardee's, but received no offers of\r\n\r\nemployment.  Smith takes Dilantin to control the seizures.  She stated she does not have seizures\r\n\r\nwhen she takes her medication.  She acknowledged that, according to the directions on the\r\n\r\nmedicine, she is not to drink alcohol while taking the medication.  However, Smith admitted that\r\n\r\nshe continued to drink alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we are sympathetic to Smith's health problems, we do not find her epilepsy relieves her\r\n\r\nof her duty to support her children.  Smith provided no evidence that she was unable to obtain\r\n\r\nemployment outside of the food service industry.  Furthermore, she admittedly consumes alcohol\r\n\r\ndespite its contraindication for her seizure medicine.  Accordingly, we find Smith's failure to pay\r\n\r\nchild support constitutes wilfulness sufficient to justify termination.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.  Failure to rehabilitate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith argues the family court erred in finding she had not completed the programs of\r\n\r\nrehabilitation.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConditions which precipitated the removal of the children included substance abuse by Smith, lack\r\n\r\nof supervision of the children, and inadequate housing.  DSS developed numerous treatment plans\r\n\r\nfor Smith.  The plans' objectives included that Smith was to never leave the children unattended,\r\n\r\nand she was to work with the homemaker service and apply for housing.  Smith was also required\r\n\r\nto refrain from using drugs and alcohol and was to participate in a counseling or treatment\r\n\r\nprogram for substance abuse and undergo random drug tests.  She was also required to\r\n\r\nsuccessfully participate in and complete parenting skills classes.  DSS referred her to the\r\n\r\nLexington-Richland Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council (LRADAC) and parenting skills classes.  In\r\n\r\naddition, Smith was not to have visitation with the children while under the influence of drugs or\r\n\r\nalcohol.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe record shows Smith was admitted to LRADAC on June 8, 1995, March 21, 1996, and October\r\n\r\n3, 1996.  Each time she was discharged for refusal of treatment, failure to follow services and/or\r\n\r\nrefusal of detox.  Smith was also referred to parenting classes on two occasions.  In the class held\r\n\r\nSeptember 28, 1995 to December 21, 1995 Smith attended five of twelve classes.  In the class held\r\n\r\nJanuary 9, 1997 to April 3, 1997, Smith attended only three of the twelve classes.  No certificate\r\n\r\nwas awarded Smith because of her lack of attendance.  According to the DSS homemaker aide,\r\n\r\nSmith failed to successfully rehabilitate with the homemaking services as well.  Smith did not\r\n\r\nfollow the homemaker's advice and was unavailable when the homemaker visited.  Furthermore, a\r\n\r\nDSS social service aide testified that during one visitation, Smith smelled of alcohol and exhibited\r\n\r\nsigns of an intoxicated person.  Smith admitted she continued to use alcohol and had been drinking\r\n\r\nwhen she visited the children.  Smith stated she wanted to take her children home with her.  Her\r\n\r\n\"home\" at the time of the hearing was with her boyfriend, whom she had known for only three to\r\n\r\nsix months.  Although she was apparently financially dependent on him, she stated she did not\r\n\r\nknow where he worked or how he earned his income.  She also admitted she did not know his age,\r\n\r\ntestifying one time that he was forty-one years old and another time that he was fifty-one. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith first asserts the evidence relied upon by the family court was improperly admitted.  She\r\n\r\nasserts the DSS case workers did not have personal knowledge about the completion of the various\r\n\r\nprograms to which Smith was referred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith objected to the admission of Smith's file at LRADAC, asserting the file would contain\r\n\r\ninformation that was opinion testimony. However, she agreed to allow the LRADAC witness to\r\n\r\ntestify about Smith's attendance and whether she completed the program.  Similarly, she\r\n\r\nconsented to the admission of Smith's attendance records at the parenting classes.  Smith therefore\r\n\r\ncannot challenge the admission of this evidence on appeal.  See \r\nJackson v. Speed, 326 S.C. 289, 486\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 750 (1997) (a party who fails to object to the admission of evidence when it is offered cannot\r\n\r\nmake its admission a ground for appeal).  Further, Smith objected only to the admission of notes of\r\n\r\nthe DSS aide from homemaker services, and these notes were not admitted into evidence.  The aide\r\n\r\ntestified, without objection, about her recollection of her own experiences with Smith.  Her\r\n\r\ntestimony therefore did not constitute hearsay.  Finally, the testimony of the DSS caseworkers is\r\n\r\ncumulative to the above testimony.  Accordingly, we find that even if their testimony constituted\r\n\r\nhearsay, the admission of the evidence was harmless. See \r\nJackson, supra (stating where the\r\n\r\nhearsay is merely cumulative to other evidence, its admission is harmless and does not constitute\r\n\r\nreversible error).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith also asserts she successfully completed an inpatient program at Morris Village.  Although\r\n\r\nSmith testified that she had completed the program, she only presented a certificate for recognition\r\n\r\nfor progress in treatment.  She presented no evidence that corroborated her testimony that she\r\n\r\ncompleted the program.  We defer to the family court, which was in the better position to judge\r\n\r\nSmith's credibility.  Furthermore, considering Smith's admitted continued use of alcohol and\r\n\r\nfailure to complete other programs, we find Smith failed to remedy the conditions of removal,\r\n\r\nthereby justifying termination of her parental rights.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the family court is \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.           South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-736 (Supp. 1997) provides in part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(B)  Upon investigation of a report received under Section 20-7-650 or at any time during the delivery of services by\r\n\r\nthe department, the department may petition the family court to remove the child from custody of the parent,\r\n\r\nguardian, or other person legally responsible for the child's welfare if the department determines by a preponderance\r\n\r\nof evidence that the child is an abused or neglected child and that the child cannot be protected from unreasonable\r\n\r\nrisk of harm affecting the child's life, physical health or safety, or mental well-being without removal. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(F)  A child must not be removed from the custody of the parent or guardian unless the court finds that the\r\n\r\nallegations of the petition are supported by a preponderance of evidence including a finding that the child is an\r\n\r\nabused or neglected child as defined in Section 20-7-490 and that retention of the child in or return of the child to the\r\n\r\nhome would place the child at unreasonable risk of harm affecting the child's life, physical health or safety, or\r\n\r\nmental well-being and the child cannot reasonably be protected from this harm without being removed.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n In addition, in an April 29, 1996 order, the family court made a finding of threat of harm of physical neglect. \r\n\r\nSmith challenged this order with a motion pursuant to Rule 60, SCRCP asserting she was not given notice of the\r\n\r\nhearing.

We\r\n\r\nreverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 27, 1995, Baker entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement (referred to by the parties as\r\n\r\nthe APA) with Barnacle to purchase the assets of a radio station owned by Barnacle.  On the same\r\n\r\nday, the parties entered into a Local Programming and Marketing Agreement (referred to as the\r\n\r\nLMA) that authorized Baker to operate the radio station.  The purchase price under the APA was\r\n\r\n$1,225,000.  Upon the execution of the APA, Baker paid Barnacle $100,000 as an earnest money\r\n\r\ndeposit.  Baker was to pay the remainder of the purchase price at closing.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sale and purchase of the station was subject to approval by the Federal Communications\r\n\r\nCommission (FCC).  The APA contained a covenant that Baker and Barnacle would \"file with the\r\n\r\nFCC on or before January 1, 1996, an application and such other documents . . . as may be\r\n\r\nnecessary or advisable to obtain FCC approval of the Assignment of License from [Barnacle] to\r\n\r\n[Baker].\"  The closing for the APA was to take place within thirty days of the FCC consent \"or such\r\n\r\nother time as the parties may mutually agree . . . .\"  The APA listed several events for termination\r\n\r\nof the agreement including termination upon \"[w]ritten notice of Buyer to Seller at the earlier of\r\n\r\nthe following:  (a)  the end of twelve (12) months following the effective date of the LMA; or (b) \r\n\r\nApril 30, 1996, that Buyer, in its sole discretion, has elected to terminate this Agreement.\"  If\r\n\r\nBaker terminated pursuant to this provision, Barnacle was to retain the $100,000 earnest money\r\n\r\ndeposit. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   The term of the LMA commenced on May 1, 1995.  Unless otherwise terminated, the LMA was to\r\n\r\nend on the earlier of April 30, 1998 or the closing of the sale of the station pursuant to the APA.  In\r\n\r\nthe event the LMA was terminated prior to the closing under the APA, the termination would\r\n\r\nresult in the termination of Baker's obligations and liabilities under the APA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDue to technical difficulties, Baker did not begin broadcasting until late June and was unable to\r\n\r\nrun commercials until early July.  The parties did not file the FCC application by January of 1996\r\n\r\nas provided in the contract. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy letter dated February 19, 1997, Barnacle stated the APA had terminated because the FCC\r\n\r\nassignment application had not been filed on or before January 1, 1996.  Barnacle inquired\r\n\r\nwhether Baker was still interested in buying the station under a new agreement.  Baker responded\r\n\r\nthat the APA was in full force.  It attached a formal opinion letter drafted by its FCC attorney.  It\r\n\r\ninformed Barnacle that it was instructing its attorney to file the paperwork for the FCC\r\n\r\nassignment in the third week of April.  Baker asserted they would close the transaction, subject to\r\n\r\nFCC approval, between August 15 and September 30, 1997, as the parties had previously\r\n\r\ndiscussed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response, Barnacle asserted that the APA was not enforceable by either party.  Barnacle stated,\r\n\r\n\"I believe my legal position is quite clear and sound.  What is less clear is how much may I, in good\r\n\r\nconscience, take advantage of it.\"  On March 7, 1997, Baker sent Barnacle the assignor's part of the\r\n\r\nFCC application.  It asked Barnacle to review the document and send it to Baker's FCC attorney\r\n\r\nwho already had its part of the form.  Baker informed Barnacle that it planned to immediately file\r\n\r\nthe FCC documents.  On March 27, 1997, Barnacle gave Baker a list of options to consider.  The\r\n\r\noptions included (1)  Baker taking the $100,000 back and tearing up the APA, (2)  Baker\r\n\r\npurchasing the station without the tower for $1.5 million and leasing the antenna and transmitter\r\n\r\nsites, (3) purchasing the station with the land and tower, but without the proceeds of any tower\r\n\r\nleases in place before transfer of the license, (4)  purchasing the station, land and tower, including\r\n\r\nthe leases, for $2,000,000 in addition to a percentage of the cash flow of the leases, or (5)  suing\r\n\r\nBarnacle for specific performance.  On April 4, 1997, Baker's attorney sent Barnacle a letter\r\n\r\nindicating they had not received the assignor's portion of the FCC application from Barnacle, and\r\n\r\nenclosed another copy of the assignor's part.  The attorney asserted Baker was standing ready,\r\n\r\nwilling and able to file the application with the FCC and to close on the sale after receiving the\r\n\r\nappropriate FCC authorization.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn April 22, 1997, Barnacle filed the present action seeking a declaratory judgment that the APA\r\n\r\nwas no longer enforceable.  Baker asserted counterclaims for specific performance and breach of\r\n\r\ncontract, and sought punitive damages.  (1) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court held the APA was an option contract, which must be strictly construed against\r\n\r\nBaker and requires exact compliance with its terms.  It found the FCC filing was the invoking\r\n\r\nevent that would alert Barnacle that the option was being exercised and that the option, when\r\n\r\nexercised, would result in a bilateral contract.  It found the option should have been exercised by\r\n\r\nBaker on January 1, 1996 because time is of the essence in an option contract.  However, the court\r\n\r\nheld Barnacle waived strict compliance by letting January 1, 1996 pass without taking any action\r\n\r\nwhen the option was not being exercised.  The court further held time again became a condition of\r\n\r\nthe contract and the extended delay justified the termination of the contract.  Accordingly, it\r\n\r\ndeclared the option was terminated. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe characterization of a declaratory judgment suit depends on the nature of the underlying\r\n\r\ncontroversy.  Felts v. Richland County, 299 S.C. 214, 383 S.E.2d 261 (Ct. App. 1989),\r\naff'd 303 S.C.\r\n\r\n354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991).  In order to determine the standard of review to apply, we must look to\r\n\r\nthe kind of action in which the issue involved would have been decided if there were no declaratory\r\n\r\njudgment procedure. Id.  Both Baker and Barnacle assert this action involves interpretation of a\r\n\r\ncontract and, as such, is an action at law. See \r\nJacobs v. Service Merchandise Co., 297 S.C. 123, 375\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 1 (Ct. App. 1988) (noting that an action to construe an unambiguous written contract is one\r\n\r\nat law).  In an action at law, tried without a jury, our scope of review extends merely to the\r\n\r\ncorrection of errors of law. Crary v. Djebelli, 329 S.C. 385, 496 S.E.2d 21 (1998).  Thus, the trial\r\n\r\ncourt's factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless a review of the record discloses that\r\n\r\nthere is no evidence which reasonably supports the judge's findings. Id.;\r\nTownes Assocs., Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). (2)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBaker asserts the trial court erred in holding the APA was an option contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   \"The cardinal rule of contract interpretation is to ascertain and give effect to the intention of the\r\n\r\nparties.\"  Chan v. Thompson, 302 S.C. 285, 289, 395 S.E.2d 731, 734 (Ct. App. 1990).  In\r\n\r\ndetermining the intention of the parties, a court first looks to the language of the contract and if\r\n\r\nthe language is clear and unambiguous, the language alone determines the contract's force and\r\n\r\neffect. C.A.N. Enterprises, Inc. v. South Carolina Health &amp; Human Servs. Fin. Comm'n, 296 S.C.\r\n\r\n373, 377, 373 S.E.2d 584, 586 (1988); Conner v. Alvarez, 285 S.C. 97, 101, 328 S.E.2d 334, 336\r\n\r\n(1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe supreme court recently set forth the three main characteristics of option contracts:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  they are unilateral contracts where the optionor, for a valuable consideration, grants the\r\n\r\noptionee a right to make a contract of purchase but does not bind the optionee to do so; (2)  they are\r\n\r\ncontinuing offers to sell, irrevocable during the option period; and (3)  the transition of an option\r\n\r\ninto a contract of purchase and sale can only be effected by an unqualified and unconditional\r\n\r\nacceptance of the offer in accordance with the terms and within the time specified in the option\r\n\r\ncontract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIngram v. Kasey's Assocs., Op. No. 25116 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 1, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No.\r\n\r\n17 at 36, 42.  Option contracts are strictly construed in favor of the optionor and against the\r\n\r\noptionee.  Id.  \"Furthermore, if the option requires performance in a certain manner, time is of the\r\n\r\nessence and exact compliance with the terms of the option are required.\" Id. at 42.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe primary test as to the character of a contract is the intention of the parties, such intention to\r\n\r\nbe gathered from the whole scope and effect of the language used.  Greenwood Mfg. Co. v. Worley,\r\n\r\n222 S.C. 156, 71 S.E.2d 889 (1952).  A review of the APA, as well as the LMA, reveals the APA is\r\n\r\nnot a typical option to purchase contract.  Rather, it appears the parties intended, by the APA, to\r\n\r\ncreate a contract for the sale and purchase of the assets of the radio station, with a provision\r\n\r\nallowing Baker to terminate the agreement within a specified time period.  The contract was to\r\n\r\ncontinue in full force and effect if Baker failed to terminate it within that time.  The APA is a\r\n\r\ncontract of sale with an option to terminate, rather than an option to purchase within a specified\r\n\r\ntime period.  Further, the APA did not require Baker to make an \"unqualified and unconditional\r\n\r\nacceptance\" of an offer within an option period to create a bilateral contract of sale.  Rather, under\r\n\r\nthe APA, Baker had the option to terminate the APA by sending written notice of the election to\r\n\r\nBarnacle by April 30, 1996.  Baker did not send written notice of termination within the time\r\n\r\nperiod it was allowed to terminate.  Thereafter, the APA continued as a bilateral agreement\r\n\r\nbetween the parties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, even if we were to agree with the master that the APA is an option contract, we find\r\n\r\nno evidence the parties intended for the filing of the FCC application to be the invoking event for\r\n\r\nBaker to exercise an option to create a bilateral contract.  The APA provided the parties would file\r\n\r\nthe FCC application on or before January 1, 1996.  The parties logically could not have intended \r\n\r\nJanuary 1, 1996 to constitute the last day for Baker to accept an offer creating a bilateral contract\r\n\r\nwhen the APA gave Baker the right to unilaterally terminate the contract until April 30, 1996. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe filing of the FCC application was clearly a covenant of the contract.  As the trial court held,\r\n\r\nhowever, Barnacle waived strict compliance with the January 1, 1996 filing date. (3)  We also note\r\n\r\nthe waiver of exact compliance with the filing date was not tantamount to the contract becoming a\r\n\r\ndisfavored \"perpetual contract.\"  Pursuant to the terms of the APA, if closing had not previously\r\n\r\noccurred, at the latest the APA was to terminate upon the termination of the LMA on April 30,\r\n\r\n1998.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, under the terms of the APA, Barnacle was allowed to terminate the contract based on\r\n\r\nBaker's failure to timely fulfill a material covenant of the contract only if, after twenty days of\r\n\r\nwritten notice, Baker had not cured or satisfied the condition.  Barnacle informed Baker on\r\n\r\nFebruary 19, 1997 it was terminating the APA due to the failure to file the FCC application.  Baker\r\n\r\nimmediately responded that it intended to proceed with the closing.  On March 7, 1997, Baker sent\r\n\r\nBarnacle the assignor's portion of the application and stated it had sent its portion of the\r\n\r\napplication to the FCC attorneys.  Harrison stated it is customary for the assignee to complete its\r\n\r\nportion first because the assignor has an obligation to the FCC to ensure that the assignee is a\r\n\r\nvalid assignee.  However, Barnacle never requested a copy of Baker's part of the application. \r\n\r\nRather, it continued in its course of claiming the APA was no longer in effect.  We find Baker\r\n\r\nfulfilled its responsibility for filing the FCC application and effectively cured any default. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Barnacle could not validly terminate the contract.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the contract remained in full force when Baker asserted it was ready to file the FCC\r\n\r\napplication and close the transaction, pending FCC approval.  We remand the matter to the trial\r\n\r\ncourt for consideration of Baker's counterclaims in conformity with this court's opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and ANDERSON, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.   The trial judge struck the request for punitive damages.  Baker does not appeal his ruling in this\r\n\r\nregard.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n We note that Baker counterclaimed for specific performance of the contract.  An action for specific performance\r\n\r\nlies in equity and, in reviewing such an action, the appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of\r\n\r\nthe preponderance of the evidence. See \r\nParker v. Shecut, Op. No. 3167 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 22, 2000)\r\n\r\n(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 20 at 20).  Because both Baker and Barnacle agree this is an action at law, we treat it as\r\n\r\nsuch and review the case under the more stringent law standard.  Further, we conclude the factual findings of the\r\n\r\njudge must be reversed under both an \"any evidence\" law standard as well as a \"preponderance of the evidence\"\r\n\r\nequity standard.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n The president of Baker, Frank Baker, testified he and the president of Barnacle, Pegram Harrison, discussed the\r\n\r\ntechnical problems and closing at a later date, and Barnacle was agreeable as long as payments continued under the\r\n\r\nagreements.  Harrison admitted that after the January 1 date passed, he asked Baker when it was going to close\r\n\r\nand was informed by Baker that the closing would be that summer.  He testified he was agreeable with a later\r\n\r\nclosing date as long as Baker assured him they would be closing soon.  When he finally became concerned Baker\r\n\r\nwould be unable to close, Harrison wrote the February 1997 letter. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3253","title":"Howard v.

(1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIsaac Howard, a veteran truck driver, was hauling a load of freshly harvested timber to a lumber mill on May 5, 1995, when\r\n\r\nhe saw a Highway Department tractor with a rear mounted mowing machine cutting grass along the right-hand side of the\r\n\r\nroad directly ahead of him.  Both vehicles were traveling in the same direction towards a roadway bridge.  Howard noticed\r\n\r\nthat a portion of the mowing deck extended onto the paved surface of his lane so he moved to the left in order to pass the\r\n\r\ntractor without striking the mowing deck.  Just as Howard began to overtake the tractor, it abruptly swerved from the\r\n\r\nshoulder into his lane and proceeded across the bridge.  Although Howard applied his brakes and moved completely into the\r\n\r\nopposite lane of travel, the bridge was not wide enough to allow Howard to pass the tractor without striking the rear of the\r\n\r\nmower deck.  The accident severely injured Howard and caused extensive damage to his truck.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Howard admits to seeing the tractor as it approached the bridge, he maintains that he thought it would remain off\r\n\r\nto the side of the road until he passed, then it would raise its mowing deck and cross the bridge.  \"I've seen plenty times\r\n\r\nwhen [Highway Department tractors] get to bridges and stuff like that, they stop, they [raise their mowing decks], and they\r\n\r\nproceed on the other side of the road, going down the road, but they don't leave [the mowing deck] down and cross out\r\n\r\nthere in front of somebody . . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFred Wright Jr. operated the tractor for the Highway Department.  He testified that on the day in question, he was cutting\r\n\r\ngrass along the side of the roadway when he approached the bridge.  Wright maintains he looked over his shoulder twice\r\n\r\nbefore easing onto the roadway so that he could cross the bridge.  \"When I got halfway across the bridge, I hear a horn.  I\r\n\r\ncould tell it was a big truck behind me.  I was too scared to look back so I just grabbed hold of the wheel and was waiting\r\n\r\nfor the impact.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in favor of Howard in the amount of $193,445 in actual damages.  This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highway Department's Statutory Exemption\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highway Department argues the trial court erred by allowing the jury to decide its negligence because S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n\r\n56-5-800 \"place[s] the burden on the motoring public to avoid persons who are engaged in work upon a highway\" and\r\n\r\nexempts Highway Department vehicles and personnel from the \"statutory requirements for yielding the right-of-way,\r\n\r\nentering a roadway and other standard traffic laws\" while \"engaged in work upon a highway.\"  Specifically, the Highway\r\n\r\nDepartment maintains that it \"and Mr. Wright owed no duty to keep a proper lookout or other traffic duties,\" and, therefore,\r\n\r\nthey could not be found negligent in causing the accident.  We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 56-5-800 states, in pertinent part, that certain provisions of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways \"shall\r\n\r\nnot apply to persons, motor vehicles and other equipment while actually engaged in work upon a highway . . . .\"  While this\r\n\r\nstatute has never been interpreted by a court of this State, its predecessor, Â§ 46-290, Code of Laws 1962, was interpreted. (2) \r\n\r\nOur supreme court held that, by operation of Â§ 46-290, the operator of a Highway Department motor grader \"violated no\r\n\r\nstatutory duty by stopping it in the north bound lane of travel and, under the facts which have been stated, no reasonable\r\n\r\ninference of negligence arises therefrom.\"   Taylor v. South Carolina State Highway Dep't, 242 S.C. 171, 180, 130 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n418, 423 (1963) (emphasis added).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Taylor holding encompasses two distinct propositions.  First, the court found that the Highway Department's grader did\r\n\r\nnot violate the statutory prohibition against \"stopping or parking a vehicle on the main traveled part of a highway\" because Â§\r\n\r\n46-290 exempts Department personnel and machinery from that prohibition while they are engaged in road work, as was the\r\n\r\ncase with the grader.  Secondly, the Court determined the grader's operator was not negligent under the circumstances of\r\n\r\nthe case.  The second proposition demonstrates that the court reviewed the record for actionable negligence on the part of\r\n\r\nthe Highway Department despite its exemption from statutory traffic duties.  It is not a pronouncement that the Highway\r\n\r\nDepartment owes no duty, statutory or otherwise, to the motoring public when engaged in work on a road.\r\nTaylor merely\r\n\r\nstands for the proposition that the duty owed by the Highway Department to the motoring public must be determined outside\r\n\r\nof the context of the traffic duties codified in certain sections of the Uniform Act Regulating Traffic on Highways. (3)  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, the violation of a traffic statute establishes the per se negligence of the offending driver.  Wise v. Broadway, 315\r\n\r\nS.C. 273, 433 S.E.2d 857 (1993); Locklear v. Southeastern Stages, Inc., 193 S.C. 309, 8 S.E.2d 321 (1940); Seals by\r\n\r\nCausey v. Winburn, 314 S.C. 416, 445 S.E.2d 94 (Ct. App. 1994).  If the violation is the proximate cause of an injury or\r\n\r\nproperty damage, then the injured party may maintain a negligence action against the offending driver.  Whitlaw v. Kroger\r\n\r\nCo., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991); Ready v. Barnwell County, 167 S.C. 62, 165 S.E. 676 (1932); Ott v. Pittman, 320\r\n\r\nS.C. 72, 463 S.E.2d 101 (Ct. App. 1995).  Obviously, the Highway Department must be exempt from this two-step analysis\r\n\r\nas its equipment and personnel must routinely violate traffic statutes to maintain our roadways.  Section 56-5-800 provides\r\n\r\nthe needed exemption and denies per se negligence to potential claimants which forces them to prove negligence in the\r\n\r\nspecific context of roadway repair operations.  In this action, the trial court properly refused to charge any traffic statutes\r\n\r\nthereby forcing the plaintiff to establish negligence within the context of the accident sub judice.  Accordingly, the trial court\r\n\r\ndid not err in refusing to direct a verdict for the Highway Department.  See Steinke v. South Carolina Dep't of Labor,\r\n\r\nLicensing &amp; Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 386, 520 S.E.2d 142, 148 (1999) (\"The trial court must deny [directed verdict]\r\n\r\nmotions when the evidence yields more than one inference or its inference is in doubt.\"); Holtzscheiter v. Thomson\r\n\r\nNewspaper, Inc., 332 S.C. 502, 513, 506 S.E.2d 497, 503 (1998) (\"A directed verdict on liability is properly denied where\r\n\r\nthere is any evidence, direct or circumstantial, justifying submission of the issue to the jury.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven if we were to find the trial court erred by not charging the specific language of Â§ 56-5-800, the error would be harmless\r\n\r\nas the court's instructions encapsulated the content of Â§ 56-5-800 and there is nothing in the record to suggest that omitting\r\n\r\nthe statutory language affected the verdict.  See Keaton v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 334 S.C. 488, 498, 514 S.E.2d 570, 575\r\n\r\n(1999) (\"In order to find the error [in charging the jury] harmless, [an appellate court] must determine beyond a reasonable\r\n\r\ndoubt that the error complained of did not contribute to the verdict.\"); McCourt v. Abernathy, 318 S.C. 301, 306, 457\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 603, 606 (1995) (\"Refusal to give a properly requested charge is not error if the general instructions are sufficiently\r\n\r\nbroad to enable the jury to understand the law and the issues involved.\").  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssumption of Risk\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Highway Department argues the trial court erred by failing to charge the jury on assumption of risk because Howard\r\n\r\nadmitted to seeing the Highway Department's tractor working along the side of the road before he collided with it.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAssumption of risk is an affirmative defense. (4)  Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Partnership, 334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510\r\n\r\n(Ct. App. 1998); Wilson v. Childs, 315 S.C. 431, 434 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 1993); Broom v. Southeastern Highway\r\n\r\nContracting Co., 291 S.C. 93, 352 S.E.2d 302 (Ct. App. 1986).  Affirmative defenses are waived if not pled.  Varn v. South\r\n\r\nCarolina Dep't of Highways and Pub. Transp., 311 S.C. 349, 428 S.E.2d 895 (Ct. App. 1993); D&amp;D Leasing Co. v. David\r\n\r\nLipson, Ph.D., P.A., 305 S.C. 540, 409 S.E.2d 794 (Ct. App. 1991).  In the instant action, the Highway Department waived\r\n\r\nits right to assert the defense as it failed to raise it in its answer.  See Rule 8(c), SCRCP (\"In pleading to a proceeding\r\n\r\npleading, a party shall set forth affirmatively the defense [of] . . . assumption of risk.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBurden Shifting\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinally, the Highway Department argues the trial court's jury instruction impermissibly shifted the burden of proof from the\r\n\r\nplaintiff to the defendant because the court \"spent substantial time [charging] the jury in this matter telling them that if it was\r\n\r\nnot safe for Mr. Wright to have pulled out onto the bridge when he did, then Mr. Wright was negligent.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will not reverse a trial court's instruction to a jury unless the court has abused its discretion.  Dalon v. Golden Lanes,\r\n\r\nInc., 320 S.C. 534, 466 S.E.2d 368 (Ct. App. 1996); Smith v. Ridgeway Chemicals, Inc., 302 S.C. 303, 395 S.E.2d 742 (Ct.\r\n\r\nApp. 1990).  \"An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's ruling is based on an error of law or, when grounded in\r\n\r\nfactual conclusions, is without evidentiary support.\"  Clark v. Cantrell 339 S.C. 369, 389, 529 S.E.2d 528, 539 (2000).  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to sustain an action for negligence, the plaintiff must demonstrate that the defendant breached a duty of care he or\r\n\r\nshe owed to the plaintiff.  Steinke, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142; Bishop v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 331\r\n\r\nS.C. 79, 502 S.E.2d 78 (1998).  In the context of operating an automobile, a defendant owes both statutory and common\r\n\r\nlaw duties to other motorists.  As discussed earlier, the Highway Department is exempt from statutory duties pursuant to Â§\r\n\r\n56-5-800.  Accordingly, the court instructed the jury on common law standards and instructed the jury to consider whether\r\n\r\nWright's operation of the tractor was negligent in light of those standards.  \"If it wasn't reasonable for [Wright] to pull out\r\n\r\n[in front of Howard] like that, then [Wright] was negligent.  But if it was reasonable, then [Wright] wasn't negligent.\"\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  Such an instruction did not shift the burden to the defendant; rather, it merely framed the jury's inquiry as\r\n\r\na single question.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the aforementioned reasons, the decision of the trial court is \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, C.J., CURETON and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1.   Because oral argument would not aid the court in resolving the issues on appeal, we decide this case without oral argument pursuant to Rule 215, SCACR.\r\n\r\n2.   Textually, the two statutes are very similar.  Compare S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-800 (1976) ([T]he provisions of this\r\n\r\nchapter . . . shall not apply to persons, motor vehicles and other equipment while actually engaged in work upon a highway\r\n\r\nbut shall apply to such persons and vehicles when traveling to or from such work.), with Â§ 46-290, Code of Laws 1962\r\n\r\n(\"The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to persons, teams, motor vehicles and other equipment while actually\r\n\r\nengaged in work upon the surface of a highway, but shall apply to such persons and vehicles when traveling to or from such\r\n\r\nwork.\").\r\n\r\n3.   The other case relied on by the Highway Department, Truesdale v. South Carolina Highway Dep't, 264 S.C. 221, 213\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 740 (1975), overruled by McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985), is inapplicable to the instant\r\n\r\naction as the Highway Department personnel and equipment in Truesdale were not engaged in road work at the time of the\r\n\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n4. Although assumption of the risk is no longer recognized as a complete defense in a negligence action, it remains a facet of\r\n\r\ncomparative negligence which may be charged to the jury.  Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 565 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"},{"id":"3254","title":"Carolina First Corp. v.

Three  shareholders of Carolina First Corporation\r\n\r\nbrought this action, primarily seeking to recover disproportionate stock bonuses paid to three high\r\n\r\nlevel officers.  The trial court dismissed the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),SCRCP, because the\r\n\r\ncomplaint failed to allege particularized facts to meet or excuse the demand requirements of Rule\r\n\r\n23(b)(1), SCRCP.  We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina First Corporation (\"Carolina First\") is the parent corporation of Carolina First Bank\r\n\r\n(\"Bank\").  Plaintiffs are shareholders (\"Shareholders\") of Carolina First.  Shareholders brought this\r\n\r\nderivative action in accordance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-7-400 (Supp. 1999) seeking rescission of a\r\n\r\nbonus paid to defendants Mack Whittle (President/CEO of the Bank), William Hummers\r\n\r\n(Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Carolina First and the Bank), and Stephen\r\n\r\nPowell (Vice President of Operations of the Bank) (collectively \"Officers\"). The bonuses were in the\r\n\r\nform of stock in Affinity Technology Corporation (\"Affinity\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAffinity is a corporation formed by Edward J. Sebastian to manufacture Automatic Loan Machines. \r\n\r\nAccording to the complaint, Sebastian was the controlling stockholder and founder of Affinity. \r\n\r\nSebastian was also a friend and associate of Whittle.  Whittle served on the board of Affinity in\r\n\r\naddition to his duties at Carolina First and the Bank.  During the time in question, Shareholders\r\n\r\nallege that Sebastian also participated as an ex officio member of the Carolina First Board of\r\n\r\nDirectors, although he had a conflict of interest in doing so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina First and Affinity entered into an agreement by which Carolina First loaned Affinity\r\n\r\n$290,000 and provided \"start-up\" assistance.  In return, Carolina First received stock and warrants\r\n\r\nin Affinity, representing approximately thirty percent of Affinity's then-outstanding stock. \r\n\r\nCarolina First also became one of Affinity's customers, ordering eleven machines.  According to\r\n\r\nShareholders, Carolina First received Federal Reserve Board approval to enter into the transaction\r\n\r\nwith Affinity, but Carolina First was severely restricted in its ability to sell its shares of Affinity\r\n\r\nstock on the open market.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Carolina First Board then awarded the three named officers a bonus of approximately ten\r\n\r\npercent of the Affinity shares owned by Carolina First. According to Shareholders, no restriction\r\n\r\nattached to the shares given as a bonus to the three officers. Whittle received 433,434 shares, and\r\n\r\nHummers and Powell each received 116,600 shares.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt that time, a \"fairness\" letter was written at the Board's request, which valued the shares at $.88\r\n\r\nper share.  The complaint alleges that, unbeknownst to the disinterested members of the Carolina\r\n\r\nFirst Board, Sebastian and Whittle had a plan in place to publicly offer  Affinity stock. The\r\n\r\ncomplaint further alleges that Whittle, Hummers, Sebastian, and Powell knew the value of the\r\n\r\nAffinity stock would be at least $10 to $15 per share once it was traded publicly, and they falsely\r\n\r\nmisled the Board of Directors by failing to disclose this information at the time the Board awarded\r\n\r\nthe bonuses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApproximately ninety days after the bonuses were awarded, Affinity successfully completed its\r\n\r\npublic offering, at an initial public offering price of $13 per share.  The complaint alleges that the\r\n\r\nshares were ultimately traded at a high of $24 per share.  Based upon this range, they allege the\r\n\r\nWhittle bonus had a market value between $5,634,642 and $10,402,160, and the Hummers/Powell\r\n\r\nbonuses had a market value between $1,615,800 and $2,798,400.  These bonuses greatly exceed the\r\n\r\ntotal reported earnings of Carolina First in each of the previous years and are alleged to be\r\n\r\nunreasonable under any view of business judgment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders essentially allege that this bonus scheme was devised as a method of self-dealing at\r\n\r\nthe expense of Carolina First and the Bank.  In this regard, they allege that Sebastian and Whittle\r\n\r\nused the Bank's relationship with Affinity to \"hype\" the Affinity stock at the time of the initial\r\n\r\noffering, knowing that the values could not be sustained, and knowing that Carolina First could\r\n\r\nnot profit by selling its shares because of the Federal Reserve Board restrictions. (1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders allege that Whittle, Powell, and Sebastian have a long-time personal and business\r\n\r\nrelationship which they have used to facilitate their self-dealing at the expense of Carolina First\r\n\r\nand the Bank. Prior to the Affinity deal, Sebastian was the owner of two corporations which\r\n\r\ncontrolled Republic Bank. In 1993 and 1994, Carolina First Bank purchased various Republic Bank\r\n\r\nbranches, credit card accounts and, ultimately, its assets and liabilities.  They allege that these\r\n\r\ntransactions were not financially sound and that Sebastian participated in them as a \"de facto\"\r\n\r\nmember of the Carolina First Board during 1994 and 1995, before becoming an appointed member\r\n\r\nin 1996.  They further allege that Whittle, Hummers, Powell, and Sebastian improperly\r\n\r\nmanipulated the Bank's earnings reports to facilitate their self-dealing, using improper accounting\r\n\r\npractices. These improper accounting methods later required a \"write down\" of assets, which\r\n\r\nWhittle and Hummers then falsely painted to the disinterested majority of the Board in a positive\r\n\r\nlight as a \"restructuring.\"  According to Shareholders, Whittle falsely and fraudulently represented\r\n\r\nto the Board that the accounting principles which required the \"write down\" were new, although\r\n\r\nthey had always been the proper accounting principles to employ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 25, 1997, Shareholders filed their Third Amended Complaint (2) alleging the Affinity\r\n\r\nstock bonus resulted in gross over-compensation, the Officers manipulated the corporation's\r\n\r\nearnings reports, and the Officers engaged in abusive or unfair personnel practices.  Shareholders\r\n\r\nalleged that the Board refused to bring any action to recover funds to which the bank was entitled\r\n\r\nand that any further efforts to have the Board do so would be futile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarolina First and the other defendants (3) moved to dismiss the complaint for, among other things,\r\n\r\nfailure to state a cause of action under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.  Specifically, they asserted that the\r\n\r\nThird Amended Complaint failed to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 23(b), SCRCP.  The\r\n\r\ntrial court granted the motions and dismissed the action.  The court ruled Shareholders failed to\r\n\r\nallege particularized facts showing (1) that they complied with the demand requirements of Rule\r\n\r\n23(b)(1), SCRCP, and that the demand thereafter was wrongfully refused, or (2) that there were\r\n\r\nadequate grounds to excuse compliance with the demand requirement.  The trial court denied\r\n\r\nShareholders' motions to amend the complaint a fourth and fifth time (4) and subsequently denied\r\n\r\nShareholders' motion for reconsideration.  Shareholders appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Demand Refused\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders challenge the trial court's ruling that they failed to allege particularized facts to\r\n\r\nestablish a pre-suit demand upon the directors of Carolina First.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 23(b)(1) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(b)(1)  Derivative Actions by Shareholders.  In a derivative action brought by one or more\r\n\r\nshareholders or members to enforce a right of a corporation or of an unincorporated association, the\r\n\r\ncorporation or association having failed to enforce a right which may properly be asserted by it, the\r\n\r\ncomplaint shall be verified and shall allege that the plaintiff was a shareholder or member at the\r\n\r\ntime of the transaction of which he complains or that his share or membership thereafter devolved\r\n\r\non him by operation of law.  The complaint shall also allege with particularity the efforts, if any,\r\n\r\nmade by the plaintiff to obtain the action he desires from the directors or comparable authority\r\n\r\nand, if necessary, from the shareholders or members, and the reasons for his failure to obtain the\r\n\r\naction or for not making the effort.  The derivative action may not be maintained if it appears that\r\n\r\nthe plaintiff does not fairly and adequately represent the interests of the shareholders or members\r\n\r\nsimilarly situated in enforcing the right of the corporation or association.  The action shall not be\r\n\r\ndismissed or compromised without the approval of the court and notice of the proposed dismissal or\r\n\r\ncompromise shall be given to shareholders or members in such manner as the court directs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 23(b)(1), SCRCP (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court found Shareholders failed to meet the pleading requirements of Rule 23 in four\r\n\r\nrespects:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) the plaintiffs fail[ed] to allege with sufficient particularity a pre-suit demand to the board of\r\n\r\ndirectors of Carolina First Corporation; (2)&nbsp;plaintiffs in fact did not make any such demand, except\r\n\r\nas to one aspect of this lawsuit; (3) as to the one pre-suit demand that the plaintiffs actually did\r\n\r\nmake (but failed to allege properly) and that the Board of Directors refused, the plaintiffs fail[ed] to\r\n\r\nallege specific facts to support the conclusion that the board's refusal of the demand was wrongful;\r\n\r\nand (4)&nbsp;the plaintiffs fail[ed] to allege a proper basis to excuse compliance with the demand\r\n\r\nrequirement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina, the authority to direct the business and affairs of a corporation is delegated to a\r\n\r\nboard of directors, not the shareholders. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-8-101 (1990).  Rule 23(b)(1)\r\n\r\nadopts the federal derivative suit provision. (5)\r\nSee Rule 23(b)(1) Reporter's Note, SCRCP. The\r\n\r\nfederal rule was designed to protect against two kinds of potential abuse stemming from derivative\r\n\r\nactions. See 5 James Wm. Moore et al.,\r\nMoore's Federal Practice, Â¶ 23.1.02[4] (3d ed. 2000).  \"First,\r\n\r\nRule 23.1 seeks to prevent the unrestrained use of derivative actions by minority shareholders,\r\n\r\nwhich would undermine the basic principle of corporate governance that the decisions of the\r\n\r\ncorporation should be made by its management or, in certain situations, by an affirmative vote of a\r\n\r\nmajority of the shareholders. Id. (citing\r\nDaily Income Fund, Inc. v. Fox, 464 U.S. 523, 530 (1984)). \r\n\r\nThe second reason, not applicable to the states, is to prevent collusive creation of diversity\r\n\r\njurisdiction. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe protective principles underlying the pleading requirements of Rule 23 (b)(1) have long been\r\n\r\nrecognized as important gatekeepers in South Carolina corporate jurisprudence.  In\r\nLatimer v.\r\n\r\nRichmond &amp; D.R. Co., 39 S.C. 44, 51-52, 17 S.E. 258, 260-61 (1893), our supreme court recognized\r\n\r\nthat equity will afford relief in a proper case to shareholders bringing an action on behalf of a\r\n\r\ncorporation against the directors, notwithstanding the general rule that only the corporation may\r\n\r\npursue redress of a wrong committed against it. However, quoting extensively from\r\nHawes v.\r\n\r\nOakland, 104 U.S. 450 (1881), the court noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[I]t is equally important that, before the shareholder is permitted, in his own name, to institute\r\n\r\nand conduct a litigation which usually belongs to the corporation, he should show to the\r\n\r\nsatisfaction of the court that he has exhausted all the means within his reach to obtain, within the\r\n\r\ncorporation itself, the redress of his grievances, or action in conformity to his wishes.  He must\r\n\r\nmake an earnest, not a simulated, effort with the managing body of the corporation, to induce\r\n\r\nremedial action on their part, and this must be made apparent to the court. . . . The efforts to\r\n\r\ninduce such action as    complainant desires on the part of the directors, and of the shareholders,\r\n\r\nwhen that is necessary, and the cause of failure in these efforts, should be stated with\r\n\r\nparticularity. . . . (6)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLatimer, 39 S.C. at\r\n52-53, 17 S.E. at 261 (quoting Hawes v. Oakland, 104 U.S. 450, 460-61 (1881)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese same principles are recognized as underlying Rule 23.\r\nSee  RCM Sec. Fund, Inc. v. Stanton,\r\n\r\n928 F.2d 1318, 1326 (2d Cir. 1991) (\"Whether a corporation should bring a lawsuit is a business\r\n\r\ndecision, and the directors are, under the laws of every state, responsible for the conduct of the\r\n\r\ncorporation's business, including the decision to litigate.\" (citations omitted));\r\nHoule v. Low, 556\r\n\r\nN.E.2d 51, 57 (Mass. 1990) (\"Our cases have long recognized that the question whether a\r\n\r\ncorporation should pursue a given lawsuit involves factors other than the merits of the claim.  It is\r\n\r\noften a question of business policy.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA derivative action is, in essence, a challenge to a board's managerial authority.  Derivative actions\r\n\r\nhave been characterized as a remedy of last resort because these actions impinge on the inherent\r\n\r\nrole of corporate management to conduct the affairs of the corporation, including the power to bring\r\n\r\nsuit. Renfro v. FDIC, 773 F.2d 657, 658 (5th Cir. 1985).  For this reason, the law imposes certain\r\n\r\nprerequisites on a stockholder's right to sue derivatively. Kaplan v. Peat, Marwick, Mitchell &amp; Co.,\r\n\r\n540 A.2d 726, 730 (Del. 1988).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe demand requirement of Rule 23 balances a shareholder's right to assert a derivative claim\r\n\r\nagainst a board's duty to decide whether to invest the resources of the corporation in pursuit of the\r\n\r\nshareholder's claim of a corporate wrong. Blasband v. Rales, 971 F.2d 1034, 1048 (3d Cir. 1992)\r\n\r\n(applying Delaware corporate law); see also  \r\nSpiegel v. Buntrock, 571 A.2d 767, 775-76 (Del. 1990)\r\n\r\n(stating that \"stockholders who . . . make a demand which is refused, subject the board's decision to\r\n\r\njudicial review according to the traditional business judgment rule\" and that once the shareholder\r\n\r\nmakes a demand, the shareholder can no longer argue demand is excused).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRule 23 is a departure from the more liberal pleading requirements of Rule 8, SCRCP, in that it\r\n\r\nrequires particularized allegations. Under Rule 23, \"the shareholder must either make a demand\r\n\r\nor plead with particularity the exceptional circumstances that demonstrate why a demand would\r\n\r\nbe futile, i.e., why the Board of Directors should not be allowed to decide whether to institute\r\n\r\nlitigation.\" Allison ex rel. General Motors Corp. v. General Motors Corp., 604 F. Supp. 1106, 1112\r\n\r\n(D. Del. 1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Demand is required in order to assure compliance with the most fundamental principle of\r\n\r\ncorporate governance - directors are answerable to the shareholders and are charged with the duty\r\n\r\nand responsibility to manage all aspects of corporate affairs.\" Id. at 1117.  As the United States\r\n\r\nSupreme Court explained, \"The purpose of the demand requirement is to 'affor[d] the directors an\r\n\r\nopportunity to exercise their reasonable business judgment and waive a legal right vested in the\r\n\r\ncorporation in the belief that its best interests will be promoted by not insisting on such right.'\"\r\nKamen, 500 U.S. at 96 (alteration in original) (quoting\r\nDaily Income Fund, Inc., 464 U.S. at 533\r\n). \r\n\r\n\"Thus, the demand requirement implements 'the basic principle of corporate governance that the\r\n\r\ndecisions of a corporation -  including the decision to initiate litigation - should be made by the\r\n\r\nboard of directors or the majority of shareholders.'\" Kamen, 500 U.S. at 101 (quoting\r\nDaily Income\r\n\r\nFund, Inc., 464 U.S. at 530); see also \r\nSpiegel, 571 A.2d at 773 (\"The purpose of pre-suit demand is\r\n\r\nto assure that the stockholder affords the corporation the opportunity to address an alleged wrong\r\n\r\nwithout litigation, to decide whether to invest the resources of the corporation in litigation, and to\r\n\r\ncontrol any litigation which does occur.\").  A demand alerts the board so that it may take the\r\n\r\ncorrective action, if any, which it deems necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith these general principles in mind, we now consider the Third Amended Complaint, also\r\n\r\nkeeping in mind that the sufficiency of the pleading in meeting the requirements of Rule 23 must\r\n\r\nbe based solely upon the allegations contained within it. McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 633,\r\n\r\n494 S.E.2d 431, 433 (Ct. App. 1997).  As stated, Shareholders' allegations focused on three alleged\r\n\r\nabuses: (1) gross over-compensation through the Affinity stock bonuses; (2) manipulation of the\r\n\r\ncompany's reports; and (3) abusive or unfair personnel practices.  Although the Third Amended\r\n\r\nComplaint asserts that the plaintiffs made pre-suit demands upon the Board of Directors, it does\r\n\r\nnot allege what Shareholders demanded and what the Board rejected.  As the trial court noted:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pleading alleges merely that the plaintiffs demanded \"certain information\" and \"certain\r\n\r\nactions\"; that they made a \"supplemental demand\"; that after suit was filed they made \"proposals .\r\n\r\n. . to resolve any dispute . . . and to dismiss this litigation\"; that in 1991 another shareholder (not a\r\n\r\nparty here) demanded that the officers and directors \"exercise their fiduciary duty on a number of\r\n\r\nissues\"; and that another attorney representing other shareholders (not parties here) asked for\r\n\r\n\"certain information regarding the Affinity transaction\". . . . The pleading also alleges that \"[t]he\r\n\r\nBank responded to certain demands and requests for information but declined to respond to more\r\n\r\npertinent requests for information. . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"At a minimum, a demand must identify the alleged wrongdoers, describe the factual basis of the\r\n\r\nwrongful acts and the harm caused to the corporation, and request remedial relief.\"\r\nAllison, 604 F.\r\n\r\nSupp. at 1117; see also  Latimer, 39 S.C. at 53, 17 S.E. at  261 (\"The efforts to induce such action as\r\n\r\ncomplainant desires on the part of the directors, and of the shareholders, when that is necessary,\r\n\r\nand the cause of failure in these efforts, should be stated with particularity.\" (quoting\r\nHawes, 104\r\n\r\nU.S. at 461)).  Such a pre-suit demand must be alleged, not in a conclusory fashion, but through\r\n\r\nparticularized allegations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the trial court noted, while it appears that the plaintiffs made a pre-suit demand of some sort,\r\n\r\nthe Third Amended Complaint does not disclose the nature of the demand.  To comply with this\r\n\r\nrule, Shareholders' pleading must set forth particularized allegations of the efforts made to\r\n\r\ndemand that the board take the action that Shareholders now seek to compel; that is, rescission of\r\n\r\nthe Affinity stock bonus, correction of record keeping and reporting of earnings, and alteration of \r\n\r\npersonnel management.  The particularized allegations must support an earnest, and not a\r\n\r\nsimulated, effort with the managing body of the corporation to induce remedial action on their part.\r\nSee  Latimer, 39 S.C. at 52-53, 17 S.E.2d at 261.  The Third Amended Complaint does not do this. \r\n\r\nTherefore, we agree with the trial court's ruling that Shareholders failed to meet the pleading\r\n\r\nrequirements of Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders advance a further argument in support of their contention that a proper demand was\r\n\r\nmade and was unreasonably refused by the Board.  The trial court dismissed the Third Amended\r\n\r\nComplaint, finding no particularized allegations of a pre-suit demand.  In its order, the court\r\n\r\nobserved that Shareholders submitted copies of letters purporting to meet the pre-suit demand\r\n\r\nrequirement, at least as to the bonus issue, in response to the motion to dismiss.   Shareholders\r\n\r\nalso attached the same letters to their proposed Fifth Amended Complaint. The court then\r\n\r\ndiscussed the merits of the letters, concluding that, even if considered, they did not meet the\r\n\r\npleading requirements of Rule 23. On appeal, Shareholders argue this, too, was error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContrary to this assertion, we conclude the letters were not before the court and could not have\r\n\r\nbeen considered.  The trial court ruled that the submission outside of the Third Amended\r\n\r\nComplaint was improper, correctly concluding that the sufficiency of the allegations in the Third\r\n\r\nAmended Complaint of a pre-suit demand must be determined from the four corners of the\r\n\r\npleading. McCormick, 328 S.C. at 633, 494 S.E.2d at 433. (7)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders have not appealed this ruling, nor have they appealed the refusal to allow further\r\n\r\namendment to the Third Amended Complaint.  An unappealed ruling is the law of the case.\r\nLarimore v. Carolina Power &amp; Light, 340 S.C. 438, 445, 531 S.E.2d 535, 539 (Ct. App. 2000) (citing\r\nTown of Mt. Pleasant v. Jones, 335 S.C. 295, 516 S.E.2d 468 (Ct. App.1999) (stating that an\r\n\r\nunappealed ruling becomes the law of the case, and the appellate court must assume the ruling\r\n\r\nwas correct)).  Therefore, evidence of  a demand outside of the well pleaded facts contained in the\r\n\r\nThird Amended Complaint should not have been considered by the trial court and is not properly\r\n\r\nbefore us on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Demand Excused\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court also rejected Shareholders' contention that the Third Amended Complaint\r\n\r\nestablished a basis for excusing demand.  Applying Delaware law, the court ruled that once a\r\n\r\ndemand is made, the concept of demand futility is no longer applicable.  Rather, one must show the\r\n\r\ndemand was wrongfully rejected by the board.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Spiegel v. Buntrock, the Delaware Supreme Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[A] stockholder who asserts a derivative claim cannot stand neutral, in effect, with respect to the\r\n\r\nboard of directors' ability to respond to a request to take legal action, by simultaneously making a\r\n\r\ndemand for such action and continuing to argue that demand is excused.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy making a demand, a stockholder tacitly acknowledges the absence of facts to support a finding\r\n\r\nof futility.  Thus, when a demand is made, the question of whether demand was excused is moot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n571 A.2d  at 775 (emphasis added) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying upon Spiegel, the trial court ruled that Shareholders could no longer raise the question of\r\n\r\ndemand futility.  Shareholders argue this was error, as the better rule encourages demand by\r\n\r\nallowing a litigant to argue both demand-refusal and demand-futility. See \r\nBach v. Nat'l W. Life\r\n\r\nIns. Co., 810 F.2d 509, 513 (5th Cir. 1987); Joy v. North, 692 F.2d 880, 888 n.7 (2d Cir. 1982);\r\nAlford v. Shaw, 324 S.E.2d 878, 883 n.2 (N.C. Ct. App. 1985),\r\nmodified and aff'd on other grounds,\r\n\r\n358 S.E.2d 323 (N.C. 1987).  We agree with Shareholders on this point because such a bright-line\r\n\r\nrule has no logical basis.  In our opinion, this rule is too restrictive. It defeats the underlying\r\n\r\npurpose of the demand requirement by subjecting a dissident shareholder in a close case to an\r\n\r\narbitrary penalty for attempting to resolve the controversy within the corporate hierarchy. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we perceive no reciprocal benefit  gained by imposing such a harsh rule.  Therefore,\r\n\r\nabsent explicit instructions from our supreme court to the contrary, we decline to adopt the\r\n\r\nDelaware rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, as an alternative basis for its conclusion, the trial court reviewed the allegations urged in\r\n\r\nsupport of the claim of demand-futility and found that Shareholders had failed to allege\r\n\r\nparticularized facts which would excuse demand.  We find no abuse of discretion in this ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first address Shareholders' argument that South Carolina follows a \"lenient standard\" in\r\n\r\nexcusing the demand requirement.  Shareholders base this premise upon language contained in\r\nGrant v. Gosnell, in which our supreme court recognized that \"[i]n evaluating the 'excuse'\r\n\r\nallegations in a derivative suit, '[c]ourts have generally been lenient in excusing demand.'\"\r\n266 S.C.\r\n\r\n372, 376, 223 S.E.2d 413, 415 (1976) (quoting DeHaas v. Empire Petroleum, 435 F.2d 1223, 1228\r\n\r\n(10th Cir. 1970)).  We conclude Shareholders have misconstrued this statement.  As stated in\r\nKaufman v. Kansas Gas and Elec. Co.,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis standard does not mean a court will be lenient in finding there are sufficient facts pled to\r\n\r\nestablish futility.  Rather, it means that if the court finds sufficient facts are pled, then it will be\r\n\r\nlenient in excusing demand-a matter within its discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n634 F. Supp. 573, 1578 (D. Kan. 1986); see also \r\nLatimer, 39 S.C. at 54, 17 S.E. at 261 (\"[W]hen one\r\n\r\nor more stockholders undertake to bring an action like this, they should be rigidly required to state\r\n\r\nsuch a case as falls within one of the exceptions to such rule\").  Thus, Shareholders still had the\r\n\r\nburden of alleging particularized facts to support the assertion that demand would have been\r\n\r\nfutile.  The trial judge found that they did not meet this requirement, and we will only overturn\r\n\r\nthat decision for an abuse of discretion. See \r\nGrant, 266 S.C. at 375, 223 S.E.2d at 414 (stating that\r\n\r\nissue of whether the failure to seek redress within the corporation is excusable is a factual\r\n\r\nquestion, the resolution of which by the lower court should be affirmed unless unsupported by the\r\n\r\nevidence or influenced by error of law). Contrary to Shareholders' assertion, we agree with the trial\r\n\r\ncourt that, \"[b]ecause of the important policies behind this rule, 'the demand requirement of [Rule\r\n\r\n23] should be rigorously enforced.'\" Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 784 (3d Cir. 1982) (quoting\r\nCramer v. Gen Tel. &amp; Elec. Corp., 582 F.2d 259, 275 (3d Cir. 1978)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reasons advanced as a basis for claiming futility are as follows: (1) the board is not\r\n\r\ndisinterested; (2) the board is controlled by Whittle and Hummer; (3) almost all board members are\r\n\r\nnamed as defendants, and cannot be expected to pursue litigation by the corporation to set aside\r\n\r\ntheir own prior action or to collect damages; and (4) the board was responsible for the original\r\n\r\nactions complained of, thereby casting a reasonable doubt as to the board's business judgment or\r\n\r\nits ability to act in the best interest of the corporation.  Each of these has been uniformly rejected\r\n\r\nas a basis for establishing demand  futility by other courts which have considered them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to the first allegation, it is generally recognized that the \"interest\" which is required to establish\r\n\r\nfutility is more than mere participation in the original decision. Kaufman, 634 F. Supp. at 1579;\r\nsee  Lewis ex rel Nat'l Semiconductor Corp. v. Sporck, 612 F. Supp. 1316, 1322 (N.D. Cal. 1985)\r\n\r\n(stating that \"whether an act [is] 'completely undirected to a corporate purpose'\" raising a\r\n\r\npresumption of bias \"depends on whether or not the act benefitted the directors personally at the\r\n\r\nexpense of the corporation.\") (quoting In re Kauffman Mut. Fund Actions, 479 F.2d 257, 265 (1st\r\n\r\nCir. 1973)); Vanderbilt v. Geo-Energy Ltd., 590 F. Supp. 999, 1002 (E.D. Pa. 1984) (finding demand\r\n\r\nexcused because the complaint alleged that a majority of board members participated in  self-dealing transactions);\r\nWeiss v. Temporary Inv. Fund, Inc., 516 F. Supp. 665, 672 (D. Del. 1981)\r\n\r\n(stating that interested director is one who engaged in self-dealing or \"otherwise stood to obtain\r\n\r\nany personal advantage\"), aff'd, 692 F.2d 928 (3d Cir.), vacated on other grounds by 465 U.S. 1001\r\n\r\n(1984); Pogostin v. Rice, 480 A.2d 619, 624 (Del. 1984) (stating that \"[d]irectorial interest exists\r\n\r\nwhenever divided loyalties are present, or a director either has received, or is entitled to receive, a\r\n\r\npersonal financial benefit from the challenged transaction which is not equally shared by the\r\n\r\nstockholders\"); see also  Dockside Ass'n v. Detyens, 294 S.C. 86, 87, 362 S.E.2d 874,875 (1987)\r\n\r\n(holding that \"the business judgment rule precludes judicial review of actions taken by a corporate\r\n\r\ngoverning board absent a showing of a lack of good faith, fraud, self-dealing or unconscionable\r\n\r\nconduct\"); Stahn v. Catawba Mills, 53 S.C. 519, 519, 31 S.E. 498, 498-99 (1898) (stating that\r\n\r\n\"refusal need not be  alleged, if it be shown that the directors or managing board are themselves\r\n\r\nthe wrong-doers in some alleged breach of trust or fraudulent misappropriation of the corporate\r\n\r\nproperty, and have control of a majority of the stock, so as to control corporate action\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShareholders do not allege that any member of the Board other than Whittle and Sebastian had\r\n\r\nany improper motive or participated in any self-dealing or fraud.  Taking Shareholders' allegations\r\n\r\nas true, the vast majority of the directors received nothing of value from the Affinity stock transfer,\r\n\r\nreceived no improper bonus, and were not otherwise involved in self-dealing or fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second assertion, that Whittle and Hummers controlled the board, is a conclusory allegation,\r\n\r\nand there are no particularized facts in support of this conclusion.  This type of bald assertion,\r\n\r\nabsent particularized facts to support it, is insufficient to meet Rule 23's pleading requirements.\r\nSee  Aronson v. Lewis, 473 A.2d 805, 815 (Del. 1984) (stating that \"[t]here must be coupled with the\r\n\r\nallegation of control such facts as would demonstrate that through personal or other relationships\r\n\r\nthe directors are beholden to the controlling person\"); cf.\r\nStahn, 53 S.C. at 529-30, 31 S.E. at 499\r\n\r\n(holding complaint stated basis for excusing demand where it alleged four of seven members of\r\n\r\nboard were involved in self-dealing, and where self-dealing board member appointed two other\r\n\r\n\"dummy\" directors to board by purchasing stock in their name).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, Shareholders argue that demand is futile because the majority of the board members are\r\n\r\nnamed as defendants and cannot be expected to sue themselves.  Again, this reasoning has been\r\n\r\nuniformly rejected by courts which have considered the argument. See \r\nLewis v. Graves, 701 F.2d\r\n\r\n245, 248-49 (2d Cir. 1983); Lewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d 779, 785 (3d Cir. 1982);\r\nHeit v. Baird, 567\r\n\r\nF.2d 1157, 1162 (1st Cir. 1977); Kaufman, 634 F. Supp. at 1580;\r\nAllison, 604 F. Supp. at 1114-15. \r\n\r\nAs stated in Kaufman, \"This argument lacks logic.  If the Court were to accept it, derivative\r\n\r\nplaintiffs could readily circumvent [Rule 23's] demand requirements simply by naming all directors\r\n\r\nin the complaint.\" 634 F. Supp. at 1580.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, Shareholders assert that the board was involved in the original action of which they\r\n\r\ncomplain, and, therefore, any further demand would be futile.  We join with the other jurisdictions\r\n\r\nthat have considered and rejected this argument as a basis, standing alone, for excusing demand.\r\nSee  Lewis v. Graves, 701 F.2d at 248;\r\nLewis v. Curtis, 671 F.2d at 785;\r\nCottle v. Hilton Hotels\r\n\r\nCorp., 635 F. Supp. 1094, 1098 (N.D. Ill. 1986); Aronson, 473 A.2d at 817.  As the Court noted in\r\nCottle, \"If this were the only prerequisite to excusing demand, the demand requirement would be\r\n\r\neffectively repealed since, by definition, the directors have a hand in all corporate transactions of\r\n\r\nany consequence.\" 635 F. Supp at 1098.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, Shareholders argue that their allegations create a reasonable doubt that the challenged\r\n\r\ntransactions result from the exercise of valid business judgment and that this fact excuses demand. \r\n\r\nAlthough Shareholders oppose the trial court's application of Delaware law in the analysis of other\r\n\r\nissues on appeal, by virtue of its perceived protection of the corporation and its directors, they urge\r\n\r\nthat, if Delaware law is to be applied, then this test is appropriate.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder Delaware law, demand may be excused even if the threshold presumptions of director\r\n\r\ndisinterest or independence are not rebutted by well-pleaded facts, if the complaint pleads\r\n\r\nparticularized facts sufficient to create a reasonable doubt that the challenged transaction was the\r\n\r\nproduct of a valid exercise of business judgment.  See \r\nLevine v. Smith, 591 A.2d 194, 206 (Del.\r\n\r\n1991).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe first note that this second prong of the Delaware test is considered a narrow exception.  See\r\n\r\n Cottle, 635 F. Supp. at 1099 (noting that \"in rare cases a transaction may be so egregious on its\r\n\r\nface that board approval cannot meet the test of business judgment, and a substantial likelihood of\r\n\r\ndirector liability therefore exists.\") (quoting Aronson, 473 A.2d at 815). It is premised upon the\r\n\r\nnotion that when the Board makes a decision which is so egregious as to give rise to a reasonable\r\n\r\ndoubt that it was the product of a valid exercise of business judgment, it may be inferred that the\r\n\r\nBoard is incapable of exercising its power and authority to pursue the derivative claims directly.\r\nLevine, 591 A.2d at 205.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   However, the facts as alleged by Shareholders negate this inference.  Shareholders allege that\r\n\r\nWhittle, Hummers, Powell, and Sebastian misled the other members of the Board by undervaluing\r\n\r\nthe Affinity stock at the time of acquisition, and by failing to divulge the proposed public offering of\r\n\r\nAffinity stock.  They allege that these self-dealing officers and directors intentionally provided false\r\n\r\ninformation to the majority of the Board and withheld information.  However, under their version\r\n\r\nof the facts, the market value of the shares was rapidly established at a higher value through the\r\n\r\npublic offering following the allegedly improper bonus.  Shareholders allege in the complaint that\r\n\r\n\"On April 25, 1996, some 90 days after making the gift/bonus of the Affinity stock, the public\r\n\r\noffering, which had been forthcoming and which was well known by all observant and reasonably\r\n\r\nastute people to take place was publicly offered at the initial opening price of $13 per share.\" \r\n\r\nConsequently, under shareholder's version of the facts, the original decision to give the Affinity\r\n\r\nstock bonuses was based upon incorrect and incomplete information by disinterested members of\r\n\r\nthe Board.  Once the true information became public knowledge, and therefore available, we see no\r\n\r\nbasis to infer that the disinterested majority of the Board was incapable of exercising valid\r\n\r\nbusiness judgment to rescind the transaction, if the Board determined it to be in the best interest\r\n\r\nof the corporation to do so.  Consequently, we find this argument to be without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the above reasons, we find no abuse of discretion in the trial court's ruling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Refusal of Limited Discovery During Pendency of Motion to Dismiss\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLastly, Shareholders contend the trial court erred by refusing discovery prior to hearing the\r\n\r\nMotions to Dismiss. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Shareholders initiated this action, the defendants moved for an order staying discovery\r\n\r\npending a ruling on the motions to dismiss.  However, the trial court never issued an order ruling\r\n\r\non the motions to stay discovery, and Shareholders acknowledge this point on appeal.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThey argue the trial court's scheduling order of February 1997 confirmed that discovery would be\r\n\r\naddressed after any ruling on a motion to dismiss.  The scheduling order, dated January 31, 1997,\r\n\r\ninitially scheduled argument on the motions to dismiss for May 1997.  The order provided that \"[i]f\r\n\r\nthe motions are denied, the Court will enter another scheduling order to address discovery,\r\n\r\nmotions for summary judgment, and motions relating to the conduct of trial . . . .\" It is clear from\r\n\r\nthis language that the scheduling order made only a general  reference to procedural matters and\r\n\r\nwas not a ruling on the motion to stay discovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that the court never ruled on the stay is also clearly reflected in  correspondence by and\r\n\r\nbetween counsel.  On August 25, 1997, opposing counsel informed the trial court that Shareholders'\r\n\r\nattorneys had \"graciously agreed not to pursue discovery until you have ruled on the motion to\r\n\r\nstay.\"  Finally, Shareholders' counsel conceded as much in a letter to a third party on September 8,\r\n\r\n1997, stating \"[i]t is true that Plaintiffs' counsel and [opposing counsel] have agreed to stay\r\n\r\ndiscovery proceedings pending Judge Floyd's ruling on Carolina First's Motion to Stay Discovery.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the above, it is clear that a ruling on the motion to stay discovery was never issued.  No\r\n\r\nsuch order is before us on appeal, and there is no issue for us to consider.  SSI Med. Servs., Inc. v.\r\n\r\nCox, 301 S.C. 493, 499, 392 S.E.2d 789, 793 (1990) (issue must have been raised to and ruled upon\r\n\r\nby the court below to be considered for appellate review).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the trial court is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and CONNOR, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1. According to the complaint, the Affinity shares were selling at $7 per share at the time of suit.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n Defendants responded to the initial complaint and subsequent amendments by filing a motion to dismiss in each\r\n\r\ninstance, but agreed to allow Shareholders the opportunity to amend a third and final time. \r\n\r\n3.\r\n Shareholders named ten other members of Carolina First's Board of Directors as defendants, although there is no\r\n\r\nallegation that they improperly received anything of value, or committed any acts of self-dealing or fraud.  In\r\n\r\naddition, they identified seven other members of the Board who were not named as defendants and are not alleged\r\n\r\nto have participated in any self-dealing or fraud. \r\n\r\n4.\r\n Shareholders have not appealed this ruling.\r\n\r\n5.  The reporter's notes to Rule 23(b)(1), SCRCP, state that the language of the rule is that of Federal Rule of Civil\r\n\r\nProcedure 23.1.  The comments to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-7-400 note that \"Bringing an additional set of litigation rules\r\n\r\ninto the South Carolina Business Corporation Act on top of Rule 23 (b)(1) was deemed inadvisable, particularly since\r\n\r\ncourts called on to interpret the new South Carolina rule have a large body of federal precedent from which to draw.\" \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-7-400 South Carolina Reporters' Comments (1990). This is an illusory benefit, however, because\r\n\r\nthe scope of demand requirement is an issue of substantive law, and the federal courts look to state law to fashion a\r\n\r\nrule of decision, even in federal question cases. Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 U.S. 90, 98-99 (1991).  \r\n\r\n6.  The justification for the rule is amply stated by the court as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis doctrine, thus abundantly supported by authority, is also well founded in reason.  For while it may be very true\r\n\r\nthat a court of equity will and ought to permit a stockholder to bring an action for the redress or prevention of a\r\n\r\nwrong done or threatened to the corporate property, in order to prevent a failure of justice, in certain well-defined\r\n\r\nexceptional cases, yet it is manifest that to allow a single stockholder, or one or more of them, to force a corporation\r\n\r\nor its managing agents into a litigation, which the majority of the body or its officers may think unwise or\r\n\r\nunnecessary, would place it in the power of a single stockholder who may be dissatisfied with the management of the\r\n\r\nbusiness of the corporation to involve the corporation in expensive litigation, which might be destructive to the\r\n\r\ninterests of such corporation, and would permit a single discontented stockholder to force the majority, who have the\r\n\r\nright to control, to adopt his views of policy, or incur the expense and hazards of a lawsuit.  The business of a\r\n\r\ncorporation must, necessarily, be committed to the management of its officers or agents, by whatever name they\r\n\r\nmay be called, and as it would be unreasonable to expect that their views of the proper policy to be adopted in such\r\n\r\nmanagement can always command the approval of every individual stockholder, it is very manifest that if one or\r\n\r\nmore of the dissatisfied stockholders should be permitted to precipitate the corporation into litigation, whenever the\r\n\r\npolicy of the managing board does not meet with their approval, it would be impossible to conduct the affairs of a\r\n\r\ncorporation with any success.  It seems to us, therefore, that there is good reason for the general rule laid down\r\n\r\nabove, and that when one or more stockholders undertake to bring an action like this, they should be rigidly\r\n\r\nrequired to state such a case as falls within one of the exceptions to such rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLatimer, 39 S.C. at 53-54, 17 S.E. at 261 (emphasis added); see also \r\nThompson v.

His conviction on these charges led to two consecutive life\r\n\r\nsentences and a consecutive twenty-year sentence.  Covington argues the trial court erred in\r\n\r\ndenying his new trial motion alleging two jurors perjured themselves during voir dire and injected\r\n\r\nextraneous information into jury deliberation, affecting the verdict.  We agree with the trial court\r\n\r\nthat Covington failed to meet his burden of proving the alleged misconduct occurred and affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis case arises from the shooting deaths of Covington's estranged wife and her nineteen-year-old\r\n\r\nniece.  Covington's mother-in-law was also shot, but survived and, along with another witness,\r\n\r\nidentified Covington as the perpetrator.  At his November 1993 trial, Covington offered an alibi\r\n\r\nand asserted the defense of mistaken identity.  The jury, however, found him guilty as charged. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral months after the verdict, juror Butler came to the office of Covington's trial counsel and\r\n\r\ntold him some of the jurors knew Covington before the trial and imparted to the others prejudicial\r\n\r\ninformation about Covington and his violent past with his wife.  Butler signed an affidavit in which\r\n\r\nshe contended jurors Strong and Dismal shared their prior knowledge of Covington with the jury. \r\n\r\nThe affidavit states Strong claimed he knew Covington and repeatedly told the other jurors during\r\n\r\ndeliberations \"that knowing Larry the way he did, it was just like him to do a killing like this.\" \r\n\r\nDismal \"totally agreed\" with Strong and stated she knew Covington had battered his wife, had\r\n\r\npreviously been under restraining orders to stay away from her, and had been arrested on a\r\n\r\nnumber of warrants for beating her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter speaking with Butler, Covington's counsel contacted several other jurors.  Juror Coates also\r\n\r\ngave an affidavit claiming most of the African American jurors had prior knowledge of Covington's\r\n\r\nmarital problems and several maintained they knew he \"had been bad and in trouble before.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these two affidavits, Covington made a motion for a new trial in September 1994\r\n\r\nafter losing on direct appeal.  The trial court denied the motion on the ground the affidavits were\r\n\r\nincompetent evidence to impeach the verdict.  The supreme court reversed, concluding the\r\n\r\naffidavits were competent evidence and remanded for an evidentiary hearing to determine the\r\n\r\nmerits of Covington's claims.  State v. Covington, Op. No. 98-MO-011 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Feb. 9,\r\n\r\n1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon remand, eleven of the jurors in Covington's case were reassembled over several days of\r\n\r\nhearings on the issue of the alleged misconduct.  Each of the jurors present testified concerning the\r\n\r\nallegations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nButler's testimony substantially matched her affidavit.  Butler said she only changed her vote from\r\n\r\nnot guilty to guilty because of Strong's intimidating presence and the information she learned\r\n\r\nabout Covington's past which was not brought out at trial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoates testified it was apparent during deliberations that one or more of the jurors knew\r\n\r\nCovington.  While she could not remember the names of the jurors she alleged engaged in such\r\n\r\nmisconduct, Coates specifically recalled two jurors of the same race and sex as Strong and Dismal. \r\n\r\nAs to what may have been said by Strong or others, Coates remembered \"they . . . were discussing,\r\n\r\nyou know, different things that had happened with [Covington]\" including that he and his wife had\r\n\r\nproblems and that he had beaten her.  Coates testified she had been repeatedly followed and\r\n\r\nsuspected someone was listening to her telephone conversations since the Covington trial. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, she was frightened by a young man at work and said her car had been vandalized. \r\n\r\nShe wondered if those events were related to the trial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJuror Goins testified some jurors discussed Covington's temper and his history with his wife. \r\n\r\nGoins remembered telling the other jurors that such information had nothing to do with the case\r\n\r\nand they should concentrate on the evidence introduced at trial.  He identified Strong as the juror\r\n\r\nwho brought up the information and Dismal as the juror who agreed with Strong's statements. \r\n\r\nWhen asked whether he thought those jurors discussing Covington's past knew him well, Goins\r\n\r\nresponded, \"Well, I reckon they were acquaintances.\"  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nStrong denied knowing Covington or relating to other jurors that he knew him.  He also denied\r\n\r\nmaking the statements attributed to him during deliberations about Covington's past.  Strong\r\n\r\ntestified he could not recall any attempt by a juror to bring in outside information about Covington. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Strong, Dismal denied having any knowledge of Covington before the trial or sharing any\r\n\r\noutside information with the jury.  She also did not remember Strong telling the other jurors about\r\n\r\nevents which were not mentioned at trial.  Dismal could not recall any juror indicating he or she\r\n\r\nknew Covington before the trial.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe remaining jurors testified they did not recall any reference during deliberations of events not\r\n\r\ntestified to at trial.  One of the jurors testified that restraining orders were discussed during\r\n\r\ndeliberations, but that she could not recall whether this was brought out at trial.  When questioned\r\n\r\nabout the discussion of restraining orders, the jury foreman stated such information was revealed\r\n\r\nat trial either through witness testimony or through a comment by one of the attorneys. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court discounted the affidavits and testimony of jurors alleging misconduct primarily\r\n\r\nbecause they failed to report it timely.  Regarding Butler's testimony and affidavit, the trial court\r\n\r\nfound her testimony inconsistent with the jury foreman on his \"position\" as to the alleged\r\n\r\nmisconduct.  The trial court was also concerned that although Butler claimed several jurors\r\n\r\nengaged in misconduct, she only named Strong and Dismal.  Finally, the trial court noted that\r\n\r\nalthough Butler claimed she initially reported the misconduct in January&nbsp;1994, her affidavit was\r\n\r\ndated October 13, 1994, many months thereafter.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to Coates, the trial court found her testimony completely lacking in credibility.  According to the\r\n\r\ntrial court's order, Coates' demeanor, complaints about \"a lot of strange things\" happening to her\r\n\r\nsince the trial, and failure to attend the final day of hearings, although expressly directed to do so,\r\n\r\nundermined her credibility with the court.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reviewing Goins' testimony, the trial court found him less certain than Butler or Coates that\r\n\r\nmisconduct had occurred.  The trial court noted that Goins often qualified his answers with\r\n\r\nexpressions such as \"I think so\" or \"I reckon\" in response to questions about whether some jurors\r\n\r\nseemed to know Covington or whether the jurors had discussed Covington's history with his\r\n\r\nestranged wife. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the jurors who alleged misconduct, the trial court \"was impressed with jurors Strong\r\n\r\nand Dismal as witnesses and [found] their testimony [was] credible.\"  Specifically, the trial court\r\n\r\ncited their demeanor as witnesses, their consistent and adamant denials of knowing Covington or\r\n\r\nparticipating in any wrongdoing, and their candor in revealing the matters discussed during\r\n\r\ndeliberations as evidence of their believability.  Further, the trial court noted their claims were\r\n\r\ncorroborated by the remaining jurors who remembered no discussion of extra-record information\r\n\r\nduring deliberations.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court did find that some of the jurors recalled a restraining order being mentioned, but\r\n\r\nthe record did not reflect that this evidence was brought out at trial.  However, the court attributed\r\n\r\nsuch a \"memory\" either to the defense investigators' post-trial questioning or an unsuccessful\r\n\r\nattempt by the State to introduce an arrest warrant charging the defendant with criminal domestic\r\n\r\nviolence. (1)  As such, the trial court determined that any recollection of a \"restraining order\" did not\r\n\r\nsupport Covington's position that extraneous information was provided to the jury.  Finally, the\r\n\r\ntrial court was persuaded by the lack of evidence that any of the jurors knew Covington before trial\r\n\r\nand failed to disclose that fact on voir dire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn ruling on Covington's motion, the trial court noted that while South Carolina case law clearly\r\n\r\nplaces the burden on the defendant to prove allegations of juror misconduct, neither prior case law\r\n\r\nnor the supreme court's remand opinion identified the applicable burden of proof.  The trial court\r\n\r\nfound Covington not only failed to prove the alleged misconduct by clear and convincing evidence,\r\n\r\nbut also failed to establish the allegations by a preponderance of the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, the denial of a new trial motion will be disturbed only upon a showing of an abuse of\r\n\r\ndiscretion. State v. Smith, 316 S.C. 53, 55, 316 S.E.2d 175, 176 (1993). Where a new trial motion\r\n\r\nis based upon allegations that a juror gave misleading and incomplete answers on voir dire, the\r\n\r\ntrial court's denial of that motion will be affirmed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.\r\nState v.\r\n\r\nKelly, 331 S.C. 132, 145, 502 S.E.2d 99, 106 (1998).  A denial of a new trial based on alleged jury\r\n\r\nmisconduct is also reviewed for an abuse of discretion. Knowlton v. Greenwood Indep. Sch. Dist.,\r\n\r\n957 F.2d 1172, 1177 (5th Cir. 1992).  We thus review the order on appeal to determine whether the\r\n\r\ntrial court abused its discretion in denying Covington's motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"In a criminal prosecution, the conduct of the jurors should be free from all extraneous or improper\r\n\r\ninfluences.\" Kelly, 331 S.C. at 141, 502 S.E.2d at 104;\r\nsee also  State v. Salters, 273 S.C. 501, 504,\r\n\r\n257 S.E.2d 502, 504 (1979) (\"A defendant in a criminal prosecution is constitutionally guaranteed a\r\n\r\nfair trial by an impartial jury; and, in order to fully safeguard this basic protection, it is required\r\n\r\nthat the jury render its verdict free from outside influences.\"(citations omitted)).  Where the\r\n\r\ndefendant seeks a new trial on the ground of impropriety involving the jury, he is required to prove\r\n\r\nboth the alleged misconduct and the resulting prejudice. See \r\nState v. Grovenstein,335 S.C. 347,\r\n\r\n351-52, 517 S.E.2d 216, 218 (1999); Kelly, 331 S.C. at 145-46, 502 S.E.2d at 106;\r\nState v. Smith,\r\n\r\n338 S.C. 66, 72, 525 S.E.2d 263, 266 (Ct. App. 1999) (\"The general test for evaluating alleged juror\r\n\r\nmisconduct is whether there in fact was misconduct and, if so, whether any harm resulted to the\r\n\r\ndefendant as a consequence.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInitially, the trial judge must make a factual determination as to whether juror misconduct has\r\n\r\noccurred. Smith, 338 S.C. at 71, 525 S.E.2d at 266 (\"Misconduct of a juror is 'a fact to be\r\n\r\ndetermined by the trial judge from the circumstances' of each case.\" (citations omitted));\r\nsee also\r\n\r\n State&nbsp;v. Aldret, 333 S.C. 307, 315, 509 S.E.2d 811, 815 (1999) (holding where affidavits supporting\r\n\r\njuror misconduct are credible, the trial court must conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine if\r\n\r\nmisconduct occurred).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOnly if the trial court finds a juror is guilty of misconduct must the judge determine whether the\r\n\r\nmisconduct affected the verdict, warranting a new trial. See \r\nAldret, 333 S.C. at 315-16, 509 S.E.2d\r\n\r\nat 815.  As to allegations that a juror intentionally provided misleading, false, or incomplete\r\n\r\nanswers on voir dire, a new trial is only necessary where the purposefully concealed information\r\n\r\nwould have been a material factor in the party's use of peremptory challenges or would have\r\n\r\nsupported a challenge for cause. Kelly, 331 S.C. at 146, 502 S.E.2d at 106.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the issue of whether the introduction of extraneous information during jury deliberations\r\n\r\nwarrants a new trial, the supreme court has stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court has broad discretion in assessing allegations of juror misconduct.  Relevant factors\r\n\r\nto be considered in determining whether outside influences have affected the jury are the number\r\n\r\nof jurors exposed, the weight of the evidence properly before the jury, and the likelihood that\r\n\r\ncurative measures were effective in reducing the prejudice.  Generally, the determination of\r\n\r\nwhether extraneous material received by a juror during the course of the trial is prejudicial is a\r\n\r\nmatter for determination by the trial court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nId. at 141-42, 502 S.E.2d at 104.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that Covington failed to prove the alleged misconduct occurred, either\r\n\r\non voir dire or in jury deliberations.  The trial court made a specific finding that the requisite\r\n\r\nburden of proof of juror misconduct would be by a clear and convincing standard.  Alternatively,\r\n\r\nthe trial court found that Covington failed to establish his allegations even under the lesser\r\n\r\npreponderance of the evidence standard.  Because we agree with the trial court that under either\r\n\r\nstandard Covington has not proved juror misconduct, we find it unnecessary, in this case, to\r\n\r\ndetermine the applicable standard of proof necessary to establish juror misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe the trial judge was in the best position to determine the credibility of the testifying\r\n\r\njurors and other evidence because he conducted the original voir dire, tried the case, and\r\n\r\nconsidered the evidence of misconduct.  Although three jurors testified to varying degrees about the\r\n\r\nalleged misconduct, the majority denied or could not recall any misconduct.  Given the conflicting\r\n\r\nevidence, we defer to the sound judgment of the trial judge in resolving a disputed factual issue\r\n\r\nand, therefore, find no abuse of discretion on his part. See \r\nid. at 142, 502 S.E.2d at 104 (\"The trial\r\n\r\njudge is in the best position to determine the credibility of the jurors; therefore, this Court should\r\n\r\ngrant him broad deference on this issue.\"); see also \r\nScott v. State, 288 S.W.2d 796 (Tex. Crim. App.\r\n\r\n1956) (finding no abuse of discretion by the trial court in denying a new trial motion after\r\n\r\ndiscounting the statements of two jurors alleging misconduct as against the contrary statements of\r\n\r\nmost of the other jurors); McClure v. State, 273 S.W. 604 (Tex. Crim. App. 1925) (holding that\r\n\r\nwhen the evidence of juror misconduct conflicted, the trial court's denial of a new trial motion was\r\n\r\nproper absent an abuse of discretion showing).  Since Covington failed to prove juror misconduct by\r\n\r\neither clear and convincing evidence or preponderance of the evidence, we concur in the trial\r\n\r\njudge's reasoning that it was unnecessary for him to address whether there was any prejudice\r\n\r\nresulting from the alleged misconduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the trial court's order denying Covington's motion for a new trial\r\n\r\nis\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOWARD and SHULER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1.

Horton for negligent entrustment of his\r\n\r\nvehicle.  The trial judge granted Horton's Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings.  We reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe complaint alleges the following facts: (1) on April 27, 1995, Horton owned, controlled, or had custody of a 1973\r\n\r\nVolkswagen automobile; (2) Horton entrusted his vehicle to the operation and control of Lydia; (3) at all times, Lydia was\r\n\r\nincompetent to operate the motor vehicle by reason of his impairment by intoxication; (4) Horton knew or, by reason of\r\n\r\nplaintiff's obvious intoxicated condition, should have known that the plaintiff was incompetent to operate the motor vehicle;\r\n\r\n(5) Lydia was operating the motor vehicle on Secondary Highway 13 near Gaffney when he lost control of the vehicle and\r\n\r\nskidded off the road, flipped the vehicle, and struck a tree; and (6) the collision caused serious injuries and damages to Lydia,\r\n\r\nincluding rendering him a quadriplegic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorton moved, pursuant to Rule 12(c), SCRCP, for judgment on the pleadings, averring the only legal inference to be drawn\r\n\r\nfrom the allegations in the complaint is that Lydia's negligence was greater as a matter of law than any negligence on the part\r\n\r\nof Horton.  The Circuit Court granted Horton's motion.  The court concluded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find that [Lydia's] Complaint, although stating the required elements for negligent entrustment, discloses that [Lydia's]\r\n\r\nnegligence was greater than [Horton's], and that [Lydia's] admitted negligence bars him from any recovery under\r\n\r\ncomparative negligence.  I find that persuasive caselaw [sic] from other jurisdictions and the public policy of South Carolina\r\n\r\nsupport barring [Lydia's] recovery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLydia appeals the trial court's determination that he was not entitled to any relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Does South Carolina recognize a first party cause of action for negligent entrustment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Did the Circuit Court err in finding Lydia's negligence in operating a vehicle while impaired was greater as a matter of\r\n\r\nlaw than Horton's negligence in entrusting the vehicle to an intoxicated individual?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAny party may move for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP.  The motion will be sustained only where\r\n\r\nthe pleadings are so defective that, taking all the facts alleged in the pleadings as admitted, no cause of action or defense is\r\n\r\nstated.  Rosenthal v. Unarco Indus., Inc., 278 S.C. 420, 297 S.E.2d 638 (1982); Diminich v. 2001 Enters., Inc., 292 S.C.\r\n\r\n141, 355 S.E.2d 275 (Ct. App. 1987).  A judgment on the pleadings against the plaintiff is not proper if there is an issue of\r\n\r\nfact raised by the complaint which, if resolved in favor of the plaintiff, would entitle him to judgment.  Russell v. City of\r\n\r\nColumbia, 305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991); Douglass ex rel. Louthian v. Boyce, 336 S.C. 318, 519 S.E.2d 802 (Ct.\r\n\r\nApp. 1999).  A complaint is sufficient if it states any cause of action or it appears that the plaintiff is entitled to any relief\r\n\r\nwhatsoever.  Baldwin v. Sanders, 266 S.C. 394, 223 S.E.2d 602 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA judgment on the pleadings is in the nature of a demurrer.  Russell, supra; Brown v. United Ins. Co., 268 S.C. 254, 233\r\n\r\nS.E.2d 298 (1977).  All properly pleaded factual allegations are deemed admitted for purposes of considering the motion for\r\n\r\njudgment on the pleadings.  Baker Hosp. v. Firemans Fund Ins. Co., 314 S.C. 98, 441 S.E.2d 822 (1994); Crowe v.\r\n\r\nDomestic Loans, Inc., 242 S.C. 310, 130 S.E.2d 845 (1963).  When a fact is well pleaded, any inferences of law or\r\n\r\nconclusions of fact that may properly arise therefrom are to be regarded as embraced in the averment.  Crowe, supra;\r\n\r\nDouglass ex rel. Louthian, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn review of the motion, the court may not consider matters outside the pleadings.  Firemen's Ins. Co. v. Cincinnati Ins. Co.,\r\n\r\n302 S.C. 234, 394 S.E.2d 855 (Ct. App. 1990).  Our courts have held that pleadings in a case should be construed liberally\r\n\r\nso that substantial justice is done between the parties.  Russell v. City of Columbia, 305 S.C. 86, 406 S.E.2d 338 (1991);\r\n\r\nManning v. Dial, 271 S.C. 79, 245 S.E.2d 120 (1978).  A judgment on the pleadings is considered to be a drastic procedure. \r\n\r\nRussell, supra; United States Casualty Co. v. Hiers, 233 S.C. 333, 104 S.E.2d 561 (1958).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Negligent Entrustment in South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has recognized a cause of action for negligent entrustment when a third party is injured by a vehicle entrusted\r\n\r\nby its owner to an intoxicated individual.  See McAllister v. Graham, 287 S.C. 455, 339 S.E.2d 154 (Ct. App. 1986).  The\r\n\r\nelements of negligent entrustment are:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(1) Knowledge of or knowledge imputable to the owner that the driver was either addicted to intoxicants or had the habit of\r\n\r\ndrinking, (2) that (sic) the owner knew or had imputable knowledge that the driver was likely to drive while intoxicated, and\r\n\r\n(3) under these circumstances, the entrustment of a vehicle by the owner to such a driver.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJackson v. Price, 288 S.C. 377, 382, 342 S.E.2d 628, 631 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn American Mut. Fire Ins. Co. v. Passmore, 275 S.C. 618, 274 S.E.2d 416 (1981), our Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe theory of negligent entrustment provides: \"the owner or one in control of the vehicle and responsible for its use who is\r\n\r\nnegligent in entrusting it to another can be held liable for such negligent entrustment.\"  19 A.L.R.3d 1175, 1192, cited in\r\n\r\nBahm v. Dormanen, 543 P.2d 379, 381 (Montana 1975).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican Mut. Fire Ins. Co., 275 S.C. at 621, 274 S.E.2d at 418.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina has acknowledged that giving control of property, such as an air rifle, can be negligent.  While not\r\n\r\nspecifically labeling this \"negligent entrustment,\" the same rationale is utilized in finding liability.  In Howell v. Hairston, 261\r\n\r\nS.C. 292, 199 S.E.2d 766 (1973), the Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether one is negligent or prudent depends in large measure on all of the surrounding circumstances, and failure to use due\r\n\r\ncare, amounting to negligence, may be proved by direct as well as by circumstantial evidence.\r\nIn order to hold the\r\n\r\nparents . . . liable, evidence must be submitted tending to prove that a prudent parent would not have\r\n\r\nentrusted [his/her child] with an air rifle under the same or similar circumstances.\r\nA parent might be\r\n\r\njustified in entrusting an air rifle to a particular child while residing in a thinly populated rural area; the same parent might not\r\n\r\nbe justified in entrusting an air rifle to the same child in a thickly populated area where children are accustomed to play.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the evidence to which reference has been made above, an inference can reasonably be drawn that the [parents] failed to\r\n\r\nact as reasonably prudent parents under the circumstances.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowell, 261 S.C. at 298-99, 199 S.E.2d at 769 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court, in Dennis by Evans v. Timmons, 313 S.C. 338, 437 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 1993), found a screwdriver was \"not\r\n\r\nan instrument of dangerous propensities and potentialities.\"  Id. at 341, 437 S.E.2d at 140.  The Court observed:\r\n\r\n\"Furthermore, unlike the air rifle in Howell,\r\nthe [parents] did not entrust the screwdriver, negligently or\r\n\r\notherwise, to a person who, on account of his youth and want of experience, was incapable of\r\n\r\nevaluating the dangers incident to its use.\"  Id. at 341, 437 S.E.2d at 140-41 (emphasis added).  These cases are\r\n\r\nillustrative of the Court applying the underlying theory of negligent entrustment in a situation other than an intoxicated\r\n\r\ndriver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 308 and 390\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 308 (1965), reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is negligence to permit a third person to use a thing or to engage in an activity which is under the control of the actor, if\r\n\r\nthe actor knows or should know that such person intends or is likely to use the thing or to conduct himself in the activity in\r\n\r\nsuch a manner as to create an unreasonable risk of harm to others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to comment b to Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390 (1965), the \"rule stated in [Â§ 390] is a special application\r\n\r\nof the rule stated in Â§ 308.\"  Section 390 provides: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne who supplies directly or through a third person a chattel for the use of another whom the supplier knows or has reason\r\n\r\nto know to be likely because of his youth, inexperience, or otherwise, to use it in a manner involving unreasonable risk of\r\n\r\nphysical harm to himself and others whom the supplier should expect to share in or be endangered by its use, is subject to\r\n\r\nliability for physical harm resulting to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCases such as Howell v. Hairston, 261 S.C. 292, 199 S.E.2d 766 (1973), and  Dennis by Evans v. Timmons, 313 S.C. 338,\r\n\r\n437 S.E.2d 138 (Ct. App. 1993), are grounded upon the same premise: an item may be used by someone who is, \"on\r\n\r\naccount of his youth and want of experience, . . . incapable of evaluating the dangers incident to its use.\"  Dennis by Evans,\r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 341, 437 S.E.2d at 140-41.  South Carolina has never predicated its decisions on the Restatement (Second) of\r\n\r\nTorts Â§ 390.  However, we have consistently recognized the common law tort of negligent entrustment.  See Nettles v. Your\r\n\r\nIce Co., 191 S.C. 429, 4 S.E.2d 797 (1939).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions have relied upon Â§ 390 of the Restatement (Second) of Torts as the basis for their negligent entrustment\r\n\r\ncause of action.

Davis, 188 S.E.2d 226 (Va.\r\n\r\n1972)(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390, the court concluded the correct test of liability for negligent\r\n\r\nentrustment of automobile to another is whether owner knew, or had reasonable cause to know, he was entrusting his\r\n\r\nautomobile to an unfit driver likely to cause injury to others).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProsser and Keeton on the Law of Torts enlightens and elucidates that the theory of negligent entrustment is based on the\r\n\r\nnegligence of the entrustor:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA parent, for example, like anyone else, may be negligent in entrusting to a child a dangerous instrument such as a gun, or a\r\n\r\nthing dangerous in the hands of that particular child because of his handicaps or propensity to misuse it, for example,\r\n\r\nmatches or an automobile.  Similarly the parent may be negligent in leaving such things where they are accessible to the child\r\n\r\nwhere misuse is a risk. (Footnotes omitted.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nW. Page Keeton et al., Prosser and Keeton on the Law of Torts Â§ 123, at 914 (5th ed. 1984).  Another commentator\r\n\r\nexplains \"[t]he crux of the negligence is the knowledge of the entruster of the youth, inexperience, known propensity\r\n\r\ntowards reckless and irresponsible behavior, or other quality of the entrustee, indicating the possibility that he will cause\r\n\r\ninjury.\"  1 J. Dooley, Modern Tort Law Â§ 23.01 (1977).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of our decisions follow closely the logic of the Restatement.  See Howell v. Hairston, 261 S.C. 292, 199 S.E.2d 766\r\n\r\n(1973); Jackson v. Price, 288 S.C. 377, 342 S.E.2d 628 (Ct. App. 1986); McAllister v. Graham, 287 S.C. 455, 339 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n154 (Ct. App. 1986).  The Restatement is a correct statement of the amalgamation of cases decided in South Carolina under\r\n\r\nvarious theories of law including: (1) \"negligent entrustment\" under Jackson, supra;  and (2) negligence under Howell, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe adopt the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§Â§ 308 and 390 as the appropriate standard for negligent entrustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.  First Party Cause of Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe determine if there is a first party cause of action under the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390.  A first party cause of\r\n\r\naction under the theory of \"negligent entrustment\" of a vehicle to an intoxicated individual is novel in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998), our Supreme Court concluded there is no first party\r\n\r\ncause of action under the alcohol control statutes against the tavern owner by an intoxicated adult.  The Court ruled:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580(2) prohibits the knowing sale of beer or wine to an intoxicated person, while Â§\r\n\r\n61-6-2220 prohibits the sale of alcoholic beverages contained in minibottles to intoxicated persons.  In recognizing a private\r\n\r\ncause of action for a violation of these statutes, the Court of Appeals stated that their purpose is to promote public safety,\r\n\r\nand to prevent an already intoxicated person from becoming even more intoxicated, and thus an even greater risk to the\r\n\r\npublic at large, when he leaves the establishment.  We agree.  The Court of Appeals went further, however, and held that\r\n\r\nanother of the statutory purposes was to protect the intoxicated person from their own incompetence and helplessness, and\r\n\r\ntherefore concluded the intoxicated patron himself was entitled to bring a negligence suit for a statutory violation.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree, and now hold that public policy is not served by allowing the intoxicated adult patron to maintain a suit for injuries\r\n\r\nwhich result from his own conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImposing liability on a tavern owner for continuing to serve an intoxicated person who later injures others serves public\r\n\r\npolicy by imposing upon the tavern owner a duty to use judgment and discretion.  We do not believe that the owner will\r\n\r\nexercise this judgment and discretion less prudently if he risks a law suit only when the intoxicated person injures others. \r\n\r\nThe decision to refuse to serve alcoholic beverages, beer or wine to an intoxicated patron will be unaffected by our decision\r\n\r\ntoday.  In overruling Christiansen [v. Campbell, 285 S.C. 164, 328 S.E.2d 351 (Ct. App. 1985)], we join other jurisdictions\r\n\r\nthat have refused to allow intoxicated persons to maintain a first party action against a tavern owner based on alleged\r\n\r\nviolations of statutes imposing criminal penalties for the sale of alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTobias, 332 S.C. at 92, 504 S.E.2d at 319-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHorton argues Tobias can be cited for the proposition that an adult who is voluntarily intoxicated is still held to a reasonable\r\n\r\nperson standard.  While Tobias may be instructive when considering the comparative negligence of the voluntarily\r\n\r\nintoxicated adult, it should in no way be determinative of whether a first party cause of action for negligent entrustment may\r\n\r\nbe sustained.  Tobias concludes \"we join other jurisdictions that have refused to allow intoxicated persons to maintain a first\r\n\r\nparty action against a tavern owner based on alleged violations of statutes imposing criminal penalties for the sale of\r\n\r\nalcoholic beverages to an intoxicated adult.\"  Id. at 92, 504 S.E.2d at 320 (emphasis added).  The theory of negligent\r\n\r\nentrustment was not involved in Tobias.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeal for the Fifth District of California considered a similar argument in Blake v. Moore, 208 Cal. Rptr. 703\r\n\r\n(Cal. Ct. App. 1984).  California limits the tort liability of suppliers of alcohol.  In Blake, the owner of the vehicle provided\r\n\r\nthe alcohol consumed by the injured driver as well as the vehicle.  The entrustee brought the action claiming he was too\r\n\r\ndrunk to be entrusted the car.  In the trial court, the entrustee argued the injuries were the result of two proximate causes:\r\n\r\n(1) the negligent entrustment of a vehicle to an obviously drunken driver; and (2) the intoxication.  Because no third person\r\n\r\nwas involved, the trial court granted defendant summary judgment.  On appeal, the court explicated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reaching our conclusion to reverse the judgment we look to the \"furnishing\" statute which in most, but not all, cases\r\n\r\nprotects the supplier of alcoholic beverages from tort liability.  The rationale is that the proximate cause of drunk driving\r\n\r\naccidents is not in the giving or selling of the liquor, but is in the consumption itself.\r\nHowever, in this case more than\r\n\r\nliquor was supplied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the immunity for the supplier of alcoholic beverages protects only against the risks directly\r\n\r\nflowing from the supply of the liquor. It does not provide immunity for the entrustment of the car. \r\n\r\nTherefore, two concurrent causes were at work when plaintiff lost control of the vehicle.  Because comparative negligence\r\n\r\nprinciples apply, issues of fact were present, requiring trial on the merits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlake, 208 Cal. Rptr. at 704 (emphasis added).  The California court acknowledged the difficulty the plaintiff would face in\r\n\r\nattempting to assign fault to the entrustor of the vehicle when comparing it to his own decision to drink and drive.  However,\r\n\r\nthe court emphasized the cause of action was viable nonetheless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNegligent entrustment, as annunciated under the standard of the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390, encompasses more\r\n\r\nthan an intoxicated adult being given the keys to an automobile who is subsequently involved in an accident.  It includes an\r\n\r\nindividual giving a gun to a child who then shoots himself because he has no understanding of how to use the weapon or the\r\n\r\nrisks involved.  Negligent entrustment embraces a legally incompetent individual entrusted with an automobile who thereafter\r\n\r\nis involved in an accident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, comment c to Â§ 390 reads:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rule stated in this Section sets out the conditions under which a supplier of a chattel is subject to liability.  As always this\r\n\r\nphrase denotes that a supplier is liable if, but only if, his conduct is the legal cause of the bodily harm complained of and if\r\n\r\nthe person suffering the harm is not subject to any defense such as contributory negligence, which will prevent him from\r\n\r\nrecovering damages therefor.  One who accepts and uses a chattel knowing that he is incompetent to use it safely or who\r\n\r\nassociates himself in the use of a chattel by one whom he knows to be so incompetent, or one who is himself careless in the\r\n\r\nuse of the chattel after receiving it, is usually in such contributory fault as to bar recovery.  If, however, the person to whom\r\n\r\nthe chattel is supplied is one of a class which is legally recognized as so incompetent as to prevent them from being\r\n\r\nresponsible for their actions, the supplier may be liable for harm suffered by him, as when a loaded gun is entrusted to a child\r\n\r\nof tender years.  So too, if the supplier knows that the condition of the person to whom the chattel is supplied is such as to\r\n\r\nmake him incapable of exercising the care which it is reasonable to expect of a normal sober adult, the supplier may be liable\r\n\r\nfor harm sustained by the incompetent although such person deals with it in a way which may render him liable to third\r\n\r\npersons who are also injured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis comment shows the drafters' belief that a first party cause of action could be maintained, but understood that it would\r\n\r\nbe limited by the prevailing negligence theory in the specific jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.  Other Jurisdictions Recognizing First Party Cause of Action\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJurisdictions around the country have held a first party cause of action can be brought for negligent entrustment.  These\r\n\r\njurisdictions rely in some manner upon the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390.  The cases have allowed first party causes\r\n\r\nof action for underage drivers and where the individual injured was an intoxicated adult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourts have found a bailor is liable to a bailee under the doctrine of negligent entrustment if the bailee is injured through his\r\n\r\nor her own negligence or incompetence and the bailor knew or should have known the bailee was likely to injure himself or\r\n\r\nherself because of inexperience or inability in using the object of the bailment.  Ward Miller, Annotation, Negligent\r\n\r\nEntrustment: Bailor's Liability To Bailee Injured Through His Own Negligence Or Incompetence, 12 A.L.R. 4th 1062\r\n\r\n(1982).  The situation has arisen most commonly in the bailment of an automobile, with an automobile owner loaning an\r\n\r\nautomobile to a young and inexperienced driver.  Id.  Yet, although holding that a bailee, who alleges that it was negligence\r\n\r\nfor a bailor to entrust him or her with a certain object, has stated a valid cause of action, courts have indicated a willingness\r\n\r\nto allow traditional defenses of contributory negligence or assumption of the risk to bar recovery in some cases.  Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first cases to apply the above principles to a first party cause of action was Keller v. Kiedinger, 389 So. 2d 129\r\n\r\n(Ala. 1980).  The defendant, an eighteen-year-old boy, allowed the decedent, a fourteen-year-old girl, to drive his aunt's car. \r\n\r\nWhile driving, the decedent drove across the center line into the wrong lane.  She swerved to avoid an oncoming vehicle, lost\r\n\r\ncontrol, overturned the vehicle in a pond, and drowned as a result of the accident.  The girl's father brought an action for\r\n\r\nnegligent entrustment against the defendant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendant argued that a bailee injured by her own negligence may not bring suit against the bailor.  The Supreme Court\r\n\r\nof Alabama found the essence of a claim for negligent entrustment was the primary negligence of the bailor in entrusting the\r\n\r\nchattel to the incompetent bailee, not the bailee's negligence.  Thus, the bailee's negligence was not an essential element of\r\n\r\nthe claim against the bailor and the claim was not barred per se by the doctrine of contributory negligence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court held:  \"After careful consideration, we are convinced the Restatement proposes the best view, and we adopt Â§ 390\r\n\r\nas the law of this state.\"  Id at 132.  The court recognized a bailee may maintain a cause of action against a bailor for\r\n\r\nnegligent entrustment.  Relying upon comment c to Â§ 390, the Keller court declared contributory negligence was a defense to\r\n\r\nan action for negligent entrustment.  The court concluded the decedent was contributorily negligent as a matter of law and,\r\n\r\nin the absence of any evidence that defendant had wantonly entrusted the car to the decedent, the plaintiff's action was\r\n\r\nbarred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the Court of Appeals of North Carolina examined the issue in Meachum v. Faw, 436 S.E.2d 141 (N.C. Ct. App.\r\n\r\n1993).  In that case, the plaintiffs brought an action for negligent entrustment against the defendant alleging he negligently\r\n\r\nallowed the plaintiffs' sixteen-year-old daughter, whom he knew to be an unlicensed and incompetent driver, to drive his car\r\n\r\nafter she had consumed substantial amounts of mind-altering substances.  The plaintiffs further averred that the daughter, as\r\n\r\na result of her intoxication and incompetence, drove defendant's car recklessly and at a high rate of speed, eventually driving\r\n\r\nthe car off the highway and having a wreck resulting in her death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court elucidated:  \"Like the Alabama Supreme Court [in Keller, supra], we find the view presented in the Restatement\r\n\r\ncompelling and adopt it as our own.  Thus, we hold that a bailee may bring an action for negligent entrustment against the\r\n\r\nbailor but that such an action is subject to the defense of contributory negligence.\"  Meachum, 436 S.E.2d at 144.  The\r\n\r\nMeachum court affirmed the trial court's dismissal of the action:  \"[T]he decedent's own negligence in driving while\r\n\r\nvoluntarily intoxicated rose to the level of the defendant's negligence in entrusting the automobile to her.  Therefore, we find\r\n\r\nthat, as a matter of law, the plaintiffs' claim is barred by decedent's contributory negligence as alleged in the complaint.\"  Id.\r\n\r\nat 145.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina, unlike North Carolina and Alabama, adopted comparative negligence in lieu of contributory negligence. \r\n\r\nStates utilizing comparative negligence rely upon the Restatement's view allowing for a first party cause of action by the\r\n\r\nentrustee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Blake v. Moore, 208 Cal. Rptr. 703 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984), the California Court of Appeal, citing Â§ 390 of the Restatement\r\n\r\n(Second) of Torts, determined the injured, intoxicated driver of a vehicle could pursue the owner of the automobile for\r\n\r\nnegligent entrustment.  The court found helpful illustration 7 to comment c of Â§ 390.  The court expounded:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[T]he California comparative negligence doctrine was established, abrogating contributory negligence as a complete bar to\r\n\r\nrecovery on a negligence complaint.  Voluntary intoxication may amount to wilful misconduct.  Nevertheless, the drinking is\r\n\r\nnot so \"intentional\" that it disqualifies an injured person from comparative negligence relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintiff may be unable to excuse his voluntary intoxication.  Nevertheless, he is entitled to a comparative fault trial.  This\r\n\r\nshould result in a weighing of defendant's fault in entrusting his car to plaintiff with knowledge of the intoxication, and the\r\n\r\nfault of plaintiff in drinking and then driving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlake, 208 Cal. Rptr. at 708 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFlorida has likewise permitted an injured, drunken driver to sue the owner under negligent entrustment.  Gorday v. Faris, 523\r\n\r\nSo. 2d 1215 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988), involved the entrustment of a vehicle by the intoxicated owner-passenger to his\r\n\r\nintoxicated friend.  The plaintiff admitted his intoxication and that he agreed to drive the car.  When he fell asleep at the\r\n\r\nwheel of the automobile, the plaintiff had an accident which resulted in his paralysis.  The plaintiff sued his friend, claiming\r\n\r\nthe friend negligently entrusted his car to an intoxicated driver.  After reviewing cases from other jurisdictions and the\r\n\r\nRestatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390, the court decided:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpon our review of the authorities cited, we conclude, in agreement with appellants, that this action is properly maintainable\r\n\r\nunder the \"negligent entrustment\" theory, and that the evidence tending to establish negligence on the part of Brown in\r\n\r\nconsciously deciding to take control of the vehicle, even though he knew he was in no condition to drive, must be weighed\r\n\r\nand considered, under comparative negligence principles, in relation to the evidence tending to establish negligence on the\r\n\r\npart of Faris in turning the car over to one whose faculties he either knew or should have known were impaired by drinking. .\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n. . . We are persuaded, in view of the existence of the comparative negligence rule in Florida, that the liability for negligent\r\n\r\nentrustment under the circumstances indicated by the pleadings and the proofs thus far submitted in this case must be\r\n\r\ndetermined by the trier of fact after a comparative fault trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGorday, 523 So. 2d at 1219.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing v. Petefish, 541 N.E.2d 847 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989), is particularly instructive.  In King, the defendant loaned her car to the\r\n\r\ndecedent, an unlicensed, intoxicated fifteen-year-old girl.  While driving the car, the decedent had an accident and died as a\r\n\r\nresult.  Decedent's estate brought an action against the entrustor of the vehicle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendant contended Illinois did not recognize a cause of action by the entrustee against the entrustor and, even\r\n\r\nassuming it did, such a cause of action would be self-defeating because the negligence of the decedent was the proximate\r\n\r\ncause of her own injuries.  The Appellate Court of Illinois stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt appears that in States where contributory negligence is the rule, such as Alabama (see Keller, 389 So. 2d 129), a cause of\r\n\r\naction by an entrustee against an entrustor under section 390 will be a self-defeating claim.  However, the States that have\r\n\r\nadopted comparative negligence seem to uniformly accept such a cause of action.  We find section 390 of the Restatement is\r\n\r\nappropriately applied to negligent entrustment cases of the type before us and hold, by that authority, a suit brought by an\r\n\r\ninjured entrustee against his entrustor is a viable cause of action in a comparative negligence jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKing, 541 N.E.2d at 852.  See also Steven C. Ward, Entrustees' Right to Sue for Negligent Entrustment, 78 Ill. B.J. 606\r\n\r\n(Dec. 1990)(arguing the adoption by King v. Petefish of a first party cause of action for negligent entrustment should be\r\n\r\ncontinued after Illinois switches from pure comparative negligence to modified comparative negligence).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of Colorado addressed a comparable issue in Casebolt v. Cowan, 829 P.2d 352 (Colo. 1992).  The wife\r\n\r\nof an employee sued the employer for the wrongful death of her husband after her husband, who was intoxicated at the time,\r\n\r\ndied while operating his employer's vehicle.  The wife asserted liability based on a theory of negligent entrustment.  The\r\n\r\ncourt clarified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 390 establishes a framework for examining the entrustment of a vehicle to an individual who presents an\r\n\r\nunreasonable risk of drinking and driving, based either on known propensity or intoxication on the occasion of the\r\n\r\nentrustment. The framers of section 390 specifically envisioned its application to cases of intoxicated entrustees.  Illustration\r\n\r\n7 states: \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA, who makes a business of letting out boats for hire, rents his boat to B and C, who are obviously so intoxicated as to make\r\n\r\nit likely that they will mismanage the boat so as to capsize it or to collide with other boats.  B and C by their drunken\r\n\r\nmismanagement collide with the boat of D, upsetting both boats.  B, C, and D are drowned.  A is subject to liability to the\r\n\r\nestates of  B, C, and D under the death statute, although the estates of B and C may also be liable for the death of D.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nOther jurisdictions apply section 390 to instances where the entrustee's incompetence to operate a vehicle centers on or\r\n\r\nincludes the consumption of alcohol.  E.g., Blake v. Moore, 162 Cal. App. 3d 700, 208 Cal. Rptr. 703, 707-08 (1984);\r\n\r\nGorday v. Faris, 523 So. 2d 1215 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1988); Snowhite v. State, 243 Md. 291, 221 A.2d 342, 355 (1966);\r\n\r\nLombardo v. Hoag, 237 N.J. Super. 87, 566 A.2d 1185, 1190 n. 4 (1989); Cameron v. Downs, 32 Wash. App. 875, 650\r\n\r\nP.2d 260, 262 (1982).  This accords with the general understanding that driving while intoxicated presents an unreasonable\r\n\r\nrisk of physical harm to the driver and others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThus, we believe section 390 provides a basis for resolving the issues of duty (whether a supplier of a chattel owes any\r\n\r\nobligation to a person incurring physical harm from the use of the chattel by the person to whom it is supplied) and the\r\n\r\nspecific standard of care (the criteria for assessing reasonable care in light of apparent risk) in the context of supplying\r\n\r\nchattels for the use of others. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCasebolt, 829 P.2d at 358.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Colorado court ruled an entrustee can recover for physical harm to himself resulting from negligent entrustment.  The\r\n\r\ncourt noted \"[c]omparative negligence provides the appropriate framework for examining any negligence on the part of the\r\n\r\n[automobile borrower] who drives after consuming alcoholic beverages.\"  Id. at 362.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals of Texas, in Jamar v. Patterson, 910 S.W.2d 118 (Tex. Ct. App. 1995), discussed whether recovery\r\n\r\nfor negligent entrustment was limited to third parties.  The plaintiff in Jamar, an unlicensed, twelve-year-old driver, sustained\r\n\r\nfacial injuries when she lost control of a dune buggy she was driving and struck a tree.  She brought a suit against the owner\r\n\r\nof the dune buggy alleging the owner had negligently permitted her to operate the vehicle.  The jury returned a verdict for\r\n\r\nthe plaintiff.  The defendant appealed asserting there is no first party cause of action for negligent entrustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court found Texas law recognized a cause of action by a driver against the owner based upon negligent entrustment. \r\n\r\nThe court amplified:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMoreover, recovery by the driver against the owner has been recognized in other jurisdictions where negligent entrustment\r\n\r\nwas proven and not barred by contributory negligence.  No case has been cited or found from another jurisdiction which\r\n\r\nlimits such recovery to third parties. Furthermore, negligent entrustment is actionable by the driver under the Restatement\r\n\r\n(Second) of Torts Â§ 390 cmt. c (1965).  We are also aware of no policy reason for denying recovery to the driver for\r\n\r\nnegligent entrustment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJamar, 910 S.W.2d at 121 (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.  Comparative Negligence in South Carolina\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Nelson v. Concrete Supply Co., 303 S.C. 243, 399 S.E.2d 783 (1991), our Supreme Court adopted a modified version of\r\n\r\ncomparative negligence.  Under this system, for all causes of action arising on or after July 1, 1991, a plaintiff in a negligence\r\n\r\naction may recover damages if his or her negligence is not greater than that of the defendant.  Davenport v. Cotton Hope\r\n\r\nPlantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998); Nelson, supra.  Nelson made clear that a\r\n\r\nplaintiff's contributory negligence would no longer bar recovery unless such negligence exceeded that of the defendant.\r\n\r\nWe agree that a cause of action for negligent entrustment in the instant case by the intoxicated entrustee may be difficult in\r\n\r\nits application.  See Blake v. Moore, 208 Cal. Rptr. 703 (Cal. Ct. App. 1984); Gorday v. Faris, 523 So. 2d 1215 (Fla. Dist.\r\n\r\nCt. App. 1988); King v. Petefish, 541 N.E.2d 847 (Ill. App. Ct. 1989).  The voluntarily intoxicated driver will have difficulty\r\n\r\nexcusing his own negligent actions sufficiently to collect against the owner.  However, in the case sub judice, no facts have\r\n\r\nbeen developed beyond the pleading verbiage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLydia admits in his complaint that he was intoxicated and incompetent to drive the vehicle.  Concomitantly, factual conflicts\r\n\r\nremain in regard to: (1) the degree of Lydia's intoxication and incompetence; and  (2) the extent of Horton's knowledge of\r\n\r\nLydia's intoxication.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreech v. South Carolina Wildlife and Marine Resources Dep't, 328 S.C. 24, 491 S.E.2d 571 (1997), illuminates regarding\r\n\r\nthe comparative negligence issue:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison of a plaintiff's negligence with that of the defendant is a question of fact for the jury to\r\n\r\ndecide.  See, e.g., Ott v. Pittman, 320 S.C. 72, 80, 463 S.E.2d 101, 106 (Ct. App. 1995)(citing trial judge's statement that\r\n\r\n\"because this was a comparative negligence case, even if the plaintiff's testimony amounted to an admission of negligence, it\r\n\r\nwas a question of fact for the jury to compare the plaintiff's negligence [with that of the defendant].\"); cf. Gruber v. Santee\r\n\r\nFrozen Foods, Inc., 309 S.C. 13, 21, 419 S.E.2d 795, 800 (Ct. App. 1992)(\"Generally, contributory negligence is a question\r\n\r\nfor determination by the jury. But when the evidence admits only one reasonable inference, it becomes a matter of law for the\r\n\r\ndetermination of the court.\"), cert. denied, 1993.\r\nA directed verdict is warranted only if the only reasonable\r\n\r\ninference that may be drawn from the evidence is that the plaintiff's negligence exceeded fifty percent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCreech, 328 S.C. at 33, 491 S.E.2d at 575 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rule an entrustee may bring a first party cause of action for negligent entrustment against the entrustor of the vehicle or\r\n\r\nother chattel.  We adopt the Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 390 rule as the proper standard in South Carolina for negligent\r\n\r\nentrustment.  We conclude this case was decided prematurely in view of the existence of the comparative negligence rule in\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina.  The liability for negligent entrustment under a first party cause of action involves a comparison of a\r\n\r\nplaintiff's negligence with that of the defendant.  The fact finder is to compare the defendant's fault in entrusting his car to\r\n\r\nthe plaintiff knowing the plaintiff's intoxication and impairment, and the fault of the plaintiff in drinking and then driving. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the Circuit Court's order granting Horton's motion for judgment on the pleadings and remand for\r\n\r\nfurther proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.

The briefed\r\n\r\nissues are: (1) whether the trial court erred by  denying Harrison's requested jury charge regarding evidence of\r\n\r\ngood character and good reputation and (2) whether any error can be considered harmless.  We reverse and\r\n\r\nremand for a new trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt approximately 2:30 a.m. on July 21, 1996, Officer Timothy Hathaway, with the Charleston County Sheriff's Department,\r\n\r\nwas patrolling a \"high drug and crime area\" of North Charleston when he saw two men standing very close together who\r\n\r\n\"appeared to be in some type of transaction.\"  The men were \"facing away from\" Officer Hathaway.  When the men saw\r\n\r\nHathaway, one ran from the scene and was never apprehended.  Officer Hathaway observed the other man, later identified as\r\n\r\nHarrison, drop a \"small white object\" from his left hand onto the ground in front of him.  Harrison then turned and began\r\n\r\nwalking towards Hathaway.  The officer patted Harrison down for weapons and placed him in the patrol car.  Harrison had a\r\n\r\n\"wad of bills\" in his right hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother officer who had arrived on the scene retrieved the object, which was a plastic baggie containing a\r\n\r\nwhite powder substance that field tested positive for cocaine.  During the pat-down and while he was in the patrol\r\n\r\ncar, Harrison became \"hysterical,\" insisting the drugs did not belong to him and referring to the \"wad of bills\" in his right\r\n\r\nhand.  Harrison told police he intended to buy drugs, but that he had not done so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison was charged with possession of cocaine.  He testified on his own behalf at trial.  Harrison stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThat particular night, a friend of mine asked me to go and meet someone somewhere, at some place.  Which was the\r\n\r\ndestination where I went.  I have never been there before.  And I was going to meet this person, they were going to purchase\r\n\r\n[drugs] for a friend of mine.  But me thinking I was something, I could do it myself, I went there to meet the person and the\r\n\r\nperson wasn't there.  So this gentleman had some drugs on him, and I thought I could purchase it myself.  You know,\r\n\r\ninstead of waiting for the person to meet me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dealer approached Harrison, asked what he needed, and tried to show him the drugs.  According to Harrison, although\r\n\r\nhe was trying to buy drugs for his friend, the sale was not completed because the dealer wanted $50 but Harrison only had\r\n\r\nthe $40 his friend provided.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJust after he told the dealer he did not want the drugs, the police car arrived. The dealer ran.  Harrison attempted to explain\r\n\r\nto the officer that he still had the money in his hand and had not purchased the drugs.  He admitted to the officer that he was\r\n\r\ntrying to buy drugs but said the transaction had not been completed.  Harrison claimed the drugs were not under his control\r\n\r\nand that he never even held the bag in his hand.  Although Officer Hathaway testified there was plenty of lighting, Harrison\r\n\r\nrecalled the other officer had to use a flashlight to find the drugs on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore his arrest, Harrison worked at Charter of Charleston and Good Will Industries, counseling adolescents.  He declared\r\n\r\nhis conduct on the night of his arrest was not part of his normal lifestyle.  Harrison professed he made a stupid and costly\r\n\r\ndecision of which he was ashamed.  In addition, Harrison presented the testimony of Minnie Cutler, a character witness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the close of all evidence, the parties presented their arguments and the trial court charged the jury.  Defense counsel\r\n\r\nobjected to the charge, arguing the court failed to issue a requested charge that evidence of good character and good\r\n\r\nreputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to the defendant's guilt.  The court refused to charge the requested\r\n\r\ninstruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring deliberations, the jury sent the court a note asking the meaning of possession.  After the court explained the law of\r\n\r\npossession, the foreman asked the court to \"reread the constructive part of the possession.\"  Upon additional deliberation,\r\n\r\nthe jury sent another note prompting further clarification of the law of possession.  The foreman requested the court read the\r\n\r\nlaw again without using any examples.  After receiving a third note from the jury, the court issued an Allen charge.  Before\r\n\r\nretiring to the jury room, the foreman again requested the court read the law of possession, particularly constructive\r\n\r\npossession.  The foreman asked for more facts concerning the location of the crime, whether joint possession was possible,\r\n\r\nand whether money had to change hands.  The court responded that joint possession was possible but refused to answer the\r\n\r\nother questions.  The court reminded the jury the State had the burden of proof.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison was convicted of possession of cocaine.  He was sentenced to four months imprisonment or payment of a $750\r\n\r\nfine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Did the trial court err in refusing to instruct the jury that evidence of a defendant's good character and good\r\n\r\nreputation may in and of itself create a reasonable doubt as to guilt?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Was any error in refusing to instruct the jury on the issue of good character and good reputation harmless in\r\n\r\nlight of the fact Harrison was charged with possessing, rather than attempting to possess, cocaine?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. GOOD CHARACTER AND GOOD REPUTATION CHARGE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison argues the trial judge erred in refusing to instruct the jury regarding evidence of good character and good\r\n\r\nreputation.  We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, Harrison testified as to his community involvement, including counseling adolescents.  Additionally, Harrison\r\n\r\npresented the testimony of a character witness,  Minnie Cutler, a foster care supervisor with the Berkeley County\r\n\r\nDepartment of Social Services and a pastor of a local church.  Cutler testified, in essence, as to Harrison's good character\r\n\r\nand good reputation.  Cutler detailed Harrison's volunteer activities at the church.  She stated that during the one and one-half years Harrison had been a member of the church, he served as a trusted member of the finance committee and helped\r\n\r\nrenovate the child care center.  Cutler described how Harrison \"opened up his home\" to two single mothers who needed a\r\n\r\nplace to stay until they could find a job and an apartment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThereafter, defense counsel requested the judge charge the jury that \"[e]vidence of good character and good reputation may\r\n\r\nin and of itself create a doubt as to the guilt that should be considered by you . . ., along with all of the other testimony and\r\n\r\nevidence.  Whether the State has proven the defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\"  The judge refused to charge the\r\n\r\nrequested instruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIndubitably, a defendant may introduce evidence of his good character.  State v. Lyles, 210 S.C. 87, 41 S.E.2d 625 (1947). \r\n\r\nGenerally, where requested and there is evidence of good character, a defendant is entitled to an instruction to the effect that\r\n\r\nevidence of good character and good reputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt and should be considered by\r\n\r\nthe jury, along with all the other evidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  State v. Green, 278 S.C.\r\n\r\n239, 294 S.E.2d 335 (1982).  The good reputation of the accused, if proved, may be taken into consideration by the jury in\r\n\r\ndetermining whether or not he committed the crime charged.  Lyles, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn State v. Hill, 129 S.C. 166, 123 S.E. 817 (1924), our Supreme Court considered the propriety of the following jury\r\n\r\ncharge:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"As to good reputation, you can consider that like any other testimony.  Not that the law says a man can kill another because\r\n\r\nhe has a good reputation, but the jury can take the good reputation into consideration in determining whether or not he\r\n\r\ncommitted a crime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHill, 129 S.C. at 170, 123 S.E. at 818.  On appeal from his conviction for manslaughter, Hill maintained \"'[t]he jury should\r\n\r\nnot have been limited, but the good reputation should have been considered, like any other testimony, throughout the whole\r\n\r\ncase, and as bearing thereupon, without any limitation whatever.'\"  Id. at 170, 123 S.E. at 818.  The Court articulated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe charge by its very terms answers the appellant's criticism.  Evidence of the defendant's good reputation for peace and\r\n\r\ngood order is strongly persuasive of his good character in that respect, and is offered for the very purpose stated by the\r\n\r\ncircuit judge, to show the improbability that the defendant would have committed or did commit the crime charged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHill, 129 S.C. at 170, 123 S.E. at 818 (emphasis in original).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court revisited the issue regarding a jury charge as to good character and good reputation in State v. Lyles,\r\n\r\n210 S.C. 87, 41 S.E.2d 625 (1947).  In that case, the defendant, convicted of assault and battery of a high and aggravated\r\n\r\nnature, contended the court erred \"in failing to charge that the jury 'had a right to consider the defendant's good character\r\n\r\nand reputation and that it was a substantial fact in the case, if proven, and should be considered by the jury.'\"  Id. at 92, 41\r\n\r\nS.E.2d at 627.  The Court held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt of the right of appellant to put in evidence his good character and it was \"for the jury to consider it in\r\n\r\nconnection with the other evidence, and determine what force and effect it should have.\"  State v. Barth, 25 S.C. 175, 60\r\n\r\nAm. Rep. 496 (1886).  The good reputation of the accused, if proved, may be taken into consideration by the jury in\r\n\r\ndetermining whether or not he committed the crime charged.  State v. Hill, 129 S.C. 166, 123 S.E. 817 (1924).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLyles, 210 S.C. at 92, 41 S.E.2d at 627.  Although Lyles presented a witness who testified to his peaceable and law-abiding\r\n\r\nreputation, he did not ask the trial court to give a good reputation charge.  Thus, the issue was not preserved for appellate\r\n\r\nreview. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Lyles, the good character and reputation charge was discussed in State v. Green, 278 S.C. 239, 294 S.E.2d 335\r\n\r\n(1982).  On appeal from his conviction for armed robbery, Green claimed the trial court erred in refusing to instruct the jury,\r\n\r\nas requested, that evidence of good character alone may be sufficient to raise a reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused. \r\n\r\nThe Court explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, where requested and there is evidence of good character, a defendant is entitled to an instruction to the effect that\r\n\r\nevidence of good character and good reputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt and should be considered by\r\n\r\nthe jury, along with all the other evidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  State v. Lyles, 210 S.C.\r\n\r\n87, 41 S.E.2d 625.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreen, 278 S.C. at 240, 294 S.E.2d at 335.  Despite the general rule, the Green Court ruled the Circuit judge's refusal to\r\n\r\ninstruct the jury on the issue of good character was not reversible error because the defendant admitted his presence and\r\n\r\nparticipation in the robbery.  The record conclusively established Green's guilt.  The Court concluded the error, if any, could\r\n\r\nnot reasonably have affected the result and was harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law to be charged to the jury is determined by the evidence presented at trial.  State v. Hill, 315 S.C. 260, 433 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n848 (1993).  A trial court commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge on an issue raised by the evidence. \r\n\r\nId.  A trial court has a duty to give a requested instruction that correctly states the law applicable to the issues and which is\r\n\r\nsupported by the evidence.  State v. Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 466 S.E.2d 375 (Ct. App. 1996).  See also State v. Austin, 299 S.C.\r\n\r\n456, 385 S.E.2d 830 (1989)(defendant is generally entitled to requested jury instruction if it is a correct statement of the law\r\n\r\non an issue raised by the indictment); State v. West, 138 S.C. 421, 136 S.E. 736 (1927)(it is duty of court to charge jury as\r\n\r\nto law which is applicable to facts as brought out in testimony).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison presented evidence of his good reputation and good character.  Moreover, he requested an instruction regarding\r\n\r\nsuch evidence.  The trial court erred in failing to give the requested charge where the issue relating to Harrison's good\r\n\r\ncharacter and reputation was raised by the evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a footnote, the State asserts this issue is not preserved because Harrison \"failed to request the instruction before the trial\r\n\r\njudge's charge on the law.\"  This statement is incorrect.  After the judge's charge to the jury, the following exchange\r\n\r\noccurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]: I didn't hear you charge the Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court: I respectfully deny your motion, I don't think that I am going to charge that.  That is 33, isn't it?\r\n\r\n[Defense Counsel]: 32, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese numerical references reveal either a charge conference took place or defense counsel presented the judge with various\r\n\r\nnumbered charge requests prior to the judge's instruction to the jury.  Irrefutably, the issue is preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  HARMLESS ERROR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State contends the court's failure to charge the requested instruction was harmless in light of the evidence at trial.  We\r\n\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo warrant reversal, a trial judge's refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous and prejudicial.  State v.\r\n\r\nHughey, 339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000).  The trial court commits reversible error if it fails to give a requested charge\r\n\r\non an issue raised by the evidence.  State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999).  See also State v. Peay, 321 S.C.\r\n\r\n405, 468 S.E.2d 669 (Ct. App. 1996)(trial judge commits reversible error when he fails to give requested charge on issue\r\n\r\nraised by indictment and evidence presented).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHarrison was charged with simple possession of cocaine.  The relevant powder cocaine statute prohibits only the possession\r\n\r\nof cocaine, and makes no mention of attempted possession.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(c) (1985)(\"It shall be unlawful\r\n\r\nfor any person knowingly or intentionally to possess a controlled substance unless the substance was obtained directly from,\r\n\r\nor pursuant to a valid prescription or order of, a practitioner while acting in the course of his professional practice, or except\r\n\r\nas otherwise authorized by this article.\").  While S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-420 (1985) prohibits an attempt to \"commit any\r\n\r\noffense made unlawful by the provisions of this article,\" the indictment against Harrison alleged only possession of cocaine,\r\n\r\nnot attempted possession, and the jury was instructed on actual or constructive possession, not attempted possession. \r\n\r\nHarrison's admission that he tried to purchase cocaine, therefore, cannot be considered an admission of guilt of the crime for\r\n\r\nwhich he was indicted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Harrison admitted he was attempting to buy the cocaine, he insisted the purchase was not completed.  Further, he\r\n\r\nmaintained the drugs were never in his possession or under his control.  See State v. Ballenger, 322 S.C. 196, 470 S.E.2d\r\n\r\n851 (1996)(possession may be actual or constructive; actual possession occurs when drugs are found to be in actual physical\r\n\r\ncustody of person charged with possession, while constructive possession occurs when person charged with possession has\r\n\r\ndominion and control over either the drugs or premises upon which the drugs are found); State v. Muhammed, 338 S.C. 22,\r\n\r\n524 S.E.2d 637 (Ct. App. 1999)(possession of drugs requires the drugs be found on the defendant's person or be under his\r\n\r\ndominion and control).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Officer Hathaway approached, Harrison and the other man were \"facing away from\" him.  Although Officer Hathaway\r\n\r\ntestified he saw Harrison drop the drugs, the disputed testimony of one witness does not amount to conclusive proof of guilt. \r\n\r\nMoreover, given the jury's repeated questions to the trial court, it is clear the jury wrestled with the question of Harrison's\r\n\r\nguilt.  The jury's struggle to apply the law to the facts and reach a verdict demonstrates the weakness in the State's case\r\n\r\nagainst Harrison.\r\n\r\nA different verdict might have been reached if the jury had been instructed that evidence of good character and good\r\n\r\nreputation may in and of itself create a doubt as to guilt and should be considered by the jury, along with all the other\r\n\r\nevidence, in determining the guilt or innocence of the defendant.  The State did not present overwhelming evidence of\r\n\r\nHarrison's possession of cocaine, and did not try him for attempting to possess cocaine.  Thus, the refusal to charge the\r\n\r\nrequested instruction regarding evidence of good character and reputation was not harmless, but was reversible error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nState v. Green, 278 S.C. 239, 294 S.E.2d 335 (1982), is distinguishable from the instant case.  In Green, the Court held the\r\n\r\nrefusal to instruct the jury on the issue of good character was not reversible error because the Court was \"not convinced that\r\n\r\nsuch refusal prejudiced the appellant.\"  Id. at 240, 294 S.E.2d at 335.  In contrast to Harrison, Green admitted his presence\r\n\r\nand participation in the charged crime and, from the whole record, his guilt was conclusively established.\r\nUnlike Green,\r\n\r\nthe paucity of evidence of Harrison's guilt is glaring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold a defendant is entitled to a jury instruction regarding evidence of good character and reputation when\r\n\r\nthis type of evidence is presented and the defendant requests the charge.  The trial court erred in failing to give\r\n\r\nthe requested charge regarding evidence of good character and good reputation.  The error was not harmless. \r\n\r\nAccordingly, Harrison's conviction for possession of cocaine is reversed and the case is remanded for a new\r\n\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGOOLSBY and HUFF, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Appeals"}]
