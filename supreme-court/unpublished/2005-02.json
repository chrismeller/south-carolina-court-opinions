Nellis, Op. No. 2003-UP-459 (S.C. Ct. App. \r\n  filed July 8, 2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found error and prejudice in the admission of \r\n  alleged prior bad acts committed upon the victim by respondent.Â  We agree.\r\n\r\nEvidence of other crimes must be put to a rather severe \r\n  test before admission.Â  The acid test of admissibility is the logical relevancy \r\n  of the other crimes.Â  The trial judge must clearly perceive the connection between \r\n  the other crimes and the crimes charged.Â  [Citation omitted].Â  Further, other \r\n  crimes which are not the subject of conviction must be proven by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence.Â  [Citation omitted].\r\n\r\n State v. Cutro, 332 S.C. \r\n  100, 103, 504 S.E.2d 324, 325 (1998).Â  \r\nThe victimâ€™s testimony was vague and inconsistent.Â  Whether there was logical \r\n  relevancy between the crime charged and the other alleged assaults is a close \r\n  question: whether there was clear and convincing evidence of these other incidents \r\n  is not.Â  The trial judge erred in admitting the prior bad acts evidence.Â  State \r\n  v. Cutro, supra.Â  The decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, \r\n  C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, \r\n  the prior bad acts committed upon the victim by Respondent are admissible.Â Â Â  \r\n  Therefore, I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals and uphold Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conviction.\r\nThe majority misconstrues the law to the extent that it holds \r\n  the prior bad acts by Respondent are not relevant.Â  In my opinion, the prior \r\n  bad acts are relevant and should be admitted.Â  I find the reasoning set forth \r\n  in State v. Weaverling to be persuasive.Â  337 S.C. 460, 468, 523 S.E.2d \r\n  787, 791 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  When a criminal defendantâ€™s prior bad acts are directed \r\n  toward the same victim and are very similar in nature, those acts are admissible \r\n  as a common scheme or plan.Â  State v. Weaverling, 337 S.C. at 468, 523 \r\n  S.E.2d at 791.Â  In Weaverling, the defendant repeatedly raped the same \r\n  child.Â  Id. at 465, 523 S.E.2d at 789.Â  The court of appeals held the \r\n  defendantâ€™s prior acts were admissible even though the acts were not charged.Â  \r\n  Id. at 468, 523 S.E.2d at 791.Â  The court reasoned that â€œ[w]here the \r\n  evidence is of such a close similarity to the charged offense that the previous \r\n  act enhances the probative value of the evidence so as to overrule the prejudicial \r\n  effect, it is admissible.â€ Id.Â  (citing State v. Raffaldt, 318 \r\n  S.C. 110, 456 S.E.2d 390 (1995)).Â  Moreover, the admission of evidence in a \r\n  criminal prosecution is within the discretion of the trial court, and its ruling \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal unless an abuse of discretion is shown.Â  State \r\n  v. Wright, 322 S.C. 253, 255, 471 S.E.2d 700, 701 (1996).\r\nIn the present case, evidence was presented that the same \r\n  victim was attacked on several occasions.Â  However, none of the prior incidents \r\n  were reported or charged.Â  In my opinion, these prior acts should be admitted \r\n  to show a common plan or scheme and any prejudice from the admission of the \r\n  evidence would be outweighed by its probative value.Â  \r\nFurther, in my opinion, the victimâ€™s testimony was not vague \r\n  and inconsistent.Â  The victim testified that Respondent raped her on several \r\n  occasions, in the same manner.Â  The victim testified further that on all prior \r\n  occasions and the incident that led to charges, Respondent attacked the victim \r\n  at the home.Â  Accordingly, it is my opinion that prior bad acts were shown by \r\n  clear and convincing evidence.\r\nTherefore, in my opinion, the Respondentâ€™s prior bad acts \r\n  were properly admitted by the trial court.Â  Accordingly, I would affirm the \r\n  ruling of the trial judge and uphold Respondentâ€™s conviction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-009","title":"Kaiser v.

[1]  The coupleâ€™s only child, Collin \r\n  Kaiser (â€œChildâ€), was born September 9, 1999.Â  Father owns a pest control business \r\n  on Hilton Head Island, and Mother did not work during the marriage after she \r\n  became pregnant with Child.Â  \r\nThe parties separated in May 2001 and on September 7, 2001, \r\n  the family court issued a Pendente Lite Order granting Wife $3,000 per month \r\n  alimony, possession of the marital home, and custody of Child.Â  In December \r\n  2001, Father moved to terminate the alimony on the ground that Mother had engaged \r\n  in adulterous conduct with two men after the commencement of this divorce action.Â Â  \r\n  Mother admitted she had a sexual relationship with one of the men and alleged \r\n  she has a continuing platonic relationship with the other.Â  \r\nOn January 17, 2002, because of the admitted adultery, the \r\n  family court terminated Motherâ€™s alimony and ordered reimbursement of the previously \r\n  paid alimony.Â  The family court entered its final order on August 20, 2002, \r\n  and awarded Mother custody of Child. Father appeals. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the family court err in granting custody of Child to \r\n  Mother?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION \r\nFather contends the family court erred in granting Mother \r\n  custody of Child.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWhere a family court order is appealed, this Court has jurisdiction \r\n  to find facts based on its own view of the preponderance of the evidence. Patel \r\n  v. Patel, 359 S.C. 515,Â  522, 599 S.E.2d 114, 118Â  (2004).Â  The paramount \r\n  and controlling factor in every custody dispute is the best interest of the \r\n  child.Â  Hooper v. Rockwell, 334 S.C. 281, 513 S.E.2d 358 (1999).Â  In \r\n  determining the best interest of the child in a custody dispute, the family \r\n  court should consider several factors, including: who has been the primary caretaker; \r\n  the conduct, attributes, and fitness of the parents; the opinions of third parties \r\n  (including the guardian, expert witnesses, and the children); and the age, health, \r\n  and sex of the children.Â  Patel, 347 S.C. at 285, 555 S.E.2d at 388. \r\n\r\nFather contends the family court erred in awarding Mother \r\n  custody of Child.Â  Father summarizes his reasons Mother should not have been \r\n  awarded custody:Â  â€œMother 1)Â  has a history of substance abuse, 2) is an alcoholic, \r\n  3) is sexually promiscuous, 3) (sic) suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder, \r\n  4) has attempted suicide and threatened to commit suicide, 5) is a mother whose \r\n  selfish behavior has exposed her son to various men of questionable characters, \r\n  6) lied to the court, 7) has no respect for the Courtâ€™s Orders, and 8)Â  moreover, \r\n  this is a mother who has no respect for herself or her son.â€  \r\n  [2] Â  \r\nWithout a doubt, Mother has had some emotional and mental \r\n  problems. [3] Â  Prior to the partiesâ€™ \r\n  marriage, Mother attempted suicide and was hospitalized for one night at the \r\n  State Mental Hospital.Â  She was sexually abused as a child by her babysitters, \r\n  and her psychologist, Dr. Marion Oâ€™Neill, has diagnosed her with post-traumatic \r\n  stress disorder (PTSD) caused by this abuse.Â  She also has been diagnosed with \r\n  a histrionics type personality. [4] Â  She is now a recovering alcoholic and regularly \r\n  attends AA.Â  \r\nBoth the Guardian ad Litem (GAL) and the court-appointed \r\n  psychologist, Dr. David Brandt, recommended that Father be awarded custody. \r\n   [5]  The GAL was concerned about Motherâ€™s relationships \r\n  with men and that if Mother was given custody she would â€œlikely limit contact \r\n  with [Father] rather than seeking to expand such contactâ€ and thus he recommended \r\n  Father be granted custody.Â  The GAL noted that Mother had a post-separation \r\n  sexual affair with Bruce Pitkin, the investigator working on this case.Â  Mother \r\n  admitted to this relationship.Â  Additionally, there were allegations that Mother \r\n  had a sexual relationship with Eddie Bergeron, whom she met at an AA meeting.Â  \r\n  Bergeron and Mother deny their relationship has been sexual.Â  However, as the \r\n  GAL noted Mother and Bergeron have taken overnight trips and spent the night \r\n  together under circumstances â€œstrongly suggesting an ongoing and romantic and \r\n  sexual relationship.â€Â  Further, Bergeron acknowledges having romantic feelings \r\n  for Mother. Mother acknowledges that both men have been in the Childâ€™s presence. \r\n\r\nDr. Brandt found the custody issue a close call, but he \r\n  eventually recommended Father be given custody because he believed Father would \r\n  be more likely to share Child with Mother.Â  Additionally, he was very concerned \r\n  with Motherâ€™s exposure of Child to her paramours.Â  Dr. Brandt was concerned \r\n  about Childâ€™s potential sense of loss when Mother stopped seeing the men.Â  \r\nThe family court rejected the GAL's and Dr. Brandtâ€™s recommendations.Â  \r\n  We recognize that rather than merely adopting the recommendation of the GAL \r\n  or psychologist, the court, by its own review of all the evidence, should consider \r\n  the character, fitness, attitude, and inclinations on the part of each parent \r\n  as they impact the child as well as all psychological, physical, environmental, \r\n  spiritual, educational, medical, family, emotional and recreational aspects \r\n  of the child's life. See Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 11, 471 \r\n  S.E.2d 154, 157 (1996). The role of the GAL and psychologist in making custody \r\n  recommendations is to aid, not direct, the court.Â  Ultimately, the custody decision \r\n  lies with the trial judge. See Shainwald v. Shainwald, 302 S.C. \r\n  453, 395 S.E.2d 441 (Ct.App.1990) (GAL does not usurp judge's function). \r\nÂ Here, the family court judge specifically stated that he \r\n  placed the greatest of weight upon Mother being the primary caretaker of the \r\n  child from birth. Although the family court judge recited that he had â€œconsidered \r\n  the character, fitness, attitudes and inclinations on the part of each parent \r\n  as they impact the childâ€ and reviewed the expert witness reports, he does not \r\n  explain why he rejects the opinions of the GAL and psychologist.Â  It is apparent \r\n  the family court judge placed all the weight on who was the primary caretaker.Â  \r\n  The family court judge found Wifeâ€™s conduct with her paramour to be â€œinappropriate \r\n  and not in the best interests of the child.â€ Yet, he did not address this or \r\n  consider Motherâ€™s instability and continuing inappropriate behavior when he \r\n  awarded custody of Child.\r\nWe have reviewed the record and determine that it is in \r\n  the best interest of the Child for custody to be given to Father. The custody \r\n  decision here essentially turned on the single factor of Mother having been \r\n  the primary caretaker of the Child to the exclusion of the rest of the evidence \r\n  in the record.Â  Mother has demonstrated her continuing instability and inappropriate \r\n  behavior through her relationships with various men and the impact on the Child \r\n  cannot be overlooked.Â  We agree with the GAL and Dr. Brandt that Father should \r\n  be given custody of Child.Â  Accordingly, we reverse and remand for the family \r\n  court to award custody to Father and establish visitation for Mother.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Father has two children from his first marriage \r\n    who live with their mother.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Mother repeatedly states in her brief that several \r\n    issues are not properly before the Court.Â  Specifically, she alleges that \r\n    Father has failed to set forth these issues in his statement of the issue \r\n    on appeal pursuant to Rule 208 (b)(1), SCACR.Â  We disagree.Â  Father alleges \r\n    the family court abused its discretion for numerous reasons which are clearly \r\n    encompassed by the broader issue on appeal of whether the family court erred \r\n    in awarding Mother custody. See Henson v. Inatâ€™l Paper Co., \r\n    358 S.C. 133, 142, 594 S.E.2d 499, 503 (Ct. App. 2004) (distinguishing case \r\n    where appellant challenged two separate rulings made by trial court).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  We recognize Father also has engaged in some questionable \r\n    behavior.Â  However, most of this behavior was prior to the birth of Child.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] A histrionic personality is characterized by inappropriate \r\n    sexual behavior and the need to be the center of attention.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] The GAL issued two reports and in both he recommended \r\n    that Father be given custody of Child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-010","title":"Sullivan v.
