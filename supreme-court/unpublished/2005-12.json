State, 363 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974), finding that laches did not bar that allegation.Â  Both Deleston and the State seek writs of certiorari.\r\nThe evidence does not support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Deleston was entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues.Â  In addition, the judge erred in failing to find that Delestonâ€™s application was barred by laches.Â  Accordingly, we grant the petitions for writs of certiorari, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the order of the PCR judge.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 (Supp. 2004).Â  See also Dove v.

Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1800(A).Â  The correct statute to be applied to cases involving adoptions that occur prior to June 11, 1999, is S.C. Code Ann.
