Petitioner argues an acceptance of an offer of judgment does not\r\nprevent appellate review of that judgment or of intermediate orders underlying that\r\njudgment. We disagree and affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities: Belton v. State, 339 S.C. 71, 74 n.4, 529 S.E.2d 4, 5 n.4\r\n(2000) (stating that \"[a] case resolved by acceptance of an offer of judgment is\r\nconsidered 'settled'\"); Shelton v. Bressant, 312 S.C. 183, 184, 439 S.E.2d 833, 834\r\n(1993) (stating that absent fraud or mistake, where an attorney of record for a party\r\nagrees to settle a case, the party cannot later rescind the settlement); S.C. State\r\nHighway Dep't v. McKeown Food Store No. 9, 254 S.C. 180, 183, 174 S.E.2d 342,\r\n343–44 (1970) (finding where a case has been \"settled,\" the settlement ends the\r\nlitigation and renders moot an appeal of an intermediate order concerning pretrial\r\nprocedures); Johnson v. Johnson, 310 S.C. 44, 46, 425 S.E.2d 46, 48 (Ct. App.\r\n1992) (stating that generally, where a judgment or order is entered by consent, it is\r\nbinding and conclusive and cannot be attacked by the parties by direct appeal); see\r\nalso Chewning v.

Riley, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\n\r\n        Bruce Wyche Bannister, of Bannister & Wyatt, LLC, of\r\n        Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the Court of\r\nAppeals' decision in Ruff v. Nunez, Op. No. 2013-UP-290 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June\r\n26, 2013).\r\n\r\nWe deny the petition for a writ of certiorari as to all questions other than the\r\nparties' responsibility for payment of transportation costs for visitation and\r\nGuardian ad litem's fees. As to the issues of transportation costs for visitation and\r\nGuardian ad litem's fees, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with\r\nfurther briefing, and reverse the Court of Appeals' decision that petitioner is\r\nresponsible for all such costs.\r\n\r\nAt the final hearing, respondent proposed a visitation plan in which the parties\r\nwould split transportation costs for visitation equally. However, the family court\r\nrejected this proposal and ordered that respondent only pay transportation costs for\r\nrespondent's two-week summer visitation with the child, and that petitioner pay all\r\nother transportation costs, which required petitioner to pay a disproportionate\r\namount in transportation costs. Based on our de novo review of the evidence, we\r\nfind the family court abused its discretion in requiring petitioner to pay costs in the\r\namount set forth in its order, and we order that the parties split all visitation\r\ntransportation costs equally. See Argabright v. Argabright, 398 S.C. 176, 179, 727\r\nS.E.2d 748, 750 (2012) (holding an appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts in\r\naccordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence); Cudd v. Arline,\r\n277 S.C. 236, 239, 285 S.E.2d 881, 883 (1981) (holding an order concerning\r\nvisitation costs will be reversed where there is a clear abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\nWe further find the family court abused its discretion in ordering that petitioner is\r\nrequired to pay all of the Guardian ad litem's fees, and we order that the parties\r\nequally split the Guardian ad litem's fees. See Shirley v. Shirley, 342 S.C. 324,\r\n341, 536 S.E.2d 427, 436 (Ct. App. 2000) (holding an award of Guardian ad litem\r\nfees lies within the sound discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed\r\non appeal absent an abuse of discretion).\r\n\r\nREVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
