Peeples, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2005-MO-029\r\nHeard January 5, 2005 â€“ Filed June 20, 2005\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Charles Franklin Thompson, Jr., of Malone &amp; Thompson, LLC, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        J. Charles Ormond, Jr., of Holler, Dennis, Corbett, Ormond &amp; Garner, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review Willis v. Aiken, Op. No. 2003-UP-489 (S.C. Ct. App. filed August 20, 2003), in which the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Petitioner City of Aiken.Â  While we disagree with the basis of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion, we affirm its result.\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that the language of the Department Manual is â€œarguablyâ€ mandatory with respect to disciplinary procedures.Â  The court therefore held that there is a genuine issue of material fact whether the at-will status of Willisâ€™s employment was altered.Â  We disagree.Â  Looking solely at the City Handbook and the Department Manual, no issue of material fact is present.Â  \r\nHowever, Willis has introduced evidence that his supervisors orally represented that the disciplinary procedures in the Department Manual were mandatory.Â  Willis has also introduced evidence that he was generally aware of the procedures to which his supervisors were referring.Â  This evidence raises genuine issues of material fact that render summary judgment inappropriate.Â  See Prescott v. Farmers Tel. Coop., 335 S.C. 330, 335-36, 516 S.E.2d 923, 926 (1999) (an oral representation can constitute an offer to alter at-will employment); Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 484-85, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454-55 (1987) (an oral representation that certain policies will be followed prior to termination may constitute an offer to alter at-will employment).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER and BURNETT, concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the department policy manual did not alter Respondentâ€™s at-will employment status because Respondent did not rely upon the provisions of the manual related to the disciplinary procedure.Â  Therefore, I would reverse the decision of the court of appeals and affirm the trial courtâ€™s order granting summary judgment for the City of Aiken.\r\nIt is well settled that even with the existence of a disclaimer in an employee handbook, other evidence or statements may alter an otherwise at-will employment status.Â  See Small v. Springs Indus., Inc., 292 S.C. 481, 484-85, 357 S.E.2d 452, 454-455 (1987) (holding that oral assurance from a supervisor that certain policies would be followed prior to termination may create a contract altering an at-will agreement).Â  However, in order to alter the employeeâ€™s at-will status and create a unilateral contract, the employee must rely upon the employerâ€™s additional assurances.Â  See id. at 484-85, 357 S.E.2d at 454 (stating that action in forbearance in reliance on employerâ€™s promise was sufficient consideration to make the promise binding).\r\nIn the present case, the City of Aiken issued a handbook that contained conspicuous disclaimer stating that the handbook was not a contract.Â  In addition, the City issued a department policy manual, which provided that employees must adhere to specific guidelines, but did not contain a disclaimer.\r\nRespondent argues that the policy manual altered his at-will employment status.Â  But Respondent presented no evidence that he actually relied upon the language in the manual.Â  In my view, therefore, there is no question of fact as to whether Respondentâ€™s at-will status was changed.Â  As a result, I would reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-030","title":"Beaufort County v.

Carter, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The State seeks a writ of certiorari following the denial of its petition for rehearing to the Court of Appeals.Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and vacate the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nRespondent was indicted for two counts of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the first degree.Â  He pled guilty to committing a lewd act on a child on both indictments.Â  Separate indictments charging respondent with committing a lewd act on a child were not prepared and the original CSC indictments were not amended to reflect the lewd act charges to which respondent was pleading guilty.Â  Rather, the lewd act charges were noted on respondentâ€™s sentencing sheets along with his signed waiver of presentment to those charges.Â Â  Respondent received concurrent fifteen year terms of imprisonment.\r\nThe Court of Appeals, relying on its prior decision in State v. Smalls, 354 S.C. 498, 581 S.E.2d 850 (Ct. App. 2003), found that simply listing the lewd act charge on the sentencing sheets signed by respondent did not satisfy the requirements governing acceptance of guilty pleas and vacated respondentâ€™s pleas for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  State v. Holston, Op. No. 2003-UP-593 (S.C. Ct. App. filed October 9, 2003).Â  \r\nThe State contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding the circuit court without subject matter jurisdiction to accept respondentâ€™s guilty pleas.Â  Specifically, the State argues that after the grand jury returned a true bill it was not necessary to prepare a new indictment for respondent to waive presentment and plead guilty to the lewd act charges.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn State v. Smalls, Op. No. 25988 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 23, 2005) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 21 at 37), the Court ruled upon this very issue.Â  The Court held that â€œsigning a sentencing sheet for a charge to which a defendant has pled guilty constitutes a valid written waiver of presentment.â€Â  The material facts of this case are identical to Smalls.Â  Accordingly, respondentâ€™s signed sentencing sheet constitutes a valid waiver of presentment and the Court of Appeals erred in vacating his guilty pleas for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We therefore vacate the opinion of the Court of Appeals.Â Â  \r\nVACATED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-033","title":"Curry v.
