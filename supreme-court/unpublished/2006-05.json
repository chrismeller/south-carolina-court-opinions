Mitchell Brown, of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Columbia, and Jeffrey W. Newman, of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\nC. Steven Moskos, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Finding appellants[1] violated the Magnuson-Moss Act (Act),[2] a jury awarded respondents $17,126.40 actual damages and $17,200 for incidental and consequential damages.[3]Â  The circuit court subsequently granted respondents $73,050 for attorneysâ€™ fees and $3,282.32 for costs pursuant to the Act.Â  We affirm the actual damages and the attorneysâ€™ fee awards, but reverse the $17,200 incidental/consequential damages verdict because we hold appellantsâ€™ warranty effectively disclaimed these types of damages.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe evidence showed that respondents purchased a new 1999 Jeep Cherokee in December 1998 for $15,408.50.Â  In August 1999 respondents brought the Jeep to the dealer who repaired a problem with the alternator.Â  Over the next twenty months or so respondents brought the Jeep back to the dealer with various problems.Â  Respondents brought the Jeep in seven times between September 1999 and December 2000 complaining that the defroster did not work and/or that the speedometer â€œwent out.â€\r\nIn September 2000 respondents sent a letter â€œrevokingâ€ acceptance of the Jeep.Â  They continued to drive it, however, and to make payments.Â  The last payment was made in February 2001, at which point the Jeep had approximately 36,000 miles on it.Â  Respondents drove the vehicle about another 6,000 miles.Â  Car payments totaling approximately $6,400 were made, and respondents paid the dealership only for routine maintenance and not for any repairs on the vehicle.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        1)\r\n         Whether the trial court erred in permitting the actual damages award to stand?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        2)&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the trial court erred in finding appellantsâ€™ disclaimer of incidental and consequential damages ineffective?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        3)&nbsp;\r\n         Whether the attorneysâ€™ fee award should be reduced?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Actual Damages\r\nAppellants raise two contentions regarding the amount of the actual damages award.Â  First, they contend that they were entitled to a directed verdict or judgment non obstante verdicto (JNOV) because respondents failed to prove actual damages.Â  We have reviewed the record and find that appellantsâ€™ motion for a directed verdict on the Magnuson-Moss Act claim was made solely on one ground: that respondents failed to give statutory notice required by the Act.Â  A party may not argue one ground at trial and another on appeal.Â  E.g., Hanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997).Â  Further, to the extent appellants now seek a new trial nisi remittitur, their post-trial motion does not argue for this relief under the Act.Â  It is axiomatic that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for appellate review.Â  E.g., Elam v. SCDOT, 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004).Â  No issue regarding the sufficiency of the evidence of actual damages is before the Court.\r\nAppellants next contend the juryâ€™s actual damages award should have been set aside and a new trial granted because it was â€œexcessive and speculative as a matter of law.â€Â  The record demonstrates that appellants did not seek a new trial under the Act because of any perceived flaw in the juryâ€™s actual damages verdict.Â  Since this assertion of error is raised for the first time on appeal, we do not address it.Â  Elam, supra.\r\nWe affirm the actual damages award.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Incidental/Consequential Damages\r\nThe trial court initially granted appellantsâ€™ directed verdict motion on respondentsâ€™ claim for incidental and consequential damages under the Act, but upon reconsideration reversed that decision, finding that under the Act a limitation of such damages must appear on the face of the warranty itself.Â  See 16 C.F.R. 703.1(h).Â  At the close of the evidence, appellants renewed their request for a directed verdict on the incidental and consequential damages claim asserting that their warranty effectively disclaimed these damages.Â  The circuit court again denied the motion, relying on 16 C.F.R. 703.1(h). Â Appellants contend this C.F.R is inapplicable, and that their warranty effectively excluded these damages.Â  We agree, and reverse the $17,200 award.Â  \r\nThe Act requires a supplier who gives a written warranty covering a consumer product costing the consumer more than $10 to meet certain requirements.Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 2303.Â  If the warranty meets the minimum standards set forth in Â§ 2304 of the Act it must be conspicuously designated a full warranty; anything less must be designated a limited warranty.Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 2303(a).Â  There is no dispute that the warranty at issue here is a limited one.\r\nAt trial and in their appellantsâ€™ brief, appellants contend the trial court misapplied a regulation applicable only to full warranties to find ineffectual the disclaimer of damages in their limited warranty.Â  We agree with appellants that 16 C.F.R. 703.1(h), requiring that any exclusion of incidental and consequential damages appear on the face of the warranty, does not apply to limited warranties.Â  See Sorce v. Naperville Jeep Eagle, Inc., 309 Ill. App. 3d 313, 722 N.E.2d 227 (Ill. Ct. App. 1999).Â  \r\nIn brief, respondents have abandoned reliance on the C.F.R., arguing instead that the award of incidental and consequential damages under the Act should be sustained because the warranty â€œfailed of its essential purpose.â€[4]Â  The record does not permit us to affirm the award on this ground pursuant to Rule 220(c), SCACR (Court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record).\r\nThe record contains only part of the jury charge.Â  When the jury charge commences in the record, it appears that the court is nearly done charging the jury on the definition of incidental damages.Â  Following a one paragraph explanation of consequential damages, the court charged this language from S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(c):\r\n\r\nNow, I further charge you that where circumstances cause an exclusive or limited remedy to fail for its essential purpose, remedy may be had as provided in this Act.\r\n\r\nThis isolated sentence, which neither defines the phrase â€œfail for its essential purpose,â€ nor relates the failure to incidental or consequential damages, did not instruct the jury that a â€œfailureâ€ would justify an award of incidental and consequential damages.\r\nFurther, the jury was given a special verdict form.Â  Under the charging algorithm, the jury was told:\r\n\r\nNumber four [on the verdict form] says, â€œHave Plaintiffs proved by a preponderance of the evidence that there has been a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty?â€Â  You must answer â€˜yesâ€™ or â€˜no.â€™\r\nIf your answer to number four is â€œyesâ€, then you will proceed to number five wherein you will determine what amount, if any, of incidental or consequential damages did the plaintiffs suffer.\r\nOr if your answer to number four is â€œNoâ€, then you would stop.\r\nWith regards to number five, then you will consider number five if you find, again by the preponderance of the evidence, that the defendants, if there has been a violation of the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act, then you will consider what, if any, incidental or consequential damages, as I have defined for you, did the plaintiffs suffer.\r\nAnd if you find that they have proved, by a preponderance of the evidence, that they have suffered incidental or consequential damages, then you will indicate those damages on the line provided; again in numbers and in words, like you would a check.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThis record cannot fairly be read to support the conclusion that the jury awarded respondents consequential and incidental damages under the Act because it found the limited warranty failed of its essential purpose,[5] rather than because it concluded appellants had violated the Act itself.\r\nThe award of $17,200 for incidental and consequential damages is reversed.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Attorneysâ€™ Fee\r\nThe Act permits the court to award as part of the judgment â€œa sum equal to the aggregate amount of costs and expenses (including attorneysâ€™ fees based on actual time expended) determined by the court to have been reasonably incurred by the plaintiffâ€¦unless the court in its discretion shall determine that such an award of attorneysâ€™ fees would be inappropriate.â€Â  15 U.S.C. Â§ 2310(d)(2).Â  Appellants appeal the award of $73,050 in attorneysâ€™ fees under the Act.Â  While we are troubled by the amount of the award, appellants have failed to preserve for appeal the arguments they now raise.Â  Hanahan v. Simpson, supra.\r\nRespondentsâ€™ attorney filed an affidavit and supporting documents seeking $71,932.32 in fees and costs.[6]Â  Appellants filed a memorandum in opposition, acknowledging that the Act permits the award of fees and costs, that the Act does not outline a method for determining the amount, and suggesting the court apply the six-factor analysis adopted by state case law.[7]Â  Following a hearing on this issue, there was an exchange of acrimonious letters and finally an order awarding fees and costs utilizing the six-factor test was filed.\r\nAppellants now contend the entire fee award should be vacated, citing Mockabee v. Wakefield Buick, 298 S.C. 386, 380 S.E.2d 848 (Ct. App. 1989), because respondents failed to provide notice and an opportunity to cure the defect as required by the Act.Â  This issue was neither raised nor ruled on below, and is therefore not before the Court in this appeal.Â  Elam, supra. \r\nAppellants next contend the trial court erred in permitting respondentsâ€™ counsel to recover fees for time spent on unsuccessful claims, in pursuit of claims against respondent Chrysler Financial, and time spent on unsuccessful motions.Â  In brief, appellants cite for the first time case law holding that fees attributable to unsuccessful claims and unsuccessful motions are not recoverable under the Act.Â  As respondents point out, these cases were not called to the trial courtâ€™s attention: This issue was tried to the trial court as if it were governed solely by South Carolina common law principles, with no reference to attorneysâ€™ fees decisions under the Act. \r\nIn South Carolina, where claims are intertwined and not all allow an award of fees and costs, the moving party must present an itemized affidavit of attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  The burden then shifts to the opposing party to show which fees are â€œclearly unrelated.â€Â  See Taylor v. Nix, 307 S.C. 551, 416 S.E.2d 619 (1992).Â  Respondentsâ€™ counsel presented an affidavit.Â  While appellants stated in their memorandum in opposition that the affidavit did not adequately differentiate the work attributable to different claims, this issue was not pursued nor was there any ruling by the trial court on the affidavitâ€™s sufficiency.Â  Accordingly, appellants cannot now complain about the affidavitâ€™s precision.Â  Elam, supra.\r\nThe trial court, with appellantsâ€™ assent, decided the attorneysâ€™ fee award using state law principles without reference to judicial decision interpreting the Act.Â  Appellants did not meet their burden under Taylor v. Nix, supra, of demonstrating to the trial judge what part of respondentsâ€™ counselâ€™s fees were clearly unrelated to the Act.Â  Under these circumstances, we must affirm the award.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the actual damages and the attorneysâ€™ fee awards, and reverse the award of incidental and consequential damages.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellants are the vehicleâ€™s manufacturer, the dealership that sold the vehicle, and the finance company that financed its acquisition.\r\n[2] 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 2301 et seq. (1998).\r\n[3] Although the case was submitted to the jury on several theories, we are only concerned with the Act on appeal.\r\n[4] â€œA warranty fails of its essential purpose if the seller is unwilling or unable to repair or replace the product or if there is an unreasonable delay in the repair or replacement of the product.â€Â  Herring v. Home Depot, Inc., 350 S.C. 373, 565 S.E.2d 773 (2002).\r\n[5] Since we do not conclude the jury made this finding, we need not decide whether an otherwise conscionable limitation or exclusion of consequential damages in a warranty is voided where that warranty fails of its essential purpose.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-2-719(2) and (3); Sorce v. Naperville Jeep Eagle, Inc., supra.\r\n[6] The additional portion of the award represents fees and costs incurred in the post-trial proceedings.\r\n[7] See, e.g., Baron Data Systems, Inc. v.

Clare, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge granted relief to Kenneth M. Wigfall (Respondent), finding his trial attorney ineffective in failing to call two witnesses who would have supported Respondentâ€™s claim he acted in self-defense.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent lived at a Jasper County mobile home rented by his aunt, Lottie Jordan.Â  Two other men, Randy Brown (Randy) and Cleveland Brown (Victim), who are not related, also lived with Ms. Jordan.Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s primary defense at trial was that he acted in self-defense and the stabbing was an accident.Â  Respondent testified he returned home at about 10:30 p.m. on September 20, 1998, after attending a fish fry where he consumed alcoholic drinks.Â  Additionally, he was taking prescription medication because he had been in a recent automobile accident. \r\nVictim apparently overheard Respondent argue with his aunt about Respondentâ€™s use of her car.Â  Respondent testified he heard Victim, who was in an adjoining bedroom, say, â€œIâ€™ll shoot that n_____.â€Â  Respondent grabbed a knife and went to the door of Victimâ€™s room, where he saw Victim reaching across the bed for what Respondent believed was a gun.Â  Respondent dove across the bed, grabbed Victim and pulled Victim toward him; as he did, Victim was accidentally stabbed in the chest with the knife.Â  Respondent testified he was afraid of Victim based on his knowledge of Victimâ€™s violent tendencies and the belief Victim had a gun, but he only meant to disarm Victim and did not intend to harm him.Â  Respondent admitted he never saw a weapon.Â  \r\nRespondent testified of several incidents in which Victim was argumentative or threatened violence toward others, including Randy. Respondent further had been told of a handgun and another rifle or shotgun in the Victimâ€™s bedroom.Â  Investigators did not find any firearms in the mobile home on the night of the stabbing.Â  \r\nMs. Jordan testified Respondent was a disagreeable person and the aggressor in past disputes with Victim.Â  She described Victim as a â€œvery quietâ€ man.Â  Ms. Jordan denied Victim was a violent person or that he had ever threatened anyone with a knife.Â  She testified Victim described Randy Brown as his â€œbrother.â€Â  Ms. Jordan denied knowing Victim had ever shot anyone in the past, and asserted she did not know about his reputation in the community.Â  On cross-examination, Ms. Jordan testified that Victim, while drunk, previously had pointed a gun at her, and that she had called authorities on two occasions to remove Victim from the house.Â  \r\nMs. Jordan testified that, while arguing about the car on the night of the stabbing, Respondent angrily kicked over the kitchen table and said, â€Iâ€™ll kill you, b___,â€ and put a knife to her chest.Â  Respondent said he was going to â€œkill this gray-headed m_____f_____,â€ ran directly into Victimâ€™s room, and stabbed him in the chest as he lay sleeping.Â  Ms. Jordan testified Respondent had both a knife and a gun that night, and threatened to kill her and Randy after the stabbing.[1]Â  Ms. Jordan denied Victim threatened to shoot Respondent immediately before the fatal stabbing. \r\nRandy Brown testified he heard Respondent argue with Ms. Jordan about the use of her car.Â  He did not witness the stabbing but heard Ms. Jordan yell for someone to call the police, and then a table overturned.Â  He denied seeing Victim with a gun previously and did not hear Victim threaten Respondent that night.Â  Randy testified Victim had shot someone previously, but did not offer testimony corroborating Respondentâ€™s assertions that Victim had threatened Randy. \r\nSheriffâ€™s and emergency officials testified at trial that Respondent appeared â€œspacey,â€ â€œbelligerent,â€ and â€œsomewhat intoxicatedâ€ when arrested, but he did not resist arrest.Â  Respondent became â€œwildâ€ and began cursing Â while seated in the rear of a police cruiser, kicking out a rear passenger window.Â  Respondent may have been angered by officersâ€™ refusal to loosen tight handcuffs.Â  \r\nAn autopsy revealed Victim had a blood alcohol level of 0.10 at the time of death.Â  A urine drug screen tested positive for barbiturates and ephedrine/pseudoephedrine, a cold or sinus medication sold as Sudafed. \r\nA jury convicted Respondent of voluntary manslaughter.Â  He was sentenced to twenty-seven years in prison.Â  This Court affirmed the conviction and sentence.Â  State v. Wigfall, Op. No. 2001-MO-019 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 20, 2001).\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Respondent presented his own testimony, the testimony of Lillie Mae Brown[2] and a stipulation regarding the testimony of Joseph Johnson.\r\nRespondent offered similar testimony to that which he offered at trial regarding his background, his knowledge of Victimâ€™s reputation for violence, and the circumstances of the fatal stabbing.Â  Respondent testified he asked his attorney to call Johnson and Lillie Mae Brown. Â Respondentâ€™s attorney testified he did not recall interviewing the witnesses and had no record of them in his file. \r\nThe parties stipulated that Johnson, Ms. Jordanâ€™s next-door neighbor and landlord, would have testified Victim came to his house carrying a gun about two weeks before the fatal stabbing.Â  Victim told Johnson â€œhe wanted to leave that house.â€Â  Victim drank a beer and fell asleep.Â  Johnson removed the gun from Victimâ€™s presence and returned the weapon to Ms. Jordanâ€™s home the next day, handing it to Respondent and another person. \r\nLillie Mae Brown testified she was in Ms. Jordanâ€™s car with Respondent and Victim when Victim began cursing Respondent and threatening to kill him.Â  While Respondent was in a store, Victim â€œkept on saying, Yeah, heâ€™s a dead man, and he started cursing me, threatening me, telling me what he was gonna do to me.â€Â  Respondent returned to the car to calm Ms. Brown and Victim, but Victim continued to curse and threaten Respondent.Â  Ms. Brown testified Victim had a reputation in the community for violence, for â€œslitting people.â€ \r\nThe PCR judge granted relief to Respondent, finding his trial attorney was ineffective in failing to call the two witnesses who would have supported Respondentâ€™s claim that he acted in self-defense.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes any evidence of probative value support the PCR judgeâ€™s grant of relief to Respondent?\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in granting relief to Respondent.Â  We agree.\r\nA defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  There is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the case.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, an applicant must show that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial would have been different.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-694; Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 480 S.E.2d 733 (1997).Â  Thus, an applicant must show both error and prejudice to be entitled to relief in a PCR proceeding.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687-94; Scott v. State, 334 S.C. 248, 513 S.E.2d 100 (1999).\r\nThe burden is on the applicant in a post-conviction proceeding to prove the allegations in his application.Â \r\nButler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).Â  An appellate court will affirm the PCR courtâ€™s decision when its findings are supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry, 300 S.C. at 119, 386 S.E.2d at 626.Â  However, an appellate court will not affirm the decision when it is not supported by any probative evidence.Â \r\nHolland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nWe conclude the record does not contain probative evidence supporting the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.Â  While Respondent arguably has shown his attorney erred in not calling the two witnesses presented at the PCR hearing, Respondent has failed to show prejudice.\r\nRespondent has failed to prove there is a reasonable probability the outcome of the trial would have been different had the two witnesses testified.Â  The testimony of the two witnesses is largely cumulative to information presented to the jury at trial, i.e., Victim was a hard-drinking man with violent tendencies who previously had threatened to kill or harm Respondent.Â  Respondentâ€™s testimony and, to a lesser degree, the testimony of Ms. Jordan and Randy Brown on cross-examination, adequately conveyed this information to the jury.Â  Consequently, evidence of probative value does not support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the ruling of the PCR judge granting a new trial to Respondent.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, Â and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent testified he kicked over a coffee table after the stabbing, but denied threatening to kill Victim, Ms. Jordan, or Randy.\r\n[2]Â  The Victim, Cleveland Brown; the mobile home roommate, Randy Brown; and Respondentâ€™s PCR witness, Lillie Mae Brown, apparently are not related.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-018","title":"Shannon v.

Flanary, Op. No. 2004-UP-613 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 7, 2004).Â  Judge Stilwell filed a dissenting opinion.\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in failing to find that the family court made a mathematical error which resulted in an inequitable division of the marital estate and then wrongfully refused to correct that error on a motion for reconsideration.\r\nWhile we note that petitioner is correct that the calculations in the family courtâ€™s order contain a mathematical error,[1] we agree with the Court of Appeals that the overall division ordered by the family court is equitable and clearly delineates the marital assets and debts apportioned to each party.Â  We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In explaining the effect of its distribution of the marital estate, the family court stated petitioner was awarded a net estate of $222,632.39 and respondent a net estate of $215,501.28, which would reflect the division of a total net estate of $438,133.67.Â  This result is clearly erroneous in light of the fact that there was only a total net estate of $286,743.25 to divide.Â  The family courtâ€™s order clearly reveals marital property totaling $1,224,521 and marital debt totaling $937,777.75.Â  Therefore, the net marital estate is only $286,743.25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-020","title":"Myrtle Beach Shrine Club v.

(Horry Club) is â€œsubordinate to the jurisdiction and control of the Omar Temple,â€ and that a 1993 lease agreement between Myrtle Beach Club and Horry Club is effective and binding.Â  On motions for summary judgment, the trial judge granted judgment to Horry Club.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nHorry Club was originally incorporated in 1951 as an eleemosynary corporation.Â  The clubâ€™s current bylaws require that all prospective Horry Club members be members of Omar Temple and Myrtle Beach Club.[1]Â  There is nothing in the bylaws, however, indicating Horry Clubâ€™s intent to be governed by Myrtle Beach Club or Omar Temple, or the national Shriners organization.Â  \r\nHorry Club owns property in Myrtle Beach.Â  In March 1991, Horry Club and Myrtle Beach Club executed a lease agreement for this property to be leased by Myrtle Beach Club at a rental rate of $500 per year.Â  Myrtle Beach Club used the building on the property to hold meetings.Â  This lease was to expire at the end of 1999.Â  \r\nIn August 1993, Horry Club voted to extend the lease.Â  A new lease was executed for a forty-year term to expire in 2033.Â  This lease, which was signed October 1, 1993, provided for the same rent of $500 payable on the anniversary of the lease.Â  The lease includes a default clause for the failure to pay rent.Â  It was signed by Tommy Newton as president of Myrtle Beach Club.Â  In his affidavit submitted with Horry Clubâ€™s motion for summary judgment, Newton states:\r\n\r\nI did not receive permission from the Omar Temple or the National Shrine to execute the [1993] lease agreement.Â  [Myrtle Beach Club] was later informed by the Omar Temple that the lease was illegal because it was for a term greater than one year[2] and we did not get approval from Omar Temple to execute the lease.\r\n\r\nThe parties subsequently signed a new lease agreement for a term from January 1 to December 31, 2002.[3]Â  This 2002 lease also provides for a rent payment of $500 due on the first of the year and has a default provision for the failure to pay rent. \r\nOn Â January 27, 2003, the president of Horry Club, Scott Bellamy, gave notice of default for Myrtle Beach Clubâ€™s failure to pay rent.Â  In June 2003, after commencement of this action, Myrtle Beach Club attempted payment of past due rent which Bellamy declined to accept.Â  \r\nMyrtle Beach Club and Omar Temple subsequently moved for summary judgment on the issue of the 1993 lease validity.Â  Horry Club moved in response for summary judgment.Â  Horry Clubâ€™s motion was granted.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Horry Club subordinate to Omar Temple?\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the 1993 lease valid?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Subordination\r\nThe trial judge ruled Horry Club is not subordinate to Omar Temple because there was no evidence Horry Club intended to subject itselfÂ  to Omar Templeâ€™s control.Â  Myrtle Beach Club and Omar Temple contend Horry Club is subject to Omar Templeâ€™s control based on Horry Clubâ€™s use of the Shrine name and symbols. Â We disagree.[4]\r\nThe charter of a governing charitable fraternal organization, subscribed to by an affiliate and its members, is binding on the affiliate.Â  36 Am.Jur. 2d Fraternal Orders Â§ 10; see also Grand Lodge v. Osceola Lodge, 178 N.W.2d 362 (Iowa 1970) (same).Â  Conversely, where there is no such subscription by a sub-group, there is no control vested in the parent organization.Â  We find the fact that Horry Club used the Shrine name and symbols is not sufficient evidence of its intent to subordinate itself to Omar Temple absent an express provision in Horry Clubâ€™s by-laws to that effect.Â  \r\n2.Â  Lease agreement\r\nAppellants contend the trial judge erred in finding the 2002 lease effectively modified the forty-year lease that was signed in 1993.Â  Appellants base this claim on the fact that, at the time the 2002 lease was signed, there was a temporary restraining order in effect that ordered that Horry Club â€œshall not dispose of any [of its] assets.â€Â  This temporary restraining order was issued during the pendency of another action seeking to prevent Horry Club from converting from a non-profit to a mutual benefit corporation. \r\nIn the context of the action in which the temporary restraining order was issued, conveying a one-year leasehold is not a prohibited disposition of an asset since it is not a permanent conveyance.Â  Moreover, even if the conveyance of a leasehold was prohibited and the 2002 lease was therefore invalid, this would not revive the 1993 lease which was improperly signed without approval of the national Shriners organization, a fact that is not disputed.[5]Â  Further, Horry Club invoked its right to declare a default for the failure to pay rent in 2003.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge properly ruled there is no valid lease.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR (appellate court may affirm for any reason appearing in the record). \r\n AFFIRMED.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Earlier bylaws required only that a candidate for membership be a member â€œof some Shrine Temple.â€Â  \r\n[2]The bylaws for the national Shriners organization in fact provide that an obligation for more than one year must be approved by the Imperial Council of that organization.Â  \r\n[3] This 2002 lease was signed on behalf of Myrtle Beach Club by its then-president Fred Pirl on March 29, 2002.Â  Pirl was subsequently removed from office by Omar Temple effective April 22, 2002. \r\n[4]Generally, the courts will not intervene in the internal affairs of a private association absent an unlawful action or the infringement of property rights.Â  Hampton v. Supreme Lodge, 161 S.C. 540, 159 S.E. 923 (1931); accord Budwin v. American Psych. Assâ€™n, 29 Cal. Rptr. 2d 453 (Cal. App. 1994); Bloom v. Natâ€™l Collegiate Athletic Assâ€™n, 93 P.3d 621 (Col. App. 2004); Natâ€™l Assâ€™n for the Advancement of Colored People, 679 A.2d 554 (Md. App. 1996); Valkenburg v. Liberty Lodge, 619 N.W.2d 604 (Neb. App. 2000); Original Lawrence County Farm Org. v.

App. 1995).Â Â  Here, the ongoing dispute over the partiesâ€™ lease arrangement involves property rights and prompts us to intervene. \r\n[5]Appellants complain the trial judge should not have considered the affidavits submitted by Horry Club, which were critical to the determination that the forty-year 1993 lease was invalid, because they were untimely served.Â  The record indicates the trial judge allowed appellantsâ€™ counsel to attach responding affidavits when proposed orders were submitted.Â  Accordingly, the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in considering Horry Clubâ€™s affidavits.Â  See Black v. Lexington School Dist. No. 2, 327 S.C. 55, 488 S.E.2d 327 (1997) (discretion whether to consider untimely affidavits). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-021","title":"Burrows v.
