Pachak, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\t\tAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Daniel E. Grigg, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\t\r\n  PER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari to review the denial of his application for post conviction relief (PCR).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling, and remand for a new trial.\r\n  FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n  On March 31, 2001, at approximately 2:15 a.m., two men entered a Days Inn hotel.Â  Christopher Newton, the assistant manager, who was in the back office counting money, went to the front desk.Â  The men asked if any rooms were available, and Newton informed them the hotel was booked.Â  The taller of the two men (Suspect 1) pulled out a switchblade knife and demanded money.Â  When Newton told them he could not open the safe, Suspect 1 stabbed him twice, and the other man (Suspect 2) struck him in the head, rendering him unconscious.Â \r\n\t \r\n  Several days later, Newton went to the police station where a detective instructed him to look through three books containing mug shots of both males and females of different races.Â  Newton identified petitionerâ€™s photograph as Suspect 2.Â  Two days later, Newton contacted the police department regarding his identification and told the detective he wanted to â€œtake another lookâ€ at the photograph to be certain that he had correctly identified the man in the photograph as Suspect 2.Â  The detective told Newton he could not look at the photograph again, but he could provide him with a photographic lineup.Â  As a result, another detective provided a lineup with six pictures.Â  Newton again identified petitionerâ€™s photograph as Suspect 2.[1]Â  \r\n\t \r\n  At trial, when the solicitor asked Newton to describe Suspect 2, he stated, â€œHis hair I remember specifically were [sic] in dread locks, short dread locks.â€Â  On cross-examination, Newton stated Suspect 2 had â€œsmall little rows twisted togetherâ€ that were approximately an inch long.Â  The defense called petitionerâ€™s mother, sister, and girlfriend, each of whom testified petitioner was with them on the night of the robbery at a family gathering.Â  After six and a half hours of deliberating, the jury informed the trial judge they were deadlocked.Â  The trial judge gave the jury an Allen[2] charge, and one and a half hours later, the jury found petitioner guilty.Â  \r\n\t \r\n  At the PCR hearing, petitioner alleged trial counsel was ineffective for failing to present evidence showing his head was shaved at the time of the robbery.Â  First, a cosmetologist testified at least one inch of hair is required before a person could begin the process of putting dreadlocks in his or her hair.Â  Next, petitionerâ€™s probation agent, sister, and girlfriend all testified that petitionerâ€™s head was shaved at the time of the robbery.Â  Additionally, petitioner presented a picture taken of him on November 20, 2000, in which petitioner had a shaved head.Â  Trial counsel testified Newton based his identification on facial features, not hairstyle, and testified that he thought the better approach was to focus on the fact that Newton did not have enough time to recognize Suspect 2, rather than focusing on whether petitioner had dreadlocks.Â  However, trial counsel admitted that, in discussing defenses, petitioner briefly mentioned to him that his head was shaved at the time of the robbery.Â \r\n\t \r\n  The PCR judge found the issue of whether petitioner had dreadlocks was â€œirrelevantâ€ and found the photograph petitioner presented at the PCR hearing was not significant because it did not properly reflect petitionerâ€™s appearance at the time of the robbery.Â  Accordingly, he denied petitionerâ€™s request for PCR.\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n  This Court gives great deference to the PCR judgeâ€™s findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value sufficient to support them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989). Â If no probative evidence exists to support the findings, the Court will reverse.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).\r\n  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n  Petitioner argues the PCR judge erred in finding the issue of whether he had dreadlocks at the time of the robbery was irrelevant.Â  Petitioner maintains whether he had dreadlocks was relevant to Newtonâ€™s identification and to his alibi defense and could have raised reasonable doubt as to his guilt.Â  He also argues trial counsel did not have a valid reason for failing to raise this issue.\r\n  To establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove: (1) that counsel failed to render reasonably effective assistance under prevailing professional norms; and (2) that the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).Â  Counsel must articulate a valid reason for employing a certain strategy to avoid a finding of ineffectiveness.Â  Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 560 S.E.2d 401 (2002). Â Where counsel articulates a strategy, it is measured under an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  Id.\r\n  In our opinion, there is no evidence in the record to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that the dreadlock issue was irrelevant.Â  Evidence is relevant if it tends to establish or make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.Â  State v. Schmidt, 288 S.C. 301, 342 S.E.2d 401 (1986).Â  Newtonâ€™s identification of petitioner as Suspect 2 was extremely critical to the Stateâ€™s case against petitioner, as it was the only evidence of his guilt.Â  Newton testified he specifically identified Suspect 2 as having dreadlocks more than once at trial.Â  Thus, evidence that petitionerâ€™s head was shaved at the time of the robbery would have been evidence that Newton misidentified petitioner, thereby supporting his alibi defense.Â  Accordingly, the evidence was relevant.Â  Schmidt, supra.\r\n\r\n  Moreover, we find trial counsel did not articulate a valid reason for failing to raise this issue.Â  Although trial counsel testified that Newtonâ€™s identification was based on facial features and that he chose to focus on whether Newton had adequate time to recognize Suspect 2, he also admitted petitioner told him that he had a shaved head at the time of the robbery.Â  Thus, trial counsel was aware of evidence that would have further supported the defenseâ€™s case.Â  Therefore, trial counselâ€™s strategy to only focus on facial features and not raise the dreadlock issue was unreasonable.Â  Ingle, supra.Â  \r\n\t \r\n  Finally, we conclude petitioner was prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s failure to present evidence that he had a shaved head at the time of the robbery.Â  Newtonâ€™s identification was the only evidence linking petitioner to the robbery, and, in both photographs in which Newton identified petitioner as Suspect 2, petitioner had dreadlocks.Â  Furthermore, the jury deliberated for eight hours, informed the judge they were deadlocked, and were given an Allen charge.Â  Accordingly, there is a reasonable probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different if the jury was presented with additional evidence supporting petitionerâ€™s alibi or conflicting with Newtonâ€™s identification.Â  Strickland, supra.Â  \r\n\t \r\n  CONCLUSION\r\n  For the foregoing reasons we reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling and remand for a new trial.Â \r\n\t \r\n  TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

Brown, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner pled guilty to robbery, grand larceny, and third degree burglary.Â  He was sentenced to imprisonment for fifteen years for robbery, five years for grand larceny, and five years for burglary, the sentences to run concurrently.Â  No direct appeal was taken.\r\nPetitioner seeks a writ of certiorari from an order of the circuit court denying petitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR), but granting petitioner a belated review of his direct appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the order of the PCR judge.\r\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, such as when there is reason to think a rational defendant would want to appeal (for example, because there are nonfrivolous grounds for appeal) or when the defendant reasonably demonstrated he was interested in appealing, there is no constitutional requirement that a defendant be informed of the right to a direct appeal from a guilty plea.Â  \r\nRoe v.

Thomas, Rogers Townsend &amp; Thomas, PC, of Columbia, for Petitioners.\r\n\t\t\t\tJoseph M.

Rawl Family Ltd. Partn., 359 S.C. 505, 598 S.E.2d 712 (2004) (hereinafter â€œLucas Iâ€), wherein the Court held the circuit court correctly denied petitionersâ€™ directed verdict motion because there existed a jury question as to whether petitionersâ€™ actions constituted a nuisance per se and were dangerous to respondentsâ€™ property at all times because of the continuing nature of the nuisance. \r\n \r\nThe trial judge found petitioners were bound by the determination in Lucas I that they created a nuisance per se by altering the flow of surface water, and were precluded from relitigating that issue in the instant trial.Â  However, the trial judge found the question of whether the nuisance per se caused the flooding and the resulting damage to respondentsâ€™ land had not been decided and was an issue for the finder of fact.Â  \r\n \r\nPetitioners appealed both the denial of their motion for summary judgment and the grant of partial summary judgment in favor of respondents.Â  Petitioners presented two questions in their initial brief to the Court of Appeals.Â  In Issue 1, petitioners essentially argued the trial judge erred in denying their motion for summary judgment based on the statute of limitations.Â  In Issue 2, petitioners maintained the trial judge erred in granting respondentsâ€™ motion for partial summary judgment by finding petitioners altered the direction of surface water, rather than merely the amount of surface water.Â \r\n \r\nAfter petitioners filed their initial brief and designation of matter, respondents moved to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â  As to the appeal of the trial judgeâ€™s order denying summary judgment, the Court of Appeals held an order denying summary judgment is not appealable.Â  As to the appeal of the order granting respondentsâ€™ motion for partial summary judgment, the Court of Appeals held the trial judge properly found petitioners are bound by the determination in Lucas I that they created a nuisance per se and are precluded from relitigating the issue.Â  The Court of Appeals granted respondentsâ€™ motion to dismiss the appeal of the trial judgeâ€™s order granting partial summary judgment without prejudice to petitionersâ€™ right to refile their notice of appeal after a final judgment.Â  Petitionersâ€™ petition for rehearing was denied.Â  Â Â Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners now argue the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing their appeal as interlocutory and not immediately appealable.Â \r\n \r\nFirst, we agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ dismissal as to Issue 1 because the portion of the trial judgeâ€™s order denying summary judgment was not appealable.Â  As noted by this Court in Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., 354 S.C. 161, 167-68, 580 S.E.2d 440, 443-44 (2003), an order denying a motion for summary judgment is never appealable because such an order is not a ruling on the merits of the action.Â  Petitioners may raise the issue later in the proceedings in a motion to reconsider the summary judgment motion or by a motion for a directed verdict.Â  Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 476-78, 443 S.E.2d 379, 380 (1994); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 416-17, 483 S.E.2d 477, 481 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  \r\n \r\nWith regard to Issue 2, the Court of Appeals merely stated it agreed with the trial judgeâ€™s ruling that petitioners are bound by the determination in Lucas I that they created a nuisance per se, but failed to address whether an order granting a motion for partial summary judgment is immediately appealable.Â  An order granting a motion for partial summary judgment is immediately appealable.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976); Nauful v. Milligan, 258 S.C. 139, 143, 187 S.E.2d 511, 513 (1972).Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing the appeal without addressing the merits of Issue 2.Â  Â Â \r\nAs to the merits of Issue 2, petitioners argued the trial judge erred in finding the jury in Lucas I determined petitionersâ€™ actions altered the direction of surface water.Â  Instead, petitioners argued their actions merely increased the amount of surface water.Â  Petitioners made the same argument in their Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend, wherein they stated the â€œonly thing determined by the juryâ€™s verdict, as reinstated by the Supreme Courtâ€™s decision, was that [petitioners] had created a nuisance per se when they cleared 40 acres of timber.â€Â  \r\n \r\nHowever, the trial judge did not find petitioners altered the direction of the flow of surface water.Â  He simply found petitioners had created a nuisance per se by clear-cutting the land adjacent to respondentsâ€™ property and altering the flow of surface water onto respondentsâ€™ land, which is precisely the holding in Lucas I.Â  Lucas v. Rawl, id. at 509, 598 S.E.2d at 714 (holding the common enemy rule is subject to a nuisance exception, whereby â€œan individual may not obstruct or alter the flow of surface water to create a nuisance per seâ€) (emphasis added).Â  Accordingly, petitionersâ€™ contention the trial judge erred in finding petitioners altered the direction of surface water in his order granting respondentsâ€™ motion for partial summary judgment is simply incorrect.Â  Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse that portion of the Court of Appealsâ€™ order dismissing the appeal of the grant of partial summary judgment.Â  In lieu of remanding to the Court of Appeals for consideration of the merits of petitionersâ€™ argument, in the interest of judicial economy, we have reviewed Issue 2 in petitionersâ€™ initial brief and we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s findings.Â  This matter shall be remanded to the circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.
