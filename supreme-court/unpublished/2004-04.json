Calhoun, of Beaufort, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted certiorari to determine \r\n  whether the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision granting \r\n  respondentâ€™s summary judgment motion. \r\n  [1] Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner brought this legal malpractice action against respondent, \r\n  attorney Sally Calhoun, based on respondentâ€™s failure to file a medical malpractice \r\n  action against Spartanburg Regional Medical Center (SRMC) within the two-year \r\n  statute of limitations period.\r\nIn June 1990, officers from the Spartanburg Public Safety Department arrested \r\n  Ronnie Lee Brown, at approximately 4:45 p.m., after pursuing him on foot for \r\n  thirty minutes.Â  When the officers attempted to place Brown in jail, the officer \r\n  in charge of the jail refused to accept him because he was having difficulty \r\n  breathing and could not stand up.Â  Brown told the officers he had asthma.Â  The \r\n  officers then transported Brown to SRMC, arriving at 5:12 p.m.Â  Once inside \r\n  the hospital, the officers informed hospital personnel that Brown was complaining \r\n  of breathing problems and asthma.Â  When Brown was taken to an examining room, \r\n  he was unable to sit up in a chair.\r\nAt 5:50 p.m. it was discovered that Brown, who had not yet been examined by \r\n  medical personnel, had no pulse or respiration.Â  He was pronounced dead and \r\n  an autopsy revealed that Brown died from â€œacute cardio-respiratory arrest due \r\n  to cocaine ingestion.â€\r\nShirley Rice, Brownâ€™s mother, retained respondent in June 1990 â€œto \r\n  prosecute all available claimsâ€ arising from Brownâ€™s death.Â  Thereafter, Rice \r\n  did not communicate with respondent for over two years because she was incarcerated \r\n  for forgery.Â  In the meantime, the statute of limitations for bringing an action \r\n  against SRMC had expired.Â  Shortly before her release from prison, Rice wrote \r\n  respondent and demanded suit be brought.Â  Due to Riceâ€™s incarceration, petitioner \r\n  was appointed personal representative of Brownâ€™s estate. \r\nIn May 1993, respondent, on behalf of petitioner, filed an action in federal \r\n  court, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1983 and 1988, against the officers involved \r\n  in Brownâ€™s arrest.Â  Subsequently, respondentâ€™s motion to withdraw as counsel \r\n  was granted and petitioner retained another attorney.Â  The District Court granted \r\n  the officersâ€™ motion for summary judgment finding no evidence to support petitionerâ€™s \r\n  claim that the officers acted with deliberate indifference to Brownâ€™s medical \r\n  needs.Â  After firing her attorney, petitioner retained another attorney to file \r\n  an appeal with the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals.Â  The Fourth Circuit affirmed \r\n  the district courtâ€™s decision.Â  Brown v. Odom, 56 F.3d 60 (4th Cir.), \r\n  cert. denied, 516 U.S. 964 (1995).\r\nIn April 1996, petitioner filed a legal malpractice \r\n  action against respondent based on respondentâ€™s failure to file a medical malpractice \r\n  action against SRMC within the two-year statute of limitations period.Â  Respondent \r\n  filed an answer in which she alleged that her client, Rice, disappeared and \r\n  respondent had no further contact with her until Rice wrote to her from jail \r\n  â€œshortly before the statute of limitations was to run in June 1993.â€ \r\n  [2]   \r\nRespondent further alleged she did not believe a valid \r\n  cause of action existed against the hospital.Â  She maintained that in order \r\n  to prevail on the legal malpractice action, petitioner had to show she could \r\n  have prevailed in the action against SRMC.Â  Respondent stated, due to the nature \r\n  of cocaine-induced deaths, no expert consulted could say with any degree of \r\n  certainty that Brown could have been saved.\r\nRespondent filed a summary judgment motion and submitted \r\n  affidavits from two physicians, one of whom performed the autopsy on Brown, \r\n  stating that while Brownâ€™s chances of survival would have been enhanced had \r\n  a physician immediately seen him upon arrival at SRMC, they could not say with \r\n  any degree of certainty that he could have been saved.Â  No action was taken \r\n  on the motion at that time.Â  The case was later set for trial in December 1999.Â  \r\n  In October 1999, respondent filed a Memorandum in support of her summary judgment \r\n  motion.Â  Respondent submitted the affidavit of Dr. Lester M. Haddad, who is \r\n  an expert on cocaine-induced deaths, which stated that Brownâ€™s life could not \r\n  have been saved had he been attended to immediately upon arrival at SRMC.\r\nPetitioner filed a return in the summary judgment motion \r\n  wherein she argued that based on the affidavit of her expert witness, Dr. Alfred \r\n  Frankel, respondentâ€™s motion should not be granted.Â  Dr. Frankel is an emergency \r\n  medicine physician licensed in Florida whose affidavit was obtained by petitionerâ€™s \r\n  counsel in October 1996.\r\nDr. Frankel stated in his affidavit that he had reviewed \r\n  Brownâ€™s medical and hospital records, the autopsy report and affidavits from\r\neyewitnesses on the scene during Brownâ€™s arrest and medical \r\n  treatment.Â  He stated that based on â€œa reasonable degree of medical certainty, \r\n  . . . medical personnel at [SRMC] deviated from the standard of care during \r\n  an emergency . . .â€ by failing to timely seek medical attention for Brown, failing \r\n  to triage Brown and take his vital signs in an appropriate or timely manner, \r\n  failing to take an appropriate history, failing to perform an appropriate physical \r\n  examination, and failing to provide appropriate cardiac or ventilatory support \r\n  to prevent Brown from going into cardiopulmonary arrest.Â  Dr. Frankel further \r\n  stated that, based upon a reasonable degree of medical certainty, the time that \r\n  elapsed between the time Brown was transported to the hospital and the time \r\n  he was seen by medical authorities was unreasonable.Â  Finally, he stated he \r\n  was â€œconvinced to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that . . . Brown \r\n  died as a direct result of the negligence on the part of the nurses and doctors \r\n  at [SRMC] . . . and that his death was the result of acute respiratory arrest \r\n  secondary to cocaine ingestion which clearly could have been prevented with \r\n  earlier appropriate medical care.â€ \r\n\r\nPetitioner also provided an affidavit from attorney Thomas \r\n  E. Moseley.Â  Moseley opined that â€œ[respondent] committed professional malpractice \r\n  and deviated from the applicable standard of care in her handling of the underlying \r\n  case.â€\r\nThe trial court granted respondentâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion, because petitioner had failed to present any evidence establishing a \r\n  question of fact as to the element of proximate cause in her medical malpractice \r\n  action.Â  The court found the only evidence petitioner presented on the issue \r\n  of proximate cause was Dr. Frankelâ€™s conclusory and speculative affidavit.Â  \r\n  The court further found that while Dr. Frankelâ€™s opinions may find acceptance \r\n  under the â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine, they were not beneficial in a state such \r\n  as South Carolina which does not recognize that doctrine but instead requires \r\n  a plaintiff who relies on expert testimony to introduce evidence that the defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligence most probably resulted in the injuries alleged.Â  The court found \r\n  it was impossible to determine from Dr. Frankelâ€™s affidavit whether Mr. Brownâ€™s \r\n  life most probably would have been saved had he received treatment any earlier.Â  \r\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment to respondent?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner argues summary judgment should not have been granted to respondent \r\n  because Dr. Frankelâ€™s affidavit creates a question of fact as to whether she \r\n  would have been successful in her underlying medical malpractice claim.\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only if there is no genuine issue \r\n  of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of \r\n  law.Â  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, \r\n  575 S.E.2d 549 (2003).Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist \r\n  for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences that can \r\n  be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to the nonmoving party.Â  Id.Â  The Court must construe all ambiguities, \r\n  conclusions, and inferences arising from the evidence against the moving party; \r\n  however, the opposing party may not rest upon mere allegations or denials, but \r\n  must respond with specific facts showing a genuine issue.Â  City of Columbia \r\n  v. Town of Irmo, 316 S.C. 193, 447 S.E.2d 855 (1994).Â  \r\nTo prove legal malpractice, the plaintiff must establish:Â  (1) the \r\n  breach of a duty by the attorney, (2) proximate causation, and (3) damages.Â  \r\n  Brown v. Theos, 345 S.C. 626, 550 S.E.2d 304 (2001).Â  Additionally, the \r\n  plaintiff must generally establish the standard of care by expert testimony.Â  \r\n  Smith v. Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Geurard, 322 S.C. 433, 472 S.E.2d \r\n  612 (1996).Â  Moreover, the plaintiff must show he or she â€œmost probablyâ€ would \r\n  have been successful in the underlying suit if the attorney had not committed \r\n  the alleged malpractice.Â  Brown v. Theos, supra.Â  \r\nThe underlying suit involved in this case is \r\n  a medical malpractice action.Â  In a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff \r\n  must present (1) evidence of the generally recognized practice and procedures \r\n  that would be exercised by competent practitioners in a defendant doctorâ€™s field \r\n  of medicine under the same or similar circumstances and (2) evidence that the \r\n  defendant doctor departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards, \r\n  practices, and procedures in the manner alleged by the plaintiff.Â  Gooding \r\n  v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., 326 S.C. 248, 487 S.E.2d 596 (1997).Â  Further, \r\n  unless the subject is a matter of common knowledge, the plaintiff must use expert \r\n  testimony to establish both the standard of care and the defendantâ€™s failure \r\n  to conform to that standard.Â  Id.Â  A medical malpractice plaintiff who \r\n  relies solely on expert testimony must introduce evidence that the defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligence most probably resulted in the injuries alleged.Â  Id.\r\nDr. Frankelâ€™s affidavit creates a genuine issue \r\n  of material fact as to whether SRMCâ€™s delay in treating Ronnie Brown was the \r\n  proximate cause of his death.Â  Dr. Frankel, in his affidavit, states he based \r\n  his opinion on his review of Ronnie Brownâ€™s medical and hospital records, his \r\n  autopsy report, and affidavits from eyewitnesses to his arrest and medical treatment.Â Â  \r\n  He further states he is familiar with the standards of medical practice and \r\n  the standard of care relevant to emergency medical practice.Â  Dr. Frankel sets \r\n  forth five specific deviations from the standard of care.Â  He then concludes \r\n  he is â€œconvinced to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ronnie Brown \r\n  died as a direct result of the negligenceâ€ of SRMC medical personnel and that \r\n  his death â€œclearly could have been prevented with earlier appropriate medical \r\n  care.â€Â  Given Dr. Frankel clearly states the basis of his opinion and clearly \r\n  delineates how SRMC deviated from the standard of care, the affidavit is not \r\n  conclusory or speculative as found by the trial court.\r\nAs stated previously, the trial court found \r\n  that, while Dr. Frankelâ€™s opinions may find acceptance under the â€œloss of chanceâ€ \r\n  doctrine, those opinions were not helpful in South Carolina because this state \r\n  does not recognize that doctrine.\r\nThe â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine permits recovery \r\n  when the delay in proper diagnosis or treatment of a medical condition results \r\n  in the patient being deprived of a less than even chance of surviving or recovering.Â  \r\n  Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996).Â  This Court has \r\n  rejected the â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine because it does not comport with the \r\n  South Carolina standard that, in a medical malpractice action, the plaintiff \r\n  who relies on expert testimony must introduce evidence that the defendantâ€™s \r\n  negligence most probably resulted in the injuries alleged.Â  Id. (citing \r\n  Jones v. Owings, 318 S.C. 72, 456 S.E.2d 371 (1995)).Â  In rejecting the \r\n  doctrine, the Court found the â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine was fundamentally at \r\n  odds with the requisite degree of medical certainty necessary to establish a \r\n  causal link between the patientâ€™s injury and the physicianâ€™s tortious conduct, \r\n  and that, instead, legal responsibility under the doctrine was assigned based \r\n  on the mere possibility that a physicianâ€™s negligence was a cause of the ultimate \r\n  harm.Â  Jones, supra.\r\nThe trial court erred by finding Dr. Frankelâ€™s \r\n  opinions come within the scope of the â€œloss of chanceâ€ doctrine.Â  Dr. Frankel \r\n  did not state in his affidavit that the delay in diagnosing and treating Ronnie \r\n  Brown resulted in his having a lesser chance of survival than he would have \r\n  had had he been diagnosed earlier.Â  Instead, Dr. Frankel states he is convinced \r\n  to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ronnie Brown died as a direct \r\n  result of SRMCâ€™s negligence.Â  He further stated Ronnie Brownâ€™s death could have \r\n  been prevented with earlier appropriate medical care.Â  Both of these statements \r\n  meet the requirement that a medical malpractice plaintiff, relying solely on \r\n  expert testimony, must introduce evidence that the defendantâ€™s negligence most \r\n  probably resulted in the injuries alleged.Â  See Baughman v. American \r\n  Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. 101, 410 S.E.2d 537 (1991) (not necessary that \r\n  expert actually use words â€œmost probably;â€ sufficient if testimony impresses \r\n  that opinion represents expertâ€™s professional judgment as to most likely one \r\n  among possible causes).\r\nBecause Dr. Frankelâ€™s affidavit creates a genuine \r\n  issue of material fact as to whether SRMCâ€™s negligence was the proximate cause \r\n  of Ronnie Brownâ€™s death, there is likewise a genuine issue of material fact \r\n  as to whether Brown can show she most probably would have been successful in \r\n  her underlying medical malpractice suit if respondent had not committed malpractice.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  granting respondent summary judgment.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  BURNETT, J., not \r\n  participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Brown \r\n    v.

Allen Bullard, all of Columbia, \r\n  for petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Respondent Michael Minor (Minor) \r\n  pled guilty to possession of cocaine.Â  The trial judge sentenced him to imprisonment \r\n  for two years and a $2,000 fine, suspended to one-year probation and a $500 \r\n  fine.Â  Concluding trial counsel was ineffective in failing to advise Minor his \r\n  South Carolina guilty plea would effect a revocation of his Florida parole, \r\n  the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge granted Minorâ€™s PCR application.Â  We \r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n Minor is currently detained in the Madison Correctional \r\n  Institution in Madison, Florida.Â  On April 16, 1992, he was sentenced to a twenty-two \r\n  year prison term in Florida for trafficking in stolen property.Â  On March 23, \r\n  1993, he was paroled.\r\nIn September 1997, Minor was arrested in Maryland on a burglary \r\n  charge.Â  He posted bail and, after receiving permission from his parole officer, \r\n  moved to Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, with his wife and family.\r\nOn January 25, 1998, Minor was arrested in Horry County \r\n  and charged with possession of crack cocaine.Â  He was also arrested on a fugitive \r\n  warrant for the pending Maryland burglary charge.Â  The Maryland charge was later \r\n  dismissed.\r\nFollowing Minorâ€™s counseled guilty plea to possession of \r\n  powder cocaine, he was released to the State of Florida.Â  Under Florida law, \r\n  a paroled defendant may be required to serve the remainder of a sentence if \r\n  he violates the terms of his parole.Â  The Florida Parole authorities determined \r\n  Minorâ€™s South Carolina plea violated his Florida parole and imposed a seventeen-year \r\n  sentence.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas plea counsel \r\n  ineffective in advising Respondent of the effect of his \r\n  South Carolina guilty plea on his Florida parole? \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nTo establish \r\n  a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, the PCR applicant must establish \r\n  that trial counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness \r\n  and that, but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability the result \r\n  would have been different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 \r\n  S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984).Â Â  A defendant who pleads guilty on the advice \r\n  of counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of the plea \r\n  by showing (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of \r\n  reasonableness and (2) there is a reasonable probability that, but for, counselâ€™s \r\n  errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would have gone to trial.Â  \r\n  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-57, 106 S.Ct. 366, 369, 88 L.Ed.2d \r\n  203, 208 (1985);Â  McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995).Â  \r\n  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence \r\n  in the outcomeâ€ of trial.Â  Id. 466 U.S. at 694, 104 S.Ct. at 2068, 80 \r\n  L.Ed.2d at 698.Â  The PCR judgeâ€™s findings will be upheld by this Court when \r\n  they are supported by any evidence of probative value.Â  Cherry v. State, \r\n  300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  However, the Court will not uphold the \r\n  findings of the PCR court if no probative evidence supports those findings.Â  \r\n  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nThe State contends \r\n  the PCR judge erred by concluding trial counsel was ineffective because he did \r\n  not advise Minor his guilty plea would revoke his Florida parole.Â  Specifically, \r\n  the State relies on a colloquy between the circuit court judge and Minor at \r\n  the conclusion of the plea.Â  Trial counsel explained to the circuit court judge \r\n  that Minor â€œis on hold from Florida and he is aware that this plea will violate \r\n  his probation down there.â€Â  Immediately thereafter, the plea judge asked Minor \r\n  if he had anything he wanted to say.Â  Minor voiced no concerns or disagreement. \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\nPrior to Minorâ€™s \r\n  plea, counsel discussed with Minor that a plea in South Carolina would violate \r\n  Minorâ€™s Florida probation.Â  Therefore, Minor has failed to show error or prejudice, \r\n  i.e., that counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness \r\n  and that, but for any error by counsel, he would not have pled guilty, but would \r\n  have gone to trial.Â  We conclude there is no evidence of probative value in \r\n  the record supporting the post-conviction courtâ€™s findings.Â  Accordingly, we \r\n  reverse.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2004-MO-020","title":"Agurs v.
