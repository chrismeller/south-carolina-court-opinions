McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Brian T. Petrano, all of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari from the dismissal, after a hearing, of\r\n  petitioner's post-conviction relief (PCR) application.Â  We grant the petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari, dispense with further briefing, and reverse.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner pled\r\n  guilty on July 18, 2007 to possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack\r\n  cocaine, second offense, and unlawful carrying of a pistol, for which he\r\n  received concurrent sentences of five years' imprisonment and one year\r\n  imprisonment, respectively.Â  No direct appeal was taken.Â  Petitioner mailed his\r\n  PCR application, which alleged that his\r\n  guilty plea was involuntary and that plea counsel was ineffective, via certified mail to the Richland County\r\n  Clerk of Court on July 11, 2008.Â  However, the application was not stamped as &quot;filed&quot;\r\n  by the Richland County Clerk of Court until July 30, 2008.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  State moved to dismiss the application as untimely pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-27-45(A) (2003).\r\nThe PCR judge\r\n  concluded the application was filed on July 30, 2008, regardless of the date on\r\n  which petitioner alleged it was mailed.Â  The PCR judge further found the\r\n  registered mail receipt indicated the application was mailed and postmarked on\r\n  July 16, 2008, not July 11, 2008.[1]Â \r\n  Noting that mailing does not constitute filing in the case of a PCR\r\n  application, but instead, the application is considered filed when it is\r\n  delivered to and \r\nreceived by the\r\n  proper officer, the PCR judge found the application was filed outside of the\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge issued a final order\r\n  denying and dismissing the application.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR judge\r\n  err in dismissing petitioner's PCR application as untimely?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA PCR application\r\n  must be filed within one year after conviction or within one year after the\r\n  sending of the remittitur to the lower court from an appeal.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).Â  A PCR application must be\r\n  filed with the clerk of court in which the conviction took place.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-27-40 (2003).Â \r\n  Mailing does not constitute filing for a PCR application.Â  Gary v. State, 347 S.C. 627, 629, 557 S.E.2d 662, 663\r\n  (2001).Â  Instead, a PCR application is considered filed when it is delivered to\r\n  and received by the clerk of court.Â  Id.\r\nWe find the PCR\r\n  judge erred in finding petitioner's application was untimely.Â  Petitioner's\r\n  certified mail receipt clearly states petitioner's PCR application was\r\n  delivered to the Main Post Office in Columbia and was signed for on July 16,\r\n  2008.Â  Therefore, we find the application\r\n  was delivered to and received by the proper officer within the one-year statute\r\n  of limitations.Â  See Â§17-27-45(A); Gary, 347 S.C. at 629, 557 S.E.2d at 663.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause\r\n  petitioner filed his PCR application within the one-year statute of\r\n  limitations, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with\r\n  further briefing, and reverse the PCR judge's finding that the application was\r\n  untimely.Â  \r\n\r\nREVERSED. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This finding is not supported by the record because\r\n  petitionerâ€™s original receipt is stamped â€œBennettsvilleâ€ and the return receipt\r\n  is stamped by the post office in Columbia on July 16, 2008.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
