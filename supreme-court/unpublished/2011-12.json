Florian, of S.C. Dept. of\r\n  Corrections, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Jeromy Chisolm was charged\r\n  with fighting without a weapon after an altercation with another inmate after\r\n  which he was transferred to another facility.Â  He had a grievance hearing and\r\n  was found guilty. During the month of the disciplinary action, Chisolm was not\r\n  allowed to earn good time credits.Â  Chisolm appealed to the Administrative Law\r\n  Court's (ALC) and the ALC dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction under\r\n  Section 1-23-600(D) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2010).\r\nChisolm\r\n  contends that because his argument on appeal addresses his denial of due\r\n  process in his grievance hearing and not his failure to earn good time credits,\r\n  section 1-23-600(D) does not apply and he is entitled to an appeal.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR,\r\n  and the following authorities: S.C. Code Ann.
