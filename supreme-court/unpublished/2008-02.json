Few, Post Conviction Relief Judge\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2006-MO-026\r\nReheard November 1, 2007 â€“ Refiled\r\n  February 4, 2008\r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tChief Appellate\r\n  Defender Joseph L. Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent\r\n  Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Karen\r\n  C. Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  We previously granted certiorari to determine whether the\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by granting Petitioner a new trial on\r\n  the grounds that the Department of Corrections was incorrectly treating Petitioner\r\n  as if he were ineligible for parole.Â  We affirmed the PCR courtâ€™s decision in\r\n  an unpublished opinion.Â  See Newsome v. State, Op. No.\r\n  2006-MO-026 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July, 17 2006).Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s\r\n  request for rehearing, directed\r\n  the parties to brief certain issues on rehearing, and we find that the appeal\r\n  should be dismissed as moot.\r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nPetitioner pled guilty to homicide by child abuse and attempted\r\n  escape. The trial court sentenced Petitioner to imprisonment for 100 years on\r\n  the homicide by child abuse charge, and one year imprisonment for the escape\r\n  charge.Â  The court did not state whether the sentences were to be concurrent or\r\n  consecutive.\r\nIn\r\n  seeking PCR, Petitioner claimed that his sentences should be served concurrently\r\n  so that the Department of Corrections would consider him to be eligible for\r\n  parole.Â  The PCR court granted relief, and the State sought review on\r\n  certiorari in this Court.Â  This Court affirmed the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief,\r\n  but ordered that Petitioner be given a new trial because the PCR court did not\r\n  have the authority to order the Department of Corrections to interpret\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s sentences as concurrent.Â  Newsome v. State, Op. No.\r\n  2006-MO-026 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July, 17 2006).Â  This Court granted the\r\n  Stateâ€™s request that the Court rehear the matter, and the Court further\r\n  directed the parties to brief the following issue:\r\n\r\n\tAssuming\r\n  that the sentences in this case are consecutive, did this have any impact on Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  parole eligibility?[1]\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioner testified at his second PCR hearing that he\r\n  would not have pled guilty had he known he would not be eligible for parole.Â  The\r\n  record on rehearing, however, reveals that the Department of Probation, Parole,\r\n  and Pardon Services has been treating Petitioner as eligible for parole for\r\n  some time, and that Petitioner has had several parole hearings.Â  Thus,\r\n  Petitioner has received his requested relief.\r\nBecause\r\n  Petitioner is being treated as eligible for parole, the appeal is dismissed as\r\n  moot.Â  See Mathis v. South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t,&nbsp;260\r\n  S.C. 344, 195 S.E.2d 713 (1973) (case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered,\r\n  will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy; this is true\r\n  when some event occurs making it impossible for reviewing court to grant\r\n  effectual relief). Â Our finding that the appeal\r\n  should be dismissed as moot makes it unnecessary to address the issues we\r\n  previously ordered the parties to brief.Â  Cf. Whiteside\r\n    v. Cherokee County Sch. Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate\r\n  court need not address remaining issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justices E. C. Burnett, III and Alexander S.\r\n  Macaulay, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Although we asked the parties to brief three specific issues on rehearing, the\r\n  resolution of this case calls for this Court to focus only on this single\r\n  issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-008","title":"Weaver v.
