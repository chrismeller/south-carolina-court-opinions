Parsons, all of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae. \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is a direct appeal from a family court order of protection\r\n  issued June 7, 2006.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant, Matthew Saski, was a patrolman with the Clemson\r\n  University Police Department.Â  Respondent, Julie Garcia was his girlfriend for\r\n  some period of time, and they had planned to get married.Â  They lived together\r\n  for four weeks in April 2006.Â  \r\nAccording to Garcia, on April 29, 2006, after Saski got home from\r\n  work, they drank some wine, and Garcia went to bed early.Â Â  When Saski came\r\n  into the bedroom around 3:30 a.m., she heard him crying in the shower.Â  He got\r\n  into bed and pointed his middle finger upward toward the ceiling; when she\r\n  asked what he was doing, he said he was praying.Â  She asked him what was wrong\r\n  and he said, â€œIâ€™m the devil, just kill me.â€Â  Saski then told Garcia he had\r\n  killed her dog Angel, saying he had choked her.Â  He put the dogâ€™s body in the\r\n  woods behind the house.Â  According to Garcia, Saski told her, â€œI couldnâ€™t help\r\n  it. Â I couldnâ€™t stop.â€Â  Garcia went and slept in her sonâ€™s bedroom and left\r\n  early the next morning to go to a friendâ€™s house.Â  They corresponded via text\r\n  message that morning, and Garcia asked him to move out.Â  Saski moved out that\r\n  day, and they had no further contact.Â  \r\nSaski presented a different scenario.Â  He testified he was petting\r\n  Angel on the sofa late that night and, as he reached for the remote control, the\r\n  dog went to jump on him, so he pushed her away with his hand.Â  The dog landed\r\n  on the floor and wasnâ€™t moving.Â  He picked her up and attempted to resuscitate\r\n  Angel by blowing into her snout when â€œgreen and brown stuff started coming out.â€Â \r\n  He took Angel outside and Garciaâ€™s other dog, Charlie, was barking.Â Â Â  He\r\n  realized Angel was dead, so he brought her into the woods so Charlie would stop\r\n  barking.Â  Saski started crying, realizing heâ€™d killed the dog.Â  According to\r\n  Saski, when Garcia asked him what was wrong, he said, â€œAngelâ€™s dead.Â  I think I\r\n  killed her.â€Â  He then told her â€œshe choked,â€ and â€œI couldnâ€™t help her.â€Â  \r\nSeveral days after the incident, Garcia applied to the family\r\n  court for an order of protection on the basis of the dog incident.Â  After a hearing\r\n  on May 5, 2006, Saski consented to an interim order mutually restricting the\r\n  parties from coming near each other.Â Â  Garcia advised the court at that time\r\n  she did not want Saski to be prevented from returning to his job as a police\r\n  officer.Â  The family court decided to postpone a final ruling until it had the\r\n  benefit of an autopsy report on the dog.Â  \r\nA subsequent hearing was held on June 5, 2006.Â  Although the court\r\n  found the autopsy was not inconsistent with either Garciaâ€™s or Saskiâ€™s version\r\n  of events, the court issued the order of protection based on Garciaâ€™s fear for\r\n  her safety.Â  The order remained in effect for one year.Â  One provision of the\r\n  order, was a Federal Firearms Prohibition, pursuant to 18 U.S.C. Â§ 922.Â  \r\nAfter his motion for rehearing was denied, Saski filed a petition\r\n  for a writ of supersedeas, requesting the June 7, 2006 order of protection be\r\n  stayed, and that the mutual restraining order which had been issued on May 19,\r\n  2006, be allowed to remain in effect pending appeal.Â  Saski contended that\r\n  because the order of protection prevented him from carrying a weapon, he would\r\n  lose his job as a policeman with Clemson University Police Department.Â  His\r\n  captain, James Gowan, filed a supporting affidavit indicating that if the order\r\n  of protection stayed in place as written, Saski stood to lose his job on July\r\n  15, 2006.Â Â  Supersedeas was denied.Â Â  \r\nSaski appeals the order of protection, contending that there was\r\n  no evidence of any abuse, nor the threat thereof, to Garcia.Â Â  We agree.\r\nDISCUSSION[1]\r\nWe find the family court erred in issuing the order of protection\r\n  in this case, because the record does not demonstrate Saski posed any threat of\r\n  harm to Garcia or her family.Â  \r\nThe S.C. Protection from Domestic Abuse Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-4-20 et seq. permits a family court to issue an order of protection â€œto\r\n  protect the petitioner or minor household members from the abuse of another\r\n  household member.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(f).Â  A â€œhousehold memberâ€ is\r\n  defined to include â€œa male and female who are cohabiting or formerly have\r\n  cohabited.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(b) (iv).Â Â  Section 20-4-20 permits the\r\n  filing of a petition for an order of protection by any household members in\r\n  need of protection.Â  â€œThe petition must allege the existence of abuse to a\r\n    household member.Â  It must state the specific time, place, details of the\r\n  abuse, and other facts and circumstances upon which relief is sought.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-40(b).Â  â€œAbuseâ€ is defined by the statute as â€œphysical harm,\r\n  bodily injury, assault, or the threat of physical harm,â€ or â€œsexual criminal\r\n  offenses, as otherwise defined by statute, committed against a family or\r\n  household member by a family or household member.â€Â Â  (Emphasis added).Â  \r\nCiting this Courtâ€™s recent opinion in Moore v. Moore,\r\n  376 S.C. 467, 657 S.E.2d 743 (2008), the Attorney General contends it is irrelevant that there was\r\n  no actual, direct threat of harm made by Saski toward Garcia; the AG asserts\r\n  that under Moore, a court need not make a finding of actual abuse of a\r\n  victim in order to issue an order of protection.Â  Our holding in Moore is inapposite.Â Â  \r\nIn Moore, a 15-year-old boy called police and reported that\r\n  his father had become physically abusive with him and his mother and threatened\r\n  them with a weapon.Â  The father was arrested and charged with criminal domestic\r\n  violence, then released on bond.Â  The mother petitioned for an order of\r\n  protection, and an emergency hearing was held within 24 hours pursuant to S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-50(a).Â  At the emergency hearing, the family court made a\r\n  final adjudication that the father had physically abused mother and son at that\r\n  hearing.Â  On appeal, when father raised due process implications, this Court\r\n  noted that â€œwe are concerned that a factual finding of physical abuse was\r\n  finally adjudicated at this emergency hearing.â€Â  367 S.C. at 478, 657 S.E.2d at\r\n  749.Â  Due to the emergency nature of the hearing, and the fact that it was held\r\n  within 24 hours prior to the father retaining counsel, we opined:\r\n\r\n\t[A] definitive factual finding of physical abuse for a temporary\r\n  Order of Protection is not only improper under the terms of the statute, but is\r\n  also unnecessary to satisfy the governmentâ€™s interest. In our view, the\r\n  Legislature provided for an emergency hearing, for the benefit of victims of domestic\r\n  violence and did not intend for these protections to establish collateral\r\n  consequences for the alleged abuser. \r\n\r\nId.Â  Given the temporary nature of the emergency hearing, the Court\r\n  held â€œ[a] review of these statutory prerequisites reveals that a definitive\r\n  finding of physical abuse is not essential.â€Â  Id. at 480, 657 S.E.2d at\r\n  750.Â  The Court went on to hold that:\r\n[A]lthough the Act defines â€œabuseâ€ to include â€œphysical abuse,â€\r\n  â€œbodily injury,â€ and â€œassault,â€ it also recognizes that â€œthe threat of physical\r\n  harmâ€ is sufficient to constitute a basis for the issuance of an Order of\r\n  Protection as the result of an emergency hearing. S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20(a)(1)\r\n  (1985 &amp; Supp.2006).Â  We concluded that because the threat of a future\r\n  occurrence is a sufficient basis upon which to issue an order of protection, a\r\n  â€œdefinitive finding of physical abuse is not mandated.â€Â  Id.\r\nThe Attorney General asserts â€œthe killing of Angel alone suggested\r\n  an immediate and present danger to [Garciaâ€™s] family,â€ so as to constitute a\r\n  sufficient threat of physical harm.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe emergency hearing in this case took place on May 5, 2006,\r\n  approximately one week after the April 29th incident.Â  At that time, the court\r\n  orally determined to issue a temporary mutual restraining order pending a final\r\n  determination after receipt of the autopsy on the dog.Â Â  A subsequent hearing\r\n  was held May 15, 2006, because Saski was not being allowed to work; Garcia\r\n  indicated at this hearing that she did not object to Saski continuing his job.Â \r\n  At the May 15th hearing, the trial court concurred with counselâ€™s statement\r\n  that Garcia indicated that Saski had not, during the whole sequence of events,\r\n  threatened her in any way or said anything threatening to her.Â Â  However, she\r\n  had indicated that his conduct made her feel threatened.\r\nThe final hearing was held June 5, 2006, after the family court\r\n  reviewed the autopsy.Â  The autopsy report was inconclusive, but could not \r\nrule out blunt\r\n  trauma.Â  The court found Garcia more credible, and found her fear for her\r\n  safety was sufficient to warrant issuance of the order.Â  This was error.Â  \r\nWe find Garciaâ€™s subjective fear for her safety does not warrant\r\n  issuance of the order of protection, particularly given the facts that it was\r\n  more than one month between the incident and the final hearing, Saski had moved\r\n  out of the house, and the parties had had absolutely no contact in the\r\n  interim.Â Â  We find the evidence did not demonstrate Saski posed any actual\r\n  threat of physical harm to Garcia or her family. Â Â Accord Kopelovich\r\n    v. Kopelovich, 793 So.2d 31, 33 (Fl. App. 2nd Dist. 2001) (husbandâ€™s threat\r\n  of harm to family dog â€œfailed to establish either immediate or present danger\r\n  or the threat of or actual domestic violence); Fleckner v. Fleckner, ___\r\n  N.E.2d ___, 2008 WL 3198724 (Ohio App. Dist. 2008) (Where husband emailed wife\r\n  he would â€œI will take out all of my anger and frustration in this family\r\n  membersâ€™ death sentence out on wife in court,â€ wifeâ€™s subjective fear was\r\n  insufficient and failed an objective test of reasonableness); Ficklin v.\r\n    Ficklin, 710 N.W.2d 387 (N.D. 2006) (threats may constitute domestic\r\n  violence warranting protection order only if they constitute the infliction of\r\n  fear of imminent physical harm; courtâ€™s findings may not rest solely on\r\n  perceived possibility of domestic violence rather than reasonable fear of\r\n  actual or imminent harm); Moore v. Hall, 786 So.2d 1264 (Fla. App. 2001)\r\n  (former husbandâ€™s statement to process server that he should have killed former\r\n  wife eleven years ago did not provide former wife with objectively reasonable\r\n  fear of imminent domestic violence).Â  \r\nAlthough Garcia may have subjectively feared Saski, the evidence\r\n  is simply insufficient to demonstrate that he presented any real or imminent\r\n  physical threat to her safety.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s order of\r\n  protection is reversed.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nPLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a\r\n  separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief\r\n  Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully\r\n  dissent.Â  In my view, Garciaâ€™s actions posed a threat of physical harm, and I\r\n  would therefore affirm the family courtâ€™s decision.\r\nThe evidence in\r\n  this case shows that following the dogâ€™s death, Saski stated that â€œIâ€™m the\r\n  devil, just kill me,â€ â€œI couldnâ€™t help it. I couldnâ€™t stop,â€ and â€œI knew\r\n  something like this was going to happen.â€Â  Additionally, Garcia testified to\r\n  previous incidents with the dog indicating abuse.Â  She noted that on two\r\n  occasions she left the dog alone in the room with Saski and subsequently heard\r\n  the dog â€œyelp.â€Â  Garcia also recalled an incident where she returned home from\r\n  work and found the dog unresponsive and in shock.Â  Garcia stated that Saski\r\n  told her that he found the dog in a drainage ditch and claimed it had been hit\r\n  by a car.Â  Garcia testified that she feared Saski because her son lived in the\r\n  home with her, she believed Saski could not control his actions, and Saski had\r\n  access to a gun. Â Finally, although Garcia and Saski presented different\r\n  accounts of the incident, the family court found Garciaâ€™s version to be more\r\n  credible.\r\nIn\r\n  my view, evidence that a household member killed an animal clearly supports a\r\n  finding of a threat of physical harm. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-4-20\r\n  (providing that a family court may issue an order of protection if the petitioner proves the allegation of threat of\r\n  physical harm by a preponderance of the evidence); Moore v. Moore, 376 S.C. 467,478, 657 S.E.2d 743, 749 (2008)\r\n  (holding that a definitive factual finding of physical abuse is\r\n  not required to issue an order of protection).Â  I therefore cannot agree with the majorityâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that this evidence did not show that Saski posed any actual threat\r\n  of physical harm to Garcia or her family, especially in light of the family\r\n  courtâ€™s credibility determination.Â  See Richland County Dept. of Soc. Servs. v. Earles, 330\r\n  S.C. 24, 32, 496 S.E.2d 864, 868 (1998) (recognizing that because an appellate court lacks the opportunity\r\n  for direct observation of the witness, it should accord great deference to the family courtâ€™s\r\n  findings where matters of credibility are involved).Â  I furthermore believe that the majority errs in\r\n  suggesting that the facts of this case are necessarily comparable to the verbal\r\n  or written threats that family courts in other jurisdictions have ruled did not\r\n  constitute an objectively reasonable fear of domestic violence.Â  While the\r\n  possibility and likelihood of physical harm based on these types of threats can\r\n  vary depending upon many factors, in my view, the malicious and illegal killing\r\n  of a household pet is a direct act of violence posing a threat of physical harm\r\n  to household members.\r\nOur\r\n  legislature drafted the Protection from Domestic Abuse Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  20-4-10 et seq., to give the family court the authority to issue orders of\r\n  protection against a household member to protect other household members from\r\n  abuse.Â  I believe that the family court in the instant case carefully reviewed\r\n  all of the evidence presented by both sides and correctly issued the order of\r\n  protection.Â  I would therefore affirm the decision.\r\nKITTREDGE,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Garcia did not file a respondentâ€™s brief.Â  The\r\n  Attorney General, as amicus curiae, contends the issue is moot as the order on\r\n  appeal expired in June 2007.Â  Given the potential ramifications of the order, we\r\n  find it is not moot.Â  See Moore v. Moore, 376 S.C. 467, 657 S.E.2d 743\r\n  (2008).Â Â  Further, given the orderâ€™s short duration, it is a matter which is\r\n  capable of repetition yet evading review.Â  Byrd v. Irmo High Sch., 321\r\n  S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-045","title":"Pace v.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Brian Petrano, all\r\n  of the Office of the Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this post-conviction relief (PCR) matter, petitioner seeks a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s order dismissing his PCR application and finding\r\n  he is entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues.Â  The State has filed a motion to strike a\r\n  portion of petitionerâ€™s brief.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  petition is denied as to petitionerâ€™s Question II.Â  However, because there is\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling that petitioner did not\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, we grant the\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari as to petitionerâ€™s Question I and proceed\r\n  with a review of the direct appeal issue pursuant to Davis v. State, 288\r\n  S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986).Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends his guilty plea was not\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily entered because he was unaware that there was a negotiated thirty-year\r\n  sentence.Â  The transcript\r\n  from the plea hearing shows all parties present at the plea hearing â€“\r\n  petitioner, the solicitor, plea counsel, and the plea judge â€“ understood there\r\n  was a thirty-year negotiated sentence.Â  Moreover, petitioner was fully informed\r\n  of the consequences of his guilty plea, including the rights he waived by\r\n  entering a guilty plea and the maximum penalty for his offenses.Â  Roddy v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 528 S.E.2d 418 (2000); Pittman\r\n    v. State, 337 S.C. 597, 524 S.E.2d 623 (1999).Â  Accordingly, we affirm petitionerâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences.Â  In light of our disposition of this matter, we deny\r\n  the Stateâ€™s motion as moot.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Daniel E. Grigg, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEICONES: Â After a jury trial, Petitioner\r\n  Johnny L. Cantrell (Petitioner) was convicted of criminal sexual conduct with a\r\n  minor in the second degree and assault with intent to commit the same.Â \r\n  Petitioner filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) application alleging\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, which the PCR court denied.Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nDefense presented\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s daughter (Daughter) who is also the victimâ€™s sister.Â  Daughter\r\n  testified that she lived in the home during eight of the nine months in which\r\n  the alleged abuse occurred and contradicted much of the victimâ€™s testimony of\r\n  abuse.\r\nThe following day,\r\n  the State sought to introduce the testimony of a reply witness (Witness) who,\r\n  during an in-camera hearing, testified that on the day prior to Daughterâ€™s\r\n  testimony, she told Witness that she â€œknewâ€ of her fatherâ€™s guilt.Â  Despite\r\n  repeated inquiries by the trial judge, defense counsel (Counsel) interposed no\r\n  objection to Witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Witness then testified in court.Â  Counsel\r\n  sought to recall Daughter to deny having made the statement to Witness, but the\r\n  request was denied.\r\nAt the PCR hearing,\r\n  Petitioner alleged that Counsel was ineffective in failing to object to\r\n  Witnessâ€™s testimony regarding Daughterâ€™s alleged prior inconsistent statement\r\n  when no proper foundation had been laid.Â  Daughter testified at the hearing and\r\n  denied having made the statement.Â  The PCR judge denied the ineffective\r\n  assistance claim, finding that Counselâ€™s performance was not deficient and that\r\n  Petitioner had not been prejudiced by Witnessâ€™s testimony.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR judge\r\n  err in finding that Petitionerâ€™s counsel was not ineffective in failing to\r\n  object to the Stateâ€™s use of a reply witness to impeach a defense witness with\r\n  a prior inconsistent statement without laying a proper foundation?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn\r\n  considering a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, courts presume that\r\n  counsel rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the\r\n  exercise of reasonable professional judgment. Butler v. State,\r\n  286 S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  To receive relief, the\r\n  Petitioner must overcome this presumption by satisfying a two-prong test. Cherry\r\n    v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 117, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989).Â  We must affirm\r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s ruling if there is any probative evidence to support the\r\n  judgeâ€™s factual findings and conclusions. McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557,\r\n  559, 455 S.E.2d 686, 687 (1995).Â  Finding no probative evidence to support the\r\n  PCR courtâ€™s finding, we reverse.\r\nA. Deficient Performance\r\nTo\r\n  show ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must first prove that trial counselâ€™s\r\n  (Counsel) performance was deficient. Dawkins v. State, 346 S.C. 151,\r\n  155-56, 551 S.E.2d 260, 262 (2001).Â  Under this prong, attorney performance is\r\n  measured by its reasonableness â€œunder prevailing professional norms.â€ Id. \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found that Counselâ€™s performance was not deficient in failing to\r\n  object to the reply testimony of Witness. Â The PCR court cited two reasons why Counsel\r\n  acted reasonably in not objecting.Â  First, the PCR court noted that Witnessâ€™s\r\n  testimony in reply was proper.Â  Second, Counsel reasonably anticipated being\r\n  able to call Daughter back to the stand in surrebuttal.Â  \r\n\r\n(1) Smithâ€™s reply\r\n  testimony was not proper.\r\nRule\r\n  613(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence (SCRE) provides that extrinsic\r\n  evidence of a prior inconsistent statement is not admissible unless â€œthe\r\n  witness is advised of the substance of the statement, the time and place it was\r\n  allegedly made, and the person to whom it was made, and is given the\r\n  opportunity to explain or deny the statement.â€Â  It is mandatory that a witness\r\n  be permitted to admit, deny, or explain a prior inconsistent statement. State\r\n    v. McLeod, 362 S.C. 73, 80, 606 S.E.2d 215, 219 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  Since the\r\n  record shows that Daughter was never informed of the date, time, and place of\r\n  the statement, the reply testimony was not proper.Â  \r\n(2) Counsel did not\r\n  articulate valid reasons for employing a trial strategy.\r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Counsel noted that he planned to call Petitionerâ€™s daughter\r\n  (Daughter) in surrebuttal to the reply testimony.Â  The question of surrebuttal,\r\n  however, is irrelevant to Counselâ€™s choice not to object to Smithâ€™s reply\r\n  testimony unless Counselâ€™s trial strategy was to decline to assert Rule 613(b)\r\n  and instead rely on surrebuttal testimony from Daughter.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record demonstrates that Counselâ€™s decision not to object to the reply\r\n  testimony was not based on a trial strategy but instead Counselâ€™s\r\n  misunderstanding of Rule 613(b).Â  When confronted with Smithâ€™s testimony during\r\n  the in-camera hearing, Counsel stated that the testimony would be proper\r\n  reply.Â  Counsel reiterated his view at the Hearing:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tOkay.&nbsp; Do you have any basis why you wouldnâ€™t \r\n\t\t\thave objected [to Smithâ€™s reply testimony]?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA. \r\n\t\t\tI think it was probably pretty proper \r\n\t\t\treply.&nbsp; Damaging, but proper reply.&nbsp; The young lady had \r\n\t\t\tjust â€“ recently had testified on her fatherâ€™s behalf.&nbsp; And then \r\n\t\t\tapparently she had indicated otherwise previously.&nbsp; I think it \r\n\t\t\twas proper reply. \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  record demonstrates that Counsel made a mistake rather than a choice, and thus\r\n  did not fail to object based on trial strategy.\r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo that Counsel acted pursuant to a strategy, Counsel has no valid reason\r\n  for his decision.Â  Where counsel articulates valid reasons for employing a\r\n  certain strategy, counselâ€™s choice of tactics will not be deemed deficient\r\n  performance. Whitehead v. State, 308 S.C. 119, 417 S.E.2d 530 (1992).Â \r\n  â€œCounsel must articulate a valid reason for employing a certain strategy\r\n  to avoid a finding of ineffectiveness.â€ Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467,\r\n  470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 403 (2002) (emphasis in original).Â  Where counsel\r\n  articulates a strategy, it is measured against an objective standard of\r\n  reasonableness. Id.\r\nIn\r\n  choosing not to object to the testimony, Counsel effectively declined to assert\r\n  a right to call Daughter to deny having made the statement, in favor of a\r\n  discretionary right to surrebuttal. See State v. Watson, 353 S.C.\r\n  620, 632, 579 S.E.2d 148, 150 (2003) (â€œAdmission of evidence in surrebuttal is\r\n  very much in the discretion of the trial judge.â€).Â  Counsel never articulated a\r\n  valid reason for the decision not to object.\r\nThere\r\n  is no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s finding that Counselâ€™s performance\r\n  was not deficient.Â  \r\nC. Prejudice\r\nIn\r\n  order to find ineffective assistance of counsel, Petitioner must show not only\r\n  deficient performance but also that Counselâ€™s deficient performance prejudiced\r\n  Petitioner. Dawkins, supra. Â To demonstrate prejudice, the\r\n  applicant must show that but for Counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that the result of the trial would have been different. Id. at 156, 551 S.E.2d at 262.Â  A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient\r\n  to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial. Id.\r\nThe\r\n  State presented no physical evidence and, other than Smith and the victim,\r\n  called only five witnesses.Â  The testimony of all five witnesses focused almost\r\n  solely on the fact that victim had communicated to them that he had been\r\n  sexually abused.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  remainder of the evidence favorable to the State was minimal. Â One investigator\r\n  testified that he observed a bottle of hand lotion on a coffee table in the\r\n  house.Â  The victim testified that Petitioner used lotion when attempting to\r\n  anally penetrate the victim.Â  However, Petitioner and both his daughters\r\n  explained the presence of the lotion as a treatment for Petitionerâ€™s dry hands,\r\n  which he claimed resulted from contact with Agent Orange during the Vietnam\r\n  War.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that there is no probative evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that absent counselâ€™s error, there is no reasonable probability that the result\r\n  of the trial would have been different.Â  Had counsel objected to Witnessâ€™s\r\n  testimony, Daughter would have been called prior to Witnessâ€™s testimony to deny\r\n  or explain the statement.Â  If Daughter had not been called, Witnessâ€™s testimony\r\n  would be barred by Rule 613(b).Â  Instead, Witness was allowed to testify and\r\n  was the next to last witness the jury heard.Â  Moreover, Daughter was never\r\n  called to rebut Witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  It is reasonably probable that the jury\r\n  inferred from Daughterâ€™s failure to testify regarding Witnessâ€™s assertion, an\r\n  admission that Witnessâ€™s statement was true.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThis\r\n  Court must affirm if there is any probative evidence to support the judgeâ€™s\r\n  factual findings and conclusions. McCray, supra.Â  We find there\r\n  is no probative evidence to support the finding that Petitionerâ€™s counsel was\r\n  not ineffective in failing to object to Witnessâ€™s testimony.Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  the finding and remand for a new trial.\r\n\r\nWALLER, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, evidence in the record supports\r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s ruling and I would therefore affirm the decision.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  I agree with the majority that the Witnessâ€™s testimony was improper, in my\r\n  view, Petitioner failed to show prejudice.Â  The Witnessâ€™s testimony, in which\r\n  she told the jury that the Victimâ€™s sister stated to her that she â€œbelievedâ€\r\n  her father had sexually abused the Victim, was extremely brief and the\r\n  solicitor did not mention this testimony in closing arguments.Â  In my opinion,\r\n  the Witnessâ€™s testimony regarding the sisterâ€™s statements had little or no\r\n  impact on the juryâ€™s decision because the jury clearly believed the testimony\r\n  of the eyewitness to the crime, the Victim.Â  For these reasons, I believe that\r\n  Petitioner failed to show a reasonable probability that the result of the trial\r\n  would have been different, and I would therefore affirm the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  decision denying relief.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
