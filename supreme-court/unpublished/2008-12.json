Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Julie M.\r\n          Thames, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Following\r\n  a post-conviction relief hearing, this\r\n  Court granted Tony Stevenson Johnsonâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari and\r\n  granted a belated direct appeal pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C.\r\n  110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  Specifically, this Court instructed Johnson to\r\n  brief whether the trial court erred in denying his directed verdict motion on\r\n  the charges of murder and armed robbery.Â  Johnsonâ€™s counsel addressed this\r\n  issue and attached a petition to be relieved pursuant to Anders v.\r\n    California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â  Johnson also filed a pro se brief.\r\nIn sum, James\r\n  Dozier, III, the victim, was driving to meet friends to go hunting early one\r\n  morning.Â  Dozier stopped at a convenience store where Johnson approached Dozier\r\n  and asked for a ride.Â  After driving Johnson to a neighborhood, Dozier was\r\n  fatally shot by Johnson using one of Dozierâ€™s hunting rifles.Â  At trial,\r\n  Johnson argued the shooting was accidental.Â  The State presented evidence\r\n  indicating Dozier was well-trained in gun safety and an avid hunter.Â \r\n  Additionally, in statements made to the police, Johnson admitted to shooting\r\n  Dozier, though he claimed the shooting was accidental.Â  Following the shooting,\r\n  Johnson took Dozierâ€™s wallet, moved Dozierâ€™s body, and took Dozierâ€™s truck.Â \r\n  The jury was charged on murder, involuntary manslaughter, accident, armed\r\n  robbery, and possession of a weapon during the commission of a crime.Â  Based on\r\n  the record before us, a jury question was presented.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: State\r\n    v. Harris, 351 S.C. 643, 653, 572 S.E.2d 267, 273 (2002) (â€œIf there is any\r\n  direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending\r\n  to prove the guilt of the accused, an appellate court must find that the case\r\n  was properly submitted to the jury.â€); State v. Pinckney, 339 S.C. 346,\r\n  349, 529 S.E.2d 526, 527 (2000) (â€œIn reviewing a refusal to grant a directed\r\n  verdict, we must view the evidence in the light most favorable to the State and\r\n  determine whether there is any direct or substantial circumstantial evidence that\r\n  reasonably tends to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt or from which his guilt may be\r\n  logically deduced.â€).\r\nAfter\r\n  a thorough review of the record and briefs pursuant to Anders v. California,\r\n  386 U.S. 738 (1967), we dismiss the appeal and grant the petition to be\r\n  relieved as counsel.\r\nDISMISSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-051","title":"Stuckey v.

Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner\r\n  was convicted of trafficking in methamphetamines and possession of a firearm.Â  He was sentenced to twenty-five yearsâ€™\r\n  imprisonment for the drug offense, and five yearsâ€™ imprisonment for the weapon\r\n  charge, to run concurrently.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions and\r\nsentences.Â  State v. Collins, Op. No. 2003-UP-131 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 19, 2003).Â Â Â  \r\nOn August 18, 2003, petitioner filed his first application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  Following a hearing, Judge Patterson filed an\r\n  order of dismissal.Â  A notice of appeal was not filed.Â  On February 17, 2007,\r\n  petitioner filed a second PCR application alleging his prior PCR attorney\r\n  failed to perfect an appeal.Â  Following a hearing, Judge Miller granted\r\n  petitionerâ€™s request for a belated review of the denial of his first PCR\r\n  application pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395\r\n  (1991).Â  Petitioner now seeks\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review Judge Millerâ€™s order and has filed a separate brief\r\naddressing the Austin issues. \r\nA PCR applicant is entitled to an Austin appeal if the PCR\r\n  judge finds either that: (1) the applicant requested and was denied an\r\n  opportunity to seek appellate review; or (2) the right to appellate review was\r\n  not knowingly and intelligently waived.Â  Odom v. State, 337 S.C. 256,\r\n523 S.E.2d 753 (1999).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find petitioner failed to show he was entitled to a belated appeal from the\r\n  denial of his first PCR application.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103,\r\n  525 S.E.2d 514 (2000).Â  Petitioner admitted he received a letter from PCR\r\n  counsel informing him that he had thirty days to file a notice ofÂ  appeal and\r\n  that he should contact PCR counsel after reviewing the letter.Â  Petitioner conceded\r\n  he never contacted PCR counsel and only presumed counsel would file a notice of\r\n  appeal on his behalf.Â  PCR counsel testified petitioner never indicated he should\r\n  automatically file a notice of appeal upon receiving an order of dismissal.Â  Therefore,\r\n  petitioner knowingly and voluntarily waived his right to an appeal.Â  Odom,\r\n  337 S.C. 256, 523 S.E.2d 753.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judgeâ€™s order granting\r\npetitioner a belated appeal is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-053","title":"Corley v.
