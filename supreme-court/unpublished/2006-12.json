Clare, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; The State seeks a writ of certiorari to review the order of the circuit court granting respondentâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR) and vacating respondentâ€™s convictions for committing a lewd act on a minor for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; We grant the Stateâ€™s petition, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the decision of the PCR judge.\r\nRespondent was originally indicted for three charges of criminal sexual conduct.[1]&nbsp; He executed a written waiver of presentment and entered a plea to three counts of committing a lewd act on a minor.&nbsp; No new indictments for committing a lewd act on a minor were prepared.\r\nThe PCR judge relied on State v. Smalls, 354 S.C. 498, 381 S.E.2d 850 (Ct. App. 2003), in finding that there was no subject matter jurisdiction because respondent waived presentment on a sentencing sheet and the lewd act charges were not a lesser included offense of the indicted charges.Â  However, this Court has since reversed the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Smalls, holding that a defendant may waive presentment by signing a sentencing sheet that indicates the crime charged without the necessity of preparing another indictment for the charge to which the defendant pled guilty.&nbsp;\r\nState v. Smalls, 364 S.C. 343, 613 S.E.2d 754 (2005).\r\nFurthermore, no objection was made to the waiver of presentment at trial.&nbsp; In State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), this Court held that subject matter jurisdiction refers to the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings belong.&nbsp; Accordingly, a defective indictment procedure does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.&nbsp; In addition, this Court has applied Gentry retroactively to cases involving subject matter jurisdiction in criminal proceedings.Â  See State v. Means, 367 S.C. 374, 626 S.E.2d 348 (2005).\r\nBecause the PCR judge erred in finding that the lack of a new indictment deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction, we reverse the decision of the PCR judge.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The three indictments were for criminal sexual misconduct with a minor in the second degree, assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct in the third degree, and criminal sexual conduct in the third degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-049","title":"Pearson v.
