Oâ€™Neill, Sr., Esquire, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Prior to being tried on various drug charges, respondent successfully moved to suppress evidence of the drugs, arguing they had been obtained pursuant to an illegal seizure.Â  The Court of Appeals upheld the Circuit Courtâ€™s finding that respondent was unlawfully detained by police.Â  However, the Court of Appeals remanded the case to the Circuit Court for a specific ruling on whether respondent voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle notwithstanding the illegal seizure.Â  State v. Johnson, Op. No. 2003-UP-757 (S.C. Ct. App. filed December 23, 2003).\r\nPetitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ ruling that respondent was unlawfully detained by police.Â  Additionally, petitioner seeks review of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to remand the case to the Circuit Court for a specific ruling on whether respondent voluntarily consented to the search of his vehicle.\r\nWe agree respondent was subject to an unlawful seizure.Â  Furthermore, we hold the Circuit Courtâ€™s ruling includes a determination that respondentâ€™s consent to the search of his vehicle was not voluntary.Â  Accordingly, we grant the petition for a writ of certiorari, dispense with further briefing, affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding of an illegal seizure, and vacate that portion of the decision which remands the case to the Circuit Court.\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, VACATED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-012","title":"McLeod v.
