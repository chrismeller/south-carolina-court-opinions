Because there is sufficient\r\nevidence to support the PCR judge's finding that petitioner did not knowingly and\r\nintelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, we grant certiorari on petitioner's\r\nQuestion I, dispense with further briefing, and proceed with a review of the direct\r\nappeal issue pursuant to Davis v.
