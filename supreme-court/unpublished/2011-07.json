State, 325\r\nS.C. 269, 481 S.E.2d 712 (1997).\r\nTrial counsel's strategic decision to recommend against an offer by the State is entitled to deference, and counsel's advice is not rendered ineffective\r\n&quot;simply because, in hindsight the advice was wrongâ€¦.&quot;&nbsp; Judge v. State, 321 S.C. 554, 561, 471 S.E.2d 146, 150 (1996) overruled on\r\nother grounds Jackson v. State, 342 S.C. 95, 535 S.E.2d 926 (2000).&nbsp; Further, we must affirm the PCR judge's findings that counsel had a valid\r\nstrategy, that his performance did not fall below reasonable professional norms, and that petitioner did not show prejudice if they are supported by any\r\nsubstantial evidence in the record.&nbsp; E.g. Lounds v. State, 380 S.C. 454, 670 S.E.2d 646 (2008).\r\nWe find evidence that counsel's decision to advise petitioner to forego the sentencing cap was a valid strategy well within professional norms, and that\r\npetitioner failed to establish any prejudice resulting from her decision to decline the cap.&nbsp;&nbsp; Accordingly, the PCR order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.&nbsp; HEARN, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2011-MO-018","title":"Ruffin v.
