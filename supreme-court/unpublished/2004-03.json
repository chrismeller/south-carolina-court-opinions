Stacey, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, \r\n  Chief Capital &amp; Collateral Litigation Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General Allen Bullard, Assistant Attorney General Douglas E. Leadbitter, \r\n  all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner was convicted of first degree burglary and grand \r\n  larceny.Â  He was sentenced to thirty years for burglary and ten years for grand \r\n  larceny, to run consecutively.Â  On direct appeal, this Court affirmed Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  convictions and sentences.Â  State v. Williams, Op. No. 93-MO-236 (S.C. \r\n  Sup. Ct. filed August 5, 1993).\r\nPetitionerâ€™s first application for Post-Conviction Relief (PCR) was \r\n  denied after a hearing.Â Â  No petition for writ of certiorari was filed.Â  After \r\n  consideration of Petitionerâ€™s second PCR application, Petitioner was granted \r\n  a belated review of the first PCR order.Â  However, the first PCR transcript \r\n  was not available, so this Court granted Petitioner a new PCR hearing.Â  A de \r\n  novo PCR hearing was held, and Petitionerâ€™s application was again denied.Â  \r\n  This petition for writ of certiorari followed.Â  We reverse and remand to the \r\n  trial court for a new trial.\r\nISSUE\r\nWas Petitionerâ€™s trial counsel \r\n  ineffective for failing to object to the trial judgeâ€™s reasonable doubt and \r\n  circumstantial evidence instructions?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner contends his \r\n  trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the trial judgeâ€™s instructions \r\n  on reasonable doubt and circumstantial evidence.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring Petitionerâ€™s trial, the judge instructed the jury on reasonable \r\n  doubt:\r\n\r\nNow by reasonable doubt, I donâ€™t mean a weak or whimsical or imaginary doubt.Â  \r\n  A reasonable doubt is a doubt arising out of the testimony for which a person \r\n  â€“or lack of testimonyâ€”itâ€™s either arising out of the testimony or lack of testimony, \r\n  for which a person honestly seeking the truth can give a reason.Â  \r\n\r\nThe judge also instructed the jury on circumstantial evidence:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\n\r\nNow to the extent that the State relies on circumstantial evidence it must \r\n  prove all of the circumstantial evidence beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  They must \r\n  be wholly and in every particular perfectly consistent with one another.Â  They \r\n  must point conclusively, that is to a moral certainty, to the guilt of \r\n  the accused, to the exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.Â  That is, \r\n  they must be absolutely inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis than \r\n  the guilt of the accused.Â  (emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\nTrial counsel did not object to either of the charges.Â  The State conceded \r\n  at the PCR hearing that today, the charges would constitute reversible error.Â  \r\n  However, the State argued that State v. Manning, 305 S.C. 413, 409 S.E.2d \r\n  372 (1991), which held charges such as these were reversible error, was decided \r\n  after Petitionerâ€™s trial.Â  The State contends, and the PCR court held, that \r\n  trial counsel could not be required to anticipate a change in the law, and since \r\n  Manning was not decided until after Petitionerâ€™s trial, that trial counsel \r\n  was not ineffective in failing to object to the instructions.Â  E.g. Hill \r\n  v. State, 350 S.C. 465, 576 S.E.2d 847 (2002).Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nPetitioner must prove that trial counselâ€™s representation fell below \r\n  reasonable professional norms, and that Petitioner was prejudiced by counselâ€™s \r\n  failure to object to the charge.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. \r\n  668 (1984), Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d 813 (1985).Â  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s trial took place on August 26, 1991.Â  Manning was decided \r\n  on September 9, 1991.Â  However, Cage v. Louisiana, 498 U.S. 39 (1990), \r\n  upon which Manning was based, was decided November 13, 1990.Â  In Cage, \r\n  the United States Supreme Court â€œdisapproved a standard of moral rather than \r\n  evidentiary certainty in determining an accusedâ€™s guilt or innocence.â€Â  Manning, \r\n  409 S.E.2d at 416, citing Cage, 498 U.S. at 41.Â  The State argues that \r\n  although the United States Supreme Court rejected a similar charge in Cage, \r\n  that there was no way for trial counsel to know that â€œthe South Carolina courts \r\n  would agree [and] would still require a clairvoyance aspect to analyzing attorney \r\n  representation.â€ This argument is without merit.Â  Cage was based on the \r\n  Due Process clause, and applied to all of the states. Trial counsel should have \r\n  objected to the charge, based on the decision in Cage, which was decided \r\n  before petitionerâ€™s trial.Â  Trial counselâ€™s representation fell below professional \r\n  norms.Â  \r\nPetitioner must also prove that he was prejudiced by trial \r\n  counselâ€™s representation by showing â€œthere is a reasonable likelihood that the \r\n  jury applied the challenged instruction in a way that violates the Constitution.â€Â  \r\n  Todd v. State, 355 S.C. 396, 309, 585 S.E.2d 305, 308 (2003) quoting \r\n  State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000).Â  In this case, \r\n  the only evidence against Petitioner was circumstantial evidence--fingerprints \r\n  on the outside of a window of the victimâ€™s house.Â  The jury must have relied \r\n  on the circumstantial evidence charge, as that is the only evidence that was \r\n  available to them.Â  Petitioner has proven prejudice.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE the PCR courtâ€™s decision, and REMAND for \r\n  a new trial.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2004-MO-008","title":"deBondt v.

Patterson, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2004-MO-008\r\nHeard January 6, 2004 - Filed March \r\n  15, 2004\r\n\r\nRELIEF GRANTED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHamilton Osborne, Jr., and James Y. Becker, both of Haynsworth \r\n  Sinkler Boyd, P.A., of Columbia, for petitioners.\r\nRobin B. Stilwell, of Hunter, Tomaszek &amp; Stilwell, of \r\n  Greenville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This appeal is from an order vacating petitionersâ€™ offer \r\n  of judgment and placing this case on the trial roster.Â  By unpublished order, \r\n  the Court of Appeals dismissed petitionersâ€™ appeal because an order setting \r\n  a case for trial is not directly appealable.Â  We granted petitionersâ€™ request \r\n  for review.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent deBondt is a car collector.Â  In June 1996, she contracted \r\n  with petitioner Carlton Motorcars, Inc. (Dealership) to purchase the sixteenth \r\n  1998 Mercedes SLK 230 received by the Dealership from petitioner Mercedes-Benz \r\n  (Mercedes).Â  As part of the deal, deBondt was entitled to certain promotional \r\n  materials including CDâ€™s, a keychain, a photo of an SLK prototype, and a â€œfamily \r\n  albumâ€ of previous Mercedes autos.Â  In October 1997, Dealership delivered an \r\n  SLK to deBondt for the purchase price of $42,258.60.Â  DeBondt never received \r\n  the promotional materials.\r\nDeBondt then commenced this action alleging violations \r\n  of the Dealers Act and the Unfair Trade Practices Act, a cause of action for \r\n  fraud, deceit, and negligent misrepresentation, and seeking specific performance.Â  \r\n  In October 1998, Mercedes offered to settle the litigation by providing â€œa pristine \r\n  set of all promotional materials received by charter owners of the SLK 230, \r\n  complete with personalized letters addressed to Ms. deBondtâ€ and an affidavit \r\n  confirming the authenticity of the materials.Â  DeBondt ultimately refused the \r\n  settlement offer claiming the materials were not in the condition promised and \r\n  the personalized letters contained errors.\r\nFinally, in November 1998, the trial court granted petitioners summary \r\n  judgment on all causes of action.Â  By decision dated July 24, 2000, the Court \r\n  of Appeals reversed and remanded for trial.Â  DeBondt v. Carlton Motorcars, \r\n  Inc., 342 S.C. 254, 536 S.E.2d 399 (Ct. App. 2000).\r\nAfter the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, petitioners \r\n  served on deBondt an offer of judgment for $1,000, plus the promotional materials \r\n  being held in trust by deBondtâ€™s former attorney and â€œfour disputed letters \r\n  dated and otherwise revised pursuant to [deBondtâ€™s] written instructions.â€Â  \r\n  This offer of judgment and deBondtâ€™s acceptance was filed with the Clerk of \r\n  Court on October 30, 2000.Â  \r\nOn November 20, 2000, an unrecorded status conference \r\n  was held.Â  As a result, the trial court issued an order setting the case for \r\n  trial the following January.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nIs the trial courtâ€™s order immediately appealable?Â  \r\n  If not, what is petitionersâ€™ remedy?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners characterize the trial courtâ€™s order as one setting \r\n  aside a judgment without the proper procedure and claim this order is therefore \r\n  directly appealable.\r\nRule 68(a), SCRCP, which provides for an offer of judgment, states that the \r\n  clerk of court â€œshall enter judgment upon filing of the notice of an \r\n  offer and acceptance of judgment.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  In this case, judgment \r\n  was never entered after the offer and acceptance of judgment were filed.Â  Instead, \r\n  the trial judge set the case for trial.\r\nA judgment is not final until it is written and entered.Â  Ex parte: \r\n  Reichlyn, 310 S.C. 495, 427 S.E.2d 661 (1993).Â  Because judgment has never \r\n  been entered, there is no final judgment in this case.Â  Further, the Court of \r\n  Appeals correctly noted that an order setting a case for trial is not directly \r\n  appealable.Â  Shields v. Martin Marietta Corp., 303 S.C. 469, 402 S.E.2d \r\n  482 (1991) (order restoring case to docket is not appealable).\r\nWhere an order is not directly appealable, however, this Court may \r\n  consider the appeal as an application for mandamus where appropriate.Â  See \r\n  State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Scholes, 601 F.2d 1151 (10th \r\n  Cir. 1979).Â  Mandamus will issue only when there is a specific right to be enforced, \r\n  a positive duty to be performed, and no other specific remedy.Â  City of Rock \r\n  Hill v. Thompson, 349 S.C. 197, 563 S.E.2d 101 (2001).Â  It is a coercive \r\n  writ that orders a public official to perform a mandatory ministerial duty.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nHere, we find a writ of mandamus appropriate.Â  In pertinent part, our Rule \r\n  68 tracks the language of Rule 68 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  \r\n  As with the federal rule, the language of our rule is mandatory -- once an offer \r\n  and acceptance of judgment have been filed, the trial court has no discretion \r\n  to do anything but enter judgment.Â  Mallory v. Eyrich, 922 F.2d 1273 \r\n  (6th Cir. 1991).Â  Entry of a Rule 68 judgment is simply ministerial.Â  \r\n  Oates v. Oates, 866 F.2d 203 (6th Cir. 1989).Â  \r\nIn this case, once the offer and acceptance of \r\n  judgment were filed, the trial court had no discretion to do anything but order \r\n  that judgment be entered.Â  Petitionersâ€™ only remedy is a writ of mandamus.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, we order that judgment be entered pursuant to Rule 68.\r\n RELIEF GRANTED.  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2004-MO-009","title":"Henfield v.
