finding BB&amp;T held the first mortgage and that\r\n  Countrywide's mortgage was &quot;junior and subordinate.&quot;Â  On February 4,\r\n  2008, the property was sold to a third party.\r\nIn May 2008, Countrywide\r\n  filed an affidavit of default on the part of the Umbargers in this foreclosure\r\n  action, and in June 2008 this suit was referred to the special referee.Â \r\n  BB&amp;T filed a motion for summary judgment seeking a ruling that its lien had\r\n  priority over Countrywide's.Â  This appeal follows from an order granting\r\n  BB&amp;T's motion.Â \r\n On the merits, the\r\n  special referee held BB&amp;T was entitled to summary judgment on the lien priority\r\n  issue on four alternate grounds:\r\n\r\n  (1) BB&amp;T's\r\n    judgment in its foreclosure case was res judicata;\r\n  (2) Countrywide\r\n    waived its right to contest and/or was equitably estopped from challenging the\r\n    priority issue because it chose not to contest the issue at BB&amp;T's January\r\n    2008 hearing despite having been given notice, and indicated at that juncture\r\n    that it would only bid at the sale;\r\n  (3) Laches\r\n    barred Countrywide's claim; and\r\n  (4) that\r\n    Countrywide's remedy was to file a Rule 60(b), SCRCP, motion in the BB&amp;T\r\n    action if it wanted relief from that judgment.\r\n\r\nWhile Countrywide raises a\r\n  number of issues on appeal, we address only one.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    special referee err in giving BB&amp;T's judgment preclusive effect?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe referee's central holding\r\n  was that Countrywide's claim of priority was barred by res judicata by virtue\r\n  of BB&amp;T's judgment in its foreclosure suit.Â  Countrywide raises a number of\r\n  challenges to this ruling.Â  We affirm.\r\nFirst, Countrywide alleges\r\n  that under Rule 13(a), SCRCP, BB&amp;T was required to assert its claim of lien\r\n  priority as a compulsory counterclaim in Countrywide's foreclosure, and that\r\n  since BB&amp;T did not do so, it was improper to file a separate suit.Â \r\n  Assuming that BB&amp;T's priority dispute was a compulsory counterclaim in\r\n  Countrywide's suit, Countrywide provides no authority that BB&amp;T's failure\r\n  to raise the counterclaim affects the validity of BB&amp;T's judgment.Â  In fact,\r\n  according to the note following Rule 13, if a party fails to assert a\r\n  compulsory counterclaim, then a judgment in that action bars further litigation\r\n  of the claim.Â  By failing to assert the claim in BB&amp;T's foreclosure action\r\n  which has gone to judgment, Countrywide is barred from relitigating it here by\r\n  virtue of Rule 13.\r\nCountrywide next claims the\r\n  referee erred in finding res judicata barred its claim for priority.Â  As\r\n  authority, Countrywide cites State v. Bacote, 331 S.C. 328, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  161 (1998) and Aaron v. Mahl, 381 S.C. 585, 674 S.E.2d 482 (2009) for\r\n  the proposition that collateral estoppel does not apply where the issue sought\r\n  to be precluded was decided in a default judgment.Â  Such may be the case for\r\n  collateral estoppel claims, but default judgments are res judicata in the\r\n  absence of fraud or collusion.Â  Morris v. Jones, 329 U.S. 545 (1947).Â \r\n  The referee's ruling here is predicated on res judicata, and Countrywide has\r\n  not claimed fraud or collusion.Â  See also Rule 13(a) analysis, supra.Â \r\nCountrywide also assails\r\n  BB&amp;T for not raising the issue of res judicata in its answer to this suit,\r\n  dated June 18, 2007, yet BB&amp;T's foreclosure suit was not even filed until\r\n  November 8, 2007 and its judgment not filed until January 2008.Â  Countrywide\r\n  also argues that the Court should decline to allow use of the doctrine here\r\n  because BB&amp;T should not have filed its own suit.Â  There is no prohibition\r\n  on BB&amp;T's filing.Â  Countrywide should have filed an answer or made a Rule\r\n  12(b)(8), SCRCP, motion in BB&amp;T's foreclosure suit rather than defaulting.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the special\r\n  referee's order granting BB&amp;T summary judgment as the issue of lien\r\n  priority is res judicata.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,Â  C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Umbargers are not participating in this appeal.\r\n[2] We will refer to this as the Countrywide Mortgage.\r\n[3] This attorney is not representing Countrywide in this appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2011-MO-002","title":"Byrd v.

Johnson, III, of Johnson &amp; Barnette, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This case concerns whether an attorney has a duty\r\n  under Rule 1.15 of our Rules of Professional Conduct to protect the lien of the\r\n  opposing party's former attorney.Â  We decline to find such a duty under the\r\n  circumstances of this case.\r\nI.\r\nMitchell K. Byrd, an\r\n  attorney, represented the plaintiffs in a personal injury action in exchange\r\n  for a contingency fee.Â  Respondents, an attorney and his law firm, represented\r\n  the defendants in that suit.Â  The plaintiffs terminated Byrd[1] and retained new counsel, who ultimately withdrew.Â  The plaintiffs proceeded pro\r\n    se and negotiated a settlement with Wausau Underwriters Insurance Companies, the defendants' insurance\r\n  carrier.\r\nPrior to the settlement, Byrd\r\n  notified Respondents that he would claim a lien against the settlement proceeds\r\n  to secure payment of his purported attorney's fees and costs.Â  Respondents paid\r\n  the settlement proceeds to the plaintiffs and did not withhold any funds from\r\n  the settlement in connection with Byrd's lien.[2]Â \r\n  When Byrd's former clients did not pay him, Byrd brought this suit against Respondents\r\n  seeking actual and punitive damages.\r\nThe circuit court found\r\n  Respondents were entitled to summary judgment as to Byrd's causes of action for\r\n  negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, conversion, and an accounting because\r\n  they did not have a duty to protect Byrd's lien.\r\nByrd now argues Respondents\r\n  had a duty under Rule 1.15, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, not to disburse\r\n  funds that were subject to his lien.[3]\r\nII.\r\n&quot;The existence of a duty\r\n  owed is a question of law for the courts.&quot;Â  Doe ex rel. Doe v. Batson,\r\n  345 S.C. 316, 323, 548 S.E.2d 854, 857 (2001).\r\nRule\r\n  1.15(e) provides:\r\n\r\n  When in\r\n    the course of representation a lawyer is in possession of property in which two\r\n    or more persons (one of whom may be the lawyer) claim interests, the property\r\n    shall be kept separate by the lawyer until the dispute is resolved.Â  The lawyer\r\n    shall promptly distribute all portions of the property as to which the\r\n    interests are not in dispute.\r\n\r\nComment\r\n  4 to Rule 1.15 provides:\r\n\r\n  Paragraph\r\n    (e) also recognizes that third parties may have lawful claims against specific\r\n    funds . . . in a lawyer's custody, such as a client's creditor who has a lien\r\n    on funds recovered in a personal injury action.Â  A lawyer may have a duty under\r\n      applicable law to protect such third-party claims against wrongful\r\n    interference by the client.Â  In such cases, when the third-party claim is not\r\n    frivolous under applicable law, the lawyer must refuse to surrender the\r\n    property to the client until the claims are resolved.A lawyer should not unilaterally assume to arbitrate a\r\n    dispute between the client and the third party, but, when there are substantial\r\n    grounds for dispute as to the person entitled to the funds, the lawyer may file\r\n    an action to have a court resolve the dispute.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  This\r\n  comment suggests that Rule 1.15(e) does not provide an independent source for a\r\n  duty to third parties; rather, a lawyer &quot;may have a duty under applicable\r\n  law.&quot;Â  Cf. Moore v. Weinberg, 383 S.C. 583, 588, 681 S.E.2d\r\n  875, 878 (2009) (&quot;Under the facts of this case, the duty arises from an\r\n  attorney's role as an escrow agent and is independent of an attorney's status\r\n  as a lawyer and distinct from duties that arise out of the\r\n  attorney/client relationship.&quot;).Â  Under the circumstances of this case, we\r\n  decline to find Respondents owed a duty to Byrd by operation of Rule 1.15.[4]\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nPLEICONES, ACTING CHIEF\r\n  JUSTICE, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justices James E.

Rainwater,\r\n  376 S.C. 256, 657 S.E.2d 449 (2008). [2]\r\nII.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, we are unable to consider the State's arguments.Â  It is axiomatic that issues not involving\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction may not be raised for the first time on appeal, but\r\n  must have been raised to and\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court in order to be considered on appeal.Â  The burden\r\n  of providing a sufficient record is on the State as the appealing party.Â  Because\r\n  there is no indication any contemporaneous objections were made to the magistrate's\r\n  entry of a directed verdict\r\n  and to the propriety of this ruling, no issue was preserved for appeal in this\r\n  regard.Â  \r\nWe hold the issue is not properly before this Court for\r\n  consideration and, therefore, affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR and the\r\n  following authorities:Â  State v. Johnson,&nbsp;363 S.C. 53, 58, 609\r\n  S.E.2d 520, 523&nbsp;(2005) (&quot;To\r\n  preserve an issue for review there must be a contemporaneous objection that is\r\n  ruled upon by the trial court.&quot;); id. at 58-59, 609 S.E.2d at 523 (&quot;If\r\n  a party fails to properly object, the party is procedurally barred from raising the issue on appeal.&quot;); State v.

Hutto, 279 S.C. 131, 303 S.E.2d 90 (1983)\r\n  (affirming the State's appeal where it presented an insufficient record to\r\n  enable review of the issue on appeal); State v.

Few, Circuit Court Judge\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2011-MO-004\r\nSubmitted December 1, 2010 â€“ Filed January\r\n  31, 2011Â Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED \r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDaniel Lawrence Prenner, Prenner Marvel, P.A., of Charleston, for\r\n  Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney General Alan Wilson, Chief Deputy Attorney General John\r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Office of the\r\n  Attorney General, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL:Â  Petitioner seeks a\r\n  writ of certiorari from the denial of his application for post-conviction\r\n  relief (PCR).\r\nSince two members of this Court have determined that there is\r\n  sufficient evidence to support the PCR judge's finding that petitioner did not\r\n  knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, this Court\r\n  grants a writ of certiorari to review the direct appeal issue pursuant to pursuant\r\n  to Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986).Â  We dispense with\r\n  further briefing or argument regarding the direct appeal issue.Â  \r\nAs the direct appeal issue, petitioner argues that he was entitled\r\n  to a directed verdict because the evidence was insufficient to support his magistrate\r\n  court conviction for malicious injury to personal property.Â  He asserts that he\r\n  is entitled to a new trial since it is impossible to adequately reconstruct the\r\n  record to allow for a meaningful review of this direct appeal issue.Â  While we\r\n  agree it is impossible to reconstruct the record of the magistrate court proceedings,\r\n  we disagree that this entitles petitioner to a new trial.\r\nThe magistrate court conviction occurred in 1992.Â  The only record\r\n  of this conviction is the Uniform Traffic Ticket, and it indicates that petitioner\r\n  was sentenced to thirty days.Â  No return, transcript or audio tape apparently exists\r\n  of the criminal proceeding.Â  The magistrate has no recollection of petitioner's\r\n  case, although the magistrate did present some testimony about his general\r\n  practice in criminal cases.Â  Therefore, we agree that it is impossible to\r\n  adequately reconstruct the record of the proceedings before the magistrate\r\n  court.\r\nIf it is impossible to adequately reconstruct the record to allow\r\n  for meaningful appellate review, the general rule has been to grant a new\r\n  trial. Â State v. Ladson, 373 S.C. 320, 644 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (timely appeal, but court reporter could not produce transcript due to a\r\n  failure of the recording equipment).Â Â  Where, however, the inability to\r\n  adequately reconstruct the record is due to some fault or unreasonable delay on\r\n  the part of appellant, the appeal has instead been dismissed. Cf. State v. Serrette, 375 S.C. 650, 654 S.E.2d 554 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007) (tapes of trial destroyed during the ten year delay between trial in absentia and sentencing while appellant was a fugitive). \r\nIn the present case, petitioner waited over fourteen years after\r\n  his conviction to seek a belated direct appeal.Â  After this period of delay, it\r\n  should come as no surprise that it is impossible to adequately reconstruct the\r\n  record.Â  Further, this delay is attributable to petitioner.Â  Under these\r\n  circumstances, we hold that a new trial is not appropriate.Â  Instead, the belated\r\n  appeal must be dismissed since it is impossible to review the directed verdict\r\n  issue without an adequate record.\r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED. \r\n\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent,\r\n  and would reverse petitioner's conviction for malicious injury to personal\r\n  property due to the lack of a record for appellate review.\r\nAs\r\n  the majority recognizes, petitioner's argument could well be barred by laches.Â \r\n  However, as we explained in Dearybury v. State, 367 S.C. 34, 625 S.E.2d\r\n  212 (2006), laches is an affirmative defense that must be pled or it is\r\n  waived.Â  In my opinion, because the State did not raise laches as an\r\n  affirmative defense at the PCR hearing, it is waived.\r\nI\r\n  would therefore find petitioner is entitled to a new trial pursuant to State\r\n    v. Ladson, 373 S.C. 320, 644 S.E.2d 271 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nFor the reasons\r\n  given above, I respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2011-MO-005","title":"State v.
