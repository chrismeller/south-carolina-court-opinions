Wood, Jr., and A. Mattison Bogan, all of Nelson,\r\n  Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tA.\r\n  Glenn Greene, Jr., of Greene and Huggins, of Dillon, Robert Francis McMahan,\r\n  Jr., of Harris and Graves, of Columbia, and William Jones Rivers, III, Â of\r\n  Schurlknight and Rivers, of Florence, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  Appellant appeals an order finding coverage under its policy for an accident\r\n  which occurred while its insured (driver) was operating a truck belonging to\r\n  driverâ€™s father.Â  We hold that coverage is barred by an exclusion in the\r\n  policy, and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nDriverâ€™s father owned the truck which was\r\n  furnished for driverâ€™s motherâ€™s use. Â Driver, who was expressly forbidden to\r\n  drive the truck by his parents, nevertheless took it and picked up the\r\n  respondents.Â  When mother became aware that driver had taken the truck, she\r\n  called him and ordered him to immediately bring it back to his parentsâ€™ house.Â \r\n  The accident occurred after this phone call.\r\nAppellant brought\r\n  this declaratory judgment action against driver, the surviving passengers, and\r\n  the estate of the passenger who died as a result of the wreck.Â  Appellant made\r\n  a number of arguments why its policy did not provide coverage under these\r\n  circumstances.Â  The circuit court found against appellant on each issue.Â  We\r\n  find it necessary to address only one.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the\r\n  circuit court err in holding that exclusion 18 did not apply so as to bar coverage\r\n  under appellantâ€™s policy?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant issued a\r\n  policy to driver insuring driverâ€™s Buick automobile.Â  The circuit court held\r\n  first that fatherâ€™s truck qualified as a temporary substitute vehicle under\r\n  section 9c of the policy.Â  This section defines â€œYour Insured Autoâ€ to include:\r\n\r\n\tAny\r\n  auto not owned by you while you are temporarily driving it as a substitute for\r\n  any other auto described in this definition because of its withdrawal from\r\n  normal use due to breakdown, repair, servicing, loss or destruction.\r\n\r\nIt is uncontested that the\r\n  automobile insured under appellantâ€™s policy was inoperable at the time driver\r\n  took his fatherâ€™s truck.Â  Moreover, the circuit court held that before a\r\n  vehicle could qualify as a â€œYour Insured Auto,â€ it must be operated with\r\n  permission.Â  The circuit court held that mother, a named insured under the\r\n  truckâ€™s policy, had given driver permission to drive the truck when she ordered\r\n  him to return it.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court concluded that insurer could not rely on exclusion 18 which eliminates\r\n  coverage for:\r\n\r\n\t18.&nbsp; Bodily injury or property damage\r\n  while using an auto without or beyond the scope of the ownerâ€™s expressed or\r\n  implied permission.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court reasoned\r\n  the exclusion was ambiguous because it only excludes coverage for\r\n  non-permissive use of an â€œautoâ€ and does not specifically address whether it also\r\n  applies to a vehicle meeting the policyâ€™s definition of â€œYour Insured Auto.â€Â  The\r\n  circuit court again concluded that mother had given driver permission to drive\r\n  the truck within the meaning of exclusion 18.\r\nAppellant argues\r\n  that under the exclusion the question is whether the owner of the automobile\r\n  gave permission.Â  It contends there is simply no evidence that the truckâ€™s\r\n  owner, driverâ€™s father, gave driver express or implied permission to take the\r\n  truck.Â  In fact, the only evidence is that father explicitly prohibited driver,\r\n  both verbally and in the truckâ€™s policy, from operating the vehicle.Â  Appellant\r\n  argues, and we agree, that whether mother gave permission is irrelevant as its\r\n  policy requires the auto be driven with the ownerâ€™s consent.Â  Insurer next\r\n  contends there is no ambiguity in exclusion 18â€™s reference to â€œautoâ€ without\r\n  also specifically referencing â€œYour Insured Auto.â€Â  We agree.Â  Under the\r\n  definitions of the policy, all â€œYour Insured Autosâ€ are â€œautosâ€ but not all\r\n  autos are â€œYour Insured Autos.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  term â€œautoâ€ in exclusion 18 means â€œa land motor vehicle or trailer designed for\r\n  travel on public roads,â€[2] and necessarily includes those autos which also meet the limited definition of\r\n  â€œYour Insured Auto.â€Â  There is no ambiguity in exclusion 18.Â  Furthermore, even\r\n  assuming mother gave driver permission to operate the truck, that permission\r\n  does not vitiate exclusion 18 which requires the ownerâ€™s (i.e. fatherâ€™s) permission.Â \r\n  The circuit court erred in failing to find exclusion 18 applies so as to deny\r\n  coverage to respondents under the policy issued by appellant to driver.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order finding\r\n  appellantâ€™s policy provided coverage to the respondents is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Whether motherâ€™s instruction constituted permission is not necessary to our\r\n  resolution of this case, but we are doubtful of this conclusion.\r\n[2] This is the driverâ€™s policyâ€™s definition of â€œauto.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-035","title":"Widdicombe v.
