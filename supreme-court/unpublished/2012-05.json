G.J. Creel &amp; Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 465 S.E.2d 84 (1995) (holding the\r\n  trial court did not err in finding the plaintiff failed to present any evidence\r\n  that the defendant committed an unfair or deceptive act and in granting a\r\n  directed verdict to the defendant on the plaintiff's UTPA claim); LaMotte v.\r\n    Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370 S.E.2d 711 (1988) (upholding\r\n  the trial court's grant of summary judgment on a claim for violation of the\r\n  UTPA where there was no genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\r\n  defendants engaged in unfair acts that affected a public interest); see also\r\n    Havird Oil Co. v. Marathon Oil Co., 149 F.3d 283 (4th Cir. 1998) (relying\r\n  upon the Adams decision and finding the plaintiff's UTPA claim failed\r\n  where there was no evidence of an unfair act); Wogan v. Kunze, 366 S.C.\r\n  583, 623 S.E.2d 107 (Ct. App. 2005) (holding a plaintiff may not change the theory of recovery, and\r\n  that an issue must first be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be\r\n  subject to appellate review).\r\nAs to Issue II\r\n  (Motion to Compel), counsel for Appellant indicated at oral argument that this issue\r\n  was being waived based on the propriety of the trial court's ruling, and we\r\n  agree the issue lacks merit.  \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
