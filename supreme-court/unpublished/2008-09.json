David Sawyer, Jr., Family Court Judge\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2008-MO-038\r\nHeard June 11, 2008 â€“ Filed September 8,\r\n  2008 \r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTimothy\r\n  E. Madden and Reid T. Sherard, both of Nelson Mullins Riley &amp; Scarborough, of\r\n  Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tThomas\r\n  M. Neal, III, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review\r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Powell v. Powell, Op. No 2005-UP-595,\r\n  S.C. Ct. App. filed Nov. 21 2005).Â  Â We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThis is a divorce\r\n  action in which Wife filed a complaint seeking a divorce on grounds of\r\n  adultery.Â  After a three day trial, the family court granted Wife a divorce\r\n  based on Husbandâ€™s adultery.Â  The family court awarded Wife $4,000 per month in\r\n  alimony and apportioned the marital property, sixty-eight percent to Wife and\r\n  thirty-two percent to Husband.Â  Additionally, the family court ordered Husband\r\n  to maintain Wifeâ€™s medical insurance, maintain a life insurance policy naming\r\n  Wife as an irrevocable beneficiary to secure his alimony obligation, pay Wife\r\n  $30,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees, and pay $9,000 for Wifeâ€™s expert witness.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed in part, and reversed in part.Â  Taking its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence, the Court of Appeals found the family court\r\n  erred in granting Wife a divorce on the ground of Husbandâ€™s adultery. Â It held\r\n  Husband had not condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery, and found Husband had established the\r\n  defense of recrimination to Wifeâ€™s request for a divorce based on adultery.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals modified the decree to grant the partiesâ€™ divorce on the\r\n  ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.Â  \r\nSince it found Wife\r\n  had not proved Husband condoned her adultery, the Court of Appeals held she was\r\n  barred from receiving alimony.Â  Accordingly, the family courtâ€™s award of\r\n  alimony, its order requiring Husband to maintain Wifeâ€™s health insurance\r\n  coverage, and its order requiring Husband to maintain life insurance to secure\r\n  the alimony, were reversed.Â  The award of attorneyâ€™s fees and costs to Wife was\r\n  remanded to the family court.Â  We granted certiorari.\r\nISSUE[1]\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family\r\n  courtâ€™s holding that Husband condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWife\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the family courtâ€™s holding\r\n  that Husband had condoned her adultery, claiming it failed to give the family\r\n  courtâ€™s finding due deference, particularly with reference to matters of\r\n  credibility.Â Â  We agree.\r\nIn appeals from the\r\n  family court, the appellate court has the authority to correct errors of law\r\n  and to find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the\r\n  evidence.Â  Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532, 540, 615 S.E.2d 98, 102\r\n  (2005); Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 311, 384 S.E.2d 715, 717\r\n  (1989).Â  However, this broad scope of review does not require this court to\r\n  disregard the family courtâ€™s findings.Â  Appellate courts should be mindful that\r\n  the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, sits in a better position to\r\n  evaluate credibility and assign comparative weight to the testimony.Â  Because\r\n  the appellate court lacks the opportunity for direct observation of the\r\n  witnesses, it should accord great deference to trial court findings where\r\n  matters of credibility are involved.Â  Marquez v. Caudill, 376 S.C. 229,\r\n  656 S.E.2d 737 (2008); Dodge v. Dodge, 332 S.C. 401, 505 S.E.2d 344\r\n  (Ct.App.1998).Â  â€œ[W]here there is disputed evidence, the appellate court may adhere\r\n  to the findings of the family court. . . .Â  Because the family court is in a\r\n  superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, its findings should\r\n  be given broad discretion. . . . Furthermore, the appellate court â€˜should be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the evidence . . . for that\r\n  of the [family] court.â€™â€Â  Scott v. Scott, 354 S.C. 118, 124, 579 S.E.2d\r\n  620, 623 (2003).Â  (Emphasis supplied; internal citation omitted).Â  \r\nCondonation is the\r\n  forgiveness, either express or implied, of a prior matrimonial offense by one\r\n  spouse for a breach of marital duty by the other on the condition that it not\r\n  be repeated.Â  It is primarily a state of mind, the existence of which may\r\n  appear either from the language used, from conduct, or both.Â  Wilson v. Wilson, 274 S.C. 236, 262 S.E.2d 732 (1980); McLaughlin v. McLaughlin,\r\n  244 S.C. 265, 136 S.E.2d 537 (1964).Â  Condonation may be presumed from\r\n  cohabitation; and a lapse of time, or continuance of marital cohabitation with\r\n  knowledge of the offense, raises a presumption of condonation.Â  Although this\r\n  presumption may be rebutted by evidence of the accompanying circumstances, the\r\n  burden of rebutting it is on the plaintiff.Â  McLaughlin.Â  \r\nIt is undisputed\r\n  here that both parties engaged in adulterous relationships.Â  The sole issue is\r\n  whether Husband condoned Wifeâ€™s adultery, and if not, whether he proved the\r\n  defense of recrimination, as a bar to Wifeâ€™s receipt of alimony.Â  The family\r\n  court held as follows:\r\n\r\n\tHusband\r\n  claims Wife committed adultery with Ray Wright in about 1997.Â  At trial,\r\n  Husband contended he first learned of Wifeâ€™s adultery at the deposition of Wife\r\n  taken in this case on September 5, 2001.Â  However, in his original, pro se\r\n  Answer and Counterclaim, Husband alleged Wife committed adultery with Mr.\r\n  Wright.Â  In this affidavit he filed at the temporary hearing, Husband swore\r\n  Wife â€œbecame involved in an adulterous affair with Ray Wright.â€Â  At his own\r\n  deposition, prior to the deposition of Wife, Husband maintained he\r\n  believed Wife committed adultery with Mr. Wright based on a telephone\r\n  conversation he had with Mrs. Wright.Â  Wife credibly testified at trial that\r\n  Husband confronted her about Mr. Wright in about 1997.Â  It was clear to Wife\r\n  that Husband believed she had committed adultery with Mr. Wright and Husband\r\n  told Wife to â€œtake care of it.â€Â  Therefore, even if Husband met his burden of\r\n  proof and appropriately corroborates Wifeâ€™s adultery, Wife provided through clear\r\n  and convincing evidence that any adultery committed by her was condoned and\r\n  forgiven by Husband prior to the separation of the parties and prior to the\r\n  commencement of Husbandâ€™s adulterous relationship with Ms. Marlett.Â  \r\n\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed the finding of condonation, finding Husbandâ€™s allegations that\r\n  he believed Wife had engaged in an adulterous affair were not tantamount to\r\n  â€œfull knowledgeâ€ of the affair.[2] Â The Court of Appeals found that, prior to Wifeâ€™s deposition, Husband had only\r\n  a suspicion that Wife engaged in an adulterous affair.Â Â  \r\nAlthough we are\r\n  mindful that an appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance of\r\n  the evidence, under the limited factual circumstances presented, we find the\r\n  Court of Appeals erred in substituting its own view of the evidence.Â  Husband\r\n  testified that although he believed Wife had had an affair, this belief was not\r\n  confirmed until the time of Wifeâ€™s deposition.Â  The family court held, â€œWife\r\n  credibly testified at trial that Husband confronted her about Mr. Wright in\r\n  about 1997.Â  It was clear to Wife that Husband believed she had committed\r\n  adultery with Mr. Wright and Husband told Wife to â€œtake care of it.â€ Â Â The\r\n  family court, which heard and saw the witnesses, was in the better position to\r\n  assess the credibility of the parties and specifically found Wifeâ€™s testimony\r\n  credible.Â  Given these facts, we find the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  substituting its own view of the evidence on the issue of witness credibility.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding, and reinstate the order\r\n  of the family court.Â  \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice Peter L. Fuge, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  We need address only Wifeâ€™s first issue.\r\n[2]Â  In holding Husband did not condone Wifeâ€™s\r\n  conduct because he did not have â€œfull knowledgeâ€ of the affair, the Court of Appeals\r\n  employed a standard of â€œknowledgeâ€ which is not consistent with our established\r\n  law of condonation.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding based on this\r\n  application of a heightened standard is reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-039","title":"Scott v.
