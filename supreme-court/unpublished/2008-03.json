Dixon Lee, III, of McLaren &amp; Lee, of Columbia, for\r\n  Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: Â These are consolidated appeals from family court orders which a) disqualified\r\n  attorney J. Mark Taylor from representing Appellant, Shirley Hammer, in the\r\n  underlying action for separate maintenance and support; and b) denied\r\n  Appellantâ€™s motions for a de novo trial or in the alternative to\r\n  reconsider or amend the order disqualifying her attorney.Â  We affirm in part\r\n  and reverse in part.Â Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant,\r\n  Shirley Hammer (Wife), and Respondent, Howard Hammer (Husband), were married in\r\n  September 1998, and have two small children.Â Â  Wife filed an action for\r\n  separate maintenance and support in September 2005.Â  Wife was represented by attorney\r\n  J. Mark Taylor. Â \r\nUpon learning of Taylorâ€™s representation of Wife on September 2,\r\n  2005, Husband immediately objected to Taylorâ€™s representation on the ground\r\n  that Taylorâ€™s law partner, Jake Moore, had previously represented Husband in a\r\n  collections matter against a former girlfriend.Â  The collections matter ended\r\n  in 1995, three years before the parties married.Â  Taylor concluded there was no\r\n  impermissible conflict.Â  Husband took no further action to have Wifeâ€™s attorney\r\n  relieved.Â   \r\nA Temporary Consent Order was entered on September 14, 2005,\r\n  stipulating to custody, visitation, and financial matters.Â  Approximately 15\r\n  monthsÂ  later, on December 8, 2006, Wife filed a Complaint and Rule to Show\r\n  Cause seeking to have Husband held in contempt for failing to comply with the\r\n  Temporary Consent Order.Â  Husband responded and moved to have attorney J. Mark\r\n  Taylor disqualified from representing Wife due to his partnership with Jake\r\n  Moore.Â  Husband contended Taylor had imputed knowledge of his â€œemotional\r\n  makeupâ€ and that the prior matter involved â€œinterpersonal relationships and\r\n  other matters of a private, confidential and personal nature among other\r\n  things.â€Â   \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before Judge Rolly Jacobs on April 11, 2007.Â  At the\r\n  conclusion of the hearing, Judge Jacobs orally ruled that Taylor was\r\n  disqualified from representing Wife due to his partnership in the firm which\r\n  previously represented Husband in the collection action against the former\r\n  girlfriend.Â  Judge Jacobs instructed Husbandâ€™s attorney, James McLaren, to\r\n  prepare an order, which he did.Â  After being reviewed by both sides, a proposed\r\n  order was mailed to Judge Jacobs on Friday, May 4, 2007.Â  Judge Jacobs signed\r\n  the order on Tuesday, May 8, 2007; he then forwarded the order to McLaren for\r\n  filing.Â  The order arrived at McLarenâ€™s office on Friday, May 11, 2007, a day\r\n  when McLaren was in Court in Greenville.Â Â  Judge Jacobs died unexpectedly on\r\n  Sunday, May 13, 2007.Â  McLaren filed the order with the Richland County Clerk\r\n  of Court on Tuesday, May 15, 2007.\r\nOn May\r\n  18, 2007, Wife filed a Motion for a De Novo Hearing and/or\r\n  Reconsideration, Alteration, or Amendment alleging Judge Jacobsâ€™ order was void\r\n  because it had not been filed at the time of his death.Â  Judge Stephen Bartlett\r\n  held a hearing on May 31, 2007.Â  Judge Bartlett held that, pursuant to Rule 63,\r\n  SCRCP, Judge Jacobsâ€™ order had been issued at the time of his death, such that\r\n  his order was a valid order and therefore he, Judge Bartlett, was without\r\n  authority or jurisdiction to alter or amend Judge Jacobsâ€™ order.Â  Judge\r\n  Bartlett declined to consider the affidavits of Wife filed subsequent to the\r\n  hearing before Judge Jacobs, and declined to address the merits of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  contention that her attorney had been improperly disqualified.Â  Wife appeals\r\n  both orders.[1]  \r\nISSUES\r\n1.Â  Did\r\n  Judge Bartlett err in holding Judge Jacobsâ€™ order was valid and enforceable,\r\n  notwithstanding it was not filed until after Judge Jacobsâ€™ death?\r\n2. Did\r\n  Judge Jacobs err in ruling Taylor was prohibited from representing Wife?\r\n \r\n1.Â  JUDGE\r\n  BARTLETTâ€™S ORDER\r\nWife contends\r\n  Judge Jacobsâ€™ order is void and that she is entitled to a new trial pursuant to\r\n  this Courtâ€™s opinion in Christy v. Christy, 354 S.C. 203, 580 S.E.2d 444\r\n  (2004), and Rule 63, SCRCP.Â  We disagree.Â   \r\nChristy involved the interpretation of Rule 63, SCRCP, prior to its 2004 amendment.Â  In Christy, a family court judge (Judge Black) heard claims relating to a\r\n  common law marriage but became incapacitated prior to signing an order.Â  A\r\n  second family court judge (Judge Segars-Andrews) succeeded Judge Black, and\r\n  denied the respondentâ€™s motion for a new trial pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP.Â  Judge\r\n  Segars-Andrews later signed an order, based in part on a draft order submitted\r\n  to Judge Black.Â  The order found no common law marriage.Â  The Court of Appeals\r\n  vacated Judge Segars-Andrewsâ€™ order, finding she erred in denying respondentâ€™s\r\n  request for a new trial following Judge Blackâ€™s incapacity; the Court of\r\n  Appeals remanded the common law marriage issue for a new determination.Â  Christy\r\n    v. Christy, 347 S.C. 503, 556 S.E.2d 701 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  This Court affirmed\r\n  as modified.Â  Christy, 354 S.C. 203, 580 S.E.2d 444.Â  Although we found no\r\n  error in the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis of Rule 63, SCRCP, we found the case was\r\n  governed by another principle of state law, to wit, the principle that â€œ[u]ntil\r\n  the paper has been delivered by the judge to the clerk of court, to be filed by\r\n  him as an order in the case, it is subject to the control of the judge, and may\r\n  be withdrawn at any time before such delivery.â€Â  Christy, 354 S.C. at\r\n  206, 580 S.E.2d at 446.Â  No written order having been filed with the clerk of\r\n  court prior to Judge Blackâ€™s incapacity, this Court held a new trial was\r\n  required.Â   \r\nRelying\r\n  on Christy, Wife contends Judge Bartlett erred in denying her motion for\r\n  a new trial.Â  We disagree.Â  At the time Christy was decided, Rule 63, SCRCP,\r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n\tIf by reason of death, sickness, or other disability, a judge\r\n  before whom an action has been tried is unable to perform the duties to be\r\n  performed by the court under these rules after a verdict is returned or\r\n    findings of fact and conclusions of law are filed, then the resident judge\r\n  of the circuit or any other judge having jurisdiction in the court in which the\r\n  action was tried may perform those duties; but if such other judge is satisfied\r\n  that he cannot perform those duties because he did not preside at the trial or\r\n  for any other reason, he may in his discretion grant a new trial.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â  However, the year following our opinion in Christy, Rule 63\r\n  was amended to conform to the requirements of Rule 63, FRCP.Â Â  It now reads:\r\n\r\n\tIf at any time after a trial or hearing has been commenced, but \r\n\tbefore\r\n  the final order or judgment has been issued, the judge is unable to\r\n  proceed, a successor judge shall be assigned. The successor judge may proceed\r\n  upon certifying familiarity with the record and determining that the\r\n  proceedings may be completed without prejudice to the parties. In a hearing or\r\n  a trial without a jury, the successor judge shall, at the request of a party,\r\n  recall any witness whose testimony is material and disputed and who is\r\n  available to testify without undue burden. A successor judge may also provide\r\n  for the recall of any witnesses.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â   \r\nJudge\r\n  Bartlett found the purpose of Rule 63 was to ensure that a proceeding which had\r\n  started had been completed.Â  He further found that the 2004 amendments made two\r\n  changes: 1) changing the language from filed to issued, and 2) removing the\r\n  authority of the successor to grant a new trial.Â  He found under the unique\r\n  facts of this case, that Judge Jacobs had completed the proceedings before him\r\n  such that there was no need for a successor judge.Â  We agree.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of Rule 63 is to ensure that a proceeding has been completed.Â  Here, it\r\n  is clear both from Judge Jacobsâ€™ bench rulings, and the signed order that the\r\n  hearing was complete.Â  Wifeâ€™s reliance upon Christy overlooks the\r\n  amendment to Rule 63, and the deliberate inclusion of the language concerning\r\n  when a final judgment or order has been â€œissued.â€Â  Given the specific language\r\n  of the rule, it is not for this Court to attach a new meaning.Â  See Farnswoth\r\n    v. Davis Heating and Air Cond., 367 S.E.2d 634, 627 S.E.2d 724 (2006); Maxwell\r\n      v. Genez, 356 S.C. 617, 620, 591 S.E.2d 26, 27 (2003) (in interpreting the\r\n  meaning of Rules of Civil Procedure, this Court applies the same rules of\r\n  construction used to interpret statutes); State v. Muldrow, 348 S.C.\r\n  264, 268, 559 S.E.2d 847, 849 (2002) (words of a statute must be given their\r\n  plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to\r\n  limit or expand the statuteâ€™s operation). Â \r\nUnder the very limited facts of this case, we find Judge Jacobsâ€™ order\r\n  was â€œissuedâ€ after it was signed and sent to Counsel for filing.Â   \r\n2.Â \r\n  DISQUALIFICATION OF ATTORNEY TAYLOR\r\nWife\r\n  asserts Judge Jacobs erred in disqualifying attorney Taylor, contending Husband\r\n  waived any right to complain about any alleged conflict on the part of Taylor.Â  Â We agree.Â Â  We find Husband was estopped to seek disqualification of Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorney where he waited for fifteen months after institution of the\r\n  proceedings, at a time when Wife sought to have him held in contempt.Â  Cf.Â  Strickland v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 650 S.E.2d 465 (2007) (one who\r\n  delays unreasonably could be said to be estopped from asserting a claim if\r\n  another has relied on that delay to his detriment).Â Â  Â Â \r\nIn any\r\n  event, we do not find that the prior representation by attorney Taylorâ€™s\r\n  partner was substantially related to the present matter.Â  Townsend v.\r\n    Townsend, 323 S.C. 309, 317, 474 S.E.2d 424, 429 (1996).Â  Accordingly, Judge\r\n  Jacobs erred in disqualifying Wifeâ€™s attorney.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  affirm Judge Bartlettâ€™s order holding Judge Jacobsâ€™ order valid and\r\n  enforceable.Â  However, we reverse Judge Jacobsâ€™ order disqualifying Wifeâ€™s\r\n  attorney.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The appeals were transferred from the Court of\r\n  Appeals to this Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-013","title":"Morris v.

App. 2006), the trial court granted\r\n  the cityâ€™s motion to dismiss the contractorâ€™s breach of statute claim on the\r\n  grounds that the bond statute did not give rise to a private right of action by\r\n  the contractor against the city.Â  This appeal followed.Â   \r\nWe vacate\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision pursuant to this Courtâ€™s decision in Sloan\r\n    Construction Co., Inc. v. Southco Grassing, Inc., Op.\r\n  No. 26462 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 24, 2008) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 13 at 32) (holding that the governmentâ€™s failure to comply with statutory bonding requirements\r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250 (Supp. 2006) gives rise to both a negligence claim\r\n  and a third-party beneficiary breach of contract claim by the subcontractor\r\n  against the government).Â  Accordingly, we remand the case to the trial court\r\n  for a determination of whether the city breached a statutory or contractual\r\n  duty owed to the contractor pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-6-250.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Alexander S. Macaulay,\r\n  concur.\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-017","title":"Johnson v.

McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh,\r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney\r\n  General S. Prentiss Counts, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner pled guilty to armed robbery\r\n  and first-degree\r\n  burglary and was sentenced to concurrent terms of eighteen yearsâ€™\r\n  imprisonment.Â  No direct appeal was taken.Â   \r\nPetitioner filed an application for\r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) alleging he was\r\n  not advised of his right to a direct appeal.Â  At the PCR hearing, no testimony\r\n  was presented on this issue, and the State consented to allowing petitioner to\r\n  have a belated appeal.Â  The PCR judge granted petitioner a belated review of\r\n  his direct appeal issues, finding the uncontroverted evidence showed petitioner\r\n  was not advised of his right to appeal.Â  Petitioner now seeks a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s order and has filed a brief addressing his\r\n  direct appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208\r\n  S.E.2d 35 (1974).\r\nâ€œ[A]bsent\r\n  extraordinary circumstances, there is no constitutional requirement that a\r\n  defendant be informed of a right to a direct appeal from a guilty plea.â€Â  Weathers\r\n    v. State, 319 S.C. 59, 459 S.E.2d 838 (1995).Â  Counsel has a duty to advise\r\n  a defendant about an appeal when there is reason to think either: (1) a\r\n  rational defendant would want to appeal; or (2) this particular defendant\r\n  reasonably demonstrated that he was interested in appealing.Â  Roe v.\r\n    Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470, 120 S.Ct. 1029, 145 L.Ed.2d 985 (2000).Â  In\r\n  determining whether a rational defendant would have desired an appeal, â€œthe\r\n  court must consider such factors as whether the defendant received the sentence\r\n  bargained for as a part of the plea and whether the plea expressly reserved or\r\n  waived some or all appeal rights.â€Â  Flores-Ortega, supra.Â  \r\n \r\nWe\r\n  find petitioner failed to show he was entitled to be advised of his right to a\r\n  direct appeal.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000).Â  No\r\n  objections were made at petitionerâ€™s guilty plea hearing, petitioner received the\r\n  recommended sentence, and there was no evidence presented at the PCR hearing\r\n  that petitioner inquired about an appeal.Â  Flores-Ortega, supra; Weathers, supra.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judgeâ€™s order granting petitioner a belated\r\n  appeal is  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-018","title":"Northrop v.
