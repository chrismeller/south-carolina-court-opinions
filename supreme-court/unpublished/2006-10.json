Pleasant, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner has filed a petition asking this Court to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Babb v. Est. of Watson, et al., S.C. Ct. App. Orders dated November 4, 2004, and May 24, 2005.Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, reverse the Court of Appeals, and remand to proceed with the appeal.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn the underlying action, petitioner alleged civil conspiracy, unjust enrichment, negligence and gross negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and fraud, constructive fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation by respondents.Â  In their answer, respondents sought a declaratory judgment by way of counterclaim that petitioner was not a shareholder in Little River Campground, Inc. (hereinafter LRCG, Inc.), and should be barred from claiming any ownership interest in LRCG, Inc.Â  In a bifurcated trial, the trial judge determined petitioner had voluntarily and intentionally relinquished her interest in LRCG, Inc. Â Petitioner filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion for the trial judge to alter or amend his order.Â  The trial judge denied petitionerâ€™s motion.\r\nPetitioner appealed the trial judgeâ€™s order to the Court of Appeals.Â  Respondents moved to dismiss the appeal as interlocutory.Â  The Court of Appeals granted the dismissal, stating that a fundamental rule of appellate procedure is that a judgment or order must be final before it can be appealed.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in dismissing petitionerâ€™s appeal as\r\ninterlocutory?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing her appeal as interlocutory.Â  Specifically, petitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in dismissing her appeal because the trial judgeâ€™s order determining that she was not a shareholder in LRCG, Inc. was a final order involving the merits.\r\nAn order generally must fall into one of several categories set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330 (1976) in order to be immediately appealable.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 607 S.E.2d 707 (2005).Â  These categories include:\r\n\r\n(1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from;\r\n(2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any actionâ€¦. \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330.Â  This Court has defined â€œinvolving the meritsâ€ as a ruling which finally determines some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.Â  Jefferson by Johnson v. Geneâ€™s Used Cars, Inc., 295 S.C. 317, 368 S.E.2d 456 (1988).Â  An order may be appealable because it has the effect of striking out a pleading.Â  Link v. Sch. Dist. of Pickens County, 302 S.C.1, 393 S.E.2d 176 (1990). Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s appeal involved the merits of the underlying action.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s determination that petitioner had waived her interest in LRCG, Inc. had the effect of striking part of petitionerâ€™s pleadings.Â  Petitioner alleged breach of fiduciary duty by respondents.Â  The trial judgeâ€™s order had the effect of declaring that a fiduciary relationship could not exist between petitioner and respondents as minority and controlling shareholders, respectively, because the judgeâ€™s order declared petitioner was not a shareholder.Â  Therefore, the effect of the trial judgeâ€™s order was to strike petitionerâ€™s cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty.Â  \r\nAdditionally, petitioner had alleged in her complaint civil\r\nconspiracy occurred within the relationship of shareholders, unjust enrichment occurred because respondents failed to honor the commitment to purchase property for the benefit of shareholders, respondents acted negligently and grossly negligent in intentionally and voluntarily choosing to ignore their duties and responsibilities to LRCG, Inc., and respondents were guilty of fraud, deceit, and misrepresentation because respondents represented to petitioner that they would act as exclusive agents for shareholders and actively seek property to be purchased by and for the benefit of all shareholders.Â  By declaring petitionerâ€™s status as a non-shareholder of LRCG, Inc., the trial judge effectively struck petitionerâ€™s entire complaint against respondents.Â \r\nFurther, the Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act states that declaratory judgments have the force and effect of a final judgment or decree.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§15-53-20.Â  Appeal may be taken from any final judgment or appealable order.Â  Rule 72,\r\nSCRCP. \r\nTherefore, we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ dismissal of the appeal as interlocutory and remand to proceed with the appeal. \r\n REVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-031","title":"Wright v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Paula S. Magargle, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner pled guilty to murder and was sentenced to life imprisonment.Â  No direct appeal was taken.\r\nFollowing an evidentiary hearing on petitionerâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR), the PCR judge granted petitioner a belated review of his direct appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  Petitioner now seeks a writ of certiorari from that order.Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the order of the PCR judge.\r\nThe PCR judge found petitioner did not knowingly and voluntarily waive his right to a direct appeal because he was not advised of that right.Â  Although the judge found that extraordinary circumstances required counsel to discuss the right to a direct appeal with petitioner, the extraordinary circumstances were not set forth in the order, and there was no finding that petitioner requested an appeal or that he had non-frivolous grounds for an appeal.\r\nÂ See Roe v. Flores-Ortega, 528 U.S. 470 (2000); Weathers v. State, 319 S.C. 59, 459 S.E.2d 838 (1995).Â  Therefore, the PCR judge erred in granting petitioner a White v. State review of his guilty plea.Â  Accordingly, the order is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
