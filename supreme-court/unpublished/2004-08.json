Elliott, Jr., Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion No. 2004-MO-042\r\n  Submitted May 13, 2004 - Filed August 2, 2004\r\n\r\nDISMISSEDÂ Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n      \r\n        Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, \r\n          for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Thomas E. Elliott, Jr., of Columbia, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This disciplinary action arises from respondent \r\n  Thomas Elliottâ€™s representation of Mary Brown (Brown) in a case recently reviewed \r\n  on certiorari by this Court: Brown v. Zamias, Op. No. 2002-UP-715 (S.C. \r\n  Ct. App. filed November 15, 2002), certiorari dismissed as improvidently \r\n  granted, Op. No. 2004-MO-10 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 5, 2004).Â  The case \r\n  was a negligence action brought by Brown after she tripped and fell across an \r\n  extension cord on the floor of a Rock Hill mall.Â  \r\nIn this disciplinary matter, Brown alleges that \r\n  respondent failed to depose two potential deponents and conditioned his taking \r\n  of the depositions upon her prepaying the deposition costs.Â  The Subpanel for \r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Subpanel) found that respondent did not commit \r\n  lawyer misconduct but recommended the issuance of a letter of caution.Â  We find \r\n  that the charges against respondent should be dismissed.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background \r\nBrown was injured when she tripped over an extension cord at a Rock Hill Mall \r\n  on Christmas Eve 1997.Â  Moments before Brown tripped, the Matthews, a couple \r\n  from Winston-Salem, had just walked over the cord, and Mrs. Matthews nearly \r\n  tripped over the cord.Â  Because they were only a few yards away, the Matthews \r\n  heard Brown fall, returned to where she had fallen, and told her that they would \r\n  be happy to provide testimony of the unsafe condition that the power cord had \r\n  created.\r\nBrown hired respondent to represent her in a negligence action against the \r\n  mall.Â  She signed a retainer agreement, which established a 33.3% contingency \r\n  fee for respondent and provided:\r\n\r\n  If, however, suit shall be required to obtain recovery, the client agrees \r\n    to pay litigation costs to initiate this action in the amount of N/A.\r\n\r\nOn August 22, 2000, the Matthews sent letters to \r\n  respondent describing the events of Christmas Eve 1997 and expressing their \r\n  willingness to further assist Brown in her attempt to receive â€œthe compensation \r\n  she deserves.â€Â  On August 28, 2000, in a letter to Brown, respondent wrote: \r\n  â€œI anticipate that I should try to make plans to go to Winston-Salem to take \r\n  [the Matthewsâ€™] depositions for presentation at court.Â  Obviously, it would \r\n  be an extreme inconvenience for them to travel to York County on short notice \r\n  to testify.â€Â  \r\nDuring the course of respondentâ€™s preparation of \r\n  Brownâ€™s pending litigation, he incurred significant discovery expenses, including \r\n  those incurred from taking a video deposition of Brownâ€™s doctors in Columbia.Â  \r\n  On various occasions, respondent asked Brown to pay for these pre-litigation \r\n  costs, and Brown either was unable to pay or refused to pay for these expenses.\r\nRespondent told Brown that in order for him to travel to Winston-Salem to take \r\n  the Matthewsâ€™ depositions, Brown would have to pay the deposition expenses in \r\n  advance.Â  Brown did not prepay those discovery costs, and therefore respondent \r\n  did not take the depositions.Â  \r\nAfter the Commissionâ€™s investigation into respondentâ€™s potential misconduct \r\n  began, respondent stated to the investigating attorney (ATA) that the primary \r\n  issue in dispute in Brownsâ€™s case was damages, as there was a question of whether \r\n  Brownâ€™s prior orthopedic problems contributed to the medical expenses she incurred \r\n  from falling on the mall floor.Â  Thus, in respondentâ€™s view, the Matthewsâ€™ testimony \r\n  -- that the cord was on the floor of the mall right before Brownâ€™s injury -- \r\n  would not have shed any light on the damages issue.\r\nBrown also complained of (1) respondentâ€™s failure to keep her informed about \r\n  her case and (2) the abrupt nature in which respondent whisked her to the trial.Â  \r\n  The case moved up the York County roster such that Brown did not find out when \r\n  her case was going to trial until the morning of her trial.Â  Respondent prepared \r\n  Brown for trial on the way from Columbia to Rock Hill, and the trial proceeded \r\n  that afternoon.Â  Brown prevailed, and, after the trial judge denied the mallâ€™s \r\n  motion for a directed verdict, the jury awarded $43,000 in damages but apportioned \r\n  fault 50%-50% between Brown and the mall.\r\nThe mall appealed, and the court of appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\n  The court of appeals found that as an invitee, Brown was owed only the duty \r\n  to be warned of a latent hazard.Â  And since Brown testified that â€œshe immediately \r\n  saw the cord and cover when she looked back after fallingâ€ and that â€œhad she \r\n  been looking down or watching where she was walking she would have seen the \r\n  cover and been able to avoid tripping,â€ the court ruled that the cord was an \r\n  open and obvious hazard, and thus no duty was breached.Â  Zamias, Op. \r\n  No. 2002-UP-715 at 3-5.Â Â  \r\nAfter reviewing respondentâ€™s conduct in Brownâ€™s case, namely (1) respondentâ€™s \r\n  failure to depose the Matthews and demand that Brown pay for the depositions \r\n  in advance and (2) respondentâ€™s alleged mischaracterization to the ATA that \r\n  the primary issue in Brownâ€™s case was damages, [1]  the Subpanel determined that respondent did \r\n  not violate any Rules of Professional Conduct but determined that his \r\n  conduct warranted a letter of caution.Â  The full Panel of the Commission on \r\n  Lawyer Conduct adopted this finding.Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe Subpanel found that respondent did not violate Rules 1.1 (competent representation), \r\n  1.3 (diligence and promptness), and 1.4 (keeping the client reasonably informed) \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, 407, SCACR, for failing to depose \r\n  the Matthews because their testimony was not determinative on the issue of Brownâ€™s \r\n  damages or the issue of whether the mall was on notice of the hazardous condition.Â  \r\n  We agree with the Subpanel and find that the Matthewsâ€™ depositions were not \r\n  essential to Brownâ€™s case. \r\nThe Subpanel also found that respondent did not violate Rules 1.4 (keeping \r\n  the client reasonably informed) and 1.5 (charging reasonable fees) by demanding \r\n  that Brown prepay the deposition expenses.Â  The contingency fee agreement that \r\n  Brown signed contained an ambiguous provision concerning litigation fees that \r\n  stated that the amount Brown may have to pay in litigation costs was â€œN/A.â€Â  \r\n  This ambiguous provision could have led Brown to conclude -- as she did -- that \r\n  she need not pay any pre-trial expenses.Â  \r\nSince the inquiry into respondentâ€™s potential misconduct \r\n  began, respondent has omitted this provision from his standard retainer agreement.Â  \r\n  We hold that respondentâ€™s decision to remove the litigation cost provision from \r\n  his retainer agreement represents the appropriate corrective action in this \r\n  matter.\r\nConclusion\r\nUpon full review of the record in this matter, we find that the charges against \r\n  respondent should be DISMISSED.\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n

Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-375 (c).Â  Respondent was found guilty of conspiracy of possession with \r\n  intent to distribute crack cocaine, and was sentenced to twenty-one years imprisonment \r\n  and a fine of $20,000.Â  Respondent appealed his conviction, which was affirmed \r\n  by the Court of Appeals.Â  State v. Gordon, Op. No. 99-UP-507 (S.C. Ct. \r\n  App. filed September 8, 1999).Â  \r\nRespondent filed an application for \r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR), and moved for summary judgment on the grounds \r\n  that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over his conviction.Â  \r\n  The PCR judge granted respondentâ€™s motion.Â  The State filed a petition for writ \r\n  of certiorari, which was granted.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the trial court have subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction to convict respondent of a violation of Â§ 44-53-375(b) as \r\n  a lesser-included offense of Â§ 44-53-375(c)?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn April 1997, respondent was indicted, \r\n  along with several others, for conspiracy to traffic in crack cocaine.Â  At a \r\n  subsequent proceeding, the State, on respondentâ€™s motion, was ordered to amend \r\n  the indictment to include more specificity with regard to the charge.Â  The amended \r\n  indictment, charging respondent with trafficking in crack cocaine in violation \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(c), was true billed by the Grand Jury in May 1997. \r\n  Respondent was tried only on count one of the amended multi-count indictment.Â  \r\n  This count read:\r\nCOUNT ONE\r\n  TRAFFICKING IN CRACK COCAINE\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Section 44-53-375(c)\r\n\r\n  That WILLIE E. GORDON, AKA â€œJRâ€, \r\n    SPENCER GORDON, RENEE LEACH, HARRY BARNETTE, CALVIN BARNETTE, ROSIE D. JONES, \r\n    AKA â€œPOM-POMâ€, TOMMY JAMES RHINEHART, FNU LNU, AKA â€œTâ€, JUAN REID, and other \r\n    persons both known and unknown to the Grand Jury, did Traffick [sic] in Crack \r\n    Cocaine in York County, from on or about May of 1995 until the date of this \r\n    indictment, by either knowingly conspiring to sell, or deliver, or \r\n    purchase, or bring into this State, or provide financial assistance or did \r\n    otherwise aid, abet, or attempt to sell, or deliver, or purchase, or bring \r\n    into this State four hundred grams or more of crack cocaine, a Schedule II \r\n    controlled substance under provisions of Section 44-53-110, et seq., \r\n    Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976), as amended, such conduct not having \r\n    been authorized by law and is a violation of Section 44-53-375(c)- Trafficking \r\n    in Crack Cocaine. (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury was charged that conspiring \r\n  to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute was a lesser-included offense \r\n  of trafficking in crack cocaine. Respondent was found guilty of conspiring to \r\n  possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, respondent moved \r\n  for summary judgment on the grounds that conspiring to possess with intent to \r\n  distribute crack cocaine is not a lesser-included offense of trafficking in \r\n  crack cocaine.Â  The PCR judge granted the motion stating, â€œit has long been \r\n  established that conspiracy is not a lesser-included offense of [the] substantive \r\n  offense which is the object of the conspiracy.â€ \r\nGenerally, conspiracy is not a lesser-included \r\n  offense of a substantive offense.Â  State v. Ferguson, 221 S.C. 300, 70 \r\n  S.E.2d 355 (1952); State v. Greuling, 257 S.C. 515, 186 S.E.2d 706 (1972); \r\n  State v. Steadman, 257 S.C. 528, 186 S.E.2d 712 (1972).Â  South Carolina \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375 (c) (2002), which the indictment tracks, states â€œA person \r\n  who knowinglyâ€¦conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, purchase or bring \r\n  into this Stateâ€¦ten grams or more ofâ€¦crack cocaineâ€¦is guilty of a felony which \r\n  is known as â€˜trafficking in ice, crank, or crack cocaine.â€™â€ (emphasis supplied). \r\n  As defined in this section, there is no distinction between conspiracy \r\n  to traffic and the substantive offense of trafficking in crack cocaine; \r\n  in other words, the statute incorporates conspiracy as one of a number of ways \r\n  the substantive offense may be committed.Â  See i.e. Harris \r\n  v. State, 349 S.C. 46, 562 S.E.2d 311 (2002) (holding that under Section \r\n  44-53-370 (e) the legislature clearly intended that conspiracy to traffic be \r\n  treated as trafficking).Â  One of the ways respondent was alleged to have trafficked \r\n  in crack cocaine was by conspiring to â€œsell, manufacture, deliver, purchase, \r\n  or bring into this Stateâ€¦â€ as permitted under the general statute of trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370 (2002).Â  Conspiracy to traffic \r\n  in crack cocaine is encompassed in the indictment under which respondent was \r\n  charged, as one way to traffic in crack cocaine.\r\nAn indictment confers jurisdiction \r\n  upon the circuit court and gives the defendant notice of the charges against \r\n  him.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-19-20 (1985); see State v. Owens, 293 \r\n  S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987).Â  The â€œcircuit court does not have subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to convict a defendant of an offense unless there is an indictment \r\n  which sufficiently states the offense, the defendant waives presentment, or \r\n  the offense is a lesser included offense of the crime charged in the indictment.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 579, 564 S.E.2d 103, 105 (2002). Possession \r\n  with intent to distribute crack cocaine is a lesser-included offense of trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine.Â  Matthews v. State, 300 S.C. 238, 387 S.E.2d 258 (1990).Â  \r\n  Therefore, conspiring to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute is \r\n  a lesser-included offense of conspiracy to traffic in crack cocaine.Â  See \r\n  e.g. State v. Gosnell, 341 S.C. 627, 535 S.E.2d 453 (Ct. App. \r\n  2000)(holding that conspiracy to traffic cocaine in the amount of 400 grams \r\n  or more can include conspiracy to traffic lesser amounts.) \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE the PCR court, \r\n  as the circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to convict respondent of \r\n  conspiring to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of conspiring to traffic in crack cocaine, for which respondent was \r\n  indicted.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J., concur.Â  \r\n  WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.Â  BURNETT, J., not participating.\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.Â  In my opinion, conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute \r\n  crack cocaine is not a lesser-included offense of trafficking crack cocaine.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, there having been no indictment for conspiracy to PWID crack, the \r\n  trial court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to convict Gordon of this \r\n  offense; I would affirm the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief.Â  \r\nIn a criminal case, the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  subject matter jurisdiction is limited to those crimes charged in the indictment \r\n  and all lesser-included offenses.Â  State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 \r\n  S.E.2d 336 (2002).Â  An offense is a lesser-included offense of another if â€œthe \r\n  greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of the lesser offense.â€Â  \r\n  State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, ___, 589 S.E.2d 6, 8 (2003), citing \r\n  State v. Elliott, 346 S.C. 603, 606, 552 S.E.2d 727, 728 (2001).Â  A lesser \r\n  offense is included in the greater only if each of its elements is always \r\n  a necessary element of the greater offense.Â  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. \r\n  81, 530 S.E.2d 887 (2000); State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  617 (1997).Â  See also 42 C.J.S. Indictments and Informations Â§ \r\n  218 (1991)(an offense can be considered as lesser-included if, and only if, \r\n  all essential elements of the lesser offense are included among essential elements \r\n  of greater offense).Â  If, under any circumstances, a person can commit the greater \r\n  offense without being guilty of the purported lesser offense, then the latter \r\n  is not a lesser-included offense.Â Â  State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153, 553 \r\n  S.E.2d 464 (Ct. App. 2001), cert. dismissed as improv. granted 353 S.C. \r\n  538, 579 S.E.2d 318 (2003).Â Â  \r\nHere, it is patent that conspiracy \r\n  is not an essential element of the greater offense of trafficking.Â  Although \r\n  conspiracy is one method by which trafficking may be achieved, it is not always \r\n  a necessary element of trafficking; there are numerous ways listed in the statute \r\n  via which a person may commit that offense (e.g. sell, manufacture, deliver, \r\n  purchase, bring into this state, provide financial assistance, or otherwise \r\n  aid or abet).Â  See State v. Easler (although felony DUI and ABHAN \r\n  may both involve element of â€œserious bodily injury,â€ there are other circumstances \r\n  which may give rise to ABHAN such that serious bodily injury is not a necessary \r\n  element of ABHAN; therefore, ABHAN is not a lesser-included offense of felony \r\n  DUI).Â  \r\nI am not unmindful that this Court \r\n  has, on occasion, found an offense to be lesser-included notwithstanding a lack \r\n  of strict adherence to the elements test.Â  See State v. Elliott, \r\n  346 S.C. 603, 606, 552 S.E.2d 727, 728 (2001).Â Â  However, we have done so only \r\n  where, as in Elliott, the offense has traditionally been considered a \r\n  lesser-included offense of the greater offense charged.\r\nHere, the majority recognizes that \r\n  conspiracy is not generally a lesser-included offense of a substantive offense, \r\n  nor has it traditionally been so considered.Â  As noted by Justice Toal in her \r\n  concurrence in State v. Wilson, 311 S.C. 382, 391, 429 S.E.2d 453, 458 \r\n  (1993), conspiracy â€œis a completely separate offense from the substantive \r\n  offenses which are the objects of the conspiracy.â€Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\n  The majority correctly notes that possession with intent to distribute crack \r\n  cocaine is a lesser-included offense of trafficking.Â  Matthews v. State, \r\n  300 S.C. 238, 387 S.E.2d 258 (1990).Â  However, that PWID crack is a lesser-included \r\n  offense of trafficking is of no consequence.Â  The inquiry here is whether conspiracy \r\n  is a lesser-included offense of trafficking.Â  In my opinion, as demonstrated \r\n  above, it is not.\r\nAccordingly, in my opinion, the trial \r\n  court was without subject-matter jurisdiction to convict Gordon of conspiracy \r\n  to possess with intent to distribute crack.Â  I would affirm the PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  grant of relief.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2004-MO-045","title":"Branham v.

Brourton, IV, of Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, LLC, of Charleston, for \r\n          Interested Party (Karen Hollinshead-Brown).\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner seeks \r\n  a writ of certiorari from the State Democratic Party Executive Committeeâ€™s (State \r\n  Committee) reversal of the Charleston County Democratic Party Executive Committeeâ€™s \r\n  (County Committee) decision to hold a new primary election for the Charleston \r\n  Council District 4 seat (council seat).Â  We reverse and reinstate the decision \r\n  of the County Committee.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThe Democratic Primary Election was \r\n  held on June 8, 2004.Â  Four candidates ran for the council seat: Edith Askins, \r\n  Henry Darby, Karen Hollinshead-Brown, and petitioner.Â  \r\nFollowing a recertified vote, the \r\n  results of the race were as follows:Â  Darby, 401 votes; Hollinshead-Brown, 334 \r\n  votes; petitioner, 332 votes; and Askins, 226 votes.Â  Pursuant to statute, a \r\n  run off between the two candidates receiving the most votes was required.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-50 (Supp. 2003).Â  \r\nOn \r\n  Monday, June 14, petitioner filed a protest of the election results with the \r\n  County Committee based on gross voting irregularities at the Bayside Manor precinct.Â  \r\n  The County Committee had a meeting previously scheduled for Wednesday, June \r\n  16.Â  Accordingly, the County Committee scheduled petitionerâ€™s protest hearing \r\n  for the same day.Â  The other candidates were notified that petitioner filed \r\n  a protest to the election results and that a meeting on the matter would take \r\n  place on Wednesday, June 16 at 7:00 p.m.Â  All of the candidates were present \r\n  except Darby.Â  Following the protest hearing, the County Committee voted unanimously \r\n  to hold a new election for the council seat.Â  \r\nOn \r\n  Friday, June 18, Darby filed a Notice of Appeal with the State Committee arguing \r\n  that the County Committeeâ€™s decision to hold a new election should be reversed.Â  \r\n  By a 23-1 vote, the decision of the County Committee was reversed because the \r\n  hearing was held in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-17-530 (Supp. 2003).\r\nISSUE \r\n\r\nDid the State Committee \r\n  err in reversing the decision of the County Committee to hold a new election?\r\nANALYSIS \r\n\r\nIt \r\n  is well established that an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the lower \r\n  tribunal in order for that issue to be preserved for appellate review.Â  Tupper \r\n  v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).\r\nIt is uncontested that Darby received \r\n  notice that a protest to the election results was filed as well as notice of \r\n  the time and place the County Committee would convene a hearing on the matter.Â  \r\n  Darby had ample opportunity to attend the protest hearing to raise any challenges \r\n  or objections to the proceeding.Â  See Jenkins v. McCarey, 222 \r\n  S.C. 426, 73 S.E.2d 446 (1952) (candidate entered special appearance before \r\n  county election committee to challenge jurisdiction of the committee for lack \r\n  of notice).Â  By electing not to attend the protest hearing, Darby waived his \r\n  right to challenge the proceeding on appeal.Â  Accordingly, Darbyâ€™s appeal was \r\n  not properly before the State Committee and should have been dismissed.\r\nMoreover, the State Committee erred \r\n  in finding that the decision to hold a new election was void as a result of \r\n  the protest hearing being held a day prior to the time prescribed by Section \r\n  7-17-530.\r\nIn George v. Mun. Election Commâ€™n \r\n  of City of Charleston, 335 S.C. 182, 516 S.E.2d 206 (1999), this Court found \r\n  that the statutory provisions regulating the conduct of elections are numerous \r\n  and detailed and that perfect compliance in every instance is unlikely.Â  To \r\n  that end, courts have developed principles to determine whether such provisions \r\n  are mandatory or directory.Â  Id.\r\nAs a general rule, provisions are \r\n  mandatory in two instances: when the statute expressly declares that a particular \r\n  act is essential to the validity of an election, or when enforcement is sought \r\n  before an election in a direct proceeding.Â  Id.Â  However, after an election \r\n  in which no fraud is alleged or proven, â€œwhen the Court seeks to uphold the \r\n  result in order to avoid disenfranchising those who voted, such provisions \r\n  are merely directory even though the Legislature used seemingly mandatory terms \r\n  such as â€˜shallâ€™ or â€˜mustâ€™ in establishing the provisions.â€Â  Id. (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nThere was substantial evidence presented \r\n  to the County Committee that gross voting irregularities took place at the Bayside \r\n  Manor precinct.Â  Affirming the State Committeeâ€™s decision would, in effect, \r\n  disenfranchise those voters in the Bayside Manor precinct from voting for their \r\n  District Four representative.Â  This Court finds the rationale in George \r\n  persuasive and finds that Section 7-17-530 is merely directory.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  we reverse the State Committeeâ€™s decision and reinstate the County Committeeâ€™s \r\n  decision to hold a new council seat election.\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.
