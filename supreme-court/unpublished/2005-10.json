Smalls, 354 S.C. 498, 381 S.E.2d 850 (Ct. App. 2003), in finding that there was no subject matter jurisdiction because respondent waived presentment on a sentencing sheet and the lewd act charge was not a lesser included offense of the indicted charge of first degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor.Â  However, this Court has reversed the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Smalls, holding that a defendant may waive presentment by signing a sentencing sheet that indicates the crime charged without the necessity of preparing another indictment for the charge to which the defendant pled guilty.Â \r\nState v. Smalls, 364 S.C. 343, 613 S.E.2d 754 (2005).\r\nFurther, no objection was made to the waiver of presentment at trial.Â  In State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), this Court held that subject matter jurisdiction refers to the power of the court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings belong.Â  Accordingly, a defective indictment procedure does not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Because the PCR judge erred in finding that the lack of a new indictment deprived the circuit court of subject matter jurisdiction, we reverse the decision of the PCR judge.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-051","title":"Tony Aiken v.

Coffey, of Greer, pro se.\r\nKimberly Fisher Dunham, of Greenville, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner has filed a petition asking this Court to review the Court of Appeals decision in Dunham v. Coffey, 2004-UP-344 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 25, 2004).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and affirm in result the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis action was initially filed by Lisa Webb, petitionerâ€™s ex-wife, seeking modification of custody, visitation, and child support, as well as unrecovered medical expenses, and attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Respondent represented petitionerâ€™s ex-wife in this action and petitioner proceeded pro se.Â  Respondent requested a final hearing on May 26, 1998, and the hearing was set for April 16, 1999.Â  Respondent received notice of the hearing date from the clerk on February 26, 1999, but did not mail notice of this hearing to petitioner until April 13, 1999, three days prior to the hearing.Â  She mailed this notice by certified mail, return-receipt requested, to petitionerâ€™s last known address.Â  However, petitioner no longer resided at that location.Â  The notice was forwarded to petitionerâ€™s new address and he received it the day after the hearing.Â  Because petitioner received the notice after the hearing was held, he was not present at the hearing.Â  The family court entered its final order on May 27, 1999, ordering petitioner to pay $3,531.05 in attorneyâ€™s fees to respondent within 60 days.Â  \r\nHowever, petitioner did not pay the attorneyâ€™s fees, so respondent served him with a Rule to Show Cause.Â  On October 11, 2002, petitioner responded by bringing a motion for relief, and a hearing was held on this motion on October 22, 2002.Â  Petitioner was represented by counsel at this hearing, but it appears he proceeded pro se in every other stage of this litigation.Â  \r\nThe family court judge denied petitionerâ€™s motion, finding it was his responsibility to provide his address on his Answer and also to keep the clerk apprised of any new address so that he could be sent notices relating to his case.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, finding petitionerâ€™s own negligence in failing to comply with Rule 11(a) and state his address on his Answer made it impossible for the clerk to notify him of the final hearing.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in denying petitionerâ€™s motion for relief from the order?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner contends the fact he omitted his address from his Answer in contravention of Rule 11(a) is of no consequence because it was respondentâ€™s duty to timely notify him of the hearing date and not the responsibility of the clerk.Â  He further argues that because respondent failed to fulfill this duty, he did not receive proper notice of the hearing, denying him his constitutional right to be heard and rendering the order void.\r\nThe Court of Appeals appears to have based its analysis on Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, which allows for relief from judgment based on â€œmistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglectâ€ and which must be brought within a year of the date of entry of the order.[1]Â  According to both the family court and the Court of Appeals, petitionerâ€™s mistake of omitting his address from his Answer made it impossible for the clerk to mail him notice of the hearing.Â  Petitionerâ€™s motion was denied because he sought relief based on this mistake more than a year after judgment was entered.\r\nRelief from judgment or order under Rule 60, SCRCP, rests within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the trial courtâ€™s findings will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 382 S.E.2d 900 (1989).Â  Motions made pursuant to Rule 60(b)(1)-(3), SCRCP, must be made within a reasonable time not to exceed one year after entry of the order.Â  Coleman v. Dunlap, 306 S.C. 491, 413 S.E.2d 15 (1992).Â  However, motions for relief grounded in Rule 60(b)(4) and (5), SCRCP, are not subject to this absolute one-year limitation, but may be brought within a reasonable time after the order is entered.Â  In other words, â€˜[t]he one year limit is a non-discretionary mandate whereas the â€˜reasonable timeâ€™ limitation is discretionary and should be determined under the facts and circumstances of each case.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nHere, the family court entered its final order on May 27, 1999, and petitioner did not move for relief from the order until October 11, 2002, well over one year after entry of the order.Â  Therefore, none of the first three grounds for relief from judgment are available to petitioner and, to have any possibility of success, the motion must be based on subparts (4) or (5).Â  Rule 60(b), SCRCP. \r\nRule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, allows relief from an order to be granted on the grounds that the order is void.Â  A void order is one rendered in the absence of proper due process or jurisdiction.Â  Universal Benefits, Inc. v. McKinney, 349 S.C. 179, 561 S.E.2d 659 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  â€œAn elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendencyÂ Â  Â of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.â€Â  Mullane v. Central Hanover Bank &amp; Trust Co., 339 U.S. 306, 70 S.Ct. 652 (1950).Â  Such notice must give the parties a reasonable time to make their appearance and â€œ[t]he means employed must be such as one desirous of actually informing the absentee might reasonably adopt to accomplish it.â€Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in applying Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, and in failing to address petitionerâ€™s contention that because the order is void based on lack of proper notice of the hearing, relief must be granted pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â  In its analysis, the Court of Appeals focuses on petitionerâ€™s failure to comply with Rule 11(a) and blames his lack of notice solely on this failure.Â  Both the family court judge and the Court of Appeals focus on the fact that Rule 17(a), SCRFC, only requires opposing counsel to give notice of the merits hearing to a defaulting defendant.Â  Both courts erroneously interpret Rule 17(a), SCRFC, to mean that because petitioner filed an Answer in the underlying action, respondent was not required to send him any notice of the hearing at all, and her three days notice was merely a courtesy to petitioner.Â  This misinterpretation ignores the fact that the Rules of Civil Procedure apply in family court proceedings to the extent that they are consistent with the Rules of Family Court.Â  Because Rule 17(a), SCRFC, was inapplicable to petitioner as a non-defaulting defendant, the Rules of Civil Procedure step in to provide rules pertaining to service of notices on non-defaulting defendants.[2]Â  \r\nThus, the family court and Court of Appeals should have considered that Rule 5, SCRCP, places a burden on the party requesting the hearing of sending notice of the hearing to the opposing party.Â  Rule 5(a), SCRCP, provides â€œevery written notice . . . shall be served upon each of the parties. . . .â€Â  Rule 5(b)(1), SCRCP, further provides â€œ[s]ervice upon the attorney or upon a party shall be made by delivering a copy to him or by mailing it to him at his last known address or, if no address is known, by leaving it with the clerk of court.â€Â  In fact, the form sent to the requesting party, informing him of the hearing date in the family court, echoes the responsibility imposed by the rules and explicitly informs the requesting party of this duty by stating:\r\n\r\nNOTICE TO ATTORNEY OR PARTY REQUESTING HEARING:Â  Unless otherwise ordered by the court, you are required to notify opposing counsel (or parties, if unrepresented by counsel) . . . of this hearing.\r\n\r\nFamily Court Form SCCA 411, Notice of Hearing (General). \r\nTherefore, respondent did have a duty to notify petitioner of the merits hearing.Â  However, respondent fulfilled this duty by sending notice of the hearing to petitionerâ€™s last known address, and even though she did so only three days before the hearing, she fully complied with the Rules.Â  Such short notice, however, arguably did not comply with due process because it is questionable whether three days notice is reasonably calculated to apprise petitioner of the hearing and provide him with the opportunity to be heard.Â  As such, the Court of Appeals erred in applying Rule 60(b)(1), SCRCP, and focusing on petitionerâ€™s failure to state his address on his Answer.Â  Instead, the Court of Appeals should have considered whether the order against petitioner was void for lack of due process, warranting relief be granted pursuant to Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, petitionerâ€™s motion for relief from the order was properly denied regardless of whether Rule 60(b)(1) or (b)(4) is applied.Â  A motion for relief under Rule 60(b)(4), SCRCP, must be commenced within a reasonable time after the entry of the order.Â  Here, petitioner waited over three years before moving for relief even though he admitted he received the notice of the hearing the day after the hearing was held.Â  As such, petitioner had constructive notice that an order would be entered affecting his rights and should have promptly moved for relief rather than wait three years, an amount of time which was unreasonable under the circumstances.Â  We therefore affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals in result only. \r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The opinion of the Court of Appeals does not specifically state which subsection bars petitionerâ€™s motion, but rather only â€œit was Mr. Coffeyâ€™s own error in not providing the court with his address that caused him to fail to receive notice of the final hearing.Â  Therefore, Coffeyâ€™s motion for relief is barred by the one-year time limit under Rule 60(b), SCRCP.â€Â  Furthermore, the partiesâ€™ briefs to the Court of Appeals do not specify Rule 60(b)(1) applies, although respondent arguably alludes to that subsection in her brief.\r\n[2] Rule 2(a), SCRFC, makes applicable in family court certain of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, including Rule 5, SCRCP, except to the extent that Rule 5(a) does not require a defaulting defendant to be given notice of every hearing, as Rule 17(a), SCRFC, provides that all defendants must be notified of merits hearings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n

Thayer Rivers, Jr., of Ridgeland, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â This appeal involves a motion to enforce our opinion in Manes v. Thomas, Op. No. 97-MO-049 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 27, 1997).Â  The circuit court denied the motion, holding that Frederick R. Martin (Appellant) lacked standing and that the matter is moot.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant is one of many plaintiffs who brought an action against Rita and L.J. Thomas (Respondents), who had developed a subdivision and deeded parcels to the plaintiffs.Â  In the action, the plaintiffs sought to enforce certain restrictive covenants contained in the deeds.Â  They also sought money damages.\r\nThe trial court granted Respondentsâ€™ motion to require the plaintiffs to elect between remedies.Â  Appellant and his brother elected money damages.Â  All other plaintiffs elected enforcement of the covenants.Â  A jury awarded Appellant and his brother $20,000 each in damages.\r\nIn the equity portion of the proceedings, the trial court addressed the other plaintiffsâ€™ claims for enforcement of the restrictive covenants.Â  The covenant at issue here required Respondents to dedicate the streets and roads in the subdivision to the county for public use and maintenance.Â  The trial court ordered Respondents to bring the streets and roads up to standards and then turn them over to the county.Â  The trial court held, however, that Respondents were not required to first pave the roads, even though the countyâ€™s then existing policy would not allow it to accept unpaved roads.Â  According to the trial court, paving was not a prerequisite to acceptance by the county when Respondents promised to dedicate the streets, so Respondents could not be ordered to pave the roads.\r\nWe disagreed and held that Respondents were required to pave the roads.Â  We reasoned that it did not matter that paving was not a prerequisite to acceptance by the county when Respondents made their promise.Â  What mattered was that Respondents had promised to turn over the streets and roads.Â  Whatever county rules regarding acceptance were previously in force would not limit the plaintiffsâ€™ rights to enforce the covenant.\r\nAfter the remittitur was sent to the circuit court, Respondents brought an action for a declaratory judgment that they had complied with our 1997 opinion.Â  Apparently, they had actually dedicated the streets and roads in the subdivision prior to the issuance of the opinion.Â  They had successfully done so without paving the roads, despite the countyâ€™s purported policy that only paved roads would be accepted.Â  \r\nThe circuit court dismissed Respondentsâ€™ declaratory-judgment action, holding that there was no justiciable controversy.Â  We affirmed.Â  Thomas v. Martin, Op. No. 2000-MO-087 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 7, 2000).\r\nSoon thereafter, Appellant filed this motion to enforce the 1997 opinion.Â  Appellant argued that Respondents failed to comply with the opinion by failing to pave the streets and roads.Â  Respondents answered that they had fulfilled the restrictive covenant and our mandate by dedicating the streets and roads to the county.Â  Not only had they fulfilled their obligations, Respondents argued, but also they no longer had the power to pave the streets and roads because the streets and roads were now owned by the county.\r\nThe circuit court denied Appellantâ€™s motion, holding that the matter was moot because Respondents had in fact fulfilled the covenant by dedicating the streets and roads to the county.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the circuit court erred in denying Appellantâ€™s motion.Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nAs the circuit court held, this matter is moot.Â  â€œA case becomes moot when judgment, if rendered, will have no practical legal effect upon existing controversy.â€Â  Mathis v. S.C. State Hwy. Dept., 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973). Â The matter is moot because Respondents have complied with our 1997 opinion by fulfilling the covenant to dedicate the streets and roads. Â \r\nAppellant argues that our 1997 opinion required Respondents not only to dedicate the streets and roads, but also to pave them.Â  That is what the opinion required, but only because the parties had represented to us that the county would not accept the streets and roads unless they were paved.Â  The opinion mandated paving for the sole purpose of effecting the dedication.Â  As already mentioned, the county accepted the streets and roads despite their being unpaved.Â  Respondents therefore fulfilled the covenant, which is all that our opinion was intended to accomplish.Â  \r\nAppellant argues that the countyâ€™s acceptance was invalid because the proper procedures were not followed.Â  The county is not a party to this action, however, and the only evidence in the record is that the county owns and maintains control over the streets and roads.Â Â Â  \r\nThis matter is moot, and the decision of the circuit court is \r\nAFFIRMED.Â Â Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
