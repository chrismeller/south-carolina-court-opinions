State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988).Â  The motion to relieve\r\n  counsel was denied, and the Court ordered the parties to address whether the\r\n  circuit court erred in finding petitioner was not entitled to a belated review\r\n  of his direct appeal issue.\r\nSubsequently, the Court granted the petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari, dispensed with further briefing, and ordered the parties to brief\r\n  the direct appeal issue set forth in the petition for a writ of certiorari\r\n  pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974), and Rule\r\n  243(i)(2), SCACR. Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCounsel for petitioner has now filed a brief pursuant to Anders\r\n  v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967), and a petition to be relieved as\r\n  counsel.Â  Petitioner has filed a pro se response.Â  After a\r\n  thorough review of the issue set forth in the Anders brief, petitioner's pro se response, and the record, we find no issues of merit.Â \r\n  Accordingly, petitioner's conviction and sentence are affirmed and counsel's\r\n  motion to be relieved is granted.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2010-MO-024","title":"Neely v.
