Specifically, Stanley\r\nasserts the special referee erred in failing to properly interpret Section 15-61-25 of\r\nthe South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012), contending it affords him the right of first\r\nrefusal to purchase the parcel. He also argues the special referee's order is\r\ninequitable because it awards him a large sum of personal property without taking\r\ninto account the expense and inconvenience of moving and storing that chattel.\r\nWe affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\nHerron v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney\r\n        General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney\r\n        General Ashleigh Rayanna Wilson, of Columbia, for\r\n        Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: This matter is before the Court by way of a petition for a writ of\r\ncertiorari, filed pursuant to Johnson v. State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988),\r\nfrom an order of the circuit court denying petitioner's application for post-\r\nconviction relief (PCR), but finding petitioner is entitled to a belated review of his\r\ndirect appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).\r\nCounsel has also filed a motion to be relieved as counsel and a brief pursuant to\r\nWhite v. State. Petitioner has filed a pro se brief pursuant to White v. State.\r\n\r\nInitially, we find the filing of a Johnson petition in this matter, or in any matter in\r\nwhich the PCR judge has found the applicant is entitled to a belated review of his\r\ndirect appeal issues pursuant to White v. State, is improper. In Johnson, this Court\r\napproved the use of the procedure set forth in Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738\r\n(1967), in meritless PCR appeals. In Anders, the United States Supreme Court\r\ninstructed that the procedure set forth therein should be used only when counsel\r\nfinds the appeal to be \"wholly frivolous.\" Here, the appeal is neither meritless nor\r\nwholly frivolous because the PCR judge found petitioner is entitled to a belated\r\nreview of his direct appeal issues.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Rule 243(i)(1), SCACR, requires counsel to raise this issue to the Court\r\nwhen the PCR judge affirmatively finds an applicant is entitled to a belated review\r\nof his direct appeal issues. See also Davis v. State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60\r\n(1986). Here, counsel failed to include the question in the petition for a writ of\r\ncertiorari.\r\n\r\nHowever, because the Johnson procedure requires us to review the entire record\r\nfor issues of merit, we may reach the question of whether the PCR judge correctly\r\nconcluded petitioner is entitled to a belated review of his direct appeal issues.\r\n\r\nBecause there is sufficient evidence to support the PCR judge's finding that\r\npetitioner did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal, we\r\ndeny counsel's request to be relieved, dispense with the filing of a merits petition\r\nand brief addressing the issue, and proceed with a belated review of petitioner's\r\ndirect appeal issue pursuant to Davis. We deny the petition for a writ of certiorari\r\nas to the question raised in the Johnson petition.\r\n\r\nWe affirm petitioner's convictions and sentences pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1),\r\nSCACR, and the following authorities: Rule 804(b)(2), SCRE; State v. McHoney,\r\n344 S.C. 85, 544 S.E.2d 30 (2001) (holding the necessary state of mind by a\r\n\ndeclarant can be inferred from the facts and circumstances surrounding the\r\ndeclaration).\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2013-MO-026","title":"Rogers v.
