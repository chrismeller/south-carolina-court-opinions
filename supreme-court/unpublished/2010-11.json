State, 380 S.C. 215, 669 S.E.2d 594 (2008),[3] mandated the removal of the GPS monitoring. \r\nDuring\r\n  the hearing before the circuit court, the SCDPPPS conceded that Skelton should\r\n  not have been in the CSP at the time of the alleged violations given this Court's\r\n  decision in McGrier and the retroactive application established in Bennett.Â \r\n  Based on this concession, Skelton should have been released from any further\r\n  supervision by the SCDPPPS and, thus, should not have been subjected to GPS\r\n  monitoring.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's order pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  Bank of N.Y. v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Andrew James Harrelson, Jr.\r\n  (&quot;Harrelson&quot;) appeals the circuit court's sentence placing him on an\r\n  active electronic monitoring device following a guilty plea.Â Â  Harrelson\r\n  asserts the electronic monitoring provision found in Section 23-3-540 of South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) is unconstitutional because it violates the Eighth\r\n  Amendment prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment and disproportionate\r\n  sentencing.Â  Because Harrelson's plea was conditional, we decline to address\r\n  the issues raised, vacate the plea and remand for further proceedings.Â Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nHarrelson pled guilty to\r\n  committing a lewd act on a minor.Â  During the plea colloquy, the judge informed\r\n  Harrelson section 23-3-540 required he be placed on an electronic monitoring\r\n  device.Â  Harrelson's attorney made a constitutional objection before the guilty\r\n  plea was accepted. After accepting Harrelson's plea, the circuit court judge\r\n  sentenced him to be committed to the South Carolina Department of Corrections\r\n  Youthful Offender Division for an indeterminate term not to exceed six years,\r\n  plus the applicable costs and assessments. In addition, Harrelson, upon release\r\n  from imprisonment, was to wear an active electronic monitoring device and\r\n  ordered to adhere to the standard conditions for sex offender monitoring. Harrelson\r\n  reiterated his objection during the sentencing portion of the hearing, but the\r\n  court overruled the objection.Â  Â This appeal followed. \r\nISSUE\r\nHarrelson raises one issue on appeal:Â  Whether\r\n  the electronic monitoring provision under section 23-3-540 is unconstitutional\r\n  to the extent it violates the Eighth Amendment prohibition against cruel and\r\n  unusual punishment and disproportionate sentencing.Â  \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nGenerally, &quot;[i]n criminal\r\n  cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by the\r\n  factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Bryant, 372 S.C. 305, 312, 642 S.E.2d 582, 586 (2007).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nIt is axiomatic that\r\n  conditional pleas may not be accepted in South Carolina.Â  See In re Johnny\r\n    Lee W., 371 S.C. 217, 220, 638 S.E.2d 682, 684 (2006); see also State\r\n      v. Peppers, 346 S.C. 502, 504, 552 S.E.2d 288, 289 (2001) (court could not\r\n  accept guilty plea where appellant conditioned guilty plea upon right to appeal\r\n  constitutionality of indictment); State v. Truesdale, 278 S.C. 368, 370,\r\n  296 S.E.2d 528, 529 (1982) (conditional plea is a practice not recognized in South\r\n  Carolina and a practice of which this Court expressly disapproves). If â€œan\r\n  accused attempts to attach any condition or qualificationâ€ to a guilty plea,\r\n  then â€œthe trial court should direct a plea of not guilty.â€Â  Truesdale,\r\n  278 S.C. at 370, 296 S.E.2d at 529.Â  \r\nThe State contends that under State v. Easter, 355 S.C. 79, 584 S.E.2d 117 (2003), no conditional plea\r\n  resulted from this situation.Â Â  In Easter, the court held that\r\n  &quot;[s]entencing, although often combined with the admission of guilt in a\r\n  hearing, is a separate issue from guilt and a distinct phase of the criminal\r\n  process.Â  Therefore, when Easter entered his guilty plea but objected to his\r\n  sentence he did not enter an invalid, conditional guilty plea.&quot;Â  Id. at 81-82, 584 S.E.2d at 119.Â  We find Easterdistinguishable from the facts here.Â Â  In this case,\r\n  Harrelson's trial counsel made a constitutional objection before the guilty\r\n  plea was accepted by the circuit court.Â  Additionally, counsel reiterated that\r\n  objection during the sentencing portion. Â By objecting during the guilt portion\r\n  of the hearing as opposed to just during the sentencing phase, Harrelson's plea\r\n  became conditional.Â Â  \r\nBecause we find\r\n  Harrelson's plea was conditional, we decline to address his Eighth Amendment\r\n  challenges to section 23-3-540.Â  See\r\n    State v. Allen, 370 S.C. 88, 102, 634 S.E.2d 653, 660 (2006) (declining to\r\n  address remaining issues addressed by appellant when prior issue was\r\n  dispositive).Â Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reason indicated\r\n  above, we vacate Harrelson's guilty plea and remand for further proceedings.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2010-MO-031","title":"AAW Travel  LLC v.

Phillips, of Finkel\r\n          Law Firm, of Columbia, for Appellants.\r\n        BrianÂ  Dumas, of Peake, Fowler &amp; Associates, of\r\n          Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The appellants, AAW Travel Center, L.L.C.,\r\n  Alexis P. Kisteneff, Sr., and Elvira Kisteneff (&quot;Buyer&quot;) appeal from\r\n  a circuit court order holding them in contempt for failing to commence\r\n  arbitration proceedings against the respondents, Colony United Business\r\n  Brokers, Inc., Jack Mester, and David Blinder (&quot;Broker&quot;).Â  We reverse\r\n  the finding of contempt and remand the matter to the circuit court for entry of\r\n  an order of dismissal.\r\nI.\r\nThe initial dispute in this\r\n  case arose out of the purchase of a truck stop in Richland County.Â  The Buyer filed\r\n  a complaint alleging fraud and misrepresentation against the sellers, the\r\n  Broker, and others involved in the transaction.Â  The circuit court stayed the\r\n  action and ordered arbitration as to any claims against the Broker.Â  \r\nWhen the Buyer did not file\r\n  an application to commence arbitration proceedings, the Broker filed one with\r\n  the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) and listed the Buyer as\r\n  the claimant.Â  A disagreement subsequently arose as to who was the initiating\r\n  party responsible for paying the filing fee, and the application ultimately was\r\n  returned to the Broker by the arbitration organization because of the parties'\r\n  failure to pay the fee.Â  \r\nThe Broker then moved in the\r\n  circuit court to have the Buyer held in contempt, and it also sought dismissal\r\n  of the civil action for the Buyer's failure to arbitrate.Â  The circuit court\r\n  found the Buyer was in contempt of the prior arbitration order based on its\r\n  failure to commence arbitration proceedings and ordered the Buyer to file its\r\n  arbitration claim and pay the filing fee within sixty days or face dismissal of\r\n  its civil action.Â  The Buyer appeals from this order. \r\nII.\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  finding of contempt and hold dismissal of the civil action is the more\r\n  appropriate remedy in this case.Â  \r\nThe Buyer notified AAA, with\r\n  a copy to the Broker's counsel, that it would not be paying the required filing\r\n  fee because it was not the party seeking arbitration.Â  The letter stated in\r\n  pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n  We have\r\n    made no demand for arbitration and will not be paying for any arbitration.Â  Mr.\r\n    Dumas' clients [the Broker] desire to arbitrate, not my clients.Â  If he wants\r\n    to arbitrate, he can pay for it.Â  If he doesn't want to pay for it, we will\r\n    move before the Circuit Court of South Carolina to have the case restored to\r\n    the active docket and consider his demand for arbitration as waived.Â  \r\n\r\nAt oral argument before this\r\n  Court, the Buyer's counsel acknowledged that arbitration of its claims against\r\n  the Broker was required by the parties' agreements in this case, and that\r\n  arbitration was, therefore, appropriately ordered.Â  Since the circuit court had\r\n  already ordered arbitration, there was no legal basis by which the Buyer could\r\n  have asked the circuit court to &quot;restore&quot; the civil case to the\r\n  active docket and consider arbitration to be &quot;waived.&quot;Â  The circuit\r\n  court tried to provide the Buyer with additional time to comply with its order\r\n  compelling arbitration by holding the Buyer in contempt and then allowing it\r\n  additional time to commence arbitration as had been previously ordered.Â \r\n  However, we hold there is no clear and convincing evidence that the Buyer's\r\n  actions in failing to prosecute its claims against the Broker warranted a contempt\r\n  finding; rather, under the circumstances presented here, the more appropriate\r\n  result for the failure of the claims to proceed to arbitration as ordered is dismissal\r\n  of the Buyer's civil action against the Broker. Â \r\nIII.\r\nBased on the foregoing, we\r\n  reverse the circuit court's order and remand the matter to the circuit court\r\n  for entry of an order of dismissal of the civil action pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR and the following authorities:Â  Howsam v. Dean Witter Reynolds, Inc., 537 U.S. 79 (2002) (stating procedural questions\r\n  that grow out of a dispute and bear on its final disposition are presumptively\r\n  not for the judge, but for the arbitrator to decide); Durlach v. Durlach,\r\n  359 S.C. 64, 71, 596 S.E.2d 908, 912 (2004) (&quot;Civil contempt must be\r\n  proved by clear and convincing evidence.&quot;); Spartanburg County Dep't of\r\n    Soc. Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82-83, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988)\r\n  (observing willful disobedience of a court order may result in a finding of\r\n  contempt and stating &quot;[a] willful act is defined as one 'done voluntarily\r\n  and intentionally with the specific intent to do something the\r\n  law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail to do something the law\r\n  requires to be done; that is to say, with bad purpose either to disobey or\r\n  disregard the law'&quot; (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 1434 (5th ed.\r\n  1979)); Miller v. Miller, 375 S.C. 443, 652 S.E.2d 754 (Ct. App. 2007)\r\n  (stating a finding of contempt is a serious matter, and it should be imposed\r\n  sparingly); see also Frazier\r\n    v. Dreyfuss, 14 So. 3d 1183 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2009) (noting the\r\n  plaintiff's court case was dismissed for failure to arbitrate); Merrifield\r\n    v. Hadlock,&nbsp;961 A.2d 1107 (Me. 2009) (holding where the parties\r\n  impeded the alternative dispute resolution process, dismissal of the complaint\r\n  was the proper remedy).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2010-MO-032","title":"Harley v.
