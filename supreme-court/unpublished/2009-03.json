Clegg, 377 S.C. 643, 652, 661 S.E.2d 791, 796 (2008) (holding\r\n  this Court grants deference to the circuit courtâ€™s credibility determination\r\n  when evaluating the timeliness of a motion for reconsideration, as the circuit\r\n  court is in a better position to evaluate credibility and assign comparative\r\n  weight to testimony); Green v. Green, 320 S.C. 347, 351, 465 S.E.2d 130,\r\n  132 (Ct. App. 1995) (stating that the proper standard of review when\r\ndetermining if a motion was timely served by mail is abuse of discretion).[1]\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  This Court carefully reviewed the underlying proceeding in connection with\r\n  Appellantâ€™s Rule 59, SCRCP, motion.Â  Our decision to affirm the dismissal\r\n  results in no prejudice to Appellant for Appellantâ€™s post-trial motion was\r\n  meritless and certainly would have been denied.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2009-MO-014","title":"Staton v.
