Tahaei, Pro Se Respondent, of Summerville.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the Court of\r\nAppeals' decision in Tahaei v. Tahaei, 2012-UP-078 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Aug. 1,\r\n2012). We grant the petition, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the Court\r\nof Appeals' decision.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in reviewing the trial court's decision de novo. An\r\naction to determine the existence of a common law marriage is an action at law,\r\nbut the question of whether a common law marriage exists is one of fact.\r\nCampbell v. Christian, 235 S.C. 102, 104, 110 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1959). In an action at\r\nlaw, on appeal from a case tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the trial court\r\nwill not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which\r\nreasonably supports the trial court's findings. Townes Assoc., Ltd. v. City of\r\nGreenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976). Under the proper \"any\r\nevidence\" standard of review, we find the record contains sufficient evidence to\r\nuphold the trial court's findings of fact, including the existence of a common-law\r\nmarriage. The Court of Appeals erred by supporting its finding of the existence of\r\na common law marriage with its own findings of fact from the record.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is hereby\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2014-MO-022","title":"Travelers Property Casualty v.

He raised only one\r\nissue on direct appeal, contending the trial court committed reversible error in\r\nallowing testimony that petitioner invoked his right to counsel after an initial\r\nwaiver in violation of Doyle v. Ohio, 426 U.S. 610 (1976).1 The Court of Appeals\r\naffirmed in an unpublished opinion, State v. Wilson, Op. No. 2012-UP-99 (S.C. Ct.\r\nApp. filed February 22, 2012), and this Court granted certiorari to review this\r\nevidentiary holding. We agree with petitioner that the Court of Appeals erred in\r\nupholding the admission of this evidence but find the error harmless and therefore\r\naffirm.                                FACTS\r\n\r\nThe victim died from a single gunshot to the head. She was shot at approximately\r\n5:00 am in her own bed with her two year-old son beside her and her five year-old\r\ndaughter in the apartment. Petitioner, the father of the two children and the\r\nvictim's ex-boyfriend of nine years, admitted in his trial testimony that he was\r\nholding the gun when the victim was shot. He contended, however, that he was\r\njust waving it around when the victim, who was asking him to stop \"playing\r\naround,\" hit his hand/the gun causing it to discharge.\r\n\r\nThere was evidence that petitioner's reaction to the shooting was overly dramatic\r\nand that his overreaction was insincere, especially from neighbors who were\r\nfamiliar with the couple and with the fact the victim had \"put petitioner out\" about\r\nsix weeks before the shooting. Further, the victim's sister testified that petitioner\r\nhad threatened the victim about two days before her death, stating, \"Tell [victim]\r\nI'm going to kill her, and she don't know when I'm coming.\"\r\n\r\nThe State was unable to produce forensic evidence that absolutely refuted\r\npetitioner's contention that the shooting was the accidental result of the victim's\r\nactions. In support of this theory, the defense presented two experts. The first\r\n\r\n As discussed infra, this case does not involve a traditional application of the\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nDoyle rule.\r\n\nexpert testified his DNA analysis supported petitioner's statement that the victim\r\nhit the gun, as he found DNA from both the victim and petitioner on the handgun.\r\nThe second defense expert stated that his testing methods allowed him to detect\r\ntrace amounts of gunshot residue below the thresholds used by SLED. He opined\r\nthat he would have expected to find much higher levels of residue on the victim's\r\nhands if she had been in a defensive posture when the shot was fired.\r\n\r\nDuring its case-in-chief, the State called Det. Goldstein. Det. Goldstein testified he\r\nwent to the police station to interview petitioner, who had been brought there after\r\nthe shooting. An in camera hearing was held, and Det. Goldstein testified that\r\nafter petitioner was read his Miranda2 rights, he answered Det. Goldstein's\r\nquestions for about twenty minutes before stopping and asking for a lawyer. In\r\nspeaking with Det. Goldstein, petitioner initially maintained that he had been on\r\nthe apartment's stairs when the victim was shot, but as the detective's questions\r\nzeroed in on the plausibility of the five year-old daughter or the two year-old son\r\nbeing the shooter, petitioner became quite agitated and subsequently asked for an\r\nattorney, ending the questioning. Petitioner testified in camera that he asked for a\r\nlawyer several times before his request was honored.\r\n\r\nPetitioner's motion to suppress his statements to Det. Goldstein was denied.\r\nBefore the jury returned, petitioner asked that Det. Goldstein not be permitted to\r\ntestify that petitioner had invoked his right to counsel after first waiving his\r\nMiranda rights and answering questions for twenty minutes. The judge denied this\r\nrequest, stating \"it's part of what happened . . . you have to show me a case that\r\nsays they can't do that.\" Counsel cited Doyle, supra, but the trial judge held that\r\nthe fact that petitioner asked for counsel after twenty minutes was admissible as\r\n\"part of the investigative process.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Det. Goldstein testified before the jury, this exchange took place before he\r\nrelated the substance of petitioner's answers:\r\n\r\n               Q. \tDid [petitioner] later change his mind and ask to speak to an\r\n                   attorney?\r\n\r\n               A. \tYes, he did.\r\n\r\n               [Petitioner's Attorney]: Objection, Your Honor.\r\n\r\n    Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n2\r\n\n             The Court: Basis?\r\n\r\n             [Petitioner's Attorney]: Comment upon one's exercise of these\r\n                 rights.\r\n\r\n             The Court: Overruled. It was part of the investigation. You\r\n                may continue.\r\n\r\nDet. Goldstein was asked the same question again and affirmed that petitioner\r\nchanged his mind and asked for an attorney.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found no error in the trial court's admission of evidence that\r\npetitioner invoked his right to counsel. The court reasoned there was no Doyle\r\nviolation because petitioner's invocation of his right after speaking with Det.\r\nGoldstein was not introduced as substantive evidence of petitioner's guilt. State v.\r\nWilson, supra. We granted petitioner's request for a writ of certiorari to review this\r\ndecision.                              ISSUE\r\n\r\n             Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial court's\r\n             admission of evidence of petitioner's invocation of his right to\r\n             counsel and if so, does that error warrant reversal?\r\n\r\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn Doyle, the Supreme Court held that it was a violation of a criminal defendant's\r\ndue process rights to permit the State to impeach him with evidence that he\r\nremained silent after being given Miranda warnings. The Court later held there\r\nwas no Doyle violation, however, where a defendant who chose to speak after\r\nbeing warned had his trial testimony impeached by his voluntary post-Miranda\r\nstatements to police. The Court held:\r\n\r\n             Doyle bars the use against a criminal defendant of silence\r\n             maintained after receipt of governmental assurances. But Doyle\r\n             does not apply to cross-examination that merely inquires into\r\n             prior inconsistent statements. Such questioning makes no\r\n             unfair use of silence, because a defendant who voluntarily\r\n\n             speaks after receiving Miranda warnings has not been induced\r\n             to remain silent. As to the subject matter of his statements, the\r\n             defendant has not remained silent at all. See United States v.\r\n             Agee, 597 F.2d 350, 354-356 (CA3) (en banc), cert. denied, 442\r\n             U.S. 944, 99 S. Ct. 2889, 61 L.Ed.2d 315 (1979); United States\r\n             v. Mireles, 570 F.2d 1287, 1291-1293 (CA5 1978); United\r\n             States v. Goldman, 563 F.2d 501, 503-504 (CA1 1977), cert.\r\n             denied, 434 U.S. 1067, 98 S. Ct. 1245, 55 L.Ed.2d 768 (1978).\r\n\r\n             Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404, 408 (1980).\r\n\r\nThat Doyle does not apply to bar impeachment when a Mirandized defendant\r\nwaives his rights to remain silent and chooses to speak is well-settled. See also\r\nBabick v. Berghuis, 620 F.3d 571 (6th Cir. 2010).\r\n\r\nHere, however, we are not concerned with the State's right to impeach petitioner\r\nwith his post-Miranda statement to Det. Goldstein, or with the admissibility of the\r\ncontents of that exchange as part of the State's case-in-chief. Rather, the issue here\r\nis the State's right to introduce evidence in its case-in-chief that petitioner's\r\ninterrogation ended because he invoked his right to remain silent.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals identified two bases for admitting Det. Goldstein's testimony\r\nthat petitioner's questioning ceased when he asked for an attorney. First, it held the\r\nevidence that petitioner gave a statement and then invoked his right to silence\r\ndemonstrated that the pre-invocation statement was voluntary. We do not see how\r\nthis is so: the evidence of voluntariness comes from the pre-statement conduct by\r\nthe police and factors personal to the defendant, not from the defendant's reason for\r\nterminating the interrogation. See, e.g. State v. Carmack, 388 S.C. 190, 694 S.E.2d\r\n224 (Ct. App. 2010) (factors to be considered in determining whether, under the\r\ntotality of the circumstances, a statement was voluntary include: the defendant's\r\nmaturity, education, physical and mental health as well as the length and condition\r\nof custody, and any promises of leniency or threats of violence). Second, the Court\r\nof Appeals reasoned Det. Goldstein's testimony that questioning ended when\r\npetitioner invoked his rights served \"to challenge [petitioner's] testimony that he\r\nwas too intimidated to request counsel.\" The flaw in this reasoning is that while\r\npetitioner had testified at the in camera hearing, the jury had heard nothing from\r\npetitioner when Det. Goldstein testified. There was no testimony from petitioner\r\nto impeach at this juncture, and therefore this \"challenge\" rationale fails.\r\n\nMiranda states that \"where in-custody interrogation is involved, there is no room\r\nfor the contention that the privilege is waived if the individual answers some\r\nquestions . . . prior to invoking his right to remain silent.\" Miranda at 475-6.\r\nAccordingly, there is no question that petitioner was entitled to and in fact did\r\ninvoke his right to remain silent. We agree with the First Circuit that a mid-\r\ninterrogation assertion of Miranda rights is as protected as an immediate\r\ninvocation and that permitting the government to use evidence of this invocation in\r\nits case-in-chief violates both Miranda itself and the policy underlying Doyle. As\r\nthat circuit recognized, Doyle does not permit evidence that a defendant exercised\r\nhis Miranda rights because this type of evidence \"raises a clear inference of\r\nculpability.\" U.S. v. Andujar-Basco, 488 F.3d 549, 556 (1st Cir. 2007); compare\r\nState v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (distinguishing post-\r\nMiranda conduct erroneously offered in case-in-chief as substantive evidence of\r\nguilt from proper use as impeachment). Here, the clear inference is that petitioner\r\nterminated his interview because his pre-invocation claim that he was not present\r\nwhen the victim was shot was patently untrue.\r\n\r\nWe hold the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial court's ruling permitting\r\nthe State to offer evidence in its case-in-chief of petitioner's mid-interrogation\r\nassertion of his right to counsel. The jury was entitled to learn from Det. Goldstein\r\nthat the interview ended but not that it did so because petitioner exercised his\r\nMiranda rights.\r\n\r\nThe State argues, and we agree, that under the circumstances of this case the error\r\nin admitting evidence that petitioner exercised his Miranda rights mid-\r\ninterrogation does not warrant reversal. E.g. State v. Smith, 230 S.C. 164, 94\r\nS.E.2d 886 (1956) (appellant bears burden of persuading court of reversible error).\r\nPetitioner does not challenge the voluntariness of his statement to Det. Goldstein in\r\nwhich he denied being in the bedroom when the victim was shot, and therefore that\r\nstatement was properly admitted into evidence. When petitioner took the stand in\r\nhis defense and told a different story, he acknowledged the falsity of his initial\r\nstatement to Det. Goldstein. Thus petitioner himself confirmed the negative\r\ninference that he was not being truthful suggested by his mid-interrogation\r\ninvocation of counsel. In light of petitioner's admission that his pre-invocation\r\nstatement was untrue, and since following Det. Goldstein's testimony there was no\r\nfurther reference to petitioner's invocation of his right to an attorney either during\r\nthe trial or in the solicitor's closing argument, we find petitioner has not met his\r\nburden of convincing us this error warrants reversal of his convictions. State v.\r\nSmith, supra.\r\n\n                                CONCLUSION\n\r\n\r\nAlthough we do not agree with the Court of Appeals that there was no error on the\r\npart of the trial court, we find the error harmless under the circumstances and\r\ntherefore, the Court of Appeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\nJames E.

Leventis, IV, both of\r\n            McKay Cauthen Settana & Stubley, PA, of Columbia,\r\n            for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In this appeal, we reviewed the circuit court's order\r\naffirming the South Carolina Workers' Compensation Appellate Panel's decision\r\n\nthat Respondents were entitled to stop paying Appellant's workers' compensation\r\nbenefits. Appellant contends that Respondents waived the election of remedies\r\ndefense because the carrier knew of Appellant's intent to file a third-party lawsuit\r\nand initially took action indicating joint pursuit of the third-party lawsuit, yet did\r\nnot raise the election of remedies defense until more than two years later.\r\n\r\n       \"Waiver is a voluntary and intentional abandonment or relinquishment of a\r\nknown right.\" Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 480, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009)\r\n(quoting Parker v. Parker, 313 S.C. 482, 487, 443 S.E.2d 388, 391 (1994)).\r\nWaiver \"may be expressed or implied by a party's conduct.\" Parker, 313 S.C. at\r\n487, 443 S.E.2d at 391 (citing Mende v. Conway Hosp., Inc., 304 S.C. 313, 404\r\nS.E.2d 33 (1991)). \"An implied waiver results from acts and conduct of the party\r\nagainst whom the doctrine is invoked from which an intentional relinquishment of\r\na right is reasonably inferable.\" Lyles v. BMI, Inc., 292 S.C. 153, 158–59, 355\r\nS.E.2d 282, 285 (Ct. App. 1987) (citing Pitts v. N.Y. Life Ins. Co., 247 S.C. 545,\r\n148 S.E.2d 369 (1966)). Based on the circumstances of this case and the authority\r\ncited above, we reverse and remand to the South Carolina Workers' Compensation\r\nCommission to reinstate Appellant's workers' compensation benefits.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent as I can find no reversible\r\nerror in the circuit court's ruling that Respondents did not waive their right to\r\nassert the defense of election of remedies. It is well-settled that a carrier's\r\nactual knowledge of an injured worker's intent to file third party suit does not\r\nexcuse the injured party's failure to comply with the notice requirements of\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 42-1-560 (1985). See Callahan v. Beaufort Cnty Sch. Dist.,\r\n375 S.C. 92, 96, 651 S.E.2d 311, 313 (2007) fn.2. The circuit court agreed\r\nwith the factual finding of the Full Commission that Respondents \"raised this\r\ndefense, election of remedies, at every contested hearing in this case since the\r\ndefense became viable . . . .\" Under the substantial evidence scope of review,\r\nI find that we must uphold this factual finding and affirm. E.g., Bridges v.\r\nHousing Auth., City of Charleston, 278 S.C. 342, 295 S.E.2d 872 (1985).\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2014-MO-032","title":"Patton v.
