State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 \r\n  S.E.2d 60 (1986).\r\nBefore the start of his trial, petitioner made a motion to quash the indictment.Â  \r\n  Petitioner argued the section of the first degree burglary statute that he was \r\n  being charged under unconstitutionally denied him due process because it allowed \r\n  his prior crimes to be introduced as elements of first degree burglary. [1] Â  The trial judge denied the motion.Â  \r\nAfter the first day of trial, petitioner entered a plea of guilty but mentally \r\n  ill.Â  Trial counsel requested that the plea be accepted subject to petitionerâ€™s \r\n  right to appeal the constitutionality of the burglary statute; the State did \r\n  not object.Â  The trial judge accepted the plea and stated, â€œ[T]he appeal will \r\n  be taken, but he will not be prejudiced with respect to his right to contest \r\n  the portion of the statute that provides that burglary in the first degree is \r\n  based upon two prior convictions of burglary or housebreaking, two or more prior \r\n  convictions.â€Â  \r\nIn this State, guilty pleas must be unconditional.Â  State v. Peppers, \r\n  346 S.C. 502, 552 S.E.2d 288 (2001).Â  If a defendant attempts to attach any \r\n  condition to a guilty plea, then the trial court should direct a plea of not \r\n  guilty.Â  State v. Oâ€™Leary, 302 S.C. 17, 393 S.E.2d 186 (1990).Â  It is \r\n  impermissible for a defendant to preserve constitutional issues while entertaining \r\n  a guilty plea.Â  Id.Â  If the trial court accepts a conditional guilty \r\n  plea, then the plea will be vacated on appeal.Â  Peppers, supra.\r\nIn our opinion, petitionerâ€™s guilty plea was conditional and was, therefore, \r\n  invalid.Â  Trial counsel, the State, and the trial judge all acknowledged the \r\n  conditional nature of petitionerâ€™s guilty plea during the proceeding, yet the \r\n  plea was still accepted.Â  Accordingly, petitionerâ€™s guilty plea is vacated and \r\n  the case is remanded for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1]  â€œA person is guilty of burglary in the first degree \r\n  if the person enters a dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a \r\n  crime in the dwelling, and . . . the burglary is committed by a person with \r\n  a prior record of two or more convictions for burglary or housebreaking or a \r\n  combination of both . . . .â€Â  S.C.
