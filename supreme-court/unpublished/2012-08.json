McIntosh, Senior Assistant\r\n        Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Senior\r\n        Assistant Attorney General Melody Jane Brown, all of\r\n        Columbia, and Solicitor W. Walter Wilkins, of\r\n        Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\n       PER CURIAM: Clifford Wylie was convicted of murder, possession of a\r\nfirearm during the commission of a violent crime, and unlawful conduct toward a\r\nchild. He subsequently was sentenced to life without parole for murder, ten years'\r\nimprisonment for unlawful conduct toward a child, and five years' imprisonment\r\nfor possession of a firearm, all to run concurrent. He argues on appeal the circuit\r\ncourt erred in: (1) determining he was competent to stand trial without first\r\ngranting a continuance to obtain the full competency report required by Section 44-\r\n23-420(A) of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2011)1; (2) not granting a\r\ncontinuance so he could procure the full court-ordered report regarding his\r\ncriminal responsibility2; (3) permitting a doctor who did not perform the victim's\r\nautopsy to testify about its results, and a psychologist to repeat statements made by\r\nWylie's son, in violation of Wylie's right to confrontation under the Sixth\r\nAmendment; (4) not finding the psychologist's testimony also was inadmissible\r\nhearsay; and (5) sentencing him for possession of a firearm in contravention of\r\nSection 16-23-490(A) of the South Carolina Code (2003). We affirm pursuant to\r\nRule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n      1. Competency: State v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151\r\n         (1985) (\"Error is harmless when it 'could not reasonably have affected the\r\n         result of the trial.'\" (quoting State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 93, 180 S.E.2d\r\n         888, 890 (1971))); see also State v.

Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 396, 360 S.E.2d\r\n         706, 709 (1987) (\"The very nature of the inquiry as to a defendant's\r\n         competency to stand trial demands that a court not be bound strictly by\r\n         the views of experts.\").\r\n\r\n      2. Criminal Responsibility: Mitchell, 286 S.C. at 573, 336 S.E.2d at 151\r\n         (defining harmless error); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 17-24-10(B) (2003)\r\n         (\"The defendant has the burden of proving the defense of insanity by a\r\n         preponderance of the evidence.\"); State v.
