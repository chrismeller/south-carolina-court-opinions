Zelenka, of Columbia, for Respondent-Petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:&nbsp; Petitioner-Respondent (Bowens) pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to imprisonment for twenty-three years.Â  No direct appeal was taken.\r\nBowensâ€™ first application for post-conviction relief (PCR) was denied by Judge Rawl.&nbsp; This Court denied Bowensâ€™ request for a writ of certiorari.\r\nAfter a hearing on Bowensâ€™ second PCR application, Judge Pieper granted Bowens a belated review of the denial of his first PCR application pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991).&nbsp; Both Bowens and the State now ask this Court for a writ of certiorari.&nbsp; We grant both petitions, dispense with further briefing, and reverse the order of Judge Pieper.\r\nBecause Bowens received appellate review of Judge Rawlâ€™s order, Judge Pieper erred in granting him another review of the decision.&nbsp; Prior PCR counselâ€™s failure to preserve an issue for appellate review by filing a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend does not constitute a unique circumstance which would allow Bowens to file a successive PCR application alleging ineffective assistance of prior PCR counsel.&nbsp; Aice v. State, 305 S.C. 448, 409 S.E.2d 392 (1991).&nbsp; Accordingly, Judge Pieperâ€™s order granting Bowens a belated review of Judge Rawlâ€™s order is\r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.&nbsp; BURNETT, J. and PLEICONES, J., not participating\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2006-MO-012","title":"Sasser v.
