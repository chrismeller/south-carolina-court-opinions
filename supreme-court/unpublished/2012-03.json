Code Ann. §\r\n  63-7-650 (2010) as well as DSS Policy 928.02.[2] \r\n  Section 63-7-650 requires DSS investigate a relative seeking temporary\r\n  placement of a child who has been taken into emergency protective custody.  The\r\n  statute states that if the review of records, including the CR, &quot;reveals\r\n  information indicating there is a significant risk that the child would be\r\n  threatened with abuse or neglect in the home of the relative,&quot; then DSS\r\n  &quot;must not agree to or acquiesce in [that] placement.&quot;  Id.  \r\nAt the hearing on appellants'\r\n  Motion to Intervene, DSS indicated that if a person is found to be on the CR,\r\n  then DSS absolutely will not place the child with that individual.  The DSS\r\n  attorney went on to say that, while DSS took the position that if a person is\r\n  listed on the CR then DSS is prevented from acquiescing, perhaps the family\r\n  court could nonetheless order placement with that individual.  DSS also\r\n  indicated that the presence in the appellants' home of the Grandchildren's\r\n  father, who returned to South Carolina after Mother's arrest, would cause it\r\n  not to place the Grandchildren there since father was  facing charges of\r\n  criminal domestic violence, second offense.    \r\nAfter DSS denied appellants'\r\n  custody request, they filed this motion to intervene in the DSS child abuse and\r\n  neglect action against Mother.  DSS opposed appellants' request to intervene\r\n  because the matter was in a confidential posture, and it would be inappropriate\r\n  for appellants to have access to the confidential materials that were part of\r\n  the case.  See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 63-7-930; -940 (2010) (confidentiality\r\n  of abuse/neglect information).  Mother also opposed permitting appellants to\r\n  intervene.  \r\nThe family court denied\r\n  appellants' request to intervene and this appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    family court commit reversible error in denying appellants' motion to\r\n    intervene?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe family court denied\r\n  appellants' request to intervene in Mother's abuse and neglect action for five\r\n  reasons:\r\n\r\n  1)  S.C. Code Ann. §§ 63-7-1700 et seq. (2010), upon\r\n    which appellants relied, concerns permanency planning and does not create a\r\n    right to intervene in this abuse and neglect action;\r\n  2)  DSS\r\n    has a statutory obligation to review the CR;\r\n  3)  Appellants do not have an interest compelling\r\n    intervention;\r\n  4)  Appellants seek to intervene in this confidential\r\n    DSS matter in order to gain an advantage in a contemplated custody action\r\n    against Mother; and\r\n  5)  Appellants should bring a separate private action\r\n    to obtain custody.  \r\n\r\nOn appeal, appellants do not\r\n  challenge all five grounds upon which the family court rested its decision. \r\n  Accordingly, those unchallenged rulings, whether correct or not, are the law of\r\n  the case.  E.g., SCDSS v. M.R.C.L., 393 S.C. 387, 712 S.E.2d 452\r\n  (2011).  Moreover, appellants have raised a number of issues for the first time\r\n  on appeal.  Issues must be raised and ruled on by the trial court in order to\r\n  be preserved for appellate review.  E.g., In re McCracken, 346\r\n  S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d 235 (2001).  We decline to address any issue which is not\r\n  preserved.\r\nIt appears that the heart of\r\n  appellants' argument is that Grandmother should not be on the CR, and\r\n  tangentially the correctness of DSS's apparent policy of automatically refusing\r\n  to place a child in the custody of a person whose name is on that registry. \r\n  The only issue we can decide today, however, is whether appellants have\r\n  demonstrated an abuse of discretion in the family court's denial of their\r\n  motion to intervene in Mother's abuse and neglect action.  E.g., Sauner\r\n    v. Pub. Serv. Auth. of S.C., 354 S.C. 397, 581 S.E.2d 161 (2003). \r\n  Appellants have not met their burden of demonstrating reversible error here,\r\n  and we therefore affirm.  This affirmance is without prejudice to appellants'\r\n  rights, in a different proceeding, to challenge Grandmother's continuing\r\n  placement on the CR and/or DSS's policy of automatically denying such persons\r\n  custody.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe appealed order is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] DSS erroneously argues that the denial of appellants' motion to intervene is\r\n  not directly appealable.  Ex parte Johnson, 63 S.C. 205, 41 S.E. 308\r\n  (1902).   \r\n[2] This policy is not in the record.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2012-MO-003","title":"Rachels v.

Mungo, 254 S.C. 438, 442, 175 S.E.2d 802, 804 (1970).  \r\nAnalysis\r\n It is within a trial\r\n  judge's inherent power to dismiss actions sua sponte for a party's failure to\r\n  prosecute the relevant claims.  Crestwood Golf Club, Inc. v. Potter, 328\r\n  S.C. 201, 211, 493 S.E.2d 826, 832&nbsp;(1997).  Although a trial judge enjoys\r\n  broad discretion in her decision to dismiss a case, &quot;[i]t is of course\r\n  contemplated that the . . . rule will be reasonably applied so as to accomplish\r\n  its purpose of expediting the orderly disposition of litigation on the\r\n  merits.&quot;  Mungo, 254 S.C. at 442–43, 175 S.E.2d at 804.  This Court\r\n  views the dismissal of a case with prejudice as an especially harsh sanction.  See\r\n    id. at 443–44, 175 S.E.2d at 804 (finding the court's dismissal of an\r\n  action with prejudice was unjustified and modifying the order to a dismissal\r\n  without prejudice); see also McComas v. Ross, 368 S.C. 59, 61, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 902, 904 (Ct. App. 2006) (trial judge alters dismissal with prejudice to\r\n  dismissal without prejudice to lessen the sanction). \r\n In McCargo v.\r\n  Hedrick, 545 F.2d 393 (4th Cir. 1976), the United States Court of Appeals\r\n  for the Fourth Circuit outlined four factors that should be considered when\r\n  determining whether a dismissal was proper under Rule 41(b) of the Federal\r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure.[3]  Id. at 396.  First, dismissal is only proper when there has been a\r\n  &quot;'clear record of delay or contumacious conduct by the plaintiff.'&quot;  Id. (quoting Reizakis v. Loy, 490 F.2d 1132, 1135 (4th Cir. 1974)).  Second,\r\n  the court should consider the amount of prejudice caused the defendant by the\r\n  delay.  McCargo, 545 F.2d at 396.  Third, the reviewing court should\r\n  look at whether &quot;the record indicated a 'drawn out history' of\r\n  'deliberately proceeding in a dilatory fashion.'&quot;  Id. (quoting Reizakis,\r\n  490 F.2d at 1135) (emphasis added).  Lastly, the court should look at whether\r\n  the trial court considered sanctions less drastic than dismissal.  McCargo,\r\n  545 F.2d at 396.  In concluding that &quot;the balance tips in favor of a trial\r\n  on the merits rather than dismissal for want of prosecution,&quot; the McCargo court relied heavily on communications contained in the record.  See id.\r\n Considering the\r\n  four factors outlined in McCargo, we find the dismissal of these cases\r\n  for want of prosecution amounts to an abuse of discretion.  First, there is no\r\n  clear record that the Appellant has engaged in contumacious conduct or delay\r\n  tactics.  The only account this Court has of the proceedings is the Summons and\r\n  Complaint, the Motion for Summary Judgment, and the Order of Dismissal filed in\r\n  Ms. Abbott's action.  These documents give the Court no indication that\r\n  Appellant was engaging in delay tactics or stubborn behavior.  Second, the\r\n  Appellant's delay in filing even the motions for summary judgment did not\r\n  prejudice Respondents, as the sum total of the money sought did not increase\r\n  from the time of filing the complaints to the time of the dismissals.  Third,\r\n  the Record does not illuminate a drawn out history of Appellant deliberately\r\n  proceeding in a dilatory fashion.  Lastly, we find the sanction of dismissing\r\n  all thirty cases with prejudice was unduly harsh when the Record supports that,\r\n  rather than sitting on its laurels, Appellant filed motions for summary\r\n  judgment to move these cases forward. \r\nConclusion\r\n Based on the\r\n  foregoing, we find the dismissal of these cases with prejudice was an unduly\r\n  harsh sanction, constituting an abuse of discretion.  Therefore, we vacate\r\n  these orders and remand these cases for appropriate proceedings.\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This case is a consolidation of thirty separate debt collection actions. No\r\n  Respondent has filed a brief in this case.\r\n[2] The Record only includes the Complaint, Motion for Summary Judgment, Order, and\r\n  other documents associated with the debt collection action against the first\r\n  named respondent in this consolidated case, Teresa A. Abbott.  These documents\r\n  are primarily pre-printed forms with the applicable information filled in, and\r\n  we take notice that the court documents in the remaining 29 debt collection\r\n  actions are materially similar.\r\n[3] Rule 41(b) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure is substantially\r\n  similar to the federal rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2012-MO-005","title":"Blash v.
