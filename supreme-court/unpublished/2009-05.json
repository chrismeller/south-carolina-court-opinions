McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Brian T.\r\n  Petrano, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tDiana L.\r\n  Holt, of Columbia, for Respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Respondent Ralph L. Williams was sentenced\r\n  to life without parole pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003).Â  After an unsuccessful direct appeal, Williams\r\n  filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR); after a hearing, the\r\n  application was granted.Â  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition to review the grant\r\n  of PCR, and now reverse.Â  Â \r\n1.&nbsp; The PCR\r\n  court found that Williamsâ€™ trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel with respect to the handling of a pretrial Neil v. Biggers[1]Â  hearing.Â  There is no evidence to\r\n  support the PCR courtâ€™s decision.Â  Trial counsel vigorously challenged the\r\n  admissibility of the photographic lineup and in-court identification of\r\n  Williams.Â  Simply because the trial court found the evidence admissible does\r\n  not render counselâ€™s representation ineffective.Â  We reverse pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR. Â See also Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144-45, 526\r\n  S.E.2d 222, 224-25 (2000) (setting forth the analytical framework for\r\n  establishing ineffective assistance of counsel and noting that when â€œno\r\n  probative evidenceâ€ supports the PCR courtâ€™s ruling it will not be upheld). \r\n2.&nbsp; The PCR\r\n  court found that Williamsâ€™ trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel by failing to investigate the triggering offense which qualified Williams\r\n  for a life without parole sentence, as the investigation would have shown that\r\n  Williams was previously represented by the trial judge (then a public defender)\r\n  that sentenced him to life without parole.Â  The PCR court found that the\r\n  representation created a conflict of interest for the trial judge who sentenced\r\n  Williams to life without parole.Â  We concur with the PCR court that the record does\r\n  appear to reflect that the trial judge was involved, at least initially, in\r\n  representing Williams many years earlier.[2]Â \r\n  The record, however, reveals not a hint of any prejudice as a result of the\r\n  prior representation, for the record demonstrates that the experienced trial\r\n  judge presided fairly and with impartiality.Â  There is no evidence to support\r\n  the contrary finding of the PCR court.Â  We reverse pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1),\r\n  SCACR.Â  \r\n3.&nbsp; The PCR\r\n  court found that Williamsâ€™ trial counsel provided ineffective assistance of\r\n  counsel by moving the trial court to reconsider Williamsâ€™ life without parole\r\n  sentence, when such motion provided the State an opportunity to conclusively\r\n  prove that Williams criminal record did require a sentence of life without\r\n  parole pursuant section 17-25-45.Â  The PCR courtâ€™s premise that, but for the\r\n  resentencing hearing, the State would not have had an opportunity to prove the\r\n  existence of Williamsâ€™ triggering offense, as a matter of law, was incorrect.Â  The\r\n  trial court had made the finding at sentencing that Williamsâ€™ prior record\r\n  required a life without parole sentence.Â  It was precisely because of trial\r\n  counselâ€™s laudable diligence that the trial court invited Williams to challenge\r\n  the prior conviction in a post trial motion.Â  We reverse pursuant to Rule\r\n  220(b)(1), SCACR.Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003) (â€œ[U]pon a conviction for a most serious offense\r\n  as defined by this section, a person must be sentenced to a term of\r\n  imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole if that person has one\r\n  or more prior convictions . . . .â€).\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; 409 U.S. 188 (1972).\r\n[2]&nbsp; From the record we can glean that the trial judgeâ€”then public\r\n  defenderâ€”was initially assigned to represent Williams on an armed robbery\r\n  charge.Â  However, a colloquy between Williams and the trial judge that occurred\r\n  just after the jury returned its verdict reflects that Williams had been\r\n  represented by another public defender, concerning his earlier charge.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2009-MO-023","title":"Tanks v.

Currie, 305 S.C. 115, 406 S.E.2d 356\r\n  (1991).Â  Although a discovery order is not generally immediately appealable, a\r\n  writ of certiorari may be issued to review a discovery order where exceptional\r\n  circumstances exist.Â  Lafitte v. Bridgestone Corp., 381 S.C. 460, 674\r\n  S.E.2d 154 (2009).Â  On certiorari, this Court will\r\n  review only errors of law and will not review factual findings unless wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry v. Cohen,\r\n  256 S.C. 13, 180 S.E.2d 650 (1971).\r\nRule 26(b)(1), SCRCP, provides, unless otherwise limited by order of the court, â€œ[p]arties may\r\n  obtain discovery regarding any matter, not privileged, which is relevant to the\r\n  subject matter involved in the pending action . . . It is not ground for\r\n  objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the trial if the\r\n  information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of\r\n  admissible evidence.â€Â  If the discovery process threatens to become abusive or\r\n  create a particularized harm to a litigant or third party, the trial judge may\r\n  issue an order â€œto protect a party or person from annoyance, embarrassment,\r\n  oppression, or undue burden by expense.â€Â  Rule 26(c), SCRCP; Hamm v.\r\n    S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 312 S.C. 238, 439 S.E.2d 852 (1994).Â  If a person\r\n  requesting a protective order shows a particularized harm which will be caused\r\n  by allowing the discovery, the opposing party has the burden of showing the\r\n  information sought is â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€ to the case.Â  Lafitte v.\r\n    Bridgestone Corp., supra; Hamm v. S.C. Publ. Serv. Commâ€™n,\r\n      supra.Â  In determining whether a protective order is necessary, the trial\r\n  judge is required to weigh the factors of whether the information sought is â€œrelevant\r\n  and necessaryâ€ evidence against any particularized harm the opposing party may\r\n  suffer.Â  Lafitte v. Bridgestone Corp., supra; Hamm v. S.C. Pub. Serv.\r\n    Commâ€™n, supra.Â  In determining whether information is necessary, the party\r\n  seeking the information must â€œdemonstrate with specificity exactly how the lack\r\n  of information will impair the presentation of the case on the merits to the\r\n  point that an unjust result is a real, rather than a merely possible, threat.â€Â  Lafitte v. Bridgestone Corp., 674 S.E.2d at 163.Â  The trial court must\r\n  determine whether there are reasonable alternatives available to discover the\r\n  information.Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court judge found the confidential health information of the nonparty\r\n  patients was properly protected by the November 14th Protective\r\n  Order.Â  He found modifying the prior order to allow respondents to interview\r\n  the witnesses was â€œboth reasonable and highly relevant toâ€ respondentsâ€™\r\n  claims.Â  However, the judge specifically found the â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€\r\n  balancing test was not applicable in this matter and made no findings that the\r\n  interviews were necessary.\r\nThe\r\n  circuit court erred as a matter of law in finding the â€œrelevant and necessaryâ€\r\n  test was inapplicable.Â  Because the judge did not address whether the\r\n  interviews with the nonparty patients were necessary to respondentsâ€™ claims, we\r\n  reverse the order of the circuit court modifying the Protective Order and\r\n  remand this matter for a finding on this portion of the â€œnecessaryâ€ element of\r\n  the test.\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
