Crum, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Because of the unusual procedural history\r\n  of the underlying criminal matter and this post-conviction relief matter, we\r\n  granted certiorari in our original jurisdiction.[1] Â We are presented with both direct appeal and post-conviction relief (PCR) issues.Â \r\n  We dismiss the direct appeal and affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s finding based on our\r\n  standard of review.\r\nAs to the direct\r\n  appeal issues, counsel for petitioner filed a brief pursuant to Anders v.\r\n    California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967) and a petition to be relieved as counsel.Â \r\n  Petitioner has not filed a pro se response.Â  After a thorough review of\r\n  the record pursuant to Anders, we dismiss the direct appeal and grant\r\n  the petition to be relieved as counsel.\r\nRegarding\r\n  the sole PCR issue presented related to the service of notice of the Stateâ€™s\r\n  intent to seek a sentence of life without parole, we hold there is evidence in\r\n  the record to support the PCR courtâ€™s holding that Petitioner received proper\r\n  notice.Â  We affirm pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR and the following authorities:Â  Pierce\r\n    v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144-45, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000) (â€œ[An appellate\r\n  court] will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value to support them.â€); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989) (â€œThe appropriate scope of review of this Court is\r\n  that â€˜any evidenceâ€™ of probative value is sufficient to uphold the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  findings.â€).\r\nAccordingly, in our\r\n  original jurisdiction, counsel is relieved and the belated direct appeal is dismissed.Â \r\n  We further affirm the denial of post-conviction relief.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner was convicted and sentenced to life without parole for the\r\n  offense of armed robbery, which was his second â€œmost serious offenseâ€ under section\r\n  17-25-45 of the South Carolina Code (2003).Â  A direct appeal was not pursued.Â \r\n  Trial counselâ€™s failure to file a direct appeal led to Petitioner seeking a\r\n  belated direct review pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208\r\n  S.E.2d 35 (1974) in this post-conviction relief action.Â  PCR counsel then\r\n  failed to file a timely notice of appeal from the denial of post-conviction\r\n  relief.Â  When the untimely appeal was presented to this Court, we accepted the\r\n  matter in our original jurisdiction by granting a writ of certiorari rather\r\n  than delaying the matter further by requiring Petitioner to file a second PCR\r\n  action and seek belated review under Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409\r\n  S.E.2d 395 (1991).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2009-MO-008","title":"Jones v.
