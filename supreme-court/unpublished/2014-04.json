We affirm pursuant to\r\nRule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Brady v. United States, 397\r\n\nU.S. 742, 751 (1997) (holding that the fact that a plea was \"motivated by the\r\ndefendant's desire to accept the certainty or probability of a lesser penalty rather\r\nthan face a wider range of possibilities extending from acquittal to conviction and a\r\nhigher penalty authorized by law\" does not render the plea invalid); Godinez v.\r\nMoran, 509 U.S. 389, 397–400 (1993) (holding that a defendant must be\r\ncompetent in order to knowingly and voluntarily enter into an agreement); Spoone\r\nv. State, 379 S.C. 138, 141–44, 665 S.E.2d 605, 606–08 (2008) (holding the\r\nknowing and voluntary standard is the proper standard by which to judge the\r\nvalidity of a plea agreement in a non-capital case where the agreement waived the\r\ndefendant's rights to appellate, post-conviction relief, and habeas review, and\r\nholding the defendant knowingly and voluntarily entered into the agreement);\r\nRoddy v. State, 339 S.C. 29, 33, 528 S.E.2d 418, 421 (2000) (\"To find a guilty plea\r\nis voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must establish that the\r\ndefendant had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges\r\nagainst him.\"); Sims v. State, 313 S.C. 420, 423, 438 S.E.2d 253, 254 (1993)\r\n(holding that a defendant is competent when he has a sufficient present ability to\r\nconsult with his lawyer with a reasonable degree of rational understanding and a\r\nrational as well as factual understanding of the proceedings against him).\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
