McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Daniel E. Grigg, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Steven Roy Earley\r\n  pled guilty in 2003 to a charge of murder.Â  The plea judge sentenced Earley to\r\n  thirty years in prison pursuant to a plea agreement.Â  Earley did not file a\r\n  direct appeal.Â  He subsequently filed a PCR application alleging ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  Among other things, Earley asserted counsel failed to\r\n  file an appeal.Â  The PCR judge denied the application, finding counsel was not\r\n  ineffective.Â  This Court granted Earleyâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari and\r\n  granted him a belated appeal pursuant to White v. State, 263 S.C. 110,\r\n  208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  \r\nEarley has now\r\n  filed a brief for his belated appeal in which he argues that his guilty plea\r\n  was not knowingly and voluntarily entered as required by Boykin v. Alabama,\r\n  395 U.S. 238 (1969).Â  Specifically, Earley contends (1)&nbsp;he was not advised\r\n  that if he were tried by a jury the verdict would have to be unanimous, and (2)\r\n  the plea in this case was supported by only two pages of facts.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:Â  State\r\n    v. McKinney, 278 S.C. 107, 292 S.E.2d 598 (1982) (holding the unknowing and\r\n  involuntary nature of a guilty plea cannot be attacked on direct appeal absent\r\n  a timely objection on this basis at the plea proceeding); McCray v. State,\r\n  271 S.C. 185, 188, 246 S.E.2d 230, 231 (1978) (stating, in the context of a\r\n  belated appeal under White, a â€œdefendant can . . . raise and argue on\r\n  the â€˜belated appealâ€™ [only] those issues [that] could have been raised and\r\n  argued on a timely direct appealâ€); State v. Lambert, 266 S.C. 574, 579,\r\n  225 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1976) (holding a plea judge need not â€œdirect the\r\n  defendantâ€™s attention to each and every constitutional right and obtain a\r\n  separate waiver of eachâ€ and that â€œan enumeration of specific rights waived is\r\n  not required where the record otherwise reveals affirmative awareness of the\r\n  consequences of a guilty pleaâ€).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-042","title":"Dawson v.
