Little (â€œLittleâ€) appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nThe\r\n  facts, as we borrow heavily from Littleâ€™s brief, are as follows.Â  In early June 2003, Frankey Galloway, aging and\r\n  paraplegic, was admitted into a nursing home while being treated for an\r\n  illness.Â  Frankey, who had stored away his life savings in cash at various\r\n  locations in his home, feared its safety in his absence and asked his brother\r\n  Cleo to collect the money and store it in a safe deposit box.Â  Cleo went to\r\n  Frankeyâ€™s house, found the cash in the locations Frankey described, and took it\r\n  home where he counted it in the presence of his wife and daughter.Â  Cleo\r\n  tallied two hundred fifty-three thousand, eight hundred and forty-three dollars\r\n  ($253,843.00), and reported this sum to Frankey, who confirmed that figure\r\n  matched his expectation of the value of the stored cash.Â  Cleo placed the cash\r\n  in a safe deposit box at a Wachovia Bank branch in Pickens, South Carolina.Â  Shortly\r\n  thereafter, the money was removed and placed in two safe deposit boxes at\r\n  Central Carolina Bank (â€œCCB,â€ now known as Sun Trust Bank).Â  \r\nIn August 2004,\r\n  Frankey was released from the nursing home and Cleo and another brother, Avery,\r\n  gave him four keys to the safe deposit boxes.Â  Cleo and Avery were listed on the\r\n  lease agreement as co-lessees.\r\nOn\r\n  November 24, 2004, Avery passed away.Â  In accordance with Averyâ€™s will, his\r\n  stepson Little and stepdaughter Betty Joy Innazzone (â€œJoyâ€) were appointed\r\n  personal representatives of his estate.[1]Â \r\n  Within a week of Averyâ€™s passing, Sammy and Joy went to CCB to ask if Avery had\r\n  any accounts at the bank.Â  On December 4, 2004, the boxes were drilled open in\r\n  the presence of Sammy and Joy.Â  Sammy and Joy left the bank with the cash from\r\n  both boxes, in the amount of two hundred and twenty nine thousand, seven\r\n  hundred and ninety-six dollars ($229,796.00).\r\nThe\r\n  primary issue on appeal is whether the Special Referee erred in finding a\r\n  constructive trust because he failed to exclude certain testimony pursuant to the\r\n  Dead Manâ€™s Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 19-11-20\r\n  (2008).Â  We have reviewed the\r\n  record on appeal, and find overwhelming evidence to support the Special\r\n  Refereeâ€™s finding that a constructive trust was established for the benefit of\r\n  Frankey Galloway.Â  We therefore affirm the decision of the Special Referee.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n WALLER,\r\n  ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\n  James E.
