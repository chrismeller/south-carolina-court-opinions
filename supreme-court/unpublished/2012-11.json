Berl,\r\n               of Hilton Head Island, and John William Farrell, of\r\n               Hilton Head Island, for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Appellant sued defendant Brown and respondents Baroni,\r\nLaughlin, and Associated Construction Consultants, Inc. (ACCI) for damages\r\nincurred when Brown renovated appellant's vacation condominium on Hilton Head\r\nIsland. After a non-jury trial, the master found for appellant on all his claims\r\nagainst Brown and awarded him $307,520.73 in damages and attorney’s fees. He\r\nfound for respondents on all issues, and appellant appeals. We affirm.\r\n\r\n                                       FACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant, an Ohio resident, hired Brown d/b/a Southeastern Services to renovate\r\nappellant's condo. Brown, who was not properly licensed, approached Baroni,\r\nseeking to have Baroni and his company, ACCI, assist him in obtaining a building\r\npermit for the project. While Baroni initially rebuffed Brown, he met with Brown\r\nlater and conditionally agreed to help him \"pull\" a permit from the town of Hilton\r\nHead.\r\n\r\nIt is uncontested that Brown eventually obtained a building permit from Hilton\r\nHead for appellant's project using ACCI's information. When Brown's work on the\r\nrenovations was unsatisfactory, appellant reported Brown to the South Carolina\r\nDepartment of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation's Contracting Board (LLR).\r\nBrown admitted he was not licensed, and eventually was cited by LLR for several\r\nstatutory violations arising out of his work on appellant's condo.\r\n\r\nIn the course of LLR's investigation into Brown's licensure, LLR's attention was\r\ndrawn to respondent Baroni and ACCI and their relationship to Brown in\r\nconnection with appellant's renovations. Following an investigation, Baroni and\r\nACCI entered a Consent Agreement admitting they unlawfully lent their license1 to\r\nBrown. Under the terms of this Agreement, Baroni and ACCI agreed to pay a\r\n$1,000 penalty and to be placed on probation for one year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    See S.C. Code Ann. § 40-11-110(A)(9) (2011).\r\n1\r\n\n                                       ISSUES\r\n\r\n             1. \tDid the master err in refusing to allow appellant to invoke\r\n                 non-mutual collateral estoppel on the issue of license\r\n                 lending?\r\n\r\n             2. \tDid the master err in finding appellant failed to prove\r\n                 respondents were the proximate cause of his damages?\r\n\r\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nPursuant to the doctrine of collateral estoppel, a party may be precluded from\r\nrelitigating an issue decided in a previous action. Non-mutual collateral estoppel\r\nmay be asserted by a non-party to the first action in the second action, unless the\r\nparty sought to be precluded lacked a full or fair opportunity to litigate the issue in\r\nthe first action, or there are other circumstances that justify permitting the party to\r\nrelitigate the issue in the second case. South Carolina Prop. and Cas. Ins. Guar.\r\nAss'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 403 S.E.2d 625 (1991).\r\nCircumstances which may justify relitigation, and thus deny a party non-mutual\r\noffensive collateral estoppel, are found in the Restatement (Second) of Judgments\r\n§ 28 and § 29. Id.\r\n\r\nHere, the master concluded that two exceptions found in § 28 applied. Assuming\r\nwithout deciding that this was error, appellant must also demonstrate the master\r\nerred in finding Brown's negligent work rather than respondents' license lending\r\nand other alleged statutory violations were the proximate cause of appellant's\r\ndamages. See, e.g., Madison ex rel. Bryant v. Babcock Center, Inc., 371 S.C. 123,\r\n638 S.E.2d 650 (2006) (proximate cause requires proof of both causation in fact\r\nand legal cause). The question of proximate cause is ordinarily for the finder of\r\nfact. Id.\r\n\r\nThis is an action at law tried to a judge alone. In this type of case, the credibility of\r\nwitnesses and the weight of the evidence is exclusively for the master. Regions\r\nBank v. Strawn, ____ S.C. ____, ____ S.E.2d ____ (Ct. App. 2012). We find there\r\nis evidence in the record supporting the master's finding that respondents' statutory\r\nviolations were not the proximate cause of appellant's damages. Id.; Madison ex\r\nrel. Bryant, supra.\r\n\n                             CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe order of the master is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2012-MO-048","title":"Graves v.

Pascoe, Jr., of Columbia, for Amicus\r\n             Curiae Solicitors' Association of South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n       PER CURIAM: Bryan Phillips was tried and convicted, along with his co-\r\ndefendant K.C. Langford, III, for armed robbery, kidnapping, first degree burglary,\r\nand criminal conspiracy. Langford's convictions are affirmed in a published\r\nopinion issued today. State v. Langford, Op. No. 27195 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed\r\nNovember 21, 2012). This case presents the same facts and raises the same\r\nquestions as Langford, viz., whether Section 1-7-330 of the South Carolina Code\r\n(2005), which grants solicitors control of the General Sessions docket, violates the\r\nseparation of powers doctrine, whether Phillips was denied due process because\r\nsection 1-7-330 permits judge shopping, and whether he was denied his right to a\r\nspeedy trial. In addition to the issues addressed in Langford, Phillips also argues\r\nthe circuit court erred in qualifying the Chinese interpreter used during his trial and\r\nin not granting a mistrial due to comments made by the solicitor in closing\r\narguments. We affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following\r\nauthorities:\r\n\r\n      1. Separation of Powers: Langford, supra.\r\n\r\n      2. Due Process: Id.\r\n\r\n      3.

Graddick, 345 S.C. 383, 387, 548 S.E.2d 210, 211-12\r\n         (2001) (\"As a corollary of the right to remain silent, a prosecutorial\r\n         comment upon a defendant's failure to testify at trial is constitutionally\r\n         impermissible.\"); State v.
