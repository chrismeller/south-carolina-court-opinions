S.C. Dep't of Probation, Parole and Pardon Servs.,\r\n\nOp. No. 2012-UP-503 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Sept. 5, 2012). We grant the petition,\r\ndispense with further briefing, reverse the Court of Appeals' opinion, and remand\r\nthe case to the circuit court for a decision on petitioner's appeal.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole and Pardon Services\r\n(SCDPPPS) denied petitioner's request for parole. The Administrative Law Court\r\naffirmed the denial. On June 13, 2005, petitioner appealed the denial to the circuit\r\ncourt and simultaneously sought to have his appeal transferred to the Court of\r\nAppeals. The SCDPPPS opposed the transfer, and the transfer was denied.\r\n\r\nIn 2011, SCDPPPS moved to dismiss petitioner's appeal pending in the circuit\r\ncourt, arguing the Court of Appeals, rather than the circuit court, had subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction over petitioner's appeal. The circuit court dismissed the appeal,\r\nand the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\n\r\nBecause petitioner filed the appeal in the circuit court on June 13, 2005, prior to\r\nthe effective date of 2006 Act No. 3871 the circuit court had jurisdiction to hear\r\npetitioner's appeal. Accordingly, we reverse the Court of Appeals' opinion and\r\nremand the case to the circuit court for a decision on petitioner's appeal.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\nBEATTY, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Act 387, which was signed into law on June 9, 2006, and became effective on June 1, 2006,\r\nprovided a uniform procedure for contested cases and appeals from administrative agencies. The\r\nAct amended § 1-23-610, but indicated that petitions for judicial review that were pending before\r\nthe circuit court at that time would be heard in accordance with the former law.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2014-MO-013","title":"South v.

Brandt, PA, of Walhalla,\r\n            for Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: We affirm the order granting a new trial under the Thirteenth\r\nJuror Doctrine since there is conflicting evidence in the record whether appellant\r\nwas negligent. See e.g. Rivera v. Newton, 401 S.C. 402, 413, 737 S.E.2d 193, 198\r\n\n(Ct. App. 2012)(\"As long as there is conflicting evidence, the trial court's grant of a\r\nnew trial will not be disturbed.\"). We remind the parties that the evidentiary\r\nrulings made in the first trial, including whether there was evidence warranting a\r\njury charge, do not \"carryover\" to the next proceeding. See e.g. Branham v. Ford\r\nMotor Co., 390 S.C. 203, 232, 701 S.E.2d 5, 20 (2010); Odom v. Steigerwald, 260\r\nS.C. 422, 428, 196 S.E.2d 635, 638 (1973).
