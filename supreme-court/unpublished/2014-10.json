The PCR judge held appellate counsel was deficient for\r\nfailing to raise the properly preserved issue on appeal. Further, the PCR judge\r\nfound respondent was prejudiced by the deficiency because the State's case hinged\r\non the admissibility of the drugs discovered during the traffic stop, and if the\r\nevidence would have been suppressed, the State's efforts to prosecute respondent\r\nwould have been greatly affected.\r\n\r\nAlthough the issue was properly preserved for appellate review, there is no\r\nreasonable probability the Court of Appeals would have reversed respondent's\r\nconviction had appellate counsel raised the issue. See Southerland v. State, 337\r\nS.C. 610, 524 S.E.2d 833 (1999) (holding petitioner must prove that, but for\r\nappellate counsel's deficient performance, there is a reasonable probability that the\r\nresult of the appeal would have been different); see also United States v. Carter,\r\n300 F.3d 415 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding an officer's recognition of the smell of\r\nmarijuana upon executing a traffic stop is sufficient to constitute probable cause to\r\nsearch both the suspect and the passenger area of the vehicle). The order granting\r\nrespondent's PCR application is therefore\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2014-MO-037","title":"Adams v.
