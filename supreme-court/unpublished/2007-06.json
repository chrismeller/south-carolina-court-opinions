Jay Hulst, of Williams &amp; Hulst, LLC, of Moncks Corner, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tJohn P. Seibels, Jr., of The Seibels Law Firm, PA, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: Â The trial court granted summary judgment to the City of Goose Creek (Respondent), finding the deeds which purported to convey property to Respondent are not void.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1967, Forest Lawn Company (Appellant) purchased property from Arista Corporation.Â  The property was located in the Colonial Heights subdivision near Goose Creek.Â  Appellantâ€™s note was secured by a mortgage on the entire property.Â  The first mortgage was held by Arista.Â  The second mortgage was held by Jack Brickman, the President of Arista, in the amount of $50,000.Â  In 1977, Arista and Brickman released their liens on lots 80-119[1] to Appellant after Appellant applied $35,000 toward the mortgage.Â  The releases were duly recorded in 1977.Â  Â \r\nBrickman filed a foreclosure action against Appellant for failure to make payments on the note in 1993.Â  At the hearing for the foreclosure action, Brickman testified: â€œA number of parcels and lots have been released from the lien of my mortgage; and, of course, these would be excluded from the foreclosure proceedings.â€Â  In 1994, the Master-in-Equity ordered the sale of the property â€œsaving and excepting therefrom, however, such tracts and lots which have heretofore been released from the lien of [Appellantâ€™s] mortgage.â€Â  Millwright Services, a junior lienholder, purchased the property and recorded the deed in 1995.Â  The Notice of Sale signed by the Master included the same language as the Masterâ€™s order, which provided an exception for certain lots previously released.Â  However, the deed and Notice of Sale specifically included lots 80-83 as part of the property conveyed.Â  Appellant filed a motion to reconsider which was denied.Â \r\n \r\nIn 1998, Millwright Services conveyed its interest in lots 80-83 to Respondent under a general warranty deed.Â  Respondent purchased title insurance on the property.Â  After Appellant discovered the conveyance, he repeatedly notified Respondent of his alleged interest in lots 80-83 and provided copies of all the pertinent documents to prove the Masterâ€™s deed was erroneous. Â \r\nIn 2005, Appellant filed a complaint in Berkeley County alleging, inter alia, (1) the deed conveying property to Respondent is void insofar as it relates to lots 80-83; (2) the Masterâ€™s deed conveying property to Respondentâ€™s predecessor-in-interest, Millwright Services, as a result of the foreclosure action erroneously included lots 80-83 and was, therefore, void; and (3) Appellant is the rightful owner of lots 80-83.Â  The trial court granted Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment, holding the deeds in dispute are not void because the foreclosure action from which they originate is not void.Â  The trial court also found Respondent qualified for protection under the bona fide purchaser doctrine, and Appellantâ€™s failure to address the alleged error of the deed for almost ten years rose to the level of laches and waiver, which bar the action.Â  Appellant responded by filing this appeal.Â \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;I.\r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tholding the Master had authority to effect the sale of the property when lots 80-83 had been released from the mortgage?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in \r\n\t\t\tfinding Respondent was a bona fide purchaser?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nOn appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court.Â  David v. McLeod Regâ€™l Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 626 S.E.2d 1 (2006).Â  A trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Pittman v. Grand Strand Entmâ€™t, Inc., 363 S.C. 531, 611 S.E.2d 922 (2005).Â  The appellate court, like the trial court, must view all ambiguities, conclusions, and all inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.Â  Osborne v. Adams, 346 S.C. 4, 550 S.E.2d 319 (2001).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Authority of the Master\r\nThe trial court held the conveyance of lots 80-83 under the Masterâ€™s deed was valid and, in doing so, mistakenly focused on subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Whether the Masterâ€™s judgment was a proper exercise of jurisdiction is not an issue.Â  Rather, the issue is whether the Master had authority to effect the sale of lots 80-83 when the lots had previously been released from the mortgage.Â  We hold the Master did not have such authority.Â \r\n \r\nIt is well settled that a deed cannot convey an interest which the grantor does not have in the land described in the deed, even though by its terms the deed may purport to do so. Â Cummings v. Varn, 307 S.C. 37, 42, 413 S.E.2d 829, 832 (1992) (citing Griggs v. Griggs, 199 S.C. 295, 19 S.E.2d 477 (1942)).Â  This long-standing principle applies with equal force to the foreclosure of a mortgage and title conveyed under a Masterâ€™s deed.[2]Â  The Masterâ€™s deed could not convey title to lots 80-83 because those lots were no longer subject to the mortgage.Â  The erroneous inclusion of lots 80-83 in the Notice of Sale and deed does not change this fact.Â  Therefore, the trial court erred in granting Respondentâ€™s motion for summary judgment and determining the Masterâ€™s deed conveyed title of lots 80-83 to Respondent.\r\nII.Â  Bona Fide Purchaser\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in granting summary judgment to Respondent based on the alternative ground Respondent was a bona fide purchaser.Â  We agree.\r\nA bona fide purchaser is protected from anotherâ€™s claim to property when: (1) the purchase money was paid before notice of any outstanding encumbrances or equities; (2) the purchaser acquired legal title, or the best right to it, before notice of the outstanding encumbrances or equities; and (3) the purchaser purchased in good faith and without notice.Â  S.C. Tax Commâ€™n v. Belk, 266 S.C. 539, 543, 225 S.E.2d 177, 179 (1976).Â  \r\n \r\nThe issue is whether Respondent had notice lots 80-83 had been released to Appellant.Â  Under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-7-10 (2007), deeds or instruments conveying or releasing real property are valid to subsequent purchasers without notice when they are recorded.Â  Respondent cannot claim it was without notice of the release of lots 80-83 when such release had been properly recorded in 1977.Â  Therefore, Respondent was not a bona fide purchaser.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the trial court and hold Respondent was not entitled to summary judgment because the Master did not have authority to effect the sale of lots 80-83 when the lots had previously been released from the mortgage, and because Respondent was not a bona fide purchaser when it had record notice of such release.Â  We remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â Â  Accordingly, we need not address Respondentâ€™s laches and waiver arguments.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S .E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (explaining the appellate court need not address remaining issues when disposition of prior issues is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â Of the 39 lots released from the mortgage, only lots 80-83 are at issue.\r\n[2] See Belue v. Fetner, 251 S.C. 600, 606, 164 S.E.2d 753, 756, (1968) (â€œThe mortgage executed by Florence Belue necessarily covered only the life estate interest which she acquired under the deed from Ola Belue for that was all that she had; and the Masterâ€™s deed in the foreclosure could convey no more.â€); Bethea v. Bass, 240 S.C. 398, 126 S.E.2d 354, 360, (1962) (â€œThe mortgage from Thomas M. Bethea, Sr., in 1925, though purporting to include the fee, covered only his life estate, for that was all that he had; and the Masterâ€™s deed in the foreclosure could convey no more.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2007-MO-037","title":"Borghi v.

Bennett, Op. No.\r\n  2004-UP-439 (S.C. Ct. App. filed August 13, 2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  was charged with murdering and robbing the victim, an acquaintance, in her\r\n  home.Â  The Stateâ€™s case rested, almost exclusively, on the testimony of Andrew\r\n  Lindsay.Â  Lindsay admitted being in the trailer when petitioner killed the\r\n  victim, but denied having prior knowledge of petitionerâ€™s plans or assisting\r\n  him in committing the murder or the armed robbery.Â  Although petitioner\r\n  presented no evidence, he sought to suggest through cross-examination that\r\n  Lindsay had gone to the trailer alone and committed both offenses.\r\nAt the\r\n  outset of the trial, the State made a motion in limine to limit\r\n  Lindsayâ€™s impeachment by his 1991 conviction for second degree murder in Illinois.Â  Specifically, the State sought and obtained a ruling limiting the impeachment to\r\n  the fact that Lindsay had been convicted of a felony carrying a 15 year\r\n  sentence.Â  The Court of Appeals held that while the trial judge erred in\r\n  limiting Lindsayâ€™s impeachment, petitioner was not prejudiced by that ruling.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Whether the Court of Appeals erred in finding petitioner was not\r\n      entitled to a new trial because the trial court improperly limited his\r\n      impeachment of Lindsay?\r\n  \r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nRule\r\n  609(a)(1), SCRE, provides:\r\n\r\n  (a) General Rule.Â  For the purpose of attacking the credibility of a witness,\r\n  \r\n    (1) evidence that a witness other than an\r\n      accused has been convicted of a crime shall be admitted, subject to Rule 403,\r\n      if the crime was punishable by death or imprisonment in excess of one year\r\n      under the law under which the witness was convicted, and evidence that an\r\n      accused has been convicted of such a crime shall be admitted if the court\r\n      determines that the probative value of admitting this evidence outweighs its\r\n      prejudicial effect to the accusedâ€¦.\r\n  \r\n\r\nAccording to the reporterâ€™s\r\n  notes, the same standard for balancing prejudice against probative value under\r\n  Rule 403 is employed, whether the person to be impeached is a witness or a\r\n  criminal defendant.\r\nThe reason for\r\n  permitting a jury to learn of a witnessâ€™s prior conviction is to allow the\r\n  jurors to use the conviction in evaluating the witnessâ€™s credibility.Â  Rule\r\n  609.Â  Once the trial judge determines the witness has a qualifying prior\r\n  conviction, he must then apply a Rule 403 balancing test.Â  In weighing\r\n  prejudice and probative value, a trial judge must take into account\r\n  similarities between past convictions and present charges.Â  Close similarities\r\n  weigh against admissibility.Â  State v. Bryant, 369 S.C. 511, 633 S.E.2d\r\n  152 (2006). \r\nHere, the crime for\r\n  which petitioner was on trial, and for which he wished to shift suspicion to\r\n  Lindsay, was murder.Â  Had the judge wished, he could have excluded Lindsayâ€™s\r\n  prior homicide conviction altogether on the ground that prejudice outweighed\r\n  any probative value.Â  In permitting Lindsay to be impeached by his prior\r\n  offense, but prohibiting disclosure of the nature of the crime, the trial judge\r\n  removed the possibility that the jury would impermissibly use the prior\r\n  conviction to adjudge Lindsay guilty of this murder, rather than use the\r\n  conviction to evaluate his credibility.Â  Thus, petitioner was not deprived of\r\n  the impeachment value inherent in Lindsayâ€™s prior conviction.\r\nâ€œAn appellate court\r\n  will not disturb a trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning the scope of\r\n  cross-examination of a witness to test his credibilityâ€¦absent a manifest abuse\r\n  of discretion.â€Â  State v. Johnson, 338 S.C. 114, 525 S.E.2d 515 (2001).Â \r\n  We perceive no abuse of discretion here.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals affirming petitionerâ€™s convictions is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2007-MO-041","title":"Tolen v.
