Smith, Jr. of Smith Ellis &amp; Stuckey, P.A., of Columbia; and Julianne Farnsworth, of Farnsworth Law Firm, LLC, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n        Mark W. Hardee, of Columbia, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  This case is before us to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ unpublished decision affirming a directed verdict in this action to recover real estate commissions.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner Gamble worked as an on-site real estate salesperson at two residential developments, The Gates of Park West in Mt. Pleasant and The Gates of Wildwood in Columbia.Â  She was hired by respondents on October 1, 1998, and was terminated on May 6, 1999.Â  Under the original terms of her employment, petitioner was entitled to a 1.5% commission on all contracts that closed and she received a $3,000 per month draw against future commissions. Â \r\nAfter her termination, petitioner requested an accounting of her commissions on eighty-one properties she claimed she sold in Park West and ten in Wildewood.Â  In response, respondents offered her a â€œfinancial settlementâ€ of .4% commission on seventy-seven properties in Park West and .75% on eight properties in Wildewood.Â  \r\nPetitioner refused respondentsâ€™ settlement offer and commenced this action for unpaid real estate commissions alleging a violation of the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, fraud, and unjust enrichment.Â  \r\nAt the close of petitionerâ€™s case, the trial judge granted respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict on all causes of action except unjust enrichment finding petitioner failed to offer any evidence of closings on the contracts for which she claimed commissions.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\nWas a directed verdict properly granted?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioner does not dispute that under the terms of her employment with respondents she is entitled to commissions only on contracts that ultimately closed.Â  At trial, she specifically stated she was not owed any commission on contracts that did not close.Â  She further testified, â€œAll I am asking for is the 1.5 percent on all the sales that I generated that are closed.â€Â  She calculated the commissions owed her for Park West to be $134,926 based on an average sales price of $112,438.46 for the eighty properties she sold.Â  For the eight properties she sold in Wildewood, she calculated commissions due were $12,734.80.[1]Â  She contends this testimony raised an inference that these properties indeed closed, and therefore there was sufficient evidence to withstand respondentsâ€™ motion for directed verdict.Â  We agree.\r\nA directed verdict should not be granted when the evidence yields more than one inference or the inference is in doubt.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Dept. of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999).Â  On review, the evidence and all reasonable inferences must be viewed in the light most favorable to the party against whom the verdict was directed.Â  Quesinberry v. Rouppasong, 331 S.C. 589, 503 S.E.2d 717 (1998).Â  Viewed in this favorable light, petitionerâ€™s testimony stating she was claiming commissions only on contracts that closed and calculating her commissions raised an inference that closings occurred on these sales.Â  This evidence was sufficient to submit the case to the jury.Â  \r\nWe need not address petitionerâ€™s remaining issue.Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ decision affirming the directed verdict is REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT AND PLEICONES, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Petitioner concluded the total amount of commissions owed was $147,660.80, minus amounts respondents had already paid her in draws, leaving a balance due of $124,553.87. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-056","title":"Thompson v.

AT&amp;T, 105 F.3d 153 (4th Cir. 1997) determinative of the entire case.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the circuit court solely because of its finding that petitionerâ€™s action was barred by the statute of limitations.Â  Walsh v. Woods, 358 S.C. 259, 594 S.E.2d 548 (Ct. App. 2004). \r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding her causes of action for breach of contract and conversion accrued more than three years prior to the commencement of the present action.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWhile we make no decision regarding the merits of petitionerâ€™s claims, we find they are not barred by the statute of limitations because they did not accrue until respondent actually began receiving the SSB payments on September 30, 1998, which was less than three years prior to the commencement of the present action on February 12, 2001.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-3-530(1) and -530(5) (2005).Â  We therefore reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this matter to the Court of Appeals to rule on the merits of the circuit courtâ€™s prior grant of summary judgment in favor of respondent.Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
