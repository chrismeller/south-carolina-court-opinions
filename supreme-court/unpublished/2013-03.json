McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley\r\n          W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Ashleigh Rayanna\r\n          Wilson, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the\r\ncircuit court denying his application for post-conviction relief (PCR). We grant the\r\npetition, dispense with further briefing, and remand the matter to the circuit court.\r\n\r\nIn 2004, petitioner filed his first PCR application, alleging several grounds for\r\nPCR. The PCR judge granted petitioner relief on one of the grounds, and denied\r\nthe application as to the remaining grounds. This Court granted the State's petition\r\nfor a writ of certiorari and reversed the order of the PCR judge. Battle v. State, 382\r\nS.C. 197, 675 S.E.2d 736 (2009).\r\n\r\nPetitioner filed a second PCR application in 2010 alleging his first PCR counsel\r\nwas ineffective in failing to file a Notice of Appeal from the prior PCR order. The\r\nPCR judge dismissed the application without a hearing.\r\n\r\nPetitioner is entitled to effective assistance of counsel on appellate review in a PCR\r\naction and may pursue a claim for ineffective assistance of counsel for failing to\r\nseek review of a PCR order. Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991).\r\nA PCR applicant is entitled to an Austin review of a prior PCR order if there is an\r\naffirmative finding that the applicant either: (1) requested and was denied an\r\nopportunity to seek appellate review of the prior PCR order; or (2) did not\r\nknowingly and intelligently waive the right to appellate review of the prior PCR\r\norder. King v. State, 308 S.C. 348, 417 S.E.2d 868 (1992).\r\n\r\nBecause he has alleged ineffective assistance of prior PCR counsel in failing to\r\nseek appellate review of the prior PCR order, petitioner is entitled to an evidentiary\r\nhearing after which the PCR judge must determine whether petitioner is entitled to\r\nan Austin review of the prior PCR order. Accordingly, we remand this matter to\r\nthe PCR judge to conduct an evidentiary hearing on petitioner's 2010 PCR\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
