(Oswald-White), a real \r\n  estate company, brought this action for payment of a real estate commission \r\n  from Appellant Carn F. Hiott (Hiott) under an Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement \r\n  (Agreement) entered into by the parties.Â  The Special Referee awarded Oswald-White \r\n  $20,016, the contractually agreed commission.  \r\n  [1] Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the \r\n  early 1980s, Hiott purchased a 111.2-acre tract of land located in Colleton \r\n  County from his father for $400 per acre.Â  His father previously purchased the \r\n  parcel from a neighbor who operated a service station on the property when Hiott \r\n  was a child.\r\nOn September \r\n  27, 1999, Hiott and Oswald-White entered into an Exclusive Right to Sell Agreement, \r\n  which was a standard form contract drafted by Oswald-White.Â  The Agreement provided \r\n  Oswald-White was to receive a commission of 10 percent of the purchase price \r\n  for its services in obtaining a purchaser.Â  \r\nOn November \r\n  19, 1999, John R. Hetrick (Hetrick) agreed to buy the tract for $1,800 per acre.Â  \r\n  Three or four days before the Hetrick agreement, Hiott discovered what he thought \r\n  could be contamination on the property.Â  This discovery reminded him that oil \r\n  drums had been buried on the property when he was a child.Â  Hiott, by his own \r\n  admission, made an anonymous telephone call to Hetrickâ€™s office two days after \r\n  Hetrick agreed to buy the property discouraging Hetrick from purchasing the \r\n  tract because of the buried oil drums and potential contamination.Â  Â  \r\n Thereafter, \r\n  Hetrick withdrew his offer to purchase the property.Â  Hiott agreed to sell the \r\n  property only if Hetrick would sign a hold harmless agreement absolving Hiott \r\n  of any liability for any contamination existing on the tract.Â  Hetrick refused \r\n  and no sales contract was ever executed.Â Â  Â Â  \r\nIn this \r\n  action Oswald-White alleges breach of contract, fraudulent misrepresentation, \r\n  negligent misrepresentation, breach of contract with fraudulent intent, and \r\n  breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  The special referee \r\n  granted judgment in favor of Hiott on all claims except Oswald-Whiteâ€™s negligent \r\n  misrepresentation claim.Â  Holding Hiottâ€™s negligent misrepresentation of the \r\n  condition of the land resulted in Oswald-Whiteâ€™s lost commission, the special \r\n  referee ordered judgment in favor of Oswald-White. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the special referee err \r\n  in awarding Oswald-White commission based on Hiottâ€™s alleged negligent misrepresentation \r\n  of the condition of the land?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe special \r\n  referee determined Oswald-White earned its commission on the date Hetrick agreed \r\n  to buy the property and paid the required earnest money.Â  According to the referee, \r\n  Hiottâ€™s negligent misrepresentation occurred when he discovered the potentially \r\n  hazardous condition of the property and did not notify Oswald-White until two \r\n  days after Oswald-White received Hetrickâ€™s offer to purchase the property.Â  \r\n  The referee concluded Hiottâ€™s failure to disclose the condition of the property \r\n  directly and proximately caused Oswald-White to lose the commission to which \r\n  it is entitled under its contract with Hiott.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe elements necessary \r\n  to sustain a cause of action for negligent misrepresentation are not satisfied \r\n  in this case.Â  To establish liability for negligent misrepresentation, the plaintiff \r\n  must show (1) the defendant made a false representation to the plaintiff; (2) \r\n  the defendant had a pecuniary interest in making the representation; (3) the \r\n  defendant owed a duty of care to see that he communicated truthful information \r\n  to the plaintiff; (4) the defendant breached that duty by failing to exercise \r\n  due care; (5) the plaintiff justifiably relied on the representation; and (6) \r\n  the plaintiff suffered a pecuniary loss as a result of his reliance upon the \r\n  representation.Â  Sauner v. Public Service Authority of South Carolina, 354 S.C. \r\n  397, 407, 581 S.E.2d 161, 166 (2003).Â  Evidence of a mere broken promise is \r\n  not sufficient to prove negligent misrepresentation.Â  Id.\r\nOswald-Whiteâ€™s claim fails under \r\n  a negligent misrepresentation theory.Â  An essential element of this cause of \r\n  action is the defendant provide false information.Â  Hiott provided no false \r\n  information.Â  Oswald-White argues Hiottâ€™s failure to communicate the potential \r\n  contamination to the agency immediately upon discovery constitutes the false \r\n  statement.Â  While it is true silence can be a false representation, a true statement \r\n  cannot give rise to a claim of fraud or negligent misrepresentation.Â  Hiott \r\n  did what the law required him to do, i.e., tell the truth.Â  Although \r\n  Hiott initially revealed his concerns surreptitiously through the anonymous \r\n  phone call, he, nonetheless, told the truth.Â Â  In Lawson v. Citizens &amp; \r\n  Southern National Bank of S.C., 255 S.C. 517, 180 S.E.2d 206 (1971), this \r\n  Court held that a duty is imposed upon the seller of land to disclose to \r\n  the purchaser of land the existence of unstable conditions which are artificially \r\n  created and concealed.Â  Hiott did so when he called Hetrick to report what he \r\n  suspected could be contamination on the property.Â  Accordingly, we reverse.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  [1] The $20,016 was computed by calculating \r\n    10 percent of the purchase price Hetrick offered to pay for the entire tract \r\n    of land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2004-MO-038","title":"Ardis v.
