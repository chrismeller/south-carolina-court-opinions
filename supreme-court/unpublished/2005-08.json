Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005) and Evans v. State, 363 S.C. 495, 611 S.E.2d 510 (2005) (both holding that subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings belong; the indictment is a notice document and issues relating to the sufficiency of an indictment or the indictment process generally are not issues of subject matter jurisdiction, but must be timely raised to the trial judge in order to be preserved for appellate review).\r\nRegardless, the issue is without merit.Â  The indictment in Respondentâ€™s case stated:\r\n\r\n  DISTRIBUTION OF CRACK COCAINE\r\n    That LARKLAND RICHARDS AKA JAMAICAN RICHÂ  did in Aiken County on or about March 29, 2001, distribute to an undercover operative a quantity of Crack Cocaine, a controlled substance under provisions of Â§ 44-53-110, et seq., Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976), as amended, such distribution not having been authorized by law. \r\n\r\nThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.Â  See Gentry, 363 S.C. at 103, 610 S.E.2d at 500 (explaining that â€œ[i]n determining whether an indictment meets the sufficiency standard, the court must look at the indictment with a practical eye in view of all the surrounding circumstances,â€ and citing precedent and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-20 (2003)); State v. Gill, 355 S.C. 234, 240, 584 S.E.2d 432, 435 (Ct. App. 2003) (finding in case decided before Gentry that crack cocaine indictment which did not list mens rea element of â€œknowinglyâ€ nevertheless was sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the circuit court).\r\nWe conclude the indictment contained the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently apprised Respondent of what he was required to meet.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the order of the PCR judge granting Respondentâ€™s application.\r\nREVERSED\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-041","title":"Augustine v.

Casey Manning, Plea Judge\r\nÂ B. Hicks Harwell, Post-Conviction Relief Judge\r\n\r\nMemorandum Opinion No.Â  2005-MO-041\r\nSubmitted August 11, 2005 - Filed August 15, 2005\r\n\r\nVACATED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Assistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry D. McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Christopher L. Newton, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Pursuant to a plea bargain, petitioner pled guilty to a number of criminal offenses, including possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.Â  He later applied for post-conviction relief (PCR), alleging the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his plea to possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Finding the guilty plea to be â€œlegally improper,â€ the PCR judge remanded the case for resentencing but declined to vacate the conviction altogether.Â  Petitioner seeks a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s ruling.\r\nAt issue is petitionerâ€™s conviction for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490 (2003), which provides in pertinent part, â€œIf a person is in possession of a firearm . . . during the commission of a violent crime and is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent crime . . . he must be imprisoned for five years, in addition to the punishment provided for the principal crime.â€Â  Although petitioner was indicted for various crimes of violence, pursuant to the plea bargain, he was not convicted of any violent crimes.Â  As a result, petitioner claims the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to accept his plea to violating Â§ 16-23-490.Â  \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of a general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000).Â  The circuit court undoubtedly has subject matter jurisdiction to hear and determine criminal matters.Â  Petitioner was indicted for a recognized criminal offense, and he pled guilty as charged.Â  Therefore, we find the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find the PCR judge erred in remanding the case for a new sentencing hearing.Â  Petitionerâ€™s plea to possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime was not legally improper.Â  The plea was part of a negotiated plea agreement.Â  A review of the record indicates petitioner knowingly, intelligently and voluntarily agreed to plead guilty to possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime.Â  Accordingly, we vacate the PCR judgeâ€™s order remanding the case for resentencing.Â  See Rollison v. State, 346 S.C. 506, 552 S.E.2d 290 (2001) (holding that a defendant may, as part of a plea bargain, agree to plead guilty to a crime for which he has been indicted but for which he is not guilty as long as he understands the nature and crucial elements of the charges, the consequences of the plea, and the constitutional rights he is waiving).\r\nVACATED\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2005-MO-042","title":"Hughes v.

Â Â \r\nThe State contends the PCR judge erred in finding the circuit court without subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nIn State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005), this Court conclusively held that a defendant must raise a challenge to an indictmentâ€™s sufficiency before the jury is sworn and not afterwards.Â  Because petitioner failed to object to the sufficiency of the indictment before the jury was sworn, petitioner cannot collaterally attack the indictment in a PCR proceeding.Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge erred in finding that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We therefore reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s order.Â Â  \r\nReversed.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
