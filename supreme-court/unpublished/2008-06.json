State, 288 S.C. 290, 342 S.E.2d 60 (1986).\r\nPetitioner\r\n  contends his guilty plea was not\r\n  knowingly and voluntarily entered pursuant to Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 89 S.Ct. 1709, 23 L.Ed.2d\r\n  274 (1969), because the plea judge did not explain his privilege against\r\n  compulsory self-incrimination, his right to confront his accusers, or that a\r\n  jury would have to find him guilty by unanimous verdict if he went to trial.Â  \r\nThe plea judge informed petitioner of the maximum penalty for his\r\n  offense and warned petitioner he would forfeit his right to a jury trial and\r\n  rights associated with a jury trial by entering a guilty plea.Â  In addition,\r\n  plea counsel stated she informed petitioner of his rights and she believed\r\n  petitioner understood them.Â  Therefore, the record indicates petitioner had an\r\n  affirmative awareness of the consequences of a guilty plea. Â LoPiano v. State, 270 S.C. 563, 243 S.E.2d 448 (1978).Â  Accordingly, we affirm petitionerâ€™s convictions and\r\n  sentences.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.
