State, 263 S.C. 110, 208\r\nS.E.2d 35 (1974). Toomer argues the trial court erred in allowing the State to\r\nreference the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in its closing argument.\r\nAlthough he acknowledges he did not object to the statements, he contends the\r\nnature of the statements were so clearly prejudicial that the Court should disregard\r\nthe rules of preservation and grant him a new trial.

State Highway\r\nDep't v. Nasim, 255 S.C. 406, 411–12, 179 S.E.2d 211, 213 (1971) (finding\r\ncounsel's \"vicious\" use of \"abusive epithets\" against an adverse witness warranted\r\nthe grant of a new trial); cf. Vasquez v.
