Baptist Coll. at Charleston, 282 S.C. 53, 58-59, 317 S.E.2d 453, 457\r\n  (Ct. App. 1984) (&quot;If a donor intends to confer on another ownership of his\r\n  property, and if he proceeds so far as to do it, then the gift is complete. . .\r\n  . Mere improvidence is not sufficient to invalidate a donation.&quot;)\r\n  (citations omitted).Â  As\r\n  reprehensible as R.G. Stair's misconduct (financial and otherwise) may be,[1] an individual church member may not maintain an action to personally recover\r\n  unrestricted funds he or she donated to the church.Â  While we understand\r\n  Respondents' challenges to R.G. Stair's use of donated church funds for\r\n  personal expenses, an action for the recovery of the misspent funds, if any,\r\n  lies with the church, not the individual church members who donated the funds.Â \r\n  Here, notwithstanding R.G. Stair's admitted misconduct, the church as a body\r\n  has elected to take no action. Â See Bowen v. Green, 275 S.C. 431,\r\n  435, 272 S.E.2d 433, 435 (1980) (&quot;It is not for this court, to dictate\r\n  procedure for the church to follow. Â It is the function of this court, however,\r\n  in these circumstances, to assure that the church itself has spoken. Â If it\r\n  has, this court inquires no further. Â If it has not, this court may restore the\r\n  status quo to enable the church to act.&quot;).Â  In this case, the church has\r\n  spoken.Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  were we to consider the merits of this dispute, we would veer close to crossing\r\n  a line prohibited by the Constitution, for it would require this Court to\r\n  examine what qualifies as a &quot;religious purpose.&quot;Â  See Serbian\r\n  Eastern Orthodox Diocese v. Milivojevich, 426 U.S. 696, 722-23 (1976)\r\n  (holding the First Amendment gives religious organizations the freedom to\r\n  decide for themselves, free from state interference, matters of church\r\n  government, faith, and doctrine).Â  Respondents have not asserted that R.G.\r\n  Stair misrepresented his or Faith Cathedral Fellowship's identity to\r\n  Respondents.Â  Rather, Respondents have challenged certain expenditures made by R.G.\r\n  Stair as &quot;non-Christian&quot; and &quot;non-religious.&quot;Â  Compare\r\n  Molko v. Holy Spirit Assn., 762 P.2d 46 (Cal. 1988) (holding the\r\n  Constitution did not bar an action against the church for fraud where a member\r\n  alleged the church fraudulently induced him, through misrepresentation and\r\n  concealment of identity, to join the church and to give a monetary gift).Â \r\n  \r\n  \r\nWe reverse the\r\n  trial court judgments in favor of Respondents.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; There are many\r\n  allegations concerning R.G. Stair's &quot;non-religious&quot; expenditure of\r\n  church funds.Â  For example, R.G. Stair spent over $100,000 of church funds to\r\n  defend criminal charges arising from his many instances of sexual misconduct\r\n  with church members, including minors.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
