DHEC argues on appeal the court of appeals erred in finding the\r\nAdministrative Enforcement Order was arbitrary because that issue was never\r\nargued to or ruled upon by the ALC and furthermore contends there is no evidence\r\nto support the finding. We affirm the court of appeals as modified pursuant to\r\nRule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities:\r\n\r\n      1. Arbitrary:\t I'On v.

Equal Protection: \t Weaver v. S.C. Coastal Council, 309 S.C. 368, 423\r\n         S.E.2d 340 (1992) (finding an equal protection violation where a dock\r\n         permit was granted for two docks over a public oyster ground, but the\r\n         respondent's dock permit was denied on the basis that it would extend\r\n         over the public oyster ground); see also Vill. of Willowbrook v.
