Appellant claims that the trial court erred when it granted\r\n\nsummary judgment based on its finding that Appellant's claims were time barred.\r\nEven assuming section 15-79-125 of the South Carolina Code applies, as Appellant\r\nclaims, we find Appellant's claims are nonetheless barred by the statute of\r\nlimitations. Thus, we affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the\r\nfollowing authorities: S.C. Code Ann. § 15-78-110 (2005) (providing for a two-\r\nyear statute of limitations for claims brought under the TCA); id. § 15-79-125(C)\r\n(Supp. 2012) (requiring that the parties in a medical malpractice action participate\r\nin a pre-suit mediation conference); id. § 15-79-125(E) (Supp. 2012) (allowing\r\nparties to initiate a civil action only after participating in the pre-suit mediation\r\nconference).\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
