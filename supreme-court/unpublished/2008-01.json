Pachak, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense,\r\n  Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General, Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Karen\r\n  Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this case, we granted certiorari to review the denial of Petitioner Robert M. Watkinsâ€™\r\n  application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order\r\n  denying relief.Â   \r\nThe State alleged that Petitioner robbed a Chuck-E-Cheese\r\n  restaurant at approximately 1:00 a.m.Â  At trial, Elena Pelzer, Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  girlfriend, testified that on the night\r\n  of the robbery, Petitioner left their apartment at 9:30 p.m. and returned at\r\n  approximately 12:50 a.m.Â  Pelzer testified that shortly thereafter, they left\r\n  the apartment to get food, but were stopped by police and arrested for the\r\n  robbery.Â  During the jury charge conference, trial counsel requested an alibi\r\n  instruction, but the trial court refused based on trial counselâ€™s failure to comply\r\n  with Rule 5(e), SCRCrimP.[1]Â \r\n  The jury found Petitioner guilty, and the court of appeals dismissed Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  direct appeal pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â  State\r\n    v. Watkins, Op. No. 2004-UP-406 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 22, 2004).\r\nPetitioner\r\n  filed an application for PCR in which he alleged trial counsel was ineffective\r\n  for failing to obtain an alibi instruction.Â  At the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified that he believed the letter to\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s office complied with Rule 5(e)â€™s notice requirements.Â  The PCR court found trial counsel was not ineffective\r\n  because his belief that he complied with the rule was â€œwell foundedâ€ and\r\n  dismissed Petitionerâ€™s PCR application.Â  Petitioner argues to this Court that the\r\n  PCR court erred in ruling trial counsel was not ineffective.Â  We agree.Â \r\n \r\nThe\r\n  burden of proof is on the applicant in post-conviction proceedings to prove the\r\n  allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On appeal, the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling should be upheld if it is supported by any evidence of probative value\r\n  in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nBecause\r\n  Pelzerâ€™s testimony showed that Petitioner was at a different place at the time\r\n  of the robbery, he was entitled to an alibi charge.Â  State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 632, 545 S.E.2d\r\n  805, 819 (2001) (holding that if there\r\n  is any evidence to support a charge, the trial court should grant the request).Â \r\n  Thus, trial counsel was deficient for failing to raise this argument to the\r\n  trial court and obtaining an alibi instruction.Â  See Ford v. State, 314\r\n  S.C. 245, 442 S.E.2d 604 (1994) (holding that\r\n  counselâ€™s rejection of an alibi charge when the defendant claims that he was in\r\n  another place at the time of the commission of the criminal act constitutes\r\n  deficient representation under an objective standard of reasonableness).Â  Moreover,\r\n  Petitioner was prejudiced by the trial courtâ€™s failure to give an alibi\r\n  instruction because there is a reasonable probability that the result of trial\r\n  would have been different, as the State based its case against Petitioner\r\n  entirely on circumstantial evidence.Â  See Riddle v. State, 308\r\n  S.C. 361, 363, 418 S.E.2d 308, 309 (1992)\r\n  (holding that the failure to give an alibi charge, where the\r\n  defendant claims to be at another place, is reversible error); Roseboro v. State, 317\r\n  S.C. 292, 294, 454 S.E.2d 312, 313 (1995)\r\n  (noting that an alibi charge is considered especially crucial\r\n  when the evidence is entirely circumstantial).Â   \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that trial counsel was ineffective and grant Petitioner relief.Â  \r\n \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 5(e)(1), SCRCrimp,\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\tUpon\r\n  written request of the prosecution stating the time, date and place at which\r\n  the alleged offense occurred, the defendant shall serve within ten days, or at\r\n  such time as the court may direct, upon the prosecution a written notice of his\r\n  intention to offer an alibi defense. The notice shall state the specific place\r\n  or places at which the defendant claims to have been at the time of the alleged\r\n  offense and the names and addresses of the witnesses upon whom he intends to\r\n  rely to establish such alibi.\r\n\r\nThe trial court denied trial counselâ€™s request for an\r\n  alibi instruction because, although the notice stated that Pelzer would provide\r\n  an alibi defense, it did not state the specific place that Petitioner claimed\r\n  to have been at the time of the robbery.Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"2008-MO-002","title":"Robinson v.
