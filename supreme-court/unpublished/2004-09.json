(TEC) brought breach of \r\n  contract, unfair trade practice, and related actions against Rasmussen Iron \r\n  Works, Inc. (Rasmussen); Southeastern Marketing Group, LLC (Southeastern); Vari-Fuel \r\n  Specialty Products, Inc. (Vari-Fuel); and Champion Marketing Group (Champion).Â  \r\n  The jury returned verdicts against all defendants.\r\nRasmussen appealed.Â  Southeastern, Vari-Fuel, and Champion jointly appealed.Â  \r\n  TEC cross-appealed.Â  The three appeals were consolidated for review pursuant \r\n  to Rule 214, SCACR.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nTEC, a manufacturer of infrared gas barbecue grills based in Columbia, markets \r\n  its grills primarily through independent dealer representatives who sell them \r\n  to specialty retailers in the United States.Â Â  TEC entered into a contract in \r\n  May 1999 with Rasmussen, a California manufacturer of gas logs.Â  The contract, \r\n  drafted by TEC, originally granted Rasmussen the exclusive right to distribute \r\n  TEC grills in California and later was expanded to include Arizona and Nevada.Â  \r\n  The contract stated Rasmussen would use its â€œbest effortsâ€ to distribute the \r\n  TEC grill and â€œdiligently promoteâ€ its sale to dealers and other retailers in \r\n  California.Â  The contract further provided that â€œ[Rasmussen] will handle no \r\n  other consumer gas grills for which the manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail prices \r\n  for the highest priced unit exceed 70 percent of the suggested retail for TECâ€™s \r\n  lower priced unit.â€\r\nTECâ€™s three primary dealer representatives in 1999-2000 were Southeastern, \r\n  Vari-Fuel, and Champion (collectively, â€œthe Representativesâ€).Â  Each essentially \r\n  was a one-person company serving designated regions of the United States:Â  Tim \r\n  Wood at Southeastern, Gary Freeland at Vari-Fuel, and John Pell at Champion.Â  \r\n  The sale of TEC grills accounted for the majority of each representativeâ€™s business \r\n  in 1999-2000, and together the three representatives accounted for half of TECâ€™s \r\n  annual grill sales.Â  \r\nEach dealer representative in January 2000 signed an eighteen-month contract, \r\n  drafted by TEC, which stated the representative will â€œdo all things reasonable, \r\n  necessary, and appropriate to maximize sales of TECâ€™s Infra-red Gas Grill line.â€Â  \r\n  Each contract set forth expected sales goals in specified territories, which \r\n  the representative was â€œcommitted to achieving . . . at a minimum.â€Â  Each contract \r\n  further stated the representative â€œis free to handle other products or lines.â€ \r\n\r\nTEC alleged at trial that from March to September 2000, Rasmussen took various \r\n  steps to secretly develop and begin manufacturing its own new grill to compete \r\n  with TECâ€™s grill; thatÂ  Rasmussen solicited and met with Wood, Freeland, and \r\n  Pell to recruit them to sell Rasmussenâ€™s grill; and that Wood, Freeland, and \r\n  Pell actively participated in the planning and development of Rasmussenâ€™s grill.Â  \r\n  The events were described primarily through the testimony of Ted and Rett Rasmussen, \r\n  Jim Griffin, Wood, Freeland, and Pell, all of whom are principals and managers \r\n  of the defendant companies.\r\nTEC first heard of Rasmussenâ€™s new grill in August 2000.Â  Rasmussen owners \r\n  and managers, Wood, Freeland, and Pell did not inform TEC of the planning, development, \r\n  and expected manufacture of Rasmussenâ€™s new grill.Â  TEC terminated the contract \r\n  by giving a six-month notice of termination to Rasmussen as allowed by the contract.Â  \r\n  Rasmussen, in response, agreed to an immediate termination of the contract in \r\n  September 2000. [1] Â  TEC terminated \r\n  its contracts with Wood, Freeland, and Pell soon afterward.Â  No Rasmussen grills \r\n  were sold or distributed until after the contracts were terminated.\r\nTEC contends the contracts prohibited Rasmussen and the Representatives from \r\n  developing or handling Rasmussenâ€™s new grill.Â  The actions of Rasmussen and \r\n  the Representatives were in direct violation of the partiesâ€™ contracts and constituted \r\n  deceptive, unfair, and intolerable tactics under the South Carolina Unfair Trade \r\n  Practices Act (UTPA). [2] \r\nRasmussen and the Representatives each denied breaching their respective contracts \r\n  with TEC, testifying they continued to use their best efforts to promote and \r\n  sell the TEC grill even while preparing and discussing Rasmussenâ€™s grill.Â  Their \r\n  primary defenses were that no breach of contract or unfair trade practice had \r\n  occurred; the contracts did not prohibit them from developing or handling a \r\n  competing grill; all were separate companies and everything that occurred was \r\n  done in the name of competition and free enterprise; TECâ€™s change in marketing \r\n  efforts did not bode well for the future; and any lack of sales of TEC grills \r\n  in 2000 was attributable TECâ€™s shipping and quality problems, an economic downturn, \r\n  and increasing competition from other grill makers.Â  Rasmussen presented evidence \r\n  sales of TEC grills increased in California after it became a distributor.\r\nTECâ€™s chief financial officer David Oâ€™Kelly, qualified as an expert on corporate \r\n  financial records, explained the method he used to determine expected sales \r\n  goals for each defendant, as well as the formula he used to calculate lost profits.Â  \r\n  The sales goals were the bases of TECâ€™s alleged damages.Â  TEC alleged lost profits \r\n  in 2000 due to Rasmussenâ€™s, Southeasternâ€™s, Vari-Fuelâ€™s and Championâ€™s respective \r\n  breaches of contract.\r\nThe jury returned verdicts against Rasmussen for breach of contract and violation \r\n  of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act; and against Southeastern, \r\n  Vari-Fuel, and Champion for breach of contract and breach of contract accompanied \r\n  by a fraudulent act.\r\nLAW / ANALYSIS\r\nRasmussen and the Representatives each challenge the trial courtâ€™s rulings \r\n  relating to issues of liability and damages.Â  We find it necessary to address \r\n  only the liability issue:\r\n \r\n   \r\n    Rasmussen:Â  Did the trial court err in rejecting Rasmussenâ€™s argument that \r\n      as a matter of law TEC failed to prove a breach of contract because the \r\n      contract allowed Rasmussen to engage in the above-described acts without \r\n      violating the prohibition on â€œhandlingâ€ a competing grill?\r\n    The Representatives:Â  Did the trial court err in rejecting the Representativesâ€™ \r\n      argument that as a matter of law TEC failed to prove a breach of contract \r\n      because their contracts, which stated they were â€œfree to handle other products \r\n      or lines,â€ allowed them to engage in the above-described acts?\r\n  \r\n\r\nRasmussen and the Representatives both contend the trial court erred in not \r\n  ruling as a matter of law that the definition of â€œhandle,â€ as used in their \r\n  respective contracts, is limited to selling or distributing a competing grill, \r\n  not planning or developing a competing grill.Â  We agree.\r\nWe conclude under the facts and circumstances presented in this case the term \r\n  â€œhandle,â€ as used in the respective contracts, is not ambiguous.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the trial court erred in not ruling as a matter of law that â€œhandleâ€ means â€œsell \r\n  or distribute.â€Â  See South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v. \r\n  Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 550 S.E.2d 299 (2001) (whether contract \r\n  is ambiguous initially is question of law for the court); Conner v. Alvarez, \r\n  285 S.C. 97, 328 S.E.2d 334 (1985) (when contract is plain and capable of legal \r\n  construction, the language itself determines the full force and effect of the \r\n  document); Myrtle Beach Lumber Co., Inc. v. Willoughby, 276 S.C. 3, 274 \r\n  S.E.2d 423 (1981) (any ambiguity in written contract should be construed liberally \r\n  and most strongly in favor of the party who did not write or prepare the contract \r\n  and is not responsible for its ambiguity; any uncertainty as to its meaning \r\n  should be resolved against the party who prepared the contract or is responsible \r\n  for its wording).\r\nRasmussen in its contract agreed not to â€œhandle,â€ i.e., sell or distribute, \r\n  a competing grill, but remained free to plan and develop its own grill.Â  The \r\n  Representativesâ€™ contracts are drafted more broadly, affirmatively providing \r\n  they were â€œfree to handle other products or lines.â€Â  Thus, the Representatives \r\n  were free to assist in the planning and development of Rasmussenâ€™s new grill \r\n  while distributing TECâ€™s grill. These provisions allowed both Rasmussen and \r\n  the Representatives to engage in the above-described acts without breaching \r\n  their respective contracts with TEC.\r\nThe contracts did not prohibit Rasmussen and the Representatives from engaging \r\n  in preparatory acts necessary to develop a competing gas grill in the future.Â  \r\n  Rasmussen and the Representatives did not promote, market, sell, or distribute \r\n  Rasmussenâ€™s new grill to the public until after the termination of their contracts \r\n  with TEC; therefore, none of the defendant companies breached their contracts.\r\nWith regard to Rasmussenâ€™s contract, this interpretation of the term â€œhandleâ€ \r\n  is further buttressed by the fact the contract specifically focused on retail \r\n  price levels by prohibiting Rasmussen from handling â€œconsumer gas grills for \r\n  which the suggested retail prices for the highest priced unit exceed 70 percent \r\n  of the suggested retail for TECâ€™s lowest priced unit.â€Â  The focus on price indicates \r\n  the parties intended for this clause to prevent Rasmussen from selling or distributing \r\n  competing gas grills, not from planning the development and manufacture of a \r\n  grill that might be sold in the future when Rasmussen would be contractually \r\n  free to do so.\r\nOur resolution of this liability issue necessarily means the other causes of \r\n  actions asserted by TEC must fail.Â  If the Representatives did not commit a \r\n  breach of contract, they cannot be found to have committed a breach of contract \r\n  accompanied by a fraudulent act.Â  Similarly, if the above-described acts were \r\n  allowed under the partiesâ€™ contracts, those same acts in this instance cannot \r\n  be deemed to constitute unfair or deceptive acts under the UTPA.Â  We do not \r\n  conclude that in every case a UTPA action must fail when an accompanying breach \r\n  of contract action fails.Â  However, such a conclusion is appropriate under the \r\n  facts and circumstances presented in this case.\r\nChief Justice Toal, dissenting, agrees the Representatives did not breach their \r\n  contract with TEC under the plain terms of the contract.Â  The chief justice \r\n  believes Rasmussen, by its actions, breached the implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing contained in every contract and would uphold damages awarded \r\n  against it.Â  We certainly agree this covenant is an inherent part of every contract, \r\n  regardless of whether it is explicitly set forth or embraced by the parties \r\n  in a written document or verbal agreement.Â  See Adams v. G.J. Creel \r\n  and Sons, Inc., 320 S.C. 274, 277, 465 S.E.2d 84, 85 (1995) (â€œ[t]here exists \r\n  in every contract an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealingâ€); Tharpe \r\n  v. G.E. Moore Co., 254 S.C. 196, 174 S.E.2d 397 (1970) (same).Â  â€œHowever, \r\n  there is no breach of an implied covenant of good faith where a party to a contract \r\n  has done what provisions of the contract expressly gave him the right to do.â€Â  \r\n  Adams, 320 S.C. at 277, 465 S.E.2d at 85.Â  Under the facts of this case, \r\n  we do not believe the implied covenant should apply in a manner that defeats \r\n  the proper interpretation of an important contractual term.Â  Rasmussen acted \r\n  in good faith and dealt fairly with TEC by refraining from selling or distributing \r\n  its competing grill, as required by its contract, until termination of that \r\n  contract.Â  See also RoTec Services, Inc. v. Encompass Services, Inc., \r\n  359 S.C. 467, 597Â  S.E.2d 881 (Ct. App. 2004) (implied covenant of good faith \r\n  and fair dealing is not an independent cause of action separate from the claim \r\n  for breach of contract).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe conclude that neither Rasmussen nor the Representatives breached their respective \r\n  contracts with TEC.Â  This result makes it unnecessary to address the remaining \r\n  issues presented by Rasmussen, the Representatives, or TEC.Â  We reverse the \r\n  juryâ€™s verdict and remand this matter to the circuit court for entry of judgment \r\n  in accordance with this opinion.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate \r\n  opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I agree with the majority \r\n  that the Representatives -- Southeastern Marketing Group, LLC, Vari-Fuel Specialty \r\n  Products, Inc., and Champion Marketing Group -- did not breach their contract \r\n  with TEC because the contractual provision stating that the Representatives \r\n  were â€œfree to handle other products or linesâ€ did not prohibit the Representativesâ€™ \r\n  conduct in question.Â  \r\nI disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that \r\n  Rasmussen did not breach its exclusive distributorship contract with TEC.Â  As \r\n  TECâ€™s exclusive distributor for California, Rasmussen was contractually forbidden \r\n  to concurrently and surreptitiously design, construct, test, and contract with \r\n  a third party to produce its own high-end, infrared grill.Â  This activity constituted \r\n  a clear breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing that is embedded \r\n  in every contract.Â  Since I would find Rasmussen in breach of its exclusive \r\n  distributorship contract with TEC, I would affirm the damages verdict as to \r\n  Rasmussen only.Â  I respectfully dissent.Â Â  \r\nFactual Background\r\nTEC manufactures high-end infrared grills, which sell for a minimum retail \r\n  price of $1,500.Â  TECâ€™s grill heats food using infrared radiation, which is \r\n  energy efficient and does not dry out food as rapidly as a convection or conduction \r\n  grill. [3] Â Â  \r\nIn May 1999, Rasmussenâ€™s president and his son came to Columbia to express \r\n  their interest in distributing TECâ€™s infrared grill in California. [4]  Â Â Â As a result of the meeting, \r\n  TEC and Rasmussen entered into the exclusive distributor agreement covering \r\n  the state of California. \r\nThe Exclusive Distributorship Contract\r\nThe Rasmussen-TEC agreement contains various key provisions:\r\n \r\n   \r\n    (1) Rasmussen â€œis to become the wholesale distributor of TECâ€™s consumer \r\n      Infra-red gas grills, accessories and replacement parts for the state of \r\n      Californiaâ€¦.â€\r\n    (2) Rasmussen â€œwill then be the sole distributor for the wholesale distribution \r\n      of the grills in California.Â  [Rasmussen] will use its best efforts to develop \r\n      a retail dealership system within the state for the sale of TEC grills.â€\r\n    (3) â€œIn accepting the benefits and the responsibilities of being the exclusive \r\n      wholesale distributor for the grills, [Rasmussen] understands that there \r\n      are some limits beyond which TEC may not go in limiting dealers or distributors \r\n      from outside the state of California from sending grills into the state.â€Â  \r\n    \r\n    (4) Rasmussen â€œwill diligently promote the sale of TEC Consumer grills \r\n      and accessories.â€\r\n    (5) Rasmussen â€œwill handle no other consumer gas grills for which \r\n      the manufacturerâ€™s suggested retail prices for the highest price unit exceed \r\n      70 percent of the suggested retail for TECâ€™s lowest priced unit.â€\r\n    (6)Â  â€œThe prices at which Consumer grills and related components will be \r\n      sold to Distributor will be 48.95 percent of the suggested retail price \r\n      published by TEC from time to time.â€\r\n    (7)Â  â€œThis Agreement will terminate six months after either party gives \r\n      to the other party written notice of a desire to terminate this Agreement, \r\n      or if both parties agree in writing.â€\r\n  \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  Under this agreement, Rasmussen obtained \r\n  two major benefits: (1) the exclusive right to distribute high-end, TEC infrared \r\n  grills in California and (2) the right to purchase the grills at less than 50% \r\n  of the retail price.Â  In return, Rasmussen agreed to (1) diligently promote \r\n  the infrared grills, (2) use its â€œbest effortsâ€ to establish a retail dealership \r\n  network within California, and (3) refrain from â€œhandlingâ€ other high-end consumer \r\n  gas grills.Â  \r\nWithin the first four months of signing the contract, Rasmussen ordered $400,000 \r\n  worth of TEC grills, but soon thereafter, Rasmussenâ€™s purchases dissipated.Â  \r\n\r\nAt a Baltimore trade show in March 2000, Rasmussen approached \r\n  ESP-2000, a California manufacturer, to discuss ESP-2000â€™s interest in manufacturing \r\n  a high-end, infrared grill. [5] Â  Rasmussen and ESP-2000 had a follow-up meeting in California, \r\n  and by May 2000, they had a working prototype of the new infrared grill.  \r\n  [6] Â  One month later, the two parties signed a contract whereby ESP-2000 \r\n  would manufacture up to 6,000 high-end, infrared grills per year for $200,000.Â  \r\n\r\nConcurrently, Rasmussen contacted the three TEC Representatives to discuss \r\n  whether they would be interested in selling Rasmussenâ€™s new grill, and in July \r\n  2000, the Representatives went to California for a two-day meeting where they \r\n  tested the grill, suggested improvements for the grill, and developed marketing \r\n  and pricing strategies for the grill.\r\nTEC first heard rumors of Rasmussenâ€™s â€œSolaireâ€ grill in August 2000, and on \r\n  September 8, 2000, TEC and Rasmussen mutually agreed to terminate the exclusive \r\n  distributorship agreement. [7] Â  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nâ€œ[E]very contract contains an implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing \r\n  in its performance and enforcement.â€Â  Arthur L.

Zurich American Ins. \r\n  Co., 355 S.C. 614, 617-618, 586 S.E.2d 586, 588 (2003) (recognizing that \r\n  an insurer owes the insured the duty of good faith and fair dealing, which arises \r\n  from the insurance contract). \r\n \r\n  \r\n    The duty [of good faith and fair dealing] embraces, among other things, \r\n      an implied obligation that neither party shall do anything to injure or \r\n      destroy the right of the other party to receive the benefits of the agreement.Â  \r\n    \r\n    â€¦\r\n    [A] party who â€œevades the spirit of the contract, willfully renders imperfect \r\n      performance, or interferes with performance by the other party, â€¦ may be \r\n      liable for breach of the implied obligation of good faith and fair dealing.â€ \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSamuel Williston, A Treatise on the Law of Contracts \r\n  vol. 23 Â§ 63:22, 506-508 (4th ed., West 2003) (citation omitted).\r\nRasmussenâ€™s surreptitious efforts to develop, test, market, \r\n  and most importantly, contract with a third party to build 6,000 high-end, \r\n  infrared grills, while under an exclusive distributorship agreement to promote \r\n  a competing product, violate the â€œspirit of the contractâ€ and clearly breach \r\n  the covenant of good faith and fair dealing.Â  Rasmussenâ€™s calculated plan to \r\n  roll out 6,000 units of the high-end grill completely interferes with the contractual \r\n  benefit that TEC was entitled to: an exclusive distributorâ€™s diligent effort \r\n  to promote TECâ€™s infrared grill.  [8] Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would find Rasmussen in breach of the exclusive \r\n  dealership contract and would affirm the judgment of damages against Rasmussen \r\n  only. \r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Â  TEC, in a letter dated August 24, 2000, notified Rasmussen \r\n    it was giving a â€œsix-month notice of terminationâ€ as allowed in the partiesâ€™ \r\n    contract and offered to negotiate an earlier termination date.Â  Rasmussen, \r\n    in a letter dated September 8, 2000, agreed to terminate the contract immediately.Â  \r\n    Neither party explicitly reserved or abandoned any rights relating to alleged \r\n    breaches of contract prior to the termination date.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  S.C.
