Myrtle Beach, for Petitioners.\r\nJ. Jackson Thomas and Mark A. Bruntey, both of Thompson &amp; Henry, P.A., \r\n  of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  Baldwin Construction Company (respondent) filed \r\n  suit against the Grahams (petitioners).  Petitioners, after initially responding \r\n  pro se, retained counsel and moved to be allowed to file an amended \r\n  answer, set-offs, and counterclaims.  In connection with this motion, counsel \r\n  also moved for a jury trial.  The motions were denied.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed this denial in an unpublished opinion.  Baldwin Const. Co., Inc. \r\n  v. Graham, Op. No. 2002-UP-509 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 30, 2002).  Petitioners \r\n  sought a writ of certiorari, which we granted.  We vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion because the interlocutory order is not immediately appealable.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 2, 1998, respondent filed suit against petitioners alleging causes \r\n  of action for foreclosure of a mechanicâ€™s lien, breach of contract, and quantum \r\n  meruit.  Petitioners wrote respondent a letter dated September 30, 1998, which \r\n  was construed by respondent as a pro se answer to the summons \r\n  and complaint.  Petitioners did not appear for scheduled depositions that were \r\n  to take place in December 1998. Respondent moved for sanctions pursuant to Rule \r\n  37, SCRCP.  The petitioners were sanctioned in May 1999.  Petitioners submitted \r\n  to the taking of their depositions in June 1999, under threat of further sanctions.  \r\n\r\nPetitioners subsequently retained counsel and on October 1, 1999, their attorney \r\n  moved to permit filing of an amended answer, set-offs, and counterclaims.  In \r\n  connection with this motion, counsel also moved for a jury trial.  The motions \r\n  were denied.  In his order denying petitionersâ€™ motions, the judge stated: \r\n\r\nThe [petitionersâ€™] motions come over a year after the filing of the Summons \r\n  and Complaint, after the failure of the [petitioners] to cooperate in discovery, \r\n  after their sanction for such failure, and after their depositions were taken \r\n  in the case only under threat of further sanction.  Moreover, the requested \r\n  pleading would assert counter-claims and set-offs on multiple theories not previously \r\n  at issue, and would entitle [petitioners] to trial by jury on certain of the \r\n  claims when request for jury trial had not been previously made.  The interjection \r\n  of the new matter would require additional discovery by [respondent] including \r\n  the re-deposing of the [petitioners].  \r\nUnder the circumstances, I find the relief requested by [petitioners] \r\n  to be unduly prejudicial to the [respondent], and that the [petitioners] simply \r\n  are not entitled, as a matter of the Courtâ€™s discretion to substantially change \r\n  the parameters and issues involved in the lawsuit at this late date.  \r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nIs an order denying a motion to amend an answer directly appealable?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  held the order denying the motion to amend an answer was immediately appealable.  \r\n  We disagree.  \r\nIn this case, petitioners requested \r\n  a jury trial based on allegations in their proposed amended answer.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals stated that petitionersâ€™ â€œamended answer asserted several \r\n  counterclaims and set-offs including a cause of action for breach of contract, \r\n  which is an action at law and petitioners were therefore entitled to a jury \r\n  trial as a matter of right pursuant to their amended answer.â€ (emphasis \r\n  supplied).  The Court of Appeals stated that â€œin order to preserve their right \r\n  to a jury trial, [petitioners were] required to immediately appeal the order \r\n  denying the motion to amend their answer and request for a jury trial based \r\n  on the claims asserted in this amended answer.â€ (emphasis supplied).  However, \r\n  this reasoning â€œputs the cart before the horse.â€ Instead of deciding whether \r\n  an order denying a motion to amend an answer is appealable, the Court of Appeals \r\n  focused on whether the not-yet-amended answer would ultimately lead to a jury \r\n  trial.  \r\nâ€œAbsent some specialized statute, \r\n  determining if an interlocutory order is immediately appealable depends on whether \r\n  the order falls within one of the several categories of appealable judgments, \r\n  decrees, or orders listed in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976 &amp; Supp. [2002]).â€ \r\n  Woodard v. Westvaco Corp., 319 S.C. 240, 242, 460 S.E.2d 392, 393 (1995), \r\n  overruled on other grounds Sabb v. South Carolina State University, \r\n  350 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).  We decide, then, whether an order denying \r\n  a motion to amend an answer is immediately appealable under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  14-3-330.  \r\nUnder Section 14-3-330 (2), this Court may â€œreview upon appeal (2) [a]n order \r\n  affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect \r\n  determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be \r\n  taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes \r\n  out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action.â€  The only \r\n  subsection that might conceivably be implicated by the order denying petitionersâ€™ \r\n  request to be allowed to file an amended answer is subsection (c).  In Jefferson \r\n  v. Geneâ€™s Used Cars, Inc., 295 S.C. 317, 368 S.E.2d 456 (1988), this Court \r\n  held that an order denying a partyâ€™s motion to file a late answer was a not \r\n  directly appealable.  The Court reached this conclusion because the trial judge \r\n  did not rule on the substantive contents of the answer, nor did the order strike \r\n  a pleading, but refused to allow its filing.  This case is similar, as \r\n  the judge did not strike a pleading but refused to allow its filing.  Petitioners \r\n  have not â€œarrived at the end of the roadâ€ and will be able to appeal the decision \r\n  after the trial is finished. Mid-State Distributors, Inc. v. Century Importers, \r\n  Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 426 S.E.2d 777 (1993).  \r\nWe dismiss the appeal without prejudice to a right to appeal from \r\n  a final judgment.  The decision of the Court of Appeals is \r\nVACATED.   \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Mark Alexander Pearson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-01-29-01","description":"Reinstatement to the practice of law pursuant to Rule 32, RLDE.","date":"2004-02-02","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Mark Alexander Pearson,&nbsp;Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn August 25, 2003, Respondent was suspended for a \r\n  period of 146 days.Â  He has now filed an affidavit requesting reinstatement \r\n  pursuant to Rule 32, of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement contained \r\n  in Rule 413, SCACR.Â   \r\nThe request is granted and he is hereby reinstated \r\n  to the practice of law in this state.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp;\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       JEAN H.

In 1999, this \r\n  Court reversed and remanded the matter in order for the PSC to set forth sufficient \r\n  evidentiary detail supporting its conclusions.  Kiawah Prop. Owners Group \r\n  v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 338 S.C. 92, 525 S.E.2d 863 (1999) (KPOG I).  \r\n  On remand, the PSC affirmed its prior holdings.  The circuit court affirmed, \r\n  finding the PSCâ€™s order sufficiently complied with this Courtâ€™s mandate.  We \r\n  affirm. \r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThe pertinent facts are set forth in \r\nKPOG 1: \r\n\r\n  Kiawah Island Utility, Inc. (the \r\n    Utility) provides water and sewer service to the residents of Kiawah Island.  \r\n    The Utility is wholly owned by Kiawah Resort Associates (the Developer).  \r\n    In July of 1996, the Utility applied to the Public Service Commission for \r\n    an increase in its existing rates and charges for water and sewer service.  \r\n    The appellant, Kiawah Property Owners Group as well as the consumer advocate \r\n    . . . intervened in opposition to the increase and participated in the Commission's \r\n    proceedings.\r\n  Prior to the 1996 adjudication, \r\n    the rates and charges of the Utility had been approved by the PSC in 1992.  \r\n    The Utility sought to increase its operating margin by 5.43%.  After the hearings, \r\n    the PSC issued an order granting the Utility an increase of only 3.55%. . \r\n    . . .  The circuit court issued its order upholding the PSC.   \r\n\r\n338 S.C. at 94, 525 S.E.2d at 864.  \r\nIn KPOG 1, we found the PSC had failed to set forth a sufficient evidentiary \r\nbasis for its determinations.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n   \r\n    1.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Does the PSC have \r\n      jurisdiction over Developer?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    2.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PSC properly \r\n      refuse to either rescind land leases between Developer and Utility, or require \r\n      Developer to donate the land in question to Utility?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    3.\r\n    Did the PSC properly \r\n      refuse to require Developer to reimburse Utility for expenditures Owners \r\n      claim were attributable to Developer?\r\n  \r\n   \r\n    4.&nbsp;\r\n    Should â€œbuilding \r\n      incentiveâ€ paid to Developer have been included as revenue to Utility?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    5.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the PSC properly \r\n      refuse to invalidate the cross-collateral and cross-default provisions of \r\n      Utilityâ€™s 1995 loan agreement with NationsBank?\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n  STANDARD OF REVIEW [1]    \r\n\r\nThis Court applies a deferential \r\n  standard in reviewing decisions by the PSC and will affirm those decisions if \r\n  supported by substantial evidence.  Total Envtl. Solutions, Inc. v. South \r\n  Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 351 S.C. 175, 568 S.E.2d 365 (2002); Heater \r\n  of Seabrook, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of South Carolina, 324 S.C. 56, 478 \r\n  S.E.2d 826 (1996).  We will not substitute our judgment for that of the PSC \r\n  where there is room for a difference of intelligent opinion.  Id.  The \r\n  PSC's findings are presumptively correct, requiring the party challenging an \r\n  order to show the decision is &quot;clearly erroneous in view of the substantial \r\n  evidence on the whole record.&quot;  Id.  \r\nNormally, the expenses of a Utility \r\n  are presumed to be reasonable when incurred in good faith.  KPOG I, 338 \r\n  S.C. at 95, 525 S.E.2d at 864, citing Hamm v. South Carolina Pub. \r\n  Serv. Comm'n, 309 S.C. 282, 422 S.E.2d 110 (1992).  However, when payments \r\n  are made to an affiliate, a mere showing of actual payment does not establish \r\n  a prima facie case of reasonableness.  Hilton Head Plantation Utilities, \r\n  Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 312 S.C. 448, 451, 441 S.E.2d 321, 323 (1994).  \r\n  The PSC must review and analyze intercompany dealings and determine if they \r\n  are reasonable; if there is an absence of data and information from which the \r\n  reasonableness and propriety of the services rendered and the reasonable cost \r\n  of rendering such services can be ascertained, the allowance is properly refused.  \r\n  Id.   \r\n1.  PSC JURISDICTION \r\n  OVER DEVELOPER \r\nOwners assert that since Utility \r\n  is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Developer, Developer should have a) donated \r\n  numerous items to it (such as fire hydrants, transmission/distribution lines), \r\n  or b) not have charged Utility for other items (such as management fees), and \r\n  c) that Developer should be required to reimburse Utility for any expenses it \r\n  claims were unreasonable. [2]   We agree with the PSC that it simply does not have authority \r\n  to order the relief requested.             \r\n  \r\nIn its order on rehearing, the PSC \r\n  ruled that since it had jurisdiction only over public utilities, it did \r\n  not have authority to â€œorder an affiliate company to pay back funds to a utility. \r\n  . . .  The Commissionâ€™s authority rests solely over public utilities themselves.  \r\n  Therefore, we are limited to granting in whole or in part, or denying proposed \r\n  adjustments in utility rate cases, based on our view of the evidence. . .â€  \r\n            \r\nThe statute conferring authority \r\n  on the PSC, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-210 (1976), states: \r\n\r\n  The [PSC] is . . . vested with \r\n    power and jurisdiction to supervise and regulate the rates and service of \r\n    every public utility in this State, together with the power, after \r\n    hearing, to ascertain and fix such just and reasonable standards, classifications, \r\n    regulations, practices and measurements of service to be furnished, imposed, \r\n    observed and followed by every public utility in this State and the State \r\n    hereby asserts its rights to regulate the rates and services of every &quot;public \r\n    utility&quot; as herein defined.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).  Notwithstanding \r\n  Developer is not a â€œpublic utility,â€ [3]  Owners assert PSC does, in fact, have jurisdiction \r\n  over Developer, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-20 (1976).  Section 58-5-20 \r\n  provides: \r\n\r\n  Any corporation or person not engaged \r\n    in business exclusively as a public utility shall be governed by the provisions \r\n    of Articles 1, 3 and 5 of this chapter in respect only of the public utility \r\n    owned, leased, operated or managed by it or him and not in respect to any \r\n    other business or pursuit.\r\n\r\nWe \r\n  find Â§ 58-5-20 was simply intended to subject the provider to regulation by \r\n  the PSC as a utility with respect to its activities in the provision of utility \r\n  services; we do not believe it was intended, as Owners suggest, as authority \r\n  for PSC to order a separate entity to donate land to its subsidiary, to rescind \r\n  its land leases, to make payments to the Utility for certain assets, to donate \r\n  fire hydrants to the utility, etc.  \r\nMoreover, we find it is simply unnecessary \r\n  for PSC to exercise direct jurisdiction over Developer.  To the extent a transaction \r\n  is not done at â€œarms-length,â€ or is found by the PSC to be unreasonable,  it \r\n  is properly excluded from the rate-base, thereby ensuring that improper or unreasonable \r\n  transaction costs are not passed on to rate-payers.  See generally  Lee \r\n  R. Russ, Annotation, Amount Paid By Public Utility to Affiliate for Goods \r\n  or Services as Includable in Utilityâ€™s Rate Base and Operating Expenses in Rate \r\n  Proceeding, 16 A.L.R. 4th 454 (1982)(recognizing public service \r\n  commissions may scrutinize transactions between affiliates and adjust operating \r\n  expenses accordingly).  In fact, the PSC did exclude numerous items and amounts \r\n  in the present case, [4]  and granted an increase to Utilityâ€™s operating \r\n  margin of only 3.55%, rather than the 5.43% operating margin requested.  The \r\n  PSC properly declined to exercise jurisdiction over Developer.  \r\n2.  LAND LEASES\r\nPursuant \r\n  to 23 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 103-541:\r\n\r\n  No utility shall execute or enter \r\n    into any agreement or contract with any person, firm, partnership, or corporation \r\n    or any agency of the Federal, State or local government which would impact, \r\n    pertain to, or effect said utility's fitness, willingness, or ability to provide \r\n    sewer service, including but not limited to the collection or treatment of \r\n    said sewerage, without first submitting said contract in form to the Commission \r\n    and obtaining approval of the Commission.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis \r\n  supplied).  It is undisputed that Utility entered into two land leases with \r\n  Developer without obtaining prior PSC approval.  One of the leases is for a \r\n  â€œdown island storage facilityâ€ used for a one million gallon above ground storage \r\n  tank for potable water, and the other is land next to Utilityâ€™s wastewater treatment \r\n  plant on which Utility built a holding pond for treated effluent.  Although \r\n  the PSC ruled the better practice would be for Utility to have prior approval \r\n  of the lease agreements, it found the leased property was useful to, and used \r\n  by, Utility.  We agree. \r\nDeveloper leased the land for the \r\n  holding pond to Utility for an annual rental of $66,000.  PSC approved a $33,000 \r\n  annual expense for the leased premises for the holding pond.  In its order, \r\n  the PSC cited the testimony of Utilityâ€™s engineer, Mr. Bohannon, which indicated \r\n  that Utility needed additional storage capacity for treated effluent to serve \r\n  the needs of all of its customers.  The PSC also cited the testimony of Utilityâ€™s \r\n  CEO, Mr. Clarkson, to the effect that alternatives for increasing storage capacity \r\n  would have cost much more money, that Utility would have had a hard time borrowing \r\n  sufficient funds from a bank to purchase the property, and that an independent \r\n  appraisal firm had determined the fair market rental value for the property.  \r\n  Owners do not contest the evidence cited by PSC in support of its decision; \r\n  they simply contend that an independent utility would not have entered the leases.  \r\n  However, this Court refrains from substituting its judgment for that of the \r\n  PSC where there is room for a difference of intelligent opinion.  Heater \r\n  of Seabrook, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n of South Carolina, supra.  \r\n  \r\nAs noted by the PSC, Owners have \r\n  at no time challenged the reasonable rental value of the property, nor did they \r\n  present any evidence that the fair rental value is less than that allotted by \r\n  PSC.  Owners also did not challenge that an additional holding cell for treated \r\n  effluent was necessary.  Accordingly, as there is evidence supporting PSCâ€™s \r\n  decision that the land leases were both necessary and reasonable, its decision \r\n  is affirmed. [5] \r\n3.  UNREASONABLE \r\n  EXPENDITURES\r\nOwners next assert the trial court \r\n  should have required Developer to reimburse Utility for numerous expenditures \r\n  it claims were attributable to Developer rather than Utility.  As noted in Issue \r\n  1 above, the PSC simply does not have authority to require Developer to reimburse \r\n  Utility for these items.  Accordingly, we need not address the merits of these \r\n  issues.\r\nMoreover, we find substantial evidence \r\n  supports the PSCâ€™s determination that each of the challenged expenditures was \r\n  reasonable and attributable to Utility.  Heater of Seabrook, supra.    \r\n  \r\n4.  BUILDING INCENTIVE/AVAILABILITY \r\n  FEES\r\nOwners next assert the PSC erred \r\n  in failing to attribute â€œbuilding incentive feesâ€ collected by Developer as \r\n  a contribution in aid of construction to Utility.  We disagree.\r\n In its 1992 Order, Order No. 92-1030, \r\n  the PSC ruled that â€œavailability feesâ€ collected by Developer \r\n  [6]  did not constitute any type of revenue to the Utility and found they \r\n  were more appropriately recognized as a contribution in aid of construction, \r\n  such that rate base was reduced accordingly.  \r\nIn the present case, Owners argued \r\n  that the current â€œbuilding incentive feesâ€ charged by Developer should be treated \r\n  as a contribution in aid of construction and an adjustment of $530,098 made.  \r\n  The PSC ruled that 1.6 million dollars had already been deducted from Utilityâ€™s \r\n  rate base in recognition of the previously paid availability fees.  It then \r\n  found that the current â€œbuilding incentive feesâ€ charged by Developer are not \r\n  the same as the â€œavailability feesâ€ imposed prior to 1991.  The PSC stated, \r\n  â€œTo encourage construction of houses on the unimproved lots that it sells, the \r\n  developer. . . assesses a building incentive fee against the owners of undeveloped \r\n  lots.  This fee is paid directly to [Developer].  The building incentive fee \r\n  is entirely different from the availability fees that were once (but no longer) \r\n  charged by [Developer] for infrastructure that included water and sewer lines.â€  \r\n  \r\nThe PSC relied upon the testimony \r\n  of Mr. Clarkson, Utilityâ€™s CEO, that the prior availability fees paid to it \r\n  had been treated as a contribution in aid of construction as ordered, and that \r\n  the PSCâ€™s auditor had made the same adjustment.  Utility also presented proof \r\n  to the PSC that no availability fees had been collected since 1991, that the \r\n  Utility did not receive any monies from the building incentive fees currently \r\n  collected by Developer, and that none of these fees related to Utilityâ€™s provision \r\n  of water and sewer service on the island.  \r\nGiven the abundant evidence that \r\n  the current â€œbuilding incentiveâ€ fees do not benefit Utility, we find the PSC \r\n  properly refused to attribute them to Utility.  See Total Envtl. Solutions \r\n  v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 351 S.C. 175, 182, 568 S.E.2d 365, 369 (2002)(PSC \r\n  lacks jurisdiction to regulate availability fees where no evidence exists Utility \r\n  collected or directly benefited from them).  \r\n 5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n    CROSS-COLLATERAL/DEFAULT LOAN PROVISIONS\r\nFinally, Owners challenge certain \r\n  loan provisions Utility has with NationsBank (now Bank of America).  \r\nUtility and Developer had loan agreements \r\n  with NationsBank, and the agreements have as collateral the assets of both Developer \r\n  and Utility.  They also specify that a default by either of the entities constitutes \r\n  a default by the other.  The PSC noted that â€œ[t]he cross-collateralization required \r\n  by NationsBank has benefited the Utility and has never had a negative effect.â€  \r\n  Id.  Ownersâ€™ reply brief acknowledges this statement is presently true, \r\n  but contends the loan agreements were nonetheless commercially unreasonable \r\n  and may affect Utilityâ€™s customers in the future.  \r\nThis Court is obligated to inquire \r\n  in every action whether a justiciable controversy exists in a matter.  Treatment \r\n  and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002); Byrd v. \r\n  Irmo High School, 321 S.C. 426, 468 S.E.2d 861 (1996).  &quot;A justiciable \r\n  controversy is a real and substantial controversy which is ripe and appropriate \r\n  for judicial determination, as distinguished from a contingent, hypothetical \r\n  or abstract dispute.&quot;  Pee Dee Elec. Coop., Inc. v. Carolina Power &amp; \r\n  Light Co., 279 S.C. 64, 66, 301 S.E.2d 761, 762 (1983).\r\nHere, it is patent there is no present, \r\n  justiciable controversy.  Owners assert only that the loan provisions may have \r\n  some negative impact in the future.  This is simply insufficient to warrant \r\n  this Courtâ€™s review.  Accordingly, the PSCâ€™s findings are affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the PSCâ€™s 2000 order sets \r\n  forth sufficient evidence on which to conclude its decision is supported by \r\n  substantial evidence.  Accordingly, the PSCâ€™s rulings are affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   As noted by this Court in KPOG I, supra, \r\n    the basis for most of Ownersâ€™ arguments on appeal is that â€œdue to the Developer's \r\n    control over the Utility, the Developer entered into deals with the Utility \r\n    that would result in greater profit to the Developer and higher rates for \r\n    the Utility's customers.  KPOG's position is that no independent utilities \r\n    would have entered into such deals with a developer because those deals were \r\n    bad for the Utility and the ratepayers.â€  338 S.C. at 97, 525 S.E.2d at 825, \r\n    n. 1.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   Initially, we agree with the PSC that these costs \r\n    are not being passed on to the ratepayers.  Further, to the extent the PSC \r\n    found that items were not justified or reasonable, they were excluded from \r\n    the rate base, such that they do not affect the rates set forth in the order.  \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]   The term â€œpublic utilityâ€ is defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-5-10(3) \r\n    (1976) to include the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n  every corporation and \r\n    person delivering natural gas distributed or transported by pipe, and every \r\n    corporation and person furnishing or supplying in any manner heat (other than \r\n    by means of electricity), water, sewerage collection, sewerage disposal, and \r\n    street railway service, or any of them, to the public, or any portion thereof, \r\n    for compensation;  provided, however, that a corporation or person furnishing, \r\n    supplying, marketing, and/or selling natural gas at the retail level for use \r\n    as a fuel in self-propelled vehicles shall not be considered a public utility \r\n    by virtue of the furnishing, supplying, marketing, and/or selling of such \r\n    natural gas.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   For example, Utility sought to include $100,000 \r\n    in management fees as direct labor costs and overhead; PSC found Utility had \r\n    not proved that amount, but instead had only justified $36,000 in management \r\n    fees.  PSC also denied Utilityâ€™s attempt to include $10,836 in rate case expenses \r\n    (incurred in seeking a rate increase), and $500,000 to plant for the construction \r\n    of the Eugenia Avenue Sewer Project.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]   We are troubled that PSC did not require compliance \r\n    with its own regulation.  However, we acknowledge that the Commission has \r\n    wide latitude to determine its methodology in rate-setting and there is no \r\n    abuse of discretion where substantial evidence supports the finding of a just \r\n    and reasonable rate.  See Heater of Seabrook, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. \r\n    Comm'n, 324 S.C. 56, 478 S.E.2d 826 (1996).  Given the evidence in support \r\n    of its decision, we simply cannot say the PSC committed an abuse of discretion.   \r\n    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]   The order recognizes that the â€œavailability feesâ€ \r\n    are now known as â€œbuilding incentiveâ€ fees.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25783","title":"Sloan v.

Sloan, brings this \r\n  action in the Courtâ€™s original jurisdiction against the Honorable Marshall Clement \r\n  Sanford, Jr., Governor of South Carolina.  Petitioner argues that because Governor \r\n  Sanford holds a Commission under the Government of the United States as an officer \r\n  in the Reserve of the Air Force, he does not meet the qualifications for Governor \r\n  set forth in the South Carolina Constitution, Article IV, Section 2.  Petitioner \r\n  requests we issue a declaratory judgment holding Governor Sanford ineligible \r\n  to serve as Governor because he holds a commission from the United States. For \r\n  the following reasons, we decline to so rule.\r\nFactual Background \r\nOn January 22, 2002, Governor Sanford was tendered an indefinite term appointment \r\n  as a Reserve of the Air Force in the grade of First Lieutenant, Medical Service \r\n  Corps.  On January 30, 2002, Governor Sanford signed an Oath of Office to serve \r\n  as a commissioned officer in the Air Force Reserve.  Approximately one year \r\n  later, on January 15, 2003, Governor Sanford was sworn in as Governor of South \r\n  Carolina.\r\n\r\n  Issues \r\n  \r\n     \r\n      I.&nbsp;\r\n      Does petitioner have standing to challenge respondentâ€™s \r\n        eligibility to serve as South Carolinaâ€™s governor?\r\n    \r\n     \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n      &nbsp; \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      \r\n        Is Governor Sanfordâ€™s holding of a commission in the Air Force Reserve \r\n          consistent with the eligibility requirements to be governor as set forth \r\n          in the South Carolina Constitution?\r\n        \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  I.\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends he has standing to bring this action as a citizen, resident, \r\n  taxpayer, and registered elector of the State of South Carolina.  We agree.\r\nAs a general rule, to have standing, a litigant must have a personal stake \r\n  in the subject matter of the litigation.  Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, \r\n  478 S.E.2d 841 (1996).  Additionally, a private person may not invoke the judicial \r\n  power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action unless he \r\n  has sustained, or is in immediate danger, of sustaining prejudice therefrom.  \r\n  Blandon v. Coleman, 285 S.C. 472, 330 S.E.2d 298 (1985).\r\nIn Culbertson v. Blatt, 194 S.C. 105, 9 S.E.2d 218 (1940), we held a \r\n  plaintiff, suing in his capacity as a citizen and taxpayer, lacked standing \r\n  to bring an action against several dual office-holding public officials.  Since \r\n  this Courtâ€™s ruling in Culbertson, we have recognized, under certain \r\n  circumstances, standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such \r\n  public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance.  Evins \r\n  v. Richland County Historic Preservation Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  876 (2000); Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999) \r\n  (citing Thompson v. South Carolina Commâ€™n on Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse, \r\n  267 S.C. 463, 229 S.E.2d 718 (1976)).   An appropriate balance between the competing \r\n  policy concerns underlying the issue of standing must be realized.  Citizens \r\n  must be afforded access to the judicial process to address alleged injustices.  \r\n  On the other hand, standing cannot be granted to every individual who has a \r\n  grievance against a public official.  Otherwise, public officials would be subject \r\n  to numerous lawsuits at the expense of both judicial economy and the freedom \r\n  from frivolous lawsuits.\r\nWe conclude Petitioner has public interest standing because of the importance \r\n  of the issue he raises.  Our conclusion is consistent with prior case law.  \r\n  In Baird, supra, doctors sued Charleston County to enjoin the \r\n  issuance of tax-exempt bonds to the Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) \r\n  for its purchase of St. Francis Hospital.  We held the issuance of the hospital \r\n  bonds clearly impacts a profound public interest, the public health and welfare.  \r\n  The eligibility of South Carolinaâ€™s governor to serve in this Stateâ€™s highest \r\n  elected office is at least as important as the proper funding for a clinical \r\n  hospital for MUSC.  Accordingly, we confer standing.\r\nII.\r\nPetitioner contends Governor Sanfordâ€™s holding of a commission in the Air Force \r\n  Reserve is inconsistent with the eligibility requirements to serve as Governor \r\n  as set forth in the South Carolina Constitution.  We disagree.\r\nThe last sentence of Article IV, Section 2 of the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  No person while Governor shall hold any office or other Commission (except \r\n    in the militia) under the authority of this State, or of any other power. [1] \r\n\r\nThe â€œmilitiaâ€ exception of Article IV, Section 2 includes within its ambit \r\n  Governor Sanfordâ€™s service in the Air Force Reserve, thereby rendering his military \r\n  commitment consistent with the South Carolina Constitution.  For the following \r\n  reasons, we conclude Article IV, Section 2 of the South Carolina Constitution \r\n  permits the Governor to serve in the military reserves.\r\nFirst, an historical analysis of the South Carolina â€œmilitiaâ€ reveals the term \r\n  refers to a fighting force of citizen-soldiers, as distinguished from, professional \r\n  soldiers.  The concept of the militia as consisting of a force of armed citizens, \r\n  available to serve in times of emergencies, dates back at least as far as the \r\n  rule of King Alfred the Great.  In varying degrees, the English model of the \r\n  militia was transported to North America with the settlement of the New World.  \r\n  In the first decade of settlement, the South Carolina militia was called upon \r\n  to make incursions against foreign enemies.  Later in the colonial period, the \r\n  militia served primarily as a local defense force.  See Theodore Harry \r\n  Jabbs, The South Carolina Colonial Militia 1663-1733 (1973) (unpublished Ph.D. \r\n  dissertation, University of North Carolina) (on file with South Caroliniana \r\n  Library). \r\nIn the Antebellum years, the â€œmilitiaâ€ continued to consist of citizen-soldiers, \r\n  called out in times of emergency, to quash insurrection or protect against invasion.  \r\n  The federal Uniform Militia Act of 1792, and enabling legislation passed by \r\n  South Carolinaâ€™s General Assembly, required most male citizens to serve in the \r\n  state militia.  While membership was required in the â€œlineâ€ militia, some of \r\n  these citizen-soldiers, formed semi-autonomous volunteer companies.  See \r\n  Michael Stauffer, Volunteer or Uniformed Companies in the Antebellum Militia:  \r\n  A Checklist of Identified Companies, 1790-1859, 88 South Carolina Historical \r\n  Magazine 108 (Jan. 1987).\r\nThe tradition of the volunteer component of the â€œmilitiaâ€ continues today.  \r\n  The framers of the 1778 Constitution could not have specifically envisioned \r\n  the â€œmilitiaâ€ would consist of the Air Force Reserve, which was officially designated \r\n  in 1948.  However, like the militias of yesteryear, the Air Force Reserve consists \r\n  of citizen-soldiers, who serve primarily on a part-time basis and who can be \r\n  called up to serve full time in emergencies.  We believe the history of the \r\n  South Carolina militia, a fighting force, which has consisted of the citizen-soldier, \r\n  encompasses the Air Force Reserve and supports our finding Governor Sanfordâ€™s \r\n  part-time military service is consistent with the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nSecond, a principal purpose of Article IV, Section 2 is to ensure the separation \r\n  of powers of the three branches of government, that is, to keep the executive, \r\n  judicial, and legislative branches of government separate.  In 1969, a committee \r\n  chaired by John C. West, presented a final report to then Governor McNair, after \r\n  the committee analyzed each section of the Stateâ€™s Constitution.  The minutes \r\n  of the West Commission Committee meetings confirm the dual-office holding purpose \r\n  of the provision. [2]   Proceedings of the Committee to Make a Study of the Constitution \r\n  of South Carolina (1895), August 25, 1966 - December 29, 1967 (Oct. 27, \r\n  1967) p. 66.  Although certain qualifications for Governor are included within \r\n  Article IV, Section 2, [3]  we do not believe these qualification provisions negate the \r\n  dual-office holding purpose and underlying separation of powers rationale intended \r\n  by the last sentence of Article IV, Section 2.   Because Governor Sanford is \r\n  not serving in two of the three branches of government by holding a commission \r\n  in the Air Force Reserve, he is not holding dual offices as envisioned by the \r\n  last sentence of Article IV, Section 2 and is not in violation of the South \r\n  Carolina Constitution. [4] \r\nPetitioner argues South Carolina has always required its Governorâ€™s singular, \r\n  devoted attention to the office and the Governorâ€™s military service could impede \r\n  the exercise of his gubernatorial duties.  Although we agree South Carolina \r\n  has always demanded its governorâ€™s loyalty, the historical context giving rise \r\n  to what is now the last sentence of Article IV, Section 2 indicates the framers \r\n  were more likely concerned the colonial governorsâ€™ loyalties would lie with \r\n  England and not with South Carolina. \r\n  [5]  \r\nThe framers of South Carolinaâ€™s early constitutions minimized the governorâ€™s \r\n  potential corruption and disloyalty to the State by preventing dual office holding \r\n  on the part of the Governor.  However, the framers, realizing temporary military \r\n  service would not subvert the governorsâ€™ obligations to the State, did not restrict \r\n  such service by the governors.  Likewise, we do not believe the Governorâ€™s service \r\n  in the Air Force Reserve today impinges on his allegiance to South Carolina.\r\nThird, state and federal policy support the performance of military service \r\n  by citizens.  The policy favoring military service by citizens is evidenced \r\n  in both state and federal legislation. \r\n  [6]   South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 8-7-30 (1986) provides â€œ[t]he absence of \r\n  any officer from his office or position caused by his being in the military \r\n  service shall not create a forfeiture of or vacancy in the office or position \r\n  to which such officer was elected or appointedâ€¦.â€  In the absence of a clear \r\n  intent on the part of our Constitutionâ€™s framers to exclude the Governor from \r\n  military service as a citizen-soldier, we decline to penalize him for his efforts.\r\nWe, therefore, conclude Governor Sanfordâ€™s service in the Air Force Reserve \r\n  is consistent with Article IV, Section 2 of the South Carolina Constitution.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The Constitution of 1778 \r\n    and all subsequent South Carolina Constitutions have contained a similar provision.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The following discussion \r\n    occurred:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Mr. Stoudemire (staff consultant):  All right.  â€œNo person while \r\n      Governor shall hold any office or other commission except in the militia \r\n      under authority of this State or any other power at one and the same.â€\r\n    \r\n    Mr. West:  I think we can approve that and I think itâ€™s a good thing.\r\n  \r\n  Mr. Stoudemire:  This is a standard dual office holding \r\n    provision designed to prevent dual office holding.\r\n  \r\n    \r\n  Mr. West:  You know several states donâ€™t have that dual office holding.\r\n    Mr. Stoudemire:  Mr. Chairman, is that last sentence agreed to, \r\n      then?\r\n    \r\n  Mr. West:  Itâ€™s agreed.  Yes, sir.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    Article IV, Section 2, contains, inter alia, age and residency requirements \r\n    for the governor.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] A number of courts interpreting \r\n    dual-office holding clauses have held such clauses do not prohibit holders \r\n    of state office from serving in the reserves or from being called upon to \r\n    temporarily defend the country.  See McCoy v. Board of Supervisors \r\n    of Los Angeles County, 114 P.2d 569 (1941) (the chief engineer of a California \r\n    county could also serve as a major in the Marine Corps Reserve); In re \r\n    Advisory Opinion to the Governor, 8 So.2d 26 (Fla. 1942) (the induction \r\n    of a sheriff into the United States Army does not disqualify the sheriff from \r\n    office);  Baker v.

Monson, 131 P.2d 794 (Utah \r\n    1942) (a state supreme court justice was not required to vacate his position \r\n    due to temporary military obligations); State ex rel. Thomas v. Wysong, \r\n    24 S.E.2d 463 (W.Va. 1943) (a Captain in the United States Army could also \r\n    serve as Attorney General).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] In March of 1776, South Carolina \r\n    became the first southern colony and the second of the thirteen to draft a \r\n    state constitution. Walter Edgar, South Carolina A History, 226 (Univ. \r\n    of South Carolina Press 1998).  Although the 1776 Constitution did not contain \r\n    the provision addressing the governorâ€™s service in the militia, the preamble \r\n    of the 1776 Constitution lends insight into the historical context under which \r\n    the framers of the 1778 Constitution were working. The preamble provides, \r\n    in part: \r\n\r\n\r\n  And whereas, instead of obtaining that justice, to which the Colonists \r\n    were and are of right entitled, the unnatural civil war into which they were \r\n    thus precipitated and are involved, hath been prosecuted with unremitted violence, \r\n    and the Governors and others bearing the royal commission in the colonies \r\n    have broken the most solemn promises and engagements, and violated every obligation \r\n    of honor, justice and humanity, have caused the persons of divers good people \r\n    to be seized and imprisoned, and their properties forcibly taken and detained, \r\n    or destroyed, without any crime or forfeitureâ€¦.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Additionally, Article XXXVI of the 1778 Constitution required all persons \r\n    in positions of trust to take an oath acknowledging South Carolina as a free \r\n    and sovereign state, and renouncing any allegiance to King George III.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] The federal Uniformed \r\n    Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act, 38 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 4301- 4333, \r\n    prohibits discrimination or acts of reprisal against an employee based on \r\n    the employeeâ€™s military service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of George Turner Perrow","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2004-02-05-01","description":"Petitioner is reinstated to the practice of law pursuant to Rule 33, RLDE.","date":"2004-02-09","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\nUntitled Document\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe Supreme Court \r\n  of South Carolina  \r\n\r\nIn the Matter of George \r\n  Turner Perrow, Petitioner.\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\n On August 27, 2001, petitioner was \r\n  indefinitely suspended from the practice of law, retroactive to August 2, 2000. \r\n  In the Matter of Perrow, 346 S.C. 515, 552 S.E.2d 295 (2001).

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and \r\nMichael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nIrby E. Walker, Jr., of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in \r\n  Rule 7(b), RLDE.  We accept the agreement and find a two year suspension from \r\n  the practice of law is the appropriate sanction.  The facts, as set forth in \r\n  the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Domestic Relations Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client in a domestic \r\n  relations matter.  During his representation of the client, respondent's wife \r\n  filed for divorce in North Carolina on several grounds, including adultery.  \r\n  During his representation of the client, and while his own divorce action was \r\n  pending, respondent was observed leaving the client's residence at 3:00 a.m. \r\n  on a night that the client had custody of her minor child.\r\n&nbsp;In addition, concurrent with his representation of the \r\n  client, respondent employed the client as a contract employee of his law firm.  \r\n  Respondent maintains he had an agreement with the client that she could work \r\n  off her attorney's fee debt by performing certain work related to respondent's \r\n  law firm.  However, respondent admits that the financial declaration he filed \r\n  on the client's behalf in her domestic action did not reflect that the client \r\n  derived any income as a result of working at respondent's office.\r\nIn response to inquiries by the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel, respondent denied having an extra-marital affair with the client and, \r\n  instead, affirmatively asserted the client was working on certain projects for \r\n  him, including acting as a process server, and he was at the client's home several \r\n  times at night.  Respondent maintains that while his conduct created an appearance \r\n  of impropriety, he did not engage in a sexual relationship with the client.\r\nRespondent provided Disciplinary Counsel with affidavits from both the client \r\n  and the client's mother indicating the client's mother was present at all times \r\n  that he and the client were together and that no illicit relationship took place \r\n  during the visits.  However, respondent concedes that the private investigator's \r\n  report indicated that the private investigator made multiple visits to the client's \r\n  home and did not see anyone else in the home on those occasions, nor did he \r\n  see any additional vehicles.  Respondent provided the same affidavits of his \r\n  client and the client's mother to the court handling his own divorce action.  \r\n  He denies the affidavits were false.\r\nII.                Fee Agreement Matter\r\nRespondent was retained, for a fee of $5,000, to represent \r\n  another client in a domestic matter.  The client also retained respondent to \r\n  represent him on a traffic violation and in a criminal domestic violence (CDV) \r\n  matter in which the client was the purported victim.  Respondent entered into \r\n  separate fee agreements with the client for representation in the traffic violation \r\n  matter and the CDV matter, both of which set forth an hourly rate of $150.\r\nRespondent provided the client with a billing statement \r\n  wherein respondent billed the client for 52 telephone calls, 3 after-hours telephone \r\n  calls, 6.5 hours of court and drive time, 10.25 hours for review, dictation \r\n  and appointment time, and 6 hours for review of client correspondence, at the \r\n  agreed upon rate of $150 per hour.  Thereafter, respondent provided the client \r\n  with another billing statement in which he billed the client for 7.25 hours \r\n  of professional services at the rate of $150 per hour.  Respondent filed an \r\n  affidavit, executed under oath and before a notary public, in family court in \r\n  an effort to recover attorney's fees for his representation of the client in \r\n  the domestic matter.  The affidavit stated respondent's billing rate was $175 \r\n  per hour.  Respondent maintains the hourly rate set forth in the affidavit was \r\n  an error and that he was unaware of the error at the time he executed and filed \r\n  the affidavit.  However, respondent admits that it is his obligation to submit \r\n  accurate affidavits to the court concerning his billing rate and that his submission \r\n  of the affidavit at issue violated the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\nIII.              Divorce Matter\r\n&nbsp;During the pendency of his divorce action, respondent made \r\n  multiple complaints to the North Carolina Department of Social Services against \r\n  both his former spouse and her parents.  He also sent, or caused to be sent, \r\n  certain facsimile transmissions to his former spouse's workplace.  Respondent \r\n  admits that he utilized his law firm's facsimile equipment and letterhead to \r\n  transmit various allegations concerning his former spouse's character to her \r\n  employer.\r\nThe court handling the divorce action issued an order stating \r\n  that &quot;[t]hroughout the course of the marriage [respondent was] verbally \r\n  abusive to [his former spouse] to the extent that the verbal abuse was overheard \r\n  by neighbors and seen by close friends of the parties.&quot;  The order also \r\n  states that respondent testified at the hearing &quot;that [he] had only been \r\n  at [an alleged paramour's] residence on other occasions to drop off and pick \r\n  up files.&quot;  The order then provides that &quot;[respondent] had approved \r\n  an Affidavit signed by [the alleged paramour] stating this fact. . . .&quot;, \r\n  and that he submitted the affidavit to the court.  Finally, the order finds \r\n  that [respondent] engaged in illicit sexual behavior with [the alleged paramour] \r\n  after the separation of the parties and that this relationship [was] shown by \r\n  a preponderance of the evidence.&quot;\r\nRespondent admits that in his response to Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel's inquiries, he maintained the North Carolina court found there to be \r\n  neither evidence of marital misconduct nor physical abuse on his part.  Respondent \r\n  maintains that at the time he made his initial response to Disciplinary Counsel, \r\n  he had not been served with an executed copy of the order in the divorce action.  \r\n  Respondent contends he was responding to the initial inquiry based on his memory \r\n  and his understanding of the court's ruling.  He also contends that he was responding \r\n  to the original allegations filed by his former spouse with the Office of Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel and that his understanding was that the complaint concerned evidence \r\n  of marital misconduct prior to the date of the parties' separation.\r\nIV.              Client File Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client in a matter \r\n  concerning a Social Security disability claim.  Respondent entered into a fee \r\n  agreement with the client.  The fee agreement stated the client would be billed \r\n  $150 per hour for respondent's services, $50 per hour for paralegal services, \r\n  plus all costs, whether the case was settled or went to trial.\r\nApproximately eleven months later, the client terminated \r\n  respondent as legal counsel and requested a copy of her file.  Respondent charged \r\n  the client $.33 per page to copy the file and, after receipt of payment, returned \r\n  the file to the client.\r\nIn his response to Disciplinary Counsel's inquiries, respondent \r\n  maintained that he was required by law to retain a copy of the client's file, \r\n  so a copy of the file was made and the client was billed at the rate of $.33 \r\n  per page.  Thereafter, respondent was asked to provide a copy of the fee agreement \r\n  he had entered into with the client and to explain his &quot;legal&quot; argument \r\n  or justification for charging a client for the copying of the client's file.  \r\n  Respondent failed to timely respond to the second request for information.  \r\n  In the untimely response he eventually filed, respondent failed to provide a \r\n  complete explanation as originally requested.  Instead, respondent provided \r\n  a copy of the fee agreement, which respondent now admits was an insufficient \r\n  legal basis for charging the client $.33 per page for the copying and return \r\n  of the client's file.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 3.3(a)(4) \r\n  (a lawyer shall not knowingly offer evidence that the lawyer knows to be false); \r\n  Rule 8.1(a) (a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter, shall \r\n  not knowingly make a false statement of material fact); Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer \r\n  in connection with a disciplinary matter shall not fail to disclose a fact necessary \r\n  to correct a misapprehension known by the lawyer to have arisen in the matter, \r\n  or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary \r\n  authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).\r\nRespondent also admits that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of the Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (violation of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (knowing failure to respond to a demand \r\n  or inquiry from a disciplinary authority); and Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging \r\n  in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the \r\n  courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe hereby accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for \r\n  two years.  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall \r\n  file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with \r\n  Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.

Keenan, of Myrtle Beach, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The facts, as set forth \r\n  in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent a client in a criminal matter.  Respondent \r\n  requested, and a date was set for, a bond reduction hearing.  However, prior \r\n  to the hearing, respondent resigned from his law firm and did not resume the \r\n  practice of law.  Respondent failed to notify his clients of the fact that he \r\n  was no longer practicing law, failed to take steps to protect the interests \r\n  of his clients, did not seek permission from the courts to withdraw as counsel \r\n  for his clients who had cases pending in court, nor did he seek to substitute \r\n  counsel, and failed to notify opposing counsel in his pending cases.  In the \r\n  case of his criminal client, respondent failed to appear at the bond reduction \r\n  hearing.\r\nRespondent maintained his own trust account at the firm where he was employed.  \r\n  Upon his resignation from the firm, respondent failed to reconcile the trust \r\n  account and failed to provide his employer with records pertaining to the account.  \r\n  Respondent failed to maintain adequate financial records and failed to conduct \r\n  monthly reconciliations of the trust account, resulting in an overdraft in the \r\n  amount of $81.50 upon his resignation.  Respondent has since replaced the funds.  \r\n\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act \r\n  with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) \r\n  (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a matter); \r\n  Rule 1.16(d) (upon termination of representation, a lawyer shall take steps \r\n  to the extent reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as \r\n  giving reasonable notice to the client, and allowing time for employment of \r\n  other counsel); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nRespondent also admits that by violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  he is subject to discipline under Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. \r\nFinally, respondent has violated Rule 417, SCACR, which sets forth the requirements \r\n  for financial recordkeeping.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly \r\n  reprimand respondent for his actions.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.
