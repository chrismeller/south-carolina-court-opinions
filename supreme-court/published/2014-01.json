Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina\r\n            C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of\r\n            Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            C. Kevin Miller, of Spartanburg, Pro Se.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office\r\nof Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment. We accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of\r\nlaw in this state, retroactive to March 7, 2012, the date of his interim suspension.\r\nSee In re Miller, 397 S.C. 7, 723 S.E.2d 211 (2012). The following matters are\r\naddressed in the Agreement.          Matter A\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to timely respond to an initial inquiry by ODC into this matter.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter B\r\n\r\nRespondent represented client in a workers' compensation case that was settled in\r\n2006. Client was to receive $91,000 from the settlement, but for personal reasons\r\n\nasked respondent to hold the funds and disburse them as requested. Respondent\r\nfailed to safeguard the funds, and although he made some disbursements, he did\r\nnot always make disbursements at the time or in the amount requested. In\r\naddition, the majority of the disbursements were made from respondent's operating\r\naccount rather than his trust account and at a time when the trust account in\r\nquestion had a balance of less than $75.\r\n\r\nIn 2010, an attorney representing client in another matter learned of the situation\r\nwith the workers' compensation settlement funds and, along with client, demanded\r\nan accounting from respondent. Respondent had not maintained a ledger for the\r\nfunds and was unable to provide a timely accounting. Eventually, respondent\r\ndetermined he owed client $45,000, and he issued a certified check to client in that\r\namount. After further review of his records, respondent determined he owed client\r\na balance of $4,400, and he issued another certified check to client in that amount.\r\nRespondent cannot establish the whereabouts of client's funds during the period\r\nthey were entrusted to respondent's care.\r\n\r\nFinally, respondent did not respond to the notice of investigation in this matter\r\nuntil after receiving a Treacy letter,1 and after being placed on interim suspension,\r\nfailed to respond to two additional requests for information.\r\n\r\n                                            Matter C\r\n\r\nIn early 2011, respondent closed a refinance transaction for client. Respondent\r\nwas to submit a payoff of $67,687.06 to client's former lender, but failed to do so.\r\nInstead, respondent used the funds for other purposes and took no action when\r\nclient advised him more than once that client was still receiving bills from his\r\nformer lender. When the former lender began foreclosure proceedings\r\napproximately six months after closing, client filed a complaint with the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct. Respondent then paid the outstanding balance\r\nwith funds he obtained from another source discussed below.\r\n\r\nRespondent initially informed ODC his failure to submit the payoff in a timely\r\nmanner was an error and oversight. After additional inquiry, respondent\r\nacknowledged he failed to safeguard the payoff funds, had not been reconciling the\r\ntrust account into which the funds had been placed, and was not maintaining full\r\nand accurate trust account records as required by Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n1   In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).\r\n\n                                    Matter D\r\n\r\nFor many years, respondent failed to properly manage the trust account involved in\r\nMatters B and C above. Trust account records provided to ODC demonstrated\r\nrespondent failed to safeguard funds belonging to the clients and failed to comply\r\nwith Rule 417, SCACR. Moreover, the records were not sufficient to gain a\r\ncomplete understanding of the management of the account. Respondent failed to\r\nmaintain or produce ledgers for many of his clients. He also issued checks to\r\nhimself in connection with clients for whom he produced no ledgers. Many\r\ndisbursements from the trust account could not be linked to corresponding\r\ndeposits. Some of the ledgers produced were inaccurate, incorrectly reflecting a\r\nzero balance when, in reality, disbursements exceeded deposits. At least one\r\nledger reflected a zero balance when there should have been a small amount of\r\nfunds remaining. Respondent submitted journals that did not capture all account\r\ntransactions. Respondent did not produce any reconciliation reports for the trust\r\naccount and admitted he routinely failed to conduct monthly reconciliations. After\r\nhis initial compliance with a subpoena, respondent twice submitted corrected\r\njournals and ledgers to ODC after comparing his records to bank statements.\r\n\r\nRespondent also commingled his money with that of his clients and withdrew more\r\nmoney for his own uses than he ever placed into the account. In September 2009,\r\nrespondent placed $70,000 in personal funds into the trust account. In June 2011,\r\nshortly before he submitted the payoff in the refinance matter, respondent placed\r\nanother $85,000 in personal funds in the account. He explained he did not put the\r\nmoney into his operating account because he wanted to avoid it being taxed as\r\nincome. However, he also needed to infuse the account with money to make up for\r\nhis failure to safeguard the funds of the clients in Matters B and C. After making\r\nthe deposits, respondent used the trust account to pay personal and professional\r\nexpenses, but did not keep track of the personal funds by ledger or otherwise.\r\nRespondent paid his home mortgage, home utility bills, cell phone bills, credit\r\ncards, insurance, shopping bills, personal loans, and other personal expenses from\r\nthe account. He also paid for business expenses, including online continuing legal\r\neducation courses, payroll, computer expenses, furniture, and telephone service\r\nfrom his trust account. Before the account was closed in October 2011, respondent\r\nplaced an additional $6,110 in personal funds into the account to cover NSF items\r\nand fees. According to his own admittedly inaccurate records, respondent\r\ndisbursed at least $175,177 for personal and office expenses, $14,067 more than\r\nthe $161,110 in personal funds he placed into the account. By spending more than\r\nhe personally had on deposit, respondent misappropriated client funds.\r\n\nRespondent also failed to safeguard funds he was holding for the seven children of\r\na widow and her late husband, who was killed in a work-related accident.\r\nAlthough a complaint was not filed, the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection\r\napproved claims that respondent misappropriated $62,956.72 from the children.\r\nRespondent did not provide ODC with a ledger for the funds, but did write checks\r\nto the children's mother from the account and wrote himself at least one $500\r\ncheck associated with the family.    Matter E\r\n\r\nDue to lack of proper management and recordkeeping, respondent chose to stop\r\nusing the trust account involved in the matters above. However, because of his\r\nimproper handling of the account and inadequate recordkeeping, he failed to have\r\nsufficient funds in the account to cover outstanding items and seven items, totaling\r\n$3,060.36, were paid against insufficient funds. Some of the items were for\r\nmatters involving clients and some were disbursements for payroll or personal\r\nexpenses. Respondent deposited $6,110 in personal funds into the account to\r\ncover these items, plus fees and any other outstanding items. Ultimately, the bank\r\nclosed the account and charged off a negative balance of $122.38, but respondent\r\npaid the bank for the charged off amount.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter F\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to respond to the notice of investigation in this matter, providing\r\na response only after receiving a Treacy letter. In addition, respondent failed to\r\nrespond to ODC's written request for additional information until he received a\r\nreminder letter. Although it was determined respondent did not commit\r\nmisconduct in the matter, he did violate Rule 8.1(b) by failing to timely respond to\r\nODC's inquiries regarding the matter.Matter G\r\n\r\nRespondent opened a new trust account in July 2011. The account had a balance\r\nof $337.57 when respondent deposited a $20,000 settlement check for a domestic\r\ncase. The next day, respondent issued a $500 check to himself that was not\r\nassociated with the domestic case. He was able to cash the $500 check and the\r\ncheck cleared because of the intervening deposit. However, when the $19,117\r\ncheck to his domestic client cleared the account, insufficient funds remained to pay\r\nthe $893 check respondent issued to himself for fees in the domestic case. The\r\n\nbank honored the check and respondent deposited personal funds to correct the\r\naccount balance.                  Matter H\r\n\r\nClient hired respondent to help him get an abandoned road reopened so he could\r\nhave access to his landlocked property. Respondent did not work diligently on\r\nclient's behalf and did not keep him informed of the status of the matter. The\r\nLawyers' Fund for Client Protection approved payment to client of $905, the entire\r\nfee client paid to respondent.        Matter I\r\n\r\nThe Resolution of Fee Disputes Board issued a $1,450 award against respondent in\r\nfavor of a former client. Respondent did not pay client pursuant to the award.\r\nRespondent does not dispute client is entitled to the money, but states he does not\r\nhave the funds to pay client at this time. The Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection\r\npaid client $1,450.                     Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (requiring lawyer\r\nto act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4\r\n(requiring lawyer to keep a client reasonably informed about the status of a\r\nmatter); Rule 1.15(a) (requiring a lawyer to keep client funds separate from the\r\nlawyer's own property, to safeguard client property and keep complete records of\r\nfunds in such accounts); Rule 1.16(d) (requiring a lawyer to return any unearned\r\nfee after termination of representation); Rule 8.1(a) (prohibiting a lawyer from\r\nknowingly making a false statement of material fact to a disciplinary authority);\r\nRule 8.1(b) (knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a\r\ndisciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(d) (providing it is professional misconduct for\r\na lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, deceit or misrepresentation).\r\nRespondent also admits he violated Rule 417, SCACR, which sets forth\r\nrequirements for financial recordkeeping.\r\n\r\nFinally, respondent admits his conduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the\r\nfollowing provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it is a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules\r\nof Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\nprofessional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it is a ground for discipline for\r\n\na lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to\r\nbring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an\r\nunfitness to practice law).          Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state retroactive to March 7, 2012, the date of his interim\r\nsuspension. Within fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall\r\nfile an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30\r\nof Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\nPractice of Law to the Clerk of Court. Within thirty days of the date of this\r\nopinion, respondent shall enter into a payment plan with the Commission on\r\nLawyer Conduct to (1) repay costs incurred by the Commission and ODC and (2)\r\nreimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for all amounts paid to\r\nrespondent's former clients. Respondent may not apply for readmission to the\r\nSouth Carolina Bar until he has had a six-year forensic accounting and audit\r\nperformed of all of this trust accounts by a certified public accountant (CPA), the\r\nCPA renders a report giving reasonable assurance that all injured parties have been\r\nidentified, and respondent has made restitution to all injured parties identified in\r\nthe report.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27343","title":"Martinez v.

The circuit court\r\norder reversed a decision of the Workers' Compensation Commission and\r\nremanded the case for further proceedings. Pursuant to this Court's decision in\r\nBone v. U.S. Food Service, 404 S.C. 67, 744 S.E.2d 552 (2013), we find the circuit\r\ncourt's order was not a final judgment and therefore it was not appealable.\r\nAccordingly, we vacate the court of appeals' opinion and remand the case to the\r\nCommission.\r\n\r\n      Raquel Martinez, the claimant, was employed by the County as a master\r\ndeputy forensic investigator. In that capacity she investigated an accident scene\r\nwhere an infant girl was fatally crushed by a car driven by the child's father, a\r\npolice officer who formerly worked with Martinez. She later suffered a mental\r\nbreakdown and filed a workers' compensation claim alleging the breakdown was\r\nthe result of the investigation. Both the single commissioner and the appellate\r\npanel of the Workers' Compensation Commission found Martinez's claim was not\r\ncompensable because the investigation was not an extraordinary and unusual\r\ncondition of her employment and because the investigation did not proximately\r\ncause her injury. Martinez appealed to the circuit court which reversed and\r\nremanded the case for further proceedings before the Commission. Respondents\r\nappealed to the court of appeals which reversed the circuit court, finding Martinez's\r\ninjury noncompensable. Martinez v. Spartanburg County, 394 S.C. 224, 715\r\nS.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2011).\r\n\r\n       A party is entitled to judicial review of any final agency decision. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-23-380 (Supp. 2012). Once the initial judicial branch appellate\r\nreview of an agency decision is complete, further appellate review is governed by\r\nSection 1-23-390 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2012). That statute permits\r\nfurther appellate review only \"of a final judgment of the circuit court or the court\r\nof appeals.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-390. In Bone, this Court construed \"final\r\njudgment\" to mean an order \"that finally disposes of the whole subject matter of\r\nthe action or terminates the action, leaving nothing to be done but to execute the\r\njudgment . . . .\" Bone, 404 S.C. at 83, 744 S.E.2d at 561.\r\n\r\n       Here, under Bone, the circuit court's order was not a final judgment. It\r\nremanded the matter to the Commission for further proceedings, and thus left\r\nmatters to be determined rather than disposing of the whole subject matter of the\r\naction.

The court of appeals\r\naffirmed. We affirm the court of appeals' decision as modified.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       In 2006, DLI Properties, LLC (DLI), hired Allen Tate, a real estate\r\nbrokerage firm, and Faile, Allen Tate's licensee, to serve as its agents in connection\r\nwith the sale of certain real property in Lancaster, South Carolina (the property).\r\nPetitioners, using Sharon Davis of Davis Integrity Realty, Inc. as their broker,\r\noffered to purchase the property.1\r\n\r\n       On August 1, 2006, at Petitioners' request, Faile sent Petitioners a draft form\r\nof an \"Agreement to Buy and Sell Real Estate\" (the offer). Upon receiving the\r\noffer, Petitioners made changes to several terms, initialed the changes, signed the\r\noffer, and returned it to Faile on August 3, for consideration by DLI. That same\r\nday, DLI made material changes to the offer, initialed those changes, signed the\r\noffer, and Faile returned it to Petitioners for consideration and approval. At some\r\npoint later that day, after receiving the offer from Petitioners with initials to only\r\nsome of DLI's changes, Faile faxed Davis the offer with the signatures and stated\r\nin the fax cover sheet that Petitioners needed to initial a few more items to finalize\r\nthe offer. On Friday, August 4, Petitioner Larius Woodson (Larius) called Faile\r\nand explained he forgot to include in the offer a $4,300 limit on the cost of tapping\r\ninto the existing water and sewer system (tap fee), which was a contingency term\r\nof the offer. Faile told Larius she would discuss the tap fee with DLI, but was\r\nunsure whether DLI would accept the change.\r\n\r\n       After Faile discussed the tap fee with a DLI representative, Faile telephoned\r\nLarius and left a voice message at 5:00 p.m. on August 4, stating DLI agreed to the\r\nchange and directing Larius to notate the change, initial it, and deliver the offer to\r\nher with a check for the $1,000 earnest money deposit. Petitioners inserted the tap\r\nfee term, and initialed that change as well as DLI's changes. On Saturday, August\r\n5, Petitioners delivered the offer to Faile's office with a check for the earnest\r\nmoney. Around 3:00 p.m. that day, Faile picked up the offer and check from her\r\n\r\n1Although Davis acted as Petitioners' agent, she was absent during relevant\r\nportions of the real estate transaction. Therefore, at times, Petitioners\r\ncommunicated directly with Faile.\r\n\noffice and called DLI to finalize the offer; however, because some of DLI's\r\npartners were out of town and therefore unable to sign the tap fee change, they\r\nagreed to meet on Monday, August 7, to finalize the agreement.\r\n\r\n      On Sunday, August 6, Alan Cauthen contacted Faile through his real estate\r\nagent about making an offer on the property. Faile informed Cauthen's agent that\r\nDLI was considering another offer, but DLI had not finalized that offer yet. The\r\nagent requested Faile to fax over details about the property. Approximately four\r\nhours later, Cauthen's agent indicated Cauthen was very interested in the property\r\nand wanted to make a cash offer with an earlier closing date, but Cauthen was\r\nconcerned with the septic and indicated he wanted an inspection. The inspection\r\noccurred on August 8, with Cauthen and his agent present. After the inspection,\r\nCauthen informed Faile he wanted to make an offer, and Faile stated the offer must\r\nguarantee an earlier closing date and a $5,000 earnest money deposit.\r\n\r\n       In the meantime, on Monday, August 7, Faile informed DLI about Cauthen's\r\noffer. Faile also asked DLI whether she should inform Petitioners about Cauthen's\r\noffer. DLI instructed Faile not to inform Petitioners after Faile told DLI that she\r\nwas afraid that, if she informed Petitioners about the other offer, DLI could lose\r\nboth offers.\r\n\r\n      On Wednesday, August 9, Cauthen delivered a formal written offer to\r\npurchase the property. DLI accepted Cauthen's offer, and the parties executed the\r\nagreement that afternoon. After the agreement's execution, Faile called Davis and\r\ninformed her that DLI had accepted another offer, which contained no\r\ncontingencies and an earlier closing date. Petitioners subsequently filed a lis\r\npendens on the property in the amount of $3,000.\r\n\r\n       On October 27, 2006, Petitioners commenced the current action against\r\nRespondents alleging fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the\r\nSouth Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (the SCUTPA)2 based on DLI's\r\nacceptance of Cauthen's offer and Faile's representation that DLI would accept\r\nPetitioner's offer.3 Petitioners claimed Respondents made misrepresentations\r\nconcerning the validity and effectiveness of their agreement to purchase the\r\n\r\n2   S.C. Code Ann. §§ 39-5-10 to -560 (1985 & Supp. 2012).\r\n3Petitioners made the claims against Respondents in the alternative to their claims\r\nagainst DLI.\r\n\nproperty. Petitioners asserted Respondents had a duty of care to communicate\r\ntruthful information to Petitioners, and breached that duty by failing to disclose the\r\nCauthen offer and the fact that DLI had not signed Petitioners' offer. Petitioners\r\nfurther alleged Respondents demonstrated a pattern of behavior sufficient to\r\nestablish a SCUTPA violation.\r\n\r\n       In his deposition, Larius testified he understood the tap fee's exclusion was a\r\nmistake on his part, which he realized on Friday, August 4, and he merely sought\r\nto enforce the contract for sale he and DLI originally negotiated. Larius stated he\r\nknew DLI planned to sign the tap fee change, but he was unaware that DLI's\r\nsignature to the tap fee change was necessary to render the agreement valid and\r\nenforceable. Larius testified he sought to close on the land and receive\r\nreimbursement for expenses, estimated at $3,000, that he incurred between the\r\ntime Petitioners changed the offer until DLI's rejection of the offer, which was the\r\nperiod between Saturday, August 5, through Wednesday, August 9.4\r\n\r\n       Faile testified that she believed Petitioners and DLI reached an agreement\r\nbefore Petitioners requested the inclusion of the tap fee. However, she testified\r\nthat, prior to this change, she contacted Davis to inform her that the offer still\r\nrequired Petitioners' initials to ensure the validity of the agreement. Faile\r\nacknowledged that DLI would have accepted the offer with the tap fee and that she\r\nconfirmed this with Larius in a voicemail. However, Faile also testified she\r\nbelieved the transaction was not complete until DLI initialed the tap fee change.\r\nShe further testified that she felt the offer contained enough contingency terms, and\r\nthat the tap fee would be an easy way for Petitioners to cancel the deal because the\r\nactual tap fee cost would likely be more than the $4,300 contingency.\r\nAdditionally, Faile testified that she was ethically obligated to bring all potential\r\noffers, including Cauthen's offer, to DLI after Petitioners delivered their offer to\r\nher, because DLI had not yet signed Petitioners' offer containing the tap fee\r\nchange.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4In his deposition, Larius admitted he had no documentation to support the $3,000\r\nclaim for damages; instead, he asserted that amount was the value of his time spent\r\non the deal and gas consumed over the course of approximately four days in which\r\nhe thought the agreement was valid.\r\n\n      On March 26, 2008, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment.5\r\nOn July 13, 2008, after a hearing on July 7, the circuit court entered an order\r\ngranting Respondents' motion for summary judgment, stating:\r\n\r\n               Based upon the arguments of counsel, and upon\r\n               consideration of the motion for summary judgment, the\r\n               pleadings, affidavits, deposition, transcripts, discovery\r\n               responses and other documents on file and the briefs filed\r\n               by the parties, the Court determines that there are no\r\n               genuine issues of material fact, and [Respondents] are\r\n               entitled to judgment as a matter of law on all claims\r\n               against them contained in the Complaint, pursuant to\r\n               Rule 56 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners appealed. The court of appeals affirmed the circuit court, finding\r\nPetitioners failed to satisfy their burden of providing a sufficient record. See\r\nWoodson v. DLI Props., Op. No. 2011-UP-291 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 14, 2011).\r\nThe court of appeals concluded it could not determine whether summary judgment\r\nwas appropriate because the circuit court's order failed to articulate its reasons for\r\ngranting summary judgment. Id. The court of appeals noted that, ordinarily, under\r\nBowen v. Lee Process Systems Co., 342 S.C. 232, 536 S.E.2d 86 (Ct. App. 2000), it\r\nwould vacate the circuit court's grant of summary judgment and remand the case\r\nfor more specific findings and analysis. Id. However, relying in part on Rule\r\n210(h), SCACR,6 the court of appeals declined to do so \"because the trial court\r\n\r\n5 Respondents argued Faile's deposition was evidence that Faile did not promulgate\r\nfalse or misleading information because at all times that she communicated with\r\nLarius, Faile believed she was providing truthful information. Respondents also\r\nargued Petitioners could not establish the necessary elements for their SCUTPA\r\nclaims because there was no evidence Respondents engaged in an unfair or\r\ndeceptive act in the conduct of trade or commerce. Respondents further contended\r\nthat Petitioners could not establish the alleged unfair or deceptive acts affected the\r\npublic interest because Petitioners merely suffered a private harm that was not\r\ncapable of repetition or threatening to the consumer public. Finally, Respondents\r\nargued they were entitled to summary judgment because Petitioners were unable to\r\narticulate any actual damages incurred by them.\r\n6   Rule 210(h), SCACR, provides that \"the appellate court will not consider any fact\r\n\nmight have articulated its decision during the summary judgment hearing and\r\n[Petitioners] failed to provide a hearing transcript.\" Id. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n                                 ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n      I.\t    Whether the court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit court\r\n             on the basis that Petitioners failed to provide a sufficient record\r\n             for review.\r\n      II.\t   Whether the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment\r\n             in favor of Respondents.ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.\t   Sufficient Record\r\n       Petitioners argue that a judgment is effective only when set forth in a written\r\norder, and if there is a conflict between a court's oral ruling and written order, the\r\nwritten order controls. Therefore, Petitioners argue, what the circuit court \"might\"\r\nhave stated during the hearing is irrelevant to whether the motion for summary\r\njudgment should have been granted because such statements would not have been\r\ncontrolling of the outcome. Petitioners further contend, because all memoranda,\r\naffidavits, and other evidence presented to the circuit court were included in the\r\nRecord before the court of appeals, and that evidence is the basis upon which the\r\ncircuit court made its decision, there is no requirement to include the hearing\r\ntranscript.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nwhich does not appear in the Record on Appeal.\" The court of appeals also relied\r\non Price v. Pickens County, 308 S.C. 64, 67, 416 S.E.2d 666, 668 (Ct. App. 1992),\r\nwhich provides, \"[t]he burden is on the appellant to provide a sufficient record\r\nsuch that this court can make an intelligent review.\"\r\n7 Respondents concede the supporting documents containing the facts and legal\r\narguments on which the circuit court relied upon and identified in the order were\r\nincluded in the Record before the court of appeals. Therefore, Respondents\r\nsubmit, the court of appeals did have sufficient information to permit meaningful\r\nappellate review of the merits of Petitioners' arguments.\r\n\n      We agree that the court of appeals erred in affirming the circuit court's grant\r\nof summary judgment on the basis that Petitioners failed to provide a sufficient\r\nrecord.The court of appeals, relying on Bowen, stated it would have vacated and\r\nremanded the case to the circuit court to articulate its reasons for granting summary\r\njudgment if Petitioners had provided a sufficient record. In Bowen, the court of\r\nappeals vacated the trial judge's grant of summary judgment because the order was\r\na cursory form order. The court remanded for a written order identifying the facts\r\nand accompanying legal analysis upon which the judge relied because, based on\r\nthe record, the court of appeals determined the propriety of the summary judgment\r\nwas a rather close question. Bowen, 342 S.C. at 240–41, 536 S.E.2d at 90–91.8\r\nWe agree it is better practice—and in most cases common practice—as well as\r\nbeneficial to the judicial process for a trial judge to articulate relevant findings and\r\nconclusions of law in an order granting summary judgment. However, Rule 52,\r\nSCRCP, provides that \"[f]indings of facts and conclusions of law are unnecessary\r\n\r\n8 We note the court of appeals' application of the Bowen standard is somewhat\r\ninconsistent. Compare B & B Liquors, Inc. v. O'Neil, 361 S.C. 267, 271, 603\r\nS.E.2d 629, 631–32 (Ct. App. 2004) (vacating a form order granting summary\r\njudgment and remanding the case to the trial judge for entry of a written order\r\nidentifying the facts and legal analysis upon which it relied in granting summary\r\njudgment), and Carey v. Snee Farm Cmty. Found., 388 S.C. 229, 230, 232, 694\r\nS.E.2d 244, 245–46 (Ct. App. 2010) (finding the trial judge's reasoning for granting\r\nsummary judgment was not clear from the record where the trial judge's decision\r\nwas in a form order without any stated grounds for his decision), with Porter v.\r\nLabor Depot, 372 S.C. 560, 568, 643 S.E.2d 96, 100 (Ct. App. 2007) (stating that\r\nnot all circumstances require a detailed order if the appellate court can determine\r\nthe basis of the trial judge's ruling from the record on appeal), Clark v. S.C. Dep't\r\nof Pub. Safety, 353 S.C. 291, 311-12, 578 S.E.2d 16, 26 (Ct. App. 2002), aff'd 362\r\nS.C.377, 608 S.E. 2d 573 (2005) (finding Bowen distinguishable because the trial\r\njudge's reasoning for denial of post-trial motions could be determined from the\r\nrecord on appeal), and Inglese v. Beal, 403 S.C. 290, 307–08, 403 S.E.2d 687, 696\r\n(Ct. App. 2013) (Pieper, J., dissenting) (noting the majority affirmed the trial\r\njudge's Form 4 order which simply stated \"Defendant [] Beal's motion for\r\nsummary judgment is granted\").\r\n\non decisions of motions under Rules 12 or 56 . . . .\" Thus, such findings and\r\nconclusions are not required for appellate review, and, for this reason, we overrule\r\nBowen to the extent it is relied upon to vacate and remand orders granting\r\nsummary judgment. Nevertheless, here, the circuit court's reasoning is clear from\r\nthe order, as it plainly referenced the evidence the circuit court considered in\r\nmaking its decision. See Porter, 372 S.C. at 568, 643 S.E.2d at 100 (stating that\r\n\"not all situations require a detailed order, and the circuit court's form order may be\r\nsufficient if the appellate court can ascertain the basis for the circuit court's ruling\r\nfrom the record on appeal\").\r\n\r\n       Further, a decision on a motion for summary judgment is based on\r\ndepositions, interrogatories, affidavits, and other evidentiary material provided by\r\nthe parties. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Quail Hill, L.L.C. v. Cnty. of\r\nRichland, 387 S.C. 223, 234, 692 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2010) (stating appellate courts\r\napply the same standard as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP). Here,\r\nPetitioners provided the requisite evidentiary material to the court of appeals.\r\nTherefore, we find the court of appeals did have a sufficient record before it to\r\npermit meaningful appellate review and make a decision on the merits. See Quail\r\nHill, 387 S.C. at 234, 692 S.E.2d at 505; Hamilton v. Greyhound Lines E., 281 S.C.\r\n442, 444, 316 S.E.2d 368, 369 (1984) (stating the appealing party has the burden of\r\nproviding a sufficient record such that the appellate court can make an intelligent\r\nreview).9\r\n\r\n       Additionally, what the circuit court \"might\" have stated during the hearing\r\non the motion for summary judgment is irrelevant, as a written order constitutes a\r\nfinal order and final judgment of the lower court. See Ford v. State Ethics\r\nComm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 645–646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (citing Rule 58,\r\nSCRCP) (stating \"the written order is the trial judge's final order and as such\r\nconstitutes the final judgment of the court\"); see also Hagood v. Sommerville, 362\r\nS.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708 (2005) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-330(1)\r\n(1976); Rule 72, SCRCP; Rule 201(a), SCACR; Mid-State Distribs., Inc. v.\r\nCentury Imps., Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 335, 426 S.E.2d 777, 781 (1993)) (\"An appeal\r\nordinarily may be pursued only after a party has obtained a final judgment.\"). In\r\n\r\n9 Moreover, the court of appeals' reliance on Rule 210(h), SCACR, is misplaced.\r\nAll of the facts were included in the Record on Appeal before the court of appeals;\r\nthus, the hearing transcript was not necessary for the purposes of appellate review.\r\n\nthe presence of a written order, the court of appeals erred in affirming summary\r\njudgment on the basis that Petitioners did not provide the hearing transcript as part\r\nof the Record. See Ford, 344 S.C. at 645–646, 545 S.E.2d at 823; see also Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP (listing the factual material that is reviewable for purposes of\r\ndeciding whether to grant a motion for summary judgment).\r\n\r\n       The Merits10\r\nII.     In reviewing a grant of summary judgment, our appellate court applies the\r\nsame standard as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Quail Hill, 387 S.C. at\r\n234, 692 S.E.2d at 505. Summary judgment is proper if, viewing the evidence and\r\ninferences to be drawn therefrom in a light most favorable to the nonmoving party,\r\nthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, admissions, and affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party\r\nis entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Quail Hill, 387\r\nS.C. at 235, 692 S.E.2d at 505.\r\n\r\n       Petitioners contend they presented sufficient evidence of fraud to withstand\r\nsummary judgment. Petitioners, relying on section 40-57-137 of the South\r\nCarolina Code, argue Respondents had a duty to disclose Cauthen's offer and the\r\nfact that DLI had not yet finalized Petitioners' offer. Petitioners contend this duty\r\narises because they had \"the right to expressly repose trust and confidence\" in\r\nRespondents with regard to the offer to purchase the property. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 40-57-137 (2011); Jacobson v. Yaschick, 249 S.C. 577, 585, 155 S.E.2d 601,\r\n605 (1967) (stating one of the three distinct classes upon which a duty to disclose\r\narises includes when one party expressly reposes a trust and confidence in the other\r\nin a particular transaction, or the circumstances of that transaction or the nature of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10While remand to the court of appeals is appropriate, in the interest of judicial\r\neconomy, we address the merits of whether summary judgment in favor of\r\nRespondents was proper. Furtick v. S.C. Dep't of Prob., Parole & Pardon Servs.,\r\n352 S.C. 594, 599, 576 S.E.2d 146, 149 (2003) (addressing the merits of a claim in\r\nthe interest of judicial economy despite the respondent being entitled to review by\r\nthe lower court).\r\n\nthe parties' dealings imply such a trust and confidence). Petitioners also contend\r\nRespondents' actions and inactions constituted unfair trade practices under the\r\nSCUTPA. We disagree.11\r\n\r\n        In reviewing the circuit court's order and the Record, we find the facts—\r\nwhich are uncontested—and the law support summary judgment in favor of\r\nRespondents. See Lanham v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C. 356,\r\n361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002) (citation omitted) (stating the moving party has\r\nthe initial burden of demonstrating the absence of a genuine issue of material fact;\r\nhowever, with respect to an issue upon which the nonmoving party has the burden\r\nof proof, the moving party may discharge his responsibility by pointing out to the\r\ntrial judge there is an absence of evidence to support the nonmoving party's case);\r\nEvans v. Stewart, 370 S.C. 522, 526, 636 S.E.2d 632, 635 (Ct. App. 2006) (stating\r\nit is not sufficient for a party to create an inference that is not reasonable or an\r\nissue of fact that is not genuine); see also Rule 56(e), SCRCP (stating an adverse\r\nparty may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of his pleadings to\r\nwithstand summary judgment, but must set forth specific facts showing a genuine\r\nissue exists for trial).\r\n\r\n       Petitioners were not clients of Respondents; rather, Petitioners employed\r\nDavis to represent them in the transaction, and the circumstances of Petitioners'\r\ndealings with Respondents did not imply a \"trust and confidence\" between the\r\nparties giving rise to a duty to disclose another offer. See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 40-\r\n57-135, -137 (2011) (outlining the duties owed by a real estate brokerage firm and\r\na real estate agent);12 Holly Hill Lumber Co. v. McCoy, 201 S.C. 427, 437, 23\r\nS.E.2d 372, 376 (1942) (\"Nondisclosure becomes fraudulent only when it is the\r\nduty of the party having knowledge of the facts to uncover them to the other.\"); see\r\nalso Houck v. State Farm Fire & Cas. Ins. Co., 366 S.C. 7, 11, 620 S.E.2d 326,\r\n\r\n11 We find Petitioners have abandoned the negligent misrepresentation claim by\r\nfailing to set forth an argument on the issue in their brief. See Rule 208(b),\r\nSCACR (stating that, for appellate review of an issue to occur, the issue must be\r\nset forth in a statement and argument); Biales v. Young, 315 S.C. 166, 168, 432\r\nS.E.2d 482, 484 (1993) (stating that a party's failure to argue an issue constitutes\r\nabandonment of the issue and precludes consideration on appeal).\r\n12 Specifically, section 40-57-137, in part, provides that a seller's real estate agent\r\nowes a duty to present all offers to the seller, even when the property is subject to a\r\ncontract of sale. S.C. Code Ann. § 40-57-137(C)(2)(b).\r\n\n329 (2005) (stating it is a question of law whether a duty exists); Jacobson, 249\r\nS.C. at 585, 155 S.E.2d at 605 (providing the three distinct classes upon which a\r\nduty to disclose arises). Therefore, the circuit court properly granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Respondents on the fraud claims. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP;\r\nTurner v. Milliman, 392 S.C. 116, 125, 708 S.E.2d 766, 770 (2011) (citation\r\nomitted) (stating a fraud claim requires proof by clear and convincing evidence).\r\n\r\n       As to Petitioners' unfair trade practices claims, the SCUTPA is not available\r\nto redress a private wrong because an unfair or deceptive act that affects only the\r\nparties to the transaction is beyond the scope of the SCUTPA. Noack Enters., Inc.\r\nv. Country Corner Interiors of Hilton Head Island, Inc., 290 S.C. 475, 478–480,\r\n351 S.E.2d 347, 349–351 (Ct. App. 1986). Here, the transaction only affected\r\nPetitioners, DLI, and Respondents, and therefore, Respondents' actions or inactions\r\nare not actionable under the SCUTPA, and Petitioners failed to present any\r\nevidence to the contrary. Id.; see also Health Promotion Specialists, L.L.C. v. S.C.\r\nBd. of Dentistry, 403 S.C. 623, 638, 743 S.E.2d 808, 816 (2013) (citation omitted)\r\n(stating to recover in an action under the SCUTPA, \"the plaintiff must show: (1)\r\nthe defendant engaged in an unfair or deceptive act in the conduct of trade or\r\ncommerce; (2) the unfair or deceptive act affected the public interest; and (3) the\r\nplaintiff suffered monetary or property loss as a result of the defendant's unfair or\r\ndeceptive act(s)\"). Therefore, we find the circuit court properly granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Respondents on the SCUTPA claims as well.\r\n\r\n         Furthermore, Petitioners' allegation that they suffered $3,000 in actual\r\ndamages is purely speculative and, therefore, not recoverable, which we find\r\nfurther supports summary judgment in favor of Respondents. Larius admitted in\r\nhis deposition that he estimated the $3,000 in damages based on the time and gas\r\nhe spent on the deal between August 5 and 9. He further admitted that he could\r\nnot substantiate that number because he \"had no clue\" of the actual amount of\r\nhours or gas, and simply stated the amount was the value for one week of his time.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 39-5-140(a) (1985) (providing the SCUTPA allows for the\r\nrecovery of actual damages); Fields v. Yarborough Ford, Inc., 307 S.C. 207, 212\r\nn.2, 414 S.E.2d 164, 167 n.2 (1992) (finding the alleged damages speculative\r\nwhere plaintiff admitted he did not actually know if he spent more money on gas as\r\na result of the defendant's deceptive act of nondisclosure that the truck plaintiff\r\npurchased had a larger size engine than defendant stated); Baughman v. AT & T\r\nCo., 306 S.C. 101, 116, 410 S.E.2d 537, 546 (1991) (citations omitted) (\"[I]n order\r\nfor damages to be recoverable the evidence should be such as to enable the court or\r\n\njury to determine the amount thereof with reasonable certainty or accuracy.\r\nNeither the existence, causation nor amount of damages can be left to conjecture,\r\nguess or speculation.\"); see also Michael G.

The settlement provided for the establishment of a fund from which\r\nawards would be made to claimants who established their sexual abuse claims by\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\nAppellants allege they did not receive notice of the settlement. In 2009, after the\r\nclaims and opt-out period provided for in the settlement had expired, they brought\r\nsuit alleging claims of the type covered by the settlement. Three appellants\r\n(siblings) allege that, between 1965 and 1971, as children they were sexually\r\nabused by a priest assigned to St. William Church in Ward, South Carolina; one\r\nappellant is the parent of the allegedly abused children.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n    1.

Settlement terms\r\n\r\nThe trial court held that appellants' claims were identical to those addressed in the\r\nclass action settlement, that appellants were members of the class, and thus that\r\ntheir claims were barred by principles of res judicata and collateral estoppel.\r\nAppellants argue this was error because respondents waived the res judicata effect\r\nof the class action as to all future claims by the terms of the settlement. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n1Appellants did not appeal the trial court's dismissal of their Unfair Trade\r\nPractices Act cause of action.\r\n\nWhen reviewing the dismissal of an action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, the\r\nappellate court applies the same standard of review as the trial court. Doe v.\r\nMarion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645 S.E.2d 245, 247 (2007). If the facts alleged and\r\ninferences reasonably deducible from the allegations set forth in the complaint,\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, entitle him to relief on any\r\ntheory, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper. Id. The complaint should not\r\nbe dismissed merely because the court doubts the plaintiff will prevail in the\r\naction. Id. at 395, 645 S.E. 2d at 248.\r\n\r\nAs an initial matter, appellants argue that, for purposes of reviewing the trial\r\ncourt's grant of dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6), this Court must accept as true their\r\nallegation that respondents waived a statute of limitations defense as to all putative\r\nclass members. We disagree.\r\n\r\nWhen reviewing a motion to dismiss2 for failure to state facts sufficient to\r\nconstitute a cause of action, the pleadings must be construed liberally, and all well\r\npled facts must be presumed true. Charleston County School Dist. v. Harrell, 393\r\nS.C. 552, 557, 713 S.E.2d 604, 607 (2011). However, the interpretation of a\r\njudgment is a question of law for the court. 46 Am. Jur. 2d Judgments § 73.\r\nQuestions of law are reviewed de novo. Town of Summerville v. City of North\r\nCharleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41 (2008). Thus, we consider the\r\ninterpretation of the terms of the underlying court-approved class action settlement\r\nde novo.\r\n\r\n“As a general rule, judgments are to be construed like other written instruments.\r\nThe determinative factor is the intent of the court, as gathered, not from an isolated\r\npart thereof, but from all the parts of the judgment itself. Hence, in construing a\r\njudgment, it should be examined and considered in its entirety. If the language\r\nemployed is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction or\r\ninterpretation, and the effect thereof must be declared in the light of the literal\r\n\r\n2 The trial court's reliance on transcripts and court orders in the underlying class\r\naction did not convert the motion to one for summary judgment. See Rule 12(b),\r\nSCRCP; Mullis v. U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Dist. of Nevada, 828 F.2d 1385,\r\n1388 (9th Cir. 1987) (under federal rules, court may consider facts subject to\r\njudicial notice, including orders and record in underlying case); General Time\r\nCorp. v. Bulk Materials, Inc., 826 F.Supp. 471, 473 (M.D. Ga. 1993) (consent\r\norder); Stahl v. U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, 327 F.3d 697, 700 (8th Cir. 2003)\r\n(contract documents).\r\n\nmeaning of the language used.” Weil v. Weil, 299 S.C. 84, 90, 382 S.E.2d 471, 474\r\n(Ct. App. 1989) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).\r\n\r\nIn this case, the language in the settlement-related court orders on which\r\nappellants' argument depends arose in the context of discussions about notice to\r\nputative class members. The original design of the settlement included a 120-day\r\nperiod after the initial notice of final approval of the settlement for any person to\r\nmake a claim under it. Notice was to be provided to potential claimants through\r\npublication in eleven South Carolina newspapers at least once a week for six weeks\r\nand in respondents' own periodical, the Catholic Miscellany, in three consecutive\r\nissues.\r\n\r\nHowever, it came to light that respondents had been operating under an Instruction\r\nfrom the Vatican that required them to treat allegations of abuse with great secrecy\r\nand that their internal files contained the names of several dozen people about\r\nwhose possible abuse respondents had already received some notice but who had\r\nnot previously had any claims resolved. Half were already represented in the class\r\naction, and half were not. Of the latter group, all but four were located and notified\r\nof the pending class action before the Dorchester court approved the settlement.\r\nThe Dorchester court remained concerned about these final four people. In its July\r\n30, 2007, order approving the settlement, the Dorchester court stated that\r\n\r\n      [t]he Diocese has represented to the Court that 20 individuals who\r\n      may be class members were identified by it in a search of its files.\r\n      Sixteen of these were located, and as to the other four, I find, . . . , that\r\n      reasonable efforts were used to locate those individuals and that their\r\n      present whereabouts are unknown. The Diocese has further stated\r\n      that it understands that any person who should have had notice, but\r\n      did not receive notice for whatever reason, would not be bound by the\r\n      res judicata effect of the settlement. Further, the Diocese has\r\n      stipulated before me in open Court and on the record that any person\r\n      who comes forward at a later date and can show that he or she should\r\n      have received notice but did not could participate in an arbitration\r\n      process with terms identical to the Settlement and Arbitration\r\n      Agreement before the Court for approval today.\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the language of the July order both removes the ordinary res\r\njudicata effect of a class settlement and requires respondents to honor the terms of\r\nthe settlement as to any future claimant notwithstanding the expiration of the\r\nclaims period. While we agree with appellants regarding the import of the\r\n\nlanguage of the July order, the Dorchester court entered another order related to the\r\nsettlement on August 31, 2007. It clarified, in relevant part, that\r\n\r\n      in the Court's [July 30] Order . . . approving the Class settlement, the\r\n      Court made reference to the existence of individuals who, according\r\n      to the Diocese, (1) were potential class members; (2) came forward to\r\n      the Diocese at some time in the past with their allegations of child\r\n      sexual abuse; (3) never resolved their potential claims; and (4) were\r\n      entitled to receive actual notice of the proposed class settlement\r\n      pursuant to the agreement of the parties and earlier instructions from\r\n      this Court (hereinafter referred to as \"Actual Notice Class Members\").\r\n      The [Respondents] have asked the Court to clarify how the settlement\r\n      process will treat the Actual Notice Class Members. Accordingly, this\r\n      Order clarifies and, where in conflict, supersedes the Court's Order of\r\n      July 30, 2007.\r\n\r\n      Actual Notice Class Members shall have 120 days from receipt of\r\n      actual notice of the class settlement to present their claims to an\r\n      Arbitrator in the same manner as provided for in the Settlement and\r\n      Arbitration Agreement. Actual Notice Class Members who present\r\n      their claims more than 120 days after they receive actual notice of the\r\n      settlement shall be barred from participation in the settlement process\r\n      and shall be treated like any other class member who has failed to\r\n      timely present a claim to the class settlement fund.\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the August order alters the terms of the settlement only as to\r\nActual Notice Class Members. They contend that, as general class members, they\r\nare entitled to be treated under the more generous terms of the July order. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nThe August 2007 order clarifies that the Actual Notice Class Members have 120\r\ndays to file claims from the time they receive actual notice, rather than being\r\nlimited to 120 days from the entry of judgment, as the other (constructive notice)\r\nclass members were limited under the settlement. It also reiterates that any\r\nclaimant who fails to present her claim within the 120-day notice period will be\r\n\"barred from participation in the settlement process . . . like any other class\r\nmember who had failed to timely present a claim to the class settlement fund.\"\r\nThis language unambiguously indicates that the 120-day claims period for general\r\nclass members established in the original settlement remained in place and any\r\nseemingly contrary language in the July order was superseded by the August order.\r\n\nThus, the terms of the July order do not permit appellants to avoid its res judicata\r\neffect and that respondents did not waive a statute of limitations defense as to\r\nfuture claimants who failed to come forward within the claims period provided in\r\nthe settlement.\r\n\r\nII. Issue preclusion\r\n\r\nAppellants argue that the trial court erred when it dismissed their claims on the\r\nbases that the settlement is res judicata as to appellants' claims and that appellants'\r\nclaims are collaterally estopped because they were decided in favor of respondents\r\nin another case before the same court. We agree.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the ordinarily preclusive effect of a concluded class action suit,\r\nabsent class members are entitled to due process before their claims are subject to\r\nthe suit's res judicata effect. See Hospitality Management Associates, Inc. v. Shell\r\nOil Co., 356 S.C. 644, 660, 591 S.E.2d 611, 619 (2004) (hereinafter Hospitality).\r\nSpecifically, before absent class members can be finally bound by the resolution of\r\nthe class action suit, they are entitled to a limited review on the issues whether\r\nsufficient notice was given to putative class members and whether class members\r\nhad adequate representation. Id.; see also Richburg v. Baughman, 290 S.C. 431,\r\n434-35, 351 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1986) (Due process guarantees to persons who never\r\nhad a chance to present their evidence and arguments on a claim a full and fair\r\nopportunity to litigate the relevant issue even when \"one or more existing\r\nadjudications of the identical issue . . . stand squarely against their position\" so\r\nlong as the litigant was not a party or in privity with a party in the previous suit.).\r\n\r\nAppellants allege they were deprived of due process in the settlement because it\r\nfailed to provide either sufficient notice or adequate representation to absent class\r\nmembers. The trial court disagreed. Regarding adequate notice, it held simply that\r\nthe issue of notice was litigated in Dorchester County, resulting in a final judgment\r\non the merits. Thus, it failed to engage in even limited collateral review whether\r\nappellants received minimal notice to satisfy due process. Nor did the trial court\r\nanalyze appellants' allegations of inadequate representation in the settlement\r\nproceedings.3 Such allegations would, if substantiated, entitle Appellants to a\r\n\r\n3We note that Hospitality was decided in light of deference due to judgments from\r\nother states' courts under the Full Faith and Credit clause of the United States\r\nConstitution. Review of the procedures provided in a domestic class action does\r\nnot implicate that clause and raises no similar constitutional tension with the\r\nguarantees the Due Process clause provides to absent class members. We do not\r\n\nhearing on their underlying claims, so that dismissal on the pleadings was\r\nimproper. Doe, supra.\r\n\r\nThe trial court also held appellants are collaterally estopped from litigating their\r\nclaims because their issues were actually adjudicated in \"a ruling from the same\r\ncourt in favor of these same Defendants\" despite the fact that ruling involved a\r\ndifferent plaintiff. Appellants argue this was error. We agree. Absent a showing\r\nappellants were in privity with the plaintiff in the previous proceeding, they are not\r\ncollaterally estopped from litigating the same issue. Richburg, supra.\r\n\r\nIII. Statute of limitations\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred when it found that, even absent the res\r\njudicata effect of the settlement, the statute of limitations bars their underlying\r\nclaims. We agree.\r\n\r\nThe trial court determined that appellants' claims are independently barred by the\r\nstatute of limitations. It determined, and appellants do not dispute, that S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 15-3-535 (2005) applies to these claims.4 Section 15-3-535 requires\r\nactions \"be commenced within three years after the person knew or by the exercise\r\nof reasonable diligence should have known that he had a cause of action.\" The\r\ntrial court found appellants were put on notice of their cause of action by the acts\r\nof sexual abuse and that none of the alleged actions of concealment could have\r\nconcealed such harm from them. It held that although three were minors when\r\nthose acts occurred and the statute was tolled during their minority, the statute of\r\nlimitations expired at the latest in 1989.5 Appellants argue the trial court erred\r\nbecause respondents' negligent supervision of an employee is the tort at issue, not\r\nthe sexual abuse itself. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nreach the question whether plaintiffs seeking to avoid the preclusive effect of a\r\ndomestic class action are entitled to anything more than the limited collateral\r\nreview available under Hospitality. See also Salmonsen v. CGD, Inc., 377 S.C.\r\n442, 457, 661 S.E.2d 81, 90-91 (2008) (quoting Hospitality in analysis of domestic\r\nclass action question).\r\n4 Section 15-3-555, providing a six-year statute of limitations for actions arising\r\nout of sexual abuse or incest, became effective in 2001, long after the acts of\r\nsexual abuse that gave rise to appellants' claims occurred.\r\n5 It found the youngest appellant was 21 years old in 1986.\r\n\nAn employer may be liable for negligent supervision when (1) his employee\r\nintentionally harms another when he is on the employer's premises, is on premises\r\nhe is privileged to enter only as employee, or is using the employer's chattel; (2)\r\nthe employer knows or has reason to know he has the ability to control the\r\nemployee; and (3) the employer knows or has reason to know of the necessity and\r\nopportunity to exercise such control. Degenhart v. Knights of Columbus, 309 S.C.\r\n114, 116-17, 420 S.E.2d 495, 496 (1992). This rule has been applied to find an\r\nemployer liable for negligent supervision when the employee sexually assaulted a\r\nminor and the employer had some notice of the employee's prior inappropriate\r\nsexual behavior with another minor. Doe by Doe v. Greenville Hosp. System, 323\r\nS.C. 33, 40-41, 448 S.E.2d 564, 568 (Ct. App. 1994). The employer's liability is\r\ndirect, not derivative. James v. Kelly Trucking Co., 377 S.C. 628, 631, 661 S.E.2d\r\n329, 331 (2008). Thus, the facts alleged in this case would, if established, make\r\nout a claim for this independent cause of action, separate from the sexual abuse\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\"The statute of limitations on a negligence claim accrues at the time of the\r\nnegligence, or when facts and circumstances would put a person of common\r\nknowledge on notice that he might have a claim against another party (discovery\r\nrule).\" Kreutner v. David, 320 S.C. 283, 285, 465 S.E.2d 88, 90 (1995) (internal\r\nfootnote omitted). Deliberate acts of deception by a defendant calculated to\r\nconceal from a potential plaintiff that he has a cause of action toll the statute of\r\nlimitations. Strong v. University of South Carolina School of Medicine, 316 S.C.\r\n189, 191, 447 S.E.2d 850, 852 (1994).\r\n\r\nAppellants allege respondents engaged in a systematic practice of secrecy and\r\nconcealment of their knowledge of sexual abuse by employees, including the\r\nemployee who appellants allege committed the abuse at issue. The employer's\r\nknowledge of an employee's dangerousness is an element of the tort of negligent\r\nsupervision. See Greenville Hospital System, supra. Thus, appellants' allegations\r\ncould, if proven, toll the statute of limitations.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nWe hold the language of the settlement does not waive its res judicata effect as to\r\nfuture claimants, so that appellants are not entitled to treatment as class claimants.\r\nHowever, dismissal on the pleadings was not warranted on the questions whether\r\nappellants were deprived of notice or adequate representation in the underlying\r\nclass settlement and, if so, whether the statute of limitations was tolled on their\r\nclaim of negligent supervision. Should appellants establish on remand that they\r\n\nwere denied due process owing to lack of notice or because of inadequate\r\nrepresentation in the class action proceedings, and that the statute of limitations\r\nwas tolled, they may proceed to further prosecution of their claims. We therefore\r\naffirm in part and reverse in part and remand for further proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED in part and REVERSED in part and REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27346","title":"SCDMV v.

Specifically, the OMVH\r\nfound that the required \"simulator test\" was not conducted prior to the actual test.\r\nThe Administrative Law Court (ALC) reversed and reinstated Petitioner's license\r\nsuspension.\r\n\r\n       On appeal, the court of appeals affirmed the ALC's order, finding\r\nPetitioner's failure to contemporaneously object to the arresting officer's testimony\r\nwith respect to the functioning of the breathalyzer precluded the review of the issue\r\non appeal. We affirm Petitioner's driver's license suspension.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       On July 7, 2008, at approximately 1:46 a.m., Officer Scott Wilson of the\r\nColumbia Police Department initiated a traffic stop after observing Petitioner's\r\nvehicle traveling on Harden Street without the headlights illuminated. During the\r\nstop, Officer Wilson smelled alcohol on Petitioner's breath and observed that\r\nPetitioner exhibited bloodshot eyes, slurred speech, and \"slow and deliberate\r\nmovements.\" As a result, Officer Wilson advised Petitioner of his Miranda2 rights\r\nand ordered him to perform four field sobriety tests. After Petitioner \"failed\" three\r\nof the four tests, Officer Wilson arrested Petitioner and transported him to the\r\nColumbia Police Department.\r\n\r\n      At the police department, Petitioner agreed to submit to a DataMaster\r\nbreathalyzer test after being read the Advisement of Implied Consent rights3 and\r\n1S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2930 (2006) (outlining the offense of operating a motor\r\nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol or drugs). We note that this code\r\nsection and related code sections referenced in this opinion were amended in 2008\r\nand again in 2012. Because Petitioner's arrest occurred prior to these amendments,\r\nwe cite to the code sections in effect at the time of his arrest. There are, however,\r\nno substantive changes that would affect the disposition of this case.\r\n2   Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n3See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(a) (2006) (\"A person who drives a motor\r\nvehicle in this State is considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his\r\nbreath, blood, or urine for the purpose of determining the presence of alcohol or\r\n\nhis Miranda rights. According to Officer Wilson, Petitioner had a blood alcohol\r\nconcentration level of 0.17%, more than twice the legal limit of 0.08%. See S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 56-5-2933 (2006). As a result, he issued Petitioner a Notice of\r\nSuspension pursuant to section 56-5-2951(A) of the South Carolina Code.4\r\n\r\n      Petitioner filed a timely request for an administrative hearing before the\r\nOMVH to challenge the license suspension. On August 26, 2008, the Hearing\r\nOfficer held a hearing on Petitioner's license suspension in accordance with section\r\n56-5-2951 of the South Carolina Code.5 At the hearing, Officer Wilson testified as\r\n\r\ndrugs or the combination of alcohol and drugs if arrested for an offense arising out\r\nof acts alleged to have been committed while the person was driving a motor\r\nvehicle while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol\r\nand drugs. A breath test must be administered at the direction of a law\r\nenforcement officer who has arrested a person for driving a motor vehicle in this\r\nState while under the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and\r\ndrugs.\").\r\n4 See S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2951(A) (2006) (\"The Department of Motor Vehicles\r\nmust suspend the driver's license of . . . a person who drives a motor vehicle and . .\r\n. has an alcohol concentration of [0.15%] or more.\").\r\n5 Section 56-5-2951(F) limits the scope of the administrative hearing to whether\r\nthe person:\r\n\r\n      (1) was lawfully arrested or detained;\r\n\r\n      (2) was advised in writing of the rights enumerated in Section 56-5-\r\n      2950;\r\n\r\n      (3) refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; or\r\n\r\n      (4) consented to taking a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950, and the:\r\n\r\n             (a) reported alcohol concentration at the time of testing was\r\n             [0.15%] or more;\r\n\r\n             (b) individual who administered the test or took samples was\r\n             qualified pursuant to Section 56-5-2950;\r\n\r\n             (c) tests administered and samples obtained were conducted\r\n             pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; and\r\n\nthe sole witness for the Department. During his brief testimony, Officer Wilson\r\nrecounted the arrest and Petitioner's submission to the breathalyzer test, which\r\nresulted in the purported \"0.17\" reading.6 Officer Wilson attested that he was\r\ncertified to operate the DataMaster machine and that \"[t]he machine was\r\nfunctioning properly at the time\" of the test. However, the Department did not\r\noffer any documentary evidence concerning the machine's functioning or the actual\r\ntest results.\r\n\r\n       It was not until his closing argument that counsel for Petitioner moved to\r\nrescind the license suspension on the ground the Department failed to produce\r\nevidence that the breathalyzer test was administered in accordance with the\r\nprocedures set forth in section 56-5-2950, which, in part, requires a simulator test\r\nto be performed prior to the actual test to ensure the machine is functioning\r\nproperly.7\r\n\r\n      In response to Petitioner's belated motion, Officer Wilson referenced his\r\ntestimony that the machine was functioning properly and explained that the\r\n\r\n\r\n               (d) the machine was working properly.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(F) (2006) (emphasis added).\r\n6 Specifically, Officer Wilson testified, without objection, that Petitioner submitted\r\nto the breathalyzer test:\r\n\r\n         [Petitioner] was placed under arrest at that time. He was taken to the\r\n         DataMaster room at police headquarters. He was informed of the . . .\r\n         video recording at the site. He was Mirandized again. He was read his\r\n         implied consent; mouth was checked; did a time stamp; he was\r\n         observed for 20 minutes. He did take the test; he blew a .17.\r\n7   Section 56-5-2950(a) provides, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n         The breath test must be administered by a person trained and certified\r\n         by the Department of Public Safety, pursuant to SLED policies . . . .\r\n         Before the breath test is administered, an [0.08%] simulator test\r\n         must be performed and the result must reflect a reading between\r\n         0.076[%] and 0.084[%].\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(a) (2006) (emphasis added).\r\n\nmachine \"does check itself to make sure it . . . meets all the requirements within the\r\nsimulator,\" which include the temperatures and the alcohol level. He added that\r\nthe machine \"will not function if it's past its solution change date.\" Petitioner\r\nobjected to Officer Wilson offering any new testimony. In turn, the Hearing\r\nOfficer struck the \"last statement regarding it will not function, it will not work\r\nproperly.\"\r\n\r\n      Following the hearing, the Hearing Officer issued an order wherein he\r\nrescinded the administrative suspension of Petitioner's license. In so ruling, the\r\nHearing Officer concluded that \"[t]he officer must show that he complied with all\r\nrequirements while administering the breath test and that the machine was\r\nfunctioning properly.\" Although the Hearing Officer acknowledged Officer\r\nWilson's testimony that the machine was working properly and that the test\r\nreported a blood alcohol concentration of 0.17%, he found the Department did not\r\npresent any documentary evidence supporting Wilson's testimony. Ultimately, the\r\nHearing Officer rescinded the license suspension as the Department failed to\r\npresent evidence to show that Petitioner registered a 0.15% or greater on the\r\nbreathalyzer test.\r\n\r\n       The Department appealed, and the ALC reversed the decision of the Hearing\r\nOfficer.8 As a threshold matter, the ALC found the Hearing Officer erred in\r\ndiscounting Officer Wilson's sworn testimony on whether the DataMaster machine\r\nwas working properly \"simply because the testimony was not corroborated by\r\nother evidence.\" Because this testimony was not contradicted, the ALC\r\ndetermined the Department carried \"its burden of proof.\"\r\n\r\n       Although the ALC acknowledged that Officer Wilson did not testify\r\nregarding the simulator test provision of section 56-5-2950, the court found\r\nPetitioner was statutorily required to raise this issue to the Hearing Officer prior to\r\nhis closing argument.9 In reaching this conclusion, the ALC found the Department\r\n\r\n8 Initially, the ALC held the Hearing Officer erred in finding there was no evidence\r\nPetitioner registered 0.15% or greater on the breath test as Officer Wilson testified\r\nthe test indicated a reading of 0.17%. As noted by the ALC, Petitioner conceded in\r\nhis brief to the ALC that Officer Wilson testified regarding the 0.17% reading.\r\n9   In support of this finding, the ALC cited section 56-5-2950(e), which provides:\r\n\r\n        Policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by SLED may be\r\n        reviewed by the trial judge or hearing officer on motion of either\r\n\nwas not required to present evidence regarding the simulator solution \"as part of its\r\nprima facie case.\" Instead, the ALC found that pursuant to section 56-5-2950(e),\r\n\"the provisions under § 56-5-2950 must not be considered by OMVH hearing\r\nofficers unless a party expressly moves for their consideration.\" (Emphasis\r\nadded.) The ALC noted that \"even in cases where a violation of the provisions is\r\nshown, rescission of the motorist's administrative suspension is not automatic.\"\r\n\r\n       The ALC explained that \"test results cannot be excluded simply because an\r\narresting officer failed to testify that a specific provision in § 56-5-2950 was\r\nfollowed, unless the motorist makes a motion during the hearing requesting the\r\nOMVH hearing officer to review such provision and the hearing officer determines\r\nthat law enforcement's failure to comply with the provision materially affected the\r\naccuracy or reliability of the test[] results or the fairness of the testing procedure.\"\r\nApplying this reasoning, the ALC concluded that Petitioner, by waiting until his\r\nclosing argument to raise the issue of compliance with the provisions of section 56-\r\n5-2950, deprived the Department of a sufficient opportunity to respond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      party. The failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, and\r\n      regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the\r\n      exclusion from evidence any test[] results, if the trial judge or hearing\r\n      officer finds that such failure materially affected the accuracy or\r\n      reliability of the test results or the fairness of the testing procedure.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(e) (2006) (emphasis added). In the 2008\r\namendments, this section was designated as subsection (J) and its final sentence\r\nchanged to state:\r\n\r\n      The failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, and\r\n      regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the\r\n      exclusion from evidence of any test results, if the trial judge or\r\n      hearing officer finds that this failure materially affected the accuracy\r\n      or reliability of the test results or the fairness of the testing procedure\r\n      and the court[,] trial judge[,] or hearing officer rules specifically as to\r\n      the manner in which the failure materially affected the accuracy or\r\n      reliability of the test results or the fairness of the procedure.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(J) (2013).\r\n\nUltimately, the ALC found Officer Wilson's failure to testify specifically that he\r\nperformed the simulator test before administering the breathalyzer test did not\r\nrequire rescission of the license suspension, as Petitioner failed to timely raise the\r\nissue.Petitioner appealed. In an unpublished opinion, the court of appeals\r\nsummarily affirmed the ALC's reinstatement of Petitioner's license suspension.\r\nS.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. Brown, No. 2011-UP-130 (S.C. Ct. App. Mar. 29,\r\n2011). In so ruling, the court found Petitioner failed to properly preserve his\r\nchallenge as to whether the Department presented evidence that law enforcement\r\nadministered the breath test and obtained the sample in accordance with section\r\n56-5-2950 because he did not contemporaneously object to Officer Wilson's\r\ntestimony. The court explained that Officer Wilson testified the \"machine was\r\nworking properly in general\" and further noted \"the test results were admitted\r\nwithout objection.\"\r\n\r\n      This Court granted Petitioner's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the\r\ndecision of the court of appeals.       ISSUE\r\n      Whether section 56-5-2950(e) automatically excludes breathalyzer\r\n      test evidence when the Department does not specifically adduce\r\n      testimony that law enforcement followed each procedure required by\r\n      56-5-2950(a)?                   ANALYSIS\r\n      As stated, supra, section 56-5-2950(e) provides:\r\n\r\n      Policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by SLED may be\r\n      reviewed by the trial judge or hearing officer on motion of either\r\n      party. The failure to follow any of these policies, procedures, and\r\n      regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the\r\n      exclusion from evidence any test[] results, if the trial judge or hearing\r\n      officer finds that such failure materially affected the accuracy or\r\n      reliability of the test results or the fairness of the testing procedure.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(e) (2006) (emphasis added). However, it was not\r\nuntil closing arguments that Petitioner moved to rescind his license suspension,\r\nclaiming the Department failed to produce evidence that the test was administered\r\n\nin accordance with the procedures set forth in section 56-5-2950(a) due to its\r\nfailure to perform the simulator test.\r\n\r\n       We agree with the ALC that, in order for the Hearing Officer to consider the\r\n\"provisions\" of section 56-5-2950, a motion must be made for their consideration.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(e) (2006) (\"Policies, procedures, and regulations\r\npromulgated by SLED may be reviewed by the trial judge or hearing officer on\r\nmotion of either party.\"); S.C Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(J) (2013) (same). Here, no\r\nsuch motion was made by Petitioner until after the close of evidence in this case.\r\nAt its heart, this is a question of the reliability of the Department's evidence that\r\nPetitioner blew a 0.17% on the breath test. If no motion is made at the appropriate\r\ntime—when the State seeks to introduce that evidence—then the Petitioner has\r\nwaived his opportunity to challenge its reliability.\r\n\r\n       In our opinion, this is the only reading of subsection (e) that gives effect to\r\nthe language that the failure to follow the provisions of section 56-5-2950 \"shall\r\nresult in the exclusion from evidence\" of the test results upon a finding that that the\r\nfailure to follow the provisions \"materially affected the accuracy or reliability of\r\nthe test results or the fairness of the testing procedure.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-\r\n2950(e) (2006) (emphasis added); see also S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2950(J) (2013).\r\nHere, the Department was not provided with the opportunity to meaningfully\r\nrespond to allegations that its tests results were not reliable.10\r\n\r\n      We therefore agree with the ALC's holding that the \"test results cannot be\r\nexcluded simply because an arresting officer failed to testify that a specific\r\nprovision in § 56-5-2950 was followed, unless the motorist makes a motion during\r\nthe hearing requesting the OMVH hearing officer to review such provision and the\r\nhearing officer determines that law enforcement's failure to comply with the\r\n\r\n10Regardless, we believe that there was sufficient evidence offered by the\r\nDepartment that the DataMaster machine was in proper working condition, as\r\nOfficer Wilson testified that the machine \"was functioning properly.\" Moreover,\r\nhe testified that Petitioner's alcohol concentration registered 0.15% or greater on\r\nthe breath test. Petitioner failed to contemporaneously object to either the\r\ntestimony or the reliability of the results offered at trial. Therefore, we find that\r\nthere is evidence in the record to support a finding that the test results were\r\nreliable. See, e.g., State v. Hoffman, 312 S.C. 386, 393, 440 S.E.2d 869, 873\r\n(1994) (\"A contemporaneous objection is required to properly preserve an error for\r\nappellate review.\") (citation omitted).\r\n\nprovision materially affected the accuracy or reliability of the test[] results or the\r\nfairness of the testing procedure.\"  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appeals' decision.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\nopinion. BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which HEARN, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in the majority's decision to affirm the Court\r\nof Appeals. I write separately, however, to emphasize two points. First, it is\r\npatent that an objection to the sufficiency of the evidence made in a closing\r\nargument comes too late. Moreover, to the extent Petitioner's complaint is that the\r\nofficer's testimony relating the Data Master results should not have been admitted,\r\nPetitioner waived his right to make that argument when he failed to object to the\r\ntestimony when it was offered. See State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 589 S.E.2d 6\r\n(2003). The ALC properly found Petitioner did not preserve his objection to the\r\nbreathalyzer results. Second, I adhere to my view that on certiorari to the Court of\r\nAppeals, we review only that decision for errors of law. Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C.\r\n381, 707 S.E.2d 650 (2011) (Pleicones, J., dissenting). Here, the Court of Appeals'\r\nappellate review of the ALC order was confined to a consideration whether it was\r\narbitrary, otherwise an abuse of discretion, unsupported by substantial evidence, or\r\naffected by an error of law. E.g. South Carolina Dep't of Motor Vehicles v.\r\nHoltzclaw, 382 S.C. 344, 675 S.E.2d 756 (Ct. App. 2009). Since the Court of\r\nAppeals committed no error of law in its review of the ALC order, I concur in the\r\nmajority's decision.\r\n\n       JUSTICE BEATTY: I dissent as I believe Petitioner properly preserved a\r\nvalid challenge to the sufficiency of the Department's case. Furthermore, I believe\r\nour standard of review mandates a reversal as there is evidence to support the\r\nHearing Officer's finding that the Department failed to present a prima facie case\r\nto suspend Petitioner's license under section 56-5-2951. Accordingly, I would\r\nreverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and reinstate the Hearing Officer's\r\norder rescinding Petitioner's license suspension.\r\n\r\n                                      I.    Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Error Preservation\r\n\r\n     As an initial matter, I disagree with the majority's decision to affirm the\r\nALC's order on error preservation grounds as Petitioner's challenge to the\r\nDepartment's case was both timely and sufficient.\r\n\r\n       Throughout these proceedings, Petitioner has consistently challenged the\r\nreliability of the breath test results on the ground Officer Wilson failed to present\r\nevidence that the test was administered and the sample obtained in accordance with\r\nsection 56-5-2950. Although the Hearing Officer did not expressly rule on the\r\nDepartment's failure to present evidence as to the simulator solution test, he found\r\nthe Department failed to satisfy its burden of proof as it did not present evidence\r\nthat \"[Officer Wilson] complied with all requirements while administering the\r\nbreath test\" as mandated by section 56-5-2951. Because the Hearing Officer ruled\r\nin favor of Petitioner, he implicitly found the testimony regarding the breath test\r\nresults was unreliable. Accordingly, the issue was raised to and ruled upon by the\r\nHearing Officer. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733\r\n(1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\nbut must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for\r\nappellate review.\"). In view of this favorable ruling, it was not necessary for\r\nPetitioner to request additional conclusions of law from the Hearing Officer in\r\norder to preserve his issues for appellate review. See I'On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.\r\nPleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 419, 526 S.E.2d 716, 723 (2000) (\"It would be inefficient\r\nand pointless to require a respondent to return to the judge and ask for a ruling on\r\nother arguments to preserve them for appellate review.\"). Furthermore, Petitioner\r\nraised this issue as an additional sustaining ground in his brief to the ALC.\r\n\r\n       Finally, as will be more thoroughly discussed, Petitioner's challenge to the\r\nreliability of the test results was timely as he was not objecting to the admissibility\r\nof Officer Wilson's testimony but, rather, whether the Department had met its\r\n\nburden of proof in its case-in-chief. Unlike the majority, I do not believe Petitioner\r\nwas required to raise any challenge until the Department presented a prima facie\r\ncase to support the license suspension. Thus, I would find the Court of Appeals\r\nerred in basing its decision on error preservation grounds as it failed to appreciate\r\nPetitioner's fundamental contention. Finding the issue properly preserved, I turn to\r\na review of Petitioner's substantive challenges to the ALC's order.\r\n\r\nB.    Review of the ALC's Order\r\n\r\n      \"The [OMVH] is authorized to hear contested cases from the Department.\"\r\nS.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. McCarson, 391 S.C. 136, 144, 705 S.E.2d 425, 429\r\n(2011) (citing S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-660 (Supp. 2009) and S.C. Dep't of Motor\r\nVehicles v. Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. 344, 347, 675 S.E.2d 756, 757-58 (Ct. App.\r\n2009)). \"Thus, the [OMVH] is an agency under the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA).\" Id. \"Accordingly, appeals from [the OMVH] must be taken to the ALC.\"\r\nId.     When reviewing the decision of the ALC, an appellate court's standard of\r\nreview is governed by section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 1-23-610 (Supp. 2012). Under section 1-23-610(B) of the APA, an\r\nappellate court may affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings;\r\nor, it may reverse or modify the appealed decision if the appellant's substantive\r\nrights have suffered prejudice because the decision is: (a) in violation of\r\nconstitutional or statutory provisions; (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the\r\nagency; (c) made upon unlawful procedure; (d) affected by other error of law; (e)\r\nclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the\r\nwhole record; or (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion\r\nor clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion. § 1-23-610(B).\r\n\r\n      Although it is clear the Department has the burden of proof in a license\r\nsuspension proceeding,11 the positions of the parties diverge with respect to what\r\nthe Department must prove to establish a prima facie case and when a motorist\r\nmust challenge the sufficiency of the Department's case. In ruling in favor of the\r\nDepartment, I believe the ALC's decision was controlled by errors of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n11Notably, section 56-5-2951(F) now states, \"The Department of Motor Vehicles\r\nand the arresting officer shall have the burden of proof in contested case hearings\r\nconducted pursuant to this section.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-2951(F) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\n       Initially, I believe the ALC and the majority err in their reliance on section\r\n56-5-2950(e) as that provision applies only when a party is raising a substantive\r\nchallenge to the policies, procedures, and regulations promulgated by SLED. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 56-5-2950(e) (2006) (\"Policies, procedures, and regulations\r\npromulgated by SLED may be reviewed by the trial judge or hearing officer on\r\nmotion of either party.\"). Here, contrary to the findings of the majority, Petitioner\r\nmade no such challenge. Instead, he was asserting that the breath test results were\r\nunreliable because there was no evidence that Officer Wilson complied with the\r\nprocedures set forth in section 56-5-2950.\r\n\r\n       Even if a motion was necessary under section 56-5-2950(e) for the Hearing\r\nOfficer to assess the reliability of the breath test results as advocated by the\r\nmajority, Petitioner's closing argument was sufficient to implicate this provision as\r\nhis motion was akin to a directed verdict motion wherein he questioned whether\r\nthe Department followed the procedures of section 56-5-2950.12 See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 56-5-2950(e) (2006) (\"The failure to follow any of these policies,\r\nprocedures, and regulations, or the provisions of this section, shall result in the\r\nexclusion from evidence any test[] results, if the trial judge or hearing officer finds\r\nthat such failure materially affected the accuracy or reliability of the test[] results\r\nor the fairness of the testing procedure.\"); State v. Long, 363 S.C. 360, 363, 610\r\nS.E.2d 809, 811 (2005) (analyzing section 56-5-2950 and stating, \"Part (e)\r\nprovides for judicial or administrative review of regulations, and for the exclusion\r\nof evidence if these regulations are not complied with\").\r\n\r\n      Having found the sufficiency of the Department's case was proper for the\r\nHearing Officer's determination, I next assess what the Department needed to\r\n12 In contrast, the majority maintains that a motion to exclude the breath test\r\nresults due to the Department's failure to comply with the statutory requirements of\r\nsection 56-5-2950 must be made at the precise time the results are offered.\r\nAlthough a contemporaneous objection is generally raised at the time evidence is\r\noffered, this is not the situation presented in the instant case. Here, Petitioner was\r\nnot objecting to Officer Wilson's statement regarding the breath test results.\r\nRather, Petitioner was challenging whether the Department presented sufficient\r\nevidence to satisfy the statutory requirements of section 56-5-2950 to sustain the\r\nsuspension of his license. Thus, similar to a defense motion for a directed verdict,\r\nPetitioner could not move to dismiss the Department's case based on the\r\ninsufficiency of the evidence until the Department rested its case before the\r\nHearing Officer. Accordingly, Petitioner's motion was both timely and\r\nprocedurally proper.\r\n\npresent to set forth a prima facie case under section 56-5-2951 as that section\r\noutlines \"several statutory prerequisites that must be established before a Hearing\r\nOfficer suspends a citizen's driver's license following an arrest for DUI.\"\r\nMcCarson, 391 S.C. at 149, 705 S.E.2d at 431. In doing so, I would note the\r\ncrucial distinctions between a license suspension hearing and a trial for the\r\nunderlying DUI charge. As our appellate courts have explained:\r\n\r\n      [T]he question before the hearing officer was not whether the state\r\n      had proved its case, but whether the arresting officer had probable\r\n      cause to believe [the driver] had committed the offense of driving\r\n      under the influence. This is not a trial in regard to the guilt or\r\n      innocence of the defendant on a DUI charge. Rather, the gravamen\r\n      of the administrative hearing is a determination of the efficacy\r\n      and applicability of the implied consent law. The query posited to\r\n      the administrative hearing officer is: did the person violate the\r\n      implied consent law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 525, 613 S.E.2d 544, 550\r\n(Ct. App. 2005) (citation omitted) (second emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Here, Petitioner's fundamental challenge was to the reliability of the breath\r\ntest results. In section 56-5-2951(F)(4), the General Assembly has identified, in\r\nthe conjunctive, four foundational requirements for breath test results. Petitioner\r\nclaimed the Department failed to offer evidence as to subsection (F)(4)(c), which\r\nrequires that \"tests administered and samples obtained were conducted pursuant to\r\nSection 56-5-2950.\" Specifically, whether a simulator test was performed before\r\nOfficer Wilson administered the actual test.\r\n\r\n       As noted by the Hearing Officer, the Department did not introduce the actual\r\ntest results but relied exclusively on Officer Wilson's scant testimony. In the\r\nabsence of other evidence, the Hearing Officer rejected the 0.17 reading claimed\r\nby Officer Wilson as there was no way to determine the accuracy and reliability of\r\nthe blood-alcohol analysis. See State v. Huntley, 349 S.C. 1, 5, 562 S.E.2d 472,\r\n474 (2002) (\"The purpose of a simulator test is to ensure the breathalyzer machine\r\nproduces an accurate, reliable breath-alcohol reading, and ultimately, an accurate\r\nblood-alcohol analysis.\").\r\n\r\n      I would decline to reverse this conclusion as the Hearing Officer is the\r\nultimate fact finder in a license suspension proceeding. See White v. S.C. Dep't of\r\nHighways & Pub. Transp., 278 S.C. 603, 606, 299 S.E.2d 852, 853 (1983) (finding\r\n\nthat factual determinations in license suspension proceeding was the \"work of the\r\nadministrative hearing officer\" and should not be reversed by the circuit court or\r\nthe appellate court \"if there is substantial evidence to support the hearing officer's\r\nfindings and conclusions\").13\r\n\r\n       Without reliable evidence as to the amount of Petitioner's blood alcohol\r\nconcentration, the Department failed to establish a prima facie case under section\r\n56-5-2951 to sustain the license suspension. Accordingly, it was not necessary for\r\nPetitioner to rebut the Department's evidence as the burden of production never\r\nshifted to Petitioner.14 See Lawson v. Dir. of Revenue, 145 S.W.3d 443, 445-46\r\n(Mo. Ct. App. 2004) (holding that evidence did not support suspension of driver's\r\nlicense and stating, \"The Director has the burden to present a prima facie case. If\r\nthat threshold is met, the driver is entitled to present evidence in an attempt to\r\nrebut the Director's prima facie case. While the burden of production shifts to the\r\ndriver when the Director establishes a prima facie case, the burden of persuasion\r\nremains with the Director throughout the proceedings\" (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13 In direct contravention of our standard of review, the majority would reverse the\r\nfindings of the Hearing Officer. Specifically, the majority takes its own view of\r\nthe evidence and finds that \"there was sufficient evidence offered by the\r\nDepartment that the DataMaster machine was in proper working condition.\"\r\nUnlike the majority, I employ our standard of review and conclude that there was\r\nsubstantial evidence to support the Hearing Officer's factual findings and\r\nconclusions.\r\n14 The Department cites this Court's decision in State v. Parker, 271 S.C. 159, 245\r\nS.E.2d 904 (1978), for the proposition that Officer Wilson's testimony that \"the\r\nmachine was functioning properly\" was sufficient to sustain the license suspension.\r\nThe Department maintains this uncontroverted testimony constituted prima facie\r\nevidence the breathalyzer test was administered by a qualified person in a proper\r\nmanner as required by section 56-5-2950(a). I believe the Department's reliance on\r\nParker is misplaced as that case was decided prior to the enactment of the statute at\r\nissue and before this Court's decision in McCarson. Furthermore, in Parker, this\r\nCourt addressed the proper foundation for the introduction of breath test results in\r\na prosecution for DUI rather than a license suspension. Parker, 271 S.C. at 164,\r\n245 S.E.2d at 908; see also State v. Cuccia, 353 S.C. 430, 578 S.E.2d 45 (Ct. App.\r\n2003) (holding that revocation of a driver's license following a DUI arrest is a civil\r\nsanction and not a criminal penalty for double jeopardy purposes).\r\n\n                                 II.    Conclusion\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the majority and the courts below misconstrue Petitioner's\r\nchallenge as one involving the admissibility of evidence. Instead, Petitioner was\r\nchallenging the sufficiency of the Department's evidence rather than the\r\nadmissibility of the 0.17 reading. Stated another way, Petitioner was arguing the\r\nDepartment failed to present a prima facie case as to the statutory prerequisites\r\nnecessary to suspend his license under section 56-5-2951. Thus, whether\r\nPetitioner posited a contemporaneous objection to Officer Wilson's testimony was\r\nnot determinative.\r\n\r\n       As to the merits of Petitioner's appeal, I would hold the ALC and, in turn,\r\nthe Court of Appeals erred in reversing the Hearing Officer's order. In rescinding\r\nPetitioner's license suspension, the Hearing Officer determined that the Department\r\nfailed to present a prima facie case to suspend Petitioner's license under section 56-\r\n5-2951. Specifically, the Hearing Officer rejected the blood alcohol reading\r\nattested to by Officer Wilson as there was no other evidence offered to ensure the\r\naccuracy and reliability of this reading. Because the Hearing Officer was the fact\r\nfinder in this proceeding, I would decline to reverse his conclusion as there is\r\nsubstantial evidence to support his ruling. I emphasize that this decision would\r\nhave no bearing on the viability of the underlying DUI charge and would not\r\npreclude the suspension of Brown's license if he were convicted.\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, I would reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\r\nand reinstate the Hearing Officer's order rescinding Petitioner's license suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27347","title":"State v.

Cook and Deputy Solicitor General J.\r\nEmory Smith, Jr., all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\r\nS. Jahue Moore, Jr., of Moore Taylor & Thomas, PA of\r\nWest Columbia SC, for Respondents Michael Morris\r\nLong and Paul Gwinn.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: These cases ask whether the Attorney General has the\r\nauthority to prosecute cases in magistrate and municipal court. We hold that the\r\nAttorney General, as the chief prosecuting officer for the State of South Carolina,\r\nhas the authority to prosecute cases in magistrate and municipal courts.\r\n\r\n                                       Facts\r\nThe Attorney General petitioned this Court to review two municipal courts' rulings\r\naddressing whether the Attorney General has the authority to prosecute criminal\r\ncases in magistrate and municipal courts.1 This Court granted the request to\r\nconsolidate the cases, stayed the lower court proceedings, and issued a writ of\r\ncertiorari to review this issue.\r\n\r\nThe first case involves the prosecution of Paul Gwinn. The case was brought in the\r\nmunicipal court of Batesburg-Leesville and involves a Criminal Domestic\r\nViolence (CDV) charge under S.C. Code Ann. § 16-25-20(A) (Supp. 2012). When\r\nthe case was called for trial, Mr. Gwinn made a motion that the Attorney General\r\ncould not prosecute the case because the municipal court was not a court of record,\r\nciting S.C. Const. art. V, § 24 (2009). The municipal court found that the Attorney\r\nGeneral could prosecute the case.\r\n\r\nThe second case involves the prosecution of Michael Morris Long.2 The case\r\ninvolves a CDV charge in municipal court for the city of West Columbia. Mr.\r\nLong moved to disqualify the Attorney General's office from prosecuting the case,\r\narguing that the Attorney General is authorized to prosecute cases only in courts of\r\nrecord. The court granted the motion, ruling that the Attorney General did not have\r\nthe authority to prosecute the case under art. V, § 24.\r\n\r\nWe granted certiorari to address whether the Attorney General may prosecute cases\r\nin summary courts.                  Discussion\r\nThe question before this Court is whether the Attorney General may prosecute \n\r\ncases in summary courts without violating art. V, § 24. We hold that art. V, § 24 \n\r\nauthorizes the Attorney General to prosecute cases in summary courts. \n\r\n\r\n  Magistrate and municipal courts will be referred to collectively as summary \n\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\ncourts. \n\r\n2 Both Mr. Long and Mr. Gwinn will be referred to collectively as Respondents. \n\r\n\nRespondents contend that the plain language of art. V, § 24 limits the Attorney\r\nGeneral's prosecutorial authority to \"courts of record,\" and therefore, he or she is\r\nconstitutionally prohibited from prosecuting cases in summary courts. We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nArticle V, § 24 reads in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      …[T]he Attorney General shall be the chief prosecuting officer of the\r\n      State with authority to supervise the prosecution of all criminal cases\r\n      in courts of record.\r\n\r\nWhen this Court is called to interpret our Constitution, it is guided by the principle\r\nthat both the citizenry and the General Assembly have worked to create the\r\ngoverning law. See Miller v. Farr, 243 S.C. 342, 346, 133 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1963)\r\n(noting that the Constitution is construed in light of the intent of its framers and the\r\npeople who adopted it). The Court will look at the “ordinary and popular meaning\r\nof the words used,” Richardson v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 350 S.C. 291, 294, 566\r\nS.E.2d 523, 525 (2002), keeping in mind that amendments to our Constitution\r\nbecome effective largely through the legislative process. Miller, at 347, 133 S.E.2d\r\nat 841. For this reason, the Court applies rules of construction similar to those used\r\nto construe statutes. Fraternal Order of Police v. South Carolina Dept. of Revenue,\r\n352 S.C. 420, 574 S.E.2d 717 (2002).\r\n\r\nLooking to the plain language, art. V, § 24 performs two functions. First, it firmly\r\nestablishes the Attorney General as the chief prosecuting officer of the State of\r\nSouth Carolina for both criminal and civil proceedings. See State ex rel. Mcleod v.\r\nSnipes, 266 S.C. 415, 419, 223 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1976) (\"While [art. V, § 24]\r\ndesignated the Attorney General as the chief prosecuting officer for the first time. .\r\n.\"). Second, art. V, § 24 grants the Attorney General the authority to supervise\r\nprosecutions in \"courts of record.\" 3 At issue here is only the Attorney General's\r\nability to serve as a prosecutor, not his authority to supervise prosecutions.\r\n\r\n\r\n Magistrate and municipal courts are not courts of record. The General Assembly\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\ndetermines whether a court is a court of record. While the General Assembly has\r\nso designated the circuit court, probate court, family court, the court of appeals,\r\nand the Supreme Court, it has not so designated summary courts. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 14-5-10 (1977) (\"The circuit courts herein established shall be courts of\r\nrecord\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 14-23-1120 (Supp. 2012) (\"The court of probate shall\r\nbe a court of record\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 63-3-20(C) (2010) (\"The family courts\r\nshall be courts of record. . .\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 14-8-240 (Supp. 2012)\r\n\nRespondents argue that the use of the phrase \"courts of record\" demonstrates that\r\nthe intent behind art. V, § 24 was to prevent the Attorney General from\r\nprosecuting cases in summary courts. Stated differently, the Respondents argue\r\nthat absence of any mention of \"summary courts\" evidences intent that the\r\nAttorney General would not have authority in \"summary courts.\"4 We disagree.\r\nThe only arguable limitation that the inclusion of \"courts of record\" in art. V, § 24\r\nplaces on the Attorney General is in reference to his supervisory authority. The\r\nConstitutional Amendment's reference to supervisory authority in courts of record\r\nin no way describes or limits the Attorney General's authority to prosecute a case.\r\nSee Segars-Andrews v. Judicial Merit Selection Com'n, 387 S.C. 109, 118, 691\r\nS.E.2d 453, 458 (2010) (stating that constitutional provisions will not be construed\r\nto impose limitations beyond their clear meaning). Accordingly, we hold that art.\r\nV, § 24 does not prevent the Attorney General from prosecuting cases in summary\r\ncourts.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n(recognizing the Court of Appeals as a \"court of record\"); S.C. Code Ann. § 14-3-\r\n410 (1977) (\"The Supreme Court shall be a court of record. . .\"). Additionally, the\r\nGeneral Assembly has designated magistrate proceedings \"as summary.\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 22-3-730 (2007) (\"All proceedings before magistrates shall be\r\nsummary. . .). Furthermore, the General Assembly has distinguished magistrate\r\nand municipal courts from courts of record. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-13-140 (2003)\r\n(\"Any magistrate or recorder or city judge having the powers of magistrates, or any\r\njudge of any court of record…\"); S.C. Code Ann. §1-9-70 (2005) (recognizing\r\nprocedures for emergency interim successors for judges in \"courts of record\" and\r\n\"courts not of record\").\r\n  To the extent that Respondents argue that the General Assembly has limited the\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nAttorney General's authority, the General Assembly may not limit the authority\r\ngranted to the Attorney General through art. V, § 24. State v. Thrift, 312 S.C 282,\r\n440 S.E.2d 341 (1994) (discussing the grant of prosecutorial authority in art. V, §\r\n24, \"[t]his power arises from our constitution and cannot be impaired by\r\nlegislation\"). Accordingly, we do not address the statutory arguments raised by\r\nRespondents.\r\n  Moreover, Respondents' construction would lead to a plainly absurd result. This\r\n5\r\n\r\n\r\nCourt will construe a constitutional amendment in a similar manner as it does a\r\nstatute. Fraternal Order of Police, supra. When construing a statute, this Court\r\nwill reject a meaning when it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could\r\nnot have possibly have been intended by the General Assembly or would defeat the\r\nplain legislative intention. Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C.\r\n\nFurthermore, this Court has always regarded the Attorney General as the State's\r\nchief prosecuting officer with broad common law and statutory authority to\r\nprosecute any case on behalf of the State. State ex rel. Mcleod v. Snipes, 266 S.C.\r\n415, 419, 223 S.E.2d 853, 854 (1976) (recognizing the Attorney General as the\r\nchief \"prosecuting officer of the state\"); see also See State ex rel. Condon v.\r\nHodges, 349 S.C. 232, 240, 562 S.E.2d 623, 627 (2002) (recognizing the Attorney\r\nGeneral as the \"chief law officer of the state\"); State ex rel. Daniel v. Broad River\r\nPower Co., 157 S.C. 1, 153 S.E. 537 (1929); State ex rel. Wolfe v. Sanders, 118\r\nS.C. 498, 110 S.E. 808 (1920).\r\n\r\nFinally, we have held that the enactment of art. V, § 24 represented no practical\r\nchange in the Attorney General's authority, Snipes, 266 S.C. at 419, 223 S.E.2d at\r\n854 (1976) (\"While this constitutional provision designated the Attorney General\r\nas the chief prosecuting officer for the first time, it represented no practical change\r\nin the situation of the Attorney General from that which existed prior to the\r\nadoption of this provision of the Constitution in 1973\"), and this Court\r\nacknowledged more than a century ago that the Attorney General may prosecute\r\ncases in summary court. See State v. Nash, 51 S.C. 319, 28 S.E. 946 (1898) (noting\r\nthat the Attorney General may request a jury in magistrate court). In light of this\r\nCourt's long standing recognition of the broad prosecutorial authority of the\r\nAttorney General and the limited practical effect art. V, § 24 had on that authority,\r\nwe hold that art. V, § 24 does not expressly nor implicitly restrict the Attorney\r\nGeneral from prosecuting cases in summary courts, and that as the \"chief\r\nprosecuting officer\" of the State of South Carolina, the Attorney General may\r\nprosecute cases in summary courts.\r\n\r\nWe therefore uphold the ruling of the municipal court of Batesburg-Leesville,\r\nreverse the ruling of municipal court for the city of West Columbia, lift the stay of\r\nthe proceedings, and remand these cases to proceed in accordance with this\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994). Respondents' reading of art. V, § 24 places\r\nthe Attorney General as the chief prosecuting officer for the State but prevents him\r\nfrom prosecuting a CDV merely because the case is in summary court. We find\r\nthat the framers could not possibly have intended that that the chief prosecuting\r\nofficer of the State cannot prosecute in summary court but a solicitor or a police\r\nofficer can.\r\n\nCONSTITUTION CONSTRUED \n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. \n\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27348","title":"Hudson v.

Hudson v. Lancaster Convalescent Center,\r\n393 S.C. 1, 709 S.E.2d 65 (Ct. App. 2010). We affirm in part, reverse in part and\r\nremand.                              FACTS\r\nThis case comes to the Court after multiple workers compensation\r\nhearings/appeals spanning more than 11 years. In 1997, Frances S. Hudson\r\nsuffered a leg injury while in the scope of her employment with Lancaster\r\nConvalescent Center (Employer) for which it and its insurance carrier Legion\r\naccepted liability. Thereafter, in an October 2001 order, a single commissioner\r\nfound Mrs. Hudson permanently disabled and unable to perform any kind of work\r\ndue to a combination of injuries arising from her 1997 work related injury.\r\n\r\nAfterward, Mrs. Hudson requested, over the objection of Employer and Legion, a\r\nlump-sum payment of her disability award. After a hearing, a single commissioner\r\nissued an order granting Mrs. Hudson's lump-sum request. Employer and Legion\r\nappealed this lump-sum award to the Appellate Panel of the South Carolina\r\nWorkers' Compensation Commission (Appellate Panel). During the pendency of\r\nthis appeal, Mrs. Hudson passed away from cancer unrelated to her workplace\r\ninjury. The Appellate Panel affirmed all of the single commissioner's findings of\r\nfact and conclusions of law.\r\n\r\nFollowing affirmance of the lump-sum award, Legion and Employer appealed to\r\nthe circuit court. While this appeal was pending, Legion became insolvent. As a\r\nresult, the South Carolina Property and Casualty Insurance Guaranty Association\r\n\n(Guaranty) assumed all rights, duties and obligations of Legion pursuant to S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 38-31- 60 (2001).\r\n\r\nGuaranty and Employer appealed to circuit court, arguing that it was error to grant\r\nMrs. Hudson's award in lump-sum, and, that in light of Mrs. Hudson's death, the\r\nentire award must abate. The appeal was heard by the Honorable Paul E. Short,\r\nwho affirmed the Appellate Panel's order in its entirety. Judge Short found that the\r\nlump-sum award was proper and supported by substantial evidence. Concerning\r\nEmployer's and Guaranty's argument that the lump-sum award abated upon Mrs.\r\nHudson's death, Judge Short found the issue was not preserved for review.\r\nHowever, the court went on to find that even if the argument were properly before\r\nthe court, the award would survive Mrs. Hudson's death.\r\n\r\nGuaranty and Employer appealed Judge Short's order to the Court of Appeals but\r\nvoluntarily withdrew their appeal. As a result, the appeal was dismissed and the\r\nremittitur was sent on April 20, 2004.\r\n\r\nDuring the above appeals, Employer and Guaranty stopped making payments after\r\nMrs. Hudson's death. After Employer and Guaranty voluntarily dismissed their\r\nappeal to the Court of Appeals, Petitioner/Respondents, Kenneth and Keith\r\nHudson, as executors and sole beneficiaries of their mother's estate (the Estate),\r\ninitiated this action against Employer and Guaranty, seeking enforcement of the\r\nlump-sum award.\r\n\r\nA dependency hearing was held to determine entitlement to the lump-sum award.1\r\nDespite Judge Short's rulings and the voluntary dismissal of their appeal to the\r\nCourt of Appeals, Employer and Guaranty maintained they were not required to\r\npay the lump-sum award because it abated upon Mrs. Hudson's death. The single\r\ncommissioner found Judge Short's unappealed 2004 order, which found the\r\nabatement argument unpreserved, was the law of the case and could not be\r\nchallenged or relitigated.\r\n\r\nAs to potential beneficiaries, the single commissioner found that all four\r\nbeneficiaries had colorable claims to the lump-sum award, and approved a\r\nsettlement that had been entered into between the Estate and Grandsons under S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 42-9-390 (1976). The settlement divided the award fifty-percent to\r\nthe Estate and fifty-percent to the Grandsons. Additionally, the single\r\n\r\n1At the hearing, the potential beneficiaries' included Kenneth and Keith Hudson,\r\nas well as Andrew Dees and Mathew Pope, hereinafter Grandsons. Both Grandsons\r\nwere found to be dependent, to some extent, upon Mrs. Hudson for support.\r\n\ncommissioner imposed interest on the award and a ten-percent penalty against\r\nGuaranty.\r\n\r\nEmployer and Guaranty appealed to the Appellate Panel, which affirmed all of the\r\nsingle commissioner's factual findings and conclusions of law with the exception\r\nof the ten-percent penalty. Specifically, the Appellate Panel noted that Guaranty\r\nand Legion \"did not pursue a frivolous defense,\" and therefore concluded that no\r\npenalty should be imposed.\r\n\r\nThereafter, the Estate, Employer, and Guaranty cross-appealed to the circuit court.\r\nThe Honorable Kenneth E. Goode heard the appeal and issued an order affirming\r\nthe Appellate Panel with the exception of the ten-percent penalty. Judge Goode\r\nreinstated the ten-percent penalty finding that S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-90 (1976)\r\nmandated a penalty in this case.\r\n\r\nEmployer and Guaranty appealed. The Court of Appeals refused to address their\r\nargument that the award abated, holding that Judge Short's ruling was the law of\r\nthe case. Additionally, the Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court's imposition\r\nof the ten-percent penalty, but reversed the imposition of interest on the lump-sum\r\naward. It concluded that under S.C. Code Ann. § 38-31-60 (2001), Guaranty was\r\nonly liable for \"covered claims\" which do not include claims for interest.\r\nAdditionally, the Court of Appeals reversed the Judge Goode's ruling upholding\r\nthe settlement which divided half of the lump-sum award to the Estate and half to\r\nthe Grandsons.\r\n\r\nThereafter, this Court granted Employer's, Guaranty's, and Estate's petitions for\r\nwrit of certiorari.                    ISSUES\r\n   I.\t     Does the law of the case doctrine prevent the Court from reaching the\r\n           merits of Respondents/Petitioners' argument that the lump-sum award\r\n           abated upon Mrs. Hudson's death?\r\n\r\n   II.\t    Does S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-280 (1976) require that the settlement\r\n           approved by the Commission be set aside, and the entire lump-sum award\r\n           be distributed to Mrs. Hudson's dependent grandsons as her \"next of kin\r\n           dependents?\"\r\n\r\n   III.\t   Is an assessment of interest on this award appropriate?\r\n\n     IV.\t   Is imposition of a ten-percent penalty under S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-90\r\n            (1976) appropriate?    DISCUSSION\r\n\r\n     I.\t    Abatement\r\nEmployer and Guaranty contend that the Court of Appeals erred by not reaching\r\nthe merits of their abatement argument because Judge Short's ruling should not\r\nhave been the law of the case. We disagree.\r\n\r\nJudge Short's 2004 order found the abatement issue unpreserved because Employer\r\nand Guaranty failed to raise it to the Appellate Panel. Employer and Guaranty\r\nappealed this order but later withdrew their appeal. Under the law of the case\r\ndoctrine, a party is precluded from re-litigating issues decided in a lower court\r\norder, when the party voluntarily abandons its appeal of that order. Judy v. Martin,\r\n381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153 (2009) (holding that Appellant may not\r\nseek relief from a prior unappealed order of the circuit court because the ruling has\r\nbecome the law of the case); In re Morrison, 321 S.C. 370 n. 2, 468 S.E.2d 651 n.\r\n2 (1996) (noting that an unappealed ruling becomes the law of the case and\r\nprecludes further consideration of the issue on appeal); Watkins v. Hodge, 232\r\nS.C. 245, 247–48, 101 S.E.2d 657, 658 (1958) (refusing to consider jurisdictional\r\nmatter of underlying case where issue had been ruled upon and not challenged on\r\nappeal). Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals' holding that Judge Short's\r\nruling that the abatement issue was unpreserved is the law of the case.\r\n\r\n     II.\t   Distribution\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that pursuant to § 42-9-2802 all of the unpaid balance\r\nof the lump-sum award must be paid to Grandsons as her next of kin dependents.\r\nAs a result, the Court of Appeals reversed the circuit court order that upheld the\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Section 42-9-280 provides:\r\n               When an employee receives or is entitled to\r\n               compensation under this Title for an injury covered by\r\n               the second paragraph of § 42-9-10…payment of the\r\n               unpaid balance of compensation shall be made to his next\r\n               of kin dependent upon him for support…\r\n\nAppellate Panel's approval of the settlement between the Estate and Grandsons.3\r\nThe Estate argues this was error. We agree.\r\n\r\nOur courts have a long standing policy favoring settlements See, Darden v.\r\nWitham, 258 S.C. 380, 388, 188 S.E.2d 776, 778 (1972) (\"The courts favor\r\nsettlements and agreements amongst litigants\"). This Court has recognized, “that\r\nlitigants are free to devise a settlement agreement in any manner that does not\r\ncontravene public policy or the law.” Poston v. Barnes, 294 S.C. 261, 264, 363\r\nS.E.2d 888, 890 (1987). Given that all potential beneficiaries agreed to the\r\nsettlement, it was approved pursuant to the procedure in S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-\r\n390, and nothing in § 42-9-280 prevents a potential beneficiary from structuring a\r\nsettlement as to how their award will be distributed, we agree with the Estate that\r\nthe Court of Appeals erred in reversing the circuit court order.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the only parties challenging this settlement are Guaranty and\r\nEmployer, neither of whom were aggrieved in any way by the settlement\r\nagreement.4 Therefore, they could not properly appeal the circuit court order\r\napproving the settlement agreement. Rule 201 SCACR (\"Only a party aggrieved by\r\nan order, judgment, sentence or decision may appeal.) The Court of Appeals erred\r\nin even addressing this issue much less reversing the circuit court on an issue\r\nraised by a non-aggrieved party. Cisson v. McWhorter, 255 S.C. 174, 178, 177\r\nS.E.2d 603, 605 (1970) (noting that it is an appellate court's \"duty to reject an\r\nappeal that is prosecuted by a party who is not aggrieved in a legal sense by the\r\njudgment of the trial court\"). Thus, we reverse the Court of Appeals and reinstate\r\nthe settlement.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3 Both Grandsons were represented by Guardians ad Litem who agreed with the\r\nEstate that to prevent a financial dispute within the family, the best disposition of\r\nthis issue was to come to a settlement agreement.\r\n4 During oral arguments, Guaranty and Employer conceded that they would not be\r\nharmed by this settlement.\r\n5 In light of our disposition of this issue, we need not address the Estate's or\r\nGuaranty's arguments regarding the applicability of § 42-9-280 to this lump-sum\r\naward. Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518\r\nS.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (\"In light of our disposition of the case, it is not necessary\r\nto address [the] remaining issues\").\r\n\n    III.   Interest\r\nInterest was imposed on the lump-sum award by the Appellate Panel under S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 42-9-240 (1976), which provides:\r\n\r\n           …[C]ompensation payable under the terms of an award by\r\n           the Commission or…a judgment of a court upon an\r\n           appeal...shall become due seven days from the date…of such\r\n           a judgment of the court, on which date all compensation due\r\n           shall be paid, including interest from the original date of the\r\n           award at the maximum legal rate.\"\r\n\r\nThe circuit court upheld the imposition of interest. The Court of Appeals, however,\r\nreversed the grant of interest, explaining that Guaranty is only responsible for\r\n\"covered claims\" under S.C. Code Ann. § 38-31-60(b) (Supp. 2009),6 and S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 38-31-20(8)(h) (Supp. 2009) expressly provides that \"covered\r\nclaim…does not include…(h) any claims of interest.\" The Estate argues this was\r\nerror, and we agree.\r\n\r\nThe Estate contends that while Guaranty's derivative liability for Legion's action is\r\nlimited to \"covered claims\", its direct liability for its own misconduct is not. Thus,\r\nthe imposition of interest is proper due to Guaranty's direct liability arising from its\r\nfailure to timely pay the lump-sum award.\r\n\r\nTo address this argument we must examine two issues. First, whether Guaranty\r\nmay be held directly liable for its own conduct, and second, if Guaranty may be\r\nheld directly liable, is this liability limited to \"covered claims?\"\r\n\r\n    The Estate supports its argument that Guaranty may be held directly liable by\r\nciting to the \"may sue or be sued\" language in S.C. Code Ann. § 38-31-60(j)\r\n(1976), which provides:\r\n\r\n           [Guaranty] may sue or be sued provided, however, that any\r\n           action brought directly against the association must be\r\n           brought against the association in the State of South\r\n           Carolina as a condition precedent to recovery directly\r\n           against the association.\r\n\r\n\r\n6Section 38-31-60(b) provides in relevant part that the Guaranty Association \"…is\r\nconsidered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered claims…\"\r\n\n    The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintent of the legislature. Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget and Control\r\nBd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993). “What a legislature says in the text of a\r\nstatute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Therefore,\r\nthe courts are bound to give effect to the expressed intent of the legislature.”\r\nHodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (citing Norman J.\r\nSinger, Sutherland Statutory Construction § 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992). Under the\r\nplain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the meaning of a clear and\r\nunambiguous statute. In re Vincent J., 333 S.C. 233, 509 (1998) (citations omitted).\r\nWhen a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and\r\ndefinite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed, and this court\r\nhas no right to impose another meaning. Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina\r\nv. State, 372 S.C. 519, 525, 642 S.E.2d 751, 754 (2007).\r\n\r\n    The \"may sue or be sued\" language of § 38-31-60(j) is clear indication of the\r\nlegislature's intent for Guaranty to both enforce its own direct claims, and be held\r\ndirectly liable for its own actions. Thus, we hold that Guaranty may be held\r\ndirectly liable for its own actions.\r\n\r\nWe note Guaranty contends that even if interest could be imposed, no direct action\r\nhas been brought against Guaranty; thus, the prerequisite to hold Guaranty directly\r\nliable under § 38-31-60(j) has not been satisfied.\r\n\r\nWe agree that the language, \"…provided, however, that any action brought directly\r\nagainst the association must be brought against the association in the State of South\r\nCarolina as a condition precedent to recovery directly against the association\" of §\r\n38-31-60(j), requires that a direct action be brought against the Guaranty before\r\none can recover directly against it. However, we disagree with the assertion that no\r\ndirect action has been brought against Guaranty.\r\n\r\nAfter the Court of Appeals ordered the dismissal and remittitur of Employer's and\r\nthe Guaranty's first round of appeals, a dependency hearing was held. The only\r\nparties at the hearing were Employer, Guaranty, the Estate, and the Grandsons.\r\nThis dependency hearing served multiple purposes. Along with determining\r\ndependency, the Estate was seeking to enforce the prior orders requiring that Mrs.\r\nHudson's lump-sum be paid, as well as sanctions against Employer and Guaranty.7\r\nSince this is a workers' compensation case, the Commission was the only\r\nappropriate forum through which the Estate could attempt to enforce these orders\r\n\r\n7The Estate and Grandsons also requested that the lump-sum award be distributed\r\npursuant to their settlement.\r\n\nagainst Guaranty. Posey v. Proper Mold & Engineering, Inc., 378 S.C. 210, 223,\r\n661 S.E.2d 395, 401 (2008) (\"The General Assembly has vested the South\r\nCarolina Workers' Compensation Commission with exclusive original jurisdiction\r\nover employees work-related injuries\") (citing Sabb v. South Carolina State\r\nUniversity, 350 S.C. 416, 423, 567 S.E.2d 231, 234 (2002)). At this hearing,\r\nGuaranty was present as a result of its own refusal to pay the lump-sum award not\r\nthrough the derivative liability of an insolvent insurer. We hold that this satisfies\r\nthe direct action prerequisite present in § 42-9-240. Therefore, we must determine\r\nif the \"covered claims\" claims limitation applies to Guaranty's direct liability.\r\n\r\nGuaranty is a last resort insurer created by the legislature to protect consumers in\r\nthe event that their insurer becomes insolvent. See § 38-31-60; South Carolina\r\nProperty and Cas. Ins. Guar. Ass'n v. Carolinas Roofing and Sheet Metal\r\nContractors Self -Insurance Fund, 315 S.C. 555, 557, 446 S.E.2d 422, 424\r\n(1994)(\"[Guaranty's] purpose is to provide some protection to insureds whose\r\ninsurance companies become insolvent\"). Section 38-31-60(b) provides that\r\nGuaranty \"is considered the insurer to the extent of its obligation on the covered\r\nclaims and, to this extent, has all rights, duties, and obligations of the insolvent\r\ninsurer as if the insurer had not become insolvent….\" When Guaranty steps into\r\nthe shoes of an insolvent insurer, its liability is derivative of the insolvent\r\ninsurance company's direct liability to the consumer. The legislature has limited\r\nthis liability to a \"covered claim\" which is defined by § 38-31-20(8) as \"…an\r\nunpaid claim…which arises out of…an insurance policy to which this chapter\r\napplies issued by an insurer, if the insurer is an insolvent insurer…covered claim\r\ndoes not include:…(h) any claim for interest.\"\r\n\r\nThe legislature has chosen to define a \"covered claim\" as a claim arising from an\r\ninsolvent insurer, yet Guaranty asks this Court to read the \"covered claims\" and its\r\ncorresponding interest limitation to apply to claims arising from Guaranty's own\r\nactions. We decline to do so.\r\n\r\nThe legislature has provided that Guaranty may be held directly liable for its own\r\nactions in § 38-31-60(j), yet there is no such \"covered claims\" limitation for\r\nGuaranty's direct liability. Nor is there any reference to Guaranty's direct liability\r\nin the definition of \"covered claims.\" It is axiomatic that “words in a statute must\r\nbe construed in context,” and “the meaning of particular terms in a statute may be\r\nascertained by reference to words associated with them in the statute.” Eagle\r\nContainer Co., LLC v. County of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 570, 666 S.E.2d 892,\r\n895 (2008) (citing Mut. Church Ins. Co. v. S.C. Windstorm & Hail Underwriting\r\nAss'n, 306 S.C. 339, 342, 412 S.E.2d 377, 379 (1991)). Further, statutes must be\r\nread as a whole and sections which are part of the same general statutory scheme\r\n\nmust be construed together and each given effect, if it can be done by any\r\nreasonable construction. Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 415 S.E.2d 799 (1992).\r\n\r\nReading both the covered claims and direct liability statutes together, § 38-31-\r\n20(8), cannot be construed as limiting a claim arising from Guaranty's own action.\r\nThus, we hold that the \"covered claim\" limitation, applies only in the context of\r\nclaims deriving from insolvent insurance carrier's policies, and hold that when a\r\nclaim is brought directly against Guaranty, it will not be limited to \"covered\r\nclaims.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we find that interest may be assessed against Guaranty, when liability\r\nresults from Guaranty's own actions. In this case, after the first round of appeals\r\nwere abandoned, liability for this lump-sum award was conclusively established.\r\nGuaranty's subsequent failure to timely pay this lump-sum award can only be\r\nattributed to its own conduct. Therefore, a claim for interest under § 42-9-240 is\r\nappropriate in this case because Guaranty's liability for the accrued interest does\r\nnot arise from a \"covered claim.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we hold that an imposition of interest is appropriate in this case. We\r\nnote that § 42-9-240 allows for interest to accrue from the date of the original\r\njudgment. However, as stated above, interest is only appropriate for Guaranty\r\nwhen associated with direct liability. As a result, the Guaranty will only be\r\nresponsible for interest from the date that this lump-sum award became final,\r\nwhich under the statute is April 27, 2004, seven days from the date of the order of\r\nremittitur from the Court of Appeals.8 See § 42-9-240 (\"an award by the\r\nCommission or under the terms of a judgment of a court upon an appeal from such\r\nan award shall become due seven days from the date of such an award or from the\r\ndate of such a judgment of the court.\") Consequently, we reverse the Court of\r\nAppeal's holding that interest is inappropriate in this case and hold that Guaranty is\r\nresponsible for interest on this lump-sum award at the \"maximum legal rate\"\r\naccruing from April 27, 2004. We therefore remand the matter to the Commission\r\nfor calculation of the interest due on the lump-sum award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n8The Court of Appeal's order of dismissal and remittitur was issued on April 20,\r\n2004.\r\n\n    IV.   Penalty\r\n\r\n   Finally, Guaranty contends that the Court of Appeals erred in affirming Judge\r\nGoode's order construing § 42-9-90 as requiring a mandatory penalty.9 Guaranty\r\npresents two arguments to support its contention: (1) the circuit court exceeded its\r\nscope of review by making his own factual findings to impose the penalty; and (2)\r\nthe circuit court erred in reversing the Appellate Panel because Guaranty was\r\nexcused from payment due to the uncertainty of who was entitled to this lump-sum\r\naward. We disagree on both points.\r\n\r\n   First, the circuit court did not make any improper factual findings. The circuit\r\ncourt merely applied § 42-9-90 to the Appellate Panel's factual findings and found\r\nthe statute mandated a penalty in this case.\r\n\r\n  Second, we agree with the Court of Appeals and the circuit court that the\r\nAppellate Panel abused its discretion in declining to impose a penalty.\r\n\r\n    Section 42-9-90 provides:\r\n\r\n             …if any installment of compensation…is not paid within\r\n             fourteen days after it is due, … there shall be added to such\r\n             unpaid installment an amount equal to ten per cent thereof,\r\n             which shall be paid… unless such nonpayment is excused by\r\n             the Commission after a showing by the employer that owing to\r\n             conditions over which he had no control such installment could\r\n             not be paid within the period prescribed for the payment.\r\n\r\n    Section 42-9-90, permits excusal of this penalty only after there is a showing of\r\ncircumstances beyond the employer's control excusing non-payment. Applying §\r\n42-9-90, the Appellate Panel stated \"no penalties should be assessed, as\r\nDefendant's did not pursue a frivolous defense.\" This is the only finding or analysis\r\n\r\n\r\n9The ten-percent penalty was first imposed by the single commissioner at the\r\ndependency hearing. On appeal the Appellate Panel reversed, stating that the\r\npenalty should not be assessed because the Guaranty Association and Employer\r\n\"did not pursue a frivolous defense.\" The penalty was reinstated by Judge Goode,\r\nwhich held that § 42-9-90 mandates the penalty any time compensation is not paid\r\nwithin fourteen days of becoming due, citing Martin v. Rapid Plumbing 369 S.C.\r\n278, 631 S.E.2d 547 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\nin the order justifying excusal of the penalty. Under § 42-9-90, a demonstration of\r\na non-frivolous defense does not excuse imposition of this penalty. Only a showing\r\nof circumstances beyond Guaranty's control preventing them from timely paying\r\nthis award would excuse this penalty. From the Appellate Panels finding there is\r\nno indication of circumstances beyond Guaranty's control which prevented it from\r\npaying. Thus, Appellate Panel abused its discretion in declining to apply this\r\npenalty. Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appeal's decision to uphold the circuit\r\ncourt's ruling that the Appellate Panel abused its discretion in removing the ten-\r\npercent penalty.10\r\n\r\n     V.   Conclusion\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals' decision that Judge Short's order was the law of\r\nthe case on the abatement issue. We also affirm the Court of Appeals holding that\r\nthe ten-percent penalty should be imposed in this case. We reverse the Court of\r\nAppeals decision requiring the entire lump-sum award be paid to the Grandsons,\r\nand reinstate the Estate's and Grandsons' settlement. We also reverse the Court of\r\nAppeals decision to remove the assessment of interest, and hold that Guaranty is\r\nresponsible for interest running from April 27, 2004. Finally, we remand this case\r\nto the Commission to calculate the sums due pursuant to this opinion.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  We note that the ten-percent penalty applies to the original lump sum award.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy\r\nAttorney General Donald J. Zelenka and Senior Assistant\r\nAttorney General Melody Jane Brown, all of Columbia,\r\nand Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, for\r\nRespondent.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: Appellant was convicted of kidnapping and murdering\r\nSamuel Sturrup (victim). The jury found two aggravating circumstances,\r\nkidnapping1 and physical torture,2 and recommended a death sentence. The judge\r\nsentenced appellant to death for the murder, and imposed no sentence for the\r\nkidnapping. On appeal, appellant contends the trial court erred in permitting his\r\nattorney to call a defense psychiatrist to testify regarding appellant's right to\r\nrepresent himself and in denying his Faretta3 request, in limiting voir dire and in\r\nqualifying Juror #203, and in refusing to dismiss the indictments because of the\r\nState's failure to comply with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers (IAD) Act.4\r\nWe find the trial judge applied the incorrect competency standard in denying\r\nappellant's Faretta request and reverse.\r\n\r\n                                      FACTS\r\n\r\nAppellant was approximately twenty-three years old and living in Augusta,\r\nGeorgia, where he surrounded himself with high school students. Two of the high\r\nschool boys, Richard Cave and Antonio (Tony) Griffin testified that on Labor Day\r\n2001, appellant called them to meet him at his \"green house\" in Augusta. The boys\r\nwere high school seniors, who enjoyed hanging out with appellant because, as\r\nCave testified, appellant had money, girls, and cars. When Cave and Griffin\r\narrived, they found victim already there, along with Charlene \"China\" Thatcher\r\nand appellant's younger half-brother William Harris.\r\n\r\nAppellant accused victim of stealing appellant's money, and was beating the victim\r\nwith his fists, a pole, and a shock absorber. China was also accused and hit, and\r\nGriffin obeyed appellant's order to beat victim. As the night progressed, Harris left\r\nand appellant called two South Carolina brothers, the Hunsbergers, to come to the\r\ngreen house in Augusta. After the Hunsbergers arrived, everyone left for South\r\nCarolina. Appellant, China, Griffin, and Cave followed the Hunsbergers in\r\nappellant's car, with the victim in their car trunk, to a remote area of Edgefield\r\nCounty. There, appellant ordered China, Griffin, and Cave to shoot the victim,\r\nwith appellant administering the coup de grace. Appellant told the others they\r\nwere as guilty as he, and all kept quiet until parts of victim's skeleton and other\r\nidentifying information were found in November 2001.\r\n\r\n1 S.C.

(2003).\r\n\nChina, Griffin, and Cave, all of whom testified in the guilt phase, were serving\r\neighteen-year sentences in Georgia for their assault of victim and faced the\r\npotential for additional charges in Georgia and South Carolina.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUE\r\n\r\n             Did the trial judge commit reversible error in denying\r\n             appellant's request to waive counsel and proceed pro se?\r\n\r\n                                    ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nAppellant, whose competency to stand trial has never been in question, moved to\r\nbe allowed to proceed pro se on the Friday before the trial was to commence on\r\nMonday, citing Faretta. Appellant was unequivocal that he was not seeking a\r\ndelay or a continuance. He asked for all relevant documents to be provided for his\r\nreview, and asked if he could possibly subpoena the Hunsbergers who were\r\nincarcerated in Georgia. After being placed under oath, appellant told the court he\r\nwas thirty-two years old, had an 11th grade education, had been self-employed,\r\nand that he understood the charges against him and the possible sentences. He\r\nacknowledged having had an attorney in his other criminal cases, including one\r\nbefore this same judge.5 Appellant acknowledged he understood he would be held\r\nto the same standards as an attorney regarding the rules of court and of evidence.\r\n\r\nThe trial judge questioned appellant under oath about a specific rule of evidence,\r\nhis understanding of the prohibition of hybrid representation, his current mental\r\nhealth status,6 and his familiarity with courtroom procedure and prior experience as\r\na criminal defendant. Appellant demonstrated an understanding of the process of\r\ncapital voir dire, stated his intention to pursue a third-party guilt defense at trial\r\nand discussed the relevant case law, the burden of proof, and his right to testify.\r\n\r\n5 This is a reference to appellant's conviction for throwing urine on an Edgefield\r\njailer. This Court granted certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' affirmance of\r\nappellant's conviction and reversed. State v. Barnes, 402 S.C. 135, 739 S.E.2d 629\r\n(2013).\r\n6 Appellant acknowledged having been treated for post-traumatic stress disorder\r\nafter being tased by jailors. He testified that while that incident had led to\r\ncounseling, and that he had suffered \"mental health while [he] was younger,\" he\r\nwas currently well.\r\n\nAppellant also appeared to be familiar with the niceties of error preservation, for\r\nexample, the need to place objections and the court's rulings on the record.\r\n\r\nThe judge then inquired into appellant's reasons for wanting to proceed pro se.\r\nAppellant answered that his request to proceed pro se was driven by trust issues,\r\nand that he had another attorney or two in mind to use as standby counsel in lieu of\r\nhis appointed attorneys. As an example of the disagreement between appellant and\r\nhis attorneys leading to his loss of trust in them was their decision not to subpoena\r\nthe Hunsberger brothers because of counsels' belief that the brothers would invoke\r\ntheir Fifth Amendment right not to testify. Appellant explained that if the brothers\r\ndid decline to testify, then he would use transcripts of their sworn testimony in the\r\nGeorgia proceedings under Rule 804(3), SCRE. Appellant also explained his\r\nintent to refer to himself in the third person when examining witnesses. Finally,\r\nappellant explained that he lost trust in his appointed attorneys because while he\r\nhad instructed them not to move for a continuance in order to preserve his IAD Act\r\nrequest, he had learned that they had made such requests.\r\n\r\nThe judge concluded by telling appellant, \"I think you're making a mistake, but\r\nyou have the right to make a mistake. I think you're making an unwise choice, but\r\nyou have the right to make an unwise choice. I would advise you not to do this . . .\r\n.\" The judge asked appellant to reconsider the decision and discuss it again with\r\nhis appointed attorneys. Appellant agreed to do so. After a break, the judge told\r\nthe attorneys to provide the discovery materials to appellant for his review over the\r\nweekend, and announced he was taking the Faretta motion under advisement until\r\nMonday.\r\n\r\nOn Monday, the judge qualified the venire and set up voir dire panels before taking\r\nup the Faretta request.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the hearing, one of appellant's attorneys (Tarr) referred\r\nthe court to Indiana v. Edwards, 554 U.S. 164 (2008), which holds that a state may\r\nhold a defendant who seeks to represent himself at trial to a higher competency\r\nstandard than that required to stand trial. Tarr stated that \"a couple of different\r\nexperts that we've hired to evaluate [appellant] for purposes of the sentence phase\r\nare of the opinion that he is very competent to stand trial, but he lacks the\r\ncompetency to waive his right to counsel and conduct the proceedings on his own.\"\r\nTarr had Dr. Price, a psychologist previously retained by the defense as a\r\nmitigation witness, present and ready to testify regarding appellant's competency.\r\n\nAppellant immediately objected to Dr. Price's testimony. First, he based his\r\nobjection on the \"doctor/client\" relationship and the attendant privilege. He\r\nexplained that he talked to Dr. Price only for penalty phase mitigation purposes,\r\nand stated, \"If I'd have known that he was going to be adverse to me, I wouldn't\r\nhave talked to him.\" Appellant then distinguished Edwards, pointing out that the\r\ndefendant in that case was before the trial judge on his second or third competency\r\nto stand trial hearing when the waiver of counsel issue arose. Appellant continued:\r\n\r\n             In this case here, you know, this was never an issue. I brung\r\n             forth to you – I explained to you in detail when you asked me\r\n             questions the last time we spoke and I brought forth everything,\r\n             you know, just like you asked me to do. And the Edwards case\r\n             is totally different from the factual situation of my case.\r\n\r\n             And I object to Dr. Price getting on the stand, because, like I\r\n             say, I'm not giving him no permission to say anything in\r\n             regards to me, talking about me, because like I say, my\r\n             attorneys, that's part of my defense, you know, when we get to\r\n             the penalty phase. Once we get to that phase, then, you know, I\r\n             consent for him to furnish that information to the jury for\r\n             migation [sic].\r\n\r\nThe judge then asked if appellant was asking him to make a decision without\r\nadequate information. Appellant answered with a qualified yes, saying that he was\r\nentitled to due process and specifically denying his permission for Dr. Price to\r\ntestify about \"things that had been in [appellant's] mental records for years.\" He\r\nagain emphasized the doctor/client relationship, and that Dr. Price represented him.\r\nTarr stated that neither he nor Mr. Harte (the lead attorney) nor Dr. Price were\r\n\"trying to be adversarial\" but were instead trying to make the court aware of all the\r\nissues. Appellant again objected to any expert testimony from Dr. Price except in\r\nthe penalty phase and suggested, \"if you appoint a state official to conduct that\r\n[competency to waive counsel] review, then that's a different story.\" The judge\r\nresponded that he did not know of any procedure that would allow him to do so.7\r\nAttorney Harte responded that since Edwards failed to state the standard for\r\n\r\n7A trial judge has the inherent authority to order an independent examination of a\r\ncriminal defendant where necessary. Cf. State v. Cooper, 342 S.C. 389, 536 S.E.2d\r\n870 (2000) (trial judge has inherent authority to require expert examination of\r\ndefendant and order state to pay in order to maintain integrity of judicial process).\r\n\ncompetency to waive, it did not seem possible to order an evaluation. Appellant\r\nreiterated that the question was Faretta because his was not an Edwards situation\r\nas there is no indication that he, unlike the defendant Edwards, is \"sick.\"\r\n\r\nFollowing Dr. Price's testimony, the trial judge denied appellant's request to\r\nproceed pro se based upon a finding that appellant did not meet the heightened\r\nEdwards standard for competency to represent himself at trial. The judge then\r\nnoted that despite appellant's responses to the Faretta inquiry on Friday, the judge\r\nwas concerned by Dr. Price's testimony regarding appellant's competency.\r\nUltimately he ruled:\r\n\r\n             Given the doctor's testimony and his expert opinion that the\r\n             defendant has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right\r\n             to counsel,8 I find the defendant does not have a clear\r\n             understanding of the dangers of self-representation in the guilt\r\n             nor the sentencing phase of the trial.\r\n\r\n             I further find that the defendant does not knowingly,\r\n             intelligently understand the dangers inherent in self-\r\n             representation. I feel like I would not be fulfilling my\r\n             responsibilities under the law to an individual that deserves a\r\n             fair trial if I allow on this record, and I might add, my\r\n             observations of Mr. Barnes.\r\n\r\n             Mr. Barnes has always been during these proceedings respectful\r\n             to this Court and I've noted him to appear to be respectful,\r\n             although not necessarily pleased at times, with his attorneys.\r\n             However, he is prone to ramble. He's prone to act extra-\r\n             judicious, and by that I mean not appropriate, but to act as if he\r\n             were conducting his defense on the streets, so to speak, and as\r\n             we all know, the courtroom is not the place for that kind of\r\n             decorum or demeanor. I think it would be abuse of my\r\n             discretion to allow him to represent himself in trying to do all I\r\n             can do to make sure Mr. Barnes in this very serious matter gets\r\n             a fair trial. So I'm denying your motion.\r\n\r\n8Note this is not the proper inquiry under Edwards, which does not involve the\r\nmerits of the Faretta waiver but rather the defendant's competency to represent\r\nhimself at trial.\r\n\n                And I might add, I have not seen anything but his attorneys\r\n                acting in his best interest throughout the proceedings, both\r\n                during the requests or expertise, motion hearings, status\r\n                conferences and otherwise.\r\n\r\n                Further, I would find that it appears Dr. Price also to be acting\r\n                not in Dr. Price's best interest but in Mr. Barnes' best interest.\r\n\r\n                With that being said, I will deny Mr. Barnes' motion under\r\n                Faretta versus California and deny his right to self-\r\n                representation and reaffirm the Court's appointment of Mr. Tarr\r\n                and Mr. Harte.\r\n\r\nThe dispositive issue in this appeal is whether South Carolina will adopt the higher\r\ncompetency standard permitted by Edwards and thus alter the traditional Faretta\r\nthreshold inquiry which permits any defendant competent to stand trial to waive\r\nhis right to counsel. Since we choose not to adopt Edwards' higher standard for\r\ncompetency to represent oneself at trial, and since the trial judge's denial of\r\nappellant's request was predicated on this competency standard, we are compelled\r\nto reverse. McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984) (erroneous denial of Faretta\r\nrequest is a structural error requiring automatic reversal).\r\n\r\nA South Carolina criminal defendant has the constitutional right to represent\r\nhimself under both the federal and state constitutions.9 State v. Starnes, 388 S.C.\r\n590, 698 S.E.2d 604 (2010). A capital defendant, like any other criminal\r\ndefendant, may waive his right to counsel. State v. Starnes, supra; State v. Brewer,\r\n328 S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997). So long as the defendant makes his request\r\nprior to trial, the only proper inquiry is that mandated by Faretta. State v. Winkler,\r\n388 S.C. 574, 698 S.E.2d 596 (2010).\r\n\r\nRecognizing that it may be to the defendant's detriment to be allowed to proceed\r\npro se, his knowing, intelligent and voluntary decision \"must be honored out of\r\nthat respect for the individual which is the lifeblood of the law.\" Faretta, 422 U.S.\r\nat 834. Under Faretta, the trial judge has the responsibility to make sure that the\r\ndefendant is informed of the dangers and disadvantages of self-representation, and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9   U.S. Const. am. 6; S.C. Const. art. I, § 14.\r\n\nthat he makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of his right to counsel. State v.\r\nReed, 332 S.C. 35, 41, 503 S.E.2d 747, 750 (1998).\r\n\r\nIn Edwards, the United States Supreme Court held that \"the Constitution permits\r\nstates to insist upon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand\r\ntrial under Dusky10 but who still suffer from severe mental illness to the point\r\nwhere they are not competent to conduct trial proceedings by themselves.\"\r\nEdwards, 554 U.S. at 178. Since the Court merely agreed that states could set a\r\nhigher standard for self-representation at trial without offending the federal\r\nconstitution, it declined to adopt a federal constitutional competency standard. Id.\r\n\r\nWe decline to impose a higher competency standard upon an individual who\r\nwishes to waive his right to an attorney and represent himself at trial than that\r\nrequired for the waiver of other fundamental constitutional rights afforded a\r\ncriminal defendant, such as the right against compulsory self-incrimination; the\r\nright to trial by jury; and the right to confront one's accusers. See Boykin v.\r\nAlabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969). A defendant who is competent to stand trial is also\r\ncompetent to waive these fundamental rights and plead guilty. Sims v. State, 313\r\nS.C. 420, 438 S.E.2d 253 (1993). We do not find public policy supports a\r\ndistinction between a defendant who wishes to plead guilty and the defendant who\r\nwishes to proceed to trial as the Sixth Amendment guarantees every criminal\r\ndefendant the \"right to proceed without counsel when he voluntarily and\r\nintelligently elects to do so.\" Faretta, 422 U.S. at 807.11\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n10Dusky v. United States, 362 U.S. 402 (1960).\r\n11The dissent does not adopt the Edwards standard, which is predicated on the\r\ndefendant's severe mental illness, but instead crafts a new test for capital cases only\r\nwhere the trial judge is to assess the defendant's \"mental and psychiatric history,\r\ndemeanor, and the importance of the impending trial\" and weigh those findings\r\nagainst the defendant's request that he be allowed to waive his right to counsel.\r\nThe dissent would allow the trial judge to deny a capital defendant's request to\r\nproceed pro se if the trial judge believes that allowing self-representation would\r\nmake the proceeding less fair or the verdict not \"especially reliable.\" The dissent's\r\nformulation of the analytical framework for deciding whether to allow a capital\r\ndefendant to waive his right to counsel is not constitutionally sound, and reflects\r\nthe rationale we rejected in State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997).\r\n\nThe judge erred in applying the Edwards competency standard to appellant's\r\nrequest to waive his right of counsel and proceed pro se. Accordingly, we are\r\nconstrained to reverse. McKaskle, supra.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nSince the Faretta error mandates reversal, we need not reach any of appellant's\r\nother issues save that alleging he was entitled to dismissal of all charges under the\r\nIAD Act. On the face of this record, it appears appellant waived his speedy trial\r\nrights under this Act, and we therefore decline to reverse on this ground. See New\r\nYork v. Hill, 528 U.S. 110 (2000).\r\n\r\nAppellant's convictions and sentence are\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.

California.\r\n\r\n\r\n       II.\t   Whether the trial court violated Appellant's Due Process rights\r\n              by relying on the pre-trial testimony of a doctor retained by\r\n              Appellant's defense counsel in anticipation of exclusive use\r\n              during the trial's mitigation phase.\r\n\r\n\r\n      III.\t   Whether the trial court erred by limiting Appellant's trial\r\n              counsel's voir dire regarding the views of potential jurors\r\n              regarding the death penalty.\r\n\r\n\r\n      IV.\t    Whether the trial court erred in finding Juror #203 unqualified\r\n              to sit as a juror.\r\n\r\n\r\n       V.\t    Whether the trial court erred in refusing to dismiss the State's\r\n              indictments against Appellant due to the State's alleged failure\r\n              to comply with the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act\r\n              (IAD).              ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n                           I.     Faretta v. California\r\n      The majority concludes that the trial court erred in applying the Indiana v.\r\nEdwards competency standard to Appellant's request to waive his right to counsel\r\nand proceed pro se. I disagree.\r\n\n       In Indiana v. Edwards, the United States Supreme Court clarified the limits\r\nof a defendant's right to self-representation and made it clear that Faretta v.\r\nCalifornia, 422 U.S. 806 (1975), and its progeny, do not stand for the proposition\r\nthat the right to self-representation trumps other valid constitutional considerations.\r\n554 U.S. 164, 175 (2008) (\"[T]he nature of the problem before us cautions against\r\nthe use of a single mental competency standard for deciding both (1) whether a\r\ndefendant who is represented by counsel can proceed to trial and (2) whether a\r\ndefendant who goes to trial must be permitted to represent himself.\"). Instead,\r\nself-representation rights must be assessed against the judiciary's responsibility to\r\nensure the fundamental fairness and integrity of trial proceedings.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court's decision in Indiana v. Edwards explained that a\r\ndefendant may be competent to stand trial, but not competent to conduct her\r\ndefense at trial, and that trial courts may investigate this variance in competency.\r\nIn my view, this principle applies uniformly across the spectrum of criminal trials.\r\nThe facts and circumstances of Indiana v. Edwards did not concern a capital\r\nproceeding but, from my perspective, these competency considerations become\r\neven more pronounced in the capital context in view of the Supreme Court's\r\nmandate that these trials include heightened reliability. See, e.g., Woodson v.\r\nNorth Carolina, infra (\"Because of the qualitative difference, there is a\r\ncorresponding difference in the need for reliability in the determination that death\r\nis the appropriate punishment in a specific case.\").\r\n\r\n      The framework and determinations examined by the majority in Indiana v.\r\nEdwards not only guard against compromising the rights of capital defendants\r\nwhose mental competency is at issue, but protect the integrity of the judicial\r\nsystem as a whole. Thus, I would hold that South Carolina trial courts may \"insist\r\nupon representation by counsel for those competent enough to stand trial . . . but\r\nwho still suffer from mental illness to the point where they are not competent to\r\nconduct trial proceedings by themselves.\" See Edwards, 554 U.S. at 177–78.\r\n\r\n       In Faretta, the United States Supreme Court explained that \"the Sixth\r\nAmendment does not provide merely that a defense shall be made for the accused;\r\nit grants to the accused personally the right to make his defense.\" In that case,\r\nAnthony Faretta sought to represent himself against charges of grand theft. 422\r\nU.S. at 807. Questioning by the trial court revealed that Faretta had previously\r\nrepresented himself in a criminal prosecution, possessed a high school education,\r\nand that Faretta did not want representation from what he described as a public\r\ndefender office \"very loaded down with . . . a heavy case load.\" Id. The trial court\r\ngranted Faretta's waiver of assistance of counsel, but indicated that the court would\r\n\nreverse the ruling if it later appeared that Faretta could not adequately represent\r\nhimself. Id.\r\n\r\n       Several weeks later, the trial court held a hearing and inquired into Faretta's\r\nability to conduct his own defense, questioning Faretta specifically regarding the\r\nhearsay rule, and state law covering jury voir dire. Id. at 808. The trial court ruled\r\nthat based on Faretta's answers and demeanor, he had not made an intelligent and\r\nknowing waiver of his right to assistance of counsel. Id. at 808–09. The trial court\r\nalso held that Faretta did not have a constitutional right to conduct his own\r\ndefense. Id. at 809–10. The trial court rejected Faretta's subsequent requests to\r\nrepresent himself, and required that only a public defender conduct Faretta's\r\ndefense. Id. at 810–11. The jury found Faretta guilty. Id. at 811. The California\r\nCourt of Appeal affirmed the trial court's ruling, and the California Supreme Court\r\ndenied review. Id. at 811–12. The United States Supreme Court reversed, holding:\r\n\r\n      There can be no blinking the fact that the right of an accused to\r\n      conduct his own defense seems to cut against the grain of this Court's\r\n      decisions holding that the Constitution requires that no accused can be\r\n      convicted and imprisoned unless he has been accorded the right to the\r\n      assistance of counsel. For it is surely true that the basic thesis of those\r\n      decisions is that the help of a lawyer is essential to assure the\r\n      defendant a fair trial. And a strong argument can surely be made that\r\n      the whole thrust of those decisions must inevitably lead to the\r\n      conclusion that a State may constitutionally impose a lawyer upon\r\n      even an unwilling defendant . . . . But it is one thing to hold that every\r\n      defendant, rich or poor, has the right to the assistance of counsel, and\r\n      quite another to say that a State may compel a defendant to accept a\r\n      lawyer he does not want. The value of state-appointed counsel was not\r\n      unappreciated by the Founders, yet the notion of compulsory counsel\r\n      was utterly foreign to them. And whatever else may be said of those\r\n      who wrote the Bill of Rights, surely there can be no doubt that they\r\n      understood the inestimable worth of free choice.\r\n\r\nId. at 832–33. The Supreme Court held that an accused who manages his own\r\ndefense relinquishes many of the benefits associated with counsel, and thus, must\r\n\"knowingly and intelligently\" resign those benefits. Id. at 835. However, the\r\nSupreme Court explained that the defendant's technical legal knowledge is not\r\nrelevant to an assessment of his \"knowing exercise of his right to defend himself.\"\r\nId. at 835–36 (\"In forcing Faretta, under these circumstances to accept against his\r\n\nwill a state-appointed public defender, the California courts deprived him of his\r\nconstitutional right to conduct his own defense.\").\r\n\r\n      In McKaskle v. Wiggins, 465 U.S. 168 (1984), the Supreme Court analyzed\r\nan important limitation on a defendant's right to self-representation: the role of\r\nstandby counsel. In that case, the defendant, Carl Wiggins, claimed that a pro se\r\ndefendant could insist on presenting his own case completely free from any\r\ninvolvement by standby counsel. Id. at 176. Wiggins's argument relied on the\r\nFaretta decision's sole reference to standby counsel:\r\n\r\n      Of course, a State may—even over objection by the accused—appoint\r\n      a \"standby counsel\" to aid the accused if and when the accused\r\n      requests help, and to be available to represent the accused in the event\r\n      that termination of the defendant's self-representation is necessary.\r\n\r\nId. (citation omitted). Wiggins argued that the \"if and when\" language defined the\r\nlimits on standby counsel's role, and that Faretta did not allow standby counsel to\r\nargue with the defendant, make motions to the court contrary to the defendant's\r\nwishes, or take other steps not specifically approved by the defendant. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court disagreed, and held that the Faretta decision did not\r\nintend for an absolute bar on standby counsel's unsolicited participation. Id. at\r\n176–77 (\"The right to appear pro se exists to affirm the dignity and autonomy of\r\nthe accused and to allow the presentation of what may, at least occasionally, be the\r\naccused's best possible defense. Both of these objectives can be achieved without\r\ncategorically silencing standby counsel.\"). However, the Supreme Court did set\r\ntwo bright line rules for the participation of standby counsel: first, the pro se\r\ndefendant is entitled to preserve actual control over the case presented to the jury,\r\nand second, participation by standby counsel must not destroy the jury's perception\r\nthat the defendant is representing himself. Id. at 178.\r\n\r\n      From my perspective, in setting a limitation on a defendant's Sixth\r\nAmendment right to self-representation, the Supreme Court recognized that this\r\nimportant trial right must be balanced against the overarching principles that the\r\ndefendant receive a fair trial, and that courts be allowed to conduct reasonable and\r\norderly proceedings. See McKaskle, 465 U.S. at 183–84 (\"Nor does the\r\nConstitution require judges to take over chores for a pro se defendant that would\r\nnormally be attended to by trained counsel as a matter of course. Faretta\r\nrecognized as much. The right of self-representation is not a license to abuse the\r\ndignity of the courtroom. Neither is it a license not to comply with relevant rules\r\nof procedural and substantive law.\" (citation omitted)); see also Martinez v. Court\r\n\nof Appeal of Cal., Fourth Appellate Dist., 528 U.S. 152, 162 (2000) (\"[T]he\r\ngovernment's interest in ensuring the integrity and efficiency of the trial at times\r\noutweighs the defendant's interest in acting in his own lawyer.\").\r\n\r\n       In addition to the self-representation overlay supplied by Faretta, McKaskle,\r\nand Martinez, the facts of the instant case must be analyzed in light of the Supreme\r\nCourt's requirement that capital trials carry an element of enhanced reliability\r\ndistinct from other criminal proceedings.\r\n\r\n     In Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976), the United States\r\nSupreme Court explained:\r\n\r\n         This conclusion rests squarely on the predicate that the penalty of\r\n         death is qualitatively different from a sentence of imprisonment,\r\n         however long. Death, in its finality, differs more from life\r\n         imprisonment than a 100-year prison term differs from one of only a\r\n         year or two. Because of that qualitative difference, there is a\r\n         corresponding difference in the need for reliability in the\r\n         determination that death is the appropriate punishment in a specific\r\n         case.\r\n\r\nId. at 305 (concluding that capital cases required an individualized sentencing\r\ndetermination encompassing the character and record of the accused); see also\r\nThompson v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 815, 856 (1988) (\"Among the most important\r\nand consistent themes in this Court's death penalty jurisprudence is the need for\r\nspecial care and deliberation in decisions that may lead to the imposition of that\r\nsanction. The Court has accordingly imposed a series of unique substantive and\r\nprocedural restrictions designed to ensure that capital punishment is not imposed\r\nwithout the serious and calm reflection that ought to precede any decision of such\r\ngravity and finality.\"); Jonathan DeSantis, David Versus Goliath: Prohibiting\r\nCapital Defendants From Proceeding Pro Se, 49 No. 1 Crim. Law Bulletin ART 5,\r\nat 1 (2013) (\"It has long been recognized that a capital trial requires 'heightened\r\nreliability' with regards to both guilty verdicts and death sentences.\" (citing Beck v.\r\nAlabama's12 extension of the \"heightened reliability\" doctrine originally required\r\nfor capital sentences to capital verdicts.)).\r\n\r\n       The heightened reliability required of capital verdicts and sentences has led\r\nstates to adopt stringent requirements for attorneys representing defendants facing\r\nthe ultimate punishment. For example, Florida requires attorneys serve as lead\r\n\r\n12   447 U.S. 625, 638 (1980).\r\n\ncounsel in at least nine jury trials of \"serious and complex cases which were tried\r\nto completion,\" have demonstrated \"necessary proficiency and commitment which\r\nexemplify the quality of representation appropriate to capital cases,\" and attend a\r\ncontinuing legal education program, within the last two years, devoted to capital\r\ndefense. Desantis, supra, at 3. In South Carolina, section 16-3-26 of the South\r\nCarolina Code provides that indigent defendants facing a capital trial must receive\r\nat least two court-appointed attorneys. One of the attorneys must have at least five\r\nyears' experience as a licensed attorney, and at least three years in the actual trial of\r\nfelony cases. S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-26 (B)(1) (2003). That section also vests this\r\nCourt with the authority to \"promulgate guidelines on the expertise and\r\nqualifications necessary for attorneys to be certified as competent to handle death\r\npenalty cases.\" Id. § 16-3-26(F); see Rule 421, SCACR (\"There shall be two\r\nclasses of attorneys certified to handle death penalty cases: lead counsel and\r\nsecond counsel . . . . Lead counsel shall have at least five years' experience as a\r\nlicensed attorney and at least three years' experience in the actual trial of felony\r\ncases.\").\r\n\r\n       Obviously, a criminal defendant who waives his right to counsel, and elects\r\nto proceed pro se, loses the benefit of counsel equipped with the type of special\r\nqualifications discussed supra, and this fact could make the difference in the\r\nconduct and outcome of his trial. However, this decision is constitutionally\r\npermissible provided the defendant makes a knowing and intelligent waiver of the\r\nbenefit. Nevertheless, in my view, the defendant's right to self-representation is\r\nnot absolute, and as discussed supra, courts may place reasonable restrictions on\r\nthat right. For example, the Supreme Court has held that trial courts may curtail\r\nthat right in the interest of providing the defendant with a fair trial, and ensuring\r\nthat the proceedings do not become a mockery of the criminal justice system. See,\r\ne.g., Martinez, 528 U.S. at 162 (holding that states may restrict a defendant's self-\r\nrepresentation guarantees in recognition of the government's interests in preserving\r\nthe integrity and efficiency of the process).\r\n\r\n        These considerations become even more pronounced in the capital context\r\nwhere trials must contain an indicia of reliability higher than any other criminal\r\ntrial, and where a criminal defendant is likely at a significant disadvantage in\r\nmeeting the demands of adequate representation. See, e.g., Desantis, supra, at 4\r\n(\"Incarcerated capital defendants electing to proceed pro se also face the prospect\r\nof conducting a mitigation investigation from within the confines of prison . . . .\r\n[S]ome of the requirements for capital defense counsel detailed in the ABA\r\nStandards, such as visiting the scene of the alleged crime, are inherently\r\nunavailable to incarcerated defendants.\").\r\n\n      In the instant case, Appellant's trial counsel began the self-representation\r\ncolloquy with the trial court by explaining that different experts hired to evaluate\r\nAppellant believed he was \"very competent\" to stand trial, but lacked the\r\ncompetency to waive his right to counsel and conduct the proceedings on his own.\r\nOne of these experts, Dr. David Price, testified that Appellant failed to finish high\r\nschool, and has an intelligence quotient at the \"very low part of the low/average\r\nrange of intellectual functioning.\" Price also stated that Appellant had a significant\r\npsychiatric history including psychiatric disorders, admissions, post-traumatic\r\ndisorder, paranoia, cognitive difficulties and lapses, and issues with judgment and\r\ndecision-making. According to Price, these issues interacting with each other\r\nimpaired Appellant's ability to knowingly and intelligently waive his right to\r\ncounsel in this case. The trial court denied Appellant's motion to proceed pro se,\r\nholding:\r\n\r\n      Given the doctor's testimony and his expert opinion that the defendant\r\n      has not knowingly and intelligently waived his right to counsel, I find\r\n      the defendant does not have a clear understanding of the dangers of\r\n      self-representation in the guilt nor the sentencing phase of the trial. I\r\n      further find that the defendant does not knowingly, intelligently\r\n      understand the dangers inherent in self-representation. I feel like I\r\n      would not be fulfilling my responsibilities under the law to an\r\n      individual that deserves a fair trial if I allow on this record, and I\r\n      might add, my observation of [Appellant]. . . . [Appellant] has always\r\n      been during these proceedings respectful . . . . However, he is prone to\r\n      ramble. He's prone to act extra-judicious, and by that I mean not\r\n      appropriate, but to act as if he were conducting his defense on the\r\n      streets, so to speak, and as we all know, the courtroom is not the place\r\n      for that kind of decorum or demeanor. I think it would be an abuse of\r\n      my discretion to allow him to represent himself in trying to do all I\r\n      can to make sure [Appellant] in this very serious matter gets a fair\r\n      trial. So I'm denying your motion.\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the trial court did not err. The trial court's order exemplifies\r\nthe balancing that must take place in a capital trial when a defendant desires to\r\nrepresent himself.\r\n\r\n       The majority acknowledges that in Indiana v. Edwards, the Supreme Court\r\nheld that the United States Constitution does not forbid a state from insisting that a\r\ndefendant proceed to trial with counsel if the defendant is found mentally\r\ncompetent to stand trial but mentally incompetent to conduct the trial herself. Id.\r\n\nat 167. In so finding, the Supreme Court relied in part on undisputed medical\r\nopinions regarding the effects of mental illness of a defendant's ability to\r\neffectively represent herself. Id. at 176 (\"The American Psychiatric Association\r\n(APA) tells us (without dispute) in its amicus brief filed in support of neither party\r\nthat '[d]isorganized thinking, deficits in sustaining attention and concentration,\r\nimpaired expressive abilities, anxiety, and other common symptoms of severe\r\nmental illnesses can impair the defendant's ability to play the significantly\r\nexpanded role required for self-representation even if he can play the lesser role of\r\nrepresented defendant.'\" (citation omitted)). Additionally the Supreme Court noted\r\nthe right to self-representation will not \"affirm the dignity,\" of a defendant without\r\nthe mental capacity to conduct her defense. Id. (\"To the contrary, given that\r\ndefendant's uncertain mental state, the spectacle that could well result from his\r\nself-representation at trial is at least as likely to prove humiliating as ennobling.\r\nMoreover, insofar as a defendant's lack of capacity threatens an improper\r\nconviction or sentence, self-representation in that exceptional context undercuts the\r\nmost basic of the Constitution's criminal law objectives, providing a fair trial.\").\r\nMoreover, the Supreme Court observed the significant concern that \"proceedings\r\nmust not only be fair, they must 'appear fair to all who observe them.'\" Id. (citing\r\nWheat v. United States, 486 U.S. 153, 160 (1988)); see also Massey v. Moore, 348\r\nU.S. 105, 108 (1954) (\"No trial can be fair that leaves the defense to a man who is\r\ninsane, unaided by counsel, and who by reason of his mental condition stands\r\nhelpless and alone before the court.\").\r\n\r\n       Consistent with the Supreme Court's reliance on medical opinions in Indiana\r\nv. Edwards, the trial court in the instant case relied on expert opinions in finding\r\nthat Appellant was mentally incompetent to represent himself at trial. The\r\nmajority, however, chooses to ignore Dr. Price's thoughtful testimony applying\r\nAppellant's mental conditions to his ability to waive his right to counsel and\r\nrepresent himself at trial. Instead, the majority highlights only Appellant's\r\nfamiliarity with court procedure. In my opinion, the majority's analysis is\r\ninsufficient to ensure the fairness mandated by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n       We must be mindful that state authorities charged the defendant in Indiana\r\nv. Edwards with attempted murder, battery with a deadly weapon, criminal\r\nrecklessness, and theft. Edwards, 554 U.S. at 167. These are serious crimes, but\r\nnone can leave a criminal defendant susceptible to a sentence of death upon\r\nconviction. If based on these facts our nation's highest court found the curtailment\r\nof self-representation rights permissible, it is clearly constitutionally acceptable to\r\nallow South Carolina trial courts to make this determination for defendants facing\r\nthe ultimate punishment. See id., 554 U.S. at 177–78 (\"We consequently conclude\r\n\nthat the Constitution permits judges to take realistic account of the particular\r\ndefendant's mental capacities by asking whether a defendant who seeks to conduct\r\nhis own defense at trial is mentally competent to do so.\").\r\n\r\n        I strongly disagree with the majority's characterization of my analysis as a\r\nreflection of the rationale that this Court rejected in State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117,\r\n492 S.E.2d 97 (1997). In Brewer, this Court reversed the denial of a defendant's\r\nmotion to proceed pro se because the trial court found that the decision to waive\r\ncounsel was knowing, intelligent, and voluntary and thus, the trial court violated\r\nthe defendant's 6th Amendment right to self-representation by denying the motion.\r\nId. at 120–21, 492 S.E.2d at 99. In Brewer, decided before Indiana v. Edwards\r\nand unlike the present case, there was no question about the defendant's mental\r\ncompetence. Instead, the trial court denied the motion merely because it was a\r\ndeath penalty case, concluding that allowing the defendant to represent himself\r\nwas \"fraught with inherent disastrous consequences.\" Id. at 119–20, 492 S.E.2d at\r\n98–99. Trial courts are in the proper position to determine a defendant's capability\r\nto adequately represent himself given their opportunity to hear testimony and\r\nreview evidence about a defendant's mental competence before he may proceed pro\r\nse. A trial court is permitted to engage in an evaluation intended to balance a\r\ndefendant's rights to self-representation and a fair trial, especially after Indiana v.\r\nEdwards. Such an evaluation eliminates unfairness on the front end of a trial and\r\nis in no way contrary to this Court's opinion in Brewer.\r\n\r\n        In addition, the majority is simply wrong to suggest that the foregoing\r\nreasoning ignores applicable constitutional mandates. My view of this case is\r\nfirmly entrenched in precedent providing for a balancing of the constitutional right\r\nto self-representation and the heightened reliability required of capital trials. From\r\nmy perspective, the aim of a comprehensive self-representation analysis is not to\r\nshield competent capital defendants from adverse outcomes, but instead to ensure\r\nthat trial courts possess the authority to deal appropriately with cases where the\r\nmental competence of the defendant is at issue. Id. at 178–79 (\"[I]nstances in\r\nwhich the trial's fairness is in doubt may well be concentrated in the 20 percent or\r\nso of self-representation cases where the mental competence of the defendant is\r\nalso at issue.\" (citing Erica J. Hashimoto, Defending the Right of Self-\r\nRepresentation: An Empirical Look at the Pro Se Felony Defendant, 85 N.C.L.\r\nRev. 423 (2007)).\r\n\n        The importance of a \"knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver\" is without\r\nquestion. However, in the criminal context, it is far from the sole question.\r\nDefendants very clearly have a constitutional right to self-representation, however,\r\nthis right must bow to the competing concern that \"death is different,\" and trial\r\ncourts must do everything legitimately within their power to ensure that these trials\r\nare fair and that the proceedings and verdict are especially reliable.\r\n\r\n       In the instant case, the trial court assessed Appellant's mental and psychiatric\r\nhistory, demeanor, and the importance of the impending trial in deciding that\r\nAppellant could not adequately represent himself. An abuse of discretion occurs\r\nwhen the decision is controlled by some error of law or based on findings of fact\r\nthat are without evidentiary support. See Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 390, 709\r\nS.E.2d 650, 654–55 (2011). In my view, neither of these reversible circumstances\r\noccurred in the instant case. II.    Pre-Trial Testimony\r\n\r\n      Appellant asserts that the trial court violated his due process rights by\r\nrelying on Price's testimony. I disagree.\r\n\r\n       As discussed, supra, Appellant's trial counsel indicated that experts hired to\r\nevaluate Appellant held the view that Appellant lacked the competency to waive\r\nhis right to counsel and conduct the trial proceedings on his own. Appellant's trial\r\ncounsel then sought to have Price testify to that view. Appellant objected,\r\nasserting that Price's testimony would violate \"doctor/client\" privilege and\r\nAppellant's due process rights. The trial court viewed Appellant's objection as an\r\nattempt to force the trial court to rule on Appellant's competency without having all\r\ninformation concerning Appellant's mental history.\r\n\r\n       In my view, Appellant did not fully disclose his mental history and other\r\nrelevant information regarding his mental state during the trial court's initial\r\ninquiry into Appellant's competency to waive his right to counsel. The trial court\r\ncould not make an accurate ruling on the issue of Appellant's waiver without\r\nproper access to all relevant information. Appellant misapprehends the issue as\r\nturning on his personal feelings regarding whether he was competent to conduct\r\nhis own trial proceedings. Instead the issue actually centers on whether the trial\r\ncourt objectively viewed him competent to present a defense that comports with\r\nthe reliability and integrity of a death penalty trial.\r\n\n       Appellant's argument relies in part on this Court's decision in State v. Jones,\r\n383 S.C. 535, 681 S.E.2d 580 (2009). However, in my view, Appellant incorrectly\r\ninterprets that case.\r\n\r\n        In Jones, the State informed the defense that it intended to introduce\r\n\"barefoot insole impression\" evidence. Id. at 540, 681 S.E.2d at 582. In response,\r\nthe defense retained a renowned expert on this evidence. Id. The defense did not\r\nintended to call the expert at trial, but the State subpoenaed the expert to testify at\r\ntrial. Id. The defense filed pre-trial motions seeking to quash the State's subpoena\r\nand suppress introduction of \"barefoot insole impression\" evidence. Id. The trial\r\ncourt denied both motions, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant of two\r\ncounts of murder. Id.\r\n\r\n       The defendant argued on appeal that the State's subpoena violated the work-\r\nproduct doctrine, attorney-client privilege, and his Sixth Amendment right to\r\neffective assistance of counsel. Id. at 540, 681 S.E.2d at 582–83. The State\r\ncountered that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting the subpoena\r\ngiven that expert only testified during a pre-trial, in camera hearing, the State did\r\nnot question the expert regarding any matters produced by attorney-client privilege\r\nor work-product doctrine, and it would be fundamentally unfair to the State for the\r\ndefendant to challenge the scientific reliability of \"barefoot insole impression\"\r\nevidence while withholding non-privileged testimony from one of the two\r\nrenowned experts who the State initially attempted to retain. Id. at 541, 681 S.E.2d\r\nat 583.\r\n\r\n      This Court affirmed the trial court's ruling, holding:\r\n\r\n      Here, there were only two available expert witnesses on the \"barefoot\r\n      insole impression\" evidence. The trial judge recognized this anomaly\r\n      and properly limited the State to only eliciting non-protected\r\n      information . . . . Moreover, the State only called [the expert] during\r\n      an in camera hearing for the benefit of the trial judge's ruling on the\r\n      admissibility of the \"barefoot insole impression\" evidence. Because\r\n      [the expert] did not testify during the trial, the State's decision to call\r\n      [the expert] as a witness could not have affected the jury's assessment\r\n      of the evidence . . . . Additionally, the State's questioning of [the\r\n      expert] was confined to general testimony regarding his expertise and\r\n      his opinion regarding the scientific reliability of the evidence.\r\n      Significantly, the State did not question [the expert] concerning the\r\n      specifics of the crime scene evidence . . . . Based on the foregoing, we\r\n\n      hold the trial judge's decision denying [the defendant's] motion to\r\n      quash the State's subpoena of [the expert] did not constitute reversible\r\n      error.\r\n\r\nId. at 546–47, 681 S.E.2d at 586. In my opinion, the facts and circumstances of the\r\ninstant case are similar. The trial court allowed the testimony of a witness,\r\npresented by the defense, for the benefit of the trial court's ruling on Appellant's\r\ncompetency to waive his right to counsel. This testimony took place following the\r\nAppellant's own minimization of his significant psychiatric dysfunction. However,\r\nthis testimony occurred in camera, and the trial court did not permit the State to\r\nparticipate. Therefore, from my perspective, the trial court's decision to allow\r\nPrice's testimony does not constitute reversible error.\r\n\r\n       However, the warning this Court issued in Jones applies with equal force\r\nhere. In Jones, the Court cautioned that its decision should not be interpreted as\r\nestablishing a general rule permitting the State to compel the testimony of a non-\r\ntestifying, consultative defense agent. Id. at 547, 681 S.E.2d at 548 (\"Taken to its\r\nextreme, we believe such a rule could be used by the State as a subversive tactic to\r\ncircumvent discovery rules.\"). Thus, the Court limited the Jones decision to the\r\nspecific facts of that case, and adopted a \"substantial need\" rule for instances where\r\nthe State seeks to compel a defendant's non-testifying consultative expert. Id. In\r\nthat same vein, the trial court could have ordered a separate evaluation of\r\nAppellant instead of allowing Appellant's counsel to present Price's testimony. In\r\nmy view, this would have been unnecessarily duplicative given that the foundation\r\nof the trial court's decision relied on Price's analysis of Appellant's uncontroverted\r\nmedical history, rather than any type of relationship between Price and Appellant.\r\nAfter all, Appellant's counsel retained Price for mitigation, not for treatment.13\r\nNevertheless, trial courts should avoid confusion and order a competency\r\nevaluation when necessary to provide further support for the court's ruling\r\nregarding a defendant's competency to waive his right to counsel. Moreover,\r\nattorneys, especially those providing counsel to defendants facing a capital trial,\r\nmust take care to be forthright and honest with their clients concerning the use of\r\nexpert witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n13Contrary to Appellant's position, the trial court is not a state actor for purposes of\r\na Jones analysis, and thus, application of the \"substantial need\" test would be\r\nnonsensical.\r\n\n                     III.   Improper Limitation of Voir Dire\r\n\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the trial court violated his Sixth, Eighth, and\r\nFourteenth Amendment14 rights by improperly limiting defense counsel's attempt\r\nto voir dire potential jurors regarding their views of the death penalty. In my\r\nopinion, this argument is without merit, and the trial court's voire dire limitations\r\ndid not render Appellant's trial fundamentally unfair.\r\n\r\n      \"The scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is conducted are\r\ngenerally left to the sound discretion of the trial court.\" State v. Bixby, 388 S.C.\r\n528, 542, 698 S.E.2d 572, 579 (2010) (citing State v. Stanko, 376 S.C. 571, 575,\r\n658 S.E.2d 94, 96 (2008)). Furthermore, \"[i]t is well established that a trial court\r\nhas broad discretion in conducting the voir dire of the jury and particularly in\r\nphrasing the questions to be asked.\" Id. (citing United States v. Jones, 608 F.2d\r\n1004, 1009 (4th Cir.1979)). A limitation on juror questioning will not constitute\r\nreversible error unless the limitation renders the trial fundamentally unfair. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n14   U.S. Const. amends. VI, VIII, XIV.\r\n\n                                 A. Procedurally Barred\r\n       Where counsel fails to exhaust all strikes, appellate review of juror\r\nqualification issues is barred. Bixby, 388 S.C. at 542, 698 S.E.2d at 579; see also\r\nState v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 163, 478 S.E.2d 260, 264 (1996) (holding \"[f]ailure\r\nto exhaust all of a defendant's peremptory strikes will preclude appellate review of\r\njuror qualification issues\"). In the instant case, Appellant's defense counsel used\r\nonly nine of the ten available strikes during jury selection, thus in my opinion, the\r\nCourt's consideration of this issue is barred. See Bixby, 388 S.C. at 542, 698\r\nS.E.2d at 579 (\"Because defense counsel used only seven of the ten available\r\nstrikes during jury selection, review of this issue is barred.\").\r\n\r\n\r\n                         B. Trial Court's Permissible Limitations\r\n\r\n      However, even if this Court's precedent did not bar review of Appellant's\r\narguments, in my view the trial court properly limited the scope of defense\r\ncounsel's examination of jurors #146, #157, and #183.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   1. Juror #157\r\n       Appellant's trial counsel attempted to question Juror #157 regarding \"some\r\nof the factors\" that the juror would consider important in making a determination\r\nof whether to impose the death penalty. The State objected, and the trial court\r\nsustained the State's objection. Appellant's trial counsel then attempted to question\r\nthe juror regarding her understanding of the term murder. The trial court did not\r\nallow the question, finding the juror's opinions of \"what the law of murder is\"\r\ninappropriate for voir dire. Appellant's trial counsel objected to the trial court's\r\nrefusal to allow him to \"instruct the jurors on the definition of murder in the voir\r\ndire.\" The trial court overruled the objection, holding that jurors could not be\r\nquestioned regarding their conceptions, or misconceptions, regarding the law,\r\nciting this Court's decision in Bixby, supra.\r\n\r\n                                      2. Juror #146\r\n      During voir dire, Appellant's trial counsel and Juror #146 engaged in the\r\nfollowing colloquy:\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t      Now, if you were on the jury and you found that\r\n                            there was a murder that there was absolutely no\r\n\n                          excuse for, you could give meaningful\r\n                          consideration to a life sentence?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Juror #146: \t       Quite honestly, if there was no excuse for it, cold\r\n                          blooded, I couldn't. I've just got to be honest with\r\n                          you. If there are mitigating circumstances or\r\n                          situations, I mean yes, but I'd be lying if I said\r\n                          differently.\r\n\r\n       Under the State's cross-examination, Juror #146 stated that he would have no\r\npredisposition on whether or not he could vote for life or death, and that if he could\r\nvote for a death sentence or life imprisonment depending on what the facts of the\r\ncase warranted.\r\n\r\n       Trial counsel argued that the juror was not qualified because of his reference\r\nto murder committed in \"cold blood,\" and requested further examination of the\r\njuror. The trial court allowed trial counsel to re-question Juror #146. Trial counsel\r\nthen asked Juror #146, \"If you found beyond a reasonable doubt that there was a\r\nmurder with no excuse in cold blood, would it matter to you—would anything else\r\nmatter to you?\" The trial court did not allow this question, finding that it\r\nconstituted an impermissible question based on a \"particular hypothetical,\" or a\r\n\"particular set of facts.\" Trial counsel then explained that he felt the juror had a\r\n\"misconception\" of murder, and that this misconception would interfere with the\r\njuror's impartiality. The trial court agreed to provide the definition of murder and\r\nexplained:\r\n\r\n      Before I go back to allowing the lawyers to ask you a few more\r\n      questions, I do want to tell you that as far as murder is concerned,\r\n      murder in South Carolina is the unlawful killing of a human being by\r\n      another human being with malice aforethought, express or implied.\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel then questioned Juror #146, and the juror explained that he\r\nwould not make up his mind on a particular case simply because he had convicted\r\nthe person of murder:\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t    It's not an automatic decision; you're not one of\r\n                          those jurors that if you find a person guilty of\r\n                          murder, you'd automatically sentence a person to\r\n                          death?\r\n\n      Juror #146: \t                                                         No.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t    And if you get—in a death penalty trial an\r\n                          individual's found guilty of murder and you go into\r\n                          that penalty phase, you'd go in there with an open\r\n                          mind because there'd be different types of evidence\r\n                          in that penalty phase, evidence of aggravation,\r\n                          evidence of mitigation, evidence that may show\r\n                          something good or more of the circumstances of\r\n                          the nature of the crime or the particular defendant,\r\n                          or evidence of aggravation that may increase the\r\n                          enormity of the crime, you would consider that.\r\n\r\n      Juror #146: \t                                                    Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t                     Before you made your decision?\r\n\r\n      Juror #146: \t       Yes, sir. And I apologize. I assumed that's what I\r\n                          said.\r\n\r\n        The trial court found the juror qualified, and as Appellant concedes in his\r\nbrief, trial counsel used a peremptory challenge to strike Juror #146.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  3. Juror #183\r\n       Trial counsel attempted to question Juror #183 regarding her religious and\r\nmoral beliefs in relation the death penalty. Defense counsel asked Juror #183 for\r\nher thoughts on the Biblical axiom, \"eye for an eye,\" and whether the juror\r\nbelieved that the death penalty helped to \"protect society.\" The State objected to\r\nthese questions and the trial court sustained the objections.\r\n\r\n        Following the conclusion of the voir dire, the trial court excused the juror\r\nand heard the State's objection. The State argued that religion is not a proper basis\r\nfor voir dire, and prospective juror should not have to explain or interpret the\r\nBible. The State also asserted that jurors should not be questioned regarding their\r\nview of the death penalty's purposes, and this line of questioning ran afoul of the\r\ngeneral prohibition on hypotheticals as part of voir dire. The trial court ruled that\r\ntrial counsel could legitimately question the juror as to firmly held beliefs for or\r\nagainst the death penalty, but that it was not appropriate to investigate\r\n\nphilosophical distinctions and differences within a juror's religious belief. The trial\r\ncourt stated explicitly that the court was not prohibiting defense counsel from\r\nquestioning jurors regarding certain religious or moral beliefs. Notably, the trial\r\ncourt and defense counsel engaged in the following colloquy:\r\n\r\n             Trial court:        I thought her responses were very clear and\r\n                                 that she'd be a good juror when she talked\r\n                                 about a case-by-case basis. Further, she said\r\n                                 it would be a serious decision. I believe you\r\n                                 think she's qualified also you said?\r\n             Trial counsel:                Yes, your Honor.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       In my view, this Court's decisions in State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299\r\nS.E.2d 686 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45,\r\n69 n.5, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 n.5 (1991) (\"To the extent they require in favorem\r\nvitae review, the following cases, inter alia, are hereby overruled.\"), and State v.\r\nSouth, 285 S.C. 529, 331 S.E.2d 775 (1985), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 888 (1985),\r\nprovide the proper frame for viewing Appellant's arguments.\r\n\r\n       In State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299 S.E.2d 686 (1982), a jury found the\r\ndefendant guilty of two murders while committing larceny with a deadly weapon.\r\nThe defendant appealed on three separate grounds, the issue most pertinent to the\r\ninstant case being his absence from the courtroom during jury selection. Id. at 517,\r\n521, 299 S.E.2d at 687, 689. In Smart, the clerk of court conducted the initial jury\r\nselection outside the presence of the parties and the presiding judge. Id. at 521,\r\n299 S.E.2d at 689–90. The parties and the trial court then examined those jurors\r\nchosen. Id. The defendant did not object to this procedure at trial, and this Court\r\nfound that the defendant did not suffer prejudice \"by his absence during the simple\r\ndrawing of names.\" Id. at 521, 299 S.E.2d at 690 (\"Moreover, there is no right of\r\n[a] defendant to be present when purely ministerial acts, preparatory to jury\r\nselection are performed. (alteration added)).\r\n\r\n      However, the Court found the voir dire that took place in Smart to be\r\nlengthy and \"superfluous,\" providing the Court an opportunity to offer guidance\r\nregarding a capital defendant's right to examine jurors. Id. at 521, 299 S.E.2d at\r\n690. The Court recognized that section 14-7-1020 of the South Carolina Code\r\nprovided for a trial court's inquiry into \"whether a juror is related to either party,\r\nhas any interest in the cause, has expressed or formed any opinion, or is sensible of\r\n\nany bias or prejudice therein.\" Id. at 522, 299 S.E.2d at 690 (\"The manner in\r\nwhich these questions are pursued and the scope of any voir dire beyond their\r\nbounds are matters of trial court discretion.\"). This Court observed that trial court\r\nexamination prior to counsels' questioning could provide the basis for proper\r\nlimitation of counsels' questions to relevant matters, holding:\r\n\r\n      The unbridled examination of jurors by counsel serves to not only\r\n      unnecessarily add to the length and expense of the trial, but also\r\n      serves to antagonize jurors and lessen public respect for jury duty.\r\n      The extent to which voir dire examination is being permitted by trial\r\n      judges causes this Court concern and, therefore, this admonition.\r\n\r\nId. at 523, 299 S.E.2d at 691.\r\n\r\n       In South, the defendant argued that the trial court erred in refusing to permit\r\ndefense counsel to ask the jurors hypothetical questions concerning the death\r\npenalty. 285 S.C. at 534, 331 S.E.2d at 778. The Court disagreed, holding that\r\n\"[c]learly, the questions would have been improper since the purpose of voir dire is\r\nto insure each juror can make a decision based on the evidence presented, rather\r\nthan hypothetical evidence.\" Id.; see also State v. Patterson, 290 S.C. 523, 525–\r\n26, 351 S.E.2d 853, 854–55 (1986), cert. dismissed, 482 U.S. 902 (1987) (relying\r\non South to reject the claim that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the\r\ndefendant to use hypothetical question on voire dire in an attempt to discover\r\nhidden biases or prejudices concerning the death penalty).\r\n\r\n      In my view, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit's\r\ndecision in King v. Lynaugh, 850 F.2d 1055 (5th Cir. 1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S.\r\n1093 (1989), is instructive.\r\n\r\n       In King, the defendant argued that the trial court violated his constitutional\r\nguarantees to a trial by a fair and impartial jury when the court refused defendant's\r\nrequest to question the jurors, or educate them through voir dire, concerning their\r\nknowledge of Texas parole laws. 850 F.2d at 1057. The defendant argued that if\r\nthe jurors harbored misconceptions regarding Texas law, for instance regarding\r\nwhen a capital murder defendant might be eligible for parole, they would be biased\r\ntoward imposing the death penalty. Id. (\"On the other hand, he suggests, proper\r\nknowledge about the 20-year minimum prison term prior to parole eligibility in\r\nsuch cases will tend to reassure them that [the defendant] does not pose the future\r\ndangerousness to society contemplated by . . . Texas capital punishment law.\").\r\n\n       The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that the United States Supreme Court, until\r\nthat point, had only recognized racial prejudice and widespread and provocative\r\npretrial publicity as acceptable grounds for a constitutional challenge to a trial\r\ncourt's voir dire procedure, and held:\r\n\r\n      The Court has emphasized that \"[t]he Constitution does not always\r\n      entitle a defendant to have questions posed during voir dire\r\n      specifically directed to matters that conceivably might prejudice him.\"\r\n      Ristaino [v. Ross, 424 U.S. 589, 594 (1976)]. A graphic example of\r\n      the Court's distinction appears in Ham [v. South Carolina, 409 U.S.\r\n      524 (1973)] where a seven-member Court majority rejected the\r\n      defendant's contention that he was constitutionally entitled to inquire\r\n      whether jurors were prejudiced toward people with beards . . . . Ham's\r\n      trial and conviction occurred circa the late 1960's and early 1970's, at\r\n      the apogee of student and political activism, when the wearing of a\r\n      beard might well have been thought to prejudice many prospective\r\n      jurors. Nevertheless, the Court refused to constitutionalize an inquiry\r\n      which, in its view, would have suggested no principled limits on\r\n      intrusive appellate review of voir dire. We, likewise, are unable to\r\n      distinguish possible prejudice based on jurors' misconceptions about\r\n      parole law from \"a host of other possible similar prejudices.\" The\r\n      views of a lay venireman about parole are no more likely to be both\r\n      erroneous and prejudicial than are his views on the defendant's right\r\n      not to take the stand, the law of parties, the reasonable doubt standard,\r\n      or any other matter of criminal procedure. It is difficult to conceive\r\n      how we could constitutionalize the inquiry concerning Texas parole\r\n      while leaving these similar but also potentially influential matters to\r\n      the broad discretion of the state trial court. In fact, we have\r\n      previously declined to sanction constitutional challenges to the failure\r\n      to conduct voir dire on the range of punishment for an offense and the\r\n      meaning of certain words in the capital murder statute. Interrogating\r\n      veniremen about Texas parole law raises, if anything, a more\r\n      attenuated possibility of prejudice than does a question about jurors'\r\n      attitudes toward people with beards. The specific inquiry does not\r\n      approach a level of constitutional sensitivity.\r\n\nId. at 1059.15\r\n\r\n       In my view, the trial court's limitations in the instant case did not violate\r\nAppellant's constitutional rights and comport with this Court's established\r\nprecedent regarding voir dire's proper contours. The trial court properly restrained\r\nAppellant's defense counsel from improperly questioning potential jurors regarding\r\ntheir interpretation of applicable law, or hypothetical situations, and thus there is\r\nno reversible error.      IV.    Qualification of Juror #203\r\n       Appellant argues that the trial court erred in finding Juror #203 unqualified.\r\nI disagree.\r\n\r\n       A prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his views on capital\r\npunishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as\r\na juror in accordance with instructions and his oath. State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283,\r\n290–91, 621 S.E.2d 883, 886 (2005). When reviewing the trial court's\r\nqualification of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged juror must be\r\nexamined in light of the entire voir dire. Id. at 291, 621 S.E.2d at 886. The\r\ndetermination of whether a juror is qualified to serve in a capital case is within the\r\nsole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal unless wholly\r\nunsupported by the evidence. Id. A juror's disqualification will not be disturbed\r\non appeal if there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have\r\nconcluded that the juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his\r\nresponsibilities as a juror under the law. Id. at 291, 621 S.E.2d at 887.\r\n\r\n       The Record in this case demonstrates that Juror #203 provided conflicting\r\nand inconsistent answers regarding her ability to render a death sentence in\r\nresponse to questioning from the trial court, defense counsel, and the State. For\r\nexample, Juror #203 initially stated that she could sentence a defendant to life\r\nimprisonment without parole or the death penalty depending on what the facts of\r\nthe case \"warranted.\" Juror #203 appeared to confirm her view during defense\r\ncounsel's initial examination. The State noted during its examination of Juror #203\r\nthat she hesitated in answering the trial court whether she could render a death\r\nsentence. In response to the State's questions Juror #203 stated that she was \"not\r\n\r\n15See State v. Matthews, 296 S.C. 379, 384, 373 S.E.2d 587, 590 (1988) (relying\r\non King in holding that the defendant was not entitled to probe potential jurors'\r\nmisconceptions regarding the definition of \"life imprisonment\").\r\n\npositively sure,\" she could take part in a death sentence. However, Juror #203's\r\nanswer changed during the defense's re-examination and she confirmed that she\r\ncould \"give meaningful consideration to a death sentence as well as a life\r\nsentence.\"\r\n\r\n       The trial court then re-examined Juror #203 and the juror stated she could be\r\nfair and impartial juror and could consider life without parole or the death penalty.\r\nNevertheless, under another re-examination by the State, Juror #203 provided a\r\nconflicting answer:\r\n\r\n      The State: \t           Let me ask you this: Would your feelings about\r\n                             signing a death verdict do you think that would\r\n                             interfere with your ability to sit as a juror in a\r\n                             death penalty case? I know you've had a lot of\r\n                             hesitation about whether or not you could sign\r\n                             your name and do that. Do you think that your\r\n                             feelings on that would interfere with your ability to\r\n                             be an effective juror in a death penalty case?\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                               I do.\r\n\r\n      The State: \t           You think it would? I understand. Like I said,\r\n                             there's nothing right or wrong about it, it's just\r\n                             what you feel . . . .\r\n\r\n      Appellant's trial counsel attempted to clarify Juror #203's responses and\r\ninquired,\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t       No matter how it made you feel, if you felt like the\r\n                             death penalty was appropriate, you could sign your\r\n                             name to the form, correct?\r\n\r\n      Juror #203:        \t                                                 Correct.\r\n\r\n      Trial counsel: \t       Even if it made you feel a little uneasy, if that was\r\n                             your decision, you could sign your name?\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                        Correct.\r\n\n       However, the trial court interceded and questioned Juror #203 further on her\r\npositive response to the State's question as to whether the juror's feelings would\r\ninterfere with her ability to be an effective juror. The trial court and Juror #203\r\nthen engaged in the following exchange:\r\n\r\n      Trial court: \t      Do you feel like because of your beliefs, because \n\r\n                          of your feelings, your hesitation given the death \n\r\n                          penalty, that your beliefs would be such that it \n\r\n                          would—your feelings would be such that it would \n\r\n                          interfere with your ability to perform your duties \n\r\n                          as a juror? \n\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                    Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      Trial court: \t                       And that's because of your beliefs; is that correct?\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                    Correct.\r\n\r\n      Trial court: \t      So you do not feel like you could adequately \n\r\n                          perform your duties as a juror because you would \n\r\n                          be hindered somewhat because of your beliefs? \n\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                    Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n      Trial court: \t      And that's your beliefs that are somewhat exhibited \n\r\n                          through your hesitancy in your responses to the \n\r\n                          death penalty questions? \n\r\n\r\n      Juror #203: \t                                                    Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n        The trial court then found Juror #203 unqualified to serve as a juror. The\r\ntrial court's reasoning bears duplication here:\r\n\r\n      I find that [Juror #203] is not qualified. Considering the entire \n\r\n      colloquy, even going back to my initial questioning of [Juror #203], \n\r\n      there was a very, very long pause when I asked her if she could return \n\r\n      a sentence of death. Not only that, her—my observations of her \n\r\n      demeanor, being within two feet, I guess, of her and looking down \n\r\n      into her face, it appeared somewhat of concern to her, somewhat of a \n\r\n      pained, emotional expression on her face . . . . Then beyond \n\r\n      equivocation, as I recall, [the State] asked her about signing her name\n\r\n      and then asked if she thought her feelings about the death penalty \n\r\n\n      would interfere with her abilities to serve as a juror. And she said, \"I\r\n      do.\" I came back and attempted to clarify some of her responses\r\n      because I think some of her responses were inconsistent between our\r\n      various questioning. And she clearly stated that she felt that her\r\n      feelings or her beliefs were such that it would interfere with her ability\r\n      to perform her duties and follow her oath as a juror . . . . I think she\r\n      did equivocate. I think her views and her responses as a whole would\r\n      impair her ability to act as an impartial juror. Therefore, considering\r\n      the voir dire as a whole, I find that [Juror #203] is not qualified.\r\n\r\n      In my view, this Court's decision in State v. Lindsey, 372 S.C. 185, 642\r\nS.E.2d 557 (2007), cert. denied, 552 U.S. 917 (2007), is instructive.\r\n\r\n       In Lindsay, the appellant claimed the trial court erred in excusing a juror\r\nbecause of his views regarding the death penalty. Id. at 190, 642 S.E.2d at 559–60.\r\nDuring initial questioning, the trial court asked the juror if he could impose the\r\ndeath penalty, and the juror replied, \"I really don't know. I really don't know if I\r\ncould or not.\" Id., 642 S.E.2d at 560. During the defense counsel's voir dire, the\r\njuror stated that he could listen to both sides and render what he felt was the\r\nappropriate penalty whether that was life imprisonment or death. Id. However,\r\nduring the State's questioning, the juror equivocated, stating:\r\n\r\n      Most of the time I feel it is a better punishment to be in prison for life.\r\n      I believe that death is not as big of a punishment as going to prison for\r\n      life and having to stay in prison for the rest of your life.\r\n\r\nId. at 191, 642 S.E.2d at 560. The juror explained that his belief that life without\r\nparole was a more serious punishment than death would \"most likely,\" but not\r\n\"necessarily,\" lead him to choose life imprisonment over death during the trial's\r\nsentencing phase. Id.\r\n\r\n       The trial court ruled that the juror's belief regarding life imprisonment and\r\nthe death penalty would substantially impair the juror's ability to follow the law as\r\ninstructed, and noted that when asked about the death penalty the juror \"took a very\r\nbig deep [breath] and exhaled as if he were very uncertain as to whether or not he\r\ncould do that.\" Id. at 192, 642 S.E.2d at 561 (\"The [trial court] concluded 'from\r\nwatching' him and considering his inconsistent responses, that [the juror] should be\r\nexcused.\").\r\n\r\n      This Court found the juror's ambivalent views concerning the death penalty\r\nsupported the trial court's ruling, holding:\r\n\n      Juror K's equivocal views regarding the death penalty, his responses\r\n      favoring a life sentence despite the facts of the case, and his noted\r\n      hesitation when asked if he could vote for death, are a reasonable\r\n      basis for the trial judge's conclusion that Juror K's views would\r\n      substantially impair his ability to act as an impartial juror.\r\n      Considering the voir dire as a whole, we find the trial judge did not\r\n      abuse his discretion in excusing this juror.\r\n\r\nId. at 193, 642 S.E.2d at 561; see also State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 355, 392\r\nS.E.2d 157, 161 (1990), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 (1990) (holding that a trial\r\ncourt's disqualification of a prospective juror will not be disturbed where there is a\r\nreasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded that the juror\r\nwould not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a juror\r\nunder the law).\r\n\r\n        Accordingly, in my view, the Record demonstrates evidence supporting the\r\ntrial court's disqualification of Juror #203. Analogous to the juror in Lindsay, Juror\r\n#203 provided equivocal views regarding the death penalty, and at times expressly\r\nstated that these views would prohibit the juror's ability to perform the required\r\nduties. Thus, in my opinion, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in excusing\r\na juror that explicitly stated that the juror's views on capital punishment would\r\nprevent the performance of his duties.\r\n\r\n\r\n          V.     The Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (IAD)\r\n      Appellant argues that the trial court erred by failing to dismiss the\r\nindictments against him because of the State's noncompliance with the Interstate\r\nAgreement on Detainers Act (the IAD). I disagree.\r\n\r\n        The IAD is a compact enabling participating states to obtain custody of\r\nprisoners incarcerated in other participating jurisdictions and bring those prisoners\r\nto trial. Reed v. Farley, 512 U.S. 339, 340 (1994). The central purpose of the IAD\r\nis to allow participating states to uniformly and expeditiously dispose of charges\r\npending against prisoners held out-of-state. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-11-10 (2003);\r\nState v. Adams, 354 S.C. 361, 370, 580 S.E.2d 785, 790 (2004).\r\n\r\n        The IAD's third article addresses an inmate's request for a final disposition\r\nof outstanding charges against her in another state. S.C. Code Ann. § 17-11-10,\r\nart. III. Article III provides that an inmate shall be brought to trial within one\r\nhundred eighty days following the delivery of written notice to \"the prosecuting\r\n\nofficer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction\" of the\r\ninmate's place of his imprisonment and request for a final disposition of untried\r\nindictments or complaints. Id. However, the court having jurisdiction of the\r\nmatter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance provided that good\r\ncause supports the continuance. Id. Section 17-11-10's Article IV provides a\r\nsimilar method for a state to have an inmate incarcerated in another state delivered\r\nfor the purposes of resolving any untried indictments or complaints. Id. § 17-11-\r\n10, art. IV. However, article IV's subsection (c) provides that any proceedings\r\nenacted via article IV must be commenced within one hundred twenty days of the\r\ninmates arrival in the receiving state. Id. Nevertheless, as in article III, the\r\npresiding court may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance supported by\r\ngood cause. Id.\r\n\r\n        In the instant case, Appellant made an initial demand pursuant to the IAD on\r\nFebruary 12, 2005. Prior to that request, a Georgia court convicted Appellant for\r\nkidnapping and sentenced him to life imprisonment. The solicitor informed the\r\ntrial court that the instant case would proceed as a death penalty case, and, on May\r\n27, 2005, the trial court ruled good cause had been shown as to why the case could\r\nnot be handled within 180 days. The case was later scheduled for trial in 2008.\r\nHowever, in March 2008, Appellant's defense counsel requested a continuance\r\nbecause of an issue with a mitigation specialist. The Record does not explain the\r\nunderlying reason for the significant delay in scheduling the instant case for trial.\r\nHowever, although this type of delay is unacceptable, Appellant fails to\r\ndemonstrate that the delay resulted in any prejudice, and therefore, the trial court's\r\nrefusal to dismiss the indictments against Appellant does not warrant reversal.\r\n\r\n      For example, in State v. Allen, 269 S.C. 233, 237 S.E.2d 64 (1977), the State\r\ncharged the defendants with burglary. The burglary occurred on October 11, 1973,\r\nand thirteen days later, Georgia police arrested the defendants in that state on\r\nunrelated bank robbery charges. Id. at 236, 237 S.E.2d at 65. Subsequently, a\r\nGeorgia court convicted the defendants and imposed a prison sentence. Id. In\r\nNovember 1973, South Carolina authorities issued arrest warrants for the\r\ndefendants and a South Carolina grand jury indicted the defendants in September\r\n1975. Id. at 236, 237 S.E.2d at 65–66. Authorities brought the defendants to\r\nSouth Carolina and provided notice of the charges pending in this state. Id. The\r\ndefendants moved for a continuance, and authorities returned the defendants to\r\nGeorgia to await trial. Id. at 236, 237 S.E.2d at 66. Thereafter, the defendants\r\nwere brought to South Carolina and tried in March 1976. Id. The defendants were\r\nconvicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. Id. at 235, 237 S.E.2d at 65.\r\n\n       The defendants argued, inter alia, that their transfer to Georgia prior to trial\r\nviolated the IAD's article IV (e) which provides:\r\n\r\n      If trial is not had on any indictment, information or complaint\r\n      contemplated hereby prior to the prisoner's being returned to the\r\n      original place of imprisonment . . . such indictment, information or\r\n      complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court\r\n      shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 17-11-10, art. IV(e). This Court disagreed, noting that the\r\ndefendants could not demonstrate that the delay in their case resulted in any\r\nprejudice:\r\n\r\n      Where a prisoner seeks and obtains a delay of his trial in the receiving\r\n      State and is returned to the sending State to await trial, it does not\r\n      mean that he waives his constitutional right to a speedy trial, but it\r\n      does remove his case from the scope of the automatic dismissal\r\n      provisions of the statute. In the absence of a showing of prejudice\r\n      from his return to the sending State after his request for a continuance\r\n      is granted, the prisoner would not be entitled to a dismissal of the\r\n      charges against him, as a matter of right, under the provisions of the\r\n      statute. The record in this case fails to show any prejudice to\r\n      appellants from their return to Georgia to await trial, after the trial of\r\n      the present charges was continued at their request. The trial judge,\r\n      therefore, properly refused appellants' motions to dismiss the\r\n      indictments in this case because of the alleged failure to grant a\r\n      speedy trial.\r\n\r\nAllen, 269 S.C. at 239, 237 S.E.2d at 67 (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n       I also find the United States Supreme Court's decision in Reed v. Farley, 512\r\nU.S. 339 (1994), instructive. In that case, the Supreme Court analyzed whether a\r\nviolation of the IAD's time limitations could serve as the basis of a state prisoner's\r\nhabeas corpus petition. In December 1982, Orrin Reed was confined to a federal\r\nprison in Terre Haute, Indiana, when Indiana state prosecutors charged him with\r\ntheft. Id. at 342. Indiana authorities lodged a detainer against Reed and took\r\ncustody of him on April 27, 1983. According to the IAD, absent any continuances,\r\nReed's trial should have commenced on or before August 25, 1983. Id. The trial\r\ncourt held two pretrial conferences, on June 27 and August 1, 1983. Id. At the\r\nJune 27 conference, the court set a September 13, 1983 trial date, exceeding the\r\n\nIAD's 120-day limit. Id. at 343. However, neither the prosecutor nor Reed\r\nbrought this to the trial court's attention or asked for a different trial date. Id. At\r\nthe August 1 conference, Reed explained his imminent release from federal\r\ncustody and requested the trial court set bond. Id. The trial court set bond at\r\n$25,000 and because of a calendar conflict, reset the trial date to September 19. Id.\r\nReed did not express any objection to the September 19 trial date. Id.\r\n\r\n       On August 29, four days prior to trial, Reed alleged that Indiana failed to try\r\nhim within 120 days of his transfer and had therefore violated the IAD. Id. at 344.\r\nThe trial court rejected Reed's argument, explaining:\r\n\r\n      Today is the first day I was aware that there was a 120 day limitation\r\n      on the Detainer Act. The Court made its setting and while there has\r\n      been a request for moving the trial forward, there has not been any\r\n      speedy trial request filed, nor has there been anything in the nature of\r\n      an objection to the trial setting, but only an urging that it be done\r\n      within the guidelines that have been set out.\r\n\r\nId.    On the morning of the trial date, September 19, Reed filed a motion for\r\ncontinuance, arguing he needed additional time for trial preparation as a result of a\r\nnewspaper article detailing the 1954 to 1980 timeframe of Reed's prior felony\r\nconvictions. Id. The trial court, recognizing the possible prejudice, offered Reed\r\nthree options: (1) start the trial on schedule; (2) postpone the trial for one week; or\r\n(3) continue the trial to a late October date. Id. at 345. Reed chose the third option\r\nand the trial began on October 18, 1983. The jury convicted Reed of theft, and\r\nfound him to be habitual offender. Id. Reed received consecutive sentence of four\r\nyears' imprisonment for theft and thirty years imprisonment for the habitual\r\noffender conviction. Id. One of Reed's primary assertions was that the IAD's time\r\nlimit effectuated the Sixth Amendment's guarantee of a speedy trial right. Id. at\r\n352. Thus, according to Reed, the Supreme Court should view the alleged\r\nviolation of the IAD as a \"fundamental defect,\" entitling Reed to habeas relief. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court disagreed. Much of the Supreme Court's reasoning\r\ncentered on the appropriate standard for federal habeas relief, and therefore is not\r\nrelated to the instant case. However, in my opinion, the Court's acknowledgement\r\nthat Reed suffered no prejudice is pertinent. The Court explained:\r\n\r\n      Reed's trial commenced 54 days after the 120-day period expired. He\r\n      does not suggest that his ability to present a defense was prejudiced by\r\n\n      the delay. Nor could he plausibly make such a claim. Indeed,\r\n      asserting a need for more time to prepare for a trial that would be \"fair\r\n      and meaningful . . . . Reed himself requested a delay beyond the\r\n      scheduled September 19 opening. A showing of prejudice is required\r\n      to establish a violation of the Sixth Amendment Speedy Trial Clause,\r\n      and that necessary ingredient is entirely missing here.\r\n\r\nId. at 353.\r\n\r\n       Appellant fails to establish any prejudice resulting from the delay in this\r\ncase. The Record does not indicate that Appellant requested the trial court clarify\r\nthe length of the original continuance, or that Appellant renewed his motion during\r\nthe three year period following the trial court's continuance. More importantly,\r\nAppellant does not demonstrate that the delay adversely impacted his case, or that\r\nan earlier trial would have resulted in a different verdict and sentence. Cf. id. at\r\n353 n.11 (\"As the Court of Appeals noted: 'Had Indiana put Reed on trial within\r\n120 days of his transfer from federal prison, everything would have proceeded as it\r\ndid. Reed does not contend that vital evidence fell into the prosecutor's hands (or\r\nslipped through his own fingers) between August 26 and September 19, 1983.'\"\r\n(citing Reed v. Clark, 984 F.2d 209, 212 (7th Cir. 1993)).\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, the State complied with the IAD's requirements, and the trial\r\ncourt's continuance satisfied the IAD's continuance provisions. Thus, I would find\r\nAppellant's argument regarding the IAD without merit.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent. In my opinion, this Court should\r\naffirm Appellant's conviction and sentence.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27349","title":"In the Matter of Shana Denice Jones-Burgess","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27349.pdf","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspends a lawyer.","date":"2014-01-15","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n             In the Matter of Shana Denice Jones-Burgess,\r\n             Respondent\r\n\r\n             Appellate Case No. 2013-002353\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Opinion No. 27349\r\n             Submitted November 22, 2013 – Filed January 15, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n                            DEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n             Lesley M.

Respondent\r\nfailed to keep Client A reasonably informed about the status of Client A's case and\r\nfailed to diligently represent Client A. Client A terminated respondent's service\r\nprior to the filing of the action. Respondent failed to refund Client A's fees and\r\nexpenses that were not yet earned or incurred.\r\n\r\nOn October 11, 2010, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen (15) days. When no response was\r\nreceived, respondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy,\r\n277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting respondent's response.\r\nRespondent's written response was received by ODC on December 22, 2010, fifty-\r\nseven (57) days after the original due date.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to represent Client B in a social security disability matter.\r\nRespondent failed to keep Client B reasonably informed about the status of Client\r\nB's case.

Client I met with\r\nrespondent in November 2011 and has had no contact with respondent since that\r\ntime. Respondent closed her law office but failed to timely notify the client of a\r\nnew address or contact number.\r\n\r\nOn March 27, 2012 respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen (15) days. When no response was\r\nreceived, respondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy,\r\n\nid., again requesting respondent's response. Respondent failed to respond to the\r\nNotice of Investigation despite the Treacy letter.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter XI\r\n\r\nIn March 2009, respondent was retained to represent Client J and her husband in an\r\nadoption action. It was agreed, Client J would make monthly payments towards\r\nthe quoted fee of $3,150.00 before respondent would begin work on the case. In\r\nApril 2010, respondent agreed to begin the adoption proceedings. In September\r\n2010, Client J paid the balance of the quoted retainer fee in full.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to adequately communicate with Client J and failed to keep\r\nClient J reasonably informed regarding the status of the case. In April 2012, Client\r\nJ went to respondent's office and discovered the law office was closed.\r\nRespondent had closed her law office but failed to notify Client J of a new address\r\nor contact number. Respondent also failed to refund Client J's fees and expenses\r\nthat had yet been earned or incurred.\r\n\r\nOn March 13, 2013, respondent was mailed a Notice of Investigation requesting a\r\nresponse to the complaint within fifteen (15) days. When no response was\r\nreceived, respondent was served with a letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy,\r\nid., again requesting respondent's response. Respondent failed to respond to the\r\nNotice of Investigation despite the Treacy letter.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4\r\n(lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of case and promptly\r\ncomply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold\r\nproperty of clients or third persons that is in lawyer's possession in connection with\r\na representation separate from lawyer's own property and shall promptly deliver\r\nfunds deliver to client or third person any funds or other property that the client or\r\nthird person is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16 (upon termination of representation,\r\nlawyer shall take steps to the extent reasonably practicable to protect client's\r\ninterests, such as giving reasonable notice to the client, allowing time for\r\nemployment of other counsel, surrendering papers and property to which the client\r\nis entitled, and refunding any advance payment of fee or expense that has not been\r\nearned or incurred); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to\r\n\nlawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it shall\r\nbe ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and\r\nRule 8.4(e) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct that is\r\nprejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits she has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\n\r\n                                     Conclusion\r\n\r\nWhile we do not condone respondent's failure to diligently protect the interests of\r\nher clients and timely respond to inquiries from ODC, we recognize that, during\r\nthe period of time reported in this opinion, respondent was battling several serious\r\nand recurring health concerns and related treatment. Accordingly, we accept the\r\nAgreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of\r\nlaw for twelve (12) months retroactive to date of her interim suspension.1 In\r\naddition, respondent shall pay the costs incurred in the investigation and\r\nprosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission within thirty (30) days of\r\nthe date of this order.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent's disciplinary history includes a 2010 confidential admonition citing\r\nRules 1.4, 5.3, and 8.1, RPC, upon which the Court may rely in imposing a\r\nsanction. See Rule 7(b)(4), RLDE (admonition may be used in subsequent\r\nproceedings as evidence of prior misconduct solely upon issue of sanction to be\r\nimposed). In addition, respondent received a letter of caution in 2007 warning her\r\nto be careful to adhere to the requirements of Rules 1.3, 1.4, and 8.4(a), RPC,\r\nindicating misconduct relevant to the misconduct in the current Agreement. See\r\nRule 2(r), RLDE (fact that letter of caution has been issued shall not be considered\r\nin a subsequent disciplinary proceeding against lawyer unless the caution or\r\nwarning contained in letter of caution is relevant to the misconduct alleged in\r\nproceedings). Respondent also entered into a Deferred Discipline Agreement in\r\n2009 citing Rules 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 8.1(b), and 8.4(a), RPC, indicating misconduct\r\nrelevant to the misconduct in the current Agreement. See In the Matter of Toney,\r\n396 S.C. 303, 721 S.E.2d 437 (2012) (Court considered prior Deferred Discipline\r\nAgreement involving similar misconduct in concluding that lawyer's disciplinary\r\nhistory demonstrated a pattern of misconduct).\r\n\nPrior to filing a Petition for Reinstatement, respondent shall pay restitution as\r\nfollows: a) Client A - $1,900.00; b) Client G - $1,650.00; c) Client I - $1,400.00;\r\nd) Guardian ad Litem (Matter V)- $1,000.00; and e) Client J - $3,150.00. The\r\namount due to these individuals shall be reduced by any payments made to the\r\nindividuals by the Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection (Lawyers' Fund). Should\r\nthe Lawyers' Fund reimburse any of these individuals, respondent shall reimburse\r\nthe Lawyers' Fund for all payments before filing a Petition for Reinstatement.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit\r\nwith the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27350","title":"In the Matter of Scott Christen Allmon","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27350.pdf","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspends a lawyer.","date":"2014-01-15","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of Scott Christen Allmon, Respondent\r\n\r\n            Appellate Case No. 2013-002446\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Opinion No. 27350\r\n             Submitted November 22, 2013 – Filed January 15, 2014\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lesley M.

In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\nthe imposition of a definite suspension of no less than nine (9) months to no more\r\nthan three (3) years. He requests any period of suspension be made retroactive to\r\nJanuary 16, 2013, the date of his interim suspension. In the Matter of Allmon, 402\r\nS.C. 224, 741 S.E.2d 694 (2013). In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs\r\nincurred in the investigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the\r\nCommission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30) days of the\r\nimposition of discipline. He further agrees to complete all terms of his criminal\r\nsentence, including payment of restitution and completion of probation, prior to\r\nfiling a Petition for Reinstatement. Finally, respondent agrees to complete the\r\nLegal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School prior to reinstatement. We\r\naccept the Agreement and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state\r\nfor one (1) year, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension. In addition, we\r\n\nimpose the conditions as stated hereafter in this opinion. The facts, as set forth in\r\nthe Agreement, are as follows.          Facts\r\n\r\nRespond self-reported his arraignment on an information alleging a violation of 18\r\nU.S.C. § 1001(a), alleging he knowingly and willfully made a false, fraudulent,\r\nand fictitious material statement to a federal agency. Specifically, respondent was\r\naccused of indicating on a settlement statement that a purchaser made a $15,000\r\ndeposit towards the purchase of property when no deposit had been made.\r\nRespondent later waived indictment and pled guilty without a plea agreement. On\r\nAugust 8, 2013, he was sentenced to five (5) years of probation and ordered to pay\r\na $100 assessment and $134,999.95 in restitution to the lender.\r\n\r\nAlthough not specifically indicated in the information or during the guilty plea,\r\nrespondent falsely attributed the payment of the $15,000 to the purchaser who was\r\nhis wife. The purchase was for property located in a now defunct subdivision.\r\nRespondent explains he had provided legal service for the subdivision's developer\r\nand was owed a substantial amount of money in legal fees. The day before the\r\nclosing, the developer advised respondent that his wife was required to make a\r\n10% earnest money deposit. Respondent had previously been told the purchase\r\nwould be 100% financing and replied that it would take two weeks to get the\r\nearnest money deposit. Anxious to close the loan, the developer proposed treating\r\nthe earnest money deposit as an exchange of services and said they could \"settle\r\nup\" any outstanding amount owed at the end of the project. Respondent proceeded\r\nwith the developer's proposal even though he knew it rendered the settlement\r\nstatement false and misleading.          Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 4.1(a) (in course of\r\nrepresenting client, lawyer shall not make false statement of material fact to third\r\nperson); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a criminal\r\nact that reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness, or fitness as a\r\nlawyer); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct\r\ninvolving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to the\r\nadministration of justice).\r\n\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it is ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violated Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(4)(it is\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to be convicted of a serious crime); and Rule\r\n7(a)(5) (it is ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to\r\npollute the administration of justice or bring the courts or legal profession into\r\ndisrepute).                          Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from\r\nthe practice of law for one (1) year, retroactive to the date of his interim\r\nsuspension. Respondent shall complete all terms of his criminal sentence,\r\nincluding payment of restitution and completion of probation, prior to filing a\r\nPetition for Reinstatement. Further, respondent shall provide proof of completion\r\nof the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School to the Commission prior to\r\nhis reinstatement, if any, to the practice of law.

Within fifteen (15) days\r\nof the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\nshowing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27351","title":"White Oak Manor v.

The circuit court upheld the\r\nservice-of-suit clause and refused to relieve the insurer from default judgment.\r\nThe court of appeals reversed, holding section 15-9-270 provides the exclusive\r\nmethod for serving an insurance company. White Oak Manor, Inc. v. Lexington\r\nIns. Co., 394 S.C. 375, 382, 715 S.E.2d 383, 387 (Ct. App. 2011). We disagree\r\nthat section 15-9-270 provides the exclusive means of service on an insurer and\r\nhold that insurance policy provisions creating alternative methods of service are\r\nvalid and binding on insurers. Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals.\r\n\r\n                    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\n       White Oak Manor, Inc. owns and operates a nursing home in York, South\r\nCarolina. After sustaining injuries from the improper replacement of a feeding\r\ntube, a White Oak resident filed a lawsuit against the nursing home. White Oak\r\nultimately settled the lawsuit without the involvement of its insurer, Lexington\r\nInsurance Company.\r\n\r\n      White Oak subsequently filed this declaratory judgment action against\r\nLexington to determine coverage for the malpractice claim. The policies between\r\nWhite Oak and Lexington contained a service-of-suit clause which provided:\r\n\r\n      It is further agreed that service of process in such suit may be made\r\n      upon Counsel, Legal Department, Lexington Insurance Company, 200\r\n      State Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02109 or his or her representative,\r\n      and that in any suit instituted against us upon this Policy, we will\r\n      abide by the final decision of such court or of any appellate court in\r\n      the event of any appeal.\r\n\r\n      In compliance with the policy provision, White Oak served Lexington by\r\nmailing the summons and complaint by certified mail, return receipt requested, to\r\n\"Lexington Insurance Company, 200 State Street, Boston, MA 02109, ATTN:\r\nLEGAL DEPARTMENT.\" According to the return receipt, service was accepted\r\n\nMay 20, 2005, and signed for by a Thomas W. Dinam. After Lexington failed to\r\nrespond within thirty days, a default judgment was entered against Lexington on\r\nJuly 15, 2005. Approximately two months later, White Oak amended its\r\ncomplaint, alleging Lexington was in default and moving for damages. It again\r\nserved the amended summons and complaint on Lexington by mail.\r\n\r\n        Thereafter, Lexington filed an answer and counterclaim as well as a motion\r\nto set aside the entry of default, alleging insufficient service of process. At the\r\nhearing, Lexington offered three alternative arguments in support of its motion.\r\nInitially, Lexington argued service on an insurance company could only be\r\neffectuated pursuant to section 15-9-270, which requires service of process be\r\nthrough the Director of the Department of Insurance, and any contrary contractual\r\nprovisions were invalid. Additionally, Lexington argued that even if White Oak\r\nlegally served it pursuant to the contract, service was nevertheless ineffective\r\nbecause White Oak did not substantially comply with the contractual provisions.\r\nIn particular, Lexington noted that although it had documentation that it received\r\nthe summons and complaint, it had no record of an employee named Thomas W.\r\nDinam, and he was neither counsel nor counsel's \"representative.\" Furthermore,\r\nLexington argued good cause existed to set aside the default.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court denied the motion, holding Lexington and White Oak\r\nagreed contractually to another means of service and therefore, service through the\r\nDirector was not required. It further held White Oak substantially complied with\r\nthe service-of-suit clause in the policy and noted Lexington in fact received the\r\noriginal summons and complaint, but lost them. The court also found Lexington\r\nfailed to demonstrate good cause for setting aside the default, citing caselaw\r\nproviding that losing a complaint is not a basis to set aside default. Thereafter, the\r\ncircuit court considered White Oak's motion for damages and entered a judgment\r\nagainst Lexington for $153,266.\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals reversed, holding the \"service of suit clause did not\r\nabsolve White Oak of the responsibility to comply with the requirement in section\r\n15–9–270 that it deliver two copies of its summons and complaint to the Director\r\nof the Department of Insurance in order to serve process on Lexington.\" White\r\nOak, 394 S.C. at 382, 715 S.E.2d at 387. Specifically, it noted that service on the\r\nDirector was \"a right granted to the Department to enable it to fulfill the\r\nresponsibilities with which it has been charged\" and Lexington's policy could not\r\nwaive the Department's right. Id. at 382, 715 S.E.2d at 386.\r\n\n                                  ISSUES PRESENTED \n\r\n\r\n   I.\t       Did the court of appeals err in holding service on an insurance company\r\n             can only be accomplished by compliance with section 15-9-270?\r\n\r\n   II.\t      Did the circuit court err in failing to set aside the entry of default?\r\n\r\n                                     LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I.\t       SOUTH CAROLINA CODE SECTION 15-9-270\r\n\r\n      White Oak argues the court of appeals erred in holding service pursuant to\r\nsection 15-9-270 was the only legally sufficient manner of service on an insurance\r\ncompany. We agree.\r\n\r\n       The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintent of the legislature, and the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of\r\nlegislative intent. Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).\r\nStatutory language \"must be construed in context and in light of the intended\r\npurpose of the statute in a manner which harmonizes with its subject matter and\r\naccords with its general purpose.\" Cabiness v. Town of James Island, 393 S.C.\r\n176, 192, 712 S.E.2d 416, 425 (2011) (internal quotations omitted). Where a\r\nstatute's language is plain and unambiguous, the Court has no right to impose\r\nanother meaning. Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581. Nevertheless,\r\n\"[h]owever plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the\r\ncourts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly\r\nabsurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would\r\ndefeat the plain legislative intention.\" Kiriakides v. United Artists Commc'ns, Inc.,\r\n312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994).\r\n\r\n          Section 15-9-270 states:\r\n\r\n          The summons and any other legal process in any action or proceeding\r\n          against it must be served on an insurance company . . . by delivering\r\n          two copies of the summons or any other legal process to the Director\r\n          of the Department of Insurance . . . . A company shall appoint the\r\n          director as its attorney pursuant to the provisions of Section 38-5-70.\r\n          This service is considered sufficient service upon the company. When\r\n          legal process against any company with the fee provided in this\r\n          section is served upon the director, he shall immediately forward by\r\n\n      registered or certified mail one of the duplicate copies prepaid\r\n      directed toward the company at its home office . . . .\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Section 38-5-70 of the South Carolina Code (2002) provides: \"Every\r\ninsurer shall, before being licensed, appoint in writing the director and his\r\nsuccessors in office to be its true and lawful attorney upon whom all legal process\r\nin any action or proceeding against it must be served . . . .\"\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals found the above quoted language mandated that any\r\nprocess served on an insurance company must be made through the Director.\r\nSpecifically, the court found section 15-9-270 provides the Director with the right\r\nto receive copies of any pleadings served on an insurance company and Lexington\r\ncould not waive a right it did not possess. In so concluding, the court noted the\r\nDirector was responsible to\r\n\r\n      (1) \"see that all laws of this State governing insurers or relating to the\r\n      business of insurance are faithfully executed[,]\" (2) \"report to the\r\n      Attorney General or other appropriate law enforcement officials\r\n      criminal violations of the laws relative to the business of insurance or\r\n      the provisions of this title which he considers necessary to report[,]\"\r\n      and (3) institute civil actions when appropriate.\r\n\r\nWhite Oak, 394 S.C. at 381, 715 S.E.2d at 386 (quoting S.C. Code Ann. § 38-3-\r\n110 (2002) (alterations in original)). Accordingly, the court reasoned \"the Director\r\nneeds to be informed when an insurer's misconduct is alleged to be sufficiently\r\nserious to warrant litigation\" and requiring service on \"the Director as a\r\nprerequisite to acquiring jurisdiction over the insurer is a reasonable and efficient\r\nway to achieve this objective.\" Id. at 381–82, 715 S.E.2d at 386.\r\n\r\n      White Oak argues the court of appeals' holding ignores the settled principle\r\nthat parties are free to agree to alternative methods of service, just as they may\r\nwaive service altogether. Furthermore, White Oak contends the conclusion that the\r\nDirector has a right to receive copies of the pleadings is not supported by any\r\nevidence or legislative history. We agree on both points.\r\n\r\n      \"The purpose of the summons is to acquire jurisdiction of the person of the\r\ndefendant and to give him notice of the action and an opportunity to appear and\r\ndefend.\" State v. Sanders, 118 S.C. 498, 502–03, 110 S.E. 808, 810 (1920).\r\nConsistent with this purpose, parties are generally permitted to agree to particular\r\n\nmethods of service or waiving service altogether. See Fin. Fed. Credit Inc. v.\r\nBrown, 384 S.C. 555, 565, 683 S.E.2d 486, 491 (2009) (\"[W]here service is\r\naccomplished in a manner consented to by the defendant, service of process is\r\nvalid and a court has jurisdiction over the defendant for purposes of entering\r\njudgment.\"); Myrtle Beach Lumber Co. v. Globe Int'l Corp., 281 S.C. 290, 292,\r\n315 S.E.2d 142, 143 (Ct. App. 1984) (\"[A] defendant may waive personal service\r\nby consent or by designating an agent to receive service of process.\").\r\nFurthermore, allowing for the waiver of service is consistent with the principle that\r\na defendant can waive personal jurisdiction. See Bakala v. Bakala, 352 S.C. 612,\r\n629, 576 S.E.2d 156, 165 (2003) (\"Objections to personal jurisdiction, unlike\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction, are waived unless raised.\"); see also Rule 4(d), SCRCP\r\n(\"Voluntary appearance by defendant is equivalent to personal service . . . .\").\r\n\r\n       We therefore cannot agree it was the intent of the legislature to circumvent\r\nthe long-standing rule that service can be consented to by the parties or waived\r\nentirely. Service of process is intended to provide notice and obtain personal\r\njurisdiction, and Lexington designated in its policy a method for an insured to\r\naccomplish both those goals. We hold Lexington is bound by its own policy's\r\nterms. We reject the notion that the statute is intended to allow an insurance\r\ncompany to prescribe a method of service in its policy and then declare its own\r\nprovision invalid under section 15-9-270. We have previously interpreted\r\ninsurance service statutes as \"designed by the legislature to provide a simple and\r\neasy method of obtaining jurisdiction over a foreign insurance company.\"\r\nEquilease Corp. v. Weathers, 275 S.C. 478, 483, 272 S.E.2d 789, 791 (1980).\r\nThus, their purpose is to provide an insured with a method to obtain service of\r\nprocess on insurance companies; it is not to serve as a shield for insurance\r\ncompanies, protecting them from their own policy terms.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, we find no support for the court of appeals' holding that\r\nservice on the Director is a requirement that cannot be waived because the Director\r\nhas a right to receive this information. Although the receipt of any legal process\r\ninvolving insurance companies might be helpful to the Director in carrying out his\r\nduties, we disagree that the plain language of the statute dictates personal\r\njurisdiction is contingent upon the Director's receipt of the pleadings. That holding\r\nwould lead to the absurd result that an insurance company could never waive a\r\nclaim of defective service, even by a voluntary appearance, because to do so would\r\nabridge the Director's right to be served.\r\n\n      Accordingly, we reverse the court of appeals and hold section 15-9-270 does\r\nnot provide the exclusive method of service on an insurance company.\r\n\r\n   II.   FAILURE TO SET ASIDE THE ENTRY OF DEFAULT\r\n\r\n      Lexington contends even if the service-of-suit clause is valid, the entry of\r\ndefault should be set aside on other grounds. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       Determining whether to set aside an entry of default lies solely within the\r\nsound discretion of the circuit court and that decision will not be overturned absent\r\na clear showing of an abuse of discretion. Richardson v. P.V., Inc., 383 S.C. 610,\r\n614, 682 S.E.2d 263, 265 (2009). The Court has never required exacting\r\ncompliance with the rules to effect service of process, but instead looks to whether\r\nthe plaintiff substantially complied with the rules such that the court has personal\r\njurisdiction over the defendant and the defendant has notice of the proceedings.\r\nRoche v. Young Bros., Inc. of Florence, 318 S.C. 207, 209–10, 456 S.E.2d 897,\r\n899 (1995).\r\n\r\n   A. Compliance with the Service-of-Suit Clause\r\n\r\n       Lexington argues White Oak did not comply with the terms of the service-\r\nof-suit clause. Specifically, Lexington asserts the provision required service be\r\ndirected to \"Counsel . . . or his or her representative\" whereas White Oak addressed\r\nthe pleadings to \"Attn: LEGAL DEPARTMENT.\" Lexington also contends the\r\nperson who signed the return receipt was not authorized to receive service as\r\nrequired by Rule 4(d)(8). We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court determined White Oak substantially complied with the\r\nservice-of-suit clause set forth in the insurance policy. The court found that\r\nalthough the pleadings were not addressed to \"Counsel,\" because the clause\r\nallowed for service on counsel's \"representative,\" White Oak addressing the\r\npleadings to the legal department constituted substantial compliance. The court\r\nalso found it significant that Lexington acknowledged the complaint was received\r\nby its claims counsel.\r\n\r\n       We find the circuit court did not abuse its discretion in holding White Oak\r\nsubstantially complied with the service-of-suit clause. The communication was\r\ndirected to the legal department, and the mere omission of the word \"Counsel\" in\r\nthe address did not render service ineffective.\r\n\n   B. Good Cause\r\n\r\n      Lexington also argues the circuit court erred in failing to set aside the default\r\nbecause it has shown good cause to grant relief under Rule 55(c). We disagree.\r\n\r\n        The standard for granting relief from an entry of default under Rule 55(c) is\r\nmere \"good cause.\" Rule 55(c), SCRCP. \"This standard requires a party seeking\r\nrelief from an entry of default under Rule 55(c) to provide an explanation for the\r\ndefault and give reasons why vacation of the default entry would serve the interests\r\nof justice.\" Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge Indus., Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 607, 681\r\nS.E.2d 885, 888 (2009). \"Once a party has put forth a satisfactory explanation for\r\nthe default, the trial court must also consider: (1) the timing of the motion for\r\nrelief; (2) whether the defendant has a meritorious defense; and (3) the degree of\r\nprejudice to the plaintiff if relief is granted.\" Id. at 607–08, 681 S.E.2d at 888.\r\n\r\n      Lexington asserts it replied promptly after discovering the default, it\r\npresented evidence of a meritorious defense, and White Oak would suffer no\r\nprejudice if the relief was granted. The circuit court held Lexington provided no\r\nreasonable explanation for why it failed to respond to the initial complaint. The\r\ncourt found the only excuse offered was that Lexington lost the pleadings and\r\nconcluding that ground was insufficient, denied the motion.\r\n\r\n       Lexington argues the circuit court erred in relying on this Court's holding in\r\nRoche that losing a summons and complaint is never a ground to set aside a default\r\njudgment. It notes the standard for reviewing a motion for relief from default\r\nunder Rule 55(c) and a motion for relief from a default judgment under 60(b) are\r\ndistinct. Although we acknowledge the standard under Rule 60(b) is more rigorous\r\nthan \"good cause\" under Rule 55(c), we find no error in the court's holding that\r\nlosing the complaint was not \"good cause.\" The circuit court acted within its\r\ndiscretion in concluding that losing a complaint was not a satisfactory explanation\r\nfor failing to timely respond.\r\n\r\n   C. Other Equitable Considerations\r\n\r\n       Lexington finally argues the Court should set aside the entry of default\r\nbecause White Oak failed to serve a courtesy copy of the complaint on Lexington's\r\nattorney. We disagree.\r\n\n       As Lexington acknowledges, nothing in the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure requires the service of a courtesy copy of the summons and complaint\r\non opposing counsel. Furthermore, we find no inequity in White Oak's actions.\r\nWe fail to see how serving an insurance company in accordance with its own\r\nservice-of-suit clause can be characterized as unfair or an attempt to take advantage\r\nof the attorney. Instead, we find it would be inequitable to fault White Oak for not\r\nserving an additional courtesy copy in case the insurance company lost the\r\npleadings.                       CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we reverse the court of appeals' opinion and affirm\r\nthe circuit court's order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent and would affirm the\r\ndecision of the Court of Appeals. First, the statutes and case law are clear:\r\nthe exclusive method for service of process on a foreign insurance company\r\nis by service on the Director of the Department of Insurance. Pursuant to\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 38-5-70 (2002), every foreign insurer appoints the director\r\nas its agent for service of process. Substituted service upon the director \"is\r\n[the]exclusive [method], and service made in any other way upon such\r\ncorporations is invalid.\" Murray v. Sovereign Camp, W.O.W., 192 S.C. 101,\r\n108, 5 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1939 (construing predecessor to § 38-5-70).\r\nFurther, S.C. Code Ann. §15-9-270 (2005) provides, \"The summons and any\r\nother legal process in any action or proceeding against [an insurance\r\ncompany] must be served on an insurance company . . . by delivering two\r\ncopies . . . to the Director . . .\" Compliance with this statute \"is the proper\r\nand exclusive method of obtaining jurisdiction over the insurance company.\"\r\nEquilease Corp. v. Weathers, 275 S.C. 478, 484, 272 S.E.2d 789, 792 (1980).\r\nAn action is not commenced unless these statutory mandates are met, and all\r\nparties agree they were not complied with here. See also Couch on Insurance\r\n§ 3:30 (3rd ed. 2013 ) (recognizing South Carolina as a jurisdiction where\r\nservice on statutory agent is exclusive). The trial court erred in refusing to\r\nset aside entry of default.\r\nI also agree with the Court of Appeals that the policy underlying these\r\nstatutes is to protect the public by informing the Director of allegations of\r\ninsurer misconduct. See S.C. Code Ann. § 38-3-110(2002). I therefore\r\nconclude it would violate public policy to permit an insurance company to\r\ncontract out of these mandatory substituted service statutes.\r\nWhile it is unfortunate that an insurance company that received actual notice\r\nof the petitioners' suit is taking advantage of these substituted service statutes,\r\nthis result is compelled by our precedents and by the public policy that the\r\nstatutes serve. For the reasons given above, I would affirm the decision of\r\nthe Court of Appeals.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27352","title":"Pittman v.

Pittman v. Pittman, 395\r\nS.C. 209, 717 S.E.2d 88 (Ct. App. 2011). Although we find the court of appeals\r\nerred in affirming the family court's reliance on the parties' premarital conduct in\r\nthe transmutation analysis, we affirm based on the parties' conduct during the\r\nmarriage. We find the evidence preponderates in support of a finding that the\r\nparties intended the land surveying business to be the common property of the\r\nmarriage.                                I.\r\nJetter Pittman (Husband) and Gloria Pittman (Wife) were married in April 2000\r\nand separated in March 2007. It was a second marriage for both, and they have no\r\nchildren together. Wife instituted this divorce action against Husband in May\r\n2007, on the grounds of adultery. In addition, Wife argued to the family court that\r\nHusband's land surveying business, Pittman Professional Land Surveying, Inc.,\r\nwas transmuted into marital property and was thus subject to equitable\r\napportionment.\r\n\r\nHusband and Wife met and began their relationship in 1991. Wife worked as a\r\nregistered nurse in Rock Hill, South Carolina. Husband, a licensed professional\r\nland surveyor, was living and working in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. The\r\nparties' relationship was long-distance at first, but in May 1993, Husband's job was\r\ntransferred to Albemarle, North Carolina, and Husband then moved in with Wife in\r\nher Fort Mill, South Carolina home. From the time the parties began living\r\ntogether and throughout the marriage the parties pooled their funds in a joint\r\nchecking account, and Wife paid all of the parties' personal and household\r\nexpenses from their joint account.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his full-time job, Husband regularly took side jobs as a surveyor.\r\nThroughout the parties' relationship, Wife assisted Husband with his surveying\r\njobs by handling all the billing and accounting tasks and by performing light field\r\nduties on occasion. In 1996, Husband quit his full-time job and became self-\r\nemployed, incorporating his surveying business (Business)1 and initially operating\r\n\r\n1 The Business was incorporated as a statutory close corporation, or \"S-Corp.\"\r\nHusband owned 100% of the shares. However, the Business's income tax returns\r\nlisted Wife as the Secretary and the audit contact for the Business.\r\n\nfrom the upstairs bedroom of Wife's home.2 Both parties had day-to-day\r\nresponsibilities for the Business; Husband managed the surveying jobs and the\r\nemployees, and Wife continued to handle all the financial and bookkeeping tasks\r\nfor the Business, in addition to maintaining her employment as a registered nurse.\r\nAlthough this arrangement began at the inception of the Business—before the\r\nparties were married—it also continued during the marriage and did not cease until\r\napproximately six months after Wife filed for divorce.\r\n\r\nAfter the parties married in 2000, they agreed for Wife to take on an increased role\r\nand participation in the Business and work only part-time at the hospital. As the\r\nBusiness grew, Wife increased her commitment to the Business, often working 35-\r\nhour weeks, while ultimately decreasing her nursing job to one day per week.3\r\nWhen the Business first began, the parties were sometimes unpaid for their work;\r\nhowever, by the time of separation, both Husband and Wife both drew a salary\r\nfrom the Business, with Wife receiving $4,200 per month. From the date of\r\nmarriage to the date of separation, Wife's income steadily increased each year. The\r\nparties agreed to raise Wife's salary to increase her social security income because\r\nWife was older than Husband4—a decision the parties made for their mutual\r\nbenefit so they would have more money during their retirement.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, before the Business was firmly established and producing significant\r\nincome, the parties purchased three surveying geodimeters at a cost of more than\r\n$30,000 each. The record reveals that, at the time of marriage, the parties were\r\nstill servicing debt associated with the geodimeters. Further, in November 2002,\r\nboth Husband and Wife signed an unlimited personal guaranty agreement to secure\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2In 2003, the parties purchased with marital funds a property located at 314 Tom\r\nHall Street in Fort Mill and operated the Business from there.\r\n3 The parties agreed for Wife to continue working at the hospital to maintain health\r\ninsurance coverage for both parties. However, as a result of her decreased work\r\nschedule at the hospital, Wife was unable to participate in the hospital's 401(k)\r\nmatch program. When Wife further reduced her hospital work schedule to one day\r\nper week, she was no longer eligible to receive health insurance benefits. Thus,\r\nbeginning in 2006, both parties obtained health insurance coverage through the\r\nBusiness.\r\n4   Wife is approximately fourteen years older than Husband.\r\n\nthe Business's financial obligations.5\r\n\r\nThe family court granted Wife a divorce on the ground of adultery; ordered\r\nHusband to pay Wife $600 per month in permanent, periodic alimony; identified,\r\nvalued, and equitably apportioned marital property and debts; and awarded wife\r\n$12,500 in attorney's fees. In identifying marital property, the family court found\r\nthe Business was transmuted into marital property and was properly included in the\r\nmarital estate. Specifically, the family court found:\r\n\r\n      The [Wife] and [Husband] both worked in the company, increased its\r\n      value, had a plan for growing and developing the business, jointly\r\n      made decisions as to the business, jobs, loans, and employees. The\r\n      [Wife] signed an unlimited guarantee for the business. The [Husband]\r\n      clearly treated the business as a martial [sic] asset during the entirety\r\n      of the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe family court emphasized that Husband was able to become self-employed in\r\n1996 \"because he was able to fall back on the [Wife's] full-time guaranteed income\r\nand the parties, prior to the marriage, pooled their money and paid all bills jointly.\"\r\n\r\nIn ascertaining the marital estate, the family court found the parties intended the\r\nBusiness to be a joint asset of the marriage. In including the value of the Business\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Husband claims \"the\" loan for which the guarantee was executed was timely\r\nrepaid, so \"the guaranty agreement expired by its own terms.\" However, the\r\ndocument is titled \"Unlimited Guaranty Agreement\" and reads:\r\n\r\n      [T]o induce First Citizens Bank and Trust Company of South Carolina\r\n      . . . at its option, at any time or from time to time to make loans . . . or\r\n      to engage in any other transactions with [the Business], the Guarantor\r\n      hereby absolutely guarantees to the Bank the timely prompt and\r\n      complete payment . . . of any and all indebtedness, obligations and\r\n      liabilities of the [Business] to the Bank, and all claims of the Bank\r\n      against the [Business], now existing or hereafter arising . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). Moreover, the fact that a loan associated with this guaranty was\r\ntimely repaid before the date of filing does not render Wife's act in signing the\r\npersonal guaranty meaningless. As discussed in more detail below, we find the\r\nfact that the parties used Wife's credit to assist the Business during the marriage is\r\nrelevant in determining the parties' intent in the transmutation analysis.\r\n\nin the marital estate,6 the family court rejected Husband's argument that he was\r\nentitled to a special equity in the value of Business as of the date of the marriage.\r\nThe family court weighed the statutory factors and determined a 50/50 division of\r\nthe marital estate was appropriate and equitable. The marital estate was\r\napportioned accordingly.\r\n\r\nHusband filed a motion for reconsideration pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\narguing the family court's finding that the Business was transmuted was\r\nunsupported by any evidence in the record demonstrating Husband's intent to treat\r\nthe Business as a marital asset. The family court rejected Husband's argument,\r\nreiterating that the credible evidence objectively established transmutation.\r\nHusband appealed.\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part. Concerning the\r\ntransmutation issue, the court of appeals found that Wife met her burden of\r\nshowing the parties intended to treat the Business as a marital asset. Following the\r\ndenial of Husband's petition for rehearing, this Court granted Husband's petition\r\nfor a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision regarding the\r\ntransmutation finding.                    II.\r\n\"'In appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find facts\r\nin accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence. However, this\r\nbroad scope of review does not require this Court to disregard the findings of the\r\nfamily court.'\" Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. 381, 384, 709 S.E.2d 650, 651 (2011)\r\n(quoting Eason v. Eason, 384 S.C. 473, 479, 682 S.E.2d 804, 807 (2009)). \"[T]he\r\nappellate court is not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who was\r\nin a superior position to make credibility determinations.\" Id. at 385, 709 S.E.2d at\r\n651–52.                                A. \n\r\n                                  Transmutation \n\r\n\r\nHusband argues the finding of transmutation was error because Wife presented no\r\nevidence that the parties intended the Business to be transmuted into marital\r\nproperty. Husband further claims the family court committed legal error in\r\n\r\n6At trial, Wife contended the Business was worth $575,000. However, the family\r\ncourt found the Business was properly valued at $237,404. The family court's\r\nvaluation of the Business is not challenged on appeal.\r\n\nconsidering the parties' premarital conduct in the transmutation analysis. We agree\r\nwith Husband on this latter point, but we find the record is replete with evidence of\r\nthe parties' conduct during the marriage to support a finding of transmutation.\r\n\r\nThe term \"marital property\" means \"all real and personal property which has been\r\nacquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of\r\nfiling or commencement of the marital litigation . . . regardless of how legal title is\r\nheld.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2013). However, \"[p]roperty\r\nacquired prior to the marriage is generally considered nonmarital.\" Pirri v. Pirri,\r\n369 S.C. 258, 269, 631 S.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2006) (citing S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 20-7-473(2) (Supp. 2004)). Nevertheless, \"[p]roperty that is nonmarital when\r\nacquired may be transmuted into marital property if it becomes so commingled\r\nwith marital property that it is no longer traceable, is titled jointly, or is used by the\r\nparties in support of the marriage or in some other way that establishes the parties'\r\nintent to make it marital property.\" Wilburn v. Wilburn, 403 S.C. 372, 384, 743\r\nS.E.2d 734, 740 (2013) (citing Trimnal v. Trimnal, 287 S.C. 495, 497–98, 339\r\nS.E.2d 869, 871 (1986)).\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, transmutation is a matter of intent to be gleaned from the facts\r\nof each case.\" Johnson v. Johnson, 296 S.C. 289, 295, 372 S.E.2d 107, 110 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1988). \"The spouse claiming transmutation must produce objective evidence\r\nshowing that, during the marriage, the parties themselves regarded the property as\r\nthe common property of the marriage.\" Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 98, 545\r\nS.E.2d 531, 537 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Pool v. Pool, 321 S.C. 84, 86, 467 S.E.2d\r\n753, 756 (Ct. App. 1996)).\r\n\r\nIn terms of evidence tending to establish transmutation, \"the use of property in\r\nsupport of a marriage is relevant to transmutation[; however] the mere use of\r\nincome from nonmarital assets does not transmute those assets into marital\r\nproperty.\" Wilburn, 403 S.C. at 385, 743 S.E.2d at 741 (citing Peterkin v.\r\nPeterkin, 293 S.C. 311, 313, 360 S.E.2d 311, 313 (1987)).7 Husband seeks to\r\n\r\n7See also Smallwood v. Smallwood, 392 S.C. 574, 579–81, 709 S.E.2d 543, 546\r\n(Ct. App. 2011) (finding rental properties purchased by husband before marriage\r\nwere not transmuted because all mortgages were paid with rental income, not\r\nmarital funds, and wife provided only temporary and insubstantial assistance to\r\nhusband in managing the rental properties); Pirri v. Pirri, 369 S.C. 258, 269, 631\r\nS.E.2d 279, 285 (Ct. App. 2006) (finding rental properties purchased by husband\r\nbefore common law marriage were not transmuted because wife did not assist in\r\nmanaging the property during the marriage and had no control over the rental\r\n\ncharacterize this case as nothing more than the mere use of income from the\r\nBusiness to support the marriage. Contrary to Husband's characterization and\r\nassertions, Wife has presented evidence objectively establishing an intent by both\r\nparties to treat the Business as the common property of the marriage.\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals stated:\r\n\r\n      Wife was listed as secretary for the corporation. After the parties\r\n      married in 2000, Wife, with Husband's consent, reduced the hours she\r\n      worked at her nursing job to work full-time in the business and thus\r\n      contributed less to her 401K and retirement accounts. Most\r\n      significantly, Husband and Wife agreed that the business would pay\r\n      Wife a higher salary for her services than what her services warranted\r\n      with the expectation that this business decision would benefit both\r\n      parties during their retirement together. Under these circumstances,\r\n      we decline to disturb the finding that [the Business] had been\r\n      transmuted.\r\n\r\nPittman, 395 S.C. at 222–23, 717 S.E.2d at 95 (citing Lewis v. Lewis, 392 S.C. at\r\n392, 709 S.E.2d at 655).\r\n\r\nThe court of appeals' opinion is correct but the record contains further evidence in\r\nsupport of the transmutation finding. Wife's credible testimony establishes that the\r\nparties treated the Business as their business—not just Husband's business. Wife\r\ntestified that all of the business decisions were made jointly and stated, \"I can't\r\nreally think of anytime that anything important happened or somebody was hired\r\nthat we didn't discuss it together.\" We find Wife's testimony credible in every\r\nmaterial respect. Moreover, Husband admitted that he and Wife worked together\r\nin the Business during the marriage.8 The credible evidence is that Husband\r\nperformed the field work and Wife handled all other aspects of the business,\r\n\r\n\r\nincome, which was not consistently placed in the parties' joint bank account).\r\n8 By the time of the separation, the Business had become so profitable that \"money\r\nreally wasn't that much of an object\" and the parties used Business revenue to\r\ndirectly pay personal, marital expenses. For example, the parties used Business\r\nrevenue to pay for many items, including alcohol, groceries, vacations, a laptop\r\ncomputer, Carolina Panthers PSL tickets, and over $25,000 in repairs to an antique\r\nvehicle. We, of course, recognize that the use of nonmarital funds in support of the\r\nmarriage, by itself, is not sufficient to establish transmutation.\r\n\nincluding running the office, scheduling jobs, handling payables and receivables,\r\nand maintaining the books.\r\n\r\nWife's role and authority in the Business was pervasive and ubiquitous,\r\nnotwithstanding Husband's post-separation protestations to the contrary. We\r\nacknowledge that Husband never expressly declared the Business to be a marital\r\nasset, a fact on which Husband heavily relies. Yet, where the transmutation\r\nquestion is litigated, one does not expect to find an admission. A family court\r\njudge, unlike any other judge, is accustomed to resolving emotionally-charged and\r\nintensely personal issues. A family court judge understands well that the\r\nemotionally-charged issues encountered daily are not limited to matters concerning\r\nchildren. Day in and day out, the demanding and taxing service on the family\r\ncourt bench requires the judge to carefully consider the competing evidence and\r\nmake credibility determinations and findings of fact.\r\n\r\nHere, Husband is adamant that he never intended the Business to become the\r\ncommon property of the marriage, and as noted, transmutation is ultimately a\r\nmatter of discerning the parties' intent. We note that the record is scant concerning\r\nHusband's testimony on the transmutation issue, for portions of his testimony were\r\nomitted from the record on appeal. It appears the omitted testimony related to the\r\ntransmutation question. What we are left with is Husband's conclusory claim that\r\nhe never intended the Business to become a marital asset. The record before this\r\nCourt preponderates otherwise and leads us to agree with the able family court\r\njudge that the conduct of the parties during the marriage objectively demonstrates a\r\nmutual intent to regard the Business as a marital asset.\r\n\r\nTo be clear, the family court committed an error of law in relying on Wife's\r\npremarital contributions to the Business in support of its transmutation finding.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 20-3-630(A) (Supp. 2013) (defining the term \"marital property\"\r\nas \"all real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the\r\nmarriage\" (emphasis added)); see also Pirri, 369 S.C. at 270, 631 S.E.2d at 286\r\n(noting that any transmutation must have occurred, if at all, after the date of the\r\ncommon law marriage). However, the record reveals ample evidence to support a\r\nfinding that the parties' actions during the marriage manifested intent for the\r\nBusiness to be transmuted. We find both parties' significant day-to-day\r\ninvolvement in the business—including the parties' decision for Wife to all but\r\nforfeit her nursing career, coupled with Wife's credible testimony that all major\r\nbusiness decisions were made jointly, including the parties' decision to structure\r\nWife's pay to benefit both parties at the time and upon Wife's retirement—\r\ndemonstrates the parties' intent to treat the Business as a marital asset. See\r\n\nEdwards v. Edwards, 384 S.C. 179, 185, 682 S.E.2d 37, 40 (Ct. App. 2009)\r\n(finding transmutation of Husband's life estate in a produce stand where facts\r\nestablished the following: profits from the produce stand provided the parties with\r\ntheir main source of income, marital funds were used to build equity in the produce\r\nstand, Wife participated in the daily operations of the produce stand, and both\r\nparties' names were listed on the building permit for the produce stand); Simpson v.\r\nSimpson, 377 S.C. 527, 538, 660 S.E.2d 278, 284 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding land\r\nupon which marital home was built was transmuted where the parties used it in\r\nsupport of the marriage, cleared the land together, and built the marital residence\r\ntogether with marital funds); Jenkins, 245 S.C. at 98–100, 545 S.E.2d at 537\r\n(finding acreage and rental home Husband inherited were transmuted into marital\r\nproperty where the parties strategically made the property part of their joint\r\nretirement plan, Wife was substantially involved in the general care and\r\nmaintenance of the property, and the parties expended marital funds on improving\r\nthe property); cf. Odom v. Odom, 141 P.3d 324, 333 (Alaska 2006) (finding\r\nHusband's separate business was not transmuted into marital property because\r\nWife played no role in the day-to-day operation or management of the business,\r\nWife's name was not on any bank accounts and her credit was never used for any\r\nbank loans, and she never owned any stock).\r\n\r\nAdditionally, marital funds were expended in discharging the indebtedness of the\r\ngeodimeters, and Wife's personal credit was used in support of the Business. We\r\nfind this fact is further evidence of intent to transmute, beyond the mere use of the\r\nBusiness in support of the marriage. Frank v. Frank, 311 S.C. 454, 456–57, 429\r\nS.E.2d 823, 825 (Ct. App. 1993) (finding premarital home belonging to Wife was\r\ntransmuted where Husband personally guaranteed the note secured by a mortgage\r\non the property); see Canaday v. Canaday, 296 S.C. 521, 374 S.E.2d 502 (Ct. App.\r\n1988) (finding use of property in support of the marriage and joint discharge of\r\nindebtedness evidenced intent for property to be transmuted); Wyatt v. Wyatt, 293\r\nS.C. 495, 497, 361 S.E.2d 777, 779 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding joint efforts to\r\ndischarge indebtedness may transmute previously acquired property into marital\r\nproperty).\r\n\r\nIn sum, while the court of appeals erred in affirming the family court's reliance on\r\npremarital conduct to support the transmutation finding, we find ample evidence of\r\nthe parties' conduct during the marriage to warrant a finding of transmutation\r\nconcerning the Business.                 B.\r\n\n                                   Special Equity\r\nAlternatively, Husband presents two arguments. First, Husband argues that even if\r\nthe Business was properly transmuted, he is entitled to receive a special equity for\r\nthe value of the Business as of the date of marriage. We disagree.\r\n\r\nHusband's argument is inconsistent with the law of this state. \"When property is\r\ndetermined to have been transmuted, the entire property, not just a portion of the\r\nproperty, is included in the parties' marital property which is thereafter apportioned\r\nby the family court using the criteria set forth in [the equitable apportionment\r\nstatute.]\" Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 106, 529 S.E.2d 14, 20 (2000). The\r\nproper way to account for such a direct financial contribution is in the overall\r\ndivision of the marital estate. More to the point, such a direct financial\r\ncontribution should be taken into account in determining the percentage division of\r\nthe marital estate. See Dawkins v. Dawkins, 386 S.C. 169, 687 S.E.2d 52 (2010)\r\n(stating \"[w]e approve of the approach announced in Toler . . . as the sole method\r\nin accounting for a spouse's special equity in marital property\"), abrogated on\r\nother grounds by Lewis, 392 S.C. at 384, 709 S.E.2d at 65; Toler v. Toler, 292 S.C.\r\n374, 380 n.1, 356 S.E.2d 429, 432 n.1 (Ct. App. 1987) (finding error where the\r\nfamily court separated and subtracted the asset's nonmarital value from the marital\r\nestate and awarding that \"special equity\" to the inheritor in addition to his or her\r\nportion of the marital estate and stating \"[t]he correct way to treat the [nonmarital\r\nproperty] is as a contribution by the [inheritor] to the acquisition of marital\r\nproperty. This contribution should be taken into account in determining the\r\npercentage of the marital estate to which the [inheritor] is equitably entitled upon\r\ndistribution.\"). Indeed, once the Business was determined to have been\r\ntransmuted, the full value of the Business was appropriately included in the marital\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nSecond, in recognition of the law rejecting a special equity under these\r\ncircumstances, Husband asserts he was entitled to a credit for the premarital value\r\nof the Business. We agree with Husband in the abstract, but we are unable to\r\nconclude that the family court erred. At the Rule 59(e), SCRCP hearing when this\r\nargument was presented, the family court noted the parties stipulated to a \"50/50\r\ndivision.\" Although there is disagreement as to whether the parties stipulated to an\r\nequal division, we have carefully reviewed the parties' respective contributions to\r\nthe acquisition of the marital estate and find the equitable apportionment ordered\r\nby the family court to be reasonable. See Wilburn, 403 S.C. at 390, 743 S.E.2d at\r\n744 (\"On appeal, we must review the fairness of the overall apportionment, and if\r\nequitable, we will uphold it regardless of whether we would have weighed specific\r\n\nfactors differently.\" (citing Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 389, 597 S.E.2d\r\n840, 842 (Ct.App.2004))); Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 25–26, 550 S.E.2d\r\n580, 583 (Ct. App. 2001) (\"On review, this Court looks to the overall fairness of\r\nthe apportionment, and if the end result is equitable, that this Court might have\r\nweighed specific factors differently than the family court is irrelevant.\" (citing\r\nJohnson, 296 S.C. at 300, 372 S.E.2d at 113)).\r\n\r\n\r\n                                        III.\r\nWe affirm as modified. The family court erred in considering the parties'\r\npremarital conduct in the transmutation analysis, but we find the evidence during\r\nthe marriage establishes that the Business was transmuted into marital property.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27353","title":"State v.

Giles was convicted of first-\r\ndegree burglary, strong arm robbery, and kidnapping. He was sentenced to thirty\r\nyears', thirty years', and fifteen years' imprisonment, respectively, to be served\r\n\nconcurrently. On certiorari, he challenges the Court of Appeals' affirmation of his\r\nconvictions and sentences on the basis that the trial court improperly sustained the\r\nsolicitor's Batson motion. State v. Giles, Op. No. 2010-UP-154 (S.C. Ct. App.\r\nfiled Feb. 23, 2010). We affirm.        FACTS\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted on charges of burglary in the first degree, strong-arm\r\nrobbery, and kidnaping. He represented himself at trial, with the assistance of\r\nstandby counsel.\r\n\r\nDuring jury selection, petitioner used his peremptory challenges to strike eight\r\nwhite males and two white females from the jury venire. The State requested,\r\npursuant to Batson v. Kentucky,1 that the trial judge conduct an inquiry as to\r\nwhether petitioner had a race neutral reason for striking the ten white jurors. When\r\nasked if there was a race neutral reason for the strikes, standby counsel explained\r\npetitioner did not feel the jurors were right for the jury. At that point, the trial\r\njudge asked the State to respond. The State maintained the reason given was not\r\nracially neutral, but \"highly race based.\" The trial judge agreed, noting that while\r\non its face the reason given by petitioner for the strikes was obviously race neutral,\r\nit gave the judge nothing by which to determine if the reason was pretextual. The\r\njudge stated a defendant must provide some racially neutral reason other than\r\nsimply stating the stricken venirepersons were not right for the jury. The judge\r\nfound that if such a reason were sufficient, the parties would be given \"unfettered\r\nstrikes . . . for no reason other than that they don't want to put them on the jury.\"\r\nThe judge concluded that while the reason given by petitioner for the strikes was\r\nracially neutral on its face, it was not a sufficient reason under Batson.\r\nAccordingly, the trial judge granted the State's motion to quash the jury panel.\r\n\r\nFollowing the selection of a new jury panel, the trial judge further expounded on\r\nhis ruling, reiterating that striking a juror because the juror is not right for the jury\r\nis no reason. He again noted that while it may be \"technically, semantically,\r\nintellectually racially neutral,\" for purposes of articulating a reason for striking a\r\njuror, it was not race neutral. Referring to the Batson process, the judge found the\r\nreason given by petitioner for striking the jurors was not sufficient to move the\r\nprocess to the third step, where the burden would be on the State to show the\r\nreason given was mere pretext. The trial judge found that if the process proceeded\r\n\r\n1   476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n\nto the third step, it would be impossible for the State to prove petitioner did not\r\nstrike another venireperson from the jury venire on the basis the venireperson was\r\nnot right for the jury. The trial judge repeated his initial holding that petitioner was\r\nrequired to give some reason for the strikes and petitioner's belief that the stricken\r\nvenirepersons were not right for the jury was no reason.\r\n\r\nThe issue before the Court of Appeals and now before this Court is whether the\r\ntrial judge erred in failing to follow the three-step process outlined in Batson for\r\ndetermining whether a peremptory challenge was based on race. Specifically,\r\npetitioner contends that because the trial judge found petitioner's reason for striking\r\nthe venirepersons was race neutral, he should have proceeded to step three of the\r\nBatson process and required the solicitor to prove the reason given was mere\r\npretext and that petitioner engaged in purposeful discrimination in exercising his\r\nperemptory challenges. We disagree.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nIn Batson, the United States Supreme Court outlined a three-step process for\r\nevaluating claims that peremptory challenges have been exercised in a manner\r\nviolative of the Equal Protection Clause. First, the opponent of the peremptory\r\nchallenge must make a prima facie showing that the challenge was based on race.\r\n476 U.S. at 97. If a sufficient showing is made, the trial court will move to the\r\nsecond step in the process, which requires the proponent of the challenge to\r\nprovide a race neutral explanation for the challenge. Id. If the trial court finds that\r\nburden has been met, the process will proceed to the third step, at which point the\r\ntrial court must determine whether the opponent of the challenge has proved\r\npurposeful discrimination. 476 U.S. at 98. The ultimate burden always rests with\r\nthe opponent of the challenge to prove purposeful discrimination.\r\n\r\nIn addressing the second step of the process, the United States Supreme Court held\r\nthat general assertions, such as a mere denial of discriminatory motive or assurance\r\nthe challenges were exercised in good faith, are not sufficient to rebut a prima facie\r\nshowing of a race based challenge. 476 U.S. at 97-98. The Court noted that if\r\nsuch general assertions were sufficient, \"the Equal Protection Clause 'would be but\r\na vain and illusory requirement.'\" 476 U.S. at 98 (quoting Norris v. Alabama, 294\r\nU.S. 587, 598 (1935)). Accordingly, the Court, while not requiring the explanation\r\nto rise to the level of justifying the exercise of a challenge for cause, held the\r\nproponent of the strike must give a clear and reasonably specific explanation of\r\nlegitimate reasons for exercising the challenge. 476 U.S. at 98 n.20.\r\n\nApproximately nine years later, the United States Supreme Court further\r\nelaborated on the explanation required at the second step of the Batson process.\r\nPurkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765 (1995). In Purkett, the Court clarified that the issue\r\nat that step is the facial validity of the explanation provided by the proponent of the\r\nstrike, and the explanation need not be persuasive or even plausible. 514 U.S. at\r\n768. The Court went so far as to state the reason does not have to make sense, and\r\neven a silly or superstitious reason may suffice because it is not until the third step\r\nof the Batson process that the persuasiveness of the explanation becomes relevant.\r\nId. The Court noted that it is at that stage that the trial court determines whether\r\nthe opponent of the strike has met the burden of proving purposeful discrimination\r\nand will probably find implausible or fantastic justifications to be pretexts for\r\ndiscriminatory intent. Id.\r\n\r\nThe Court found that the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit erred by\r\ncombining Batson's second and third steps into one, requiring that the justification\r\ntendered at the second step be not just neutral but also at least minimally\r\npersuasive.2 The Court held that it is not until the third step of the Batson process,\r\nat which the trial court determines whether the opponent of the strike has carried\r\nthe burden of proving purposeful discrimination, that the persuasiveness of the\r\njustification becomes relevant.\r\n\r\nThe Court surmised that the Eighth Circuit seized on the admonition in Batson that\r\nin order to rebut a prima facia case of a racially discriminatory challenge, a clear\r\nand specific explanation must be given of legitimate reasons for exercising the\r\nchallenge. However, the Court explained that warning was meant to refute the\r\nnotion that a proponent of a strike could satisfy the burden of providing a race\r\nneutral explanation for the strike by merely denying a discriminatory motive or by\r\nasserting it was made in good faith.3 514 U.S. at 769. The Court further explained\r\n\r\n2 The Eighth Circuit found that \"where the prosecution strikes a prospective juror who is a\r\nmember of the defendant's racial group, solely on the basis of factors which are facially\r\nirrelevant to the question of whether that person is qualified to serve as a juror in the particular\r\ncase, the prosecution must at least articulate some plausible race-neutral reason for believing\r\nthose factors will somehow affect the person's ability to perform his or her duties as a juror.\" 25\r\nF.3d 679, 683 (1994).\r\n3 In State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996), this Court adopted the \"standard\"\r\ndelineated in Purkett, noting that pursuant to that standard, the proponent of the peremptory\r\nchallenges \"will not have any burden of presenting reasonably specific, legitimate explanations\r\nfor the strikes,\" but instead need only present a racially neutral explanation.\r\n\nthat while in order to be legitimate, the reason need not make sense, it must be\r\nlegally sufficient such that it does not deny equal protection. Id.\r\n\r\nA more recent decision of the United States Supreme Court on the Batson front\r\nindicates the Court did not, in Purkett, abandon the requirement set forth in Batson\r\nthat at the second stage of the Batson process a proponent of a strike \"give a clear\r\nand reasonably specific explanation of his legitimate reasons for exercising the\r\nchallenge.\" Miller-El v. Dretke, 545 U.S. 231 (2005).\r\n\r\nIndeed, courts in other jurisdictions have found Batson error at the second step of\r\nthe analysis, post-Purkett, on the ground that the explanation given was not\r\nsufficiently clear and specific to provide a factual basis that courts can review for\r\nlegitimacy. Moeller v. Blanc, 276 S.W.3d 656 (Tex. App. 2008). See e.g.,\r\nRobinson v. U.S., 878 A.2d 1273 (D.C. 2005)(finding prosecutor's statement that\r\nhe \"just didn't like\" the stricken venireperson did not furnish the clear and\r\nreasonably specific explanation of his legitimate reasons for striking that juror that\r\nwas required); People v. Carillo, 780 N.Y.S.2d 143 (N.Y. App. Div. 2004)(finding\r\nprosecutor's explanation that his peremptory challenge of a prospective juror was\r\nnot based on anything in particular, he \"just did not get a good feel from her,\"\r\n\"amounted to, in essence, no explanation at all\"); Zakour v. UT Med. Grp., Inc.,\r\n215 S.W.3d 763 (Tenn. 2007)(finding explanation that six prospective female\r\njurors were stricken because of their body language, without providing more detail,\r\nwas not clear, reasonably specific, legitimate and reasonably related to the\r\nparticular case being tried).\r\n\r\nAddressing \"gut feeling\" explanations, the Louisiana Supreme Court found that\r\nsuch an explanation, standing alone, does not constitute a race neutral explanation\r\nbecause it is ambiguous and \"falls far short of an articulable reason that enables the\r\ntrial judge to assess the plausibility of the proffered reason for striking a potential\r\njuror. Whatever is causing the 'gut feeling' should be explained for proper\r\nevaluation of the proffered reason.\" Alex v. Rayne Concrete Svc., 951 So.2d 138,\r\n153 (La. 2007). The Louisiana Supreme Court held the neutral explanation must\r\nbe clear, reasonably specific and legitimate in order for the opponent of the strike\r\nto have a full and fair opportunity to demonstrate pretext in the reason given for the\r\nperemptory strike. Id. The court further held a clear, reasonably specific and\r\nlegitimate reason is necessary for the trial court to fulfill its duty to assess the\r\nplausibility of the proffered reason for striking the potential juror in light of all the\r\nevidence with a bearing on it; therefore, it is essential that the proponent of the\r\nperemptory strike fully articulate the reason so that a proper assessment can be\r\n\nmade. Id. The court observed that \"'[r]ubber stamp' approval of any non-racial\r\nexplanation, no matter how whimsical or fanciful, would destroy [Batson]'s\r\nobjective to ensure that no citizen is disqualified from jury service because of his\r\nrace. 'If trial courts were required to find any reason given not based on race\r\nsatisfactory, only those who admitted point-blank that they excluded veniremen\r\nbecause of their race would be found in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's\r\nguarantee of equal protection.'\" 951 So.2d at 154 (quoting State v. Collier, 553\r\nSo.2d 815 (La. 1989)).\r\n\r\nWe likewise find, based on a harmonization of Batson, Purkett and Miller-El, that\r\nin order for the explanation provided by the proponent of a peremptory challenge\r\nat the second stage of the Batson process to be legally sufficient and not deny the\r\nopponent of the challenge, as well as the trial court, the ability to safeguard the\r\nright to equal protection, it need not be persuasive, or even plausible, but it must be\r\nclear and reasonably specific such that the opponent of the challenge has a full and\r\nfair opportunity to demonstrate pretext in the reason given and the trial court to\r\nfulfill its duty to assess the plausibility of the reason in light of all the evidence\r\nwith a bearing on it. Reasonable specificity is necessary because comparison to\r\nother members of the venire for purposes of a disparate treatment analysis, which\r\nis often used at the third step of the Batson process to determine if purposeful\r\ndiscrimination has occurred, is impossible if the proponent of the challenge\r\nprovides only a vague or very general explanation. The explanation given may in\r\nfact be implausible or fantastic, as noted in Purkett, but it may not be so general or\r\nvague that it deprives the opponent of the challenge of the ability to meet the\r\nburden to show, or the trial court of the ability to determine whether, the reason\r\ngiven is pretextual. The proponent of the challenge must provide an objectively\r\ndiscernible basis for the challenge that permits the opponent of the challenge and\r\nthe trial court to evaluate it. The trial judge need not proceed to step three of the\r\nBatson process when no constitutionally permissible reason has been proffered at\r\nstep two.4\r\n\r\nTurning now to the facts of this case, it is difficult to determine whether the trial\r\ncourt proceeded to the third step of the Batson process. While the trial court asked\r\nthe State to respond to the explanation given by petitioner for the strikes, which\r\nwould indicate the court was proceeding to the third step of the process, the ruling\r\nof the trial court, both initially and when clarified after the selection of the new\r\n\r\n4To the extent we held in Adams, supra, that the proponent of a peremptory challenge has no\r\nburden of presenting a reasonably specific and legitimate explanation for the challenge at the\r\nsecond step of the Batson process, that decision is overruled.\r\n\njury panel, indicates the trial court ultimately concluded petitioner's explanation for\r\nthe strikes was not sufficient to move to the third step of the process. For instance,\r\nthe trial court stated the reason given by petitioner, while race neutral, gave the\r\ncourt \"nothing on which to determine whether or not it was [pretextual]\" and was\r\n\"not a sufficient reason to allow the strikes to stand against a Batson motion.\" The\r\ntrial court, noting the explanation must be clear and reasonably specific, found \"if\r\nthat can be satisfied by simply saying the jury wasn't right . . . Batson would have\r\nno meaning whatsoever.\" Following selection of the new jury panel, the trial court\r\nelaborated, stating, \"The explanation of a strike[,] which is step two was where we\r\nwere and I found that the explanation was not right for the jury. . . [while it may\r\nhave been] technically, semantically, intellectually racially neutral[,] . . .it does not\r\nsuffice to switch it to stage three because there the burden would be on the [S]tate\r\nto show that that was a mere pretext and that would be an impossibility. . . . That is\r\nif the defense or one side or the other argues that someone is quote not right for the\r\njury it would be impossible for the other side to say that they did not strike\r\nsomeone else who was quote not right for the jury.\" The trial court acknowledged\r\nthis Court's adoption of Purkett in Adams, but stated, \"I still think there must be\r\nsome reason and I think that someone is not right for the jury is no reason.\"\r\n\r\nWe find the trial court's conclusion was correct. The explanation given by\r\npetitioner was, as the trial court correctly found, \"technically, semantically and\r\nintellectually racially neutral,\" but was not race neutral for Batson purposes. The\r\nexplanation offered by petitioner fell far short of an articulable reason that would\r\nenable the trial court, in the third step of the Batson process, to assess the\r\nplausibility of the proffered reason for striking the potential jurors. Instead of\r\nbeing clear and reasonably specific, the reason given by petitioner was very\r\ngeneral and based entirely on his overall subjective dissatisfaction with the\r\nvenirepersons. As such, in the Batson context, petitioner provided no reason at all.\r\nBatson (a clear and reasonably specific explanation of legitimate reasons for\r\nexercising the challenge must be provided at step two of the process). The trial\r\ncourt therefore properly concluded that petitioner failed to meet the requirements\r\nfor moving the Batson inquiry to the third step and that the State's Batson motion\r\nshould be granted.\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27354","title":"State v.

We find the admission of the\r\n\nredacted confession violated the Confrontation Clause because the jury could infer\r\nfrom the face of the confession that it referred to and incriminated Henson.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       Maurice Jackson, Tyrone King, and Kenny Cunningham were sitting on the\r\nfront porch of Jackson's home one evening in Rock Hill, South Carolina. A\r\nwoman and a man wearing a mask walked into the yard and towards the porch.\r\nThe man stopped and the woman walked up the stairs and onto the porch. As the\r\nman removed a firearm from his clothing, the woman announced it was a robbery\r\nand demanded Jackson, King, and Cunningham's possessions. After she collected\r\ntheir possessions, the perpetrators began to walk away. Suddenly, the man turned\r\nand began firing his weapon at the victims. The two then fled. Cunningham was\r\nstruck in the leg and foot. King was hit in the head and later died from the wound.\r\n\r\n       Investigating the crime, the police focused on Donta Reid. They brought\r\nhim in for questioning and over the course of the investigation he gave four\r\nconfessions to the police. In the confession at issue here—the fourth—Reid\r\nimplicated himself, Henson (nicknamed B'More), Samanatha Ervin (nicknamed\r\nSam), and Aileen Newman (nicknamed LeLe) as the perpetrators, and stated\r\nHenson was the shooter.1 His statement detailed the crimes from when the four\r\nfirst began discussing committing a robbery to their flight and Reid's first\r\nencounter with the police.\r\n\r\n       Henson, Reid, Ervin, and Newman were all arrested and charged with\r\nmurder, assault and battery with intent to kill (ABWIK), criminal conspiracy,\r\narmed robbery, and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\ncrime. Ervin and Newman pled guilty, and Henson and Reid proceeded to a joint\r\ntrial.At the outset, Henson moved for a severance. In support, he argued he and\r\nReid would present antagonistic defenses and the State would presumably offer\r\nReid's fourth confession as evidence. He asserted Reid would likely not testify\r\npursuant to the Fifth Amendment and thus, he would not be able to cross-examine\r\n\r\n1 In the first and second statements Reid implicated himself and Darius Jeter—also\r\nknown as \"Duke\"—in the crimes and stated Jeter was the shooter. In the third\r\nstatement Reid continued to implicate himself and Jeter, added Ervin as an\r\nadditional conspirator, and continued to assert Jeter was the shooter. The fourth\r\nstatement made clear that Jeter was not involved.\r\n\nReid about the confession. Therefore, he contended the admission of Reid's fourth\r\nconfession would violate his Confrontation Clause rights.\r\n\r\n       The State opposed the motion on the grounds of judicial economy and lack\r\nof prejudice and offered a redacted version of Reid's confession as a solution to the\r\nConfrontation Clause problem. In the redacted statement, Henson's name was\r\nreplaced with \"the guy,\" \"he,\" and \"him,\" and a statement about picking Henson\r\nout of a photo lineup was removed entirely. The circuit court ruled the redacted\r\nstatement did not incriminate Henson on its face and therefore, its admission would\r\nnot violate the Confrontation Clause. Finding the confession to be the sole basis\r\nfor the motion to sever, the court also denied that motion.\r\n\r\n        At trial, the two surviving victims testified that on the night of the crimes\r\nReid came to Jackson's home and borrowed his phone to make a call during which\r\nReid was heard to say there were \"two of them.\" Approximately fifteen to thirty\r\nminutes later, a man and woman walked into the yard and robbed them. As the\r\ntwo began to walk away from the home, the woman said to the man that the\r\nvictims had seen her face and that he needed to go back and shoot them. The man\r\nthen turned around and opened fire on the victims, after which he and the woman\r\nfled. The victims were generally unable to identify the perpetrators beyond\r\ndescribing them as an African-American male with dreadlocks and an African-\r\nAmerican female both appearing to be in their twenties. However, Jackson\r\ntestified that the man spoke with a Baltimore accent.\r\n\r\n       Ervin and Newman also testified at the trial and detailed Reid's, Henson's,\r\nand their own participation in the crimes. Both identified Henson as the shooter\r\nand testified that he was from Baltimore. They also both testified they entered into\r\na plea deal with the State whereby they agreed to testify in exchange for the State\r\ndismissing several charges and recommending a sentencing range.\r\n\r\n        In addition to the victims and coconspirators, several other witnesses\r\ntestified. A man riding his bike on Jackson's street on the night of the crimes\r\ntestified he witnessed the crimes, but he was not able to identify the perpetrators\r\nother than that they were a man and a woman. An individual who knew the four\r\nconspirators and was in the area that night testified that he was near Jackson's\r\nhome when a truck stopped with Ervin driving and Reid in the bed of the truck.\r\nHe spoke to Ervin and Reid, but was unable to see whether there were any other\r\noccupants of the truck. Finally, two individuals who were with the four\r\nconspirators at a home on the night of the crimes testified that the four left at one\r\npoint and were gone for approximately forty-five minutes to an hour.\r\n\n      Finally, several police officers testified as to their investigation of the crime,\r\namong them Detective Leslie Herring who took Reid's fourth confession. Over\r\nHenson's objection, Herring was permitted to read the redacted version of Reid's\r\nfourth confession to the jury and it was entered into evidence. The redacted\r\nconfession reads:\r\n\r\n         I have earlier made statements to the police officers about what\r\n         happened the night that Tyrone King, who I call Banks was shot. I\r\n         told parts of the truth because I had been threatened by the guy that\r\n         done the shooting. The night this happened it was me, the guy that\r\n         did the shooting and LeLe over at Samantha's house on Keels Ave.\r\n         Sam and the guy left and when they got back, the guy had a rifle and\r\n         he was loading it up. The rifle was black and brown in color and was\r\n         about 3 feet long. It had white tape around the butt of the gun. I\r\n         assumed that Sam and the guy had went and got the gun because he\r\n         didn't have it before they left and they said they were going to go get\r\n         something. It was already dark and we were all standing around\r\n         outside and Sam told him to take the gun in the house and he did. He\r\n         took it to Sam's room. We all went up there too and I wanted to be\r\n         noisy and see what gun looked like. [sic] The guy was holding the\r\n         gun and he said he was wanting to let it rip. He said that it was\r\n         automatic. He asked me if I wanted to walk with him because he had\r\n         said something about robbing somebody. I didn't want to go because I\r\n         didn't know where he was going to put the gun. He said that he was\r\n         going to put it in his pants. I told him I didn't want to go. He asked\r\n         Sam if she wanted to go somewhere. She asked him where and he\r\n         said anywhere that he could make a lick.[2] Me, Sam, LeLe and the\r\n         guy got into Sam's grandfather's truck, a small truck. I got in the bed\r\n         and LeLe and the guy got in the cab with Sam and Sam drove. As we\r\n         were leaving I saw Duke, who is Darius Jeter, walking near Sam's\r\n         house. He tried to flag us down but we kept on going. We rode\r\n         around a little bit and went to Sam's mother's house. I asked Sam to\r\n         take me home so I could use the bathroom. I called Maurice on Sam's\r\n         phone on the way to my house. I was going to smoke with him and\r\n         when I asked if he wanted to, he said yes. I told Maurice I would call\r\n         him when I got home. Sam asked me if Maurice had any money or\r\n         did he sell weed. I told her that he did sell weed and he might have\r\n         some money. Sam asked me if I would set Maurice up. I told her that\r\n\r\n2   The evidence at trial established that \"a lick\" is slang for \"a robbery.\"\r\n\nI really don't want to, but I can. When we got to my house, Sam told\r\nme to call Maurice when I got inside and find out who all was with\r\nhim at his house and then to call her back. I went to the bathroom and\r\nI tried to call Maurice from my house phone, but he wouldn't pick up\r\nhis cell phone, so I walked to his house. He only lived a couple of\r\nhouses from me on Byers St. When I got there Maurice was there\r\nalong with Tryone King and Kenny. I asked Maurice to use his cell\r\nphone to call Sam to let her know that there was two other people with\r\nMaurice. I then asked Maurice to walk with me to Midtown, but he\r\nwouldn't. While I was on the porch with Maurice, Sam drove by 3-4\r\ntimes and Maurice said why does this truck keep coming by. I walked\r\noff the porch and when I got to the end of Byers St. I made a left on\r\nMaple St. and Sam was driving down Byers St. and when she saw me\r\nshe made a left turn on Maple St. too. The guy and LeLe then got out\r\nafter Sam stopped. I told LeLe that there was 3 people since Maurice\r\nwouldn't walk with me. The guy then said \"fuck it, I might as well\r\nrun up on the porch and robbed [sic] all three of them.\" Sam had\r\ndrove over to Reynolds St. and parked on the dirt road to the left after\r\nthe bridge. The guy asked me which house they were at and what did\r\nit look like. I told him that they were all on the porch. The guy had\r\nthe rifle and him and LeLe walked towards Maurice's house. I walked\r\nto where Sam was parked. I knew where she was going to be because\r\nshe told us where she was going to park. I got in the truck with Sam\r\nand we sat there for maybe 5 minutes and then heard a bunch of shots.\r\nSam pulled off and picked up that guy and LeLe at the bridge. The\r\nguy got inside the truck with me and Sam and LeLe got in the bed.\r\nWe all went back to Sam's house. We started talking about the\r\nsituation and LeLe said that she was the one that asked the guys for\r\nweed. The guy started saying he didn't want anyone to snitch on him\r\nand that if anybody did snitch he would come back and get them. I\r\ngot a call on Sam's house phone from my step-dad telling me that\r\nTyrone and Kenny had been shot. That guy and LeLe left in the truck\r\nand LeLe drove. I believe that he took the rifle with him and LeLe\r\ncame back a little while later by herself. I stayed all night at Sam's\r\nand when I woke up Sam had gotten a text message saying that\r\nTyrone had died. My step-dad called again and told me that the police\r\nhad been by the house and wanted to talk with me. I walked home\r\nand called the number the officer had left.\r\n\r\nReid and Henson neither testified nor presented any other evidence. Henson\r\n\nwas convicted on all of the charges against him—murder, ABWIK, conspiracy,\r\nthree counts of armed robbery, and five counts of possession of a firearm during\r\nthe commission of a violent crime.3 He was sentenced to life imprisonment for the\r\nmurder charge, twenty years for the ABWIK charge, five years for the conspiracy\r\ncharge, thirty years for each of the armed robbery charges, and five years for each\r\nof the firearm possession charges, all to run concurrently.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       The Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment to the United States\r\nConstitution provides that \"[i]n all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy\r\nthe right to . . . be confronted with the witnesses against him . . . .\" U.S. Const.\r\namend. VI. This constitutional right, which applies to the states through the\r\nFourteenth Amendment, guarantees a defendant in a criminal trial the right to\r\ncross-examine the witnesses against him. Pointer v. Texas, 380 U.S. 400, 403–04\r\n(1965). In a joint trial, the admission of a nontestifying codefendant's confession\r\nthat implicates a defendant violates the defendant's Confrontation Clause rights.\r\nBruton v. United States, 391 U.S. 123, 126 (1968).\r\n\r\n       Historically, instructing the jury to consider a confession as only evidence\r\nagainst the confessing codefendant was considered sufficient under the\r\nConfrontation Clause, but in Bruton the United States Supreme Court dispensed\r\nwith that fiction. Bruton, 391 U.S. at 135–36. It found \"there are some contexts in\r\nwhich the risk that the jury will not, or cannot, follow instructions is so great, and\r\nthe consequences of failure so vital to the defendant, that the practical and human\r\nlimitations of the jury system cannot be ignored.\" Id. at 135. The Court concluded\r\nthe admission of a confession without the ability to cross-examine the confessor\r\nwas just such a situation, reasoning \"[n]ot only are the incriminations devastating\r\nto the defendant but their credibility is inevitably suspect, a fact recognized when\r\naccomplices do take the stand and the jury is instructed to weigh their testimony\r\ncarefully given the recognized motivation to shift blame onto others.\" Id. at 136.\r\nWhile appearing to establish a bright-line rule against the admission of a\r\ncodefendant's confession which incriminates a defendant, the Court acknowledged\r\nthere are alternatives which may allow the admission of a confession while still\r\n\r\n3 Reid, indicted on the same charges, was convicted on three counts of armed\r\nrobbery, three counts of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\ncrime, and one count of conspiracy. He was found not guilty on the murder\r\ncharge. On the ABWIK charge he was convicted of the lesser included offense of\r\nassault and battery of a high and aggravated nature.\r\n\nprotecting a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights and in a footnote, mentioned\r\nredaction as one of those alternatives. See id. at 133–34 & n.10.\r\n\r\n       Since Bruton, the Supreme Court has twice revisited this issue in order to\r\ndetermine what constitutes sufficient redaction so as to protect a defendant's\r\nConfrontation Clause rights. In Richardson v. Marsh, 481 U.S. 200 (1987), the\r\nCourt was called upon to decide whether the Confrontation Clause is violated\r\n\"when the codefendant's confession is redacted to omit any reference to the\r\ndefendant, but the defendant is nonetheless linked to the confession by evidence\r\nproperly admitted against him at trial.\" Id. at 202. The Court ultimately held the\r\nConfrontation Clause is not violated by the admission of a codefendant's\r\nconfession where a limiting instruction is given and \"the confession is redacted to\r\neliminate not only the defendant's name, but any reference to his or her existence.\"\r\nId. at 211. In a footnote appended to that holding, the Court declined to express\r\nany opinion \"on the admissibility of a confession in which the defendant's name\r\nhas been replaced with a symbol or neutral pronoun.\" Id. at 211 n.5.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court most recently addressed the issue in Gray v. Maryland,\r\n523 U.S. 185 (1998), in which a codefendant's confession was redacted by the\r\ninsertion of \"deleted\" or \"deletion\" when the confession was read to the jury and\r\nthe insertion of blank spaces in the written document wherever the petitioner's\r\nname appeared. Id. at 188. The Court held that obviously redacted confessions so\r\nclosely resemble unredacted confessions in their incriminating effect that they too\r\nare barred by Bruton. Id. at 192. The Court reasoned that \"a jury will often react\r\nsimilarly to an unredacted confession and a confession redacted in this way, for the\r\njury will often realize that the confession refers specifically to the defendant\" and\r\noffered as an example:\r\n\r\n      Consider a simplified but typical example, a confession that reads \"I,\r\n      Bob Smith, along with Sam Jones, robbed the bank.\" To replace the\r\n      words \"Sam Jones\" with an obvious blank will not likely fool anyone.\r\n      A juror somewhat familiar with criminal law would know\r\n      immediately that the blank, in the phrase \"I, Bob Smith, along\r\n      with       , robbed the bank,\" refers to defendant Jones. A juror who\r\n      does not know the law and who therefore wonders to whom the blank\r\n      might refer need only lift his eyes to Jones, sitting at counsel table, to\r\n      find what will seem the obvious answer, at least if the juror hears the\r\n      judge's instruction not to consider the confession as evidence against\r\n      Jones, for that instruction will provide an obvious reason for the\r\n      blank. A more sophisticated juror, wondering if the blank refers to\r\n\n      someone else, might also wonder how, if it did, the prosecutor could\r\n      argue the confession is reliable, for the prosecutor, after all, has been\r\n      arguing that Jones, not someone else, helped Smith commit the crime.\r\n\r\nId. at 193. Therefore, the Court concluded that the alterations performed the same\r\naccusatory function as using the defendant's name. Id. at 193–94.\r\n\r\n      Acknowledging that Richardson limited Bruton to facially incriminating\r\nconfessions and placed confessions that \"incriminate inferentially\" outside Bruton,\r\nthe Court distinguished Richardson on the basis that unlike the confession there,\r\nthe confession admitted in Gray \"refer[ed] directly to the 'existence' of the\r\nnonconfessing defendant.\" Id. at 192. The Court clarified that Richardson did not\r\nturn on whether the confession admitted required an inference in order to\r\nincriminate the defendant, but on the kind of inference required. Id. at 196.\r\nUltimately, the Court held:\r\n\r\n      The inferences at issue here involve statements that, despite redaction,\r\n      obviously refer directly to someone, often obviously the defendant,\r\n      and which involve inferences that a jury ordinarily could make\r\n      immediately, even were the confession the very first item introduced\r\n      at trial. Moreover, the redacted confession with the blank prominent\r\n      on its face, in Richardson's words, \"facially incriminat[es]\" the\r\n      codefendant.\r\n\r\nId. at 196 (alteration in original). In other words, the Court brought within\r\nBruton's prohibition those confessions which facially incriminate through\r\ninference.\r\n\r\n       Gray did not directly address confessions redacted through the use of neutral\r\npronouns as was done here. However, following Gray, in State v. Holder, 382 S.C.\r\n278, 676 S.E.2d 690 (2009), this Court held, consistent with many other courts\r\nconsidering the issue, that even a confession redacted through the use of neutral\r\npronouns violates the Confrontation Clause if it facially incriminates a\r\nnonconfessing codefendant. Id. at 285–86, 676 S.E.2d at 694. This follows\r\ndirectly from Gray where the holding turned on the fact that despite redaction the\r\nstatements were \"directly accusatory\" and \"obviously refer[ed] directly to\r\nsomeone, often obviously the defendant.\" Gray, 523 U.S. at 194, 196. In short,\r\nwhere redacted confessions use neutral pronouns which facially refer to a\r\ncodefendant, they violate the Confrontation Clause.\r\n\r\n      In Holder, the appellant and a man she was living with were charged with\r\n\nhomicide by child abuse for the death of the appellant's child and tried jointly.\r\nHolder, 382 S.C. at 281–82, 676 S.E.2d at 692–93. At trial, the man's redacted\r\nstatement to the police that \"he felt like she had been inflicting\" injuries on the\r\nchild was admitted into evidence. Id. at 283, 676 S.E.2d at 693. The Court held\r\nthe redacted statement violated the Confrontation Clause because it was apparent\r\nthe statement was referring to the appellant even without considering any other\r\nevidence introduced at trial. Id. at 285–86, 676 S.E.2d at 694.\r\n\r\n       We find this case comparable to Holder. We also find persuasive the\r\nholdings of courts in other jurisdictions that redactions similar to the one at issue\r\nhere violate the Confrontation Clause. In United States v. Richards, 241 F.3d 335\r\n(3d Cir. 2001), the appellant and a codefendant were tried jointly for robbing an\r\narmored car and the codefendant's redacted confession was admitted into evidence.\r\nId. at 341. The redacted confession did not refer to the appellant by name but\r\nreferred to him as the codefendant's \"friend.\" Id. The court held the \"reference to\r\nhis 'friend' was just as blatant and incriminating of [the appellant] as the word\r\n'deleted' in the Gray case.\" Id. The court explained that the confessor's statement\r\n\"referred to the existence of three participants in the crime—[the confessor], the\r\n'inside man,' and 'my friend.' Since the 'inside man' was easily identified as the\r\ndriver of the Brink's van, the reference to 'my friend' sharply incriminated [the\r\nappellant], the only other person involved in the case.\" Id. Thus, knowing only\r\nwho the parties were and the fact that the appellant sat before them as a defendant,\r\nthe jury would likely infer that the statement referred to the appellant as a\r\nparticipant in the crime. Therefore, the confession directly implicated the appellant\r\nand violated the Confrontation Clause. See id.\r\n\r\n       In Stanford v. Parker, 266 F.3d 442 (6th Cir. 2001), the petitioner was tried\r\njointly with a coconspirator. Id. at 449. His codefendant's confession was redacted\r\nto replace the petitioner's name with \"the other person\" and then read into evidence\r\nby a detective. Id. at 456. On appeal of the denial of his habeas corpus petition,\r\nthe court held the redaction would not have prevented the jury from inferring that\r\nthe confession referred to the petitioner and thus, the admission of the confession\r\nviolated the Confrontation Clause. Id. at 457. The court reasoned the jury would\r\nmake the inference because the petitioner \"sat as a defendant before the jury\" and\r\nthe confession was offered into evidence by the prosecution which the jury knew\r\nwas seeking the petitioner's conviction. Id.\r\n\r\n      Finally, the Arkansas Supreme Court addressed a similar issue in Jefferson\r\nv. State, 198 S.W.3d 527 (Ark. 2004), where three individuals robbed a bank\r\ncourier, one pled guilty, and the other two were tried jointly. Id. at 529–30. A\r\n\ncodefendant's confession was admitted into evidence after changing the appellant's\r\nname therein to \"he,\" \"they,\" or \"some other guy.\" Id. at 530–31. The court found\r\nit was clear from the redacted statement that a third person participated in the\r\ncrime. Id. at 535. The court concluded the confession \"obviously directly referred\r\nto [the appellant], an inference that the jury easily could have drawn from [the\r\nappellant's] status as a codefendant and the State's concession that [the\r\ncodefendant] was the shooter.\" Id. at 536. Accordingly, it held the admission of\r\nthe confession violated the Confrontation Clause. Id.\r\n\r\n       Like Holder and these cases from other jurisdictions, here the jury could\r\ninfer from the face of Reid's confession without relying on any other evidence, that\r\nthe confession referred to and incriminated Henson. In his opening statement the\r\nsolicitor asserted that four individuals—Henson, Reid, Ervin, and Newman—\r\ncommitted the crimes and that Henson was the shooter. Reid's redacted confession\r\nwas offered into evidence by the solicitor. It identified three individuals by name\r\nas committing the crimes and acknowledged that another male participated and\r\nfired the fatal shots, but left that person unnamed. The jury likely would infer that\r\nHenson—a male, seated before them as a defendant, and the only defendant not\r\nnamed in the confession—was the fourth individual and the shooter referenced in\r\nReid's confession. The jury also could presume the solicitor would not both assert\r\nthat Henson was the fourth conspirator and offer the confession into evidence if the\r\nsolicitor believed the confession referred to anyone other than Henson.\r\n\r\n       While Confrontation Clause violations are subject to harmless error analysis\r\nand the State would have us declare the error here harmless, we cannot do so.\r\nBefore an error can be held harmless, a court must find the error harmless beyond a\r\nreasonable doubt. Chapman v. California, 386 U.S. 18, 24 (1967). That requires a\r\ncourt to determine \"whether there is a reasonable possibility that the evidence\r\ncomplained of might have contributed to the conviction.\" Fahy v. Connecticut,\r\n375 U.S. 85, 86 (1963); see also State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d\r\n262, 267 (2006) (\"Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not\r\ncontribute to the verdict obtained.\"). In the context of Confrontation Clause\r\nviolations through the admission of a codefendant's confession, the harmless error\r\nstandard has been formulated as: \"In some cases the properly admitted evidence of\r\nguilt is so overwhelming, and the prejudicial effect of the codefendant's admission\r\nis so insignificant by comparison, that it is clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the\r\nimproper use of the admission was harmless error.\" Schneble v. Florida, 405 U.S.\r\n427, 430 (1972).\r\n\n       Here, we cannot say the admission of Reid's confession did not contribute to\r\nthe verdict, nor can we say the evidence against Henson was overwhelming or the\r\nprejudicial effect of Reid's confession was insignificant. Other than the\r\ncoconspirators, no witness was able to identify the shooter. The surviving victims,\r\nJackson and Cunningham, were able to describe the shooter as a black male with a\r\nBaltimore accent, which matches Henson but is hardly overwhelming evidence.\r\nAdditionally, no physical evidence linked Henson to the crimes. The only\r\nevidence other than Reid's confession actually identifying Henson as a conspirator\r\nwas the testimony of Ervin and Newman. However, Ervin and Newman both\r\nfaced charges for their participation in the crimes and thus, had an incentive to\r\ndownplay their involvement and shift blame onto others. Therefore, we conclude\r\nthe error was not harmless.\r\n\r\n       While severing trials certainly impacts judicial economy and State resources,\r\nthese factors should not take precedence over the protection of a defendant's\r\nconstitutional rights. Here, unless Reid's confession could be redacted in such a\r\nway that Henson was not implicated, the only alternatives were to not admit the\r\nconfession or to grant Henson's motion to sever.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n      The admission of Reid's redacted confession violated Henson's\r\nConfrontation Clause rights and was not harmless error. Accordingly, we reverse\r\nand remand for a new trial.4\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Henson also appealed the circuit court's removal and replacement of a juror due\r\nto the juror's independent knowledge of the case without the court first questioning\r\nthe juror. Because the Confrontation Clause issue is dispositive, we decline to\r\nconsider this additional issue. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown,\r\nInc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (holding that where one issue\r\nis dispositive it is not necessary to consider any remaining issues).\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27355","title":"Carnival Corporation v.

We hold these groups lack standing\r\nand dismiss.     FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      The plaintiffs in this case consist of four Charleston citizens' groups: the\r\nHistoric Ansonborough Neighborhood Association (Ansonborough Association),\r\nthe Charlestowne Neighborhood Association (Charlestowne Association), the\r\nCoastal Conservation League (League), and the Preservation Society of Charleston\r\n(Preservation Society) (collectively Plaintiffs). The Ansonborough Association is\r\na nonprofit corporation composed of residents, property owners, and tenants of the\r\nAnsonborough neighborhood which is concerned with compliance with land use\r\nlaws and threats to the quality of life in the area. Similarly, the Charlestowne\r\nAssociation is a nonprofit that seeks to protect the quality of life for residents of\r\nthe Charlestowne neighborhood. Both the Ansonborough Association and the\r\n\nCharlestowne Association are located in the Old and Historic District near the\r\nUnion Pier Terminal (the Terminal) in Charleston. The League is a nonprofit\r\ncorporation with a mission of conserving natural resources and protecting the\r\nquality of life in South Carolina. The Preservation Society is a nonprofit\r\ncorporation headquartered in Charleston which seeks to protect the historic,\r\narchitectural, and cultural character of Charleston.\r\n\r\n      Plaintiffs brought suit seeking an injunction against what they believe to be\r\nthe unlawful use of the Terminal by the Carnival Corporation's cruise ship, the\r\nFantasy. Plaintiffs' complaint named Carnival as the sole defendant, but the South\r\nCarolina State Ports Authority, which owns and operates the Terminal, and the\r\nCity of Charleston were later permitted to intervene as defendants (collectively\r\nDefendants).\r\n\r\n       Plaintiffs' first amended complaint alleges the Terminal is used as the\r\nFantasy's home port where crew, passengers, and supplies load and unload for\r\neach voyage. The Fantasy is 855 feet long and more than 60 feet tall from the\r\nwater line and can carry up to 2,056 passengers and 829 crewmembers. Since\r\n2010, the Ports Authority has contracted with Carnival for the use of the Terminal\r\nas the Fantasy's home port. The Terminal is within the City's Old and Historic\r\nDistrict which is listed on the National Register of Historic Places maintained by\r\nthe United States Department of the Interior.\r\n\r\n       Plaintiffs allege the Fantasy's operations at the Terminal harm the Old and\r\nHistoric District and them in a number of ways. They allege the Fantasy can be\r\nseen above the historic buildings of Charleston and that it disrupts the historic\r\nskyline. The thousands of passengers and crew allegedly cause major traffic\r\ncongestion in the area as well as the closure of public roads. The Fantasy\r\nallegedly emits noise pollution through music and broadcast announcements and\r\nair pollution through particulates produced by its diesel engines. Plaintiffs contend\r\nexpanded cruise ship operations may jeopardize the Old and Historic District's\r\nlisting on the National Register of Historic Places.\r\n\r\n      Plaintiffs' complaint seeks injunctive relief based on ten claims: seven based\r\non City ordinances, a public nuisance claim, a private nuisance claim, and a claim\r\nbased on the South Carolina Pollution Control Act. The ordinance claims assert\r\nthe Fantasy's use of the Terminal violates the City's zoning code because it is not a\r\npermissible use within the light industrial zone applicable to the Terminal, it is an\r\naccommodations use in an area not zoned for accommodations uses, it is a tour\r\nboat use in an area not within a tour boat overlay zone, the Fantasy exceeds the\r\n\napplicable height ordinance, and the ship blocks views of the Cooper River in\r\nviolation of the applicable view corridor provisions. The complaint also alleges\r\nCarnival violates the City's sign ordinance because the Fantasy's smokestack is a\r\nsign and violates the City's noise ordinance because the Fantasy makes\r\nannouncements over amplified sound systems.\r\n\r\n       Defendants initially filed motions to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6),\r\nSCRCP, contending Plaintiffs' complaint fails to state a claim for relief because\r\nPlaintiffs lack standing, as a matter of law the ordinances do not apply to cruise\r\nship operations at the Terminal, and to the extent the ordinances apply they are\r\npreempted by federal and state law. Before the circuit court could rule on the\r\nmotions to dismiss, Defendants petitioned this Court to take the case in its original\r\njurisdiction. The Court granted the petition, transferred the case to this Court, and\r\nappointed the Honorable Clifton B. Newman, Circuit Court Judge, as special\r\nreferee to conduct a hearing and make recommendations on the motions to dismiss.\r\n\r\n       Following a hearing, Judge Newman issued a report recommending the\r\nCourt grant the motions to dismiss as to all of the ordinance claims and the\r\nPollution Control Act claim, but deny the motion as to the two nuisance claims.\r\nGenerally, the report found that as a matter of law none of the ordinances apply to\r\nthe Fantasy's use of the Terminal, the Pollution Control Act does not govern the\r\nFantasy's discharges in South Carolina waters, and the complaint makes sufficient\r\nallegations to set forth both a private and a public nuisance cause of action. The\r\nreport did not consider the issues of standing and preemption. Plaintiffs and\r\nDefendants filed exceptions to the report. After considering the report and the\r\nexceptions, this Court dismissed the noise ordinance, sign ordinance, and Pollution\r\nControl Act claims. This Court withheld ruling on the motions to dismiss on the\r\nfive zoning and two nuisance claims and ordered the parties to brief the issues of\r\nstanding, preemption, and whether the zoning ordinances apply to the Fantasy's\r\nuse of the Terminal.           ISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI. \t    Whether Plaintiffs possess standing to assert their claims?\r\n\r\nII. \t   Whether the zoning ordinances apply to the Fantasy's use of the Terminal?\r\n\r\nIII. \t If the zoning ordinances are applicable to the Fantasy's use of the Terminal,\r\n       whether the zoning ordinances are preempted by federal or state law?\r\n\r\nIV.\t Whether Plaintiffs' public nuisance claim should be dismissed for failing to\r\n\n       state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?\r\n\r\nV. \t   Whether Plaintiffs' private nuisance claim should be dismissed for failing to\r\n       state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action?\r\n\r\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        Under Rule 12(b)(6), a defendant may move to dismiss a complaint due to\r\nits \"failure to state facts sufficient to constitute a cause of action.\" In considering a\r\nmotion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6), a court must base its ruling solely on the\r\nallegations set forth in the complaint. Doe v. Marion, 373 S.C. 390, 395, 645\r\nS.E.2d 245, 247 (2007). If the facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible\r\ntherefrom, viewed in the light most favorable to the plaintiff, would entitle the\r\nplaintiff to relief on any theory, dismissal under Rule 12(b)(6) is improper. Id.\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       Defendants move to dismiss Plaintiffs' complaint in its entirety on the\r\nground Plaintiffs lack standing to bring any of the claims contained therein. We\r\nagree. For a plaintiff to possess standing three elements must be satisfied. First, the\r\nplaintiff must have suffered an injury-in-fact which is a concrete, particularized,\r\nand actual or imminent invasion of a legally protected interest. Sea Pines Ass'n for\r\nthe Prot. of Wildlife v. S.C. Dep't of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 600–01, 550\r\nS.E.2d 287, 291–92 (2001). Second, a causal connection must exist between the\r\ninjury and the challenged conduct. Id. Third, it must be likely that a favorable\r\ndecision will redress the injury. Id.\r\n\r\n       Here, Defendants focus on the first, injury-in-fact element of standing,\r\nasserting Plaintiffs allege only generalized grievances suffered by the public as a\r\nwhole and fail to allege any particularized harm. Reviewing Plaintiffs' complaint,\r\nwe conclude Plaintiffs fail to allege a concrete, particularized harm to a legally\r\nprotected interest and therefore hold Plaintiffs lack standing.\r\n\r\n       In order for an injury to be particularized, it must affect the plaintiff in a\r\npersonal and individual way. Id. at 602, 550 S.E.2d at 292; see also Lujan v.\r\nDefenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 n.1 (1992). While arising from the\r\ndifferent context of a challenge to government action, in Lujan the United States\r\nSupreme Court distinguished generalized injuries from those injuries sufficiently\r\nparticuarlized as to create standing, writing: \"[A] plaintiff raising only a generally\r\n\navailable grievance about government—claiming only harm to his and every\r\ncitizen's interest in proper application of the Constitution and laws, and seeking\r\nrelief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at\r\nlarge—does not\" possess standing. Lujan, 504 U.S. at 573–74.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, a plaintiff that is an association, such as Plaintiffs here, may\r\npossess standing by virtue of associational standing on behalf of its members. An\r\norganization has associational standing \"if one or more of its members will suffer\r\nan individual injury by virtue of the contested act.\" Sea Pines, 345 S.C. at 600–01,\r\n550 S.E.2d at 291. The three part test for associational standing requires that an\r\nassociation's members would otherwise have standing to sue in their own right, the\r\ninterests at stake are germane to the organization's purpose, and neither the claim\r\nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of individual members in\r\nthe lawsuit. Friends of the Earth, Inc. v. Laidlaw Envtl. Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528\r\nU.S. 167, 181 (2000), see also Beaufort Realty Co. v. Beaufort Cnty., 346 S.C. 298,\r\n301, 551 S.E.2d 588, 589 (Ct. App. 2001) (applying that test). Accordingly, to\r\npossess standing, either Plaintiffs alone must have suffered a concrete,\r\nparticularized injury or their members must have suffered such an injury and the\r\nother elements of associational standing must be satisfied.\r\n\r\n       Here, Plaintiffs fail to allege a particularized injury either to themselves or\r\ntheir members. Rather, they assert only generalized grievances suffered by the\r\npublic as a whole which are insufficient to establish standing. Specifically,\r\nPlaintiffs' allegations of harm relevant to the remaining claims consist of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n   \t \"The crowds, pollution, and traffic associated with these unlawful operations\r\n      create a nuisance for Charleston citizens. This lawsuit aims to protect\r\n      Charleston's neighborhoods, families and the environment by having\r\n      Defendant Carnival play by the longstanding rules and norms that have\r\n      made—and make—Charleston a wonderful place to work, live, and visit.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"[T]he Fantasy visually disrupts the historic skyline.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"The influx of thousands of passengers, crew, and support personnel (and\r\n      associated traffic) . . . cause major traffic congestion downtown and the\r\n      closure of public roads.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"The vessels emit noise pollution, including broadcast announcements and\r\n      music, and the burning of diesel fuel emits visible particulate soot from ship\r\n\n      funnels—all adjacent to the Old and Historic District.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"Home-porting cruise operations at an industrial scale could jeopardize the\r\n      integrity, setting, and context that led to National Register designation and\r\n      place maintenance of National Register status at risk.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"On Fantasy embarkation and debarkation days, portions of Concord and\r\n      Washington Streets—which are public streets—are closed for cruise\r\n      business. Because of those closures, displacement of traffic, and the\r\n      concentration of cruise traffic in a limited area for a limited time, cruise\r\n      embarkations and debarkations cause increased congestion along the east\r\n      side of the downtown Peninsula.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"Cruise ships such as the Defendant's Fantasy also emit visible particulate\r\n      soot and other pollutants, including nitrogen and sulfur oxides, which are\r\n      harmful to human health when inhaled and are deposited into the\r\n      surrounding waters and land.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"Defendant's actions including noncompliance with zoning and\r\n      environmental laws have injured the above Plaintiff organizations and their\r\n      members by among other things reducing their use and enjoyment of the\r\n      local environment and Charleston's historic assets, including their homes,\r\n      neighborhoods and protected structures.\"\r\n\r\n   \t \"Cruise operations downtown and ineffective management of them cause,\r\n      among other things, traffic congestion, pollution emissions, road closures,\r\n      large crowds, loud noises, and obstructed views that are incompatible with\r\n      the area's historic setting, scale, and residential character and impact health\r\n      and the environment.\"\r\n\r\n       Lacking from these allegations is any claim that Plaintiffs themselves or\r\ntheir members have suffered a particularized harm. All members of the public\r\nsuffer from and are inconvenienced by traffic congestion, pollution, noises, and\r\nobstructed views, and Plaintiffs have not alleged they suffer these harms in any\r\npersonal, individual way. In short, these allegations are simply complaints about\r\ninconveniences suffered broadly by all persons residing in or passing through the\r\nCity of Charleston and therefore, Plaintiffs fail to establish the first element of\r\nstanding.\r\n\r\n      While a public nuisance cause of action can be used to remedy harms\r\n\nsuffered by the public generally, typically only the State may assert this cause of\r\naction. See Brown v. Hendricks, 211 S.C. 395, 400, 45 S.E.2d 603, 605 (1947)\r\n(stating that generally \"a private action does not lie to abate a public nuisance\"). A\r\nprivate person may bring a private civil suit for a public nuisance only if he\r\nsuffered a special injury to his real or personal property. See Overcash v. S.C.\r\nElec. & Gas. Co., 364 S.C. 569, 575, 614 S.E.2d 619, 622 (2005); Brown, 211 S.C.\r\nat 400, 45 S.E.2d at 605. A special injury is \"individual or specific damage in\r\naddition to that suffered by the public,\" Brown, 211 S.C. at 400, 45 S.E.2d at 605,\r\nand must be \"of a special character, distinct and different from the injuries suffered\r\nby the public generally,\" Bowlin v. George, 239 S.C. 429, 433–34, 123 S.E.2d 528,\r\n530 (1962). In other words, the public nuisance cause of action does not obviate\r\nthe requirement of a particularized injury. Rather, for a private party to bring a\r\npublic nuisance cause of action, the private party must have suffered a\r\nparticularized injury. As previously discussed, Plaintiffs fail to set forth any injury\r\nthey or their members have suffered that is different from the injury suffered by the\r\npublic generally. Therefore, the public nuisance cause of action does not provide\r\nPlaintiffs with the standing they otherwise lack.\r\n\r\n       Plaintiffs also assert that as to their zoning claims, Section 6-29-950 of the\r\nSouth Carolina Code (2004) provides standing. While that statute does provide a\r\nlegally protected interest and thereby standing for neighbors of properties violating\r\na local zoning ordinance, we conclude Plaintiffs' complaint fails to make factual\r\nallegations sufficient to establish the applicability of section 6-29-950 here.\r\n\r\n      Section 6-29-950 provides in part:\r\n\r\n      In case a building, structure, or land is or is proposed to be used in\r\n      violation of any ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter, the zoning\r\n      administrator or other appropriate administrative officer, municipal or\r\n      county attorney, or other appropriate authority of the municipality or\r\n      county or an adjacent or neighboring property owner who would be\r\n      specially damaged by the violation may in addition to other remedies,\r\n      institute injunction, mandamus, or other appropriate action or\r\n      proceeding to prevent the unlawful erection, construction,\r\n      reconstruction, alteration, conversion, maintenance, or use, or to\r\n      correct or abate the violation, or to prevent the occupancy of the\r\n      building, structure, or land.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). In short, under section 6-29-950 a specially damaged, adjacent\r\nor neighboring property owner can bring an action for an injunction based on an\r\n\nalleged violation of a zoning ordinance.\r\n\r\n       Section 6-29-950's requirement that a private party seeking to enjoin a\r\nzoning violation must be specially damaged incorporates the particularized injury\r\nrequirement of general standing doctrine as a requirement for the statute to apply.\r\nAgain, even assuming the Fantasy violates the City's zoning ordinances as alleged\r\nby Plaintiffs' complaint, Plaintiffs have not alleged that as a result of the violations\r\nthey suffer any injury distinct from that suffered by the public generally.\r\nAdditionally, section 6-29-950 only permits \"an adjacent or neighboring property\r\nowner\" to bring suit. (emphasis added). Here, Plaintiffs have made no allegations\r\nthat they own adjacent or neighboring property. They do allege that the League is\r\na tenant in a nearby property and that the Preservation Society holds a conservation\r\neasement on a nearby property. However, those interests do not make the League\r\nor the Preservation Society a \"property owner\" as required by the statute to bring\r\nsuit. See Connor Holdings, LLC v. Cousins, 373 S.C. 81, 85, 644 S.E.2d 58, 60\r\n(2007) (holding a tenant lacked standing under a town land management ordinance\r\nusing identical \"adjacent or neighboring property owner\" language). Therefore,\r\nbecause Plaintiffs fail to allege that they are or will be specially damaged or that\r\nthey are a neighboring or adjacent property owner, section 6-29-950 is inapplicable\r\nand does not provide Plaintiffs with standing to assert their zoning claims.\r\n\r\n       Finally, Plaintiffs assert the public importance exception should apply to\r\nremedy any lack of standing. South Carolina courts recognize an exception to the\r\nrequirement that a plaintiff possess standing where \"an issue is of such public\r\nimportance as to require its resolution for future guidance.\" Davis v. Richland\r\nCnty. Council, 372 S.C. 497, 500, 642 S.E.2d 740, 741 (2007). Whether the\r\nexception applies in a particular case turns on whether resolution of the dispute is\r\nneeded for future guidance. ATC South, Inc. v. Charleston Cnty., 380 S.C. 191,\r\n199, 669 S.E.2d 337, 341 (2008). While the need for future guidance generally\r\ndictates when the exception applies, the application of the exception in a particular\r\ncase does not turn on a rigid formula but rather is determined by the competing\r\npolicy concerns underlying the exception. Id. Those competing concerns are that:\r\n\r\n      Citizens must be afforded access to the judicial process to address\r\n      alleged injustices. On the other hand, standing cannot be granted to\r\n      every individual who has a grievance against a public official.\r\n      Otherwise, public officials would be subject to numerous lawsuits at\r\n      the expense of both judicial economy and the freedom from frivolous\r\n      lawsuits.\r\n\nSloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 434, 593 S.E.2d 470, 472 (2004).\r\n\r\n             In support of their argument that the public importance exception\r\napplies, Plaintiffs first rely on Defendants' petition for original jurisdiction and its\r\nnumerous statements that this case deals with matters of \"public interest.\"\r\nPlaintiffs contend that if the Court found the case was of sufficient public interest\r\nso as to grant the petition for original jurisdiction, a fortiori the case is also of\r\nsufficient public importance such that the public importance exception applies.\r\nWhile the Court may exercise original jurisdiction under Rule 245, SCACR, \"[i]f\r\nthe public interest is involved,\" the \"public interest\" standard of Rule 245 is not\r\nsynonymous with the public importance necessary for the public importance\r\nexception to standing to apply. Rule 245 is concerned with whether a case should\r\nbe resolved by this Court in the first instance because of the public interest\r\ninvolved and the need for prompt resolution, whereas the public importance\r\nexception is concerned with whether a case is of such public importance that the\r\nrequirement of standing should be waived. Thus, because the two rules aim to\r\nanswer different questions—whether the public interest requires expeditious\r\nresolution of a case versus whether the public interest requires resolution of a\r\ndispute for future guidance despite the lack of standing—the grant of the petition\r\nfor original jurisdiction has no effect upon whether the public importance\r\nexception applies.\r\n\r\n      Fundamentally, the issues in this case are whether zoning ordinances are\r\npreempted by federal and state law, the applicability of zoning ordinances to a\r\ncruise ship, and tort liability for a public and a private nuisance cause of action.\r\nThe case presents no issue of the constitutionality or legality of government action.\r\nAdditionally, the claims asserted by Plaintiffs could be brought by other parties\r\nwho can show the required injury. Therefore, we find the public importance\r\nexception inapplicable here.\r\n\r\n      In our constitutional system of government with its separation of powers,\r\ncourts exercise the limited constitutional function of the \"judicial power.\" S.C.\r\nConst. art. V, § 1. Accordingly, courts are limited to resolving cases and the\r\npowers inherent in that function. Courts are not bodies for the resolution of public\r\npolicy and generalized grievances. Harms suffered by the public at large, like\r\nthose Plaintiffs allege here, are to be remedied by the legislative and executive\r\nbranches. If existing laws and regulations or their enforcement fail to protect the\r\npublic from harm, it is incumbent upon the public to seek reform through their\r\nelected officials or failing that, at the ballot box.\r\n\n                                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      We hold Plaintiffs lack standing. Because standing is a fundamental\r\nprerequisite for instituting a legal action, we do not consider the remaining issues.\r\nAccordingly, we grant Defendants' motions to dismiss.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27386","title":"Davis v.

Holmes and Allan Riley Holmes, Jr., both of\r\n            Gibbs & Holmes, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: KB Home and Jeff Meyer (collectively KB Home) seek review\r\nof the Court of Appeals' decision in Davis v. KB Home of S.C., Inc., 394 S.C. 116,\r\n713 S.E.2d 799 (Ct. App. 2011), finding the trial judge had authority to determine\r\n\nthe validity of an arbitration clause contained in an employment application\r\nsubmitted by Lonnie Davis and finding KB Home waived the right to compel\r\narbitration. We deny the petition for a writ of certiorari as to KB Home's Question\r\nI and affirm with regard to the trial judge's authority to determine the validity of\r\nthe arbitration clause. However, we grant the petition as to KB Home's Question\r\nII, dispense with further briefing, and vacate the portion of the Court of Appeals'\r\nopinion regarding waiver of the right to compel arbitration.\r\n\r\nAfter properly concluding, pursuant to Buckeye Check Cashing, Inc. v. Cardegna,1\r\nthat the trial judge had the authority to determine the validity of the arbitration\r\nclause contained in the employment application, the Court of Appeals went on to\r\nhold that the application, and the arbitration clause therein, were superseded and\r\nrendered invalid by the presence of a merger clause in the employment contract\r\nbetween KB Home and Davis. Having concluded such, it was unnecessary to\r\naddress Davis' argument that KB Home waived the right to compel arbitration\r\nbecause a substantial length of time had passed, the parties engaged in extensive\r\ndiscovery, and the parties had availed themselves of the circuit court's assistance.\r\nSee Futch v.
