Burnett, South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nPatricia Logan Harrison, of Columbia, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This case was certified for review pursuant to SCACR 204(b).Â  After hearing oral arguments, this Court issued an opinion affirming the trial judgeâ€™s decision to distribute insurance proceeds into Special Needs Trusts for the injured children and to grant the South Carolina Department of Health and Human Services (â€œMedicaidâ€) a right to the proceeds upon the childrenâ€™s death.Â  Ex Parte: South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Human Services, Op. No. 25529 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed August 9, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 31 at 42).Â  We subsequently granted Medicaidâ€™s petition for rehearing, and following rehearing, we withdraw our prior opinion and substitute it with this opinion.Â  For a different reason than in our prior opinion, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s decision. \r\nFactual / Procedural background\r\nFive fourteen-year-olds were injured in a single-car automobile accident in 1999.Â  The children were treated for their injuries, which were minor for Paul Jackson, Joseph Rakes, and Tesa Jackson and extensive for Justin Jackson (Justin) and Nikkia Rakes (Nikkia).[1]Â  Medicaid paid $92,494.18 of approximately $183,000 in medical costs for Justin, and it paid $28,911.71 of approximately $105,000 in costs for Nikkia.Â  \r\nState Farm Insurance Company (Insurer) filed an interpleader action, asking the court to â€œallocate the allegedly available insurance proceedsâ€ among the five children.[2]Â  In total, the driverâ€™s policy consisted of a $50,000 liability policy and two $50,000 underinsured motorist policies.Â  At the hearing, Medicaid appeared and argued that it was to be reimbursed before the proceeds could be paid to the children.\r\nThe trial judge ruled that the proceeds from the underinsured policies were not subject to subrogation and assignment, and therefore, Medicaid only had a claim to the $50,000 in proceeds stemming from the liability policy.Â  The judge then distributed the available funds among the five children, placing the proceeds for Nikkia and Justin into Special Needs Trusts[3] for their benefit during their lifetime.Â  In addition, the judge noted that Medicaid would be permitted, upon the childrenâ€™s deaths, to recover any proceeds remaining in the trusts.Â  Finally, the trial judge awarded Medicaid $6,000, representing one-third of the liability insurance proceeds given to the other three children.[4]Â Â Â  \r\nMedicaid appealed and raised the following issue for review:Â  \r\n\r\nDid the trial judge err in placing the insurance proceeds into Special Needs Trusts before satisfying Medicaidâ€™s claim to those proceeds?Â Â  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nMedicaid argues that the trial judge erred in placing the insurance proceeds into Special Needs Trusts before satisfying Medicaidâ€™s claim to those proceeds.Â  We disagree.Â  Because Medicaid was unable to establish that it had obtained an enforceable assignment of rights, Medicaid was not immediately entitled to the proceeds.Â Â Â  \r\nIn order to receive Medicaid benefits, an individual must â€œassign the State any rights, of the individual or of any other person who is eligible for medical assistance â€¦ and on whose behalf the individual has the legal authority to execute an assignment of such rights, to support . . . and to payment for medical care from any third party.â€Â  42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396k(a)(1)(A) (2000).Â  Under South Carolina statutory law, such an assignment of rights is automatic.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 43-7-420(A) (Supp. 2002) (providing that â€œ[e]very applicant or recipient, only to the extent of the amount of medical assistance paid by Medicaid, shall be deemed to have assigned his rights to recoverâ€) (emphasis added).Â  Federal law, however, provides the following safeguard: â€œ[i]f assignment of rights to benefits is automatic because of State law, the [state agency] may substitute such an assignment for an individual executed assignment, as long as the [state agency] informs the individual of the terms and consequences of the State law.â€Â  42 C.F.R. Â§ 433.146(c) (emphasis added).\r\nIn the present case, Medicaid admitted that it did not have a written assignment of rights.[5]Â  In addition, there is no evidence in the record that Medicaid informed the recipients of the consequences of receiving treatment covered by Medicaid.Â Â  In fact, at the rehearing before this Court, counsel for Medicaid confirmed that there was no evidence that a written assignment had been made or that the recipients had otherwise been informed of the law.Â  Due to the lack of evidence that a valid assignment, whether actual or constructive, was obtained, we hold that Medicaid did not have an immediate right to the proceeds.Â  Therefore, the trial judgeâ€™s decision to place the proceeds in the trusts before reimbursing Medicaid was proper.Â  \r\nUnder the terms of a Special Needs Trust, however, Medicaid is entitled to receive any funds remaining in the trusts upon the death of Justin and Nikkia. See 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1396(p)(d)(4)(A) (2000) (providing that â€œthe State will receive all amounts remaining in the trust upon the death of [an individual under age 65 who is disabled] up to an amount equal to the total medical assistance paid on behalf of the individual under [Medicaid]â€).Â  Therefore, the trial judge properly found that Medicaid had a right to the proceeds remaining in the trusts upon the childrenâ€™s death.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the absence of an enforceable assignment of rights, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s decision to place the insurance proceeds into Special Needs Trusts before reimbursing Medicaid.Â  Medicaid is, however, entitled to receive any funds remaining in the trusts upon the childrenâ€™s death.Â  Therefore, we affirm the trial judgeâ€™s decision in result.\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  As I understand Medicaid, a prerequisite to enrollment in the program is the assignment of third party medical benefits.Â  In the case of minors such as Justin and Nikkia, the assignment is to be made by the individual with the legal authority to execute such an assignment on the minorâ€™s behalf.Â  I can find no statutory requirement that the assignment be written, as the majority suggests is necessary.Â  Further, given that the assignment issue was not litigated below, it is not surprising that the record contains no evidence concerning compliance. I therefore respectfully dissent from the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm at this juncture, and would remand to allow this issue to be explored.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] Justin suffered a closed-head injury, which resulted in major brain damage.Â  He is confined to a wheelchair.Â  Nikkia suffered a spinal injury and will never walk again.\r\n[2] Although Insurer offered to pay the proceeds, Insurer specifically denied liability throughout the complaint.Â  \r\n[3] A Special Needs Trust is a type of trust permitted under federal law pursuant to 42 U.S.C. 1396p(d)(4)(A) (2000).\r\n[4] No issue was raised regarding the proceeds given to the other three children.\r\n[5] We do not, as the dissent suggests, hold that an assignment of rights must be in writing.Â  We merely note that there is no evidence in the record that Medicaid obtained a written assignment.Â  At oral argument before this Court, counsel for Medicaid stated that it was Medicaidâ€™s practice to obtain assignments of rights in writing, which in our view makes sense, particularly in cases such as this one, where the recipients are minors. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25977","title":"Wooten v.

Wooten, 356 S.C. 473, 589 S.E.2d 769 (Ct. App. 2003); Wooten v. Wooten, 358 S.C. 54, 594 S.E.2d 854 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  We consolidate the two appeals for review and resolution.Â  See Rule 214, SCACR.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThomas D. Wooten, Jr. (Husband) and Mona Rae Wooten (Wife) were married in 1976.Â  The couple met in Columbia while Husband was in medical residency training and moved to Johns Island in 1981, where they lived until Husband moved out of the marital home in 1999.Â  Both parties had adulterous affairs in the mid-1980s, but admitted the affairs to each other, attended counseling sessions, and reconciled.Â  Wife testified Husbandâ€™s decision to leave surprised her and she believed their marriage, while not perfect, was solid.Â Â  \r\nHusband, now age 56, is an anesthesiologist with a gross annual income of $217,000.Â  Wife, a registered nurse by training, is a county deputy coroner with a gross annual income of $47,000.Â  After moving to Johns Island, Wife stayed home for several years to care for the coupleâ€™s three young children.Â  The children were emancipated at the time of trial.Â  Wife also managed the billing of Husbandâ€™s patients to increase the familyâ€™s income.Â  Wifeâ€™s business duties ended in 1987 when Husband hired a secretary to do the billing and then later merged his practice with other anesthesiologists.\r\nThe couple and their children lived an affluent lifestyle.Â  They extensively renovated and expanded their home in the early 1980s and often entertained family and friends on weekends at the home and on their boat.Â  Husband frequently went fishing and hunting.Â  They belonged to a country club and regularly went out to dinner.Â  Husband bought and sold several boats during the marriage, including at least one capable of deep-sea fishing trips, and kept two boats valued at $30,000 as part of his division of the coupleâ€™s personal property.Â  \r\nHusband began a adulterous relationship before marital litigation commenced.Â  Husband admitted his misconduct and has not appealed the family courtâ€™s grant of a divorce to Wife on the ground of adultery.\r\nThe parties agreed on an equal division of the $1.3 million marital estate, which consisted primarily of the $675,000 marital home, which was subject to mortgages totaling $230,625; Husbandâ€™s retirement and pension accounts of $844,026; the $41,000 valuation of Husbandâ€™s interest in his medical practice; and Wifeâ€™s retirement account of $11,077.\r\nThe family court, essentially adopting a proposal offered by Wifeâ€™s accountant, divided the marital assets equally by awarding the marital home to Wife and the bulk of Husbandâ€™s retirement accounts to him.Â  Husband also was ordered to pay Wife $4,300 per month in alimony, with Wife receiving $2,867 per month after taxes.Â  The family court denied Wifeâ€™s request Husband secure the alimony award by maintaining a life insurance policy naming her as beneficiary.Â  The family court ordered Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees of $52,917.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to award the marital home to Wife in equitably distributing the marital estate?Â  \r\nII.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to award a credit card debt, incurred by Wife after marital litigation began, to Husband in equitably distributing the marital estate?Â  \r\nIII.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the family courtâ€™s decision not to require Husband to secure an alimony award to Wife with a life insurance policy naming Wife as beneficiary?Â  \r\nIV.Â  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the family courtâ€™s decision to require Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees and costs, where the Court of Appeals reversed the family courtâ€™s decision in favor of Wife on the primary issues in dispute?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, an appellate court has the authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d 157 (1992); Owens v. Owens, 320 S.C. 543, 466 S.E.2d 373 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  This broad scope of review does not, however, require the appellate court to disregard the findings of the family court.Â  Stevenson v. Stevenson, 276 S.C. 475, 279 S.E.2d 616 (1981).Â  Neither is the appellate court required to ignore the fact that the family court, who saw and heard the witnesses, was in a better position to evaluate their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.Â  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 280 S.E.2d 541 (1981).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  MARITAL HOME \r\nTestimony during the five-day trial focused primarily on the equitable division of the two major marital assets - the marital home and the retirement accounts.Â  Husband sought to have the assets divided equally by awarding half the retirement accounts to each, selling the house to take full advantage of the $500,000 capital gains tax exclusion for married spouses, and dividing the sale proceeds so that each party could purchase a smaller house with no mortgage.\r\nHusband and his accountant testified that, if Wife were awarded the home, Husband would suffer tax and withdrawal penalties equaling fifty-one percent of any funds he withdrew if required to liquidate his retirement accounts to satisfy the equitable division award and make a substantial down-payment on a home for himself.Â  Wife sought to keep the house as part of her division of the marital estate.Â  \r\nThe family court divided the primary marital property and debts in a manner which gave each party a net total of $664,078.Â  Husband received assets of $590,087 in IRA retirement funds, $116,543 in his medical practiceâ€™s retirement pension, the $41,000 value of his medical practice, and debt of $71,230 (representing 75 percent of the home equity line) and a credit card debt of $12,322.Â  Wife received assets of the $675,000 marital home, $137,395 from Husbandâ€™s IRA account, her retirement fund of $11,077, and debts of $135,651 for the first mortgage on the marital home and $23,743 (representing 25 percent of the home equity line).[1]\r\nThe family court did not consider Husbandâ€™s fault in awarding the home to Wife, but primarily considered the length of the marriage, Wifeâ€™s needs, the partiesâ€™ lifestyle during the marriage, and Husbandâ€™s ability to pay.Â  The family court did not award the home as an incident of support, but as an asset to be equitably divided, and did not consider the custody or interests of the children because they were emancipated.Â  Further, the family court did not consider speculative tax ramifications related to either the potential sale of the home by Wife or potential early withdrawals from retirement accounts by Husband.\r\nA divided Court of Appeals reversed, with the majority finding the family court abused its discretion by performing an inequitable â€œin-kindâ€ distribution of dissimilar assets and by failing to consider the tax consequences of Husbandâ€™s necessary liquidation of his retirement accounts.Â Â Â  Wooten, 358 S.C. at 60-64, 594 S.E.2d at 858-60.\r\nWife argues the Court of Appealsâ€™ majority erred in reversing the family courtâ€™s decision to award the marital home to her in equitably distributing the marital estate by incorrectly applying the standards for awarding a house as an incident of support.Â  Furthermore, the Court of Appeals erred in concluding the division was inequitable or likely to result in tax consequences by forcing Husband to liquidate his retirement accounts to comply with the order.Â  Husband contends the family court erred in failing to consider the tax consequences of its order.Â Â Â  \r\nThe apportionment of marital property is within the discretion of the family court and will not be disturbed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  Morris v. Morris, 295 S.C. 37, 39, 367 S.E.2d 24, 24 (1988).Â  In order to effect an equitable apportionment, the family court may require the sale of marital property and a division of the proceeds.Â  Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 360, 384 S.E.2d 741, 745 (1989).Â  However, the court should first try to make an â€œin-kindâ€ distribution of the marital assets, i.e., award a share of each type of asset to each spouse.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe family court may grant a spouse title to the marital home as part of the equitable distribution because it is not feasible to make an in-kind distribution of the home.Â  Donahue, 299 S.C. at 360, 384 S.E.2d at 745; Brown v. Brown, 279 S.C. 116, 302 S.E.2d 860 (1983) (upholding family courtâ€™s decision to award marital home to wife as part of equitable distribution of marital property), overruled on other grounds by Tiffault v. Tiffault, 303 S.C. 391, 401 S.E.2d 157 (1991); Josey v. Josey, 291 S.C. 26, 32, 351 S.E.2d 891, 895 (Ct. App. 1986) (reversing family courtâ€™s decision not to award marital home to wife as part of equitable distribution because family court believed she could not afford it, where wife â€œlove[d] the home dearly,â€ husband did not object to award of house to wife so long as it did not result in increased alimony, and such a disposition under then-existing tax laws would minimize possibility of husband paying capital gains taxes).Â  \r\nThe family court should give appropriate weight to the fifteen statutory factors in making an equitable distribution of marital property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2004).Â  Such factors include the income and earning potential of each spouse, the opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets, the physical and emotional health of each spouse, and the desirability to award the family home as part of the equitable distribution.Â  Section 20-7-472(4), (5) and (10).\r\nThe family court is required to consider the tax consequences to each party resulting from equitable apportionment.Â  Section 20-7-472(11).Â  However, if the apportionment order does not contemplate the liquidation or sale of an asset, then it is an abuse of discretion for the court to consider the tax consequences from a speculative sale or liquidation.Â  Bowers v. Bowers, 349 S.C. 85, 97-98, 561 S.E.2d 610, 617 (Ct. App. 2002); Ellerbe v. Ellerbe, 323 S.C. 283, 289, 473 S.E.2d 881, 884 (Ct. App. 1996); Graham v. Graham, 301 S.C. 128, 131, 390 S.E.2d 469, 471 (Ct. App. 1990).\r\nHusband relies in part on law relating to the award of exclusive use and possession of the marital home for a defined term as an incident of support.Â  E.g., Whitfield v. Hanks, 278 S.C. 165, 293 S.E.2d 314 (1982) (discussing possession of residence for specified period as incident of support); Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, 541-42, 389 S.E.2d 165, 168 (Ct. App. 1990) (explaining family court, when awarding marital home for reasonable period as incident of support, must balance competing interests between claim of dependent spouse or children against claim of nonoccupying spouse for his share of marital home; court should consider factors such as need for adequate shelter for minors, suitable housing for handicapped or infirm spouse, and inability of occupying spouse to otherwise obtain adequate housing); Johnson v. Johnson, 285 S.C. 308, 311, 329 S.E.2d 443, 445 (Ct. App. 1985) (same); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472(10) (Supp. 2004). \r\nThe incident-of-support cases are largely irrelevant in deciding whether the marital home should be awarded to one spouse in the equitable division of marital property.Â  A decision on whether to award the marital home to one spouse for a defined period as an incident of support and a decision on whether to award the home permanently to one spouse in equitable distribution require different analyses.Â  While it is proper for the family court to consider support-related facts in both settings, the lack of a support-related rationale should not necessarily prevent or reduce the likelihood of an award of the marital home to one spouse in equitable distribution. \r\nInstead, as we have done in deciding these appeals, the family court should focus on a fair distribution of the entire marital estate.Â  The family court should consider not only financial factors (including tax consequences, if any) affecting the distribution of the marital home, but also the physical and emotional well-being of each spouse as it relates to the marital home.Â  In other words, decisions relating to the equitable distribution of the marital home should not always be based solely or primarily on a cold, rational calculation of dollars and cents.Â  The family court is free to consider other, less tangible factors asserted by a spouse, weighing those in concert with the financial impact on the parties.\r\nApplying the above principles, we reverse the Court of Appeals and affirm the family courtâ€™s award of the marital home to Wife for four reasons.\r\nFirst, the Court of Appealsâ€™ majority erred in concluding the family court was required to consider the tax consequences to Husband.Â  The order neither contemplates nor requires, either explicitly or implicitly, the sale of the marital home by Wife or the liquidation of retirement funds by Husband.Â  Such a conclusion is reached only by accepting at face value Husbandâ€™s assertions he cannot afford to comply with the order and buy himself a home without liquidating his retirement accounts.Â  \r\nSecond, the record shows Husbandâ€™s income and earning potential far exceed Wifeâ€™s; therefore, Husbandâ€™s ability to purchase a home and acquire other capital assets in the future is also greater than Wifeâ€™s.\r\nThird, Wifeâ€™s emotional attachment to the family home and her wish to keep it in the family in order for future generations to enjoy is a factor to be considered in awarding the home to her, as that likely will benefit her emotional and physical health.Â  In contrast, Husband viewed the disposition of the marital home primarily in financial terms.\r\nFourth, the record reveals Husbandâ€™s claims of financial ruin are unfounded.Â  Husbandâ€™s gross monthly income exceeds $18,000, with a net spendable income exceeding $12,000 per month.Â  We agree with the family court that, accepting Husbandâ€™s expenses as enumerated in his financial declaration, including the alimony payment, home equity line payment, and a $2,000 mortgage payment to buy his own house, Husbandâ€™s needs can be met from his income.Â  Moreover, Husbandâ€™s earning capacity is more than four times that of Wifeâ€™s, with the potential to be even higher.Â  \r\nWe are not persuaded by Husbandâ€™s implication a total debt of $236,469 resulting from the order is immediately due and payable and thus requires liquidation of his retirement funds.Â  The home equity line which was allocated to Husband includes the $30,000 borrowed for attorneyâ€™s fees during litigation.Â  The home equity line does not have to be paid in full immediately and was accounted for by the family court as one of Husbandâ€™s monthly expenses.Â  Whether Husbandâ€™s own attorneyâ€™s fees are immediately payable is unknown.Â  The only debt which is immediately due and payable is $52,917 for Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\nThe family court properly effected an equitable division of the marital estate and did not abuse its discretion in awarding the marital home to Wife.Â  Additionally, the Court of Appeals remanded the alimony issue because it was closely related to the award of the marital home and recalculation of various expenses would be necessary if Wife did not remain in the marital home.Â  See Wooten, 358 S.C. at 64, 594 S.E.2d at 860.Â  Given our decision upholding the family courtâ€™s award of the marital home to Wife, further consideration of the amount of alimony award is unnecessary.\r\nII.Â  CREDIT CARD DEBT\r\nHusband vacated the marital home in February 1999.Â  He continued paying the two mortgages and voluntarily gave money to Wife to pay household and child-related expenses until filing an action for separate support and maintenance in June 1999.Â  From June to December 1999, when the pendente lite order required Husband to pay temporary alimony, Husband continued paying the mortgages but did not provide any additional funds to Wife.Â  \r\nWife incurred a credit card debt of $12,322 from June to December 1999.Â  Wife testified the expenditures were for groceries, dining out, veterinary bills, medications, gasoline, Christmas gifts, and tuition for their son.Â  The record does not contain credit card bills listing the expenses.\r\nThe family court treated the credit card debt as marital debt and apportioned it entirely to Husband.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed, holding the credit card debt was not presumed to be a marital debt because it was incurred after the date of commencement of marital litigation.Â  Wife failed to carry her burden of proving the debt was incurred for the benefit of the marriage; therefore, the family court erred in apportioning it as a marital debt.Â  Wooten, 358 S.C. at 59-60, 594 S.E.2d at 857-58. \r\nâ€œMarital propertyâ€ is defined as â€œall real and personal property which has been acquired by the parties during the marriage and which is owned as of the date of filing or commencement of marital litigation. . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-473 (Supp. 2004).Â  For purposes of equitable distribution, a â€œmarital debtâ€ is a debt incurred for the joint benefit of the parties regardless of whether the parties are legally liable or whether one party is individually liable.Â  Hardy v. Hardy, 311 S.C. 433, 436-37, 429 S.E.2d 811, 813 (Ct. App. 1993).\r\nMarital debt, like marital property, must be specifically identified and apportioned in equitable distribution.Â  Smith v. Smith, 327 S.C. 448, 457, 486 S.E.2d 516, 520 (Ct. App. 1997).Â  In equitably dividing the marital estate, the family court must consider â€œliens and any other encumbrances upon the marital property, which themselves must be equitably divided, or upon the separate property of either of the parties, and any other existing debts incurred by the parties or either of them during the course of the marriage.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (13) (Supp. 2004).Â  This statute creates a rebuttable presumption that a debt of either spouse incurred prior to the beginning of marital litigation is a marital debt and must be factored in the totality of equitable apportionment.Â  Hickum v. Hickum, 320 S.C. 97, 102, 463 S.E.2d 321, 324 (Ct. App. 1995); Hardy, 311 S.C. at 436-37, 429 S.E.2d at 813-14.Â  When the debt is incurred before marital litigation begins, the burden of proving a debt is nonmarital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion.Â  Hickum, 320 S.C. at 103, 463 S.E.2d at 324.\r\nWhen a debt is incurred after the commencement of litigation but before the final divorce decree, the family court may equitably apportion it as a marital debt when it is shown the debt was incurred for marital purposes, i.e., for the joint benefit of both parties during the marriage.Â  Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 104-05, 545 S.E.2d 531, 540 (Ct. App. 2001) (remanding for family court to determine whether payments or debts incurred by husband after filing of litigation were marital debts); Peirson v. Calhoun, 308 S.C. 246, 252-53, 417 S.E.2d 604, 607-08 (Ct. App. 1992) (finding that a second mortgage and other loans obtained by husband post-separation were marital debts).Â  When a debt is incurred after marital litigation begins, the burden of proving the debt is marital rests upon the party who makes such an assertion. \r\nWife argues the Court of Appeals erred because it failed to recognize a marital debt may arise after marital litigation is filed.Â  Wife asserts the credit card debt was incurred for the benefit of both parties during the marriage and should be apportioned to Husband.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded Wife incurred the credit card debt after the marital litigation was filed and the record reveals the debt was not incurred for the joint benefit of the parties during the marriage.Â  Wife failed to carry her burden of proving the credit card debt was a marital debt.[2]\r\nIII.Â  LIFE INSURANCE TO SECURE AWARD OF ALIMONY\r\nHusband maintained a $1 million life insurance policy during the marriage, paying an annual premium of $2,220.Â  Although the beneficiary named in the policy was a trust, it was maintained for the benefit of Wife and the children.Â  The family court rejected Wifeâ€™s request Husband be ordered to maintain the policy, with Wife as the beneficiary, as security for Wifeâ€™s alimony award.Â  The family court found no â€œcompelling reasonâ€ for such a requirement, reasoning Wife was employed in a relatively secure employment with a substantial income and benefits, there were no minor children, and neither Husband nor Wife suffered from any major or debilitating health problems. \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed, citing its own precedent and holding the family court correctly ruled that a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ must exist to warrant the maintenance of life insurance by the payor spouse to secure an alimony award.Â  The Court of Appeals explained it has required a showing of special circumstances or a compelling reason before requiring the purchase or maintenance of life insurance as security for alimony or child support obligations.Â  Neither the alimony nor child support statutes set forth the requirement of special circumstances or compelling reason, but the Court of Appeals, adhering to its precedent, found the requirement exists in both statutes.Â  Wooten, 356 S.C. at 476-77, 589 S.E.2d at 770-71.Â  The Court of Appeals examined the record in light of the statutory factors and upheld the family courtâ€™s denial of Wifeâ€™s request for life insurance to secure the alimony award.Â  Id. at 478, 589 S.E.2d at 771-72.Â Â  \r\nWife, relying primarily on Gilfillin v. Gilfillin, 344 S.C. 407, 544 S.E.2d 829 (2001), argues the Court of Appeals erred by grafting the â€œcompelling reasonâ€ requirement onto a statute which simply requires an analysis and balancing of statutory factors in deciding whether to secure an alimony award with life insurance.Â  Wife further contends the Court of Appeals erred in upholding the family courtâ€™s ruling after examining the record in light of the statutory factors. \r\nIt is a settled proposition of law that a former wife who is entitled to alimony has an insurable interest in her former husbandâ€™s life.Â  Shealy v. Shealy, 280 S.C. 494, 497, 313 S.E.2d 48, 50 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  The parties in a divorce proceeding may agree, in a private agreement subsequently merged into the courtâ€™s order, that a payor spouse shall maintain life insurance to secure an award of alimony or child support.Â  Mitchell v. Mitchell, 283 S.C. 87, 93, 320 S.E.2d 706, 710 (1984); Carnie v. Carnie, 252 S.C. 471, 473, 167 S.E.2d 297, 298 (1969); Lane v. Williamson, 307 S.C. 230, 414 S.E.2d 177 (Ct. App. 1992).\r\nAt common law, the obligation to pay periodic alimony ended at death unless a spouse binds his or her estate for the payment of alimony by agreement.Â  McCune v. McCune, 284 S.C. 452, 455, 327 S.E.2d 340, 341 (1985).Â  This Court first approved the use of life insurance as security for a support award in Fender v. Fender, 256 S.C. 399, 182 S.E.2d 755 (1971).Â  In that case, we affirmed a divorce decree requiring the husband to maintain a life insurance policy to assure funds would be available for the college education of his minor child.Â  We relied on the grant of broad powers contained in the child support statute,[3] finding the only limits are that court-ordered â€œprovisions shall be just and equitable, considered in light of the circumstances of the parties, the nature of the case, and the best interests of the children.â€Â  Fender, 256 S.C. at 409, 182 S.E.2d at 759; see also Jackson v. Jackson, 264 S.C. 599, 602-03, 216 S.E.2d 530, 531 (1975) (affirming divorce decree which did not require maintenance of life insurance by husband to secure college education of his children because circumstances showed it was not necessary); Brown v. Brown, 270 S.C. 370, 242 S.E.2d 422 (1978) (affirming divorce decree requiring maintenance of life insurance by husband to secure college education of child).\r\nIn 1985, the Court of Appeals, relying on Fender and the child support statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-160 (1985), held the family court has the authority to require a payor spouse to maintain a life insurance policy naming his child as beneficiary, provided the requirement is â€œbased on justice, equity, and compelling reasons for this necessity.â€Â  Ivey v. Ivey, 286 S.C. 315, 318, 334 S.E.2d 123, 125 (Ct. App. 1985) (finding no compelling reason requiring husband to secure child support with life insurance); see also Sutton v. Sutton, 291 S.C. 401, 353 S.E.2d 884 (Ct. App. 1987) (affirming divorce decree requiring husband to maintain life insurance to secure child support).\r\nIn Hardin v. Hardin, 294 S.C. 402, 365 S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 1987), the Court of Appeals in a case of first impression concluded the family court required either specific statutory authority or a finding of special circumstances before it could require a payor spouse to purchase life insurance to secure the payment of periodic alimony beyond the payor spouseâ€™s death.Â  The family court lacked either form of authority in this instance and, thus, erred in requiring husband to purchase a policy.Â  Id. at 404, 365 S.E.2d at 35-36.\r\nThe Court of Appeals in subsequent cases imposed the requirement of a showing of special circumstances or a compelling reason before a payor spouse could be ordered to secure the payment of alimony or child support with a life insurance policy.Â  Such special circumstances or compelling reasons include major health problems of the payor spouse.Â  Hickman v. Hickman, 294 S.C. 486, 488, 366 S.E.2d 21, 23 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding no special circumstances requiring husband to secure periodic alimony award with life insurance); Shambley v. Shambley, 296 S.C. 405, 408, 373 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1988) (finding no compelling reason requiring husband to secure childâ€™s future support and education expenses with life insurance); Ferguson v. Ferguson, 300 S.C. 1, 5, 386 S.E.2d 267, 269 (Ct. App. 1989) (finding no special circumstances requiring husband to secure periodic alimony award with life insurance); Harlan v. Harlan, 300 S.C. 537, 540, 389 S.E.2d 165, 167 (Ct. App. 1990) (finding no compelling reason requiring husband to secure child support with life insurance).\r\nIn 1990, the Legislature amended S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-130 (Supp. 2004) to codify the common law rule that periodic alimony terminates at death, but provided an exception to this rule when alimony is secured pursuant to subsection 20-3-130(D).Â  Gilfillin, 344 S.C. at 412, 544 S.E.2d at 831.\r\nSection 20-3-130 now provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n(B)Â  Alimony and separate maintenance and support awards may be granted pendente lite and permanently in such amounts and for periods of time subject to conditions as the court considers just including, but not limited to:\r\n  \r\n(1)Â  Periodic alimony to be paid but terminating on the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse or upon the death of either spouse (except as secured in subsection (D)) and terminable and modifiable based upon changed circumstances occurring in the future. . . . \r\n  \r\n(D)Â  In making an award of alimony or separate maintenance and support, the court may make provision for security for the payment of the support including, but not limited to, requiring the posting of money, property, and bonds and may require a spouse, with due consideration of the cost of premiums, insurance plans carried by the parties during marriage, insurability of the payor spouse, the probable economic condition of the supported spouse upon the death of the payor spouse, and any other factors the court may deem relevant, to carry and maintain life insurance so as to assure support of a spouse beyond the death of the payor spouse.\r\n\r\nIn Gilfillin, we stated subsection (D) must be strictly construed because it is in derogation of the common law rule that periodic alimony terminates at the death of the payor spouse.Â  We held that life insurance is the only permitted means of securing alimony beyond the life of the payor spouse and struck down the family courtâ€™s creation of an alimony trust.Â  We stated that â€œ[w]ith the enactment of subsection 20-3-130(D), the Legislature provided that life insurance could be used to secure such payment whenever the family court made factual findings concerning the five factors favored requiring such insurance.â€Â  Gilfillin, 344 S.C. at 414, 544 S.E.2d at 832.Â  Further, the â€œuse of life insurance is restricted in subsection (D) for use only after the family court makes comprehensive review of five distinct issues. . . .â€Â  Id.Â  We noted several of the pre-1990 Court of Appealsâ€™ cases listed above which require a finding of â€œspecial circumstances,â€ but did not explicitly endorse or reject such a requirement.[4]\r\nSince 1990, the Court of Appeals has continued to require a showing of â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ or a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ before the family court may order the purchase or maintenance of life insurance as security for an alimony or child support obligation.Â  Wooten, 356 S.C. at 477, 589 S.E.2d at 771 (â€œprecedent of this court, both before and after 1990, has consistently applied the â€˜compelling reasonâ€™ standard to secure the payment of alimony and child supportâ€); Mallett v. Mallett, 323 S.C. 141, 150, 473 S.E.2d 804, 810 (Ct. App. 1996) (finding no compelling reason requiring husband to secure child support award with life insurance); McElveen v. McElveen, 332 S.C. 583, 603-04, 506 S.E.2d 1, 11-12 (Ct. App. 1998) (finding no compelling reason requiring husband to secure child support and alimony payments with life insurance); Allen v. Allen, 347 S.C. 177, 186-87, 554 S.E.2d 421, 426 (Ct. App. 2001) (remanding for family court to reconsider decision requiring husband to secure alimony award with life insurance by making a comprehensive review of statutory factors, and mentioning precedent requiring a showing of special circumstances for such security); Roberson v. Roberson, 359 S.C. 384, 391-92, 597 S.E.2d 840, 844 (Ct. App. 2004) (upholding ruling which required husband to secure alimony award with life insurance where record revealed family court properly considered statutory factors; Court of Appeals cited Wooten, 356 S.C. 473, 589 S.E.2d 769, which requires showing of special circumstances or compelling reason).Â  See also John J. Michalik, Divorce:Â  Provision in Decree That One Party Obtain or Maintain Life Insurance for Benefit of Other Party or Child, 59 A.L.R.3d 9 (1974).\r\nWe conclude, in clarifying Gilfillin, the family court must conduct a comprehensive review of the statutory factors to determine whether special circumstances exist which require the purchase or maintenance of a life insurance policy to secure an alimony award.Â  Although the term â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ is not found in the statute, the Legislature was aware of prior case law on this issue when it enacted subsection 20-3-130(D), which indicates the Legislature anticipated the provision would be applied in light of existing precedent.Â  See State v. Bridgers, 329 S.C. 11, 14, 495 S.E.2d 196, 197 (1997) (Legislature is presumed to be aware of common law when enacting statutes and using terms that have a well-recognized meaning in the law); Berkebile v. Outen, 311 S.C. 50, 53, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993) (basic presumption exists that the Legislature has knowledge of previous legislation when later statutes are passed on a related subject).Â  \r\nHowever, we disapprove of the requirement of a showing of a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ before life insurance may be ordered to secure an alimony award.Â  While the difference between â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ and a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ may appear semantic, use of the latter term arguably places a higher burden on the spouse requesting security.Â  We also reject the conclusion a â€œcourt-mandated requirement for life insurance to secure the alimony payments is the exception, not the rule.â€Â  Wooten, 356 S.C. at 478, 589 S.E.2d at 772.\r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ requirement of a â€œcompelling reason,â€ combined with its view that court-mandated life insurance is the exception, not the rule, effectively established a presumption against ordering life insurance to secure an alimony award.Â  The Legislature did not intend to establish a presumption in favor of or against such security under the statute.Â  Instead, as we indicated in Gilfillin, the statute contemplates a comprehensive review of the factors set out in subsection 20-3-130(D).Â  If that review reveals the existence of special circumstances in which the supported spouse establishes the need for the security and the payor spouse is capable of providing it, the family court may order the award be secured with life insurance.\r\nIn making such a determination, the analysis should begin with the supported spouseâ€™s need for such security, i.e., consideration of the supported spouseâ€™s probable economic condition in the event of the payor spouseâ€™s death.Â  The family court should consider the supported spouseâ€™s age, health, income earning ability, and accumulated assets.Â  If a need for security is found, the family court should next consider the payor spouseâ€™s ability to secure the award with life insurance, i.e., the payor spouseâ€™s age, health, income earning ability, accumulated assets, insurability, cost of premiums, and insurance plans carried by the parties during the marriage.Â  The cost of premiums could be assigned solely to the payor spouse, solely to the payee spouse, or shared between them.[5]\r\nIn the instant case, Wife is in good health, has a stable income and substantial assets with which she may support herself should Husband predecease her and alimony payments cease.Â  Husband can afford the premiums, carried the policy during the marriage, and apparently is in good health and insurable.Â  We do not find the existence of special circumstances giving rise to a need for security in this case.Â  We affirm the family court and Court of Appealsâ€™ application of the statutory factors to find Husband was not required to purchase life insurance to secure Wifeâ€™s alimony award.[6]\r\nIV.Â  WIFEâ€™S ATTORNEYâ€™S FEES\r\nHusband argues he should not be required to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneysâ€™ fees because the Court of Appeals reversed the family courtâ€™s ruling in favor of Wife on the main issues in dispute, the distribution of the marital home and the credit card debt.Â  Our resolution of these appeals largely nullifies Husbandâ€™s argument.Â  We affirm.Â  See Glasscock v. Glasscock, 304 S.C. 158, 403 S.E.2d 313 (1991) (listing factors to consider in awarding attorneyâ€™s fees, including beneficial results obtained).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the Court of Appeals and award the marital home to Wife in the equitable division of the marital estate.Â  We affirm the Court of Appeals and conclude Wifeâ€™s credit card debt was not a marital debt.Â  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ requirement the family court find a â€œcompelling reasonâ€ before requiring a spouse to secure an alimony award with life insurance, but affirm the conclusion Husband is not required to secure Wifeâ€™s alimony award with life insurance.Â  We affirm the Court of Appeals and require Husband to pay Wifeâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the amount of $52,917.Â  The designation of the credit card debt as nonmarital increases the size of the marital estate by $12,322 and affects the equitable distribution of Husbandâ€™s IRA funds.Â  We remand this case to the family court for reconsideration of that issue in a manner consistent with this opinion.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.Â  \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Recognizing the potential difficulty of making joint payments, the family court ordered that Wifeâ€™s portion of the home equity line ($23,743) be deducted from Wifeâ€™s portion of the retirement accounts, and Husband would make all payments on that debt.Â  Thus, Wife actually received $113,652 from Husbandâ€™s IRA funds while Husband kept $613,830 in those funds. \r\n[2]Â  Like the Court of Appeals, we express no opinion on whether the family court could have required Husband to reimburse Wife for some or all of these charges as an incident of support.Â  Wooten, 358 S.C. at 60 n.2, 594 S.E.2d at 858 n.2. \r\n[3]Â  The language of the present child support statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-3-160 (1985), is identical to Â§ 20-115 of the 1962 Code interpreted in Fender.\r\n[4]Â  Justice Moore, dissenting, appeared to endorse the requirement of â€œspecial circumstancesâ€ to secure an alimony award.Â  See Gilfillin, 344 S.C. at 416 n.1, 544 S.E.2d at 833 n.1 (Hardin and cases following it â€œdo not prohibit ordering life insurance to secure alimony if there are special circumstances or statutory authorityâ€).\r\n[5]Â  Alimony payments terminate â€œon the remarriage or continued cohabitation of the supported spouse or upon the death of either spouseâ€ and are â€œterminable and modifiable based upon changed circumstances occurring in the future.â€Â  Section 20-3-130(B)(1).Â  A requirement that an alimony award be secured with life insurance is similarly terminable and modifiable.\r\n[6]Â  Some of the cited Court of Appealsâ€™ opinions addressed the issue of securing a child support obligation with life insurance.Â  Our decision today addresses only the securing of an alimony award with life insurance as provided by statute.Â  We express no opinion on the analysis established by the Court of Appeals in the securing of a child support award. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25992","title":"In the Matter of Henry E.

Pleasant, for appellant.\r\nSteven L. Smith and Wm. Mark Koontz, of Smith, Collins &amp; Newton, P.A., of North Charleston, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  After a final judgment in favor of respondent (Builder) in its mechanicâ€™s lien action against petitioner (Homeowner), the master-in-equity awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to Builder as the prevailing party.Â  After certifying this case from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, we affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn October 30, 1998, Builder brought an action against Homeowner pursuant to the Mechanicâ€™s Lien Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (1991).Â  Builder asserted he was owed $74,500 for work performed in the construction of a home for Homeowner.Â  Homeowner counterclaimed alleging causes of action for breach of contract, negligent construction, and breach of warranty.Â  Homeownerâ€™s counterclaims sought an unspecified amount in actual and punitive damages.\r\nAfter hearing the case, the master found Builder was entitled to $65,048 for breach of contract and that Homeowner established he was entitled to $36,907.26 on his counterclaim.Â  The final result was judgment for Builder in the amount of $28,140.76.Â  Attorneyâ€™s fees and costs were not awarded to either party.Â  Homeowner and Builder then filed motions for an award of attorneyâ€™s fees on the ground that each was the prevailing party under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10(b) (providing method for award of attorneyâ€™s fees for prevailing party in action to foreclose mechanicâ€™s lien).[1]\r\nThe master filed an amended order.Â  In this order, the award to Homeowner was increased to $44,430.86 and final judgment for Builder was entered in the amount of $20,617.14.Â  Further, the master summarily found the amended version of Â§ 29-5-10, although enacted after the institution of Builderâ€™s action, applied and awarded attorneyâ€™s fees to Builder as the prevailing party.Â  The amount of attorneyâ€™s fees was $29,033.75.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by finding Builder to be the prevailing party who was entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees pursuant to the amended version of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (Supp. 2003)?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nHomeowner contends the pre-1999 version of Â§ 29-5-10 should apply when determining who is the prevailing party for the purpose of awarding attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Builder contends the amended version of Â§ 29-5-10 should be applied retroactively.\r\nThe prior version of the statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (a) (1991), establishes that the prevailing party to an action to foreclose a mechanicâ€™s lien shall be awarded attorneyâ€™s fees and costs up to the amount of the actual lien awarded.Â  Subsection (b) of the statute prescribes the method used for determining who is the prevailing party, and states, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nIf the plaintiff makes no written offer of settlement, the amount prayed for in his complaint is considered to be his final offer of settlement for purposes of this section.\r\nIf the defendant makes no written offer of settlement, his offer of settlement is considered to be zero.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (b).\r\nIn 1997, this Court specifically interpreted the 1991 statute and held the following:\r\n\r\nwhen neither party makes a written offer of settlement, the plaintiffâ€™s offer is considered the amount prayed for in its complaint and the defendantâ€™s offer is considered to be zero.Â  Whether fairly or unfairly, the statute does not make provision for considering counterclaims as negative offers of settlement.Â  \r\n\r\nBrasington Tile Co., Inc. v. Worley, 327 S.C. 280, 289, 491 S.E.2d 244, 248 (1997) (emphasis in original).Â  \r\nIn response to the Brasington decision, the legislature amended the statute, effective June 11, 1999â€”nearly eight months after the underlying lawsuit was filed.Â  The amended version provides, in pertinent part, the following:Â  \r\n\r\nIf the defendant makes no written offer of settlement, the value of his counterclaim is considered to be his negative offer of settlement.Â  If the defendant has not asserted a counterclaim, his offer of settlement is considered to be zero.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (b) (Supp. 2003).Â  Application of the amended statute to the facts in Brasington would change the outcome of that case.Â  In other words, if the amended statute were to apply retroactively, the Brasington decision would, in effect, be overruled.Â  \r\nBecause the legislature does not have the authority to overrule a decision by this Court, the amended statute cannot apply retrospectively.Â  See Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 520 S.E.2d 142 (1999) (holding legislature lacked authority to retroactively overrule Courtâ€™s interpretation of a statute).Â  Moreover, we have found that â€œa judicial interpret[ation] of a statute is determinative of its meaning and effect, and any subsequent legislative amendment to the contrary will only be effective from the date of its enactment and cannot be applied retroactively.â€Â  Lindsay v. Natâ€™l Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 629, 207 S.E.2d 75, 78 (1974).Â  Because a prior, on-point judicial decision has been rendered, any subsequent statutory amendments apply prospectively only.Â  To decide otherwise would allow the legislature, in effect, to overrule judicial decisions in violation of the separation of powers doctrine.[2]\r\nIn the present case, the question of who is the prevailing party is controlled by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 (1991) and this Courtâ€™s interpretation of that statute in Brasington.Â  Homeowner is correct in asserting that under the prior version of the statute, he would be the prevailing party.Â  Neither party made a written offer of settlement.Â  Final judgment was entered for Builder in the amount of $20,617.14.Â  Applying the formula in the applicable statute and this Courtâ€™s interpretation of that statute in Brasington, Builderâ€™s settlement offer is the amount prayed for in the complaint, which was $74,500, and Homeownerâ€™s settlement offer is zero.Â  Zero is closer to $20,617.14 than $74,500.Â  Accordingly, Homeowner should have been deemed the prevailing party and the party entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the masterâ€™s decision finding Builder entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees as the prevailing party under amended Â§ 29-5-10.Â  Applying the former version of Â§ 29-5-10, we find Homeowner is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees as the prevailing party in the mechanicâ€™s lien action.Â  Appellantâ€™s second issue is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authority:Â \r\nSouth Carolina Natâ€™l Bank, Greenville v. Hammond, 260 S.C. 622, 198 S.E.2d 123 (1973) (as general rule, it is essential to establishment of set off that claims or debts be mutual, i.e., they must subsist or be owing, between same parties in same right or capacity, and must be of same kind or quality).Â  Therefore, the masterâ€™s decision is \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  In 1974, the Court held that the General Assembly could not, consonant with the separation of powers doctrine, enact a statute in order to overturn the result in a case we had already decided.Â  Lindsay v. Natâ€™l Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 207 S.E.2d 75 (1974).Â  In other words, the legislature cannot, by legislative enactment, overrule our interpretation of a statute.Â  Boatwright v. McElmurray, 247 S.C. 199, 146 S.E.2d 716 (1966).Â  Over the past several years, Lindsay has been construed as a limitation on the General Assemblyâ€™s authority to amend a statute, and to have that amendment apply retroactively.[3]Â  While I have joined several of these decisions, I have come to believe that this reading of Lindsay, which held only that the General Assembly could not legislatively reverse the Courtâ€™s decision, is overly broad.Â  See Rivers v. Roadway Express, 511 U.S. 298, 114 S.Ct. 1510, 128 L.Ed.2d 274 (1994)(â€œCongress, of course, has the power to amend a statute that it believes we have misconstrued.Â Â  It may even, within broad constitutional bounds, make such a change retroactive and thereby undo what it perceives to be the undesirable past consequences of a misinterpretation of its work productâ€).\r\nWhether a statutory amendment applies retroactively is ordinarily a matter of statutory construction and interpretation, not of constitutional law.Â  The General Assembly has the authority to amend statutes, and to determine whether the amended statute applies to matters occurring before its effective date.Â  The general rule is that â€œstatutory enactments are to be considered prospective rather than retroactive unless there is a specific provision in the enactment or clear legislative intent to the contrary. [citation omitted]. Â However, statutes which are remedial or procedural in nature are generally held to operate retrospectively.â€Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Rev. v. Rosemary Coin Machines, Inc., 339 S.C. 25, 528 S.E.2d 416 (2000).Â  The only constitutional limit on retroactivity in a civil context[4] derives from due process guarantees, and from S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 4, prohibiting the passage of a law that â€œhas the effect of impairing the obligation of contract or divesting vested rights of property.â€ E.g., Schumacher v. Chapin, 228 S.C. 77, 88 S.E.2d 874 (1955).\r\nThrough a series of cases citing Lindsay, we have created two different rules regarding statutory retroactivity:Â  If the Court never interpreted the prior statute, then the general rule recited above applies.Â  If, however, the Court has issued an opinion interpreting a statute, any legislative change to that statute is deemed prospective only, lest the legislature invade the province of the Court.Â  In my opinion, this â€œLindsay rule,â€ premised on the separation of powers doctrine, has in fact led to its violation.\r\nThe separation of powers doctrine prevents one branch of government from usurping the power and authority of another.Â  Knotts v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 348 S.C. 1, 558 S.E.2d 511 (2002).Â  It is not the legislatureâ€™s amendment of a statute in response to a judicial interpretation which offends the doctrine, but rather our limitation on the General Assemblyâ€™s authority to decide whether that statutory change should be given retroactive effect. Â As we held in Boatwright, â€œthe legislature has plenary power to amend statutes.â€\r\nIn my opinion, we should use this opportunity to abandon our Lindsay retroactivity jurisprudence and return to the general rules of statutory construction.Â  In this case, however, we need not decide whether the amendment to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 29-5-10 was procedural or remedial and thus should be given retroactive effect.Â  In 1883, this Court established the rule that entitlement to costs is to be determined by the statute in effect at the time the suit is decided and the costs, if any, are to be awarded.Â  Irwin v. Brooks, 19 S.C. 96 (1883).Â  I would hold that, in the absence of legislative intent to the contrary, entitlement to statutory attorneys fees should be determined pursuant to the statute in effect at the time the final judgment is entered. Id.Â  I would therefore affirm the masterâ€™s award of attorneyâ€™s fees to respondent.\r\nI therefore respectfully dissent.\r\n\r\n[1]In 1999, Â§ 29-5-10(b) was amended.Â  As will be discussed infra, Homeowner argues the former statute applies while Builder argues the amended statute applies.\r\n[2]The dissent states the Lindsay analysis should be abandoned because the legislature has plenary power to amend statutes and, as such, this Court should not limit the legislatureâ€™s authority to decide whether a statutory amendment should be given retroactive effect.Â  However, while the legislature has plenary power to amend statutes, the construction of a statute is a judicial function and responsibility.Â  See Lindsay v. Natâ€™l Old Line Ins. Co., 262 S.C. 621, 207 S.E.2d 75 (1974); Boatwright v. McElmurray, 247 S.C. 199, 146 S.E.2d 716 (1966).Â  Therefore, once this Court has construed a particular statute, the legislature cannot thereafter amend the statute to alter our construction of the statute and have the amendment apply retroactively.Â  To do so is to invade upon judicial power.Â Â  \r\n[3] See Simmons v. Greenville Hosp. Sys., 355 S.C. 581, 586 S.E.2d 569 (2003); Williamson v. South Carolina Ins. Reserve Fund, 355 S.C. 420, 586 S.E.2d 115 (2003); Dykema v. Carolina Emerg.

Myrtle Beach, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This is an appeal from an order terminating Kimberly Cochranâ€™s (Appellantâ€™s) parental rights to her child, Tyler Dane Cochran (Child).Â  Appellant appeals various aspects of the family court order, which was issued after we reversed and remanded the action concluding the South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) failed to establish the chain of custody of two drug tests.Â  South Carolina Dept. of Social Services v. Cochran, 356 S.C. 413, 589 S.E.2d 753 (2003).Â  We affirm. \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKROUND\r\n DSS temporarily removed Child from the home of Appellant and Bobby Cochran (Father) in August 1997 after Father had physically abused the child.Â  Child was returned to Appellant subject to conditions imposed by the family court judge.Â  Appellant was required to submit to drug testing, seek drug treatment, and complete parenting and marriage counseling.Â  If Appellant tested positive for drugs, Child would immediately be removed from her custody.Â  Appellant, thereafter, tested positive for cocaine, and DSS took custody of Child in November 1997.\r\nA permanency planning hearing took place on July 30, 1998.Â  The family court judge concluded DSS would retain custody of Child and could proceed to terminate the parental rights of both Appellant and Father.Â  The family court terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights based on the following grounds: 1) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2004), Appellant had failed to remedy or rehabilitate the situation which caused the initial removal of Child; 2) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(6) (Supp. 2004), Appellant had a diagnosed drug addiction, which prevented her from providing minimally acceptable care for Child; 3) pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(8) (Supp. 2004), Child had been in foster care for fifteen of the previous twenty-two months; and 4) termination was in the best interest of the child.Â  \r\nIn the first appeal, we concluded the family court erred in determining DSS had established a proper chain of custody for Appellantâ€™s blood samples used for drug testing in May and June of 2000.Â  We concluded the scope of Appellantâ€™s drug addiction was unclear because DSS did not establish a proper chain of custody for key evidence to support the allegation Appellant failed the May and June blood tests.Â  We reversed and remanded the case to the trial court with leave to open the record and receive any other evidence pertinent to a determination of whether Appellant had overcome her drug addiction and to provide DSS the opportunity to present a proper chain of custody for Appellantâ€™s blood samples.\r\nOn remand, the trial court terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights based on the following grounds: 1) Appellant failed to remedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) (Supp. 2004) and 2) Appellant has a diagnosable condition of drug addiction pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (6) (Supp. 2004) and this condition makes Appellant unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for Child.Â  In so holding, the trial court determined DSS established the chain of custody required for the May and June 2000 drug tests.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court abuse its discretion in determining DSS established the chain of custody for the May and June 2000 blood samples?\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in terminating Appellantâ€™s parental rights on the ground she had a diagnosable condition of drug addiction making her unlikely to provide minimally acceptable care for Child?\r\nIII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the trial court err in terminating Appellantâ€™s parental rights on the ground she failed to remedy the conditions which led to Childâ€™s removal? \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe family court will terminate parental rights and free a child for adoption if it finds one of the nine statutory grounds for termination has been met and that â€œtermination is in the best interest of the child.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1578 (Supp. 2004).Â  The family court judge terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights pursuant to two statutory grounds.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-1572 (2) and (6) (Supp. 2004).Â  DSS must prove these grounds by clear and convincing evidence.Â  Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745, 102 S.Ct. 1388, 71 L.Ed.2d 599 (1982); Richland County v. Earles, 300 S.C. 24, 496 S.E.2d 864 (1998).Â  When reviewing the family court decision, this Court may make its own conclusions of whether DSS proved by clear and convincing evidence that parental rights should be terminated.Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Services v. Broome, 307 S.C. 48, 413 S.E.2d 835 (1992).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe termination of the legal relationship between natural parents and a child presents one the most difficult issues this Court is called upon to decide.Â  We exercise great caution in reviewing termination proceedings and will conclude termination is proper only when the evidence clearly and convincingly mandates such a result.\r\nIn cases involving the termination of parental rights, there exist two, often competing, interests:Â  those of the parents and those of the child.Â  Parents have a fundamental interest in the care, custody, and management of their children.Â  Parental rights warrant vigilant protection under the law and due process mandates a fundamentally fair procedure when the state seeks to terminate the parent-child relationship.Â  However, a child has a fundamental interest in terminating parental rights if the parent-child relationship inhibits establishing secure, stable, and continuous relationships found in a home with proper parental care.Â  In balancing these interests, the best interest of the child is paramount to that of the parent.Â Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Social Services v. Vanderhorst, 287 S.C. 554, 340 S.E.2d 149 (1986).\r\nRecognizing the termination of parental rights to be one of most severe actions a state can take against its citizens, we turn to the issues presented in determining whether it is in the best interest of Child that all legal relations with Appellant be terminated.\r\nI.\r\n(Chain of Custody)\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred in determining DSS established a proper chain of custody with respect to the May 1, 2000 sample and the June 7, 2000 sample.\r\nDSS has the burden to establish a chain of custody for the blood samples â€œas far as practicable.â€Â  State v. Williams, 297 S.C. 290, 376 S.E.2d 773 (1989).Â  We have explained:\r\n\r\n[T]he party offering such specimen is required to establish,\r\nat least as far as practicable, a complete chain of evidence, tracing from the time the specimen is taken from the human body to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.Â  Where the substance analyzed has passed through several hands the evidence must not leave it to conjecture as to who had it and what was done with it between the taking and the analysis.\r\n\r\nBenton v. Pellum, 232 S.C. 26, 33-34, 100 S.E.2d 534, 537 (1957) (cited in Raino v. Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co., 309 S.C. 255, 258, 422 S.E.2d 98, 99-100 (1992)).\r\nThe two samples in question were tested at a North Carolina testing facility of Laboratory Corporation of America (LabCorp).Â  In the first trial, DSS presented only the telephonic deposition of Steven Ivey, an employee of LabCorp.Â  Ivey testified generally as to who would have handled the samples and how the testing of the samples would have occurred.Â  He also testified he did not handle the samples, nor did he know which employee handled them.Â  We concluded Iveyâ€™s testimony was insufficient to establish the chain of custody recognizing that while the chain of custody DSS is required to establish need not be perfect, Ivey presented no direct evidence of how those specific blood samples were processed.Â  Cochran, 356 S.C. at 419, 589 S.E.2d at 756.\r\n In the second trial, from which this appeal is taken, DSS presented additional testimony of the chain of custody for the two samples.Â  On appeal, Appellantâ€™s primary contention is DSS did not establish the chain of custody because the person who drew blood and sealed the containers did not testify, nor did the persons to whom the samples were delivered.Â  Additionally, the identity of the courier who transported the samples from the collecting site to the testing facility is unknown.Â  We conclude the absence of testimony from these persons and the unknown identity of the courier fails to render the chain of custody incomplete.\r\nAll witnesses who testified they handled and tested the blood identified their signatures on the chain of custody sheets and described their respective procedure for handling it and the testing performed.Â  The witnesses testified the samples would have each been taken from the collecting site in a sealed package to the laboratory in Research Trial Park by a LabCorp courier who made daily pick-ups and deliveries.Â  The chain of custody form and the witnesses testimony indicate the two samples were delivered to a Jackie Johnson and a Corey Sweeney, respectively.Â  Johnson and Sweeney were no longer employed by LabCorp and not available as witnesses.\r\nAccording to the May 1 Specimen Security System/Chain of Custody Request Form, Jackie Johnson received the sample from the courier on May 2, 2000.Â  Johnson signed the form which stated â€œrecâ€™d from the courier/seals intact/aliquot transferred to temporary storage.â€Â  The form was also signed by Kathy Kejales, the LabCorp phlebotomist who drew the blood, Jackie Johnson, and Appellant.Â  Kejales was no longer employed at the collection site and could not be located to testify.Â  The June 7, 2000 sample arrived at LabCorp on June 8, 2000.Â  The sample was received from the courier by Corey Sweeney.Â  The Specimen Security System/Chain of Custody Request Form was also signed by Kathy Kejales, Sweeney, andÂ  Appellant.Â  \r\nWe have consistently held complete chain of evidence must be established as far as practicable, tracing possession from the time the specimen is taken from the human body to the final custodian by whom it is analyzed.Â  State v. Carter, 344 S.C. 419, 424, 544 S.E.2d 835, 837 (2001).Â  However, we have never held the chain of custody rule requires every person associated with the procedure be available to testify or identified personally, depending on the facts of the case.Â  In this case, every person who handled the blood samples has been identified, except the courier who transported the samples from the collection site to the testing facility.\r\nThe testimony presented by DSS indicates the blood samples were secure when Kejales took the samples at the collection site. The testimony also indicates the samples arrived at the testing facility sealed and intact.Â  Additionally, each person involved in the actual testing procedure once the samples arrived at the facility, testified as to their handling of each respective sample and the chain of custody.Â  Generally, we will uphold the chain of custody if the safeguards instituted ensure the integrity of the evidence, even if every person associated with the procedure is not personally identified.[1]Â  Other courts are in accord.\r\nIn Logan v. Personnel Bd. of Jefferson County, 657 So.2d 1125 (Ala. Ct. App. 1995) the Alabama Court of Appeals upheld the chain of custody even though the courier who transported the sample from the collection site was neither named, nor identified, other than as â€œcourier.â€Â  In Logan, as in the present case, the individual collecting the sample executed the chain of custody document verifying the specimen had been received by the donor.Â  In Logan, the Director of Toxicology at Roche Biomedical Laboratories testified about the drug testing procedures.Â  He testified the sample was delivered by the labâ€™s courier and the person who received the sample indicated by her signature on the form the seals were intact and there was no sign of tampering.Â  The Alabama court stated:\r\n\r\nThe evidence need not negate the most remote possibility of substitution, alteration, or tampering with the evidence, but rather must prove to a reasonable probability that the item is the same as, and not substantially different from, the object as it existed at the beginning of the chain.Â  Id. at 1127.Â  See also Cain v. Jefferson Parish Dept. of Fleet Management, 701 So.2d 1059 (La. Ct. App. 1997) (chain of custody established although name of courier at time of pick-up and delivery was not disclosed on the form); In the Matter of Lalama, 779 A.2d 444 (N.J. Super. 2001) (even though courier failed to complete transmittal forms, the integrity of the sample was demonstrated by other compelling evidence); Lucas v. Voirol, 136 S.W.3d 477 (Ky. Ct. App. 2004) (upholding routine procedure by which correction officers place samples into locked boxed until couriers, even if not personally identified, retrieve them for delivery to the lab).\r\n\r\nSimilarly, we have held proof of chain of custody need not negate all possibility of tampering so long as the chain of possession is complete.Â  Williams, 297 S.C. at 293, 376 S.E.2d at 774.Â  For the foregoing reasons, we conclude, under the facts of this case, DSS has sustained its burden of establishing the chain of custody.\r\nII.\r\n(Diagnosable Condition of Drug Addiction)\r\nThe trial court terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights, in part, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (6) (Supp. 2004) because she has a diagnosable condition of drug addiction.Â  We have concluded DSS established the chain of custody for the May and June samples and affirmed the decision of the trial court to terminate Appellantâ€™s parental rights based on a diagnosable condition of drug addiction.Â  The scope of Appellantâ€™s drug addiction is clear because DSS established the proper chain of custody for the evidence supporting its allegation Appellant failed these two drug tests.Â  We conclude this drug evidence has now been properly authenticated and affirm.\r\nIII.\r\n(Failure to Remedy Conditions)\r\nThe family court also terminated Appellantâ€™s parental rights on grounds Appellant failed to remedy the conditions which caused the removal of Child pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572 (2). We affirm.\r\nAppellant has not remedied the conditions for removal because 1) the evidence does not indicate she has been rehabilitated and 2) Appellantâ€™s relationship with Bobby Cochran is ongoing and not in the best interest of Child.\r\nWhen asked by the Guardian Ad Litem whether she had any evidence of her current sobriety, Appellant responded she did not.Â  Appellant admitted that prior to the termination of parental rights (TPR) hearing, she had been in and out of drug treatment programs on five different occasions but had completed a session of alcohol and drug abuse counseling.Â  Appellant stated she has not attended any drug counseling sessions or treatment programs since the TPR hearing.Â  \r\nSecond, Appellant continued to live with Bobby Cochran at the time of the remand hearing.Â  Appellant admitted she had been advised by a counselor to leave Cochran because she stood a good chance of relapsing if she stayed with him.Â  There is also evidence indicating Bobby Cochran is a drug user.Â  According to a Petition for an Order of Protection Appellant filed against him in March 1994, Appellant caught Bobby â€œshooting drugsâ€ while he was â€œwith another womanâ€ in their mobile home.Â  \r\nThere is also evidence indicating Appellant abuses alcohol.Â  Although she stated she â€œnever drank alcohol,â€ this statement was refuted by Officer Brown of the Horry County Police Department.Â  Brown testified he went to the Cochran home on February 16, 2004, to respond to a domestic dispute call.Â  He testified both Appellant and Bobby Cochran â€œappeared to be intoxicated.â€Â  \r\nAppellantâ€™s relationship with Bobby Cochran is clearly detrimental to Childâ€™s best interests.Â  DSS temporarily removed Child in August 1997 after discovering Bobby Cochran had physically abused Child.Â  The couple has a history of domestic violence.Â  When Child was in their custody, Appellant pulled a knife on Bobby Cochran at Childâ€™s first birthday party at a Burger King restaurant.Â  \r\nThe marital problems continued at the time of the May 2004 hearing.Â  When asked how many times law enforcement had been summoned to her home, Appellant replied â€œmaybe once a year.â€Â  In 2003, Appellant was arrested for criminal domestic violence (CDV) against Bobby.Â  On February 16, 2004, Appellant was again arrested for\r\nCDV.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nIt is not in the best interest of Child to be returned to an environment where Appellant has failed to show she has recovered from her drug addiction and domestic violence is persistent.Â  The fundamental purpose of terminating parental rights is to provide the greatest possible protection to a child whose parents are unwilling or unable to provide adequate care for the physical, emotional, and mental needs of the child.Â  Appellant has proven unable to provide a secure, stable, and adequate environment for rearing a child.Â  We, therefore, affirm the decision to terminate Appellantâ€™s parental rights.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude DSS established the chain of custody for the two drug samples and affirm the family courtâ€™s decision to terminate Appellantâ€™s parental rights pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1572(2) and (6).\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n&nbsp; [1]  Whether the chain of custody has been established as far as practicable clearly depends on the unique factual circumstances of each case.Â  Our holding is not intended to suggest the nonsensical result that, in every case in which a courier is unidentified, the chain of custody is necessarily established.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25998","title":"Slack v.

App. 2003).Â  We affirm the Court of Appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioners (Sellers) and respondents (Buyers), each represented by real estate agents, entered into a written contract for the sale of Sellersâ€™ home for $1,208,000.Â  The sales contract includes the following provisions:\r\n\r\n14.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENCUMBRANCES AND RESTRICTIONS.Â Â  Buyer agrees to accept property subject to:Â  . . . restrictive covenants and easements of record, provided they do not materially affect present use of said property.\r\n21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ENTIRE AGREEMENT.Â Â  This written instrument expresses the entire agreement, and all promises, covenants, and warranties between the Buyer and Seller.Â  It can only be changed by a subsequent written instrument (Addendum) signed by both parties.Â  Both Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that they have not received or relied upon any statements or representations by either Broker or their agents which are not expressly stipulated herein.\r\n\r\nAfter entering into the contract, Buyers hired an attorney to represent them during the closing.Â  In conducting a title examination of the property, the title examiner informed Buyersâ€™ attorney that there was a permanent four-inch sewer easement across the property.Â  After this discovery, Buyers refused to purchase the property because, prior to entering into the written contract, Buyers had asked Sellersâ€™ real estate agent whether there were any easements on the property and the agent informed them none existed.\r\nSellers brought a breach of contract action against Buyers after they refused to purchase Sellersâ€™ home pursuant to the purchase contract.Â  Buyers brought counterclaims against Sellers alleging breach of contract, fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act\r\n(UTPA).\r\nThe trial court granted Sellersâ€™ motion to dismiss Buyersâ€™ counterclaims as to the claims for fraud, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of UTPA, and struck portions of the breach of contract claim.Â  The trial court found the alleged oral statements regarding the existence of easements on the property that allegedly occurred prior to the execution of the partiesâ€™ written contract should be stricken based on the parol evidence rule and the merger doctrine.Â  The trial courtâ€™s order did not affect the remaining portions of the breach of contract counterclaim that alleged Sellers breached the terms of the written contract.[1]Â  The trial court further found Buyers failed to exercise reasonable diligence to protect their interests and had no right to rely on the real estate agentâ€™s alleged misrepresentation as to the existence of the sewer line easement.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals err by finding Buyers did not have a duty to investigate the truthfulness of an alleged misrepresentation by Sellersâ€™ real estate agent?\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the Court of Appeals err by finding Paragraph 21 of the purchase contract to be a merger clause rather than a non-reliance clause?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nThe Court of Appeals, relying almost exclusively on its opinion in Reid v. Harbison Devâ€™t Corp., 285 S.C. 557, 330 S.E.2d 532 (Ct. App. 1985), affâ€™d in part, 289 S.C. 319, 345 S.E.2d 492 (1986), reversed the trial courtâ€™s order.Â  The Court of Appeals found that, while Buyers could have ascertained the existence of the easement through investigation of public records, their failure to do so does not preclude them from asserting a tort claim for fraud or negligent misrepresentation.Â  The court held the question of whether Buyers could reasonably rely on the statement at issue in view of the information entered upon the public record is for a jury, not the court, to determine.\r\nSellers argue the Court of Appeals erred by relying on their opinion in Reid v. Harbison Devâ€™t Corp. to find Buyers did not have a duty to investigate the public records to check the accuracy of the Sellersâ€™ agentâ€™s alleged pre-contract oral statement.\r\nIn Reid v. Harbison Devâ€™t Corp., the Reids brought an action against Harbison alleging fraud and deceit arising out of a real estate contract.Â  The Reids alleged they were told that Harbison would own and maintain an adjacent pond.Â  However, Harbison, when deeding the lot to a builder who then would deed the lot to the Reids, included a restrictive covenant reserving Harbisonâ€™s right and stating its intent to convey the pond to a homeownersâ€™ association.Â  Membership in the association was to be mandatory for purchasers of the lots.Â  A declaration, which subjected the Reidsâ€™ lot to the restrictions of a newly formed homeownerâ€™s association, was recorded the day of the Reidsâ€™ closing.\r\nDuring the closing, the Reids learned for the first time of the homeownerâ€™s association.Â  They hesitated in continuing with the closing, but Harbison and the builder assured them the association would be formed in the future and membership would be optional.Â  A year after purchasing the property, the Reids learned membership in the homeownersâ€™ association was mandatory and they were financially responsible for their share of the pondâ€™s upkeep.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found there was evidence upon which the jury could reasonably have found the Reids did not have actual knowledge of Harbisonâ€™s misrepresentations, that they were induced to refrain from discovering the true facts, and that they acted with reasonable prudence in entering into the contract and accepting the deed.Â  The court noted that, at the time the representations relied on were made, no instrument had been recorded in the public record; and that the Reids were laymen and would have required the assistance of an expert to ascertain from the public records the truth of Harbisonâ€™s representation.[2]\r\nWhile Reid is factually distinguishable from the instant case, the Court of Appeals did not err by relying on Reid and concluding there was a question of fact whether Buyers had reasonably relied on the alleged misrepresentation.Â  We note that when ruling on a motion to dismiss a counterclaim, the question is whether, in the light most favorable to the complainant, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the counterclaim states any valid claim for relief.Â  Cf. Toussaint v. Ham, 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987) (ruling on 12(b)(6) motion to dismiss must be based solely upon allegations set forth on the face of complaint and motion cannot be sustained if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom would entitle plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case).Â  The counterclaim should not be dismissed merely because the court doubts the complainant will prevail in the action.Â  Cf. Toussaint v. Ham, supra (question is whether in light most favorable to plaintiff, and with every doubt resolved in his behalf, the complaint states any valid claim for relief).\r\nThe Court of Appeals properly found a question of fact exists as to whether Buyersâ€™ reliance on the misrepresentation was reasonable although the falsity of the alleged misrepresentation could have been ascertained by examining the public records.Â  See Unlimited Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., Inc., 303 S.C. 384, 401 S.E.2d 153 (1991) (general rule is that questions concerning reliance and its reasonableness are factual questions for the jury); Florentine Corp., Inc. v. PEDA I, Inc., 287 S.C. 382, 339 S.E.2d 112 (1985) (right to rely must be determined in light of representeeâ€™s duty to use reasonable prudence and diligence under the circumstances; determination of what constitutes reasonable diligence and prudence must be made on case by case basis).Â  The sewer line easement is not easily discoverable without research by an expert such as an attorney.Â  Cf. Thomas v. Jeffcoat, 230 S.C. 126, 94 S.E.2d 240 (1956) (buyer, relying on representations by sellerâ€™s agents that lot was high in front but level, agreed to purchase the lot; court found no evidence of fraud because buyer had viewed property and failed to examine it closely as he should).Â  See Ex parte Watson, 356 S.C. 432, 589 S.E.2d 760 (2003) (examining titles and preparing title abstracts constitute practicing law and therefore such activities must be conducted or supervised by licensed attorneys).Â  See also In re Pstrak, 357 S.C. 1, 591 S.E.2d 623 (2004) (attorney given public reprimand for assisting in unauthorized practice of law where no lawyer examined title to real property which was subject of real estate transaction).Â  Further, given the speedy nature of residential real estate contracts today, it is not feasible to expect a buyer to be able to research the title of the property they are buying before entering into a contract.Â  But see Watts v. Monarch Bldrs., Inc., 272 S.C. 517, 252 S.E.2d 889 (1979) (court found no evidence of fraud where buyers did not ask attorney to review metes and bounds of property, did not have survey completed, and did not examine plat of property in public record, and instead relied on sellerâ€™s agentâ€™s representation about property lines of lot buyers were purchasing).Â  Further, in this case, as in Reid, the alleged misrepresentation by Sellersâ€™ agent may have induced Buyers to refrain from discovering the true facts regarding whether there were any easements on the property before entering into a contract.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals properly found the trial court erred by finding Buyersâ€™ reliance on agentâ€™s alleged misrepresentation was unreasonable as a matter of law.\r\nII\r\nThe trial court, when dismissing Buyersâ€™ fraud claim of action, found that, as a matter of law, Buyers did not have the right to rely on the alleged oral statement by Sellersâ€™ agent because the written contract contained an express acknowledgement that Buyers had not received or relied upon any statements or representations by Sellersâ€™ agent (Paragraph 21).Â  The Court of Appeals held the merger and disclaimer provisions in the contract, as quoted in Paragraph 21 above, did not afford any protection to Sellers against allegations of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.\r\nNeither the parol evidence rule nor a merger clause in a contract prevents one from proceeding on tort theories of negligent misrepresentation and fraud.Â  Gilliland v. Elmwood Properties, 301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990).Â  See also Allen-Parker Co. v. Lollis, 257 S.C. 266, 185 S.E.2d 739 (1971) (if writing was procured by words and with fraudulent intent of party claiming under it, then parol evidence is competent to prove facts which constitute fraud).[3]\r\nParagraph 21 of the contract, which is entitled, â€œENTIRE AGREEMENT,â€ includes the following sentence:Â  â€œBoth Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that they have not received or relied upon any statements or representations by either Broker or their agents which are not expressly stipulated herein.â€Â  (Emphasis added).Â  Sellers contend the Court of Appeals erred by finding the sentence in Paragraph 21 to be a merger clause, instead of a non-reliance clause as distinguished in Redwend Ltd. Partnership v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 581 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nIn Redwend, the Court of Appeals held the following sentence in an agreement to be an extension of the merger clause and not a non-reliance clause:Â  â€œEach party agrees that representations, promises, agreements or understandings, written or oral, not contained herein shall be of no force or effect.â€Â  The court explained that a non-reliance clause would contain the words, â€œrelyâ€ or â€œrelianceâ€ and set forth a statement that the parties could not or did not rely on the representations of the other party.\r\nAlthough the sentence in the contract between Sellers and Buyers uses the words â€œrelied upon,â€ this sentence is not a non-reliance clause as explained by the Redwend court.Â  This sentence is contained in a paragraph entitled, â€œENTIRE AGREEMENT,â€ which indicates that it is merely an extension of the merger clause.Â  The sentence is not set apart as in the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals case that the Redwend court utilized for its explanation.Â  In Rissman v. Rissman, 213 F.3d 381 (7th Cir.), cert. dismissed, 531 U.S. 987 (2000), the federal court of appeals held a written anti-reliance clause in a stock-purchase agreement precludes any claim of deceit by prior representations.Â  In Rissman, the agreement contained several non-reliance statements.[4]Â  However, in the instant case, there is only one sentence concerning reliance upon representations and this sentence is contained within the merger clause.Â  Sellersâ€™ argument regarding Redwend and non-reliance clauses is without merit because the purchase contract does not in fact contain such a clause.\r\nHowever, even if the sentence could be considered to be a non-reliance clause, we find the result would be the same because as a non-reliance clause it lacks the required specificity.Â  A general non-reliance clause, just as a merger clause, does not prevent one from proceeding on tort theories of negligent misrepresentation and fraud.Â  See, e.g., Texas Taco Cabana, L.P. v. Taco Cabana of New Mexico, 304 F. Supp. 2d 903 (W.D. Tex. 2003)(illustrating nonreliance clause in franchise agreement will bar claims to extent clause specifically identifies statements not relied on, but will not always bar claims on other issues not expressly disclaimed in agreement); Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co. v. Yanakas, 7 F.3d 319 (2d Cir. 1993) (illustrating general boilerplate nonreliance clause will not prevent fraudulent inducement suit but specific statement in contract that states party is not relying on representation as to very matter claims it was defrauded on will prevent such suit); Miles Excavating, Inc. v. Rutledge Backhoe &amp; Septic Tank Servs., Inc., 927 P.2d 517 (Kan. App. 1997) (parol evidence admissible to show fraud even where contract contains provision stating parties have not relied on any representations other than those contained in the writing).Â  See also Allen-Parker Co. v. Lollis, supra (even specific provisions or stipulations in a contract providing in effect for immunity from or nullification or waiver of preliminary or extraneous misrepresentations are generally ineffective, and do not prevent subsequent assertion of misrepresentations as basis for fraud).Â  An opposite finding â€œwould leave swindlers free to extinguish their victimsâ€™ remedies simply by sticking in a bit of boilerplate.â€Â  Whelan v. Abell, 48 F.3d 1247, 1258 (D.C. Cir. 1995).Â  A party should not be given the opportunity to free himself from an allegation of fraud by incorporating a generalized non-reliance clause into a contract.\r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly concluded the merger clause could not be used as a defense by Sellers against Buyersâ€™ tort actions of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  See Gilliland v. Elmwood Props., supra (seller should not be allowed to hide behind integration clause to avoid consequences of fraudulent or negligent misrepresentation).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals properly concluded that whether Buyersâ€™ reliance on the Sellersâ€™ agentâ€™s alleged misrepresentation was reasonable is a question of fact for the jury.Â  Further, we find the Court of Appeals properly concluded that the merger clause set out in Paragraph 21 of the purchase contract could not be used as a defense by Sellers against Buyersâ€™ tort actions of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the sales contract Buyers signed included a binding non-reliance clause.Â  Therefore, I would reverse the court of appeals and uphold the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Buyersâ€™ fraud and misrepresentation claims. The partiesâ€™ sales contract provides in part:\r\n\r\n21.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Entire Agreement.Â  This written instrument expresses the entire agreement, and all promises, covenants, and warranties between the Buyer and Seller.Â  It can only be changed by a subsequent written instrument (Addendum) signed by both parties.Â  Both Buyer and Seller hereby acknowledge that they have not received or relied upon any statements or representations by either Broker or their agents which are not expressly stipulated herein.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  In the majorityâ€™s view the above language solely constitutes a merger clause and not a non-reliance clause.Â  The majority further contends that the merger clause cannot prevent Buyers from proceeding on tort theories of negligent misrepresentation and fraud citing Gilliland v. Elmwood Properties, 301 S.C. 295, 391 S.E.2d 577 (1990).Â  In my opinion, the above bolded language constitutes a valid non-reliance clause.Â  \r\nAccording to the majority, the language would constitute a binding non-reliance clause only if it were included in another section of the sales contract.Â  In my opinion, however, the majorityâ€™s view renders this language entirely useless and disregards the partiesâ€™ original intention as indicated by the plain meaning of the contractâ€™s language.Â  Therefore, in my opinion, the majority has misconstrued the language of the contract.\r\nThe court of appeals has provided that a non-reliance clause would contain the words â€œrelyâ€ or â€œrelianceâ€ and set forth a statement that the parties could not rely upon the statements of the other party or a third person. Redwend Ltd. Partnership v. Edwards, 354 S.C. 459, 469-470, 581 S.E.2d 496, 501-502 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  In my opinion, the court of appealsâ€™ explanation of non-reliance clauses in Redwend is a concise description of the above emphasized language.\r\nAccordingly, in my opinion, the trial court correctly dismissed Buyersâ€™ counterclaims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  Buyers, as proponents of the counterclaims, had the burden to provide at least some evidence that a genuine issue of material fact existed as to each element of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.[5]Â  Both causes of action require Buyers to show that they relied upon the statements of Sellersâ€™ agent. [6]Â  However, Buyers effectively waived the right to argue reliance when they signed the sales contract.Â  Therefore, as a matter of law, Buyers cannot satisfy each element of fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\nAccordingly, I would reverse the court of appeals and uphold the trial courtâ€™s order dismissing Buyersâ€™ counterclaims for fraud and negligent misrepresentation.Â  \r\n\r\n[1]In effect, Buyers could still assert their right to terminate the contract because they were not required to purchase the property if an easement, such as the sewer line easement, â€œmaterially affect[ed the] present use of said property.â€Â  The Court of Appeals, when stating the facts of the case, improperly stated the sewer line easement materially affected the present use of the property.Â  This statement by the Court of Appeals is a conclusion on an issue that was not before the court because Buyersâ€™ breach of contract counterclaim on this point was allowed to go forward by the trial court.Â  \r\n[2]The Court of Appeals cited Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 540 (1979), which states that generally, as between the parties, the recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact is justified in relying upon its truth, although he might have ascertained the falsity of the representation had he made an investigation. Â Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 540 is inconsistent with state law.Â  The restatement suggests that a recipient of a fraudulent misrepresentation of fact is always justified in relying upon its truth and not conducting his own investigation.Â  This is not the case in South Carolina.Â  See, e.g., Florentine Corp., Inc. v. PEDA I, Inc., 287 S.C. 382, 339 S.E.2d 112 (1985) (determination of what constitutes reasonable diligence must be made on case by case basis); Watts v. Monarch Bldrs., Inc., 272 S.C. 517, 252 S.E.2d 889 (1979) (no evidence of fraud where buyers relied on sellerâ€™s agentâ€™s representation about property lines instead of conducting their own investigation).\r\n[3]However, breach of contract claims based on pre-contract statements or representations are precluded by the parol evidence rule.Â  See Gilliland, supra (parol evidence rule prevents introduction of extrinsic evidence of agreements or understandings contemporaneous with or prior to execution of written instrument when extrinsic evidence is to be used to contradict, vary, or explain written instrument; this is especially true when written instrument contains merger or integration clause).Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals correctly stated the law.Â  However, the pertinent question is whether a certain sentence in Paragraph 21 is part of the merger clause rather than a separate non-reliance clause.\r\n[4]The statements were as follows:\r\n\r\nThe parties further declare that they have not relied upon any representation of any party hereby released or of their attorneys, agents, or other representatives concerning the nature or extent of their respective injuries or damages. \r\nÂ  . . .\r\nÂ  (a) no promise or inducement for this Agreement has been made to him except as set forth herein; (b) this Agreement is executed by [Arnold] freely and voluntarily, and without reliance upon any statement or representation by Purchaser, the Company, any of the Affiliates or O.R. Rissman or any of their attorneys or agents except as set forth herein; (c) he has read and fully understands this Agreement and the meaning of its provisions; (d) he is legally competent to enter into this Agreement and to accept full responsibility therefor; and (e) he has been advised to consult with counsel before entering into this Agreement and has had the opportunity to do so.\r\n\r\n(Additions omitted).\r\n[5] See Cole v. South Carolina Electric and Gas, Inc., 355 S.C. 183, 194, 584 S.E.2d 405, 411 (Ct. App. 2003) (plaintiff has the burden to prove each element of the cause of action).\r\n[6] See Lundy v.

Steele (Steele).Â  This matter was certified from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\nOn April 4, 2003, appellants brought an action alleging unfair trade practices against Woodside Development Limited Partnership, a real estate developer; WSC Corporation, the Partnershipâ€™s managing partner; Woodside Ventures, LLC, the house builder; and Steele, the individual alleged to be the alter ego of the named businesses.Â  The deceptive act alleged by Wetzel was that an undisclosed kickback fee, in the amount of $17,370, was charged to Wetzel.Â  This kickback fee was to be paid by the house builder to the developer; however, the house builder charged the fee to Wetzel, although it was not known to or authorized by Wetzel.\r\nWetzel properly served the corporate defendants; however, Steele, who is a citizen and resident of Massachusetts, alleged he was not properly served.Â  As a result of the alleged improper service, Steele did not answer the complaint.Â  Wetzel filed a motion for judgment by default against Steele.Â  Thereafter, Steele moved to quash Wetzelâ€™s affidavit of default on the ground of insufficient service of the complaint.Â  The circuit court granted Steeleâ€™s motion and found Steele had not been properly served pursuant to Rule 4, SCRCP.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Wetzelâ€™s appeal be dismissed because it is interlocutory and therefore unappealable?\r\nII. Â Â Â Â  Did the circuit court err by finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-430 (2005) inapplicable to service of process on Steele?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nAs an initial matter, Steele argues this appeal should be dismissed because the circuit courtâ€™s order finding service on Steele to be improper is an interlocutory order that is not immediately appealable.Â  The basis for Steeleâ€™s argument is that the courtâ€™s order was an order granting a motion to set aside the entry of default pursuant to Rule 55(c), SCRCP.Â  \r\nNormally, an order granting a motion to set aside an entry of default is not immediately appealable.Â  Jefferson by Johnson v. Geneâ€™s Used Cars, Inc., 295 S.C. 317, 368 S.E.2d 456 (1988) (grant or denial of Rule 55(c) motion to set aside entry of default is not directly appealable).Â  Here, however, the effect of granting the motion and holding that Steele has not been properly served is equivalent to granting a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(5), SCRCP, since it ends the action as to Steele.[1]Â  Therefore, it is immediately appealable.[2]Â  Lebovitz v. Mudd, 289 S.C. 476, 347 S.E.2d 94 (1986) (grant of a partial motion to dismiss); Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglass Corp., 346 S.C. 37, 550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 2001), overruled on other grounds by Farmer v. Monsanto Corp., 353 S.C. 553, 579 S.E.2d 325 (2003) (grant of motion to dismiss as to some but not all of the parties is immediately appealable).\r\nII\r\nWetzel argues the circuit court erred by finding S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-430 (2005) inapplicable to service of process on Steele.\r\nOn April 4, 2003, Wetzel filed the summons and complaint.Â  That same day, Wetzel, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-9-430 (2005), sent two copies of the summons and complaint to the Secretary of State with a request that a copy be sent to Steele.Â  The Secretary of State accepted the summons and complaint and sent a copy to Steele at the given address by certified mail with a return receipt requested.Â  On April 21, 2003, the summons and complaint were received at Steeleâ€™s address and signed for by Donna Oâ€™Brien, an employee at the address.Â  Steele did not file an answer.\r\nThe circuit court granted Steeleâ€™s motion to quash the affidavit of default on the basis there was insufficient service upon Steele as an individual.Â  The court found that, pursuant to Rule 4(d)(8), SCRCP, the attempted service must be sent with delivery restricted to the addressee and that it must be signed for by the addressee.Â  The court disagreed that service was effective pursuant to Â§ 15-9-430 because, the summons and complaint were mailed to the partnership, not a corporate defendant for which Steele is a director.Â  The court found Â§ 15-9-430 inapplicable to service of process upon an individual, as an individual.\r\nRule 4(d)(8), SCRCP, provides that service upon an individual may be made by the plaintiff or by any person authorized to serve process pursuant to Rule 4(c), by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested and delivery restricted to the addressee.Â  Rule 4(d) further provides that this service shall not be the basis for the entry of a default or a judgment by default unless the record contains a return receipt showing the acceptance by the defendant.Â  If Rule 4(d)(8) were applicable, as the circuit court found, then the service upon Steele would be insufficient because delivery was not restricted to the addressee, i.e. Steele.Â  However, the circuit court erred by finding Rule 4(d)(8) applicable.Â  Instead, Rule 4(e), SCRCP, is the appropriate rule.Â  Rule 4(e) states:\r\n\r\nWhenever a statute . . . provides for service of a summons and complaint . . . upon a party not an inhabitant of or found within the State, service shall be made under the circumstances and in the manner prescribed by the statute . . . .\r\n\r\nSuch a statute exists in this situation.Â  Section 15-9-430 provides the procedure for the service of process on a nonresident director of a domestic corporation.Â  Section 15-9-430 states:\r\n\r\n(a) Each director of a domestic business corporation who is a nonresident of this State at the time of his election or who becomes a nonresident during his term in office, shall . . . be deemed to have appointed the Secretary of State as an agent to receive service of process upon him in any action or proceeding relating to actions of such corporation and arising while he held office as director of such corporation.\r\n(b) Service of such process shall be made by delivering to and leaving with the Secretary of State,Â  . . . duplicate copies of such process.Â  The Secretary of State shall thereupon immediately cause one of such copies to be forwarded to the nonresident director by certified mail.Â  Proof of service shall be by affidavit of compliance with this section filed, together with a copy of the process, with the clerk of court in which the action or proceeding is pending.\r\n. . .\r\n(e) . . . Delivery of copies of service as required in subsections (b) and (c) to the nonresident director must be made by delivering the copy to the most recent address on file with the companyâ€™s most current annual report or any more current interim report which has been filed with the Secretary of State pursuant to this subsection.Â  . . .\r\n\r\nWetzelâ€™s service upon Steele complied with this statute and, therefore, service is sufficient.Â  The fact that someone other than Steele signed for the documents is of no consequence because, unlike Rule 4(d)(8), Â§ 15-9-430 does not require that the documents be delivered directly to the addressee.Â  See also Wagenberg v. Charleston Wood Prods., Inc., 122 F. Supp. 745 (E.D.S.C. 1954) (not necessary that process be delivered personally to defendant; may be left at defendantâ€™s residence with person of discretion or with person employed at defendantâ€™s place of business).[3]Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFurther, the circuit court erred by finding service was not effective pursuant to Â§ 15-9-430 because the summons and complaint were mailed to the partnership and not to a corporate defendant for which Steele is a director.Â  There is no requirement in the statute that the service be mailed to the corporationâ€™s address.Â  The statute states only that the copies must be delivered or mailed to a nonresident director at his most recent address on file.Â  To find otherwise, would expand the statuteâ€™s operation.Â  Rowe v. Hyatt, 321 S.C. 366, 468 S.E.2d 649 (1996) (in interpreting statute, words must be given plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand statuteâ€™s operation).Â  Therefore, the circuit court erred by finding Â§ 15-9-430 inapplicable on this ground.\r\nAccordingly, the circuit court erred by finding the service of process on Steele was insufficient.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the order granting Steeleâ€™s motion is immediately appealable and that the circuit court erred by finding insufficient service of process.Â  Therefore, the decision of the circuit court is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Wetzel apparently recognizes this fact and argues that, because Steeleâ€™s motion to quash the affidavit of default was actually a Rule 12(b)(5), SCRCP, motion to dismiss for insufficient service of process, the motion was not timely filed.Â  This argument is not preserved for review because it was not ruled on by the circuit court.Â  See Townsend v. City of Dillon, 326 S.C. 244, 486 S.E.2d 95 (1997) (issue not ruled on by trial judge is not preserved for review).\r\n[2]Wetzel argues the circuit court erred by quashing the entry of default against Steele because the default judgment has been ministerially entered and cannot be set aside.Â  Rule 55(a), SCRCP, states that when a party against whom a judgment for affirmative relief is sought has failed to plead or otherwise defend and that fact is made to appear by affidavit or otherwise, the clerk shall enter default upon the calendar.Â  However, while a clerk may make an entry of default, a judge is required to enter a default judgment.Â  Rule 55(b)(1), SCRCP.Â  Specifically, the notes to the rule state that a clerk does not have authority to enter default judgments and that only a judge may enter a default judgment.Â  See also Beckham v. Durant, 300 S.C. 329, 331, n.2, 387 S.E.2d 701, 703, n.2 (Ct. App. 1989) (â€œThe entry of default is an official recognition of the failure to appear or otherwise respond, but it is not a judgment by default.Â  Judgment by default is not properly entered until damages are determined.â€).Â  Therefore, given that a judge has not entered a default judgment in this matter, Wetzelâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\n[3]Wagenberg was decided under the former service upon a nonresident director statute; however, the statute was similarly stated on this point.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-432.1 (1952) stated:Â  â€œ. . . Secretary of State shall forthwith forward one copy of such summons and complaint to the nonresident director at the last address filed with the Secretary of State as provided in the Code.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"State v.

Dudek, of the Office of Appellate Defense, serve as counsel for appellant.Â  They served and filed the initial brief on February 22, 2005.\r\nAppellant now moves to proceed pro se, arguing the warden and appellate counsel are acting to deny him access to the courts.Â  He maintains he does not want the assistance of attorneys from the Office of Appellate Defense and that he â€œrejectedâ€ them prior to their filing the initial brief and continues to reject them and any action they take on appellantâ€™s behalf.Â  In support of his request to proceed pro se, appellant contends S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(D) states that, â€œBoth the defendant and the State shall have the right to submit briefs within the time provided by the court and to present oral arguments to the court.â€\r\nBy way of return, appellate counsel take the position that the Court should not allow self-representation on direct appeal.Â  They assert that while a pro se defendant who mishandles a trial harms only himself, a pro se defendant who mishandles a direct appeal damages the criminal justice system as a whole.Â  Finally, appellate counsel argue that even if the Court allows self-representation on appeal from a criminal conviction, it should require the appellant to exercise that option before appellate counsel files the initial brief and designation of matter.\r\nThe State has filed a return in which it argues there is no federal constitutional right to self-representation on direct appeal and this State has not recognized such a right under its own constitution, see Martinez v. Court of Appeal of California, 528 U.S. 152, 120 S.Ct. 684, 145 L.Ed.2d 597 (2000), although it acknowledges that the Court has noted it is questionable whether Art. I, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution applies to appellate matters.[1]Â  Foster v. State, 298 S.C. 306, 379 S.E.2d 907 (1989).Â  The State argues that constitutional provision applies only to trials and not appellate proceedings.Â  \r\nThe State argues further that appellant has the assistance of two very experienced capital appeals litigators and they have already filed a brief in this matter.Â  The State contends it is simply too late to stop the process, go back to the beginning and allow submission of new substantive arguments simply because appellant is not satisfied with the issues raised by appellate counsel.Â  The State maintains appellate counsel are entitled to make a reasonable choice not to raise every non-frivolous issue requested by appellant, see Jones v. Barnes, 436 U.S. 745, 103 S.Ct. 3308, 77 L.Ed.2d 987 (1983), and any mistake they make in determining viable issues for briefing can be resolved on post-conviction relief instead of by way of a pro se brief on direct appeal.\r\nBy way of reply, appellant maintains Mr. Savitz is incompetent and ineffective.Â  He points to Mr. Savitzâ€™s failure to raise any guilt phase errors or constitutional errors in the initial brief.Â  Appellant contends the record clearly reflects that during the pre-trial and guilt phase, appellant sought â€œinstant relief or releaseâ€ based on Fourth Amendment violations and a lack of evidence.Â  He claims these two issues are the most significant and meritorious and should have been raised in the initial brief.Â  Appellant maintains he cannot raise the insufficiency of the evidence on post-conviction relief.\r\nThis Court has repeatedly held, pursuant to Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), that a criminal defendant may waive the right to counsel and proceed pro se at trial.Â  State v. Fuller, 337 S.C. 236, 523 S.E.2d 168 (1999); State v. Stuckey, 333 S.C. 56, 508 S.E.2d 564 (1998); State v. Reed, 332 S.C. 35, 503 S.E.2d 747 (1998); State v. Brewer, 328 S.C. 117, 492 S.E.2d 97 (1997); State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991); State v. Dixon, 269 S.C. 107, 236 S.E.2d 419 (1977).Â  However, we have never addressed whether a criminal defendant has the same right on appeal.\r\nIn Martinez, supra, the United States Supreme Court held that the rationale underlying the Faretta decision, including reliance on the Sixth Amendment, did not apply to appellate proceedings.Â  The Court also found no right of self-representation under the Due Process Clause.Â  Accordingly, a right of self-representation on appeal must be grounded in the state constitution, if at all.Â  The majority of the states that have addressed this issue following Martinez have found there is no state constitutional right to self-representation on appeal.\r\nArticle I, Â§ 16 of theÂ  Florida Constitution states the following:\r\n\r\nIn all criminal prosecutions the accused shall, upon demand, be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation, and shall be furnished a copy of the charges, and shall have the right to have compulsory process for witnesses, to confront at trial adverse witnesses, to be heard in person, by counsel or both, and to have a speedy and public trial by impartial jury in the county where the crime was committed.\r\n\r\nThe Florida Supreme Court found, despite this language, which is very similar to Art. I, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution, that in Florida there is no state constitutional right to proceed pro se on direct appeal, although the appellate court may, in its discretion, allow an appellant to proceed pro se.Â  Davis v. State, 789 So.2d 978 (Fla. 2001).Â  The New Hampshire Supreme Court has also determined its state constitution provides no due process right to a defendant to proceed pro se on appeal.[2]Â  State v. Thomas, 840 A.2d 803 (N.H. 2003).Â  Appellate courts in Arkansas, Texas and Washington have also held, in reliance upon Martinez, that an appellant in a criminal case does not have the right to proceed pro se on direct appeal in those states.Â  Fudge v. State, 19 S.W.3d 22 (Ark. 2000); Cormier v. State, 85 S.W.3d 496 (Tex. App. 2002); State v. Watson, 2000 WL 339179 (Wash. App. 2000).\r\nThe Alabama Supreme Court held that while the Alabama Constitution does not provide any basis for recognizing a right to self-representation on appeal,[3] certain statutes, when read together, give an appellant in a criminal case a statutory right to do so.[4]Â  Ex parte Scudder, 789 So.2d 837 (Ala. 2001).\r\nOther states had determined prior to the decision in Martinez that there is no constitutional right to self-representation on appeal from a criminal conviction.Â  In Blandino v. State, 914 P.2d 624 (Nev. 1996), the Supreme Court of Nevada held that the Sixth Amendment only applies to trials and does not support the existence of a right to self-representation on appeal.Â  The same has been held in Tennessee.Â  State v. Gillespie, 898 S.W.2d 738 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1994).\r\nHowever, there have been two states, Georgia and Michigan, who have determined that an appellant may proceed pro se in an appeal from a criminal conviction based on a state constitutional provision that contains language nearly identical to that found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-80 (Supp. 2004).Â  Costello v. State, 522 S.E.2d 572 (Ga. 1999); People v. Stephens, 246 N.W.2d 429 (Mich. App. 1976).Â  That statute states nothing in Chapter 5 of Title 40, regulating the practice of law in South Carolina, may be construed so as to prevent a citizen from prosecuting or defending his own cause, if he so desires.[5]Â  We note that New Hampshire, which has a statute containing nearly identical language, has held, in State v. Thomas, supra, that a criminal defendant does not have a right to proceed pro se on appeal, relying on the fact that its state constitution does not provide such a right.Â  The New Hampshire Supreme Court did not mention N.H. Rev. Stat. Â§ 311:1, which states that â€œ[a] party in any cause or proceeding may appear, plead, prosecute or defend in his or her proper person, that is, pro se, or may be represented by any citizen of good character.â€\r\nAppellant clearly does not have a federal constitutional right to proceed pro se in this appeal from his criminal conviction.Â  We also find there is no state constitutional provision which confers such a right.Â  We agree with the Florida, New Hampshire and Alabama Supreme Courts that language such as that contained in Art. I, Â§ 14 of the South Carolina Constitution does not apply to appeals.Â  However, the Court may, in its discretion, allow an appellant to proceed pro se in an appeal from a criminal conviction.Â  \r\nWe decline to do so in this case.Â  Initially, we note that appellantâ€™s request to proceed pro se was not made in a timely fashion.Â  Moreover, appellate counsel has no duty to raise every non-frivolous issue presented by the record and must be allowed to exercise reasonable professional judgment.Â  See Jones v. Barnes, supra. Â This is a death penalty appeal and, as the State points out, appellant is represented by two very experienced capital appeals litigators.Â  Finally, the State is also correct that any mistake appellate counsel make in determining viable issues for briefing can be resolved on post-conviction relief.Â  We therefore deny appellantâ€™s motion to proceed pro se.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n     s/Jean H.

Code Â§ 12-22-130 (1975).Â  The latter states, â€œIf it appears that the defendant desires to appeal and is unable financially or otherwise to obtain the assistance of counsel on appeal and the defendant expresses the desire for assistance of counsel, the trial court shall appoint counsel to represent and assist the defendant on appeal.â€Â  Ala. Code Â§ 15-12-22(b) (1975).Â  The Alabama Supreme Court found that these sections do not require that an appellant in a criminal case proceed with his appeal through counsel, but instead confer upon a defendant in a criminal case the right to represent himself on appeal if he so desires.\r\n[5]  Article I, Section I, Paragraph XII of the Georgia Constitution states: â€œNo person shall be deprived of the right to prosecute or defend, either in person or by an attorney, that personâ€™s own cause in any of the courts of this state.â€Â  Article I, Section 13 of the Michigan Constitution states: â€œA suitor in any court of this state has the right to prosecute or defend his suit, either in his own person or by an attorney.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26000","title":"Page v.

Hagler, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, Assistant Attorney General Melody J. Brown, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Joseph W. Page (Petitioner) pled guilty to possession with intent to distribute crack cocaine (PWID), criminal sexual conduct (CSC), and assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK).Â  Pursuant to a negotiated plea agreement that included a recommended cap of twenty yearsâ€™ imprisonment, Petitioner was sentenced to imprisonment for ten years for PWID and nineteen years for CSC and ABIK to be served concurrently.Â  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge denied Petitionerâ€™s request for relief.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner argues he did not enter a guilty plea knowingly and voluntarily because he was not informed of possible liability under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act (SVPA).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 2004).Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Petitioner testified he would not have pled guilty to CSC and ABIK if he had known about the SVPA.Â  At the PCR proceeding, plea counsel conceded he did not recall informing Petitioner of the SVPA.Â  The trial judge did not discuss the SVPA with Petitioner before accepting his plea.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas Petitionerâ€™s plea entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently where Petitioner was not informed he would be potentially liable under the Sexually Violent Predator Act after completing his sentence?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn order to establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove counselâ€™s performance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s case.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  Where there has been a guilty plea, the applicant must prove counselâ€™s representation fell below the standard of reasonableness and, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, there is a reasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 402 S.E.2d 484 (1991).Â  In determining guilty plea issues, it is proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR hearing.Â  Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d 360 (1984).\r\nThe Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000); Cherry v. State, supra.Â  The Court will not uphold the findings when there is no probative evidence to support them.Â  Holland v. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nHowever, in a case raising a novel issue of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question of law with no particular deference to the trial court.Â  Osprey v. Cabana Ltd. Partn., 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000); Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718 (2000).Â  The Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is controlled by an error of law.Â  Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004); Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000). Â Â \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitionerâ€™s primary contention is that his counsel failed to inform him his CSC conviction would make him eligible for possible civil commitment under the SVPA as a â€œsexually violent predator.â€[1]Â Â Â  Petitioner asserts he should have been informed of his potential for civil commitment as a consequence of his plea, and counselâ€™s failure to advise him resulted in a plea that was not knowing and voluntary. \r\nThe SVPA, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-48-10 to -170 (Supp. 2004), is a civil commitment procedure for the long-term care and treatment of sexually violent predators.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20; see Kansas v. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 117 S.Ct. 2072, 138 L.Ed.2d 501 (1997) (upholding Kansasâ€™ Sexually Violent Predator Act, from which South Carolinaâ€™s law is patterned); In re Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001); State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 564 S.E.2d 87 (2002).Â  The SVPA provides that one hundred eighty days before a person convicted of a sexually violent offense is released from confinement, the agency releasing the prisoner gives written notice to a multi-disciplinary team and the Attorney General.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-40(A).Â Â  Within thirty days of receiving notice, the multi-disciplinary team, which is appointed by the Director of the Department of Corrections, assesses whether the person satisfies the definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  If it is determined the person satisfies the definition of a sexually violent predator, the multidisciplinary team must forward a report of the assessment to the prosecutorâ€™s review committee.Â Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-50.Â  The prosecutorâ€™s review committee, which is appointed by the Attorney General, determines whether probable cause exists to believe the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-60.Â  \r\nIf the prosecutorâ€™s review committee determines probable cause exists to support the allegation, the Attorney General may file a petition with the court in the jurisdiction in which the person committed the offense to request that the court make a probable cause determination as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-70.Â  If the probable cause determination is made, the person is transferred to a secure facility for evaluation.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(D).Â Â  Within sixty days of the probable cause hearing, a trial is conducted to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  The person or Attorney General may request a jury trial.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90.Â  The court or jury shall determine whether, beyond a reasonable doubt, the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-100.\r\nWe conclude Petitionerâ€™s counsel had no duty to inform him about the civil commitment process under the SVPA.Â  Although eligibility for civil commitment under the SVPA is triggered by conviction of a â€œsexually violent offense,â€ civil commitment can be imposed only after testing, evaluation, a probable cause hearing, and a trial by either the court or jury.Â  No one can be civilly committed as a â€œsexually violent predatorâ€ unless the State proves beyond a reasonable doubt the person suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility.Â  Consequently, a person may be convicted of a predicate offense, and yet not be committed under the SVPA because the evidence is not sufficient to find that his or her present mental condition creates a likelihood of future sexually violent behavior. Thus, any possible civil commitment of Petitioner would not flow directly from his guilty plea, but rather from a separate civil proceeding as a collateral consequence.\r\nâ€œThe distinction between â€˜directâ€™ and â€˜collateralâ€™ consequences of a plea . . . turns on whether the result represents a definite, immediate and largely automatic effect on the range of the defendantâ€™s punishment.â€Â  Cuthrell v. Director, 475 F.2d 1364, 1366-67 (4th Cir. 1973) (refusing to invalidate a plea where the court had failed to advise the defendant that he might be civilly committed, even though commitment flowing from the crime he committed was, for all intents and purposes, automatic); Brown v. State, 306 S.C. 381, 382, 412 S.E.2d 399, 400 (1991) (â€œThe imposition of a sentence may have a number of collateral consequences . . . and a plea of guilty is not rendered involuntary in a constitutional sense if the defendant is not informed of the collateral consequences.â€).\r\nOther courts have concluded trial counsel does not have an obligation to inform a defendant of possible commitment under the SVPA.Â  For example, in Bussell v. State, 963 P.2d 1250 (Kan. App. 1998), the Kansas Court of Appeals concluded trial counsel was not ineffective in failing to advise the defendant about the KSVPA.Â  In that case, the court stated:\r\n\r\nIt is unclear now and will remain so in the future whether the KSVPA will ever apply to defendant because he has not yet finished his criminal sentence.Â  The uncertainty inherent in predicting whether the KSVPA will ever be invoked against defendant is such that the failure of his counsel to advise him of potential consequences cannot be said to be constitutionally deficient.\r\n\r\nId. at 1254; see also Pearman v. State, 764 So.2d 739 (Fla. App. 2000); Martin v. Reinstein, 987 P.2d 779 (Ariz. App. 1999); State v. Bollig, 593 N.W.2d 67 (Wis. App. 1999); In re Paschke, 909 P.2d 1328 (Wash. App. 1996).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we conclude a defendantâ€™s possible commitment under the Sexually Violent Predator Act is a collateral consequence of sentencing pursuant to a guilty plea or a conviction. Therefore counsel was under no obligation to inform Petitioner of possible commitment under the\r\nSVPA.\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C.

Hill, of Law\r\n        Offices of Robert Hill, of Newberry; and&nbsp; Woodrow H. Gooding and\r\n        Mark B. Tinsley, both of Gooding &amp; Gooding, P.A., of Allendale, for\r\n        Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER: The special\r\nreferee denied appellantâ€™s motion to set aside a default judgment on the\r\nground of improper service.&nbsp; We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe respondents Johnny Roberson and\r\nPhyliss Frederick filed an action against Southern Finance Company (Southern\r\nFinance) alleging negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress,\r\nfalse imprisonment, and malicious prosecution. The respondents mailed the\r\nsummons and complaint to Southern Financeâ€™s registered agent, Charles Brooks,\r\nby certified mail with return receipt requested.&nbsp; A clerical employee, Amy\r\nJones Bair, signed the return receipt.&nbsp; Brooks testified he never received\r\nthe summons and complaint.&nbsp; Accordingly, Southern Finance never answered\r\nthe complaint and the respondents filed a motion for default judgment.&nbsp;\r\nSubsequently, the circuit court granted an entry of default against Southern\r\nFinance and referred the matter to a special referee for default judgment to be\r\nentered and a damages hearing.&nbsp;\r\nAfter holding a damages hearing, the\r\nspecial referee entered a default judgment and awarded each respondent $25,000\r\nin actual damages and $150,000 in punitive damages, for a total default judgment\r\nof $350,000. Southern Finance moved to set aside or amend the judgment or for a\r\nnew trial nisi remittitur on the ground that service was improper because Bair\r\nwas not authorized to receive service for Southern Finance. The special referee\r\ndenied the motion and Southern Finance now appeals.&nbsp;\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the special referee err in\r\n  denying Southern Financeâ€™s Rule 60 motion to set aside the default judgment\r\n  on the ground the summons and complaint were not properly served?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe special referee denied Southern\r\nFinanceâ€™s motion to set aside the default judgment due to the lack of proper\r\nservice of the summons and complaint.&nbsp; The special referee found Bair was\r\nan implied agent with the authority to accept service of process.&nbsp; Southern\r\nFinance contends the special referee erred.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nThe decision whether to set aside an\r\nentry of default or a default judgment lies solely within the sound discretion\r\nof the trial judge. Thompson v. Hammond, 299 S.C. 116, 119, 382 S.E.2d\r\n900, 902-903 (1989).&nbsp; The trial courtâ€™s decision will not be disturbed on\r\nappeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of that discretion. Mitchell Supply\r\nCo., Inc. v. Gaffney, 297 S.C. 160, 162-63, 375 S.E.2d 321, 322-23 (Ct.App.\r\n1988).&nbsp; &quot;An abuse of discretion in setting aside a default judgment\r\noccurs when the judge issuing the order was controlled by some error of law or\r\nwhen the order, based upon factual, as distinguished from legal conclusions, is\r\nwithout evidentiary support.&quot; In re Estate of Weeks, 329 S.C. 251,\r\n259, 495 S.E.2d 454, 459 (Ct.App. 1997).\r\n&nbsp;Southern Finance moved to set\r\naside the default judgment pursuant to Rules 55(c) and 60 (b), SCRCP.&nbsp; â€œThe\r\nstandard for granting relief from an entry of default is good cause under Rule\r\n55(c) . . . while the standard is more rigorous for granting relief from a\r\ndefault judgment under Rule 60(b). . . .&quot;&nbsp; Ricks v. Weinrauch,\r\n293 S.C. 372, 374, 360 S.E.2d 535, 536 (Ct.App. 1987).&nbsp;&nbsp; Southern\r\nFinance did not make any motion until after the default judgment had been\r\nentered.&nbsp; Therefore, Rule 55(c) is inapplicable. Under Rule 60(b), a party\r\nmay seek relief from a&nbsp; default judgment where the judgment is void.&nbsp;\r\nSouthern Finance contends the\r\ndefault judgment is void because of improper service. Rule 4(d)(3), SCRCP,\r\nprovides that service upon a corporation may be made â€œby delivering a copy of\r\nthe summons and complaint to an officer, a managing or general agent, or to any\r\nother agent authorized by appointment or by law to receive service of process .\r\n. .â€ Further, Rule 4(d)(8) provides, in part:\r\n\r\n  Service pursuant to this paragraph\r\n  shall not be the basis for the entry of a default or a judgment by default\r\n  unless the record contains a return receipt showing the acceptance by the\r\n  defendant. Any such default or judgment by default shall be set aside pursuant\r\n  to Rule 55(c) or Rule 60(b) if the defendant demonstrates to the court that\r\n  the return receipt was signed by an unauthorized person.\r\n\r\nâ€œ[A] plaintiff need only show\r\ncompliance with the rules.â€&nbsp; Roche v. Young Bros., Inc., 318 S.C.\r\n207, 211, 456 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1995).&nbsp; When the rules are followed, it is\r\npresumed that service was proper.&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; It is undisputed that the respondents sent the\r\nsummons and complaint via certified mail with return receipt requested to\r\nSouthern Financeâ€™s registered agent, Brooks, at the address on file with the\r\nSecretary of State for Brooks.&nbsp; Further, it is undisputed that Bair signed\r\nthe return receipt. &nbsp;Thus, pursuant to Rule 4(d)(8), the burden shifts to\r\nSouthern Finance to demonstrate Bair was not authorized to accept service.&nbsp;\r\nSouthern\r\nFinance contends Bair was not its agent and thus did not have the authority to\r\naccept service on its behalf.&nbsp; An agent's authority is composed of his or\r\nher actual authority, whether express or implied, together with the apparent\r\nauthority which the principal by his or her conduct is precluded from&nbsp;\r\ndenying.&nbsp; Thus, an agent's authority must be either expressed, implied, or\r\napparent.&nbsp; 2A CJS Agency Â§ 132 (2004).&nbsp; While actual authority is\r\nexpressly conferred upon the agent by the principal, apparent authority is when\r\nthe principal knowingly permits the agent to exercise authority, or the\r\nprincipal holds the agent out as possessing such authority.&nbsp; Moore v. North Am. Van Lines, 310 S.C. 236, 239, 423 S.E.2d\r\n116, 118 (1992).\r\nWhether\r\napparent authority can suffice to show authorization to accept service under\r\nRule 4 is an unsettled question. See Schultz v. Schultz, 436 F.2d\r\n635, 637 (7th Cir.1971) (describing as &quot;dubious&quot; the &quot;assumption\r\nthat such authority may be implied in some situations&quot;); see also\r\nChatman v. Condell Med. Ctr., 2002 WL 737051, at *3 (N.D.Ill. Apr. 22,\r\n2002) (collecting cases).&nbsp;\r\nEven if\r\napparent authority suffices, however, it is established based upon\r\nmanifestations by the principal, not the agent. See Shropshire\r\nv. Prahalis, 309 S.C. 70, 419 S.E.2d 829 (Ct.App. 1992).&nbsp; An apparent\r\nagency may not be established solely by the declarations and conduct of an\r\nalleged agent. Frasier v. Palmetto Homes, 323 S.C. 240, 473 S.E.2d 865 (Ct.App.\r\n1996). &nbsp;There is no evidence in the record that Southern Finance manifested\r\nBair was its apparent agent in any way.&nbsp;\r\nNeither\r\ndo the circumstances support the conclusion that Bair had implied authority to\r\naccept service for Southern Finance.&nbsp; Again, there is no evidence Southern\r\nFinance authorized Bair to act as its registered agent.&nbsp; Furthermore, an\r\nagent has no implied authority unless she herself believed she had such\r\nauthority. 2A CJS Agency Â§ 136 (2004).&nbsp; Bair testified she has never been\r\nauthorized to accept service.&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\nrespondents also argue past behavior by Bair creates an agency relationship in\r\nthis case.&nbsp; Bair has accepted service for Brooks on behalf of Southern\r\nFinance in several other cases in the past as outlined in the special refereeâ€™s\r\norder. Southern Finance contends that these instances are irrelevant in\r\ndetermining whether Bair was the apparent or implied agent to accept service in\r\nthis case.&nbsp; Certainly, past behavior could be relevant to show\r\nagency.&nbsp; However, it is Southern Financeâ€™s past behavior which would be\r\nrelevant and not Bairâ€™s.&nbsp; Here, there is no evidence in the record that\r\nSouthern Finance held out Bair as its agent or was even aware that Bair had ever\r\nsigned for Brooks.&nbsp; Bairâ€™s behavior in the prior cases are not actions\r\nwhich a third party could rely upon to conclude that Southern Finance authorized\r\nher to accept service.\r\nThe\r\nfindings of the special referee are binding on this Court unless wholly\r\nunsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.&nbsp; Here,&nbsp;\r\nthe special refereeâ€™s determination that service was proper should be reversed\r\nas it is unsupported by the evidence.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are unable to find any\r\nevidence in the record to support a legal relationship between Bair and Southern\r\nFinance sufficient to have effectuated proper service.&nbsp; Because we find\r\nservice was improper, we need not address the remaining issues as the default\r\njudgment is void.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and\r\nPLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26002","title":"Martin Engineering v.

At issue is whether Lexington County School District One\r\n(District) properly allowed Respondent Sharp Construction Company (Sharp), to\r\namend its bid on the Lexington High School Additions and Renovations Project\r\n(Project).&nbsp; The circuit court granted District summary judgment, holding\r\nthe correction was properly allowed.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn August 2003, District received\r\nbids for the Project.&nbsp; Sharp was the low bidder with a bid of\r\n$16,300,000.00.&nbsp; Appellant, Martin Engineering, was the second lowest\r\nbidder with a bid of $17,375,000.00.&nbsp; Immediately after the bids were\r\nopened, Sharp advised District it had inadvertently neglected to include a\r\nroofing subcontractorâ€™s bid in its overall bid.&nbsp; It requested to be\r\nallowed to correct its bid by adding the roofing cost, $613,500.00, to its\r\nbid.&nbsp; Alternatively, Sharp requested to withdraw its bid.&nbsp; District\r\nallowed Sharp to adjust its bid, resulting in an overall bid by Sharp of\r\n$16,913,500.00, some $461,500.00 less than Martinâ€™s bid.[1]&nbsp; Martin filed a complaint in the circuit\r\ncourt seeking an injunction.&nbsp; The circuit court held the adjustment was\r\nproperly allowed in compliance with Districtâ€™s Procurement Code and\r\nRegulations.&nbsp;\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Did the circuit court err in holding District properly allowed the upward\r\n  adjustment?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Did the court err in finding Sharp would suffer a substantial loss if it were\r\n  not allowed to correct its bid?&nbsp;\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; CORRECTION OF BID\r\nDistrictâ€™s\r\nProcurement Code, Article 2, Section 2-102 controls Competitive Sealed\r\nBidding.&nbsp; In particular, section 2-102 (10), â€œCorrection or Withdrawal of\r\nBids: Cancellation of Awardsâ€ states:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  Corrections\r\n  or withdrawal of inadvertently erroneous bids before or after award, or\r\n  cancellation of awards or contracts based on such bid mistakes may be\r\n  permitted where appropriate.\r\n  After\r\n  bid openings, no change in bid prices or other provisions of bids prejudicial\r\n  to the interest of the school district or fair competition will be\r\n  permitted.&nbsp; A bidder must submit a written request to either correct or\r\n  withdraw a bid to the school district.&nbsp; Each written request must\r\n  document the fact that the bidderâ€™s mistake is clearly an error that will\r\n  cause him substantial loss.&nbsp; In order to maintain the integrity of the\r\n  competitive sealed bidding process, a bidder will not be permitted to\r\n  correct a bid mistake after bid opening that would cause such bidder to\r\n  have the low bid, unless the mistake, in the judgment of the school district,\r\n  is clearly evident from examining the bid document: for example, extension\r\n  of unit prices or errors in addition.&nbsp; All decisions to permit the\r\n  correction of (sic) withdrawal of bids, or to cancel awards or contracts based\r\n  on bids mistakes, will be supported by a written determination.\r\n\r\n(emphasis\r\nsupplied).[2]\r\nMartin\r\ncontends that unless an error is clearly evident by examining the bid document\r\nitself, no correction is permissible.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; It is patent from\r\nthe language of Â§ 2-102 (10) that only a correction which causes the bidder\r\nto have the low bid requires the mistake be clearly evident from\r\nexamining the bid document.&nbsp; On the other hand, where the bid\r\ncorrection does not cause the bidder to have the low bid, nothing in Â§\r\n2-102 requires District to confine its review to the bid document itself.&nbsp;\r\nHere,\r\nthe item Sharp failed to include in its bid the bid of its roofing\r\nsubcontractor, Watts.&nbsp; There was evidence that three\r\ndifferent roofing contractors had utilized the identical roof bid from Watts\r\nin bidding on Districtâ€™s project.&nbsp; Moreover, Sharp had listed Watts\r\nas a sub-contactor in its bid.&nbsp; This evidence was in existence prior to the\r\ntime the bids were opened.&nbsp; From this evidence, we find it was within\r\nDistrictâ€™s discretion to determine that correction of Sharpâ€™s inadvertently\r\nerroneous bid was proper, and that the correction would not be prejudicial to\r\nthe interests of the school district or fair competition.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMartin\r\nasserts the integrity of the bidding process and the need for fair competition\r\nrequire clear rules for post opening bid corrections.&nbsp; While we are not\r\nunmindful of the need to preserve the integrity of the bidding process, we find\r\nno violation of the rules in this case.&nbsp; Martin has not shown that the\r\nprocedures followed by District render the upward correction unfair or\r\nunjust, nor has he demonstrated in what manner the correction was prejudicial to\r\nthe District or to fair competition.\r\nAs noted\r\nby Districtâ€™s order in this case, â€œIt is true that Sharpâ€™s omission of the\r\nprice for the build-up roof was not apparent from the bid form itself.&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the mistake is clear, and the amount Sharp intended to bid for the roof\r\nis evident, by examining the roofing subcontractorâ€™s sub-bid, which was\r\nsubmitted to several of the bidders, including Sharp and Martin.â€&nbsp; We\r\nagree with the District that allowing the correction in this case neither\r\njeopardized the integrity of the sealed bidding process, nor was it prejudicial\r\nto the interests of the District or fair competition.&nbsp; To the contrary, to\r\naccept Martinâ€™s argument that District must reject Sharpâ€™s bid and accept\r\nits bid, some $461,500.00 higher than Sharpâ€™s corrected bid, would clearly be\r\nprejudicial to the District requiring it to expend substantially more money.\r\nMartin\r\ncites case law from other jurisdictions as supporting its claim that\r\npost-opening bid amendments are impermissible unless an error is readily\r\napparent on the face of the bid.[3]&nbsp;\r\nWe find cases from other jurisdictions, addressing other state procurement\r\ncodes, are simply inapplicable to Districtâ€™s procurement code.&nbsp;\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSUBSTANTIAL LOSS\r\nMartin\r\nnext asserts Sharp failed to produce evidence that the bid mistake would cause\r\nhim â€œsubstantial lossâ€ as required by section 2-102(10) (â€œeach written\r\nrequest must document that the bidderâ€™s mistake is clearly an error that will\r\ncause him substantial lossâ€).&nbsp; Accordingly, Martin contends the circuit\r\ncourt erred in finding â€œit patently reasonable to determine that omitting\r\n$613,000 in this Project would constitute a substantial loss.â€&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nIt is\r\nuncontroverted that Sharp neglected to include $613,000.00 for the roof build up\r\nin its bid on the project.&nbsp; Although it is unclear precisely the extent to\r\nwhich this affects Sharpâ€™s overall profit margin, we find that $613,000.00\r\nconstitutes a substantial loss.&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\ncircuit courtâ€™s order granting District summary judgment is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] &nbsp;These facts were stipulated by the parties.&nbsp;\r\n[2] &nbsp;Districtâ€™s Procurement Regulation No. 15 similarly\r\nprovides:\r\n\r\n  To maintain the integrity of the\r\n  competitive sealed bidding system, a bidder will not be permitted to correct a\r\n  bid mistake after a bid opening that would cause the bidder to have the low\r\n  bid unless the mistake, in the judgment of the Procurement Officer, is\r\n  clearly evident from examining bid documents, e.g., extension of unit prices\r\n  or errors in addition.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n[3]&nbsp; Martin also cites three State\r\nProcurement Review Panel decisions which hold that in order for an upward\r\ncorrection of a competitive sealed bid to be permissible, the error must be\r\napparent from the face of the bid documents.&nbsp; None of these cases has been\r\nreviewed by this Court.&nbsp; Moreover, we simply do not find the State Panel\r\ndecisions controlling under the facts of this case.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

The notice of\r\n  intention to appeal to the circuit court must be filed in the office of the\r\n  circuit court and in the office of the probate court and a copy served on\r\n  all parties within ten days after receipt of written notice of the appealed\r\n  from order, sentence, or decree of the probate court.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Code Ann. Â§ 58-17-3420\r\n(1976) but declining to award him damages for this breach.&nbsp; We affirm the\r\norder appealed by Plaintiff, but reverse the jury verdicts, and remand those\r\nclaims for a new trial.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn approximately 1912, a railroad\r\nline was constructed in the town of Pelzer.&nbsp;\r\nThe line runs parallel to the Saluda River and\r\ncrosses several existing roads.&nbsp; The railroad track effectively separates\r\napproximately twenty-one homes (the mill village) from the rest of Pelzer.&nbsp;\r\nThe area is hilly, and while the railroad created grade crossings at Jordan and\r\nStephens Streets, it made a cut under Green\r\nStreet and built a wooden bridge to carry road traffic over the railway.&nbsp;\r\nThe Green Street Bridge\r\nwas the primary route for persons traveling to and from the mill village.\r\nIn July\r\n1998, arsonists damaged the Green Street Bridge\r\nrendering it unusable by vehicles.&nbsp; The Jordan Street Crossing became the\r\nprimary ingress/egress point.&nbsp; Jordan\r\nStreet is horseshoe-shaped, and the crossing is located in the curve of the\r\nhorseshoe.&nbsp; The crossing is at the bottom of a hill, so that vehicles\r\napproaching it from either direction are traveling downhill.&nbsp; The Jordan\r\nStreet Crossing is â€œpassive,â€ that is, controlled only by a cross-buck.[1]&nbsp;\r\nThe\r\nrailroad line crossing Jordan\r\nStreet is used only to deliver coal to a Duke Power steam plant; there are\r\napproximately five trains a week, and the speed limit for the trains is\r\ntwenty-five miles per hour.&nbsp; There was evidence that approximately 465 to\r\n495 vehicles used the Jordan Street Crossing on a weekday, with less vehicular\r\ntraffic on weekends.&nbsp;\r\nOn the\r\nevening of June 17, 2000, at approximately 6:00 p.m., Doris Medlin and her\r\nsister-in-law, Susan Webb (Plaintiffâ€™s decedent), were returning to their\r\nhomes in the mill village after grocery shopping.&nbsp; As Mrs. Medlin drove her\r\ncar across the tracks, the car was struck by a CSX train returning from the\r\npower plant after dropping off loaded coal cars.&nbsp; The train consisted of\r\ntwo engines hooked together, and was traveling about twenty-five miles per hour.[2]&nbsp; Mrs. Medlin survived the\r\nwreck; Mrs. Webb, the front seat passenger, died about two months later from\r\ninjuries sustained in the accident.\r\nWe\r\naddress Plaintiffâ€™s appeal first.\r\nPLAINTIFFâ€™S\r\nAPPEAL\r\n\r\n  Whether\r\n  the trial judge erred in finding CSXâ€™s failure to repair the Green Street Bridge\r\n  was not the proximate cause of this accident?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPlaintiff\r\ncontends that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-17-3420 imposes a legal obligation on CSX to\r\nrepair the Green Street Bridge, and that its failure to do so entitles Plaintiff\r\nto damages pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-17-3980 (1976).&nbsp; The circuit\r\ncourt agreed 3420 required CSX to repair the bridge, but held that damages were\r\nawardable under 3980 only if the failure to repair were a proximate cause of\r\nPlaintiffâ€™s decedentâ€™s death.&nbsp; Finding the bridge repair issue a remote\r\nrather than efficient cause of the accident, the court declined to award\r\ndamages.&nbsp; Plaintiff argues this was error.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nSection\r\n58-17-3420, entitled â€œConstruction and maintenance of bridges,â€ is part of\r\nthe General Railroad Law, and provides:\r\n\r\n  Every\r\n  railroad corporation shall, at its own expense, construct, and afterwards\r\n  maintain and keep in repair, all bridges, with their approaches or abutments,\r\n  which it is authorized or required to construct over or under any turnpike\r\n  road, canal, highway or other way and any city or town may recover of the\r\n  railroad corporation whose road crosses a highway or town way therein all\r\n  damages, charges and expenses incurred by such city or town by reason of the\r\n  neglect or refusal of the corporation to erect or keep in repair all\r\n  structures required or necessary at such crossing.&nbsp; But if, after the\r\n  laying out and making of a railroad, the governing body of a county has\r\n  authorized a turnpike, highway or other way to be laid out across the\r\n  railroad, all expenses of and incident to constructing and maintaining the\r\n  turnpike or way at such crossing shall be borne by the turnpike corporation or\r\n  the county, city, town or other owner of it.\r\n\r\nIn this\r\ncase, CSXâ€™s alleged violation of 3420 was tried to the judge as an equity\r\nmatter at the same time the jury was hearing Plaintiffâ€™s negligence\r\nclaims.&nbsp; The theory of CSXâ€™s equitable liability to Plaintiff rests on\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 58-17-3980 and 58-17-3990 (1976).&nbsp; Section 3980,\r\nentitled â€œDamages and penalty for unlawful acts where no specific penalty\r\nprovided for,â€ provides:\r\n\r\n  If any\r\n  person shall do, suffer or permit to be done any act, matter or thing in this\r\n  chapter declared to be unlawful, shall omit to do any act, matter or thing in\r\n  this chapter required to be done or shall be guilty of any violation of any of\r\n  the provisions of this chapter, such person shall, when no specific penalty is\r\n  herein provided for such violation, forfeit and pay to the person who may\r\n  sustain damage thereby a sum equal to three times the amount of the damages so\r\n  sustained, to be recovered by the person so damaged by suit in the circuit\r\n  court of any county in this State in which the person causing such damage can\r\n  be found or may have an agent, office or place of business.&nbsp; But in any\r\n  such case of recovery the damage shall not be assessed at a less sum than two\r\n  hundred and fifty dollars.&nbsp; And the person so offending shall, for each\r\n  offense, forfeit and pay a penalty of not less than one thousand dollars, to\r\n  be recovered by the State by action in any such circuit court to be brought by\r\n  the Attorney General upon the request of the Public Service Commission.\r\n\r\nThe next\r\nstatute, Â§ 58-17-3990, provides:\r\n\r\n  Any\r\n  action brought as provided in Â§ 58-17-3980 to recover any penalty or damages\r\n  shall be regarded as a subject of equity jurisdiction and discovery and\r\n  affirmative relief may be sought and obtained therein.&nbsp; In any such\r\n  action so brought as a case of equitable cognizance, preliminary or final\r\n  injunction may, without allegation or proof of damage to the complainant, be\r\n  granted upon proper application, restraining, forbidding and prohibiting the\r\n  commission or continuance of any act, matter or thing by this chapter\r\n  prohibited or forbidden.\r\n\r\nAlthough\r\nthe failure to repair the Green Street Bridge\r\nissue was ostensibly being tried to the judge alone as an equity matter, the\r\njury heard all the evidence, including evidence that CSX at one time promised to\r\nrepair the bridge, but then decided not to.&nbsp; There was evidence from\r\nnumerous mill village residents and a local politician about their efforts to\r\nhave CSX replace the bridge, as well as testimony about the deleterious effects\r\non the community resulting from CSXâ€™s refusal to repair.\r\nAfter the\r\njury returned its verdicts, the judge asked it to return an advisory\r\ninterrogatory answering whether it found that CSXâ€™s failure to repair the\r\nbridge was â€œthe proximate cause of damages in this case.â€&nbsp; The jury\r\nreturned in six minutes, finding that the bridge issue was the proximate cause,\r\nand adding, â€œwe, the jury, strongly recommend that CSX replace the Green Street Bridge.â€\r\nThe trial judge subsequently issued\r\na written order holding there was no proximate causal link between CSXâ€™s\r\nfailure to repair the Green Street Bridge\r\nand the fatal accident.&nbsp; Plaintiff contends this was incorrect.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.&nbsp; As the Court said in 1942:\r\n\r\n  The question always is, Was there\r\n  any unbroken connection between the wrongful act and the injury, a continuous\r\n  operation?&nbsp; Did the facts constitute a succession of events, so linked\r\n  together as to make a natural whole, or was there some new and independent\r\n  cause intervening between the wrong and the injury?&nbsp; The test is to be\r\n  found in the probable injurious consequences which were to be anticipated, not\r\n  in the number of subsequent events and agencies that might arise.\r\n  Pfaehler v. Ten Cent Taxi Co.,\r\n  198 S.C. 476, 18 S.E.2d 331 (1942).\r\n\r\nThere was no&nbsp; â€œcontinuous\r\noperationâ€ linking the destroyed bridge and the fatal accident.&nbsp; The\r\nfinding of no proximate cause is affirmed.[3]\r\nCSXâ€™S\r\nAPPEAL\r\nCSX raises a number of issues on\r\nappeal, including claims that it was entitled to a directed verdict on both of\r\nPlaintiffâ€™s negligence theories, that a number of evidentiary errors require a\r\nnew trial absolute, and that, at the very least, the punitive damages award\r\ncannot stand in light of the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s intervening\r\ndecision in State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S.  408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155 L.Ed. 2d 585\r\n(2003).&nbsp; We find merit in CSXâ€™s assertion of reversible error arising\r\nfrom Plaintiffâ€™s Green Street Bridge\r\nrepair claim, and find that several other evidentiary rulings prejudiced\r\nCSX.&nbsp; Further, we hold that the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Campbell\r\nrequires, even in the absence of other errors, that a new punitive damages\r\nhearing be held.&nbsp; See Durham v. Vinson, 306 S.C. 639, 602 S.E.2d\r\n760 (2004).&nbsp; We address CSXâ€™s appellate issues below.\r\nBRIDGE\r\nREPAIR\r\nCSX\r\nargues that the admission before the jury of evidence relevant only to the\r\nbridge replacement issue, and Plaintiffâ€™s use of this evidence in closing\r\nargument, were so prejudicial that reversal is mandated.&nbsp; We agree.\r\nWe have\r\npreviously referred to the bridge repair testimony from numerous witnesses, none\r\nof which was remotely relevant to the negligence issues before the jury.&nbsp;\r\nIn addition, Plaintiffâ€™s closing argument posited the question, â€œWhere is\r\nthe beginning for [decedentâ€™s] death?â€ and answered it in this way:\r\n\r\n  For\r\n  Susan Webb though, the real beginning was 1998, July 12th,\r\n  1998.&nbsp; The date is when the bridge that provided access to their little\r\n  community burned.&nbsp; And CSX had a legal obligation because the law\r\n  required it.&nbsp; Code section 58-15-3420 [sic] required them, if the\r\n  railroad came there and there was a street there and the railroad crossed that\r\n  street and the street had to come over it; and if they built a bridge, which\r\n  they did, they had the legal obligation to repair that bridge.\r\n  And you\r\n  know, the bridge burned July 12th and CSX -- and Iâ€™m going to get\r\n  my glasses out, because I canâ€™t see that screen without it -- the bridge\r\n  burned at that time.&nbsp; And the newspaper reported that Mr. Clark, you\r\n  remember Tom Clark, the CSX bridge engineer said they had a legal obligation\r\n  to repair that bridge.&nbsp; And the article states that July 12th\r\n  -- &quot;The bridge burned July 12th and would be rebuilt, CSX\r\n  Railroadâ€™s bridge engineer said Monday.&nbsp; Materials to reconstruct the\r\n  bridge at Lopez and Green Streets to original specifications have been ordered\r\n  and should be available in 30 days.â€\r\n  And you\r\n  will recall that the testimony was that Mr. McClure, as it states there in the\r\n  article, asked them to replace this bridge and talked with them, talked with\r\n  the bridge engineer or bridge department.&nbsp; And they said that after you\r\n  asked it, they apparently changed their mind.&nbsp; He said it wasnâ€™t in the\r\n  budget.&nbsp; They werenâ€™t going to do it, even though they acknowledged\r\n  their legal duty, the statute required them to do it, they decided, weâ€™re\r\n  not going to do it.&nbsp; They even went so far as to have this material\r\n  shipped to Pelzer.&nbsp; It was on a side track there to Pelzer to repair the\r\n  bridge.\r\n  Then\r\n  they made a decision not to do it.&nbsp; They werenâ€™t going to do it.&nbsp;\r\n  Why do you think they werenâ€™t going to do it?&nbsp; Because of money.&nbsp;\r\n  They didnâ€™t want to spend the money.&nbsp; They took this money and put it\r\n  elsewhere when they could have provided the access, the ingress and egress to\r\n  that community that would not have required them to use this dangerous\r\n  railroad crossing that was .2 miles away.\r\n  Now,\r\n  they had had a -- the railroad, the testimony was, if you will recall the\r\n  testimony, wanting to get out of their obligation to maintain railroad\r\n  bridges, which the law required them to do.&nbsp; They can get out of it by\r\n  making a settlement with the county as they did with the SCDOT.&nbsp; They pay\r\n  the money, get out of this obligation.&nbsp; But they didnâ€™t want to pay any\r\n  money, but they didnâ€™t want the obligationâ€¦.\r\n\r\nAlthough\r\nthe jury was not charged on 3420, its â€œadvisory interrogatoryâ€ indicates it\r\nwas profoundly and prejudicially affected by the bridge repair evidence and by\r\nPlaintiffâ€™s closing argument.&nbsp; The trial judgeâ€™s ultimate correct\r\nconclusion that the failure to replace the bridge was not a proximate cause of\r\nthe accident renders all this evidence and argument irrelevant, to the extreme\r\nprejudice of CSX.&nbsp; We hold that these circumstances require a new trial\r\nabsolute, but briefly address the merits of several of CSXâ€™s other appellate\r\nissues, which involve issues that may arise on retrial.\r\nDIRECTED\r\nVERDICT\r\nPlaintiff\r\nalleged two different acts constituted negligence on the part of CSX: the\r\nfailure to the engineer to sound the trainâ€™s whistle for 1,500 feet before the\r\ncrossing (â€œshort hornâ€), and CSXâ€™s failure to control vegetation around\r\nthe crossing, thereby obstructing motoristsâ€™ views (â€œsight lineâ€).&nbsp;\r\nCSX argues the judge erred in failing to grant a directed verdict in its favor,\r\narguing Plaintiff produced insufficient evidence to support a liability finding\r\non any theory.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nIn ruling on directed verdict\r\nmotions, the trial court must view the evidence and its reasonable inferences in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.&nbsp; An appellate court will\r\nreverse the trial courtâ€™s ruling only when there is no evidence in the record\r\nto support it.&nbsp; Jinks v. Richland County,\r\n355 S.C. 341, 585 S.E.2d 281 (2003).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Short\r\nHorn\r\nSouth\r\nCarolina Code Ann. Â§ 58-15-910 (1976) requires a train sound its bell and\r\nwhistle beginning 1,500 feet before a crossing and continuing until the engine\r\nhas crossed the intersection.&nbsp; CSX concedes the engineer did not sound the\r\nhorn for 1,500 feet before the Jordan Street Crossing, but rather did so for\r\nonly 564 feet.&nbsp; Mrs. Medlin, the driver, testified she did not hear the\r\nhorn, and Plaintiff offered testimony from an expert that given the sound\r\nproofing in the automobile and the fact that the windows were rolled up and the\r\nair conditioning on, the whistle was inaudible to Mrs. Medlin at any\r\ndistance.&nbsp; Finally, Plaintiff offered a witness who testified the train â€œtootedâ€\r\nonly twice before entering the crossing.\r\nIf a railroad fails to give the\r\nrequired signals at a crossing, and this failure contributes to an injury, then\r\nthe railroad is liable for all damages.&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-17-1440\r\n(1976).&nbsp; Here, the jury could have found, based upon Mrs. Medlinâ€™s\r\ntestimony, that the engineer failed to sound the horn.&nbsp; Further, despite\r\nthe audiologistâ€™s testimony that the car passengers could not have heard the\r\nhorn, the jury could have found that had the horn been sounded, Mrs. Medlin\r\nwould have heard it.&nbsp; See, e.g., State v. Johnson, 66 S.C.\r\n23, 44 S.E. 58 (1903) (jury may properly disregard expert testimony).\r\nThe directed verdict was properly\r\ndenied on the â€œshort hornâ€ theory.&nbsp; Jinks, supra.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSight Line\r\nPlaintiff presented testimony from\r\nseveral witnesses that overgrown vegetation at the Jordan Street Crossing\r\nobstructed driversâ€™ views at the time of the accident.&nbsp; Plaintiff also\r\nintroduced photos and videos taken within twenty-four hours after the accident\r\ndemonstrating the conditions at the crossing.&nbsp; CSX claims, however, that\r\nsince it was not shown that a regulatory agency had deemed the vegetation at\r\nthat crossing unacceptable on the day of the accident, a directed verdict should\r\nhave been granted.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§\r\n58-17-1450 (1976) requires county supervisors to inspect railroad crossings at\r\nleast once a year, and to give written notice to the railroad of any dangerous\r\nconditions.&nbsp; Section 58-17-1350 requires the railroad to maintain all grade\r\nlevel crossings located in a municipality in a safe manner and permits municipal\r\nofficers to order modifications to the crossing.&nbsp; In Armitage v.\r\nSeaboard Air Line Ry. Co., 166 S.C. 21, 164 S.E. 169 (1932), the plaintiff\r\nalleged that the railroad had not maintained safe crossings as required by\r\nstatutes, and that this failure resulted in the plaintiffâ€™s decedentâ€™s death\r\nat a crossing.&nbsp; The trial judge directed a verdict because there was no\r\nevidence that the condition of the crossing contributed to the accident.&nbsp;\r\nOn appeal, the Court first noted that the plaintiff failed to specify which\r\nstatute the railroad allegedly failed to observe.&nbsp; Speculating that it may\r\nhave been the predecessor to Â§ 58-17-1450 or Â§ 58-17-1350, the Court noted\r\nthere was no evidence that the railroad had failed to comply with any\r\ngovernmental order to improve the crossing.&nbsp; CSX contends Armitage\r\nstands for the proposition that it is insulated from liability for crossing\r\naccidents so long as it is in compliance with all regulatory requests.&nbsp; We\r\ndisagree.\r\nIn Crawford v. Atlantic Coast\r\nLine R. Co., 179 S.C. 264, 184 S.E. 569 (1936), decided four years after Armitage,\r\nthe Court asked whether Â§ 58-17-1350 (also cited in Armitage) merely\r\ncodified the railroadsâ€™ common law duty to maintain a safe crossing or whether\r\nit created a statutory duty coexisting with the common law duty.&nbsp; Crawford\r\nwas concerned with breach of duty and negligence and not with regulatory\r\nissues.&nbsp; We do not read Armitage to limit railroad crossing\r\nliability to situations where a railroad was on notice of an unsafe condition by\r\nvirtue of an official government report.&nbsp; Rather, the Armitage Court, having been left to speculate as to the\r\nplaintiffâ€™s theory, was merely highlighting the lack of evidence of breach of\r\nany duty.&nbsp; Pursuant to Crawford, the railroadâ€™s negligent failure\r\nto maintain a safe crossing violates a statutory duty regardless whether there\r\nhas been any regulatory action.\r\nThere was evidence that CSXâ€™s\r\nfailure to control the weed growth at the Jordan\r\nStreet crossing rendered that intersection unsafe.&nbsp; The directed verdict\r\nwas properly denied.&nbsp; Jinks, supra.\r\nEVIDENTIARY\r\nISSUES\r\nCSX complains of numerous\r\nevidentiary errors allegedly committed by the trial judge.&nbsp; CSX points out\r\nthat a number of these alleged errors occurred as the result of the trial courtâ€™s\r\nrefusal to bifurcate liability and punitive damages.&nbsp; CSX failed to appeal\r\nfrom the bifurcation order, and therefore the propriety of that ruling is not\r\nbefore us.&nbsp; E.g., S. C.Coastal Conserv. League v. S.C. Depâ€™t of\r\nHealth and Enviro. Control, Op. No. 25944 (S.C. Sup. Ct.\r\nfiled February 22, 2005)(unappealed ruling, whether correct or not, is law of\r\nthe case).\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSubsequent Remedial Measures\r\nIn 2000, CSX initiated an aggressive\r\nprogram to clear cut all passive crossings.&nbsp; The Jordan Street Crossing was\r\nclear cut shortly before trial.&nbsp; At the in limine hearing,[4] CSX sought to exclude evidence that\r\nthis crossing had been clear cut, contending it was inadmissible as a subsequent\r\nremedial measure under Rule 407, SCRE.&nbsp; Plaintiff argued the clear cutting\r\nwas â€œadmissible to show that [CSX] should have done it [before the accident],â€\r\ni.e., as proof of negligence.&nbsp; The trial judge ultimately decided to admit\r\nthe evidence, relying upon in Reiland v. Southland Equip. Serv., Inc.,\r\n330 S.C. 617, 500 S.E.2d 145 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\nRule 407,\r\nSCRE provides:\r\n\r\n  When, after an event, measures are\r\n  taken which, if taken previously, would have made the event less likely to\r\n  occur, evidence of the subsequent measures is not admissible to prove\r\n  negligence or culpable conduct in connection with the event.&nbsp; This rule\r\n  does not require the exclusion of evidence of subsequent measures when offered\r\n  for another purpose, such as proving ownership, control, or feasibility of\r\n  precautionary measures, if controverted, or impeachment.\r\n\r\nThis rule permits admission of\r\nsubsequent remedial measures only when necessary to demonstrate such things as\r\nownership, control, impeachment, or feasibility of precautionary measures, if\r\ncontested.&nbsp; These were not issues in this case.&nbsp;&nbsp; In Reiland,\r\nthe Court of Appeals seems to have adopted a narrow view of Rule 407 and held\r\nthat only measures taken in direct response to the accident qualify for\r\nexclusion under the rule.&nbsp; In our view, this narrow interpretation ignores\r\nthe literal language of the rule.&nbsp; We hold that Rule 407 bars the\r\nintroduction of any change, repair, or precaution that under the plaintiffâ€™s\r\ntheory would have made the accident less likely to happen, unless the evidence\r\nis offered for another purpose.\r\nThe evidence of the clear cutting of Jordan Street was inadmissible at this trial\r\nunder Rule 407.&nbsp; There were numerous witnesses, photos, and two videos\r\ndemonstrating the condition of the crossing on the day of the accident.&nbsp;\r\nThe evidence of the clear cutting was not necessary for the jury to understand\r\nthe conditions at the time of the accident.&nbsp; Whether this evidence alone\r\nwould require reversal is a close question.&nbsp; The sight line question was\r\nhotly contested, and to the extent this subsequent clear cutting evidence was\r\nused to show negligence, it prejudiced CSX.&nbsp; There can be no doubt,\r\nhowever, that the erroneous admission of the evidence coupled with the bridge\r\nrepair evidence and argument requires a new trial.&nbsp; Whether this evidence\r\nmay be admissible at a subsequent trial depends upon whether any of the\r\nexceptions in Rule 407, SCRE, applies.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nComputer Animation\r\nA\r\ncomputer animation is admissible if it is: 1) authentic under Rule 901, SCRE; 2)\r\nrelevant under Rules 401 and 402, SCRE; 3) a fair and accurate representation of\r\nthe evidence; and 4) more probative than prejudicial under Rule 403, SCRE.&nbsp; Clark\r\nv. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 529 S.E.2d 528 (2000).&nbsp; When an animation is\r\nadmitted, the trial court is to give a cautionary instruction that the video\r\nrepresents only a recreation of one partyâ€™s version of events, and may call\r\nattention to any assumptions upon which the recreation is based. Id.&nbsp; The trial court has broad discretion in determining\r\nwhether to admit an animation, and its decision will be reversed on appeal only\r\nfor an abuse of that discretion.&nbsp; Id.\r\nCSX\r\nargues the trial court erred in admitting Plaintiffâ€™s computer animation of\r\nthe accident because that animation did not fairly and accurately convey the\r\naccident and the accident scene.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp; Specifically, CSX\r\ncomplains because the animation shows the car stopped for only 4.8 seconds while\r\nthe victim said she stopped for ten seconds, and because the vegetation is\r\nenhanced in the video.&nbsp; CSX has not shown an abuse of discretion.&nbsp; As\r\nfor the vegetation, the jury heard testimony from several individuals about the\r\nvegetation at the crossing on the day of the accident and had a video from a\r\nrescue worker at the scene, and one taken by the Plaintiff the next day\r\npresented for comparison purposes.&nbsp; As for the length of the stop, the\r\ndiscrepancy was extensively explored before the jury.\r\nWe find\r\nno abuse of discretion in the admission of this animation.&nbsp; Clark v.\r\nCantrell, supra.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOther Crossings\r\nPlaintiff was permitted to introduce\r\na compilation of approximately 200 â€œnotices of deficiencyâ€ received by CSX\r\nfrom the South Carolina Department of Transportation over the period between\r\n1995 and 2002.&nbsp; It is unclear at what point or on what ground the trial\r\ncourt admitted this exhibit.&nbsp; It is the appellantâ€™s burden to present a\r\nsufficient record for appellate review.&nbsp; State v. 192 Coin-Operated\r\nVideo Games, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000).&nbsp; CSX has not met this\r\nburden with regard to the compilation, although we note these records would be\r\nrelevant, if at all, only to punitive damages.\r\nCSX also complains that Plaintiffâ€™s\r\ntraffic engineering expert was erroneously permitted to testify in detail to two\r\nother lawsuits involving accidents at CSX crossings in South Carolina where the allegations were that sight lines were\r\nobstructed.&nbsp; CSX argued at trial these accident settings were too\r\ndissimilar to be probative.&nbsp; Plaintiff countered that evidence of the other\r\ncrossing accidents was admissible on the issue of punitive damages.&nbsp; It\r\nappears from the record that extensive evidence of these accidents was admitted\r\nwithout any instruction limiting the jury to considering them in the context of\r\npunitive damages.\r\nThe trial judge erred in admitting\r\nevidence of other accidents at other crossings to prove this accident occurred\r\nas the result of CSXâ€™s negligence.&nbsp; The evidence may be admissible at a\r\nsubsequent trial in aid of Plaintiffâ€™s punitive damages claim.\r\nD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NTSB\r\nSafety Recommendation\r\nCSX objected to the admission of a\r\nNational Transportation Safety Board report made to the Federal Railroad\r\nAdministration (FRA) on the grounds of relevance.&nbsp; Prior to that objection,\r\nCSX had permitted Plaintiffâ€™s expert to testify using the report for several\r\npages without objection.&nbsp; Further, there was no contemporaneous objection\r\nto Plaintiffâ€™s reference to the report in its opening statement.&nbsp; CSX, by\r\nits untimely objection, waived its right to complain about this issue in this\r\nappeal.&nbsp; Taylor v. Medenica, 324 S.C. 200, 479 S.E.2d 35 (1996).\r\nE.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFRA Report\r\nCSX also argues the court erred in\r\nadmitting a FRA report dated February 1998 because this report, while directed\r\nto CSX, did not address crossing maintenance.&nbsp; We agree with CSX that this\r\nevidence was not relevant to liability.&nbsp; We express no opinion on the\r\nextent it may be relevant to punitive damages under the standards announced in Campbell.\r\nPUNITIVE DAMAGES\r\nCSX\r\nargues that the punitive damage award should be reversed because 1) it was\r\nunconstitutionally based on conduct unrelated to the Jordan Street Crossing\r\naccident; 2) the jury instructions were erroneous; 3) CSXâ€™s net worth was\r\nimproperly used as a basis for the award; and 4) there was no evidence of\r\nunlawful, wanton, or reckless activity with regard to the Jordan Street\r\nCrossing.&nbsp;\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDirected Verdict\r\nTaking\r\nthe last issue first, CSX complains that the punitive damages issue should have\r\nbeen resolved by directed verdict or judgment notwithstanding the verdict\r\nbecause there was no clear and convincing evidence of recklessness or\r\nwillfulness with respect to this accident and this crossing.&nbsp; We disagree.\r\nThere was\r\nno question but that the engineer failed to sound his horn for the statutorily\r\nprescribed distance, and there was evidence that the vegetation at the Jordan\r\nStreet Crossing was so overgrown that a traveler had to pull onto the tracks to\r\nsee whether a train was approaching.&nbsp; From this evidence alone, a jury\r\ncould find that CSX was reckless in maintaining the crossing.&nbsp; The issue of\r\npunitive damages was properly submitted to the jury at this trial.\r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEvidence\r\nIn State\r\nFarm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Campbell, 538 U.S. 408, 123 S.Ct. 1513, 155\r\nL.Ed.2d 585 (2003), decided after the trial in this case, the United States\r\nSupreme Court discussed the constitutional limitations on the use of punitive\r\ndamages to punish defendants for conduct not related to the harm suffered by the\r\nplaintiffs.&nbsp; Further, the Court cautioned against punishing a defendant for\r\nconduct in another jurisdiction, even where that conduct was unlawful.&nbsp; In Durham\r\nv. Vinson, Â­Â­supra, this Court applied Campbell\r\nto a case tried prior to that decision and found the improper admission of a\r\nsingle piece of unrelated evidence required reversal.\r\nIt is\r\nclear that much of the evidence of acts in other jurisdictions, including CSX\r\nand other railroads, and of acts unrelated to crossing safety in South\r\nCarolina admitted in this trial is not constitutionally permissible under Campbell.&nbsp; We reverse the punitive damage award and\r\ninstruct that on retrial, evidence sought to be admitted on the issue of\r\npunitive damages should be closely scrutinized for its relationship to the\r\nparticular harm suffered by the Plaintiff.\r\nC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNet Worth\r\nCSX\r\ncomplains the jury was erroneously allowed to focus on its net worth, citing to\r\nPlaintiffâ€™s closing argument.&nbsp; Since there was no contemporaneous\r\nobjection, this issue is not preserved for appellate review.&nbsp; Dial v.\r\nNiggel Assoc., Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 509 S.E.2d 269 (1998) (subject to very\r\nlimited exceptions, a contemporaneous objection is required to preserve closing\r\nargument issue for appeal).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe order\r\ndenying Plaintiff relief on the Â§ 58-17-3420 claim is affirmed.&nbsp; The jury\r\nverdicts are reversed, and the matter is remanded for a new trial.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nIN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œA Crossbuck Sign is one of the oldest warning devices.&nbsp; It\r\nis a white regulatory, X-shaped sign with the words â€œRailroad Crossingâ€ in\r\nblack lettering. . . .[it] is a passive yield sign [and]. . ..is considered the\r\nsame as a â€˜Yield Sign.â€™â€ http://www.oli.org/ol_basics/engineering/crossbuck.html.\r\n[2] There is no contention on appeal that the train was exceeding the\r\npermissible speed limit.\r\n[3] Although not raised by the parties, we are constrained to address\r\nseveral issues raised by the procedures followed here.&nbsp; First, we question\r\nwhether a violation of 3420 gives rise to an action under 3980/3990.&nbsp; While\r\n3420 imposes a duty on railroads to construct bridges in a safe manner, e.g.\r\nRembert v. South Carolina Ry. Co., 31 S.C. 309, 9 S.E. 968 (1859), and to\r\nmaintain those bridges so that they may be safely traversed, e.g. Thompson\r\nv. Seaboard Air Line Ry. Co., 78 S.C. 384, 58 S.E. 1094 (1900), there is no\r\nexplicit requirement in that statute that a railroad maintain a bridge in\r\nperpetuity.&nbsp; We therefore question whether the failure to repair the Green Street Bridge\r\nwas a â€œwrongful act.â€&nbsp; In any case, precedent establishes that a\r\ntraveler injured by a railroadâ€™s breach of a statutory duty imposed by 3420\r\nhas an ordinary negligence claim, rather than a 3980/3990 claim.&nbsp; Compare\r\nRembert, supra; Thompson, supra.\r\nSections 3980 and 3990 appear to\r\nprovide a remedy where a railroadâ€™s violation of a statutory duty imposed by\r\nthe General Railroad Law does not result in tortious injury.&nbsp; See, e.g.,\r\nFoggie v. CSX Transp., Inc., 313 S.C. 98, 431 S.E.2d 587 (1993) (removal\r\nof crossing connecting two parcels bisected by railroad is obstruction of way in\r\nviolation of Â§ 58-17-1330 compensable under 3980/3990); Kinsey v. Southern\r\nRy. Co., 174 S.C. 192, 177 S.E. 149 (1934) (action for damages under 3980\r\nfor excessive fare charge in violation of Â§ 58-17-1990); compare Medlin\r\nv. Southern Ry. Co., 143 S.C. 91, 141 S.E. 185 (1928) (3980 not applicable\r\nwhere passenger treated tortiously by conductor).&nbsp;\r\nFurther, it appears that the proper\r\nreading of 3980 and 3990 is that 3980 gives rise to an action for damages,\r\ntriable to a jury, and that 3990 simply gives the circuit court authority to\r\nimpose equitable remedies (i.e. injunctions) in an action for damages brought\r\npursuant to 3980.&nbsp; To read the statutes as the parties here did, to require\r\nthe judge to hear the suit in equity and then award money damages, would raise a\r\nconstitutional question.&nbsp; See S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14 (right to\r\njury trial); see e.g. Lester v. Dawson,\r\n327 S.C. 263, 491 S.E.2d 242 (1997) (the right to a jury trial generally depends\r\non whether an action is legal or equitable).\r\n[4] It appears from other portions of the record that there was an\r\nagreement that the parties did not have to object to the admission of evidence\r\nruled upon at the motion in limine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26005","title":"Garvin v.

Â§ 24-13-410 (Supp. 2004), and\r\ncorrectly imposed a mandatory consecutive sentence.&nbsp; We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner escaped from the Barnwell County\r\njail while he was incarcerated as a pretrial detainee.&nbsp; Petitioner jumped\r\nfrom a window and over a gate and was later captured in Florida.&nbsp;\r\nThe plea judge, assistant solicitor,\r\nand Petitionerâ€™s plea counsel discussed whether the judge was required\r\nby S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-410 (Supp. 2004) to impose a consecutive\r\nsentence on the escape conviction.&nbsp; The judge and attorneys ultimately\r\nagreed a consecutive sentence was mandatory even though Petitioner was a\r\npretrial detainee who was not presently serving a prison sentence at the time of\r\nthe escape.&nbsp; Consequently, Petitionerâ€™s plea attorney did not object to\r\nthe imposition of a consecutive sentence.&nbsp;\r\nPetitionerâ€™s primary contention in\r\nhis PCR application and at the hearing was that plea counsel was ineffective in\r\nfailing to assert that he should not face a mandatory, consecutive\r\nsentence for escape because he was a pretrial detainee at the time of his\r\nescape.&nbsp; According to Petitioner, no â€œoriginalâ€ sentence existed at the\r\ntime of his escape.&nbsp; Therefore, Petitioner contends the statute did not\r\nrequire a consecutive escape sentence and it should have been imposed\r\nconcurrently with the other, simultaneously imposed sentences.&nbsp;\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Did the PCR judge correctly\r\n  interpret the escape statute to mandate the&nbsp; imposition of a consecutive\r\n  sentence, where the escapee was a pretrial detainee and the escape sentence\r\n  was made consecutive to other, simultaneously imposed sentences?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner contends the PCR judge\r\nerred in rejecting his argument the consecutive sentence was illegally imposed.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 24-13-410 provides:\r\n\r\n  A)&nbsp; It is unlawful for a\r\n  person, lawfully confined in prison or upon the public works of a county or\r\n  while in the custody of a superintendent, guard, or officer, to escape, to\r\n  attempt to escape, or to have in his possession tools or weapons which may be\r\n  used to facilitate an escape.\r\n  (B)&nbsp; A person who violates\r\n  this section is guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, must be imprisoned\r\n  not less than one year nor more than fifteen years.\r\n  (C)&nbsp; The term of imprisonment\r\n  is consecutive to the original sentence and to other sentences\r\n  previously imposed upon the escapee by a court of this State.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIn order to establish a claim of\r\nineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must prove counselâ€™s\r\nperformance was deficient and the deficient performance prejudiced the applicantâ€™s\r\ncase.&nbsp; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. \r\n668, 104 S.Ct. 2052, 80 L.Ed.2d 674 (1984); Cherry v. State, 300 S.C.\r\n115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).&nbsp; Where there has been a guilty plea, the\r\napplicant must prove counselâ€™s representation fell below the standard of\r\nreasonableness and, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, there is a\r\nreasonable probability he would not have pleaded guilty and would have insisted\r\non going to trial.&nbsp; Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. \r\n52, 106 S.Ct. 366, 88 L.Ed.2d 203 (1985); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C.\r\n539, 402 S.E.2d 484 (1991).&nbsp; In determining guilty plea issues, it is\r\nproper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as evidence at the PCR\r\nhearing.&nbsp; Harres v. Leeke, 282 S.C. 131, 318 S.E.2d 360 (1984).\r\nThe Court will uphold the findings\r\nof the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to support\r\nthem.&nbsp; Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 525 S.E.2d 514 (2000); Cherry\r\nv. State, supra.&nbsp; The Court will not uphold the findings when\r\nthere is no probative evidence to support them.&nbsp; Holland\r\nv. State, 322 S.C. 111, 470 S.E.2d 378 (1996).\r\nHowever, in a case raising a novel\r\nissue of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question of law with no\r\nparticular deference to the trial court.&nbsp; Osprey v. Cabana Ltd. Partn.,\r\n340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000); Iâ€™On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 718\r\n(2000).&nbsp; The Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when it is\r\ncontrolled by an error of law.&nbsp; Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 594\r\nS.E.2d 462, 465 (2004); Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, 526 S.E.2d\r\n222, 225 (2000). &nbsp;\r\nIt is undisputed Section 24-13-410\r\napplies in Petitionerâ€™s case.&nbsp; See Bing v. Harvey, 274 S.C.\r\n216, 262 S.E.2d 42 (1980) (escape from the lawful pretrial custody of a sheriff\r\nconstitutes a violation of Section 24-13-410); accord Edget v. State,\r\n791 So.2d 311 (Miss. App. 2001) (escape statute applies to pretrial\r\ndetainees).&nbsp; It also is undisputed the statutory language indicates the\r\nLegislature intended for any escapee serving a prison sentence to serve\r\nadditional, consecutive time for an escape conviction.\r\nIt is less clear, however, whether\r\nthe Legislature intended for the requirement of a consecutive sentence contained\r\nin Section 24-13-410(C) to apply to pretrial detainees.&nbsp; Subsection (C)\r\nprovides that â€œ[t]he term of imprisonment is consecutive to the original\r\nsentence and to other sentences previously imposed upon the escapee\r\nby a court of this Stateâ€ (emphasis added).&nbsp; The Petitioner argues the\r\nuse of the emphasized terms indicates the subsection may apply only to convicted\r\nand sentenced prisoners - not to pretrial detainees.&nbsp; We disagree.&nbsp;\r\nWe agree with the interpretation\r\nendorsed by the plea and PCR judges, and conclude a mandatory consecutive\r\nsentence is required for both escapees serving a prison sentence and escapees\r\nwho are pretrial detainees.&nbsp; Therefore, the PCR judge correctly denied\r\nPetitionerâ€™s application.\r\nThe\r\ncardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintent of the Legislature.&nbsp; E.g. Mitchell v. Holler,\r\n311 S.C. 406, 429 S.E.2d 793 (1993). &nbsp;A statute should be given a\r\nreasonable and practical construction consistent with the purpose and policy\r\nexpressed in the statute.&nbsp; Abell v. Bell, 229 S.C. 1, 4, 91 SE.2d 548, 550\r\n(1956).&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe\r\nconclude the Legislature intended the term â€œoriginal sentenceâ€ to mean the\r\nsentence related to the charges from which the detainee attempted to escape,\r\nregardless of when the sentencing occurred.&nbsp; In other words, a sentence is\r\nstill â€œoriginalâ€ even if a defendant has not been formerly sentenced by the\r\ncourt at the time of his escape.&nbsp; Therefore, the term â€œoriginalâ€ does\r\nnot refer to the timing of the sentencing or the status of the defendant.&nbsp;\r\nInstead, â€œoriginalâ€ simply refers to the first sentence arising from the\r\ncharges on which the defendant is being held at the time he attempts to or\r\neffects an escape.&nbsp;&nbsp; This result is consistent with the intent of the\r\nLegislature, when our statutory law is considered in its entirety.&nbsp; In\r\ndesignating escape a felony, the Legislature clearly considers escape a serious\r\ncrime resulting in strict penal consequences.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe also agree with the State that to\r\nhold a pre-trial detainee who escapes from jail cannot receive a consecutive\r\nsentence for his escape would lead to an absurd result.&nbsp; There would be no\r\nadditional incentive for a pre-trial detainee not to escape if there could be no\r\nfurther consequences for attempted escape if the defendant were found guilty of\r\nthe underlying charge.\r\nIt would be nonsensical to conclude\r\na convicted defendant who escapes is subject to a mandatory consecutive\r\nsentence, but a pre-trial detainee who escapes and is later convicted of the\r\nunderlying crime is not.&nbsp; That would be so plainly absurd that it could not\r\npossibly have been intended by the Legislature.&nbsp; See Kiriakides\r\nv. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364,\r\n366 (1994).&nbsp; In construing the statute as a whole, we escape the absurdity\r\nand give efficacy to Legislative intent.\r\nThe dissentâ€™s reliance on Bing\r\nv. Harvey, 274 S.C. 216, 218, 262 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1980) is unfounded.&nbsp;\r\nIn Bing, the Court addressed whether the previous version of Section\r\n24-13-410 applied at all to pre-trial detainees.&nbsp; The Court held Section\r\n24-13-410 does apply to pre-trial detainees.&nbsp; Whether the sentence for\r\nescape was consecutive was not in issue.&nbsp; However, the Courtâ€™s discussion\r\nis instructive.&nbsp; The Court noted the â€œoriginal sentenceâ€ language â€œdistinct\r\nfrom the definition of the offense, merely establishes certain limitations on\r\nthe punishment where a violator is subject[1] to a pre-existing court sentence.â€\r\n(emphasis added).&nbsp; Clearly Petitioner was subject to a sentence.&nbsp; That\r\nit has not yet been imposed is not relevant.&nbsp;\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm\r\nthe denial of post-conviction relief and conclude trial counsel was not\r\nineffective because Section 24-13-410(C) requires a mandatory consecutive\r\nsentence when a pre-trial detainee escapes.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and MOORE, J.,\r\nconcur.&nbsp; WALLER, dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:&nbsp; I\r\nrespectfully dissent.&nbsp; Section 24-13-410 (C) requires the imposition of a\r\nconsecutive sentence only when the person was serving his original or another\r\npreviously imposed sentence at the time of the escape.&nbsp; In Bing v.\r\nHarvey,&nbsp; 274 S.C. 216, 218, 262 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1980),&nbsp; the Court\r\nheld that an escape from lawful pretrial custody constituted the offense of\r\nescape under the previous version of Â§ 24-13-410.&nbsp; The Court\r\ninterpreted the â€œoriginal sentence&quot; language of the statute and held it\r\nâ€œmerely establishes certain limitations on punishment where a violator is\r\nsubject to a pre-existing court sentence. Where one convicted of escape is\r\nsubject to no prior sentence, these special provisions do not apply.â€&nbsp; Id.&nbsp; Likewise, here, subsection (C) applies only to\r\nviolators subject to a pre-existing court sentence - not pretrial\r\ndetainees.&nbsp; Here, petitioner was a pre-trial detainee.&nbsp; Thus, the plea\r\nand PCR judges erroneously applied the consecutive sentence requirement of\r\nsubsection (C).&nbsp; Petitionerâ€™s plea counsel erred in failing to challenge\r\nthe plea judgeâ€™s interpretation of the statute and object to the imposition of\r\na mandatory consecutive sentence and, but for the erroneous interpretation of\r\nthe statute, petitioner would not have pled guilty and accepted a mandatory\r\nconsecutive sentence on the escape charge.&nbsp; Accordingly, I would reverse\r\nthe denial of PCR.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œSubjectâ€ is defined as â€œhaving a contingent relation to\r\nsomething and usually dependent on such relation for final form, validity, or\r\nsignificance.â€ Websterâ€™s Third New International Dictionary 2275 (8th\r\ned. 1981).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26006","title":"G &amp; P Trucking v.
