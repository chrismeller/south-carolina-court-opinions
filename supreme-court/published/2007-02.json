Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was indicted for distributing crack cocaine after he sold drugs to an undercover agent on July 26, 2000.Â  He pled guilty on March 21, 2001, and was sentenced to five years as a second offender pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(B)(2) (Supp. 2005). Â The offense used to enhance his status to second offender occurred on July 28, 2000, two days after the offense here.Â  On that date, respondent was searched pursuant to arrest on an unrelated charge and found to be in possession of crack cocaine.Â  He pled guilty to possession of crack on September 26, 2000.Â  \r\nRespondent subsequently brought this PCR action claiming he would not have pled guilty had he known he would be sentenced as a second offender.Â  He argued that because the date of the offense used to enhance his punishment occurred after the date of the offense in this case, he should not have been treated as a second offender.Â  The PCR judge found counsel ineffective for failing to raise the issue at the plea hearing and vacated respondentâ€™s plea.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Does the date of the crime determine second-offender status?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondent was sentenced as a second offender under Â§ 44-53-375(B)(2).[1] Â A â€œsecond offenseâ€ is defined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-470[2] as follows:\r\n\r\n  An offense is considered a second or subsequent offense, if, prior to his conviction of the offense, the offender has at any time been convicted under this article . . . .\r\n\r\nAt the time of respondentâ€™s plea, he had a prior conviction under Â§ 44-53-375(A), a provision in the same article as Â§ 44-53-470; therefore, under the plain language of Â§ 44-53-470, respondent was properly sentenced as a second offender.Â  See Patterson v. State, 359 S.C. 115, 597 S.E.2d 150 (2004) (Â§ 44-53-470 determines second offender status for conviction under Â§ 44-53-375(A)).Â  Under Â§ 44-53-470, the timing of the crimes is irrelevant to the determination of a subsequent offense so long as there is a prior conviction.[3]\r\nIn conclusion, because respondent was properly treated as a second offender, the PCR judge erred in finding counsel ineffective.Â  Accordingly, the grant of relief is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] This section provides in pertinent part:\r\n(B) A person who . . . distributes . . . crack cocaine . . . upon conviction:\r\n. . .\r\n(2) for a second offense . . . the offender must be imprisoned for not more than twenty-five years and fined not less than fifty thousand dollars. . . .\r\n[2]This section was subsequently modified in 2005. \r\n[3] Respondent has never claimed the two crimes were part of a continuous course of conduct.Â  Cf.

Haskell, III, of Spartanburg, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Walter McSherry and the South Carolina Public Interest Foundation (collectively â€œAppellantsâ€) appeal an order of the circuit court denying their request for declaratory relief and holding that Respondent, Spartanburg County Council (â€œCouncilâ€), properly enacted a $25.00 road maintenance fee ordinance.Â  Â We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nAt a publicly advertised Council meeting in February 2005, council member Ken Huckaby made a motion to adopt a road user fee of $25.00 for Spartanburg County.Â  The county attorney moved to have the â€œfirst reading of an Ordinance to adopt the road fee by title only,â€ and advised Council that he would have something drafted up for the next meeting.Â  At the time, neither the title nor the ordinance was written.Â  By Councilâ€™s next meeting, however, the proposed ordinance had been reduced to writing.Â  In late February 2005, Council held a public hearing to discuss the ordinance and the ordinance received second reading.Â  The ordinance received third reading in March 2005. Â The ordinance became effective July 1, 2005.Â  \r\nAppellants instituted this complaint for declaratory relief, contending the ordinance was not lawfully enacted because it did not exist in written form at the time of the first reading.Â  The circuit court upheld the ordinance, finding Council had sufficiently complied with the three reading requirement of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-120 (1986).[1]Â  \r\nAppellants filed this appeal, and we certified this case from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. Â Appellants present the following issue for this Courtâ€™s review:\r\n\r\n  Did the circuit court err in holding the road maintenance fee ordinance was properly enacted?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-120 (1986) sets forth procedures to be used by County governments in adopting ordinances.Â  It provides, in part:\r\n\r\n  The council shall take legislative action by ordinance which may be introduced by any member.Â  With the exception of emergency ordinances, all ordinances shall be read at three public meetings of council on three separate days with an interval of not less than seven days between the second and third readings. \r\n\r\nId.Â  Furthermore, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-110 (1986) provides that â€œcouncil shall determine its own rules and order of business.â€Â  Pursuant to Â§ 4-9-110, Spartanburg adopted the Spartanburg County Council Rules of Procedure.Â  Article 9 of those rules provides, in part, as follows:\r\n\r\n  9-1Â Â Â  ORDINANCES AND RESOLUTIONS IN GENERAL (4-9-120):Â  The Council shall take legislative action by ordinance. . . \r\n  9-2Â Â Â  READINGS: with the exception of emergency ordinances, all ordinances shall be read at three public meetings of the Council on three separate days with an interval of not less than seven days between the second and third reading; provided that a verbatim reading of an ordinance shall not be required unless such reading is requested by a member.\r\n  9-3Â Â Â  FIRST READING:Â  An ordinance may be introduced for first reading at any meeting of the Council by title only.[2]Â  No vote shall be taken and no debate or amendment shall be in order.Â  The ordinance shall be referred by the Chairperson to an appropriate committee or to the Council as a whole. \r\n  9-4Â Â Â  SECOND READING:Â  Reports on a proposed ordinance shall be presented at the next meeting after the first reading, . . .Â  Prior to the second reading, a draft of the text of the ordinance shall be delivered to every member.Â  After the proposed ordinance shall have been read, amendments shall be in order . . . . Any member of the Council may require that amendments be in writing. \r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nAppellants acknowledge that an ordinance may validly be introduced for first reading by title only.Â  However, Appellants assert that the procedure in this case was fundamentally flawed inasmuch as there was no ordinance in existence at the time of the first reading. Â Although we are disconcerted by the methodology utilized by Council in this matter, we disagree with Appellantsâ€™ argument.\r\nOur precedent provides:\r\n\r\n  [T]he first reading of a bill is merely a formal matter on which no vote is taken, and . . . Â the construction placed by the Legislature upon its own procedure for so many years should be regarded as the correct interpretation. The courts of almost all of our states have adopted the rule that the legislative construction placed upon doubtful constitutional provisions is entitled to great weight and consideration, and raises a strong presumption that it is correct, and will generally be adopted by the courts.Â  \r\n\r\nThompson v. Livingston, 116 S.C. 412, 419, 107 S.E.2d 581, 583 (1921).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[i]n reviewing the discretionary decision of a legislative body, our courts have been loath to substitute their judgment for that of elected representatives. Such decisions should not be upset on appeal unless [they are] arbitrary, unreasonable, in obvious abuse of discretion, or in excess of lawfully delegated power.â€Â  Sloan v. Greenville County, 356 S.C. 531, 555-56, 590 S.E.2d 338, 351 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nAs noted, Councilâ€™s Rules of Procedure Section 9-3 allows for a first reading by title only, and provides that the matter may then be referred to a committee.Â Â  Section 9-4 then allows that, prior to a second reading, a draft of the text of the ordinance shall be delivered to every member.Â  Implicit in this language is the possibility that the ordinance may be drafted in between the first and second readings.Â  Importantly, nothing in the Code or in Article VIII of the South Carolina Constitution, which authorizes and establishes Home Rule, requires that an ordinance be in written form when it receives first reading.Â  Thus, there is neither a constitutional provision nor a statutory requirement on which this Court could base an invalidation of Councilâ€™s rules and procedures.\r\nThe minutes of the first meeting wherein the road maintenance fee was suggested reveal that Council discussed the proposed ordinance at length and that all members were well aware of the nature and reason for the road maintenance fee.Â  As noted by the circuit court, â€œconsidering [Article 9] as a whole, it is clear that the requirements of this Article envision a process where ordinances can be developed from a possibly conceptual idea (section 9-3), to where a draft text of a proposed ordinance is developed and modified (section 9-4).â€Â  Although the better practice may have been for the title to be in writing at the time of the first reading, we cannot say that this alone caused the ordinanceâ€™s enactment to be invalid.Â  Cf. Bauer v. South Carolina State Hous. Auth., 271 S.C. 219, 231, 246 S.E.2d 869, 875 (1978) (legislation is not invalid simply because this Court feels a different methodology would have been more effective). Â \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.Â  \r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr. and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Council has since enacted a similar road maintenance fee ordinance and began collecting the fee under that ordinance. Â This second ordinance has not been challenged in this case.Â  Accordingly, the only fees at issue on appeal are those collected for several months under the initial ordinance.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Subsequent to the trial courtâ€™s issuing its final order, Council amended this language to read, â€œ[t]he title to the ordinance shall be in writing at the time the ordinance is introduced and shall disclose the object of the ordinance.â€\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26259","title":"Marcum v.

Heyward Clarkson III, Charles F. Turner, Jr., and Sean A. Scoopmire, all of Clarkson, Walsh, Rheney &amp; Turner, of Greenville, for Petitioner.\r\nGeorge J. Kefalos, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  These cases ask whether an adult social host who serves alcoholic beverages to an underage guest, that is, a person between the ages of 18 and 20 who is not a minor but who cannot, in most instances, legally consume alcohol, owes a duty to the guest or to third parties injured or killed by the guest in an alcohol related incident.Â  We recognize today this common law duty:\r\n\r\n  An adult social host who knowingly and intentionally serves, or causes to be served, an alcoholic beverage to a person he knows or reasonably should know is between the ages of 18 and 20 is liable to the person served and to any other person for damages proximately resulting from the hostâ€™s service of alcohol.[1]\r\n\r\nBecause our decision today creates tort liability where formerly there was none, a social host will be liable only for claims arising after the effective date of this decision.Â  See, e.g., Toth v. Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 377 S.E.2d 584 (1989).[2] We therefore affirm the circuit court order in Marcum which granted summary judgment to the social host defendants, and reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in Barnes[3] which affirmed a jury verdict against the host defendants.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn light of our disposition of these two appeals, we engage in only a brief review of the facts.\r\nA. Marcum\r\nThe Bowdens hosted a late afternoon cookout at their home, inviting mostly business acquaintances.Â  The decedent, aged 19, attended the party where alcoholic beverages were available to all guests.Â  The decedent, who had consumed alcohol at the party, left with other guests. One of these guests detained the decedent at the guestâ€™s home in order to give the decedent time to â€œsober up.â€Â  The decedent drove himself from this guestâ€™s home, and was killed in a one-car accident.Â  At the time of his death, the decedent had a blood alcohol content of 0.291%.\r\nDecedentâ€™s mother, as his personal representative, brought this wrongful death action against the Bowdens and the company hosting the party (Hosts) alleging they were negligent.Â  The circuit court granted the Hostsâ€™ motion for summary judgment, holding that a social host was not liable to an underage person who is injured or killed after consuming alcoholic beverages provided by the host.\r\nB. Barnes\r\nBarnes involves a third party claim against the defendant social host rather than a first party claim as advanced in Marcum.Â  As in Marcum, the decedent was a nineteen-year-old guest at a business-related function.Â  There was evidence that the decedent consumed alcohol provided by the Host at the party.Â  Again, like the underage drinker in Marcum, the decedent was not involved in an accident upon leaving the party, but rather traveled to several other locations before being involved in a two-car accident.Â  This accident killed both the decedent and a passenger in the other car.\r\nThe passengerâ€™s personal representative (Barnes) sued both the Host and the estate of the underaged drinker in negligence.Â  The jury returned a $750,000 verdict against both the Host and the decedent driverâ€™s estate, finding the decedent driver 80% responsible.\r\n The Host appealed, contending as it had in the circuit court that it was not liable in tort to the third party killed by its underage guest.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the jury verdict against the Host, finding two statutes which prohibit a social host from serving alcohol to persons under 21[4] created a duty running from the host to third parties.Â  We granted certiorari to review this decision.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Does an adult social host who serves alcoholic beverages to an underage person owe a duty to that guest and/or a third party injured as a proximate result of the hostâ€™s service of alcohol?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIt is within this Courtâ€™s purview to change the common law.Â  Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 (1993).Â  â€œ[T]he common law changes when necessary to serve the needs of the people [and] [w]e have not hesitated to act in the past when it has become apparent that the public policy of this State is offended by outdated rules of law.â€Â  Russo v. Sutton, 310 S.C. 200, 422 S.E.2d 750 (1992).[5]\r\nAt present, a South Carolina social host incurs no liability to either first or third parties injured by an intoxicated adult guest.Â  Garren v. Cummings &amp; McCrady, Inc., 289 S.C. 348, 345 S.E.2d 508 (Ct. App. 1986).Â  In fact, a commercial host is liable only to third parties, and then only when he knowingly sells alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person.Â  Tobias v. Sports Club, Inc., 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998).Â  In imposing this limited liability upon commercial hosts, the Court relied upon alcohol beverage control statutes to extend liability to third persons, and upon public policy concerns to deny recovery to the intoxicated adult patron.Â  \r\nIn other commercial settings, South Carolina appellate courts have held that a statute criminalizing the sale of beer or wine to a person under the age of 21[6] and one providing regulatory penalties for the knowing sale to a person under 21[7] places a duty on a commercial vendor.Â  A vendor who violates this duty and sells to a person under 21 may be liable to the unlawful purchaser, and to third parties harmed by the purchaserâ€™s consumption of the alcohol.Â  Whitlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991).Â  In a different setting, our courts imposed third party liability on the holder of an on-premises sales and consumption license who violated an alcoholic beverage control regulation by permitting an underage person to consume alcoholic beverages on the holderâ€™s premises.Â  Norton v. Opening Break of Aiken, Inc., 313 S.C. 508, 443 S.E.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1994) affâ€™d 319 S.C. 469, 462 S.E.2d 861 (1995).\r\nSimply stated, South Carolina courts have declined to impose a common law duty on social hosts who serve intoxicated adults, but have relied upon alcoholic beverage control statutes and regulations to impose liability, under limited circumstances, upon commercial hosts, vendors, and licensees.Â  In deciding today whether to impose social host liability for service to underage guests, we keep these precedents in mind.Â  We are also mindful that policy concerns militate against a rule which would hold a social host to a higher standard than that to which a commercial provider is held.\r\nIt is contended that we should impose social host liability for service to underage persons grounded upon two alcoholic beverage control statutes which impose criminal penalties, under certain circumstances, to persons who transfer or give alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21.[8]Â  As explained below, we find the source of duty is the common law, not legislative enactments.Â  Conversely, we are urged to treat underage drinkers as we do other adults, placing no liability upon the social host for torts committed by their intoxicated guests.Â  See Garren, supra.Â  We decline to accept this invitation.\r\nIn determining whether, as a matter of public policy, underage drinkers should be viewed differently from adult drinkers aged 21 and over, we are guided by the policy expressions found in our state constitution and statutes.Â  The constitution provides that persons aged 18 to 20 â€œshall be deemed sui juris and endowed with full legal rights and responsibilities, provided, that the General Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until age twenty-one.â€ S. C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 14 (1976); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-1-320(a) (2005) (references to minors in state law deemed to mean persons under the age of 18 years except when laws relate to alcohol sales).Â  While underage persons have full social and civil rights, we find the public policy of this State treats these individuals as lacking full adult capacity to make informed decisions concerning the ingestion of alcoholic beverages.Â  See Norton v. Opening Break, supra.Â  Accordingly, we hold that adult social hosts who knowingly and intentionally serve, or cause to be served, alcoholic beverages to persons they know or should know to be between the ages of 18 and 20 may incur liability where, under the same circumstances, they are immune for service to persons aged at least 21 years old.\r\nWe next explain why the duty we impose today is founded upon our responsibility to adapt the common law to the realities of the modern world rather than predicated on the alcohol beverage control statutes criminalizing the transfer or gift of alcoholic beverages to persons less than 21 years of age.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 61-4-90; 61-6-4070.\r\nWhile both S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-90 and Â§ 61-6-4070 begin with a general prohibition on the transfer of alcoholic beverages to persons under the age of 21, each goes on to provide a number of exceptions to the general rule.Â  In brief, these exceptions allow a parent or spouse over the age of twenty-one to serve their underage child or spouse; permit the giving of alcohol in conjunction with a religious ceremony or purpose; and permit a student to â€œtasteâ€ an alcoholic beverage in conjunction with academic instruction.Â  As other courts have explained, such exceptions logically require us to construe these â€˜givingâ€™ statutes to protect only the person under 21 who consumes the alcohol, not the general public.Â  E.g., Davis v. Billyâ€™s Can-Teena, Inc., 284 Or. 351, 587 P.2d 75 (Or. 1978) superseded by statute as stated in Gattman v. Favro, 306 Or. 11, 757 P.2d 402 (1988); Hostetler v. Ward, 41 Wash. App. 343, 704 P.2d 1193 (Wash. App. 1985).Â  A holding that an adult social host is liable only to the underage drinker herself and not to any injured third party would contravene the public policy of this state, see Tobias, supra, yet a duty explicitly predicated on these statutes would logically permit us only that rule.Â  We, therefore, find no civil cause of action is created by these statutes.Â  Cf., Whitworth v. Fast Fare Markets of S.C., Inc., 289 S.C. 418, 338 S.E.2d 155 (1985) (no civil cause of action under contributing to delinquency of minors statute or statute criminalizing sale of tobacco to minors). \r\nAlthough we find no duty in the statutes, we do find in them support for our decision to extend the common law and impose liability on adult social hosts who knowingly and intentionally serve underage guests.Â  In determining whether to adhere to our current common law rule that a social host owes no duty, we look to the numerous statutes prohibiting the furnishing of alcohol to persons under 21, and to other legislation governing driving under the influence.Â  As Wisconsin Chief Justice Hallows said over 35 years ago in dissent,\r\n\r\n  The time has arrived when this court should again exercise its inherent power as the guardian of the common law and [impose liability for service of alcohol].â€¦[T]he common law in this stateâ€¦has been to the contraryâ€¦but the basis upon which these cases were decided is sadly eroded by the shift from commingling alcohol and horses to commingling alcohol and horsepower.\r\n  Garcia v. Hargrove, 46 Wis. 2d 724, 737, 176 N.W.2d 566, 572 (1970).Â  \r\n\r\nFourteen years after this dissent, Wisconsin adopted the Chief Justiceâ€™s view.Â  See Sorensen v. Jarvis, 119 Wis. 2d 627, 350 N.W.2d 108 (1984).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nConsonant with our duty to declare the common law, we hold that henceforth adult social hosts who knowingly and intentionally serve, or cause to be served, an alcoholic beverage to a person they know or should know is between the ages of 18 and 20 are liable to the person served, and to any other person, for damages proximately caused by the hostâ€™s service of alcohol.Â  \r\nThe order granting the Marcum defendants summary judgment is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals affirming the respondentâ€™s jury verdict against petitioner in Barnes is \r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J. concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I concur in part and respectfully dissent in part.Â  Although I agree with the majorityâ€™s adoption of the rule imposing limited social host liability, I would reverse and remand both cases and allow the parties to litigate their disputes under the rule adopted by the Court.Â  \r\nGenerally, judicial decisions creating new substantive rights have prospective effect only, whereas decisions creating new remedies to vindicate existing rights are applied retrospectively.Â  Stated otherwise, prospective application is required when liability is created where formerly none existed.Â  Toth v. Square D Co., 298 S.C. 6, 8, 377 S.E.2d 584, 585 (1989) (internal citations omitted).Â Â Â  In applying our general rule, this Court and the court of appeals have made decisions â€œselectively prospectiveâ€ by applying the rule to the case at bar and to all future cases.Â  Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing, and Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 400 n.8, 520 S.E.2d 142, 156 n.8 (1999) (explaining retroactive and prospective application of decisions); see, e.g., Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 225-26, 337 S.E.2d 213, 216 (1985) (holding â€œ[o]ur modification of the termination at will doctrine, as set forth in this opinion, applies only to this case and to those causes of action arising after the filing of this opinion. . . .â€); and McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 644, 494 S.E.2d 431, 439 (Ct. App. 1997) (recognizing the common law tort of breach of a physician's duty of confidentiality, and applying decision in this case and prospectively).[9] \r\nIn my view, we should extend our decision to impose limited first and third party social host liability to the cases before us today and all future cases which arise after the filing of our opinion.Â  Resolving the cases in this manner would, in my opinion, allow the plaintiffs the benefit of the change in the law which they induced without making our decision retroactive. \r\nThe majority declines to extend its ruling to the instant cases because it would â€œoffend notions of fairness . . . to retroactively impose tort liability where previously there had been none. . . .â€ In support of this holding, the majority relies upon the Courtâ€™s decision in Russo v. Sutton, 310 S.C. 200, 422 S.E.2d 750 (1992).Â  While the Court did not apply its decision abolishing the tort of alienation of affections in Russo, in my view, Russo is not the exclusive representation of how this Court and others handle cases where a judicial decision prompts a change in the law. [10]Â  See supra note 1.Â  \r\nAlthough I do not think that the imposition of newly created tort liability is appropriate in all cases, in my view, to expect litigants to bear the burdens associated with effecting a needed change in the law without the expectation that they will receive the benefits of the change in the law is more offensive to our notions of fairness as well as crippling to our legal system.[11]Â Â  Cf. Aka v. Jefferson Hosp. Assoc., Inc., 42 S.W.3d 508, 519 (Ark. 2001) (concluding that â€œappellantâ€™s efforts to bring about a needed change in the law should not go unrewarded, because without such inducement change might not occur.â€) (internal citations omitted).[12]Â Â  Additionally, I believe the majorityâ€™s resolution of this case is profoundly impractical and based on hypertechnical analysis of citations that does not adequately provide a rationale for why past litigants have been able to pursue their cases while the litigants in these cases are denied similar relief.Â Â Â Â  \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would reverse and remand these cases with instructions to retry them in accordance with our recognition of limited first and third party social host liability.Â Â \r\n\r\n[1] As the issue is not before us, we leave for another day the question whether an adult social host who is merely negligent in allowing the consumption of alcoholic beverages by a minor guest under the age of 18 may incur liability.Â  Let there be no doubt, however, that an adult social host who knowingly and intentionally serves, or causes to be served, alcoholic beverages to a minor under 18 is liable to both the guest and third parties.\r\n[2] Although the dissent acknowledges this general rule, it would adopt a rule that occasionally â€œrewardsâ€ the plaintiff in the case where the new tort duty is adopted by giving that plaintiff the right to proceed on the new theory.Â  The dissent cites numerous cases which allegedly support this new rule.Â  Four of those cases involve the abolition of immunity defenses and a fifth the abolition of the assumption of the risk defense: simply put, the abolition of an affirmative defense does not create a new duty.Â  \r\nFurther, in Ludwick v. This Minute of Carolina, Inc., 287 S.C. 219, 377 S.E.2d 584 (1989) and Kinard v. Augusta Sash &amp; Door Co., 286 S.C. 579, 336 S.E.2d 465 (1985), this Court did allow the plaintiffs to proceed on the new tort theory, but pointed out in each case that the change had been foreshadowed.Â  See Ludwick, 287 S.C. at 222, 337 S.E.2d at 215 (â€œlanguage in recent opinions of this Court and our Court of Appeals reflectsâ€¦the likelihood that the [strict application of the employment at will] doctrine will be reviewed in an appropriate South Carolina caseâ€); Kinard, 286 S.C. at 581, 336 S.E.2d at 466 (â€œmodern trend recognizes that emotional tranquility is an interest worthy of protection;â€ and noting in footnote that new tort had recently been rejected in a different case because its facts did not state a claim); compare Charleston County School Dist. v. State Budget &amp; Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993) (tort retroactivity is permissible where â€œnew tortâ€ is simply an extension which had been clearly foreshadowed).Â  To the extent the dissent would rely on commercial vendor liability cases as foreshadowing todayâ€™s social host decision, we simply note that our most recent commercial vendor decision actually limited the serverâ€™s liability.Â  Tobias v. The Sports Club, 332 S.C. 90, 504 S.E.2d 318 (1998).Â  \r\nThe only appellate decision which arguably permits the plaintiff the benefit of the newly-recognized, non-foreshadowed tort duty is McCormick v. England, 328 S.C. 627, 494 S.E.2d 431 (Ct. App. 1997), but it is unclear whether the Court of Appeals found this new duty in the common law or in legislative enactments.Â  McCormick may represent an aberration: it is certainly not our general rule.\r\nFinally, the dissentâ€™s reliance on Aka v. Jefferson Hosp. Assoc., Inc., 42 S.W.3d 508 (Ark. 2001) is simply misplaced: in Aka the Arkansas Supreme Court did not recognize a new common law tort, but rather overruled its prior interpretation of a statutory term in light of subsequent legislation.Â  This statutory interpretation precedent arguably conflicts with South Carolinaâ€™s jurisprudence, see JRS Builders, Inc. v. Neunsinger, 364 S.C. 596, 614 S.E.2d 629 (2005), and is neither relevant nor persuasive.\r\n[3] Barnes v. Cohen Dry Wall, Inc., 357 S.C. 280, 546 S.E.2d 311 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\n[4] S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 61-4-90 and 61-6-4070 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[5] In Russo, the Court abolished the tort of alienation of affections, and applied that ruling prospectively.Â  In that opinion, the Court noted its ability to apply common law changes retroactively as well as prospectively.Â  It would offend notions of fairness, however, to retroactively impose tort liability where previously there had been none, as would be the case here if we were to apply our new rule to these cases. This is especially so since the liability we create today arises from intentional conduct while these plaintiffs have contended only that these defendants were negligent.Â  The dissent misapprehends the import of the use of the word â€œwillfulâ€ in the complaints:Â  the terms â€œwillfulâ€ and â€œwantonâ€ when pled in a negligence case are synonymous with â€œreckless,â€ and import a greater degree of culpability than mere negligence.Â  See, e.g., Suber v. Smith, 243 S.C. 458, 134 S.E.2d 404 (1964).Â  Evidence that the defendantâ€™s conduct breached this higher standard entitles the plaintiff to a charge on punitive damages.Â  E.g., Cartee v. Lesley, 290 S.C. 333, 350 S.E.2d 388 (1986).Â  In order to permit these plaintiffs to take advantage of the rule we announce today, we would be required to order the circuit court to allow these plaintiffs to amend their complaints on remand, that is, assuming the plaintiffs could, consonant with Rule 11, SCRCP, plead an intentional tort.Â  This ruling would compound the unfairness to these defendants, who, under the law as it then stood, committed no civil wrong when underage drinkers consumed alcohol at their parties.\r\n[6] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-50 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[7] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-580 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[8] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 61-4-90 (Supp. 2005) (beer or wine); Â§ 61-6-4070 (Supp. 2005) (alcoholic liquors).\r\n[9] The majority incorrectly implies that this Court may only permit a party to benefit from the recognition of new tort liability where the imposition of the new tort liability was foreshadowed by previous decisions.Â  However, assuming foreshadowing is required, I believe our pronouncement of limited first and third party social host liability was adequately foreshadowed by our extension of liability in the commercial context and the statutory laws criminalizing such behavior.Â  See S.C. Code Ann Â§ 61-4-90 (Supp. 2005) and Â§ 61-6-4070 (Supp. 2005).Â  See also Norton v. Opening Break of Aiken , Inc., 313 S.C. 508, 443 S.E.2d 406 (Ct. App. 1994) affâ€™d 319 S.C. 469, 462 S.E.2d 861 (1995); Witlaw v. Kroger Co., 306 S.C. 51, 410 S.E.2d 251 (1991).Â Â  \r\nAdditionally, the majority incorrectly assumes that Ludwick and McCormick represent this Courtâ€™s entire jurisprudence on the matter.Â  However, this Court has often allowed the parties to an action which prompts a rule change to utilize the new rule.Â  See Davenport v. Cotton Hope Plantation Horizontal Property Regime, 333 S.C. 71, 508 S.E.2d 565 (1998) (holding that the abolition of assumption of risk as an â€œall or nothingâ€ defense would be applied to the action in which that ruling was made and to all other causes of action that arose or accrued after date of opinion); Kinard v. Augusta Sash &amp; Door Co., 286 S.C. 579, 336 S.E.2d 465 (1985) (recognizing the new cause of action by plaintiff bystander for negligent infliction of emotional distress and applying the new rule to the case);Â  McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985) (prospectively abolishing sovereign immunity and applying the new rule to the case before the court); Fitzer v. Greater Greenville, S.C. Young Menâ€™s Christian Assâ€™n, 277 S.C. 1, 282 S.E.2d 230 (1981) (applying the new rule abrogating the doctrine of charitable immunity to the case which prompted the rule change); Elam v. Elam, 275 S.C. 132, 268 S.E.2d 109 (1980) (abolishing the court-created parental immunity doctrine applicable to tort actions brought by unemancipated minors against their parents and applying the new rule to the case at hand and prospectively); Brown v. Anderson County Hosp. Assoc., 268 S.C. 479, 234 S.E.2d 873 (1977) (modifying doctrine of charitable immunity, such that charitable hospitals are liable for heedless and reckless acts, and applying decision in this case and prospectively). Â \r\nThe majority points out that many of the aforementioned cases involve the abolition of an affirmative defense.Â  While I agree that the abolition of an affirmative defense does not â€œcreate a new duty,â€ such abolition does impose liability where previously none existed.Â  See McCall, 285 S.C. at 246, 329 S.E.2d at 742 (acknowledging the creation of new tort liability).Â Â  \r\n[10] Â Again, I believe the portion of the majorityâ€™s rationale which relies on the concept of fairness is misguided.Â  While I understand that fairness is an important consideration, I cannot envision that an extension of potential liability would amount to unfairness in the cases before us today.Â  Arguably, tort liability involves a calculation of risks in evaluating whether to undertake a certain course of action.Â  In the majorityâ€™s view, extending our ruling to the cases before us today impermissibly adds another variable in the calculus.Â  Stated otherwise, the majority might argue that the potential imposition of civil liability upon the defendants in these cases impermissibly increases their expected accident costs such that it would dramatically change the nature of their decision to serve alcohol at their events.Â  In my view, this critically overstates the case.Â Â  Although no civil liability existed for social hosts at the time of these incidents, I find it difficult to believe that the defendants were ignorant of any potential liability which could result from serving alcohol to underage drinkers in light of the existence of criminal statutes prohibiting such behavior and our expanding extension of liability in the commercial context.Â Â  \r\n[11] The majority also finds that the plaintiffs have contended only that the defendants were negligent.Â  However, in my opinion, the complaints in these cases actually allege both negligent and willful conduct.Â  Because the plaintiffsâ€™ complaints allege an intentional tort, there is no impediment to remanding these cases to allow the parties to proceed under the new rule.\r\n[12] The majority misapprehends the use of Aka in this dissent.Â  Clearly, from the context and form of the citation, Aka is used to emphasize the rationale under which I find it both practical and just to extend our ruling today to the litigants in these cases, and not in support of the general concept of retroactive/prospective application of rules. However, for further clarification, I use Aka only to support the proposition that litigants should not be expected to bear the burdens associated with effecting a needed change in the law without the expectation that they will receive the benefits of the change in the law.Â  Accordingly, my use of this case does not conflict with South Carolinaâ€™s jurisprudence on the retroactive application of statutory changes in the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26260","title":"State v.

Pope, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant was convicted of trafficking in marijuana and received a five year sentence and was ordered to pay a $5,000 fine.Â  On appeal he contends the trial court erred in refusing to suppress a tape recording made while he and his codefendant were in the backseat of a police car following their arrests.Â  We affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant and his codefendant (Smith) were arrested as they delivered marijuana to Carter, who in turn sold it to informant McCorey.Â  Following their arrests at the scene, appellant and Smith were read their Miranda rights, handcuffed, and then placed in a patrol car.Â  The officer activated the audio/video recording equipment located in the vehicle.Â  The tape of appellantâ€™s and Smithâ€™s incriminating conversation which followed was introduced at trial over appellantâ€™s objection.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the trial court erred in denying appellantâ€™s motion to suppress the statement made in the back of the police car?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends the tape should have been suppressed because it was obtained in violation of Miranda and in violation of appellantâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe circuit judge held that Miranda was not implicated by the taping of appellant and Smith while in the police vehicle because, while they were undoubtedly in police custody at the time of the recording, there was no interrogation.Â  We agree.Â  There is simply no evidence of actual interrogation, nor of the â€œfunctional equivalentâ€ of interrogation, at the time of appellant and Smithâ€™s conversation.Â  E.g. State v. Owens, 293 S.C. 161, 359 S.E.2d 275 (1987). \r\nFurthermore, an individual does not have a reasonable expectation of privacy while being held in a police vehicle and thus there was no Fourth Amendment violation here.Â  See U.S. v. Clark, 22 F.3d 799 (8th Cir. 1994); U.S. v. McKinnon, 985 F.2d 525 (11th Cir.) cert. denied 510 U.S. 843 (1993); People v. Todd, 26 Cal. App. 3d 15, 102 Cal. Rptr. 539 (1972); State v.

Hardin\r\nDave Lyle Boulevard is a high-speed, divided, controlled-access highway connecting the City of Rock Hill to Interstate Highway 77.Â  No private driveway has direct access to the highway.Â  Instead, private driveways exit onto side roads which have intermittent access to the highway.Â  The highway has a number of turn lanes in the median which allow traffic to cross the median and access the many intersecting surface streets.\r\nThe plaintiffs own two properties that are located on the north side of Dave Lyle Boulevard. Â The properties sit on either side of the highwayâ€™s intersection with Garrison Road.Â  For several years, this intersection contained a break in the median which runs down Dave Lyle Boulevard.Â  This break allowed vehicles at the intersection to access both Garrison Road and the highway in either direction.Â  In 1998, the City of Rock Hill requested that SCDOT construct a new intersection approximately 1,000 feet east of the existing intersection to accommodate an industrial park and a technical college.Â  SCDOT advised that creating a new intersection would require that the Garrison/Dave Lyle intersection be closed due to the limitations of cross streets on the highway.Â  After a public hearing, SCDOT consented to the construction of the new intersection.Â  As a result, SCDOT closed the break in the median at the Garrison/Dave Lyle intersection.Â  This prevented vehicle traffic from making any left turns at the Garrison/Dave Lyle intersection.\r\nIn 2001, the plaintiffs filed an inverse condemnation action against SCDOT alleging that depriving the traffic leaving their properties the ability to cross Dave Lyle Boulevard constituted a taking for which the plaintiffs were owed compensation.Â  The trial court ruled that the plaintiffs suffered a compensable taking, and the court of appeals affirmed.Â  See Hardin v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 359 S.C. 244, 597 S.E.2d 814 (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nB. Tallent\r\nIn this case, the plaintiff purchased a tract of property located on Old Easley Bridge Road near Greenville.Â  The plaintiff opened and operated a hair salon and tanning studio on the property.Â  At the time she purchased the property, the property had access to Highway 123 via Old Easley Bridge Road.Â  As the roads were then aligned, Old Easley Bridge Road split off Highway 123 as a tangent and gradually curved to intersect White Horse Road, which runs perpendicular to Highway 123.\r\nSometime after the plaintiff purchased the property, SCDOT began construction of a controlled-access â€œdiamondâ€ interchange at the intersection of Highway 123 and White Horse Road.Â  This re-configuration involved closing access points between Old Easley Bridge Road and White Horse Road.Â  Specifically, SCDOT closed Old Easley Bridge Road to through traffic, removed a traffic light, and made several cosmetic changes along the road.Â  These changes altered the character of Old Easley Bridge Road from a through-connecting surface street to a road ending in a cul-de-sac.\r\nAs in Hardin, the plaintiff brought an inverse condemnation action against SCDOT.Â  Using the fact that the road re-configuration situated her property on a cul-de-sac and limited her access to Highway 123 by requiring her to navigate a series of secondary roads running through low income neighborhoods, the plaintiff alleged SCDOT had â€œtakenâ€ her property. Â The plaintiff alleged the road re-configuration decreased her property value and resulted in her business being less accessible to the public (and thus less valuable).Â  The trial court ruled that the plaintiff suffered a compensable taking, and the court of appeals affirmed.Â  See Tallent v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 363 S.C. 160, 609 S.E.2d 544 (Ct. App. 2005).\r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nAs we have previously held, a plaintiffâ€™s right to recovery in an inverse condemnation case is premised upon the ability to show that he or she has suffered a taking.Â  Byrd v. City of Hartsville, 365 S.C. 650, 657, 620 S.E.2d 76, 80 (2005).Â  Although it has been recognized that the existence of property interests are often determined by reference to sources such as state law, see Georgia v. Randolph, 547 U.S. __, 126 S.Ct. 1515, 1540 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting), South Carolina courts have embraced federal takings jurisprudence as providing the rubric under which we analyze whether an interference with someoneâ€™s property interests amounts to a constitutional taking.Â  Byrd, 365 S.C. at 656 n.6, 620 S.E.2d at 79 n.6 (citing Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. 297, 306, 534 S.E.2d 270, 275 (2000)).\r\nBoth Article I, Â§ 13 of the South Carolina Constitution and the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution provide that private property shall not be taken for public use without the payment of â€œjust compensation.â€[1]Â  Although the takings clause was once understood to apply only to a direct appropriation of property or the functional equivalent of an ouster of possession, it is now universally accepted that regulations which control or limit the use of property can â€œtakeâ€ the property in the constitutional sense.Â  See Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1014 (1992) (reviewing nineteenth century takings jurisprudence); see also Penn Central Transp. Co. v. City of New York, 438 U.S. 104, 122 n.2 (1978); and Byrd 365 S.C. at 656, 620 S.E.2d at 79.\r\nAlthough no set formula exists for determining whether property has been â€œtakenâ€ by the government, the relevant jurisprudence does provide significant guideposts.Â  Determining whether government action effects a taking requires a court to examine the character of the governmentâ€™s action and the extent to which this action interferes with the ownerâ€™s rights in the property as a whole.Â  Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 130-31.Â  Stated more specifically, these â€œad hoc, factual inquiriesâ€ involve examining the character of the governmentâ€™s action, the economic impact of the action, and the degree to which the action interferes with the ownerâ€™s investment-backed expectations.Â  Loretto v. Teleprompter Manhattan CATV Corp., 458 U.S. 419, 426 (1982) (quoting Penn Central, 438 U.S. at 124); Byrd, 365 S.C. at 658-59, 620 S.E.2d at 80 (quoting the same).Â  Generally, the physical occupation of private property by the government results in a taking regardless of the public interest the governmentâ€™s action serves.Â  See Loretto, 458 U.S. at 426-28; see also Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015.Â  Additionally, the enforcement of a government regulation will usually effect a taking when the regulation denies all economically beneficial or productive use of land.Â  Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1015.\r\nIn the instant cases, it is instructive to begin by classifying the nature of the governmentâ€™s actions which the property owners allege give rise to takings.Â  Neither Hardin nor Tallent involves the enactment of any regulation which directly regulates any use of the ownersâ€™ properties.Â  Thus, in order to have â€œtakenâ€ any part of these properties, SCDOT must have physically appropriated some aspect of them.Â  Determining this question requires that we analyze what property interests exist with reference to the public road system and a property ownerâ€™s access thereto.\r\nIn some jurisdictions, a property owner merely has an easement for the purpose of accessing the public road system.Â  Therefore, as long as a property owner has access to the public road system, his easement is intact.Â  For this reason, any road re-configuration that does not cut off an ownerâ€™s access to the public road system effects no taking upon him.\r\nIn South Carolina, however, a property owner has more rights.Â  As we have held, a property owner in South Carolina has an easement for access to and from any public road that abuts his property, regardless of whether he has access to and from an additional public road.Â \r\nSouth Carolina State Hwy. Depâ€™t v. Allison, 346 S.C. 389, 393, 143 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1965).Â  Thus, for example, in South Carolina, an owner of a corner lot has an easement for access to and from both roads that abut his property.Â  Of course, an owner in South Carolina also has an easement for access to and from the public road system.Â  This principle provides that an owner whose property does not abut any public road will not be denied access to the public road system.\r\nIn finding that takings occurred in these cases, the court of appeals relied on this Courtâ€™s opinion in City of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. 357, 40 S.E.2d 239 (1946).Â  In that case, the City of Rock Hill closed a portion of a street which rendered the remaining part of the street a cul-de-sac.Â  Id. at 361-62, 40 S.E.2d at Â­Â­Â­240-41.Â  The property owner of a corner lot which fronted both the cul-de-sac and another street brought an action against the city for a taking, and the trial court ruled in the cityâ€™s favor.Â  Id. at 365, 40 S.E.2d at 242.Â  This Court reversed, stating:\r\n\r\nThe right of a landowner to recover damages because of the vacation of a street depends on the location of his land with reference to the street vacated, or the part of the street vacated, and the effect of such vacation on his rights as an abutting owner. It is well settled that an owner is not entitled to recover damages unless he has sustained an injury different in kind and not merely in degree from that suffered by the public at large. If it appears that there is a special injury, the owner may recover damages notwithstanding his property does not abut, as in this case, on the part of the street vacated, because this amounts to a â€˜taking.â€™\r\n***\r\nIn the absence of special injury, no recovery will be allowed. The test is, not whether the property abuts, but whether there is a special injury, and the first practical question which presents itself is whether one whose\r\nproperty does not abut immediately on the part of the street vacated - the part vacated being in the same\r\nblock between his property and the next connecting cross street - is so specially injured as to be entitled to recover compensation on the ground that his access is cut off in one direction, but not in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nId. at 368-69, 40 S.E.2d at 243-44.\r\nCothran is representative of a line of cases which provide that the closing of a portion of a road abutting a piece of private property necessarily constitutes some degree of a taking of that property.Â  E.g., Gray v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 311 S.C. 144, 427 S.E.2d 899 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  A critical examination of the property interests at work in these cases, however, yields no plausible explanation for this rule.Â  When only a portion of a public road abutting a landownerâ€™s property is closed, leaving the property in a cul-de-sac, no taking has occurred.Â  As long as the owner has access to and from the remainder of the road that continues to abut his property, his easement with respect to that road remains intact.Â  Further, as long as a landowner still has access to the public road system, this easement is unaffected.[2]Â  This reasoning is in line with the notion that a landowner has no right to access abutting roads in more than one direction.Â  See 73 A.L.R.2d 689, 691-698.\r\nThis Court came very close to expressing this analysis in another similar case.Â  In South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp. v. Carodale Assoc., this Court stated:\r\n\r\nA landowner has no vested right in the continuance of a public highway; the abandonment of a highway, without its being closed, is damnum absque injuria. Â Likewise, the State is under no duty to maintain a minimum level of traffic flow. Â Nonetheless, the vacation of a street or the creation of a cul de sac with the concomitant diversion of traffic and loss of frontage has been held a â€œtakingâ€ of property. \r\nClosing a street inherently produces a diversion of traffic and loss of frontage on a viable traffic artery. However, these repercussions are not compensable elements of damage. Succinctly, the restriction of ingress or egress to and from oneâ€™s property is the right which must be compensated if infringed when a highway is closed by condemnation.\r\nThe landowner has no property right in the continuation or maintenance of the flow of traffic past its property. Traffic on the highway, to which they have access, is subject to the same police power regulations as every other member of the traveling public. Re-routing and diversion of traffic are police power regulations.\r\n\r\n268 S.C. 556, 561, 235 S.E.2d 127, 128-29 (1977) (emphasis in original, internal citations omitted).\r\nThough it does not expressly provide so, Carodale implicitly recognizes that road closings and re-alignments are actions of a far different character than government conduct which affects an ownerâ€™s rights in his or her property in a constitutionally significant sense.Â  Stated in doctrinal terms, modern takings principles instruct that road closings and realignments which do not â€œtakeâ€ land or an easement from a property owner do not give rise to compensable takings because these actions do not directly interfere with an ownerâ€™s rights in the property as a whole.[3]\r\nThis Courtâ€™s prior decisions holding that the closing of a road constituted a taking actually imply that a property owner possesses more than an easement; they imply possession of a property interest in the existence of a particular public road.Â  That cannot be correct.Â  See Tuggle v. Tribble, 6 S.W.2d 312, 314 (Ark. 1928) (not passing on the takings issue, but finding that a landowner can have no vested interest in the existence of an abutting road); cf. Carodale, 268 S.C. at 561, 235 S.E.2d at 128-29 (stating that a landowner has no vested rights in the continuance of a public highway and in the continuation of maintenance of traffic flow past his property).Â  Thus, to the extent the rationale for these holdings was that the government had caused the owner to lose a property right, this reasoning collapses on itself.\r\nAs this analysis indicates, the focus of our inquiry must be on a landownerâ€™s actual property interests; that is, his easements.Â  We therefore overrule the â€œspecial injuryâ€ analysis contained in our jurisprudence in this area and specify that our focus in these cases is on how any road re-configuration affects a property ownerâ€™s easements.Â  An easement is either taken or it is not.Â  That is the â€œinjury different in kind and not merely in degreeâ€ with which we are concerned.Â  Under Cothranâ€™s legal standard, an owner might prevail in a takings claim despite the fact that all of his relevant property interests - his easements for access - have not been disturbed.Â  Not only was the result in Cothran incorrect, its pronouncement of the law must be abandoned.[4]\r\nBecause the plaintiffs in Hardin continue to have access to and from Dave Lyle Boulevard and the public road system, their property rights have not been disturbed.Â  The ability to turn only one way onto the boulevard is irrelevant.Â  We therefore reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision and hold that there has been no taking in this case.\r\nSimilarly, no aspect of the Tallent plaintiffâ€™s property has been physically taken by SCDOT.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision and hold that there has been no taking in this case.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decisions in these cases.\r\nBURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. WALLER, J., concurring in part, dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which MOORE, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE WALLER, concurring in part, and dissenting in part:Â  I concur in part and dissent in part.\r\nAlthough I concur in result with the majorityâ€™s holding that Hardin has not suffered a compensable taking, I disagree with the rationale underlying its decision.Â  Further, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that Tallent has not suffered a compensable taking.Â  \r\nIn my view, the majority ignores well-established precedent and then, without direct citation of authority, holds that â€œmodern takings principles instruct that road closings and realignments which do not â€œtakeâ€ land. . . do not give rise to compensable takings because these actions do not directly interfere with an ownerâ€™s rights in the property as a whole.â€Â  To the contrary, it has long been the law of this state that an actual physical taking of property is not necessary to entitle one to compensation.Â  Gasque v. Town of Conway, 194 S.C. 15, 8 S.E.2d 871 (1943), overruled on other grounds McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985) (to deprive one of the ordinary beneficial use and enjoyment of property is, in law, equivalent to the taking of it, and is as much a â€œtakingâ€ as though the property itself were actually appropriated).Â  \r\nAs this Court noted in South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t v. Allison, 246 S.C. 389, 393, 143 S.E.2d 800, 802 (1965), â€œan obstruction that materially injures or deprives the abutting property owner of ingress or egress to and from his property is a â€˜takingâ€™ of the property, for which recovery may be had. The fact that other means of access to the property are available affects merely the amount of damages, and not the right of recovery.â€Â  \r\nI agree with the majority that City of Rock Hill v. Cothran, 209 S.C. 357, 40 S.E.2d 239 (1946) was wrongly decided upon its facts and should therefore be limited.Â  In Cothran, the plaintiffâ€™s property did not directly abut the closed portion of the road, such that there was no direct denial of ingress or egress.Â  Cothran was not deprived of one of the immediate means of access to his property.Â  Accordingly, under the facts of Cothran, the plaintiff suffered, at best, a diversion of traffic flow which, as the majority points out, this Court has recognized is not compensable.Â  Carodale (landowner has no property right in the continuation or maintenance of the flow of traffic past its property).[5]Â Â Â Â  \r\nHowever, in my view, the fact that a diversion in traffic flow is not compensable does not mean that closure of a road which materially deprives the abutting property owner of ingress or egress to and from his property is not a compensable taking.Â  See 46 Am.Jur. Proof of Facts 3d 493 Â§17 (2004) (courts have often noted important distinction between a limitation of access, which may be compensable, and a change in traffic flow, which is not compensable).Â Â Â  \r\nOn the facts of the Hardin case, I agree with the majority that there has been no taking.Â  Hardinâ€™s property does not directly abut the median which was closed by the Department of Transportation, and he was not materially deprived of ingress or egress to and from his property.Â  Accordingly, I concur in result only with Hardin.\r\nI dissent from the majority opinionâ€™s holding in Tallent.Â  In Tallentâ€™s[6] case, as a result of SDCOTâ€™s closure of access points between Old Easley Bridge Road and Highway 123, Old Easley Bridge Road was rendered a cul de sac at one end, the end used by Tallent and her customers to access her salon.Â  Tallentâ€™s only remaining access to Highway 123 was by means of a series of secondary roads running through a low-income neighborhood.Â  Due to the closure, the value of the residential properties increased, while the value of Tallentâ€™s commercial property decreased.\r\nCourts have generally held, consistent with South Carolina law, that a landowner on a partially closed road, whose land is on the opened portion, cannot claim damages if he still has reasonable access to the general system of roads. There is an exception to this rule, however, if the road closing leaves the landowner in a cul de sac.Â  Mill Creek Properties v. City of Columbia,Â  944 So.2d 67 (Ms. 2006), citing Miss. State Highway Commâ€™n v. Fleming, 248 Miss. 187, 157 So.2d 792 (1963); Kickâ€™s Liquour Store, Inc. v. City of Minneapolis, 587 N.W.2d 57 (Ct. App. Minn. 1998) (holding that creation of a cul de sac may be compensable if losses of access to and from existing roads â€œsubstantially impairs [the landownerâ€™s] right to reasonably convenient and suitable access to the main thoroughfareâ€).Â  See also DuPuy v. City of Waco, 396 S.W.2d 103, 110 (Tex. 1965) (where construction of viaduct left property owner in cul-de-sac, he was deprived of reasonable access, even though he could still physically get to public roads from his property); Boehm v. Backes, 493 N.W. 2d 671 (N.D. 1992) (Highway Departmentâ€™s construction of overpass that converted street in front of auto repair business into cul-de-sac by closing off direct access to street from nearby highway was a taking; access to business after permanent closure forced use of indirect route of additional four large blocks, through residential neighborhood, distance comparable to six regular city blocks, and this physical interference specially affected property).\r\nHere, the road on which Tallentâ€™s business is located has essentially been rendered a cul de sac.Â  In my view, therefore, if Tallent has suffered a special injury, she has a compensable taking.[7]Â  \r\nAs noted by the Court of Appeals in this case, â€œThe expert appraiser . . .Â  testified that [Tallentâ€™s] business losses differed from those in the area because the other entities were â€˜destinationâ€™ businesses, such that people will seek them out regardless of the lack of immediate access from Highway 123. . . . [W]hile the surrounding residential area benefited from the actions of SCDOT, the value of Tallentâ€™s commercial property had been adversely affected.Â  The realtor . . . testified that there had been no interest in the property due to the current lack of access to Highway 123.â€Â  Tallent, 363 S.C. at 168, 609 S.E.2d at 547.Â  Moreover, the Master indicated that several of Tallentâ€™s patrons testified they had difficulty reaching the property since the closure, and were reluctant to do so for safety reasons in driving through the low income neighborhood.Â  \r\nI would affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that Tallent suffered a compensable taking.Â  \r\nMOORE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] The Fifth Amendmentâ€™s takings clause applies to the actions of state governments through the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Chicago, B. &amp; Q.R. Co. v. City of Chicago, 166 U.S. 226, 241 (1897).\r\n[2] Returning to the corner lot example, the natural extension of this analysis is that if the government were to entirely close one of the roads that abutted the ownerâ€™s property, there would be no taking.Â  This is exactly correct.Â  The existence of the road was the condition that created the easement, not the other way around.Â  So long as a landowner has access to the public road system, his easement by necessity is intact.Â  The easement for access to the (now closed) abutting road has not been taken, it has been extinguished.\r\n[3] The dissent attempts to take us to task for â€œignoring well-established precedentâ€ in reaching our decision.Â  Of course, we do not ignore precedent as the dissent suggests; we expressly overrule it.\r\n[4] The contrary rule the dissent advances is curious on its own terms.Â  As a primary matter, neither landowner in this case has been deprived of ingress or egress to his or her property, nor have these landowners been injured in their ability to enter or exit their property.Â  Instead, these cases involve alterations to the road system which have not disturbed the landownersâ€™ easements of access.Â  Government action can effect no taking unless it has deprived an owner of a property interest.Â  To the degree that the dissentâ€™s analysis focuses on particular uses to which landowners put their property and the change of a propertyâ€™s use-driven value following alterations in the public road system, the dissent suggests that a significant economic impairment of a landownerâ€™s expectations may give rise to a taking.Â  This analysis puts the cart before the horse and overlooks the critical factor in these cases which is the character of the governmentâ€™s action.Â  No property rights of these owners have been taken or directly interfered with.Â  To find a taking in either of these cases would be to stretch reason beyond reality.\r\n[5]Â  It has been noted that although a loss of traffic, loss of business, and circuity of travel are not themselves compensable, they are factors to be considered in determining the reasonableness of the remaining access to and from an abutting roadway. Â Cady v. N.D. Depâ€™t of Transp., 472 N.W.2d 467 (N.D. 1991).Â  \r\n[6]Â  Tallentâ€™s beauty shop was located on Old Easley Bridge Road.\r\n[7]Â  As this Court recognized in Sease v. Spartanburg, 242 S.C. 520, 131 S.E.2d 683 (1963), the test of whether a landowner is entitled to recover damages for the vacation of a street is the existence of special injury amounting to a taking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26263","title":"Gecy v.

Munson, ofÂ  Womble Carlyle Sandridge &amp; Rice, and Timothy Edward Hurley, both of Greenville, for Appellant.\r\nJames Theodore Gentry, of Wyche Burgess Freeman &amp; Parham, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\nSamuel Darryl Harms, of Greenville, for Amicus Curiae Greenville County Republican Party.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Appellant Tammy Bagwell, candidate for Simpsonville City Council, contested the results of the municipal election which resulted in respondent, Robert Gecy, being declared winner.Â  The Simpsonville Election Commission (â€œCommissionâ€) invalidated the results and ordered a new election.Â  The circuit court overturned the ruling of the Commission and reinstated Gecy as winner of the Simpsonville City Council seat.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn November 8, 2005, the city of Simpsonville held an election to fill three seats on its city council.Â  The two candidates on the ballot for the Ward IV race were appellant, Tammy Bagwell, and respondent, Robert Gecy.Â  This was an at-large race, meaning all residents of Simpsonville were eligible to vote for the city council representative from Ward IV.\r\nAfter a hearing to determine the validity of provisional ballots and after a mandatory recount pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-17-280 (1976), the final vote tally was 430-427 in favor of Gecy, with one write-in vote for another individual.Â  The Commission certified the result and declared Gecy the winner of the election.\r\nOn November 10, 2005, Bagwell filed a timely protest of the election pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-130 (2004).Â  As required by statute, the Commission held a hearing two days later to determine the issues raised by Bagwellâ€™s protest. \r\nThe Commission decided that at least two illegal votes had been cast,[1] and these votes rendered doubtful the result of the election.Â  One of the illegal votes was cast by a voter who moved from her residence in one precinct to a residence in another precinct, and the other illegal vote came from a Simpsonville resident who voted in a precinct where his old business was located.Â  Both voters failed to change their addresses or notify election workers and voted in their old precinct.Â  The two illegal votes were subtracted from Gecyâ€™s total, leaving him with a total of 428 votes, preventing him from garnering a majority of the total votes cast.[2]Â  The Commission then ordered a new election.\r\nGecy appealed the Commissionâ€™s ruling to the circuit court.Â  The circuit court overturned the Commission and reinstated the popular election result.Â  The circuit court held that in the narrow context of a post-election challenge, the casting of votes in the wrong precinct did not affect the overall tally.Â  The court also found Bagwellâ€™s notice of protest was legally insufficient for failing to state specific facts to apprise Gecy of the basis for the challenge.Â  \r\nBagwell appeals the order of the circuit court reversing the Commission and seeks a new election for the contested seat.\r\nISSUES\r\n&nbsp;1. Did the circuit court err in overturning the Commissionâ€™s ruling that at least two illegal votes were cast, putting the result of the election into doubt and necessitating a new election?\r\n&nbsp;2. Did the circuit court err in overturning the Commissionâ€™s finding that Bagwellâ€™s protest pleading was legally sufficient?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn municipal election cases, we review the judgment of the circuit court upholding or overturning the decision of a municipal election commission to correct errors of law.Â  The review does not extend to findings of fact unless those findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Taylor v. Town of Atlantic Beach Election Commâ€™n, 363 S.C. 8, 609 S.E.2d 500 (2005).Â  \r\nANALYSIS\r\nBagwell argues that the votes cast in the wrong precinct were illegal, and as a result, a new election should have been held.Â  We agree.\r\nIn this case, two voters cast a ballot in a precinct where they previously were registered, but they no longer had a valid address in that precinct at the time of the election.Â  Both parties agree that these two votes were not properly cast, and the question becomes whether these illegal votes should be thrown out, which would require a new election.\r\nThe election process is exclusively controlled by statute.Â  S.C. Const. Art. II, Â§ 10. Â Â We have recognized that perfect compliance with the election statutes is unlikely, and this Court will not nullify an election based on minor violations of technical requirements. Â George v. Mun. Election Commâ€™n of City of Charleston, 335 S.C. 182, 186, 516 S.E.2d 206, 208 (1999).\r\nAs a general rule, statutory provisions are mandatory in two instances: when the statute expressly declares that a particular act is essential to the validity of an election or when enforcement is sought before an election in a direct proceeding. Â George, 335 S.C. at 186, 516 S.E.2d at 208.Â  However, the Court may deem such provisions to be mandatory after an election, and thus non-compliance may nullify the results, when the provisions substantially affect the determination of the results, an essential element of the election, or the fundamental integrity of the election. Â Id. at 187.Â  Where there is a total disregard of the statute, the violation cannot be treated as an irregularity, but it must be held and adjudicated to be cause for declaring the election void and illegal. Â Id.Â  The Court will not sanction practices which circumvent the plain purposes of the law and open the door to fraud. Â May v. Wilson, 199 S.C. 354, 19 S.E.2d 467 (1942).\r\nThe use of precincts in our election process is a fundamental part of our statutory scheme.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-110 (1976) (â€œNo person shall be allowed to vote at any election unless he shall be registered as herein required.â€) and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-120(A)(3) (Supp. 2005) (providing, as a qualification for registration, that the prospective voter must be a resident of both the county and the precinct in which he intends to vote); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-155(a)(3)(iii) (Supp. 2005) (requiring registration board to reject any voter application from which the board cannot determine the proper precinct to be assigned); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-7-940 (Supp. 2005) (voter moving to new precinct must notify the registration board in his new county so that he may be informed of his new, correct precinct); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-440 (Supp. 2005) (outlining specific procedures for voting by an elector who has moved to a new precinct but has not notified the county registration board); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-7-920 (1976) (in municipal elections when the councilmen are elected by an at-large vote, the electors shall vote at the voting place in the precinct within which they reside); and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-810 (Supp. 2005) (election protest may be based on evidence of voters who voted in a precinct other than the one in which they are entitled by law to vote).\r\nThe disregard of the election statutes requiring electors to be residents of the precincts in which they vote, as well as failing to follow the procedure outlined in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-440 for those voters who have moved to a new precinct, constitutes more than a mere irregularity or illegality.Â  The precinct system is an essential element of our voting process, and the failure of the two voters to adhere to the statutory requirements for registration and voting requires their votes to be rejected. Â Because the rejection of these two votes results in Gecy no longer carrying a majority of the total votes cast, a new election must be held.\r\nThe second issue involves Bagwellâ€™s notice of protest.Â  The circuit court determined Bagwellâ€™s notice of protest to be insufficient and found that her protest should have been dismissed.Â  Bagwell argues that the notice of protest was sufficient under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-130 (2004).Â  We agree.\r\nBagwellâ€™s notice of protest contained eight separate allegations.Â  Bagwell argues that the third ground for the protest adequately alleged the irregularities surrounding the two illegal votes.Â  That allegation asserted, â€œPersons who had not provided accurate information for the voter rolls were nonetheless allowed to cast full ballots.â€ \r\nSection 5-15-130 requires the notice of protest to include a\r\nâ€œconcise statement of the groundsâ€ for the election contest.Â  We have explained that the notice â€œshould briefly state facts or a combination of facts sufficient to apprise the contestee of the cause for which his election is contested, it being insufficient to allege generally the fraud was committed, or to allege mere conclusions of the pleader.â€Â  Butler v. Town of Edgefield, 328 S.C. 238, 245-246, 493 S.E.2d 838, 842 (1997) (quoting 26 Am.Jur.2d Elections Â§ 434 (1996)); see also State ex rel. Davis v. State Bd. of Canvassers, 86 S.C. 451, 458-459, 68 S.E. 676, 679 (1910) (â€œwhileâ€¦technical precision in pleading should not be required [for election contests], still reason and justice require that the grounds relied upon should be stated plainly and clearly that the contestee may prepare to meet them without unnecessary labor or expense.â€) (cited in Butler, supra). \r\nIn our opinion, the circuit court incorrectly determined that Bagwellâ€™s notice of protest failed to meet the statutory requirement.Â  The notice of protest contained a concise statement of the grounds for Bagwellâ€™s challenge as required by Â§ 5-15-130.Â  Unlike Butler, there was no general allegation of fraud, and the notice of protest was sufficient to notify Gecy of the nature of the challenge.\r\nGecy provides two additional arguments, raised before the lower court but not ruled upon by the circuit judge, that he claims are sufficient to affirm the circuit courtâ€™s decision.Â  We only address one of Gecyâ€™s arguments.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C., v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (it is within appellate courtâ€™s discretion whether to address any additional sustaining grounds).\r\nGecy contends that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-810, which allows for post-election challenges based on after-discovered evidence, requires the protesting party to exercise due diligence in obtaining information that could have been acquired prior to the election.Â  Gecy argues that because Bagwell could have determined before the election that the two illegal voters no longer lived in the precinct where they were registered, her protest fails because it was not based on after-discovered evidence.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\nAlthough this Court has defined after-discovered evidence\r\nin other contexts, the applicable election statute clearly provides:\r\n\r\nA candidate may protest an election in which he is a candidate pursuant to 7-17-30 when the protest is based in whole or in part on evidence discovered after the election. This evidence may include, but is not limited to, after-discovered evidence of voters who have voted in a precinct or for a district office other than the one in which they are entitled by law to vote.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-13-810.[3]Â  In addition, we have previously determined that evidence presented by a challenging candidate that â€œvoters included on the voter registration list were not in fact city residents qualifies as after-discovered evidence under this section.â€Â  Dukes v. Redmond, 357 S.C. 454, 457, 593 S.E.2d 606, 608 (2004).\r\nIn this case, evidence of the two voters who cast their ballots in a precinct where they no longer resided qualifies as after-discovered evidence allowed by Â§ 7-13-810.Â  Even though Gecy correctly points out that Bagwell could have discovered the evidence on which she bases her challenge before the election, we decline to require a candidate to review all registration books and match each registered voter with his current address before the election.Â  The amended version of Â§ 7-13-810 and Dukes specifically permit the same type of after-discovered evidence that was used by Bagwell.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the circuit courtâ€™s decision to reinstate Gecy as the winner of the Simpsonville City Council seat.Â  The two illegal votes cannot be counted, and a new election is required.Â  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The Commission found two specific examples of illegal votes but inferred that other unnamed voters had voted illegally due to the short time available for investigation.Â  The circuit court reversed this ruling, and this issue has not been appealed.Â  \r\n[2] See Broadhurst v. City of Myrtle Beach Election Commâ€™n, 342 S.C. 373, 382, 537 S.E.2d 543, 547 (2000) (â€œIn determining whether an irregularity in the conduct of an election is sufficient to render the result doubtful, the rule deducible from the decisions is that all illegally cast ballots shall be deducted from the total number counted for the declared winning candidateâ€¦â€).Â  \r\n[3] This section was added in 1996 after our decision in Hill v. South Carolina Election Commâ€™n, 304 S.C. 150, 403 S.E.2d 309 (1991); see also Greene v. South Carolina Election Commâ€™n, 314 S.C. 449, 445 S.E.2d 451 (1994). Â In Hill, we held that discrepancies between the district where a voter actually resided and the voterâ€™s district designation on the voter registration list could have been discovered prior to the election and could not be used for a post-election challenge.Â  The amended version of the statute allows for after-discovered evidence that was prohibited by Hill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26264","title":"In the Matter of Willie Bethune","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26264","description":"This is a judicial disciplinary opinion in which the Court publicly reprimands a magistrate.","date":"2007-02-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Former Clarendon County Magistrate\r\nWillie L.

Â See In the Matter of Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924 (1996) (a public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office).[1]Â  The facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\n&nbsp;Since 1985, respondent was a part-time Clarendon County Magistrate.Â  On October 1, 2006, a female motorist was incarcerated by the Summerton Police Department for traffic and driverâ€™s license offenses.Â  Respondent presided over her bond hearing that evening.Â  \r\nThe motorist alleges that, during the bond hearing, respondent asked whether her bra straps were clear or whether the whole bra was clear.Â  She alleges he further commented that they werenâ€™t used to having â€œfine womenâ€ there that often, remarked that her eyes were pretty, and made a remark suggesting that she should show the police officer her navel.Â  The motoristâ€™s allegations are supported by a police officer who was in court.Â  \r\nInitially, respondent reported to ODC that he had no recollection of making the comments.Â  Upon further reflection, however, respondent recalled that the motorist was not wearing an orange jumpsuit like the other prisoners but, instead, a cut-off tank top, which was causing some degree of distraction and/or disruption, so he instructed her to be seated.Â  Respondent reports that any comments he may have made to the motorist were made in that context only.Â  \r\nRespondent reported that, at some point, the motorist asked the police where her car had been towed.Â  Police attempted to telephone the towing company owner for the motorist, but were unable to make contact.Â  The motorist then asked respondent if he could help her to regain possession of her car.Â  Respondent informed ODC that he then made telephone contact with the towing company owner and, at the motoristâ€™s request, arranged to drive to pick up her car.Â Â  \r\nThe motorist alleges respondent made sexual advances toward her while they were in the car together and offered to have the charges against her dismissed in exchange for sexual favors.Â  Respondent denies these allegations.Â  Â \r\nRespondent reports that, while he and the motorist were together in his car, the motorist engaged him in conversation about procedural matters relating to her pending charges and invited him to touch her in a sexual way.Â  Respondent reports he declined the invitation, but did talk with the motorist about court procedure and, in the course of the conversation, revealed to her that another Clarendon County Magistrate, whom respondent named, would preside over her trial.Â  According to respondent, the motorist asked what the other magistrate looked like, whether he was married, and then said she would have sex with this magistrate if he would drop the charges.Â  The motorist gave respondent her telephone number and asked him to relay it and her offer to the other magistrate.Â  Respondent told the motorist he would call the other magistrate.Â  Respondent also gave the motorist his business card from another line of work with his cell phone number hand-written on the back.Â Â  \r\nIt is not disputed that respondent telephoned the other magistrate concerning the motorist.Â  Respondent informed ODC that he told the other magistrate â€œa young lady wants to speak to youâ€ and then gave the magistrate the motoristâ€™s telephone number.Â  \r\nThe other magistrateâ€™s recollection is that respondent telephoned after 10:00 p.m.Â  After initial pleasantries and general conversation, respondent stated he was calling to see if the magistrate would â€œhelp somebodyâ€ who had traffic tickets pending in Summerton where the magistrate had just become interim municipal judge in addition to his duties as magistrate.Â  The magistrate indicated it was his impression that the motorist respondent wanted to help had some relationship with respondent such as a friend, relative, or possible fellow church member.Â  The magistrate recalled being given the motoristâ€™s name and telephone number and being asked to telephone the motorist.Â Â  Â \r\nIt is not disputed respondent called the motorist at 10:03 p.m. on October 4, 2006, to let her know he had spoken with the other magistrate about the tickets.Â  Respondent left a voice message identifying himself and stating â€œI spoke with [the other magistrate].Â  Heâ€™s gonna give you a call. Â Everything is on.â€¦â€Â Â  When the other magistrate called the motorist, she advised him that she had made a complaint against respondent and they should have no further contact.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent admits he has violated the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should maintain high standards of conduct and should personally observe those standards);\r\nCanon 2 (judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2B (judge shall not allow family, social, political or other relationships to influence the judge's judicial conduct or judgment); Canon 3 (judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(4) (judge shall be dignified and courteous to litigants); Canon 4 (judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities to minimize risk of conflict with judicial obligations); and Canon 4(A) (judge shall conduct extra-judicial activities so they do not cast reasonable doubt on judgeâ€™s capacity to act impartially as judge).Â  Respondent further admits his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(9) (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the judgeâ€™s Oath of Office), of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.Â \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.[2]Â  Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  Further, we hereby prohibit and enjoin respondent from holding any judicial office within the unified judicial system in South Carolina.Â  \r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J.,Â  MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondentâ€™s request for oral argument is denied.Â  \r\n[2] As previously noted, a public reprimand is the most severe sanction the Court can impose when a judge no longer holds judicial office.Â  See In re Gravely, supra. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26265","title":"In the Matter of Will Roger Helton","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26265","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary opinion in which the Court imposed an indefinite suspension.","date":"2007-02-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Will Roger Helton, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26265\r\nJanuary 23, 2007 - Filed February 20, 2007Â \r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nDesa Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to an indefinite sanction from the practice of law.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was admitted to the practice of law in South Carolina in 1995.Â  From sometime in 2002 through approximately May 2005, respondent employed several non-lawyer assistants who engaged in the preparation for and closing of residential real estate transactions.Â  It is estimated that respondent and/or his firm closed on average approximately 15 to 20 real estate transactions per month with the number of closings increasing over the period of time.Â  \r\nODC conducted a review of 125 sample files closed by respondentâ€™s firm for a seven month period towards the end of the above-referenced period of time.Â  As a result of that review, ODC concluded that, of the 125 files, approximately 112 were closed by non-lawyer assistants, twelve were closed by respondent, and one was closed by another lawyer.Â  \r\nDuring the seven month period, respondent personally handled those real estate closings which took place outside of his law office and his non-lawyer assistants (with a possible few minor exceptions) handled the closings which took place in the law office without the presence, assistance, or supervision of respondent or any other licensed attorney (with a possible few minor exceptions).Â  The closings by the non-lawyer assistants were handled without any meaningful supervision by respondent or any other attorney licensed in this state with the non-lawyer assistants preparing the legal documents (deeds, mortgages, and HUD-1 Settlement Statements) and the title insurance commitments and policies.Â  During the seven month period neither respondent nor any other licensed attorney reviewed the closing documents or title abstracts prior to, at, or subsequent to the closing of the transactions and no licensed lawyer was present at the closings.Â  After the closings, the non-lawyer assistants would disburse the proceeds and record the documents without supervision of respondent or any licensed attorney.Â  In most all of the cases, the non-lawyer assistants would sign respondentâ€™s name with his knowledge and consent as a witness on deeds, mortgages and other closing documents, as settlement agent on the HUD-1 Settlement Statements, and as agent for the title insurance company on commitments, final title insurance policies, and other title insurance documents.Â  In most cases, respondent had not witnessed the execution of the documents and was out of the office during the executions.Â  \r\nFrom 2002 through May 2005, after conducting the closings outside of his law office, respondent most often, but not always, brought the executed documents back to his office and had an assistant witness the deeds, mortgages, and other closing documents even though the assistant had not been present during the documentâ€™s execution.Â  Thereafter, with respondentâ€™s knowledge and consent, a notary public employed by respondent notarized the documents signed by the â€œwitnessâ€ even though the â€œwitnessâ€ had not been present when the documents were executed.Â  \r\nAround July 2005, respondent began the process of winding down his law practice and he ceased conducting real estate transactions.Â  Respondent acknowledges that the winding down of his practice resulted in communication problems and delays in closing files, especially those related to the complainantâ€™s company.Â  ODC believes these issues have been or are being resolved with assistance from the staff of respondentâ€™s former title insurance company.Â  Respondent has now closed his law office and is not actively engaged in the practice of law. \r\nRespondent represents that his real estate practice grew steadily and substantially between 2002 through May 2005.Â  During this period, respondent moved his law office.Â  Due to unexpected difficulties with the move, the efficiency of his practice was greatly disrupted.Â  The move, along with increasing demands on respondentâ€™s schedule, required respondent to attend to non-real estate aspects of his practice and to conduct an increasing number of closings outside his law office, thereby causing respondent to increasingly rely on his non-lawyer assistants to handle the real estate closings conducted at his office as described above. Â Respondent asserts that the number of closings handled contrary to prescribed procedures were the greatest towards the end of his practice.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of matter); Rule 4.1(a) (in representing a client, lawyer shall not make false statement of material fact to a third person);Â  Â Â Â Â Â Rule 5.3 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure non-lawyerâ€™s conduct is compatible with professional obligations of lawyer); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not assist another in the unauthorized practice of law);\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice).\r\nÂ In addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\njurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office taken upon admission).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\nRLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26266","title":"In the Matter of Kristine L.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n        Kristine L. Esgar, pro se, of Columbia.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either a public reprimand or definite suspension not to exceed sixty (60) days. Â See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent requests that any definite suspension be made retroactive to the date of her interim suspension.[1]Â  We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a sixty (60) day period, retroactive to date of her interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent represented Complainantâ€™s husband in connection with injuries he sustained in an automobile collision in 2000.Â  In 2004, respondent received a settlement of the policy limits available to Complainantâ€™s husband and a $2,000,000 confession of judgment against the at-fault party.Â  Complainantâ€™s husband died shortly after the settlement funds were disbursed.Â  \r\nRespondent withheld a portion of the insurance money proceeds due to a lien asserted by a settlement funding company that had loaned money to Complainant and her husband prior to the settlement.Â  Since 2004, respondent engaged in regular communication with the settlement funding company in an attempt to reduce or eliminate the amount owed from the funds collected.Â  Respondent admits she should have communicated in writing with Complainant regarding the status of her negotiations with the settlement funding company when it became clear from her telephone calls that she did not understand the settlement funding companyâ€™s claim.\r\nIn her response to Complainantâ€™s grievance, respondent requested additional time to supplement her response with documents from her client file which was in storage.Â  Additional time was allowed, giving respondent until March 8, 2006.Â  On February 28, 2006, respondent contacted ODC by telephone and requested an additional extension to March 30, 2006, which was granted.Â  Respondent represents she mailed documents to supplement her response; however, ODC has no record of receiving them.Â  On April 6, 2006, when no documents were received, ODC sent respondent a reminder letter requesting a response no later than April 14, 2006.Â  Receiving nothing further from respondent, the Investigative Panel authorized full investigation on April 28, 2006.Â Â Â Â  \r\nODC attempted service of the notice of full investigation on three addresses for respondent, one on record with the South Carolina Bar, one in the local telephone book, and one obtained by an investigator with the Office of the Attorney General.Â  All three were returned undeliverable.Â  \r\nODC attempted service of a notice to appear and subpoena on respondent by certified mail and personal service.Â  These attempts were unsuccessful.Â  The appearance date was rescheduled and a new notice was issued.Â  The new notice was delivered to SLED with a request that respondent be served personally.Â  SLED was able to identify and confirm a new current address for respondent.Â  Seven attempts were made to deliver the documents to respondent.Â  The SLED agent also left messages on respondentâ€™s cell phone; the messages were not returned.Â  \r\nDuring the time that the disciplinary investigation was pending, respondent was experiencing difficulty in getting her mail and her telephone messages.Â  Respondent acknowledges that she should have taken appropriate steps to address those difficulties with the post office and with her cell phone service or should have made arrangements for other means of communication with her clients and ODC.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that she has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  RuleÂ  1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â Â Â  Respondent further admits her misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to knowingly fail to respond to lawful demand from disciplinary authority).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a sixty (60) day period, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Finally, within sixty (60) days of the date of her reinstatement by the Court, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC in its investigation and prosecution of this matter.Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent was placed on interim suspension on October 20, 2006.Â Â  In the Matter of Esgar, 371 S.C. 4, 636 S.E.2d 861 (2006).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Grant Textiles, 361 S.C. 188, 603 S.E.2d 858 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nClaimant was vice-president and in charge of sales at Grant Textiles, a family-owned business.Â  Grant Textiles sold machinery parts and equipment to textile mills.Â  In December 2000, after making a delivery in Greenwood, Claimant traveled in a company-owned pick-up truck to Clinton to meet his father, the CEO of Grant Textiles.Â  He and his father planned to meet customers who were interested in purchasing textile bobbins.Â  Claimant intended to drop off bobbin samples, return to his office, and then go to his home in Cowpens.Â  He was meeting his father and the customers at the Clinton House and Meeting Plantation, which was described as a corporate hunting preserve.Â  Claimant individually owned the Clinton House.Â  Grant Textiles had a corporate membership and often entertained clients there.\r\nAround 5:30 p.m., Claimant neared the entrance of the Clinton House when he had to swerve onto the shoulder of Highway 56 in order to avoid hitting an object, apparently an animal, which was lying on the highway.Â  Claimant turned into the entrance driveway of the Clinton House where he stopped his car, but left it running.Â  He was met on the driveway by the day-to-day operator of the Clinton House, Randy Bickley.Â  Bickley argued with Claimant for a few minutes and tried to assure Claimant he would take care of the debris in the roadway because Claimant needed to meet his father.Â  However, Claimant insisted on helping remove the debris.\r\nClaimant and Bickley proceeded down the highway toward the debris when a pick-up truck crossed into the left lane of traffic to pass another car and struck Claimant who was walking in the shoulder of the highway.Â  Claimant was injured on his right side and had to have extensive surgery on his right arm.\r\nClaimant testified he wanted to remove the debris because it was a hazard to anyone traveling on the highway, to his customers who would be arriving at Clinton House that evening, to himself, and to his father.Â  Claimant testified that removing road debris was not part of his regular job duties, but he maintained he did not have a defined set of duties.Â  He conceded that Grant Textiles had no obligation to remove debris from the roadway in front of the Clinton House and that his only purpose for going to the Clinton House that night was to deliver bobbin samples to a customer.\r\nThe single commissioner found the injury compensable because Claimant was injured during his regular work hours while on his way to meet customers in a company-owned truck.Â  Further, the commissioner found that Claimant wanted to remove the debris because he was concerned with the safety of his co-worker father, his potential customers, and the public at-large.Â  Finally, the commissioner found Claimantâ€™s attempt to remove the debris was not a substantial deviation from his employment.\r\nThe full commission reversed and stated these findings of fact: (1) the accident did not arise out of Claimantâ€™s employment because the causative element of his accident had no connection with his employment; and (2) that Claimantâ€™s job duties were in no way related to road maintenance.Â  In making its legal conclusion, the full commission determined Claimantâ€™s accident did not arise out of and in the course of his employment.Â  The circuit court reversed and determined there was no dispute regarding the facts in this case and that the full commission erred in its application of the law.\r\nThe Court of Appeals disagreed and reinstated the full commissionâ€™s order denying compensation.Â  The court noted that, as the sole finder of fact, the full commission found that Claimantâ€™s\r\ninjuries did not arise out of his employment with Grant Textiles because the cause of the accident had no relation to his employment duties.Â  The court concluded that the claim is not compensable because the factual findings made by the full commission are supported by substantial evidence.Â  Chief Judge Hearn dissented and stated that, because there were no material facts in dispute, the question of whether the accident is compensable is a question of law.Â  Judge Hearn stated she would have found that Claimantâ€™s injury arose out of and in the course of his employment.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by finding Claimantâ€™s accident did not arise out of and in the course of his employment?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act establishes the standard of review for decisions by the South Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  Although we may not substitute our judgment for that of the full commission as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact, we may reverse where the decision is affected by an error of law.Â  Rodriguez v. Romero, 363 S.C. 80, 610 S.E.2d 488 (2005).Â  Review is limited to deciding whether the commissionâ€™s decision is unsupported by substantial evidence or is controlled by some error of law.Â  Id.\r\nTo be compensable, an injury by accident must be one â€œarising out of and in the course of employment.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (Supp. 2005).Â  The two parts of the phrase â€œarising out of and in the course of employmentâ€ are not synonymous.Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 508 S.E.2d 21 (1998).Â  Both parts must exist simultaneously before any court will allow recovery.Â  Id.Â  â€œArising out ofâ€ refers to the injuryâ€™s origin and cause, whereas â€œin the course ofâ€ refers to the injuryâ€™s time, place, and circumstances.Â  Id.Â  For an injury to â€œarise out ofâ€ employment, the injury must be proximately caused by the employment.Â  Douglas v. Spartan Mills, Startex Div., 245 S.C. 265, 140 S.E.2d 173 (1965). Â The injury arises out of employment when there is a causal connection between the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting injury. Id.\r\nThere are circumstances when injuries arising out of acts outside the scope of an employeeâ€™s regular duties may be compensable.Â  Osteen v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., supra.Â  These circumstances have been applied to:Â  (1) acts benefiting co-employees; (2) acts benefiting customers or\r\nstrangers; (3) acts benefiting the claimant; and (4) acts benefiting the employer privately.Â  Id. Â An act outside an employeeâ€™s regular duties which is undertaken in good faith to advance the employerâ€™s interest, whether or not the employeeâ€™s own assigned work is thereby furthered, is within the course of employment.Â  Howell v. Kash &amp; Karry, 264 S.C. 298, 214 S.E.2d 821 (1975) (grocery store employee who was injured while chasing two purse-snatchers was found to have suffered a compensable injury).\r\nThere were no disputed material facts in this case.Â  Where there are no disputed facts, the question of whether an accident is compensable is a question of law.Â  Douglas v. Spartan Mills, supra.Â  The full commission erred by finding that the accident did not have a causal connection with Claimantâ€™s employment.Â  The accident would not have happened but for Claimantâ€™s business trip to the Clinton House to meet his employerâ€™s customers.Â  Because removing road hazards was not part of Claimantâ€™s job duties, he could have ignored the hazard in the road; however, he chose to remove the hazard to benefit himself, his co-worker father, and his customers.Â  As found in Howell, Claimantâ€™s act, while outside his regular duties, was undertaken in good faith to advance his employerâ€™s interest and, therefore, was within the course of his employment.Â  Therefore, the full commissionâ€™s conclusion that the accident did not arise out of and in the course of Claimantâ€™s employment is incorrect.\r\nThe majority opinion of the Court of Appeals upheld the full commission solely on the basis that the factual findings made by the full commission were supported by substantial evidence.Â  However, as noted above, the appellate court may reverse the full commission when the decision is affected by an error of law as it was here.Â  While the appellate courts are required to be deferential to the full commission regarding questions of fact, this deference does not prevent the courts from overturning the full commissionâ€™s decision when it is legally incorrect as it is here.\r\nFurthermore, in this instance, we also reverse the full commission for its issuance of a conclusory order.Â  The Administrative Procedures Act (APA) sets out the requirements for a final order in an agency adjudication of a contested case as follows:\r\n\r\n. . . A final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, separately stated.Â  Findings of fact, if set forth in statutory language, shall be accompanied by a concise and explicit statement of the underlying facts supporting the findings.Â  . . .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005) (emphasis added).\r\nIn Able Communications, Inc. v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 290 S.C. 409, 351 S.E.2d 151 (1986), we held that an order by the public service commission stating that a telephone carrierâ€™s services were â€œfair and reasonable,â€ with no other findings of fact, violated Â§ 1-23-350.Â  We alluded to the purpose of Â§ 1-23-350, stating, â€œIt is impossible for an appellate court to review the order for error, since the reasons underlying the decision are left to speculation.â€Â  Id. at 411, 351 S.E.2d at 152.Â  We vacated the public service commissionâ€™s order and remanded the matter to the public service commission for compliance with Â§ 1-23-350.\r\nThe logic of Able Communications applies with equal force in the instant case.Â  Specifically, in its reversal of the single commissionerâ€™s decision, the full commissionâ€™s findings of fact stated that (1) the accident â€œdid not arise out of [Claimantâ€™s] employment . . . because the causative element of the Claimantâ€™s accident had no causal connection with his employment at Grant Textiles,â€ and (2) â€œClaimantâ€™s ordinary job duties at Grant Textiles did not require him to remove debris from the roads, and the discharge of his job duties and responsibilities were in no way related to road maintenance skills.â€Â  Because the full commissionâ€™s order was founded on the statutory language of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, the APA required the full commission to clearly set forth the underlying facts upon which it relied to support its conclusion.Â  See Â§ 1-23-350.Â  By simply repeating the statuteâ€™s language, with little else, the full commissionâ€™s decision failed to comply with this requirement.\r\nBecause the full commissionâ€™s order did not meet the requirements of Â§ 1-23-350 and because the full commissionâ€™s order contained an error of law, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26268","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-(C)(a)(3) (2003) and appellant was sentenced to death.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\n Celeste Nesbitt, a close friend of Victim, was the Stateâ€™s witness-in-chief.Â  On the day of the murder, Celeste gave Victim a ride home from work at about 8:00 p.m. Â In the car were Celesteâ€™s two young daughters, four-year-old Keysha and ten-year-old Kiera, who were in the back seat with Victimâ€”Keysha in a car seat behind the front passenger seat, Kiera in the middle, and Victim behind the driverâ€™s seat.Â  Celeste was driving and Celesteâ€™s mother was in the front passenger seat.Â  The car was a Mercury sedan with dark tinted rear windows.\r\n Victim was separated from appellant at the time and was staying with her mother.Â  As they neared Victimâ€™s motherâ€™s house, they saw appellant in his girlfriendâ€™s car.Â  Celeste pulled into the yard and turned the car around so appellant was facing them in a head-on direction.Â  Celeste rolled down her window and greeted him.Â  Appellant asked her if she had seen Victim.Â  Because Celeste knew appellant had threatened to kill Victim, she lied and Â answered that she had not seen her in three days.Â  \r\n Celesteâ€™s youngest daughter, Keysha, leaned forward in her car seat and greeted appellant.Â  Appellant then asked who else was in the back seat. Â Celeste told him Kiera, her older daughter, was lying on the back seat asleep.Â  Because the windows were tinted, appellant asked Celeste to roll down the window so he could see.Â  Celeste answered that the window was broken.Â  When appellant said he would get out to look, Celeste sped off.Â  \r\n Celeste drove to the police department without stopping while Victim dialed 911.Â  When they arrived, Celeste jumped out of the car and urged Victim to get out.Â  Victim was still in the back seat when appellant pulled into the parking lot and ran toward the back of Celesteâ€™s car.Â  Celeste saw him pull out a gun and shoot into the car through the rear windshield.Â  She dove for cover as she heard additional shots.Â  \r\n Officer Godfrey was in the police department parking lot when the dispatcher informed him there was a â€œrolling domestic,â€ meaning a domestic dispute involving a vehicle.Â  He saw the two cars pull into the parking lot, and saw appellant jump out and fire two rounds into Celesteâ€™s car.Â  Officer Godfrey took cover and saw two more flashes from a gun.Â  Appellant came around the front of the car and pointed his gun at Officer Godfrey who then fired four rounds at appellant.Â  Appellant was wounded and fell to the ground.Â  \r\n Victim died at the scene.Â  Four bullets from appellantâ€™s gun were recovered:Â  three from Victimâ€™s head and one from the trunk of Celesteâ€™s car.[1]Â  The bullet recovered from the trunk had traveled through the back seat of the car into the trunk.Â  The car had two bullet holes in the rear driverâ€™s side window and two in the rear windshield.Â  \r\n Other evidence indicated that during their marriage, appellant struck Victim several times in front of witnesses.Â  In December 2001, he beat her in a restaurant parking lot and left the scene before the responding officer could arrest him.Â  On September 17, 2002, the night before the murder, appellant was arrested on a warrant for criminal domestic violence arising from this incident.Â  He was released on a $1,000 bond; one of the conditions of bond was that he have no contact with Victim.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was Juror K improperly disqualified?\r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the trial judge have dismissed Juror M for misconduct during the juryâ€™s view of the car?\r\n3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should a directed verdict have been granted on the aggravating circumstance?\r\n4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the death sentence in this case disproportional to other death penalty cases?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Juror disqualification\r\nAppellant claims the trial judge erred in excusing Juror K who was disqualified because of his views regarding the death penalty. \r\nDuring initial questioning by the court, Juror K was asked if he could impose the death penalty.Â  He answered, â€œI donâ€™t know.Â  I really donâ€™t know if I could or not.â€Â  During subsequent voir dire by defense counsel, the juror gave the following responses.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       . . . . There are going to be some allegations of domestic abuse in this case.Â  Would that affect your ability to give either side a fair trial?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       No, sir.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Would that affect your ability - in the penalty phase, would that influence your decision as to whether or not life or death would be appropriate?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      I donâ€™t know, sir.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       In other words, and I donâ€™t want to put words in your mouth, but as I understand what you are saying is you will be able to listen to both sides in the penalty phase and render what you feel to be the most appropriate penalty whether it be life or whether it be death?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Right.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       You will be able if you felt death was appropriate, you would be able to impose the death penalty?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nUpon questioning by the solicitor, however, Juror K equivocated.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       . . . . I noticed in your questions to (sic) the Judge, you were hesitant about the death penalty.Â  You just did not know about it?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Right.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       You know life without parole is an option.Â  He would never get out if he gets life without parole.Â  With death being an option to you, would you ever give death in a case?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Most of the time I feel it is a better punishment to be in prison for life.Â  I believe that death is not as big of a punishment as going to prison for life and having to stay in prison for the rest of your life.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       You feel life without parole would be a better sentence?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, for something that is - I believe that is worse than the death penalty.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;So that would be the better option to you between the two?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:\r\n       Yeah.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Would that be the option you would give the most cases or all cases?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;I am not positive.Â  I donâ€™t know for sure.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       You donâ€™t know what you would do?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Right, exactly.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Your belief is that life without parole is a more serious punishment than the death penalty?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n      That would be the option you would choose?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Not necessarily but most likely.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Most likely you would do that?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       So substantially that will be your view concerning the case no matter what the facts would be, that would be your view?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n Defense counsel then re-examined the juror.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n      &nbsp;. . . just so that everybody understands.Â  You feel when given the choice between which would be worse, life in prison without parole or death, you feel that life is a worse punishment?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       I believe so, yes.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       However, just so that I understand, if you felt death was appropriate in a case, you could give it?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      Q:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes, I could.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nThe solicitor then followed up with one last question:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Q:\r\n       If I understood when we were talking or whatever, you wouldnâ€™t basically look at the facts of the case, you would look at life without parole being the worse punishment of the two based on your beliefs, is that right, sir?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      A:&nbsp;\r\n       Yes.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n The trial judge found that the belief that life in prison was worse than death would substantially impair the jurorâ€™s ability to follow the law as instructed.Â  He further noted that when asked about giving the death penalty, Juror K â€œtook a very big deep [breath] and exhaled as if he were very uncertain as to whether or not he could do that.â€Â  The judge concluded â€œfrom watching himâ€ and considering his inconsistent responses, that Juror K should be excused.\r\n A prospective juror may be excluded for cause when his or her views on capital punishment would prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in accordance with his instructions and his oath.Â  State v. Sapp, 366 S.C. 283, 621 S.E.2d 883 (2005) (citing Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424 (1985)); State v. Wood, 362 S.C. 135, 607 S.E.2d 57 (2004); State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(E) (2003) (juror may not be excused in a death penalty case unless his beliefs or attitudes against capital punishment would render him unable to return a verdict according to law). Â When reviewing the trial courtâ€™s qualification or disqualification of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged juror must be examined in light of the entire voir dire.Â  Sapp, supra.Â  The determination whether a juror is qualified to serve in a capital case is within the sole discretion of the trial judge and is not reversible on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Id.Â  A jurorâ€™s disqualification will not be disturbed on appeal if there is a reasonable basis from which the trial court could have concluded that the juror would not have been able to faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a juror under the law.Â  Id.; State v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157 (1990).Â  Deference must be paid to the trial court who sees and hears the juror.Â  Wainwright, supra. \r\nJuror Kâ€™s equivocal views regarding the death penalty, his responses favoring a life sentence despite the facts of the case, and his noted hesitation when asked if he could vote for death, are a reasonable basis for the trial judgeâ€™s conclusion that Juror Kâ€™s views would substantially impair his ability to act as an impartial juror.Â  Considering the voir dire as a whole, we find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in excusing this juror.\r\n2.Â  Jury view\r\nDuring the sentencing phase, over appellantâ€™s objection, the trial judge granted the Stateâ€™s request for a jury view of Celesteâ€™s car.[2]Â  After the viewing, defense counsel stated an objection that he saw Juror M\r\n\r\nusing his arm as a dowel or a measurement.Â  He measured both the front driverâ€™s seat and the back seat of the automobile Iâ€™m assuming to get an idea of the position of the people. . . . What he did was he stuck his arm from the door jam to determine the length from the door jam to the middle of the head rest in the front.Â  He did the same thing in the back.Â  He stuck it, he put his arm, he was attempting to use the length of his arm to estimate distance is what it appeared to me.â€Â  \r\n\r\nThe solicitor, on the other hand, stated that he thought the juror was simply testing the tint of the car window.Â  \r\nAppellant moved to have Juror M removed and an alternate juror seated.Â  The trial judge found Juror M had done nothing improper and denied the motion. Â Appellant contends Juror M should have been dismissed because he conducted his own experiment.\r\n A jury may be allowed to view the scene or pieces of evidence but it is improper for the jury to conduct its own experimentation.Â  Stone v. City of Florence, 203 S.C. 527, 28 S.E.2d 409 (1943).Â  The issue is what constitutes â€œexperimentationâ€ such that it rises to the level of juror misconduct.Â  Jurors will not be presumed guilty of misconduct and acts that are merely incidental to an assessment of the evidence are not improper.Â  Id.; see also State v. Buckhalter, 153 S.C. 487, 151 S.E.64 (1930) (not improper experimentation in trial for possessing contraband to allow jury to take liquor into jury room to smell or taste it).Â  However, an attempted re-enactment of the facts at issue will render a jurorâ€™s conduct improper. Â See, e.g., State v. Ballew, 83 S.C. 82, 63 S.E. 688 (1909)(jurors attempted to throw a hatchet against the wall of a jail cell to re-enact the prosecutorâ€™s description of the crime); Baroody v. Anderson, 195 S.C. 422, 11 S.E.2d 860 (1940) (jury asked the sheriff to drive his car around the curve where the wreck occurred at 35 mph in order to observe it approaching). \r\nWe find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in refusing to dismiss Juror M. Â See State v. Simmons, 360 S.C. 33, 599 S.E.2d 448 (2004) (within trial judgeâ€™s discretion to substitute alternate juror).Â  First, it is not clear the juror was actually â€œtaking measurements,â€ as appellant claims, and we will not presume a juror engaged in misconduct.Â  There was no attempted re-enactment of the crime, rather Juror Mâ€™s actions were merely incidental to an assessment of the evidence.Â  Moreover, photographs in evidence show the carâ€™s back seat, where the bullet hole was, where the childâ€™s car seat was, and where Victim was sitting.Â  There is no real dispute regarding the measurements of the back seat such that any â€œmeasurementsâ€ by Juror M would have carried undue weight in jury deliberations. Â \r\n3.Â  Directed verdict on aggravating circumstance\r\nAppellant moved for a directed verdict on the statutory aggravator provided in Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(3) which states:\r\n\r\nThat the offender by his act of murder knowingly created a great risk of death to more than one person in a public place by means of a weapon or device which normally would be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.\r\n\r\nAppellant contends that because he shot Victim at close range and no other person was endangered, this aggravator should not apply as a matter of law.\r\n The trial judge should submit a statutory aggravator to the jury if there is any evidence, direct or circumstantial, to support it.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000).Â  Here, the police department parking lot is clearly a public place and a gun is a weapon hazardous to more than one person.Â  Id. (shooting in church parking lot).Â  Further, appellant knew there were other occupants in the car with Victim when he shot multiple times into the confined space of the carâ€™s interiorâ€”conduct a reasonable person would know presents a great risk of harm to more than one person.Â  Appellant also pointed his gun at Officer Godfrey in the parking lot.Â  This evidence supports the submission of the statutory aggravator to the jury.\r\n4.Â  Proportionality review\r\nAppellant contends the imposition of death in his case is disproportionate to other death penalty cases because his case involves only a single victim and resulted from a domestic dispute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25 (2003) (proportionality review).Â  \r\n We find no support for appellantâ€™s attempt to reduce this crime to simply â€œa domestic dispute.â€Â  Appellantâ€™s culpability is not lessened by the fact that the victim was his wife.Â  There is no evidence of any immediate dispute leading up to the murder,[3] much less any provocation on Victimâ€™s part.Â  In fact, appellant intentionally violated a court order forbidding contact with Victim.Â  \r\nFurther, as discussed above, the evidence supports the submission of the aggravating factor in this case.Â  The legislature has determined that a unanimous verdict on only one aggravating factor is sufficient to support the death penalty.Â  There have been numerous capital cases where the jury found only a single aggravator and death was imposed.Â  See,e.g., State v. Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000) (killing police officer); State v. Rogers, 338 S.C. 435, 527 S.E.2d 101 (2000) (killing child under age of eleven); State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 519 S.E.2d 574 (1999) (armed robbery); Ray v. State, 330 S.C. 184, 498 S.E.2d 640 (1998) (kidnapping); State v. Atkins, 303 S.C. 214, 399 S.E.2d 760 (1990) (prior murder conviction). Â We find appellantâ€™s disproportionality argument without merit.Â  \r\nWe have reviewed the record and conclude the imposition of death in this case was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, nor is it excessive or disproportionate to the penalty imposed in other cases.Â  The judgment of the circuit court is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Five shell casings were found but the fifth bullet was not recovered.Â  A paramedic testified for the defense that when he arrived on the scene to transport appellant to the hospital, appellant said he had shot himself in the head. \r\n[2] Appellant objected that seeing the car would be unfairly prejudicial because instead of focusing on the â€œspatial relationshipsâ€ in the car, the jury would be affected by the fact that Victim had been killed there.Â  \r\n[3] Appellantâ€™s mother testified generally in the sentencing phase that appellant was upset he was not allowed to see his children.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26269","title":"SC Department of Mental Health v.

Binkley, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert D.

Hayes, Jr., of Columbia, for Amicus Curiae, National Alliance on Mental Illness.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  We accepted this matter in our original jurisdiction to issue a declaratory judgment as to whether or not certain property owned by the Department of Mental Health (DMH), referred to as the â€œBull Street Property,â€ is held in a charitable trust and, if so, whether and under what conditions it may be sold.Â  We hold the property is subject to a charitable trust but may be sold in accordance with our discussion below.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe State Lunatic Asylum was created in 1821.[1]Â  The Act creating the Asylum implemented a board of seven trustees to be elected by the Legislature, â€œwho shall superintend the public institutions herby intended to be established.â€Â  1821 Acts No. 2269.Â  The following year, the General Assembly passed Act. No. 2286 of 1822 entitled, â€œAn Act to vest the title of the lot upon which the lunatic asylum stands, in the trustees and visiters of said asylum.â€Â  \r\nâ€œBull Street,â€ as it has become known, is made up of 185.6 acres, excepting approximately 4.5 acres which contain the Mills Building and surrounding grounds.Â  The Mills Building was the initial site of the asylum.Â Â  The property was originally 14 separate tracts of land, and was acquired by the DMH and its predecessors in a series of transactions occurring between the 1820â€™s and 1905.Â  The record contains deeds evidencing 12 of these transactions; the remaining 2 parcels were acquired prior to the 1860â€™s, and no deeds are available.Â  \r\nSeveral of the deeds contain restrictive language requiring the property to be used â€œfor the use and purposes of the State Hospital for the Insane.â€Â  The initial two parcels, conveying a total of 31.5 acres, were conveyed to â€œThe Regents of the Lunatic Asylum of South Carolina, its successors and assigns forever.â€Â  The third parcel, comprising 50 acres, was conveyed to â€œThe Regents of the Lunatic Asylum of South Carolina, their successors in office, for their only proper use, benefit, and behoof, forever.â€ Â Parcels 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 all grant property to the Regents of the State Hospital â€œand their successors and assigns forever for the use and purposes of the said State Hospital.â€Â  Each of the parcels was sold to the Board of Regents for a stated consideration, ranging from $5.00 (Parcel 15, .59 acres) to $24,500.00Â  (Parcel 8, 108.45 acres). Â Throughout the years, numerous properties owned by the State Hospital were sold to various entities, the proceeds generally going to the DMH.[2]Â  Most of these sales were authorized by the General Assembly and or the Budget and Control Board.Â  \r\nIn 2004, as part of the Appropriations Act, the General Assembly passed Proviso 73.18 to â€œestablish a comprehensive central property and office management facility process to plan for the needs of state government agencies and to achieve maximum efficiency and economy in the use of state owned or state leased real property.â€Â  Pursuant to the proviso, the Budget and Control Board was directed to identify all state owned properties and title to all such properties, excepting those the Board determined were subject to reverter clauses or other restraints upon transfer of title.Â  The proviso further states that, â€œ[u]pon a determination by the Board that a property should be sold, the agency is required to sell the property and remit the proceeds as directed herein.â€ \r\nIn the 2005 Appropriations Act, the General Assembly enacted Proviso 63.40, which was vetoed by the Governor, but overridden by the Legislature.Â  Proviso 63.40 provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n  Up to 50% of the proceeds, net of selling expenses, from the sale of surplus real properties shall be retained by the Budget and Control Board and used for the deferred maintenance of state-owned buildings. The remaining 50% of the net proceeds shall be returned to the agency that the property is owned by, under the control of, or assigned to and shall be used by that agency for non-recurring purposes. \r\n\r\nAfter inquiries as to whether some of the State Hospital properties could be sold for development, the Attorney General requested the Executive Director of the Budget and Control Board (Board) for his advice and conclusions as to whether there were any prohibitions or limitations on the sale of the Bull Street property, and whether it was encumbered by a charitable trust.Â  The Board responded as follows:\r\n\r\n  The current thinking among experts practicing in the mental health field is that large complexes like the Bull Street site which isolate patients and separate them from their communities is not the best situation for the treatment and successful re-integration of patients into the general population.Â  The thinking is that the Bull Street tract is not specifically needed to house mental health facilities and that it would be more efficient and economical for the State and Department of Mental Health to sell this property, relocate facilities, and reinvest the proceeds that would be derived. . . .Â  \r\n\r\nThe Board noted the property upon which the Mills Building is situated was not included in any plans by the State to sell the property and would remain in State ownership.Â  The Board concluded the property was not encumbered by a charitable trust, such that it believed the General Assembly could authorize a sale of the property.Â  The Board concluded, however, that it would defer to the Attorney Generalâ€™s opinion on the matter.[3]Â Â  \r\nIn response, the Attorney General issued an opinion on December 9, 2005, concluding as follows: \r\n\r\n  [A] court would most likely conclude that the Department of Mental Health, as successor to the State Lunatic Asylum and South Carolina State Hospital for the Insane, is a â€˜public charityâ€™ and that the Bull Street property is thus impressed with a charitable trust. Accordingly, we recommend that prior to any sale, the Department of Mental Health seek court approval of such sale, consistent with the basic principle that a court of equity must approve, by way of equitable deviation, any such transfer.\r\n\r\nThe Attorney General stated that as an alternative, the Legislature could protect the charitable trust by requiring the proceeds from any sale to be devoted exclusively to the Department of Mental Health.\r\nIn light of the Attorney Generalâ€™s opinion, the DMH filed a petition for original jurisdiction as to whether the Bull Street property is encumbered by a charitable trust and, if so, whether and under what conditions the property may be sold.Â  We agree with the Attorney Generalâ€™s opinion that the property is subject to a charitable trust.Â  However, given the change in circumstances in the care and treatment of mental health patients, we hold the doctrine of equitable deviation may be employed to allow a sale of the property with disbursement of the proceeds to be placed in trust for the benefit of DMH.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.Â  Is the Bull Street property held subject to a charitable trust for the benefit of the Department of Mental Health?\r\n  2.Â  If Bull Street is subject to a charitable trust, under what circumstances may the property be sold, and to whom are the proceeds disbursed?\r\n\r\n1.Â  CHARITABLE TRUST\r\nThis Court has recognized the benevolent purposes of the state hospital.Â  See Crouch v. Benet, 198 S.C. 185, 17 S.E.2d 320, 323 (1941) (holding that South Carolina was a pioneer of the southern states in the care of the insane which has been supported, maintained, and â€œpursuant to Acts of the Legislature and by means of appropriations for this most worthy, humane and beneficent purpose as a State Institution.â€ Moreover, institutions for the insane are constitutionally provided for and subject to regulation by the General Assembly.Â  Article 12, Â§ 1, CONST 1895.\r\nA charitable trust is defined as: \r\n\r\n  [A] fiduciary relationship with respect to property arising as a result of a manifestation of an intention to create it, and subjecting the person by whom the property is held to equitable duties to deal with property for a charitable purpose.Â  Restatement (2nd) TrustsÂ  Â§ 348 (1959). . . .Â  The settlor must manifest an intention to create a charitable trust. Â It is not necessary that any particular words or conduct be manifest to create a trust, and it is possible to create a trust without using the words â€œtrustâ€ or â€œtrustee.â€\r\n\r\nScott on Trusts Â§Â§ 24--25 (2d Ed. 1956); Restatement (2nd) Trusts Â§ 24. Conversely, the mere fact these words are used, or other similar words, does not necessarily indicate an intention to create a trust.\r\nIn the 1922 case of Harter v. Johnson, 122 S.C. 96, 115 S.E. 217 (1922), the Court was called upon to interpret the will of a deceased physician who had, by his will, bequeathed â€œ[a]ll the residue of my estate, real and personal and mixed, . . . I give and devise, for the purpose of establishing, building and equipping a public hospital in the town of Fairfax, for the treatment of white and colored patients.â€Â  This Court, in addressing the issue of whether a charitable trust had been created, stated:\r\n\r\n  Trusts for public charitable purposes, being for objects of permanent interest and benefit to the public, and perhaps being perpetual in their duration, are upheld under circumstances under which private trusts would fail. . . . \r\n  No formality in the use of language is necessary in order to create a public charitable trust. The courts look to the purpose for which the gift was made, rather than to the particular words used to designate that purpose. Â And while a gift cannot be sustained as a charity unless made upon a trust, either express or implied, that it shall be devoted to uses which the law recognizes as charitable, the omission from a bequest of the words in trust is not material, where the intention is clearly manifested that the whole property shall be applied by the legatee for the benefit of other persons than himself. . . . \r\n  [it] is said: â€˜The founding and maintenance of hospitals and asylums of various kinds, and homes for destitute and friendless children, and the aged and infirm, constitute charitable uses or trusts, and bequests, devises, or other gifts for such purposes will be upheld in equity with a strong hand. Trusts for such purposes may be established and carried into effect, when, if not of a charitable nature, they could not be supported.Â  \r\n\r\n115 S.E.2d at 221-222.Â  The Court has similarly found the existence of a charitable trust in cases in which it has not been expressly stated.Â  See Watson v. Wall, 229 S.C. 500, 93 S.E.2d 918 (1956) (testamentary provision wherein testator directed that any surplus left after application of funds to specific purposes might be used to aid poor and indigent to obtain medical care and hospitalization in judgment of testator's executor or executors was not so indefinite or general as to be ineffectual to create a charitable trust); Porcher v. Cappelmann, 187 S.C. 491, 198 S.E. 8, 9 (1938) (valid charitable trust created where testatrix bequeathed residuary estate to a named trustee, â€œto be used and expended in such manner as he may deem wise in assistance in the City of Columbia, S. C., to crippled children, in the provision of medical and surgical attention to such children, purchase of medicines, braces or other appliances or any other article to assist and benefit said children, said work for crippled children to be conducted in the City of Columbia, S. C.â€).Â  \r\nFurther, as noted by the Attorney General, properties conveyed to a public charity are also impressed with a charitable trust.Â  See Wellesley College v. Attorney General, 313 Mass. 722, 49 N.E.2d 220 (1943); In Re Los Angeles County Pioneer Society, 257 P.2d 1, 9 (Ca. 1953) (â€œIn cases where . . . property is conveyed without restriction to a charitable corporation . . . the charitable intent of the donor is ascertained by reference to the charitable purposes of the donee.â€); In re Harringtonâ€™s Estate, 36 N.W.2d 577, 582 (Neb. 1949) (a gift or bequest by name, without further restriction or limitation as to use, to a corporation conducted solely for charitable purposes, will be deemed to have been made for the objects and purposes for which the corporation was organized); Brown v. St. Lukeâ€™s Hosp. Assn., 274 P.2d 740 (Colo. 1929) (St. Lukeâ€™s Hospital came into being as, and continued to remain, a charitable institution such that all property held or acquired by it was impressed with a trust for the charitable uses and purposes).\r\nWe find the Arizona Supreme Courtâ€™s opinion in Goddard v. Coerver, 412 P.2d 259 (Ariz. 1966), directly on point.Â  Like this case, Goddard involved land purchased for a state insane asylum.Â  In September 1885, the Board of Supervisors of Maricopa County, Arizona, purchased 160 acres of land for $3500.00Â  On October 8, 1885, this same 160 acres was conveyed by the Board of Supervisors to the Board of Directors of the Insane Asylum of Arizona.Â  The deed conveyed the property to the Directors â€œfor the use and benefit of the Territory of Arizona And for said Asylum.â€Â  412 P.2d at 261.Â  The deed went on to state, â€œfor the use and benefit of the Territory . . . , and for said asylum in accordance with the provisions of the said acts of said Legislature.â€Â  Id. at 262.Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  However, the deed also purported to vest title in the directors, their assigns and successors, in fee simple absolute.Â  Id.Â  In 1965, the Asylum Board expressed an interest in selling 62 acres of the property to Maricopa County as a site for a new Maricopa County General Hospital.Â  At the time, the property was being put to agricultural purposes in support of the asylum.Â  The Arizona Supreme Court held the property had been conveyed to the Board of Directors in the form of a charitable trust.[4]Â Â  \r\nAs in Goddard, the property here was conveyed for the charitable purposes of the State Hospital for the Insane.Â  It was conveyed to the Board of Regents of the Hospital, and the General Assembly enacted enabling legislation specifically for the benevolent purpose of establishing a hospital for the insane.Â  The General Assembly also deemed fit that title to the property vest in the Board of Regents, and has routinely authorized the appropriation of funds for its charitable purposes.Â  We find that the deeds and the legislative acts giving rise to the State Hospital clearly evidence the creation of a charitable trust.Â  Accordingly, we find the property is held in trust for the DMH.Â  \r\n2.Â  SALE OF PROPERTY\r\nProperty subject to a charitable trust may not be terminated or altered by the General Assembly, but rather, must be approved by the court.Â  Smith v. Moore, 225 F. Supp. 434 (D. E. Va. 1963) (legislature cannot terminate a charitable trust, nor seek to control its disposition under doctrine of cy pres;Â  however this does not mean that Legislature cannot properly reserve to the judicial branch the power to do so); see also Second Ecclesiastical Society of Hartford v. Attorney General, 48 A.2d 266 (Conn. 1946) (supervision of charitable trusts is an inherent judicial function and is not a matter for the legislature. Â As a court of equity, the court possesses the authority to carry out the intent of the donor of a charitable trust). \r\nThis Court has previously applied the doctrine of equitable deviation, which â€œpermits deviation from a term of the trust if, owing to circumstances not known to the settlor and not anticipated by him, compliance would defeat or substantially impair the accomplishment of the purposes of the trust. Under these circumstances a court may direct or permit a trustee to accomplish acts that are unauthorized or even forbidden by the terms of the trust.â€Â  Epworth Childrenâ€™s Home v. Beasley, 365 S.C. 157, 169, 616 S.E.2d 710, 716-717 (2005), citing Colin McK. Grant Home v. Medlock, 292 S.C. 466, 473, 349 S.E.2d 655, 659 (Ct.App.1986) (allowing trustees to deviate from original terms of charitable trust by selling six homes built in Charleston to serve needy, elderly, white Presbyterians and investing proceeds of sale with income distributed as housing subsidy to elderly, needy Presbyterians of all races).\r\nConsiderable flexibility will always be allowed in the details of the execution of a trust, so as to adapt it to the changed conditions.Â  Mars v. Gibert, 93 S.C. 455, 466, 77 S.E. 131, 135 (1913) (refusing to allow trustees of John de la Howe School to deviate from original terms of charitable trust contained in 1797 will by devoting funds to college scholarships instead of early education, but explaining trustees could establish a school at a different location, which could work in conjunction with public school system to teach agricultural and mechanical arts); All Saints Parish, Waccamaw v. Protestant Episcopal Church, 358 S.C. 209, 227, 595 S.E.2d 253, 263 (Ct.App.2004).\r\nIt is undisputed that the Bull Street property is no longer necessary to house mentally ill patients.Â  Accordingly, we find the doctrine of equitable deviation should be utilized to allow the property to be sold.Â  However, we hold that the proceeds from any sale of the property must remain in trust for the benefit of DMH for the care and treatment of the mentally ill.Â  \r\nDECLARATORY JUDGMENT ISSUED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The preamble to the Act recognized,Â  â€œ. . . the benevolent purposes of society require, on the part of the State, a public institution for the reception and cure of lunatics, for the instruction of the deaf and dumb, and for the maintenance of the poor and destitute of either class.â€Â  \r\n[2] Â No issue is before this Court concerning prior sales of Bull Street properties.Â  However, we note that our opinion today in no way affects or invalidates any prior sales, to which there has never been an objection.\r\n[3]Â  Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-7-130 (1976), the Attorney General is charged with the protection of public charities and is required to enforce the due application of funds given or appropriated to such charities.\r\n[4]Â  In addition, the Court concluded that the unused portion of these lands could, consistent with the principles of equitable deviation, be approved by the court for reconveyance by the Hospital's board of directors to the county for construction of a general hospital.Â  The equitable deviation issue will be addressed below.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26271","title":"State v.

Â Ms. Northcutt then found the babyâ€™s body in the crib, and called emergency personnel.Â  \r\n \r\nAn autopsy revealed severe and extensive trauma to the childâ€™s body and significant bruising, internal hemorrhaging, and bone fractures indicative of shaken baby syndrome.Â  According to the examining pathologist, more than one of the babyâ€™s injuries alone were potentially fatal.Â  He estimated the injuries were inflicted over a seven to fifteen minute time frame, although it could have been as little as two to three minutes.Â  He testified there were no old bruises or injuries on her body and that all injuries stemmed from this single event. \r\n \r\nThe jury found Appellant guilty of murder.Â  In the sentencing phase the State introduced evidence in aggravation of punishment including: (1) suspensions and school vandalism by the Appellant when he was in middle school; (2) an incident, for which he served one year in the Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ), in which Appellant brought a loaded handgun to school; and (3) three disciplinary infractions Appellant committed during his two-and-a-half years in pre-trial confinement.Â  Appellant presented evidence in mitigation showing he suffered physical violence and emotional abuse at the hand of his alcoholic father who, at the time of Appellantâ€™s trial, was serving an eight-year prison sentence for sexually molesting Appellantâ€™s nine-year-old half-sister.Â  Evidence also showed Appellant failed to receive help or treatment from the Department of Social Services (DSS), despite numerous child abuse complaints and injuries to Appellant from the time he was age five until age fourteen.Â  The jury returned a death sentence.Â  \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    &nbsp;I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial judge err in denying Appellant&rsquo;s request to submit homicide by child abuse as a lesser-included offense of murder?\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial judge err in requiring Appellant to direct his expert witnesses to generate written reports for the prosecution?\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial judge err in admitting evidence that the baby had suffered a broken leg at age ten-weeks while Appellant was removing her from a swing-seat, in the absence of any evidence that the injury was the result of child abuse?\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    IV.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the trial judge err in admitting a letter from Ms. Northcutt to a defense social worker in which Ms. Northcutt stated she had &ldquo;no sympathy&rdquo; for Appellant?\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    V.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Should Appellant have been permitted to introduce a letter to his wife expressing remorse for the death of their baby in response to the wife&rsquo;s testimony that Appellant&rsquo;s post-arrest phone calls to her had shown a lack of remorse and concern?\r\n\t\r\n  \r\n  \r\n    VI.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the solicitor&rsquo;s closing argument so infect the jury&rsquo;s sentencing determination with passion and prejudice that it requires reversal of the death sentence?&nbsp; \r\n\t \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn criminal cases, this Court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v. Cutter, 261 S.C. 140, 199 S.E.2d 61 (1973).Â  This Court is bound by the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings unless they are clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Wilson, 345 S.C. 1, 545 S.E.2d 827 (2001).Â  \r\n \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Lesser-Included Offense\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred in failing to submit homicide by child abuse as a lesser-included offense of the murder of a child under age twelve.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe indictment charged Appellant with the crime of murder under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (Supp. 2005).Â  The State submitted a notice of evidence in aggravation of punishment listing the following statutory aggravators: (1) the murder was committed in the commission of physical torture; and (2) the victim was a child eleven years of age or under.[1]Â  \r\n \r\nThe test for determining whether a crime is a lesser included offense of the crime charged is whether the greater of the two offenses includes all the elements of the lesser offense.Â  Hope v. State, 328 S.C. 78, 492 S.E.2d 76&nbsp;(1997). Â If the lesser offense includes an element not included in greater offense, then the lesser offense is not included in the greater.Â  Id.Â  \r\n \r\nHomicide by child abuse requires proof of the death of a child under age eleven during the commission of child abuse or neglect and the death occurs under circumstances showing extreme indifference to human life.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-85 (2003).Â  Murder is the â€œkilling of any person with malice aforethought, either express or implied.â€Â  Id. Â§ 16-3-10.Â  \r\n \r\nHomicide by child abuse is not a lesser included offense of murder.Â  An element of homicide by child abuse, the death of a child under age eleven, is not an element of murder.Â  Thus, the elements test has not been met.Â  â€œA lesser offense is included in the greater only if each of its elements is always a necessary element of the greater offense.â€Â  Knox v. State, 340 S.C. 81, 530 S.E.2d 887, overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).[2]\r\nÂ When an offense fails to meet the elements test, this Court will nevertheless construe it as a lesser included offense if the offense has traditionally been considered a lesser included offense of the greater offense charged.Â  State v. Burton, 356 S.C. 259, 264, 589 S.E.2d 6, 8&nbsp;(2003) (citing State v. Watson, 349 S.C. 372, 563 S.E.2d 336 (2002)).Â  There is no historical antecedent suggesting homicide by child abuse is a lesser included offense of murder.Â  Because homicide by child abuse is not a lesser included offense of murder under either the elements test or the historical antecedent test, the trial judge did not err in denying Appellantâ€™s request to submit homicide by child abuse as a lesser included offense of murder.Â \r\nII.Â  Expert Reports\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by requiring him to direct his expert witnesses to generate written reports for the benefit of the prosecution.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nBefore trial, the State submitted a motion requesting the names and addresses of all potential expert witnesses upon whom Appellant intended to rely to establish a mental defense or â€œany other mental deficiency.â€Â  The State also requested Appellant â€œdisclose the conclusions and reports of any and all potential expert witnesses reduced to writing and accompanied by any and all written materials and all other materials upon which such an opinion is based.â€Â  The motion failed to cite any South Carolina rule governing pretrial discovery.Â  The trial judge ordered Appellant to comply with the Stateâ€™s request, noting the â€œstandard procedure has been to require both sides to produce reports.â€Â  \r\n \r\nRule 5(b)(1)(B) of the South Carolina Rules of Criminal Procedure creates a right of reciprocal discovery: \r\n \r\n\r\n  If the defendant requests disclosure under subdivision (a)(1)(C) or (D) of this rule, upon compliance with such request by the prosecution, the defendant, on request of the prosecution, shall permit the prosecution to inspect and copy any results or reports of physical or mental examinations and of scientific tests or experiments made in connection with the particular case, or copies thereof, within the possession or control of the defendant, which the defendant intends to introduce as evidence in chief at the trial or which were prepared by a witness whom the defendant intends to call at trial when the results or reports relate to his testimony.Â  \r\n\t \r\n\r\nThe rule requires the production of reports â€œwithin the possessionâ€ of the defense.Â  However, it does not authorize the trial judge to require parties to generate written reports solely for the benefit of the opponent.Â  Therefore, the trial judge erred in requiring Appellant to direct his expert witnesses to prepare written reports for the prosecution.Â Â  \r\n \r\nDetermining the trial judge committed error is the first step of our analysis.Â  Next we must determine whether the error was harmless.Â  Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563, 572, 552 S.E.2d 718, 723&nbsp;(2001) (â€œthe harmless error rule and a prejudice analysis are no strangers to cases involving the death penaltyâ€).\r\n\r\n  Whether an error is harmless depends on the circumstances of the particular case. No definite rule of law governs this finding; rather, the materiality and prejudicial character of the error must be determined from its relationship to the entire case. Error is harmless when it â€œcould not reasonably have affected the result of the trial.â€\r\n\r\nState v. Mitchell, 286 S.C. 572, 573, 336 S.E.2d 150, 151&nbsp;(1985) (citing State v. Key, 256 S.C. 90, 180 S.E.2d 888 (1971)).Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant argues the State was unfairly benefited by the reports and was able to prosecute and cross-examine more vigorously because of the reports.Â  The State contends, and we agree, the written reports generated by Appellantâ€™s experts did not advantage the State any more than the notes, data, and other materials properly disclosed under Rule 5, SCRCrimP.Â  The written reports only summarized the contents of other discoverable materials.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant also argues the erroneous extension of Rule 5(b), S.C.R.Crim.P., by the trial judge resulted in the prejudicial exclusion of certain testimony from Dr. Tracy Gunter.Â  Dr. Gunter performed a family court-ordered evaluation of Appellant at DJJ in 1995.[3]Â  Although she diagnosed appellant with conduct disorder in 1995, she changed her diagnosis to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder before the 2003 litigation in light of new information.Â  The trial judge excluded any testimony not related to the 1995 evaluation because Dr. Gunterâ€™s written report was based only on her 1995 encounter with Appellant. \r\n \r\nAlthough Dr. Gunterâ€™s entire testimony was critical in establishing mitigating evidence for Appellant, there was no prejudice to Appellant.Â  Dr. Gunter was able to convey the crux of her testimony by stating she was hampered in her evaluation of Appellant in 1995 by a lack of DSS records showing the abuse Appellant had endured at the hand of his father.Â  Dr. Gunter expressed concerns at the time of the evaluation that Appellant might have Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder or some type of dissociative disorder.Â  She further stated her 1995 diagnosis was not reliable or credible due to the lack of DSS records made available to her.Â  Because the erroneous extension of Rule 5, S.C.R.Crim.P., by the trial judge could not reasonably have affected the result of the trial, we conclude the error was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. \r\n \r\nIII.Â  Evidence of the Babyâ€™s Prior Injury\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erroneously admitted evidence the baby suffered a broken leg at age ten-weeks when Appellant removed her from a swing-seat.Â  We agree. \r\n \r\nDuring the sentencing phase of Appellantâ€™s trial, the State introduced evidence that in October, 2000, nearly two months prior to the babyâ€™s death, Appellant accidentally injured her while removing her from a swing-seat.Â  The baby was diagnosed with and treated for a spiral fracture of the leg.Â  The diagnosis of such an injury at a hospital is a â€œred flagâ€ for possible child abuse; however, the treating physician did not refer the matter to DSS, the logical inference being the physician ruled out child abuse after treating the baby and meeting the parents.[4]Â  The State argued the fact Appellant caused the injury was sufficient to warrant the introduction of the evidence as relevant to the issue of his character and his relationship with his baby.Â  Appellant argued the jury would interpret â€œan accident that could have happened to anybodyâ€ as child abuse through â€œthe distorting lens of hindsight.â€Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nThe admission of evidence is left to the sound discretion of the trial judge whose decision will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 540 S.E.2d 464 (2000).Â  The trial judge abused his discretion in admitting evidence of the prior injury because it unfairly prejudiced Appellant.Â  Not only is such evidence arguably irrelevant, it is highly prejudicial and should have been excluded pursuant to Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Further, the error in admitting evidence the baby had suffered this injury was not harmless.Â  The Stateâ€™s purpose in introducing the evidence was to shed light on Appellantâ€™s relationship with the baby and to highlight the family tension that ensued during the two months prior to the babyâ€™s death.Â  The babyâ€™s prior injury was, under all accounts, an accident.Â  However, in light of Appellantâ€™s outburst of violence against his baby two months after this injury, the jury likely misperceived the evidence resulting in unfair prejudice to Appellant.Â  The erroneous admission of this evidence requires reversal of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  State v. Locklair, 341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) (in order for an error to warrant reversal, the error must result in prejudice to the appellant).Â  \r\n \r\nIV.Â  Letter from Ms. Northcutt\r\nAppellant argues the trial judge erred by admitting a letter from Ms. Northcutt to a defense social worker in which Ms. Northcutt stated she had â€œno sympathyâ€ for Appellant.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\n \r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Arlene Andrews, a defense social worker, testified she tried to talk with Ms. Northcutt about the parental care of the baby; however, Ms. Northcutt declined to be interviewed.Â  In an effort to impeach the witness, the solicitor read a letter written to Dr. Andrews by Ms. Northcutt in which Ms. Northcutt stated: â€œI have no sympathy for him and his actions, nor do I have any recollections or thought (sic) that would be sympathetic to him in any way.â€Â  The trial judge overruled Appellantâ€™s objection and allowed the letter into evidence.Â  \r\n \r\nAppellant argues the State improperly introduced evidence of the victimâ€™s family memberâ€™s opinion in violation of Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496, 107 S.Ct. 2529, 96 L.Ed.2d 440 (1987), overruled on other grounds by Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 830 n.2, 111 S.Ct. 2597, 2611 n.2, 115 L.Ed.2d 720, 721 (1991) (â€œadmission of a victimâ€™s family membersâ€™ characterizations and opinions about the crime, the defendant, and the appropriate sentence violates the Eighth Amendmentâ€).Â  Expressing a lack of sympathy, however, does not offend the Booth proscription.Â  Rather than expressing her opinion of Appellant, Ms. Northcutt was responding to Dr. Andrewâ€™s inquiry. \r\n \r\nThe trial judge did not err in admitting the letter from Ms. Northcutt to Dr. Andrews.Â  Even if the admission of the letter were error, the error was harmless.Â  In light of Ms. Northcuttâ€™s testimony and the record before us, the admission of the letter did not prejudice Appellant nor did it affect the result of the trial.Â  \r\n \r\nV.Â  Letter from Appellant\r\nAppellant argues he should have been permitted to introduce a letter he wrote to his wife expressing remorse for the death of their child in response to Ms. Northcuttâ€™s testimony that his post-arrest phone calls to her showed a lack of remorse and concern.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nMs. Northcutt testified of a series of phone calls she received from Appellant while he was in pre-trial confinement.Â  Ms. Northcuttâ€™s testimony implied Appellant never expressed concern for her or their deceased child or remorse for his actions.Â  On cross-examination, counsel for Appellant attempted to question her about a letter she received from Appellant nine days following the murder.Â  The letter written by Appellant expressed remorse and sorrow for his actions.Â  \r\n \r\nThe trial judge erroneously excluded the evidence. Â The prosecution had opened the door for Appellant to present evidence of his remorse.Â  Appellant is entitled to rebut the Stateâ€™s argument and correct the false impression the State conveyed to the jury.Â  The portion of the letter directly addressing Appellantâ€™s remorse was admissible.Â  The State cannot preclude the jury from considering â€œany relevant mitigating evidenceâ€ the defendant proffers in support of sentence less than death.Â  Payne, 501 U.S. at 822, 111 S.Ct. at 2606, 115 L.Ed.2d at 721 (citing Eddings v. Oklahoma, 455 U.S. 104, 114, 102 S.Ct. 869, 877, 71 L.Ed.2d 1, 1 (1982)).Â  The letter, as a whole, however, is subject to redaction because portions are inadmissible hearsay.[5]Â  A portion of the letter is admissible for the limited purpose of rebutting the Stateâ€™s argument Appellant had no remorse.\r\nAlthough it was error for the trial judge to exclude the letter written from Appellant to Ms. Northcutt expressing remorse, the error was harmless.Â  The record contains evidence of Appellantâ€™s remorse.Â  Appellant was not prejudiced, nor was the outcome of the trial affected. \r\n \r\nVI.Â  Closing Argument\r\nAppellant argues the solicitorâ€™s sentencing-phase closing argument so infected the juryâ€™s sentencing determination with passion and prejudice that it requires reversal of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  We agree.Â  \r\n \r\nA trial judge is vested with broad discretion in dealing with the range of propriety of closing argument, and ordinarily his rulings on such matters will not be disturbed. Â State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766&nbsp;(1997).Â  We must review the argument in the context of the entire record. Â Id.Â  The appellant has the burden of showing that any alleged error in argument deprived him of a fair trial. State v. Bell, 302 S.C. 18, 393 S.E.2d 364 (1990). The relevant question is whether the solicitorâ€™s comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, 416 U.S. 637, 94 S.Ct. 1868, 40 L.Ed.2d 431 (1974). Â Solicitors are bound to rules of fairness in their closing arguments as we explained in State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 312, 278 S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981):\r\n\r\n  While the solicitor should prosecute vigorously, his duty is not to convict a defendant but to see justice done.Â  The solicitorâ€™s closing argument must, of course, be based upon this principle.Â  The argument therefore must be carefully tailored so as not to appeal to the personal bias of the juror nor be calculated to arouse his passion or prejudice.Â  \r\n\t \r\n\r\nWe evaluate the closing argument in light of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(1) (2003) to determine â€œwhether the sentence of death was imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.â€\r\nAppellant argues the solicitor violated this well-established rule by (1) crying numerous times throughout the argument; (2) telling the jury â€œwe will kick the baby some moreâ€ if they returned a life sentence; (3) dehumanizing Appellant (â€œI donâ€™t even call him a personâ€); (4) threatening the jury (â€œit will be on your heads if he kills someone else [during his life sentence in prison]â€); (5) declaring an â€œopen season on babies;â€ (6) telling the jury he â€œexpectsâ€ the death penalty; and (7) enacting a funeral procession complete with a black shroud covering the babyâ€™s crib.Â  \r\n \r\nThree of the solicitorâ€™s arguments require reversal of the sentence.[6]Â  First, the solicitor suggested declaring an â€œopen season on babies in Lexington Countyâ€ if the death penalty was not returned.Â  The sole purpose of this statement was to inflame the jury.Â  The solicitor also repeatedly told the jury he â€œexpectsâ€ the death penalty and, in doing so, ignored our precedent which rebukes such an imposition of the solicitorâ€™s personal belief.[7]Â  Finally, he concluded his argument by producing a large black shroud and draping it over the babyâ€™s crib.Â  He wheeled the crib from the courtroom in a staged funeral procession.Â  \r\n \r\nAny one of these three miscues requires reversal of Appellantâ€™s sentence.Â  The State admits the solicitorâ€™s comments constituted error, but contends the brutality of the crime and the fact Appellant himself asked for the death penalty require this Court uphold the sentence.[8]Â  While it is difficult to determine the impact of the evidence on the jury and the Appellantâ€™s own request for a death sentence, it is clear the solicitor was overly zealous in his argument.Â  State v. White, 246 S.C. 502, 507, 144 S.E.2d 481, 483&nbsp;(1965) (â€œIn view of the absolute discretion of the jury with regard to the issue of mercy, it is impossible to determine whether the argument actually had a prejudicial effect upon the verdict.â€).Â  We conclude the solicitorâ€™s closing argument requires reversal of Appellantâ€™s death sentence because the sentence was imposed under the influence of passion and prejudice in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause of the solicitorâ€™s prejudicial closing argument and the inclusion of evidence of the childâ€™s prior leg injury, we reverse Appellantâ€™s death sentence and remand for further sentencing proceedings.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.Â   \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion.Â  PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the trial court did not err in admitting evidence regarding the victimâ€™s prior leg injury.Â  Furthermore, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that the solicitorâ€™s conduct during his closing argument rose to the level of a constitutional violation or otherwise requires reversal.\r\nThe relevant jurisprudence instructs that â€œthe Constitution requires the jury to make an individualized determination as to whether the defendant should be executed based on the â€˜character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.â€™â€Â  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 818 (1991) (quoting Booth v. Maryland, 482 U.S. 496, 502 (1987), and Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 879 (1983)).Â  Accordingly, it is well established that evidence which is probative of the defendantâ€™s character is admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  See State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 124, 326 S.E.2d 132, 143 (1985)[9] (quoting Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S. 280 (1976), and citing Barefoot v. Estell, 463 U.S. 880 (1983)).Â  In my view, this practice derives from the command that the decision to impose the death penalty be based on who the defendant is and what he has done.Â  In my opinion, the majority incorrectly posits that the evidence regarding the victimâ€™s prior leg injury was irrelevant and mistakenly concludes that this evidence, if admitted improperly, prejudiced Appellant.Â Â Â  \r\n \r\nOf course, the evidence of the victimâ€™s prior leg injury was clearly relevant to Appellantâ€™s character.Â  The State did not offer the injury as evidence that Appellant was guilty of child abuse, but instead, offered the injury as evidence that Appellantâ€™s actions with his child, prior to his brutally murdering her, were occasionally reckless and callous.Â  The majorityâ€™s bald assertion that this evidence is â€œarguably irrelevantâ€ is unavailing.Â  \r\n \r\nFurthermore, assuming, as the majority seems to, that Rule 403, SCRE, required the trial court to exclude this evidence as substantially more prejudicial than probative, I fail to see how this error prejudiced Appellant.[10]Â  Although Appellant may be correct in that the circumstances of this possibly accidental injury could have been viewed differently by the jury through the â€œdistorted lens of hindsight,â€ the trial court gave extensive instructions to the jury regarding this particular evidence, regarding evidence of character generally, and regarding the factors the jury was required to consider in deciding on the appropriate penalty in this case.Â  As this Court has noted, it is the duty of the jury to take the law from the court in the case on trial and â€œ[i]t must be presumed that they do so.â€Â  State v. Queen, 264 S.C. 515, 521, 216 S.E.2d 182, 185 (1975).Â  \r\n \r\nThe majorityâ€™s finding of prejudice in this case is all the more remarkable given the brutal events which were the subject of this sentencing proceeding.[11]Â  The solicitor referred to the victimâ€™s prior injury only once in his closing argument, remarking that it demonstrated that Appellant was not handling the victim â€œcarefullyâ€ and â€œlovinglyâ€ two months prior to the victimâ€™s death.Â  As a notable jurist once stated, â€œ[s]urely this brief statement did not inflame [the juryâ€™s] passions more than did the facts of the crime.â€Â  Payne, 501 U.S. at 831.Â  Furthermore, in the final testimony offered to the jury before the courtâ€™s charges, Appellant himself requested that the jury sentence him to death for the murder of his daughter.Â  In my view, Appellant has not demonstrated how any error the trial court committed in the admission of evidence prejudiced his case, and under these facts, I believe such a showing would indeed be a tall order.\r\nThe majority also concludes that three aspects of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument require reversal in this case â€œbecause the [death] sentence was imposed under the influence of passion and prejudice in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C).â€Â  I disagree.\r\nAs a primary matter, Appellant did not contemporaneously object to the solicitorâ€™s use of the black cloth and crib during closing argument.Â  Thus, Appellant did not preserve any argument for our review as it relates to this conduct.Â  See Varnadore v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 289 S.C. 155, 159, 345 S.E.2d 711, 714 (1986) (stating that â€œthe proper course to be pursued when counsel makes an improper argument is for opposing counsel to immediately object . . . .â€).\r\nAs I explained in my dissenting opinion in State v. Burkhart, Op. No. 26243 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 8, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 36), I believe this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence which suggests that Â§ 16-3-25(C) imposes a separate standard by which this Court should judge the conduct of capital sentencing proceedings is misguided and mistaken.Â  The soundness of my position as it would apply here is underscored by the fact that, when registering objections during the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, Appellant did not argue that the argument was improper under South Carolinaâ€™s statutory law.Â  Instead, Appellant argued that the solicitorâ€™s arguments â€œwere inflammatoryâ€ and â€œviolat[ed] the Eighth Amendment.â€Â  Perplexingly, the majorityâ€™s analysis begins by discussing the well-established constitutional guideposts that characterize capital jurisprudence, only to end with the naked conclusions that the argument was â€œoverzealousâ€ and in violation of a provision of the South Carolina Code.\r\nThe Eighth Amendment is violated when the decision to impose the death penalty is made in an arbitrary manner, or â€œout of a whim, passion, prejudice, or mistake.â€Â  Caldwell v. Mississippi, 472 U.S. 320, 329-30 (1985); State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 587, 300 S.E.2d 63, 72 (1982).Â  Violations of the Fourteenth Amendment occur when something â€œso infects the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€Â  See Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986).Â  A trial court is vested with great discretion in dealing with the propriety of a closing argument to the jury, and, on appeal, a reviewing court must view the alleged impropriety of the closing argument in the context of the entire record.Â  State v. Woomer, 277 S.C. 170, 174-75, 284 S.E.2d 357, 359 (1981) (citing State v. Durden, 264 S.C. 86, 212 S.E.2d 587 (1975), and State v. Lindler, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981)).\r\nWhen viewed in the context of the entire record, I do not believe that the solicitorâ€™s comments so infected Appellantâ€™s sentencing proceeding with unfairness as to result in a denial of due process.Â  Regardless of whether the majority is correct in its assertion that the sole purpose of the solicitorâ€™s â€œopen seasonâ€ comment was to inflame the jury, the relevant inquiry is whether the argument, taken as a whole, resulted in a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\nLikewise, I disagree with the assertion that the solicitorâ€™s remark in which he expressed that he expected the death penalty requires reversal.Â  The solicitorâ€™s closing argument fills thirty-five pages of the record.Â  I seriously doubt that either of these two comments, each filling only one line on separate pages of the record, permeated the sentencing proceeding with any degree of unfairness.\r\nThe majority cites two cases as examples of jurisprudence from this Court â€œrebuk[ing]â€ such an imposition of the solicitorâ€™s personal belief into a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  As I stated in my Burkhart dissent, these cases are but examples of a line of this Courtâ€™s precedent which is based upon what I believe is a skewed reading of Â§ 16-3-25(C).Â  Of course, the introduction of overly inflammatory evidence as well as arguments which impermissibly appeal to the passions or prejudices of a jury have the potential to violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments.Â  Interestingly, the relevant federal precedent rejects a steadfast rule of reversal whenever â€œpersonal opinionâ€ is injected into a closing argument in a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  See Darden, 477 U.S. at 178 n.8, 181-82 (affirming, on habeas corpus review, a death sentence over the claim that the prosecutorâ€™s remark that he believed the state had carried its burden to support such a penalty violated the Fourteenth Amendment).Â  At least from a constitutional perspective, we have nonchalantly adopted a rule that the United States Supreme Court has rejected.\r\nAffirming a conviction which follows an argument containing improper components is an unpleasant task.Â  Appellantâ€™s sentencing proceeding was not perfect, but few are.Â  On the record presented for our review, however, I cannot conclude that Appellantâ€™s sentencing proceeding was fundamentally unfair.Â  Our jurisprudence unwaveringly provides that we are to presume that juries follow their instructions and that proper instruction of the jury by the court cures most errors.Â  See State v. Ard , 332 S.C. 370, 386, 505 S.E.2d 328, 336 (1998) (citing State v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d 707 (1986)).[12]Â  Instead of following this jurisprudence in the capital arena, I believe we have ignored it.Â  We ought to be more dutiful and genuine in our analysis.Â  The jury was instructed that it was the sole finder of facts in the proceeding; that it was to give Appellant every benefit of every reasonable doubt; that the burden of proof rested entirely upon the State; and that the jury was to make its decision dutifully, fairly, impartially, without passion, without prejudice, and without excessive emotion.Â  I would presume that the jury followed these instructions, and I would find that the juryâ€™s verdict calling for the death penalty was not imposed in violation of the Eighth Amendment.Â  \r\n \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I would hold that even if the trial court erred in admitting evidence relating to the victimâ€™s prior injury, Appellant has not shown prejudice to warrant reversal of his sentence.Â  Also, I would hold that the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was not so improper as to violate the Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse appellantâ€™s capital sentence but write separately because I would decide certain issues differently.Â  \r\n \r\nSpecifically, I view the admission of Ms. Northcuttâ€™s letter to Dr. Andrews as error, and would find the solicitorâ€™s closing argument improper in at least one aspect deemed acceptable by the majority.Â  As to the letter, I find Ms. Northcuttâ€™s reason for declining to speak with Dr. Andrews simply irrelevant. See e.g., State v. Burkhart, Op. No. 26243 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 8, 2007) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 1 at 36), (evidence in the sentencing phase must be relevant to the defendantâ€™s character or the circumstances of the crime).Â  As to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, in my view it was improper for him to argue the jury would be responsible for any future criminal acts of appellant if a life sentence were returned.Â  This argument, which projects personal responsibility upon jurors and plays to their fear, â€œinjects an arbitrary factorâ€ into the sentencing decision.Â  State v. Shuler, 353 S.C. 176, 577 S.E.2d 438 (2003).Â  I cannot agree with the majority that it was a â€œpermissible argument . . . based on the record and reasonable inferences from it.â€Â  Technically, perhaps, the crying, the â€œkick the baby some more,â€ and the dehumanizing of appellant arguments are within allowable parameters, but it is beyond dispute that the closing argument here repeatedly transgressed firmly established boundaries and precedents. It does not serve justice for a prosecutor to engage in such histrionic gamesmanship, especially where a jury is being asked to make a life or death decision.Â Â  \r\n \r\nWith these qualifications, I concur in the majorityâ€™s decision to reverse appellantâ€™s capital sentence and remand the matter for a new proceeding.\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(1)(h) and (10) (2003).\r\n[2]Â  Compare State v. Mitchell, 362 S.C. 289, 296, 608 S.E.2d 140, 144&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2005) (â€œThe crime of homicide by child abuse only applies in cases where the decedent is under the age of eleven whereas the application of involuntary manslaughter is not affected by the age of the decedent.â€); State v. Elliott, 475 S.E.2d 202, 218 - 219&nbsp;(N.C. 1996) (â€œ[F]irst-degree murder and felony child abuse each â€˜requires proof of a fact which the other does not.â€™â€) (citation omitted); State v. Molina, 713 N.W.2d 412, 432&nbsp;(Neb. 2006) (â€œIt is clear â€¦ that child abuse resulting in death requires proof of an element that second degree murder does not: that the death was that of a minor child.â€).Â  \r\n \r\n[3] Â Appellant was at DJJ because he had been found delinquent on a charge of bringing a firearm to school. \r\n \r\n[4]Â  The pathologist who performed the babyâ€™s autopsy noted a healing fracture of the femur.Â  He stated such an injury is â€œone of the signals to the emergency room and to pediatricians to investigate the possibility of child abuse.â€Â  He presumed an investigation had occurred here and multiple physicians had considered and ruled out child abuse as the cause of the babyâ€™s injury.Â  \r\n \r\n[5]Â  Appellant fails to cite any exception to the hearsay rule which would allow the introduction of the entire letter. Appellantâ€™s reliance on Rule 803(3), SCRE, is misplaced because the letter does not qualify as Appellantâ€™s then existing state of mind.Â  \r\n \r\nÂ Also, Appellantâ€™s reliance on State v. Cabrera-Pena, 361 S.C. 372, 605 S.E.2d 522 (2004), is misplaced.Â  In Cabrera-Pena, the Court applied the â€œrule of completenessâ€ to allow the defendant to develop the full substance of a conversation when the prosecution witness testified to only portions of the conversation.Â  The instant case lacks the contemporaneous quality of the conversation in Cabrera-Pena.Â  \r\n \r\n[6]Â  The first four alleged mistakes are permissible arguments because they were based on the record and reasonable inferences from it.Â  See State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 468 S.E.2d 620 (1996) (â€œA solicitorâ€™s closing argument â€¦ should stay within the record and reasonable inferences to it.â€).\r\n[7]Â  See State v. Smart, 278 S.C. 515, 299 S.E.2d 686 (1982) (reversing a death sentence because of the same error by the same solicitor), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991); Thompson v. Aiken, 281 S.C. 239, 315 S.E.2d 110&nbsp;(1984) (finding prejudicial error where prosecutorâ€™s argument put his personal opinion before the jury regarding the death penalty in murder cases and requiring a new sentencing proceeding).\r\n[8]Â  After the solicitorâ€™s closing argument, Appellant told the jury: â€œI killed a defenseless, helpless, four-month-old baby, my daughter.Â  All I ask is do the right thing and bring back the right sentence.Â  Under the law, that would be the death sentence.â€Â  \r\n \r\n[9] Overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 70 n.13, 406 S.E.2d 315, 329 n.5 (1991).\r\n[10] I note that such an assumption is odd given that we have said that an abuse of discretion occurs only when the trial courtâ€™s decision is controlled by an error of law or where its order is based on factual conclusions that are without evidentiary support.Â  Renney v.

Regan, both of Regan and Cantwell, LLC, of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:Â  Clear Channel Outdoor (Petitioner) filed an application with the Zoning Administrator for the City of Myrtle Beach (the City) to replace its billboard.Â  The application was denied.Â  The Cityâ€™s Zoning Board of Appeals (the Board) upheld the Zoning Administratorâ€™s denial of the application.Â  The circuit court initially upheld the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  The circuit court later vacated its first order and reversed the Boardâ€™s decision.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed.Â  We granted Petitionerâ€™s writ of certiorari to review Clear Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 360 S.C. 459, 602 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 2004), and we affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 6, 2001, a tornado destroyed a billboard owned and operated by Petitioner.Â  Petitioner applied for a permit to replace the billboard and the Zoning Administrator for the City denied the permit based on Section 902.9.1 of the cityâ€™s zoning ordinances.Â  Section 902.9 was adopted in February 1998.Â  It prohibits the construction of new billboards.Â  \r\n \r\nPetitioner appealed to the Board, maintaining its billboard did not qualify as a new billboard, but as a replacement of an existing, conforming sign.Â  Petitioner argued the replacement of the billboard would not violate Section 902.9.1â€™s prohibition of new signs.Â  Petitioner emphasized the billboard was conforming prior to its destruction according to the Cityâ€™s own inventory of billboards.Â  Petitioner argued the permit should not be denied because it did not receive notice pursuant to Section 902.4.6 that its sign was in disrepair. Â Petitioner also argued that under Section 902.4.6.e, it had the right to restore, reconstruct, alter or repair the billboard as long as the reconstructed billboard conformed with all provisions of the current zoning ordinances.Â  \r\n \r\nThe City argued the billboard was nonconforming prior to its destruction.Â  This nonconformance was not discovered until the City inspected the site of the billboard after it was removed[1].Â  Upon inspection, the City determined the billboard was actually two billboards inches apart in violation of Section 902.7.2.c.2 which prohibits the placement of billboards within 750 feet of one another.Â  Section 902.8.3.d[2], therefore, applied to prevent the reconstruction of the billboard.Â  \r\n \r\nThe City claimed it relied on Section 902.7.2.c.2 merely as a reply to Petitioner and the only section applicable to the controversy was Section 902.9.1.Â  The City regarded Petitionerâ€™s application as one for a new billboard and not one to repair an existing billboard because there was nothing left to repair after Petitioner completely removed the destroyed billboard.Â  The Zoning Administrator stated: \r\n \r\n\r\n  I canâ€™t approve a permit to erect a billboard in the city â€¦.Â  I could only issue a permit as long as [the proposed billboard] complied with all the other provisions of the ordinance and thereâ€™s no way it could comply with 902.9.1 because that says there are no more billboards in the city.Â  \r\n\t \r\n\r\nThe Zoning Administrator also claimed Section 902.9.1 rendered all existing billboards nonconforming.Â  She noted, however, Petitionerâ€™s billboard had not been placed on an amortization schedule as had other nonconforming billboards.Â  \r\n \r\nThe Board affirmed the Zoning Administrator and based the denial of the permit on Sections 902.9, 902.4.6, and 902.8.3.Â  Petitioner appealed to the circuit court, arguing the Board erred by considering ordinances other than Section 902.9.1 when Section 902.9.1 was the Zoning Administratorâ€™s only basis for denying the permit. Â The circuit court affirmed but subsequently vacated its order, agreeing with Petitioner that â€œSection 902.9.1 was the sole basis for the Zoning Administratorâ€™s denial of a permit, and no other issue was properly before the Boardâ€¦.â€Â  \r\n \r\nRespondent appealed and the Court of Appeals reversed.Â  Clear Channel Outdoor v. City of Myrtle Beach, 360 S.C. 459, 602 S.E.2d 76 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  The Court of Appeals held the circuit court erred in limiting the Boardâ€™s review to Section 902.9.1 and noted â€œfew restrictions encumber the scope of the Boardâ€™s authority.â€Â  Id. at 465, 602 S.E.2d at 79.Â  The Court of Appeals cited S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800(E) (Supp. 2005) which confers upon the Board â€œall the powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.â€Â  Id.Â  The Court of Appeals also held Petitioner did not have a vested right to reconstruct a billboard.Â  Id. at 467, 602 S.E.2d at 80.Â  \r\n \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision violate Petitionerâ€™s procedural due process rights and is the City estopped from alleging Petitionerâ€™s sign was nonconforming when Petitioner allegedly had no notice of the nonconformity issue?Â  \r\n\t \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nUnder S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-840(A) (Supp. 2005), â€œ[t]he findings of fact by the board of appeals must be treated in the same manner as a finding of fact by a jury, and the court may not take additional evidence.â€Â  In reviewing questions presented on appeal, the court must determine only whether the decision of the board is correct as a matter of law.Â  Id.Â  A court will refrain from substituting its judgment for that of the reviewing body, even if it disagrees with the decision.Â  Rest. Row Assocs. v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 216, 516 S.E.2d 442, 446&nbsp;(1999).Â  However, a decision of a city zoning board will be overturned if it is arbitrary, capricious, has no reasonable relation to a lawful purpose, or if the board has abused its discretion.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision violates its procedural due process rights because Petitioner allegedly had no notice of the issues decided by the City.Â  Petitionerâ€™s argument fails because it had actual notice of the nonconformity issue and, therefore, the City is not estopped from alleging Petitionerâ€™s sign was nonconforming.\r\nDue process requires (1) adequate notice; (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce evidence; and (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.Â  In re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 595, 582 S.E.2d 413, 416&nbsp;(2003).Â  Petitioner argued its due process rights were violated because it neither received notice of the nonconformity issue nor had a meaningful opportunity to be heard.Â  We disagree. \r\n \r\nFirst, the record contains a memorandum from Petitioner to the Zoning Administrator written prior to the hearing before the Board in which Petitioner expresses its understanding that its billboard was nonconforming under Section 902.9.1.Â  An affidavit from Petitionerâ€™s real estate manager confirms it knew of the nonconformity issue prior to the hearing before the Board.Â  Second, Petitioner affirmatively argued before the Board that its billboard was conforming.Â  The Record shows Petitioner had both notice of the nonconformity issue and an opportunity to be heard.Â  Petitionerâ€™s due process rights, therefore, were not violated.Â  \r\n \r\nPetitionerâ€™s estoppel argument also fails.Â  Petitioner argues the City is estopped from finding Petitionerâ€™s sign is nonconforming because the City inspected the sign and determined it was conforming, and because the City failed to notify Petitioner of any nonconformity.Â  According to Petitioner, the City inspected all signs within the City limits and kept an inventory showing Petitionerâ€™s sign was conforming.Â  The inventory led Petitioner to believe its sign was conforming and deprived Petitioner of the opportunity to cure any defect before the sign was destroyed.Â  The City, on the other hand, maintains the inventory was merely an unofficial, staff-maintained record that predated Section 902.9.1.Â  \r\n \r\nTo claim equitable estoppel, a party must show: â€œ(1) a lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) prejudicial change in the position of the party claiming estoppel.â€Â  Evins v. Richland County Historic Pres. Commâ€™n, 341 S.C. 15, 532 S.E.2d 876 (2000).Â  Petitioner is charged with knowledge of the law.Â  See Labruce v. City of North Charleston, 268 S.C. 465, 234 S.E.2d 866 (1977). Petitioner was in the business of outdoor advertising and had ample means of knowing its sign violated the Cityâ€™s ordinance.Â  Section 902.9.1 has been in effect since 1998.Â  An unofficial inventory list does not excuse Petitioner from knowledge of ordinances which have a direct bearing on its business.Â  Petitioner knew or had means to know its sign was nonconforming under Section 902.9.1.Â  Therefore, Petitionerâ€™s reliance on the doctrine of estoppel is misplaced. \r\n \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  We also affirm Petitionerâ€™s remaining issues pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, and the following authorities: Issues 1 and 2: S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-800(A), (E) (Supp. 2005); Â Hitachi Data Sys. Corp. v. Leatherman,&nbsp; 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846&nbsp;(1992) (â€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is that words used therein must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand its operation.â€); Issues 4 and 5: Gurganious v. City of Beaufort, 317 S.C. 481, 490, 454 S.E.2d 912, 918 (Ct. App. 1995) (â€œWhile a property owner has a constitutionally protected right to continue the use following enactment of a zoning ordinance, provisions terminating the nonconforming use upon destruction of a specified portion of the premises â€¦ are proper, so long as the maximum amount of destruction permitted and the time allowed is reasonable.â€); and Issues 7 and 8: Purdy v. Moise, 223 S.C. 298, 302, 75 S.E.2d 605, 607 (1953) (â€œ[A local zoning boardâ€™s] construction of its own ordinance, the enforcement of which it is charged with, should be given some consideration and not overruled without cogent reason therefore.â€); Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 538, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987) (â€œThe circuit court should not disturb the findings of the board unless the board has acted arbitrarily or in an obvious abuse of discretion, or unless the board has acted illegally or in excess of its lawfully delegated authority.â€).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr. and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â An employee for Petitioner removed the billboard out of concern for the dangerous condition resulting when the billboard was destroyed by a tornado.Â  \r\n \r\n[2] Â Section 902.8.3 states, in pertinent part, â€œ[t]he right to maintain any nonconforming sign shall terminate and shall cease to exist whenever the sign structure is destroyed, or is damaged as described in subsection 902.4.6.eâ€¦.â€Â  Section 902.4.6.e states that a sign is damaged when the structural support has failed either by fracture or by exceeding its yield point. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Wise v.

On October 27, 2006, the Court of Appeals received a petition to reinstate from appellant; however, he failed to provide proof of service. The remittitur was sent to the lower court by order dated October 30, 2006.\r\n On December 28, 2006, appellant filed a motion for enlargement of time in this Court. By order dated January 4, 2007, the motion was denied because the sending of the remittitur ended appellate jurisdiction over the matter.\r\n Appellant has now filed a &ldquo;59(e) Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgement [sic],&rdquo; an affidavit and memorandum of law in support of appellant&rsquo;s &ldquo;Notice of Right to Appeal,&rdquo; and a document that we have construed as a petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\n Whenever it appears that an appellant has failed to comply with the requirements of the SCACR, an order of dismissal shall be issued. Rule 231(a), SCACR. The Clerk of Court shall remit the case to the lower court in accordance with Rule 221, SCACR, unless a motion to reinstate the appeal has been actually received by the court within fifteen days of filing of the order of dismissal. Id.\r\n When the remittitur has been properly sent, the appellate court no longer has jurisdiction over the matter and no motion can be heard thereafter. Mickle v. Blackmon, 255 S.C. 136, 177 S.E.2d 548 (1970); Thomas v. Lynch, 87 S.C. 44, 68 S.E. 817 (1910); Carpenter v. Lewis, 65 S.C. 400, 43 S.E. 881 (1903); State v. Keels, 39 S.C. 553, 17 S.E. 802 (1893). The only exception to this rule is when the remittitur is sent down by mistake, error or inadvertence of the Court. Keels, supra. \r\n The remittitur in this case was not sent down by mistake, error or inadvertence of the Court of Appeals. Instead, it was correctly sent after fifteen days had elapsed from the date of the order dismissing the appeal without the proper filing of a petition for reinstatement. See Rule 224, SCACR (certificate of service shall be filed with all motions and petitions). Accordingly, this Court does not have jurisdiction to act in this matter. The documents filed by appellant are hereby dismissed.\r\n IT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    s/Jean H.

Rubillo, of Georgetown, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: The Court granted petitionersâ€™ request for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in B &amp; A Dev., Inc. v. Georgetown County, 361 S.C. 453, 605 S.E.2d 551 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm as modified. \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioners are a group of individual and corporate taxpayers who filed suit in circuit court alleging that Georgetown County had unlawfully imposed excessive taxes on their real and personal property. Â Petitioners sought relief in the form of a refund or tax credit.Â  Regarding the underlying facts alleged by petitioners, the Court of Appeals appropriately summarized as follows:\r\n\r\nIn Georgetown County, the amount of the annual property tax assessment depends to a large degree on the amount of money the School District determines it needs for operations in the coming [] year. Â The process is straightforward: After the School District prepares its budget, the County auditor sets the tax rate, expressed in mills, to provide the necessary revenue to fund School District operations.\r\n[Petitioners] contend the County has levied upon property owners a higher millage rate than was needed to supply the revenue requested by the School District. Â [Petitioners] allege this excess tax has created an illegal surplus each year from approximately 1991 until the time this lawsuit was filed in 2001. They claim the cumulative amount of the surplus collections exceeds $28 million.\r\n\r\nB &amp; A Dev., 361 S.C. at 456, 605 S.E.2d at 552.\r\nEssentially, therefore, petitioners alleged a case of excessive millage; in addition, they captioned the case as a class action.Â  The circuit court dismissed the action, without prejudice, because petitioners had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies under the South Carolina Revenue Procedures Act (the RPA).[1]Â  On appeal, the Court of Appeals found that the RPA applied to petitionersâ€™ claims and therefore affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal.Â Â  B &amp; A Dev., supra.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n1. Did the Court of Appeals err by affirming the circuit courtâ€™s decision that petitioners are required to exhaust their administrative remedies under the RPA?Â  \r\n2. Have the rights of the class action plaintiffs been compromised by the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion?Â  Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Applicability of the RPA\r\nPetitioners raise the following arguments as to why the Court of Appeals erred in finding the RPA applies to the instant case:Â  (1) their dispute is with the Georgetown County School District, not the Department of Revenue; (2) S.C. Code Ann. section 12-43-285, specifically dealing with excessive millage rates, entitles a taxpayer to bring an action directly in circuit court; and (3) excessive millage claims were not thought to be properly brought under the RPA until the Courtâ€™s decision in Brackenbrook N. Charleston, LP v. County of Charleston, 360 S.C. 390, 602 S.E.2d 39 (2004).Â  In addition, petitioners claim that the RPA does not provide taxpayers with a clear and certain remedy, and therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in finding that their claim did not challenge the constitutionality of the RPA.Â  Finally, petitioners assert that the law was unclear before Brackenbrook and that the decision should only be applied prospectively.Â  In our opinion, however, the lower courts correctly decided that the RPA applies.\r\nThe RPA was enacted in 1995; the express intent of the Act states as follows:Â  â€œIt is the intent of the General Assembly to provide the people of this State with a straightforward procedure to determine any dispute with the Department of Revenue. Â The [RPA] must be interpreted and construed in accordance with, and in furtherance of, that intent.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-20 (Supp. 2006).Â  Furthermore, the RPA clearly states â€œthere is no remedy other than those provided in this chapter in any case involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes, or attempt to collect taxes.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-80(A) (Supp. 2006) (emphasis added).Â  Indeed, the RPA specifies that if a taxpayer brings an action under the Act in circuit court, â€œthe circuit court shall dismiss the case without prejudice.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-3390 (Supp. 2006). Â The only exception to the exclusivity of administrative remedy is that an action for a declaratory judgment may be brought in circuit court â€œwhere the sole issue is whether a statute is constitutional;â€ this exception, however, does not apply to a claim that the statute is unconstitutional â€œas applied.â€ Â Id. Â§ 12-60-80(B); see also Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 538 S.E.2d 245 (2000) (because an administrative law judge cannot rule on the constitutionality of a statute, a declaratory judgment action seeking to determine whether a statute is constitutional should not be dismissed by the circuit court).\r\nIn Brackenbrook, which also involved a claim of excessive millage, this Court stated that although the RPA contains many procedures for taxpayers challenging their property tax assessments, â€œrelief under the Act is not limited to these types of protests.â€ Â Brackenbrook, 360 S.C. at 398, 602 S.E.2d at 44.Â  Specifically, the Brackenbrook Court noted that the RPA allows a taxpayer to seek a refund of paid taxes under section 12-60-2560;[2] therefore, the Court held that the taxpayersâ€™ remedy was not a â€œdirect circuit court refund suit, but rather an administrative refundâ€ pursuant to section 12-60-2560.Â  Id. at 398-99, 602 S.E.2d at 44.\r\nThis case is not distinguishable from Brackenbrook, and thus, the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of the action pursuant to section 12-60-3390.Â  Petitioners allege that Georgetown County collected both real and personal property taxes based upon an excessive millage rate thereby resulting in an overcollection of taxes allocated to the school district.Â  The RPA provides an administrative remedy in the form of a refund for both real and personal property taxes.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-60-2560, 12-60-2940[3] (2000).Â  Thus, pursuant to both Brackenbrook and the plain language of the RPA, see Â§Â§ 12-60-20 &amp; 12-60-80, petitioners must exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding to circuit court.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals properly affirmed the dismissal.\r\nWe now turn to petitionersâ€™ specific arguments and address them briefly.Â  First, petitioners attempt to distinguish their county-based tax suit from the RPAâ€™s language regarding â€œany dispute with the Department of Revenue.â€ Â Â§ 12-60-20.Â  With respect to this contention, the Court of Appeals stated the following:Â  \r\n\r\nIn 1995, the Legislature adopted the RPA with the express legislative intent â€œto provide the people of this State with a straightforward procedure to determine any disputed revenue liability.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-20 (2000) (emphasis added). In 2000, the Legislature substituted the phrase â€œdispute with the Department of Revenueâ€ for â€œany disputed revenue liabilityâ€ in Â§ 12-60-20. Â See Â§ 12-60-20 (Supp. 2003). Â Our supreme court has noted that this alteration did not affect the applicability of the RPA to county tax protest procedures: \r\n  \r\nAlthough this amendment could be read as indicative of an intent to limit the Act to tax issues involving the DOR, when amending Â§ 12-60-20 the legislature did not amend or repeal those parts of the Act which deal solely with county tax disputes. In light of this, we hold that a court must look first to the Act when faced with a question of county tax protest procedures. \r\n  \r\n\r\nB &amp; A Dev., 361 S.C. at 457 n.1, 605 S.E.2d at 553 n.1 (quoting Brackenbrook, 360 S.C. at 395, 602 S.E.2d at 42).Â  Looking at the RPA, we find the Act clearly envisions protests to county assessments.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-60-30, 12-60-2560, 12-60-2940 (including definitions and references to county auditor, county assessor, and county board of assessment appeals).Â  In addition, as noted by the Court of Appeals, the Brackenbrook decision itself provides clear support that a county-based excessive millage claim may not be initiated in circuit court.\r\nSecond, petitioners argue that because they are basing their lawsuit on S.C. Code Ann. section 12-43-285, the RPA does not apply.Â  This section states in relevant part:\r\n\r\nIf a millage rate is in excess of that authorized by law, the county treasurer shall either issue refunds or transfer the total amount in excess of that authorized by law, upon collection, to a separate, segregated fund, which must be credited to taxpayers in the following year as instructed by the governing body of the political subdivision on whose behalf the millage was levied. An entity submitting a millage rate in excess of that authorized by law shall pay the costs of implementing this subsection or a pro rata share of the costs if more than one entity submits an excessive millage rate.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-43-285(B) (Supp. 2006).Â  While section 12-43-285 clearly would apply to petitionersâ€™ lawsuit if they prevail on the merits, this section goes more to the manner of remedy rather than procedure.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we note that section 12-43-285 was enacted in 2001 and applies to property tax years beginning after December 31, 1999.Â  Therefore, the RPA was already in effect at the time this section became law.Â  It is well settled that the law â€œdoes not favor the implied repeal of statute,â€ and â€œ[s]tatutes dealing with the same subject matter must be reconciled, if possible, so as to render both operative.â€Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 88, 533 S.E.2d 578, 583 (2000) (citing Butler v. Unisun Ins., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996)).\r\nGiven that the exhaustion of administrative remedy requirement of the RPA covers â€œany case involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes,â€ Â§ 12-60-80(A), and section 12-43-285 deals with excessive millage, these two statutes should be reconciled.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, supra. Â Therefore, rather than interpreting section 12-43-285 as displacing the exhaustion requirement of the RPA and replacing that with a right of direct access to the circuit court, we hold the Court of Appeals properly harmonized these two statutes.Â  Put simply, we agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ observation that â€œ[h]ad the Legislature intended to allow for direct action in circuit court - in contravention of the broadly defined scope of the RPA - it could have expressly provided for such immediate judicial review.â€Â  B &amp; A Dev., 361 S.C. at 460, 605 S.E.2d at 554; see also Buist v. Huggins, 367 S.C. 268, 276, 625 S.E.2d 636, 640 (2006) (where a statuteâ€™s language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, the court has no right to impose another meaning).\r\nThird, petitioners claim that Brackenbrook was unforeseeable and therefore should be applied prospectively.Â  Because the language of the RPA is so plain, we disagree.Â  As noted above, the original language of the Act stated that the RPA applied to â€œany disputed revenue liability.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-20 (2000).Â  Moreover, the RPA expressly provides that the administrative remedies under the Act are exclusive for â€œany case involving the illegal or wrongful collection of taxes.â€ Â Â§ 12-60-80(A). Â \r\nAdditionally, prior to the filing of petitionersâ€™ lawsuit, this Court had interpreted the RPA as establishing â€œadministrative procedures for taxpayers who claim a refund of any state tax.â€Â  Evans v. State, 344 S.C. 60, 65, 543 S.E.2d 547, 549 (2001).Â  In Evans, the Court held that because the class of state retirees was mounting an â€œas appliedâ€ constitutional challenge, the exhaustion of administrative remedies requirement applied.Â  While the Evans case dealt with a state tax issue, rather than a county tax claim, the Brackenbrook decision did not establish any new legal principle, but rather interpreted the plain language of the RPA.Â  \r\nThus, given the plain language of the statute as well as the case law in effect when petitioners filed their complaint, we reject petitionersâ€™ contention that the Brackenbrook decision regarding the exhaustion doctrine should be prospective.Â  \r\nFinally, petitioners claim that the RPA does not provide a constitutionally adequate, â€œclear and certainâ€ remedy for their claims.Â  See McKesson Corp. v. Div. of Alcoholic Beverages and Tobacco, 496 U.S. 18 (1990) (where the United States Supreme Court held that due process requires all taxpayers to have a â€œclear and certainâ€ remedy for taxes collected in violation of law).Â  However, we agree with the Court of Appeals that petitioners have not offered any satisfying reason why the RPAâ€™s post-deprivation refund procedures are constitutionally inadequate.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-60-2560, 12-60-2940; see also National Private Truck Council, Inc. v. Oklahoma Tax Commâ€™n, 515 U.S. 582, 587 (1995) (â€œthe States are afforded great flexibility in satisfying the requirements of due process in the field of taxationâ€).\r\nPetitionersâ€™ more specific argument on this point is that the RPA refund sections envision challenges to valuation of property; because this is an excessive millage case, petitioners contend that the RPA does not provide a remedy.Â  As discussed above, however, the Court in Brackenbrook rejected the idea that the RPA covers only valuation issues.Â  Brackenbrook, 360 S.C. at 398, 602 S.E.2d at 44 (although the RPA contains many procedures for taxpayers to challenge their property tax assessments, relief under the RPA â€œis not limited to these types of protestsâ€).\r\nIn sum, we hold the Court of Appeals correctly affirmed the circuit courtâ€™s ruling that petitioners are required to exhaust their administrative remedies before proceeding to circuit court.\r\n2.Â  Class Action Status\r\nPetitioners also argue that the Court of Appeals failed â€œto protect absent class membersâ€ by acknowledging, in a footnote, that the RPA was amended in 2003 to expressly disallow class actions.[4]Â  Petitioners further note the following language in the opinion:Â  â€œStyling[5] the suit a class action on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated, [petitioners] brought this suit against several governing bodies and officers of the County.â€Â  B &amp; A Dev., 361 S.C. at 455, 605 S.E.2d at 552.Â  More specifically, petitioners contend that because they filed their lawsuit as a putative class action prior to section 12-60-80â€™s amendment, the Court of Appeals erred when it â€œintimatedâ€ that the instant case could not proceed as a class action.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals, however, did not actually make the ruling which petitioners raise to this Court.Â  It is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved for appellate review. Â See, e.g., Staubes v. City of Folly Beach, 339 S.C. 406, 529 S.E.2d 543 (2000).Â  In the instant case, the circuit court neither certified a class nor denied class certification.[6]Â  Moreover, class action status was not presented as an issue to the Court of Appeals.Â  Therefore, the issue, on the merits, is unpreserved for our review.Â  Id.\r\nNonetheless, we agree with petitioners that certain language in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion could be construed as commenting on the substance of this issue.Â  Consequently, we vacate that portion of the opinion which arguably suggests petitioners cannot maintain this case as a class action.Â  See State v. Dunbar,&nbsp; 356 S.C. 138, 142, 587 S.E.2d 691, 694&nbsp;(2003) (â€œAn issue that was not\r\npreserved for review should not be addressed by the Court of Appeals, and the courtâ€™s\r\nopinion should be vacated to the extent it addressed an issue that was not preserved.â€).Â  If and when the class certification issue is argued, the parties can present their arguments and a ruling can be rendered based on the legal authority presented.Â  Only then will the issue become preserved for subsequent appellate review and comment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion as modified.\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I adhere to my dissenting opinion in Brackenbrook N. Charleston, LP v.

Â The majority of these three officials shall determine the taxpayerâ€™s refund, if any, and shall notify the taxpayer in writing of their decision.\r\n(B) Within thirty days after the decision is mailed to the taxpayer on the claim for refund, a property taxpayer may appeal the decision to the county board of assessment appeals. â€¦\r\n(C) Within thirty days after the boardâ€™s decision is mailed to the taxpayer, a property taxpayer or county assessor may appeal the decision issued by the board by requesting a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Judge Division.â€¦Â  If a taxpayer requests a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Judge Division without exhausting his prehearing remedyâ€¦, the Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the action without prejudice.\r\n\r\n[3] SectionÂ  12-60-2940, entitled â€œClaim for refund of personal property tax; request for contested case hearing following denial of claim.â€ states the following, in relevant part:\r\n\r\n(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Subject to the limitations in Section 12-60-1750, and within the time limitation of Section 12-54-85(F), a property taxpayer may seek a refund of property taxes assessed by the county auditor and paid, other than taxes paid on property the taxpayer claims is exempt unless the exemption is the homestead exemption, by filing a claim for refund with the county auditor who made the personal property tax assessment on the property for which the tax refund is sought. The auditor upon receipt of a claim for refund shall immediately notify the county treasurer and county assessor. A majority of these three officials shall determine the taxpayer's refund, if any, and shall notify the taxpayer in writing of their decision.\r\n(B)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A taxpayer may appeal the decision by requesting a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Judge Division in accordance with its rules within thirty days of the written denial of the claim for refund.\r\n(C)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If a taxpayer requests a contested case hearing before the Administrative Law Judge Division without exhausting his prehearing remedy because he failed to file a claim for refund, the Administrative Law Judge shall dismiss the action without prejudice.\r\n\r\n[4] B &amp; A Dev., 361 S.C. at 457 n.2, 605 S.E.2d at 553 n.2 (â€œWe also note that recent amendments to Â§ 12-60-80 provide that â€œa claim or action for the refund of taxes may not be brought as a class action in the Administrative Law Judge Division or any court of law in this State....â€ Â§ 12-60-80(C) (Act No. 69, 2003 S.C.

(WTI).Â  Appellants (Inmates) claim they were underpaid for their labor and seek â€œlost wages.â€Â  The trial judge dismissed Inmatesâ€™ complaint with prejudice based on our decision in Adkins v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn Adkins, we considered a suit by inmates against DOC as the sole defendant.Â  The suit alleged a violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-430(D) (Supp. 2005) which provides that â€œno inmate participating in [a prison industries] program may earn less than the prevailing wage for work of similar nature in the private sector.â€Â  We held there is no private cause of action for a violation of this statute.[1]\r\nInmates here alleged a cause of action under the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, S.C. Code Â§ 41-10-20 et seq. (Supp. 2005) claiming lost wages because they were not paid the â€œprevailing wageâ€ as specified in Â§ 24-3-430(D).[2]Â Â  They claim the trial judge should not have dismissed this cause of action against WTI.[3]\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDo inmates have a cause of action under the Payment of Wages Act?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Payment of Wages Act requires that every employer â€œnotify each employee in writing at the time of hiring of the normal hours and wages agreed upon, the time and place of payment, and the deductions which will be made. . . .â€Â  Â§ 41-10-30.Â  Every employer shall pay wages due at the time and place designated by this notice.Â  Â§ 41-10-40(D).Â  There is no provision regarding the payment of a statutorily required wage.\r\nWhether a private industry sponsor and the inmates in a prison industries program have an employer-employee relationship for purposes of the Payment of Wages Act is a novel issue.Â  Inmates ask us to find such a relationship based on the test for employment set out in Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 400 S.E.2d 781 (1991).Â  This test includes four factors:Â  (1) the right to, or exercise of, control; (2) method of payment; (3) furnishing of equipment; and (4) right to fire.Â  Inmates point to provisions in the contract between DOC and WTI that indicate WTIâ€™s right to control inmate workers.Â  For instance, the contract provides that WTI provides worker training and supervisory staff to oversee work product quality, and WTI furnishes the equipment upon which the work is performed.Â  Although DOC screens and selects the inmates who will participate, WTI â€œreserves the right to have [DOC] remove and replace inmate workers based on job performance.â€Â  Inmates contend the contract provisions stating that inmates are not to be considered employees of WTI do not control.\r\nWe find the Felts four-part test is not determinative of employer status in the context of the Payment of Wages Act.Â  This Act, by its very title, is concerned specifically with the payment of wages and is directed to the entity responsible for such payment.Â  See Williams v. Grimes Aerospace Co., 988 F. Supp. 925, n.13 (D.S.C. 1997) (holding that corporation for whom work was performed was not liable under South Carolina Payment of Wages Act where temporary agency â€œhandled all payment of wagesâ€).Â  \r\nHere, the payment of inmate wages is exclusively within the control of DOC and not WTI.Â  The contract provides that WTI will pay DOC a flat rate of $4.00 per hour per inmate and that DOC is responsible to pay inmate workers and handle payroll deductions.Â  Of even greater significance is the fact that the legislature has specifically mandated how inmate wages for prison industry labor are to be handled.Â  Section 24-3-40 (Supp. 2005) provides:\r\n\r\nDisposition of wages of prisoner allowed to work at paid employment.\r\n(A) Unless otherwise provided by law, the employer of a prisoner authorized to work at paid employment . . . in a prison industry program provided under Article 3 of this chapter shall pay the prisonerâ€™s wages directly to the Department of Corrections.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  This section also includes specific deductions from inmate wages that are to be made by the Director of DOC, including restitution to victims, payment to the State Office of Victim Assistance, child support, and state and federal taxes.Â  Clearly, by contract and by statute, DOC is the only entity responsible for the payment of inmate wages.Â  \r\nOther state courts have held for purposes of wage statutes that inmates compensated by the prison are not the employees of prison industry sponsors.Â  See Manville v. Bd. of Governors of Wayne State Univ., 272 N.W.2d 162 (Mich. App. 1978) (rate of compensation for prison labor determined under state Correctional Industries Act, not Minimum Wage Law where Department of Corrections unilaterally set wage scale and work hours); Prieur v. D.C.I. Plasma Center of Nevada, Inc., 726 P.2d 1372 (Nev. 1986) (prison laborer barred from pursuing claim against prison industry sponsor under state wage and hour law where Department of Prisons determined rate and method of compensation).Â  Federal courts have come to the same result under the Federal Labor Standards Act.Â  E.g., Henthorn v. Depâ€™t of Navy, 29 F.3d 682 (D.C. Cir. 1994); Harker v. State Use Indus., 990 F.2d 131 (4th Cir. 1993); Gilbreath v. Cutter Biological, Inc., 931 F.2d 1320 (9th Cir. 1991); George v. SC Data Center, Inc., 884 F.Supp. 329 (W.D. Wis. 1995).Â  \r\nIn conclusion, Inmates cannot maintain an action against WTI under the Payment of Wages Act since WTI is not the entity responsible for paying their wages. Â We affirm Inmatesâ€™ remaining issues under Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.Â  See Adkins, supra (prevailing wage statute was not enacted for the special benefit of inmates but was intended to prevent unfair competition and aid the public in general).Â  \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  As I explained in my concurring opinion in Adkins v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2004), I would hold that the inmatesâ€™ remedy is found in the South Carolina Payment of Wages Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 41-10-10, et seq. (Supp. 2005).Â  \r\nTo hold that the payment of wages is exclusively within the control of the DOC ignores the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-3-40 (Supp. 2005).Â  That statute provides â€œthe employer of a prisoner authorized to workâ€¦.in a prison industry programâ€¦.shall pay the prisonerâ€™s wages directly to the Department of Correctionsâ€ and then requires the DOC to distribute those wages to inmates on behalf of the employer.Â  Thus, the ultimate responsibility for paying wages falls on the prison industry sponsor, while the DOC merely acts as a conduit for payment to the inmates.\r\nUnder the Payment of Wages Act, â€œEmployerâ€ is defined as â€œevery person, firm, partnership, association, corporation, receiver, or other officer of a court of this State, the State or any political subdivision thereof, and any agent or officer of the above classes employing any person in this State.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 41-10-10(1).Â  In my opinion, this definition includes both the employer, WTI, and its agent, the DOC.Â  Accordingly, I would hold that both WTI and the DOC are subject to the inmatesâ€™ claims made pursuant to the Payment of Wages Act. \r\n\r\n[1]In the companion case of Wicker v.

Holloway, of Harvey &amp; Battey, of Beaufort, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This case arises out of a condemnation action by the South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) and was certified for review from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  First Carolina Corporation of South Carolina (First Carolina) initiated a suit to determine the value of a piece of condemned property.Â  The trial court submitted the case to the jury with instructions for the jury to utilize a special verdict form provided by the court.Â  The jury returned a verdict in favor of First Carolina and awarded compensation for the land taken and special damages to the remaining property.Â  SCDOT appealed.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nSCDOT condemned approximately eight (8) acres of land belonging to First Carolina.Â  The condemned property was part of a larger, four hundred (400) acre tract of land.Â  First Carolina initiated an action to determine the amount of compensation owed by SCDOT for the condemnation of First Carolinaâ€™s property.Â  \r\nDuring trial, First Carolina argued that it should be compensated based on the value of land taken plus any special damages to the remaining property.Â  SCDOT argued that First Carolinaâ€™s method inflated the value of the condemned property.Â  Instead, SCDOT advocated for the use of the â€œbefore and afterâ€ appraisal methodology.Â  \r\nFirst Carolina submitted a special verdict form to the court.Â  After the trial court announced its intention to utilize a modified version of the special verdict form, SCDOT indicated that it would prefer a general verdict form.Â  The trial court denied SCDOTâ€™s request to use a general verdict form.Â  \r\nThe modified special verdict form utilized by the court asked the jury to 1) unanimously determine just compensation for the land taken, 2) unanimously determine whether the taking caused any special damage to the remaining property, and 3) determine the amount of the special damages, if any. \r\nFollowing the charge to the jury, but before the court delivered the trial exhibits and special verdict form to the jury, SCDOT again objected to the use of the special verdict form on the basis that it â€œemphasizes damages by its bifurcated nature and the Department [didnâ€™t] believe that the landowner ha[d] proven its damages to the standards required by the law.â€Â  The trial court overruled SCDOTâ€™s objection and submitted the form to the jury on the basis that the form would simplify an appellate review of the verdict.Â  The jury returned a verdict of $1,990,975.00, of which $640,300.00 was for the land acquired and $1,350,675.00 for the damage to the remaining property.Â  \r\nSCDOT filed several post-trial motions, including a request for a judgment notwithstanding the verdict based upon the argument that the verdict form was unduly suggestive of the appraisal method advocated by First Carolina.Â  The trial court denied the motion and this appeal followed.Â  \r\nSCDOT appeals raising the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in utilizing a special verdict form because the nature of the case, the facts, or the evidence did not warrant a special verdict?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.&nbsp;\r\n       Was the special verdict form submitted by the trial court unduly suggestive or misleading as to the appraisal method to be used by the jury in calculating just compensation?[1] \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe determination of whether a special verdict should be submitted to the jury is within the sound discretion of the trial judge, and an appellate court will only reverse upon a finding of an abuse of that discretion. Smoak v. Liebherr-America, Inc., 281 S.C. 420, 421, 315 S.E.2d 116, 118 (1984).Â Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support. Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Use of Special Verdict Form\r\nSCDOT argues that the trial court erred in utilizing a special verdict form because the nature of the case, the facts, and the evidence did not warrant a special verdict.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe trial judge has the discretion to determine how a case is submitted to the jury.Â  Smoak, 281 S.C. at 421, 315 S.E.2d at 118.Â Â  Rule 49(a), SCRCP, provides in part:\r\n\r\nThe court may require a jury to return only a special verdict in the form of a special written finding upon each issue of fact. In that event the court may submit to the jury written questions susceptible of categorical or other brief answer or may submit written forms of the several special findings which might properly be made under the pleadings and evidence; or it may use such other method of submitting the issues and requiring the written findings thereon as it deems most appropriate.\r\n\r\nSCDOT does not dispute the discretionary nature of this decision in its brief.Â  Furthermore, SCDOT does not argue that the trial court abused its discretion by submitting the special verdict form to the jury.Â  The only arguments SCDOT propounds are that the verdict form is misleading and that the use of a general verdict form would have simplified the appeals process.Â  \r\nWe find that the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in utilizing a special verdict form.Â  Rule 49, SCRCP, clearly allows the court to use special verdicts in its discretion.Â  Even if a general verdict was more practical given the circumstances of this case, this fact alone does not amount to an abuse of discretion.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not err in utilizing a special verdict form in this case.\r\nII.&nbsp; Prejudicial Effect of the Special Verdict Form \r\nSCDOT argues that the special verdict form submitted by the trial court was unduly suggestive or misleading as to the appraisal method to be used by the jury in calculating just compensation.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt the outset we must address the trial courtâ€™s ruling that SCDOT waived its objection to the special verdict form.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is well settled that an issue may not be raised for the first time in a post-trial motion.Â  McGee v. Bruce Hosp. Syst., 321 S.C. 340, 347, 468 S.E.2d 633, 637 (1996).Â Â  Further, it is a litigantâ€™s duty to bring to the courtâ€™s attention any perceived error, and the failure to do so amounts to a waiver of the alleged error.Â  Parks v. Morris Homes Corp., 245 S.C. 461, 471, 141 S.E.2d 129, 134 (1965).Â  Additionally, â€œ[i]t is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal, but must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be preserved for appellate review.â€ Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998). â€œThere are four basic requirements to preserving issues at trial for appellate review. The issue must have been (1) raised to and ruled upon by the trial court, (2) raised by the appellant, (3) raised in a timely manner, and (4) raised to the trial court with sufficient specificity.â€ Jean Hoefer Toal et al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 57 (2d ed. 2002).\r\nDuring trial, the court announced its intention to use a special verdict form and asked if either party objected to the use of the form.Â  SCDOT stated that â€œwe would just prefer the first verdict form.â€Â  The court denied the request finding the special verdict form appropriate and in the interest of â€œjudicial economy and appellate court economy.â€Â  The court then asked if either party wished to include more instructions regarding the use of the form, and SCDOT replied, â€œI understand and, your honor, if you are going to use this form then thatâ€™s fine, either way.â€Â  After the court charged the jury, but before the court gave the jury the verdict form, SCDOT again objected to the use of the verdict form stating â€œthe Department objects to the verdict form [sic] it emphasizes damages by its bifurcated nature and the Department doesnâ€™t believe that the landowner has proven its damages to the standards required by the law in this case.â€Â  The court overruled SCDOTâ€™s objection.\r\nSCDOT filed a motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict asserting that the verdict form was unduly suggestive.Â  The trial court found that SCDOT did not object to the use of the verdict form on that basis, and therefore, the court found that the objection was waived.Â  SCDOT argues that although it did not use those exact words, it nonetheless objected to the use of the special verdict form on the basis that it emphasized the appraisal method advocated by First Carolina.\r\nWe hold that SCDOT made a timely objection to the use of the special verdict form.Â  Although SCDOT did not phrase its objection in the exact terms used in the issues on appeal, SCDOTâ€™s objection on the basis that the verdict form â€œemphasizes damages by its bifurcated natureâ€ provided a meaningful objection with sufficient specificity to allow the trial court to rule on the issue.Â  State v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 134, 546 S.E.2d 202, 204 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding that a party need not use the exact name of a legal doctrine in order to preserve an argument, but it must be clear that the argument has been presented on that ground).Â  In fact, the trial court denied the motion finding that the form did not emphasize damages because the jury could choose to calculate damages using SCDOTâ€™s proposed method and fill in only the first question.Â  Further, SCDOTâ€™s initial objection and discussion with the trial court regarding the use of the special verdict form was not a concession to the use of the form.Â  The record reflects that SCDOTâ€™s statement, â€œI understand and, your honor, if you are going to use this form then thatâ€™s fine, either way,â€ was simply a response to the courtâ€™s question concerning any requests for additional instructions to the jury on the form.Â  \r\nTurning to the merits, a special verdict question may be so defective in its formulation that its submission results in a prejudicial effect which constitutes reversible error.Â  9A Wright &amp; Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure, Civil 2d Â§ 2508, p.193.Â  In evaluating the prejudicial effect of a defective special verdict question or special interrogatory, the court must consider the question or interrogatory along with the instructions given to the jury.Â  Fortune v. Gibson, 304 S.C. 279, 282, 403 S.E.2d 674, 675 (Ct. App. 1991) (finding that special interrogatories and instructions must be considered together).Â  The prejudicial effect of a defective verdict form may be cured where the trial court provides clear and cogent jury instructions.Â \r\nSee State v. Covert, 368 S.C. 188, 214, 628 S.E.2d 482, __ (Ct. App. 2006); State v. Myers, 344 S.C. 532, 536, 544 S.E.2d 851, 853 (Ct. App. 2001).[2] Â Â \r\nThe special verdict form submitted to the jury by the court asked three questions: [3] Â Â \r\n\r\n1) We, the jury, unanimously find just compensation for the landowner for the land actually taken by the Department of Transportation to be __________________.\r\n2) Do you, the jury, unanimously find any special damages to the remaining property of the landowner that are a direct and proximate result of the taking? ___ No.Â  If No is chosen, end deliberations and sign verdict form.Â  ___ Yes.Â  If Yes is chosen, go to Question 3.\r\n3) We, the jury, unanimously find special damages to the remaining property of the landowner in the amount of _______________.\r\n\r\nDuring the jury charge, the trial court explained to the jury that it could find just compensation using either of the two methods presented during trial.Â  The court went on to explain fully both the â€œbefore and afterâ€ method of calculation, and also the appraisal method which requires a finding of the value of land taken plus damage to the remaining property.Â  At the end of the jury charge, the court explained the use of the verdict form.Â Â Â  The court further explained that the jury was not required to find any compensation under Question 3, but if it did find compensation under Question 3, that amount would be in addition to the compensation found in Question 1.Â  \r\nReading the verdict form in conjunction with the jury instructions, we find that any possible confusion or misapprehension caused by the verdict form was remedied by the instructions from the court.Â  The form did not misstate the law or restrict the juryâ€™s finding to one method of calculation. Â Furthermore, although SCDOT argues that the more prudent choice would have been to use a general verdict form, SCDOT presented no evidence that the use of the special verdict form bent the will of the jury or prejudiced SCDOT in any way.Â  \r\nAccordingly, the special verdict form utilized by the trial court was not unduly suggestive or misleading, and did not prejudice SCDOT.Â  Additionally, any perceived defect in the form was cured by the trial courtâ€™s instructions as to the law and use of the form.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the forgoing reasons, we affirm.\r\n MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr., and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In the interest of clarity, we have reorganized and combined issues II through VII presented by SCDOT for this Courtâ€™s review.\r\n[2] Rule 49, SCRCP, is identical to the federal rule.Â  Under federal case law, it is improper to use a special verdict form which is likely to confuse or mislead the jury.Â  However, such error may be corrected by clear instructions to the jury.Â  See Sanghvi v. City of Claremont, 328 F.3d 532, 541-42 (9th Cir. 2003); Greenleaf v. Garlock, Inc., 174 F.3d 352, 363 (3rd Cir. 1999); Â Horstmyer v. Black &amp; Decker, Inc., 151 F.3d 765, 771-72 (8th Cir. 1998); Umpleby v. Potter &amp; Brumfield, Inc., 69 F.3d 209, 214 (7th Cir. 1995); and Cutlass Productions, Inc. v. Bregman, 682 F.2d 323, 327 (2nd Cir. 1982).Â Â Â  \r\n[3] The special verdict form used by the trial court closely resembles the measure of just compensation as required in the Eminent Domain Procedure Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-370 (2005) (providing that â€œin determining just compensation, only the value of the property to be taken, any diminution in the value of the landownerâ€™s remaining property, and any benefits as provided in Â§ 28-2-360 may be consideredâ€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26276","title":"James v.

McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Sabrina C. Todd, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAppellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this PCR case, the court of appeals held that the fact that Respondent Willie James (â€œRespondentâ€) had actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek a sentence of life without the possibility of parole under South Carolinaâ€™s recidivist statute did not satisfy the Codeâ€™s requirement that both Respondent and his counsel receive written notice of the Stateâ€™s intention prior to Respondentâ€™s trial.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals held that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object that Respondent did not receive the required written notification.Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent was convicted of armed robbery in April 1998.Â  Because Respondentâ€™s criminal record included a previous conviction for armed robbery, Respondent was eligible to be sentenced under South Carolinaâ€™s â€œtwo strikes/three strikesâ€ recidivist statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003).Â  Pursuant to the statute, the trial court sentenced Respondent to imprisonment for life without the possibility of parole (â€œLWOPâ€), and this Court upheld the trial courtâ€™s decision on direct appeal.Â  State v. James, Op. No. 2000-MO-101 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 19, 2000).\r\nIn 2001, Respondent filed a petition for post-conviction relief.Â  As one of several grounds raised in his petition, Respondent alleged that his trial counsel was ineffective in not objecting to Respondentâ€™s sentence on the basis of the Stateâ€™s failure to provide Respondent with written notice of its intention to seek LWOP as required by Â§ 17-25-45(H).\r\nThe PCR court denied Respondent relief and offered two principal bases for its decision.Â  First, the court found that both Respondent and his trial counsel were aware of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek LWOP well in advance of Respondentâ€™s trial.Â  In light of this Courtâ€™s precedent providing that Â§ 17-25-45(H) requires only actual notice, see State v. Washington, 338 S.C. 392, 526 S.E.2d 709 (2000), the PCR court concluded that the statute had not been violated.Â  The court distinguished the court of appeals case State v. Johnson, 347 S.C. 67, 552 S.E.2d 339 (Ct. App. 2001) (holding that Â§ 17-25-45(H)â€™s written notice requirement is mandatory), on the grounds that in the instant case, it was Respondent, and not trial counsel, who did not receive written notification.Â  As a second basis for its decision, the PCR court found that providing written notice to Respondentâ€™s trial counsel, who was Respondentâ€™s agent for service of official documents, would be sufficient to comply with a requirement that written notice be provided to Respondent.Â  \r\nThe court of appeals reversed the PCR courtâ€™s decision.Â  Relying directly on its opinion in Johnson, the court held that Â§ 17-25-45(H) was clear and unambiguous in its requirement that both a defendant and his counsel be served with written notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek an LWOP sentence prior to trial.Â  James v. State, 368 S.C. 323, 325, 628 S.E.2d 892, 893 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  The court held that trial counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness given his failure to object to the Stateâ€™s clear non-compliance with the statute, and the court found that this deficiency prejudiced Respondent because Respondent was â€œsentenced to [LWOP] in violation of the statute.â€Â  Id. at 325-26, 628 S.E.2d at 894.\r\nAfter the court of appeals remitted the case, we ordered the court of appeals to recall the remittitur and announced our intention to grant a writ of certiorari.Â  The State presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the court of appeals err in finding that trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object to Respondentâ€™s sentence where Respondent did not receive written notice that the State would be seeking a sentence of life without the possibility of parole?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s findings and conclusions.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing McCray v. State, 317 S.C. 557, 455 S.E.2d 686 (1995)).Â  A PCR courtâ€™s findings will be upheld on review if there is any evidence of probative value supporting them.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nTo establish a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant must establish both that counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and that but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).Â Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe State argues that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object that Respondent had not been provided with written notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek an LWOP sentence prior to trial.Â  We agree.\r\nAs an initial matter, the posture in which the issue of Respondentâ€™s receipt of notice arose at trial is revealing.Â  During the preliminary motions phase immediately preceding Respondentâ€™s trial, the parties engaged in a discussion with the trial court about the issue of notice.Â  At the beginning of this colloquy, both Respondent and Respondentâ€™s counsel indicated that each was aware that Respondent was facing the possibility of an LWOP sentence. Â The court then inquired as to whether the solicitor had given written notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek such a sentence, and the solicitor indicated that although a copy of the notice was not filed with the clerkâ€™s office, he had provided written notice to Respondentâ€™s counsel approximately six months prior to trial.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel then indicated that the defense â€œhad noticeâ€ and had â€œknown about this for months.â€Â  The issue of notice was not raised again until the sentencing phase of Respondentâ€™s trial, and during the sentencing proceeding, the solicitor provided the court with a copy of the written notice he had previously given to Respondentâ€™s counsel.Â  The court indicated that the parties had agreed that the defense was on notice as to the potential sentence in the case and that â€œnotice was adequate.â€\r\nAs these facts demonstrate, the issue of notice arose first at the pre-trial stage and the discussion concluded when Respondentâ€™s counsel stipulated that the defense had received adequate notice.Â  Given this scenario, the proper interpretation of Respondentâ€™s PCR claim is that counsel should have objected that Respondent had not been provided with written notice as required by the statute instead of stipulating that notice was adequate.Â  Respondentâ€™s claim may not be interpreted as an assertion that his counsel should have stipulated as he did during the pre-trial phase and then raised this issue again at sentencing.Â  See Erickson v. Jones Street Publishers, L.L.C., 368 S.C. 444, 475-76, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006) (providing that generally, a party may not complain about an error induced by his own conduct).\r\nThis clarification is important because assuming that Respondentâ€™s counsel was deficient for failing to object to the alleged non-compliance with the statute, Respondent cannot demonstrate that this deficiency resulted in any prejudice.Â  As this Courtâ€™s precedent provides, jeopardy does not attach in a jury trial until the jury is sworn and impaneled.Â  State v. Rountree, 127 S.C. 261, 262, 121 S.E. 205, 205 (1924).Â  In the instant case, counselâ€™s stipulation occurred pre-trial and before the jury was sworn.Â  Thus, assuming that competent counsel would have objected based on the lack of written notice instead of stipulating that notice was adequate, upon hearing such an objection, the solicitor could simply have dismissed the indictment, re-indicted Respondent, provided Respondent with written notice, and proceeded to seek an LWOP sentence.Â  Furthermore, leaving jeopardy analysis aside, it would have been entirely proper for the solicitor, upon hearing counselâ€™s objection, to have concluded with the pre-trial motions in the case and postponed Respondentâ€™s trial to allow the solicitor to provide Respondent with written notice.Â  Either of these procedures would have resulted in Respondent receiving an LWOP sentence despite the objection that Respondent contends trial counsel should have offered.\r\nThe court of appeals was mistaken in characterizing the prejudice in this case as Respondent being sentenced in violation of the statute.Â  Instead, the proper characterization of any error is that Respondent agreed to proceed immediately to trial despite the violation of the statute.Â  Instructively, there is no authority that would prevent the State, should this Court grant Respondentâ€™s request for a new trial, from seeking an LWOP sentence under the recidivist statute on remand.[1]\r\nRespondent cannot demonstrate that but for trial counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable probability the result of the trial would have been different.Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals erred in determining that Respondent received ineffective assistance from his trial counsel. [2]Â  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s argument in favor of reversal goes along different lines.[3]Â Â  Specifically, the State argues that the court of appeals erred in reversing Respondentâ€™s sentence because Â§ 17-25-45(H) requires only actual notice.Â  Again, we agree.\r\nThe recidivist statuteâ€™s notice provision, Â§ 17-25-45(H), provides:\r\n\r\nWhere the solicitor is required to seek or determines to seek sentencing of a defendant under this section, written notice must be given by the solicitor to the defendant and the defendantâ€™s counsel not less than ten days before trial.\r\n\r\nOur decision in State v. Washington controls the resolution of this issue.Â  That case involved a prosecution for first degree burglary, and although the solicitor gave the defendant written notice that he would be seeking a sentence under the recidivist statute, due to errors in the original indictment, the solicitor later re-indicted the defendant.Â  338 S.C. at 398, 526 S.E.2d at 711-12.Â  After the re-indictment, the solicitor did not send a second notice to the defendant.Â  Id. at 398, 526 S.E.2d at 712.\r\nWe held that the failure to send a second notice to the defendant did not prevent the imposition of an LWOP sentence under the recidivist statute.Â  After recounting the fact that South Carolina law has historically not required that a defendant be informed if he is going to be punished more severely on the basis of his previous convictions, we stated â€œ[t]his Court has found that under such notice statutes, the law only requires actual notice.â€Â  Id. at 399, 526 S.E.2d at 712.Â  Ultimately, this Court concluded that since the defendant â€œhad actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intent, a second notice following re-indictment was unnecessary.â€Â  Id.\r\nDespite Washingtonâ€™s clear pronouncement, the court of appeals reached a contrary interpretation of Â§ 17-25-45(H) in State v. Johnson, on which the court based its decision in the instant case.Â  In Johnson, the court of appeals held:\r\n\r\nBy its words in the recidivist statute, the General Assembly has mandated that the solicitor â€œmustâ€ notify the defendant and the defendantâ€™s counsel in writing if the solicitor intends to seek a life sentence without the possibility of parole. . . . In our view, actual notice under section 17-25-45(H) is insufficient unless and until the General Assembly decides otherwise and amends the statute itself.\r\n\r\n347 S.C. at 70, 552 S.E.2d at 340.Â  The court of appeals distinguished Washington on the grounds that, in that case, the defendant had received written notice that the solicitor was seeking to invoke the recidivist statute, albeit before the original indictment was dismissed.Â  Johnson, 347 S.C. at 71, 552 S.E.2d at 341.Â  The court opined that Washington\r\nwas decided on the basis that the prior written notice sufficiently satisfied the statuteâ€™s written notice requirement.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe fact that we declined to grant a writ of certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision in Johnson is not an impediment to our reviewing the merits of that decision now.Â  Although there are subtle distinctions in the facts presented in Washington and Johnson, any attempt to make a meaningful distinction between the cases does not withstand serious scrutiny.[4]Â  Thus, we are faced with a situation in which this Court has made a clear pronouncement on an issue, and the court of appeals has subsequently strayed from adhering to that pronouncement.Â  Either the rule we announced in Washington\r\nrequires revision, or the rule requires restating.\r\nNothing about our holding in Washington was equivocal, and we can discern no sufficient rationale for adopting a rule contrary to the one we there advanced. Â The purpose of Â§ 17-25-45(H) is to assure that a defendant and his counsel have actual notice that the State is seeking a sentence under the recidivist statute at least ten days prior to trial.Â  Accordingly, so long as the defendant and his counsel, at least ten days prior to trial, possess actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intention to seek a sentence under South Carolinaâ€™s recidivist statute, the statute has been satisfied.Â  As the court of appealsâ€™ decision in State v. Johnson is inconsistent with this pronouncement, it is overruled.[5]\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Indeed, if Respondent was charged with armed robbery on remand, a â€œmost serious offenseâ€ as defined in Â§ 17-25-45(C), the solicitor would, in fact, be required to seek an LWOP sentence under the recidivist statute. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(G) (2003).Â  Similarly, if Respondent was again found guilty, the trial court would have no choice but to sentence Respondent to LWOP.\r\n[2] Though we express no opinion on how our analysis would differ in the face of such a claim, we note that Respondent has not asserted that receiving written notice would have affected the merits of the defense he presented at trial.\r\n[3] Although the State has not presented the prejudice analysis we have outlined, our appellate rules provide that we may affirm a decision upon any grounds appearing in the record.Â  Rule 220(c), SCACR.\r\n[4] While the scenario in Washington dealt with the defendantâ€™s receipt of written notice in a re-indictment situation, the issue of notification in Johnson dealt with the defendantâ€™s attorney, who had not provided with written notice at any time.Â  In light of the actual holdings in these cases, however, this distinction is insignificant.\r\n[5] As a practical matter, the most effective way of assuring that both defendant and counsel receive actual notice in the required time frame is to provide them notice in writing.Â  Though this seems a simple task, the frequency with which this issue has appeared in our jurisprudence reveals that it is overlooked with surprising regularity.Â  This problem ought to be easily identifiable and preventable.\r\nFinally, there is ample evidence to support the PCR courtâ€™s conclusion that both Respondent and his counsel had actual notice of the Stateâ€™s intentions.Â  Trial counsel testified at the PCR hearing that he had notice several months prior to Respondentâ€™s trial, and Respondent indicated on several occasions, including months in advance of trial, that he knew he was facing an LWOP sentence under â€œthe habitual criminal act.â€ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26277","title":"Johnson v.

Brogdon, Jr., Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26277\r\nHeard January 18, 2007 - Filed February 27, 2007Â Â \r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeputy Director for Legal Services Teresa A. Knox, Assistant Chief Legal Counsel J. Benjamin Aplin, and Legal Counsel Tommy Evans, Jr., all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nDeputy Chief Attorney Wanda H. Carter, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, the trial court held that the absence of a favorable recommendation from a probation officer did not deprive the court of subject matter jurisdiction to grant early termination of a personâ€™s probation.Â  Relying on technical defects in the appeal, the court of appeals affirmed.Â  This Court granted the South Carolina Department of Probation, Parole, &amp; Pardon Servicesâ€™ (â€œthe Departmentâ€™sâ€) petition for a writ of certiorari, and we now affirm.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis case arises out of Dwayne Elliott Johnsonâ€™s (â€œJohnsonâ€™sâ€) successful pro se motion to have his probation terminated early.Â  In April 1992, Johnson was convicted of first degree burglary and grand larceny.Â  Although Johnson received a sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment, the trial court suspended the sentence conditioned upon the service of eighteen years imprisonment and five years probation for the burglary conviction, and ten years imprisonment for the grand larceny conviction.Â  Johnson was released from prison in 2000 and began probation in April 2001.\r\nApproximately one year after beginning his probation, Johnson filed a pro se motion asking the court to terminate his probation early.Â  At a hearing on the motion, the Department argued that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Johnsonâ€™s request because the request was not accompanied by a recommendation from the agent in charge of the responsible county probation office in support of early termination.\r\nThe trial court held that subject matter jurisdiction over the issue of early termination of probation was not contingent upon the presence of a recommendation from the Department.Â  After hearing testimony from witnesses offered by Johnson and the Department,[1] the trial court terminated Johnsonâ€™s probation effective April 2003; exactly two years after Johnson began serving his probation sentence and approximately three years early.Â  The Department appealed.\r\nThe court of appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision in an unpublished opinion.Â  See Johnson v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Probation, Parole, &amp; Pardon Serv., Op. No. 04-UP-430 (S.C. Ct. App. filed July 9, 2004).Â  The court noted that the Department failed to include Johnsonâ€™s original pro se motion and the trial courtâ€™s final order in the record on appeal, and also that the Department failed to place the documents in the record in the proper order.Â  Id.Â  The court relied on the fact that, as the appellant, the Department had the burden of presenting an adequate record on appeal.Â  Id.Â  The court of appeals thus declined to address the merits of the Departmentâ€™s arguments.\r\nThe Department unsuccessfully petitioned the court of appeals to allow the Department to supplement the record on appeal and to grant rehearing in the matter, and this Court granted the Departmentâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  The Department presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the court of appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision based upon the Departmentâ€™s failure to present an adequate record on appeal?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe Department argues that the court of appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s decision based upon the Departmentâ€™s failure to present an adequate record on appeal.Â  We disagree.\r\nOrdinarily, no point will be considered which does not appear in the record on appeal.Â  Rule 210(h), SCACR.Â  Because court rules require the appealing party to prepare the record on appeal, see Rule 210(a), SCACR, South Carolina courts have traditionally held the appealing party accountable for failing to present the court with an adequate record on appeal for review.\r\nFor example, the case of Polson v. Burr arose out of an automobile collision involving three vehicles, and the case originated when the driver of one of the vehicles sued the driver of the second vehicle.Â  235 S.C. 216, 217-18, 110 S.E.2d 855, 856 (1959).Â  On appeal, the driver of the second vehicle argued that the trial court erred in denying his motion to join both the driver and the owner of the third vehicle as necessary parties to the action.Â  Id. at 217, 110 S.E.2d at 856.Â  In dismissing the appeal, this Court stated:\r\n\r\nThe record states that the Court below refused this motion, although for some unexplained reason the order is not included in the record.Â  . . . [T]he appeal here is not in such shape as to allow us to properly consider the merits.Â  Owing to the failure to incorporate in the record the order from which the appeal is taken, we are not advised as to the grounds upon which the motion was denied . . . . \r\n\r\nId. at 218-19, 110 S.E.2d at 856.\r\nAlthough the record on appeal in the instant case contains the full transcript of the hearing before the trial court, including the Departmentâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction argument and the trial courtâ€™s oral ruling on the issue, the Department failed to include the trial courtâ€™s final order in the record.Â  As both court rule and this Courtâ€™s precedent provide, a judgment is effective only when reduced to writing and entered into the record.Â  Rule 58(a)(2), SCRCP;Â  see also Case v. Case, 243 S.C. 447, 451, 134 S.E.2d 394, 396 (1964) (providing that an oral decision â€œis not a final ruling on the merits nor is it binding on the parties until it has been reduced to writing, signed by the Judge [sic] and delivered for recordation.â€).Â  Because the Department failed to include the trial courtâ€™s final order in the record on appeal, the court of appeals properly decided the case without reaching the merits.\r\nTo support its argument for reversal, the Department alleges that the Court has an independent obligation to determine the existence of subject matter jurisdiction and that the lower court erred in dismissing the appeal on procedural grounds â€œwithout recognizing the potential impact of the [trial courtâ€™s] decision on South Carolinaâ€™s unified judicial system.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThis argument vastly overstates the case.Â  Primarily, the Department misinterprets an appellate courtâ€™s obligation regarding subject matter jurisdiction.Â  As this Courtâ€™s precedent expressly provides, lack of subject matter jurisdiction in a case may not be waived and ought to be taken notice of by an appellate court.Â  Amisub of S.C., Inc. v. Passmore, 316 S.C. 112, 114, 447 S.E.2d 207, 208 (1994) (citing Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 382 S.E.2d 897 (1989)).Â  Accordingly, the court of appeals was only required to address the issue of subject matter jurisdiction if it appeared that the lower court did not possess subject matter jurisdiction.\r\nAs we have instructed, subject matter jurisdiction refers to a courtâ€™s constitutional or statutory power to adjudicate a case.Â  State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 100, 610 S.E.2d 494, 498 (2005).Â  Stated somewhat differently, â€œsubject matter jurisdiction is the power of a court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.â€Â  Id. (citing Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 526 S.E.2d 222 (2000)).\r\nArticle V, Â§ 11 of the South Carolina Constitution provides that â€œ[t]he Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.â€Â  Dealing specifically with the issue of probation, the South Carolina Code provides that â€œthe judge of a court of record with criminal jurisdiction at the time of sentence may suspend the imposition . . . of a sentence and place the defendant on probation . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-410 (Supp. 2005).\r\nThe Department argues that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to consider Johnsonâ€™s request because the request was not accompanied by a recommendation from the agent in charge of the responsible county probation office in support of early termination.Â  This argument is based upon the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-23-130 (Supp. 2005), which provides that â€œ[u]pon the satisfactory fulfillment of the conditions of probation, the court, with the recommendation of the agent in charge of the responsible county probation office, may terminate the probationer or supervised prisoner from supervision.â€\r\nModern notions of subject matter jurisdiction, illustrated by this Courtâ€™s opinion in Gentry, resoundingly reject the Departmentâ€™s position.Â  Clearly, the circuit courtâ€™s power and authority to hear cases involving probation derives from Article V, Â§ 11 of the South Carolina Constitution and Â§ 24-21-410 of the Code.Â  Accordingly, a recommendation from the probation office has no relevance to the circuit courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction to hear cases involving the early termination of probation.\r\nTo support its subject matter jurisdiction argument, the Department relies on several cases dealing with the issue of probation revocation.Â  Specifically, these cases hold that a court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to revoke probation or hear a matter involving a probation violation absent the issuance of an arrest warrant from a probation officer.Â  See e.g. State v. Felder, 313 S.C. 55, 56, 437 S.E.2d 42, 43 (1993) (â€œIf a warrant has not been issued, the trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to revoke probation . . . .â€); and Gray v. State, 276 S.C. 634, 636, 281 S.E.2d 226, 226 (1981) (â€œFailure to comply with the warrant procedures . . . deprives the trial court of subject matter jurisdiction to revoke probation.â€).\r\nAt the outset, this argument is unpersuasive due to the distinctions between the statutes at issue.Â  Section 24-21-300 provides â€œ[t]he issuance of a citation or warrant . . . gives jurisdiction to the court . . . at any hearing on the violation.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Similarly, Â§ 24-21-450 provides that a warrant must be issued before a probationer may be detained so that he may then be brought before a judge.Â  In contrast, Â§ 24-23-130 does not contain the word â€œjurisdiction,â€ nor is the statute characterized by such process-oriented language as is found in Â§ 24-21-450.[2]\r\nFurthermore, the phrasing of the statute belies the interpretation the Department offers.Â  Specifically, Â§ 24-23-130 suggests that the recommendation of the probation officer is only necessary at some stage before a personâ€™s probation may be terminated early.Â  Accordingly, the plainest reading of the statue does not support the proposition that a court only has the power to hear early termination of probation cases after a probation officer has made a favorable recommendation.Â  Instead, the statute contemplates that the trial court (1) has the discretion to call an early termination of probation case, on either the Departmentâ€™s or the probationerâ€™s motion, (2) has the power to decide whether it shall conduct a hearing (which is required to include the probation officerâ€™s recommendation), and (3) has full discretion in ultimately rendering a decision.Â  Instructively, this is the precise scenario that occurred in the instant case.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1] At the hearing, a Department witness testified that the Department was opposed to early termination of Johnsonâ€™s probation.\r\n[2] Because this case does not involve probation revocation, we express no opinion as to the effect this Courtâ€™s holdings in Gentry and Dove v. Gold Kist, 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994) may have on the continued validity of prior pronouncements that an arrest warrant affects a courtâ€™s subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26278","title":"State v.

Maryland and Rule 5, SCRCrimP; and 3) failing to admit the defense expertâ€™s opinion testimony that the death penalty was more merciful than a sentence of life without parole.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nIn June 2000, Cpl. Dennis Lyden of the Horry County Police Department (â€œCpl. Lydenâ€) was placing Bryant under arrest for driving with a suspended license when Bryant suddenly turned and wrestled Cpl. Lyden to the ground.Â  During the course of the struggle, Bryant managed to obtain Cpl. Lydenâ€™s flashlight and pistol magazine from the officerâ€™s duty belt and used them to severely beat Cpl. Lyden about the head.Â  After beating the officer unconscious, Bryant took Cpl. Lydenâ€™s pistol from his holster and shot him in the head at close range.Â  Bryant drove off, taking the pistol and the pistol magazine with him and leaving Cpl. Lydenâ€™s body where it had fallen.Â  After an extensive manhunt, Horry County law enforcement apprehended Bryant the next day.Â  \r\nA grand jury indicted Bryant for murder and armed robbery.Â  Bryantâ€™s first issue on appeal involves the jury selection and capital voir dire beginning in September 2004.[1] Â During jury selection, the parties individually examined a total of sixty-seven jurors divided into thirteen panels.Â  During individual voir dire, the parties inquired to the court about the method of jury selection.Â  The court replied that jurors would be called for striking in the same order they had been qualified and that jurors would be brought before the parties to view before striking.Â  The trial court eventually qualified forty-three potential jurors for service.Â  \r\nDuring the selection process, counsel for Bryant requested that the jurors be redrawn before being presented for striking.Â  The trial court agreed to the request, but announced that instead of physically appearing for final jury selection, the parties would note their selections on a paper list of the jurors in the revised order based on their recollections from individual voir dire (â€œpaper strikesâ€).Â  Bryantâ€™s counsel objected to this method of jury selection claiming that because they had counted on physically viewing the jurors, counsel had not taken sufficient notes during voir dire to adequately exercise paper strikes.Â Â  The court assured the defense that they would be given a chance to review their notes, juror sheets, and information forms, and reminded counsel that they had extensively interviewed each juror the week before.Â  When counsel continued to object to paper strikes, the court offered them a chance to withdraw their request to have the jurors redrawn and instead conduct jury selection as originally planned.Â  Counsel for Bryant declined this offer and jury selection proceeded with the jurors being redrawn and the parties exercising paper strikes.\r\nThe trial court initially addressed the issue in Bryantâ€™s second claim on appeal in a pre-trial motion to compel.Â  During the motion hearing, Bryant claimed that the State was withholding certain discoverable documents believed by Bryant to be in the custody of the South Carolina Department of Corrections (SCDC).Â  The court determined that the State had largely complied with Bryantâ€™s discovery requests, finding no reason not to believe the State when it claimed that certain documents being requested did not exist.Â  Where the existence of a particular document was unclear, the trial court ordered the State to offer a definitive answer as to whether or not the documents existed.Â  \r\nThe issue of document disclosure arose again at the conclusion of the guilt phase of the proceedings.Â  Just prior to the start of the sentencing phase, the court asked if any matters needed to be further addressed.Â  Neither party requested any further hearing at that point.Â  However, during the sentencing phase of the proceedings, the defense requested an in camera hearing on the Stateâ€™s failure to produce the same documents at issue in the pre-guilt phase motion to compel.Â  Reviewing the list of classes of documents Bryant claimed the State had failed to produce, the trial court again found no indication that the State had produced incomplete documents, or failed to produce any documents that in fact existed.Â  The court offered Bryant a chance to make a motion for continuance to which counsel for Bryant responded, â€œno.â€Â  \r\nThe next day, just before the defense called their last witness, Bryantâ€™s counsel moved for a continuance based on the Stateâ€™s failure to turn over the same SCDC records at issue in previous in camera discussions.Â  The court denied the motion for a continuance, finding once again that what records existed had been provided, and that even if records the State claimed were non-existent did actually exist, they would not prejudice Bryantâ€™s case.Â  \r\nThe trial court addressed the SCDC documents a final time when the defense moved for a new trial â€œbased on the Stateâ€™s noncompliance with the discovery rules and the Courtâ€™s denial of our motion for a continuance.â€Â  The court denied the motion noting that the issue had been dealt with â€œextensivelyâ€ and reiterated its findings made throughout the trial that some of the documents were in the possession of the defense; the alleged contents of other â€œmissingâ€ documents had been stipulated to; and there had been no showing of prejudice due to the absence of the documents.\r\nBryantâ€™s third claim on appeal involves the testimony of Lorita Whitaker (â€œWhitakerâ€), an expert in clinical social work and human behavior in prison, who testified for the defense during the sentencing phase on the dismal conditions of prison life.Â  When asked on direct if it was her opinion that prison was a pretty miserable place, she answered, â€œSome people feel that the death penalty is more merciful than life without parole.â€ The court sustained the Stateâ€™s prompt objection that the expert was â€œgetting into the ultimate issue.â€Â  \r\nAt the conclusion of the sentencing proceeding, the jury recommended Bryant be sentenced to death.Â  This appeal followed and Bryant raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court deny Bryantâ€™s constitutional right to a fair trial by an impartial jury by refusing Bryantâ€™s request to have the jurors physically present during jury selection?Â \r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      II.\r\n       Did the trial court deny Bryant a fair sentencing proceeding by refusing to order the State to produce Bryantâ€™s prison records?\r\n        \r\n        \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      III.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in refusing to allow Bryantâ€™s expert witness to opine that some people feel the death penalty is more merciful than a sentence of life without parole?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn criminal cases, an appellate court reviews errors of law only and is bound by the factual findings of the trial court unless clearly erroneous.Â  State v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  The conduct of a criminal trial is left largely to the sound discretion of the trial judge, who will not be reversed in the absence of a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Bridges, 278 S.C. 447, 448, 298 S.E.2d 212, 212 (1982).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when a trial courtâ€™s decision is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. Garrett, 350 S.C. 613, 619, 567 S.E.2d 523, 526 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis \r\nI.Â  Jury selection\r\nBryant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow the jurors to be physically present during jury selection.Â  Bryant claims the alleged error substantially impaired his ability to exercise peremptory strikes in a meaningful manner and therefore deprived him of his constitutional guarantee of a fair trial by an impartial jury.Â  See U.S. Const. Amend. VI; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  We disagree.\r\nPeremptory strikes are not constitutional rights.Â  They are creatures of statute and â€œa means to achieve the end of an impartial jury.â€Â  State v. Potts, 347 S.C. 126, 130, 554 S.E.2d 38, 40 (2001) (quoting Ross v. Oklahoma, 487 U.S. 81, 88 (1988)).Â  Therefore, a defendant seeking to overturn a guilty verdict based on the way in which peremptory challenges were exercised must show that the statute granting him peremptory challenges was violated or that the jury which tried him was not impartial.Â \r\nId. at 131, 554 S.E.2d at 40.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-7-1100 (Supp. 2005) provides:\r\n\r\nIn impaneling juries in criminal cases, the jurors shall be called, sworn and impaneled anew for the trial of each case, according to the established practice.Â  \r\n\r\nBryant argues that the trial court violated the statute granting him peremptory challenges because striking jurors on paper without physically viewing the jurors was not an â€œestablished practiceâ€ of jury selection.Â  \r\nBecause a trial court is given enormous discretion in conducting a criminal trial, we may logically conclude that â€œestablished practiceâ€ does not refer to only one method of impaneling a jury.Â  Although not the most common method of jury selection in criminal trials, paper strikes are often used in this jurisdiction and their use has been held to be valid.Â  See Potts, 347 S.C. 126, 554 S.E.2d 38 (upholding the use of paper strikes by a criminal defendant in magistrateâ€™s court who claimed the use of paper strikes violated his right to personally confront potential jurors).Â  Because Â§ 14-7-1100 is a blanket rule applicable in all criminal cases, this Court will not begin injecting judicial exceptions into the statutory scheme by holding that the paper strike method is only an â€œestablished practiceâ€ in non-death penalty cases.Â  \r\nFurthermore, there is no evidence that Bryant did not receive a fair trial by an impartial jury.Â  The record reveals a thorough screening process with over 800 pages of capital voir dire consisting of individual examination of each juror by defense counsel.Â  Additionally, when counsel for Bryant indicated they were unprepared for the paper strike method, the trial court granted the defense more time to review their notes prior to beginning the striking process and promised to give counsel extra time to decide on a strike during the procedure.Â  \r\nAdditionally, the record shows that Bryant affirmatively chose to forego the physical viewing of jurors and proceed with the paper strike method as part of a strategic move to generate a strike list more beneficial to the defense.Â  While the parties initially agreed to view jurors by calling them forward in the order they were qualified, counsel for Bryant later requested that the jurors be redrawn.Â  Although the solicitor did not object to a redraw, the trial court noted a disadvantage to the State in granting Bryantâ€™s request.Â  Therefore, the court allowed the jurors to be redrawn, but announced that by proceeding in this manner, the parties would strike the jurors on the paper list instead of viewing the jurors in person.Â  Upon objection by defense counsel to the use of paper strikes, the trial court gave Bryant the opportunity to withdraw his request to have the jurors redrawn and proceed with the original plan to view the jurors in the order they were qualified.Â  Bryantâ€™s counsel refused the trial courtâ€™s offer, indicating to this Court that counsel for Bryant clearly recalled enough about the jurors to know that a redraw would be more beneficial to their strategy than proceeding in the original order.Â  Without more to substantiate a claim of prejudice, Bryant may not now claim that the trial strategy he opted for warrants a new trial.Â \r\nSee State v. Babb, 299 S.C. 451, 455, 385 S.E.2d 827, 829 (1989) (â€œ[A] party cannot complain of an error which his own conduct has induced.â€).\r\nBecause the use of paper strikes did not deprive Bryant of a fair trial by an impartial jury, we hold that the trial court did not err in refusing to allow jurors to be present during jury selection.Â  Â \r\nII.Â  Discovery of Bryantâ€™s SCDC records\r\nBryant argues that the trial courtâ€™s failure to order the State to turn over SCDC documents after hearing Bryantâ€™s pre-guilt phase motion to compel denied Bryant a fair sentencing proceeding.Â  Bryant also argues that the trial courtâ€™s subsequent denial of a motion for continuance and a motion for a new trial, both based on the Stateâ€™s refusal to turn over the SCDC documents, denied Bryant a fair sentencing proceeding.Â  We disagree.\r\nUnder Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963), the State must disclose evidence that is favorable to the accused if the evidence is material to either guilt or punishment.Â  Defendants making a claim under Brady must demonstrate that 1) the evidence was favorable to the defense; 2) it was in the possession of or known to the prosecution; 3) it was suppressed by the prosecution; and 4) it was material to guilt or punishment.Â  Gibson v. State, 334 S.C. 515, 524, 514 S.E.2d 320, 324 (1999).Â  Similarly, under Rule 5, SCRCrimP, criminal defendants are entitled to their statements, criminal records, and any documents or tangible objects material to the preparation of their defense or intended for use by the prosecution.\r\nBryant sent a discovery request to the State requesting that his prison records be handed over as Brady and Rule 5 material.Â  These records included:Â  classification reports, behavioral reports, visitation reports, counseling records, work records, â€œshakedown logs,â€ cell inspection reports, and seminar records.Â  The trial court addressed Bryantâ€™s Brady and Rule 5 requests a total of four times during the trial - in a pre-guilt phase motion; in an in camera hearing during the sentencing phase; in a motion to compel at the close of the defenseâ€™s argument in the sentencing phase; and in a motion for a new trial.Â  Each of the four times Bryant raised the issue of the â€œmissingâ€ classes of documents supposedly accessible to SCDC and the State, the trial judge conducted a thorough examination into the nature of the requested documents, why the documents were necessary to Bryantâ€™s defense, and the Stateâ€™s reasons for not producing the documents.Â  \r\nIn the instant case, the trial courtâ€™s findings and conclusions as to each class of documents are clearly supported by the record and function to negate one or more of the elements required to make a claim under Brady.Â  Specifically, the trial court found that 1) the classification reports, behavioral reports, and counseling records had been handed over to Bryant by the State; 2) the absence of visitation reports, work records, cell inspection reports, and shakedown logs did not prejudice the defense - a finding that the defense acknowledged to be true; and 3) the visitation reports, work records, shakedown logs, and cell inspection reports did not exist.Â  Likewise, these findings negate the substantive requirements of Rule 5, SCRCrimP, which requires that the documents requested be â€œmaterialâ€ to the preparation of the defense.Â  \r\nMoreover, Bryantâ€™s acknowledgment to the trial court that the absence of certain documents would not be prejudicial to the defense goes squarely against Bryantâ€™s contention in this appeal.Â  If Bryant conceded that the courtâ€™s ruling was not prejudicial, he may not later assert that ruling denied him a fair trial.Â  See State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 51, 476 S.E.2d 683, 687 (1996) (by proceeding to trial after affirmatively stating â€œthe defense is ready,â€ a defendant waived his right to complain he was given inadequate time to preview discovery materials).\r\nBryantâ€™s claim is essentially grounded in the last-minute turnover of records by SCDC to Bryantâ€™s counsel the night before the trial.Â  We note that this Court does not condone such behavior, and we emphasize the importance of conscientiously honoring the requirements of Brady and Rule 5, SCRCrimP.[2] Â However, the acquisition of requested documents at the last minute is not uncommon in the practice of law and, in this case, is not grounds for a new trial in light of the trial courtâ€™s findings and the partiesâ€™ stipulations with respect to the various documents.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling on Bryantâ€™s various Brady and Rule 5 motions.Â  \r\nIII.Â Â Â  Expert witness testimony\r\nBryant argues that the trial court erred in refusing to allow Bryantâ€™s expert witness to opine that the death penalty was more merciful than a sentence of life without parole.Â  We disagree.\r\nAt trial, Bryant called Lorita Whitaker, an expert in clinical social work and â€œhuman behavior in prisons.â€Â  While testifying on direct examination on the dismal conditions of prison life in general, Whitaker stated that â€œsome people feel that the death penalty is more merciful than life without parole.â€Â  The State immediately objected to Whitakerâ€™s statement and the trial court sustained the objection.Â  Defense counsel immediately proceeded to his final question with no contemporaneous objection to the trial courtâ€™s ruling.Â  Because the issue was not raised to and ruled on by the trial court, the admissibility of Whitakerâ€™s statement is not preserved for appeal.Â \r\nSee State v. Moore, 357 S.C. 458, 593 S.E.2d 608 (2004).Â  \r\nThe circumstances of this case are nearly indistinguishable from those in our recent opinion in State v. Bowman, 366 S.C. 485, 623 S.E.2d 378 (2006), where although the admissibility of testimony on prison conditions had not been preserved for review, this Court warned:\r\n\r\nWe take this opportunity . . . to caution the State and the defense that evidence presented in a penalty phase of a capital trial is to be restricted to the individual defendant and the individual defendantâ€™s actions, behavior, and character.Â  Generally, questions involving escape and prison conditions are not relevant to the question of whether a defendant should be sentenced to death or life imprisonment without parole.Â  We emphasize that how inmates, other than the defendant at trial, are treated in prison . . . is inappropriate evidence in the penalty phase of a capital trial.Â  We admonish both the State and the defense that the penalty phase should focus solely on the defendant and any evidence introduced in the penalty phase should be connected to that particular defendant.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 498-499, 623 S.E.2d at 385.Â  We reiterate this admonishment in our opinion today and remain firm in our view that testimony seeking to portray life imprisonment as preferable to capital punishment is improper, particularly where, as here, the expertâ€™s testimony did not focus specifically on the defendant, but on prison conditions generally.Â  \r\nProportionality Review\r\nAs required, we conduct a proportionality review of Bryantâ€™s death sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  The United States Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is either excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 74 (1982).Â  In conducting a proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the death sentence has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the sentence in this case was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of similar cases illustrates that imposing the death sentence in this case would be neither excessive nor disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  See State v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500&nbsp;&nbsp;(1999) (holding that the death penalty was warranted where defendant killed a police officer performing a routine traffic stop); State v.\r\nShuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805 (1999) (holding that death penalty was proper where defendant killed the driver of armored van during armed robbery of the vehicle); and State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119; 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991) (holding that the death penalty was proper where the defendant shot a state trooper six times after being stopped for erratic driving).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm Bryantâ€™s conviction and death sentence in accordance with the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nMOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr., and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] The 2004 jury selection was for Bryantâ€™s second trial on these charges.Â  This Court reversed Bryantâ€™s 2001 conviction and death sentence in State v. Bryant, 354 S.C. 390, 581 S.E.2d 157 (2003), on the basis that law enforcementâ€™s contact with jurorsâ€™ family members compromised Bryantâ€™s right to a fair and impartial jury.\r\n[2] Specifically, we are concerned that the solicitor had to resort to subpoenaing SCDC in September 2004 in order to obtain records requested from SCDC pursuant to Bryantâ€™s Brady and Rule 5 motions filed in June 2004.Â  Furthermore, because SCDC did not promptly and fully comply with the solicitorâ€™s subpoenas, the solicitor had to make repeated phone calls and visits to SCDC in order to acquire the requested records.Â  The situation ultimately required a court order directing SCDC to immediately provide the parties with affirmative responses as to the whereabouts and/or existence of certain records requested by Bryant.Â  The record provides no reason for SCDCâ€™s delayed handling of the matter and we issue this reminder that state agencies are no different from the solicitor in their obligations to comply with the requirements of Brady and Rule 5.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26279","title":"In the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Larry Gene Beaver","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26279","description":"This case involves the issue of whether the circuit court erred by dismissing the State's Sexually Violent Predator petition.","date":"2007-02-27","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of the Care and Treatment of Larry Gene Beaver,\r\nRespondent,\r\nv.\r\nThe State of South Carolina, Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAppeal From Horry County\r\nÂ Edward B.

Stumbo, all of Columbia, for appellant.\r\nWilliam Isaac Diggs, of Myrtle Beach, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  Respondent pled guilty to one count of lewd act on a minor.Â  He was sentenced to seven years imprisonment, suspended on nine months confinement and three years probation.Â  The State commenced a civil action seeking respondentâ€™s commitment as a sexually violent predator pursuant to the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act (the SVP Act), S.C. Code Â§ 44-48-10 through -170 (Supp. 2006).Â  At the probable cause hearing, the judge found no probable cause to believe respondent is a sexually violent predator and dismissed the action.Â  We certified this case from the Court of Appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err by dismissing the Stateâ€™s Sexually Violent Predator petition?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1993, respondent was charged in Tennessee with four counts of aggravated rape of a child, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and two counts of incest.Â  The charges were based on the molestation of his ten-year-old and eight-year-old daughters, whom he had forced to perform multiple sex acts with him.Â  Respondent pled guilty to one count of aggravated sexual battery and one count of incest.Â  He was sentenced to eight years imprisonment on the sexual battery charge and six years imprisonment, to be served concurrently, on the incest charge.\r\nIn 2003, respondent was residing in South Carolina and was giving piano lessons in his home.Â  The mother of one of his piano students discovered numerous letters and e-mails respondent had written to her daughter, who was ten-years-old, between April and June 2003.Â  When the mother questioned the victim, she reported that between December 2002 and June 2003, respondent had hugged and kissed her, and, on one occasion, he ran his tongue over her lips.Â  The victim also stated respondent put his hand under her shirt and rubbed her chest area with his hands one day when she felt sick.\r\nRespondent was indicted on one count of lewd act on a child under the age of sixteen and one count of communicating obscene messages.Â  In September 2004, he pled guilty to the lewd act charge.\r\nPrior to respondentâ€™s release from prison, his case was referred to the Multi-Disciplinary Team, which assesses whether a prisoner should possibly be termed a â€œsexually violent predator.â€Â  His case was referred because his conviction of lewd act on a minor is a qualifying offense under the SVP Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(2)(k) (Supp. 2006).Â  The Multi-Disciplinary Team reviewed his case and determined there was probable cause to believe he is a sexually violent predator as defined by the SVP Act.Â  The Prosecutorâ€™s Review Committee also determined there was probable cause to believe respondent meets the statutory criteria for civil commitment as a sexually violent predator.\r\nThe State then filed a petition seeking respondentâ€™s civil commitment to the South Carolina Department of Mental Health for long-term control, care, and treatment as a sexually violent predator.Â  Judge John L. Breeden found the Stateâ€™s petition set forth sufficient facts to establish probable cause to believe respondent meets the statutory criteria for commitment.[1]Â  The case was then called for a probable cause hearing before Judge Edward B. Cottingham.[2]\r\nAt the hearing, the judge expressed his concern about applying the SVP Act to respondent because respondent â€œpled to fondling, non-violent [and] now they want to keep him in jail for something that they didnâ€™t indict him for.â€[3]Â  The judge stated he was concerned that respondent pled specifically to a non-violent fondling charge, apparently entered an Alford[4] plea[5] to that charge, and received only nine months of active time.Â  The judge stated it would be appropriate to use the SVP Act if respondent had raped or ravished someone or had intercourse with a young child; however, he did not think the SVP Act was intended for someone who pleads to a non-violent fondling charge.Â  At the conclusion of the hearing, the judge stated, â€œI canâ€™t order this but with his prior record, I would suggest that he quit teaching young children.â€\r\nIn his order, the judge found the State had failed to demonstrate that probable cause exists to find respondent to be a sexually violent predator and that the State had failed to provide sufficient evidence that respondent suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility as required by the SVP Act.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe lower court was asked to determine whether there was probable cause to believe respondent is a sexually violent predator.Â  A sexually violent predator is defined in the SVP Act as:Â  \r\n\r\n. . . a person who (a) has been convicted of a sexually violent offense; and (b) suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œSexually violent offenseâ€ includes committing a lewd act upon a child under sixteen.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(2)(k) (Supp. 2006).Â  â€œMental abnormalityâ€ means a mental condition affecting a personâ€™s emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to commit sexually violent offenses.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(3) (Supp. 2006).Â  Finally, â€œlikely to engage in acts of sexual violenceâ€ means the personâ€™s propensity to commit acts of sexual violence is of such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of others.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(9) (Supp. 2006).\r\nWe find the lower court erred by finding no probable cause to believe respondent meets the definition in the SVP Act.Â  Respondent meets part (a) of the definition because he has been convicted of a sexually violent offense, i.e. lewd act upon a child under sixteen.Â  The lower court erred by finding the lewd act charge was â€œnon-violent.â€Â  The lower court determined that respondent should not be confined as a sexually violent predator on the basis of a â€œnon-violentâ€ charge.Â  It is true that the lewd act charge is considered non-violent for criminal purposes.[6]Â  However, the Legislature has deemed it appropriate to consider that charge violent for the purposes of the SVP Act. Â Section 44-48-30(2)(k) includes committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under sixteen as a sexually violent offense that qualifies a person to be considered a sexually violent predator.Â  Accordingly, the lower court erred by referring to the lewd act charge as a non-violent charge in this civil probable cause hearing.\r\nFurther, the lower court erred by finding the State had failed to provide sufficient evidence that respondent suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder as required under part (b) of the definition.Â  At the probable cause hearing, the State introduced evidence that respondent suffers from pedophilia.Â  The State also presented sufficient evidence to show that there is probable cause to believe respondent is â€œlikely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.â€Â  This evidence consisted of respondentâ€™s guilty pleas to aggravated sexual battery and incest arising out of the molestation of one of his natural daughters.Â  A few years after respondentâ€™s release from prison, he performed a lewd act upon a ten-year-old girl.Â  While the first incident involved his own child, the next incident involved a young girl whom he had known only for a short time.Â  His behavior reveals a propensity to commit acts of sexual violence to such a degree as to pose a menace to the health and safety of young girls. \r\nPursuant to the SVP Act, and particularly S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(D) (Supp. 2006), the State is not able to require a mental examination of the offender until a judge, after a hearing, has found that there is probable cause to believe the offender is a sexually violent predator.Â  Therefore, the State is generally unable to produce any mental health information at the probable cause hearing because probable cause must first be found by a judge at the hearing before such evidence can be obtained. Â The Stateâ€™s inability to provide mental health evidence does not prevent a finding of probable cause.Â  Accordingly, the lower court erred by finding the State had failed to provide sufficient evidence that respondent suffers from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined.Â  Cf. In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 568 S.E.2d 338 (2002) (on review, the appellate court will not disturb the hearing courtâ€™s finding on probable cause unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the hearing courtâ€™s finding). \r\nAs an additional sustaining ground, respondent argues the Stateâ€™s petition should be dismissed because it cannot comply with the statutory requirement that the court must conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator within sixty days of the completion of the probable cause hearing.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2006) (â€œWithin sixty days after the completion of a [probable cause] hearing, the court must conduct a trial to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predatory.â€).Â  However, because probable cause was not found at the conclusion of the hearing, the time period set out in Â§ 44-48-90 is inapplicable.Â  Therefore, there is no merit to respondentâ€™s additional sustaining ground.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBecause there is no evidence to support the lower courtâ€™s finding on probable cause, we reverse and remand to the circuit court.Â  On remand, the circuit court shall direct that respondent be transferred to an appropriate secure facility for evaluation as to whether he is a sexually violent predator.Â  Further, on remand, the circuit court shall approve a qualified expert to conduct the evaluation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(D) (Supp. 2006).\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, J., and Acting Justices James W. Johnson, Jr., and L. Casey Manning, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(A) (Supp. 2006) (â€œUpon filing of a petition [for a probable cause determination,] the court must determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the person named in the petition is a sexually violent predator.Â  If the court determines that probable cause exists to believe that the person is a sexually violent predator, the person must be taken into custody if he is not already confined in a secure facility.â€).\r\n[2]See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(B) (Supp. 2006) (after the initial determination of probable cause by the court, â€œthe person must be provided with notice of the opportunity to appear in person at a hearing to contest probable cause as to whether the detained person is a sexually violent predator.â€).Â  If the probable cause determination is made at the hearing, then the court must direct that the person be transferred to an appropriate secure facility for an evaluation as to whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-80(D) (Supp. 2006).Â  After the evaluation, a trial is held to determine whether the person is a sexually violent predator.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-90 (Supp. 2006).Â  Therefore, a finding of probable cause at the probable cause hearing does not automatically place the person in confinement and finally decide the question of whether that person is a sexually violent predator.\r\n[3]The judge stated he was concerned that a judge can incarcerate someone and say, â€œâ€˜This is your sentence.â€™Â  And then they complete the sentence, and you say, â€˜Wait a minute.Â  We [sic] going to keep you a while longer.â€™â€Â  The judge further commented, â€œThe State had a chance to put him away forever if they chose to, and for reasons good and sufficient for them . . . they did not.Â  So, Iâ€™m not going to let you incarcerate him any further on this charge.â€Â  The judgeâ€™s comments on this point are in error.Â  See, e.g., In re Care and Treatment of Matthews, 345 S.C. 638, 550 S.E.2d 311 (2001), cert. denied, 535 U.S. 1062 (2002) (purpose of the SVP Act is civil commitment, which does not implicate retribution).\r\n[4]North Carolina v.
