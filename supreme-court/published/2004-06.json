Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nLarry S. Drayton, pro se, of Ridgeland.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to the sanctions provided \r\n  by Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set \r\n  forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nI.\r\nIn September 2001, Complainant A retained respondent \r\n  for the purposes of filing a Chapter 13 bankruptcy petition.Â  Respondent was \r\n  retained for a fee of $1,600 and, over time, Complainant A made payments of \r\n  approximately $1200 towards the retainer. \r\nOn April 8, 2002, respondent was suspended from the \r\n  practice of law for a period of ninety (90) days.Â  In the Matter of Drayton, \r\n  349 S.C. 60, 562 S.E.2d 319 (2002).Â  Respondentâ€™s suspension occurred before \r\n  Complainant Aâ€™s meeting with her creditors; respondent did not complete the \r\n  bankruptcy.Â  \r\nRespondent originally represented to ODC that he would \r\n  refund $1200 to Complainant A.Â  In June 2002, the United States Bankruptcy Court \r\n  ordered respondent to repay the attorneysâ€™ fees toÂ  Complainant A.Â  Respondent \r\n  did not refund the unearned fee to Complainant A.Â  \r\nII.\r\nOn November 1, 2002, respondent \r\n  was placed on interim suspension after being charged with possession of crack \r\n  cocaine.Â  In the Matter of Drayton, 352 S.C. 39, 572 S.E.2d 291 (2002).Â  \r\n  On November 19, 2002, respondent filed a pleading with the circuit court.Â  Thereafter, \r\n  he filed a second pleading in which he stated he was in good standing with the \r\n  South Carolina Bar at the time he filed the original pleading.Â  Respondent made \r\n  this representation to the circuit court with full knowledge that he had been \r\n  placed on interim suspension nineteen (19) days before he filed the original \r\n  pleading. [1] Â  \r\nIII.\r\nRespondent admits that, after \r\n  his interim suspension, he did not timely file the affidavit of compliance required \r\n  by Rule 30(g), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Additionally, he admits he did not timely \r\n  move to withdraw from representation of clients before the United States Bankruptcy \r\n  Court as required by Rule 30(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated \r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall \r\n  act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing clients); Rule \r\n  1.4 (lawyer shall keep clients informed); Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not charge \r\n  excessive fee); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall promptly deliver to client \r\n  any funds or other property to which client is entitled); Rule 1.16(a)(1) (lawyer \r\n  shall not represent client if representation violates Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct or other laws); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey an obligation \r\n  under the rules of a tribunal); Rule 5.5(a) \r\n  (lawyer shall not engage in unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer \r\n  shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall \r\n  not engage in conduct that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â Â In \r\n  addition, respondent admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, \r\n  RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding \r\n  professional conduct of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct \r\n  tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the \r\n  legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice \r\n  law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (lawyer shall not violate the oath of office taken upon \r\n  admission to practice law in this state).Â  Finally, respondent admits he has \r\n  violated Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (requirements for lawyer upon suspension).Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  The suspension shall be retroactive \r\n  to the date respondent was placed on interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days \r\n  of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender his certificate of admission \r\n  to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Although \r\n    the charge of possession of crack cocaine was nol prossed on February 24, \r\n    2004, respondent never moved to have the interim suspension lifted.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25831","title":"In the Matter of Mann","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25831","description":"This is an opinion concerning an attorney disciplinary matter.","date":"2004-06-01","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:windowtext;}\r\n.MsoTitle\r\n\t{text-align:center;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;\r\n\tfont-weight:bold;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-indent:.75in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent2\r\n\t{text-indent:1.0in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of John Plyler Mann, Jr.,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25831\r\nSubmitted April 26, 2004 - filed June \r\n  1, 2004\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Robert E. Bogan, \r\n  both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\nJohn Plyler Mann, Jr., pro se, of Greenville.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction provided \r\n  by Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement and indefinitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state.Â  The facts, as set \r\n  forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nOn May 3, 2003, respondent entered \r\n  a female residence hall on the University of South Carolina (USC) campus in \r\n  Columbia without authorization.Â  He went upstairs to the ninth floor where he \r\n  peered around a shower curtain at a female student taking a shower.Â  On the \r\n  sixth floor, he made an unauthorized entry into the dormitory room of a female \r\n  student on the pretense of looking for an individual named â€œElizabethâ€ and, \r\n  thereafter, attempted to engaged the student in conversation.Â  Respondent entered \r\n  the ladies restroom on the second floor of the residence hall.Â  \r\nWhile attempting to leave the residence \r\n  hall, respondent was arrested by campus police and charged with second degree \r\n  burglary, peeping tom, and disorderly conduct.Â  In his written statement to \r\n  the USC police, respondent states he â€œcame to USC to interview law students, \r\n  arrived early - toured campus - went in a dormitory - used the restroom - was \r\n  arrested when I left.â€Â  On July 17, 2003, the Richland County Grand Jury indicted \r\n  respondent on charges of second degree burglary and peeping tom.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nODC received notice of the indictments \r\n  on October 20, 2003.Â  On October 24, 2003, respondent was placed on interim \r\n  suspension; he has remained on interim suspension since that time.Â  In the \r\n  Matter of Mann, 356 S.C. 237, 588 S.E.2d 588 (2003).Â  \r\nOn October 24, 2003, respondent asked to \r\n  meet with ODC.Â  During the meeting, respondent represented that during the evening \r\n  of May 1, 2003, and early morning of May 2, 2003, he had been drinking heavily \r\n  with friends for several hours at more than one establishment in Greenville.Â  \r\n  When he returned home, he found the screen door to his house had been locked \r\n  from the inside by his wife.Â  Previously, respondentâ€™s wife had strenuously \r\n  objected to respondentâ€™s alcohol consumption.Â  \r\nRespondent stated he had scheduled \r\n  interviews at the USC School of Law beginning at 11:30 a.m. on May 2, 2003, \r\n  and decided to leave his residence and drive to Columbia.Â Â  On the way to Columbia, \r\n  respondent purchased beer and consumed some while driving.Â  \r\nRespondent represented he checked \r\n  into a motel in West Columbia around 4:00 a.m. and continued to drink beer.Â  \r\n  Believing his marriage was over and that he was â€œsingle for the first time in \r\n  twenty years,â€ respondent was despondent.Â  Respondent left the motel and traveled \r\n  to a USC fraternity house around 6:00 a.m.Â  The house was not locked and respondent \r\n  entered and walked around.Â  \r\nThereafter, respondent drove to \r\n  the married student housing facility and went to the apartment he believed he \r\n  and his wife had shared many years earlier.Â  Respondent knocked on the door \r\n  and was granted access by an unaccompanied female.Â  Respondent spoke with this \r\n  woman for approximately thirty minutes.\r\nRespondent then traveled to a residence \r\n  hall where he had lived while attending USC.Â  Respondent attempted to enter \r\n  the building but was denied access by a security guard.Â  \r\nRespondent did not know why he thereafter \r\n  walked to the female residence hall, but acknowledges he was â€œdrunk and wanting \r\n  to talk to girls, the bars were closed, and he was free for the first time in \r\n  twenty years.â€Â  During the approximately two hours that respondent was inside \r\n  the residence hall, he spoke with many females and, therefore, cannot recall \r\n  specific conversations;Â  he does recall entering at least one bathroom where \r\n  he looked into a shower occupied by a female after moving the shower curtain \r\n  which obscured his view. The female screamed.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s daughterâ€™s first name \r\n  is Elizabeth.Â  She does not attend USC.&nbsp; \r\nIn his response to the Notice of \r\n  Full Investigation, respondent admitted he had no legitimate reason for entering \r\n  the womenâ€™s dormitory.Â  As mitigation, he claimed he had an alcohol problem \r\n  that affected his family but not his law practice, that his behavior on May \r\n  2, 2003, was influenced by alcohol, and that he began attending Alcoholics Anonymous \r\n  on November 3, 2003.Â  \r\nOn February 4, 2004, respondent \r\n  pled guilty to second degree burglary and was sentenced to five years imprisonment, \r\n  suspended upon two years probation.Â  The peeping tom and disorderly conduct \r\n  charges will not be prosecuted.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated \r\n  the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:&nbsp;\r\nRule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  Rule 8.4(b) (lawyer shall not commit a criminal act that reflects adversely \r\n  on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); \r\n  Rule 8.4(c) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving moral turpitude); \r\n  Rule 8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, \r\n  deceit or misrepresentation); Rule 8.4(e) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to administration of justice). Â In addition, respondent \r\n  admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct \r\n  of lawyers), Rule 7(a)(4) (lawyer shall not be convicted of a crime of moral \r\n  turpitude or a serious crime), and Rule 7(a)(5) (lawyer shall not engage in \r\n  conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts \r\n  or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness \r\n  to practice law).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and indefinitely \r\n  suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  Respondentâ€™s request that the \r\n  suspension be made retroactive to the date of his interim suspension is denied.Â  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender \r\n  his certificate of admission to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court \r\n  and shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied \r\n  with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25832","title":"Fernanders v.

Leadbitter, \r\n  all of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of the South Carolina Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:Â  We granted certiorari to determine \r\n  whether the post-conviction relief (PCR) court erred by granting respondent \r\n  relief on three charges of possession of a pistol by a person convicted of a \r\n  crime of violence.Â  We reverse. \r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent pled guilty to second offense trafficking in crack cocaine, possession \r\n  of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, two counts of third offense \r\n  possession with intent to distribute (PWID) marijuana, three counts of possession \r\n  of a pistol by a person convicted of a crime of violence, third offense PWID \r\n  crack cocaine, third offense simple possession of marijuana, and third offense \r\n  PWID cocaine. [1] Â  Respondentâ€™s direct appeal was dismissed by \r\n  the Court of Appeals after an Anders review.Â  State v. Fernanders, \r\n  Op. No. 2000-UP-304 (S.C. Ct. App. filed April 25, 2000).\r\nFollowing a PCR hearing, the PCR court granted respondentâ€™s application \r\n  in part and denied it in part.Â  Only the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari \r\n  was granted.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the PCR court err by granting respondent relief on three charges of possession \r\n  of a pistol by a person convicted of a crime of violence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n Respondent pled guilty to three counts of possession of a pistol \r\n  by a person convicted of a crime of violence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann.\r\nÂ§ 16-23-30(e) (2003).Â  The prior violent crime on which these charges were \r\n  based was a strong arm robbery [2]  conviction from 1997. \r\nThe PCR court found the prior strong arm robbery was not a crime \r\n  of violence.Â  Accordingly, he found counsel was ineffective because there was \r\n  no factual basis for the plea, and he vacated the sentences on the three charges \r\n  of possession of a pistol by a person convicted of a crime of violence.\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-1-60 (2003) lists crimes classified \r\n  as violent â€œ[f]or purposes of definition under South Carolina law.â€Â  Section \r\n  16-1-60 indicates that only those offenses specifically enumerated are considered \r\n  violent offenses.Â  Strong arm robbery is not listed as a violent offense in \r\n  Â§ 16-1-60.Â  However, under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-10(c) (2003), robbery is listed \r\n  in the definition of a crime of violence.Â  Section 16-23-10 indicates the definitions \r\n  are for terms â€œused in this article.â€Â Â Â  \r\nIn State v. Rogers, 338 S.C. 435, 527 S.E.2d 101 (2000), we \r\n  held that by providing a list of crimes defined as violent in Â§ 16-1-60, the \r\n  legislature intended to have a uniform definition of violent crimes throughout \r\n  the Code.Â  We stated, â€œWe do not believe the legislature intended there to be \r\n  situations where the courts would treat offenses defined as â€˜violent crimesâ€™ \r\n  under one section and not treat these same offenses as â€˜crimes involving the \r\n  use of violenceâ€™ under another section of the same title.â€Â  Id. at 439, \r\n  527 S.E.2d at 104.\r\n Rogers indicates that, pursuant to Â§ 16-1-60, the legislature \r\n  intends to have a uniform definition of what is and what is not a violent crime.Â  \r\n  However, the instant case differs from Rogers in that the definition \r\n  of a crime of violence in Â§ 16-23-10 is in another section of Title 16, which \r\n  specifically states that it is the definition to be used under the article in \r\n  which it is contained.Â  Respondent pled guilty to the charges under Â§ 16-23-30, \r\n  which is contained in Article 1 of Chapter 23.Â  Section 16-23-10 indicates that \r\n  its definitions apply in Article 1.Â  Accordingly, the definition of a crime \r\n  of violence contained in Â§ 16-23-10(c) governs what constitutes a violent crime \r\n  for purposes of a conviction under Â§ 16-23-30.Â  See State v.

Hardaway, of Columbia, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  \r\n  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari to review whether \r\n  the post-conviction relief (PCR) judge erroneously granted Donney Councilâ€™s \r\n  (respondent) motion to stay the PCR proceedings until he was deemed competent.Â  \r\n  We reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s imposition of an indefinite stay and adopt a new \r\n  approach for determining whether a petitionerâ€™s PCR hearing should go forward \r\n  when he claims incompetence.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent was convicted \r\n  of murder, administering poison, burglary, larceny, grand larceny of a motor \r\n  vehicle, kidnapping, and criminal sexual assault in the first degree.Â  The jury \r\n  sentenced him to death for murder and gave him various concurrent and consecutive \r\n  sentences for the other offenses.Â  This Court affirmed the convictions and sentences.Â  \r\n  State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999).Â  \r\nFollowing the denial \r\n  of certiorari on his direct appeal, respondent filed an application for PCR.Â  \r\n  Subsequently, he filed a motion pro se to waive further PCR proceedings \r\n  and be executed.Â  On January 19, 2000, this Court issued an order staying respondentâ€™s \r\n  execution, allowing him to file an application for PCR.Â  After the PCR judge \r\n  appointed counsel for respondent, respondent filed an amended PCR petition and \r\n  motion to indefinitely stay the PCR proceedings.Â  A hearing was held on December \r\n  8, 2000, to review respondentâ€™s request to waive PCR and be executed.Â  Respondentâ€™s \r\n  testimony clearly indicated that he was mentally unstable, [1]  and therefore the PCR judge ordered \r\n  that the Department of Mental Health (DMH) conduct a competency evaluation.Â  \r\n\r\nThe DMH doctors diagnosed \r\n  respondent with Schizophrenia, Undifferentiated type. The PCR judge found respondent \r\n  to be incompetent and granted respondentâ€™s motion to indefinitely stay the PCR \r\n  proceedings until respondent regained his competency.\r\nThis Court granted the \r\n  Stateâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari to review the following question:\r\n\r\nDid the PCR judge err in indefinitely \r\n  staying respondentâ€™s PCR proceedings until respondent became mentally competent?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe State asserts that \r\n  the PCR court abused its discretion in granting respondentâ€™s motion to stay \r\n  the PCR proceedings until respondent was deemed competent. \r\n The issue of whether \r\n  a prisoner must be competent to collaterally challenge his conviction is a question \r\n  of first impression in this state.Â  While the State cannot execute an incompetent \r\n  death-sentenced inmate, Singleton v. State, 313 S.C. 75, 437 S.E.2d 53 \r\n  (1993), [2]  and the law prohibits a criminal trial of an \r\n  incompetent defendant, Pate v. Robinson, 383 U.S. 375, 378, 86 S. Ct. \r\n  836, 838, 15 L. Ed. 2d 815 (1966); State v. Bell, 293 S.C. 391, 395-396, \r\n  360 S.E.2d 706 (1987), neither this Court nor the General Assembly has determined \r\n  whether a mentally incompetent prisoner may seek an indefinite stay for his \r\n  PCR proceedings.Â Â  \r\nOrder \r\n  from the PCR Court\r\nIn his Order, the PCR judge set \r\n  forth six reasons for his grant of an indefinite stay.Â  First, this case is \r\n  a capital case, thus, respondent will remain incarcerated for the remainder \r\n  of his life, regardless of the outcome of the PCR proceeding.Â  Second, the issues \r\n  that respondent presented in his PCR petition are extremely fact intensive, \r\n  which will ultimately require respondentâ€™s assistance.Â  Third, even if the court \r\n  continued the proceedings and allowed respondent to submit successive PCRs, \r\n  [3]  federal law would prohibit respondent from filing successive habeas \r\n  corpus petitions in the event a habeas issue is later discovered.Â  28 U.S.C. \r\n  Â§ 2244(b) (West Supp. 2003).Â  Fourth, the Stateâ€™s interests are â€œminimally impairedâ€ \r\n  if the court stays the proceedings, while respondentâ€™s interest in effectively \r\n  presenting his collateral challenge would be â€œseverely impaired.â€Â  Fifth, an \r\n  indefinite stay permits the court to retain jurisdiction so that it may regularly \r\n  evaluate respondentâ€™s mental health and efforts to regain mental competence.Â  \r\n  Sixth, if the court refused to grant the indefinite stay, piecemeal litigation \r\n  would likely ensue once respondent regained his mental competency.Â  \r\nWe find that the trial \r\n  judge erred in staying the proceedings because (1) a PCR proceeding is civil, \r\n  not criminal; (2) the judge incorrectly concluded that, based on two opinions \r\n  from this Court, this Court would rule that incompetent prisoners must regain \r\n  competence before a PCR proceeding is held; and (3) respondentâ€™s grounds for \r\n  relief are not â€œall extraordinarily fact intensiveâ€ and do not warrant the assistance \r\n  of a mentally competent petitioner.Â  We adopt the analysis employed in other \r\n  jurisdictions that allows for PCR proceedings of mentally incompetent petitioners \r\n  to go forward.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nCivil \r\n  Action\r\nA PCR action is a civil action.Â  \r\n  See Wade v. State, 348 S.C. 255, 259, 559 S.E.2d 843, 844 (2002) \r\n  (citing 17 S.C. Jur. Â§ 2 (1993) (â€œState post-conviction relief is a civil action \r\n  by which a person convicted of, or sentenced for, a crime, and who is either \r\n  detained or faces a possibility of detention, institutes a proceeding to challenge \r\n  a court's conviction or sentence on constitutional grounds.â€)).Â  Therefore, \r\n  the constitutional protections that forbid a criminal trial of a mentally incompetent \r\n  defendant do not apply.Â  See Pate, 383 U.S. at 378, 86 S. Ct. \r\n  at 838; Bell, 293 S.C. at 395-396, 360 S.E.2d at 708.Â Â  \r\nMisinterpretation \r\n  of Two S.C. Supreme Court Opinions\r\nRespondentâ€™s brief and the PCR \r\n  judgeâ€™s Order incorrectly presume that this Court has impliedly held that PCR \r\n  proceedings for a mentally incompetent petitioner must be stayed.Â  Respondent \r\n  argues that in Norris v. State, 335 S.C. 30, 515 S.E.2d 523 (1999), this \r\n  Court approved the trial judgeâ€™s finding that a PCR hearing could not proceed \r\n  until the prisoner regained his metal competency.Â  We disagree.Â  The Norris \r\n  Court held that the State is estopped from asserting the statute of limitations \r\n  defense to a subsequent PCR application after it had previously consented to \r\n  a dismissal of the original PCR application and agreed that the petitioner could \r\n  re-file his application.Â  Id. at 33, 515 S.E.2d at 525.Â  The Court specifically \r\n  stated that since the case could be resolved based on principles of equitable \r\n  estoppel, it would not address tolling the statute of limitations for PCR applications \r\n  because of petitionerâ€™s mental incompetency.Â  Id.Â  \r\nRespondent also relies \r\n  on an unpublished opinion to support the proposition that his PCR proceedings \r\n  should be indefinitely stayed.Â  Locklair v. State, No. 2000-MO-138 (S.C. \r\n  Nov. 17, 2000).Â  In Locklair, this Court held, in an unpublished opinion, \r\n  that the State should provide funds for a competency evaluation of an indigent \r\n  petitioner.Â  The Court also held that if the petitioner was deemed competent, \r\n  the PCR hearing would proceed, and if not, the PCR application would be dismissed \r\n  without prejudice to petitionerâ€™s right to re-file once his competency is restored.Â  \r\n  Id.Â  \r\nIn our view, this opinion does \r\n  not impliedly resolve the issue before us today.Â  In Locklair, the petitionerâ€™s \r\n  counsel moved to have his client evaluated because in the weeks leading up to \r\n  the PCR proceeding, petitioner was unable to assist counsel because he was taking \r\n  drugs that were causing memory deficiencies.Â  When petitionerâ€™s counsel moved \r\n  to have a state-funded mental evaluation of his client prior to the PCR hearing, \r\n  the PCR court ordered that the state would not provide funds for the evaluation \r\n  and gave petitionerâ€™s counsel only two options: (1) proceed with the PCR hearing \r\n  without the evaluation or (2) agree to dismiss the petition without prejudice \r\n  subject to the condition that petitioner obtain a competency evaluation at his \r\n  own expense.Â  \r\nWe hold that our resolution of \r\n  Locklair does not stand for the proposition that PCR petitioners must \r\n  be competent in order to proceed with a PCR hearing; rather, we merely held \r\n  that the PCR judge could not deny the petitionerâ€™s right to a state-funded competency \r\n  evaluation prior to his PCR hearing.Â  Further, as an unpublished opinion, Locklair \r\n  has no precedential value.Â  Rule 220(a), SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nNot \r\n  Fact Intensive\r\nWe find that the trial judge erred \r\n  in finding that the issues respondent presented in his PCR application were \r\n  â€œall extraordinarily fact intensiveâ€ \r\n  [4]  that required respondentâ€™s assistance, which he was unable to provide \r\n  given his incompetent state.Â  \r\nThe first issue, involving the \r\n  mitochondrial DNA evidence, does not require respondentâ€™s assistance.Â  In his \r\n  well-written analysis in Council, Justice Burnett addressed respondentâ€™s \r\n  challenge to the submission of the mitochondrial DNA evidence, applying the \r\n  common law factors and South Carolina Rules of Evidence for determining the \r\n  admissibility of scientific evidence and found that the evidence was properly \r\n  admitted.Â  335 S.C. at 17-22, 515 S.E.2d at 516-519; see also State v. Jones, \r\n  273 S.C. 723, 731, 259 S.E.2d 120, 124 (1979) (providing the standard for the \r\n  admissibility of scientific evidence prior to 1990); State v. Ford, 301 \r\n  S.C. 485, 392 S.E.2d 781 (1990) (setting forth the factors for determining the \r\n  admissibility of scientific evidence under the Jones standard). \r\nRespondentâ€™s collateral attack \r\n  on the admission of the mitochondrial DNA evidence in the guilt phase of his \r\n  trial would be based exclusively on the law of evidence and the trial record.Â  \r\n  Therefore, respondentâ€™s assistance would not be required on this issue.Â  Furthermore, \r\n  because the prosecution presented an overwhelming amount of evidence of respondentâ€™s \r\n  guilt, we find that the admission of the DNA evidence did not prejudicially \r\n  influence the trialâ€™s outcome.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, \r\n  104 S. Ct. 2052, 80 L. Ed. 2d 674 (1984). \r\nThe issues of quality and type \r\n  of mitigation evidence are the only issues of merit that respondent raised in \r\n  his PCR application.Â  While it might be theoretically argued that the defendant \r\n  needs to assist his counsel in providing evidence of social history and mental \r\n  competency at the PCR hearing, this form of testimony generally comes from family \r\n  and social history records, from mental health records, and from experts qualified \r\n  to opine that respondent is mentally ill \r\n  [5]  -- the very type of expert testimony that was presented at the \r\n  hearing below.Â  \r\nThe other two collateral challenges, \r\n  voir dire and incompetency, do not require respondentâ€™s assistance.Â  \r\n  A voir dire challenge requires a review of trial counselâ€™s conduct during \r\n  voir dire, which can be found in the trial record, coupled with a presentation \r\n  of legal argument about any racial bias issues that should have been raised.Â  \r\n  These two components of the collateral attack of trial counselâ€™s conduct during \r\n  voir dire do not require respondentâ€™s assistance.Â  \r\nAs for the incompetency issue, \r\n  respondent relied not on his own assistance to his PCR counsel, but on expert \r\n  testimony that he is mentally incompetent based upon a diagnosis of Schizophrenia, \r\n  Undifferentiated type.Â  \r\nThe \r\n  Wisconsin Approach\r\nFinally, given that South Carolina \r\n  law does not provide an approach for determining whether an incompetent petitionerâ€™s \r\n  PCR hearing should proceed, we look to other jurisdictions for guidance.Â  The \r\n  procedure adopted by the Wisconsin Supreme Court allows the PCR proceedings \r\n  of an incompetent petitioner to go forward but permits the petitioner to revisit \r\n  a fact-based collateral attack in a future proceeding:Â Â Â \r\n\r\nPending the determination of competency \r\n  and even after a determination of incompetency, defense counsel should initiate \r\n  or continue [PCR] relief on a defendantâ€™s behalf when any issues rest on the \r\n  circuit court record, do not necessitate the defendantâ€™s assistance or decisionmaking, \r\n  and involve no risk to the defendant.Â  We agree with the parties that requiring \r\n  defense counsel to go forward with [PCR] relief to the extent feasible ensures \r\n  that an alleged incompetent or incompetent defendant will not suffer from the \r\n  delay of meritorious claims . . .\r\n[I]f defense counsel cannot initiate or \r\n  continue [PCR] relief on the defendantâ€™s behalf because issues necessitate defendantâ€™s \r\n  assistance or decisionmaking, defense counsel may request a continuance or enlargement \r\n  of time for filing the necessary notices or motions for [PCR] relief . . .\r\nDefendants who are incompetent at the \r\n  time they seek [PCR] relief should, after regaining competency, be allowed to \r\n  raise issues at a later proceeding that could not have been raised earlier because \r\n  of incompetency.\r\n\r\nState v. Debra A.E., \r\n  523 N.W.2d 727, 735-736 (Wis. 1994).Â  The Pennsylvania Supreme Court agreed \r\n  with the Wisconsin analysis, finding that an incompetent petitioner who is represented \r\n  by counsel and a guardian ad litem would benefit by pursuing meritorious PCR \r\n  claims while they are fresh.Â  Commonwealth v. Haag, 809 A.2d 271 (Pa. \r\n  2002).Â  \r\nWe \r\n  adopt the Wisconsin approach because we agree that a petitionerâ€™s mental incompetency \r\n  does not impede his ability to assert his meritorious PCR claims.Â  Therefore, \r\n  we hold that a petitioner cannot delay his collateral review of his trial proceedings \r\n  due to his incompetency.Â  If, at a future date, the petitioner regains his competency \r\n  and discovers that at his original PCR hearing, his incompetency prevented his \r\n  ability to assist his counsel on a fact-based claim of ineffective assistance \r\n  of counsel, he may then raise that claim in a subsequent proceeding.Â Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nBased \r\n  on the foregoing, we adopt the Wisconsin approach.Â  Under this new approach, \r\n  the default rule is that PCR hearings must proceed even though a petitioner \r\n  is incompetent.Â  For issues requiring the petitionerâ€™s competence to assist \r\n  his PCR counsel, such as a fact-based challenge to his defense counselâ€™s conduct \r\n  at trial, the PCR judge may grant a continuance, staying the review of those \r\n  issues until petitioner regains his competence.Â  All other PCR claims will not \r\n  be subject to a continuance based on a petitionerâ€™s incompetence.Â  \r\nIn the case at hand, we find that respondentâ€™s incompetency \r\n  will not inhibit his PCR challenge, as none of the issues presented for review \r\n  require his competency to assist his counsel.Â  Therefore, we REVERSE \r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s imposition of an indefinite stay of respondentâ€™s PCR proceedings \r\n  and require respondent to proceed with his meritorious challenges at a PCR hearing.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Respondent testified that he believed the murder victim was still \r\n    alive and that he was part of a cult responsible for keeping the earth spinning \r\n    on its axis.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Singleton enunciated the two-part test for determining pre-execution \r\n    incompetency:Â  the first prong examines whether the petitioner understands \r\n    the nature of the proceedings and the reasons for and nature of his punishment; \r\n    and the second prong assesses whether the petitioner can assist counsel in \r\n    his defense.Â  Id. at 79-80, 437 S.E.2d at 55.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Normally, state law procedurally prohibits this \r\n    course of action.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-90, Aice v. State, \r\n    305 S.C. 448, 409 S.E.2d 392 (1991).Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Respondent petitioned for the following grounds \r\n    for relief in his PCR application:\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9(a)Â Â  Applicant was denied the effective assistance \r\n    of counsel guaranteed by the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United \r\n    States Constitution and South Carolina law because counsel requested mitochondrial \r\n    DNA testing prior to trial but failed to retain their own expert to assist \r\n    counsel, which resulted in admission of this type of evidence for the first \r\n    time in a South Carolina court without sufficient guarantee that the underlying \r\n    science was reliable.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9(b)Â Â  Applicant was denied the effective assistance \r\n    of counsel during voir dire and jury selection in violation of South Carolina \r\n    law and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9(c)Â Â  Applicant was denied the effective assistance \r\n    of counsel during the sentencing phase of his trial in violation of South \r\n    Carolina law and the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States \r\n    Constitution.\r\n  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  9(d)Â Â  Applicant may not be executed consistent with \r\n    the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and \r\n    South Carolina law because he is incompetent.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  See Wiggins v.

Thereafter, the Court appointed \r\n  a special referee to take evidence and issue a report containing proposed findings \r\n  and a recommendation. After a hearing, the special referee filed his report \r\n  finding respondent had engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and recommending \r\n  respondent be found in contempt of court. Respondent has filed exceptions to \r\n  the special referee's report.\r\n  \r\nAfter review and consideration of \r\n  the hearing transcript, the special referee's report, respondent's exceptions \r\n  and his motion to dismiss, and the parties' oral arguments, the Court finds \r\n  respondent has engaged in the unauthorized practice of law and holds that respondent \r\n  is guilty of criminal contempt. As fully discussed below, the Court renders \r\n  this conclusion based upon the undisputed testimony and/or exhibits and the \r\n  applicable law.\r\n  \r\nFACTS\r\n  \r\nIn 1978, respondent was disbarred \r\n  from the practice of law.  In the Matter of Clarkson, 271 S.C. 5, 244 S.E.2d \r\n  512 (1978). He has not been reinstated.\r\n  \r\nRespondent is the executive director \r\n  of the Patriot Network and he admits he is responsible for the content of materials \r\n  which are placed on the Patriot Network website. The website has referred to \r\n  respondent as an &quot;attorney&quot; or &quot;lawyer.&quot; Respondent has \r\n  produced publications in which he refers to himself as an &quot;attorney and \r\n  tax procedure expert,&quot; &quot;a tax procedure lawyer,&quot; or &quot;a constitutional \r\n  attorney, an expert on tax procedural law . . .&quot;. Respondent agrees that \r\n  use of the terms &quot;attorney&quot; or &quot;lawyer&quot; to describe himself \r\n  is improper, however, he testified &quot;[w]hat I normally say is I graduated \r\n  from law school and let people draw their own conclusions.&quot;\r\n  \r\nIn at least one of respondent's brochures, \r\n  &quot;Removing Tax Liens and Levies, A Clarkson Report,&quot; respondent invites \r\n  readers to &quot;call&quot; him and &quot;follow [his] advice,&quot; and he \r\n  offers alternatives and recommendations for handling tax liens. The Patriot \r\n  Network provides members with access to the Patriot Advisory Service, &quot;an \r\n  advisory, consulting service whereby subscribers can call [respondent] and other \r\n  knowledgeable experts. . .&quot;. The Patriot Advisory Service states &quot;[a]dvice \r\n  will mainly cover subjects as . . . FOIA-Privacy Act, . . . , Summons, . . . \r\n  , civil right [sic] suits (Section 1984), Privacy Act Suits for damages, . . \r\n  ., illegal disclosure suits, etc.&quot;\r\n  \r\nThe Patriot Network website contains \r\n  legal forms, often with accompanying instructions and/or advice. For example, \r\n  respondent authors pages entitled &quot;How to Draft Interrogatories,&quot; \r\n  &quot;How to Serve FOIA-PA suits,&quot; and &quot;Interrogatories Explained&quot; \r\n  in which he discusses the benefits of interrogatories over other discovery methods.\r\n  \r\nA witness for respondent testified \r\n  respondent has helped others submit documents in court. The witness stated, \r\n  &quot;strictly on an advisory basis based on his training as an attorney and \r\n  his experience while he was still a practicing attorney, [respondent] makes \r\n  suggestions and gives advice as to how [others] might proceed in court, in as \r\n  far as filings, pleadings, memos, that kind of things are concerned.&quot;\r\n  \r\nRespondent denied preparing legal \r\n  documents for other people. He testified, however, if someone contacted him \r\n  with regard to a legal problem, he would provide the appropriate legal document \r\n  and would explain &quot;why to use [the legal form], the law behind it, and \r\n  what to write.&quot;\r\n  \r\nRespondent testified he assisted \r\n  a Patriot Network member with an information summons as part of a tax audit. \r\n  He stated that, in September 2002, he advised the member to file a motion to \r\n  quash in federal court and then extensively instructed the member after the \r\n  motion was filed. Respondent \r\n  admitted dictating pleadings which were filed by the Patriot Network member \r\n  and sitting at counsel's table during the court hearing.\r\n  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA. Unauthorized \r\n  Practice of Law \r\nThe South Carolina Supreme Court \r\n  has the authority to regulate the practice of law in this State. S.C. Const. \r\n  art. V, &sect; 4. This Court had held that the practice of law: \r\n\r\n  . . . is not limited to the conduct \r\n    of cases in courts. According to the generally understood definition of the \r\n    practice of law in this country, it embraces the preparation of pleadings, \r\n    and other papers incident to actions and special proceedings, and the management \r\n    of such actions and proceedings on behalf of clients before judges and courts, \r\n    and in addition, conveyancing, the preparation of legal instruments of all \r\n    kinds and, in general, all advice to clients, and all action taken for them \r\n    in matters connected with the law. An attorney at law is one who engages in \r\n    any of these branches of the practice of law. \r\n\r\nIn re Duncan, 83 S.C. 186, 189, 65 \r\n  S.E. 210, 211 (1909). \r\nApplying this definition, the Court \r\n  has held preparation of a deed or other legal documents for another individual \r\n  by one who is not a licensed attorney constitutes the unauthorized practice \r\n  of law.  State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 460 S.E.2d 576 (1995);  In re\r\nEasler, \r\n  75 S.C. 400, 272 S.E.2d 32 (1980). While the sale or lease of blank legal forms \r\n  does not constitute the practice of law, instructing others in the manner in \r\n  which to prepare and execute blank documents is the practice of law.  State v. \r\n  Despain, supra. The practice of law also includes the preparation of pleadings \r\n  and the management of court proceedings on behalf of clients.  Housing Authority \r\n  of City of Charleston v. Key, 352 S.C. 26, 572 S.E.2d 284 (2002).\r\n  \r\nRespondent has engaged in the unauthorized \r\n  practice of law. He held himself out as a lawyer on a website for which he admits \r\n  responsibility and he has published materials in which he states he is an attorney. \r\n  Moreover, respondent has provided advice on selection of legal forms and how \r\n  to complete the forms. Respondent has drafted pleadings and, on at least one \r\n  occasion, managed court proceedings on behalf of another individual. All of \r\n  this conduct has previously been defined as the practice of law by this Court.\r\n  \r\nB. Contempt of \r\n  Court\r\n  \r\n&quot;Willful disobedience of an \r\n  Order of the Court may result in contempt.&quot;  Spartanburg County Dept. of \r\n  Social Servs. v. Padgett, 296 S.C. 79, 82, 370 S.E.2d 872, 874 (1988). &quot;A \r\n  willful act is defined as one 'done voluntarily and intentionally with the specific \r\n  intent to do something the law forbids, or with the specific intent to fail \r\n  to do something the law requires to be done: that is to say, with bad purpose \r\n  either to disobey or disregard the law.&quot;  Id. at 82-3, 370 S.E.2d at 874. \r\n  &quot;Contemptuous behavior is conduct that tends to bring the authority and \r\n  administration of the law into disrespect.&quot;  Ex parte Stone v. Reddix-Smalls, \r\n  295 S.C. 514, 516, 369 S.E.2d 840 (1980). Contemptuous intent is subjective \r\n  rather than objective.  State v. Bowers, 270 S.C. 124, 241 S.E.2d 409 (1978).\r\n  \r\nRespondent's conduct, practicing \r\n  law without a license, was clearly willful. It is undisputed respondent knew \r\n  he had been disbarred from the practice of law. In spite of this knowledge, \r\n  respondent nevertheless identified himself as an attorney or, at minimum, stated \r\n  he graduated from law school and &quot;let people draw their own conclusions \r\n  . . . .&quot;. Respondent willfully managed court proceedings for at least one \r\n  individual, drafted pleadings, and provided instructions and advice to individuals \r\n  in completing legal forms. Respondent's behavior demonstrates a clear disrespect \r\n  for this Court, its orders, and the practice of law and, beyond a reasonable \r\n  doubt, is contemptuous. Accordingly, we hold respondent in criminal contempt.\r\n  \r\nWe hereby sentence respondent to \r\n  imprisonment for a term of six (6) months, suspended for a period of five (5) \r\n  years upon the following three conditions: 1) within thirty (30) days of the \r\n  date of this order, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel shall \r\n  submit to this Court an agreed-upon disclaimer which states respondent is not \r\n  an attorney and is not licensed to practice law in South Carolina or in any \r\n  other state; 2) within sixty (60) days of the date of this order, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit averring the disclaimer has been prominently and permanently \r\n  placed on any and all of his websites, including the Patriot Network website, \r\n  and on all literature authored and/or published by respondent; and 3) that respondent \r\n  no longer engage in the unauthorized practice of law.1&nbsp;\r\nFailure to comply with \r\n  the conditions imposed by this order shall result in respondent's arrest and \r\n  immediate incarceration.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED. \r\n\r\n   \r\n     \r\n     \r\n      s/Jean H.

Richardson, Jr., Susan M. Johnston, and Michael S. Pauley, all of \r\n  Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nLyndon B. Jones, pro se, of Brooklyn, New York.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This attorney disciplinary matter consolidates three matters.Â  \r\n  After a hearing, at which Respondent did not appear, the full panel recommended \r\n  Respondent be disbarred.Â  We instead suspend the Respondent from the practice \r\n  of law in this State for one year.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent was placed on interim suspension on January 16, 2002, and formal \r\n  charges were filed in these matters on July 22, 2002.Â  Respondent did not file \r\n  an Answer and was held in default by the subpanel of the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct.Â  Pursuant to the Default Order, the factual allegations in the Formal \r\n  Charges are deemed admitted by Respondent.Â  Rule 24, of the Rules of Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp; \r\nFACTS\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent was properly served with both the Notice \r\n  of Hearing and the Order of Default.Â  The subpanel found the following matters \r\n  constituted misconduct and warrant disciplinary action: \r\nA.Â  The Allen Matter\r\nRespondent represented \r\n  Complainant at his criminal trial, where Complainant was convicted and sentenced \r\n  to prison.Â  Respondent filed a Notice of Appeal on Complainantâ€™s behalf with \r\n  the Court of Appeals.Â  A lawyer from the South Carolina Office of Appellate \r\n  Defense (Appellate Defense) attempted to contact Respondent by telephone regarding \r\n  Respondentâ€™s status as Complainantâ€™s attorney.Â  Respondent did not return the \r\n  call.Â  Appellate Defense sent Respondent a letter asking Respondent if he were \r\n  retained or court-appointed and offering to take over the appeal upon Respondentâ€™s \r\n  request if Respondent were court-appointed.Â  Respondent failed to respond to \r\n  the letter.Â  Once again, a representative from Appellate Defense called Respondent, \r\n  but Respondent failed to return the phone call.Â  \r\nRespondent failed to perfect Complainantâ€™s appeal and failed to communicate \r\n  with Complainant regarding the status of the appeal.Â  Respondent also failed \r\n  to respond to inquiries, letters, and telephone calls from Complainant and his \r\n  family members.Â  Complainantâ€™s appeal was dismissed.\r\nB. Â Â Â Â  The Brown Matter\r\nComplainant retained \r\n  Respondent for a fee of $500 to obtain a divorce for her on the grounds of spousal \r\n  abuse.Â  Respondent instructed Complainant to pay half of her legal fee prior \r\n  to the filing of pleadings and to pay the balance on the day of the hearing.Â  \r\n  Complainant paid Respondent $300 toward the full fee.\r\nRespondent took no action on behalf of Complainant.Â  Respondent represented \r\n  to Complainant that he had filed the appropriate pleadings. However, he did \r\n  not provide Complainant with copies, and Complainant verified with the Family \r\n  Court that nothing had been filed on her behalf, other than a restraining order \r\n  against Complainantâ€™s husband.Â  \r\nRespondent did not respond to Complainantâ€™s phone calls made to the \r\n  law firm where he was previously employed.Â  When Complainant learned that Respondent \r\n  was no longer employed with the firm, she tried contacting him at his home and \r\n  through an answering service.Â  He did not respond.Â  \r\nC.Â Â Â Â Â  Â  Cooperation with Disciplinary Authorityâ€™s Investigation\r\nRespondent failed to \r\n  update or notify the South Carolina Bar of Respondentâ€™s change in address and \r\n  employment.Â  The Attorney to Assist Disciplinary Counsel wrote Respondent two \r\n  letters asking Respondent to cooperate in the preliminary investigation and \r\n  to respond to lawful requests for information.Â  The Attorney to Assist also \r\n  called Respondent numerous times.Â  Respondent did not respond to any of the \r\n  inquiries or otherwise cooperate with the investigation.Â  \r\nRespondent was required to appear before Disciplinary Counsel pursuant \r\n  to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE.Â  Respondent had informed the South Carolina State Bar, \r\n  when he was admitted, that he was also admitted to the New York State Bar.Â  \r\n  At Respondentâ€™s appearance, Respondent represented under oath that he was not \r\n  a licensed member of the New York State Bar. At the time, Respondent was admitted \r\n  and registered as an attorney in good standing with the New York State Bar.Â  \r\n  Respondentâ€™s representations under oath were deliberately misleading and/or \r\n  were conscious misrepresentations of the facts.Â  \r\nRespondent was advised during his appearance before Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel that the appearance was continued pending Respondentâ€™s compliance with \r\n  the subpoena. The subpoena required RespondentÂ  to provide complete trust records \r\n  for all trust and escrow accounts utilized in Respondentâ€™s practice of law from \r\n  1999 until the present.Â  Respondent failed to provide records for the years \r\n  of 2000 and 2001.Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel and agents of SLED attempted, \r\n  unsuccessfully, to contact Respondent numerous times. \r\nFINDINGS\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of \r\n  Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees); \r\n  Rule 3.2 (Expedite Litigation); Rule 3.3 (Candor Toward a Tribunal); Rule 3.4 \r\n  (Fairness to Opposing Party and Counsel); Rule 4.1 (Truthfulness in Statements \r\n  to Others); Rule 8.1 (Cooperation with Disciplinary Authority); Rule 8.4(a) \r\n  (Violate Rules of Professional Conduct): Rule 8.4(d) (Conduct Involving Dishonesty); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice).Â  Respondent \r\n  also violated Rules 7(a)(1), (3), (5), (6), and (7) of RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, \r\n  as well as Rule 402(g), SCACR.Â  The rule violations are deemed admitted by virtue \r\n  of Respondentâ€™s default to the Formal Charges.Â  Rule 24, RLDE, supra.Â  \r\n\r\nThe only issue before the subpanel was an appropriate sanction.Â  \r\n  The subpanel recommended that Respondent be disbarred.Â  The full panel accepted \r\n  the subpanelâ€™s recommendation as its own.Â  The recommendation and its acceptance \r\n  appear, understandably, to have been significantly influenced by Respondentâ€™s \r\n  default.Â  Respondent appeared in mitigation at oral argument and expressed contrition. \r\n\r\nÂ Â CONCLUSION \r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline is \r\n  given rests entirely with the Supreme Court.Â  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law and is not bound by the full panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  In re Larkin, \r\n  336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  The Court must administer the sanction \r\n  it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWhile Respondentâ€™s delicts were serious, we find that disbarment \r\n  is not the appropriate sanction.Â  Respondent is suspended from the practice \r\n  of law in this State for one year.Â  Respondent must pay, within 90 days, the \r\n  costs in this matter totaling $655.30, as well as reimburse Ms. Brown $300 for \r\n  the retainer paid by her.Â  In order to be reinstated, Respondent must comply \r\n  with the requirements of Rule 33(f), RLDE of Rule 413, SCACR, and may petition \r\n  at the earliest not sooner than 270 days prior to the expiration of the period \r\n  of suspension.Â  \r\nWithin fifteen days of the \r\n  date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25835","title":"Anne Parker v.

Parker appeals the \r\n  master-in-equityâ€™s findings on remand concerning, among other things, calculation \r\n  of damages for ouster and attorneyâ€™s fees and interest awards.Â  This appeal \r\n  was certified from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We \r\n  affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural \r\n  Background\r\nSince 1995, Anne S. Parker (Anne) and \r\n  her brothers, Marion A. Shecut, III (Bo) and Winfield W. Shecut (Win), have \r\n  been involved in litigation concerning property bequeathed to them by their \r\n  mother.Â  The litigation began when Anne sued her brothers, seeking to partition \r\n  the estate according to the terms of their motherâ€™s willâ€”which directed that \r\n  the 1.2 million dollar estate be divided equallyâ€”rather than by the terms of \r\n  a private agreement (agreement) signed by the siblings a year after their motherâ€™s \r\n  death.Â  \r\nUnder the agreement and its addendum, Win received \r\n  a house in Orangeburg, several tracts of farmland, a portion of a tract of farmland \r\n  known as Cope property (which included a six-acre pond), and farming equipment.Â  \r\n  Anne and Bo jointly received the remaining farmland on the Cope property (including \r\n  a two-thirds share of the pond), commercial property, a residential lot, and \r\n  a beach house in Edisto.Â  To manage their jointly owned properties, Anne and \r\n  Bo formed a partnership called Shecut Investments.Â  Shortly after they formed \r\n  the partnership, Anne and Bo began to disagree about how the property should \r\n  be managed.Â  As a result, Anne brought the underlying partition action, seeking \r\n  to repudiate the agreement.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe master-in-equity conducted two sets of hearings.Â  \r\n  The first set of hearings centered on whether the agreement signed by the siblings \r\n  was valid. After the hearing, the master issued an order dated July 10, 1997, \r\n  (1) finding that the agreement was valid and ordering its specific performance; \r\n  (2) ordering Anne to pay Win $30,377 in actual damages for breaching the agreement; \r\n  (3) ordering Anne to pay Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees; and (4) dismissing the action \r\n  as to Win.Â  Anne immediately appealed, but the appeal was held in abeyance until \r\n  the master ruled on the remaining issues.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe second set of hearings primarily focused on \r\n  the partitioning of the properties jointly owned by Anne and Bo.Â  In his second \r\n  order, dated February 17, 1998, the master (1) partitioned all property jointly \r\n  owned by Anne and Bo, excepting the Edisto beach house, which was ordered to \r\n  be sold; (2) found that Bo was justified in changing the locks to the beach \r\n  house when he suspected that Anne had vandalized it; (3) awarded Win $23,699.37 \r\n  in attorneyâ€™s fees to be paid from Anneâ€™s share of the beach-house-sale proceeds; \r\n  (4) directed that Anneâ€™s and Boâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees be paid from the beach-house-sale \r\n  proceeds; and (5) awarded Bo $30,000 in actual damages, to be paid by Anne, \r\n  for a lost business opportunity.Â  Anne appealed.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals (1) affirmed the masterâ€™s \r\n  finding that the agreement was valid; (2) affirmed the award of attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  to the brothers, with Winâ€™s to be paid from Anneâ€™s share of the beach-house-sale \r\n  proceeds; (3) affirmed the masterâ€™s finding that Anne was not ousted or excluded \r\n  from using the beach house; (4) reversed the award of $30,377 in actual damages \r\n  to Win for breach of contract; (5) reversed the award of $30,000 to Bo for a \r\n  lost business opportunity; and (6) remanded the issue of whether Anne maintained \r\n  an interest in the Cope property pond. \r\nBefore the matter was considered on remand, this \r\n  Court granted certiorari to review one issue:Â  whether the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred in finding that Anne failed to show ouster.Â  Parker v. Shecut, \r\n  349 S.C. 226, 562 S.E.2d 620 (2002).Â  This Court reversed the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  decision on the ouster issue and held that Bo ousted Anne from the Edisto beach \r\n  house.Â  Consequently, the case was remanded, and the lower court was instructed \r\n  to (1) determine the amount of damages, if any, due Anne for ouster and (2) \r\n  proceed with the sale of the beach house.&nbsp;&nbsp;Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nFinally, on remand, the master considered issues \r\n  from this Court, the Court of Appeals, and those consented to by the parties.Â  \r\n  The following findings are relevant to the present appeal: (1) the beach house \r\n  was sold for $785,000, and the proceeds are being held by the court until this \r\n  appeal is resolved; (2) Bo owes Anne $16,995 in damages for ouster; (3) Anne \r\n  no longer owns a portion of the pond on the Cope property; (4) Winâ€™s request \r\n  for appellate attorneyâ€™s fees, plus interest, is granted; (5) Anne and Bo are \r\n  equally responsible for the escrow agentâ€™s fees; (6) Anneâ€™s and Boâ€™s requests \r\n  for appellate attorneyâ€™s fees are denied.\r\nAnne raises the following issues on appeal:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;\r\n        Did the master err in his calculation of ouster damages?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in updating the escrow accounting?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in finding that Anne no longer owned the pond?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         IV.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in awarding appellate attorneyâ€™s fees to Win?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         V.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in awarding interest on Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         VI.\r\n         \r\n  Did the master err in failing to order that money judgments for Anne be paid \r\n  from the beach-house-sale proceeds?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         VII.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n        Did the master err in ordering Anne to pay half of her attorneyâ€™s fees, half \r\n  of Boâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, half of the escrow agentâ€™s fees, and half of the costs \r\n  of an appraisal?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;Law/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nWhen reviewing an equitable action, this \r\n  Court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of \r\n  the evidence.Â  Anderson v. Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 113, 382 S.E.2d 897, \r\n  899 (1989). \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Ouster Damages\r\nAnne argues that the master erred in his calculation \r\n  of ouster damages.Â  She argues that the damages should have been calculated \r\n  using the rental value of the beach house without adjustment for expenses.Â  \r\n  She also argues she is entitled to treble damages.Â  We disagree with both arguments.\r\nThis Court defined â€œousterâ€ as â€œthe actual turning \r\n  out or keeping excluded a party entitled to possession of any real property.â€ \r\n  Parker v. Shecut, 349 S.C. 226, 230, 562 S.E.2d 620, 622 (2002) (citation \r\n  omitted).Â  â€œOusterâ€ may occur when there is â€œa possession attended with such \r\n  circumstances as to evince a claim of exclusive right and title and a denial \r\n  of a right of the other tenants to participate in the profits.â€ Id. \r\n  (emphasis added) (citing Woods v. Bivens, 292 S.C. 76, 80, 354 S.E.2d \r\n  909, 912 (1987)).Â  The ousting co-tenant â€œis liable as a trespasser for the \r\n  rental value of the property beyond his ownership share.â€ Id. at 230, \r\n  562 S.E.2d at 623 (citing Jones v. Massey, 14 S.C. 292, 307-08 (1880)).Â  \r\n\r\nIn the present case, the master awarded Anne $16,995 \r\n  in damages for Boâ€™s ouster between June 13, 1997 and August 5, 2002.Â  To calculate \r\n  the damages, the master reviewed the gross rental values of the property between \r\n  1993 and 1995, which were as follows: $8,497 (1993); $18,181 (1994); and $19,841 \r\n  (1995).Â  The master took the highest, most recent value of $19,841 and subtracted \r\n  $13,222 in allowable, out-of-pocket expenses, [1]  leaving an annual rental value of $6,619.Â  \r\n  As a result, Anneâ€™s one-half share of the rental value was $3,310 per year, \r\n  totaling $16,995 over the five-year ouster period. \r\nWe hold that the master properly calculated the \r\n  ouster damages.Â  This Court held that Bo was liable â€œfor the rental value of \r\n  the property beyond his ownership share.â€Â  Parker, 349 S.C. at 230, 562 \r\n  S.E.2d at 623.Â  In addition, this Court explained that â€œousterâ€ involves a denial \r\n  of a right to participate in the profits of the property.Â  Id. \r\n  at 230, 562 S.E.2d at 622.Â  Had Bo and Anne continued to maintain the beach \r\n  house as a rental property, Anne would not have pocketed the gross rental value \r\n  of the property; instead, as a co-tenant, Anne would have had to pay her share \r\n  of the expenses.Â  Therefore, by awarding Anne the rental value of the property \r\n  less allowable expenses, the master properly calculated the ouster damages.Â Â  \r\n\r\nAnne also argues that she is entitled to treble \r\n  damages under S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-67-410 and 15-67-420 (1976). We disagree.Â  \r\n  These statutes apply in circumstances in which one has forcibly entered and \r\n  â€œdisseizedâ€ property. In its prior opinion, this Court held that Bo was to be \r\n  treated as a trespasser, liable for the rental value of the property beyond \r\n  his ownership share, not as one who has forcibly entered and â€œdisseizedâ€ property.Â  \r\n  Therefore, these statutes do not apply to the facts in this case, and Anne is \r\n  not entitled to treble damages.Â  See Du Pre v. Tilghman Lumber Co., 114 \r\n  S.C. 269, 272, 103 S.E. 526, 527 (1920) (holding trespass not sufficient to \r\n  sustain an action for forcible entry and detainer).Â  \r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Escrow Accounting\r\nAnne argues that the master erred in updating the escrow \r\n  accounting by failing to include certain bartered and paid rents.Â  We disagree.\r\nSince November 12, 1997, Carole Gunter (Gunter) has been \r\n  the escrow agent for the Shecut family.Â  Her primary responsibility as the escrow \r\n  agent has been to manage all Shecut properties, including collecting rents, \r\n  paying taxes, and renewing insurance policies.Â  At the hearing on remand, Gunter \r\n  submitted a detailed report documenting all money received and paid during her \r\n  term.Â  The master instructed Gunter to review her accounting once again, ensuring \r\n  that all rents and expenses related to property owned by Anne and Bo (as Shecut \r\n  Investments) were allocated equally.Â  Income generated and expenses incurred \r\n  after the property was partitioned were to be treated individually, based on \r\n  who owned the property.Â  After reviewing the accounting as instructed, Gunter \r\n  submitted a revised report to the court.Â  \r\nThe master relied on Gunterâ€™s revised report in his decision, \r\n  a decision that ultimately benefited Anne.Â  The report showed that Bo owed Anne \r\n  $5,609.77, Win owed Anne $4,694.39, and the escrow balance was $845.77.Â  In \r\n  the final calculation, Anne was awarded $18,949.44, which included the amounts \r\n  owed by Bo and Win, the escrow balance, and amounts owed to Anne in the courtâ€™s \r\n  prior order.Â  Of the total amount due Anne, $13,409.28 was to be paid by Bo \r\n  and specifically accounted for bartered and paid rents.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nBecause the masterâ€™s order took into consideration money \r\n  due Anne for bartered and paid rents, we find that the master did not err in \r\n  his final accounting.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  \r\n  Pond\r\nAnne argues that the master erred in finding that Anne no \r\n  longer owned a share of the six-acre pond located on the Cope property.Â  This \r\n  argument is based on the fact that the master did not specifically mention the \r\n  pond in his February 17, 1998 order, which simply partitioned the â€œCope property.â€Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOriginally, in their private agreement, the siblings decided \r\n  that the pond would â€œbe kept in good condition and maintained as a pond for \r\n  the mutual use and enjoyment of all parties of this agreement.â€ But in the partition \r\n  action, the portion of the pond owned jointly by Anne and Bo was allotted to \r\n  Bo.Â  The Court of Appeals subsequently found that this division deprived Anne \r\n  of her agreed interest in the pond because the master relied on an incorrect \r\n  property survey.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals remanded the issue.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nOn remand, the master explained that â€œthe value of the pond \r\n  was considered by the Court when Bo and Anne partitioned the joint property \r\n  under the Agreement.â€Â  He cited the appraisal and testimony of Chuck Henson \r\n  (Henson) as support for his decision in the partition action.Â  Anne called Henson \r\n  to testify on remand, and Henson confirmed that the value of the pond was $2,000 \r\n  per acre.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nGiven that Hensonâ€™s appraisal report was part of the record \r\n  in the partition action; the master stated that he relied on this report in \r\n  partitioning the â€œCope propertyâ€; and the master heard testimony from Henson \r\n  on remand confirming the pondâ€™s value, it is clear that the pond was fully considered \r\n  in the partitioning of the jointly owned property and upon remand.\r\nTherefore, the master properly found that Anneâ€™s interest \r\n  in the pond had been allotted to Bo, she received fair value for the pond, and \r\n  she no longer has an interest in or rights associated with the pond.\r\nIV.Â Â Â  Winâ€™s Appellate \r\n  Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nAnne argues that the master erred in awarding Win appellate \r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees because Win was no longer a party to the action after all claims \r\n  against him were dismissed in the initial, July 10, 1997 order.Â  As a result, \r\n  Anne argues, the court lacked jurisdiction to decide the issue of Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees in the subsequent proceedings.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhen the Supreme Court remits a case to the circuit court, \r\n  the circuit court â€œacquires jurisdiction to enforce the judgment and take any \r\n  action consistent with the Supreme Court ruling.â€Â  Muller v. Myrtle Beach \r\n  Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 313 S.C. 413, 414-15, 438 S.E.2d 248, 249 (1993).Â  \r\n  Additionally, whether respondents are entitled to appellate attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  pursuant to a statute [2]  is \r\n  a determination for the circuit court.Â  Taylor v. Medenica, 332 S.C. \r\n  324, 326, 504 S.E.2d 590, 591 (1998).Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, Winâ€™s involvement in the proceedings \r\n  did not cease upon the issuance of the July 10, 1997 order.Â  Win remained a \r\n  named defendant and participant during the second set of hearings.Â  In fact, \r\n  the master specifically addressed the issue of Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees in the \r\n  February 17, 1998 order.\r\nBecause Anne appealed the findings of both orders, Win continued \r\n  to participate in the case as a named respondent whose interests could be affected \r\n  by the appellate courtâ€™s decision.Â  Moreover, the Court of Appeals remanded \r\n  the pond issueâ€”a pond that was partly owned by Winâ€”which forced Win to remain \r\n  involved in the litigation on remand.Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, we hold that the master properly considered the \r\n  issue of Winâ€™s appellate attorneyâ€™s fees, and it was within the masterâ€™s discretion \r\n  to award the fees accordingly.Â Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Interest on Winâ€™s Attorneyâ€™s Fees\r\nAnne argues that the master erred in awarding post-judgment \r\n  interest on Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  She argues that because the fees were to \r\n  be paid from the beach-house-sale proceeds, interest should not have accrued \r\n  until the beach house was sold.Â  We disagree.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 34-31-20(B) (1976 as amended) provides that \r\n  â€œ[a]ll money decrees and judgments of court enrolled or entered shall draw interest \r\n  according to law.â€Â  A party need not plead for such interest; it is due as a \r\n  matter of course.Â  Calhoun v. Calhoun, 339 S.C. 96, 102, 529 S.E.2d 14, \r\n  17 (2000).Â  An award of attorneyâ€™s fees may be considered part of a monetary \r\n  judgment and draw interest accordingly.Â  Christy v. Christy, 317 S.C. \r\n  145, 152, 452 S.E.2d 1, 5 (Ct. App. 1994).\r\nIn the present case, Win was awarded $14,162.49 in interest.Â  \r\n  The master calculated interest due from February 17, 1998, the date that (1) \r\n  the beach house was ordered to be sold, and (2) Win was awarded attorneyâ€™s fees \r\n  in the amount of $23,699.37 to be paid from Anneâ€™s share of the beach-house-sale \r\n  proceeds. \r\nAnne did not pay the fees and now claims that the interest, \r\n  if any, should be calculated from August 20, 2002â€”the date the beach house was \r\n  soldâ€”since that is the date the proceeds became available.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs this Court noted in its decision, nothing prevented Anne \r\n  or Bo from proceeding with the sale of the beach house according to the masterâ€™s \r\n  instructions in the February 17, 1998 order.Â  Further, this Court stated, â€œthe \r\n  sale should have proceeded.â€Â  \r\nAnne could have expedited the availability of the proceeds \r\n  by proceeding with the beach house sale as directed, giving her the means to \r\n  pay Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The awarding of attorneyâ€™s fees to Win was a judgment \r\n  against Anne, and she failed to take any action to abate the running of the \r\n  interest.Â  Given that the underlying case and the subsequent appeals dealt primarily \r\n  with disputes between Bo and Anne, with Win having a passive role in most of \r\n  the litigation, we find that it was equitable for the master to award interest \r\n  on Winâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees only.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nVI.Â Â Â  \r\n  Money Judgments for Anne\r\nOn remand, the master specifically ordered that awards payable \r\n  to Bo, Win, and their respective attorneys be paid from the beach-house-sale \r\n  proceeds.Â  But the master did not specify the source of money judgments due \r\n  Anne.Â  Anne argues that her awards should also come from the proceeds of the \r\n  beach house sale so that the awards will be legally enforceable.Â  We disagree.\r\nAnneâ€™s concern is that she will have to continue the present \r\n  litigation to enforce judgments in her favor.Â  This argument is without merit.Â  \r\n  There is no indication in the record that either Win or Bo has interfered with \r\n  Anneâ€™s receipt of payments due her.Â  The force of the judgment itself should \r\n  ensure that Anne collects.\r\nTherefore, Anne is not entitled to alter the judgment so \r\n  as to provide additional assurance that she will receive the money judgments.Â Â Â Â \r\nVII.Â Â  Fees and \r\n  Costs\r\nThe master ordered that the following fees and costs be paid \r\n  from the beach-house-sale proceeds:Â  Anneâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees, Boâ€™s attorneyâ€™s \r\n  fees, the escrow agentâ€™s fees, and the cost of an appraisal.Â  Since the proceeds \r\n  from the beach house sale are to be divided equally, the masterâ€™s order essentially \r\n  requires Anne to pay half of these fees and costs.Â  Anne argues that this was \r\n  error and that Bo should be required to pay all fees and costs since â€œBoâ€™s wrongdoings \r\n  have put the trial court and the parties to much legal effort and increased \r\n  costs.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nAs to the attorneyâ€™s fees, it was within the masterâ€™s discretion \r\n  to order that attorneyâ€™s fees be paid from the beach-house-sale proceeds and \r\n  therefore be shared equally.Â  The record does not indicate that either party \r\n  was more at fault than the other such that one party should have been required \r\n  to pay the attorneyâ€™s fees for both parties.Â  We also note that Anne actually \r\n  benefited from the masterâ€™s order since her attorneyâ€™s fees ($13,173.80) were \r\n  higher than Boâ€™s ($7,999.00), and Bo had to pay half of Anneâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  \r\n\r\nAs to the escrow agentâ€™s fees, the escrow agent was appointed \r\n  for the benefit of all parties to the litigation, including Anne.Â  Further, \r\n  the escrow agentâ€™s responsibilities largely centered on managing the properties \r\n  owned jointly by Anne and Bo.\r\nThe appraisal cost of $2,000 stems from the appraisal of \r\n  one of Anneâ€™s properties.Â  The escrow agent ordered the appraisal to determine \r\n  whether the property should be sold so that its proceeds could be deposited \r\n  into the diminishing escrow account.Â  This was within the escrow agentâ€™s discretion, \r\n  and ultimately, the decision benefited Anne:Â  Anne owned the property that was \r\n  appraised and used the appraisal report when the property was sold.Â  \r\nAnne has been an active participant throughout this near \r\n  decade-long litigation.Â  Therefore, it was equitable for the master to order \r\n  Anne to pay her share of the fees and costs.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we AFFIRM the master-in-equityâ€™s \r\n  findings.\r\nWALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice Paula H. Thomas, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Allowable expenses included rental commissions, utilities, cleaning \r\n    services, owner repairs, agency repairs, and taxes. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The applicable statute in this case states: â€œ[t]he \r\n    court of common pleas may fix attorneysâ€™ fees in all partition proceedings \r\n    and, as may be equitable, assess such fees against any or all of the parties \r\n    in interest.â€Â  S.C.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, \r\n  and Barbara M. Seymour, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for \r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nThomas C. Brittain, of Myrtle Beach, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This attorney disciplinary matter \r\n  consolidates multiple matters.Â  After a hearing, the subpanel recommended Respondent \r\n  be disbarred.Â  We agree with the subpanel, and disbar Respondent from the practice \r\n  of law in this State.\r\nPROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nRespondent was placed on interim suspension on June \r\n  27, 2002, and Formal Charges were filed on May 20, 2003.Â  Respondent did not \r\n  file an answer, and was held in default by consent order dated July 1, 2003.Â  \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 24(a) of Rule 413, SCACR, the factual allegations in the Formal \r\n  Charges are deemed admitted by Respondent.\r\nThere are multiple matters, which were \r\n  consolidated for hearing purposes by the subpanel.Â  The following matters involving \r\n  misconduct are before this Court: \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Real Estate Matter A\r\nA married couple owned a condominium \r\n  as tenants in common in Horry County.Â  The husband died in December 1997, leaving \r\n  his wife as his only heir.Â  No documents were filed in Horry County to effectuate \r\n  the transfer of husbandâ€™s half interest in the condominium to the wife. \r\n On July 6, 1998, Respondent closed on \r\n  the sale of the condominium without discovering or correcting the title defect.Â  \r\n  Respondent also failed to discover an outstanding tax lien on the property.Â  \r\n  The deed, which was filed on July 7, 1998, contained an erroneous property description \r\n  and an incorrect date.\r\nSome time shortly after the closing, \r\n  a nonlawyer assistant in Respondentâ€™s office discovered the error in the property \r\n  description.Â  The assistant prepared a corrective deed showing the correct property \r\n  description.Â  The assistant had the corrected deed executed and filed without \r\n  consulting Respondent.Â  The corrective deed contained a number of errors, including \r\n  the lack of a date for the execution of the corrective deed, incorrect recording \r\n  and execution dates of the original deed, and an incorrect reference number.\r\nIn January 2001, Respondent attempted \r\n  to clear the title.Â  His nonlawyer assistant prepared a second corrective deed, \r\n  which contained some of the same errors as the first corrective deed, and omitted \r\n  any reference to the first corrective deed.Â  The second corrective deed was \r\n  prepared at the direction of Respondent, but without his review or supervision.\r\nThe subpanel found Respondent violated \r\n  the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 \r\n  (Competence); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); Rule 5.3 (Responsibilities Regarding Nonlawyer \r\n  Assistants); and Rule 5.5 (Unauthorized Practice of Law). \r\nThe subpanel also found that Respondent failed to fully cooperate \r\n  with Disciplinary Counselâ€™s investigation, in violation of Rule 8.1 of the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct because Respondent failed to respond to the written \r\n  Notice of Full Investigation and failed to produce requested documents to the \r\n  Attorney to Assist and to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC).Â  However, \r\n  the subpanel acknowledged that Respondent did appear for an interview pursuant \r\n  to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and did produce the closing file in \r\n  response to Disciplinary Counselâ€™s subpoena.Â  \r\nThe subpanel determined that Respondent \r\n  is subject to discipline in connection with Real Estate Matter A pursuant to \r\n  Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6) of RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Real Estate Matter B\r\nJohn Smith hired Respondent to close \r\n  on the sale of a condominium in May 2000.Â  At the time of the closing it was \r\n  discovered that Smith jointly held title with his deceased sister. \r\n Respondent could not attend the closing; \r\n  therefore, he secured the services of another attorney.Â  That attorney retained \r\n  approximately $10,000, which was half of the proceeds of the sale, until the \r\n  issue was resolved.Â  He also withheld $1,000 to cover repairs for which, by \r\n  the time of the closing, Smith had already paid for directly.Â  Respondent also \r\n  agreed to resolve the probate matter and clear the title to the property, and \r\n  the other attorney withheld $525 at closing for that purpose. Following the \r\n  closing, the other attorney transferred the withheld funds to Respondent.Â  \r\nThe subpanel found that Smith still has \r\n  not received the full amount of funds withheld at closing, though Respondent \r\n  returned the $1,000 withheld for repairs following a year of phone calls from \r\n  Smith.Â  Smith was forced to hire another attorney to resolve the title issues.Â  \r\n  Further, in November 2001 and in January and April 2002, the balance in Respondentâ€™s \r\n  trust account fell below the amount he was supposed to be holding in trust on \r\n  Smithâ€™s behalf. \r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s conduct in \r\n  this regard violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule \r\n  407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule \r\n  1.3 (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.5 (Fees); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping \r\n  of Property); and Rule 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation).\r\nThe subpanel further found that Respondent \r\n  failed to fully cooperate with the disciplinary investigation in violation of \r\n  Rule 8.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, in that he did not respond to \r\n  the initial inquiries of Disciplinary Counsel and did not timely respond to \r\n  the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  The subpanel found that Respondent did appear \r\n  for an interview pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, and complied \r\n  with a subpoena for Smithâ€™s file.\r\nThe subpanel determined that Respondent \r\n  is subject to discipline pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6) \r\n  of RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nIII.Â Â Â Â  Tax Conviction Matter\r\nRespondent was arrested in June 2001 \r\n  on thirteen warrants arising from a South Carolina Department of Revenue investigation.Â  \r\n  On July 24, 2002, Respondent pled guilty to one count of willful failure to \r\n  file an individual income tax return and was sentenced to one year imprisonment, \r\n  suspended upon three years probation and a fine of $1,500, plus assessments.Â  \r\n  ODC entered into evidence a certified copy of the plea agreement, judgment, \r\n  and sentence.Â  \r\nRespondent \r\n  did not report his arrest to ODC or to the Court, did not respond to ODCâ€™s inquiries \r\n  into the matter, and did not respond to the subsequent Notice of Full Investigation.Â  \r\n  Respondent invoked his Fifth Amendment rights and did not respond to questions \r\n  regarding the matter at the Rule 19(c)(4) appearance.Â  \r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s \r\n  conduct violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR: Rule 8.4(b) (Misconduct-Criminal Act); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Deceit, and Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice \r\n  to the Administration of Justice).Â  The subpanel also found that Respondent \r\n  failed to fully cooperate with the disciplinary investigation in violation of \r\n  Rule 8.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct because Respondent made no attempt \r\n  to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation after his conviction.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe subpanel determined that Respondent is subject to discipline \r\n  pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 7(a)(4), and 7(a)(5) of RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.\r\nIV.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Probate Matter\r\nRespondent represented Mrs. Doe, who \r\n  was the personal representative of her late husbandâ€™s intestate estate.Â  That \r\n  estate included $45,000 in proceeds from the sale of a condominium that Mr. \r\n  and Mrs. Doe owned jointly.Â  Respondent received the proceeds in November 2000, \r\n  but failed to distribute them to Mrs. Doe.Â  Respondent failed to respond to \r\n  Mrs. Doeâ€™s inquiries for a year.Â  Mrs. Doe then sent Respondent a certified \r\n  letter releasing him as her attorney and demanding that he release the funds \r\n  and provide her with an accounting.Â  \r\nMrs. Doe filed a petition for an order requiring \r\n  Respondent to deposit the money with the probate court and to pay her fees and \r\n  costs.Â  Her new attorney also requested an emergency hearing, and the court \r\n  issued a rule to show cause on March 1, 2002.Â  On March 6, 2002, Mrs. Doe received \r\n  a cashierâ€™s check in the amount of $45,000 from Respondent, and she withdrew \r\n  her request for an emergency hearing.Â  During the time Respondent was supposed \r\n  to be safekeeping Mrs. Doeâ€™s money, the balance in his trust account fell below \r\n  $45,000 on twenty-one occasions.Â  \r\nMrs. Doeâ€™s attorney appeared at the hearing and \r\n  testified regarding the status of and costs associated with the probate matter.Â  \r\n  She stated that, although Mrs. Doe ultimately received the funds entrusted to \r\n  Respondent, Mrs. Doe has not been compensated for her costs and fees, which \r\n  total approximately $5,000.\r\nThe subpanel found that Respondent violated \r\n  the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 \r\n  (Diligence); Rule 1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property); \r\n  Rule 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation); and Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation).\r\nThe subpanel found that Respondent violated \r\n  these rules in that he did not respond to or comply with the demands in Mrs. \r\n  Doeâ€™s letter, and that he did not respond to repeated inquiries from Mrs. Doeâ€™s \r\n  new attorney.\r\nThe subpanel further found that Respondent \r\n  failed to fully cooperate with the disciplinary investigation, in violation \r\n  of Rule 8.1 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, in that Respondent failed \r\n  to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation in this matter.Â  Respondent did \r\n  appear for a Rule 19(c)(4), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, interview, and responded \r\n  to the allegations under oath.Â  However, the subpanel found that Respondent \r\n  failed to comply with a subpoena for the production of the Doe client file and \r\n  financial records related to the above transaction.Â Â Â  \r\nThe subpanel found that Respondent is subject to \r\n  discipline for his conduct in the Probate Matter pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1), \r\n  7(a)(3), 7(a)(5), and 7(a)(6) of RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nV.Â Â Â Â Â  Jones and Title Insurance Matters\r\nRespondent \r\n  conducted a real estate closing for Mr. and Mrs. Jones on May 31, 2002.Â  Respondent \r\n  issued the Jones a check for $86,025.40 for the proceeds of the sale, which \r\n  was returned for insufficient funds.\r\nThe \r\n  Jonesâ€™s attorney, who also represents Mrs. Doe, testified at the hearing that \r\n  the Jones have not yet received any funds as compensation for the $86,025.40 \r\n  in proceeds from the sale.Â  In addition, the Jones have incurred approximately \r\n  $5,000 in attorneysâ€™ fees and litigation costs, though the Jonesâ€™s real estate \r\n  agent refunded the $2,000 commission they paid to him.Â  At the time of Respondentâ€™s \r\n  interim suspension in June 2002, the funds remaining in Respondentâ€™s trust account \r\n  were not sufficient to cover the amount due.Â Â  \r\nThe \r\n  subpanel found that Respondent violated the following Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct found in Rule 407, SCACR, in connection with the Jones matter: Rule \r\n  1.4 (Communication); Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property); and, Rule 1.16 (Declining \r\n  or Terminating Representation).Â  \r\nMoreover, in connection with the Jones matter, it was discovered that \r\n  Respondent failed to remit title insurance premiums on behalf of many of his \r\n  clients.Â  Respondent was an agent licensed by the Attorneysâ€™ Title Insurance \r\n  Fund, Inc., to issue title policies.Â  In approximately 150 cases, Respondent \r\n  collected title insurance premiums without issuing policies or paying the Fund. \r\n  [1]   \r\nThe subpanel based its estimate on the notes and partial records of Respondentâ€™s \r\n  staff because the attorney appointed to protect clientsâ€™ interests was unable \r\n  to recover most of Respondentâ€™s client files or other records.Â  The subpanel \r\n  noted that Respondent was found to be in contempt of the Supreme Court for destroying \r\n  his financial records, client records, and computers to avoid compliance with \r\n  ODC subpoenas.Â  The subpanel also noted that the Court found Respondent failed \r\n  to cooperate with the attorney appointed to protect clientsâ€™ interests and failed \r\n  to comply with an order of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct.\r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s conduct in connection with the Title Insurance \r\n  Matters violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR: Rule 1.1 (Competence); Rule 1.2 (Scope of Representation); Rule 1.3 (Diligence); \r\n  Rule 1.15 (Safekeeping of Property) Rule 1.16 (Declining or Terminating Representation); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (Misconduct-Violation of Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) \r\n  (Misconduct-Conduct Involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration of Justice).\r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s conduct in connection with the destruction \r\n  of records violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct found in Rule \r\n  407, SCACR: Rule 8.4(b) (Misconduct-Criminal Act); Rule 8.4(d) (Misconduct-Conduct \r\n  Involving Dishonesty, Fraud, Deceit, or Misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) \r\n  (Misconduct-Prejudice to the Administration of Justice).Â  \r\nThe subpanel also found that Respondent violated the following Rules for \r\n  Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, found in Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 30 (Duties Following \r\n  Disbarment or Suspension); and Rule 31 (Appointment of Attorney to Protect Clientsâ€™ \r\n  Interests When Lawyer is Transferred to Incapacity Inactive Status, Suspended, \r\n  Disbarred, Disappears, or Dies). \r\nThe subpanel found that Respondentâ€™s conduct in connection with the Jones \r\n  and Title Insurance Matters is subject to discipline in connection with Rules \r\n  7(a)(1), 7(a)(3), 7(a)(4), 7(a)(5), 7(a)(6), and 7(a)(7) of RLDE, Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR.Â Â  \r\nVI.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  Mitigation\r\nCounsel \r\n  for Respondent submitted affidavits from Respondentâ€™s mother and his psychiatrist.Â  \r\n  The affidavits state that Respondent suffers from lifelong attention deficit \r\n  disorder, major depressive episode, and alcohol dependence.Â  Respondent is currently \r\n  seeking treatment for these conditions, including medication and psychotherapy.Â  \r\n  Counsel for Respondent stated that this information was not presented as an \r\n  excuse or justification for his misconduct, but rather as an explanation.\r\nRECOMMENDATION\r\nThe \r\n  subpanel recommended disbarment for Respondent, citing Respondentâ€™s conviction \r\n  for failure to file a tax return; the contempt order from this Court; Respondentâ€™s \r\n  pattern of neglect, incompetence, and failure to adequately communicate with \r\n  his clients; the significant financial losses arising from Respondentâ€™s misconduct; \r\n  and, Respondentâ€™s repeated failure to cooperate with the disciplinary investigations.Â  \r\n\r\nRespondent \r\n  acknowledged that disbarment is the appropriate sanction.Â  However, Respondent \r\n  requested that the disbarment be made retroactive to June 27, 2002, the date \r\n  of his interim suspension.Â  Disciplinary Counsel did not object to the request. \r\n\r\n The \r\n  subpanel also requested that any Order disbarring Respondent from the practice \r\n  of law include a provision that Respondent is not to be reinstated or readmitted \r\n  until: (1) he has served his probation and paid fines and assessments ordered \r\n  in the tax matter; (2) he has compensated all persons or entities who have suffered \r\n  financial losses as a result of his misconduct; and, (3) he has demonstrated \r\n  that his mental condition and alcohol dependence are no longer impediments to \r\n  his ability to practice law.Â  \r\nThe \r\n  subpanel further recommended that Respondent be assessed the costs of this proceeding, \r\n  pursuant to Rule 7(b)(8), Rule 413, SCACR.Â  The costs incurred were $462.21.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe \r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline is given \r\n  rests entirely with the Supreme Court.Â  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 \r\n  S.E.2d 586 (2001).Â  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law, and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation.Â  In re Larkin, \r\n  336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).Â  The Court must administer the sanction \r\n  it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.Â  Id.\r\nWe \r\n  disbar Respondent from the practice of law in this state, retroactive to June \r\n  27, 2002.Â  Within six months of the date of this opinion, Respondent and Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel shall establish a restitution schedule, pursuant to which Respondent \r\n  shall make restitution to all persons and entities who have suffered financial \r\n  losses as a result of Respondentâ€™s misconduct, including, but not limited to, \r\n  Respondentâ€™s clients, the title insurance company, and the Lawyerâ€™s Fund for \r\n  Client Protection.Â  Failure to make restitution in accordance with this opinion \r\n  and the restitution plan may result in Respondent being held in contempt of \r\n  this Court.Â  Respondent shall not apply for readmission until restitution has \r\n  been paid in full, all civil matters pending against Respondent have been resolved \r\n  and all judgments are paid in full, and Respondent has served his probation \r\n  and paid fines and assessments ordered in the tax matter.Â  Further, Respondent \r\n  must remain on medication to control his condition.Â  \r\nWithin \r\n  fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice \r\n  of Law to the Clerk of Court.Â  Within ninety (90) days of the date of this opinion, \r\n  Respondent must pay the costs associated with this proceeding.Â  ($462.21).Â  \r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting \r\n  Justice Paula H. Thomas, concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Counsel for the Fund testified that he had identified only twenty-nine \r\n    cases in which Respondent had accepted premiums and failed to issue policies, \r\n    and that the costs of rechecking the titles and premiums and issuing new policies \r\n    totaled $8,783.99.Â  However, at the hearing, there was evidence that another \r\n    100 to 120 files for which Respondent had accepted money but not paid premiums \r\n    existed.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25838","title":"State v.

McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy \r\n  Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, of Columbia; and Solicitor Walter M. Bailey, \r\n  of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE KITTREDGE:Â  \r\n  Kenneth Simmons was convicted of murder, first degree burglary, armed robbery, \r\n  and first degree criminal sexual conduct.Â  He was sentenced to death and given \r\n  consecutive sentences of life and two thirty-year terms on the remaining charges.Â  \r\n  We reverse the conviction and sentence for armed robbery, but otherwise affirm \r\n  Simmonsâ€™ convictions and sentences.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 1, 1996, the \r\n  battered body of an eighty-nine-year-old female, whom we will refer to as Ms. \r\n  B, [1]  was found bound and gagged \r\n  on the kitchen floor of her home in Summerville.Â  She had been raped, severely \r\n  beaten, and strangled.Â  \r\nThe crime went unsolved \r\n  for more than a year until December 1997 when Simmons, who was incarcerated \r\n  on other charges, confessed to the killing.Â  He said he smoked crack and drank \r\n  beer at a club before riding his bicycle home in the early morning hours on \r\n  the day of the murder.Â  Simmons saw Ms. B in her yard feeding her chickens and \r\n  followed her into her house.Â  Simmons pushed her and demanded money.Â  Ms. B \r\n  fell to the floor and hit her head.Â  Simmons then hit her with a stick he had \r\n  picked up on the back porch.Â  He described the stick as being about two feet \r\n  long and an inch and a half or two inches in diameter.Â  Simmons raped Ms. B.Â  \r\n  She was â€œhalf and halfâ€ alive when he fled the scene.Â  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s pathologist \r\n  testified Ms. B died from blunt trauma and manual strangulation.Â  She had multiple \r\n  rib fractures caused by stomping or slamming, severe head trauma, and severe \r\n  vaginal lacerations from the insertion of an object such as a stick or finger.Â  \r\n  She had semen in her vagina and also in her mouth.Â  DNA testing indicated the \r\n  semen taken from Ms. Bâ€™s body was consistent with Simmonsâ€™ DNA.Â  \r\nThe jury found aggravating \r\n  circumstances of criminal sexual conduct, kidnapping, armed robbery, physical \r\n  torture, and burglary, and sentenced Simmons to death.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the State violate Doyle v. Ohio?\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Was a juror improperly dismissed after the trial had begun?\r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the trial judge err in refusing to charge robbery as a lesser-included offense \r\n  of armed robbery?\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Was rebuttal evidence improperly excluded in the penalty phase?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Doyle \r\n  v. Ohio\r\nBecause the Stateâ€™s case rested largely on Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  confession, the defense strategy during the guilt phase was to introduce expert \r\n  testimony that Simmons was not mentally capable of understanding and waiving \r\n  his Miranda [2]  rights.Â  \r\n\r\nDr. Jeffrey Vidic, a psychologist at the William \r\n  S. Hall Institute, [3]  along \r\n  with Dr. Thomas Behrman, a psychiatrist also employed at the Hall Institute, \r\n  attempted to evaluate Simmons for competency on November 23, 1998.Â  Drs. Vidic \r\n  and Behrman testified as defense witnesses.Â  Dr. Vidic was not satisfied Simmons \r\n  possessed the ability to comprehend his Miranda warnings and therefore \r\n  the competency exam could not proceed as planned.Â  Dr. Vidic stated he could \r\n  not formulate an opinion to a reasonable degree of certainty whether Simmons \r\n  actually understood his rights or whether he was â€œmalingering an inability to \r\n  understand his rights.â€Â  Dr. Behrmanâ€™s testimony lent further support to Simmonsâ€™ \r\n  position, for he stated, based on his November 23 observations, that Simmons \r\n  was not â€œable to explain his rightsÂ  . . . in a sufficient or meaningful fashion.â€Â  \r\n  Dr. Behrman specifically opined that on November 23 Simmons â€œlacked the ability \r\n  to waive his rights for the purpose of the evaluation.â€ \r\nOn cross-examination, Dr. Vidic testified over \r\n  Simmonsâ€™ objection that immediately after the aborted November 23 competency \r\n  exam, he left a note for his intern, Ms. Skaggs, asking her to administer psychological \r\n  tests to Simmons during a lunch break. The psychological testing requested by \r\n  Dr. Vidic did not involve the facts of the case.Â  Simmons refused to cooperate \r\n  with the testing administered by Ms. Skaggs, invoking his â€œrightâ€ to speak with \r\n  his lawyer.Â  The State elicited this testimony in response to Simmonsâ€™ position \r\n  that he lacked the ability to understand and exercise the Miranda warnings \r\n  and rights.\r\nOn appeal, Simmons argues the trial court erred \r\n  in allowing the prosecutorâ€™s cross-examination in violation of Doyle v. Ohio, \r\n  426 U.S. 610 (1976), and Wainwright v. Greenfield, 474 U.S. 284 (1986).Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nDoyle holds that the Due Process Clause \r\n  prohibits the government from commenting on an accused's post-Miranda \r\n  silence.Â  Doyle rests on â€œthe fundamental unfairness of implicitly assuring \r\n  a suspect that his silence will not be used against him and then using his silence \r\n  to impeach an explanation subsequently offered at trial.â€Â  South Dakota v. \r\n  Neville, 459 U.S. 553, 565 (1983).Â  This same concept of fundamental unfairness \r\n  prohibits the government from using a defendantâ€™s post-Miranda silence \r\n  as proof of sanity to overcome an insanity defense.Â  Wainwright v. Greenfield, \r\n  supra; see also State v. Smith, 290 S.C. 393, 350 S.E.2d \r\n  923 (1986).\r\nDoyle does not, however, create a per se \r\n  rule requiring exclusion from evidence of a defendantâ€™s post-arrest, post-Miranda \r\n  silence in all circumstances.Â  As the Doyle court recognized:\r\n\r\nIt goes almost without saying that the fact of post-arrest \r\n  silence could be used by the prosecution to contradict a defendant who testifies \r\n  to an exculpatory version of events and claims to have told the police the same \r\n  version upon arrest.Â  In that situation the fact of earlier silence would not \r\n  be used to impeach the exculpatory story, but rather to challenge the defendantâ€™s \r\n  testimony as to his behavior following arrest.\r\n\r\nId. at 619, n.11.\r\nIn Anderson v. Charles, 447 U.S. 404 (1980), \r\n  the Court further clarifiedÂ  Doyle: \r\n\r\nDoyle does not apply to cross-examination that merely \r\n  inquires into prior inconsistent statements.Â  Such questioning makes no unfair \r\n  use of silence because a defendant who voluntarily speaks after receiving Miranda \r\n  warnings has not been induced to remain silent.Â  As to the subject matter of \r\n  his statements, the defendant has not remained silent at all.\r\n\r\n447 U.S. at 408.Â  Other courts have found the Supreme \r\n  Courtâ€™s holding in Charles is not limited to situations involving inconsistent \r\n  statements.Â Â  See Splunge v Parke, 160 F.3d 369 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1998) (initial silence used to show police scrupulously honored defendantâ€™s \r\n  rights); Allen v. State, 686 N.E.2d 760 (Ind. 1997) (refusal to give \r\n  written statement after oral statement used to show rights respected); Commonwealth \r\n  v. Waite, 665 N.E.2d 982 (Mass. 1996) (reassertion of silence used to show \r\n  context in which questioning ended); State v. Correia, 707 A.2d 1245 \r\n  (R.I. 1998) (same).Â  \r\nThe underpinnings of Doyle, and the need \r\n  for its application, are diminished where a defendant waives his right to silence.Â  \r\n  Here, Simmons did not remain silent â€œas to the subject matter of his statements.â€Â  \r\n  Simmons, following a waiver of his Miranda rights, confessed to the murder \r\n  of Ms. B in December 1997.Â  Following the lone invocation of his right to remain \r\n  silent in the context of the November 23, 1998, competency evaluation, Simmons \r\n  again waived his Miranda rights and cooperated with a January 1999 evaluation.Â  \r\n  In this regard, in response to the defense strategy centered on Simmonsâ€™ purported \r\n  inability to comprehend the Miranda warnings, the Stateâ€™s targeted and \r\n  narrow use of Simmonsâ€™ recognition and exercise of his â€œrightâ€ to speak with \r\n  counsel did not breach the implied assurance contained in Miranda.Â  Simmons \r\n  asserted his right to silence only in the context of the November 23 psychological \r\n  examination.Â  The limited evidence of Simmonsâ€™ silence in this context was not \r\n  â€œdesigned to draw meaning from silenceâ€ regarding the substantive crime and \r\n  therefore does not violate Doyle.Â  Charles, 447 U.S. at 409.\r\nThis case is distinguishable from Greenfield.Â  \r\n  In Greenfield the evidence of the defendantâ€™s silence was used as substantive \r\n  evidence of guilt in the prosecutionâ€™s case-in-chief because the defendant pled \r\n  not guilty by reason of insanity.Â  Here, the evidence of Simmonsâ€™ silence was \r\n  not offered as substantive evidence of guilt but as evidence of malingering \r\n  to rebut his claim that he was incapable of understanding his Miranda \r\n  rights.Â  \r\nWe thus conclude the Stateâ€™s use of evidence of \r\n  Simmonsâ€™ silence did not violate the fundamental fairness standard of Doyle.\r\n2.Â  Dismissal of juror\r\nAfter jury selection, the trial judge informed the jury about sequestration \r\n  and repeatedly admonished the jury not to discuss the case with anyone.Â  Contact \r\n  by jurors with family members, by telephone or otherwise, was to be monitored \r\n  by the SLED team in charge of security and sequestration.\r\nBefore the end of the guilt phase, information regarding Juror C was \r\n  brought to the courtâ€™s attention.Â  The trial judge noted for the record:Â  \r\n\r\nCaptain Polk of SLED received \r\n  a call from the wife of [Juror C] at which time the lady revealed to him that \r\n  she was very concerned because she realized that the sister of the defendant, \r\n  Kenneth Simmons, lived across the street from a piece of property that they \r\n  owned on Congress Street in the Town of Summerville.Â  And in the event that \r\n  the jury returned a verdict of guilty or imposed the death penalty and they \r\n  were going to build on a vacant lot across the street from the defendantâ€™s sister \r\n  that it would perhaps cause consternation, fear, concern, or whatever.Â  \r\n\r\nThe trial judge asked Captain \r\n  Polk to call Juror Câ€™s wife but Captain Polk was unable to immediately contact \r\n  her.\r\nMeanwhile, the trial judge received a note from Juror C stating:\r\n\r\nYour honor, I have realized that \r\n  I know a possible relative of the defendant, Kenneth Simmons, and asked earlier \r\n  in the week if I knew relatives of the accused, I truthfully answered no.Â  After \r\n  the trial started, I saw a woman I recognized sitting behind Kenneth Simmons.Â  \r\n  I now realize the woman in the audience was, I believe, a Mrs. Louise that lives \r\n  opposite a vacant lot I own in the Town of Summerville on Congress Street.Â  \r\n  In the future my wife and I intend to build on this lot our primary residence.Â  \r\n  I have upon occasion been cordial with Mrs. Louise and say hello to her while \r\n  I am on or about my property.Â  Knowing Mrs. Louise will not influence my decision-making \r\n  ability regarding the guilt or innocence of Kenneth Simmons.Â  If the trial proceeds \r\n  to the penalty stage, none of the above will influence my decision-making ability \r\n  regarding life imprisonment or the death penalty as outlined in the pre-trial \r\n  questionnaire.Â  I felt it was my duty as a juror to inform you of the above \r\n  and to continue to serve you in any capacity you see fit.\r\n\r\nCaptain Polk then spoke with \r\n  Juror Câ€™s wife.Â  She told Captain Polk she had talked with her husband about \r\n  Simmonsâ€™ sister and stated she was upset, fearful, and â€œreally concerned.â€Â  \r\n  Although Juror Câ€™s note was written after the improper conversation, the note \r\n  contained no reference to the conversation.\r\nThe State then moved to excuse Juror C.Â  Simmons requested that the trial judge \r\n  first question Juror C about the conversation with his wife.Â  The trial judge \r\n  questioned Juror C in chambers.Â  Juror C confirmed that he and his wife had \r\n  discussed the personal effect of a verdict in the case.Â  The trial judge explained \r\n  to Juror C that because he and his wife had discussed the case, he would be \r\n  excused from the case.Â  As a result of the â€œimproper communicationâ€ between \r\n  Juror C and his wife, Juror C was excused.Â  \r\nOn appeal, Simmons contends the trial court erred in dismissing Juror C since \r\n  the juror indicated he could maintain his impartiality.Â  We disagree.Â  Simmons \r\n  cites Greer v. Neville, 21 S.C.L. (3 Hill) 262 (1837), for the proposition \r\n  that once the jury has been sworn, the trial court cannot discharge a qualified \r\n  juror without legal cause absent the consent of both parties.Â  In Greer, \r\n  a juror was removed after being seated solely on the basis of counselâ€™s assertion \r\n  that the juror was biased against counsel and would not do his client justice.Â  \r\n  There was no evidence to support counselâ€™s bald assertion, and our court of \r\n  appeals found the excusal of the juror arbitrary.\r\nThe court of appeals distinguished Greer in the case of Boland v. \r\n  Greenville and Columbia R.R. Co., 46 S.C.L. (12 Rich.) 368 (1859), wherein \r\n  a juror, who was the local coroner, was dismissed during trial because he was \r\n  needed to investigate a homicide.Â  The court noted it is within the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  discretion to substitute an alternate juror where there is a legal necessity \r\n  or there is disclosed during trial a disqualifying interest of a juryman.Â  Id. \r\n\r\nIn this case, the record indicates Juror C discussed the case with his wife, \r\n  including the personal effect of a possible verdict, against the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  express admonition not to do so.Â  We hold the trial judge acted within his discretion \r\n  in excusing Juror C for the jurorâ€™s unauthorized communication with his wife. \r\n  [4] Â  \r\n3.Â  Robbery as a lesser-included offense\r\nUpon the Stateâ€™s objection, the trial court refused Simmonsâ€™ request \r\n  to charge robbery as a lesser-included offense of armed robbery ruling that \r\n  â€œ[w]hile itâ€™s a true proposition of law . . . itâ€™s not applicable to the uncontradicted \r\n  facts.â€Â  Simmons contends this was error because the evidence indicates the \r\n  only weapons involved were fists and a stick, and whether either of these qualifies \r\n  as a â€œdeadly weaponâ€ is a question of fact for the jury.Â  The State argues that \r\n  since the victim died as a result of wounds inflicted by fists or a stick, these \r\n  are â€œdeadly weaponsâ€ as a matter of law. \r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-330(A) (Supp. 2003) defines armed \r\n  robbery in pertinent part as â€œrobbery while armed with a pistol, dirk, slingshot, \r\n  metal knuckles, razor, or other deadly weapon.â€ (emphasis added).Â Â Â  \r\n  Whether an object has been used as a deadly weapon depends upon the facts and \r\n  circumstances of each case.Â  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d \r\n  133 (1992) (murder); [5]  see \r\n  also State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997) (fist \r\n  may be deadly weapon for purposes of armed robbery).Â  Despite the egregious \r\n  facts of this case, we adhere to the rule in Davis and hold that whether \r\n  the robbery was perpetrated with a deadly weapon was a question of fact for \r\n  the jury.Â Â  \r\n Although the trial court charged the jury that it was to determine \r\n  whether a deadly weapon was used, the court refused to give the jury the option \r\n  of convicting Simmons of the lesser offense of robbery.Â  This was error.Â  We \r\n  therefore reverse Simmonsâ€™ conviction and sentence for armed robbery.Â  See \r\n  Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999) (trial judge \r\n  must charge lesser-included offense if there is any evidence from which it can \r\n  be inferred the defendant committed lesser rather than greater offense).Â Â  \r\nThe real impetus in Simmonsâ€™ challenge to the failure to charge the lesser-included \r\n  offense is to invalidate the juryâ€™s finding of armed robbery as an aggravating \r\n  factor, and ultimately, invalidate the sentence of death.Â  While we agree that \r\n  the error requires us to vacate the invalid aggravator of armed robbery, the \r\n  error does not warrant reversal of the death sentence.Â  Succinctly stated, we \r\n  find Simmonsâ€™ death sentence is supported by other valid aggravators. \r\nIn Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862 (1983), the Supreme Court held that \r\n  in states such as ours where aggravating and mitigating factors are not weighed \r\n  â€œpursuant to any special standard,â€ a death sentence may be upheld even where \r\n  one aggravator has been invalidated if there is a valid aggravator remaining. [6] Â  As the Court later explained in Tuggle \r\n  v. Netherland, 516 U.S. 10, 13 (1995), Zant was â€œpredicated on the \r\n  fact that even after elimination of the invalid aggravator, the death sentence \r\n  rested on firm ground.â€ Â To the contrary, in Tuggle, an aggravator was \r\n  invalidated because the defendant was precluded from developing rebuttal evidence \r\n  relevant in the penalty phase.Â  The Court concluded the evidentiary error could \r\n  have affected the juryâ€™s consideration of the death sentence even though another \r\n  aggravator was found.Â  We are confronted with no such evidentiary preclusion.\r\nHere, the jury affirmatively found independent aggravators of criminal sexual \r\n  conduct, kidnapping, burglary, and physical torture, in addition to armed robbery.Â  \r\n  There was no error in the admission or exclusion of evidence in the penalty \r\n  phase.Â  We conclude the invalidation of the armed robbery aggravator does not \r\n  impact the validity of the other aggravators found by the jury in this case, \r\n  and we reject Simmonsâ€™ challenge to his death sentence.\r\n4.Â  Rebuttal evidence in penalty phase\r\nIn the penalty phase, the State presented victim impact evidence from \r\n  the victimâ€™s family and friends stating how they were negatively affected by \r\n  the victimâ€™s death.Â  During the defense case, Simmonsâ€™ cousin, Calvin Linning, \r\n  testified about positive features of Simmonsâ€™ character.Â  Linning then stated:Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nItâ€™s awfully hard for me to be \r\n  up here today because Iâ€™m certainly nervous because we know [the victim] personally.Â  \r\n  I grew up in the Church of God in Summerville and [the victim] and my family \r\n  was real close.Â  We would take her to the State Youth Convention year after \r\n  year.Â  My brother is the one that taught her how to drive.Â  And my niece was \r\n  really close to [the victim].Â  She had a real close relationship with her.Â  \r\n  And it was real painful when we discovered about her - \r\n\r\nAt this point, the State objected \r\n  to Linningâ€™s testimony regarding â€œhis personal feelings about what occurred.â€Â  \r\n  The objection was sustained.Â  Linning finished his testimony by asking the jury \r\n  to give Simmons a life sentence rather than death.Â  \r\nSimmons contends it was a due process violation for the trial court \r\n  to disallow Linningâ€™s testimony that Simmonsâ€™ family suffered because of the \r\n  victimâ€™s death.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nFirst, this argument was not raised at trial and no proffer was \r\n  made as to what Linningâ€™s testimony would have been had he been allowed to continue.Â  \r\n  This issue therefore is not preserved for review.Â  State v. Hughes, 336 \r\n  S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999) (to be preserved for appellate review, issue \r\n  must be raised and ruled upon in the trial court).Â  In any event, there was \r\n  no error.Â  \r\nIn Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), \r\n  the Supreme Court ruled victim impact evidence is admissible to show the victimâ€™s \r\n  uniqueness as an individual human being and the specific harm committed by the \r\n  defendant in murdering the victim.Â  This evidence is relevant for the jury to \r\n  meaningfully assess the defendantâ€™s moral culpability and blameworthiness.Â  \r\n  State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997).Â  Here, the impact \r\n  of the victimâ€™s death on Simmonsâ€™ family is not relevant rebuttal to the evidence \r\n  of Simmonsâ€™ moral culpability shown by the victim impact testimony.Â  We find \r\n  no due process violation. \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nPursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(2003), we find the death sentence \r\n  in this case was not imposed under the influence of passion, prejudice, or any \r\n  other arbitrary factor; the evidence supports the juryâ€™s findings of aggravating \r\n  circumstances; and the sentence of death is neither excessive nor disproportionate \r\n  to the penalty imposed in similar cases.Â  See State v. Terry, \r\n  339 S.C. 352, 529 S.E.2d 274 (2000); State v. Conyers, 326 S.C. 263, \r\n  487 S.E.2d 181 (1997); State v. Whipple, 324 S.C. 43, 476 S.E.2d 683 \r\n  (1996).Â  We reverse Simmonsâ€™ conviction and sentence for armed robbery and affirm \r\n  his remaining convictions and sentences.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\n TOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] We \r\n    elect not to identify the victim by name.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Â  Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] Â  The William S. Hall Institute is the primary educational and research \r\n    facility for the South Carolina Department of Mental Health.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] Â  We emphasize this is not a case where a juror was removed for concealing \r\n    information during voir dire.Â  This jurorâ€™s self-proclaimed impartiality is \r\n    therefore not dispositive.Â  Cf. State v. Stone, 350 S.C. 442, \r\n    567 S.E.2d 244 (2002) (error to remove juror for innocently concealing information \r\n    where juror indicated her impartiality was not affected).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 \r\n    S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999) (failure to give King charge not reversible \r\n    error).Â Â \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] Â  Zant involved Georgiaâ€™s death penalty statute.Â  Georgiaâ€™s \r\n    statutory approach requires the factfinder to consider applicable aggravating \r\n    and mitigating circumstances, without regard to â€œany special standard.â€Â  Id. \r\n    at 873.Â  In weighing â€œaggravating and mitigating circumstances against each \r\n    other,â€ the Georgia statutory scheme is not â€œgoverned by any specific standards.â€Â  \r\n    Id. at 875.Â  Under Georgia law, the factfinder retains â€œabsolute discretionâ€ \r\n    to impose a life sentence, notwithstanding the presence of an aggravating \r\n    circumstance.Â  Id. at 871.Â  South Carolinaâ€™s statutory scheme is in \r\n    accord, and we find the reasoning of Zant persuasive.Â  See S.C. \r\n    Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003) (if statutory aggravating circumstance found, \r\n    defendant sentenced to either death or life imprisonment); State v. Hughey, \r\n    339 S.C. 439, 529 S.E.2d 721 (2000) (jury may recommend life imprisonment \r\n    for any reason or no reason at all); State v. Elkins, 312 S.C. 541, \r\n    436 S.E.2d 178 (1993) (under our capital sentencing scheme, jury does not \r\n    â€œweighâ€ aggravating circumstances; the failure of one aggravating circumstance \r\n    does not require reversal where there remains a valid aggravator).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Mark D.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the \r\n  agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any sanction within \r\n  the range of an admonition to a three month definite suspension from the practice \r\n  of law.Â  See Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  We accept the agreement \r\n  and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for \r\n  a three month period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I \r\nIn May 1998, respondent graduated from law school andÂ  was admitted to the \r\n  North Carolina Bar three months later.Â  She was employed by the firm of Forquer \r\n  &amp; Green in Charlotte, North Carolina.Â  After she was admitted to the South \r\n  Carolina Bar in August 1998, respondent was assigned to the firmâ€™s Rock Hill \r\n  law office.Â  Respondent was the only licensed attorney working in the Rock Hill \r\n  office of Forquer &amp; Green.Â  \r\nOn September 1, 1999, Forquer &amp; Green merged with the firm of Brock &amp; \r\n  Scott.Â  In South Carolina, the firm operated as Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; \r\n  Scott.Â  At the time of the merger, respondent became an employee of the new \r\n  law firm and was given a one percent interest in the firm.Â  \r\nWith the merger, three non-lawyer employees moved into the Rock Hill office.Â  \r\n  The three employees included an unlicensed law school graduate (Mr. Brown) and \r\n  two legal assistants.Â  Respondent supervised all three employees.Â  \r\nWhile employed at Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott, Mr. Brown conducted real \r\n  estate closings, both inside and outside of the office, without respondent or \r\n  another attorney being present.Â  Mr. Brown signed respondentâ€™s name on real \r\n  estate closing documents without indicating he was signing for her.Â  This was \r\n  done with respondentâ€™s knowledge and, in some cases, in her presence.Â  \r\nAfter conducting real estate closings, it was Mr. Brownâ€™s practice to have \r\n  other firm employees sign as witness and/or notary on the documents even though \r\n  they were not present at the closings.Â  Mr. Brown also routinely signed as witness \r\n  and notary to documents related to closings at which he was not present.Â  Respondent \r\n  was not specifically aware of these practices; however, she admits she was responsible \r\n  for Mr. Brownâ€™s supervision.Â  \r\nFrom September 1999 until January 2000, respondent and Mr. Brown handled approximately \r\n  sixty to eighty real estate closings per month.Â  Although respondent represents \r\n  she had concern, respondent made no meaningful inquiry into the propriety of \r\n  non-lawyers conducting real estate closings.Â  Respondent did not conduct any \r\n  legal research, consult with an attorney outside her firm, or seek guidance \r\n  from the South Carolina Bar concerning the propriety of a non-lawyers conducting \r\n  real estate closings.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nOn January 17, 2000, respondent left Green, Brock, Forquer &amp; Scott.Â  As \r\n  a favor to the firm, however, respondent conducted a real estate closing in \r\n  Greenville for Complainants A and B.Â  Following the closing, respondent left \r\n  the closing documents in the firmâ€™s Rock Hill office and took no further action \r\n  in regard to the closing.Â  Where she had failed to sign her name on the closing \r\n  documents, Mr. Brown signed respondentâ€™s name, including on an affidavit and \r\n  a certification.Â  On one document, Mr. Brown notarized respondentâ€™s signature \r\n  when he had signed her name himself.Â  Mr. Brown signed his own name as witness \r\n  on the documents even though he was not present when the documents were executed.Â  \r\n  Mr. Brown notarized Complainant Aâ€™s and Complainant Bâ€™s signatures in two places.Â  \r\n  Some of the documents in the closing file were incomplete or left blank.Â  Mr. \r\n  Brown completed the documents and filled in the blanks.Â  \r\nWhen Complainants A and B subsequently attempted to refinance the property, \r\n  they discovered the mortgage and deed had never been filed.Â  Respondent admits \r\n  she failed to adequately explain her limited role in connection with the closing.Â  \r\n  She further admits she failed to ensure the closing documents where appropriately \r\n  completed and filed.Â Â Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her misconduct she has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.2 (lawyer may limit objectives \r\n  of representation with client consent after consultation); Rule 5.3 (lawyer \r\n  having direct supervisory authority over non-lawyer employee shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to ensure that the personâ€™s conduct is compatible with the professional \r\n  obligations of the lawyer; lawyer is responsible for conduct of non-lawyer employee \r\n  if the conduct would be a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct if \r\n  engaged in by a lawyer and lawyer orders or, with the knowledge of the specific \r\n  conduct, ratifies the conduct involved);
