isolated rural\r\n  homes looking for vulnerable victims.Â  He would appear midday at homes,\r\n  claiming to be looking for someone or having car trouble.Â  Appellant\r\n  burglarized Dennis's home office a day after visiting Dennis's home.Â  He next\r\n  broke into Ammons' home while no one was there, cutting the phone wires and\r\n  stealing a pistol and ammunition.Â  Later that same day he shot victim Brown, who\r\n  was fishing along the Wateree River, in the back.\r\nOn October 9, appellant killed an\r\n  acquaintance (victim Gainey), leaving his body on a rural road, then stole\r\n  electronics and an aquarium from Mr. Gainey's trailer before setting it on\r\n  fire.Â  Two days later, appellant went to victim Tietjen's home, shot him nine\r\n  times, and looted the house.Â  Appellant answered several calls made to Mr. Tietjen's\r\n  cell phone by Mr. Tietjen's wife and daughter, telling both of them that he was\r\n  the &quot;prowler&quot; and that Mr. Tietjen was dead.Â  He burned Mr. Tietjen's\r\n  face and eyes with a cigarette.Â  Appellant left two notes on paper and scrawled\r\n  a message on the wall: &quot;victim number four in two weeks, catch me if you\r\n  can.&quot;Â  On another wall the word â€œcatchâ€ and some letters were written in\r\n  blood.Â  \r\nTwo days later appellant met victim Burgess\r\n  at a convenience store around 4:30 am.Â  They left together, and less than two\r\n  hours later, a hunter found Mr. Burgess dead from gunshot wounds on a road bed\r\n  in a rural area.\r\nAppellant pled guilty to these offenses, in\r\n  chronological order by date of offense:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tOctober 5, 2004: Second degree\r\n  burglary (Dennis);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 8, 2004: First degree\r\n  burglary (Ammons);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 8, 2004: ABIK (Brown);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 9, 2004: Murder, first\r\n  degree burglary, second degree arson (Gainey);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 11, 2004: Murder, armed\r\n  robbery, possession of a stolen handgun (Tietjen);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 13, 2004: Murder\r\n  (Burgess);\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tMarch 9, 2005: Threatening the\r\n  life of a public employee (Correctional Officer Jones); and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tOctober 13, 2005: ABIK\r\n  (Correctional Officer Justice).\r\n\t\r\n\r\nAppellant\r\n  received a death sentence for the Tietjen murder, the aggravating circumstance\r\n  being armed robbery, and received concurrent life sentences for the two other\r\n  murders (Gainey and Burgess) and the two first degree burglaries (Ammons and\r\n  Gainey), thirty years for armed robbery (Tietjen), twenty-five years for the\r\n  second degree arson (Gainey), twenty years for the two ABIKs (Brown and\r\n  Justice), fifteen years for the second degree burglary (Dennis), five years for\r\n  possessing a handgun (Tietjen), and thirty days for threatening (Correctional\r\n  Officer Jones).\r\nAppellant was\r\n  unquestionably a deeply troubled individual who was first institutionalized in\r\n  the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (DJJ) when he was eleven\r\n  years old, and whose elementary school records showed low intelligence and\r\n  placement in emotionally handicapped classes.Â  He had sought mental health\r\n  counseling in September 2004 before beginning this crime spree.Â  After his\r\n  arrest in October 2004, he was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder\r\n  (PTSD) based on childhood sexual abuse by family members, Attention Deficit\r\n  Disorder (ADD), and chronic depression.Â  The ADD and depression diagnoses had\r\n  first been made when appellant was incarcerated in DJJ.Â  Appellant also\r\n  regularly abused marijuana sprayed with RAID insecticide, methamphetamine, and\r\n  Benadryl.\r\nAppellant called\r\n  his paternal grandmother as a mitigation witness.Â  She testified that in August\r\n  2004 appellant, then aged twenty-three, confided to her and her daughter,\r\n  Terry, appellant's aunt, that he had been sexually abused beginning around the\r\n  age of 6 or 7 by his paternal grandfather, his mother's brother, and an older\r\n  half-brother.Â  Appellant was extremely agitated, and his grandmother and Aunt\r\n  Terry called a deputy and received information on getting help for appellant as\r\n  a sexual abuse victim.Â  Appellant sought help from two agencies before the\r\n  spree began.\r\nAppellant next\r\n  called Aunt Terry as a witness.Â  She confirmed her mother's testimony about\r\n  appellant's August 2004 confession.Â  During Aunt Terry's direct examination,\r\n  the following exchange occurred:\r\n\r\n\tQ.Â  Okay.Â  And what is your relationship to\r\n  [appellant's] grandfather William Edward Bryant?\r\n\tA.Â  He's my biological father.\r\n\tQ.Â  Okay.Â  And did you ever have any problems\r\n  specifically with him?\r\n\tA.&nbsp; Yes, sir.\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSOLICITOR: \r\n\t\t\t\tYour Honor, I object to the relevance\r\n  of any problems she may have had with\r\n  family members.Â  This is about [appellant].\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTHE COURT:\r\n\t\t\t\tSustained.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMR. HOWELL: \r\n\t\t\t\tYour Honor, I think these problems are of\r\n  the same nature.Â  I think it goes to the same person\r\n  committing them and -\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTHE COURT:&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t\tIt may go to this but it has no relevance\r\n  as to [appellant].Â  I mean, you can testify as to\r\n  [appellant].\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMR. HOWELL: \r\n\t\t\t\tYour Honor, we feel it adds credibility\r\n  to what [appellant] has said about the same type\r\n  molestation.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTHE COURT: \r\n\t\t\t\tAnd she can testify as to what she may have\r\n  observed, if she has any personal knowledge, about any\r\n  abuse to [appellant], but I don't think it goes to\r\n  - it's not relevant to [appellant's] case as to\r\n  what abuse this grandfather may have\r\n  inflicted on others.Â  It's not a question of how\r\n  extensive his abuse but it's the relevancy to this\r\n  defendant.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tMR. HOWELL: \r\n\t\t\t\tOkay.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\tBY MR.\r\n  HOWELL:Â  \r\n\tQ.Â  Let\r\n  me ask you this.Â  What kind of relationship did you have?Â  Were you\r\n  close to your father at all?\r\n\tA.Â \r\n  No.Â  I was, as a child, for a time and then things started happening\r\n  and -\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tSOLICITOR: \r\n\t\t\t\tYour Honor, again, I -\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tTHE COURT:\r\n\t\t\t\tSustained.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether the trial judge erred in\r\n  refusing to allow Aunt Terry to testify that she had been sexually abused by\r\n  appellant's grandfather?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends that the trial judge\r\n  committed reversible error in refusing to allow Aunt Terry to testify that she\r\n  was sexually abused by her father.Â  We find no abuse of discretion here.Â  State\r\n    v. Winkler, 388 S.C. 574, 698 S.E.2d 596 (2010).\r\nAppellant's childhood sexual abuse, as well\r\n  as that inflicted upon appellant's aunt, were part of the foundation upon which\r\n  appellant's mental health expert and his social history expert based their\r\n  opinions.Â  Both experts testified, without objection, to these opinions.Â \r\n  Accordingly, whether the aunt should have been allowed to testify directly to\r\n  her abuse is irrelevant to appellant's mitigation case.Â  The purpose of Aunt\r\n  Terry's testimony was to establish intrafamilial sexual abuse.Â  Since\r\n  appellant's experts were permitted to testify to this abuse, appellant was not\r\n  prejudiced by the trial court's decision to sustain the solicitor's objection.Â  Cf. State v. Mercer, 381 S.C. 149, 672 S.E.2d 556 (2009) (no\r\n  reversible error where excluded evidence was presented through other\r\n  witnesses).Â  Accordingly, even if that ruling were error, appellant could not\r\n  demonstrate prejudice warranting reversal.Â  E.g., State v. Wyatt,\r\n  317 S.C. 370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995).\r\nPROPORTIONALITY\r\n  REVIEW\r\nWe have conducted the proportionality review\r\n  required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003), and find the capital sentence\r\n  imposed here is not the result of passion, prejudice, or other arbitrary\r\n  factor.Â  Further, we find the sentence here is neither arbitrary nor\r\n  capricious.Â  E.g. State v. Shuler, 344 S.C. 604, 545 S.E.2d 805\r\n  (2001) (capital sentence for murder in commission of armed robbery).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAppellant's convictions and sentences are \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26907","title":"In the Matter of Michael James Sarratt","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26907","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court suspended a lawyer from the practice of law for nine months.","date":"2011-01-07","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Michael James Sarratt, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26907\r\nHeard December 1, 2010 - Filed January 7, 2011Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

and failure to answer formal charges or appear at the Panel\r\n  hearing.[3]Â  In light of these findings,\r\n  the Panel recommended Respondent be disbarred.\r\nIII.\r\nThis\r\n  Court &quot;may accept, reject, or modify in whole or in part the findings,\r\n  conclusions and recommendations of the Commission.&quot;Â  Rule 27(e)(2), RLDE,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nAn\r\n  attorney's failure to answer the formal charges against her is an admission of\r\n  the factual allegations set forth in those charges.Â  Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  Similarly, an attorney's failure to appear before the Panel when\r\n  ordered to do so is an admission of the factual allegations that were the\r\n  subject of the hearing.Â  Rule 24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nIV.\r\nWe\r\n  find Respondent has committed misconduct in the respects identified by the\r\n  Panel, except that there is no evidence Respondent committed misconduct\r\n  involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation in violation of Rule\r\n  8.4(d), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.Â  Thus, we find Respondent violated the following\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.3 (diligence), Rule\r\n  1.4(a) (communication), Rule 1.16 (declining or terminating representation), Rule\r\n  3.2 (expediting litigation), and Rule 8.1(b) (knowing failure to respond to a\r\n  lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority).\r\nWe find the Panel's\r\n  recommendation of disbarment is appropriate.Â  As we have stated on numerous\r\n  occasions, an attorney who &quot;fail[s] to answer charges or appear to defend\r\n  or explain alleged misconduct indicates an obvious disinterest in the practice\r\n  of law.&quot;Â  Attorneys who engage in such conduct face severe sanctions\r\n  &quot;because a central purpose of the disciplinary process is to protect the\r\n  public from unscrupulous and indifferent lawyers.&quot;Â  In re Hall, 333\r\n  S.C. 247, 251, 509 S.E.2d 266, 268 (1998); see, e.g., In re Tullis,\r\n  375 S.C. 190, 192, 652 S.E.2d 395, 395-96 (2007) (quoting this language from Hall); In re Murph, 350 S.C. 1, 4, 564 S.E.2d 673, 675 (2002) (same); see\r\n    also In re Sifly, 279 S.C. 113, 302 S.E.2d 858 (1983) (disbarring an\r\n  attorney who failed to timely file an appeal on behalf of a client, failed to\r\n  adequately represent a client in a trust fund matter resulting in significant\r\n  monetary loss to the client, drew checks on his personal account that were not\r\n  sufficiently funded, had a civil default judgment entered against him, and\r\n  failed to cooperate with disciplinary authorities or appear to contest the\r\n  charges against him).\r\nRespondent's\r\n  failure to respond to ODC or to the Panel, together with her failure to provide\r\n  the South Carolina Bar with a current address, indicates Respondent has abandoned\r\n  the practice of law.Â  This conduct warrants disbarment.Â  In addition, Respondent's\r\n  lack of diligence resulted in serious harm to her clients: they were prevented\r\n  from reaching settlements and their potentially meritorious claims were time-barred.\r\nV.\r\nRespondent\r\n  is hereby disbarred, in accord with our precedent regarding the abandonment of\r\n  the practice of law.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, Respondent\r\n  shall surrender her certificate of admission to practice law and shall file an\r\n  affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE,\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Pursuant to the Panel's recommendations, Respondent shall pay\r\n  the costs of the Panel proceedings and, before she may be readmitted to\r\n  practice in this state, Respondent shall reimburse the Lawyers' Fund for Client\r\n  Protection for any amounts paid to her clients as a result of her misconduct.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J.., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; ODC obtained an address for Respondent from\r\n  another member of the Bar.Â  This address was in Colorado.Â  ODC mailed a Notice\r\n  of Formal Charges to the Colorado address, but the notice was returned\r\n  unclaimed.\r\n[2]&nbsp; In addition to the seven client complaints, ODC received a complaint from Ms. Glover's former employer alleging Ms. Glover\r\n  failed to remit the employer's portion of certain fees.Â  The Panel did not make\r\n  any finding of misconduct based on this allegation, other than that Ms. Glover\r\n  failed to respond.\r\n[3]&nbsp; In addition to the aggravating factors found\r\n  by the Panel, we note Respondent has a disciplinary history that includes an\r\n  April 2008 suspension for failure to pay annual license fees and assessments\r\n  and a June 2008 suspension for failure to comply with continuing legal\r\n  education requirements.Â  In October 2008, Respondent was placed on interim\r\n  suspension and an attorney was appointed to represent her clients' interests.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26910","title":"M&T Group v.

(M&amp;T) in\r\n  a breach of contract action.Â  We reverse and remand for trial.\r\nI.Â  \r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when there is no\r\n  genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to\r\n  judgment as a matter of law. See Rule 56(c), SCRCP; see also Hancock\r\n    v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., Inc., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009)\r\n  (&quot;[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof,\r\n  the non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\n  order to withstand a motion for summary judgment.&quot;).Â  Having carefully\r\n  reviewed the record under the appropriate standard, we find a genuine issue of\r\n  material fact exists. \r\nII.\r\nOn\r\n  February 5, 2005, John Cox (John) conveyed the real property subject to this\r\n  action to Palmetto Point of Williamston, LLC (Palmetto Point).Â  John Cox was\r\n  the sole shareholder and officer of Palmetto Point.Â  John died intestate on May\r\n  10, 2006, leaving his wife, Jill Cox (Jill), and two minor children as his\r\n  intestate heirs.Â  Jill was appointed personal representative of John's estate\r\n  on June 2, 2006. \r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2007, Jill, as personal representative of John's estate, entered\r\n  into a contract for the sale of the land from Palmetto Point to M&amp;T.Â  As\r\n  required by the agreement, M&amp;T placed $50,000 in escrow towards the\r\n  purchase as earnest money.Â  Only one contract provision (addressing M&amp;T's\r\n  ability to obtain title insurance) is relevant in resolving this appeal.Â  Section\r\n  5 of the contract provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  purchaser shall be under no obligation to purchase the Property from the Seller \r\n\tunless the Purchaser can obtain from a nationally recognized title insurance\r\n    company, at its regular rates, satisfactory title insurance for the\r\n      subject property, insuring that the title is marketable.Â  Purchaser shall\r\n  have 30 days from the date hereof to notify Seller of any reasonable\r\n    objections to the state of the title to the Property . . . If Purchaser\r\n  makes any objections to title, Seller shall have the option to take the\r\n  necessary steps to correct such objection . . . If Seller elects not to correct\r\n  such objection(s), and so notifies purchaser, Purchaser shall have fifteen (15)\r\n  days from the date of notice . . . to continue the terms of this contract with\r\n  the title &quot;as is&quot; or to terminate all terms and conditions of this\r\n  agreement and receive a full refund of all monies paid hereunder, and neither\r\n  party shall have any further liability hereunder. (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\n\r\nOn November\r\n  28, 2007, Matthew Head (Head), counsel for M&amp;T, timely sent a letter to\r\n  Calhoun Pruitt (Pruitt), counsel for Palmetto Point pursuant to section 5 of\r\n  the contract.Â  In the November 28 letter, Head outlined numerous objections,\r\n  and one objection concerned Jill's authority to sell the property.Â  On December\r\n  14, M&amp;T sought to cancel the sale and obtain the return of the earnest\r\n  money. Â Nevertheless, Head and Pruitt\r\n  continued discussions, especially Jill's authority and concomitantly M&amp;T's\r\n  ability to acquire title insurance.Â  On January 15, 2008, the underwriting\r\n  counsel at Head's title company sent an email to Head, outlining his concerns\r\n  over the ability to issue title insurance.\r\nPruitt\r\n  responded by offering to issue title insurance to M&amp;T.Â  M&amp;T refused and\r\n  declared the contract terminated.Â  When Palmetto Point refused to refund the\r\n  earnest money, M&amp;T filed this action.Â  The trial court granted M&amp;T\r\n  summary judgment on the basis that its objections were reasonable and that,\r\n  pursuant to the contract, the &quot;seller â€¦ [failed to] take the necessary\r\n  steps to correct such objection.&quot;Â  This appeal followed.Â  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nWhile M&amp;T's position may prevail at trial, the record before\r\n  us presents a genuine issue of material fact and precludes summary judgment.Â  \r\nThat M&amp;T was concerned about acquiring good title and title\r\n  insurance is undeniable.Â  In the November 28, 2007, letter to Pruitt, Head\r\n  wrote that &quot;my client is . . . highly concerned about receiving good title\r\n  to the property and whether the title is insurable.&quot;Â  The record, however,\r\n  contains evidence that title insurance was available.Â  Ray L. Derrick, Underwriting and Claims Counsel for the Security Title\r\n  Guarantee Corporation of Baltimore, Maryland, submitted an affidavit that the title was insurable.Â  Furthermore, Pruitt\r\n  testified that he would have issued title insurance to M&amp;T for the amount\r\n  of the purchase price.Â  M&amp;T countered this evidence with a memorandum from\r\n  its title insurance company stating title insurance was not available.Â  Whether\r\n  the seller took the &quot;necessary steps to correct such objection&quot; is a\r\n  question of fact.\r\nTherefore, we reverse the order granting summary judgment and\r\n  remand for trial.[1]Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We do not reach\r\n  the remaining issues.\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26911","title":"SCDOT v.

Weaver, of Office of Horry County Administrator, of Conway, for Defendants.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: The\r\n  South Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT) filed a declaratory\r\n  judgment action, seeking a determination that it had a valid easement across\r\n  the Graingers' (Appellants) land.Â  The special referee found SCDOT does hold a\r\n  valid easement, and this appeal followed.\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nBy way of a deed\r\n  executed in 1924, the Burroughs &amp; Chapin Co. (B&amp;C) conveyed a 400 feet\r\n  by 700 feet easement over a parcel of land to Horry County for the purposes of\r\n  &quot;laying out and opening, widening and relocating&quot; Pee Dee Road.[1]Â \r\n  In August 1930, Horry County conveyed this easement to the state highway\r\n  department.[2]Â \r\n  In September 1930, B&amp;C conveyed a 75 feet wide easement over the same\r\n  parcel to the State for the construction of a different state highway project.Â  \r\nIn 1979, Horry\r\n  County gave B&amp;C a quitclaim deed, purporting to transfer its interest in\r\n  the 1924 easement back to B&amp;C.[3]Â \r\n  The deed references the 1924 transaction between Horry County and B&amp;C, but\r\n  makes no mention of Horry County's transfer to the state highway department in\r\n  1930.Â  In 1985, B&amp;C conveyed Appellants portions of the parcel; their deeds\r\n  made no mention of an easement across their property.Â  Appellants did not\r\n  conduct title examinations until seeking mortgages to construct residences upon\r\n  the properties.Â  The examinations missed the 1930 grant of the easement to the\r\n  highway department, although it was in the chain of title. Â Â Â Â Â Â  In 2006,\r\n  SCDOT notified Appellants that it was planning to replace an existing bridge\r\n  and was going to relocate the access road, which meant coming through the\r\n  properties occupied by the Appellants.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  claim this is the first they knew of the easement, and that they had no way of\r\n  knowing about the easement before SCDOT notified them of its intentions.Â  SCDOT\r\n  ultimately filed a declaratory judgment action against Appellants and other\r\n  defendants.Â  Appellants filed cross-claims against B&amp;C and others.Â  All\r\n  parties agreed that the declaratory judgment action should be adjudicated\r\n  first, with all other claims held in abeyance.Â  The declaratory judgment action\r\n  was referred to a master-in-equity, who was unable to hear the case due to a\r\n  medical condition.Â  The parties then agreed to have the case heard by a special\r\n  referee.Â  Former circuit court judge John Smith sat as a special referee for\r\n  the non-jury trial of this matter, and issued a decision holding that SCDOT\r\n  obtained title to the valid easement in 1930, and theories of adverse\r\n  possession, presumption of a grant, equitable estoppel, and abandonment do not\r\n  operate to deprive SCDOT of its title.Â  \r\nÂ Issues\r\nAppellants present\r\n  the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;I. \r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err in finding a valid \r\n\t\t\teasement was created by the 1924 deed from B&amp;C to Horry County?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t&nbsp;II. \r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err in not finding a public \r\n\t\t\tdedication?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err in holding equitable \r\n\t\t\testoppel did not deprive SCDOT of its rights to the easement?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the special referee err in holding the doctrine \r\n\t\t\tof presumption of grant did not deprive SCDOT of its\r\n  rights to the easement?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nDeclaratory judgment actions are neither legal nor equitable; therefore, the standard\r\n  of review depends upon the nature of the underlying issues.Â  Judy v. Martin,\r\n  381 S.C. 455, 458, 674 S.E.2d 151, 153&nbsp;(2009).Â  &quot;In an action at law tried\r\n  without a jury, an appellate\r\n  courtâ€™s scope of review extends merely to the correction of errors\r\n  of law.&quot;Â  Temple v. Tec-Fab, Inc., 381 S.C. 597, 599-600, 675\r\n  S.E.2d 414, 415&nbsp;(2009).Â  This Court will not disturb the trial courtâ€™s factual\r\n  findings unless they are without evidence reasonably supporting those\r\n  findings.Â  Id.Â  In equitable actions, an appellate court may find facts\r\n  in accordance with its own view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Denman\r\n    v. City of Columbia,&nbsp;387 S.C. 131, 140, 691 S.E.2d 465,\r\n  470&nbsp;(2010).Â  &quot;When legal and equitable actions are maintained in one\r\n  suit, each retains its own identity as legal or equitable for purposes of the\r\n  applicable standard of review on appeal.&quot; Â Kiriakides v. Atlas Food Sys.\r\n    &amp; Servs., Inc.,&nbsp; 338 S.C. 572, 580, 527 S.E.2d 371, 375&nbsp;(Ct. App.\r\n  2000) (citing Corley v. Ott, 326 S.C. 89, 92, n.1, 485 S.E.2d 97, 99, n.1\r\n  (1997)).\r\n\r\nAnalysis\r\nI.&nbsp; Existence of the Easement\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the special referee erred in finding a valid easement because the\r\n  language in the 1924 deed was too vague to create an easement.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law\r\n  action and subject to an &quot;any evidence&quot; standard of review when tried\r\n  by a judge without a jury.Â  Hardy v. Aiken,&nbsp;369 S.C. 160, 165, 631\r\n  S.E.2d 539, 541&nbsp;(2006).Â  Therefore, this Court will not overturn a trial\r\n  court's finding that an easement exists unless that conclusion is controlled by\r\n  an error of law or without evidentiary support.Â  See S.C. Const. art. V,\r\n  Â§ 5 (providing this state's appellate courts have jurisdiction to correct trial\r\n  court's erroneous legal findings in law and equity cases); Hardy, 369\r\n  S.C. at 165, 631 S.E.2d at 541.\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the 1924 deed did not describe the boundaries of the easement adequately\r\n  to create a valid easement.Â  The special referee, however, found the deed gives\r\n  the dimensions of the easement and sufficiently refers to the boundaries.Â  See Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershead, 348 S.C. 58, 72, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909\r\n  (Ct. App. 2001) (&quot;It is not essential to the validity of a grant of an\r\n  easement that it be described by metes and bounds or by figures giving definite\r\n  dimensions of the easement.&quot;).Â  The special referee's findings are\r\n  supported by evidence in the record; therefore, the special referee did not err\r\n  in concluding a valid easement was created by the 1924 deed.\r\nThe\r\n  special referee then found that because the 1924 deed created a valid easement,\r\n  and because Horry County conveyed that easement to the state highway department\r\n  in 1930, Horry County did not have title to the easement when it gave B&amp;C a\r\n  quitclaim deed in 1979.Â  Therefore, SCDOT retains valid title to the easement.Â  \r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Public Dedication\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that if the 1924 deed created a valid easement, then that easement was\r\n  dedicated to the public, and the law of dedication requires the dedication be\r\n  construed in the least restrictive manner.Â  Therefore, the Appellants argue,\r\n  the special referee erred in not finding and restrictively construing the\r\n  easement as a public dedication.Â  The special referee, however, made no\r\n  findings as to public dedication, and there is nothing in the record to show\r\n  Appellants made any post-trial motions regarding this issue.Â  Thus, we find\r\n  this issue has not been preserved for review by this Court.Â  See S.C. Dept.\r\n    of Transp. v. First Carolina Corp. of S.C., 372 S.C. 295, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  903 (2007) (an issue must be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge to be\r\n  preserved for appellate review); Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359\r\n  S.C. 505, 598 S.E2d 712 (2004) (issue may not be raised for the first time on\r\n  appeal). \r\nIII.&nbsp; Equitable Estoppel\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue SCDOT is estopped from asserting its right to the easement. Â We disagree. \r\nAs a\r\n  general rule, estoppel does not lie against the government to prevent the due\r\n  exercise of its police power or to thwart the application of public policy.Â  Grant\r\n    v. City of Folly Beach, 346 S.C. 74, 80-81, 551 S.E.2d 229, 232&nbsp;(2001).\r\n  Â To prove estoppel against the government, the relying party must prove: (1) the\r\n  lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth of the facts in\r\n  question; (2) justifiable reliance upon the government's conduct; and (3) a\r\n  prejudicial change in position. Â Id.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  special referee found that the 1924 deed creating the easement was properly\r\n  recorded and indexed and that Appellants had constructive notice of the\r\n  easement.Â  The special referee relied heavily upon Binkley v. Rabon Creek\r\n    Watershead, 348 S.C. 58, 558 S.E.2d 902 (Ct. App. 2001) in reaching his\r\n  conclusion.Â  In Binkley, the homeowners challenged the scope of a\r\n  flowage easement, claiming the easement did not allow for the flooding of their\r\n  lands past a certain point.Â  The Binkley court found the recording of\r\n  the easement gave the homeowners at least constructive notice of the extent of\r\n  the easement, which in fact did allow for the flooding that occurred.Â \r\n  Therefore, the homeowners failed to satisfy the first element of equitable\r\n  estoppel: the lack of knowledge, and the means of knowledge, of the truth of\r\n  the facts in question.Â  Id. at 71, 558 S.E.2d at 909 (&quot;A properly\r\n  recorded title normally precludes an equitable estoppel against assertion of\r\n  that title due to the requirement that the party raising the estoppel be\r\n  ignorant of the true state of title or reasonable means of discovering\r\n  it.&quot;) (cited with approval in Boyd v. BellSouth Tel. Tel. Co., 369\r\n  S.C. 410, 423, 633 S.E.2d 136, 142 (2006)).\r\nIn\r\n  this case, the deed creating the easement was properly recorded; thus,\r\n  Appellants had constructive notice of the easement, regardless of their legally\r\n  unfounded argument that finding the deed in question would be like\r\n  &quot;finding a needle in a haystack.&quot;Â  See Binkley, 348 S.C. at\r\n  71, 558 S.E.2d at 909 (&quot;Property owners are charged with constructive\r\n  notice of instruments recorded in their chain of title.&quot; (citing Carolina\r\n    Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 107, 217 S.E.2d 16, 20 (1975))).Â  Mere\r\n  silence or acquiescence will not work an estoppel when the party seeking\r\n  estoppel has constructive notice of the public records that disclose the true\r\n  facts.Â  Binkley, 348 S.C. at 74, 558 S.E.2d at 909.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  special referee properly ruled that SCDOT was not estopped from asserting its\r\n  rights to the easement.Â Â  \r\nIV.&nbsp; Presumption of Grant \r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the special referee erred in failing to distinguish between the doctrines\r\n  of adverse possession and presumption of grant, and in failing to apply\r\n  presumption of grant to the facts of this case.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  special referee found no difference between the operation of the doctrines of\r\n  adverse possession and presumption of grant in this case.Â  Therefore, because\r\n  rights may not be gained against the State by adverse possession, the special\r\n  referee found Appellants' argument on this point fails.Â  Appellants rely on\r\n  section 15-3-310 of the South Carolina Code[4] as the basis for their argument.Â  This section, Appellants' argue, requires the\r\n  State to bring an action to settle title to real estate within twenty years of\r\n  the action accruing.Â  However, this Court has held this bar is predicated upon\r\n  &quot;a presumption of possession which follows the establishment of legal\r\n  title.&quot;Â  State v. Fain, 273 S.C. 748, 755, 259 S.E.2d 606, 609\r\n  (1979) (relying upon State v. Yelson Land Co., 265 S.C. 78, 216 S.E.2d\r\n  876 (1975)).Â  The Fain court held that because the grants at issue did\r\n  not convey title to the disputed property, no basis existed for the party's\r\n  assertion of the bar of section 15-3-310.Â  Similarly, in this case, Appellants\r\n  did not receive title to the easement because it remained with SCDOT.Â \r\n  Therefore, Appellants cannot claim section 15-3-310 as a bar to SCDOT's action,\r\n  and the special referee did not err in failing to apply presumption of grant.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe\r\n  recognize this is a harsh result for the Appellants.Â  While we are sympathetic\r\n  to their situation, this case concerns a purely legal issue and equitable\r\n  principles simply are not applicable.Â  We are mindful that our decision does\r\n  not end this litigation but only answers one question, and that the underlying\r\n  case will be fully litigated and all parties' rights and obligations will be properly\r\n  determined.Â  The special referee's order is affirmed.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] This deed was recorded in the Office of Register of Mesne Conveyances for Horry\r\n  County on December 11, 1924 in Deed Book B5 at page 351.\r\n[2] This deed was recorded in the Office of Register of Mesne Conveyances for Horry\r\n  County on August 18, 1930 in Deed Book U5 at page 289.\r\n[3] This deed was recorded in the Office of Register of Mesne Conveyances for Horry\r\n  County on November 2, 1979 in Deed Book 658 at page 498.\r\n[4] This section provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tThe State will not sue any person\r\n  for or in respect to any real property . . . by reason of the right or title of\r\n  the State to the same unless: \r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such\r\n  right or title shall have accrued within twenty years before any action or\r\n  other proceeding for the same shall be commenced . . . .\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26912","title":"Henry-Davenport v.

Brown, all of Charleston, for\r\n  Defendant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  We certified the\r\n  following question from the United States District Court for the District of\r\n  South Carolina:\r\n\r\n\tDoes\r\n  South Carolina law, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-24-15, afford a certified\r\n  educator employed as an administrator rights as available under the Teacher\r\n  Employment and Dismissal Act when she is denied a hearing to contest her\r\n  administrative demotion and salary reduction?\r\n\r\nWe answer the question,\r\n  &quot;no.&quot;[1]Â  \r\nI.\r\nA.\r\nSection\r\n  59-24-15 was enacted as part of the South Carolina Educational Accountability\r\n  Act of 1998.Â  Act No. 400, 1998 S.C. Acts 2416.Â  Section 59-24-15 provides:\r\n\r\n\tCertified\r\n  education personnel who are employed as administrators on an annual or\r\n  multi-year contract will retain their rights as a teacher under the provisions\r\n  of Article 3 of Chapter 19 and Article 5 of Chapter 25 of this title but\r\n    no such rights are granted to the position or salary of administrator.\r\n  Any such administrator who presently is under a contract granting such rights\r\n  shall retain that status until the expiration of that contract. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  district court certified the question because this Court has not addressed the\r\n  effect of section 59-24-15 on this Court's 1994 decision in Johnson v.\r\n    Spartanburg County School Dist. No. 7, 314 S.C. 340, 444 S.E.2d 501 (1994).\r\n  Â We hold the legislature, in enacting section 59-24-15, overruled Johnson.\r\nB.\r\nBy\r\n  way of background, this Court interpreted the hearing requirements and\r\n  procedural protections in the Teacher Employment and Dismissal Act (Teacher\r\n  Act) in two cases prior to the enactment of section 59-24-15.Â  First, in Snipes\r\n    v. McAndrew, 280 S.C. 320, 313 S.E.2d 294&nbsp; (1984), Respondents Ralph Snipes\r\n  and Alvin Shaw were principals in Richland County School District One.Â  Id. at 321, 313 S.E.2d at 295.Â  Both respondents were notified that they would be\r\n  demoted from their positions as principals for the 1981-82 school year, but the\r\n  school district did not reduce their salaries.Â  Id. at 322, 313 S.E.2d\r\n  at 295-96.Â  Neither respondent was afforded a hearing on the demotion.Â  The\r\n  respondents challenged their demotions, arguing that they were &quot;dismissed\r\n  or nonrenewed as principals&quot; and &quot;were entitled to a full,\r\n  adversarial hearing as provided&quot; by section 59-25-460 of the Teacher Act.Â  Id., 313 S.E.2d at 296.Â  This Court disagreed, stating:\r\n\r\n\tThe [Teacher]\r\n  Act provides for a full, adversarial hearing when a teacher is dismissed or\r\n  nonrenewed . . . . Nowhere does it provide for a full, adversarial hearing when\r\n  a teacher is merely transferred, reassigned, or demoted. We are of the opinion\r\n  that policy decisions concerning where an employee will best serve the school\r\n  district are better left to school officials, not the courts. Unless the\r\n  legislature decides to require full, adversarial hearings for teachers upon\r\n  their transfer, reassignment, or demotion to another certificated position,\r\n  this Court will not require such a hearing.\r\n\r\nId., 313 S.E.2d at 296 (internal citations omitted).Â Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  1994, this Court decided Johnson.Â  Respondent Spencer Johnson was an\r\n  assistant principal in Spartanburg School District No. 7.Â  Johnson also earned\r\n  extra income from the school district by managing its facility rental.Â  314\r\n  S.C. at 341, 444 S.E.2d at 501.Â  Subsequently, the school district did not\r\n  renew Johnson's contract as a principal and no longer employed him as rental\r\n  coordinator.Â  Id., 444 S.E.2d at 502.Â  The nonrenewal resulted in a\r\n  $16,000 pay cut for Johnson.Â  Id., 444 S.E.2d at 502.\r\nWe\r\n  distinguished Johnson's case from the result in Snipes, noting that Snipes concerned a loss of position, whereas Johnson suffered a loss of\r\n  wages.Â  Id. at 343, 444 S.E.2d at 502.Â  The Court held that the\r\n  corresponding loss of wages was an injustice that violated the Teacher Act's\r\n  procedural safeguards.Â  Id. at 343-44, 444 S.E.2d at 503.\r\nTurning\r\n  to section 59-24-15, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\n  ascertain and give effect to the intent of the legislature.Â  Kiriakides v.\r\n    United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312 S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366\r\n  (1994) (&quot;All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one\r\n  that the legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in\r\n  the language used.&quot;) Â If a statute's language is plain,\r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning, &quot;the rules of statutory\r\n  interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another\r\n  meaning.&quot;Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582\r\n  (2000).Â  We believe the 1998 enactmentâ€”specifically the provision &quot;but no\r\n  such rights are granted to the position or salary of administrator&quot;â€”is\r\n  clear and manifestly reflects legislative intent to expressly exclude such\r\n  rights to an administrator. Â See, e.g., State v. 192 Coin-Operated\r\n    Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 188, 525 S.E.2d 872, 879 (2000) (stating\r\n  that the legislature is presumed to be aware of this Court's interpretation of\r\n  its statutes).Â  Â \r\nThe legislature\r\n  enacted section 59-24-15 after the Johnson decision, and the plain\r\n  language of the statute directly contradicts the holding in Johnson.Â  The\r\n  statute plainly states that an administrator has no rights in her &quot;position\r\n  or salary,&quot; and the legislature made no exception or distinction\r\n  concerning the administrator's status as a certified educator.Â  \r\nII.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to section 59-24-15, while a certified educator who is employed as an\r\n  administrator on an annual or multi-year contract retains her rights as a\r\n  teacher under the Teacher Act, those rights are not granted to the position or\r\n  salary of administrator. Â We answer the certified question, &quot;no.&quot; \r\nCERTIFIED QUESTION ANSWERED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice Howard King, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; We answer only the narrow legal question\r\n  presented.Â  We understand the federal court complaint contains other causes of\r\n  action, which are not before us.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26913","title":"Travelscape v.

Â After the customer checks out of the\r\n  hotel, the hotel invoices Travelscape for the net room rate as well as sales\r\n  tax owed by the hotel.Â  Travelscape then remits the net room rate and tax\r\n  recovery charge to the hotel.Â  Travelscape retains the facilitation and service\r\n  fees and does not pay sales tax on these fees.Â  \r\nThe Department of\r\n  Revenue (&quot;Department&quot;) conducted an audit of Travelscape's records\r\n  for the period of July 1, 2001 through June 30, 2006.Â  The Department\r\n  determined Travelscape was required to pay a sales tax of seven percent on the\r\n  gross proceeds received from furnishing hotel accommodations in South Carolina.[3]Â \r\n  Thereafter, the Department issued Travelscape an assessment and penalty in the\r\n  amount of $6,376,454.71.Â  Travelscape filed a timely request for a contested\r\n  case hearing before the ALC in accordance with section 12-60-460 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2009).Â  Following a two-day hearing, the ALC issued a\r\n  final order, finding Travelscape was required to pay the tax but not required\r\n  to pay the penalties imposed by the Department.[4]Â  This appeal followed. \r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court's standard\r\n  of review is set forth in section 1-23-610(B) of the South Carolina Code (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  That section provides: \r\n\r\n\tThe review of the administrative law judge's order\r\n  must be confined to the record.Â  The court may not substitute its judgment for\r\n  the judgment of the administrative law judge as to the weight of the evidence\r\n  on questions of fact.Â  The court . . . may affirm the decision or remand the\r\n  case for further proceedings; or it may reverse or modify the decision if the\r\n  substantive rights of the petitioner have been prejudiced because the finding,\r\n  conclusion, or decision is:\r\n\t(a)&nbsp; in\r\n  violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\t(b)&nbsp; in\r\n  excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\t(c)&nbsp; made\r\n  upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\t(d)&nbsp; affected\r\n  by other error of law;\r\n\t(e)&nbsp; clearly\r\n  erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence on the\r\n  whole record; or\r\n\t(f)&nbsp; arbitrary\r\n  or capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion.Â  Â Â Â \r\n\r\nId.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; APPLICABILITY OF ACCOMMODATIONS TAX\r\nWe begin our analysis in\r\n  this case by focusing on the statutory scheme of section 12-36-920.Â  Both\r\n  parties agree, and the ALC found, that section 12-36-920 is divided into two\r\n  relevant parts.Â  Section 12-36-920(A) sets forth what is subject to the taxâ€”&quot;the\r\n  gross proceeds derived from the rental or charges for any rooms . . . or sleeping\r\n  accommodations furnished to transients by any hotel . . . or any place\r\n  in which rooms, lodgings, or sleeping accommodations are furnished to\r\n  transients for a consideration.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  In turn, section\r\n  12-36-920(E) establishes who is subject to the taxâ€”&quot;every person engaged .\r\n  . . in the business of furnishing accommodations to transients for\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Therefore, the task before us is to\r\n  harmonize these two provisions and determine whether the service and\r\n  facilitation fees are gross proceeds derived from the furnishing of sleeping\r\n  accommodations and, if so, whether Travelscape is engaged in the business of\r\n  furnishing these accommodations.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Service\r\n  and Facilitation Fees\r\nTravelscape contends it\r\n  is not required to pay sales tax on the service and facilitation fees it\r\n  retains because such fees are &quot;derived from&quot; the services it provides,\r\n  not from the rental charge for the hotel room.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nSection 12-36-920(A) of\r\n  the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2009) imposes a seven percent sales tax on\r\n  &quot;the gross proceeds derived from the rental or charges for any rooms . . . furnished to transients by any . . . place in which rooms, lodgings, or\r\n  sleeping accommodations are furnished to transients for consideration.&quot;Â \r\n  (emphasis added).Â  In the definition section of the South Carolina Sales and\r\n  Use Tax Act, the legislature defined the term &quot;gross proceeds of sale&quot;\r\n  and &quot;any similar term&quot; as &quot;the value proceeding or accruing from\r\n  the sale, lease, or rental of tangible personal property . . . without\r\n  any deduction for . . . the cost of materials, labor, or service.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann.Â  Â§ 12-36-90(1)(b)(ii) (emphasis added).[5]Â  \r\n&quot;The cardinal rule\r\n  of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  legislature.&quot;Â  Hardee v. McDowell, 381 S.C. 445, 453, 673 S.E.2d\r\n  813, 817 (2009) (internal quotation omitted).Â  Where the statute's language is\r\n  plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear, definite meaning, the rules of\r\n  statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose\r\n  another meaning.Â  Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 345, 673 S.E.2d 418, 420\r\n  (2009).Â  \r\nIn our view, the fees\r\n  charged by Travelscape for its services are subject to sales tax under the\r\n  plain language of section 12-36-920(A) as gross proceeds.Â  Section 12-36-920(A)\r\n  imposes the tax on the &quot;gross proceeds derived from the rental or\r\n  charges for any room.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  In section 12-36-90(1)(b), the\r\n  legislature specifically stated the definition of &quot;gross proceeds of\r\n  sales&quot; applies to any similar term as well.Â  S.C. Code Ann.Â  Â§\r\n  12-36-90(1)(b).Â  We find the term gross proceeds as used in section\r\n  12-36-920(A) is a similar term to gross proceeds of sales.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  definition of gross proceeds of sales also applies to gross proceeds.[6]Â  Accordingly,\r\n  &quot;gross proceeds&quot; under section 12-36-920(A) includes the value\r\n  obtained from the rental of accommodations without deduction for the cost of\r\n    services.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-90(1)(b)(ii).Â  Because the cost of\r\n  services is specifically included in the definition of gross proceeds of sales,\r\n  we find the fees retained by Travelscape for its services are taxable as gross\r\n  proceeds.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp; Application\r\n  to Travelscape\r\nSection 12-36-920(E) imposes the\r\n  Accommodations Tax &quot;on every person engaged or continuing within this\r\n  State in the business of furnishing accommodations to transients for\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  Travelscape argues it is not subject to the Accommodations\r\n  Tax because it:Â  (A) is not engaged in the business of furnishing\r\n  accommodations, and (B) does not conduct business within the State.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Furnishing\r\n  Accommodations\r\nTravelscape first\r\n  asserts it is not engaged in the business of furnishing accommodations because\r\n  it neither owns nor operates hotels.Â  According to Travelscape, the ordinary\r\n  and commonplace understanding of the term &quot;furnish,&quot; as well as the\r\n  manner that the term is used throughout section 12-36-920, demonstrates that\r\n  the term carries with it the connotation of physically providing sleeping\r\n  accommodations to customers.Â  Because Travelscape is only an intermediary\r\n  providing hotel reservations to transients and does not physically provide\r\n  sleeping accommodations, Travelscape contends it is not subject to the\r\n  Accommodations Tax.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;A statute as a\r\n  whole must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant\r\n  with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers.&quot;Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd.\r\n    of Physical Therapy Examiners, 370 S.C. 452, 468, 636 S.E.2d 598, 606\r\n  (2006).Â  When faced with an undefined statutory term, the Court must interpret\r\n  the term in accordance with its usual and customary meaning.Â  Branch v. City\r\n    of Myrtle Beach, 340 S.C. 405, 409-10, 532 S.E.2d 289, 292 (2000).Â  Courts\r\n  should consider not merely the language of the particular clause being\r\n  construed, but the undefined word and its meaning in conjunction with the whole\r\n  purpose of the statute and the policy of the law.Â  Whitner v. State, 328\r\n  S.C. 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997).Â  \r\nThe United States District Court for the\r\n  District of South Carolina considered a similar argument in City of\r\n    Charleston, S.C. v. Hotels.com, 520 F.Supp.2d 757 (D.S.C. 2007).Â  In that\r\n  case, the city of Charleston and town of Mount Pleasant passed nearly identical\r\n  local accommodations tax ordinances imposing a sales tax on the gross proceeds\r\n  derived from the rental of any accommodations within municipal boundaries.Â  Id. at 762.Â  Charleston and Mount Pleasant alleged several internet travel\r\n  companies violated the ordinances by only remitting taxes based on the net rate\r\n  negotiated with hotels, instead of the marked-up price actually charged to\r\n  customers on their websites.Â  Id. at 762-63.Â  The legislature enabled municipalities\r\n  to pass a &quot;local accommodations tax&quot; by enacting section 6-1-520(A)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code (2004).Â  In section 6-1-510(1), the legislature defined\r\n  &quot;local accommodations tax&quot; as &quot;a tax on the gross proceeds derived\r\n  from the rental or charges for accommodations furnished to transients as\r\n  provided in Section 12-36-920(A) and which is imposed on every person engaged .\r\n  . . in the business of furnishing accommodations to transients for\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  (emphasis added).Â  Like Travelscape in this case, the\r\n  internet travel companies argued Charleston and Mount Pleasant lacked the power\r\n  to impose the tax on them because they were not engaged in the business of\r\n  furnishing accommodations.Â  Hotels.com, 520 F.Supp.2d at 767.Â  Â \r\nThe district court\r\n  rejected this argument.Â  In doing so, the district court found the ordinary meaning\r\n  of the term &quot;furnish&quot; was &quot;to supply what is needed for an\r\n  activity or purpose.&quot;Â  Id. at 768 (citing Webster's II New\r\n    College Dictionary 454 (2d ed. 1999)).Â  The district court further noted\r\n  &quot;[t]he core purpose of the Ordinances is to levy a tax on the amount of\r\n  money visitors to the municipality spend on their hotel rooms or other\r\n  accommodations.&quot;Â  Id. at 768.Â  With this purpose in mind and with reference\r\n  to the common understanding of the term furnish, the district court noted its\r\n  inquiry was directed not at determining who was physically providing sleeping\r\n  accommodations, but rather on who was accepting money in exchange for supplying\r\n  the room.Â  Id.Â  Accordingly, the district court denied the travel\r\n  companies' motion to dismiss.Â  Id.\r\nAs a general rule,\r\n  &quot;identical words and phrases within the same statute should normally be\r\n  given the same meaning.&quot;Â  Powerex Corp. v. Reliant Energy Serv., Inc.,\r\n  551 U.S. 224, 232, 127 S.Ct. 2411, 2417 (2007).Â  The South Carolina Court of\r\n  Appeals has long recognized a similar rule.Â  See e.g. Busby v.\r\n    State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 280 S.C. 330, 333, 312 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1984) (citing Pampanga Sugar Mills v. Trinidad, 279 U.S. 211, 218,\r\n  49 S.Ct. 308, 310 (1929)) (&quot;Where the same word is used more than once in\r\n  a statute it is presumed to have the same meaning throughout unless a different\r\n  meaning is necessary to avoid an absurd result.&quot;).Â  This Court has held\r\n  that words in a statute must be construed in context, and their meaning may be\r\n  ascertained by reference to words associated with them in the statute.Â  Eagle\r\n    Container Co., LLC v. Cty. of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 571, 666 S.E.2d 892,\r\n  895 (2008).\r\nTravelscape is correct\r\n  in pointing out that &quot;furnish&quot; as used in subsection (A) invokes the\r\n  connotation of physically providing sleeping accommodations to customers.Â \r\n  Indeed, the American Heritage Dictionary defines &quot;furnish&quot; as &quot;[t]o\r\n  equip with what is needed&quot; and to &quot;supply&quot; or &quot;give.&quot; Am.\r\n    Heritage Dictionary 540 (2d College Ed. 1982).Â  Relying on Powerex,\r\n  Travelscape argues the term &quot;furnish&quot; as used in subsection (E)\r\n  should be read consonant with its use in subsection (A).Â  We agree.Â  As used in\r\n  subsection (E), &quot;furnish&quot; does mean to physically provide sleeping\r\n  accommodations.Â  However, Travelscape's argument ignores the antecedent\r\n  language in (E) that it applies to all persons &quot;engaged . . . in the\r\n  business of&quot; furnishing accommodations.Â  &quot;Business&quot; includes\r\n  &quot;all activities, with the object of gain, profit, benefit, or advantage,\r\n  either direct or indirect.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-20 (2000). Â Accordingly,\r\n  we find the context of &quot;furnish&quot; as it appears in subsection (E)\r\n  demonstrates that it encompasses the activities of entities such as Travelscape\r\n  who, whether directly or indirectly, provide hotel reservations to transients\r\n  for consideration.Â  Contrary to the dissent's view, we do not read the term\r\n  &quot;furnish&quot; differently in subsection (E) than we do in (A).Â  Instead,\r\n  we interpret subsection (E) in such a manner as to give effect to all the\r\n  language contained thereinâ€”particularly that the entity be &quot;engaged . . .\r\n  in the business of&quot; furnishing accommodationsâ€”rather than focusing on the\r\n  term &quot;furnish&quot; in isolation.Â  While Travelscape does not physically\r\n  provide accommodations, it is in the business of doing so.\r\nThe legislative purpose\r\n  of section 12-36-920 supports such a finding.Â  Whitner, 328 S.C. at 6,\r\n  492 S.E.2d at 779.Â  In Hotels.com, the district court found the purpose\r\n  of the ordinances, which were based on section 12-36-920, was to &quot;levy a\r\n  tax on the amount of money visitors to the municipality spend on their hotel\r\n  rooms or other accommodations.&quot;Â  520 F.Supp.2d at 768.Â  In our view, the\r\n  legislative purpose of section 12-36-920 is identical.Â  The application of the\r\n  tax to &quot;every person engaged . . . in the business of furnishing\r\n  accommodations&quot; also reveals that the legislature intended to levy the tax\r\n  not merely on those physically providing sleeping accommodations, but on those\r\n  entities who were accepting money in exchange for supplying hotel rooms.Â \r\n  Additionally, section 12-36-920(C) specifically dispels the notion that the tax\r\n  is imposed only on those entities physically providing the sleeping\r\n  accommodations.Â  Subsection (C) establishes that the tax is also assessed\r\n  against real estate agents, brokers, corporations, and listing services.Â \r\n  Therefore, we find the legislative purpose of subsection (E) and the context of\r\n  the term &quot;furnish&quot; in that subsection demonstrates that Travelscape\r\n  is subject to the Accommodations Tax because it is &quot;engaged . . . in the\r\n  business of furnishing accommodations to transients for consideration.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-920(E).\r\n2.&nbsp; Within The State\r\nNext, Travelscape\r\n  argues it is not subject to the Accommodations Tax because it is not engaged in\r\n  business in South Carolina.Â  Travelscape contends the phrase &quot;within the\r\n  State&quot; modifies &quot;every person&quot; in subsection (E) and thus\r\n  imposes the tax only on entities having a physical presence in the State.Â \r\n  Because it does not have a physical presence in South Carolina, Travelscape\r\n  asserts it is not required to remit the tax.Â  Travelscape also contends the\r\n  absence of a use tax in South Carolina and the lack of a provision dealing with\r\n  out-of-state business transactions in section 12-36-920 demonstrates that the\r\n  legislature did not intend to impose the Accommodations Tax on Travelscape.Â  We\r\n  disagree.Â Â  \r\n&quot;The taxes imposed\r\n  by this section are imposed on every person engaged or continuing within\r\n    this State in the business of furnishing accommodations to transients for\r\n  consideration.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-920(E) (emphasis added).\r\nWe find the language\r\n  and sentence structure of subsection (E) reveals that &quot;within this\r\n  State&quot; modifies the preceding terms &quot;engaged or continuing.&quot;Â  As\r\n  such, the phrase &quot;within this State&quot; imposes the sales tax on those\r\n  entities engaged or continuing in the business of furnishing accommodations in\r\n  South Carolina, without regard to whether the entities maintain offices or\r\n  otherwise reside in this State.Â  In International Harvester Co. v. Wasson,\r\n  this Court interpreted identical statutory language in the same manner.Â  281\r\n  S.C. 458, 316 S.E.2d 378 (1984).Â  The statute in Wasson imposed a sales\r\n  tax &quot;upon every person engaged or continuing within this State in\r\n  the business of selling at retail any tangible personal property.&quot;Â  Id. at 460, 316 S.E.2d at 379 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-35-510 (1976)) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  We determined the phrase &quot;within this State&quot; as found in\r\n  section 12-35-510 required the &quot;plaintiff [to be] in [the] business of\r\n  making retail sales in South Carolina.&quot;Â  Wasson, 281 S.C. at 460,\r\n  316 S.E.2d at 379.Â  We find &quot;within this State&quot; as used in section\r\n  12-36-920(E) has the same meaning.Â  In accordance with this understanding of\r\n  &quot;within the State,&quot; Travelscape will be responsible for remitting the\r\n  sales tax in question if it was engaged in the business of furnishing\r\n  accommodations in South Carolina.Â  \r\nClearly, Travelscape\r\n  was engaged in the business of furnishing accommodations in South Carolina\r\n  during the audit period, seeing as it:Â  (1) entered into contracts with\r\n  hundreds of hotels in South Carolina in which the hotels agreed to accept a\r\n  discounted price, or net rate, for reservations made on Expedia; (2) sent\r\n  employees to South Carolina for the purpose of negotiating such agreements; and\r\n  (3) booked reservations in exchange for consideration at hotels located in this\r\n  State.Â  Accordingly, we find the plain language of section 12-36-920(E) imposes\r\n  the sales tax on Travelscape because it was engaged in the business of\r\n  furnishing accommodations in South Carolina. \r\nII.&nbsp; DORMANT COMMERCE CLAUSE\r\nTravelscape\r\n  argues the imposition of the sales tax on it is an unconstitutional violation\r\n  of the Dormant Commerce Clause because the tax fails to satisfy the four-part\r\n  test announced by the United States Supreme Court in Complete Auto Transit,\r\n    Inc. v. Brady, 430 U.S. 274, 97 S.Ct. 1076 (1977).Â  We disagree. Â Â Â Â \r\nThe Commerce Clause of\r\n  the United States Constitution provides that Congress has the power to regulate\r\n  commerce among the several states.Â  U.S. Const. art. I, Â§ 8, cl. 3.Â  However,\r\n  &quot;the Commerce Clause is more than an affirmative grant of power; it has a\r\n  negative sweep as well.&quot;Â  Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S.\r\n  298, 309, 112 S.Ct. 1904, 1911 (1992).Â  Even in the absence of Congressional\r\n  regulation, the negative implications of the Commerce Clause, often referred to\r\n  as the Dormant Commerce Clause, prohibit state action that unduly burdens\r\n  interstate commerce.Â  Gen. Motors Corp. v. Tracy, 519 U.S. 278, 287, 117\r\n  S.Ct. 811, 818 (1997).Â  A state tax withstands a Dormant Commerce Clause\r\n  challenge so long as the tax (1) &quot;'is applied to an activity with a\r\n  substantial nexus with the taxing State, (2) is fairly apportioned, (3) does\r\n  not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4) is fairly related to the\r\n  services provided by the State.'&quot;Â  Quill, 504 U.S. at 311, 112\r\n  S.Ct. at 1912 (quoting Complete Auto, 430 U.S. at 279, 97 S.Ct. at\r\n  1079).Â Â  \r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Substantial\r\n  Nexus\r\nTravelscape argues it does not have a\r\n  substantial nexus with the State because its role in facilitating hotel\r\n  reservations occurs exclusively outside of South Carolina.Â  We disagree. \r\nCommerce Clause nexus,\r\n  for sales and use tax purposes, requires some physical presence within the\r\n  taxing jurisdiction.Â Â  Quill, 504 U.S. at 317, 112 S.Ct. at 1916.Â  In National\r\n    Bellas Hess, Inc. v. Department of Revenue, the Supreme Court held a state\r\n  may not impose a use tax upon a seller whose only connection with customers in\r\n  the state is by common carrier or mail.Â  386 U.S. 753, 758, 87 S.Ct. 1389, 1392\r\n  (1967).[7]Â \r\n  &quot;[T]he crucial factor governing nexus is whether the activities performed\r\n  in this state on behalf of the taxpayer are significantly associated with the\r\n  taxpayer's ability to establish and maintain a market in this state for its\r\n  sales.&quot;Â  Tyler Pipe Indus. v. Wash. State Dep't of Revenue, 483\r\n  U.S. 232, 250, 107 S.Ct. 2810, 2821 (1987) (quoting with approval Tyler Pipe\r\n    Indus. v. Wash. State Dep't of Revenue, 105 Wash.2d 318, 715 P.2d 123\r\n  (Wash. 1986)).Â  Â \r\nIn Tyler Pipe,\r\n  the State of Washington imposed a sales tax on a corporation that manufactured products\r\n  outside of Washington for in-state sale.Â  483 U.S. at 249, 107 S.Ct. at 2821.Â \r\n  The Supreme Court found the corporation had a physical presence in Washington\r\n  even though it manufactured all of its products outside the State, maintained\r\n  no offices in the State, owned no property within the State, and had no\r\n  employees residing in the State.Â  483 U.S. at 249, 107 S.Ct. at 2821.Â  The\r\n  Supreme Court reached this conclusion in light of the services provided by\r\n  non-employee in-state sales representatives. Â Id.Â  The sales\r\n  representatives provided services that were essential to the corporation's\r\n  ability to make sales in Washington, including calling customers, soliciting\r\n  orders, maintaining contacts, and providing information.Â  Id. at 250,\r\n  107 S.Ct. at 2821.Â  Based on these facts, the Supreme Court found the\r\n  corporation had a physical presence in the state for tax purposes.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nIn a similar case, the\r\n  Supreme Court found a Georgia corporation was subject to a use tax imposed by\r\n  the State of Florida in spite of the fact the corporation had no offices or\r\n  employees in Florida.Â  Scripto, Inc. v. Carson, 362 U.S. 207, 213, 80\r\n  S.Ct. 619, 622 (1960).Â  There, the corporation used independent contractors to\r\n  sell its products in Florida.Â  Id. at 211, 80 S.Ct. at 621-22.Â  Although\r\n  these &quot;salesmen&quot; were not technically employees of the corporation,\r\n  the Supreme Court found their activities within Florida on behalf of the\r\n  corporation were sufficient to satisfy the physical presence requirement.Â  Id.Â \r\n  The Court further found that the corporation's disclaimer of an agency\r\n  relationship with the independent contractors was insignificant for\r\n  constitutional purposes.Â  Id. at 211, 80 S.Ct. at 622. Â \r\nTravelscape primarily\r\n  relies on McLeod v. J.E. Dilworth Co. in support of its contention that\r\n  it does not have a substantial nexus with South Carolina.Â  322 U.S. 327, 64\r\n  S.Ct. 1023 (1944).Â  In McLeod, the State of Arkansas sought to impose a\r\n  tax on the sale of machinery and mill supplies by two Tennessee corporations to\r\n  residents of Arkansas.Â  Id. at 328, 64 S.Ct. at 1024.Â  The Tennessee\r\n  corporations did not maintain a sales office, branch plant, or any other place\r\n  of business in Arkansas.Â  Id. at 328, 64 S.Ct. at 1024.Â  Orders for the\r\n  goods came to Tennessee through solicitation in Arkansas by traveling salesmen\r\n  domiciled in Tennessee or by mail or telephone.Â  Id.Â  The goods sold to\r\n  the Arkansas residents were shipped from Tennessee, and title to the goods\r\n  passed upon delivery to a carrier located in Tennessee.Â  Id.Â  Under\r\n  these facts, the Supreme Court found the Dormant Commerce Clause prohibited\r\n  Arkansas from imposing the tax on the Tennessee corporations.Â  Id. at\r\n  331, 64 S.Ct. at 1026.Â  In our view, McLeod is distinguishable from Tyler\r\n    Pipe, Scripto, and the facts of this case because in McLeod,\r\n  the Tennessee corporations relied very little on the services of Arkansas to\r\n  facilitate the sale of its goods to Arkansas residents.Â  Therefore, we believe\r\n  Travelscape's reliance on McLeod is misplaced.Â Â  \r\nWe find Travelscape has\r\n  a sufficient physical presence in South Carolina for purposes of satisfying the\r\n  nexus requirement of the Dormant Commerce Clause.Â  Initially, contrary to\r\n  Travelscape's assertions, all of the services it provides in furnishing hotel\r\n  accommodations in South Carolina do not occur entirely in other jurisdictions. Â According\r\n  to stipulation of the parties, &quot;[e]mployees and representatives of\r\n  [Travelscape] visit South Carolina in order to enable [Travelscape] to\r\n  establish and maintain hotel relationships and obtain the discounted net room\r\n  rate for rooms booked using the www.expedia.com website.&quot;Â  This fact\r\n  standing alone may be enough to satisfy the physical presence requirement.Â \r\n  However, Travelscape's physical presence in South Carolina extends beyond\r\n  business visits of employees.Â  Travelscape enters into contracts with South\r\n  Carolina hotels for the right to offer reservations at various locations across\r\n  the state.Â  The hotels agree to accept a discounted rate for reservations made\r\n  on Expedia.Â  In turn, when a reservation is booked on Expedia, the customer actually\r\n  stays at a hotel within the state.Â  Like the corporations in Tyler Pipe and Scripto, the services provided by the hotels are significantly\r\n  associated with Travelscape's ability to establish and maintain a market in\r\n  South Carolina for its sales.[8]Â  Tyler Pipe, 483 U.S. at 250, 107 S.Ct. 2821.Â  Without the hotels\r\n  actually providing the sleeping accommodations to the customer, Travelscape\r\n  would be entirely unable to conduct business within the state.Â  For Commerce\r\n  Clause nexus purposes, it simply does not matter that Travelscape specifically\r\n  disclaims any agency relationship with the hotels in the contracts it enters\r\n  into.Â  Scripto, 362 U.S. at 211, 80 S.Ct. at 622.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  Travelscape has a physical presence within South Carolina.Â  \r\nB.&nbsp; Fairly\r\n  Apportioned \r\nIn regards to this\r\n  issue, Travelscape merely recycles the argument made above.Â  Again, Travelscape\r\n  contends because its services are performed entirely outside the state, its\r\n  activities are not subject to the Accommodations Tax.Â  We disagree.Â  Â \r\nThe purpose behind the\r\n  apportionment requirement is to ensure that each state taxes only its fair\r\n  share of an interstate transaction.Â  Goldberg v. Sweet, 488 U.S. 252,\r\n  260-61, 109 S.Ct. 582, 588 (1989).Â  A tax is fairly apportioned if it is\r\n  internally and externally consistent.Â  Id. at 261, 109 S.Ct. at 589.Â \r\n  &quot;To be internally consistent, a tax must be structured so that if every\r\n  State were to impose an identical tax, no multiple taxation would\r\n  result.&quot;Â  Id.Â  &quot;The external consistency test asks whether the\r\n  State has taxed only that portion of the revenues from the interstate activity\r\n  which reasonably reflects the in-state component of the activity being\r\n  taxed.&quot;Â  Id. at 262, 109 S.Ct. at 589. The Supreme Court has\r\n  consistently approved the taxation of sales without any division of the tax\r\n  base among different states, finding such taxes properly measurable by the\r\n  gross charge for the purchase regardless of any activity occurring outside the\r\n  taxing jurisdiction that might have preceded the sale or might occur in the\r\n  future.Â  Okla. Tax Comm'n v. Jefferson Lines, Inc., 514 U.S. 175, 186,\r\n  115 S.Ct. 1331, 1339 (1995).Â  &quot;[A]n internally consistent,\r\n  conventional sales tax has long been held to be externally consistent as\r\n  well.&quot;Â  Id. at 188, 115 S.Ct. at 1340.Â  \r\nHere, the internal and\r\n  external consistency tests are met.Â  The Accommodations Tax satisfies the\r\n  internal consistency because it imposes a tax on the gross proceeds derived\r\n  from furnishing accommodations in South Carolina.Â  If every State imposed a\r\n  similar tax on accommodations provided within its boundaries, no multiple\r\n  taxation would occur because the same accommodations cannot be furnished in two\r\n  different states at one time.Â  Having found the tax to be internally\r\n  consistent, the tax is externally consistent as well under Jefferson Lines.Â Â Â  \r\nC.&nbsp; Discrimination\r\n  Against Interstate Commerce &amp; Fairly Related To Services Provided By The\r\n  StateÂ  \r\nTravelscape argues the\r\n  Accommodations Tax discriminates against interstate commerce because the\r\n  Department has not imposed the tax on travel agents located in South Carolina.[9]Â \r\n  In addition, Travelscape asserts the tax is not fairly related to the services\r\n  provided by the State because as an out-of-state company it receives no\r\n  services from the State such as police and fire protection.Â  We find these\r\n  issues are not preserved for appellate review.\r\nInitially, we take this\r\n  opportunity to clarify our law regarding the power of an ALC to determine the\r\n  constitutionality of a statute.[10]Â \r\n  It is well settled in this State that ALCs, as part of the executive branch,\r\n  are without power to pass on the constitutional validity of a statute or\r\n  regulation. Video Gaming Consultants, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue, 342\r\n  S.C. 34, 38, 535 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2000).Â  In Video Gaming Consultants,\r\n  we said those challenges present an exception to our preservation rules and\r\n  should be raised for the first time on appeal to the circuit court. Id. at 39, 535 S.E.2d at 345.Â  However, the legislature has since amended the\r\n  process for appeals from the ALC, providing for a direct appeal to the court of\r\n  appeals instead of the circuit court. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(A) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  This procedural change results in a conundrum for litigants bringing\r\n  &quot;as-applied&quot; constitutional challenges to a statute or regulation:\r\n  they must first bring an inherently factual issue before a tribunal generally\r\n  not suited to make factual determinations.Â  While we have not addressed this\r\n  issue, the court of appeals, in a case arising before the change in the\r\n  governing statutes, said, &quot;While it is true that AL[C]s cannot rule on a\r\n  facial challenge to the constitutionality of a regulation or a statute, AL[C]s\r\n  can rule on whether a law as applied violates constitutional rights.&quot; Dorman\r\n    v. Dep't of Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 350 S.C. 159, 171, 565 S.E.2d 119,\r\n  126 (Ct. App. 2002) (citing Ward v. State, 343 S.C. 14, 18, 538 S.E.2d\r\n  245, 247 (2000)).\r\nWe find the principle\r\n  enunciated in Dorman and Ward to be sound and hold that ALCs are\r\n  empowered to hear as applied challenges to statutes and regulations.Â  ALCs are\r\n  better suited for making the factual determinations necessary for an as applied\r\n  challenge, and finding a statute or regulation unconstitutional as applied to a\r\n  specific party does not affect the facial validity of that provision.Â  We wish\r\n  to reiterate that our decision today does not affect the ALC's inability to\r\n  decide facial challenges to a statute or regulation; those are legal questions\r\n  that are properly raised for the first time on appeal or in a declaratory\r\n  judgment action before the circuit court.Â  Thus, the ALC in the case before us\r\n  had jurisdiction to determine whether section 12-36-920 violates the Dormant\r\n  Commerce Clause as applied to Travelscape.[11]Â \r\n  Accordingly, all of our preservation and exhaustion of remedies rules apply\r\n  before the ALC and other administrative tribunals with respect to an as applied\r\n  challenge.Â  \r\nThe ALC did not rule on\r\n  arguments relating to the final two elements of the Complete Auto test\r\n  in its final order.Â  See Lucas v. Rawl Family Ltd. P'ship, 359\r\n  S.C. 505, 510-11, 598 S.E.2d 712, 715 (2004) (stating generally, an issue must\r\n  be raised to and ruled upon by the trial court in order to be preserved for\r\n  appellate review).Â  As such, it was incumbent upon Travelscape to make a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion.Â  See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 77, 497\r\n  S.E.2d 731, 734 (1998) (noting that proper use of a Rule 59(e) motion is to\r\n  preserve issues raised to but not ruled upon by the trial court); Walsh v.\r\n    Woods, 371 S.C. 319, 325, 638 S.E.2d 85, 88 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  Because\r\n  Travelscape failed to do so, we find these issues are not preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  See State v. Powers, 331 S.C. 37, 42, 501 S.E.2d 116,\r\n  118 (1998) (finding Constitutional arguments are no exception to the error\r\n  preservation rule).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find section 12-36-920 imposes a sales\r\n  tax on the gross proceeds received by Travelscape in exchange for furnishing\r\n  hotel accommodations in South Carolina.Â  Additionally, we find the imposition\r\n  of the sales tax on Travelscape does not violate the Dormant Commerce Clause.Â \r\n  Accordingly, the decision of the ALC is:\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and Acting\r\n  Justice James E. Moore, concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â \r\n  I respectfully dissent.Â  I am not persuaded that the legislature intended S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-920 to include the separate fee charged by intermediaries,\r\n  such as Travelscape, in the seven percent sales tax &quot;imposed on the gross\r\n  proceeds derived from the rental or charges for any rooms . . . or sleeping\r\n  accommodations furnished to transients by any hotel . . . .&quot;Â  Accordingly,\r\n  I would reverse the administrative law court.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nTravelscape is\r\n  an international company which operates primarily as an internet facilitator of\r\n  hotel reservations.Â  Travelscape does not provide accommodations to the\r\n  customer.Â  Instead, Travelscape negotiates favorable rates with hotel chains.Â \r\n  A Travelscape customer receives the benefit of the reduced rate and pays a fee\r\n  to Travelscape for handling the transaction, all of which is spelled out in the\r\n  agreement between Travelscape and the customer.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nFor hotel\r\n  reservations in South Carolina, a seven percent sales tax is collected on that\r\n  portion of proceeds derived from the rental of the hotel room.Â  The question\r\n  before us is whether the legislature intended the statutory seven percent sales\r\n  tax to reach the separate fee charged by Travelscape for the service it\r\n  provides.Â  I do not believe the statute unambiguously answers this question.Â \r\n  Because it is not clear as to whether Travelscape is subject to Â§ 12-36-920, we\r\n  must resort to the rules of statutory construction.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-36-920 (Supp. 2009) provides in relevant part:\r\n  \t\r\n\t(A)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A sales tax\r\n    equal to seven percent is imposed on the gross proceeds derived from the rental\r\n    or charges for any rooms, campground spaces, lodgings, or sleeping\r\n    accommodations furnished to transients by any hotel, inn, tourist court,\r\n    tourist camp, motel, campground, residence, or any place in which rooms,\r\n    lodgings, or sleeping accommodations are furnished to transients for\r\n    consideration . . . . \r\n\t. . . \r\n\t(E)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The taxes\r\n    imposed by this section are imposed on every person engaged or continuing\r\n    within this State in the business of furnishing accommodations to transients\r\n    for consideration.\r\n\r\n  \r\nI begin with the\r\n  word &quot;furnish&quot; as it is used in Â§ 12-36-920.Â  Section 12-36-920(A)\r\n  describes what fees are subject to the tax, while Â§ 12-36-920(E) describes who\r\n  is subject to the tax.Â  As the majority acknowledges, the word &quot;furnished&quot;\r\n  as used in subsection (A) connotes physically providing accommodations to\r\n  customers, which Travelscape does not do.Â  Thus, in order to find Travelscape\r\n  to be in the business of &quot;furnishing accommodations,&quot; the majority\r\n  imposes a different meaning of the word &quot;furnish&quot; in subsection (E).Â \r\n  Under the majority's view, &quot;furnish&quot; in subsection (A) is used\r\n  narrowly and &quot;invokes the connotation of physically providing sleeping\r\n  accommodations to customers,&quot; while in subsection (E), the phrase\r\n  â€œbusiness of furnishingâ€ includes not only those who furnish but also those who\r\n  provide a service to â€œfurnishersâ€ and â€œtransients.â€\r\n  \r\n  \r\n&quot;A standard\r\n  principle of statutory construction provides that identical words and phrases\r\n  within the same statute should normally be given the same meaning.&quot;Â  Powerex\r\n  Corp. v. Reliant Energy Services, Inc., 551 U.S. 224, 232 (2007).Â  Where\r\n  the same word is used more than once in a statute, it is presumed to have the\r\n  same meaning throughout unless a different meaning is necessary to avoid an\r\n  absurd result.Â  See Busby v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 280\r\n  S.C. 330, 333, 312 S.E.2d 716, 718 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  In my opinion, giving the\r\n  term &quot;furnish&quot; a different meaning in subsection (A) than is given in\r\n  subsection (E), is in contravention to the rule of statutory construction that\r\n  the same terms or words in a statute should be given the same meaning.[12]\r\n  \r\n  \r\nI see no reason\r\n  to deviate from the general rule of statutory construction that the same words\r\n  within the same statute should be given the same meaning.Â  I believe this is\r\n  especially so in light of the additional and well-recognized rule of statutory\r\n  construction, that in the enforcement of tax statutes, the taxpayer should\r\n  receive the benefit in cases of doubt.Â  South Carolina Nat'l Bank v. South\r\n  Carolina Tax Comm'n, 297 S.C. 279, 281, 376 S.E.2d 512, 513 (1989).Â  The\r\n  majority's construction of the tax statute violates this rule.\r\n  \r\n  \r\nApplying the\r\n  language of Â§ 12-36-920 and utilizing our rules of statutory construction, I am\r\n  forced to conclude that Travelscape is not subject to the tax.Â  To conclude\r\n  otherwise would require a clearer expression of legislative intent.Â  I would\r\n  reverse.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Travelscape is a single member Nevada limited\r\n  liability company.Â  Expedia, Inc., a Washington corporation, is Travelscape's\r\n  single member.Â  \r\n[2] During the audit period, Travelscape entered into\r\n  contracts with 354 hotels in South Carolina.Â  \r\n[3] The issue of whether Travelscape is entitled to a credit\r\n  from the taxes it collected and remitted to the hotels based on the net room\r\n  rate is not before the Court by stipulation of the parties.Â  \r\n[4] The Department has not appealed from the ruling\r\n  regarding the payment of penalties.\r\n[5] Section 12-36-10 of the South Carolina Code (2000)\r\n  states &quot;[t]he words, terms, and phrases defined in this article have the\r\n  meaning provided, except when the context clearly indicates a different\r\n  meaning.&quot;\r\n[6] While the definition of &quot;gross proceeds of sales&quot;\r\n  applies to &quot;tangible personal property,&quot; we find the legislature's\r\n  use of &quot;gross proceeds&quot; specifically in connection with the\r\n  &quot;rental or charges for any rooms, campground spaces, lodgings, or sleeping\r\n  accommodations&quot; is sufficient to apply the general &quot;gross proceeds of\r\n  sales&quot; definition to the subject real property.\r\n[7] In Quill, the Supreme Court overruled Bellas\r\n  Hess for the proposition that the Due Process Clause requires the taxpayer\r\n  to be physically present in the jurisdiction in order for the tax to apply.Â \r\n  504 U.S. at 308, 112 S.Ct. at 1911.Â  However, Quill unequivocally\r\n  affirmed the physical presence requirement in evaluating whether the nexus\r\n  requirement has been met for Commerce Clause purposes.Â  Id.at 317, 112 S.Ct. at 1916.Â  \r\n[8] Travelscape is a &quot;seller&quot; of hotel rooms as\r\n  defined by statute.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-70(1)(c) (&quot;[S]eller\r\n  includes every person . . . renting, leasing, or otherwise furnishing tangible\r\n  personal property for a consideration . . . .&quot;). \r\n[9] In a similar argument, Travelscape asserts the State\r\n  violated its rights under the Equal Protection Clauses of the United States\r\n  Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution by failing to impose the tax\r\n  on non-Internet travel related companies engaged in the same business as\r\n  Travelscape.Â  This argument was never ruled on by the ALC.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  find this issue is not preserved for appellate review.Â  \r\n[10] Because the resolution of this issue concerns the\r\n  ALC's subject matter jurisdiction with respect to Travelscape's Dormant\r\n  Commerce Clause challenge, we raise it sua sponte. See S.C. Tax\r\n    Comm'n v. S.C. Tax Bd. of Review, 278 S.C. 556, 559-60, 299 S.E.2d 489,\r\n  491-92 (1983) (stating ALCs are without jurisdiction to hear constitutional\r\n  challenges).\r\n[11] While Travelscape does not specifically state it is\r\n  making an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge to this statute, it is clear from\r\n  the briefs it does not argue section 12-36-920 is facially unconstitutional. See\r\n    Williams v. Pryor, 240 F.3d 944, 953 (11th Cir. 2001) (&quot;Unless the\r\n  statute is unconstitutional in all its applications, an as-applied challenge\r\n  must be used to attack its constitutionality.&quot;).\r\n[12] In my view, the majority's reliance on Eagle\r\n  Container Co., LLC v. County of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 666 S.E.2d 892\r\n  (2008) is misplaced.Â  Although we stated in Eagle Container Co. that\r\n  &quot;words in a statute must be construed in context, and the meaning of\r\n  particular terms in a statute may be ascertained by reference to words\r\n  associated with them in the statute,&quot; we were not concerned with\r\n  construing the same word within the ordinance that was at issue.Â  Id. at\r\n  571, 666 S.E.2d at 895-96 (citations omitted).Â  Rather, the court had to\r\n  determine whether the phrase &quot;uses permitted&quot; was equivalent to the\r\n  term of art &quot;permitted use.&quot;\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26914","title":"Robinson v.

App. filed Dec. 16, 2008).Â  We\r\n  reverse the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the circuit court's\r\n  order granting summary judgment to Petitioners.\r\nI.\r\nThe facts of this case are, in significant\r\n  part, the same as those set forth in the related matters of Robinson v.\r\n    Estate of Harris, 388 S.C. 616, 698 S.E.2d 214 (2010); Robinson v.\r\n      Estate of Harris, 388 S.C. 630, 698 S.E.2d 222 (2010); Robinson v.\r\n        Estate of Harris, 388 S.C. 645, 698 S.E.2d 229 (2010) and Robinson v.\r\n          Estate of Harris, 389 S.C. 360, 698 S.E.2d 801 (2010).Â  As in these companion\r\n  cases, the underlying dispute is about the identity of the true heirs of Simeon\r\n  B. Pinckney.Â  Simeon B. Pinckney owned a twenty-acre tract of land on James\r\n  Island at the time of his death in the early 1920s.Â  The companion cases concern\r\n  a 4.3-acre tract derived from this property.Â  At issue in this case is an\r\n  adjacent ten-acre tract derived from the same property.\r\nThe ten\r\n  acres at issue in this case were conveyed by Laura and Herbert Pinckney to\r\n  Ellis Pinckney by deed dated October 26, 1946.Â  Ellis Pinckney died in 1976.Â \r\n  In his will, Ellis Pinckney bequeathed all of his personal and real property to\r\n  his daughters, Eloise Pinckney Harris and Isadora A. Pinckney, &quot;to share\r\n  and share alike.&quot;Â  Isadora Pinckney served as executrix, and she was duly\r\n  discharged of her duties by the probate court by Letters Dismissory dated\r\n  January 9, 1978.\r\nAfter\r\n  Isadora Pinckney's death, Eloise Pinckney Harris served as the executrix for\r\n  Isadora's estate.Â  The probate court issued Letters Dismissory dated March 25,\r\n  1981 releasing Eloise Pinckney Harris from her duties.Â  In addition, the\r\n  probate court issued a &quot;Devise/Descent of Real Estate and\r\n  Description&quot; on behalf of Isadora Pinckney, deceased, as grantor, to\r\n  Eloise Pinckney Harris as the sole devisee and grantee.Â  Through these\r\n  circumstances, Eloise Pinckney Harris thus became the sole owner of the ten-acre\r\n  tract now in contention.\r\nThe\r\n  estates of both Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney were properly probated in\r\n  the Charleston County Probate Court.Â  Notice of the Letters Dismissory\r\n  discharging the executrixes of the estates of Ellis Pinckney and Isadora\r\n  Pinckney were given by publication.Â  None of the Respondents filed any claims\r\n  or objections regarding the estates pursuant to statutory requirements.\r\nEloise\r\n  Pinckney Harris subsequently died, and her son, Petitioner Jerome C. Harris,\r\n  was appointed as the personal representative of her estate.Â  Eloise Pinckney\r\n  Harris devised the bulk of her estate to Jerome C. Harris.\r\nThe\r\n  dispute over ownership of the ten-acre area began in 2004 when Jerome C. Harris\r\n  was appointed the personal representative of his mother's estate and reportedly\r\n  sought to distribute the property to himself as the sole devisee.Â  At that\r\n  time, Respondents filed a petition to stay the issuance of a deed of\r\n  distribution.Â  Respondents claimed the property had been improperly willed to\r\n  the decedent, Eloise Pinckney Harris, because her predecessors-in-interest,\r\n  Isadora Pinckney and Ellis Pinckney, had no legitimate interest in the property.\r\nRespondents filed an action seeking to quiet title to the ten acres.Â \r\n  The essence of Respondents' complaint is that the 1946 conveyance to Ellis\r\n  Pinckney was invalid.Â  Specifically, Respondents claim their ancestor, Isabella\r\n  Pinckney, was the only lawful wife of Simeon B. Pinckney and that Laura,\r\n  Herbert, and Ellis Pinckney committed fraud when they claimed to be Simeon's\r\n  lawful heirs.\r\nII.\r\nThe circuit court granted summary judgment to Petitioners because\r\n  (1) Respondents' action was barred by South Carolina Code section 15-3-340\r\n  (2005) and (2) almost sixty years had passed since the conveyance to Ellis\r\n  Pinckney and two estates were properly probated in Charleston County without\r\n  any claims by Respondents.Â  The court of appeals reversed and remanded, finding\r\n  section 15-3-340 was not applicable to this case.[1]Â  The court of appeals refused to\r\n  uphold the circuit court's order on the basis of laches, finding &quot;there is\r\n  no mention of laches in the appealed order.&quot;Â  While it is true the word\r\n  &quot;laches&quot; does not appear in the circuit court order, we find it\r\n  manifest that the circuit court considered, and relied on, laches.Â  Moreover,\r\n  we find this action, like the companion cases, is barred by laches.Â  See Hallums v. Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 198-99, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988) (&quot;Laches\r\n  is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained length of time, under\r\n  circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do what in law should\r\n  have been done.Â  Whether a claim is barred by laches is to be determined in\r\n  light of [the] facts of each case, taking into consideration whether the delay\r\n  has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage to the other party; delay alone\r\n  in assertion of a right does not constitute laches.&quot; (internal citation\r\n  omitted)).\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nThe circuit court's order plainly referenced the excessive period\r\n  of time that passed between the 1946 conveyance to Ellis Pinckney and\r\n  Respondents' first objection to that conveyance in 2005. For example, the circuit court noted that\r\n  Respondents &quot;sat idlely [sic] by for a period in excess of fifty-five (55)\r\n  years assumedly knowing that they may have a right in the real property of\r\n  Ellis Pinckney.&quot;Â  In addition, the circuit court observed that:\r\n\r\n\tIt has been almost sixty (60) years since the real property that\r\n  is the subject of this action was conveyed to Ellis Pinckney.Â  There is no\r\n  provision in the Code of Laws of South Carolina that accords anyone the right,\r\n  legally or equitably, to bring an action sixty (60) years after the fact.Â \r\n  [Respondents] knew of their rights well in advance of this day.Â  It was\r\n  incumbent upon the [Respondents] to file the appropriate action in a court of\r\n  competent jurisdiction to have those rights adjudicated.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, we believe that the doctrine of laches formed a part\r\n  of the circuit court's reasoning in dismissing Respondents' complaint.Â  Under\r\n  the circumstances presented, Respondents' inaction for many decades constitutes\r\n  laches.\r\nIV.\r\nConsistent\r\n  with our decisions in the companion cases regarding the 4.3-acre tract derived\r\n  from the same ancestor, we hold Respondents' action to quiet title was barred\r\n  by the doctrine of laches.Â  Accordingly, we reverse the decision of the court\r\n  of appeals and reinstate the circuit court's order granting summary judgment to\r\n  Petitioners.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and E. C. Burnett, III, concur.Â \r\n  BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY, dissenting.Â  Sara Mae Robinson and others (&quot;Respondents&quot;) brought this\r\n  action against numerous defendants in a dispute over heirs' property.Â  Three of\r\n  those defendants, The Estate of Eloise Pinckney Harris, Jerome C. Harris, and\r\n  Judy P. Singleton (&quot;Petitioners&quot;), have petitionedÂ  this Court for a\r\n  writ of certiorari to review a decision of the Court of Appeals that reversed a\r\n  circuit court order granting summary judgment to Petitioners on the ground the\r\n  complaint was untimely.Â  See Robinson v. Estate of Eloise Pinckney\r\n    Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-705 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 16, 2008)\r\n  (&quot;Harris/Singleton appeal&quot;).Â  We granted the petition for review and\r\n  the majority has now reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  I\r\n  respectfully dissent.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nThe\r\n  property at issue in this case is 10 acres located on James Island that was\r\n  previously part of a 20-acre area owned by Simeon B. Pinckney at the time of\r\n  his death in Charleston County in the early 1920s.[2]Â  Simeon B. Pinckney died intestate, allegedly leaving\r\n  a wife, Laura Pinckney, and two sons, Ellis and Herbert Pinckney, as his\r\n  heirs.Â  \r\nThe land held by\r\n  Simeon B. Pinckney originated from a conveyance to him by deed executed in 1874\r\n  (and recorded in 1875) from Thomas Moore.Â  The property was described as being\r\n  20 acres, more or less.Â  In 1888, Simeon B. Pinckney conveyed 5 acres of this\r\n  property to his wife, Isabella Pinckney, leaving approximately 15 acres.Â  A\r\n  survey conducted in 1923, however, found that exactly 14.3 acres remained.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  deed dated October 26, 1946, Laura and Herbert Pinckney conveyed 10 acres of\r\n  this property to Ellis Pinckney.Â  The 10-acre area is located in the western\r\n  portion of the property formerly held by Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  The dispute in\r\n  this case concerns the ownership of these 10 acres.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  contemporaneous deed also dated October 26, 1946, Laura and Ellis Pinckney\r\n  conveyed 4.3 acres to Herbert Pinckney.Â  The 4.3-acre area was located in the\r\n  eastern portion of the land formerly held by Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  \r\nA\r\n  clear title action was brought in 1966 regarding the 4.3-acre area conveyed to\r\n  Herbert Pinckney, and a deed emanating from that action was recorded in the\r\n  Register of Mesne Conveyances for Charleston County.Â  None of the Respondents\r\n  or their predecessors-in-interest filed responsive pleadings in that\r\n  proceeding.Â  The 4.3 acres is the subject of companion cases before this Court. \r\nEllis Pinckney, who\r\n  had received the 10-acre area in dispute via the 1946 deed, died in 1976.Â  In\r\n  his will he bequeathed all of his personal and real property to his daughters,\r\n  Eloise Pinckney Harris and Isadora A. Pinckney, &quot;to share and share\r\n  alike.&quot;Â  Isadora Pinckney served as his executrix, and she was duly\r\n  discharged of her duties by the probate court by Letters Dismissory dated January\r\n  9, 1978. \r\nAfter Isadora\r\n  Pinckney's death, Eloise Pinckney Harris served as the executrix for Isadora's\r\n  estate.Â  The probate court issued Letters Dismissory dated March 25, 1981\r\n  releasing Eloise Pinckney Harris from her duties.Â  In addition, the probate\r\n  court issued a &quot;Devise/Descent of Real Estate and Description&quot; on\r\n  behalf of Isadora Pinckney, deceased, as grantor, to Eloise Pinckney Harris as\r\n  the sole devisee and grantee.Â  Through these circumstances, Eloise Pinckney\r\n  Harris thus became the sole owner of the 10-acre area now in contention.\r\nThe\r\n  estates of both Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney were properly probated in\r\n  the Charleston County Probate Court.Â  Notice of the Letters Dismissory\r\n  discharging the executrixes of the estates of Ellis Pinckney and Isadora\r\n  Pinckney were given by publication.Â  None of the Respondents filed any claims\r\n  or objections regarding the estates pursuant to statutory requirements.Â  \r\nEloise Pinckney\r\n  Harris subsequently died and her son, Petitioner Jerome C. Harris, was appointed\r\n  as the personal representative of her estate pursuant to the terms of her\r\n  will.Â  Eloise Pinckney Harris devised the bulk of her estate to Jerome C.\r\n  Harris.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dispute over ownership of the 10-acre area began in 2004 when Jerome C. Harris\r\n  was appointed the personal representative of his mother's estate and reportedly\r\n  sought to distribute the property to himself as the sole devisee.Â  At that\r\n  time, Respondents filed a petition to stay the issuance of a deed of\r\n  distribution.Â  Respondents claimed the property had been improperly willed to\r\n  the decedent, Eloise Pinckney Harris, because her predecessors-in-interest,\r\n  Isadora Pinckney and Ellis Pinckney, had no legitimate interest in the\r\n  property.Â Â Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  the probate of Eloise Pinckney Harris's estate was pending, Respondents filed\r\n  the current action in the circuit court of Charleston County against\r\n  Petitioners on February 1, 2005, seeking to quiet title to the property.Â  The\r\n  proceeding in the probate court was stayed by order of the probate court dated\r\n  July 1, 2005 pending resolution of the circuit court matter.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  an amended complaint, Respondents sought to quiet title to property located on\r\n  James Island, South Carolina that was originally part of the estimated 20 acres\r\n  acquired by Simeon B. Pinckney in 1874.Â  Respondents asserted they were the\r\n  only surviving, legitimate heirs of Simeon B. Pinckney and that they were the\r\n  fee simple owners of the property described in an attached lis pendens. They\r\n  sought an order confirming their title.Â  Respondents stated partitioning of the\r\n  property was &quot;not feasible&quot; and asked that the property be sold and\r\n  the proceeds be distributed among Respondents.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  alleged Isabella Pinckney was the only lawful wife of Simeon B. Pinckney.Â  They\r\n  contended Simeon B. Pinckney died intestate and was survived by a son, Samuel\r\n  James Pinckney, and a daughter, Mary Pinckney, but no proceedings were ever\r\n  commenced to probate Simeon B. Pinckney's estate.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  claimed Laura, Ellis, and Herbert Pinckney were not the true heirs of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney as Laura Pinckney was never Simeon B. Pinckney's legal spouse.Â \r\n  Respondents asserted the three &quot;executed and recorded cross deeds to attempt\r\n  to fraudulently divide the ownership between Ellis and Herbert [Pinckney] of\r\n  the remaining&quot; 14.3 acres that Simeon B. Pinckney had owned at his death\r\n  and that should have passed to his heirs by intestacy, Samuel James Pinckney\r\n  and Mary Pinckney.Â  Respondents alleged the three fraudulently misappropriated\r\n  the 14.3 acres and took them from the true owners, who could not read and write\r\n  and were not aware of the conveyances.Â  Respondents maintained they are the\r\n  true heirs of Simeon B. Pinckney through their ancestor Samuel James Pinckney.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  contended that, as a result of fraudulent cross-deeds in 1946 by individuals\r\n  who had no lawful interest in the property, the 10-acre area was eventually\r\n  conveyed to the late Eloise Pinckney Harris, who during her lifetime attempted\r\n  to convey 1.3 acres of the 10 acres to Petitioner Judy P. Singleton.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their answer, Petitioners asserted the running of the statute of limitations[3], the closing of the administration of the estates of\r\n  Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney, as well as laches, waiver, and estoppel.Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  herein, the Estate of Eloise Pinckney Harris; Eloise's son and personal\r\n  representative, Jerome C. Harris, who claimed to be Eloise's only heir; and\r\n  Judy P. Singleton, who claimed she received a portion of Eloise's interest in\r\n  the 10-acre area during Eloise's lifetime, filed a motion for summary judgment\r\n  dated April 11, 2006 &quot;based upon the relevant case law and statutory\r\n  enactments.&quot;Â  \r\nA hearing on\r\n  Petitioners' summary judgment motion was held on November 6, 2006.[4]Â  At the hearing, counsel for Petitioners argued\r\n  Respondents' complaint was barred by a statute of limitations that precluded\r\n  claims for the recovery of real property after 40 years[5]; the time for filing a claim against an estate under\r\n  the South Carolina Probate Code has expired for the two estates that have\r\n  already been probated; and that Petitioners and their predecessors have\r\n  occupied the property since at least 1922, so the complaint is barred by the\r\n  doctrines of laches and waiver.Â  Counsel argued Respondents sat &quot;idly\r\n  by&quot; and were &quot;asking this court by judicial fiat to . . . invoke or\r\n  'invent' a statute that allows them to now come in and claim their interest in\r\n  this property.&quot; \r\nIn contrast,\r\n  Respondents argued the 1946 deeds were fraudulent and therefore void and could\r\n  not convey legal title; further, they had no notice that the deeds existed.Â \r\n  Respondents averred Ellis and Herbert Pinckney were not the sons of Simeon B.\r\n  Pinckney and that Laura Pinckney was not his wife, which could be shown by an\r\n  examination of the public record.Â  Respondents declared &quot;there was\r\n  extrinsic fraud that was perpetrated by Laura Pinckney, Ellis Pinckney, and\r\n  Herbert Pinckney&quot; because &quot;[t]hey have no relationship whatsoever to\r\n  [Simeon B.] Pinckney, the true owner of the property[,] and Samuel James\r\n  Pinckney, the only legitimate child who survived at his father's death.&quot;Â  \r\nIn response,\r\n  Petitioners argued the two Letters Dismissory from the probate court ending the\r\n  administration of the estates of Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney\r\n  constituted an adjudication of sorts on the property that is the subject of\r\n  this litigation, as the property was the main asset in both estates, and the\r\n  notice by publication in the newspaper provided due notice to all parties of\r\n  the disposition of the property.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the end of the hearing, the circuit court orally granted Petitioners' motion\r\n  for summary judgment based on the 40-year statute of limitations referenced by\r\n  counsel.Â  Subsequently, the circuit court formally granted summary judgment to\r\n  Petitioners by written order filed January 9, 2007, finding Respondents'\r\n  lawsuit to quiet title to the 10-acre area was untimely, but cited a different\r\n  statute of limitations.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed in an unpublished decision.Â  Robinson v. Estate of Eloise Pinckney Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-705 (S.C.\r\n  Ct. App. filed Dec. 16, 2008).Â  Petitioners filed a petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari seeking review of the decision of the Court of Appeals, which this\r\n  Court granted.Â  \r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSISÂ  \r\nA.\r\nIn\r\n  its written order finding Respondents' lawsuit was untimely, the circuit court\r\n  observed it was undisputed that two estates, those of Ellis Pinckney and\r\n  Isadora Pinckney, &quot;were properly and legally probated in Charleston\r\n  County, [and Respondents] made no claims against either Estate.&quot;Â  The\r\n  court further determined the current action was barred by section 15-3-340 of\r\n  the South Carolina Code:\r\n\r\n\tThere can be no argument from these [Respondents] or\r\n  otherwise that publication pursuant to the Probate statutes was not properly\r\n  followed.Â  It has been almost sixty (60) years since the real property that is\r\n  the subject matter of this action was conveyed to Ellis Pinckney.Â  There is no\r\n  provision in the Code of Laws of South Carolina that accords anyone the right,\r\n  legally or equitably, to bring an action sixty (60) years after the fact.\r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tUnder\r\n  section 15-3-340 of the Code of Laws of South Carolina, these [Respondents']\r\n  actions are barred.Â  Section 15-3-340 states, &quot;no action for recovery of\r\n    real property or recovery of the possession of real property may be maintained\r\n    unless it appears that the Plaintiff, his ancestors, predecessors or grantors\r\n    was seized or possessed of the premise in question within ten (10) years before\r\n    the commencement of the action.&quot;Â  The individual[s] that possess the\r\n  property that is the subject matter of this action, were not the ancestors,\r\n  predecessors or grantors of the Plaintiffs [i.e., Respondents]. Specifically,\r\n  Ellis Pinckney and his daughters, Isadora and Eloise Pinckney, exclusively\r\n  possessed this property to the exclusion of all others for more than ten (10)\r\n  years prior to the commencement of this action.\r\n\t[Respondents] sat idlely by for a period in excess of\r\n  fifty-five (55) years assumedly knowing that they may have a right in the real\r\n  property of Ellis Pinckney.Â  Simeon Pinckney, the father of Ellis Pinckney,\r\n  possess[ed] this property prior to 1923, the date of his death.Â  If that figure\r\n  is used as a starting point insofar as the statute of limitation is concerned,\r\n  the [Respondents] waited for a period of eighty-five (85) years.\r\n\tThe\r\n  purpose of the statutory scheme as set out by the Code of Laws of the State of\r\n  South Carolina relative to the recovery of real property is to put an end to\r\n  controversies about real property.Â  There is no statute in the South Carolina\r\n  Code of Laws which allows a Plaintiff to bring an action for recovery of\r\n  property after a period of eighty (80) years.\r\n\r\nSection\r\n  15-3-340, which was relied upon by the circuit court in its final, written\r\n  order provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tNo action for the recovery of real property or the\r\n  recovery of the possession of real property may be maintained unless it appears\r\n  that the plaintiff, his ancestor, predecessor, or grantor, was seized or\r\n  possessed of the premises in question within ten years before the commencement\r\n  of the action.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-340\r\n  (2005).Â  \r\nB.\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed the grant of summary judgment and remanded the matter for\r\n  further proceedings in an unpublished opinion.Â  Robinson v. Estate of Eloise\r\n    Pinckney Harris, Op. No. 2008-UP-705 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Dec. 16, 2008).Â \r\n  As part of its initial analysis, the Court of Appeals first held the circuit\r\n  court erred in finding the lawsuit was barred under section 15-3-340 because\r\n  that statute is inapplicable.Â  Id., slip op. at 1. The Court of Appeals\r\n  explained:\r\n\r\n\tWhereas\r\n  section 15-3-340 addresses actions for either the recovery of real property or\r\n  the recovery of possession of real property, [the] amended complaint asserted\r\n  the ownership interest[s] in the subject property asserted by the Estate of\r\n  Eloise Harris and the devisees of Eloise Harris were based on &quot;erroneous\r\n  forgeries and fraudulent cross-deeds and devises.&quot;Â  This allegation was\r\n  the gravamen of [the] lawsuit insofar as it concerned the ten-acre tract.Â  As\r\n  such, any limitation period set by section 15-3-340 would be inapplicable. \r\n\r\nId. at 1.\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals cited McKinnon v. Summers,\r\n  224 S.C. 331, 79 S.E.2d 146 (1953), in which this Court held that a complaint\r\n  for cancellation of deeds on the ground of forgery is distinguishable from an\r\n  action for the recovery of real property and, thus, is not governed by the\r\n  predecessor statute to section 15-3-340 (citing section 10-124 of the 1952\r\n  Code).Â  Id. at 2.Â  The Court of Appeals further stated that, even if\r\n  Respondents' complaint was taken at face value as one to quiet title, the\r\n  action would not be governed by section 15-3-340 because an action to quiet\r\n  title is in equity and statutes of limitations are not generally applicable to\r\n  equitable actions, citing Fox v. Moultrie, 379 S.C. 609, 613, 666 S.E.2d\r\n  915, 917 (2008) (&quot;An action to quiet title is one in equity.&quot;); Parr\r\n    v. Parr, 268 S.C. 58, 67, 231 S.E.2d 695, 699 (1977) (stating statutes of\r\n  limitation are generally not applicable in equitable actions).Â  Id.\r\nAs a secondary point,\r\n  the Court of Appeals noted the parties had addressed in their briefs the\r\n  applicability of laches and the legal ramifications of Respondents' failure to\r\n  file claims against the estates of Ellis Pinckney and Isadora Pinckney, but\r\n  that &quot;[n]either point, however, is a basis on which to affirm the appealed\r\n  order.&quot;Â  Id. at 2.Â  The Court of Appeals stated the circuit court's\r\n  reference to Respondents' failure to file claims against the two estates\r\n  &quot;was not presented as an independent ground for summary judgment, and\r\n  there is no mention of laches in the appealed order.&quot;Â  Id. Â \r\nC.\r\nPetitioners contend\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals should be reversed, arguing the circuit\r\n  court properly granted their motion for summary judgment because there are no\r\n  genuine issues of material fact and as a matter of law Respondents' complaint\r\n  is untimely.Â  I disagree. \r\nPetitioners have\r\n  not challenged the holding of the Court of Appeals regarding section 15-3-340.Â \r\n  As a result, the ruling that section 15-3-340 is not applicable to bar\r\n  Respondents' action and that summary judgment cannot be granted on that basis\r\n  is final.Â  See ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche,\r\n  327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d 470 (1997) (stating an unchallenged ruling, right or\r\n  wrong, is the law of the case).\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue, however, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the grant of summary\r\n  judgment because Respondents' complaint was barred on the grounds of laches\r\n  and/or waiver, and these grounds were implicitly included in the circuit court's\r\n  order.Â  Petitioners concede the circuit court did not use the terms\r\n  &quot;laches&quot; or &quot;waiver&quot; in its order, but argue the court was\r\n  referring to either or both of these concepts in its finding that &quot;[t]he\r\n  Plaintiff[s] sat idlely by for a period in excess of fifty-five (55) years\r\n  assumedly knowing that they may have a right in the real property of Ellis\r\n  Pinckney.&quot;Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  note the circuit court also found the two estates, those of Ellis Pinckney and\r\n  Isadora Pinckney, were properly probated without any claims or objections being\r\n  filed.Â  Petitioners argue that &quot;given the broad language of the conclusion\r\n  in the [circuit] [c]ourt's Order granting Summary Judgment to Petitioners, it\r\n  is without question that there does exist, as evidenced by the very language of\r\n  the Summary Judgment Order, an independent ground that was cited by the Trial\r\n  Court as a basis for granting their Summary Judgment [motion].&quot;Â \r\n  Petitioners assert &quot;[i]t is well established in South Carolina that the\r\n  doctrine[s] of waiver and laches apply to actions such as in the instant\r\n  case.&quot;Â  \r\nIn contrast,\r\n  Respondents contend the circuit court's written order was based solely on the\r\n  statute of limitations set forth in section 15-3-340 and not upon the equitable\r\n  defenses of laches and/or waiver.Â  In support of this argument, they point to\r\n  the transcript of the hearing in this matter where the circuit court stated\r\n  Petitioners were entitled to summary judgment based &quot;[o]n the statute of\r\n  limitations.&quot;[6]Â  They further assert that, even if the circuit court's\r\n  order was implicitly based upon the equitable defenses of laches and/or waiver,\r\n  the matter should be remanded for trial because the defenses have not been\r\n  appropriately raised and supported by Petitioners.Â  \r\nI am\r\n  persuaded by Respondents' arguments in this regard.Â  After considering all of\r\n  the circumstances, I believe the Court of Appeals correctly determined that the\r\n  circuit court's order, while granting summary judgment based on the statutory\r\n  ground of section 15-3-340, did not additionally rule upon any of the other\r\n  grounds asserted by Petitioners.Â  The circuit court referenced only a statute\r\n  of limitations in its final, written order, without discussing the legal\r\n  requirements to establish laches or any other theory set forth by Petitioners\r\n  to bar Respondents' complaint.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted above, the circuit court expressly stated in its oral ruling from the\r\n  bench that it was granting summary judgment based only on a &quot;statute of\r\n  limitations&quot;; the citation for the statute was not discussed, but it was\r\n  referred to as a 40-year statute.Â  Since\r\n  the final order clearly references a different statute than the one discussed\r\n  at the hearing, it is apparent the circuit court changed the basis for its\r\n  ruling to some extent.Â  \r\nHowever,\r\n  it is not evident that the circuit court broadened its ruling to include laches\r\n  and/or waiver.Â  The circuit court did state at the hearing that it had expanded\r\n  the basis for its order granting summary judgment in the companion cases so as\r\n  to include laches.Â  Nevertheless, it went on to orally rule that Petitioners\r\n  were entitled to summary judgment based solely on a statute of\r\n  limitations, without including laches or any other ground, even though the\r\n  court had just discussed that additional ground in the context of the other,\r\n  companion cases that concerned the 4.3-acre area.Â  Although this oral ruling is\r\n  not binding,[7] the circuit court's final, written order also omitted\r\n  any discussion of laches as a basis for granting summary judgment, and it did\r\n  not include an analysis of the legal requirements for establishing laches.Â \r\n  Rather, it expressly cited and relied upon the statute of limitations set forth\r\n  in section 15-3-340.Â  Therefore, although the order is somewhat ambiguous, I\r\n  agree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that the circuit court did\r\n  not base its ruling on the doctrine of laches or any other theory as no other\r\n  basis was clearly and fully developed in the circuit court's order.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if the circuit court's order could be deemed to implicitly rule on laches\r\n  or any other equitable theory asserted by Petitioners, such an implicit ruling,\r\n  without any accompanying analysis or discussion, would not give this Court\r\n  anything to review, and further development of the record is necessary in this\r\n  regard.Â  See Able Commc'ns, Inc. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 290\r\n  S.C. 409, 351 S.E.2d 151 (1986) (stating implicit findings, as well as general\r\n  statements and conclusions, do not provide sufficient detail to enable\r\n  appellate review); cf. Jones v. Lott, 387 S.C. 339, 346, 692\r\n  S.E.2d 900, 903 (2010) (stating an appellate court should not be forced to\r\n  &quot;grope in the dark&quot; to ascertain the precise nature of an issue on\r\n  appeal); Carey v. Snee Farm Cmty. Found., 388 S.C. 229, 694 S.E.2d 244 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2010) (vacating the trial court's grant of summary judgment and remanding\r\n  the matter for additional factual findings and accompanying legal analysis\r\n  where the basis for the trial court's grant of summary judgment could not be\r\n  clearly determined from the record).\r\nI am\r\n  cognizant of the problems with heirs' property from both sides of the spectrum,\r\n  i.e., the heirs whose ownership interests are infinitely difficult to untangle,\r\n  and those who come many years after the events that gave rise to questions\r\n  about ownership who desire the real estate records to have some sense of finality\r\n  and reliability.Â  A bright-line rule cannot be adopted setting forth an\r\n  absolute time limit for such proceedings, as many variables are at stake, and\r\n  even when legal statutes of limitation have expired, equitable considerations\r\n  may come into play that cannot be determined from an undeveloped record.Â  Cf.,\r\n    e.g., Mr. T. v. Ms. T., 378 S.C. 127, 662 S.E.2d 413 (Ct. App. 2008)\r\n  (holding complicated decisions in family court proceedings cannot be made in a\r\n  vacuum with an undeveloped record based on strict notions of finality). \r\nBecause\r\n  this case comes before the Court in the posture of a party seeking summary\r\n  judgment, the allegations in the complaint are deemed true for purposes of this\r\n  analysis.Â  In their complaint,\r\n  Respondents alleged there was extrinsic fraud committed in connection with the\r\n  1946 deeds.Â  &quot;Extrinsic fraud is collateral or external to the trial of\r\n  the matter.&quot;Â  Hagy v. Pruitt,&nbsp;339 S.C. 425, 431, 529 S.E.2d\r\n  714, 717&nbsp;(2000).Â  &quot;It is fraud that 'induces a person not to present\r\n  a case or deprives a person of the opportunity to be heard.'&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Hilton Head Ctr. of S.C., Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362\r\n  S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987)).Â  &quot;Intrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud presented\r\n  and considered in the trial.&quot;Â  Id. at 431-32, 529 S.E.2d at 718.Â  \r\nUnder proper\r\n  circumstances, an allegation of extrinsic fraud can be considered despite the\r\n  existence of an applicable statute of limitations that would otherwise bar the\r\n  claim.Â  Id. at 431, 529 S.E.2d at 717.Â  The avoidance of the statute of\r\n  limitations does not mean, however, that an allegation of extrinsic fraud may\r\n  be considered for an unlimited period, however, because the doctrine of laches\r\n  will still apply in determining whether such an action may be maintained.Â  Id. at 431 n.7, 529 S.E.2d at 717 n.7.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  order to establish laches as a defense, a party must show\r\n  that the complaining party unreasonably delayed its assertion of a right,\r\n  resulting in prejudice to the party asserting the defense of laches.&quot;Â  Historic Charleston Holdings, L.L.C. v. Mallon, 381 S.C. 417, 432, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 448, 456&nbsp;(2009).Â  It is an equitable doctrine.Â  Id.; see\r\n    also Hallums v. Hallums,&nbsp;296 S.C. 195, 198-99, 371 S.E.2d 525,\r\n  527&nbsp;(1988) (&quot;Laches is neglect for an unreasonable and unexplained\r\n  length of time, under circumstances affording opportunity for diligence, to do\r\n  what in law should have been done. Â Whether a claim is barred by laches is to\r\n  be determined in light of the facts of each case, taking into consideration\r\n  whether the delay has worked injury, prejudice, or disadvantage\r\n  to the other party; delay alone in assertion of a right does not constitute\r\n  laches.&quot; (citation omitted)).Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  the circuit court stated Respondents should have filed an appropriate action in\r\n  this case sooner, the court did not make specific findings of fact or analyze\r\n  the requirements for establishing laches, and it would be unfair to hold as a\r\n  matter of law that Respondents' complaint is barred on this basis or on any\r\n  other equitable basis in light of the fact that the circuit court did not\r\n  explicitly so rule, and in light of the fact that a question exists as to the\r\n  applicability of an equitable defense. Â It is well-established that one who\r\n  seeks equitable relief must act equitably in the first instance, and the\r\n  allegation at issue is reportedly fraud and/or misconduct by Petitioners'\r\n  ancestral predecessors-in-interest.Â  See generally First Union Nat'l\r\n    Bank of S.C. v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 568, 511 S.E.2d 372, 379 (Ct. App. 1998)\r\n  (observing the doctrine of unclean hands precludes a party from recovering in\r\n  equity if the party acted unfairly in the matter that is the subject of the\r\n  litigation to the prejudice of the opposing party).Â  Consequently, I would hold\r\n  the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to Petitioners and affirm\r\n  the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Section 15-3-340 provides: &quot;No action for the recovery of real\r\n  property or for the recovery of the possession of real property may be\r\n  maintained unless it appears that the plaintiff, his ancestor, predecessor, or\r\n  grantor, was seized or possessed of the premises in question within ten years\r\n  before the commencement of the action.&quot;Â  Petitioners did not raise any\r\n  issue with regard to the applicability of this statute in their petition for\r\n  writ of certiorari.\r\n[2]Â Simeon B. Pinckney's year of death is variously\r\n  stated in the materials for this case as 1921, 1922, or 1923.\r\n[3]Â A specific statute was not cited in the answer.\r\n[4] The November 6, 2006 hearing was held both to\r\n  reconsider prior orders granting summary judgment regarding the 4.3 acres at\r\n  issue in the companion cases, as well as to hear the motion for summary\r\n  judgment concerning the 10-acre area at issue in the current (Harris/Singleton)\r\n  matter.Â  \r\n[5]Â Petitioners did not identify a specific statutory\r\n  section during the discussion.Â  However, section 15-3-380 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code refers to a 40-year period.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-380 (2005)\r\n  (&quot;No action shall be commenced in any case for the recovery of real\r\n  property or for any interest therein against a person in possession under claim\r\n  of title by virtue of a written instrument unless the person claiming, his\r\n  ancestor or grantor, was actually in the possession of the same or a part\r\n  thereof within forty years from the commencement of such action.Â  And the\r\n  possession of a defendant, sole or connected, pursuant to the provisions of\r\n  this section shall be deemed valid against the world after the lapse of such a\r\n  period.&quot;).Â  Â \r\n[6] At the end of the hearing in the current matter,\r\n  counsel for Petitioners argued Petitioners were entitled to summary judgment.Â \r\n  The circuit court stated, &quot;On the statute of limitations you are.&quot;Â \r\n  The court explained, &quot;It's a forty-year statute, it's applicable.&quot;Â \r\n  At the conclusion of the hearing, the circuit court reiterated that it was\r\n  granting summary judgment based on a 40-year statute of limitations.Â  This is notable\r\n  because section 15-3-340, which is cited in the circuit court's final, written\r\n  order, is not a 40-year statute, it is a 10-year statute.Â  Therefore, it\r\n  appears the circuit court was referring to a different statute, possibly S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-380 (which provides for a limitations period of 40 years)\r\n  during the hearing. \r\n[7] See, e.g., Rule 58(a), SCRCP (&quot;Every\r\n  judgment shall be set forth on a separate document.Â  A judgment is effective\r\n  only when so set forth and entered in the record.&quot;); Ford v. State\r\n    Ethics Comm'n, 344 S.C. 642, 646, 545 S.E.2d 821, 823 (2001) (&quot;Until\r\n  written and entered, the trial judge retains discretion to change his mind and\r\n  amend his oral ruling accordingly.Â  The written order is the trial judge's\r\n  final order and as such constitutes the final judgment of the court.&quot;\r\n  (citation omitted)); Doe v. Doe,&nbsp;324 S.C. 492, 501, 478 S.E.2d 854,\r\n  859&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1996) (&quot;Judgments . . . are not final until written and\r\n  entered.&quot;).Â  Similarly, the circuit court noted at the hearing in the\r\n  current, Harris/Singleton matter that it had expanded upon its original grounds\r\n  for granting summary judgment in the order in the companion cases concerning\r\n  the 4.3-acre area that had been part of Simeon B. Pinckney's estate. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26915","title":"State v.

Stephenson, IV, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tDeborah\r\n  Harrison Sheffield, of Columbia, and Robert L. Lumpkin, Jr., of Lumpkin, Oxner\r\n  &amp; Stacy, of Georgetown, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Respondent\r\n  was convicted in magistrateâ€™s court of preparing a baited dove field in\r\n  violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 50-1-10 (2008) and appealed to circuit court.Â \r\n  After a hearing, the circuit court judge issued a written order requiring that\r\n  respondentâ€™s conviction be â€œreversed and dismissedâ€ based upon her sua\r\n    sponte conclusion that the magistrateâ€™s court lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction over the charge. Â The State did not challenge that order in the\r\n  circuit court but instead brought this appeal.Â  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  dismissal as the State has failed to preserve any issue related to that ruling\r\n  for our appellate review.\r\nThe\r\n  State argues, and respondent agrees, that the circuit court erred in concluding\r\n  that respondentâ€™s magistrateâ€™s court conviction for violating Â§ 50-1-10 was\r\n  void for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Respondent argues, however, and\r\n  we agree, that review of the merits of the Stateâ€™s appeal is barred because the\r\n  State failed to ask the circuit court judge to reconsider her decision before\r\n  appealing.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether a party may appeal an erroneous subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction ruling without first preserving the issue for appellate review?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWe\r\n  begin by correcting the Stateâ€™s mischaracterization of respondentâ€™s appeal in\r\n  the circuit court. Specifically, the State argues this criminal appeal is not\r\n  subject to the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure.Â  In making that\r\n  argument, the State ignores S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-3-10 (Supp. 2009) which\r\n  provides that criminal appeals from magistrateâ€™s court are made to the Court of\r\n  Common Pleas.Â  Further, under the SCRCP, these appellate â€œproceedings in the circuit\r\n  court shall be in accordance with [the SCRCP].â€Â  Rule 74, SCRCP.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  State next argues that because subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any\r\n  point in the litigation, including sua sponte by the court,[2] it was not obligated to ask the circuit\r\n  court judge to reconsider her ruling before appealing to this Court.Â  We\r\n  disagree.\r\nâ€œ[A]ll\r\n  this Court has ever required is that the questions presented for its decision\r\n  must first have been fairly and properly raised to the lower court and passed\r\n  upon by that court.â€Â  Hubbard v. Rowe, 192 S.C. 12, 5 S.E.2d 187\r\n  (1939).Â  An argument that is not raised to an intermediate appellate court is\r\n  not preserved for review by this Court.Â  United Dom. Realty Trust v.\r\n    Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 307 S.C. 102, 413 S.E.2d 866 (Ct. App 1992).Â  Even\r\n  though subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at anytime, there is no error\r\n  preservation exception allowing a party to bypass calling an erroneous ruling\r\n  to the attention of the tribunal making it before appealing that ruling to a\r\n  higher court.Â  Compare Dunlap &amp; Dunlap v. Zimmerman, 188 S.C.\r\n  322, 199 S.E. 296 (1938) (once the issue of subject matter jurisdiction has\r\n  been decided adversely to a party, he must preserve his exception or be barred\r\n  from raising the issue later); cf. DeTreville v. Groover, 219\r\n  S.C. 313, 65 S.E.2d 232 (1951) (party abandoned subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  issue by failing to argue it in brief).\r\nThe\r\n  State failed to ask the circuit judge to reconsider her subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction ruling before appealing the order to this Court.Â  Accordingly, it\r\n  has failed to preserve any issue related to that ruling for our review.Â  See City of Rock Hill v. Suchenski, 324 S.C. 12, 646 S.E.2d 879 (2007)\r\n  (holding Rule 59(e) applies to circuit court sitting in appellate capacity to\r\n  review criminal convictions); State v. Bailey, 368 S.C. 39, 626 S.E.2d\r\n  898 (Ct. App. 2006) cert. denied March 8, 2007 (circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  appellate error must be called to its attention by petition for rehearing in\r\n  order to be preserved for further appellate review).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  order dismissing the charge against respondent is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nKITTREDGE\r\n  and HEARN, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  BEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  To my mind, issue preservation should be no\r\n  bar to the judge's erroneous ruling on subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Our case\r\n  law is clear that a judge's erroneous assumption of jurisdiction, be it an\r\n  explicit finding of jurisdiction or assumed jurisdiction, may be raised at any\r\n  time on appeal and addressed de novo by the appellate court without\r\n  regard to our customary issue preservation requirements.Â  See In re November\r\n    4, 2008 Bluffton Town Council Election, 385 S.C. 632, 637, 686 S.E.2d 683,\r\n  686 (2009) (&quot;Issues related to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised\r\n  at any time.&quot;); Arnal v. Fraser, 371 S.C. 512, 517 n.2, 641 S.E.2d\r\n  419, 421, n.2 (2007); Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  773, 777 (1998). Â Â I see no reason why a judge's erroneous ruling that she\r\n  lacks subject matter jurisdiction should be treated differently from an\r\n  erroneous ruling that she has subject matter jurisdiction.Â  Here, the circuit\r\n  court clearly had subject matter jurisdiction over this matter, and I would\r\n  remand the case for the circuit court to exercise that jurisdiction.\r\nBEATTY, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We overrule State v.

Grice, of Blythewood, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  Larry McCarson appeals the\r\n  order of the Administrative Law Court (ALC) that resulted in the suspension of\r\n  his driver's license following an arrest for driving under the influence (DUI).[1]Â \r\n  In his appeal, McCarson claims the ALC erred in reversing the decision of the\r\n  Hearing Officer for the Division of Motor Vehicles Hearings (DMVH) that\r\n  rescinded the initial license suspension.Â  Specifically, McCarson contends his\r\n  license should not have been suspended as there was no admissible evidence to\r\n  establish probable cause for his DUI arrest.Â  We agree and reverse the decision\r\n  of the ALC.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nAt approximately 2:00 a.m. on January 1, 2006, First\r\n  Sergeant Kimbrell was on routine patrol near the junction of US 221 and I-385\r\n  in Laurens County.Â  While on patrol, Kimbrell observed McCarson drive his\r\n  vehicle over a curb, fail to yield the right of way, make an improper turn, and\r\n  make a wide turn on an entrance ramp of I-385 near a divider wall.Â  Because his\r\n  patrol vehicle was not equipped with a video camera, Kimbrell requested\r\n  assistance after pulling McCarson over for the driving violations.Â  \r\nShortly thereafter, Trooper Michael Jones arrived at\r\n  the location where McCarson was being detained by his supervisor, Sergeant\r\n  Kimbrell.Â  Upon his arrival, Kimbrell advised Jones of the reason for the\r\n  traffic stop.Â  Jones then requested that McCarson step to the rear of the\r\n  vehicle.Â  After reading McCarson his Miranda[2] rights, Jones ordered McCarson to perform several field sobriety tests.Â \r\n  According to Jones, McCarson performed &quot;poorly&quot; on the Horizontal\r\n  Gaze Nystagmus (HGN) test and the &quot;one-leg stand&quot; test. Â As a result,\r\n  Jones arrested McCarson for DUI and transported him to the Laurens County Law\r\n  Enforcement Center. \r\nAfter being read the Advisement of Implied Consent\r\n  rights[3] and his Miranda rights, McCarson agreed to submit to a DataMaster\r\n  breathalyzer test.Â  The test results revealed that McCarson had a blood alcohol\r\n  level of 0.17 percent.Â  Because McCarson's blood alcohol level was greater than\r\n  0.15 percent, Jones issued McCarson a Notice of Suspension pursuant to section\r\n  56-5-2951(A) of the South Carolina Code.[4]Â  \r\nWithin the statutorily-prescribed time period,[5] McCarson filed a request for an administrative hearing before the DMVH to\r\n  challenge the license suspension.\r\nOn March 1, 2006, Hearing Officer Tracy Holland held a\r\n  hearing on McCarson's license suspension.[6]Â \r\n  Trooper Jones, but not Sergeant Kimbrell, appeared on behalf of the Department\r\n  of Motor Vehicles (the &quot;Department&quot;).Â Â Â  At the hearing, Jones\r\n  offered an Incident Report to supplement his own testimony.Â  The Incident\r\n  Report detailed Kimbrell's observations of McCarson's erratic driving prior to\r\n  Jones's arrival at the scene.Â  Jones also sought to introduce the following\r\n  documents:Â  his DataMaster certification, the implied consent advisement form,\r\n  the notice of suspension, and the traffic ticket. Â \r\nMcCarson's counsel objected to the admission of the\r\n  Incident Report on the ground it constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  In\r\n  conjunction, counsel sought to exclude the other documents on the basis that\r\n  &quot;there is no foundation and in trying to lay the foundation, there's\r\n  hearsay, without the other officer here.&quot;Â  Holland agreed and, as a\r\n  result, excluded the proffered evidence.Â  In turn, Holland ruled:\r\n\r\n\tI find that the testimony of Trooper Jones failed to\r\n  prove that [McCarson] was lawfully arrested for driving under the influence.Â \r\n  Trooper Jones failed to present any testimony or other evidence which led him\r\n  to believe that [McCarson] was operating a motor vehicle while under the\r\n  influence of alcohol or drugs . . . There was no testimony about the reason for\r\n  the stop, no testimony about attributes or behavior which typically lead an\r\n  officer to believe someone is under the influence, and no testimony about\r\n  [McCarson's] performance on the field sobriety tests.Â  The only testimony given\r\n  was that the field sobriety tests indicated he was under the influence. \r\n\r\nUltimately, Holland concluded that the Department\r\n  failed to meet its burden of proof.Â  Consequently, by order dated March 30,\r\n  2007, Holland rescinded McCarson's license suspension and ordered the Department\r\n  to restore McCarson's driving privileges.\r\nThe Department appealed Holland's order to the ALC.Â \r\n  In challenging the order, the Department primarily asserted Holland erred in\r\n  excluding the documentary evidence that served as the basis for establishing\r\n  probable cause for McCarson's arrest.Â  \r\nBased on the parties' briefs, the Honorable John\r\n  McLeod considered the central question of whether Sergeant Kimbrell's\r\n  statements should have been admitted pursuant to an exception to the rule\r\n  against hearsay.Â  Finding no enumerated hearsay exception,[7] Judge McLeod relied on the decision of the Court of Appeals in Summersell v.\r\n    South Carolina Department of Public Safety, 334 S.C. 357, 513 S.E.2d 619\r\n  (Ct. App. 1999), vacated in part by 337 S.C. 19, 522 S.E.2d 144 (1999).\r\nIn Summersell, an officer responded to the call\r\n  of a citizen who had witnessed Summersell drive an automobile into a ditch.Â \r\n  When the officer arrived at the scene, she observed Summersell &quot;passed\r\n  out&quot; in the driver's seat of the automobile with the keys in the ignition.Â \r\n  The citizen assisted Summersell in exiting the vehicle because Summersell could\r\n  not do so on his own.Â  Id. at 361, 513 S.E.2d at 621.Â  According to the\r\n  officer, Summersell smelled strongly of alcohol, was unsteady on his feet, and\r\n  had extremely red eyes.Â  Id. at 362, 513 S.E.2d at 622.Â  Although the\r\n  officer did not witness Summersell driving the automobile, her investigation of\r\n  the scene revealed the tire tracks near the automobile were &quot;fresh&quot;\r\n  and the incident occurred &quot;sometime that evening.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nAs a result, the officer arrested Summersell for DUI.Â \r\n  After refusing to submit to a breathalyzer test, the Department suspended\r\n  Summersell's driving privileges.Â  The circuit court upheld the Hearing\r\n  Officer's decision to sustain the suspension of Summersell's driver's license.Â  Id. at 362, 513 S.E.2d 622.Â  \r\nOn appeal to the Court of Appeals, Summersell raised\r\n  several issues including whether the Hearing Officer erred in allowing the\r\n  Department to elicit hearsay testimony during the administrative hearing.Â \r\n  Because the citizen-witness did not testify at the hearing, Summersell claimed\r\n  the officer could not testify as to the citizen's observations of Summersell\r\n  driving the automobile into the ditch.Â  Id. at 364, 513 S.E.2d at 623.Â \r\n  Summersell's hearsay objection was overruled by the Hearing Officer.Â  Id.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the\r\n  circuit court, finding the officer's hearsay testimony was admissible as it was\r\n  related to probable cause for the arrest of Summersell.Â  Id. at 366, 513\r\n  S.E.2d at 624.Â  The court stated:\r\n\r\n\tAlthough it is generally correct to state the purpose\r\n  of a preliminary hearing is to &quot;apprise the defendant of the nature of the\r\n  State's evidence,&quot; its purpose is more specifically &quot;. . . to\r\n  establish that probable cause exists to continue the criminal process.Â  The\r\n  State has the burden of proving probable cause, but is not required to call all\r\n  of its potential witnesses.&quot;Â  To this end, we have previously held that\r\n  hearsay testimony as to the nature of the State's evidence is permissible.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nId. at 365, 513 S.E.2d at 624 (quoting State v. Dingle,\r\n  279 S.C. 278, 283-84, 306 S.E.2d 223, 226 (1983)). \r\nRelying on Summersell, Judge McLeod concluded\r\n  that &quot;South Carolina courts have promulgated a common law exception to\r\n  hearsay, to wit, that hearsay testimony is admissible to establish\r\n  probable cause to arrest.&quot;Â  Thus, Judge McLeod concluded that the Incident\r\n  Report as well as the other proffered evidence should have been admitted to\r\n  establish probable cause for McCarson's arrest.Â  Accordingly, Judge McLeod\r\n  reversed Hearing Officer Holland's order and remanded for a new hearing on the\r\n  merits as the record on appeal was &quot;woefully inadequate.&quot; \r\nOn remand, Hearing Officer Holland conducted a hearing\r\n  on March 12, 2008.Â  Trooper Jones appeared on behalf of the Department.Â  At the\r\n  onset of Jones's testimony, McCarson's counsel posited his hearsay objection to\r\n  Jones testifying as to Sergeant Kimbrell's observations of McCarson's erratic\r\n  driving.Â  In support of this objection, counsel challenged Judge McLeod's\r\n  reliance on Summersell given the subsequent history.[8]Â \r\n  Because Kimbrell's observations, which were conveyed to Jones and included in\r\n  the Incident Report, constituted inadmissible hearsay, counsel claimed this\r\n  evidence and the resultant documentary evidence should be suppressed.Â  \r\nBy order dated April 7, 2008, Hearing Officer Holland\r\n  specifically rejected Judge McLeod's ruling and declined to consider the\r\n  Department's hearsay testimony regarding probable cause for McCarson's arrest.Â \r\n  In rejecting Judge McLeod's reasoning, Holland not only discounted the ruling\r\n  in Summersell but declared it as without precedential value.Â  Without\r\n  the proffered evidence, Holland found that Trooper Jones failed to prove\r\n  McCarson was lawfully arrested for DUI.Â  Specifically, Holland found there was\r\n  no evidence of probable cause for the initial stop as Jones failed to present\r\n  testimony that McCarson was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence\r\n  of alcohol.Â  Consequently, Holland ordered the Department to restore\r\n  Respondent's driver's license.\r\nSubsequently, the Department appealed the order to the\r\n  ALC.Â  By order dated June 29, 2009, the Honorable Carolyn Matthews reversed the\r\n  Hearing Officer's order and reinstated McCarson's license suspension.\r\nJudge Matthews essentially adopted Judge McLeod's\r\n  analysis and found the proffered evidence was admissible pursuant to Summersell.Â \r\n  Based on this ruling, Judge Matthews concluded &quot;the only reasonable\r\n  inference to be drawn from the Incident Report is that [Trooper Jones] had\r\n  probable cause to arrest [McCarson] for driving under the influence.&quot;Â  She\r\n  explained, &quot;The report established prima facie evidence that [McCarson]\r\n  was driving erratically (driving over a curb, failed to yield right of way in\r\n  front of the officer, and improper left) thereby justifying the stop.&quot;Â  \r\nFollowing the denial of his motion for reconsideration,\r\n  McCarson appealed the ALC's order to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court\r\n  certified this appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nII. Discussion\r\nA.\r\nMcCarson\r\n  contends the primary question before this Court is &quot;whetherÂ  or not\r\n  hearsay evidence, in the form of an incident report containing evidence that\r\n  the testifying witness [cannot] independently testify to, can be admitted to\r\n  establish probable cause in the context of an administrative hearing conducted\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F)(1) (2006).&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  answering this question, McCarson claims the ALC's decision to admit the\r\n  challenged evidence was erroneous for the following reasons:Â  (1) Summersell should not have served as the basis for the ALC's decision as it was vacated by\r\n  this Court; (2) the Rules of Evidence, which are applicable in administrative\r\n  hearings, expressly exclude the hearsay testimony; and (3) our state common\r\n  law, which permits hearsay evidence to establish probable cause in preliminary\r\n  hearings for criminal cases, does not apply to administrative,\r\n  license-suspension hearings.Â  \r\n\r\nAs will be more\r\n  thoroughly discussed, we agree with each of McCarson's contentions.\r\nB.\r\nThe\r\n  DMVH is authorized to hear contested cases from the Department.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 1-23-660 (Supp. 2009); S.C. Dep't of Motor Vehicles v. Holtzclaw, 382\r\n  S.C. 344, 347, 675 S.E.2d 756, 757-58 (Ct. App. 2009), cert. denied (Mar. 9, 2010).Â  Thus, the DMVH is an agency under the Administrative\r\n  Procedures Act.Â  Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. at 347, 675 S.E.2d at 758; S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(2) (Supp. 2009).Â  Accordingly, appeals from Hearing\r\n  Officers must be taken to the ALC.Â  Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. at 347, 675\r\n  S.E.2d at 758; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-660 (Supp. 2009).Â  When reviewing a\r\n  decision of the ALC, this Court's standard of review is governed by section\r\n  1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610 (Supp. 2009).Â \r\n  An appellate court &quot;may reverse or modify the decision only if substantive\r\n  rights of the appellant have been prejudiced because the decision is clearly\r\n  erroneous in light of the reliable and substantial evidence on the whole\r\n  record, arbitrary or otherwise characterized by an abuse of discretion, or\r\n  affected by other error of law.&quot;Â  Holtzclaw, 382 S.C. at 347, 675\r\n  S.E.2d at 758 (citing section 1-23-610 of the South Carolina Code).\r\nC.\r\nBefore\r\n  addressing the merits of McCarson's appeal, we must initially consider a\r\n  threshold issue regarding the appealability of the ALC's order.\r\nThe\r\n  Department asserts McCarson's failure to appeal Judge McLeod's\r\n  &quot;remand&quot; order of January 15, 2008, precludes him from challenging\r\n  the admission of the Incident Report on hearsay grounds.Â  Because McCarson had\r\n  an opportunity to appeal Judge McLeod's order prior to the second hearing\r\n  before Hearing Officer Holland, the Department claims Judge McLeod's\r\n  &quot;outcome determinative&quot; ruling as to the admissibility of the\r\n  Incident Report is the law of the case. Â \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Department correctly cites the principle that an unappealed ruling\r\n  constitutes the law of the case,[9] we find Judge McLeod's order was interlocutory.Â  Because Judge McLeod remanded\r\n  the case to Hearing Officer Holland and ordered a new hearing to be conducted\r\n  in accordance with his evidentiary ruling, this order was not a final decision\r\n  on the merits.Â  See Foggie v. Gen. Elec. Co., 376 S.C. 384, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 395 (Ct. App. 2008) (recognizing that an order of the circuit court\r\n  remanding a case for additional proceedings before an administrative agency is\r\n  not final and, thus, not directly appealable).Â  Thus, we find McCarson's\r\n  challenge is still viable for this Court's consideration.\r\nD.\r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits of McCarson's appeal, our analysis begins with a consideration of\r\n  section 56-5-2951(F)(1).Â  As we interpret McCarson's arguments, he only\r\n  challenges this subsection with respect to his license suspension.Â \r\n  Specifically, the determination of whether he was &quot;lawfully arrested or\r\n  detained&quot; for DUI in order for the Department to suspend his driving\r\n  privileges.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F)(1) (2006).Â  \r\nThe key question\r\n  for our determination is whether Sergeant Kimbrell's observations of McCarson's\r\n  erratic driving were admissible through Jones's report and testimony in order\r\n  to establish probable cause for McCarson's DUI arrest as required by section\r\n  56-5-2951(F)(1). \r\nThe dispositive\r\n  question in determining the lawfulness of an arrest is whether there was\r\n  &quot;probable cause&quot; to make the arrest.Â  Wortman v. City of\r\n    Spartanburg, 310 S.C. 1, 4, 425 S.E.2d 18, 20 (1992).Â  &quot;Probable cause\r\n  is defined as a good faith belief that a person is guilty of a crime when this\r\n  belief rests upon such grounds as would induce an ordinarily prudent and\r\n  cautious person, under the circumstances, to believe likewise.&quot;Â  Id.\r\n&quot;Probable\r\n  cause for a warrantless arrest exists when the circumstances within the\r\n  arresting officer's knowledge are sufficient to lead a reasonable person to\r\n  believe that a crime had been committed by the person being arrested.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 49, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).Â  &quot;Whether\r\n  probable cause exists depends upon the totality of the circumstances\r\n  surrounding the information at the officer's disposal.&quot;Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  determining whether probable cause exists, &quot;all the evidence within the\r\n  arresting officer's knowledge may be considered, including the details observed\r\n  while responding to information received.&quot;Â  State v. Roper, 274\r\n  S.C. 14, 17, 260 S.E.2d 705, 706 (1979).\r\nWe find Sergeant Kimbrell's observations as conveyed through Jones's testimony and Incident\r\n  Report constituted quintessential hearsay.Â  \r\nHearsay is defined as &quot;a statement, other than one made by\r\n  the declarant while testifying at the trial or hearing, offered in evidence to\r\n  prove the truth of the matter asserted.&quot; Â Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  &quot;Hearsay\r\n  is inadmissible except as provided by statute, the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Evidence, or other court rules.&quot; Â State v. LaCoste, 347 S.C. 153,\r\n  160, 553 S.E.2d 464, 468 (Ct. App. 2001) (citing Rule 802, SCRE).\r\nThe rule against hearsay prohibits the admission of evidence of an\r\n  out- of-court statement by someone other than the person testifying that is\r\n  used to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  Watson v. State, 370\r\n  S.C. 68, 71, 634 S.E.2d 642, 644 (2006).Â  It is well settled that evidence is\r\n  not hearsay unless offered to prove the truth of the matter asserted.Â  State\r\n    v. Brown, 317 S.C. 55, 63, 451 S.E.2d 888, 894 (1994).Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the well-established definition of hearsay, Sergeant Kimbrell's observations\r\n  of McCarson's erratic driving constituted hearsay as it was testified to by\r\n  Trooper Jones and was offered to establish probable cause for the DUI arrest.\r\nBecause the Rules\r\n  of Evidence are clearly applicable to driver's license-suspension hearings,[10] the question becomes whether the challenged evidence is admissible pursuant to\r\n  a hearsay exception.\r\nLike the ALC, we do\r\n  not believe there are any enumerated hearsay exceptions that would permit the\r\n  admissibility of this evidence.[11]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the only potential avenue for admissibility is through our state's\r\n  jurisprudence regarding probable cause.Â  \r\nGiven this Court\r\n  expressly vacated the analysis of the Court of Appeals in Summersell, we\r\n  find the ALC erred in relying on this case as it was no longer precedential.Â \r\n  Furthermore, a review of this state's appellate decisions reveals that our\r\n  courts have permitted hearsay evidence to establish probable cause in the\r\n  limited context of a preliminary hearing.Â  See State v. Dingle,\r\n  279 S.C. 278, 306 S.E.2d 223 (1983) (holding an officer may present hearsay\r\n  testimony in a preliminary hearing to establish probable cause for arrest), abrogated\r\n    on other grounds by Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128 (1990); see\r\n      also State v. Thompson, 276 S.C. 616, 281 S.E.2d 216 (1981)\r\n  (concluding the State, during a preliminary hearing, was permitted to offer\r\n  hearsay testimony to establish probable cause for arrest; recognizing that the State\r\n  is not required to present all of its witnesses and evidence during a preliminary\r\n  hearing); State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979) (finding\r\n  it was permissible for chief investigating officer to read into the record\r\n  statements of other unavailable witnesses at a preliminary hearing given the\r\n  direct testimony of the officer's investigation was offered as well as the\r\n  hearsay testimony).Â  Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find these cases are inapplicable to a driver's license suspension hearing.Â  A\r\n  preliminary hearing, as its name suggests, is not a final adjudication of a\r\n  defendant's rights.Â  Instead, a preliminary hearing merely serves as a\r\n  determination of whether there is sufficient evidence to subject a defendant to\r\n  further criminal proceedings.Â  See Rule 2, SCRCrimP (providing for\r\n  preliminary hearings and stating in part that &quot;Any defendant charged with\r\n  a crime not triable by a magistrate shall be brought before a magistrate and\r\n  shall be given notice of his right to a preliminary hearing solely to determine\r\n  whether sufficient evidence exists to warrant the defendant's detention and\r\n  trial&quot;); State v. Ramsey, 381 S.C. 375, 376, 673 S.E.2d 428, 428-29\r\n  (2009) (&quot;The purpose of a preliminary examination is\r\n  to determine whether probable cause exists to believe that the\r\n  defendant committed the crime and to warrant the defendant's subsequent\r\n  trial.&quot;).\r\nIn contrast, a\r\n  license-suspension hearing may potentially terminate an important interest of\r\n  the licensee.Â  See Bell v. Burson, 402 U.S. 535, 539 (1971)\r\n  (&quot;Once licenses are issued, . . ., their continued possession may become\r\n  essential in the pursuit of a livelihood.Â  Suspension of issued licenses thus\r\n  involves state action that adjudicates important interests of the licensees.Â \r\n  In such cases the licenses are not to be taken away without the procedural due\r\n  process required by the Fourteenth Amendment.&quot;); Hipp v. S.C. Dep't of\r\n    Motor Vehicles, 381 S.C. 323, 325, 673 S.E.2d 416, 417 (2009) (&quot;A person's interest in his driver's license is property\r\n  that a state may not take away without satisfying the requirements of due\r\n  process.&quot;).\r\nBecause a\r\n  license-suspension hearing constitutes a final adjudication of an important\r\n  interest, we believe the Legislature promulgated section 56-5-2951 in such a\r\n  way that guards against an automatic or rote elimination of this interest.Â \r\n  Specifically, this section sets forth several statutory prerequisites that must\r\n  be established before a Hearing Officer suspends a citizen's driver's license\r\n  following an arrest for DUI.Â  In the instant case, a determination of whether McCarson was lawfully arrested or detained for DUI.Â  By including this element\r\n  in section 56-5-2951, the Legislature placed the burden on the Department to\r\n  present sufficient evidence of probable cause.Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  the significant difference between a preliminary hearing and a\r\n  license-suspension hearing, we decline to extend the probable cause cases relied\r\n  on by the Department to circumvent the well-established rules against hearsay.Â \r\n  Thus, in proving that a driver was lawfully arrested or detained for DUI, the Department\r\n  must present admissible evidence of probable cause.Â  If we were to find\r\n  otherwise, we would essentially render meaningless the procedure established by\r\n  our Legislature in section 56-5-2951.\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we hold the Department failed to present admissible evidence\r\n  that McCarson was lawfully arrested or detained for DUI.Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  the ALC erred in reversing the Hearing Officer's order reinstating McCarson's\r\n  driver's license privileges.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES and HEARN JJ., concur.

Alford, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26917\r\nHeard September 21, 2010 - Filed January\r\n  24, 2011 \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tBobby\r\n  G. Frederick and Laura L. Hiller, both of Myrtle Beach, for Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\tSolicitor\r\n  Paula Knox Brown, of Rock Hill, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In\r\n  this case, Tyler M. Harris (Appellant) claims that section 20-7-8920 of the\r\n  South Carolina Code, now section 63-19-2440 (hereinafter section 63-19-2440),\r\n  is unconstitutional because it conflicts with Article XVII, section 14 of the\r\n  South Carolina Constitution.Â  Section 63-19-2440 makes it illegal for persons\r\n  under the age of twenty-one to &quot;consume, or knowingly possess beer, ale,\r\n  porter, wine, or other similar malt or fermented beverage.&quot; Article XVII,\r\n  section 14 of the our Constitution deems citizens over eighteen to have full\r\n  legal rights and responsibilities, with the sole exception that the General\r\n  Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until the age\r\n  of twenty-one.Â  We construe the term &quot;sale&quot; broadly and therefore\r\n  affirm Appellant's conviction.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  October 10, 2007, Appellant was a rear passenger in a vehicle stopped for a\r\n  traffic violation in the city of Rock Hill, South Carolina.Â  After admitting to\r\n  the officer that he had consumed two beers, Appellant, who was then twenty\r\n  years old, was cited for possession of beer under twenty-one, pursuant to\r\n  section 20-7-8920, and for public disorderly conduct.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  municipal court convicted Appellant of the possession charge.Â  Appellant\r\n  thereafter appealed his conviction to the circuit court, arguing three grounds:\r\n  (1) the city of Rock Hill failed to prove jurisdiction over the matter, (2)\r\n  beer is not an alcoholic beverage as defined by the statute, and (3) the\r\n  statute under which Appellant was convicted is unconstitutional.Â  The circuit\r\n  court affirmed the conviction. Appellant then filed a timely appeal to the\r\n  court of appeals.Â  This case is before this Court under Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â \r\n  Appellant preserves only the constitutional issue in this appeal.\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\n  REVIEW\r\nAn\r\n  issue regarding statutory interpretation is a question of law. Â Jeter v. S.C.\r\n    Dept. of Transp., 369 S.C. 433, 438, 146, 633 S.E.2d 143 (2006).Â  Â In a\r\n  case raising a novel question of law, the appellate court is free to decide the\r\n  question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Ex parte Capital\r\n    U-Drive-It, Inc., 369 S.C. 1, 6, 630 S.E.2d 464, 467&nbsp;(2006); Hagood\r\n      v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 194, 607 S.E.2d 707, 708&nbsp;(2005).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.&nbsp; Construction of Article XVII, section 14 of the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution\r\nAppellant\r\n  argues that section 63-19-2440 of the South Carolina Code conflicts with\r\n  Article XVII, section 14 of the South Carolina Constitution because the statute\r\n  restricts more than the sale of alcoholic beverages to eighteen to twenty year\r\n  olds by also restricting their possession and consumption.Â  We disagree.\r\nA.&nbsp;&nbsp; Applicable Law\r\nAn amendment to the South Carolina Constitution\r\n  originates by proposal before the General Assembly and, if passed by two-thirds\r\n  vote in each House, is then submitted to the people of South Carolina in the\r\n  next general election. Â S.C. Const. art. XVI, Â§ 1.Â  If the electorate votes in\r\n  favor of the amendment, the General Assembly makes the final decision as to its\r\n  ratification by securing a simple majority vote in each House. Â Id.Â  \r\nWhen this Court is called to interpret our\r\n  Constitution, it is guided by the principle that both the citizenry and the\r\n  General Assembly have worked to create the governing law. Â See Miller v.\r\n    Farr, 243 S.C. 342, 133 S.E.2d 838, 841 (1962) (stating that the Court's\r\n  efforts in construing the South Carolina Constitution are aimed at assessing\r\n  the intent of its framers and the people who adopted it).Â  Therefore, the Court\r\n  will look at the &quot;ordinary and popular meaning of the words used,&quot; Richardson\r\n    v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 350 S.C. 291, 294, 566 S.E.2d 523, 525 (2002),\r\n  keeping in mind that amendments to our Constitution become effective largely\r\n  through the legislative process. Â Miller v. Farr, 243 S.C. 342, 347, 133\r\n  S.E.2d 838, 841 (1963).Â  For this reason, &quot;the Court applies rules similar\r\n  to those relating to the construction of statutes&quot; to arrive at the ultimate\r\n  goal of deriving the intent of those who adopted it. Â Id.Â  Â Â Â \r\nIn determining whether a statute complies with the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution, the Court will, if possible, \r\n\r\n\tconstrue[] [the statute] so as to render it valid;\r\n  every presumption will be made in favor of the constitutionality of a\r\n  legislative enactment; and a statute will be declared\r\n  unconstitutional only when its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave no\r\n  room for reasonable doubt that it violates some provision of the Constitution.\r\n\r\nMoseley v. Welch, 209 S.C. 19, 26-27, 39 S.E.2d 133, 137\r\n  (1946). \r\nThe power of our state legislature is\r\n  plenary, and therefore, the authority given to the General Assembly by our\r\n  Constitution is a limitation of legislative power, not a grant. Â Id. at\r\n  26, 39 S.E.2d at 137. This means that &quot;the General Assembly may enact any\r\n  law not expressly, or by clear implication, prohibited by the State or Federal\r\n  Constitutions . . . .&quot; Â Id.Â  At the same time, when determining the\r\n  effect of statutory language, &quot;the\r\n  canon of construction 'expressio unius est exclusio alterius' or 'inclusio\r\n    unius exclusio alterius' holds that 'to express or include one thing\r\n  implies the exclusion of another, or the alternative.'&quot; Â State v. Bolin,\r\n  378 S.C. 96, 100, 662 S.E.2d 38, 40 (2008) (quoting Hodges v. Rainey,\r\n  341 S.C. 79, 533 S.E.2d 578 (2000)).\r\nAbsent ambiguity, the court will look to the plain meaning of the\r\n  words used to determine their effect. Â Hodges, 341\r\n  S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581. However, the plain meaning rule is subject to this caveat:\r\n\r\n\tHowever plain the ordinary meaning of the\r\n  words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to\r\n  accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly\r\n  have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative\r\n  intention. If possible, the court will construe the statute so as to escape the\r\n  absurdity and carry the intention into effect.\r\n\r\nId. (quoting Kiriakides v.\r\n  United Artists Commc'ns, Inc., 312\r\n  S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)).Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; State v. Bolin\r\nAppellant\r\n  relies partly upon this Court's finding in State v. Bolin, 378 S.C. 96,\r\n  662 S.E.2d 38 (2008), to support its argument that section 63-19-2440 is\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  In Bolin, this Court held that the General Assembly\r\n  exceeded its authority under Article XVII, section 14 by restricting hand gun\r\n  possession among persons aged eighteen to twenty. Â 378 S.C. at 100, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  at 40.Â  The Court looked at the plain language of the amendment to find that\r\n  the constitution's preservation of authority for the General Assembly to regulate\r\n  this age group with respect to alcoholic beverages necessarily implied the\r\n  exclusion of any authority the General Assembly may have had to restrict other\r\n  rights of this age group. Â Id. \r\nThe\r\n  same canons of statutory construction used in Bolin lead to a different\r\n  conclusion here.Â  Therefore, in reaching the conclusion that sale has a broad\r\n  meaning, Bolin remains intact. \r\nB.&nbsp; Construing &quot;Sale&quot;\r\nSale\r\n  is defined as &quot;the exchange of goods or services for money.&quot;Â  American\r\n    Heritage Dictionary (4th ed. 2001). It is our opinion, however, that the\r\n  exchange of a good necessarily implies it will be possessed by the buyer.Â \r\n  Further, if the Court were to narrowly read sale as authorizing the General\r\n  Assembly to restrict only the exchange of alcoholic beverages for money, an\r\n  absurd result could follow that might defeat the will of the people of South\r\n  Carolina and the General Assembly.Â  In this instance, the exchange of money\r\n  would be the only technicality sitting between an eighteen year old and her\r\n  access to alcohol.Â  For example, bars could supply alcoholic beverages for free\r\n  in efforts to attract older, paying patrons; retailers could give free beer in\r\n  exchange for the purchase of other store merchandise; and persons over the age\r\n  of twenty could openly purchase alcohol for this age group with impunity. The\r\n  possibility of an absurd result compels us to look beyond the face of the\r\n  amendment to ascertain the intent of its adopters.Â  \r\n1.&nbsp; Legislative History\r\nDuring\r\n  the 1973 legislative session, the General Assembly considered and passed Joint\r\n  Resolution H.1018 (Resolution) to submit a constitutional amendment to voters\r\n  regarding the legal rights of eighteen year olds.Â  H.R.J. Res. 1018, 100th Gen.\r\n  Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (S.C. 1973).Â  At the time the legislature considered\r\n  this Resolution, it was unlawful in South Carolina for persons under the age of\r\n  twenty-one to purchase or possess any alcoholic liquors.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  1-4-96.1 (1962). Retailers were similarly prohibited from selling, bartering,\r\n  exchanging, giving, transferring, or delivering alcoholic liquors to minors. Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 1-4-78(3)(c).Â  The same rules applied to the purchase, possession,\r\n  and sale of beer and wine, except that the prohibitions affected persons under\r\n  age eighteen. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-4-203 &amp; 1-4-203.4 (1962).\r\nThe\r\n  original reading of the Resolution gave unrestricted rights to eighteen year\r\n  olds, providing that &quot;persons eighteen years of age or older shall be\r\n  endowed with full legal capacity.&quot; Â H.R.J. Res. 1018, 100th Gen. Assemb.,\r\n  1st Reg. Sess. (S.C. Feb. 8, 1973).Â  Incorporating this amendment into the\r\n  constitution would have created a number of new rights for eighteen year olds,[1] including the right to purchase, possess, and consume alcoholic liquors.Â  The\r\n  House passed this Resolution, and after three readings on the Senate floor, the\r\n  Senate designated it to be carried over. Â Id. at Apr. 3, 1973.Â  However,\r\n  the motion to carry the Resolution forward was suddenly withdrawn and members\r\n  of the Senate Judiciary Committee proposed to amend the Resolution by\r\n  inserting, &quot;provided, that the General Assembly may restrict the\r\n  sale of alcoholic beverages to persons until age twenty-one.&quot;Â  Id. at Apr. 5, 1973 (emphasis in original). Â An original draft of this proposed\r\n  change reveals that the Judiciary Committee first used the term\r\n  &quot;purchase,&quot; which was later stricken to substitute the word\r\n  &quot;sale.&quot;Â  Memorandum to Senate Clerk to be entered in the Senate Journal\r\n  (Apr. 4, 1973) (on file at the South Carolina State Archives).Â  The description\r\n  given to the Resolution for purposes of floor discussion was broader.Â  Id.Â \r\n  It read:\r\n\r\n\tA Joint\r\n  Resolution proposing an amendment to Article XVII of the Constitution of South\r\n  Carolina, 1895, which contains various miscellaneous provisions, so as to\r\n  provide that person eighteen years of age or older shall be endowed with full\r\n  legal capacity except in relation to alcoholic beverages.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nThe\r\n  House voted favorably upon this change, and the General Assembly ratified the\r\n  Resolution on April 12, 1973. Â Id.Â  The following language was submitted\r\n  to voters in the general election of 1974:\r\n\r\n\tEvery\r\n  citizen who is eighteen years of age or older, not laboring under disabilities\r\n  prescribed in this Constitution or otherwise established by law, shall be\r\n  deemed sui juris and endowed with full legal rights and responsibilities, provided,\r\n  that the General Assembly may restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to\r\n  persons until age twenty-one.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis in original).Â  Upon passage by the voters,\r\n  the General Assembly ultimately ratified the amendment on February 6, 1975. Â H.R.J.\r\n  Res. 1018, 102d Gen. Assemb., 1st Reg. Sess. (S.C. 1975).\r\nThe\r\n  Journals of the House and Senate do not reflect the legislature's purpose for\r\n  suddenly inserting a provision into the Resolution that reserved its power to\r\n  regulate access to alcoholic beverages among this age group.Â Â  It stands to\r\n  reason, however, that a policy interest was at hand.Â  The legislature's duty to\r\n  promote the safety and welfare of the community could be curtailed by\r\n  relinquishing its power to regulate the availability of alcoholic beverages to\r\n  young people.Â  The same cannot be said of other rights created by this\r\n  amendment, such as the right to marry, enter into contracts, or administer\r\n  estates.Â  Because we believe the legislature reserved this power for health and\r\n  safety reasons, we do not believe it would have retained this power if it had a\r\n  hollow reach.[2] The broad description given to the Resolution on the House and Senate floor\r\n  supports this notion.Â  Further, subscribing to Appellant's narrow construction\r\n  of sale insinuates that by inserting this language, the legislature only wished\r\n  to retain its power over alcohol commerce among this age group.Â  We do not\r\n  believe this to be true.\r\nWith\r\n  respect for the principle that every presumption will be made in favor of the\r\n  constitutionality of a statute, we construe the term sale, as used in\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution, broadly. Therefore, when the General Assembly\r\n  reserved its power to restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages, it meant\r\n  to also reserve its power to restrict the purchase and possession of alcoholic beverages, thereby maintaining the statutory framework as it stood\r\n  at the time.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we believe that Article XVII, section 14 of the South\r\n  Carolina Constitution affords the General Assembly the power to restrict the\r\n  sale, purchase, and possession of alcoholic beverages among persons under the\r\n  age of twenty-one.Â  Therefore, we hold that section 63-19-2440 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code is constitutional.Â  \r\nAffirmed.\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, we cannot\r\n  construe the term 'sale' to embrace the terms purchase and/or possession.Â  See City of Anderson v. Fant, 96 S.C. 5, 79 S.E. 641 (1913).Â  I therefore\r\n  reluctantly conclude that under S.C. Const. art. XVII, Â§ 14, the legislature\r\n  may only restrict the sale of alcoholic beverages to adults between the ages of\r\n  eighteen and twenty-one.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The statutory age of majority in 1973 was twenty-one, unless otherwise noted in\r\n  the Code.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-62-403(a)(11) (defining\r\n  &quot;minor&quot; in the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act as &quot;a person who has\r\n  not attained the age of twenty-one years&quot;), 5-19-417 (a person may not be\r\n  an executor of an estate until attaining the age of twenty-one), 5-20-24.1\r\n  (providing that an applicant for a marriage license who is under the age of\r\n  twenty-one and cannot show proof of age by birth certificate must obtain consent\r\n  from a parent or guardian), 2-10-128(1) (a person below the age of twenty-one\r\n  is considered disabled for purposes of the adverse possession statute),\r\n  2-11-153 (while educational institutions can enforce contracts and promissory\r\n  notes against persons over age sixteen, certain other contracts cannot be\r\n  ratified until the undergraduate has reached the age of majority, twenty-one)\r\n  (1962).\r\n[2] We note that the South Carolina Code creates two schemes of alcoholic beverage\r\n  regulation.Â  Title 4 of the 1962 Code, Alcohol and Alcoholic Beverages, is\r\n  divided into Chapter 1, which regulates alcoholic liquors, and Chapter 2, which\r\n  regulates beer, porter, and wine.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 1-4-1 &amp; 1-4-201\r\n  (1962).Â  Thus, &quot;alcoholic beverages&quot; was an umbrella term in the\r\n  Code.Â  Accordingly, we believe that when the General Assembly used the term\r\n  &quot;alcoholic beverages&quot; in the State Constitution, it intended to reserve\r\n  a broad right to regulate alcohol usage among persons below the age of\r\n  twenty-one; a right that included the regulation of both alcoholic liquors and\r\n  beer, wine, and porter.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26918","title":"Jackson v.

Acts ---- (identifying the various sources of\r\n  funding reflected in the appropriations bill).\r\nIn his Veto 52,\r\n  Governor Sanford purported to veto the entire amount of General Funds\r\n  appropriated to the Board.Â  In his accompanying veto message, Governor Sanford stated\r\n  the Board had &quot;over $1 billion in carry-forward funds&quot; and could use &quot;available\r\n  funds and . . . cost-cutting measures&quot; to &quot;sustain [the] agency . . .\r\n  over the next fiscal year.&quot;Â  The House of Representatives sustained this\r\n  veto.\r\nFollowing the veto,\r\n  the Board identified another source for part of the vetoed funds by using flexibility\r\n  provisos included in the appropriations act.Â  Relying on these provisos for\r\n  authority, the Board transferred the full balance out of the Rural\r\n  Infrastructure Bank Trust Fund (approximately $13.3 million) and used that\r\n  money for &quot;payroll and essential operating costs,&quot; which would have\r\n  been funded by the General Funds appropriated by the General Assembly.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  brought this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Governor's Veto 52\r\n  was invalid and that the transfer of funds from the Rural Infrastructure Bank\r\n  Trust Fund via the provisos was unconstitutional.[3]\r\nII.\r\nArticle\r\n  IV, section 21 of the South Carolina Constitution provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tEvery bill or joint resolution which shall have passed\r\n  the General Assembly . . . shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the\r\n  Governor, and if he approves he shall sign it; if not, he shall return it, with\r\n  his objections, to the house in which it originated, which shall enter the\r\n  objections at large on its Journal and proceed to reconsider it. . . .\r\n\tBills appropriating money out of the Treasury shall\r\n  specify the objects and purposes for which the same are made, and appropriate\r\n  to them respectively their several amounts in distinct items and sections.Â  If\r\n  the Governor shall not approve any one or more of the items or sections\r\n  contained in any bill appropriating money, but shall approve of the residue\r\n  thereof, it shall become a law as to the residue in like manner as if he had\r\n  signed it.Â  The Governor shall then return the bill with his objections to the\r\n  items or sections of the same not approved by him to the house in which the\r\n  bill originated, which house shall enter the objections at large upon its\r\n  Journal and proceed to reconsider so much of the bill as is not approved by the\r\n  Governor. . . .\r\n\r\n&quot;The\r\n  veto power can be exercised only when clearly authorized by the constitution,\r\n  and the language conferring it is to be strictly construed.&quot;Â  Drummond\r\n    v. Beasley, 331 S.C. 559, 564, 503 S.E.2d 455, 457 (1998).Â  The veto power\r\n  is &quot;a negative power to void a distinct item.&quot;Â  Id.; cf. State\r\n    ex rel. Long v. Jones, 99 S.C. 89, 92, 82 S.E. 882, 883 (1914) (holding\r\n  that when a veto was sustained &quot;everything embraced in that item failed to\r\n  become law&quot;).Â  In Drummond v. Beasley, we explained that the\r\n  Governor may not &quot;modify legislation rather than nullify legislation&quot;\r\n  by removing conditions and restrictions on expenditures while leaving the\r\n  expenditures themselves intact.Â  331 S.C. at 560 n.1, 563-64, 503 S.E.2d at 456-57.Â \r\n  The Florida Supreme Court has explained:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  veto power is intended to be a negative power, the power to nullify . . .\r\n  legislative intent.Â  It is not designed to alter or amend legislative intent. .\r\n  . . [T]he veto must, in effect, destroy the fund.Â  Otherwise, the governor\r\n  could legislate by altering the purpose for which the money was allocated.\r\n\r\nBrown v. Firestone, 382 So. 2d 654, 664-65 (Fla. 1980).\r\nWe apply\r\n  a &quot;common sense construction&quot; when interpreting the General Assembly's\r\n  obligation to organize appropriation bills into &quot;distinct items or\r\n  sections&quot; and when interpreting the power of the Governor to veto such &quot;items\r\n  or sections.&quot; Â E.g., S.C. Coin Operators Ass'n v. Beasley,\r\n  320 S.C. 183, 187, 464 S.E.2d 103, 105 (1995); Cox v. Bates, 237 S.C.\r\n  198, 218-20, 116 S.E.2d 828, 836-37 (1960).\r\nIII.\r\nThe dispositive\r\n  question before the Court may be framed in one of two ways, either of which\r\n  compels a finding of an unconstitutional veto.Â  First, a Governor is\r\n  constitutionally permitted to veto an item in its entirety, but not partially.Â \r\n  Stated differently, we must determine whether Veto 52 was a nullification of\r\n  legislation or a modification of legislation.Â  Putting these concepts together,\r\n  the rule of law is that a veto of an item in its entirety is a nullification,\r\n  while a veto of only part of an item is a modification.Â  If a nullification,\r\n  Veto 52 is constitutional; if a modification, Veto 52 is unconstitutional.\r\nWe\r\n  begin with defining an &quot;item&quot;[4] for constitutional purposes. Our constitution uses the term &quot;item&quot; to\r\n  embrace a specified sum of money together with the &quot;object and purpose&quot;\r\n  for which the appropriation is made. S.C. Const. art. IV, Â§ 21.Â  Our case law\r\n  is in accord.Â  State ex rel. Walker v. Derham, 61 S.C. 258, 262, 39 S.E.\r\n  379, 380 (1901) (defining the act of appropriation as &quot;to designate some\r\n  specific sum of money for a particular purpose or individual&quot;).Â  Other\r\n  jurisdictions have employed similar definitions for the term &quot;item.&quot;Â  E.g., Henry v. Edwards, 346 So. 2d 153, 157 (La. 1977) (&quot;[T]he\r\n  word 'item' signifies a sum of money dedicated to a specific purpose, a\r\n  separate fiscal unit.&quot;); Brault v. Holleman, 230 S.E.2d 238, 242\r\n  (Va. 1976) (defining an item of appropriation as &quot;an indivisible sum of\r\n  money dedicated to a stated purpose&quot;).\r\nPetitioner's\r\n  first argument focuses on the spatial format of the appropriations bill into columns as opposed to lines.Â  Petitioner contends the Governor could veto only lines of an appropriation bill, not columns.Â  This argument appears to be\r\n  premised on the notion of a Governor's &quot;line item veto.&quot;Â  To be sure,\r\n  the phrase &quot;line item veto&quot; has currency as a colloquial expression, but\r\n  it is not part of our constitutional framework.Â  Our constitution permits the\r\n  Governor to veto &quot;items or sections&quot; of bills that appropriate money,\r\n  but it does not require that these items or sections be organized into lines.Â \r\n  Thus, we reject Petitioner's argument and agree with the Governor that the\r\n  spatial arrangement of numbers on the page does not dictate the definition of\r\n  an &quot;item.&quot;[5]\r\nWhile\r\n  we agree that the arrangement of information in a column, rather than in a\r\n  line, is irrelevant, we disagree with Governor Sanford and Respondent Eckstrom\r\n  that the column designating the amount of General Funds to be expended was a standalone\r\n  &quot;item&quot; that could be vetoed without vetoing the objects and purposes\r\n  to which those General Funds were devoted. Â The Governor vetoed one source of\r\n  appropriated funds while leaving the remainder of the total appropriation, and\r\n  the specified &quot;objects and purposes&quot; of the appropriation, intact.[6]\r\nThe Governor\r\n  attempted to veto funds arising from a particular source, but he did not veto\r\n  the purpose to which those funds were allocated.Â  The net result, then, was\r\n  that the total appropriation for each of the Board's programs, positions, and\r\n  expenses was reduced by the amount the General Assembly had designated to be\r\n  drawn from the General Fund, but the programs, positions, and expenses\r\n  themselves were not eliminated.[7]Â \r\n  This was an improper modification of legislation.Â  See Drummond, 331\r\n  S.C. at 564, 503 S.E.2d at 457 (finding a veto invalid because it &quot;modif[ied]\r\n  legislation rather than nullif[ied] legislation&quot;).Â  As the Florida Supreme\r\n  Court has explained:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tWhat the\r\n  Governor requests is little different than the power to reduce.Â  In each\r\n  of the line items at issue here, the legislature has identified only one\r\n  purpose, which will be achieved with sums taken from several separate funding\r\n  sources.Â  The Governor argues essentially that we must consider each of these\r\n  sources to be a &quot;fund&quot; subject to veto.Â  We, however, believe that\r\n  the existence of such a fund cannot be determined solely by reference to the\r\n  fact that a specific sum is stated in the Act itself.Â  There also must be\r\n  consideration of the legislature's purpose.\r\n\t. . . If the legislature's purpose is to expend a\r\n  specific amount of money for a single stated purpose, then the Governor has no\r\n  authority to reduce that amount by vetoing one of several funding sources.Â  The\r\n  Governor must veto all or none.\r\n\tAny requirement less than this would seriously erode\r\n  the legislature's power to decide the level of appropriations.Â  Permitting the\r\n  vetoing of individual funding sources comes too close to authorizing the\r\n  Governor to reduce appropriations.\r\n\r\nFlorida House of\r\n  Representatives v. Martinez, 555 So. 2d\r\n  839, 845-46 (Fla. 1990) (emphasis in original); see also Stong v. People ex rel.\r\n    Curran, 220 P. 999, 1000, 1003 (Colo. 1923) (holding the Colorado governor &quot;ha[d]\r\n  no power to veto a portion of a separate, distinct, and indivisible item,&quot;\r\n  and therefore, did not have the power to veto part of a salary while leaving\r\n  the salaried position intact).\r\nThe\r\n  net effect of Veto 52 was a veto of part of an item, resulting in\r\n  modification of legislation, which is an unconstitutional exercise of the veto\r\n  power. Â Cf. Colorado General Assembly v. Lamm, 704 P.2d 1371,\r\n  1384 (Colo. 1985) (&quot;[W]e conclude that the source of funding is as much a\r\n  part of an item of appropriation as the amount of money appropriated and the\r\n  purpose to which it is to be devoted.Â  It cannot be removed from the bill\r\n  without affecting the legislature's intendment in enacting the measure.&quot;).Â \r\n  As correctly stated in Senator McConnell's brief, &quot;[i]f a line in the\r\n  appropriations bill is vetoed in a constitutional manner and the veto is\r\n  sustained, then the line is stricken and there is no longer any authority to\r\n  expend state funds for the purpose stated on the line.&quot;\r\nThe Governor seeks refuge in\r\n  the contention that Veto 52 is consistent with the historical practice of South\r\n  Carolina Governors.Â  Because other Governors have exercised their veto\r\n  authority in a similar manner, the argument goes, the Court should defer to the\r\n  historical practice.Â  The Governor's position has ostensible merit, for &quot;[l]ong\r\n  established practice has great weight in interpreting constitutional\r\n  provision[s] relative to executive veto power.&quot;Â  Coin Operators,\r\n  320 S.C. at 188, 464 S.E.2d at 105. Â However, we are\r\n  not persuaded that the practice of vetoing only one of several sources of funds\r\n  without vetoing the corresponding objects and purposes is as well rooted in our\r\n  history as the Governor suggests.Â  The Governor cites in his brief to vetoes in\r\n  1935 and 1948 as similar to Veto 52.Â  We do not read the cited 1935 and 1948 vetoes\r\n  as similar.Â  The acts at issue did not list General Funds separately from any\r\n  other funds.Â  See Act No. 347, 1935 S.C. Acts 505, 546; Act No. 849,\r\n  1948 S.C. Acts 2091, 2167-69.Â  These examples and others present vetoes of the\r\n  total funding and the corresponding objects and purposes.Â  Thus, we are not\r\n  convinced that the interpretation advanced by the Governor is as &quot;long\r\n  established&quot; as he contends.Â  In any event, a veto of only one of several\r\n  sources of funds is patently in conflict with the Governor's authority under\r\n  our constitution.\r\nIV.\r\nWe find the Governor's veto of only the General Fund portion\r\n  of the appropriation to the Budget and Control Board was unconstitutional\r\n  because it exceeded the authority granted to him by article IV, section 21 of\r\n  the South Carolina Constitution.Â  The Governor is empowered to veto &quot;items,&quot;\r\n  which comprise both the designated funds and the objects and purposes for which\r\n  the appropriation is intended.Â  By vetoing only one of several sources of\r\n  funds, the Governor vetoed only part of an item, rendering the veto\r\n  unconstitutional.Â  Having declared Veto 52 unconstitutional, we hold the\r\n  General Assembly's appropriation of General Funds to the Budget and Control\r\n  Board is effective and has the force of law.Â  We, therefore, need not reach\r\n  Petitioner's challenge concerning the provisos.\r\nJUDGMENT FOR\r\n  PETITIONER.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Respondents Fusco, Chellis, Leatherman, Harrell, Cooper, and McConnell\r\n  join Petitioner in asserting that the veto was unconstitutional.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Petitioner argued the transfer of funds violated the separation of\r\n  powers mandated by article I, section 8 of the South Carolina Constitution\r\n  because the Budget and Control Board transferred and expended money for a\r\n  purpose other than the one assigned by the General Assembly.Â  In addition,\r\n  Petitioner argued the budget provisos, as applied, were an unconstitutional\r\n  delegation of legislative power.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Petitioner asserted standing on the ground that the Town of Timmonsville\r\n  is in need of financial assistance to improve its water and wastewater\r\n  treatment infrastructure, and therefore, &quot;interested in monies\r\n  appropriated by the Legislature for rural infrastructure development.&quot;Â \r\n  None of the Respondents have argued in their briefs that Petitioner lacks\r\n  standing.Â  See Bardoon Properties, NV v. Eidolon Corp., 326 S.C. 166,\r\n  169-71, 485 S.E.2d 371, 373-74 (1997) (explaining that &quot;a party's lack of\r\n  standing as a real party in interest&quot; does not deprive the court of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction).\r\n[4]&nbsp; We are not presented with a dispute over the meaning of the term\r\n  &quot;sections.&quot;\r\n[5]&nbsp; There is no assertion here that the General Assembly failed to comply\r\n  with its constitutional mandate to &quot;specify the objects and purposes for\r\n  which the [appropriations] are made, and appropriate to them respectively their\r\n  several amounts in distinct items and sections.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art. IV, Â§\r\n  21.Â  It is axiomatic that the General Assembly cannot ignore its constitutional\r\n  mandate and present an appropriations bill in a manner that forecloses the\r\n  Governor's veto authority.Â  Cf. Henry, 346 So. 2d at 158 (&quot;The\r\n  legislature cannot by location of a bill give it immunity from executive\r\n  veto.&quot;).\r\n[6]&nbsp; The Governor has argued that because the total amount appropriated to a\r\n  particular purpose often includes both federal and state funds, it might be\r\n  impossible as a practical matter to veto the entire amount.Â  The Governor's\r\n  power to veto &quot;items or sections&quot; expressly extends to all\r\n  &quot;[b]ills appropriating money out of the Treasury.&quot;Â  S.C. Const. art.\r\n  IV, Â§ 21.Â  Federal funds are deposited into the state treasury and allocated in\r\n  the annual appropriations bill.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-65-20 (2005) (requiring the\r\n  General Assembly to &quot;appropriate all anticipated federal and other funds\r\n  for the operations of state agencies in the appropriations act&quot;); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 11-13-45 (Supp. 2009) (&quot;All federal funds received must be\r\n  deposited in the State Treasury, if not in conflict with federal regulations,\r\n  and withdrawn from the State Treasury as needed . . . .&quot;).Â  Thus, we do\r\n  not believe the Governor would be thwarted in the exercise of his veto power by\r\n  the mere fact that a particular item included both federal and state funds.\r\n[7]&nbsp; In some instances, the General Fund accounted for the entire budget for\r\n  a particular program.Â  Nevertheless, the Governor did not veto these programs; he\r\n  vetoed only their funding.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26919","title":"Wiegand v.

Â While those policy limits were paid to Wiegand,\r\n  his damages greatly exceeded the limits of the drunk driver's policy.Â Â \r\n  Beginning in 1980, Wiegand's cars had been insured with USAA.Â  \r\nAfter the first ten years of receiving automobile insurance coverage\r\n  from USAA, Wiegand received a form entitled &quot;Offer of Optional Additional\r\n  Uninsured and Underinsured Automobile Insurance Coverages.&quot;Â Â  It is\r\n  undisputed that Wiegand signed the form, but the parties disagree over who\r\n  actually completed the form: Wiegand or another person.Â Â  Regardless of who\r\n  completed the form, next to the question &quot;do you wish to purchase\r\n  underinsured motorist coverage,&quot; the box marked &quot;no&quot; was\r\n  checked.Â  The form contained the following pertinent language: \r\n\r\n\tUnderinsured motorist coverage compensates you, or\r\n  other persons insured under your automobile insurance policy, including\r\n  passengers within your motor vehicle, for amounts that you, or your passengers,\r\n  may be legally entitled to collect as damages from an owner or operator of an\r\n  at-fault underinsured motor vehicle.Â  An underinsured motor vehicle is a motor\r\n  vehicle that is covered by some form of liability insurance, but that liability\r\n  insurance coverage is not sufficient to fully compensate you for your\r\n  damages.Â Â  His policy pays the limits first, then yours pays the lessor of (1)\r\n  the remaining loss, or (2) your UIM limits.\r\n\tYour automobile insurance policy does not provide any\r\n  underinsured motorist coverage.Â  You have, however, a right to buy underinsured\r\n  motorist coverage in limits up to the limits of liability coverage you carry\r\n  under your automobile insurance policy.Â  Limits of underinsured motorist\r\n  coverage, together with the additional premiums you will be charged, are shown\r\n  upon this form. \r\n\t. . . . Â \r\n\tIn the future, if you wish to increase or to decrease\r\n  your limits of additional uninsured or underinsured coverage, you must then\r\n  contact us.\r\n\r\nFrom\r\n  1990 to 2004, Wiegand had continuous USAA coverage.Â Â  Wiegand's policy with\r\n  USAA at the time of the accident had liability limits of $25,000.00 per person\r\n  and $50,000.00 per accident.Â  USAA paid Wiegand's estate $26,000.00 for\r\n  personal injury protection benefits, and seatbelt and airbag benefits.\r\nDeborah\r\n  J. Wiegand (Wife), individually and as personal representative of Wiegand's estate,\r\n  commenced this action against USAA to recover UIM benefits for the damages in\r\n  excess of the amounts tendered by the other driver.Â Â  Wife sought reformation\r\n  of the policy to include UIM coverage in the same limits as the liability\r\n  coverage.Â  Both parties filed motions for summary judgment. \r\nThe\r\n  circuit court granted Respondent's motion for summary judgment, finding USAA\r\n  had not made a meaningful offer of UIM coverage to Wiegand.Â Â  This appeal\r\n  followed. \r\nISSUES\r\nUSAA\r\n  raises three issues on appeal: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in failing to give USAA \r\n\t\t\tthe benefit of the conclusive presumption that the UIM offer was meaningful based on section 38-77-350?\r\n\t\t\t\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in holding that a \r\n\t\t\tmeaningful offer of UIM coverage was not made to Wiegand as\r\n  required by State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance v. Wannamaker, 291\r\n  S.C. 518, 354 S.E.2d 555 (1987)? \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tDid the circuit court err in declining to hold that Wiegand waived his right to claim UIM benefits by\r\n  specifically declining the limit of coverage to which the circuit court\r\n  reformed the policy and by refusing to purchase UIM coverage? \r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLAW AND\r\n  ANALYSIS\r\nWhere\r\n  cross motions for summary judgment are filed, the parties concede the issue\r\n  before us should be decided as a matter of law.Â  Whether a form complies with\r\n  the requirements of section 38-77-350(A) is a question of law for this Court.Â Â  See Grinnell Corp. v. Wood, 389 S.C. 350, 357 n.3, 698 S.E.2d 796, 799 n.3\r\n  (2010).Â  &quot;Questions of law may be decided with no particular deference to\r\n  the trial court.&quot;Â  S.C. Dep't of Transp. v. M&amp;T Enters. of Mt.\r\n    Pleasant, LLC, 379 S.C. 645, 654, 667 S.E.2d 7, 12 (Ct. App. 2008); see\r\n      also Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 327, 534\r\n  S.E.2d 672, 675 (2000). Â Â USAA contends that under either section 38-77-350(A)\r\n  or Wannamaker, a meaningful offer of UIM coverage was made to Wiegand.Â Â \r\n  Wife contends that USAA cannot meet its burden under either the statute or Wannamaker to prove that a meaningful offer was made, and in addition, cannot take\r\n  advantage of the presumption found in section 38-77-350(B).Â  We agree with USAA\r\n  that a meaningful offer was made and reverse the circuit court's grant of\r\n  summary judgment.Â  \r\n\r\nThe General Assembly, in response to Wannamaker, passed an\r\n  act, codified as section 38-77-350, establishing requirements for forms\r\n  offering UIM coverage.Â  See Automobile Insurance Reform Act of 1989, Â§\r\n  22.Â  Section 38-77-350(A) mandates the director of the Department of Insurance\r\n  or his designee to approve a form, which at a minimum, must provide: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1)\r\n\t\t\tA\r\n  brief and concise explanation of the coverage; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2)\r\n\t\t\tA\r\n  list of all available limits and the range of premiums for the limits; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3) \r\n\t\t\tA\r\n  space for the insured to mark whether the insured chooses to accept or reject\r\n  the coverage and a space for the insured to select the limits of coverage he\r\n  desires; \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(4)\r\n\t\t\tA\r\n  space for the insured to sign the form which acknowledges that he has been\r\n  offered the optional coverages; and \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(5)\r\n\t\t\tThe\r\n  mailing address and telephone number of the Insurance Department which the\r\n  applicant may contact if the applicant has any questions that the insurance\r\n  agent is unable to answer.[1]Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThis form must be used by insurers in offering optional\r\n  coverages.Â  See id.Â Â  It is\r\n  important to note &quot;[f]ailure to comply with section 38-77-350(A) does not\r\n  automatically require judicial reformation of a policy. Rather, even where an\r\n  insurer is not entitled to the presumption [in section 37-77-350(B)] that it\r\n  made a meaningful offer, it may prove the sufficiency of its offer by showing\r\n  that it complied with Wannamaker.&quot; See Grinnell Corp.,\r\n  389 S.C. at 357, 698 S.E.2d at 799-800 (citing Croft v. Old Republic Ins.\r\n    Co., 365 S.C. 402, 420, 618 S.E.2d 909, 918 (2005)).\r\nUSAA's\r\n  form contains a brief and concise explanation of UIM coverage on the first\r\n  page, detailing in one paragraph what UIM coverage pays for, who gets compensated,\r\n  and what &quot;underinsured motor vehicle&quot; means.Â Â  The form contains\r\n  every UIM limit which USAA was approved to sell by the Department of Insurance,\r\n  along with specific language on how to decrease or increase UIM coverage.Â \r\n  There was a space for Wiegand to mark whether he chose to accept or reject\r\n  coverage, select the limits of coverage he desired, and sign the form\r\n  acknowledging he had been offered optional coverage.Â  Finally, the form\r\n  contained the mailing address and telephone number of the Department of\r\n  Insurance.Â Â Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  USAA's form was approved by the appropriate entity in Janaury 1990.Â  While\r\n  approval alone is not dispositive of whether a form meets section\r\n  38-77-350(A)'s requirements, see Progressive Casualty Insurance Co. v.\r\n    Leachman, 362 S.C. 344, 608 S.E.2d 569 (2005), we believe it lends\r\n  support to the view that USAA satisfied the requirements.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  conclude that USAA met section 38-77-350(A)'s requirements and now turn to whether\r\n  USAA can take advantage of the presumption in section 38-77-350(B). Â \r\nSection\r\n  38-77-350(B) provides a conclusive presumption of informed selection in favor\r\n  of the insurer if specific criteria are met once the form is found to be in\r\n  compliance with (A).Â  Wiegand signed the form in 1990.Â  Because of the\r\n  presumption against retroactivity of statutes, our analysis will only deal with\r\n  the section as it existed in 1990.[2]Â \r\n  In that version of the statute, the insured must have properly completed and\r\n  executed the form.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (1990).Â  The insurer has the burden of establishing that the\r\n  requirements have been met in order to take advantage of the presumption.Â  See\r\n    Floyd v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 253, 262-63, 626 S.E.2d 6, 12\r\n  (2005).Â Â  \r\nContrary\r\n  to the circuit judge's finding, USAA presented sufficient evidence to show that\r\n  Wiegand both completed and executed the form.Â  The offer form was processed by\r\n  USAA and never returned to Wiegand to complete, which it would have been if the\r\n  form was not completed correctly.Â  Wiegand signed the bottom of the form\r\n  indicating whether he wished to purchase coverage and signed his name under the\r\n  check marks, which were similar to check marks made by Wiegand on similar\r\n  forms.Â  Wiegand was insured by USAA from 1990 to 2005 with annual reports sent\r\n  from USAA that stated no UIM coverage was applicable to his vehicles; Wiegand never\r\n  informed USAA that a mistake had been made and he actually wanted UIM coverage.\r\n  Â Â \r\nWife\r\n  argues that USAA cannot meet its burden because no one can testify who checked\r\n  the &quot;no&quot; boxes on the form signed by Wiegand.Â  While this is true,\r\n  nothing in the statutes, rules, or case law requires direct evidence as to who\r\n  checked the boxes for the burden to be met.Â  It is enough that Wiegand signed\r\n  the acknowledgment which included the sentence &quot;I have indicated whether\r\n  or not I wish to purchase each coverage in the space provided&quot; along with\r\n  the other evidence mentioned above to find that USAA met its burden.Â  We hold\r\n  USAA can take advantage of the presumption found in section 38-77-350(B), and that\r\n  a meaningful offer was made to Wiegand.Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  we find the matter dispositive on the issue of meaningful offer under the\r\n  statute, we decline to address the remaining issues on appeal.Â  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999). Â Therefore, we reverse the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\n  in favor of Wife and remand the case to the circuit court to enter judgment in\r\n  accordance with this opinion. \r\nREVERSED.\r\nACTING CHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justices James E. Moore and J. Ernest\r\n  Kinard, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The\r\n  version of section 38-77-350(A) in effect at the time of USAA's offer to\r\n  Vincent contained the same language, except that &quot;Chief Insurance\r\n  Commissioner&quot; was listed instead of &quot;the director of the Department\r\n  of Insurance or his designee.&quot;Â  \r\n[2] In 2006, the statute was amended so that the\r\n  presumption applies if the form was completed by an insurance producer or\r\n  representative of the insurer and the insured only signed the form.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 38-77-350(B) (Supp.\r\n  2009).Â  At oral argument, Wife conceded that under this version of the statute,\r\n  USAA would be entitled to the presumption. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26920","title":"Gowdy v.

File, of Spartanburg, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In\r\n  this case, we granted a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals'\r\n  holding that the State established probable cause that a substantial connection\r\n  existed between $146,050, confiscated from Petitioners' home, and illegal drug\r\n  activity because the money was traceable to illegal transactions, as required\r\n  by section 44-53-520(a)(7) of the South Carolina Code.Â  We agree with the court\r\n  of appeals, and therefore, affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThis\r\n  civil forfeiture action was initiated by Solicitor Trey Gowdy (the State) to\r\n  confirm the seizure and forfeiture of $146,050 in cash that was found in a safe\r\n  in the home of Bobby Gibson, Jr. (Bobby Gibson) and his mother Lillie Gibson (Ms.\r\n  Gibson) (together, Petitioners).\r\nIn\r\n  September 2004, Spartanburg County police obtained a warrant to search the home\r\n  of Bobby Gibson based on suspicions raised from an ongoing investigation of his\r\n  drug activity and earlier arrest for possession of crack cocaine.Â  At the home,\r\n  which Bobby Gibson shared with his mother, police found a small fire safe in\r\n  the attic.Â  This safe could only be accessed through a hole cut in the ceiling\r\n  of Bobby Gibson's bedroom.Â  After a narcotics canine sniffed the safe and\r\n  alerted, officers forcibly opened the safe and found $146,050 in cash,\r\n  organized in rubber-banded stacks, and a small metal box containing an unknown\r\n  amount of currency and old coins.Â  Ms. Gibson, who arrived shortly after the\r\n  officers opened the safe, said she did not know the combination to the safe and\r\n  did not make a claim to the money when officers informed her they would be\r\n  confiscating it.Â  Officers left the small metal box with Ms. Gibson. \r\nApproximately\r\n  140 feet from the location of the safe, officers found a set of digital scales,\r\n  a plastic medicine bottle containing 24.4 grams of crack cocaine, and a plastic\r\n  bag containing 11.7 grams of marijuana.Â  These items were concealed beneath a\r\n  stack of bricks found behind a detached garage in the back yard of the\r\n  residence.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, police obtained a warrant to search a building Bobby Gibson was\r\n  remodeling, located several blocks away from his residence.Â  There police found\r\n  a plastic bag containing 713 grams of cocaine, also hidden in the ceiling.\r\nIn\r\n  bringing this action, the State sought to confirm the propriety of the\r\n  forfeiture, arguing it was Bobby Gibson's property and it was subject to\r\n  forfeiture under section 44-53-520(a) of the South Carolina Code.Â  In Bobby Gibson's\r\n  March 2005 Answer to Respondent's Complaint, he admitted that he had an\r\n  interest in the property.Â  Prior to the December 2006 hearing, however, Ms.\r\n  Gibson was added as a party, claiming that she, rather than her son, owned the\r\n  property.Â  \r\nAfter\r\n  a bench trial, the circuit court found that the State established probable\r\n  cause for the forfeiture because the money was found in close proximity to the\r\n  evidence of illegal drug activity, and because the money was traceable to\r\n  illegal transactions based on the facts presented in the case.Â  Additionally, the\r\n  court found that Petitioners failed to establish by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the money belonged to Ms. Gibson.Â  Having heard the testimony,\r\n  the circuit court found that the Petitioners' position lacked credibility. The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed.Â  \r\nISSUES\r\nPetitioners\r\n  present the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n     I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err by\r\n  not ruling on the issue of close proximity, as provided in section\r\n  44-53-520(a)(8) of the South Carolina Code?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  finding there was probable cause to support civil forfeiture because the money\r\n  was traceable to an illegal transaction?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the court of appeals err in\r\n  holding that Petitioners failed to establish their claim to the currency by a\r\n  preponderance of the evidence?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n&quot;An\r\n  action for forfeiture of property is a civil action at law.&quot;Â  Pope v.\r\n    Gordon, 369 S.C. 469, 474, 633 S.E.2d 148, 151 (2006). Â Â Â When an action at\r\n  law is tried without a jury, the standard of review extends only to the\r\n  correction of errors of law.Â  Id.Â  The circuit judge's findings of fact\r\n  will only be disturbed on appeal if the findings are wholly unsupported by the\r\n  evidence or controlled by an erroneous application of the law.Â  Id.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n&quot;The\r\n  purpose of a forfeiture hearing is to confirm that the state had probable cause\r\n  to seize the property forfeited.&quot;Â  Pope v. Gordon, 369 S.C. 469,\r\n  474, 633 S.E.2d 148, 151 (2006) (citing Medlock v. One 1985 Jeep Cherokee\r\n    VIN 1JCWB7828FT129001, 322 S.C. 127, 131, 470 S.E.2d 373, 376 (1996) (validating\r\n  the statutory standard for seizing property under section 44-53-520 is probable\r\n  cause)).Â  The initial burden lies with the state to show it had probable cause\r\n  for believing a substantial connection exists between the property to be\r\n  forfeited and the criminal activity.Â  Id.Â  Once probable cause is shown,\r\n  the burden shifts to the property owner to show by a preponderance of the\r\n  evidence that the property was innocently owned.Â  Medlock, 322 S.C. at\r\n  131, 470 S.E.2d at 376 (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-586(b) (Supp.\r\n  1994)).\r\nSection\r\n  44-53-520(a) enumerates eight instances when property is subject to\r\n  forfeiture.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-520(a)(1)-(8) (2002 &amp; Supp. 2007).Â  Of\r\n  these, only subsections (7) and (8) are at issue: \r\n\r\n  (7) all property including, but not limited to, monies, negotiable\r\n    instruments, securities, or other things of value furnished or intended to be\r\n    furnished by any person in exchange for a controlled substance, and all\r\n    proceeds including, but not limited to, monies, and real and personal property traceable to any exchange; \r\n  (8) all monies seized in close\r\n    proximity to forfeitable controlled substances, drug manufacturing, or\r\n    distributing paraphernalia, or in close proximity to forfeitable records of the\r\n    importation, manufacturing, or distribution of controlled substances and all\r\n    monies seized at the time of arrest or search involving violation of this\r\n    article. If the person from whom the monies were taken can establish to the\r\n    satisfaction of a court of competent jurisdiction that the monies seized are\r\n    not products of illegal acts, the monies must be returned pursuant to court\r\n    order. \r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nThus, a showing that\r\n  the property to be forfeited was in close proximity to illegal drugs, or that\r\n  there was probable cause to believe the property was traceable to illegal\r\n  drugs, will satisfy the state's burden of proof.\r\nI. The Issue of Close\r\n  Proximity, as Provided in SectionÂ Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n  44-53-520(a)(8) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue the court of appeals erred by not definitively ruling on whether the\r\n  currency in question was closely proximate to the illegal drugs and\r\n  distributing paraphernalia found on the property.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  section of 44-53-520(a) of the South Carolina Code, the State must show that\r\n  the property seized fits the description of one of the types of properties listed\r\n  in subsections (1) through (8).Â  Because the court of appeals affirmed the\r\n  circuit court's holding that the money was traceable under subsection (7), it\r\n  was unnecessary for the court of appeals to rule on whether the property was closely\r\n  proximate under subsection (8).Â  However, we defer to the circuit court's\r\n  finding that the money seized was in close proximity to the contraband, as\r\n  explained herein. \r\nPetitioners\r\n  submit that the drugs and money were not closely proximate because they were found\r\n  approximately 140 feet apart, and not in the same building.Â  South Carolina\r\n  courts have not specifically addressed how close proximity should be measured.Â \r\n  However, other states with forfeiture statutes that contain close proximity\r\n  provisions have found that close proximity should not be defined in terms of\r\n  measurement, but rather, on a case by case basis. See City of Meridian v.\r\n    Hodge, 632 So. 2d 1309, 1312 (Miss. 1994) (declining to set rigid rules to\r\n  fix close proximity, such as a particular number of feet, or a particular room); see also Limon v. State, 685 S.W.2d 515, 516 (Ak. 1985) (finding\r\n  &quot;close proximity&quot; means &quot;very near&quot; and should therefore be\r\n  determined on a case by case basis).Â  \r\nWe,\r\n  too, believe that close proximity, as provided in section 44-53-520(a)(8),\r\n  should be decided on a case by case basis.Â  We additionally note that by\r\n  enumerating instances where property is subject to forfeiture, the General\r\n  Assembly intended to limit the state's forfeiture power to clear situations where\r\n  property was illegally obtained.Â  We do not believe the General Assembly wished\r\n  to encourage drug traffickers to strategically house their cash stores so as to\r\n  evade seizure by the government.Â  Establishing a bright line proximity measure\r\n  would do just that.\r\nBearing\r\n  in mind that the circuit judge's finding of close proximity is a question of\r\n  fact, we will not disturb this finding on appeal unless it is wholly\r\n  unsupported by the evidence.Â  In making its proximity finding, the circuit\r\n  court took into account: (1) the drugs and money were housed on the same\r\n  property, and (2) that property was under the control of Bobby Gibson.Â  We are not\r\n  prepared to say that, as a matter of law, money is forfeitable simply because\r\n  it is found on the same property as contraband, or because it is found on\r\n  property that is controlled by the criminal defendant.Â  However, we are\r\n  deferential to the circuit court's finding of facts in this case. \r\nTherefore,\r\n  we find that the circuit court's determination that the drugs and the money\r\n  were closely proximate was supported by the evidence, and our standard of\r\n  review precludes us from disturbing that finding. \r\n II. The Issue of Traceability,\r\n  as Provided in Section 44-53-520(a)(7) of \r\n  the South Carolina Code\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue that the court of appeals applied a totality of the circumstances test\r\n  when determining whether the forfeiture complied with the traceability\r\n  requirement of section 44-53-320(a)(7), and that it erred in doing so.Â  More\r\n  specifically, Petitioners argue the court of appeals placed too much emphasis\r\n  on the drug dog alert to find the money was traceable to illegal drug\r\n  activity.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nIn Pope\r\n  v. Gordon, we addressed the standard to be applied to section\r\n  44-53-520(a)(7).Â  369 S.C. 469, 633 S.E.2d 148 (2006).Â  In that case, the\r\n  police seized the bank accounts of Gordonâ€™s carwash business, pursuant to a\r\n  conviction for trafficking in crack cocaine. Â Id. at 473, 633 S.E.2d at\r\n  150.Â  To draw the connection between the money seized and illegal transactions,\r\n  the state presented evidence that Gordon paid for his monthly rent in cash, he\r\n  failed to pay taxes for his business for the period in question, and that the\r\n  portion of expenses that exceeded his business income was paid for in cash.Â  Id. at 475, 633 S.E.2d at 152.Â  In essence, Gordonâ€™s tendency to transact in cash\r\n  was the stateâ€™s primary argument that the money in the bank account was\r\n  illegally gained.Â  This Court affirmed the court of appeals' holding that the\r\n  state failed to show probable cause that the money in the bank accounts was\r\n  traceable to illegal drug transactions.Â  Id. at 476, 633 S.E.2d at 152.Â  \r\nIn that\r\n  case, the State urged this Court to follow the rationale used in United\r\n    States v. Thomas, where the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth\r\n  Circuit affirmed the governmentâ€™s seizure of property based on a totality of\r\n  circumstances.Â  913 F.2d 1111 (4th Cir. 1990).Â  In Thomas, the Fourth\r\n  Circuit found that &quot;the possession of unusually large amounts of\r\n  cash&quot; was significant, and &quot;may be circumstantial evidence of drug\r\n  trafficking.&quot; Â Id. at 1115.Â  The court further relied on the fact\r\n  that the defendant's cash expenditures vastly exceeded his legitimate income,\r\n  he made numerous one way trips to Miami, and that he had a history of convictions\r\n  for possession of drugs.Â  Id. at 1115-16. Â This Court declined to use\r\n  the Thomas rationale, finding that a totality of the circumstances\r\n  analysis lessened the burden on the state to prove a nexus, and that it was in\r\n  direct contravention to the traceable language used in the statute. Â Gordon,\r\n  369 S.C. at 152, 633 S.E.2d at 476.\r\nIn Thomas,\r\n  the Fourth Circuit held that probable cause in the context of forfeiture cases\r\n  is the same standard employed in search and seizure cases. Â Thomas, 913\r\n  F.2d at 1114.Â  This requires the court to &quot;'make a practical, common-sense\r\n  decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth . . . there is a fair\r\n  probability' that the properties to be forfeited are proceeds of illegal drug\r\n  transactions.&quot;Â  Id. (quoting Illinois v. Gates, 462\r\n  U.S. 213 (1983)).Â  We agree there is a parallel between government seizure\r\n  under the Fourth Amendment and government seizure in civil forfeiture cases.Â \r\n  Therefore, in evaluating traceability, a court may weigh the evidence presented\r\n  to draw its conclusion.Â  What a court may not do, and what the State urged this\r\n  Court to do in Gordon, is draw inferences based on evidence that is\r\n  unrelated to the property being seized.Â  Notably, in Gordon, this Court\r\n  did not construe traceability so narrow as to require bills be marked or serial\r\n  numbers be recorded. Â Neither did this Court require the State prove to an\r\n  absolute certainty that the money in the bank account was a product of illegal\r\n  drug transactions.Â  Rather, in that case, this Court sought to prevent the State\r\n  from confiscating legitimately owned property by presenting evidence that was\r\n  unrelated to the property being seized.Â  Our hesitancy in using a totality of\r\n  the circumstances test for determining traceability derives from a concern that\r\n  unrelated circumstantial evidence will become a substitute for real evidence\r\n  that money or goods are products of illegal activity.\r\nThe\r\n  concern that was present in Gordon is not present here.Â  In this case, the\r\n  court of appeals found that the probabilities, to the exclusion of all else, pointed\r\n  to the conclusion that the money found in the safe was illegally gained.Â  The\r\n  courts below saw it significant that a large sum of cash was found hidden in a\r\n  convicted drug dealer's bedroom, under his sole control, bundled in a way that\r\n  is typical for drug transactions, and in close proximity to drug\r\n  paraphernalia.Â  The inferences made in Gordon need not be made here.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we disagree with Petitioners' contention that a drug dog's alert should bear no\r\n  weight when evaluating traceability.Â  Although many courts have questioned the\r\n  probative value of dog alerts due to contamination of the nation's paper\r\n  currency with drug residue, these courts have not completely disregarded it as\r\n  a form of evidence. See United States v. $78,850.00 in U.S. Currency,\r\n  517 F.Supp. 2d 792, 797 (D.S.C. 2007) (declining to take a position on the\r\n  probative value of a positive alert, but stating that, based on the alert,\r\n  &quot;it is more likely than not that the $433,890 was substantially related to\r\n  a drug offense&quot;); United States v. Funds in the Amount of $30,670,\r\n  403 F.3d 448 (7th Cir. 2005) (considering expert testimony that &quot;'scientific\r\n  results indicate that circulated currency, innocently contaminated with\r\n  [microgram] quantities of cocaine would not cause a properly trained detection\r\n  canine to signal an alert even if very large numbers of bills are present'&quot;); United States v. $22,474.00 in U.S. Currency, 246 F.3d 1212, 1217 (9th\r\n  Cir. 2001) (stating a &quot;sophisticated dog sniff&quot; and &quot;other\r\n  factors&quot; can &quot;tip the scales in favor of establishing probable\r\n  cause&quot;). But see United States v. One Lot of U.S. Currency ($36,634),\r\n  103 F.3d 1048, 1056 (1st Cir. 1997) (finding that a dog reaction &quot;weighs\r\n  some, but not a great deal, on the scale&quot;). \r\nWhile\r\n  the drug dogâ€™s alert on the safe, standing alone, would not have proved the\r\n  presence of drugs, the positive canine alert was a factor that the court of\r\n  appeals rightly determined to be significant.Â  Further, we note it is\r\n  significant that the canine alerted on the safe and not the money.Â  This fact\r\n  alone distinguishes the case at hand from the cases cited above, and renders\r\n  Petitioners' contamination theory questionable.\r\nThus,\r\n  in our opinion, the State established there was probable cause to believe a\r\n  substantial connection existed between the money contained in the safe and\r\n  illegal drug activity, both because the money was found in close proximity to\r\n  illegal drugs, and because the money was traceable to illegal transactions.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the court of appeals did not err.\r\nIII. Innocent Ownership\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue that in the event the State shows probable cause for seizing the money, Petitioners\r\n  proved by a preponderance of the evidence that the money was innocently owned\r\n  by Ms. Gibson.Â  We disagree.\r\nMs.\r\n  Gibson contends that this money is a product of both her life savings and the\r\n  proceeds from illegal gambling.Â  Petitioners only offered the testimony of Ms.\r\n  Gibson and Bobby Gibson to support this contention.Â  Ms. Gibson stated she\r\n  worked for the same company for twenty-seven years making $14.33 per hour.Â  She\r\n  testified that she sometimes worked sixty hour weeks, her house and car were\r\n  paid in full, and her monthly bills and expenses were minimal.Â  She insisted\r\n  that she did not put this money in a bank because she lost money there in the\r\n  past. \r\nDiscrediting\r\n  her claim, Ms. Gibson did not know the combination to the safe, admitted that\r\n  she could not reach the safe, and stated she always gave the money to her son\r\n  to put in the safe.Â  She then admitted that her son had been in prison for\r\n  several years and had just recently been released.Â  Ms. Gibson did not have tax\r\n  returns or any other documents to support her claim of income.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  officers at the scene testified that Ms. Gibson looked surprised when she saw\r\n  the money they were retrieving from the safe.Â  When the officers told Ms.\r\n  Gibson they would be confiscating the money, she did not make any claim to the\r\n  money. Â Instead, the court did not hear of her claim to the money until she was\r\n  added as a party shortly before the commencement of the trial.Â  Taking Ms.\r\n  Gibsonâ€™s claim out of the equation, Petitioners offered no evidence that Bobby Gibson\r\n  had an alternate income source that would support this accumulation of cash.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  circuit judge, after hearing the testimony and considering the above facts,\r\n  concluded that Ms. Gibson's position in the matter is likely &quot;fabricated\r\n  rather than true.&quot;Â  He additionally found that the &quot;officers appeared\r\n  credible to the Court at trial.&quot;Â Â  This Court recognizes that the circuit\r\n  judge &quot;heard the witnesses, [and] is in a better position to evaluate\r\n  their credibility and assign comparative weight to their testimony.&quot; Reed\r\n    v. Ozmint, 374 S.C. 19, 24, 647 S.E.2d 209, 211 (2007).Â  We will not\r\n  disturb the circuit judge's finding that Petitioners' failed to meet their\r\n  preponderance of the evidence burden, as this finding of fact was supported by\r\n  a bounty of evidence.Â  \r\nTherefore,\r\n  the court of appeals did not err in affirming the circuit court's finding that\r\n  Petitioners failed to prove the money was innocently owned.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  reasons, it is our view that the State established probable cause that a\r\n  substantial connection existed between the money confiscated from the safe and\r\n  illegal activity because the money was both closely proximate and traceable to\r\n  illegal drugs.Â  Further, we agree that Petitioners did not meet their burden\r\n  for proving that the money was innocently owned.Â  Therefore, we affirm.\r\nBEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.
