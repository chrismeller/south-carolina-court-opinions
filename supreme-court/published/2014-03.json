Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Sabrina\r\n            C. Todd, Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of\r\n            Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n            Harvey MacLure Watson, III, of Ballard Watson\r\n            Weissenstein, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment with conditions as set forth hereafter. He requests the disbarment be\r\nmade retroactive to March 15, 2013, the date of his interim suspension. In the\r\nMatter of Williams, 403 S.C. 362, 743 S.E.2d 733 (2013). We accept the\r\nAgreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state. We deny\r\nrespondent's request to impose the disbarment retroactively to the date of his\r\ninterim suspension. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                     Matter I\r\n\r\nRespondent drafted a will for Client A. When the will was executed, Client A was\r\nin the hospital and unable to speak or sign his name. Respondent named himself as\r\npersonal representative in the will, entitling him to receive a 5% statutory\r\ncommission. Respondent served as both a witness and the notary to the execution\r\nof the will.\r\n\r\nAlthough respondent engaged in a business transaction with Client A by drafting\r\nthe will and naming himself personal representative, respondent did not explain to\r\nClient A in writing that he would collect a fee or commission for serving as the\r\npersonal representative, did not tell Client A in writing of the advisability of\r\nseeking independent legal counsel, and did not provide Client A with a reasonable\r\nopportunity to seek independent legal counsel.\r\n\r\nClient A died shortly after the execution of the will and, in accordance with the\r\nwill, respondent was appointed as the estate's personal representative. The will\r\nprovided that a named church (Church) was to receive $100,000 and that four\r\nmembers of a family (Beneficiaries) were to share equally in the residuary of the\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nThe estate had $1,253,960.86 in liquid assets. Respondent placed the bulk of the\r\nestate's funds into a dedicated trust account and, except for paying himself\r\n$26,000, his handling of the funds in that account is not at issue. However, his\r\nhandling of the first $300,000 he received in estate funds was largely improper.\r\n\r\nIn August of 2010, respondent deposited the $300,000 into a trust account he had\r\nwith Branch Bank and Trust (BB&T). Before the deposit, the account balance was\r\n$821.90; respondent did not provide records to ODC sufficient to identify the\r\nowner(s) of this money. After the $300,000 deposit and before making any further\r\ndeposits, respondent issued: 1) 73 checks to himself and one check made payable\r\nto cash, totaling $227,073.50; 2) a $4,448.00 check to his relative; 3) two checks\r\ntotaling $10,119.19 to an individual in connection with an unrelated estate; 4) a\r\n$5,630.40 check to a bank for reasons not related to the Estate of Client A; 5) two\r\nchecks totaling $15,000.00 to an individual for reasons unrelated to the Estate of\r\n\nClient A; 6) a $500.00 check to a beneficiary of the Estate of Client D;1 7) two\r\nchecks totaling $5,663.49 to John Doe, one of the residuary devisees of the Estate\r\nof Client D; and 8) a $325.00 check for an expense of the Estate of Client B.2\r\n\r\nRespondent also disbursed $32,444.96 for legitimate expenses of the Estate of\r\nClient A from the trust account. By the end of January 2012, the balance in the\r\nBB&T trust account fell to $16,499.04.\r\n\r\nOn February 1, 2012, respondent deposited $126,493.30 belonging to the Estate of\r\nClient B into the BB&T trust account. This was the first deposit since the\r\n$300,000 deposit belonging to the Estate of Client A. Respondent continued to\r\nmake improper payments, most to himself, without regard to proper handling or\r\naccounting of the funds of either estate.\r\n\r\nDuring the investigation of this matter, respondent attempted to justify his removal\r\nof funds belonging to the Estate of Client A by claiming that one or more of the\r\nBeneficiaries had agreed to pay him a legal fee of 15% of the liquid assets of the\r\nestate. Respondent had no such fee agreement. In fact, after he had proposed this\r\nfee to the Beneficiaries, the Beneficiaries complained to the probate court and\r\nhired counsel. A 15% fee would have been approximately $188,000, an\r\nunreasonable amount in light of the factors in Rule 1.5, Rule 407, RPC, and far less\r\nthan the sum respondent had already removed from the estate.\r\n\r\nBecause of respondent's failure to make disbursements and close the estate, the\r\nprobate court held a hearing on October 19, 2012. At the hearing, the probate\r\ncourt addressed respondent's proposed 15% fee and respondent agreed to accept\r\nthe 5% statutory commission as his total compensation for his work on the estate.\r\nAt the hearing, the Beneficiaries' attorney demanded a full accounting of all estate\r\nfunds and respondent agreed to file an interim accounting.\r\n\r\nOn October 24, 2012, respondent filed two interim accountings with the probate\r\ncourt, one for each of the bank accounts. The interim accounting for the dedicated\r\ntrust account correctly reflected disbursements to date, including the $26,000 paid\r\nto respondent in legal fees. The interim accounting for the funds in the BB&T\r\ntrust account, however, was largely inaccurate and misleading. Respondent\r\ncorrectly reported the estate funds deposited into the account and the legitimate\r\n\r\n1   See Matter IV.\r\n\r\n    See Matter II.\r\n2\r\n\nexpense paid from the account, but did not report any of the disbursements he\r\nmade to himself from the account. Moreover, respondent falsely reported that he\r\nheld $267,555.04 in the BB&T trust account for the estate when the true balance\r\nwas $50,394.86, the majority of which belonged to the Estate of Client B.\r\nRespondent did not provide an accounting of all disbursements as demanded by the\r\nBeneficiaries' attorney.\r\n\r\nAs a result of his interim accounting and proposed distribution, the probate court\r\ndirected respondent to make disbursements to the devisees. Respondent was\r\nspecifically ordered to pay Church the $100,000 it was due within two business\r\ndays. Because of his improper removal of funds from the account, however, there\r\nwas not enough money to make the full distributions under his proposal.\r\n\r\nAfter considerable delay and a deposit into his BB&T trust account of funds\r\nbelonging to another client,3 respondent paid three of the Beneficiaries but made\r\nno payment to Church and shorted one of the Beneficiaries $125,478.12.\r\nRespondent sent the partial payment to this beneficiary with a letter of apology\r\nseeking the beneficiary's \"confidentiality\" and \"mercy.\"\r\n\r\nThereafter, the probate court removed respondent for failure to obey court orders.\r\nBoth the probate court and the Beneficiaries' attorney filed complaints against\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\nODC subpoenaed respondent's file for the Estate of Client A and the records for\r\nrespondent's trust accounts since the date of Client A's death. In response to the\r\nsubpoena, respondent produced bank statements for his BB&T trust account; he\r\ndid not produce receipt and disbursement journals, client ledgers, or reconciliation\r\nreports for that account and produced no records for his real estate trust account.\r\nRespondent did not produce his file for the Estate of Client A.\r\n\r\nDuring an interview with ODC, respondent falsely testified that the two deposits\r\nmade into his trust account after the $300,000 deposit for the Estate of Client A\r\nwere earned legal fees for the Estate of Client B and another client C rather than\r\nassets of the two clients. During the interview, respondent testified the account\r\ncontained $95,000, almost enough to pay Church, and contended he had protected\r\nthe funds due Church despite clear evidence that most, if not all, of the $95,000\r\ncame from the two intervening deposits. Respondent also admitted it was common\r\npractice for him to serve as both attorney and personal representative for estates\r\n\r\n    See Matter III.\r\n3\r\n\nand his standard fee for his work on such estates was 15% of the estate's liquid\r\nassets.\r\n\r\nFollowing the interview, respondent paid Church $90,000 from his trust account,\r\n$10,000 less than Church was to receive under the will but far more than the funds\r\non deposit for the Estate of Client A. Respondent also provided ODC with copies\r\nof bank statements for his real estate trust account, but did not provide any other\r\nrecords for the account despite having testified during the interview that he\r\nmaintained proper records for the account.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter II\r\n\r\nIn September of 2006, respondent drafted a will, power of attorney, and health care\r\npower of attorney for Client B. At the time, Client B was in a nursing home and\r\nrespondent named himself Client B's attorney-in-fact as well as personal\r\nrepresentative of Client B's estate. The handling of Client B's finances between\r\nSeptember 2006 and Client B's death in 2011 have been questioned, but records are\r\nunavailable and respondent has no records of any accountings to Client B.\r\n\r\nAfter Client B's death, respondent was entrusted with $126,493.30 belonging to the\r\nestate. Respondent placed these funds into his trust account. Although he paid\r\nsome legitimate estate expenses from these funds, he used the majority of the funds\r\nfor his own purposes. Respondent later received $2,000 in estate funds that he did\r\nnot deposit into his trust account, use for estate expenses, or preserve for the\r\nestate's beneficiaries.\r\n\r\nClient B's will provided a $100 gift to each of his five children with the remainder\r\nof his estate to be shared equally by his grandchildren. Respondent made no\r\ndistributions to Client B's children or grandchildren. The probate court requested\r\nan accounting and proof of payment to the beneficiaries, but respondent produced\r\nneither.\r\n\r\nUnaware of respondent's failure to safeguard the estate's funds, Client B's daughter\r\nfiled a complaint alleging respondent had not worked diligently on her father's\r\nestate and had not communicated well with the beneficiaries. Respondent failed to\r\nreport Client B's ownership of a small amount of stock and a parcel of real estate\r\non the inventory and appraisement, failed to pay taxes on the property, and did not\r\nredeem the property until five months after it was sold at a tax sale. He also failed\r\nto timely close an unneeded storage unit, causing the estate to incur additional\r\nexpenses.\r\n\n                                     Matter III\r\n\r\nIn November of 2012, Client C, the personal representative of an estate, entrusted\r\nrespondent with $82,488.29 of estate funds which respondent placed into his\r\nBB&T trust account. Although respondent paid some legitimate expenses of the\r\nestate with these funds, the majority of the funds were disbursed improperly.\r\nRespondent also received rent money on behalf of the estate which he did not place\r\ninto any account or otherwise safeguard and for which he cannot account.\r\nRespondent owes the estate $77,451.02.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter IV\r\n\r\nRespondent drafted a will for Client D and named himself as the successor\r\npersonal representative. In addition to specific gifts of real and personal property,\r\nthe will provided for a $1,000 devise and four devises of $500 each. Client D left\r\nthe residuary of his estate to two relatives, John Doe and Jane Doe.\r\n\r\nUpon Client D's death, respondent was appointed personal representative.\r\nRespondent deposited $9,563.86 into the account he opened for the estate. He paid\r\n$285 in legitimate estate expenses from the estate account, but did not pay any of\r\nthe devisees from this account or the sole approved estate creditor from the\r\naccount. Instead, respondent used the remainder of the money for his own\r\npurposes, writing himself checks and receiving the balance in the account when the\r\naccount closed.\r\n\r\nRespondent paid residuary beneficiary John Doe $5,663.49 and one beneficiary\r\n$500, but made these payments from his BB&T trust account which held no funds\r\nfor this estate. Respondent failed to distribute four of the five bequests as\r\ninstructed in the will.\r\n\r\nAlthough respondent did not pay the four bequests, he told the probate court in a\r\nletter that he was trying to obtain receipts and releases from three of the\r\nbeneficiaries. He provided the probate court with a receipt and release from the\r\nfourth beneficiary, a community center. The court rejected this receipt and release\r\nbecause it indicated the community center had received a donation from Client D\r\nprior to his death rather than a cash bequest under the will. Further, when he\r\napplied to settle the estate, respondent indicated he had only paid himself $500\r\nfrom the estate's funds. He also incorrectly reported to the probate court the sum\r\n\nhe had paid to John Doe. In addition to the devisees who received no funds,\r\nrespondent owes John and Jane Doe an additional $115.37.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter V\r\n\r\nOn March 15, 2013, respondent was placed on interim suspension by this Court\r\nand Stephen G. Potts, Esquire, was appointed as Attorney to Protect Clients'\r\nInterests. Id. On the day of his interim suspension, respondent received a\r\ntelephone call from the office of the Clerk of this Court advising of his suspension\r\nand instructing him to cease practicing law.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this notice and instruction, for approximately two weeks thereafter,\r\nrespondent answered and returned telephone calls from his law office telephone\r\nand kept or attempted to keep existing appointments with active clients.\r\nRespondent acknowledges his action was improper because he did not clearly\r\ncommunicate his suspended status to callers and clients and attempted to continue\r\nto provide legal counsel instead of restricting communication to historical\r\ninformation for the purpose of assisting clients in finding successor counsel.\r\n\r\nAfter his interim suspension, respondent met with one client and presented the\r\nclient with a document instructing an insurance company how to disburse the\r\nclient's large settlement. Respondent had backdated the document to the date of\r\nhis interim suspension and, after the client executed the document, offered to mail\r\nit for the client. Respondent attempted to negotiate a higher fee with the client\r\nduring the meeting and, after the meeting, confirmed he had mailed the document.\r\n\r\nRespondent also accepted paperwork and an earnest money check for a residential\r\nreal estate closing from a realtor. When Mr. Potts emailed respondent and asked\r\nabout the closing, respondent returned the papers and check to the realtor rather\r\nthan surrendering them to Mr. Potts.\r\n\r\nRespondent did not fully cooperate with Mr. Potts. Among other responsibilities,\r\nMr. Potts was charged with taking control of respondent's trust and other office\r\naccounts and disbursing the files to active clients. Respondent did not surrender all\r\nof his active files to Mr. Potts in a timely fashion, choosing to hold onto problem\r\nfiles or place them with inactive files. Although he did provide some financial\r\nrecords to Mr. Potts, he did not initially surrender all of his records.\r\n\r\nNearly three months after he was placed on interim suspension, respondent\r\nappeared at the drive-thru window of Community First Bank where he maintained\r\n\nseveral firm accounts and personal accounts. Respondent asked the teller to\r\ntransfer funds from one of his law firm accounts to a personal account. Before he\r\nidentified the firm account or provided the amount he wished to transfer, the teller\r\nadvised he could not make any transactions out of the law firm accounts without\r\nMr. Potts' authorization. Respondent told the teller he was keeping Mr. Potts\r\ninformed of all of his activities, but acquiesced to the teller's refusal. He then\r\npresented the teller with a deposit slip for a personal account and a $350 check\r\nmade payable to himself. Only later did the bank staff realize the $350 check was\r\ndrawn on respondent's trust account with First Citizens Bank. After learning that\r\nFirst Citizens would not honor the check, bank staff called respondent and told him\r\nthe deposit would not be honored. Respondent had not notified Mr. Potts or ODC\r\nof the existence of the First Citizens trust account and had not surrendered the\r\nchecks, bank statements, or other records to Mr. Potts.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.5 (lawyer shall not\r\ncharge or collect unreasonable fee); Rule 1.8(a) (lawyer shall not enter into a\r\nbusiness transaction with client unless specified safeguards are followed); Rule\r\n1.15 (lawyer shall safeguard funds of clients and third parties); Rule 3.3 (lawyer\r\nshall not make false statement of material fact to tribunal); Rule 3.4(a) (lawyer\r\nshall not obstruct party's access to evidence or conceal document of evidentiary\r\nvalue); Rule 3.4(c) (lawyer shall not knowingly disobey obligation under rule of\r\ntribunal); Rule 5.5 (lawyer shall not engage in unauthorized practice of law); Rule\r\n5.7 (lawyer is subject to Rules of Professional Conduct when providing law related\r\nservices in circumstances that are not distinct from lawyer's legal services); Rule\r\n8.1(a) (lawyer shall not make false statement of material fact to disciplinary\r\nauthority); Rule 8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to disciplinary\r\nauthority's inquiries or requests); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for\r\nlawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or\r\nmisrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to\r\nengage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice). Respondent further\r\nadmits he violated Rule 417, SCACR.\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits his conduct is grounds for discipline under the following\r\nRules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct\r\nor other rules regarding professional conduct of lawyer); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\n\nadministration of justice or to bring courts or legal profession into disrepute or\r\nconduct demonstrating unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a) (7) (it shall be\r\nground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate valid court order issued by a\r\ncourt of this state).                 Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law in this state.4 In addition, we impose the following conditions\r\nas set forth in the Agreement:\r\n\r\n    1) within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall enter into\r\n       a restitution plan with the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the\r\n       Commission) to pay restitution totaling $344,037.81 to the nine individuals\r\n       and entities as stated in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and the\r\n       costs incurred by ODC and Commission in the investigation and prosecution\r\n       of this matter;5 respondent shall not apply for readmission until he has fully\r\n       reimbursed each of these individuals and entities;\r\n\r\n    2) respondent shall not apply for readmission until he has fully reimbursed the\r\n       Lawyers' Fund for Client Protection for all disbursements made on his\r\n       behalf; and\r\n\r\n    3) respondent shall not apply for readmission until he has taken the following\r\n       steps to identify all injured parties and has made full restitution to all injured\r\n       parties:\r\n\r\n              i.)    respondent shall hire a certified public accountant to perform a\r\n                     six-year forensic accounting and audit of all trust accounts,\r\n                     operating accounts, and estate accounts over which respondent\r\n                     had control; and\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n As noted above, the Court denies respondent's request to impose the disbarment\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nretroactively to the date of his interim suspension.\r\n5The amount which shall be paid to the Estate of Client B may be reduced by the\r\namount of any legitimate expense respondent proves was made on behalf of the\r\nestate.\r\n\n            ii.)\t   the certified public accountant issues a report which identifies\r\n                    all accounts reviewed and the dates of the records reviewed,\r\n                    identifies all injured parties and the total loss for each, and\r\n                    provides reasonable assurance that all injured parties have been\r\n                    identified.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an\r\naffidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of\r\nRule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the\r\nPractice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27362","title":"Coleman v.

Zeller, of Washington, DC, for\r\n             Amicus Curiae, AARP Foundation Litigation\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: This is an appeal from orders in a wrongful death suit\r\nand a survival action denying appellants' motions to compel arbitration.1 We\r\naffirm, finding as did the circuit court that respondent lacked authority to sign the\r\narbitration agreements (AA), and that she is not equitably estopped to deny their\r\nenforceability.                        FACTS\r\n\r\nRespondent Ann Coleman (Sister) signed a number of documents in June 2006\r\nfollowing which her sister Mary Brinson, now deceased (Decedent), was admitted\r\nto appellant Faith Health Care Center (Facility). Decedent was readmitted to\r\nFacility after Sister again signed documents in December 2006. Decedent died on\r\nApril 30, 2007, and Sister subsequently brought these wrongful death and survival\r\nactions against numerous defendants, some of which are appellants.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n\r\n             I. \tDoes an individual exercising authority to consent to\r\n                 decisions concerning a patient's health care under the Adult\r\n                 Health Care Consent Act have the capacity to execute a\r\n                 voluntary arbitration agreement?\r\n\r\n             II. If there is no such authority under the Act, is Sister equitably\r\n                estopped to deny the validity of the arbitration agreements\r\n                she executed when Decedent was admitted to the Facility?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n Although this case involves two arbitration agreements, and two suits, the\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\nrelevant facts and contract terms are identical and the circuit court orders treat the\r\ndispositive issues the same. Accordingly, we dispose of all matters in this opinion.\r\n\nI. Capacity\r\n\r\nThe question of Sister's authority to execute a voluntary AA is one of statutory\r\ninterpretation requiring us to determine the nature and scope of authority granted a\r\nsurrogate by the Adult Heath Care Consent Act (Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-66-10\r\net seq. (2002 and Supp. 2012). We therefore turn to the Act itself. See e.g. S.C.\r\nState Ports Auth. v. Jasper Cnty., 368 S.C. 388, 629 S.E.2d 624 (2006) (when\r\nconstruing statutory term, all sections of the same general statutory law should be\r\nread together).\r\n\r\nAt the time of Decedent's two admissions to Facility she was unable to consent\r\nwithin the meaning of Â§ 44-66-20(6) of the Act. The Act applies to adults2 who are\r\n\"unable to appreciate the nature and implications of [their] condition and proposed\r\nhealth care, to make a reasoned decision concerning the proposed health care, or to\r\ncommunicate that decision in an unambiguous manner.\" Id. The Act creates a\r\npriority list to determine the persons able to consent on behalf of an incapacitated\r\npatient:       (1) \tprobate court guardian if decision is within the scope of the\r\n                    guardianship;\r\n\r\n               (2) \tattorney-in-fact pursuant to a durable power of attorney\r\n                    executed by the patient pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-5-\r\n                    501 if within the scope of the attorney-in-fact's power;\r\n\r\n               (3) \tan individual given priority pursuant to another statutory\r\n                    provision;\r\n\r\n               (4) \tspouse, subject to certain qualifications;\r\n\r\n               (5) \tpatient's parent or adult child;\r\n\r\n               (6) \tpatient's adult sibling, grandparent, or adult grandchild;\r\n\r\n               (7) \tanother blood relative the health care professional\r\n                    reasonably believes to have a close relationship with the\r\n                    patient; or\r\n\r\n    It also applies to married or emancipated minors.\r\n2\r\n\n             (8) \ta person given authority to make health care decisions for\r\n                  the patient by a different statutory provision.\r\n\r\n             Â§ 44-66-30(A).\r\n\r\nHere, Sister was authorized to make health care decisions for Decedent only\r\nbecause Decedent had no guardian or attorney-in-fact, no other individual had\r\nstatutory priority, and she had neither a spouse, a parent, nor an adult child.\r\n\r\nAs the individual with priority under Â§ 44-66-30(A), Sister was authorized to make\r\n\"decisions concerning [Decedent's] health care . . . .\" Id. The definitional section\r\nof the Act provides:\r\n\r\n             \"Health care\" means a procedure to diagnose or treat a human\r\n             disease, ailment, defect, abnormality, or complaint, whether of\r\n             physical or mental origin. It also includes the provision of\r\n             intermediate or skilled nursing care; services for the\r\n             rehabilitation of injured, disabled, or sick persons; and the\r\n             placement in or removal from a facility that provides these\r\n             forms of care.\r\n\r\n             Â§ 44-66-20(1).3\r\n\r\nIn effect, the Act gives Sister two types of authority. First, she could consent, on\r\nbehalf of Decedent, to the provision or withholding of medical care including\r\nplacement in a facility which provides such care. Second, the Act authorized Sister\r\nto make certain financial decisions on behalf of Decedent, decisions that obligated\r\nDecedent to pay for services rendered.\r\n\r\nThe decision to place an incapacitated adult in a nursing facility or a rehabilitative\r\ninstitution is delegated to the surrogate under the Act. Once the decision is made\r\nthat such placement is appropriate, the surrogate must decide which institution will\r\nprovide the best care. In making this critical decision, the surrogate must also bear\r\nin mind the financial resources of the patient. Thus, the decision to place Decedent\r\nin Facility required Sister to use both powers given her by the Act, the medical and\r\n\r\n\r\n 2013 Act No. 39, effective January 1, 2011, altered other definitions in this\r\n3\r\n\r\n\r\nstatute.\r\n\nthe financial, and to make these decisions as the Decedent wished or, if her wishes\r\ncould not be determined, then in Decedent's best interest. Â§ 44-66-30(H).\r\n\r\nIn reviewing nursing home options, the surrogate must consider what services the\r\nhome offers and the cost for such services. For example, some homes might offer\r\nlaundry services or field trips for a fee, while others include these services as part\r\nof the comprehensive charge. The contract terms offered as part of an admission\r\nagreement will often require the surrogate to weigh questions that do not directly\r\ninvolve medical treatment or procedures, but are a necessary part of the decision\r\nregarding which institution the patient should be placed in.\r\n\r\nThat the Act contemplates that the surrogate's authority extends primarily to\r\ntraditional health care decisions, and only secondarily to the financial decisions\r\nnecessitated by those decisions, is illustrated by other provisions of the Act. These\r\nsections illustrate that the purpose of the Act is to insure that the patient's wishes\r\nconcerning her medical treatment are honored whenever possible, and that decision\r\nmaking by the surrogate is a last resort. For example, Â§ 44-66-30(E) states that no\r\none may consent to \"health care decisions\" if the responsible medical provider\r\ndetermines that the patient's inability to consent is temporary and that waiting for\r\nthe patient to regain competency will not result in significant detriment to the\r\npatient's health. Further, if the health care professional knows the patient's wishes\r\nto be contrary to those expressed by the surrogate, the professional must honor the\r\npatient's wishes. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-60 (2002); Harvey v. Strickland, 350\r\nS.C. 303, 566 S.E.2d 529 (2002). Finally, the Act separates health care from\r\nfinances in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-70 (2002). Subsection (A) provides the\r\nsurrogate who makes a good faith health care decision \"is not subject to civil or\r\ncriminal liability on account of the substance of the decision.\" Section 44-66-\r\n70(B) provides \"A person who consents to health care as provided in Section 44-\r\n66-30 does not by virtue of that consent become liable for the costs of the care\r\nprovided to the patient.\"\r\n\r\nHere, Sister was presented with two documents at each of Decedent's admissions: a\r\n\"RESIDENTIAL ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AGREEMENT\" and an\r\n\"AGREEMENT FOR ARBITRATION.\" The admission and financial agreement\r\nprovides that it \"sets forth the terms under which the Facility will provide long\r\nterm care health services to [Decedent] and how the [Decedent] will pay for such\r\nservices.\" Assent to this contract was a condition for Decedent's admission to\r\nFacility. On the other hand, the AA was not required for Decedent's admission,\r\ncontained no provision for medical, nursing, or health care services to be provided\r\n\nfor Decedent, and did not require any financial commitment to pay for such\r\nservices. The scope of Sister's authority to consent to \"decisions concerning\r\nDecedent's health care\" extended to the admission agreement, which was the basis\r\nupon which Facility agreed to provide health care and Sister agreed to pay for it.\r\nThe separate arbitration agreement concerned neither health care nor payment, but\r\ninstead provided an optional method for dispute resolution between Facility and\r\nDecedent or Sister should issues arise in the future. Under the Act, Sister did not\r\nhave the capacity to bind Decedent to this voluntary arbitration agreement. We\r\ntherefore affirm the circuit court's holding that the Act did not confer authority on\r\nSister to execute a document which involved neither health care nor financial terms\r\nfor payment of such care.4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n The dissent asserts we read the surrogate's power broadly in finding Sister\r\n4\r\n\r\n\r\nobligated Decedent to pay for the costs associated with her care at Facility and\r\ncriticizes us for not also finding authority to sign the AA. Contrary to the dissent's\r\nview, we have defined the surrogate's authority strictly by reference to the Act\r\nitself, which specifically provides that the surrogate is not financially responsible\r\nfor the costs associated with the health care decisions she makes on behalf of the\r\nincapacitated person. Â§ 44-60-70(B). Second, the dissent is concerned that our\r\nreading of the Act is an \"inadvisable and undesirable\" interpretation because it will\r\ndeny consumers the choice whether to enter arbitration agreements. We are\r\ninterpreting a health care surrogacy act, not consumer rights legislation, and the\r\nsole question before the Court is the scope of the surrogate's authority. While the\r\npower to make decisions other than those involving health care and payment\r\ntherefore on behalf of the incapacitated person, including authority to enter other\r\ntypes of contracts, may be vested in an attorney-in-fact, a probate court guardian,\r\nor another who possesses legal authority, these issues are not before the Court.\r\nBy focusing on the nature of the disputed contracts here, rather than on the scope\r\nof statutory authority, the dissent would rewrite the Act to \"empower surrogates to\r\nmake medical, caretaking, financial and dispute resolution decisions.\" (emphasis\r\nin original). This view of the issue leads the dissent to conclude the majority's\r\nanalysis somehow runs afoul of the rule that arbitration agreements cannot be\r\nsingled out for special treatment when, in fact, it is the dissent which treats\r\narbitration differently. Forced to acknowledge that Sister's defense here, lack of\r\ncontractual capacity, may be raised in any contract case, the dissent asserts that our\r\ndecision \"relies on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate.\" This statement\r\nmisapprehends the role of facts in an appellate opinion. The sole reason that\r\narbitration agreements are referenced in the majority opinion is because those are\r\n\nII. Estoppel\r\n\r\nAppellants contend that even if Sister lacked capacity to execute the AA under the\r\nAct, she is nevertheless equitably estopped to deny the AA's enforceability. The\r\ncircuit court held there was no estoppel here, and we agree.\r\n\r\nAppellants' equitable estoppel argument is premised on their contention that, under\r\nstate law, the admission agreements and the AAs merged. In South Carolina,\r\n\r\n               The general rule is that, in the absence of anything indicating a\r\n               contrary intention, where instruments are executed at the same\r\n               time, by the same parties, for the same purpose, and in the\r\n               course of the same transaction, the courts will consider and\r\n               construe the documents together. The theory is that the\r\n               instruments are effectively one instrument or contract.\r\n\r\n               Klutts Resort Realty, Inc. v. Down Round Dev. Corp., 268 S.C.\r\n               80, 88, 232 S.E.2d 20, 24 (1977).\r\n\r\nHere, the documents were executed at the same time, by the same parties, for the\r\nsame purposes, and in the course of the same transaction. Unless there is a\r\ncontrary intention, appellants are correct that there was a merger.\r\n\r\nThe admission agreements contain this language in a section titled \"Entirety of\r\nAgreement\":    This Agreement, including all Exhibits hereto, and the\r\n               Arbitration Agreement between the Facility and the Resident, if\r\n               the parties sign one, supersede all other agreements, either oral\r\n               or in writing between the parties, and contain all of the\r\n               promises and agreements between the parties. Each party to\r\n               this Agreement acknowledges that no representations,\r\n               inducements, or promises have been made by any party or\r\n               anyone acting on behalf of any party, that are not contained in\r\n\r\nthe contracts challenged in these appeals as beyond the scope of Sister's statutory\r\nauthority.\r\n\n             this Agreement or in the Arbitration Agreement. This\r\n             Agreement may be amended only by a written agreement\r\n             signed on behalf of the Facility and the Resident.\r\n\r\nOn its face, this clause recognizes the \"separatedness\" of the AA and the admission\r\nagreement, not a merger of the two contracts. Moreover, the AA could be\r\ndisclaimed within thirty days of signing while the admission agreement could not,\r\nevidencing an intention that each contract remain separate. By their own terms, the\r\ncontracts between these parties indicated an intent that the common law doctrine of\r\nmerger not apply. Klutts Resort, supra. Even if the \"Entirety\" clause creates an\r\nambiguity as to merger, the law is clear that any ambiguity in such a clause is\r\nconstrued against the drafter, in this case, appellants. See Davis v. KB Home of\r\nS.C., Inc., 394 S.C. 116, 713 S.E.2d 799 (Ct. App. 2011) fn. 4. Since there was no\r\nmerger here, appellants' equitable estoppel argument was properly denied by the\r\ncircuit court.                    CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe Act did not authorize Sister, acting as a health care surrogate, to execute the\r\nseparate, voluntary AAs presented to her by Facility. Further, the predicate for\r\nappellants' argument for application of the doctrine of equitable estoppel, that the\r\nAA and the admission agreement were merged, is not present here. For these\r\nreasons, the decisions of the circuit court are\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE, and HEARN, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in\r\na separate opinion.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. As I see it, there are three\r\nproblems with the majority's interpretation of the definition of \"health care\" found\r\nin section 44-66-20(1) and applied in section 44-66-30(A).5\r\n\r\n      Section 44-66-20(1) defines health care as:\r\n\r\n      a procedure to diagnose or treat a human disease, ailment, defect,\r\n      abnormality, or complaint, whether of physical or mental origin. It\r\n      also includes the provision of intermediate or skilled nursing care;\r\n      services for the rehabilitation of injured, disabled or sick persons; and\r\n      the placement in or removal from a facility that provides these forms\r\n      of care.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-20(1) (2002). Thus, the statutes explicitly permit the\r\nsurrogate to make all types of medical care decisions on behalf of an incompetent\r\npatient, up to and including end-of-life decisions, as well as allowing the surrogate\r\nto choose which care facility in which to place the patient. I agree with the\r\nmajority that the statutes should be interpreted more broadly than the literal\r\nlanguage, and that the surrogate should also have the implied power to make the\r\nfinancial decisions that accompany purely caretaking decisions, such as financially\r\nobligating the patient to pay for care services at the chosen facility.\r\n\r\n       However, my first concern with the majority's interpretation of the statutes is\r\nthat there is an inherent inconsistency between reading the statutes more broadly\r\nthan the literal language to allow a surrogate to bind a patient financially to a\r\nhealthcare contract, but also reading the language narrowly to prohibit the\r\nsurrogate from binding the patient to arbitration of the same contract. No express\r\nstatutory language supports either power; rather, the statutes merely reference the\r\nsurrogate's power to consent regarding \"the placement in or removal from a\r\n[healthcare] facility . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-20(1). I think it is anomalous\r\nto read one of these implied powers into the statute, but not the other. To eliminate\r\nsuch an incongruous result, I would read section 44-66-20(1)'s language regarding\r\n\"the placement in or removal from a [healthcare] facility\" to impliedly encompass\r\nnot just financial decisions but dispute resolution decisions as well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5Section 44-66-30(A) grants potential surrogates, listed in order of priority, the\r\npower to make \"decisions concerning [a patient's] health care\" if the patient is\r\nunable to consent. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-66-30(A) (2002 & Supp. 2012).\r\n\n       Second, I am concerned that the majority's interpretation of the statutes will\r\ncreate undesirable future consequences. The arbitration agreement at issue here is\r\na separate document from the general nursing home residency contract, and\r\npatients may exercise their discretion in deciding whether to sign the arbitration\r\nagreement prior to receiving care at the nursing home. Using a separate contract\r\nfor arbitration agreements is conducive to greater freedom of choice for the\r\nconsumer. It also better protects the nursing home from a contention that the\r\narbitration contract is unconscionable. See Hayes v. Oakridge Home, 908 N.E.2d\r\n408, 413 (Ohio 2009) (holding an arbitration agreement that \"was voluntary and\r\nnot a condition of [] admission\" into the nursing home was not unconscionable).\r\nHowever, the majority's reading of the statutes encourages nursing homes to insert\r\nadhesive arbitration clauses into their general residency contracts, instead of\r\n(perhaps more desirably) allowing patients to enter into such arbitration\r\nagreements at their discretion.\r\n\r\n       While there is nothing inherently \"wrong\" with including an arbitration\r\nagreement in a nursing home residency contract, I believe it is more desirable to\r\nmake arbitration agreements that are healthcare-related, discretionary, and signed\r\nby a surrogate just as enforceable as adhesive arbitration agreements. In my\r\nopinion, presenting consumers with a separate arbitration agreement should be\r\nencouraged because discretionary agreements enable consumers to make a more\r\nvoluntary, knowing, and informed choice to arbitrate. Therefore, I believe it is\r\ninadvisable and undesirable to interpret the statutes in a manner as to encourage\r\nnursing homes to utilize adhesive arbitration agreements more frequently than\r\ndiscretionary arbitration agreements.\r\n\r\n       Third, and most importantly, I believe that the majority's reading of the\r\nstatutes runs afoul of the United States Supreme Court's directives regarding\r\narbitration. The Supreme Court has repeatedly emphasized that arbitration\r\nagreements must be placed on the same footing as all other contracts. AT & T\r\nMobility, L.L.C. v. Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. 1740, 1745â€“46 (2011) (explaining that\r\nplacing arbitration agreements on equal footing with other contracts is consistent\r\nwith the liberal judicial policy favoring arbitration). In particular, the Federal\r\nArbitration Act (FAA) \"requires that states place no greater restrictions upon\r\narbitration provisions than they place upon other contractual terms . . . . Therefore,\r\nwith few limitations, if a state law singles out arbitration agreements and limits\r\ntheir enforceability, it is preempted.\" Saturn Distrib. Corp. v. Williams, 905 F.2d\r\n719, 722 (4th Cir. 1990); accord Doctor's Assocs., Inc. v. Casarotto, 517 U.S. 681,\r\n687 (1996) (\"Courts may not, however, invalidate arbitration agreements under\r\nstate laws applicable only to arbitration provisions.\"); Perry v. Thomas, 482 U.S.\r\n\n483, 492 n.9 (1987) (\"[S]tate law, whether of legislative or judicial origin, is\r\napplicable if that law arose to govern issues concerning the validity, revocability,\r\nand enforceability of contracts generally. A state-law principle that takes its\r\nmeaning precisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue does not\r\ncomport with this requirement of Â§ 2 [of the FAA].\"); Stephen J. Ware, Arbitration\r\nand Unconscionability After Doctor's Associates, Inc. v. Casarotto, 31 Wake Forest\r\nL. Rev. 1001, 1012 (1996) (\"Any law that singles out arbitration agreements by\r\nmaking them less enforceable than other contracts is preempted by the FAA.\").\r\n\r\n         I recognize that the defense asserted hereâ€”that the surrogate lacked the\r\nability to consent to the arbitration agreementâ€”is a generally applicable defense to\r\nall contracts; however, the way the majority applies this defense \"takes its meaning\r\nprecisely from the fact that a contract to arbitrate is at issue.\" Perry, 482 U.S. at\r\n492 n.9; see also Concepcion, 131 S. Ct. at 1747â€“48 (explaining that the FAA may\r\npreempt generally applicable state-law contract defenses if they are applied in a\r\nway that would disfavor arbitration, but not other contracts). It makes no\r\ndifference whether the majority is unjustly limiting the application of section 44-\r\n66-30(A), or whether the General Assembly truly intended to disallow surrogates\r\nthe ability to consent to arbitration involving healthcare-related contracts; in either\r\ncase, a surrogate is given the power to enter into a wide variety of healthcare-\r\nrelated contracts on behalf of the patient except for healthcare-related arbitration\r\nagreements. See Perry, 482 U.S. at 492 n.9 (holding that a court may not apply\r\nstate-law in a manner that \"rel[ies] on the uniqueness of an agreement to arbitrate .\r\n. . , for this would enable the court to effect what we hold today the state legislature\r\ncannot\"). Accordingly, I believe the majority's interpretation is inconsistent with\r\nthe clear instructions of the Supreme Court, and I therefore would reverse and\r\ncompel arbitration between the parties.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27363","title":"Springob v.

We\r\naffirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\r\n                                          I.\r\nIn anticipation of the opening of the University of South Carolina's new basketball\r\narena, the University of South Carolina and the University of South Carolina\r\nGamecock Club (collectively \"the University\") distributed a brochure to high-level\r\nGamecock Club members. The brochure offered these members the opportunity to\r\npurchase premium seating for the upcoming basketball seasons, including a\r\nnumber of amenities for Men's Basketball season, Women's Basketball season, and\r\nother events held at the arena. These amenities included preferred parking, access\r\nto a private area of the arena known as the McGuire Club, and the option to\r\npurchase the best tickets to all events held at the arena.1\r\n\r\nThe brochure offered these Gamecock Club members the opportunity to purchase\r\nthese tickets over a \"five year term.\" Members were to pay $5,000 per seat in the\r\nfirst year and $1,500 per seat each year in years two through five. Appellants have\r\noffered affidavits stating that Athletic Department employees promised Appellants\r\nthat, after year five, they would only have to maintain their Gamecock Club\r\nmembership and pay the face value of season tickets to retain these premium seats.\r\nAppellants accepted the University's offer and made the required payments for\r\nyears one through five.\r\n\r\nAfter the fifth year, the University contacted Appellants and requested a $1,500\r\npayment per seat for the sixth year of premium seating. Appellants requested that\r\nthe University review the history of the seat offerings to determine whether these\r\npayments were required. The University concluded that the agreement did require\r\nmembers to continue paying the $1,500 fee per seat every year that they wished to\r\nretain the premium seating.\r\n\r\n1 The brochure was a lure for Gamecock Club members who wanted to \"get close\r\nto the action\" and \"see every pick, pump, bump and dunk!\" It also promised that\r\n\"with these big time seats come plenty of big time amenities[,]\" and the rhetorical\r\n\"[s]ound too good to be true?\"\r\n\nAppellants subsequently brought an action against the University alleging breach\r\nof contract and seeking specific performance. After discovery, the parties filed\r\ncross motions for summary judgment. The trial judge denied Appellants' motion\r\nand granted the University's motion, finding that due to the absence of a written\r\ncontract the statute of frauds barred Appellants' claims. Appellants filed a timely\r\nnotice of appeal, and we certified the appeal from the court of appeals pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b), SCACR.                      II.\r\n\r\nIn reviewing a trial court's grant of summary judgment, we apply \"the same\r\nstandard required of the circuit court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\" Bass v. Gopal,\r\nInc., 395 S.C. 129, 133, 716 S.E.2d 910, 912 (2011) (citing Edwards v. Lexington\r\nCnty. Sheriff's Dep't, 386 S.C. 285, 290, 688 S.E.2d 125, 128 (2010)). Rule 56(c)\r\nprovides that summary judgment is proper only when \"the pleadings, depositions,\r\nanswers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if\r\nany, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\nparty is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. \"In\r\ndetermining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the court must view\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in\r\nthe light most favorable to the non-moving party.\" Bass, 395 S.C. at 133â€“34, 716\r\nS.E.2d at 912 (citing Gignilliat v. Gignilliat, Savitz & Bettis, L.L.P., 385 S.C. 452,\r\n456, 684 S.E.2d 756, 758 (2009)). \"[T]he non-moving party is only required to\r\nsubmit a mere scintilla of evidence in order to withstand a motion for summary\r\njudgment.\" Hancock v. Mid-South Mgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801,\r\n803 (2009).                              III.\r\n\r\nAppellants claim the trial court erred by granting Respondents' motion for\r\nsummary judgment because the agreement does not fall within the statute of\r\nfrauds, or, alternatively, that the University is equitably estopped from asserting\r\nthe statute of frauds. While we find that the agreement is subject to the statute of\r\nfrauds, we find there is a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the\r\nUniversity is equitably estopped from asserting the statute of frauds as a defense.\r\n\n                                          A. \n\r\n\r\nAppellants allege that their claims are not subject to the statute of frauds because\r\nthe agreement was capable of being performed within one year. Alternatively,\r\nAppellants claim that the brochure distributed by the University constitutes a\r\nsigned writing sufficient to satisfy the statute of frauds. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\"[T]he Statute of Frauds requires that a contract that cannot be performed within\r\none year be in writing and signed by the parties.\" Davis v. Greenwood Sch. Dist.\r\n50, 365 S.C. 629, 634, 620 S.E.2d 65, 67 (2005) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 32-3-10\r\n(1991)). If there is a possibility that a contract might be performed within one\r\nyear, the statute of frauds is not a bar to enforcement of the contract. Roberts v.\r\nGaskins, 327 S.C. 478, 484, 486 S.E.2d 771, 774 (Ct. App. 1997).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the trial court that the agreement was not capable of being\r\nperformed within one year. Indeed, the very language of the brochure states that\r\nthe agreement to purchase premium seating was for a \"five year term.\" It is\r\nundisputed that the agreement, at the very least, required the Appellants to pay\r\n$5,000 per seat in year one and $1,500 per seat each year during years two through\r\nfive. In turn, the University was required to provide Appellants with premium\r\nseating each year. Even if Appellants were to remit the entire sum of $11,000 per\r\nseat during the first year, the University's additional obligations under the\r\nagreement could not be performed in less than five years. Thus, we find there is no\r\ngenuine issue of material fact as to whether the statute of frauds applies. Having\r\nfound that the statute of frauds applies, we turn now to Appellants' contention that\r\nthe brochure distributed by the University satisfies the signed writing requirement.\r\n\r\nIn order to satisfy the statute of frauds, there must be a writing signed by the party\r\nagainst whom enforcement is sought, and \"the writings must establish the essential\r\nterms of the contract without resort to parol evidence.\" Cash v. Maddox, 265 S.C.\r\n480, 484, 220 S.E.2d 121, 122 (1975) (citing Barr v. Lyle, 263 S.C. 426, 430, 211\r\nS.E.2d 232, 234 (1975)). However, \"[u]nder the statute of frauds, the form of the\r\nwriting is not material, and may be shown entirely by written correspondence . . . .\"\r\nBarr, 263 S.C. at 430, 211 S.E.2d at 234 (citing Speed v. Speed, 213 S.C. 401, 408,\r\n49 S.E.2d 588, 591 (1948)). Appellants claim that the brochure, cancelled checks,\r\npayment records, and letters from the University confirming Appellants' rights to\r\nthe premium seats collectively constitute a signed writing sufficient to satisfy the\r\nstatute of frauds.\r\n\nInitially, we agree with the University that there is no formal contract signed by the\r\nparties. Even if we were to construe the brochure and correspondence from the\r\nUniversity to constitute sufficient writings, these writings must bear the\r\nUniversity's signature for the statute of frauds to be satisfied. The presence or\r\nabsence of the University's signature turns on whether the University logo on the\r\nbrochure suffices for a legal signature. Appellants claim the University logo is a\r\nvalid signature for these purposes but cite no authority to support this proposition,\r\nand the majority rule is contrary to Appellants' position. See, e.g., Venable v.\r\nHickerson, Phelps, Kirtley & Assocs., 903 S.W.2d 659, 662â€“63 (Mo. Ct. App.\r\n1995) (finding that an employer's logo on a monogrammed notepad was not\r\nsufficient to constitute a signature); Falls v. Va. State Bar, 397 S.E.2d 671, 673\r\n(Va. 1990) (holding that a logo on the Virginia State Bar's personnel manual was\r\nnot a signature). We elect to follow the vast majority of jurisdictions and hold that\r\na logo does not constitute a legal signature. Moreover, we find that the brochure\r\nand subsequent correspondence do not \"establish the essential terms of the contract\r\nwithout resort to parol evidence.\" Cash, 265 S.C. at 484, 220 S.E.2d at 122.\r\n\r\nIn sum, we find the agreement between Appellants and the University falls within\r\nthe statute of frauds. Additionally, we find that there is no signed writing\r\nsufficient to satisfy the requirements of the statute of frauds, and that the brochure\r\nand correspondence from the University do not establish all of the essential terms\r\nof the agreement. We turn now to Appellants' reliance on the doctrine of equitable\r\nestoppel.                                 B.\r\n\r\n\"[T]he doctrine of estoppel may be invoked to prevent a party from asserting the\r\nstatute of frauds.\" Collins Music Co. v. Cook, 281 S.C. 580, 583, 316 S.E.2d 418,\r\n420 (Ct. App. 1984) (citing Florence Printing Co. v. Parnell, 178 S.C. 119, 127,\r\n182 S.E. 313, 316 (1935)). The party asserting estoppel \"must show that he has\r\nsuffered a definite, substantial, detrimental change of position in reliance on the\r\ncontract, and that no remedy except enforcement of the bargain is adequate to\r\nrestore his former position.\" Id. \"It is not sufficient to show merely that he has\r\nlost an expected benefit under the contract.\" Id. \"Before the estoppel doctrine can\r\nbe invoked, however, there must be competent proof of the existence of the oral\r\ncontract.\" Atl. Wholesale Co. v. Solondz, 283 S.C. 36, 40, 320 S.E.2d 720, 723 (Ct.\r\nApp. 1984) (quotations and citations omitted).\r\n\nTaking the evidence in the light most favorable to the Appellants, we find there is\r\nproof of an oral contract between the parties. Certainly, it is undisputed that there\r\nis an agreement for performance over the initial five-year period, and the\r\nUniversity so concedes. Appellants' affidavits create a fact question as to the\r\nexistence of an oral contract beyond year five. Indeed, Appellants' affidavits state\r\nthey were induced to purchase the special seating under an oral promise that they\r\nwould not have to pay a fee separate from the Gamecock Club membership and the\r\nface value of season tickets beyond year five. This is sufficient to create an issue\r\nof material fact as to whether Appellants suffered a definite, substantial, and\r\ndetrimental change in reliance on these purported oral representations. Thus, we\r\nfind that the trial court erred in granting summary judgment in favor of the\r\nUniversity.2                              IV.\r\n\r\nWe affirm insofar as the trial court applied the statute of frauds but reverse the trial\r\ncourt's entry of summary judgment in favor of the University as to Appellants'\r\nequitable estoppel claim. We remand the matter for further proceedings consistent\r\nwith this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring\r\nin a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Appellants also claim that the part performance exception to the statute of frauds\r\napplies. Because we find that a genuine issue of material fact exists as to estoppel,\r\nwe need not reach the issue of part performance. See Futch v. McAllister Towing\r\nof Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (providing\r\nthat an appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of a prior\r\nissue is dispositive).\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur but write separately because I do not agree\r\nwith the majority's holding that a logo can never constitute a signature for purposes\r\nof the statute of frauds. Such a holding is unnecessary to resolve the issue in light\r\nof the absence of essential terms of a contract in the writings. I would not reach the\r\nissue in this factual setting, as I find the question more nuanced than the majority\r\nsuggests.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27364","title":"Pallares v.

Pallares appealed, and this Court certified the case for review\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\r\n\n                                    I. FACTS \n\r\n\r\n        As one party aptly describes the situation, \"Appellant and the Respondents\r\nare neighbors who obviously do not get along.\" The three parties live in separate\r\nresidences in the Shandon/Rosewood area of Columbia. Pallares filed an amended\r\ncomplaint on March 7, 2008 asserting Respondents had \"mounted a campaign to\r\nharass and humiliate\" her and to \"drive her from her home.\" Pallares outlined four\r\nareas of conduct by one or both Respondents involving (1) code violations at\r\nPallares's home, (2) nuisance animals, (3) a petition for a mental evaluation, and\r\n(4) requests for restraining orders, which Pallares averred gave rise to civil tort\r\nliability.\r\n\r\n       Pallares first contended Respondents had \"filed baseless complaints against\r\nher with the City of Columbia for various housing and building code violations,\r\nonly to have those complaints dismissed by the authorities, on or about April 27th,\r\n2006.\" Pallares also \"allege[d] that on August 4th, 2006 defendant Seinar\r\ninstigated criminal charges against [her] alleging that [her] pet dogs were a\r\nnuisance, in violation of the City's criminal ordinances.\" Pallares contended \"that\r\non October 30th, 2006 these charges were dismissed as groundless.\"\r\n\r\n        Pallares next asserted \"that on May 18, 2007, defendant Seinar filed a\r\npetition with the Richland County Probate Court alleging [Pallares] was mentally\r\nill, and in need of a mandatory mental evaluation.\"1 Pallares contended \"the\r\nevaluation was normal, and the petition was dismissed.\" Pallares lastly alleged\r\nRespondents filed actions in the Richland County Magistrate's Court seeking\r\nrestraining orders against her, but the requests were denied.2 Pallares contended all\r\nof the above complaints were made by Respondents with malice and without\r\nprobable cause for the ulterior purpose of harassing her and subjecting her to\r\nridicule. Pallares stated Respondents acted in concert to harm her, with a\r\n\r\n1 The petition was signed by both Respondents, as was clarified at the hearing in\r\nthis matter. An Order for Examination was issued by the Richland County Probate\r\nCourt on June 7, 2007. Two examiners prepared reports dated June 18, 2007\r\nconcluding Pallares was not suffering from mental illness.\r\n2 Respondents made the requests after Pallares was found not to be mentally ill. In\r\nher statement in support of a restraining order, Maseng opined that if Pallares was\r\nnot mentally ill, then she must be acting out of malice. Respondents described\r\nmultiple occasions on which Pallares allegedly followed them, photographed them,\r\nand stared and/or glared at them.\r\n\nconscious indifference to her rights, and that their ultimate intent was to run her out\r\nof the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, Pallares asserted claims for (1) malicious\r\nprosecution, (2) abuse of process, (3) invasion of privacy, (4) intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress, and (5) civil conspiracy. Respondents filed answers denying\r\nthe allegations. Respondent Maseng also counterclaimed, seeking an order\r\nrequiring the abatement of a nuisance and damages based on Pallares's alleged\r\nfailure to properly maintain her property.\r\n\r\n       Respondents moved for summary judgment as to all claims. The circuit\r\ncourt granted partial summary judgment to Respondents on the claims for\r\nmalicious prosecution, abuse of process, and civil conspiracy, and denied summary\r\njudgment on the remaining claims for invasion of privacy and intentional infliction\r\nof emotional distress. Pallares appealed to the Court of Appeals, and this Court\r\ncertified the case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                            II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides a motion\r\nfor summary judgment shall be granted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\ninterrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show\r\nthat there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is\r\nentitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\"\r\n\r\n       In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the trial court must\r\nview the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn therefrom in the\r\nlight most favorable to the party opposing summary judgment. Brockbank v. Best\r\nCapital Corp., 341 S.C. 372, 534 S.E.2d 688 (2000). \"An appellate court reviews\r\nthe granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial\r\ncourt pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP.\" Id. at 379, 534 S.E.2d at 692.\r\n\r\n                                III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n      On appeal, Pallares challenges the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\nto Respondents on her claims for (1) malicious prosecution and (2) abuse of\r\nprocess.3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3   Pallares does not challenge the court's ruling on the civil conspiracy claim. Â \r\n\nA.    Malicious Prosecution\r\n\r\n      Pallares first contends the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment\r\nto Respondents on her claim for malicious prosecution. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"[T]o maintain an action for malicious prosecution, a plaintiff must\r\nestablish: (1) the institution or continuation of original judicial proceedings;4\r\n(2) by or at the instance of the defendant; (3) termination of such proceedings in\r\n[the] plaintiff's favor; (4) malice in instituting such proceedings; (5) lack of\r\nprobable cause; and (6) resulting injury or damage.\" Law v. S.C. Dep't of Corr.,\r\n368 S.C. 424, 435, 629 S.E.2d 642, 648 (2006) (first alteration in original)\r\n(citations omitted). \"An action for malicious prosecution fails if the plaintiff\r\ncannot prove each of the required elements by a preponderance of the evidence,\r\nincluding malice and lack of probable cause.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"Malice is defined as 'the deliberate[,] intentional doing of an act without\r\njust cause or excuse.'\" Id. at 437, 629 S.E.2d at 649 (quoting Eaves v. Broad River\r\n                       â€Š\r\nElec. Coop., Inc., 277 S.C. 475, 479, 289 S.E.2d 414, 416 (1982)). \"Malice does\r\nnot necessarily mean a defendant acted out of spite, revenge, or with a malignant\r\ndisposition, although such an attitude certainly may indicate malice.\" Id. \"In an\r\naction for malicious prosecution, malice may be inferred from a lack of probable\r\ncause to institute the prosecution.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      \"Probable cause in this context does not turn upon the plaintiff's guilt or\r\ninnocence, but rather upon whether the facts within the prosecutor's knowledge\r\nwould lead a reasonable person to believe the plaintiff was guilty of the crimes\r\ncharged.\" Kinton v. Mobile Home Indus., Inc., 274 S.C. 179, 181, 262 S.E.2d 727,\r\n728 (1980).\r\n\r\n       Where a plaintiff bases the claim on an opponent's institution of civil causes\r\nof action, probable cause exists if the facts and circumstances would lead a person\r\nof ordinary intelligence to believe that the plaintiff committed one or more of the\r\nacts alleged in the opponent's complaint. Broyhill v. Resolution Mgmt.\r\nConsultants, Inc., 401 S.C. 466, 475, 736 S.E.2d 867, 871-72 (Ct. App. 2012). The\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4  The \"original judicial proceedings\" can be civil or criminal. See generally Law\r\nv. S.C. Dep't of Corr., 368 S.C. 424, 629 S.E.2d 642 (2006); Broyhill v. Resolution\r\nMgmt. Consultants, Inc., 401 S.C. 466, 736 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2012).\r\n\nissue is not what the actual facts were, but what the prosecuting party honestly\r\nbelieved them to be. Eaves, 277 S.C. at 478, 289 S.E.2d at 416 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       A party must show the opponent lacked probable cause as to each cause of\r\naction asserted to prevail on a claim of malicious prosecution; thus, the existence\r\nof probable cause as to any one is sufficient to defeat a malicious prosecution\r\nclaim. Broyhill, 401 S.C. at 475, 736 S.E.2d at 871-72. Whether probable cause\r\nexists is ordinarily a jury question, but it may be decided as a matter of law when\r\nthe evidence yields only one conclusion. Law, 368 S.C. at 436, 629 S.E.2d at 649\r\n(citing Parrott v. Plowden Motor Co., 246 S.C. 318, 323, 143 S.E.2d 607, 609\r\n(1965)).\r\n\r\n       In granting summary judgment, the circuit court focused on the element of\r\nprobable cause, stating Pallares \"has failed to allege any material facts that would\r\nsuggest that Seinar and Maseng did not honestly believe they had probable cause to\r\nlodge their complaints.\" The court stated the record showed that Seinar\r\ncomplained to Animal Control / Columbia Police on three separate occasions that\r\nPallares's dogs were barking excessively, and the incident reports from those\r\ncomplaints set forth information detailing the existence of probable cause on each\r\ncomplaint. The court noted that the Municipal Code of the City of Columbia, SC\r\nÂ§ 4-70 provides an animal constitutes a nuisance if it is allowed to bark in an\r\nexcessive, continuous, or untimely manner that results in a serious annoyance or an\r\ninterference with the reasonable use and enjoyment of neighboring premises.\r\n\r\n       The court further stated it was undisputed that Respondents had made\r\ncomplaints with the City of Columbia for housing and code violations occurring on\r\nPallares's property. The court found the City first served Pallares with warning\r\nnotices of these violations, and the violations were thereafter remedied by Pallares.\r\nThe court determined the service of warnings to Pallares affirmed the fact that\r\nRespondents had probable cause to initiate their complaints. Furthermore, the\r\ndecision whether to enforce the code violations was made by the City, not by\r\nRespondents. The court concluded summary judgment in favor of Respondents\r\nwas appropriate on the claim for malicious prosecution \"because Seinar and\r\nMaseng had probable cause\" to make their complaints against Pallares.\r\n\r\n      We find the record supports the circuit court's decision to grant summary\r\njudgment to Respondents on Pallares's claim for malicious prosecution because the\r\nonly evidence in the record demonstrates there was probable cause to support one\r\nor more of the complaints lodged by Respondents, which defeats Pallares's claim\r\nfor malicious prosecution as a matter of law.\r\n\n       The record contains an incident report on or about January 4, 2005\r\ndocumenting a complaint by Seinar about dogs barking at Pallares's residence:\r\n\"Complainant reports that a[n] animal (dog) was continuously barking at the rear\r\nof the above Incident Location for hours. Upon arrival Reporting Officer observed\r\na dog at Incident Location constantly barking causing [a] disturbance in the\r\nneighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n       An incident report from April 5, 2005 demonstrates an officer again found\r\nthe dogs barking at Pallares's residence: \"Complainant [Seinar] states that the\r\nsubject has two dogs that bark constantly and are a nuisance to the neighborhood.\r\nComplainant states that this is an ongoing problem.\" The officer commented in a\r\nsupplemental report that he observed an extended period of barking during his\r\nvisit: \"While reporting officer was talking to the subject, the dog was heard\r\nbarking for almost the entire time. (Thirty mins. to an hour[.])\"\r\n\r\n      Lastly, an incident report from on or around August 2, 2006 records Seinar's\r\ncomplaint about the dogs barking during the night: \"Complainant states that the\r\ndogs at 407 S. Ravenel St. were barking uncontrol[l]ably all night long keeping her\r\nawake. Animal Control was called by Complainant several times. Responding\r\nOfficer was at the listed location for 15 minutes and heard the dogs barking and\r\nkeeping up the neighborhood. Responding Officer advised Complainant to sign a\r\nwarrant on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n      Seinar did sign warrants at the officer's suggestion.5 Although Pallares\r\nchallenges these warrants, we find their manner of execution and the fact that they\r\nwere not prosecuted does not negate the fact that there was probable cause to\r\nsupport Seinar's animal nuisance complaints, as documented in the officers'\r\nreports.\r\n\r\n      The record also supports the circuit court's conclusion that the only evidence\r\npresented showed there was probable cause for one or more of the code\r\ncomplaints. The City Inspections Department issued Pallares a Warning / Notice\r\nof Violation on June 17, 2004 for violation of a City ordinance requiring owners to\r\nkeep their property properly cut and cleared of trash, debris, weeds, etc. Pallares\r\nwas directed to remove miscellaneous items, materials, and debris from her\r\npremises. The City issued Pallares a Uniform Ordinance Summons, No. 7577,\r\n\r\n5 On August 4, 2006, Seinar signed two separate warrants for the 2005 incidents,\r\nbut neglected to include the most recent incident from 2006, so the prosecutor\r\ndeclined to prosecute the warrants \"at that time\" because they were signed more\r\nthan one year after the allegations described therein.\r\n\nordering her to appear for trial in the City of Columbia Municipal Court for this\r\nviolation. The City Inspections Department issued another Warning / Notice of\r\nViolation to Pallares on January 26, 2005 for failing to keep the premises properly\r\ncut and cleared, and she was directed to remove all discarded items from her\r\ndriveway. On April 5, 2005, the Property Maintenance Code Official issued a\r\nNotice of Complaint upon finding, after an investigation, that Pallares had property\r\n(a shed) that violated a City code provision governing property maintenance.\r\n\r\n       Pallares contends \"the city administrator [has] pointed out that several of the\r\ncomplaints were groundless and did not amount to code violations,\" citing to an e-\r\nmail dated April 27, 2006 from Marc Mylott. The e-mail does not support\r\nPallares's suggestion that there was no probable cause for the code complaints\r\nbecause some of them were found to be \"groundless.\" To the contrary, Mylott\r\nindicates that Pallares had abated a violation regarding bricks in the right of way,\r\nand that the City had not prosecuted the 2004 violation for which Pallares was\r\nissued Uniform Ordinance Summons No. 7577 because previously code\r\nenforcement inspectors had the discretion whether to proceed to a trial if \"a\r\nproperty owner abated the violation(s) just prior to court.\" Thus, the fact that the\r\nCity did not proceed to trial on a documented violation does not obviate the\r\nexistence of probable cause for the violation. The existence of probable cause as to\r\nany of these allegations is sufficient to defeat Pallares's claim for malicious\r\nprosecution.\r\n\r\nB.    Abuse of Process\r\n     Pallares next argues the circuit court erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nRespondents on her claim for abuse of process. We agree.\r\n\r\n        The tort of abuse of process is intended to compensate a party for harm\r\nresulting from another party's misuse of the legal system. Food Lion, Inc. v.\r\nUnited Food & Commercial Workers Int'l Union, 351 S.C. 65, 74 n.5, 567 S.E.2d\r\n251, 255 n.5 (Ct. App. 2002). \"Process,\" as used in this context, has been\r\ninterpreted broadly to include the entire range of procedures incident to the\r\nlitigation process. Id. at 70, 567 S.E.2d at 253.\r\n\r\n       The essential elements of abuse of process are (1) an ulterior purpose, and\r\n(2) a willful act in the use of the process that is not proper in the regular conduct of\r\nthe proceeding. Argoe v. Three Rivers Behavioral Ctr. & Psychiatric Solutions,\r\n388 S.C. 394, 697 S.E.2d 551 (2010); Hainer v. Am. Med. Int'l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128,\r\n492 S.E.2d 103 (1997); LaMotte v. Punch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 370\r\nS.E.2d 711 (1988).\r\n\n       The first element, an \"ulterior purpose,\" exists if the process is used to\r\nsecure an objective that is \"not legitimate in the use of the process.\" D.R. Horton,\r\nInc. v. Wescott Land Co., 398 S.C. 528, 551, 730 S.E.2d 340, 352 (Ct. App. 2012)\r\n(citation omitted). An allegation that a party had a \"bad motive\" or an \"ulterior\r\npurpose\" in bringing an action, standing alone, is insufficient to sustain an abuse of\r\nprocess claim. Id. (citing Food Lion, 351 S.C. at 74, 567 S.E.2d at 255).\r\nMoreover, no action lies where a person has an incidental or concurrent motive of\r\nspite or merely seeks to gain a collateral advantage from the process. Food Lion,\r\n351 S.C. at 74-75, 567 S.E.2d at 255-56.\r\n\r\n        However, \"[o]ne who uses a legal process, whether criminal or civil, against\r\nanother primarily to accomplish a purpose for which it is not designed, is subject to\r\nliability for harm caused by the abuse of process.\" Id. at 75, 567 S.E.2d at 255-56\r\n(quoting Restatement (Second) of Torts Â§ 682 (1977)). The collateral objective\r\nmust be the \"sole or paramount reason for acting.\" Id. at 75, 567 S.E.2d at 256.\r\n\r\n       The tort centers on events occurring outside the process; the improper\r\npurpose usually takes the form of coercion to obtain a collateral advantage, not\r\nproperly involved in the proceeding itself, such as the surrender of property or the\r\npayment of money, by the use of the process as a threat or club. D.R. Horton, 398\r\nS.C. at 551, 730 S.E.2d at 352 (citations omitted); see also Hainer, 328 S.C. at\r\n136, 492 S.E.2d at 107 (stating the improper purpose usually takes the form of\r\ncoercion to obtain a collateral advantage); accord Swicegood v. Lott, 379 S.C. 346,\r\n665 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2008); Guider v. Churpeyes, Inc., 370 S.C. 424, 635\r\nS.E.2d 562 (Ct. App. 2006).\r\n\r\n       The second element, a \"willful act,\" has been described as \"[s]ome definite\r\nact or threat not authorized by the process or aimed at an object not legitimate in\r\nthe use of the process[.]\" Hainer, 328 S.C. at 136, 492 S.E.2d at 107. The \"willful\r\nact\" element consists of three components: (1) \"a 'willful' or overt act\"; (2) \"in the\r\nuse of the process\"; (3) \"that is improper because it is either (a) unauthorized or\r\n(b) aimed at an illegitimate collateral objective.\" Food Lion, Inc., 351 S.C. at 71,\r\n567 S.E.2d at 254 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n      In granting summary judgment to Respondents on Pallares's claim for abuse\r\nof process, the circuit court stated \"the only evidence was that City found probable\r\ncause for the complaints in both the animal nuisance and code violations, and that\r\nthe complaint process initiated by Seinar and Maseng [was] carried to its\r\nauthorized conclusion.\" The court further found that, \"[e]ven if Seinar and Maseng\r\nhad an ulterior motive, the Plaintiff has failed to present evidence to suggest that\r\nthere was a 'willful act' by Seinar and Maseng.\"\r\n\n       On appeal, Pallares \"maintains that [Respondents] were trying to drive her\r\nfrom the neighborhood with various legal actions\" and that \"[t]his is [] a classic\r\nexample of the abuse of legal process to obtain a collateral advantage - ejection of\r\nthe plaintiff from her home and her neighborhood.\" Pallares asserts \"[s]he has a\r\nwitness to corroborate [Respondents'] motive.\" The record contains a 2008\r\naffidavit Pallares submitted from a neighbor, Christine Overturf. In the affidavit,\r\nOverturf states she observed Maseng take photographs of Pallares and that she\r\nheard Seinar make derogatory remarks about Pallares's ethnicity and about the fact\r\nthat she wanted Pallares out of the neighborhood.\r\n\r\n       Pallares asserts the elements of abuse of process are less stringent than those\r\nfor malicious prosecution, citing Huggins v. Winn-Dixie Greenville, Inc., 249 S.C.\r\n206, 153 S.E.2d 693 (1967) and its general definition of abuse of process, and she\r\navers there is no required element of actual malice, citing Swicegood v. Lott, 379\r\nS.C. 346, 665 S.E.2d 211 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\n\r\n       We conclude summary judgment was inappropriate on Pallares's claim for\r\nabuse of process because there are genuine issues of material fact regarding the\r\nelements of this claim. Even if Respondents had cause to make some complaints\r\nagainst Pallares, the fact that those were properly instituted does not foreclose an\r\naction for abuse of process if Respondents have, in fact, committed acts outside the\r\nnormal process that are improper. See generally Huggins, 249 S.C. at 209, 153\r\nS.E.2d at 695 (noting the issuance of the process might be justified in itself, but it\r\nis the misuse of the process for an end not lawfully warranted by it that constitutes\r\nthe tort of abuse of process); id. (causing process to issue without justification is an\r\nessential element of malicious prosecution, but not for abuse of process).\r\n\r\n       We find Respondents' act of escalating this \"bad neighbor\" dispute to the\r\npoint of seeking the mental commitment of Pallares constitutes evidence of both an\r\nulterior motive and a willful act. The motive was their obvious dislike of Pallares\r\nand their alleged desire to drive her from the neighborhood. As for the element of\r\na willful act, Respondents sought the commitment of Pallares when they\r\napparently had no legal authority to do so, as is evidenced on the face of their\r\ncommitment petition. The form petition signed by Respondents clearly indicates\r\nthe categories of persons who may seek a mental evaluation for an individualâ€”it is\r\nlimited by state law to \"interested persons,\" statutorily defined as \"a parent,\r\nguardian, spouse, adult next of kin, or nearest friend[.]\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-17-\r\n510 (2002) (providing procedure for petition to be made by \"interested persons\");\r\nid. Â§ 44-23-10(21) (defining \"interested persons\"). Respondents listed their\r\nrelationship to Pallares as \"Neighbors\" on the form petition, which does not come\r\nwithin any of the permissible categories of persons eligible to petition for\r\n\ncommitment under South Carolina law, as Respondents undeniably were not the\r\n\"nearest friend[s]\" of Pallares. Because there is evidence creating a question of\r\nmaterial fact and further development of the record is needed, we find summary\r\njudgment is premature on the claim for abuse of process.6 See Schmidt v.\r\nCourtney, 357 S.C. 310, 592 S.E.2d 326 (Ct. App. 2003) (holding summary\r\njudgment is inappropriate when further development of the facts is desirable to\r\nclarify the application of the law or when there is a dispute as to the conclusions\r\nand inferences to be drawn from the facts; the purpose of summary judgment is to\r\nexpedite the disposition of cases which do not require the services of a fact finder).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6  To the extent Respondents assert issues regarding the Noerr-Pennington doctrine\r\nand judicial immunity as additional sustaining grounds under Rule 220(c),\r\nSCACR, we find these grounds unavailing. These issues were originally asserted\r\nin Respondents' second set of summary judgment motions pertaining to Pallares's\r\nremaining claims. We note the Noerr-Pennington doctrine arose from two United\r\nStates Supreme Court cases involving federal antitrust litigation, Eastern Railroad\r\nPresidents Conference v. Noerr Motor Freight, Inc., 365 U.S. 127 (1961) and\r\nUnited Mine Workers of America v. Pennington, 381 U.S. 657 (1965). The Noerr-\r\nPennington doctrine is based on the First Amendment right to petition the\r\ngovernment for grievances, which includes the right of access to the courts, and\r\nprovides immunity from claims that are based on acts related to this right \"unless\r\nthe act is a mere sham.\" Select Comfort Corp. v. Sleep Better Store, L.L.C., 838 F.\r\nSupp. 2d 889, 896 (D. Minn. 2012). Its purpose is to protect the legitimate\r\nexercise of the constitutional right and to protect against retributive civil claims.\r\nHometown Props., Inc. v. Fleming, 680 A.2d 56, 60 (R.I. 1996). Although the\r\nUnited States Supreme Court developed the doctrine in the context of antitrust\r\nlitigation, its potential application in other contexts has been recognized. Prof'l\r\nReal Estate Investors, Inc. v. Columbia Pictures Indus., Inc., 508 U.S. 49, 59\r\n(1993); Select Comfort Corp., 838 F. Supp. 2d at 896; Kellar v. VonHoltum, 568\r\nN.W.2d 186 (Minn. Ct. App. 1997); Hometown Props., Inc., 680 A.2d at 60.\r\nWhile some jurisdictions have adopted the Noerr-Pennington doctrine and\r\nextended it beyond the antitrust context, South Carolina courts have not previously\r\naddressed the doctrine, and we decline to adopt it at this time. In any event, even if\r\nwe were to adopt the Noerr-Pennington doctrine, we would not apply it to\r\ncompletely insulate a defendant from a tort claim for abuse of process.\r\n\n                              IV. CONCLUSION\r\n      Based on the foregoing, we affirm the circuit court's grant of partial\r\nsummary judgment to Respondents on Pallares's claim for malicious prosecution.\r\nHowever, we reverse the grant of summary judgment on Pallares's claim for abuse\r\nof process and remand the matter to the circuit court for further proceedings in\r\naccordance with this decision.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\nPLEICONES and HEARN, JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a\r\nseparate opinion. TOAL, C.J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in a\r\nseparate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: I concur in result. I write separately because I would\r\nlimit Appellant's abuse of process claim to the mental commitment issue.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I concur in part and dissent in part. While I agree\r\nwith the majority's decision to affirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\nto Respondents on Pallares's claim for malicious prosecution, I would further\r\naffirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment to Respondents on the abuse\r\nof process claim.\r\n\r\n       In concluding that summary judgment was inappropriate on Pallares's claim\r\nfor abuse of process, the majority finds that Respondents' attempt to seek the\r\nmental commitment of Pallares constitutes evidence of both an ulterior motive and\r\na willful act. To the extent that the majority relies on the mental commitment\r\nevidence to support the reversal of the circuit court's grant of summary judgment\r\non the abuse of process claim, I disagree for two reasons.\r\n\r\n        First, in my opinion, the mental commitment issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview. The circuit court order granting partial summary judgment makes no\r\nmention of the attempted mental commitment and Pallares did not make a Rule\r\n59(e) motion to preserve the issue. See Herron v. Century BMW, 395 S.C. 461,\r\n465, 719 S.E.2d 640, 642 (2012) (citation omitted) (\"At a minimum, issue\r\npreservation requires that an issue be raised to and ruled upon by the trial judge.\");\r\nElam v. S.C. Dep't of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 24, 602 S.E.2d 772, 780 (2004) (stating\r\nthat if an issue or argument is raised, but not ruled upon by the trial judge, a party\r\nmay file a Rule 59(e) motion to preserve it for appellate review).\r\n\r\n       Second, I disagree with the majority's broad assertion that neighbors do not\r\nfall within any of the permissible categories of persons eligible to petition for\r\nmental commitment. The statute defining \"interested person\" also defines \"nearest\r\nfriend\" as \"any responsible person who, in the absence of a parent, guardian, or\r\nspouse, undertakes to act for and on behalf of another individual who is incapable\r\nof acting for himself for that individual's benefit, whether or not the individual for\r\nwhose benefit he acts is under legal disability.\" S.C. Code. Ann. Â§ 44-23-10(14)\r\n(2002). Given this definition, I would find that, depending upon the\r\ncircumstances, a neighbor may well qualify as a \"nearest friend,\" and thus, be\r\neligible to petition for mental commitment. In this case, however, the issue was\r\nnot raised or litigated.\r\n\r\n       If the mental commitment issue had been properly preserved, I would\r\nconsider it the only basis upon which this Court should consider reversing the\r\ncircuit court's grant of summary judgment with respect to the abuse of process\r\nclaim. The majority, on the other hand, upholds the entire abuse of process claim.\r\nI would hold that the circuit court was correct in granting Respondents' motion for\r\nsummary judgment on the abuse of process claim because, as the circuit court\r\n\nstated, the complaint process initiated by Respondents for the animal nuisance and\r\ncode violations was \"carried to its authorized conclusion.\" See Hainer v. Am. Med.\r\nInt'l, Inc., 328 S.C. 128, 136, 492 S.E.2d 103, 107 (1997) (\"There is no liability\r\nwhere the defendant has done nothing more than carry out the process to its\r\nauthorized conclusion, even though with bad intentions.\"). Significantly, Pallares\r\nwas issued citations for these violations, which indicates that Respondents properly\r\nutilized the complaint process. Thus, the circuit court did not err in finding an\r\nabsence of evidence that Respondents committed a willful act. See LaMotte v.\r\nPunch Line of Columbia, Inc., 296 S.C. 66, 71, 370 S.E.2d 711, 713â€“14 (1988)\r\n(citation omitted) (holding that appellants had not asserted a cause of action for\r\nabuse of process because they did not allege that respondents engaged in \"a willful\r\nact in the use of the process not proper under regular conduct of the proceedings\").\r\n\r\n      Therefore, because the mental commitment issue is not preserved for our\r\nreview, and because the animal nuisance and code violations do not support the\r\nabuse of process claim, I would affirm the circuit court's grant of summary\r\njudgment on Pallares's claims for both malicious prosecution and abuse of process.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27365","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\n\r\n                        FACTS/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       On July 23, 2006, Petitioner and her boyfriend, Tarquinius Lenard Russell\r\n(the victim), patronized a bar in the Five Points area of Columbia. After leaving\r\nthe bar, the victim became very angry when Petitioner answered a telephone call\r\nfrom another man. According to Petitioner,1 once they arrived at Petitioner's\r\nhome, the victim punched her, kicked her, and pushed her down onto the bed and\r\nchoked her until she passed out. After she awoke, the victim picked up a\r\nDVD/VCR player, swung it at her, and hit her in the face. Petitioner went into the\r\nkitchen, planning to run out the back door, but before she could reach the door, the\r\nvictim grabbed her by the shirt. Petitioner reached for a knife that was on the\r\nkitchen table and \"started swinging, telling him to get away from [her].\" When\r\nPetitioner stopped swinging the knife, she \"took off again to go out the front door,\"\r\nbut the victim came \"running over the couch\" toward her. At that point, Petitioner\r\nbegan swinging the knife again and the couple struggled over control of the knife.\r\nThe victim wrapped his arms around her from behind and tried to cut her with the\r\nknife, which was pointing down. Petitioner testified:\r\n\r\n      He was saying \"I will kill you. I'm going to kill you.\" He was trying\r\n      to make the knife stab me, and that's how I got the nicks on my legs. I\r\n      just remember I was holding on real tight, and I was like, Lord, if he\r\n      gets this knife, he's going to kill me, and that's when he let go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 At trial, Petitioner testified in her own defense. Petitioner described the volatile\r\nnature of her relationship with the victim, including many incidents in which the\r\nvictim hit her or the couple fought. According to Petitioner, she never hit the\r\nvictim first, although she acknowledged that she often fought back. In addition,\r\nDr. Lois Veronen, a clinical psychologist and expert in battered woman syndrome,\r\ntestified that Petitioner \"definitely fits the description of a battered woman.\"\r\n\nWhen the victim let go and she turned around, she saw him \"coming [] down onto\r\nthe knife.\"2\r\n\r\n       Police responded to Petitioner's home after a neighbor telephoned 911.\r\nWhen police arrived, the home was in disarray and Petitioner was on the floor,\r\ncrying and attempting to comfort the victim, who had sustained a knife wound to\r\nthe chest. The victim was transported to the hospital, where he died following\r\nsurgery.3 When police officers first asked Petitioner what happened, Petitioner\r\nmumbled that the victim \"rolled over on the knife.\" She further stated that \"[h]e\r\nwas coming at me over the couch, and I just did it.\" Thereafter, she told an\r\ninvestigator that the victim jumped over the couch and \"landed on\" the knife. On\r\ncross-examination, Petitioner testified that she did not remember making these\r\nstatements to police. Further, Petitioner vehemently denied stabbing the victim\r\nand maintained that the victim received the knife wound from falling on the knife.\r\nHowever, Petitioner stated further:\r\n\r\n      He didn't fall on it. I guess it's just the way his body, when I turned\r\n      around, . . . he was falling . . . . It was an accident. . . . I was trying to\r\n      protect myself. I was trying to protect myself but the initial stab, I\r\n      believe, [was] an accident. I wasn't swinging at him. I just turned\r\n      around.\r\n\r\n       The night of the incident, witnesses observed a scratch on Petitioner's\r\ncollarbone area, two small cuts on her left knee, two small cuts on her left thigh,\r\nand a cut on her bottom lip. After being taken into police custody, Petitioner\r\ndeclined medical attention. In response to standard questions, Petitioner stated that\r\nshe had not suffered a head injury in the preceding seventy-two hours.\r\nPhotographs taken three days after the incident showed that Petitioner's lip was\r\n\r\n2 The State presented evidence that the victim's blood was found on a lamp, the\r\nliving room carpet, the DVD/VCR player, a vacuum cleaner, the kitchen door\r\nframe, the living room and bedroom walls, and on the shirt Petitioner wore to Five\r\nPoints that night.\r\n3An autopsy revealed that, in addition to the stab wound to the victim's chest\r\nwhich was the cause of his death, he sustained five knife wounds to the sides of his\r\nbody and several defense wounds.\r\n\nswollen with a small cut and scratches on her lower neck and upper chest, but did\r\nnot indicate any bruising around Petitioner's neck.\r\n       At the conclusion of the State's evidence, Petitioner's counsel moved for a\r\ndirected verdict on self-defense, arguing that South Carolina law requires the State\r\nto bear the burden of disproving self-defense and that the State had failed to\r\ndisprove every element of self-defense. Petitioner's counsel renewed the motion at\r\nthe close of the evidentiary phase of trial. The trial court denied the motions,\r\nstating, in part, that \"the standard I must apply at the directed verdict stage is such\r\nthat there is either direct or substantial circumstantial evidence to go forward at this\r\nstage for a jury's verdict\" and that because of Petitioner's conflicting statements,\r\nthere was an issue of credibility for the jury.\r\n\r\n       The trial court charged the jury on the law of self-defense,4 accident, defense\r\nof habitation, and the perceptions of battered persons. The jury convicted\r\nPetitioner as indicted. The trial court sentenced Petitioner to an aggregate term of\r\nnine years' imprisonment, but ruled that Petitioner was entitled to early parole\r\neligibility based on the presentation of credible evidence regarding a history of\r\ncriminal domestic violence.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals affirmed Petitioner's convictions, concluding that the\r\nState produced sufficient evidence showing that Petitioner did not act in self-\r\ndefense and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, the\r\nevidence supported submitting the case to the jury. State v. Butler, Op. No. 2011-\r\nUP-127(S.C. Ct. App. filed Mar. 28, 2011).\r\n\r\n      Petitioner sought a writ of certiorari to review the court of appeals' opinion.\r\nThis Court granted the writ of certiorari pursuant to Rule 242, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                  ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n      I.\t    Whether the trial court erred in refusing to apply a standard\r\n             requiring the State to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable\r\n             doubt at the directed verdict stage?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4In instructing the jury on the law of self-defense, the trial court stated that the\r\n\"State has the burden of disproving self-defense by proof beyond a reasonable\r\ndoubt.\"\r\n\n      II.\t   Whether the court of appeals erred in affirming the denial of\r\n             Petitioner's motion for a directed verdict on self-defense?\r\n\r\n                                  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       Petitioner argues the trial court erred by refusing to apply a standard\r\nrequiring the State to disprove self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt at the\r\ndirected verdict stage. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       \"'When ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, the trial judge is concerned\r\nwith the existence of evidence, not its weight.'\" State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538,\r\n544â€“45, 500 S.E.2d 489, 492â€“93 (1998) (quoting State v. Long, 325 S.C. 59, 62,\r\n480 S.E.2d 62, 63 (1997)) (affirming the denial of a directed verdict on self-\r\ndefense because the State presented sufficient evidence to create a jury issue as to\r\nself-defense). In contrast, \"when self-defense is properly submitted to the jury, the\r\ndefendant is entitled to a charge, if requested, that the State has the burden of\r\ndisproving self-defense by proof beyond a reasonable doubt.\" State v. Burkhart,\r\n350 S.C. 252, 262, 565 S.E.2d 298, 303 (2002) (citing State v. Addison, 343 S.C.\r\n290, 293, 540 S.E.2d 449, 451 (2000); Wiggins, 330 S.C. at 544, 500 S.E.2d at\r\n492â€“93).\r\n\r\n       On appeal from the denial of a directed verdict, this Court views the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the State.\r\nState v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006). \"If there is any\r\ndirect evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to\r\nprove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly submitted\r\nto the jury.\" Id. (citing State v. Cherry, 361 S.C. 588, 593â€“94, 606 S.E.2d 475, 478\r\n(2004)).\r\n\r\n       We disagree with Petitioner's reliance on State v. Dickey, 394 S.C. 491, 716\r\nS.E.2d 97 (2011), to support her contention that the trial court applied an incorrect\r\nstandard at the directed verdict stage. In Dickey, the Court held that the defendant\r\nwas entitled to a directed verdict on the issue of self-defense because the\r\nuncontroverted facts established self-defense as a matter of law. Id. at 501, 716\r\nS.E.2d at 102. Therefore, even viewing the facts in a light most favorable to the\r\nState, the Court found that the evidence established that the defendant acted in self-\r\ndefense. Id. at 503, 716 S.E.2d at 103.\r\n\n       Petitioner's case is distinguishable from Dickey. Unlike in Dickey, where the\r\nfacts did not give rise to a jury issue, the evidence in the present case created a jury\r\nissue on the issue of self-defense. See State v. Richburg, 250 S.C. 451, 459, 158\r\nS.E.2d 769, 772 (1968) (\"When the evidence is susceptible of more than one\r\nreasonable inference, questions of fact must be submitted to the jury.\"). For\r\nexample, as the trial court recognized when ruling on the directed verdict motion,\r\nPetitioner's various, inconsistent accounts of how the stabbing occurred created\r\ncredibility issues and questions of fact to be resolved by the jury. Furthermore,\r\nPetitioner's injuriesâ€”a swollen lip, scratches and cuts, but no bruising around the\r\nneckâ€”were not consistent with her testimony that the victim struck her in the head\r\nwith the DVD/VCR player, punched and kicked her, and choked her into\r\nunconsciousness. Therefore, we find the trial court, applying the correct standard\r\nat the directed verdict stage, properly submitted the case to the jury because the\r\nState presented sufficient evidence to disprove self-defense.5\r\n\r\n       Based upon our conclusion that there was sufficient evidence to create a jury\r\nissue, and viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we agree\r\nwith the court of appeals' decision to affirm the denial of Petitioner's motion for a\r\ndirected verdict on self-defense.   CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, the court of appeals' decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nKITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in\r\nresult only. BEATTY, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5We note that the trial court gave a proper jury instruction on self-defense. See\r\nBurkhart, 350 S.C. at 262, 565 S.E.2d at 303.\r\n\n       JUSTICE BEATTY: I agree with the majority's decision to uphold\r\nPetitioner's convictions. However, I concur in result because I take exception to\r\nthe majority's attempt to distinguish State v. Dickey, 394 S.C. 491, 716 S.E.2d 97\r\n(2011). As is evident from my dissent in Dickey, I believe that case was\r\nincorrectly decided and, as a result, has now created confusion regarding the\r\nstandard to be applied when a defendant makes a motion for a directed verdict on\r\nthe basis of self-defense.\r\n\r\n       In Dickey, the defendant, who was a security guard at a Columbia apartment\r\nbuilding, was charged with the murder of a resident's guest. Dickey, 394 S.C. at\r\n495, 716 S.E.2d at 98. The guest, who was indisputably intoxicated and the cause\r\nof a disturbance in the apartment building, was ordered to leave by Dickey. Id.\r\nBecause the guest became verbally aggressive, Dickey called police to report the\r\ndisturbance. Id. As the guest and his friend exited the building, Dickey followed\r\nthem outside to the public sidewalk. Id. An eyewitness testified that the men\r\nshouted obscenities and threatened to harm Dickey as they walked away. Id.\r\nAccording to Dickey, the guest and his friend walked to the corner of Pendleton\r\nStreet and Sumter Street, which was approximately 68 feet from Dickey, then\r\nturned around. Id. at 508, 716 S.E.2d at 106. As the guest walked back towards\r\nthe apartment building, Dickey pulled a gun from his pocket in order to\r\n\"discourage the two men from attacking him.\" Id. at 497, 716 S.E.2d at 99-100.\r\nDickey claimed the guest appeared to reach for a weapon as he continued to\r\nadvance in an aggressive manner. Id. at 497, 716 S.E.2d at 100. Without warning,\r\nDickey fired three shots, killing the guest. Id.\r\n\r\n       At trial, Dickey moved for a directed verdict of acquittal on the ground of\r\nself-defense. Id. at 498, 716 S.E.2d at 100. The trial judge denied this motion and\r\nultimately charged the jury on murder and voluntary manslaughter, as well as the\r\naffirmative defense of self-defense. Id. The jury convicted Dickey of voluntary\r\nmanslaughter. Id. The Court of Appeals affirmed. Id. This Court granted\r\nDickey's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of\r\nAppeals. Id.\r\n\r\n       A majority of this Court reversed, finding Dickey was entitled to a directed\r\nverdict of acquittal on the ground of self-defense as \"the State failed to disprove\r\nthe elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt.\"6 Id. at 503, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n\r\n\r\n6Justice Pleicones concurred in the result reached by the majority; however, he\r\nwould have reversed the decision of the Court of Appeals on the basis there was no\r\n\n103. In reaching this conclusion, the majority found as a matter of law that\r\nDickey: (1) was without fault in bringing about the difficulty; (2) believed he was\r\nin imminent danger of losing his life, or sustaining serious bodily injury, and that a\r\nreasonable person would have entertained the same belief; and (3) had no probable\r\nmeans of avoiding the danger than to act as he did. Id. at 499-503, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n101-03.In my dissent, I expressed disagreement with the majority's decision because\r\nI believed the State presented sufficient evidence to submit the case to the jury. Id.\r\nat 509, 716 S.E.2d at 106 (Beatty, J., dissenting). Specifically, I noted that the\r\nState's evidence created a question of fact as to whether Dickey: (1) was without\r\nfault in bringing on the conflict because he followed the guest and his friend out of\r\nthe building even though he could have remained inside behind the safety of the\r\nlocked doors to wait for police; (2) had a reasonable belief that he was in imminent\r\ndanger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily injury, given he readily exited\r\nthe locked building and continued the confrontation outside of the apartment\r\nbuilding; and (3) had a duty to retreat as he was not within the curtilage of the\r\napartment building at the time of the shooting and there was evidence that he was\r\nphysically able to return to the safety of the building. Id. at 505-09, 716 S.E.2d at\r\n104-06.Today, I adhere to my dissent and write to highlight the confusion created by\r\nthe holding in Dickey, which is compounded by the majority's current attempt to\r\ndistinguish the instant case from Dickey. In finding that Dickey established self-\r\ndefense as a matter of law, the majority stated that the State \"certainly did not\r\nrebut [the] elements of self-defense beyond a reasonable doubt, as the law\r\nrequires.\" Dickey, 394 S.C. at 502, 716 S.E.2d at 102. In my view, this statement\r\nand the related analysis constituted an inexplicable departure from the well-\r\nestablished \"any evidence\" standard for denying a defendant's motion for a directed\r\nverdict on self-defense. See State v. Wiggins, 330 S.C. 538, 544-48, 500 S.E.2d\r\n489, 492-95 (1998) (concluding that the State presented sufficient evidence to\r\ncreate a jury issue as to whether the defendant was acting in self-defense or was\r\nguilty of voluntary manslaughter and stating, \"[w]hen ruling on a motion for a\r\ndirected verdict, the trial judge is concerned with the existence of evidence, not its\r\nweight\" (citation omitted)); see also State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625\r\nS.E.2d 641, 648 (2006) (\"A defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the\r\n[S]tate fails to produce evidence of the offense charged.\"); id. at 292-93, 625\r\n\r\nevidence to support the charge of voluntary manslaughter. Dickey, 394 S.C. at\r\n503-04, 716 S.E.2d at 103-04 (Pleicones, J., concurring).\r\n\nS.E.2d at 648 (\"When reviewing a denial of a directed verdict, this Court views the\r\nevidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to the [S]tate. If\r\nthere is any direct evidence or any substantial circumstantial evidence reasonably\r\ntending to prove the guilt of the accused, the Court must find the case was properly\r\nsubmitted to the jury.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n      As a result of Dickey, members of the Bench and Bar were left with the\r\nimpression that the long-held \"any evidence\" standard for evaluating a directed\r\nverdict motion is not applicable to directed verdict motions when self-defense is\r\nclaimed. Although this consequence may not have been intended by the majority\r\nin Dickey, it is a reality as seen by the issues presented by Petitioner in the instant\r\ncase.  Here, rather than correct the erroneous standard enunciated in Dickey, the\r\nmajority attempts to distinguish Petitioner's case from Dickey. In my opinion, this\r\ncannot be done as the State in both cases presented sufficient evidence to create a\r\njury issue on self-defense.\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, I would affirm Petitioner's convictions and take this\r\nopportunity to clarify that the \"any evidence\" standard is the correct standard to be\r\nemployed by trial judges and our appellate courts in evaluating a defendant's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict on self-defense.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27366","title":"EAGLE v.

Hartley, both of\r\n   Nexsen Pruet, LLC, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This case is an appeal from the court of appeals'\r\ndecision reversing the administrative law court's (ALC) final order, which reversed\r\nand denied the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control's\r\n(DHEC) issuance of a permit (the Landfill Permit) to MRR Highway, 92, LLC\r\n(Respondent) for a commercial construction, demolition waste and land-clearing\r\ndebris (C&D) landfill (the Landfill). We reverse and reinstate the ALC's final\r\norder.                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      In February 2006, Respondent submitted a request to DHEC for a\r\ndemonstration of need (DON) to obtain a solid waste management permit to\r\nconstruct and operate the Landfill in Laurens County, South Carolina.1 DHEC\r\napproved Respondent's DON request for the Landfill on March 3, 2006, stating\r\nthat DHEC had \"evaluated the information and determined that pursuant to the\r\nprovisions of [the DON Regulation], there is a need for this type of facility in the\r\ncorresponding planning area.\"\r\n\r\n      DHEC issued a draft permit for the Landfill on February 14, 2008, and\r\npublished public notice of the draft permit.2 DHEC received comments and letters\r\n\r\n1 This request was made pursuant to section 44-96-290(E) of the South Carolina\r\nSolid Waste Policy and Management Act of 1991 (the Act), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 44-\r\n96-10 to -470, and the regulation promulgated to implement section 44-96-290(E),\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17 (Supp. 2008) (DON Regulation). The DON\r\nRegulation requires an applicant for any new or expanded commercial C&D\r\nlandfill to submit a DON request prior to submitting a permit application to DHEC.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17(D). DON approval may be terminated if\r\nDHEC subsequently denies the permit application, or the applicant fails to show\r\nevidence of diligent pursuit of the permit or any related necessary approval within\r\n120 days of the DON request. Id. at Â§ 61-107.17(C).\r\n2Regulation 61-107.19 sets forth the permit application process. S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. Â§ 61-107.19(D). That regulation requires DHEC to publish notice in a\r\nnewspaper of general circulation when a draft determination for any new or\r\nexpanded landfill is ready for review. Id. Â§ 61-107.19(D)(2)(b). The public then\r\nhas a 30-day period to review the draft determination and submit comments to\r\nDHEC. Id. DHEC conducts a public hearing upon receipt of certain requests in\r\n\nquestioning the need for the Landfill throughout the permitting process, which\r\nDHEC reviewed before issuing the Landfill Permit. In particular, EAGLE\r\n(Petitioner) submitted comments contesting the need for the Landfill. In the\r\ncomments, Petitioner contended that because of the location, capacity, and\r\ncondition of Curry Lake C&D landfillâ€” located less than five miles from the\r\nproposed site of the Landfillâ€”as well as various other landfills in upstate South\r\nCarolina, the Landfill was not needed. Upon request, DHEC held a public hearing\r\nregarding the Landfill Permit on March 13, 2008.\r\n\r\n       According to Kent Coleman, DHEC's Director of the Division of Mining\r\nand Solid Waste Management, DHEC reviewed Petitioner's concerns about the\r\nLandfill, but determined that none warranted its reconsideration of the DON\r\napproval. Therefore, on July 18, 2008, DHEC issued the requested Landfill\r\nPermit. DHEC informed Respondent of the permit approval via a letter, which\r\nstated that DHEC issued the Landfill Permit pursuant to Regulation 61-107.19,\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.19(D). In addition, DHEC issued a memorandum\r\nto \"Concerned Citizens,\" notifying them of the permit approval, and enclosed a\r\nStaff Decision Summary Report, which addressed the comments received at the\r\npublic hearing and during the public comment period.3\r\n\r\n       Petitioner requested a final review conference by the DHEC Board, but the\r\nBoard declined to hold a review conference. Thereafter, Petitioner requested a\r\ncontested case hearing before the ALC, arguing, inter alia, that there was no need\r\nfor the Landfill, and thus, DHEC should not have approved Respondent's DON\r\nrequest. Respondent filed a motion for partial summary judgment on all issues\r\nrelating to the Landfill Permit. Petitioner also filed a motion for summary\r\njudgment and withdrew all grounds for appeal except for issues relating to the\r\nDON for the Landfill.\r\n\r\n     The ALC heard the cross motions for summary judgment and denied both\r\nmotions, ruling that \"a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether any\r\n\r\nwriting. Id. Finally, after the close of the public comment period on the draft\r\ndetermination and the public hearing, DHEC issues a Department Decision. Id. Â§\r\n61-107.19(D)(3).\r\n3 The Staff Decision Summary Report states: \"In reaching its decision on the\r\n[Landfill Permit] application, the Solid Waste Permitting Section reviewed all\r\ninformation submitted in the application, supplemental information submitted, and\r\npublic comments.\"\r\n\n'additional factors' beyond those specifically set forth in [the DON Regulation]\r\nrequired denial of the DON request.\"4 Thus, on July 22, 2009, the ALC conducted\r\na contested case hearing. The sole issue for determination at the hearing was\r\nwhether \"additional factors\" beyond those listed in the DON Regulation required\r\nDHEC to deny the DON request pursuant to subsection (D)(3)(d) of the DON\r\nRegulation. At the hearing, three witnesses testified about the need for an\r\nadditional C&D landfill in Laurens County, and Petitioner introduced exhibits\r\nproviding information about the waste generation and landfill capacity for Laurens,\r\nGreenville, and Spartanburg counties.\r\n\r\n        Coleman testified that, pursuant to the DON Regulation, DHEC plotted the\r\nlocation of the Landfill on a map, counted the number of landfills within a 10-mile\r\nradius, and totaled the waste generated by all three counties within the 10-mile\r\nradius before approving Respondent's DON request in 2006. Coleman also\r\ntestified that the planning area surrounding a proposed landfillâ€”established by the\r\nDON Regulationâ€”is a \"regional concept\" because many of the C&D landfills\r\naccept waste from other counties, but that there is no actual \"regional plan\" for\r\ndealing with C&D waste in Laurens, Greenville, and Spartanburg counties. Under\r\nthe DON Regulation, DHEC only considers waste generated within the 10-mile\r\nradius in making DON determinations, whereas DHEC looks beyond the 10-mile\r\nradius to determine a new landfill's allowable permitted capacity. Further,\r\nColeman testified that in reviewing Respondent's application, DHEC was aware of\r\nthe permitted disposal rate of the landfills in Laurens, Greenville, and Spartanburg\r\ncounties, but did not utilize the information pursuant to the DON Regulation's\r\n\"additional factors\" section in making its ultimate decision. See S.C. Code Ann.\r\nRegs. Â§ 61-107.17(D)(3)(d).\r\n\r\n       The ALC issued a Final Order and Decision, reversing DHEC's decision to\r\nissue the Landfill Permit to Respondent. The ALC made substantial findings of\r\nfact. In particular, the ALC stated that \"[a]n important consideration in addressing\r\nthe need for a landfill is that the planning area established in the DON Regulation\r\nis a regional concept.\" Because many of the C&D landfills in the Landfill planning\r\narea accept waste from other counties, the ALC found that factor \"must also be\r\nconsidered in conjunction with the utilization of those landfills.\" Therefore, the\r\nALC set forth the waste generation and landfill capacity figures for Laurens,\r\n4In addition to setting forth specific criteria in subsections (D)(3)(a)â€“(c), the DON\r\nRegulation states that DHEC \"reserves the right to review additional factors in\r\ndetermining need on a case-by-case basis\" in subsection (D)(3)(d). S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17(D)(3)(d).\r\n\nGreenville, and Spartanburg Counties for fiscal years 2005â€“2007. Based upon the\r\nfindings of fact, the ALC considered the excess regional landfill capacity as an\r\n\"additional factor\" in determining need under the DON Regulation. The ALC\r\nfound that the region already had more landfill capacity than the county or region\r\nneeded, and thus, there was no need for the Landfill. Specifically, the ALC looked\r\nto the existing landfills \"in proximity to the site of the [Landfill],\" and found that\r\nthe \"32.9% utilization of existing capacity simply does not reflect a need for\r\nanother landfill in the area.\" The ALC also noted that even after the closing of a\r\nparticular landfill in Spartanburg County, and factoring in the annual tonnage of\r\nthe Landfill into the existing C&D landfill capacity, \"the use of existing capacity\r\nwould only be 27.38%.\"\r\n\r\n      Respondent appealed the ALC's decision to the court of appeals. In an\r\nunpublished opinion, the court of appeals reversed the ALC's order and reinstated\r\nDHEC's decision \"because [DHEC] acted within its discretion by declining to\r\nconsider additional factors in issuing a [DON] to [Respondent].\" Engaging &\r\nGuarding Laurens Cnty.'s Env't v.

App. filed August 4, 2011).\r\n\r\n       Petitioner appealed, and this Court granted the petition for writ of certiorari\r\nto review the court of appeals' opinion pursuant to Rule 242, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                  ISSUE PRESENTED\r\nI.\t   Whether the court of appeals erred in deferring to DHEC's decision to\r\n      decline to consider \"additional factors\" under the DON Regulation?5\r\n\r\n                               STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       A party who has exhausted all administrative remedies available within an\r\nagency and who is aggrieved by an ALC's final decision in a contested case is\r\nentitled to judicial review. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380 (Supp. 2012). In an appeal\r\n5 In the alternative, Petitioner argues that DHEC's decision to approve the DON\r\nrequest was arbitrary and capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion\r\nbecause DHEC did not, and has not ever, utilized subsection (D)(3)(d) of the DON\r\nRegulation in order to consider \"additional factors.\" Based on our conclusion that\r\nthe ALC properly reversed DHEC's issuance of the Landfill Permit, we need not\r\naddress this argument. See Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\nS.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591 (1999) (holding that the Court need not address\r\nremaining issues when resolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\nfrom a decision by the ALC, the Administrative Procedures Act (APA) provides\r\nthe appropriate standard of review. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(B) (Supp.\r\n2012). This Court will only reverse the decision of an ALC if that decision is:\r\n\r\n      (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\r\n      (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\r\n      (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\r\n      (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n\r\n      (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n          evidence on the whole record; or\r\n\r\n      (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion or\r\n          clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nId. Thus, this Court's review is limited to determining whether the ALC's findings\r\nwere supported by substantial evidence or were controlled by an error of law. Hill\r\nv. S.C. Dep't of Health & Envtl. Control, 389 S.C. 1, 9, 698 S.E.2d 612, 616 (2010)\r\n(citations omitted). The Court may not substitute its judgment for the ALC's\r\njudgment as to the weight of the evidence on questions of fact. S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n1-23-610(B). In determining whether the ALC's decision was supported by\r\nsubstantial evidence, this court need only find that, upon looking at the entire\r\nrecord on appeal, there is evidence from which reasonable minds could reach the\r\nsame conclusion that the ALC reached. Hill, 389 S.C. at 9â€“10, 698 S.E.2d at 617.\r\n\r\n                                   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI.    Regional Excess Landfill Capacity\r\n      Petitioner asserts that the court of appeals erred in reversing the ALC's\r\ndecision concluding that there is no need for the Landfill and in reinstating DHEC's\r\ndecision to issue the permit. We agree.\r\n\r\n      Section 44-96-290(E) of the South Carolina Code provides, in part:\r\n\r\n      No permit to construct a new solid waste management facility or to\r\n      expand an existing solid waste management facility may be issued\r\n\n      until a demonstration of need is approved by the department . . . . The\r\n      department shall promulgate regulations to implement this section . . .\r\n      .\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-96-290(E) (2002).\r\n\r\n       As directed by section 44-96-290(E), DHEC promulgated the DON\r\nRegulation. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17 (Supp. 2008).6 The regulation sets\r\nforth the criteria DHEC should consider to determine the need for a landfill prior to\r\nissuing a DON approval. See id. The regulation states that a 10-mile \"planning\r\narea\" radius7 around the proposed facility should be used to determine the need for\r\na C&D landfill. Id. The regulation specifies that DHEC will consider the\r\nfollowing criteria:\r\n\r\n      a. \tWhere there are at least two (2) commercial disposal facilities\r\n          under separate ownership within the planning area that meet the\r\n          disposal needs for the area, e.g., that accept special waste and, if\r\n          applicable, are capable of handling additional tonnage, no new\r\n          disposal facility will be allowed. Disposal facilities that accept\r\n          only waste generated in the county or region in which the disposal\r\n          facility is located will not be considered in determining need.\r\n\r\n      b. \tEach disposal facility in the planning area will be allowed up to a\r\n          maximum yearly disposal rate equal to the total amount of solid\r\n          waste destined for disposal that is generated in the county or\r\n          counties that fall, either all inclusive or a portion thereof, within\r\n          the planning area. Disposal rates for existing facilities shall not be\r\n          reduced pursuant to this provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6The DON Regulation was implemented in 2000 and was amended effective June\r\n26, 2009. Both DHEC and the ALC utilized the 2000 version in reviewing the\r\napplication for the Landfill. As such, we will consider the original version of the\r\nDON Regulation in our analysis.\r\n7The amended version of the regulation requires a 20-mile \"planning area\" radius.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Regs. 61-107.17(C)(3) (Supp. 2012). Coleman testified that if the\r\namended version's 20-mile radius had applied to determine the need for the\r\nLandfill, DHEC would have denied the Landfill Permit.\r\n\n      c. \tIn determining the amount of solid waste destined for disposal,\r\n          [DHEC] will use figures in the current Solid Waste Annual Report\r\n          for the proposed waste streams, e.g., the generation rate for a\r\n          [C&D landfill] will be determined by adding the amounts of\r\n          construction and debris [] destined for disposal in permitted [C&D\r\n          landfills] in the counties that fall within the planning area.\r\n\r\n      d. [DHEC] reserves the right to review additional factors in \n\r\n          determining need on a case-by-case basis. \n\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       It is undisputed that the Landfill satisfied the requirements of subsections\r\n(a), (b), and (c) of the DON Regulation. However, Petitioner asserts that DHEC\r\nshould have also utilized subsection (d) in analyzing the need for the Landfill and\r\nconsidered additional factors. Petitioner contends that DHEC should have\r\nconsidered the existing permitted disposal capacity in the counties that were a part\r\nof the Landfill's planning area as an additional factor, and thus, the ALC was\r\ncorrect in applying an \"additional factor\" under subsection (d).\r\n\r\n       Our state's constitution provides that \"[n]o person shall be finally bound by a\r\njudicial or quasi-judicial decision of an administrative agency affecting private\r\nrights except on due notice and an opportunity to be heard . . . and he shall have in\r\nall such instances the right to judicial review.\" S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 22. To that\r\nend, the ALC conducts a de novo hearing in contested cases, complete with the\r\npresentation of evidence and testimony. Hill, 389 S.C. at 9, 698 S.E.2d at 616;\r\nBrown v. S.C. Dept. of Health & Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 512, 560 S.E.2d\r\n410, 413 (2002). In contested permitting cases, the ALC presides as the fact-\r\nfinder. Brown, 348 S.C. at 512, 560 S.E.2d at 413 (citation omitted). According to\r\nthe APA, an ALC's \"final decision shall include findings of fact and conclusions of\r\nlaw, separately stated.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-350 (2005) (emphasis added).\r\nConsequently, the ALC is authorized to make a final determinationâ€”after a final\r\nagency decision and subject to judicial reviewâ€”as to whether an administrative\r\nagency should have granted or denied a particular permit. See Brown, 348 S.C. at\r\n512â€“16, 560 S.E.2d at 413â€“15. As to factual issues, judicial review of\r\nadministrative agency orders is limited to a determination whether the order is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence. MRI at Belfair, L.L.C. v. S.C. Dep't of Health\r\n& Envtl. Control, 379 S.C. 1, 6, 664 S.E.2d 471, 474 (2008).\r\n\n       Because an ALC is not bound to an agency's factual findings or permitting\r\ndecision, the ALC in this case was not bound to DHEC's decision issuing the\r\nLandfill Permit, in which DHEC declined to consider the excess regional capacity\r\nas an \"additional factor\" in determining need. See Hill, 389 S.C. at 9, 698 S.E.2d\r\nat 616; Brown, S.C. at 512, 560 S.E.2d at 413. For that reason, the ALC in this\r\ncase conducted a full contested hearing, de novo, and made its own findings of\r\nfact. We hold that those findings of fact are supported by substantial evidence.\r\nUpon finding that the facts warranted the application of the \"additional factor\"\r\nbecause the C&D landfills in the Landfill planning area accept waste from other\r\ncounties, the ALCâ€”unlike DHECâ€”applied an \"additional factor\" based on those\r\nfactual findings. S.C. Code Ann. Regs. Â§ 61-107.17(D)(3)(d) (permitting the\r\napplication of \"additional factors in determining need on a case-by-case basis\").\r\n\r\n       We find that the ALC, as the fact finder and the final agency decision maker\r\nwas authorized to apply regional excess capacity as an \"additional factor\" in\r\ndenying the Landfill Permit, regardless of the fact that DHEC declined to utilize\r\nthe \"additional factors\" section of the DON Regulation. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-\r\n23-610(B) (\"The Court may not substitute its judgment for the ALC's judgment as\r\nto the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\"). Accordingly, we disagree\r\nwith the court of appeals' deference to DHEC's decision to decline to apply the\r\n\"additional factors\" section and hold that the ALC committed no error of law in\r\nreversing DHEC's decision.8 Thus, we find that the ALC properly considered the\r\nregional excess landfill capacity by making a conclusion of law based upon the\r\nALC's own findings of fact, and as a result, the ALC was not required to defer to\r\nDHEC's decision.\r\n\r\n        Respondent argues that regional excess landfill capacity is not an\r\nappropriate \"additional factor\" for consideration under the DON Regulation. We\r\ndisagree, and find that the ALC was permitted to consider regional excess landfill\r\ncapacity as an additional factor because it was a matter at issue that had been\r\nlitigated from the time the Landfill Permit was first contested. We emphasize that\r\nin this case, the ALC did not conceive a new factor, nor did it consider evidence\r\noutside of the existing record. Instead, in determining the Landfill was not needed,\r\nthe ALC considered and utilized in its decision a factor that was discussed during\r\nthe public comment period and tried at the ALC hearing. We conclude that the\r\nALC's application of regional excess landfill capacity as an \"additional factor\"\r\n8 We note that, likewise, in its opinion, the court of appeals pointed to no error of\r\nlaw on the part of the ALC, as required by section 1-23-610(B) to reverse an\r\nALC's decision.\r\n\nunder the DON Regulation was supported by substantial evidence. See Hill, 389\r\nS.C. at 9, 698 S.E.2d at 616. Therefore, the ALC did not exceed its authority in\r\nreversing DHEC's decision.        CONCLUSION\r\n     For the foregoing reasons, we reverse the court of appeals and reinstate the\r\nALC's order denying the Landfill Permit.\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Estate of\r\nRider, 394 S.C. 84, 713 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. App. 2011), which applied the\r\ncommon law of agency to hold that certain financial assets were part of the\r\ndecedent's probate estate. The decedent had directed his bank to transfer\r\nspecified assets in his investment account to a new account for his spouse,\r\nbut died before all of the assets were credited to her account. At issue in this\r\ncase of first impression is whether South Carolina's Uniform Commercial\r\nCode (\"UCC\") or the common law of agency controls the transfer. We\r\nreverse.                             I. FACTS\r\n\r\n       Charles Galen Rider (\"Husband\") executed an Investment Agency\r\nAgreement / Discretionary Account (\"Account Agreement\") with First Union\r\nNational Bank of North Carolina (\"First Union\"), a predecessor of Wachovia Bank,\r\nN.A. (\"Wachovia\"), on September 27, 1993. The Account Agreement authorized\r\nFirst Union \"to open and maintain an Agency Account\" for Husband and \"to hold\r\ntherein, as [his] Agent, all cash, stocks, bonds, securities and other property . . .\r\nsubject to\" Husband's current and future written instructions. The Account\r\nAgreement stated First Union was \"to provide investment review and management\r\nof the Account, taking such action as [the bank], in [its] discretion, deem[s] best . .\r\n. as though [the bank] were the owner of such property.\" This discretionary\r\nauthority permitted First Union to buy, sell, and exercise certain rights regarding\r\nthe securities in accordance with the overall investment objective selected by\r\nHusband. The terms of the Account Agreement called for its termination upon the\r\n\nbank acquiring actual knowledge of Husband's death, but that Husband's death\r\n\"shall not affect the validity of any prior actions.\"\r\n\r\n        On June 8, 2005, Husband called Ruth DiLella in the Capital Management\r\nGroup of what was then Wachovia1 and informed her that he had met with his\r\nestate attorney, who had advised him to transfer some assets to his spouse, Carolyn\r\nS. Rider (\"Wife\"). Husband was suffering from terminal cancer and reportedly\r\nwanted Wife to have sufficient funds to maintain her standard of living during the\r\ninevitable time that probate would be going on. Husband instructed DiLella to\r\nmove $2 million in securities from his account at Wachovia and place them in a\r\nnew account in Wife's name. DiLella told Husband that Wachovia would send him\r\na list of specific securities to transfer, along with a signature page for him to sign to\r\napprove the transfer. The same day, DiLella e-mailed a list of assets totaling $2\r\nmillion to Wachovia's trust department, along with Husband's instruction, so it\r\ncould prepare a letter and asset listing for the client's approval.\r\n\r\n      On June 17, 2005, Husband signed the letter and returned it to the attention\r\nof Wachovia's trust administrator. The letter provided: \"Please accept this letter as\r\nmy authority and direction to transfer the assets listed on the following page to a\r\nnew agency account to be opened for my wife, Carolyn Sue Rider.\" A total of $2\r\nmillion in assets were listed, which included specific securities and a small sum of\r\ncash.  In response, Wachovia made a series of four transfers from June to October\r\n2005. On June 21, 2005, four days after Husband's signing of the June 17th\r\ndirective, Wachovia made the first transfer of $733,228.00 in securities (stocks) to\r\nWife's account. On July 8, 2005, Wachovia transferred $39,672.00 in securities\r\n(stocks). That afternoon, Husband passed away in Charlotte, North Carolina, and\r\nHusband's daughter, respondent Deborah Rider McClure, notified Wachovia the\r\nsame day. The next business day, Monday, July 11, 2005, Wachovia transferred\r\n$935,032.64 in securities (mutual funds) to Wife's account, and on October 20,\r\n2005, Wachovia made a fourth and final transfer of $304,182.46 in securities\r\n(mutual funds). The total amount transferred to Wife's account was $2,012,115.00,\r\nthe excess being due to the appreciation in the value of the securities.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1First Union merged into Wachovia, which was then subsequently acquired by\r\nWells Fargo.\r\n\n       In 2006, Thomas M. Grady, as personal representative of Husband's estate\r\n(\"PR\"), instituted this declaratory judgment action in the probate court for Beaufort\r\nCounty asking the court to determine either (1) that the securities transferred\r\npursuant to Husband's June 17, 2005 letter to Wachovia were completed transfers\r\non June 17, 2005 and, thus, were not includible in Husband's probate estate; or (2)\r\nthat the securities transferred after Husband's death on July 8, 2005 were\r\nincomplete transfers and were includible in Husband's probate estate. The PR did\r\nnot take a position, but sought guidance as to whether the UCC or the law of\r\nagency under the South Carolina common law controlled the outcome.\r\n\r\n       In its order, the probate court stated much of the argument in this case\r\ncentered on whether the UCC's provision on Investment Securities applies to the\r\nsecurities transfer directed by Husband on June 17, 2005. The probate court stated\r\nWife argued the UCC applies, Husband's June 17, 2005 directive was an\r\n\"entitlement order\" under the applicable definition in the UCC found in S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 36-8-102, the transfer was effectuated on June 17, 2005, and it was\r\nunaffected by Husband's death before completion of the transfers. In contrast,\r\nHusband's two daughters from his prior marriage, Deborah Rider McClure and\r\nGinger C. McClure, and his two grandsons, Christian McClure and Austin\r\nMcClure (collectively, \"the McClure Respondents\") argued, inter alia, that the\r\nUCC did not apply and, even if it did, it did not supplant the law of agency that\r\ngoverned the parties' Account Agreement. Either way, Wachovia's authority to\r\nmake the transfers ended when it acquired actual knowledge of Husband's death\r\nand the disputed assets belonged to Husband's probate estate.\r\n\r\n       The probate court found the UCC controlled this securities transaction, that\r\nHusband's June 17, 2005 directive was an \"entitlement order,\" and Wachovia was a\r\n\"securities intermediary.\" However, it determined an entitlement order's \"effective\r\ndate\" is a distinguishable concept from when an entitlement order is \"effectuated.\"\r\nThe probate court agreed with Wife that Husband's entitlement order was\r\n\"effective\" upon its issuance to Wachovia on June 17, 2005, but reasoned it still\r\nhad to be carried out by Wachovia, the securities intermediary, to be \"effectuated,\"\r\nand the UCC did not supplant the laws of property or agency, nor did it vitiate the\r\nterms of the Account Agreement.\r\n\r\n      The probate court noted Wachovia received actual notice of Husband's death\r\non Friday, July 8th, that the second transfer of $39,672.00 was posted to Wife's\r\naccount that day, and that the third transfer of $935,032.64 was posted to Wife's\r\naccount the next business day, Monday, July 11th. The court stated the credible\r\n\ntestimony at trial persuaded it that Wachovia took the necessary actions to\r\neffectuate the second and third transfers before it knew of Husband's death. The\r\ncourt observed, \"In the commercial context of the transactions, it would be\r\nunreasonable to conclude otherwise.\"2\r\n\r\n       The probate court concluded the first three transfers, totaling $1,707,932.64,\r\nwhich were posted to Wife's account on June 21, July 8, and July 11, 2005,\r\nrespectively, were carried out and effectuated before Husband's death and are not\r\npart of his probate estate. However, the securities posted to Wife's account on\r\nOctober 20, 2005 in the amount of $304,082.46 belonged to Husband's probate\r\nestate because it was not effectuated until after Husband's death, when Wachovia's\r\nauthority to act had already terminated.\r\n\r\n       Wife appealed to the circuit court, which affirmed in an order adopting the\r\nprobate court's factual findings and legal conclusions. Wife appealed to the Court\r\nof Appeals, which found both the third and fourth transfers properly belonged to\r\nHusband's probate estate because they occurred after the bank had actual\r\nknowledge of Husband's death, but that no error was preserved regarding the third\r\ntransfer because the McClure Respondents did not cross-appeal, so it too affirmed.\r\nRider v. Estate of Rider, 394 S.C. 84, 713 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. App. 2011). The Court\r\nof Appeals also distinguished the \"effective date\" of Husband's entitlement order\r\nfrom the date it was \"effectuated\" and found the latter determinative of the\r\nquestion of ownership. This Court granted Wife's petition for a writ of certiorari to\r\nreview the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"An appellate court's determination of the standard of review for matters\r\noriginating in the probate court is controlled by whether the cause of action is at\r\nlaw or in equity.\" Holcombe-Burdette v. Bank of Am., 371 S.C. 648, 654, 640\r\nS.E.2d 480, 483 (Ct. App. 2006). This case began as an action for a declaratory\r\njudgment in the probate court, which can be legal or equitable. See Estate of Gill\r\nex rel. Grant v. Clemson Univ. Found., 397 S.C. 419, 425, 725 S.E.2d 516, 519-20\r\n(Ct.

LAW/ANALAYSIS\r\n       Wife contends the UCC addresses the subject matter at issue in this appeal,\r\narguing only where the UCC is incomplete does the common law provide the\r\napplicable rule. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-1-103 (2003) (\"Unless displaced by the\r\nparticular provisions of this act [Title 36, the UCC], the principles of law and\r\nequity, including . . . the law relative to capacity to contract, principal and agent,\r\nestoppel, fraud, . . . or other validating or invalidating cause shall supplement its\r\nprovisions.\"); Hitachi Elec.

Code\r\nAnn. Â§ 36-8-101 (2003). It is based on the state's adoption of the revised Article 8\r\ncontained in the model Uniform Commercial Code prepared by the American Law\r\nInstitute in collaboration with the National Conference of Commissioners on\r\nUniform State Laws. Its primary purposes are to provide uniformity in the\r\nsecurities industry and to provide an accurate description of the realities of the\r\nsecurities markets, and secondarily to enhance the value-adding factors of liquidity\r\nand certainty in securities transactions. S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 36-8-101 to -511 cmt.\r\nat 82 (2003 & Supp. 2013) (S.C. Reporter's Introductory Comment to the 2000\r\nRevision). Part 5 of Chapter 8, entitled \"Security Entitlements,\" specifically\r\ngoverns the \"indirect holding system,\" whereby purchasers of securities deal with\r\n\nintermediaries who hold securities for others, as compared to the traditional system\r\nwhereby purchasers deal directly with the issuers of those securities. See cmt. at\r\n83. It is noted in the Introductory Comment that these provisions \"supplant a\r\npastiche of common law rules and agreed practices.\" Id.\r\n\r\n        In the current matter, Wachovia held certain financial assets (securities) for\r\nHusband and managed those assets, subject to his oversight, pursuant to the\r\nAccount Agreement, by which the bank acted as Husband's agent. This\r\nrelationship thus implicates the indirect holding system set forth in Part 5 as well\r\nas general UCC provisions. Under the terms of the UCC, Husband was an\r\n\"entitlement holder\" with a \"security entitlement\" to the \"financial assets\" in a\r\n\"securities account\" maintained and managed by Wachovia for Husband's benefit\r\nin its capacity as a \"securities intermediary.\" These and related terms are\r\nstatutorily defined.\r\n\r\n      A \"financial asset\" includes \"a security\" or a share or other interest in\r\nproperty \"which is, or is of a type, dealt in or traded on financial markets[.]\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(9) (2003). A \"securities account\" is \"an account to\r\nwhich a financial asset is or may be credited in accordance with an agreement\r\nunder which the person maintaining the account undertakes to treat the person for\r\nwhom the account is maintained as entitled to exercise the rights that comprise the\r\nfinancial asset.\" Id. Â§ 36-8-501(a).\r\n\r\n         Wachovia is a \"securities intermediary,\" which is defined to include \"a bank\r\n. . . that in the ordinary course of its business maintains securities accounts for\r\nothers and is acting in that capacity.\" Id. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(14)(ii).\r\n\r\n       Husband was the \"entitlement holder,\" which the UCC defines as follows:\r\n\"A person identified in the records of a security intermediary as the person having\r\na security entitlement against the securities intermediary. If a person acquires a\r\nsecurity entitlement by virtue of Section 36-8-501(b)(2) or (3), that person is the\r\nentitlement holder.\" Id. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(7).\r\n\r\n       A \"security entitlement\" consists of \"the rights and property interest of an\r\nentitlement holder with respect to a financial asset specified in Part 5 [of Title 36].\"\r\nId. Â§ 36-8-102(a)(17). Section 36-8-501(b) of the UCC provides a person\r\ngenerally acquires a security entitlement if a securities intermediary does any of\r\nthe following three things: \"(1) indicates by book entry that a financial asset has\r\nbeen credited to the person's securities account; (2) receives a financial asset from\r\nthe person or acquires a financial asset for the person and, in either case, accepts it\r\nfor credit to the person's securities account; or (3) becomes obligated under other\r\n\nlaw, regulation, or rule to credit a financial asset to the person's securities account.\"\r\nId. Â§ 36-8-501(b).\r\n\r\n      Husband, as the entitlement holder, retained the right to direct Wachovia to\r\nmake changes in his account by issuing an \"entitlement order,\" i.e., \"a notification\r\ncommunicated to a securities intermediary directing transfer or redemption of a\r\nfinancial asset to which the entitlement holder has a security entitlement.\" Id.\r\nÂ§ 36-8-102(a)(8).\r\n\r\n       Wachovia was statutorily required to respond to an appropriate entitlement\r\norder. See id. Â§ 36-8-506 (\"A securities intermediary shall exercise rights with\r\nrespect to a financial asset if directed to do so by an entitlement holder.\"); id. Â§ 36-\r\n8-507(a) (\"A securities intermediary shall comply with an entitlement order if\r\n[1] the entitlement order is originated by the appropriate person, [2] the securities\r\nintermediary has had reasonable opportunity to assure itself that the entitlement\r\norder is genuine and authorized, and [3] the securities intermediary has had\r\nreasonable opportunity to comply with the entitlement order.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       An \"appropriate person\" with respect to an entitlement order is the\r\nentitlement holder. Id. Â§ 36-8-107(a)(3). However, if the person \"is deceased, the\r\ndesignated person's successor taking under other law or the designated person's\r\npersonal representative acting for the estate of the decedent\" is an appropriate\r\nperson to initiate an entitlement order. Id. Â§ 36-8-107(a)(4).\r\n\r\n        The UCC further provides that \"[e]ffectiveness of an . . . entitlement order is\r\ndetermined as of the date the . . . entitlement order is made, and an . . . entitlement\r\norder does not become ineffective by reason of any later change in circumstances.\"\r\nId. Â§ 36-8-107(e) (emphasis added). Subsection (e) clarifies the protection from\r\nliability of securities intermediaries who rely on appropriate persons, and \"[t]his\r\nprotection reflects the policy of revised Article 8 to enhance liquidity and finality\r\nin securities transactions.\" Id. Â§ 36-8-107 cmt. at 143 (S.C. Reporter's Comment to\r\n2000 Revision).\r\n\r\n       In the Court of Appeals, the court first reviewed the terms of the Account\r\nAgreement and found the \"prior actions\" clause therein refers to both Husband's\r\nand Wachovia's conduct and that the plain language of the agreement showed\r\nWachovia's authority ended upon actual knowledge of Husband's death. Rider v.\r\nEstate of Rider, 394 S.C. 84, 91, 713 S.E.2d 643, 646-47 (Ct. App. 2011). The\r\ncourt stated the determination whether the securities in the fourth transfer were part\r\nof Husband's estate was, therefore, determined by whether Husband's and\r\n\nWachovia's conduct was sufficient to complete the transfers before Wachovia\r\nlearned of Husband's death. Id. at 91, 713 S.E.2d at 647.\r\n\r\n       Wife argued the general agency rule that an agent lacks authority to act for a\r\nprincipal after a principal's death, relied upon by the McClure Respondents, does\r\nnot apply to this situation because Husband's June 17, 2005 directive was an\r\neffective entitlement order under Article 8 of the UCC. Id. Wife contended (1) an\r\neffective entitlement order transfers the right to financial assets the date it is made\r\nand, (2) even if it does not, an entitlement order remains effective pursuant to the\r\nUCC provision above, which displaces the agency rule under the common law, so\r\nthat actions taken to comply with the entitlement order may be completed\r\nregardless of later changes in circumstances. Id. at 91-92, 713 S.E.2d at 647.\r\n\r\n       The Court of Appeals rejected both of Wife's contentions and determined\r\n\"the probate court properly found the [securities in] the fourth transfer are part of\r\n[Husband's] estate.\" Id. at 93, 713 S.E.2d at 648. In reaching this conclusion, the\r\nCourt of Appeals stated the UCC applied, but nevertheless found the UCC's rule as\r\nto the effective date of an entitlement order contained in section 36-8-107(e) of the\r\nUCC did not fully address the subject, so it did not displace the relevant agency\r\nrule. Id. at 93-95, 713 S.E.2d at 648-49.\r\n\r\n       Applying the common law of agency, the Court of Appeals reasoned that an\r\nentitlement order does not complete a transfer of financial assets at the time it is\r\nmade, so like other orders to agents, it is an instruction to act in the manner the\r\nprincipal desires, and the request is terminated by the principal's death, citing\r\nCarver v. Morrow, 213 S.C. 199, 204, 48 S.E.2d 814, 817 (1948) (stating as a\r\ngeneral rule, an \"agency terminates upon the death of the principal\") and C.J.S.\r\nAgency Â§ 122 (2003) (\"The fact that the agent has performed, as authorized, one or\r\nseveral acts of that which was contemplated as a single transaction does not\r\noperate to preserve or keep alive the power until the completion of the\r\ntransaction.\"). Id. at 93-94, 713 S.E.2d at 648.\r\n\r\n       The court distinguished the effective date of the entitlement order from the\r\ndate it was completed by Wachovia, which it defined as when the assets were\r\ncredited to Wife's account, and it found the fourth transfer at issue was completed\r\nby Wachovia in October 2005, citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-501(b)(1) (providing\r\na book entry by the securities intermediary to a person's account establishes a\r\n\nsecurity entitlement).3 Id. at 94, 713 S.E.2d at 648. As a result, the court held the\r\nsecurities in the fourth transfer, having been credited after the bank's knowledge of\r\nHusband's death, are properly part of Husband's probate estate because the bank's\r\nauthority under the Account Agreement had ended. Id. at 96, 713 S.E.2d at 649.\r\n\r\n       Several jurisdictions have observed there is a dearth of authority addressing\r\nthe unique problems arising under Article 8 of the UCC. See, e.g., Meadow Homes\r\nDev. Corp. v. Bowens, 211 P.3d 743, 745 (Colo. App. 2009) (stating the \"appeal\r\nraises issues of first impression under Revised UCC Article 8 (Investment\r\nSecurities)\" that had not previously been considered in the jurisdiction and that\r\n\"have received surprisingly little attention elsewhere\"); Watson v. Sears, 766\r\nN.E.2d 784, 788 (Ind. Ct. App. 2002) (\"Unfortunately, there is no discernible case\r\nlaw anywhere under revised Article 8 of the U.C.C. (Title 8 in Maryland) â€”and\r\nvery little commentaryâ€”dealing with the question of the effect of an entitlement\r\norder that is authorized by only one of the entitlement holders on a joint account.\").\r\n\r\n      As one legal commentator has opined, a significant body of case law has not\r\ndeveloped for the indirect holding system, and the reported cases generally have\r\napplied whatever principles were necessary to protect an innocent investor, so they\r\ndid not create well-reasoned legal doctrines to resolve the competing policies\r\nunique to the indirect holding system. Russell A. Hakes, UCC Article 8: Will the\r\nIndirect Holding of Securities Survive the Light of Day?, 35 Loy. L.A. L. Rev. 661,\r\n678 (2002). \"The drafters [of UCC Article 8] had the benefit of effectively starting\r\nwith a clean slate.\" Id. \"Troubling precedents could be overruled by the adoption\r\nof contrary concepts that matched the perceptions of those most familiar with the\r\noperation of the system--securities professionals.\" Id. \"The interest and\r\nexperience of securities professionals were essential to an Article 8 that could\r\nsuccessfully govern the indirect holding system.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"The securities industry did not want to use principles of bailment, agency,\r\nor trust law to describe the basic operations of the indirect holding system, even\r\nthough agency law governs much in the relationship between the securities\r\nindustry and its customers.\" Id. at 678-79. \"One important goal in revising Article\r\n\r\n3 The Court of Appeals held no issue was preserved as to the third transfer as the\r\nMcClure Respondents did not cross-appeal. Rider, 394 S.C. at 93, 713 S.E.2d at\r\n647. We agree. It further held Wife did not preserve the issue of whether the\r\ntransfers were completed or incomplete gifts. Id. at 96-97, 713 S.E.2d at 649-50.\r\nWe need not reach the latter question as we decide the case on other grounds.\r\n\n8 was to simplify transfer rules for the indirect holding system.\" Id. at 679.\r\nMoreover, \"[t]he drafters also caution courts not to use 'mechanical jurisprudence'\r\nbut to interpret the definitions based upon the suitability of applying Article 8's\r\nsubstantive rules.\" Id. at 681 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       We agree with the Court of Appeals that the UCC does not invalidate all\r\ngeneral principles of agency, but, as noted by the commentator above, those\r\nprinciples must be viewed in light of the unique nature of the indirect holding\r\nsystem. The UCC provisions were created to provide a uniform method of\r\nresolving issues in order to promote liquidity and finality, to be supplemented by\r\n(not thwarted by) the rules of agency and other applicable laws. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. Â§Â§ 36-8-101 to -511 cmt. at 82 (2003 & Supp. 2013) (S.C. Reporter's\r\nIntroductory Comment to the 2000 Revision) (observing the provisions in Part 5 of\r\nthe UCC governing Investment Securities \"supplant a pastiche of common law\r\nrules and agreed practices\"); see also Psak, Graziano, Piasecki & Whitelaw v.\r\nFleet Nat'l Bank, 915 A.2d 42, 45 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2007) (\"Indeed, the\r\nUCC displaces the common-law where reliance on the common law would thwart\r\nthe purposes of the UCC.\" (citing Sebastian v. D & S Express, Inc., 61 F. Supp. 2d\r\n386, 391 (D. N.J. 1999)).\r\n\r\n       In relying upon agency law to mandate that both Husband's execution of the\r\nentitlement order and full compliance by the securities intermediary exist prior to\r\nHusband's death, the Court of Appeals has created an additional requirement that\r\ndoes not exist under the UCC and that thwarts the purpose of the language in\r\nsection 36-8-107(e) establishing a uniform effective date for entitlement orders,\r\nregardless of subsequent events. Moreover, it also overlooks the fact that under\r\nUCC section 36-8-501(b), the making of a \"book entry\" is but one of several\r\nmeans by which Wife can acquire an interest in the securities.\r\n\r\n       Once Husband issued the entitlement order and was the appropriate person,\r\nWachovia was obligated by the UCC and the parties' Account Agreement to obey\r\nhis directive. Wachovia had set up a new investment account in Wife's name and\r\ncommenced the transfer of securities within a few days of Husband's request, so at\r\nthat point, Wife already had a recognizable interest, even though Wachovia had not\r\nposted all of the securities to her account. The Court of Appeals, in focusing solely\r\non the date of the \"book entry,\" which it took to mean the date the securities were\r\ncredited or posted to Wife's account, seemed to view this as the exclusive means\r\nfor obtaining an interest in the securities. However, a security entitlement is\r\ncreated if a securities intermediary does any of the following three things:\r\n\n             (1) indicates by book entry that a financial asset has been\r\n      credited to the person's securities account;\r\n\r\n            (2) receives a financial asset from the person or acquires a\r\n      financial asset for the person and, in either case, accepts it for credit to\r\n      the person's securities account; or\r\n\r\n             (3) becomes obligated under other law, regulation, or rule to\r\n      credit a financial asset to the person's securities account.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-8-501(b).\r\n\r\n       In this case, while the Court of Appeals relied on book entry under\r\nsubsection (b)(1), we agree with Wife that under subsection (b)(3), Wachovia had\r\na legal obligation to credit the securities to Wife's account.4 As noted in the\r\nOfficial Comment to Â§ 8-501 of the Uniform Act:\r\n\r\n              Paragraph (3) of subsection (b) sets out a residual test, to avoid\r\n      any implication that the failure of an intermediary to make the\r\n      appropriate entries to credit a position to a customer's securities\r\n      account would prevent the customer from acquiring the rights of an\r\n      entitlement holder under Part 5. As is the case with the paragraph (2)\r\n      test, the paragraph (3) test would not be needed for the ordinary cases,\r\n      since they are covered by paragraph (1).\r\n\r\nUnif. Commercial Code, Official Comment to Â§ 8-501, 2C U.L.A. 579, 581 (2005)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Wachovia's failure to more quickly make the last posting to Wife's account\r\nclearly is not the ordinary case, and it falls squarely within the parameters of the\r\nresidual provision in section 36-8-501(b)(3). Although the Court of Appeals treats\r\nthe transfers as separate, unrelated events subject to termination under general\r\nagency law, we conclude Husband's execution of an entitlement order directing\r\nWachovia to transfer certain specified securities to Wife is a singular act that falls\r\nsquarely within the \"prior act\" language of the parties' agreement. Further,\r\n\r\n4 At oral argument, the parties agreed the UCC does not define the term \"book\r\nentry,\" so the drafters intended it to have a broad meaning. In addition, although\r\nnot necessary to our disposition, we believe the transfer in this case also falls\r\nwithin the ambits of subsection (b)(2), as Wachovia received and accepted\r\nfinancial assets for credit to Wife's securities account.\r\n\nWachovia's obligation to comply with Husband's entitlement order is supported by\r\nthe UCC provisions examined above and comports with Article 8's goals of\r\nliquidity and finality in securities transactions. Consequently, we hold the disputed\r\nassets in this case properly belong to Wife and are not includible in Husband's\r\nprobate estate.                IV.

We granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision\r\nand reverse.    FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n       During the afternoon or early evening of Saturday, March 2, 2002, the\r\nvictim stopped at a gas station in Denmark, South Carolina and when she went to\r\nleave, her car would not start. A man agreed to help her and ultimately replaced a\r\npart in her car. Because she did not have money on her person with which to repay\r\nhim, she had him follow her home. There, according to Victim, he blindfolded her\r\nand drove her to his home where over the course of the night he sexually assaulted\r\nher. The following morning around 5:00 a.m. he blindfolded her again and drove\r\nher back to her home.\r\n\r\n        Law enforcement obtained a video surveillance tape from the gas station and\r\nVictim identified her assailant on the video. Officers returned to the gas station\r\nwhere an employee identified the assailant as the petitioner, Joseph Walker.\r\nWalker was detained and interviewed by law enforcement in a videotaped\r\ninterrogation. He admitted going to the gas station on March 2 but denied\r\nproviding assistance to anyone there with car trouble. He also denied any\r\nknowledge of the crime or Victim. He stated that after leaving the BP station, he\r\nspent the afternoon and evening at a friend's home and then returned to his\r\ngirlfriend's, Robina Reed's, home around 9:30 or 10:00 p.m. for the remainder of\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\n       Walker was arrested, charged, and tried for the crimes. The jury found him\r\nguilty of criminal sexual conduct in the first degree and kidnapping, and the court\r\nsentenced him to 24 years' imprisonment on each charge to be served concurrently.\r\n\r\n       Walker subsequently petitioned for PCR, alleging his trial counsel was\r\nineffective in failing to conduct an adequate investigation. At the hearing,\r\nWalker's trial counsel acknowledged that she viewed the videotaped interview of\r\nWalker. She also admitted her notes contained the name \"Robina Reed\" as a\r\nperson to interview but that she never interviewed Reed. She testified that her\r\ninvestigator spoke with or tried to speak with Reed, but she never followed up with\r\nher investigator.\r\n\n       Reed testified at the hearing that she was never contacted about Walker's\r\ncase until she heard from his PCR counsel. She stated that in March of 2002, she\r\nwas in a romantic relationship with Walker, but he disappeared near the end of that\r\nmonth when, as she later discovered when contacted about Walker's PCR action,\r\nhe was arrested. While she vacillated in her testimony and was unable to provide\r\ndetails about specific days and times she was with Walker, she was ultimately\r\nasked: \"Prior to the last time that [you] saw Mr. Walker did y'all spend every\r\nweekend together?\" and she responded: \"Yea, we spend [sic] every weekend\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n       The court granted Walker PCR, finding his trial counsel was ineffective in\r\nfailing to interview Reed. The court also found Reed was credible, counsel was\r\ndeficient in failing to interview her as an alibi witness, and Walker was prejudiced\r\nbecause Reed's alibi testimony created the reasonable probability of a different\r\noutcome at trial had she testified.\r\n\r\n       The court of appeals reversed the grant of PCR, holding that while trial\r\ncounsel's failure to interview Reed was deficient performance, it did not prejudice\r\nWalker. Walker v. State, 397 S.C. 226, 235â€“39, 723 S.E.2d 610, 615â€“17 (Ct. App.\r\n2012). In reversing, the court relied on this Court's decision in Glover v. State, 318\r\nS.C. 496, 458 S.E.2d 538 (1995), that a failure to interview an alibi witness is only\r\nprejudicial where the witness's testimony, if true, would actually establish an alibi\r\ndefense by making it physically impossible for the defendant to have committed\r\nthe crime. Id. at 237â€“39, 723 S.E.2d at 616â€“17. The court of appeals concluded\r\nReed's testimony did not establish an alibi because \"it leaves open the possibility\r\nthat Walker is guilty.\" Id. at 239, 723 S.E.2d at 617. Walker petitioned for\r\ncertiorari and this Court granted the petition.\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       \"A convicted defendant's claim that counsel's assistance was so defective as\r\nto require reversal of a conviction . . . has two components.\" Strickland v.\r\nWashington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984). The defendant must first demonstrate that\r\ncounsel was deficient and then must also show the deficiency resulted in prejudice.\r\nId. To satisfy the first prong, a defendant must show counsel's performance \"fell\r\nbelow an objective standard of reasonableness.\" Franklin v. Catoe, 346 S.C. 563,\r\n570â€“71, 552 S.E.2d 718, 722 (2001). \"To prove prejudice, an applicant must show\r\nthere is a reasonable probability that but for counsel's deficient performance, the\r\nresult of the proceeding would have been different.\" Id. at 571, 552 S.E.2d at 723.\r\n\n       The petitioner in a PCR hearing bears the burden of establishing his\r\nentitlement to relief. Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886\r\n(2007). \"This Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is any\r\nevidence of probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the\r\nPCR court when it is controlled by an error of law.\" Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93,\r\n101, 665 S.E.2d 164, 168 (2008). The PCR court's findings on matters of\r\ncredibility are given great deference by this Court. Simuel v. State, 390 S.C. 267,\r\n270, 701 S.E.2d 738, 739 (2010).LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n      Walker contends the court of appeals erred in holding he was not prejudiced\r\nby trial counsel's failure to interview Reed. Because we believe the court of\r\nappeals read Glover too broadly to apply to the alibi testimony here and also failed\r\nto adhere to the limited standard of review which appellate courts have over\r\nfindings of the PCR court, we agree.\r\n\r\n       \"[C]ounsel has a duty to make reasonable investigations or to make a\r\nreasonable decision that makes particular investigations unnecessary.\" Strickland,\r\n466 U.S. at 691. One component of that duty is to investigate alibi witnesses\r\nidentified by a defendant, and the failure to make some effort to contact them to\r\nascertain whether their testimony would aid the defense is unreasonable. Grooms\r\nv. Solem, 923 F.2d 88, 90 (8th Cir. 1991).\r\n\r\n       Here, in reversing the PCR court, the court of appeals relied on this Court's\r\nlanguage in Glover that \"since an alibi derives its potency as a defense from the\r\nfact that it involves the physical impossibility of the accused's guilt, a purported\r\nalibi which leaves it possible for the accused to be the guilty person is no alibi at\r\nall\" and its holding that a PCR petitioner is not prejudiced by his counsel's failure\r\nto interview a potential alibi witness who cannot present testimony that meets the\r\nlegal definition of an alibi. Glover, 318 S.C. at 498, 458 S.E.2d at 540. In Glover,\r\nthe petitioner was convicted of crimes that occurred in Williamsburg County and\r\nsought PCR on the basis his trial counsel failed to contact alibi witnesses who\r\nwould have testified that he was in Florida at 8:00 a.m. on the day the crimes were\r\ncommitted. Id. at 497, 458 S.E.2d at 539. The Court found that because the\r\ncrimes occurred at 8:30 p.m. and the drive between the petitioner's location in\r\nFlorida and Williamsburg County was only approximately six and a half hours, the\r\nfact he was allegedly in Florida that morning did not make it physically impossible\r\nfor him to have committed the crimes. Id. at 498, 318 S.C. at 540. Therefore, the\r\n\nCourt held the alibi witnesses were not sufficient to create an alibi defense and the\r\npetitioner was not prejudiced by his counsel's failure to interview them. Id.\r\n\r\n      The court of appeals found Reed's testimony did not qualify as an alibi\r\nbecause \"her testimony does not account for Walker's whereabouts on March 2,\r\n2002, such that it was physically impossible that he committed the crimes.\"\r\nTherefore, the court concluded that under Glover, Walker could not establish the\r\nprejudice prong. Given our limited scope of review over findings of the PCR\r\ncourt, this was error. Moreover, the court of appeals misapprehended the\r\napplicability of Glover to this case.\r\n\r\n       The PCR court found Reed credible and after a series of questions\r\nconcerning whether she spent the weekend of March 2, 2002, with Walker, she\r\nsettled on a final answer that prior to Walker's arrest, she and Walker spent every\r\nweekend together. That testimony provides evidence supporting the PCR court's\r\nconclusion that Reed offered alibi testimony that reasonably could have resulted in\r\na different outcome at trial. If true and construed as meaning at least that Walker\r\nand Reed spent every night together on the weekends prior to his arrest, it would\r\nbe physically impossible for Walker to have committed the kidnapping and\r\nassaults. In other words, unlike Glover where the testimony of the alibi witnesses\r\ncould have been true and the petitioner still could have committed the crime, it is\r\nnot possible for Reed's testimony to be true and for Walker to have committed the\r\ncrime. While we acknowledge, as did the PCR court, that Reed's testimony was\r\nnot as clear as it could have been, due in part to the passage of five years, one\r\nviable interpretation of it was that Walker spent the night of March 2 with her.\r\nQuestions concerning the weight and believability of Reed's testimony were solely\r\nwithin the province of the PCR court, and through the narrow lens which we must\r\nview its findings, they are clearly supported by the record. Accordingly, we are\r\nconstrained to affirm the PCR court's decision.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We hold the court of appeals erred in finding Walker was not prejudiced by\r\nhis trial counsel's failure to interview Reed as a potential alibi witness.\r\nAccordingly, we reverse the court of appeal's decision and affirm the PCR court's\r\ngrant of relief.1\r\n\r\n1 Because our resolution of this issue is dispositive, we need not reach the other\r\nissues raised by Walker.

The subcontractor, Stevens, contends the contract is a requirements\r\ncontract under which DynCorp must send all aircraft requiring maintenance to\r\nStevens.\r\n\r\n       Stevens moved for a partial summary judgment on the issue, the trial court\r\ngranted the motion, and the court of appeals reversed and granted partial summary\r\njudgment to DynCorp. We reverse the court of appeals' decision in part and affirm\r\nin part, holding the contract is a requirements contract for certain aircraft.\r\n\r\n                FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n      DynCorp is a large defense contractor who was interested in being awarded\r\na contract from the United States Army to service the Army's fleet of C-12, RC-12,\r\nand UC-35 aircraft. In furtherance of the goal of securing the contract, DynCorp\r\nlooked to Stevens as a potential subcontractor.\r\n\r\n      DynCorp and Stevens executed a \"Teaming Agreement\" which set forth how\r\nthe parties would cooperate in attempting to procure the Army contract (the Prime\r\nContract). The Teaming Agreement provides that should DynCorp be awarded the\r\nPrime Contract, it would award a subcontract to Stevens to perform certain work\r\nrequired under the Prime Contract and specifies in detail what work Stevens would\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nA.    THE SUBCONTRACT\r\n\r\n      The Army awarded the Prime Contract to DynCorp, and DynCorp and\r\nStevens subsequently executed a subcontract (the Subcontract). The Subcontract\r\nbegins with a preamble which provides in part:\r\n\r\n      WHEREAS, the parties entered into a Teaming Agreement . . . which\r\n      identifies the roles and responsibilities of the parties as Prime and\r\n      Subcontractor in a cooperative effort to perform the requirements of\r\n      U.S. Army Contract DAH23-00-C-0226 (\"Prime Contract\");\r\n\n      WHEREAS, this Subcontract supersedes all prior written or oral\r\n      agreements between the parties, excluding the Proprietary Data\r\n      Exchange Agreement . . . and constitutes the entire agreement\r\n      between the parties with respect to this Subcontract.\r\n\r\n       The body of the Subcontract begins with a definitional section which defines\r\nthe term \"Aircraft\" as: \"All Army RC/C-12 and UC-35 aircraft covered under the\r\nPrime Contract.\" The Subcontract has a \"Statement of Requirements\" which\r\nprovides that:\r\n\r\n      A. \t [Stevens], as a Subcontractor to DYNCORP, shall provide\r\n           items consisting of management, parts and materials, repairs,\r\n           skilled labor, facilities and engineering data for the maintenance\r\n           and repair of the Government's fleet of C-12/RC-12 Aircraft\r\n           and related support equipment under the Prime Contract as\r\n           specifically set forth in Section B.\r\n\r\n      B. \t   [DynCorp] is not required to purchase from the Subcontractor\r\n             any requirement in excess of the total funding identified under\r\n             Section G under this Subcontract.\r\n\r\n      The Subcontract makes use of \"CLINs\"â€”\"Contract Line Item Number[s]\"\r\nwhich are carried over from the Prime Contractâ€”to describe the work to be\r\nperformed and defines eight CLINs as covered by the Subcontract. The\r\nSubcontract contains a Statement of Work defining the different CLINs in part as:\r\n\r\n      B. \t   C-12/RC-12 STRIP AND PAINT. [Stevens] shall provide all\r\n             labor, services, facilities, equipment, and direct and indirect\r\n             parts and materials required to strip and completely repaint\r\n             aircraft (for other than ACI requirements), at the direction of\r\n             [DynCorp]. . . .\r\n\r\n      C.     AIRCRAFT CONDITION INSPECTION (ACI). [Stevens]\r\n             \t\r\n             shall provide all labor, services, equipment, tools, facilities,\r\n             tooling, lubricants, excluding engine oil, direct and indirect\r\n             parts and material, fuel, and strip and repaint services required\r\n             to perform all the requirements of [the Prime Contract's]\r\n             Statement of Work. . . .\r\n\r\n      D. \t OVER AND ABOVE MAINTENANCE. [Stevens] shall\r\n           perform both Depot and Non-Depot Maintenance in accordance\r\n\n             with Sections 4.0 and 5.0 of the [Statement of Work], and shall\r\n             provide parts and materials required for the same. . . .\r\n\r\n      E.     \t ITE ORGANIZATIONAL MAINTENANCE. As directed by\r\n             S\r\n             [DynCorp], Stevens shall accomplish work, at [Stevens']\r\n             facility, that would normally be performed at the site by the\r\n             site personnel.\r\n\r\nThe Subcontract provides a schedule of per-unit or per-hour prices for each\r\nof the CLINs.\r\n\r\n       Section G limits the parties' relationship based on the funding available from\r\nthe Prime Contract. It provides that if funds from the Prime Contract are exhausted\r\nfor any CLIN, Stevens has no obligation to continue to perform that CLIN and\r\nDynCorp is not liable for any performance Stevens engages in after the funding for\r\na CLIN is exhausted.\r\n\r\n      The Subcontract provides that DynCorp may terminate the contract or seek\r\nother remedies upon the occurrence of any of several enumerated ways in which\r\nStevens may default. Among those, Stevens may default by failing to faithfully\r\nperform its obligations for ten days after receipt of a cure notice, receiving three or\r\nmore cure notices in one year, or suspending its operations.\r\n\r\n       The Subcontract contains an integration clause providing: \"This Subcontract\r\nconstitutes the entire understanding of the parties with respect to the subject matter\r\nhereof, and supersedes all prior representations and agreements, except for those\r\nspecifically and expressly incorporated herein.\" Finally, the Subcontract provides\r\nthat it is to be construed according to the \"federal common law of government\r\ncontracts.\"\r\n\r\nB.    \t E PRESENT SUIT\r\n      TH\r\n\r\n       The parties performed under the Subcontract for approximately nine years\r\nuntil Stevens believed that DynCorp was sending C-12 and RC-12 aircraft covered\r\nby the Subcontract to other aviation maintenance providers. Stevens brought suit\r\nagainst DynCorp alleging it breached the Subcontract by sending covered aircraft\r\nto other service providers. DynCorp moved for a judgment on the pleadings\r\nasserting the Subcontract does not create an exclusive relationship between\r\nDynCorp and Stevens and therefore Stevens' breach of contract claim fails as a\r\nmatter of law. Stevens moved for a judgment on the pleadings or, in the\r\n\nalternative, a partial grant of summary judgment finding the Subcontract creates an\r\nexclusive relationship.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court denied both motions for judgment on the pleadings, but\r\ngranted Stevens' partial motion for summary judgment, holding the Subcontract \"is\r\na 'requirements contract' which obligates DynCorp to send to Stevens all C-12,\r\nRC-12, and UC-35 aircraft submitted to DynCorp under [the Prime Contract] for\r\nthe purpose of allowing Stevens to perform the aviation maintenance services\r\nspecified in that [Subcontract].\" In support of that holding, the circuit court found\r\nthe Subcontract is unambiguous, the Teaming Agreement is incorporated into the\r\nSubcontract, and the language of the Subcontract combined with the language of\r\nthe Teaming Agreement unambiguously establishes that the Subcontract is a\r\nrequirements contract.\r\n\r\n       DynCorp appealed asserting the circuit court erred in granting partial\r\nsummary judgment before the completion of discovery, in granting partial\r\nsummary judgment on grounds not before the court, in finding the Teaming\r\nAgreement was incorporated into the Subcontract, and in holding the Subcontract\r\ncreated an exclusive relationship between the parties. The court of appeals\r\nreversed the circuit court, first holding the Teaming Agreement is not incorporated\r\ninto the Subcontract. Stevens Aviation, Inc. v. DynCorp Intern. LLC, 394 S.C. 300,\r\n307â€“09, 715 S.E.2d 655, 659â€“60 (Ct. App. 2011). The court reasoned that the\r\nreference to the Teaming Agreement is in a \"whereas\" clause and such clauses are\r\ngenerally not considered contractual and not permitted to control express\r\nprovisions of a contract. Id. at 308, 715 S.E.2d at 659. The court went on to find\r\nthe contractual language establishes the parties did not intend to incorporate the\r\nTeaming Agreement because an incorporation provision contained in a \"whereas\"\r\nclause provides that the Subcontract supersedes any prior written agreements.\r\n\r\n      Having found the Teaming Agreement was not incorporated, the court\r\nconsidered the language of the Subcontract and concluded it does not establish an\r\nexclusive relationship between the parties and therefore is not an enforceable\r\nrequirements contract. Id. at 309â€“11, 715 S.E.2d at 660â€“61. As an initial matter,\r\nthe court found the Subcontract does not apply to UC-35 aircraft because it does\r\nnot contain per-unit pricing for those planes. Id. at 309â€“10, 715 S.E.2d at 660.\r\nAddressing exclusivity generally, the court acknowledged some language in the\r\nSubcontract suggests exclusivity, but found other language established that no\r\nexclusive relationship exists. Id. at 311, 715 S.E.2d at 661. Specifically, the court\r\nquoted the language in the Subcontract's Statement of Work providing that Stevens\r\nis to perform strip and paint services \"at the direction of DynCorp\" and is to\r\n\nperform other maintenance \"as directed by DynCorp.\" Id. The court concluded\r\nthe Subcontract is not an enforceable contract and therefore DynCorp is only\r\nobligated to pay Stevens for work already performed. Id. Finally, the court\r\ngranted partial summary judgment to DynCorp. Id. at 312, 715 S.E.2d at 661.\r\nThis Court granted certiorari to review the court of appeals' decision.\r\n\r\n                               ISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI.\t     Did the court of appeals err in holding the Subcontract is not an enforceable\r\n        requirements contract for C-12 and RC-12 aircraft covered by the Prime\r\n        Contract?\r\n\r\nII.\t    Did the court of appeals err in holding the Subcontract is not an enforceable\r\n        requirements contract for UC-35 aircraft covered by the Prime Contract?\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Did the court of appeals err in granting summary judgment to DynCorp\r\n        when DynCorp never moved for summary judgment?\r\n\r\n                            STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n        While federal law governs the Subcontract, the South Carolina Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure and South Carolina Rules of Appellate Procedure govern the\r\nresolution of this dispute. Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil\r\nProcedure provides that a trial court may grant a motion for summary judgment\r\nwhere \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" In determining whether a genuine issue of material fact exists, the evidence\r\nand inferences that can reasonably be drawn therefrom are to be viewed in the light\r\nmost favorable to the nonmoving party. Quail Hill, LLC v. Cnty. of Richland, 387\r\nS.C. 223, 235, 692 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2010). In reviewing a grant of summary\r\njudgment, an appellate court applies the same standard as the trial court. Id.\r\n\r\n                                 LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\nI. \t    C-12 AND RC-12 AIRCRAFT\r\n       Stevens contends that regardless of whether the Subcontract incorporates the\r\nTeaming Agreement, it establishes an exclusive relationship between the parties\r\nand is an enforceable requirements contract. We agree as to the C-12 and RC-12\r\naircraft and conclude the court of appeals erred in holding to the contrary.\r\n\n      Under the federal common law, a services or supply contract must fit into\r\none of three forms: a contract for a definite quantity, a contract for an indefinite\r\nquantity, or a requirements contract. Ace-Federal Reporters, Inc. v. Barram, 226\r\nF.3d 1329, 1331 (Fed. Cir. 2000). As set forth in Torncello v. United States, 681\r\nF.2d 756 (Ct. Cl. 1982), and quoted by subsequent federal decisions, these three\r\nforms of supply contracts are described as:\r\n\r\n      With contracts for a definite quantity, the promises and obligations\r\n      flowing from each party to the other define both the minimum and\r\n      maximum performances of each and furnish the consideration from\r\n      each party that courts require for enforceability. With indefinite\r\n      quantities contracts, however, the buyer's promise specifically is\r\n      uncertain, and such a contract would fail for lack of consideration if it\r\n      did not contain a minimum quantity term. Without an obligatory\r\n      minimum quantity, the buyer would be allowed to order nothing,\r\n      rendering its obligations illusory and, therefore, unenforceable.\r\n      Requirements contracts also lack a promise from the buyer to order a\r\n      specific amount, but consideration is furnished, nevertheless, by the\r\n      buyer's promise to turn to the seller for all such requirements as do\r\n      develop. Such contracts clearly are enforceable on that basis. The\r\n      entitlement of the seller to all of the buyer's requirements is the key,\r\n      for if the buyer were able to turn elsewhere for some of its needs, then\r\n      the contract would not be distinguishable from an indefinite quantities\r\n      contract with no stated minimum, unenforceable as we have stated.\r\n\r\nTorncello, 681 F.2d at 761â€“62 (citations omitted).1\r\n\r\n\r\n1 We reject DynCorp's assertion that in light of the United States Court of Appeals\r\nfor the Federal Circuit's decision in Coyle's Pest Control, Inc. v. Cuomo, 154 F.3d\r\n1302 (Fed. Cir. 1998), a fourth form of services or supply contractâ€”a \"purchase\r\norder pricing structure contract\"â€”exists. DynCorp suggests the Subcontract is\r\nsuch a \"purchase order pricing structure contract\" whereby DynCorp contractually\r\nonly must pay Stevens for services DynCorp orders and Stevens completes at their\r\npreviously agreed upon pricing. Coyle's plainly did not approve such a contract.\r\nTo the contrary, the Coyle's decision made clear the contract at issue there was not\r\nenforceable. Coyle's, 154 F.3d at 1304 (finding \"no error in the Board's reasoning\r\nor conclusion\" that \"the contract is not enforceable for lack of consideration\").\r\nDynCorp misreads the language in Coyle's providing that the plaintiff was \"entitled\r\nto payment only for services actually ordered by [the defendant] and provided by\r\n\n       \"Contract interpretation begins with the plain language of the agreement.\"\r\nGould Inc. v. United States, 935 F.2d 1271, 1274 (Fed. Cir. 1991). In determining\r\nwhich type of services or supply contract parties entered into, a court is to look\r\n\"beyond the first page of the contract to determine what were the legal rights for\r\nwhich the parties bargained.\" Crown Laundry & Dry Cleaners, Inc. v. United\r\nStates, 29 Fed. Cl. 506, 515 (1993). Courts are to \"assume that the parties intended\r\nthat a binding contract be formed,\" and \"[t]hus, any choice of alternative\r\ninterpretations, with one interpretation saving the contract and the other voiding it,\r\nshould be resolved in favor of the interpretation that saves the contract.\"\r\nTorncello, 681 F.2d at 761, see also Crown Laundry, 29 Fed. Cl. at 515â€“16\r\n(\"[B]ecause it must be assumed that the parties intended to form a binding contract,\r\nthe court should favor an interpretation that saves the contract instead of voiding\r\nit.\").2 Additionally, \"an interpretation that gives meaning to all parts of the\r\ncontract is preferable to one which renders provisions in the contract meaningless\r\nor superfluous.\" Crown Laundry, 29 Fed. Cl. at 515.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[the plaintiff].\" Id. at 1306. Having found the contract unenforceable, that\r\nlanguage clearly did not establish a new form of services or supply contracts, but\r\nrather merely acknowledged that the plaintiff could recover on equitable grounds\r\nfor services ordered and performed.\r\n2 We also reject DynCorp's contention that the Coyle's decision overturned this rule\r\nof contract construction. In Coyle's, the court rejected \"the notion that\r\nTorncello . . . requires [a court] to save an otherwise unenforceable indefinite\r\nquantity contract by interpreting it as an 'implied' requirements contract.\" Coyles,\r\n154 F.3d at 1304 (emphasis added). DynCorp urges this Court to read that holding\r\nas rejecting Torncello's instruction to favor an interpretation of an enforceable\r\nrequirements contract where such an interpretation is possible. However, the\r\nCoyle's holding does not extend that far and only rejected the extreme reading of\r\nTorncello as requiring a court to interpret an otherwise unenforceable contract as a\r\nrequirements contract. DynCorp fails to acknowledge that Torncello only instructs\r\na court to favor an interpretation as a requirements contract, rather than as an\r\nunenforceable agreement, only when the contract is susceptible to interpretation as\r\na requirements contract. Torncello, 681 F.2d at 761 (stating a court should favor\r\nan interpretation as a requirements contract only when that is a legitimate \"choice\r\nof alternative interpretations\"). The Coyle's court made this distinction clear,\r\nstating \"the Torncello court implicitly rejected a rule of 'saving the contract' by\r\ninterpreting it as a requirement contract when it is not so susceptible.\" Coyle's, 154\r\nF.3d at 1305.\r\n\n       Here, the contractual language indicates an intent to establish an exclusive\r\nrelationship between the parties. The Subcontract's Statement of Requirements\r\nprovides that Stevens, as DynCorp's subcontractor, is to provide aircraft\r\nmaintenance to \"the Government's fleet of C-12/RC-12 Aircraft . . . under the\r\nPrime Contract.\" (emphasis added). The use of the word \"fleet\" indicates Stevens\r\nis to service all of the government's C-12 and RC-12 aircraft covered by the Prime\r\nContract rather than just those aircraft DynCorp chooses to send to Stevens.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, the Statement of Requirements provides that DynCorp \"is not\r\nrequired to purchase from the Subcontractor any requirement in excess of the total\r\nfunding\" under the Prime Contract. That language implies that DynCorp is\r\nrequired to purchase from Stevens all requirements within the total funding\r\nprovided by the Prime Contract. If that was not the case, the provision would be\r\nsuperfluous because DynCorp could purchase only those services from Stevens it\r\nso chooses.\r\n\r\n       The Subcontract's Statement of Work also evidences an intent to create an\r\nexclusive relationship. Its description of the \"strip and paint\" work states that\r\nStevens \"shall provide all\" services needed to \"strip and completely repaint\r\naircraft.\" (emphasis added). The Subcontract defines \"Aircraft\" as including \"all\"\r\nC-12 and RC-12 aircraft covered by the Prime Contract. Similarly, the Statement\r\nof Work's description of the \"aircraft condition inspection\" work states that Stevens\r\n\"shall provide all\" services needed to \"perform all the requirements\" of the Prime\r\nContract's Statement of Work. The Statement of Work also states that Stevens\r\n\"shall perform both Depot and Non-Depot Maintenance.\" Finally, the Subcontract\r\nsets forth a detailed list of per-unit pricing for each of the items of work Stevens is\r\nto perform. While these provisions do not explicitly state that the Subcontract\r\ncreates an exclusive relationship between the parties, they utilize language\r\nconsistent with and indicative of such a relationship.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, to interpret the Subcontract as not creating an exclusive\r\nrelationship would render the Subcontract's termination provisions superfluous.\r\nThe Subcontract's termination provisions permit DynCorp to terminate the\r\nSubcontract if Stevens fails to perform despite receipt of cure notices. If the\r\nSubcontract is not a requirements contract, the termination provision would be\r\nsuperfluous. DynCorp would not need to issue cure notices or formally terminate\r\nthe contract. DynCorp could effectively unilaterally terminate the contract at any\r\ntime by choosing to not send additional aircraft to Stevens.\r\n\n       The court of appeals erroneously discounted that contractual language and\r\nfocused on the \"at the direction of\" language used in the Subcontract's Statement of\r\nWork for the \"strip and paint\" and \"site organizational maintenance work.\" Stevens\r\nAviation, 394 S.C. at 311, 715 S.E.2d at 661. Presumably, the court of appeals\r\nbelieved that language indicated Stevens was only to perform work on those\r\naircraft that DynCorp directed it to perform work on, thus leaving open the\r\npossibility of DynCorp sending some aircraft to other maintenance providers. We\r\nfind this contractual language does not support that conclusion. As we understand\r\nthe Subcontract, C-12 and RC-12 aircraft would come to Stevens for an inspection.\r\nAfter Stevens performed the inspection, some of the inspected aircraft would need\r\nto be stripped and painted. Thus, the \"at the direction of\" language for the strip and\r\npaint work is best interpreted as meaning that DynCorp directs Stevens as to which\r\naircraft need to be stripped and painted and how they are to be stripped and\r\npainted. The fact that DynCorp can tell Stevens which aircraft need this work is in\r\nno way inconsistent with Stevens performing all such \"strip and paint work.\"\r\n\r\n      For the \"site organizational maintenance\" work, the Subcontract's\r\ndescription of that work is instructive:\r\n\r\n      Both Parties recognize that at times it will be beneficial for work that\r\n      would have normally been performed at the site by the site personnel\r\n      to be accomplished at [Stevens'] facility. [Stevens] is not authorized\r\n      to proceed with such efforts without written authorization from\r\n      DYNCORP. The procedures for request, provision of estimate,\r\n      authorization, and performance of such efforts will be in accordance\r\n      with Section H.12, \"Over and Above Work.\"\r\n\r\nIn other words, \"site organizational maintenance\" is work that needs to be\r\nperformed at a special locationâ€”Stevens' facilities. The fact that Stevens cannot\r\ntransfer its work under the Subcontract to its facilities without DynCorp's prior\r\nauthorization in no way conflicts with the premise that Stevens is to perform all\r\nsuch work required by DynCorp. In short, we interpret these provisions as\r\nmeaning that Stevens is to perform all \"strip and paint\" work and all \"site\r\norganizational maintenance\" work, but is to do so subject to DynCorp's\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we find the unambiguous language of the Subcontract,\r\nregardless of whether the Teaming Agreement is incorporated, establishes an\r\nexclusive relationship between the parties as to C-12 and RC-12 aircraft covered\r\nby the Prime Contract. Therefore, we hold the Subcontract is an enforceable\r\n\nrequirements contract as to those aircraft and reverse that portion of the court of\r\nappeals' decision.\r\n\r\nII.   \t C-35 AIRCRAFT\r\n      U\r\n      Stevens also contends the court of appeals erred in holding the Subcontract\r\ndoes not create an exclusive relationship as to UC-35 aircraft covered by the Prime\r\nContract. We disagree.\r\n\r\n       The Subcontract mentions the UC-35 aircraft in only one provision. The\r\ndefinitions section of the Subcontract defines \"Aircraft\" as \"All Army RC/C-12\r\nand UC-35 aircraft covered under the Prime Contract.\" However, the remainder of\r\nthe Subcontract makes clear that it covers only RC-12 and C-12 aircraft by the use\r\nof provisions specific to those aircraft and the absence of any provisions related to\r\nthe UC-35 aircraft. Specifically, the \"Statement of Requirements\" provides that\r\nStevens \"shall provide\" services for \"the Government's fleet of C-12/RC-12\r\nAircraft.\" The UC-35 is never mentioned in the Statement of Work nor in the\r\ndescriptions of the CLINS covered by the Subcontract.3 Finally, the Subcontract\r\ndoes not contain a schedule of services and costs for the UC-35 aircraft, and \"per-\r\nunit pricing . . . is an essential element in a requirements contract . . . .\" Ceredo\r\nMortuary Chapel, Inc. v. United States, 29 Fed. Cl. 346, 351 (1993). Accordingly,\r\nwe conclude the Subcontract does not contain language establishing that Stevens is\r\nto perform any work on the UC-35 aircraft, much less language establishing that\r\nStevens has an exclusive relationship with DynCorp as to the maintenance of the\r\nUC-35 aircraft under the Prime Contract. Therefore, we affirm the court of\r\nappeals' holding as to the UC-35 aircraft.\r\n\r\nIII. \t THE COURT OF APPEALS' GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT\r\n       TO DYNCORP\r\n       Finally, we hold the court of appeals erred in granting summary judgment to\r\nDynCorp. While this Court has not yet addressed whether an appellate court may\r\ngrant summary judgment to a party who did not move for that relief below, the rule\r\nin other jurisdictions is that an appellate court may do so only under limited\r\ncircumstances. See, e.g., Kassbaum v. Steppenwolf Prods., Inc., 236 F.3d 487, 494\r\n(9th Cir. 2000) (\"It is generally recognized that a court has the power sua sponte to\r\ngrant summary judgment to a non-movant when there has been a motion but no\r\n\r\n3The Statement of Work does use the term \"aircraft\" in its description of the \"strip\r\nand paint\" work, but the heading for that work is \"C-12/RC-12 STRIP AND\r\nPAINT.\"\r\n\ncross-motion.\"); In the Matter of Cont'l Airlines, 981 F.2d 1450, 1458 (5th Cir.\r\n1993) (\"This court has the power to render summary judgment for a nonmoving\r\nparty if we find that the moving party is not entitled to summary judgment and that\r\nno factual dispute exists and the nonmoving party is entitled to summary judgment\r\nas a matter of law.\"); Johnson v. Earnhardt's Gilbert Dodge, Inc., 132 P.3d 825,\r\n830â€“31 (Ariz. 2006) (acknowledging that an appellate court may grant summary\r\njudgment for a nonmoving party where the moving party had an opportunity to\r\naddress the issue before the trial court and to show that a genuine issue of material\r\nfact exists).\r\n\r\n      We need not decide whether to adopt the rule from these other jurisdictions\r\nbecause the limited circumstances wherein an appellate court may grant summary\r\njudgment are not present here. Accordingly, we hold the court of appeals erred in\r\ngranting summary judgment to DynCorp.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n        We hold the Subcontract is a requirements contract creating an exclusive\r\nrelationship as to the C-12 and RC-12 aircraft, reverse the court of appeals' holding\r\nto the contrary, and reinstate the circuit court's grant of summary judgment as to\r\nthis issue. We also affirm the court of appeals' holding that the Subcontract is not a\r\nrequirements contract as to the UC-35 aircraft. Finally, we reverse the court of\r\nappeals' grant of summary judgment to DynCorp.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27370","title":"Holmes v.

We\r\naffirm the circuit court's grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondents and\r\nthe award of sanctions against Appellant.\r\n\r\n                         FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n       Respondent East Cooper Community Hospital, Incorporated, is a subsidiary\r\nof Respondent Tenet HealthSystem Medical, Incorporated, and owns, operates and\r\ndoes business as East Cooper Medical Center (the Hospital), a private hospital in\r\nMount Pleasant, South Carolina. Appellant is a doctor, who currently practices\r\nophthalmology in Sullivan's Island, South Carolina, and was previously a member\r\nof the consulting medical staff of the Hospital.1 During the relevant time period,\r\nAppellant was a member of the Hospital's medical consulting staff, appointed in\r\ntwo-year increments. In October 2006, Appellant submitted a reappointment\r\napplication seeking advancement in medical staff category and clinical privileges\r\nto perform surgery on the eye. The Hospital's credentialing committee found\r\nAppellant unqualified for the level of privileges she requested. Appellant received\r\nadministrative review of this decision, and was ultimately reappointed as\r\nconsulting medical staff for another two-year term. In October 2008, Appellant\r\nsubmitted another reappointment application requesting advancement. This time,\r\nthe Hospital determined that Appellant's application was incomplete and requested\r\nshe voluntarily resign from the medical staff without appellate rights under the\r\nmedical staff bylaws. The current appeal stems from these privileging decisions.\r\n\r\n     By way of background, this case represents the fourth lawsuit filed by\r\nAppellant against Respondents regarding credentialing decisions.2 In each case,\r\n\r\n1   Appellant is also a licensed attorney and member of the South Carolina Bar.\r\n2Appellant has also brought two legal malpractice claims against the attorneys\r\nwho represented her in the first two lawsuits.\r\n\nAppellant has alleged breach of contract and breach of the covenant of good faith\r\nand fair dealing arising out of Respondents' alleged mishandling of Appellant's\r\nmedical staff privileging applications. Appellant filed her first lawsuit against\r\nRespondents in federal court in 1999, alleging violations of the Sherman Anti-\r\nTrust Act, 15 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 1, et seq. (2004), and pendant state law claims, including\r\ninter alia, claims for wrongful termination of hospital privileges, breach of\r\ncontract, breach of contract accompanied by a fraudulent act, civil conspiracy, and\r\nunfair trade practices. That lawsuit ended when the district court granted summary\r\njudgment in favor of Respondents on the federal claim, and dismissed the\r\nremaining state law claims pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1367(c)(3) (providing a court\r\nmay decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over state law claims in cases\r\nwhere the district court has dismissed all claims over which it has original\r\njurisdiction).3\r\n\r\n       On May 16, 2000, Appellant again challenged the Hospital's credentialing\r\ndecisions, this time in circuit court. On January 20, 2003, the parties executed a\r\nsettlement agreement in the second lawsuit (the Settlement Agreement). The\r\nSettlement Agreement provided, in part, that Appellant be reappointed to the\r\nconsulting medical staff position from 2002 until 2004 with \"the right to apply for\r\na change in status in accordance with the Bylaws.\"\r\n\r\n       In 2005, Appellant filed a third lawsuit against Respondents alleging, inter\r\nalia, that Respondents breached the Settlement Agreement and the covenant of\r\ngood faith and fair dealing in reviewing Appellant's applications for medical staff\r\nprivileges in 2002 and 2004. More specifically, Appellant alleged that she and\r\nRespondents were parties to a contractual agreement \"the terms of which are set\r\nforth in the Medical Staff Bylaws, Rules and Regulations, and related documents.\"\r\n\r\n        The circuit court ultimately granted summary judgment in favor of\r\nRespondents in the 2005 lawsuit on May 23, 2007. In addressing the allegations\r\nrelating to Appellant's 2004 application, Circuit Court Judge R. Markley Dennis,\r\nJr., stated, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      The [Appellant's] Amended Complaint seeks judicial determination of\r\n\r\n3Appellant filed a pro se appeal from the district court's decision in the United\r\nStates Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, which was dismissed on November\r\n17, 2000. She subsequently sought a writ of certiorari from the United States\r\nSupreme Court, which was denied on October 1, 2001.\r\n\n        whether the decisions regarding her credentialing and privileges at\r\n        East Cooper Hospital were reasonable and in compliance with the\r\n        Hospital's Bylaws. Specifically, she requests the Court to review\r\n        whether the failure to process and consider her application for\r\n        associate status and surgical privileges, her reappointment to the\r\n        consulting staff, and the denial of an administrative hearing were\r\n        reasonable decisions made in accordance with the Bylaws. The\r\n        [Appellant's] claims all arise out of the peer review process at [the\r\n        Hospital] and, as such, are not subject to judicial review. The Court\r\n        does not have jurisdiction to determine these issues and [Appellant]\r\n        has presented no evidence or reason to persuade the Court to depart\r\n        from the long-standing principle that such actions are not subject to\r\n        judicial review.\r\n\r\nJudge Dennis explained further:\r\n\r\n        [Appellant] argues that the Court does have jurisdiction over this\r\n        matter based on Lee v. Chesterfield General Hospital, 289 S.C. 6, 344\r\n        S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1986). The Court declines to adopt [Appellant's]\r\n        interpretation of the Lee decision as applicable to the matter herein. In\r\n        Lee the Court confirmed the decision reached in Gowen [sic]4 but\r\n        found subject matter jurisdiction where [Appellant] did not seek to\r\n        conduct a judicial review of internal hospital rules, but claimed that\r\n        the Bylaws were imposed in furtherance of a conspiracy, the purpose\r\n        of which was to injure [Appellant]. Lee[, 289 S.C.] at 10. Here\r\n        [Appellant] asks the Court to review the basis for the credentialing\r\n        decisions and substitute its judgment for the Hospital and its review\r\n        committees by determining that the credentialing decisions were made\r\n        inappropriately. This is precisely the type of intervention that [the]\r\n        Strauss,5 Gowen [sic], and Wood6 decisions sought to prevent.7\r\n\r\n\r\n4   Gowan v. St. Francis Comty. Hosp., 275 S.C. 203, 268 S.E.2d 580 (1980).\r\n5   Strauss v. Marlboro Cnty. Gen. Hosp., 185 S.C. 425, 194 S.E. 65 (1937).\r\n6   Wood v. Hilton Head Hosp., Inc., 292 S.C. 403, 405, 356 S.E.2d 841, 842 (1987).\r\n7Appellant appealed this order to the court of appeals on three separate occasions,\r\nand the court of appeals dismissed and remitted the case each time.\r\n\n       In a subsequent order, dated August 6, 2009, sanctioning Appellant pursuant\r\nto the FCPSA, Judge Dennis stated:\r\n\r\n        Despite clear case law to the contrary, [Appellant] filed this action\r\n        seeking judicial determination of whether the decisions regarding her\r\n        credentialing and privileges were reasonable and in compliance with\r\n        the Hospital's Bylaws. Specifically, she sought the Court to review\r\n        whether the failure to process and consider her application for\r\n        associate status and surgical privileges, her reappointment to the\r\n        consulting staff, and the denial of an administrative hearing were\r\n        reasonable decisions made in accordance with the Bylaws.\r\n        [Appellant's] claims all arose out of the peer review process and,\r\n        under South Carolina law, are not subject to judicial review, and\r\n        [Appellant] presented no evidence or reason to persuade the Court to\r\n        depart from this longstanding principle.\r\n\r\n       On April 26, 2010, Appellant filed her complaint in the instant action,8\r\nalleging Respondents breached their contract and covenant of good faith and fair\r\ndealing by \"attempting (successfully to date) to block [Appellant] from being able\r\nto seek review of its decision to deny her application for advancement in staff\r\nprivileges in violation of the letter and the spirit of the applicable bylaws.\" As a\r\nresult, Appellant submitted that she \"suffered actual damages and special damages,\r\nin the form of lost income, and loss of business to her practice, as she has been\r\nunable to admit any patients to the hospital to perform medical procedures from\r\n2007 . . . and continuing presently.\" Appellant sought review of the specific\r\ndecisions of the Hospital to deny her application for surgical privileges in 2006 and\r\nto reject her 2008 application as incomplete.\r\n\r\n      On September 17, 2010, Respondents filed an answer and counterclaims for\r\nabuse of process and malicious prosecution. As part of their Answer, Respondents\r\nalso moved for sanctions under the FCPSA.\r\n\r\n      On September 24, 2010, Respondents moved for judgment on the pleadings\r\npursuant to 12(c), SCRCP.9 In their motion, Respondents argued that, based on the\r\n\r\n8Appellant is represented in this litigation by the same counsel who represented\r\nher in the 2005 litigation.\r\n9   Rule 12(c), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\npleadings, the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to consider Appellant's claims. A\r\nhearing was convened before Judge Dennis to hear arguments on Respondents'\r\nmotion on December 16, 2010. At the hearing, Judge Dennis orally denied the\r\nmotion on the basis that it would be more appropriately considered as a motion for\r\nsummary judgment:\r\n\r\n      I think the safest for everybody, for review purposes is to have this\r\n      matter resolved not on a [m]otion on the pleadings but on a [m]otion\r\n      for summary judgment. I just am notâ€”I understand the jurisdictional\r\n      issue. There are matters, though, that Iâ€”I really would have to rely on\r\n      certain things outside of the context of the pleadings.\r\n\r\nIn denying the motion, Judge Dennis not only warned Appellant's counsel against\r\nengaging in frivolous proceedings, but took care to reiterate he was not making any\r\nruling with respect to the merits of Respondents' claims that the circuit court lacked\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction:\r\n\r\n      I don't quarrel with anything you've [Respondents' counsel] said. I\r\n      would remind everybodyâ€”I don't have to, we have very competent\r\n      lawyers involved in this, but if this is another effort that really is\r\n      nothing more thanâ€”could be considered frivolous, though I am not\r\n      making that finding now, and I would not hesitate, nor am I sure any\r\n      other judge would hesitate to impose sanctions.\r\n\r\n             So Iâ€”I just remind everybody what we're doing here because I\r\n      think it has to be looked at in a real sense. I think that the [sic] there\r\n      are things, [Appellant's counsel],â€”no disrespect to you, sir, butâ€”I\r\n      understand what you say sounds like that might be creative lawyering,\r\n      too, by using semanticsâ€”and I don't think that it is there. That's not\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      After the pleadings are closed but within such time as not to delay the\r\n      trial, any party may move for judgment on the pleadings. If, on a\r\n      motion for judgment on the pleadings, matters outside the pleadings\r\n      are presented to and not excluded by the Court, the motion shall be\r\n      treated as one for summary judgment and disposed of as provided in\r\n      Rule 56, and all parties shall be given reasonable opportunity to\r\n      present all material made pertinent to such a motion by Rule 56.\r\n\n      for me to judge today.\r\n\r\n             I agree with you that it would be a mistake to grant this on the\r\n      basis of the pleadings. So that's the reason that I am denying itâ€”not\r\n      anything about the merits.\r\n\r\n      Respondents filed a motion to reconsider pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP.\r\nJudge Dennis held a hearing on this motion on March 8, 2011, and orally denied\r\nthe motion. On March 9, 2011, Judge Dennis denied this motion in a form order.\r\n\r\n       On June 6, 2011, Respondents filed a motion for summary judgment on\r\nseveral grounds, including that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction\r\nto review the medical staff privileging decisions of a private hospital. A hearing\r\nwas convened on July 8, 2011, before the Honorable Kristi Lee Harrington. By\r\norder dated July 29, 2011, Judge Harrington entered summary judgment in favor of\r\nRespondents (the Summary Judgment Order). In the Summary Judgment Order,\r\nJudge Harrington found that the circuit court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to\r\nreview the Hospital's privileging decisions with respect to Appellant.\r\n\r\n      On August 8, 2011, Respondents filed a motion for sanctions under the\r\nFCPSA, arguing, inter alia, that the circuit court should sanction Appellant for\r\n\"seeking adjudication of claims over which this Court does not have jurisdiction\"\r\nand \"raising issues which have been previously adjudicated against [Appellant] and\r\nin [Respondents'] favor.\"\r\n\r\n       On August 24, 2011, Appellant appealed the Summary Judgment Order.\r\nAppellant also filed a response to Respondents' motion for sanctions in the circuit\r\ncourt, arguing that the circuit court could not grant sanctions against her where the\r\ncourt had previously denied Respondents' motion to dismiss; that she was\r\ncompetently represented by counsel, and therefore, immune from sanctions; and\r\nthat Respondents' motion was premature because of the pending appeal of the\r\nSummary Judgment Order.\r\n\r\n       On November 22, 2011, Judge Harrington heard arguments concerning\r\nRespondents' motion for sanctions. During the hearing, Appellant argued that the\r\nFCPSA unconstitutionally holds pro se litigants to a reasonable attorney standard\r\nand deprives litigants of due process by requiring the circuit court to report any\r\nviolation of the FCPSA directly to this Court. No other constitutional issues were\r\nraised by Appellant during this hearing.\r\n\n       By order dated February 1, 2012, Judge Harrington awarded sanctions\r\nagainst Appellant for violating the FCPSA (the Sanctions Order) by \"initiating and\r\ncontinuing this litigation despite this Court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction,\r\ndespite a prior ruling against [Appellant] that this Court lacks subject matter\r\njurisdiction, and despite being sanctioned for arguing that this Court has subject\r\nmatter jurisdiction in a previous case based on the very same allegations.\" Judge\r\nHarrington further found that Appellant violated the FCPSA by initiating and\r\ncontinuing \"the present action despite [Respondents'] compliance with the plain\r\nlanguage of [the Hospital's] Bylaws.\" Judge Harrington also noted:\r\n\r\n         While [Appellant] contends that this previous circuit court order is not\r\n         binding precedent and that Judge Dennis's decision in this instance\r\n         was incorrect, [Appellant] ignores that \"[u]nder the doctrine of\r\n         collateral estoppel, when an issue of fact or law is actually litigated\r\n         and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the determination\r\n         is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a\r\n         subsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a\r\n         different claim.\" Carman v. S.C. Alcoholic Beverage Control Comm'n,\r\n         317 S.C. 1, 6, 451 S.E.2d 383, 386 (1994). [Appellant] failed to offer\r\n         any argument as to why Judge Dennis's decision does not collaterally\r\n         estop her in this action. Moreover, [Appellant's] argument on this\r\n         point emphasizes her willingness to re-litigate the case she lost in\r\n         2005.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, Judge Harrington ordered Appellant to pay Respondents'\r\nattorneys' fees and other costs associated with this action in the amount of\r\n$53,447.15 and enjoined Appellant from any future filings against Respondents\r\nabsent the posting of a bond to pay Respondents' attorneys' fees and costs in the\r\nevent Respondents prevail in future litigation and upon a showing that\r\nRespondents would be entitled to such fees and costs.10\r\n\r\n      On February 21, 2012, Appellant filed a motion to reconsider the Sanctions\r\nOrder.11 Appellant appealed the Sanctions Order on March 6, 2012. On March 7,\r\n\r\n10\r\n Noticeably, the Sanctions Order did not address any constitutional arguments\r\nmade by Appellant.\r\n11   In her motion to reconsider, Appellant sought a ruling on her prior constitutional\r\n\n2012, Judge Harrington denied Appellant's motion to reconsider the Sanctions\r\nOrder. On March 21, 2012, Appellant filed an amended notice of appeal of the\r\nSanctions Order after the circuit court denied her motion to reconsider.\r\n\r\n       On May 24, 2012, this Court certified these cases for review pursuant to\r\nRule 204(b), SCACR, and consolidated Appellant's two appeals for purposes of\r\nbriefing and oral argument.            ISSUES\r\n\r\n   I.\t    Whether the circuit court erred in awarding sanctions against \n\r\n          Appellant?\n\r\n\r\n   II.\t   Whether the FCPSA is unconstitutional?\r\n\r\n                                     ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n   I. Successive \"Motions to Dismiss\"\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that because the hospital failed to prevail on its first and\r\nsecond \"motions to dismiss\" for lack of subject matter jurisdiction before Judge\r\nDennis, South Carolina law prohibits a finding of frivolity where the case was\r\nultimately dismissed on a third, identical \"motion to dismiss\" before a different\r\njudge, Judge Harrington. On the other hand, Respondents contend that the circuit\r\ncourt's ruling with respect to Respondents' motion for judgment on the pleadings\r\nand summary judgment motion does not preclude sanctions under the FCPSA.\r\n\r\n       First, we find that Appellant mischaracterizes the nature of Respondents'\r\nmotions. The characterization of Respondents' motions as \"motions to dismiss\"\r\ncontradicts the Record. Initially, Respondents submitted a motion for judgment on\r\nthe pleadings to Judge Dennis, followed not by a second \"motion to dismiss,\" but a\r\nsubsequent motion to reconsider the denial of that motion. In discussing the\r\nmotion for judgment on the pleadings, Judge Dennis explicitly stated that he was\r\nnot denying the motion on the merits, finding instead that summary judgment\r\nwould be the proper avenue to consider Respondents' arguments. Therefore,\r\n\r\n\r\nargument that the \"reasonable attorney\" standard in the FCPSA violates due\r\nprocess. However, for the first time, Appellant argued that the FCPSA inhibits\r\nfree speech.\r\n\nRespondents filed a motion for summary judgment, which Judge Harrington\r\nultimately granted in their favor. This was not a third motion to dismiss, as\r\nAppellant claims.\r\n\r\n       Appellant's attempt to characterize these motions as successive \"motions to\r\ndismiss\" is a veiled effort to make the facts of this case conform to those in\r\nHanahan v. Simpson, 326 S.C. 140, 485 S.E.2d 903 (1997), as Appellant relies on\r\nHanahan for the proposition that sanctions were inappropriate based on the posture\r\nof her case. In that case, the Court, acting under a prior version of the FCPSA,\r\nreversed the award of sanctions after the sanctioned party prevailed on a summary\r\njudgment motion, but lost the case after a full trial on the merits. Id. at 158, 485\r\nS.E.2d at 913. The Court adopted the rationale \"that a party who survives pre-trial\r\nmotions to dismiss and for summary judgment are not subject to sanctions after a\r\ntrial on the surviving claims,\" stating that \"[t]he theory behind these cases is that if\r\na case is submitted to the jury, it cannot be deemed frivolous.\" Id. at 157, 485\r\nS.E.2d at 912 (citation omitted). Thus, by claiming that she survived successive\r\nmotions to dismiss, Appellant attempts to utilize Hanahan to avoid sanctions.\r\n\r\n       However, the present case is distinguishable from Hanahan in that, here,\r\nAppellant did not \"survive\" a pre-trial motion to dismiss or for summary judgment\r\nand never made it to a trial on the merits. Rather, Judge Dennis expressly deferred\r\na decision on the merits until such motion was in the proper procedural posture.\r\nTherefore, because Judge Harrington granted Respondents' motion for summary\r\njudgment and Appellant's case was never tried on the merits, Appellant is not\r\nimmune from sanctions under Hanahan's rationale.\r\n\r\n    Nevertheless, Hanahan was decided in 1997 under a prior version of the\r\nFCPSA. At that time, the FCSPA provided:\r\n\r\n      Any person who takes part in the procurement, initiation,\r\n      continuation, or defense of any civil proceeding is subject to being\r\n      assessed for payment of all or a portion of the attorney's fees and court\r\n      costs of the other party if:\r\n\r\n      (1) he does so primarily for a purpose other than that of securing the\r\n      proper discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the claim upon\r\n      which the proceedings are based; and\r\n\n      (2) the proceedings have terminated in favor of the person seeking an\r\n      assessment of the fees and costs.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15â€“36â€“10 (2005). Under the prior version of the Act, the party\r\nseeking sanctions bore the burden of proving:\r\n\r\n      (1) the other party has procured, initiated, continued, or defended the\r\n      civil proceedings against him;\r\n\r\n      (2) the proceedings were terminated in his favor;\r\n\r\n      (3) the primary purpose for which the proceedings were procured,\r\n      initiated, continued, or defended was not that of securing the proper\r\n      discovery, joinder of parties, or adjudication of the civil proceedings;\r\n\r\n      (4) the aggrieved person has incurred attorney's fees and court costs;\r\n      and\r\n\r\n      (5) the amount of the fees and costs set forth in item (4).\r\n\r\nId. Â§ 15-36-40.\r\n\r\n       In 2005, the General Assembly substantially amended section 15-36-10, and\r\nrepealed sections 15-36-20 through -50. See Act No. 27, 2005 S.C. Acts 114, Â§ 5\r\n(effective July 1, 2005) (revising Â§ 15-36-10); Act No. 27, 2005 S.C. Acts 121, Â§\r\n12 (effective March 21, 2005) (repealing Â§Â§ 15-36-20 through -50). Section 15-\r\n36-10 now reads, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      At the conclusion of a trial and after a verdict for or a verdict against\r\n      damages has been rendered or a case has been dismissed by a directed\r\n      verdict, summary judgment, or judgment notwithstanding the verdict, upon\r\n      motion of the prevailing party, the court shall proceed to determine if the\r\n      claim or defense was frivolous.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(C)(1) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n      Under the plain terms of this new section of the FCPSA, Hanahan's\r\nreasoning as to the disposition of pre-trial motions no longer applies. See Hodges\r\nv. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 87, 533 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2000) (\"When the language of a\r\n\nstatute is clear and explicit, a court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into\r\nit which are not in the legislature's language, and there is no need to resort to\r\nstatutory interpretation or legislative intent to determine its meaning.\") (citation\r\nomitted). Rather, sanctions may be awarded under section 15-36-10 regardless of\r\nwhether or not the case has been tried to verdict so long as the trial court finds by a\r\npreponderance of the evidence that the party should be sanctioned under the terms\r\nof the FCPSA. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(C).\r\n\r\n       Here, Appellant lost at the summary judgment stage. Therefore, while the\r\ncircuit court erred in relying on Hanahan, the circuit court did not err in assessing\r\nsanctions pursuant to the FCPSA at that point.\r\n\r\n     II. Merits of Appellant's Case under Existing Law\r\n\r\n       However, Appellant further argues that her position on subject matter\r\njurisdiction is supported by existing law, and therefore, the circuit court erred in\r\nfinding that she frivolously pursued her claims. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(J)\r\n(stating the provisions of the FCPSA \"shall not apply where an attorney or pro se\r\nlitigant establishes a basis to proceed with litigation, or to assert or controvert an\r\nissue therein, that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith argument for an\r\nextension, modification, or reversal of the existing law.\"). On the other hand,\r\nRespondents argue that the circuit court acted within its discretion in finding that a\r\nreasonable attorney under the same circumstances would believe that under the\r\nfacts, Appellant's claim was unwarranted under existing law, and that a good faith\r\nor reasonable argument did not exist for the extension, modification, or reversal of\r\nexisting law.\r\n\r\n      Appellant's argument concerning sanctions hinges on the validity of the\r\nSummary Judgment Order. In this respect, Appellant argues that sanctions were\r\nnot warranted under the FCPSA where summary judgment was inappropriate as a\r\nmatter of law and fact. Of course, Respondents argue that summary judgment was\r\nappropriate as a matter of law.12\r\n\r\n      Summary judgment should be granted when there are no genuine issues of\r\nmaterial fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\r\nRule 56(c), SCRCP; Lanham v. Blue Cross & Blue Shield of S.C., Inc., 349 S.C.\r\n\r\n12We note that in the proceedings below, the parties stipulated that the matters\r\nunder consideration were matters of law for the court.\r\n\n356, 361, 563 S.E.2d 331, 333 (2002) (\"An appellate court reviews a grant of\r\nsummary judgment under the same standard applied by the trial court pursuant to\r\nRule 56, SCRCP.\" (citation omitted)). \"Summary judgment is not appropriate\r\nwhere further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application\r\nof the law\" and \"should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to\r\nevidentiary facts if there is disagreement concerning the conclusion to be drawn\r\nfrom those facts.\" Lanham, 349 S.C. at 362, 563 S.E.2d at 333 (citations omitted).\r\nAs in the trial court, \"[o]n appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the\r\nappellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in\r\nand from the evidence in a light most favorable to the non-moving party below.\"\r\nId. (citing Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447\r\n(1976)). \"[I]n cases applying the preponderance of the evidence burden of proof,\r\nthe non-moving party is only required to submit a mere scintilla of evidence in\r\norder to withstand a motion for summary judgment.\" Hancock v. Mid-South\r\nMgmt. Co., 381 S.C. 326, 330, 673 S.E.2d 801, 803 (2009). Nevertheless, \"when\r\nthe evidence is susceptible of only one reasonable interpretation, summary\r\njudgment may be granted.\" Brooks v. Northwood Little League, Inc., 327 S.C.\r\n400, 403, 489 S.E.2d 647, 648 (Ct. App. 1997) (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n      Appellant contends that her subject matter jurisdiction argument is based on\r\na good faith or reasonable extension of the court of appeals' decision in Lee v.\r\nChesterfield General Hospital, Inc., 289 S.C. 6, 344 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1986).\r\n\r\n       We agree with Respondents that Appellant made this exact legal argument in\r\nthe 2005 litigation before Judge Dennis and has provided no reason why her\r\nargument is any different in this case, aside from the dates of the credentialing\r\ndecisions. In fact, at the hearing on sanctions, Appellant's counsel indicated that he\r\nwanted another \"bite of the apple,\" as he aimed to obtain a ruling by an appellate\r\ncourt that Judge Dennis's interpretation of Lee was wrong, and Appellant's\r\ninterpretation was indeed correct.13 In granting summary judgment to\r\n\r\n13   At the sanctions hearing, Appellant's counsel argued:\r\n\r\n         Your order was issued on your interpretation [in the present lawsuit]\r\n         and Judge Dennis's interpretation [in the 2005 lawsuit] of the Lee\r\n         case. And while I fully respect that the Court has the authority to\r\n         interpret these cases and issue an order, the only other order in\r\n         existence that supports Your Honor's order is Judge Dennis's [order in\r\n         the 2005 lawsuit], which is a circuit court order and not an appellate\r\n\nRespondents, Judge Harrington found that \"at least two prior orders entered by\r\n[Judge Dennis] in a previous case between these parties operate as res judicata\r\nand/or collateral estoppel as to this issue, and these also support the Court's\r\ndecision herein.\"\r\n\r\n       We affirm the grant of summary judgment in favor of Respondents on the\r\nbasis that Appellant is collaterally estopped from bringing this suit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      opinion. And we're in the Court of Appeals now for me to challenge \n\r\n      that order, which is the proper way to do it. \n\r\n      ....\n  In fact, attorneys are allowed to even go against existing\r\n      appellate opinion if they have a good-faith argument against it. In this\r\n      case I wasn't going against appellate law. I felt that Judge Dennis was\r\n      incorrect, and you felt that I was incorrect, and now we are in the\r\n      Court of Appeals. That's the way the system is supposed to work. It's\r\n      not a frivolous lawsuit.\r\n      ....   The second sanctions order [issued by Judge Dennis in the 2005\r\n      case] I'm very well aware of. And I was aware of that when I took this\r\n      case which is why I did the research, I talked to other lawyers in the\r\n      community to see what they thought.\r\n\r\n            And the question was, was Judge Dennis right about Lee versus\r\n      Chesterfield. The consensus that I got was that he wasn't right about\r\n      Lee versus Chesterfield. I don't think he was right about Lee versus\r\n      Chesterfield.\r\n\r\n            And it does me no good to say that to anybody except to you\r\n      and then to the [a]ppellate [c]ourt, which is exactly where I'm going.\r\n      The case was very specifically tailored for that purpose . . . was either\r\n      I'm going to convince a judge this time that I'm right about Lee versus\r\n      Chesterfield, or I'm going to convince an appellate panel on the\r\n      Supreme Court that I'm right about Lee versus Chesterfield, or I'm just\r\n      dead wrong and everybody is going to tell me so all the way up.\r\n\n       \"Under the doctrine of collateral estoppel, when an issue of fact or law is\r\nactually litigated and determined by a valid and final judgment, and the\r\ndetermination is essential to the judgment, the determination is conclusive in a\r\nsubsequent action between the parties, whether on the same or a different claim.\"\r\nCarman, 317 S.C. at 6, 451 S.E.2d at 386 (citing S.C. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Guar.\r\nAss'n v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., 304 S.C. 210, 403 S.E.2d 625 (1991)). \"The\r\nestoppel of a judgment does not extend to matters not expressly adjudicated, and\r\nwhich can be inferred only by argument or construction from the judgment, except\r\nwhere they are necessary and inevitable inferences in the sense that the judgment\r\ncould not have been rendered as it was without deciding such points.\" Id. (citing\r\nDunlap & Dunlap v. Zimmerman, 188 S.C. 322, 199 S.E. 296 (1938)).\r\n\r\n      Judge Dennis rejected Appellant's Lee argument in the 2005 lawsuit:\r\n\r\n      [Appellant] argues that the Court does have jurisdiction over this\r\n      matter based on Lee v. Chesterfield General Hospital, 289 S.C. 6, 344\r\n      S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1986). The Court declines to adopt [Appellant's]\r\n      interpretation of the Lee decision as applicable to the matter herein. In\r\n      Lee the Court confirmed the decision reached in Gowen [sic] but\r\n      found subject matter jurisdiction where [Appellant] did not seek to\r\n      conduct a judicial review of internal hospital rules, but claimed that\r\n      the Bylaws were imposed in furtherance of a conspiracy, the purpose\r\n      of which was to injure [Appellant]. Lee[, 289 S.C.] at 10. Here\r\n      [Appellant] asks the Court to review the basis for the credentialing\r\n      decisions and substitute its judgment for the Hospital and its review\r\n      committees by determining that the credentialing decisions were made\r\n      inappropriately. This is precisely the type of intervention that [the]\r\n      Strauss, Gowen [sic], and Wood decisions sough to prevent.\r\n\r\n      Because Judge Dennis issued a final ruling on whether Respondents\r\nbreached the Settlement Agreement with respect to privileging decisions made in\r\n2002 and 2004 based on the Lee v. Chesterfield decision, Appellant is estopped\r\nfrom bringing the exact legal arguments against Respondents with respect to the\r\n2006 and 2008 credentialing decisions.\r\n\r\n       Nevertheless, Appellant's argument that existing law supports her claim fails\r\non the merits. Appellant argues that her attorney was concerned with the dismissal\r\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the 2005 case, so he specifically limited\r\nthe claims in this case to fall within the ambit of the Lee holding, \"which he read as\r\n\nrestricting the immunity granted to private hospitals from suits requesting a due\r\nprocess review, rather than other types of common law claims.\" Therefore,\r\nAppellant contends that her claims are specifically tailored to the Settlement\r\nAgreement, and not the Hospital's by-laws. At the hearing before Judge\r\nHarrington on Respondents' summary judgment motion, Respondents again argued\r\nthat the circuit court lacked jurisdiction to hear this claim under Gowan v. St.\r\nFrancis Community Hospital, 275 S.C. 203, 268 S.E.2d 580 (1980) and its\r\nprogeny. On the other hand, Appellant again argued that the facts alleged in\r\nAppellant's complaint were indistinguishable from those in Lee. Judge Harrington\r\nruled in favor of Respondents, finding that Lee was inapplicable to this case, and\r\nstating Appellant's \"claims all arise out of the peer review process at the Hospital\r\nand, as such, are not subject to judicial review.\"\r\n\r\n       In Lee, a licensed and certified physician's assistant, Lee, and a licensed\r\nphysician, Newson, had been granted staff privileges to perform procedures by\r\nChesterfield General Hospital (the hospital) for several years. Lee, 289 S.C. at 8,\r\n344 S.E.2d at 380. In October 1982, Lee reapplied for privileges to perform a host\r\nof medical procedures at the hospital. Id. In January 1983, the hospital approved\r\nprivileges to perform some of these procedures, but not all of them. Id. In\r\nFebruary 1983, the hospital's board of trustees again limited Lee's privileges. Id. at\r\n7, 344 S.E.2d at 381. In their complaints, Lee and Newson alleged that the\r\nhospital administrator, the hospital and other members of the medical staff\r\nconspired \"'to dominate the practice of medicine by licensed physicians in\r\nChesterfield County' and 'to restrain and eliminate, for their own financial\r\nadvantage and professional enhancement, the element of fair competition' in the\r\npractice of medicine in Chesterfield County.\" Id. at 9, 344 S.E.2d at 381. As a\r\nresult, Lee and Newson alleged that they had suffered damages, including mental\r\nanguish, loss of professional reputation, and loss of trade. Id.\r\n\r\n         Citing Gowan, the court of appeals restated the general rule14 with respect to\r\n\r\n14   In Wood, this Court explained:\r\n\r\n         It is well settled in South Carolina, and throughout the country, that it\r\n         is improper for the courts to review the decisions of governing boards\r\n         of private hospitals concerning the staff privileges of practitioners.\r\n         This Court adopted the majority rule many years ago in the case of\r\n         Strauss v. Marlboro County General Hospital, 185 S.C. 425, 194 S.E.\r\n         65 (1937). In the recent decision of Gowan v. St. Francis Community\r\n\nchallenging hospital staff privileging decisions:\r\n\r\n      We agree that a private hospital is free, in the absence of controlling\r\n      legislation or regulatory provisions, to decide the nature and extent of\r\n      medical practice permitted to persons it grants staff privileges.\r\n      Ordinarily, such decisions involve matters of expert medical judgment\r\n      not subject to judicial review.\r\n\r\nId. Moreover, the court reiterated that \"[a] medical professional has no right,\r\nsimply because he is licensed by state authority[,] to claim unrestricted staff\r\nprivileges in a hospital.\" Id. Nevertheless, that court found:\r\n\r\n      These principles are not dispositive of the present cases, however. In\r\n      ruling on the demurrers, the circuit court did not conduct a judicial\r\n      review of internal hospital rules. The question to be decided is not\r\n      whether the rules are valid or reasonable or medically sound, but\r\n      whether the rules were imposed in furtherance of a conspiracy, the\r\n      primary purpose of which was to injure the plaintiffs. If the\r\n      complaints, liberally construed, allege such a conspiracy, it is\r\n      irrelevant that the Hospital has the legal right to restrict staff\r\n      privileges and that its rules are not subject to judicial review.\r\n\r\nId. at 9â€“10, 344 S.E.2d at 381.\r\n\r\n       Appellant now contends that the Lee decision does not stand for the\r\nproposition that a party must make a claim for civil conspiracy to avoid dismissal\r\nfor lack of subject matter jurisdiction to review a hospital's staff decisions.\r\nTherefore, she contends that the Summary Judgment Order is erroneous as a matter\r\nof law because it \"circumvents the clear ruling of the Lee Court by interpreting the\r\n\r\n\r\n      Hospital, 275 S.C. 203, 268 S.E.2d 580 (1980), cert. denied, 449 U.S.\r\n      1062 (1980), we affirmed our view that the implementation of the\r\n      regulations of a private hospital which are initiated to restrict a\r\n      practitioner's practices are not subject to judicial review. We stated\r\n      that we would not \"depart from the longstanding principle that such\r\n      action [by the hospital] is not subject to judicial review.\" Gowan, 275\r\n      S.C. at 204, 268 S.E.2d at 581 (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n292 S.C. at 405, 356 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n\nopinion as meant only to apply to cases in which the [p]laintiff has alleged civil\r\nconspiracy.\"\r\n\r\n       While we agree with the gravamen of Appellant's argument that Lee might\r\nnot be limited to claims of civil conspiracy, the import of Lee is that any claim\r\ninvolving staffing decisions made by a private hospital must require review beyond\r\nthe internal procedures, e.g. bylaws, of a private hospital, to fall within an\r\nexception to the general rule that courts will not delve into a hospital's internal\r\naffairs with regard to credentialing or other staffing decisions. Here, despite her\r\nattempt to characterize her claims as a challenge to the Settlement Agreement, in\r\nour view, Appellant's lawsuit constitutes another attempt on her part to get at the\r\nheart of the hospital's internal procedures and staffing decisions. At its core,\r\nAppellant's lawsuit challenges staff decisions made after the Hospital complied\r\nwith the express terms of the Settlement Agreement. No review of the Hospital's\r\ndecisions can be had here without reviewing the Hospital's 2006 and 2008\r\nprivileging decisions and its by-laws.15\r\n\r\n15Even Appellant's complaint proclaims that Respondents breached a duty to\r\nAppellant \"by attempting (successfully to date) to block [Appellant] from being\r\nable to seek review of its decision to deny her application for advancement in staff\r\nprivileges in violation of the letter and the spirit of the applicable bylaws.\"\r\n(Emphasis added). Likewise, during a later hearing, Appellant characterized the\r\narguments contained in her complaint as follows:\r\n\r\n      [Respondents] claim[] that a settlement agreement executed by the\r\n      parties which required that [Appellant] be reappointed to the\r\n      consulting staff in 2002 precludes [Appellant] from suing in this case\r\n      because she was, actually, reappointed to the consulting staff in 2002.\r\n      [Respondents] misinterpret[] the complaint, which should be clear on\r\n      its face. [Appellant] was given two rights under the former agreement.\r\n      One was to be reappointed to the consulting staff in 2002 for two\r\n      years. The other, as [Respondents] explain[] in [their] own brief, was\r\n      that [Appellant] would have the right to apply for a change in status\r\n      pursuant to the by-laws. It is the denial of [Appellant's] right to apply\r\n      for a change in status pursuant to the by-laws which is the basis of her\r\n      claims in this case.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\n\n       Therefore, because Appellant again attempts to challenge the internal\r\ndecision-making process of the Hospital with respect to staff credentials, which has\r\nbeen already adjudicated as clearly improper under our jurisprudence, Appellant's\r\nlawsuit lacked merit from the outset. Accordingly, we affirm the circuit court's\r\ngrant of summary judgment to Respondents. Moreover, we find that Respondents\r\nwere justified in seeking sanctions against Appellant here because there was\r\nclearly no \"good faith argument for an extension, modification, or reversal of the\r\nexisting law,\" especially in light of Judge Dennis's prior ruling in the 2005 lawsuit.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(J).\r\n\r\n     III.    Timing\r\n\r\n        Despite obvious preservation issues,16 Appellant argues that to allow the\r\ncircuit court to determine whether a claim is frivolous on a motion for sanctions\r\nunder the FCPSA while the order dismissing the case is under appeal creates a\r\nconflict with the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules, and causes unnecessary\r\nlitigation. Appellant contends that this conflict may be resolved by requiring\r\ncircuit courts confronted with this situation to stay their consideration of frivolity\r\nuntil after the resolution of the appeal of the underlying dispositive judgment. To\r\nthe contrary, Respondents contend that the circuit court acted within its discretion\r\nby hearing Respondents' motion for sanctions after Appellant filed her notice of\r\nappeal. We agree.\r\n\r\n       Motions made pursuant to the FCPSA are post-trial motions. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. 15-36-10(C)(1) (Supp. 2012) (\"At the conclusion of a trial and after a verdict\r\nfor or a verdict against damages has been rendered or a case has been dismissed by\r\na directed verdict, summary judgment, or judgment notwithstanding the verdict,\r\nupon motion of the prevailing party, the court shall proceed to determine if the\r\nclaim or defense was frivolous.\"). As such, a party has ten days after the filing of a\r\ncourt order to file a motion pursuant to the FCPSA. See In re Beard, 359 S.C. 351,\r\n357, 597 S.E.2d 835, 838 (Ct. App. 2004) (referring to motions made under the\r\n\r\n16Appellant failed to raise the conflict she proposes between the South Carolina\r\nAppellate Court Rules and the FCPSA before the circuit court in either her brief\r\nopposing sanctions, at the hearing, in her proposed order, or in her motion to\r\nreconsider. See Pye v. Estate of Fox, 369 S.C. 555, 564, 633 S.E.2d 505, 510\r\n(2006) (\"It is well settled that an issue cannot be raised for the first time on appeal,\r\nbut must have been raised to and ruled upon by the trial court to be preserved.\").\r\n\nFCPSA as \"post-trial motions for sanctions\" and finding that the general ten-day\r\nlimitation for post-trial motions applies to motion made pursuant to the FCPSA);\r\nPitman v. Republic Leasing Co., 351 S.C. 429, 432â€“33, 570 S.E.2d 187, 189â€“90\r\n(Ct. App. 2002) (\"Absent specific statutory language vesting the trial judge with\r\ncontinuing jurisdiction, we refuse to hold that a trial judge retains jurisdiction to\r\nconsider a motion for sanctions beyond ten days after entry of the judgment. Such\r\nan interpretation would run counter to our established case law that a trial judge\r\nloses jurisdiction over a case when the time to file post-trial motions has\r\nelapsed.\"); Rutland v. Holler, Dennis, Corbett, Ormond & Garner (Law Firm), 371\r\nS.C. 91, 96, 637 S.E.2d 316, 319 (Ct. App. 2006) (\"[B]ecause a trial judge retains\r\njurisdiction pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, to alter or amend a judgment within\r\nten days of its issuance, a motion for sanctions would be timely if filed within ten\r\ndays of judgment.\" (alteration in original)).17\r\n\r\n      Nevertheless, Appellant contends that the requirement that a motion\r\npursuant to the FCPSA be made within ten days of a final judgment conflicts with\r\nRule 241(a), SCACR, which provides:\r\n\r\n      As a general rule, the service of a notice of appeal in a civil matter\r\n      acts to automatically stay matters decided in the order, judgment,\r\n      decree or decision on appeal, and to automatically stay the relief\r\n      ordered in the appealed order, judgment, or decree or decision. This\r\n      automatic stay continues in effect for the duration of the appeal unless\r\n      lifted by order of the lower court, the administrative tribunal, appellate\r\n      court, or judge or justice of the appellate court. The lower court or\r\n      administrative tribunal retains jurisdiction over matters not affected by\r\n      the appeal including the authority to enforce any matters not stayed by\r\n      the appeal.\r\n\r\n       Appellant argues that the circuit court should have awarded sanctions prior\r\nto the outcome on appeal of the order upon which the sanctions were based, or the\r\nSummary Judgment Order. However, this Court has held that the filing of a notice\r\nof appeal does not deprive the circuit court of jurisdiction to consider a timely\r\npost-trial motion. See, e.g., Hudson v. Hudson, 290 S.C. 215, 215, 349 S.E.2d 341,\r\n341 (1986). For example, in Hudson, the order appealed was filed on March 18,\r\n1986, and a notice of appeal was filed on March 24, 1986. Id. On March 27,\r\n\r\n17\r\n Appellant concedes in her brief that 10 days is the appropriate time to file a\r\nmotion for sanctions.\r\n\n1986, timely post-trial motions were made pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP. Id. at\r\n215â€“16, 349 S.E.2d at 341. Holding \"that the service and filing of a Notice of\r\nAppeal before the filing of timely post-trial motions under Rule 59 by any party\r\ndoes not deprive the lower court of jurisdiction to consider the motions,\" id. at 216,\r\n349 S.E.2d at 341, the Court ordered the notice of appeal to be dismissed without\r\nprejudice as prematurely filed, id. at 216, 349 S.E.2d at 341â€“42 (\"[I]n the event\r\ntimely post-trial motions are filed under Rule 59, simultaneously with or\r\nsubsequent to the filing of a Notice of Appeal, the appellant shall notify the Clerk\r\nof this Court in writing. Upon receipt of such notice, the appeal shall be dismissed\r\nwithout prejudice. Any party can appeal within ten (10) days after the order\r\ndisposing of the post-trial motions. A second filing fee will not be collected from a\r\nparty who previously appealed.\" (footnote omitted)). This way, all ancillary\r\nmatters can be timely heard, and appealed, if necessary, in an efficient and\r\nwholesale manner, and not, as Appellant suggests, in a piecemeal fashion.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, Appellant's contention that the FCPSA and the South Carolina\r\nAppellate Court Rules contain conflicting terms lacks merit, and the circuit court\r\nacted properly and well within its jurisdiction in hearing Respondents' sanctions\r\nmotion, even though Appellant already had filed a Notice of Appeal in this case.\r\n\r\n   IV.       The Constitutionality of the FCPSA\r\n\r\n      Appellant argues that the FCPSA is unconstitutional. Respondents contend\r\nthat Appellant's \"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\" approach must fail her because\r\nshe did not preserve her arguments for review in the circuit court and because her\r\narguments lack merit.\r\n\r\n       We agree with Respondents that Appellant did not preserve most of her\r\nconstitutional arguments for review. Appellant never argued the following to the\r\ncircuit court: (1) that the FCPSA is redundant to a claim for abuse of process or a\r\nrequest for sanctions under Rule 11, SCRCP; (2) that the FCPSA deprives litigants\r\nof their rights to a jury trial; or (3) that the FCPSA violates the prohibition against\r\ndouble jeopardy. Finally, Appellant raised her argument that the FCPSA\r\nconstitutes an unconstitutional inhibition on free speech for the first time in her\r\nmotion to reconsider the Sanctions Order. Therefore, we will not consider the\r\nmerits of those arguments.\r\n\r\n      With respect to her due process argument, despite Respondents' assertion to\r\nthe contrary, Appellant did argue this issue to the circuit court and again raised it in\r\n\nher motion for reconsideration of the Sanctions Order. Appellant argues that the\r\nFCPSA denies litigants procedural due process because \"the pro se litigant or non-\r\nattorney party is held to a standard of expertise which the layperson and affected\r\nparty do not possess.\" Respondents contend that Appellant lacks standing to bring\r\nthis argument, and regardless, the FCPSA provides constitutionally adequate\r\nprocedural due process.\r\n\r\n       We agree with Respondent that Appellant lacks standing to bring this\r\nargument because she is a licensed attorney in good standing with the South\r\nCarolina Bar. In addition, Appellant has been represented in this action by a\r\nlicensed attorney. As such, Appellant cannot test the constitutionality of the statute\r\nfrom the standpoint of a pro se litigant or non-attorney party. See United States v.\r\nRaines, 362 U.S. 17, 21 (1960) (\"[O]ne to whom application of a statute is\r\nconstitutional will not be heard to attack the statute on the ground that impliedly it\r\nmight also be taken as applying to other persons or other situations in which its\r\napplication might be unconstitutional.\" (citations omitted)).\r\n\r\n   V. Sanctions\r\n\r\n       Appellant also argues that she should not be subject to sanctions because she\r\nwas competently represented by counsel in these proceedings, and section 15-36-\r\n10's \"reasonable attorney\" standard has been met, precluding a finding of frivolity.\r\n\r\n      Under the FCPSA,\r\n\r\n      An attorney or pro se litigant participating in a civil or administrative\r\n      action or defense may be sanctioned for:\r\n\r\n             (a) filing a frivolous pleading, motion, or document if:\r\n\r\n                   (i) the person has not read the frivolous pleading,\r\n                   motion, or document;\r\n\r\n                   (ii) a reasonable attorney in the same\r\n                   circumstances would believe that under the facts,\r\n                   his claim or defense was clearly not warranted\r\n                   under existing law and that a good faith or\r\n                   reasonable argument did not exist for the\r\n                   extension, modification, or reversal of existing\r\n\n                   law;\r\n\r\n                   (iii) a reasonable attorney presented with the same\r\n                   circumstances would believe that the procurement,\r\n                   initiation, continuation, or defense of a civil cause\r\n                   was intended merely to harass or injure the other\r\n                   party; or\r\n\r\n                   (iv) a reasonable attorney presented with the same\r\n                   circumstances would believe the pleading, motion,\r\n                   or document is frivolous, interposed for merely\r\n                   delay, or merely brought for any purpose other\r\n                   than securing proper discovery, joinder of parties,\r\n                   or adjudication of the claim or defense upon which\r\n                   the proceedings are based;\r\n\r\n             (b) making frivolous arguments a reasonable attorney\r\n             would believe were not reasonably supported by the\r\n             facts; or\r\n\r\n             (c) making frivolous arguments that a reasonable attorney\r\n             would believe were not warranted under the existing law\r\n             or if there is no good faith argument that exists for the\r\n             extension, modification, or reversal of existing law.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(A)(4)(a)â€“(c) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n        To begin with, Appellant argues that she cannot be sanctioned under the\r\nFCPSA because she was represented by competent counsel in these proceedings.\r\nUnder the prior iteration of the FCPSA, section 15-36-20 provided that \"[a]ny\r\nperson who takes part in the procurement, initiation, continuation, or defense of\r\ncivil proceedings must be considered to have acted to secure a proper purpose . . .\r\nif he reasonably believes in the existence of the facts upon which his claim is based\r\nand . . . (2) relies upon the advice of counsel, sought in good faith and given after\r\nfull disclosure of all facts within his knowledge and information which may be\r\nrelevant to the cause of action . . . .\" See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-20 (2005).\r\nThere is no corresponding provision in the amended version of the FCPSA. See\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10 (Supp. 2012). However, the new version of the\r\nFCPSA repeatedly speaks in terms of sanctioning a \"party\" in addition to an\r\n\nattorney or pro se litigant. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(C)(1) (stating\r\n\"[a]n attorney, party, or pro se litigant shall be sanctioned . . . .\"). Thus, we must\r\npresume that the legislature intended for a party, even a party represented by\r\ncounsel, to be sanctionable under the FCPSA.18 See Vernon v. Harleysville Mut.\r\nCas. Co., 244 S.C. 152, 157, 135 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1964) (\"It will be presumed that\r\nthe Legislature in adopting an amendment to a statute intended to make some\r\nchange in the existing law.\").\r\n\r\n      Appellant further contends that sanctions were unwarranted here.\r\n\r\n      Under the FCPSA:\r\n\r\n      (1) An attorney, party, or pro se litigant shall be sanctioned for a\r\n      frivolous claim or defense if the court finds the attorney, party, or pro\r\n      se litigant failed to comply with one of the following conditions:\r\n\r\n             (a) a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances\r\n             would believe that under the facts, his claim or defense\r\n             was clearly not warranted under existing law and that a\r\n             good faith or reasonable argument did not exist for the\r\n             extension, modification, or reversal of existing law;\r\n\r\n             (b) a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances\r\n             would believe that his procurement, initiation,\r\n             continuation, or defense of the civil suit was intended\r\n             merely to harass or injure the other party; or\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n18 The dissent would not award sanctions against Appellant alone. We disagree.\r\nWe call attention to the circumstances of this particular case. In December 2009,\r\nthis Court ordered all clerks of court to refuse filings from Appellant, unless she\r\nwas represented by a licensed attorney (other than herself), due to her vexatious\r\nand meritless filings. See Doe v. Duncan, S.C. Sup. Ct. Order dated Dec. 2, 2009\r\n(Appellate Case No. 2009-115446). Consequently, counsel graciously agreed to\r\nrepresent Appellant. However, Appellant drove this lawsuit (and many others)\r\nwith the knowledge that she did not have a claim. As an attorney, she is familiar\r\nwith the law and understands the court system, yet has continuously pursued\r\nfrivolous proceedings. Thus, counsel, merely assisting her in filing papers with the\r\ncourt, should not also be penalized under these facts.\r\n\n             (c) a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances\r\n             would believe that the case or defense was frivolous as\r\n             not reasonably founded in fact or was interposed merely\r\n             for delay, or was merely brought for a purpose other than\r\n             securing proper discovery, joinder of proposed parties, or\r\n             adjudication of the claim or defense upon which the\r\n             proceedings are based.\r\n\r\n      (2) Unless the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that an\r\n      attorney, party, or pro se litigant engaged in advancing a frivolous\r\n      claim or defense, the attorney, party, or pro se litigant shall not be\r\n      sanctioned.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(C)(1)â€“(2). The sanctioning court is entitled to\r\nconsider the following in awarding sanctions:\r\n\r\n      (1) the number of parties;\r\n\r\n      (2) the complexity of the claims and defenses;\r\n\r\n      (3) the length of time available to the attorney, party, or pro se litigant\r\n      to investigate and conduct discovery for alleged violations of the\r\n      provisions of subsection (A)(4);\r\n\r\n      (4) information disclosed or undisclosed to the attorney, party, or pro\r\n      se litigant through discovery and adequate investigation;\r\n\r\n      (5) previous violations of the provisions of this section;\r\n\r\n      (6) the response, if any, of the attorney, party, or pro se litigant to the\r\n      allegation that he violated the provisions of this section; and\r\n\r\n      (7) other factors the court considers just, equitable, or appropriate\r\n      under the circumstances.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(E)(1)â€“(7). Moreover, \"[i]n determining whether\r\nsanctions are appropriate or the severity of a sanction, the court shall consider\r\nprevious violations of the provisions of this section.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-\r\n10(F).Nevertheless, Appellant argues that she should not be subject to sanctions\r\nunder section 15-36-10(J), which provides the FCPSA \"shall not apply where an\r\n\nattorney or pro se litigant establishes a basis to proceed with litigation, or to assert\r\nor controvert an issue therein, that is not frivolous, which includes a good faith\r\nargument for an extension, modification, or reversal of the existing law.\"\r\n\r\n       Here, the circuit court sanctioned Appellant because she continued the\r\nlawsuit despite a prior ruling that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction,\r\ndespite previously receiving sanctions for arguing that the court lacked jurisdiction\r\nbased on the exact same allegations, and despite Respondents' compliance with the\r\nplain language of the Hospital's by-laws.\r\n\r\n        Because \"the decision whether to impose sanctions under the FCPSA is a\r\ndecision for the judge, not the jury, it sounds in equity rather than at law.\" Father\r\nv. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs., 353 S.C. 254, 260, 578 S.E.2d 11, 14 (2003) (refusing\r\nto adopt the more deferential \"abuse of discretion\" federal standard of review in\r\nassessing decisions to impose sanctions under the FCPSA). Therefore, an\r\nappellate court must review the findings of fact with respect to the decision to\r\ngrant sanctions under the FCPSA by \"taking its own view of the evidence.\" Id.\r\n(citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5); see also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 (Supp. 2012).\r\nHowever, \"[t]he 'abuse of discretion' standard . . . does . . . play a role in the\r\nappellate review of a sanctions award.\" Father, 353 S.C. at 261, 578 S.E.2d at 14.\r\nFor example, \"where the appellate court agrees with the trial court's findings of\r\nfact, it reviews the decision to award sanctions, as well as the terms of those\r\nsanctions, under an abuse of discretion standard.\" Ex parte Gregory, 378 S.C. 430,\r\n437, 663 S.E.2d 46, 50 (2008) (citation omitted); Se. Site Prep, L.L.C. v. Atl. Coast\r\nBuilders & Contractors, L.L.C., 394 S.C. 97, 104, 713 S.E.2d 650, 654 (Ct. App.\r\n2011). \"An abuse of discretion occurs where the decision is controlled by an error\r\nof law or is based on unsupported factual conclusions.\" Father, 353 S.C. at 261,\r\n578 S.E.2d at 14.\r\n\r\n       In our view, Judge Harrington was warranted in ordering sanctions in this\r\ncase, especially because Appellant, a licensed attorney, made identical legal\r\narguments in the 2005 litigation and did not prevail on the merits. Appellant has\r\ncontinuously and repeatedly challenged the Hospital's credentialing decisions\r\nwithout any legal basis to do so, and in the process, has cost the Hospital untold\r\namounts of time and resources in defending these claims. Therefore, we further\r\nfind that Judge Harrington was warranted in enjoining Appellant from filing any\r\nfuture claims in the circuit court without first posting bond.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we affirm the award of sanctions under the FCPSA.\r\n\n                                CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n      Based on the foregoing, both the Summary Judgment Order and the\r\nSanctions Order are\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J.,\r\nconcurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We consolidated appeals from a 2011 order\r\ngranting respondents summary judgment and from a 2012 order sanctioning\r\nthe appellant pursuant to the Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act\r\n(FCPSA).19 I would affirm the summary judgment order but reverse the\r\nsanctions order.\r\nAppellant is represented in this case by a well-respected member of the bar.20\r\nThe sanctions were imposed on appellant as a party based upon a number of\r\nfindings by the trial judge. As explained below, I do not find that any of the\r\nbases relied upon by the circuit court support the imposition of sanctions on\r\nappellant.\r\nThe FCPSA allows for sanctions at two different points in litigation. First,\r\nthe statute provides that an attorney or pro se litigant who signs a pleading\r\ncertifies that a reasonable attorney in the same circumstances would believe\r\nthat under the facts his claim may be warranted by a good faith extension of\r\nthe law, is not intended to harass the other party, and is not brought for any\r\nimproper purpose. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-36-10(A)(1) (Supp. 2012). A\r\nviolation of subsection (A) may result in the lawyer or pro se litigant being\r\nsanctioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second point at which the FCPSA provides for sanctions is set forth in Â§\r\n15-36-10(C). Section (C) provides that after a verdict, a directed verdict, or\r\na judgment non obstante veredicto has been entered a party,21 an attorney, or\r\na pro se litigant may be sanctioned if that individual \"engaged in advancing a\r\nfrivolous claim or defense.\" While subsection (A) is concerned with\r\nfrivolous filings, subsection (C) permits sanctions only where it is\r\n\r\n\r\n   S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-36-10 et seq. (Supp. 2012).\r\n19 As explained infra I interpret the FCSPA differently than does the majority and\r\n20\r\n\r\n\r\nconclude that no sanction is appropriate against appellant who is merely a party in\r\nthis case. The interpretation the Court adopts today will apply to every request for\r\nsanctions under the FCSPA, and I do not believe that we can create a special rule\r\nbecause a litigant is also an attorney even if that individual has a history with the\r\ncourt system.\r\n   I do not agree with the majority that the FCPSA \"repeatedly speaks in terms of\r\n21\r\n\r\n\r\nsanctioning a \"party\" in addition to an attorney or pro se litigant.\"\r\n\ndetermined, after factual findings are made, that a frivolous claim or defense\r\nwas advanced. I would not find those circumstances present here.\r\nIn my view, subsection (C) permits the party herself to be sanctioned only\r\nwhere the evidence adduced at the trial, or submitted at summary judgment,\r\nreveals factual misrepresentations or omissions on the part of that party, not\r\npreviously known to her attorney, which establish that the party's position in\r\nthe litigation is frivolous. If the attorney learns of these facts but allows the\r\nclaim or defense to continue, then she too is subject to sanctions under (C).\r\nWhere the sanction rests upon facts known to both the lawyer and the party at\r\nthe time the suit is brought, I would hold no sanction against the party alone\r\nis permissible under subsection (C).22 Similarly, I would not read subsection\r\n(C) to authorize sanctions upon a party because her attorney's argument\r\nagainst legal precedent was deemed not to have been made in good faith or\r\nbecause the trial judge finds no substantive discovery was undertaken.\r\nThe order finds the present lawsuit restates allegations made and denied in a\r\n2005 action. It concludes that had appellant \"even cursorily reviewed her\r\nprevious filings, prior Court orders, the Settlement Agreement, and the\r\nBylaws prior to filing this lawsuit, it would have shown her the\r\nunreasonableness of her actions.\" (emphasis supplied). The order goes on to\r\nstate that appellant \"was in possession of or had access to the dispositive\r\nfacts- the 1999 federal suit complaint, the 2009 state court complaint, the\r\nSettlement Agreement, the 2005 filings, the prior Court orders, and the\r\nBylaws- since before she filed this action.\" I would hold that because this\r\nground rests on public facts known to both appellant and her attorney at the\r\ntime the suit was brought, and because it punishes appellant for bringing the\r\nsuit, that if a sanction were to be imposed under the FCPSA for this conduct,\r\nit must be imposed under subsection (A) on the lawyer who signed the\r\npleadings. A member of the bar reviewed these facts and determined that he\r\ncould bring the suit without running afoul of the FCPSA or Rule 11, SCRCP.\r\nUnder these circumstances, no FCSPA sanction should be imposed on the\r\nparty under Â§15-36-10(C). The order also sanctions appellant for contending\r\n\r\n  For purposes of my analysis, it matters not that appellant is also an attorney. She\r\n22\r\n\r\n\r\nchose not to represent herself but employed an attorney who brought this suit with\r\nfull knowledge of the prior proceedings and history of the parties, and was\r\nsanctioned solely in her capacity as a party.\r\n\nthat the Settlement Agreement had been breached and then failing to produce\r\nevidence of any breach, and for failing to conduct any quasi-substantive\r\ndiscovery \"until the eve of the summary judgment hearing. . . .\" Again, these\r\nalleged delicts should be laid at the feet of the attorney and not the party.\r\n Finally, the judge appears to have read Lee v. Chesterfield Gen. Hosp. Inc.,\r\n289 S.C. 6, 344 S.E.2d 379 (Ct. App. 1986) as limited to civil conspiracy\r\nclaims, and to have concluded on that basis that no reasonable attorney would\r\nhave argued for its extension to these facts. 23 I would not hold appellant\r\nliable for failing to anticipate that the legal argument for distinguishing the\r\nLee case would be deemed not to have been made in good faith, nor would I\r\nuphold a sanction that rests, in part, on the trial judge's limited reading of the\r\nholding in Lee. In my view, the conclusion that it was not reasonable to\r\nargue for Lee's extension addresses the attorney's conduct and not the client's,\r\nand therefore I would hold it is insufficient to form the basis for sanctioning a\r\nparty under subsection (C).\r\nFor the reasons given above, I would affirm the grant of summary judgment\r\nbut reverse the sanction award.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     The majority agrees with appellant that \"Lee might not be [so]limited. . . . \"\r\n23\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27371","title":"SCDSS v.

Hodges, of Anderson, for Respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n      JUSTICE BEATTY: This is an expedited appeal by a mother in a\r\ntermination of parental rights (TPR) case.1 The family court terminated\r\nAppellant's parental rights to her two minor sons and denied Appellant's motion to\r\ndismiss, in which she challenged the constitutionality of section 63-7-2570(1) of\r\nthe South Carolina Code. On appeal, Appellant contends the TPR statute violates\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment and is void for vagueness. We affirm.\r\n\r\n1   Robert L. is not a party to this appeal.\r\n\n                                      I. FACTS\r\n\r\n      Appellant is the biological mother of four children: a daughter and a son\r\nwho are now adults, and two minor sons who are the subject of this TPR action.\r\nAppellant and Robert L. (Biological Father) were previously married and lived in\r\nNorth Carolina. After the divorce, their two oldest children, then minors, alleged\r\nBiological Father had sexually abused them. Appellant reported the allegations to\r\nauthorities. A finding of abuse was made against Biological Father in North\r\nCarolina, and Appellant obtained custody of the children.\r\n\r\n       During this time, while Appellant was still living in North Carolina with her\r\nchildren, she met Kenneth G. (Stepfather) online. Stepfather lived in South\r\nCarolina. According to Appellant, Stepfather initially lied to her about his identity,\r\nand he was physically and sexually abusive to her when she went to visit him in\r\nSouth Carolina. For example, Stepfather demanded that Appellant perform sex\r\nacts for him via a webcam and that she include her daughter, and that Appellant\r\nhave sex with other men. However, Appellant continued to visit Stepfather,\r\nreportedly due to his threat to help Biological Father regain custody of the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n       Despite these incidents, Appellant married Stepfather. On their wedding\r\nnight, Stepfather raped Appellant's daughter in Appellant's presence. Appellant's\r\ndaughter thereafter had two children with Stepfather as a result of ongoing sexual\r\nabuse. Appellant has admitted that she was aware of the rape incident and the fact\r\nthat Stepfather is the biological father of her daughter's two children. In addition,\r\nAppellant has admitted that, on repeated occasions, she engaged in oral sex with\r\nher daughter and had sexual intercourse with her oldest son. Appellant has\r\nmaintained these acts occurred due to threats or coercion by Stepfather. However,\r\nthe incidents occurred over an extended period of time, and some of the incidents\r\noccurred via webcam when Stepfather was in another town. Appellant never\r\nreported any of this abuse to the police.\r\n\r\n       Appellant's three sons entered foster care on June 11, 2012 after the oldest\r\nson revealed to law enforcement that there had been sexual abuse in the home.2\r\nThe South Carolina Department of Social Services (DSS) filed a summons and\r\ncomplaint dated August 29, 2012 seeking the termination of Appellant's parental\r\nrights to her three sons. Appellant filed a motion to dismiss, arguing section 63-7-\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2   Stepfather was thereafter convicted of multiple charges of incest.\r\n\n2570(1), the TPR provision pled in this case, was impermissibly vague in violation\r\nof the Fourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\n       Appellant's oldest son was removed as a party because he turned eighteen\r\nprior to the hearing in this matter and was no longer subject to TPR. The matter\r\nproceeded as to Appellant's younger sons at a hearing held on April 4 and 5, 2013.\r\nBy order dated May 9, 2013, the family court terminated Appellant's parental\r\nrights to her two minor sons. The court found there was clear and convincing\r\nevidence they had been harmed as defined in section 63-7-20(4) of the South\r\nCarolina Code and, because of the severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, as\r\nprovided by section 63-7-2570(1), it was not reasonably likely that the home could\r\nbe made safe within twelve (12) months, and termination was in the children's best\r\ninterests. The family court denied Appellant's motion to dismiss the action based\r\non her allegation that section 63-7-2570(1) is unconstitutionally vague.\r\n\r\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       A state must prove a case for termination of parental rights by clear and\r\nconvincing evidence. Santosky v. Kramer, 455 U.S. 745 (1982); Richberg v.\r\nDawson, 278 S.C. 356, 296 S.E.2d 338 (1982). Upon review, this Court is entitled\r\nto make its own determination whether the grounds for termination are supported\r\nby clear and convincing evidence. S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Cochran, 364 S.C.\r\n621, 614 S.E.2d 642 (2005). However, this scope of review does not require this\r\nCourt to disregard the findings of the family court, which was in a better position\r\nto evaluate the credibility of the witnesses and assign weight to their testimony.\r\nCharleston Cnty. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Jackson, 368 S.C. 87, 627 S.E.2d 765 (Ct.\r\nApp. 2006).                   III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       On appeal, Appellant argues the family court erred in denying her motion to\r\ndismiss this TPR action because section 63-7-2570(1) violates the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Appellant asserts section 63-7-\r\n2570(1) is unconstitutionally vague and violates her procedural due process rights\r\nbecause it fails (1) to give sufficiently fair notice to one who would avoid its\r\nsanctions, and (2) to provide ascertainable standards to the trier of fact, here, the\r\nfamily court, in determining whether to terminate parental rights. In particular,\r\nAppellant points to the use of the undefined term \"severity\" in the statute and\r\nargues section 63-7-2570(1) \"permits [TPR] to be wantonly and freakishly meted\r\nout to a parent whose conduct is subjectively, arbitrarily and capriciously\r\n                              â€Š\r\ndetermined to be 'Severe[.]'\"\r\n\n       The United States Supreme Court has historically recognized \"that freedom\r\nof personal choice in matters of family life is a fundamental liberty interest\r\nprotected by the Fourteenth Amendment.\" Santosky, 455 U.S. at 753.\r\nAccordingly, parents have a fundamental liberty interest in the care, custody, and\r\nmanagement of their children. Id.; see also S.C. Dep't of Soc. Servs. v. Sarah W.,\r\n402 S.C. 324, 335, 741 S.E.2d 739, 745 (2013) (citing Santosky).\r\n\r\n      Statutes terminating parental rights must, therefore, comport with basic due\r\nprocess requirements guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. In re Maricopa\r\nCnty. Juvenile Action Nos. JS-5209 & JS-4963, 692 P.2d 1027, 1032 (Ariz. Ct.\r\nApp. 1984). \"A statute whose terms are vague and conclusory does not satisfy due\r\nprocess requirements.\" Id.\r\n\r\n      \"The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the constitutional\r\nprinciple that procedural due process requires fair notice and proper standards for\r\nadjudication.\" In re Anonymous Member of S.C. Bar, 392 S.C. 328, 335, 709\r\nS.E.2d 633, 637 (2011) (citation omitted); City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315 S.C. 146,\r\n152, 432 S.E.2d 470, 473 (1993) (citation omitted). Consequently, a statute may\r\nbe unconstitutionally vague where \"(1) it does not provide fair notice of the\r\nconduct proscribed,\" or \"(2) it confers on the trier of fact unstructured and\r\nunlimited discretion to determine whether an offense has been committed[.]\" In re\r\nGentry, 369 N.W.2d 889, 893 (Mich. Ct. App. 1985).3 In the current appeal,\r\nAppellant makes both of these contentions as to section 63-7-2570(1).\r\n\r\n       This Court begins with a presumption of constitutionality. Curtis v. State,\r\n345 S.C. 557, 569, 549 S.E.2d 591, 597 (2001) (\"This Court has a limited scope of\r\nreview in cases involving a constitutional challenge to a statute because all statutes\r\nare presumed constitutional and, if possible, will be construed to render them\r\nvalid.\"). \"[A] legislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless its\r\n\r\n\r\n3 A statute may also be challenged on a third basis not at issue hereâ€”that \"its\r\ncoverage is overbroad and impinges on First Amendment freedoms.\" In re Gentry,\r\n369 N.W.2d at 893; see also Grayned v. City of Rockford, 408 U.S. 104, 108-09\r\n(1972) (stating vague laws infringe upon several important values, including\r\n(1) the need for notice, (2) the need for explicit standards, and (3) First\r\nAmendment considerations). The traditional rule of standing is relaxed for\r\noverbreadth claims involving First Amendment rights, where a party \"simply must\r\ndemonstrate that the statute could cause someone elseâ€”anyone elseâ€”to refrain\r\nfrom constitutionally protected expression.\" In re Amir X.S., 371 S.C. 380, 384,\r\n639 S.E.2d 144, 146 (2006).\r\n\nrepugnance to the Constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.\" Id. at 570,\r\n549 S.E.2d at 597.\r\n\r\n       \"A law is unconstitutionally vague if it forbids or requires the doing of an act\r\nin terms so vague that a person of common intelligence must necessarily guess as\r\nto its meaning and differ as to its application.\" In re Anonymous Member of S.C.\r\nBar, 392 S.C. at 335, 709 S.E.2d at 637 (citing Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d\r\nat 598). \"[A]ll the Constitution requires is that the language convey sufficiently\r\ndefinite warnings as to the proscribed conduct when measured by common\r\nunderstanding and practices.\" Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 599; cf.\r\nMaricopa, 692 P.2d at 1034 (\"The requirement that statutory language must be\r\nreasonably certain is satisfied 'by the use of ordinary terms which find adequate\r\ninterpretation in common usage and understanding,' or if the term can be given\r\nmeaning by reference to other definable sources.\" (internal citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       \"The constitutionality of a statute must be considered in light of the standing\r\nof the party who seeks to raise the question and of its particular application . . . .\"\r\nTown of Mount Pleasant v. Chimento, 401 S.C. 522, 535 n.7, 737 S.E.2d 830, 839\r\nn.7 (2012) (citation omitted). \"Standing is not a separate issue when the\r\nconstitutionality of a statute is challenged under the due process clause, but is\r\ninstead the foundation of the inquiry.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       \"One whose conduct clearly falls within the statutory proscription does not\r\nhave standing to raise a void-for-vagueness challenge.\" Id. at 535, 737 S.E.2d at\r\n839; accord Curtis, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 598; see also In re Amir X.S.,\r\n371 S.C. 380, 385 n.2, 639 S.E.2d 144, 146 n.2 (2006) (stating the traditional rule\r\nof standing for constitutional attacks is that one to whom application of a statute is\r\nconstitutional may not attack the statute on the ground that it might be\r\nunconstitutional when applied to other people or situations (citing United States v.\r\nRaines, 362 U.S. 17, 21 (1971))). \"A statute's constitutionality is judged on an\r\nobjective, not subjective, basis.\" Chimento, 401 S.C. at 535 n.6, 737 S.E.2d at 838\r\nn.6.  Thus, when raising a claim of unconstitutional vagueness, the litigant must\r\ndemonstrate that the challenged statute is vague as applied to his own conduct,\r\nregardless of its potentially vague application to others. In re Hanks, 553 A.2d\r\n1171, 1176 (Del. 1989) (citing Aiello v. City of Wilmington, Del., 623 F.2d 845,\r\n850 (3d Cir. 1980)).\r\n\r\n      In the current appeal, Appellant points to section 63-7-2570(1)'s use of the\r\nword \"severity\" throughout her brief and contends the term is undefined and that\r\n\nthe statute provides no ascertainable standard for the trier of fact to make a TPR\r\ndetermination.4 Section 63-7-2570 of the South Carolina Code currently sets forth\r\neleven enumerated grounds for terminating a parent's rights and provides in\r\nrelevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n      The family court may order the termination of parental rights upon a\r\n      finding of one or more of the following grounds and a finding that\r\n      termination is in the best interest of the child:\r\n\r\n      (1) The child or another child while residing in the parent's domicile\r\n      has been harmed as defined in Section 63-7-20, and because of the\r\n      severity or repetition of the abuse or neglect, it is not reasonably\r\n      likely that the home can be made safe within twelve months. In\r\n      determining the likelihood that the home can be made safe, the\r\n      parent's previous abuse or neglect of the child or another child may be\r\n      considered.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-2570(1) (Supp. 2013) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n      Section 63-7-20(4) of the Code defines the terms \"child abuse or neglect\"\r\nand \"harm\" as used in the provision challenged here. It states in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      (4) \"Child abuse or neglect\" or \"harm\" occurs when the parent, \n\r\n      guardian, or other person responsible for the child's welfare:\n\r\n\r\n             (a) inflicts or allows to be inflicted upon the child physical or\r\n             mental injury or engages in acts or omissions which present a\r\n             substantial risk of physical or mental injury to the child, . . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n4  At the TPR hearing, Appellant argued the use of the terms \"severity\" and\r\n\"repetition\" made the statute unconstitutionally vague. However, on appeal to this\r\nCourt, her brief appears to have abandoned any reliance on the term \"repetition\"\r\nand she instead focuses on the term \"severity.\" In any event, the use of \"repetition\"\r\nin this context does not make the statute impermissibly vague as the undisputed\r\ntestimony, including Appellant's own admissions, demonstrates that Appellant\r\ncommitted repeated sexual acts with her daughter and her oldest son. \"Repetition\"\r\nis a word that should be given its ordinary dictionary meaning. See Webster's\r\nThird New International Dictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 1924\r\n(2002) (defining \"repetition\" as \"the act or an instance of repeating something that\r\none has already said or done\").\r\n\n             (b) commits or allows to be committed against the child a\r\n             sexual offense as defined by the laws of this State or engages in\r\n             acts or omissions that present a substantial risk that a sexual\r\n             offense as defined in the laws of this State would be committed\r\n             against the child[.]\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-7-20(4) (2010).\r\n\r\n        In its order, the family court specifically found there was clear and\r\nconvincing evidence that Appellant \"had [engaged in] repeated acts of sexual\r\nrelations with her [oldest] son . . . and [her] daughter . . . and that abuse was\r\nsevere.\" In addition, Appellant \"was present while her husband raped her daughter\r\n. . . and that abuse is severe.\" The court stated Appellant's oldest son and daughter\r\nwere subject to abuse in both North Carolina and South Carolina, and that \"[t]he\r\nchildren knew about the sexual abuse going on and that in itself is abuse and\r\nmental injury.\" The court found there was a substantial risk of harm for\r\nAppellant's two minor sons, and that it was \"not reasonably likely that the home\r\ncan be made safe within twelve (12) months.\" The court expressed concern that,\r\n\"[d]uring the testimony of [Appellant], at no time did she accept responsibility for\r\nthe abuse,\" and that Appellant had failed to adequately protect her children, who\r\nhad been abused by Appellant, Biological Father, and Stepfather. In these\r\ncircumstances, the court found the termination of Appellant's parental rights was in\r\nthe best interests of her minor sons. At the hearing in the matter, the family court\r\nfurther explained its reasoning as to the meaning of the terms used in the statute:\r\n\r\n      And severity, [] having sexual intercourse with your son, I mean, I\r\n      can't even believe I'm having to say this, . . . that is definitely severe\r\n      and I . . . don't see how anybody could interpret that any differently.\r\n      And having sexual intercourse with your daughter[;] being present\r\n      while your husband is raping your child. All of that would definitely\r\n      fall within the definition of severity and repetition.\r\n\r\n       We agree with the family court's observations and find Appellant has no\r\nstanding to pursue this constitutional challenge because Appellant's conduct clearly\r\nfalls within the parameters of the acts proscribed by section 63-7-2570(1). A\r\nstatute's words generally should be given their plain and ordinary meaning, and the\r\nonly appropriate description of the abuse in this case is that it was \"severe\" under\r\nany common understanding of the term. See Epstein v. Coastal Timber Co., 393\r\nS.C. 276, 285, 711 S.E.2d 912, 917 (2011) (\"Words in a statute must be given their\r\nplain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to\r\nlimit or expand the statute's application.\"); Webster's Third New International\r\n\nDictionary of the English Language, Unabridged 2081 (2002) (defining \"severity\"\r\nas the \"quality or state of being severe,\" and defining \"severe\" to mean \"of a great\r\ndegree or an undesirable or harmful extent,\" or \"inflicting physical discomfort or\r\nhardship,\" or \"inflicting pain or distress\"); see also People v. Weninger, 611\r\nN.E.2d 77, 83 (Ill. App. Ct. 1993) (\"A court will assume [] that the words used in a\r\nstatute have their ordinary and popularly understood meanings, absent a contrary\r\nlegislative intent. Also, in addition to the language used, consideration must be\r\ngiven to the legislative objective and the evil the statute is designed to remedy.\"\r\n(internal citations omitted)). Moreover, since it is undisputed that the abuse\r\noccurred multiple times, and the statute refers alternatively to the \"severity\" or the\r\n\"repetition\" of the abuse or neglect, Appellant's conduct falls within the realm of\r\nthe TPR statute due to the repetition of the abuse, regardless of its \"severity.\"\r\n\r\n                                IV. CONCLUSION\r\n       We conclude the family court properly denied Appellant's motion to dismiss\r\nthis TPR action based on her challenge to the constitutionality of section 63-7-\r\n2570(1). Because her conduct clearly falls within the parameters of the statute, she\r\nlacks standing to challenge the statute as being void for vagueness. Appellant does\r\nnot otherwise challenge the findings of the family court and its TPR decision, and\r\nwe hold those findings are supported by clear and convincing evidence and that\r\nTPR is in the best interests of the children. As a result, we affirm the order of the\r\nfamily court.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n    TOAL, C.J., HEARN, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"}]
