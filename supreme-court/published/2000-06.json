Bogle, Jr., and Henry B. Richardson, Jr., all of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Harry H. Nelson, of Greenville, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this judicial grievance matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent, a former magistrate for Greenville County who resigned on August 31, 1999, admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand. We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent, the most severe sanction we are able to impose in these circumstances. The facts in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFinancial Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn his capacity as a magistrate, respondent would set bond on defendants arrested by law enforcement authorities and collect bond when it was paid. Respondent was required to deposit the bond money into his magistrate bank account at Palmetto Bank, not more than five days after receipt of such funds. Respondent, however, engaged in a pattern of late submission of bond money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen three checks representing bond payments, written by respondent to the Chief Administrative Magistrate, were returned, Disciplinary Counsel contacted respondent to discuss how he attended to the bonds that he collected. Respondent informed Disciplinary Counsel that he had just deposited $3,000 into the magistrate account. When asked to identify the source of that $3,000, respondent replied that it came from a bureau drawer in his home where he kept all of his money.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent further explained that after performing night bond duty, he would place all cash on his person into that drawer. However, the cash in the drawer also represented money from his small business. Respondent further stated that he did not keep records as to which defendant had submitted what amount of money. He also commented that his personal money and the court's money could have mixed together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBank Account Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring respondent's tenure, he incurred ten insufficient funds fees on his official account, at $24 each, for a total of $240. On May 31, 1999, the account had a negative balance. However, respondent made several large deposits to the account in June 1999. The deposit slips respondent prepared did not identify a particular defendant with a particular bond, or state an identifying date. Although respondent had made those large deposits in June, a check sent by respondent to another magistrate was returned for insufficient funds on August 3, 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent had several deficiencies in his bookkeeping. Further, he wrote checks to other magistrates or clerks of court, but then failed to deliver or negotiate those checks until weeks later.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeminar Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent and a municipal court judge conducted two seminars, known as \"Summary Court Judges' Shoplifting Prevention Seminars.\" The fee to attend was $15 per person. Respondent filed an Annual Disclosure Statement of extra judicial income, but did not disclose income received from the seminars. He is exempt from the portion of the form requiring disclosure of extra judicial income because he was a part-time judge; however, he checked the block marked \"No\" as to extra: judicial compensation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDemeanor and Behavior Matters and Greenville County Detention Center Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFollowing complaints about respondent's use of tobacco products in areas of the Greenville County Detention Center where their use is forbidden, one day respondent demanded upon entry into the Center to be frisked prior to crossing the booking area of the Center. He demanded to have any contraband removed from his person and an inventory made of his personal property. He also demanded to be fingerprinted. Respondent did not give a reason for his demands and refused to answer any questions as to why this was to be done. After officers did as he demanded, respondent proceeded to get a soft drink from the lobby. After he returned to his office, another officer had to take respondent's personal belongings back to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn another occasion, respondent entered the Center and acted in a loud, disorderly, and vulgar manner to the Center's staff. Although tobacco products were not allowed in the Center, respondent brought tobacco products into the Center and used them within the premises. He was directed by the staff to cease using the tobacco products on that occasion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease of Defendants Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother magistrate set cash bonds on two defendants on September 8, 1997, and on one defendant on September 24, 1997. Respondent released the defendants on personal recognizance- bonds the same day the other magistrate had set cash bonds. He engaged in ex parte conversations concerning these bonds and did not give the State notice so that the State could be present and participate in those conversations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also made unnecessary and derogatory comments to the defendants expressing his low opinion of the Travelers Rest police department, and thereby demonstrated his bias against the arresting authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to an inquiry by Disciplinary Counsel, respondent provided false information. Further, respondent directed one defendant not to tell the police or the other magistrate that he was allowing her to sign her own bond.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another matter, a complainant wrote a letter concerning her estranged husband's arrest for harassment. Respondent allowed the estranged husband to be released on a personal recognizance bond. This was done without notice to the complainant, despite the husband's previous convictions for criminal domestic violence against her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another matter, a trooper arrested a defendant for a second offense of driving under the influence. Respondent directed the trooper to \"unarrest\" the defendant, and told the trooper in the presence of the defendant that respondent did not feel the defendant was impaired, disregarding the fact that the defendant's blood alcohol level had registered above .15. He further directed the trooper to convey his opinion concerning the innocence of the defendant to the trial judge who would hear the case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChild Custody Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent issued an order transferring the custody of a child. The order recited that it was in the \"Family Court\" and overrode a previous Family Court order concerning custody of the child. Respondent lacked authority to issue the relief granted to the extent that it dealt with a change in custody.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFemale Deputy Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA female deputy brought a prisoner before respondent for a bond hearing. Respondent made sexually oriented and inappropriate remarks to the deputy. The remarks included comments that she was attractive, that her appearance was sexually exciting, and that after seeing her, he would need to go home and take a cold shower. Respondent also remarked that other deputies \"wanted her,\" indicating that other personnel had a sexual interest in her.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn response to Disciplinary Counsel's inquiry, respondent was not truthful when he indicated that no such remarks were made to or in the presence of the deputy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBond Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA defendant was charged with not having a valid driver's license, operating a vehicle without insurance, and violating the alcohol open container laws, which are magistrate level offenses. In addition, the defendant was charged with the General Sessions offense of illegal possession of a pistol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe defendant appeared before respondent, who set bond at $1,000 for the General Sessions charge, and at $625 for the three magistrate level charges. Cash in those amounts was delivered to respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was required to deposit the funds he acquired from the defendant within five days of receipt, and then transmit the monies from his magistrate's account at the Palmetto Bank to the other magistrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Disciplinary Counsel's investigation, respondent's magistrate account check payable to the other magistrate, dated February 17, 1999, long after the date of the defendant's court appearance, was discovered unnegotiated in respondent's briefcase. The other magistrate never received the bond money from respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn February 17, 1999, respondent issued his magistrate's account check payable to the other magistrate in the amount of $1,000, representing the bond for the General Sessions offense. The Greenville County clerk of court, and the Detention Center have no knowledge as to the whereabouts of that bail money, which upon information and belief is still in the other magistrate's account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a result of his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct), Rule 7(a)(2)(failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority), and Rule 7(a)(4)(persistent failure to perform judicial duties or persistent performance of judicial duties in an incompetent or neglectful manner). Respondent has also violated the following provisions of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1(failure to uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary), Canon 2(A)(failure to respect and comply with the law, and failure to conduct himself in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary), Canon 3(B)(1)(failure to hear and decide matters assigned to him except those in which disqualification is required), Canon 3(B)(2)(failure to be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it), Canon 3(B)(4)(failure to act patient, dignified, and courteous to those with whom he dealt in his official capacity), Canon 3(B)(5)(failure to perform his duties without bias or prejudice), Canon 3(B)(7)(failure to refrain from engaging in ex parte communications), Canon 3(B)(8)(failure to dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently, and fairly), Canon 3(B)(9)(failure to refrain from making any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect a proceeding's outcome or impair its fairness), Canon 3(C)(1)(failure to diligently discharge his administrative responsibilities without bias and prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and failure to cooperate with other judges and court officials in the performance of their official duties), Canon 4(A)(failure to conduct extra judicial activities so that they would not raise doubt about his capacity to act impartially as a judge, demean the judicial office, or interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties), and Canon 4(B)(engaging in extra judicial activities concerning the law, the legal system, the administration of justice, and non-legal subjects).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe accept the agreement for a public reprimand because respondent is no longer a magistrate and because he has agreed not to hereafter seek another judicial position in South Carolina unless first authorized to do so by this Court. As previously noted, this is the strongest punishment we can give respondent given the fact that he has already resigned his duties as a magistrate. Accordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded for his conduct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25137","title":"In the Matter of Johnson","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25137","description":"","date":"2000-06-05","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Johnson\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Shirley L.

Condon, Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, and Henry B. Richardson, Jr., all of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Grover C. Seaton, III, of Moncks Corner, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement (RJDE), Rule 502, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a public reprimand. We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent. The facts set forth in the agreement are as follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbeyance Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1997, a defendant pled guilty to careless operation of a motor vehicle. Following defendant's guilty plea, respondent conducted a trial. She heard testimony and offered defendant the opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough defendant had pled guilty, respondent held his ticket in abeyance and then dismissed it a week later. The holding of the ticket in abeyance was an improper procedure under South Carolina law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1995 to 1997, respondent held other cases in abeyance. Respondent was following a practice which had been in place before she became a Municipal Court Judge. The cases held in abeyance were a minority of the total number of cases heard by her during that time, but respondent understands now that practice was not authorized under South Carolina law, and has discontinued the practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDisqualification Matter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1993, an arrest warrant was taken out against respondent's grandson by the mother of the grandson's girlfriend. Respondent heard the probable cause evidence against her grandson and signed the warrant against him. Respondent also conducted the bond hearing for her grandson on the same day. The Magistrate's Bench Book states that if a magistrate must disqualify herself, an interim judge may be appointed in place of the disqualified judge. No interim or replacement judge was obtained to consider the arrest warrant or the bond hearing.\r\nRespondent's grandson fell within the prohibition and relationship set forth in Canon 3(E)(1)(d) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, yet respondent did not disqualify herself. While respondent did disclose the family relationship to the girlfriend and the police officer involved, she did not follow the procedure required by Canon 3(F) of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR (requiring disclosure of the relationship and an agreement by the parties that the judge not be disqualified).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR (violation of the Code of Judicial Conduct).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, respondent has violated the following Canons from the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity arid independence of the judiciary), Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's activities), and Canon 3 (a judge shall perform the duties of judicial office impartially and diligently).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent's conduct warrants a public reprimand. Accordingly, respondent is hereby publicly reprimanded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25138","title":"John Doe, Alias v.

Sidney Connor, IV, of Kelaher, Connell &amp; Connor, P.C. of Surfside Beach, for petitioner.\r\n        Assistant Attorney General Jennifer A. Deitrick, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n        Disciplinary Counsel Henry B. Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for amicus curiae Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner sought to have the Court accept this matter in its original jurisdiction to determine whether certain tasks performed by a non-attorney employee in a law firm constitute the unauthorized practice of law. Specifically, petitioner asks (1) whether it is the unauthorized practice of law for a paralegal employed by an attorney to conduct informational seminars for the general public on wills and trusts without the attorney being present; (2) whether it is the unauthorized practice of law for a paralegal employed by an attorney to meet with clients privately at the attorney's office, answer general questions about wills and trusts, and gather basic information from clients; and (3) whether a paralegal can receive compensation from the paralegal's law firm/employer through a profit-sharing arrangement based upon the volume and type of cases the paralegal handles. The Office of the Attorney General filed a return opposing the petition for original jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court invoked its original jurisdiction to determine whether the paralegal's activities constituted the unauthorized practice of law, and, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-340 (1976), John W. Kittredge was appointed as referee to make findings of fact and conclusions of law concerning this matter. A hearing was held and the referee issued proposed findings and recommendations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe adopt the referee's findings and recommendations attached to this opinion and hold that a non-lawyer employee conducting unsupervised legal presentations for the public and answering legal questions for the public or for clients of the attorney/employer engages in the unauthorized practice of law. See State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 460 S.E.2d 576 (1995). We further hold that a proposed fee arrangement which compensates non-lawyer employees based upon the number and volume of cases the non-lawyer employee handles for an attorney violates the ethical rules against fee-splitting with non-lawyer employees. Rule 5.4 of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn the Supreme Court\r\n\r\nIN THE ORIGINAL JURISDICTIONOf the Supreme Court\r\n\r\nJohn Doe, Alias, Petitioner,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles M. Condon, Attorney General for the State of South Carolina Respondent.\r\n\r\nPROPOSED FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REFEREE\r\n\r\nThis is a declaratory judgment action in the Supreme Court's original jurisdiction. The Court referred this matter to me as Referee. Petitioner, a paralegal, has submitted a generalized list of tasks he wishes to perform and has inquired whether performing them constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. Petitioner also seeks a determination of the propriety of his proposed fee splitting arrangement with his attorney-employer. Despite my repeated offers for an evidentiary hearing, neither party requested a hearing. The record before me is sufficient to address and resolve whether the activities in question constitute the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find that a paralegal conducting unsupervised legal presentations for the public and answering legal questions from the audience engages in the unauthorized practice of law. Further, I find that a paralegal meeting individually with clients to answer estate planning questions engages in the unauthorized practice of law. Finally, I find the proposed fee arrangement is improper and violates the ethical prohibition against fee splitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner submitted the following questions to the Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1) Is it the unauthorized practice of law for a paralegal employed by an attorney to conduct educational seminars for the general public, to disseminate general information about wills and trusts, including specifically a fair and balanced emphasis on living trusts, including answering general questions, without the attorney being present at the seminar as long as the seminar is sponsored by the attorney's law firm and the attorney has reviewed and approved the format, materials and presentation to be made for content, truthfulness and fairness?\r\n  (2) Is it the unauthorized practice of law for a paralegal employed by an attorney to meet with clients privately in the law office for the purpose of answering general questions about wills, trusts, including specifically living trusts, and estate planning in general, and to gather basic information from said clients for such purposes as long as it is done under the attorney's direction, and the clients have a follow-up interview and meeting with the attorney who would have primary responsibility for legal decisions?\r\n  (3) Can a paralegal receive compensation from the law firm he is employed by, through a profit-sharing arrangement, which would be based upon the volume and type of cases the paralegal handled?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo protect the public from unsound legal advice and incompetent representation, South Carolina, like other jurisdictions, limits the practice of law to licensed attorneys. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-5-310 (1976). While case law provides general guidelines as to what constitutes the practice of law, courts are hesitant to define its exact boundaries. Thus, the analysis in 'practice of law' cases is necessarily fact-driven. The Supreme Court has specifically avoided addressing hypothetical situations, preferring instead to determine what constitutes the unauthorized practice of law on a case by case basis. In Re Unauthorized Practice of Law Rules Proposed by the South Carolina Bar, 309 S.C. 304, 422 S.E.2d 123 (S.C. 1992). I find that Petitioner's proposed actions constitute the unauthorized practice of law and that the proposed fee agreement violates the ethical prohibition against fee splitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Supreme Court has set forth a succinct standard of the proper role of paralegals:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The activities of a paralegal do not constitute the practice of law as long as they are limited to work of a preparatory nature, such as legal research, investigation, or the composition of legal documents, which enable the licensed attorney-employer to carry a given matter to a conclusion through his own examination, approval or additional effort. Matter of Easler, 275 S.C. 400, 272 S.E.2d 32, 33 (S.C. 1980).\r\n\r\nWhile the important support function of paralegals has increased through the years, the Easler guidelines stand the test of time. As envisioned in Easler, the paralegal plays a supporting role to the supervising attorney. Here, the roles are reversed. The attorney would support the paralegal. Petitioner would play the lead role, with no meaningful attorney supervision and the attorney's presence and involvement only surfaces on the back end. Meaningful attorney supervision must be present throughout the process. The line between what is and what is not permissible conduct by a non-attorney is oftentimes \"unclear\" and is a potential trap for the unsuspecting client. State v. Buyers Service Co.. Inc., 292 S.C. 426, 357 S.E.2d. 15,17 (S.C.1987). The conduct of the paralegal contemplated here clearly crosses the line into the unauthorized practice of law. It is well settled that a paralegal may not give legal advice, consult, offer legal explanations, or make legal recommendations. State v. Despain, 319 S.C. 317, 460 S.E.2d 576 (S.C. 1995).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Educational Seminars\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner intends to conduct unsupervised \"wills and trusts\" seminars for the public, \"emphasizing\" living trusts during the course of his presentation. Petitioner also plans to answer estate planning questions from the audience. I find Petitioner's proposed conduct constitutes the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI find, as other courts have, that the very structure of such \"educational\" legal seminars suggests that the presenter will actually be giving legal advice on legal matters. See, In Re Mid America Living Trust Assoc. Inc., 927 S.W. 2d 855 (Mo.banc 1996); People v. Volk, 805 P.2d 1116 (Colo. 1991); Oregon State Bar v. John H. Miller &amp; Co., 385 P.2d 181 (Or. 1963). At the very least, Petitioner will implicitly advise participants that they require estate planning services. Whether a will or trust is appropriate in any given situation is a function of legal judgment. To be sure, advising a potential client on his or her need for a living trust (or other particular estate planning instrument or device) fits squarely within the practice of law. These matters cry out for the exercise of professional judgment by a licensed attorney. Thus, in conducting these informational seminars, Petitioner would engage in the unauthorized practice of law as a non-attorney offering legal advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner plans to answer \"general\" questions during his presentation. I have reviewed the Estate Planning Summary submitted by Petitioner and his attorney-employer. This summary sets forth the subject matter to be covered by the paralegal. Petitioner would present information on, among other things, revocable trusts, irrevocable living trusts, credit shelter trusts, qualified terminable interest property trusts, charitable remainder trusts, qualified personal residence trusts, grantor retained annuity trusts, grantor retained unitrusts and charitable lead trusts. It is difficult to imagine such specific estate planning devices eliciting \"general\" questions or a scenario in which the exercise of legal judgment would not be involved. It is, after all, a legal seminar, apparently for the purpose of soliciting business.1To suggest that some \"plan\" would anticipate all possible questions with predetermined nonlegal responses is specious. And so complex is this area of law that many states, including South Carolina, have established stringent standards for an attorney to receive the designation of \"specialist\" in Estate Planning and Probate Law. SCACR, Part IV, Appendices D and E. This is the practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI fully recognize the prevailing popularity of 'financial planners' and others \"jump[ing] on the estate planning bandwagon.\" (Estate Planning Summary submitted by Petitioner's attorney employer, p. l). This trend in no way affects the decision before the Court. This paralegal would not be presenting the estate planning seminar as a financial planner. This seminar would be conspicuously sponsored by the paralegal's attorney-employer. The attorney's law firm is prominently displayed in the brochure submitted, e.g., name, address, telephone number and \"Firm Profile.\" In promoting the law firm and representing to the public the 'legal' nature of the seminar, neither the paralegal nor his attorney-employer can escape the prohibition against the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Initial Client Interview\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner intends to gather client information and answer general estate planning questions during his proposed \"initial client interviews.\" While Petitioner may properly compile client information, Petitioner may not answer estate planning questions. See Matter of Easler, supra. Petitioner's answering legal questions would constitute the unauthorized practice of law for the reasons stated above. While the law firm in which Petitioner is employed plans to direct clients to an attorney for \"follow-up\" consultations, a paralegal may not give legal advice in any event. Moreover, permissible preparatory tasks must be performed while under the attorney's supervision. The proposed after the fact attorney review comes too late.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. Compensation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner's law firm intends to compensate him based upon the volume and types of cases he \"handles.\" A paralegal, of course, may not \"handle\". any case. \r\n\r\n2  This fee arrangement directly violates Rule 5.4 of the Rules of Professional conduct, SCACR 407. \r\n\r\n3  This limitation serves to \"discourage the unauthorized practice of law by lay persons and to prevent a non-lawyer from acquiring a vested pecuniary interest in an attorney's disposition of a case that could possibly take preeminence over a client's best interest.\" Matter of Anonymous Member of the S.C.Bar, 295 S.C. 25, 26, 367 S.E.2d 17, 18 (S.C. 1998). This compensation proposal arrangement coupled with Petitioner's desire to market the law firm's services via the educational seminars and meet individually with clients creates a situation ripe for abuse. Indeed, the proposal by Petitioner presents the very evil Rule 5.4 was designed to avoid. Accordingly, I find Petitioner's proposed compensation plan violates both the letter and the spirit of Rule 5.4 prohibiting fee splitting with non-attorneys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECOMMENDATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1.  Offering legal presentations for the general public constitutes the practice of law.\r\n  2.  Answering estate planning questions in the context of legal seminars or in private client interviews constitutes the practice of law.\r\n  3.  Fee sharing arrangements with non-attorneys based on volume and cases \"handled\" by a paralegal violates Rule 5.4, Rules of Professional Conduct, SCACR 407.\r\n\r\nRESPECTFULLY SUBMITTED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n          \r\n            \r\n              \r\n                John W. Kittredge\r\n                  Referee\r\n                \r\n              \r\n            \r\n          \r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nApril 7, 2000Greenville, SC\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 While this marketing method may raise ethical implications for the attorney involved, the issue before me is whether the activities of the paralegal constitute the unauthorized practice of law. See Rule 7.3, Rules of Professional Conduct, 407 SCACR; Matter of Morris, 270 S.C. 308, 241 S.E.2d 911 (1978)(lawyer improperly solicited employment); Matter of Craven, 267 S.C. 33, 225 S.E. 2d 861 (1976) (an attorney's knowledge that his employee is engaged in solicitation of professional employment for attorney constitutes professional misconduct); Matter of Crosby, 256 S.C. 325, 182 S.E.2d 289 (1971) (attorney improperly solicited business). Thus, not only does Petitioner's solicitation of legal clients raise possible ethical concerns for his sponsoring attorney, Petitioner's involvement clearly constitutes the unauthorized practice of law. \r\n2The suggestion that Petitioner and the law firm intend for him to \"handle\" cases speaks volumes about the anticipated role of Petitioner, far beyond the permissible tasks performed by paralegals. \r\n3 Nonlawyer employees may certainly participate \"in a compensation or retirement plan, even though the plan is based in whole or in part on a profit sharing arrangement.\" Rule 5.4 (a)(3), Rules of Professional Conduct.

Ailshie, Respondent.\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25139\r\n  S\r\n  ubmitted May 1, 2000 - Filed June 5, 2000\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., and Henry B. Richardson, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Wilmot B. Irvin, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to either an indefinite suspension or disbarment from the practice of law. We accept the agreement for disbarment retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension.1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the agreement are as follows. Respondent's former law practice focused predominately on real estate transactions. In 1991, respondent co-signed on a $40,000 loan for a friend. Thereafter, respondent began to lend and give money to friends from his client escrow account, and respondent estimates the total amount given to be in excess of $100,000. Respondent also used escrow account funds to pay personal income taxes, business and personal debts, and employees' salaries. From 1991 to 1999, he deposited personal funds into his client trust account, including loans from relatives, totaling approximately $350,000 to $400,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also committed misconduct in his handling of real estate matters. He admits that he held mortgage payoff checks from a closing in his account instead of paying the mortgage company. Respondent would wait until he received additional funds from a subsequent closing before making the previous mortgage payoffs. Respondent paid any interest accrued on the mortgage payoff funds after the closing to some of his clients' lenders or to the clients personally. He was eventually unable to continue this practice because of the large amount of money he had to pay for interest. Respondent admits that he would falsify deposit receipts and label checks with inaccurate client file numbers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent was retained to perform a real estate closing on June 14, 1999. He was hospitalized on June 11, 1999, and did not perform the closing. The funds for the closing, however, were still wired to respondent's escrow account. The clients obtained another attorney to perform the closing and had to wire additional funds to that attorney for the closing. The clients have been reimbursed approximately $19,728.16 from the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection as administered by the South Carolina Bar. \r\nInvestors Title Insurance Company wrote the title insurance for respondent's real estate transactions. By June 14, 1999, they had estimated losses due to respondent's misconduct in the approximate amount of $485,649.18. Respondent admits that losses attributable to his misappropriation of client funds are at least $423,000. Investor's Title Insurance Company has filed suit against respondent in the United States District Court for the District of South Carolina, Charleston Division, to recover their losses.\r\nRespondent, through his attorney, filed a self-report of misconduct regarding his handling of his client trust accounts to the Office of Disciplinary Counsel on June 14, 1999. Respondent admits misconduct and asserts in mitigation that he has been suffering from various emotional disorders, resulting in suicide attempts, for over a decade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy his actions, we find that respondent has violated numerous provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR. He failed to abide by his clients' decisions regarding representation. Rule 1.2 (a). He failed to keep client funds separate from his own property, to promptly deliver funds to a client or third party funds that the client or third party was entitled to receive, and to render promptly a full accounting. Rule 1.15 (a);(b), and (c). Respondent engaged in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation. Rule 8.4 (a),(b), and (d).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our opinion, respondent's misconduct warrants disbarment from the practice of law. Accordingly, respondent is disbarred retroactive to the date of his interim suspension, June 18, 1999. Additionally, respondent must pay restitution to all injured parties, including current victims, victims who may surface at a future date and the Lawyers Fund for Client Protection, prior to seeking reinstatement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent was placed on interim suspension by this Court on June 18, 1999.

Jordan, Jr., both of Van Osdell, Lester, Howe &amp; Jordan, P.A., of Myrtle Beach, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted certiorari to decide whether the Court of Appeals was correct in holding that a city is not obligated to pay a hospital for medical care rendered to the city's pretrial detainees: Myrtle Beach Hospital v. City of Myrtle Beach, 330 S.C. 590, 510 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App. 1998). We affirm the Court of Appeals holding that the Hospital cannot recover under any of the theories it advances, but modify the quantum meruit test used by the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents (the City) operate a lock-up facility to house pre-trial detainees. Pursuant to the City's policy, if a detainee needs medical attention, the facility contacts the Horry County Emergency Medical Services (EMS) to evaluate and treat the detainee. If EMS determines further treatment is required, it transports the detainee to petitioner Hospital, which operates the only hospital emergency room in Myrtle Beach. As a result of this policy, the Hospital has accrued approximately $300,000 in unpaid medical bills. 1 When the City refused to pay these bills, the Hospital brought this action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment, and the circuit court granted the City's motion, finding no theory under which it was responsible for these bills. On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed. Myrtle Beach Hospital, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parties agree that the City is required by the Federal Constitution to ensure that a detainee receives necessary medical care. City of Revere v. Mass. Gen. Hosp., 463 U.S. 239, 103 S.Ct. 2979, 77 L. Ed.2d 605 (1983)(due process requires that detainees be provided medical care). 2  Whether the governmental entity holding the detainee or the medical provider should bear the cost of medical care rendered to the detainee is a matter of state law. City of Revere, 463 U.S. at 245. Whether South Carolina law requires the City to pay for the medical care received by its detainees is the issue here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. Quality Towing, Inc., v. City of Myrtle Beach, Op. No. 25103 (S.C, Sup. Ct. filed April 3, 2000)(Shearouse Advance Sheet #13 at 7). There are no contested facts here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  Is the City obligated to pay the medical bills of its detainees because this duty should be implied from statutes or regulations?;\r\n  (2)  Do public policy considerations impose a duty upon the City to pay the bills?;\r\n  (3)  Is there an obligation to pay on the part of the City, arising from an implied-by-law contract or from quantum meruit?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. Legislative Intent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hospital acknowledges, as it must, that no state statute requires the City to bear the medical expenses of the pretrial detainees. It relies instead on \"legislative intent,\" gleaned from several statutes imposing duties upon the Department of Corrections (DOC) regarding inmates or upon counties with regard to chain gangs, and from a \"regulation\" promulgated by the DOC. We will discuss the regulation first. Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-9-20 (Supp. 1999), every municipal lock-up facility such as the one operated by the City is subject to an annual inspection by a division of the DOC. The inspection \"shall be based on standards established by the South Carolina Association of Counties and adopted by the [DOC] . . . .\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to this mandate, the DOC promulgated a document entitled \"Minimum Standards for Local Detention Facilities - Type I Facilities - Overnight Lockup\" (the Minimum Standards). The Hospital refers to certain of the provisions of the Minimum Standards and especially relies on Section 2054:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2054 EMERGENCIES. Each facility shall provide twenty-four (24) hour emergency medical and dental care availability, as outlined in a written plan which includes arrangements for:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (a) Emergency evacuation of inmates from the facility\r\n  (b) Use of an emergency medical vehicle\r\n  (c) Use of one (1) or more designated hospital emergency rooms or other appropriate health facilities\r\n  (d) Emergency on-call physician and dentist services when the emergency health facility is not located in a nearby community.\r\n\r\nAccording to the Hospital, this \"regulation\" evinces a legislative intent that the City bear the cost of medical services rendered to the detainees. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThese Minimum Standards have never been subject to the legislative scrutiny afforded regulations under the Administrative Procedures Act. 3 Instead, they are merely the product of the County Association, adopted by the DOC, an executive agency. They cannot validly be viewed as expressing anything about legislative intent. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at the actual legislative intent expressed in our statutes, we find that it undermines rather than supports the Hospital's position. The Hospital points to statutes expressing the State's policy to render \"humane treatment\" to persons serving a term in the State Penitentiary, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-1-20 (1989); to one instructing that the DOC director is responsible \"for the proper care, treatment, feeding, clothing, and management of the prisoners confined therein\", S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-1-130 (Supp. 1999); a statute requiring certain entities using state convicts to reimburse the DOC for \"moneys expended . . . for medical attention . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-1-160 (Supp. 1999); and, to provisions made for the comfort and treatment of prisoners in county jail [Â§ 24-5-80 and Â§ 24-7-70 (1985)] and of convicts working on chain gangs. Â§Â§ 24-7-60; 24-7-80; 24-7-110 (1985).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our view, these statutes express the legislative intent that jailers (whether county or state) are to bear the expenses, including those incurred in rendering health care, for persons incarcerated following their convictions. Applying the maxim of statutory interpretation expressio unius est exclusio alterius, the absolute silence of the Legislature on the subject of expense allocation, or even minimal living standards, for the pretrial detainees held in municipal facilities defeats any \"legislative intent\" claim. 5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that Hospital cannot prevail on its \"legislative intent\" theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Public Policy\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hospital contends that \"public policy\" requires that the City pay the medical bills incurred by the detainees. As discussed above, the Legislature has chosen not to impose a duty upon the City under these circumstances. Further, the only indirect evidence we can find regarding a South Carolina municipality's duty to pay is a 1960 opinion by the Attorney General determining that there is no such obligation. 1960 Op. Atty. Gen. 293.  6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hospital relies heavily on opinions from other jurisdictions to support its argument that we should find a duty to pay arising from public policy. All these cases, except those decided by Arkansas 7 and Nebraska, 8 involve the construction of state statutes or regulations imposing certain duties upon jailers. 9 Our review of these decisions convinces us that whether to reallocate the financial burden of indigent predetainee medical care, and the method of any such reallocation, is one best left to the legislative process which is better equipped to allow input from all interested parties. We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals' conclusion that public policy does not\r\n compel the City to reimburse the Hospital for these costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n C. Implied by law contract or quantum meruit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Hospital argues that the Court of Appeals should have required respondents to pay the bills under either a theory of quantum meruit or contract implied by law. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, we correct a misstatement of law which first appeared in 1981. Prior to our decision in Piedmont Premium Service. Inc. v. South Carolina Ins. Co., 277 S.C. 99, 283 S.E.2d 828 (1981), we used the terms quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and contract implied by law as equivalent terms, to distinguish those situations where equity would aid recovery from those where law provided the remedy, that is, express contracts or contracts implied in fact. 10  See,e.g., United States Rubber Products Inc. v. Town of Batesburg , 183 S.C. 49, 190 S.E. 120 (1937); Rainwater v. Hobeika, 208 S.C. 433, 38 S.E.2d. 495 (1946). In a law action, the measure of damages is determined by the parties' agreement, while in equity, \"the measure of the recovery is the extent of the duty or obligation imposed by law, and is expressed by the amount which the court considers the defendant has been unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.\" Town of Batesburg , 190 S.E. at 126.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Piedmont Premium, supra, we erroneously defined a contract implied by law as resting on \"a duty imposed by law and treated as a contract for purposes of remedy only.\" Id., 283 S.E.2d at 829. Piedmont Premium directly quoted 17 C.J.S. Contracts Â§ 4(b) as the source of this definition of a contract implied by law (equitable). In fact, Â§ 4(b)\r\n\r\n11 is a discussion of implied in fact ( legal) contracts. We overrule Piedmont Premium to the extent it erroneously defines a contract implied by law and return to our original view: quantum meruit, quasi-contract, and implied by law contract are equivalent terms for an equitable remedy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, we note this Court's current test for quantum meruit differs from that used by the Court of Appeals, and further note a discrepancy between the two courts' implied by law tests. Interestingly, the Court of Appeals' implied by law test is the same as this Court's quantum meruit analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  benefit conferred by plaintiff upon the defendant;\r\n  (2)  realization of that benefit by the defendant; and\r\n  (3)  retention of the benefit by the defendant under circumstances that make it inequitable for him to retain it without paying its value.\r\n\r\nCompare, e.g., Columbia Wholesale Co. v. Scudder May, N.V., 321 S.C. 259, 440 S.E.2d 129 (1994)(quantum rneruit test) with Webb v. First Fed. Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 300 S.C. 507, 388 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App. 1989)(implied by law test).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe adopt the Scudder May test as the sole test for a quantum meruit /quasi-contract/implied by law claim. We therefore overrule the following cases to the extent they rely on this different quantum meruit test first announced by the Court of Appeals in Webb v. First Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n, supra:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  valuable services or materials were furnished;\r\n  (2)  to the defendant;\r\n  (3)  who accepted, used and enjoyed them;\r\n  (4)  under such circumstances as reasonably notified the defendant that the plaintiff was expecting to be paid by the defendant.\r\n\r\nBonaparte v. Bonaparte, 317 S.C. 256, 452 S.E.2d 836 (1995); Myrtle Beach Hosp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 330 S.C. 590, 510 S.E.2d 439 (Ct. App. 1998); Wade v. Brooks, 306 S.C. 553, 413 S.E.2d 333 (Ct. App. 1992); Muller v. Myrtle Beach Golf &amp; Yacht Club, 303 S.C. 137, 399 S.E.2d 430 (Ct. App. 1990) cert. dismissed 305 S.C. 330, 408 S.E.2d 242 (1991); and Webb v. First Fed. Savings &amp; Loan Ass'n, 299 S.C. 1, 382 S.E.2d 4 refiled 300 S.C. 507, 388 S.E.2d 823 (Ct. App: 1989).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplying the Scudder May quantum meruit test in this case, we hold that the Hospital cannot prevail on this equitable theory. The first two elements are that the City received and retained a benefit. Here, it is the detainee rather than the City that receives and retains the benefits conferred by the Hospital. 12  Further, since the only duty on the City is that imposed by the Due Process Clause of the federal constitution, and since that duty is fulfilled \"by seeing that [the detainees are] taken promptly to a hospital that provide [s] the treatment necessary for his injury,\" City of Revere, 463 U.S. at 245, we do not perceive any inequity in not requiring the City to reimburse the Hospital. 13\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the reasons given above, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The City's policy is to pay the bills if the treatment is required because of an injury occurring during the arrest or as the 'direct result' of the incarceration. \r\n2 Although City of Revere involved the specific question of the duty owed to an individual injured by municipal police officers in the performance  of their duties, we agree with the parties and other courts considering the issue that the reasoning in City of Revere applies with equal force to the duty owed to pretrial detainees. \r\n3 Cf. Stuckey v. State Budget and Control Bd, Op No. 25090 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 20, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sheet # 11 at 10)(Toal, J., dissenting)(would not bind affected person to regulation not promulgated pursuant to APA). \r\n4 This is not to suggest that the DOC could not be held to its duty to adopt standards, or to conduct inspections of local facilities pursuant to &sect; 24-9-20; or that the City would not be subject to sanctions for failure to abide by these regulations. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 24-9-30 (Supp. 1999) \"Enforcement of minimum standards.\" \r\n5 The absence of specific legislation does not, however, mean that municipalities may treat pretrial detainees inhumanely or with deliberate indifference, or consciously disregard their rights.\r\n6 Compare 1899 Op. Atty. Gen. 204, stating that a county would be liable for the medical treatment afforded a prisoner wounded while being arrested, if the prisoner were in custody. \r\n7 Union County v. Warner Brown Hosp., 297 Ark. 460, 762 S.W.2d 798 (1989).\r\n8 Lutheran Medical Center v. City of Omaha, 229 Neb. 802, 429 N.W. 2d 347 (1988).\r\n9 Although the Court of Appeals concluded that North Carolina represented a minority view, we disagree. North Carolina imposes a duty on the governmental entity to pay medical expenses incurred by persons in its custody. Spicer v. Williamson, 132 S.E. 291 (N.C. 1926). This duty arises from a state statute requiring the county to provide medical attention to persons confined in the county jail. In Craven County Hospital v. Lenoir County, 331 S.E. 2d 690 (N.C. App. 1985), relied upon by the Court of Appeals, the issue was whether the governmental entity owed a duty to pay medical bills incurred by a person who was not in custody at the time of the injury. \r\n10 See Stanley Smith &amp; Sons v. Limestone College, 283 S.C. 430 322 S.E.2d 474 fn.l (Ct. App. 1984)(\"The unfortunate use of \"implied contract\" to connote both true (\"implied in fact\") and quasi (\"implied in law\") contracts has led to much confusion\"). \r\n11 Now found at 17 C.J.S.

We simply decide that, as between the City and the Hospital, equity does not require the City to bear these costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25141","title":"Evins v.

Meggs, of Columbia, for appellant City of Columbia.\r\n        Larry Smith, of Columbia, for appellant Richland County.\r\n        D. Cravens Ravenel, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE: The trial judge voided property conveyances made by Richland County Historic Preservation Commission (RCHPC) to appellants City of Columbia (City) and Richland County (County). We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May 1994, RCHPC owned four historic homes in Columbia, and some of the furnishings. 1  Six of the seven commissioners were present at the regularly scheduled May 1994 RCHPC meeting. At this meeting a resolution was introduced and passed by a vote of 4-2. 2 This resolution provided that RCHPC dissolve itself and deed two of its properties to City and the other two to County. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the commissioners, Newman, brought a declaratory judgment action to declare the property transfers void and the dissolution ineffective. She brought the suit both in her capacity as a commissioner and as a citizen-taxpayer. On appeal, we held she did not have standing. Newman v. Richland Countv Historic Preservation Comm'n, 325 S.C. 79, 480 S.E.2d 72 (1997)(disappointed legislator is not permitted to attack decision of her own body, either through declaratory judgment or through direct \"appeal\"). In Newman, we also held: \"On appeal there is no challenge to the circuit court's conclusion that RCHPC lacks the ability to dissolve itself, an action which can only be achieved by an act of the General Assembly, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-80 (1986), or by the Secretary of State in cases of inactive special purpose districts. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-11-290 (Supp.1995).\" 480 S.E.2d at 73. 4\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFour months after the Newman decision was filed, respondent Jennie Dreher Evins 5 brought this action seeking to void the property conveyances. City and County moved to dismiss the action on the ground of lack of standing. The trial judge ruled Evins had standing and denied the motion to dismiss. The trial judge declared the transfers void and directed reconveyance to RCHPC. RCHPC, County, and City appealed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  1) Does RCHPC have the authority to convey the property?\r\n  2) Is Evins estopped from contesting the conveyances?\r\n  3) Does Evins have standing?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Power to convey \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRCHPC contends that the it had the power to convey the property to City and County. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRCHPC was created by the General Assembly in 1963. 1963 S.C. Acts No. 69. The enabling act enumerated the powers of RCHPC. RCHPC has the power to \"acquire, own, hold in trust, preserve, restore, maintain, suitably mark, develop, advertise, and operate buildings and structures of historic significance, and the land upon which the same may be situate, in Richland County, and to receive funds, grants, donations and appropriations for the accomplishment of these purposes.\" 1963 Act. No. 69, Â§ 4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe specific power to convey property was not enumerated. \"[T]he maxim `Expressio unius est exclusio alterius' is defined as: \"When certain persons or things are specified in a law, contract, or will, an intention to exclude all others from its operation may be inferred.\" Little v. Town of Conway, 171 S.C. 27, 171 S.E. 447, 448 (1933). See also Atlanta Skin &amp; Cancer Clinic v. Hallmark Gen. Partners. Inc., 320 S.C. 113, 463 S.E.2d 600 (1995) (under maxim of expressio unius est exclusio alterius, expression of one thing is exclusion of another). Since the legislation specifically sets forth the powers of RCHPC, the power to convey property may not be implied from the statute. 6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants also contend the Home Rule amendment to article VIII of the State Constitution implies the authority to convey the property. Article VIII, Â§ 17 states: \"The provisions of this Constitution and all laws concerning local government shall be liberally construed in their favor. Powers, duties, and responsibilities granted local government subdivisions by this Constitution and by law shall include those fairly implied and not prohibited by this Constitution.\" (emphasis added). However, Home Rule applies only to counties and municipalities, not special purpose districts.7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hold RCHPC did not have the authority to convey the property to City and County. Additionally, none of powers granted to RCHPC imply that RCHPC could deed all of its property to a third party. Since the enabling legislation did not specifically provide for RCHPC's authority to convey property, we do not think it is a power which can be fairly implied in this case. To do so would thwart its purpose to preserve and maintain historic property and without any property, it would be a defunct entity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2) Estoppel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants contend Evins is estopped from bringing this action because in 1976, Evins as secretary of RCHPC signed deeds conveying property from RCHPC. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEstoppel by deed precludes a party to a deed from asserting as against the other any right or title in derogation of the deed, or from denying the truth of any material fact asserted in it. Hipps v. Hipps, 288 S.C. 564, 343 S.E.2d 669 (Ct.App. 1986). This type of estoppel is clearly inapplicable here. Evins was not a party to those deeds and certainly she is not asserting any right or title in derogation of these deeds which were recorded many years ago. There is no allegation that Evins participated in any capacity in the execution of the deeds involved in the current litigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRCHPC also claim Evins's action is barred by the doctrine of equitable estoppel. A party claiming equitable estoppel must show: 1) a lack of knowledge and the means of knowledge of truth as to facts in question; 2) justifiable reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and 3) prejudicial change in the position of the party claiming estoppel. Walton v. Walton, 282 S.C. 165, 318 S.E.2d 14 (1984). Estoppel cannot exist if the knowledge of both parties is equal and nothing is done by one to mislead the other. Helsel v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 24, 413 S.E.2d 821 (1992). Here, there have been no allegations that would support the elements of estoppel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3) Standing\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCounty and City contend the trial judge erred in denying its motion to dismiss on the ground of standing. Appellants allege that since Evins failed to allege any personal stake in the action and there is no evidence in the record of a personal stake, she does not have standing. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, to have standing, one must generally have a personal stake in the subject matter of the lawsuit, i.e., one must be a real party in interest. Glaze v. Grooms, 324 S.C. 249, 478 S.E.2d 841 (1996). Additionally, a private person may not invoke the judicial power to determine the validity of executive or legislative action unless he has sustained, or is in immediate danger of sustaining, prejudice therefrom. Blandon v. Coleman, 285 S.C. 472, 330 S.E.2d 298 (1985). We have held standing may be conferred upon a party when an issue is of such public importance as to require its resolution for future guidance. Baird v. Charleston County, 333 S.C. 519, 511 S.E.2d 69 (1999) (citing Thompson v. South Carolina Comm'n on Alcohol &amp; Drug Abuse, 267 S.C. 463, 229 S.E.2d 718 (1976) (holding that the plaintiffs had standing because the questions involved were of such wide concern, both to law enforcement personnel and to the public)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellants attempt to distinguish Baird by arguing that its holding applies only to ultra vires acts and then only to those of immense public importance. We disagree. While in Baird there was an allegation of an ultra vires act, clearly in several cases, we have held a citizen has standing when ultra vires acts were not alleged. Berry v. Zahler, 220 S.C. 86, 66 S.E.2d 459 (1951) (holding that questions of public interest originally encompassed in an action should be decided for future guidance); Ashmore v. Greater Greenville Sewer Dist., 211 S.C. 77, 44 S.E.2d 88 (1947) (same)). In any event, we hold the actions of RCHPC were ultra vires as discussed above. Thus, the trial court correctly held Evins has standing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1The Mann-Simmons Cottage; The Robert Mills Historic House and Park; The Hampton-Preston Mansion and Garden; and The Woodrow Wilson Boyhood House. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Commissioner Weston was absent from the meeting.\r\n3 As background information, it seems RCHPC and the Historic Columbia Foundation were at odds with one another and fighting for control over the properties. A museum consultant was hired to assess the situation. The consultant, Barry Dressel, issued his report in which he recommended RCHPC deed its property to the City and the County and RCHPC be dissolved. The City Council through Councilman Papadea informed RCHPC that if it did not follow this recommendation, basically its funding would be withheld.\r\n4 On May 14, 1994, after RCHPC voted to dissolve itself, a bill was introduced to dissolve RCHPC but the General Assembly never passed it. \r\n5 Evins was a commissioner at one time.\r\n6Furthermore, to allow RCHPC to convey all of its property and then seek dissolution would clearly -circumvent the intention of the legislature that upon dissolution of a special purpose district, the special purpose district's property will be transferred to County. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 4-9-80 (1986)(any act which dissolves a special purpose district shall provide that such act shall be effective only upon approval of such abolition by favorable referendum vote and upon the dissolution, the county shall take title to the property of the district). \r\n7 There is dicta in D.W. Flowe &amp; Sons v. Christopher Constr. Co., 326 S.C. 17, 482 S.E.2d 558 (1997), which applies Home Rule to special purpose districts. To the extent that D.W.

Doar, Jr., of McNair Law Firm, of Georgetown; and James J. Hinchey, Jr., of Haynsworth, Marion, McKay &amp; Guerard, of Charleston, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: This is an appeal from the order of the circuit court ordering the appellants, lot owners in Hagley Estates Subdivision (Hagley Estates), to connect to the Georgetown County Water and Sewer District (District). We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHagley Estates was developed in the mid-1960's by a developer which later filed for bankruptcy. The lots were publicly auctioned. In 1967, the General Assembly created the District through Act No. 733, 1967 Acts 1539 to acquire, construct and operate a water and sewer system. The service area would be the County of Georgetown excluding the City of Georgetown and the Town of Andrews. The area to be serviced included Hagley Estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1971, the South Carolina State Board of Health 1 (DHEC) entered into an agreement with the Hagley Water, Sewer, and Fire Authority (Authority). 2  The agreement called for the Authority to determine Ford v. Georgetown County Water &amp; Sewer District et al., appropriate building lots and for DHEC to issue septic tank permits and permits to install private water systems. Authorization could be issued to permit the installation of a septic tank on every third lot provided that the permitee or applicant would subscribe to the community water and/or sewage system at such rates authorized by the Authority when it became available, even if the applicant had a well and/or septic tank. The Authority also sent a letter to the lot owners in Hagley Estates outlining the agreement.\r\n\r\nIn June 1992, a service agreement was entered into between the District and the Authority to design, construct, operate and maintain a public water system and sewer collector and disposal system throughout the area of Hagley Estates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1997, appellants brought an action challenging the constitutionality of Section 2, of Act Number 733, 1967 Acts 1539. In addition, they argued that the District's Board of Commissioners should be removed since they were not duly elected in accordance with the law and that all liens placed on their property be voided. The circuit court dismissed the action and ordered the appellants to connect to the District's water and sewer systems. This appeal follows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court found that the impact fees and connection fees charged by the District to its new customers were paid in exchange for water and sewer services provided by the District. Appellants contend that impact fees are general revenue measures unrelated to the services received by the Hagley owners, and as such are taxes that may only be levied through representative government. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGenerally, taxes are imposed on all property for the maintenance of government while assessments are placed only on the property to be benefited. Hagley Homeowners Association Inc. v. Hagley Water Sewer and Fire Authority, 326 S.C. 67, 485 S.E.2d 92 (1997). A \"charge\" is \"[t]he price of, or rate for something.\" Hagley quoting Black's Law Dictionary 233 (6th ed. 1990). Unlike taxes, charges and assessments are similar in that a person receives something specific in exchange for payment of a charge and/or assessment. Id. We held in Hagley, that the imposition of a charge in exchange for a service does not constitute taxation for constitutional purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant also contends that the District has not limited itself to providing the Hagley owners with water and sewer and avoids spelling out its exact intentions regarding the impact fees and since the impact fees are not used for a specific purpose they are therefore general charges and as such are taxes and not charges. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecently in J.K. Construction, Inc., v. Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority, 336 S.C. 162, 519 S.E.2d 561 (1999), we discussed at length impact fees. In J.K. Construction, customers of a regional sewer authority sought a declaratory judgment challenging the new account fees imposed on new or upgrading customers to pay for future capital improvements. We held that the required payment is a charge, not a tax, and Western Carolina Regional Sewer Authority had uniformly imposed the charge upon those who were required to pay it. We considered that the required payment primarily benefited those who were required to pay it because they received a special benefit or service as a result of improvements made with the proceeds which was the proper treatment and disposal of sewage. The proceeds would be dedicated solely to capital improvement projects as opposed to being placed in a general fund to be spent on ongoing expenses and maintenance, which is a hallmark of a tax. The revenue generated by the required payment would not exceed the cost of capital improvements to the system. The required payment was uniformly imposed upon those who must pay it (the new customers based on their anticipated usage).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also found that \"[i]mposing a new account fee, while perhaps not the only way to raise such funds, is a reasonable and legitimate method of accruing the funds. Existing customers collectively have paid tens of millions of dollars to build the current system, and it seems eminently fair and reasonable to require new customers to shoulder a portion of the cost of future expansions their presence will demand.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEven though the overall benefit may extend beyond Hagley Estates, \"a charge does not become a tax merely because the general public obtains some benefit.\" J.K. Construction, Id. The District has only required the impact fee of residents who will benefit from the service to pay the fee (the new customers and individuals requesting additional capacity).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we note that this is a unique situation since appellants agreed to tie into the community water and sewer systems once it became available as a condition to receive permits to construct. septic tanks. We affirm the circuit court's ruling requiring the appellants to connect to the District's water and sewer systems. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 South Carolina State Board of Health is the predecessor of South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control. \r\n2 The General Assembly created the Authority pursuant to Act No. 285, 1971 Acts 344 on June 03, 1971, forming Hagley Subdivision into public  service district which created Hagley Water, Sewer, and Fire Authority and gave it extensive powers in reference to matters dealing with water, sewage and fire protection at the request of DHEC. \r\n3 Appellant's remaining arguments are affirmed pursuant to Rule 220(b).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25143","title":"Simmons v.

Pope of Pope &amp; Rodgers, Columbia, for amicus curiae, the South Carolina Health Alliance.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nWALLER, A.J.: This case presents the novel issue of whether a hospital owes a common law nondelegable duty to render competent service to its emergency room patients, such that it may not avoid liability for the negligent acts of emergency room physicians hired as independent contractors under a contract between the hospital and a separate corporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlethia Simmons, personal representative for the estate of her father, P.J. McBride, and John H. Cooper (respondents) brought, unrelated medical negligence actions against Tuomey Regional Medical Center (Tuomey Regional) and others. The circuit judge granted Tuomey Regional's summary judgment motions on the issues 'of actual agency, apparent agency, and nondelegable duty in both cases. The Court of Appeals reversed, addressing only the issue of the nondelegable duty. Simmons v. Tuomey Regional Medical Ctr., 330 S.C. 115, 498 S.E.2d 408 (Ct. App. 1998); Cooper v. Tuomey Regional Medical Ctr., Op. No. 98-UP-077 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb.17,1998) (unpublished opinion citing Simmons). We granted Tuomey Regional's petitions for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appeals' decisions. We consolidated the cases for consideration because they raise the same issue. We affirm as modified the Court of Appeals' decision to impose a nondelegable duty and reverse the grant of summary judgment to Tuomey Regional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nP.J. McBride received medical care at Tuomey Regional's emergency room for a head injury he suffered in a moped accident. His daughter, Simmons, signed a form consenting to treatment at the emergency room that contained a provision stating, \"THE PHYSICIANS PRACTICING IN THIS EMERGENCY ROOM ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF TUOMEY REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. THEY ARE INDEPENDENT PHYSICIANS, AS ARE ALL PHYSICIANS PRACTICING IN THIS HOSPITAL.\" Simmons said she did not read the form because she was upset about her father's injuries. She believed the physicians were Tuomey Regional employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emergency room physicians examined McBride, but released him without treating a serious head injury that was visible on the back of his head, Simmons alleged. The physicians apparently believed his confused state was a result of intoxication. McBride was returned to Tuomey Regional's emergency room the next day by ambulance after his condition worsened. This time, physicians diagnosed him as suffering from a subdural hematoma 1 and transferred him to a Columbia hospital. McBride died about six weeks later of complications caused by the head injury, Simmons alleged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCooper, who had suffered a previous heart attack, experienced chest pains while driving. A friend drove him to Tuomey Regional's emergency room, where Cooper informed the receptionist he was having a heart attack and asked for immediate help. Cooper alleged he sat on a gurney for at least 1 1/2 hours before seeing a doctor, causing him serious injury. Unlike Simmons, he did not sign any form containing the \"independent physician\" statement. He believed the physicians were Tuomey Regional employees. Both Simmons and Cooper stated in affidavits they saw no signs or other indications that the physicians, working in an area that was an integral part of the hospital campus, were not Tuomey Regional employees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional signed a contract with Coastal Physicians Services, Inc. (Coastal), in 1987. 2 The contract describes Coastal as an \"independent contractor\" that provides \"independent-contractor physicians\" to work in Tuomey Regional's emergency room on an around-the-clock basis. The contract provides that, \"[e]xcept as hereinafter provided and to the extent practice and professional conduct of all Hospital's medical staff members are regulated by the Hospital, the Physicians shall not be under the direction or supervision of the Hospital in performance of their Emergency Department duties.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe contract states the physicians are not Tuomey Regional's employees, and the hospital does not directly pay or provide any benefits to the physicians. Under a 1989 amendment to the original contract, Tuomey Regional bills patients and their insurers for emergency room services provided by both it and Coastal physicians. Tuomey Regional then pays Coastal under a formula based on the \"direct cost\" plus a specified amount for each hour Coastal physicians work in the emergency room. Coastal physicians must maintain their own liability insurance coverage in minimum amounts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCoastal physicians must meet many.of the same requirements as any physician who seeks staff privileges, i.e., the right to admit patients to Tuomey Regional. Coastal physicians must, for example, apply and qualify for medical staff privileges in accordance with the bylaws and regulations of the medical staff. Their professional conduct is governed by Tuomey Regional and medical staff bylaws and rules, as well as standards set by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Hospitals, applicable statutes, and regulations of governmental bodies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional, however, maintains much more extensive control over Coastal physicians than physicians who only have staff privileges. For example, Tuomey Regional selects the emergency room medical director from among the physicians, with the consent of Coastal. Coastal physicians must remain on Tuomey Regional's premises during their shift, and must provide services to anyone who desires treatment. Tuomey Regional has the authority to prevent any physician from working in the emergency room when it \"deems the clinical performance of any Physician . . . to be detrimental to the health or safety of Hospital's patients.\" Within five days written notice, Coastal \"shall reassign that Physician from the Hospital and shall not permit him to provide further services at the Hospital without the Hospital's approval.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional retains the last word in most disagreements. The contract provides that \"[a]ll matters relating to the Hospital's policies, rules, regulations, services, and other items of conduct wherein the Physicians may be involved, shall be determined jointly by [Coastal] and the Hospital's Chief Executive Officer, and in the event of a disagreement . . . the decision of the Hospital shall be final.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that hospitals have a nondelegable duty under the common law to render competent service to the patients of their emergency rooms?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. See also Taper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997). In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988). On appeal from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in a light most favorable to the appellant, the non-moving party below. Williams v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular duty. If there is no duty, then the defendant in a negligence action is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law. See Ellis v. Niles, 324 S.C. 223, 479 S.E.2d 47 (1996); Sharpe v. South Carolina Dep't of Mental Health, 292 S.C. 11, 16, 354 S.E.2d 778, 781 (Ct. App. 1987) (Bell, J., concurring).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is uncontroverted that the role that hospitals play in the delivery of health care across America has changed dramatically since the days when the doctrine of charitable immunity shielded hospitals from malpractice liability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The hospital of the early to mid-nineteenth century would not be recognizable as such to a modern observer. \"Respectable\" people who fell sick or who were injured were treated by their doctors at home; only the lowest classes of society sought help in the \"hospital,\" which was most often a separate wing on the almshouse. As late as 1873, there were only 178 hospitals in the United States, with a total of 50,000 beds. These hospitals were private charities, and their trustees were usually unable to raise sufficient funding to provide a pleasant stay. The hospital of the time was dirty, crowded and full of contagious diseases. The \"nurses\" were usually former patients. Doctors, who were not paid, tended the ill for a few hours per week out of a sense of charity mixed with the knowledge that they could \"practice\" ,their cures on the poor and charge young medical students for instruction in the healing arts. These young \"house doctors\" also worked without pay, practicing cures on the ill.\r\n\r\nSteven R. Owens, Note, 1990 Wis. L. Rev.1129,1131-32 (description drawn from C. Rosenberg, The Care of Strangers - The Rise of America's Hospital System (1987)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUntil the 1940s, hospitals were protected from malpractice liability by the doctrine of charitable immunity. Courts and legislators reasoned that a charitable institution should devote its resources to the endeavor at hand and the greater good, not to reimbursing individuals injured by the institution's negligent acts. Martin C. McWilliams, Jr. &amp; Hamilton E. Russell, III, Hospital Liability for Torts of Independent Contractor Physicians, 47 S.C. L. Rev. 431, 434-35 (1996); Kenneth S. Abraham &amp; Paul C. Weiler, Enterprise Medical Liability and the Evolution of the American Health Care System, 108 Harv. L. Rev. 381, 385-86 (1994); Owens, supra, 1990 Wis. L. Rev. at 1135-36.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHospitals and the medical sciences improved  dramatically throughout the twentieth century, and with those improvements came a concomitant increase in the importance of hospitals' role in providing medical care. Today, hospitals compete aggressively in providing the latest medical technology and the best facilities, as well as in attracting patients and physicians who will funnel patients to them. Hospitals not only strive to be a source of pride in the local community, but they also seek to avoid operating at a financial loss. Regardless of whether they are profit-seeking enterprises, they are run much like any large corporation and must operate in a fiscally responsible manner. Like any business dependent upon attracting individual people as customers, hospitals in the aggregate spend billions to advertise their facilities and services in a variety of media, from newspapers and billboards to television and the Internet. Among the many forces that have caused this sea change are the commercialization of the practice of medicine, the public's demand for access to modern medical technology, the prevalence and impact of government-funded programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, and the rise of managed care in the private sector. See Owens, supra, 1990 Wis. L. Rev. at 1130-35; McWilliams &amp; Russell, supra, 47 S.C. L. Rev. at 432-38; Abraham &amp; Weiler, supra, 108 Harv. L. Rev. at 382-98.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledging such changes, this Court limited the doctrine of charitable immunity in Brown v. Anderson County Hosp. Ass'n, 268 S.C. 479, 234 S.E.2d 873 (1977), holding that a hospital could be held liable when a plaintiff proved \"the injuries occurred because of the hospital's heedlessness and reckless disregard of the plaintiffs rights.\" Id. at 487, 234 S.E.2d at 876. Four years later, the Court abolished charitable immunity in Fitzer v. Greater Greenville South Carolina Young Men's Christian Ass'n, 277 S.C. 1, 282 S.E.2d 230 (1981). \"Public policy,\" Justice Ness wrote, \"is a dynamic not static concept, and what was valid in the past is not necessarily a valid policy today. Moreover, when the reason for a declared public policy no longer exists, we should not hesitate to abolish it and the rules which are supported by the policy.\" Id. at 3, 282 S.E.2d at 231. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  As the Court of Appeals explained in the case before us,\r\n  [T]he hospital itself has come to be perceived as the provider of medical services. According to this view, patients come to the hospital to be cured, and the doctors who practice there are the hospital's instrumentalities, regardless of the nature of the private arrangements between the hospital and the physician. Whether or not this perception is accurate seemingly matters little when weighed against the momentum of changing public perception and attendant public policy.\r\n\r\nSimmons, 330 S.C. at 121, 498 S.E.2d at 411 (quoting McWilliams &amp; Russell, supra, 47 S.C. L. Rev. at 473).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is against this backdrop that we are asked to decide whether the Court of Appeals properly imposed a common law nondelegable duty on hospitals with regard to physicians who work in their emergency rooms. Tuomey Regional presents several arguments explaining why it believes the Court of Appeals erred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA. NOT SUPPORTED BY LAW IN SOUTH CAROLINA\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional contends that South Carolina law does not support the Court of Appeals' \"quantum unsubstantiated leap of logic.\" We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term \"nondelegable duty\" is somewhat misleading. A person may delegate a duty to an independent contractor, but if the independent contractor breaches that duty by acting negligently or improperly, the delegating person remains liable for that breach. It actually is the liability, not the duty, that is not delegable. The party which owes the nondelegable duty is vicariously liable for negligent acts of the independent contractor. Simmons, 330 S.C. at 123, 498 S.E.2d at 412; see also F. Patrick Hubbard &amp; Robert L. Felix, The South Carolina Law of Torts 654 (1997).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis Court and the Court of Appeals have applied the nondelegable duty doctrine in several situations. An employer has a nondelegable duty to employees to provide a reasonably safe work place and suitable tools, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by unsafe activities or tools under the employer's control. 4 A landlord who undertakes repair of his property by use of a contractor has a nondelegable duty to see that the repair is done properly, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by improper repairs.5\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA common carrier has a nondelegable duty to ensure that cargo is properly loaded and secured, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by an unsecured load. 6 A bail bondsman has a nondelegable duty to supervise the work of his employees, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by those employees.7 A municipality has a nondelegable duty to provide safe streets even when maintenance is undertaken by the state Highway Department, and remains vicariously liable for injuries caused by defective repairs. 8\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional mentions some of the above cases and argues they are distinguishable because in this case it is the independent-contractor physician - not the hospital - who controls a patient's medical treatment. Tuomey Regional also contends regulations promulgated by the state Department of Health and Environmental Control do not impose such a duty. 9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find Tuomey Regional's arguments unpersuasive. The cited cases clearly illustrate that a person or entity entrusted with important duties in certain circumstances may not assign those duties to someone else and then expect to walk away unscathed when things go wrong. A principle that applies in cases of poorly repaired brick floors and sloppily loaded cargo certainly applies to situations in which people must entrust that most personal of things, their physical well-being, to physicians at an emergency room intimately connected with and closely controlled by a hospital. However, as explained further below, we do not believe it is necessary, as the Court of Appeals did, to impose an absolute nondelegable duty on hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. NOT SUPPORTED BY LAW IN OTHER JURISDICTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional contends that the law of other jurisdictions does not support the Court of Appeals' decision. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlaska, Florida, and New York courts have applied the nondelegable duty doctrine to care provided by a hospital's emergency room physicians. See Jackson v. Power, 743 P.2d 1376, 1385 (Alaska 1987) (holding that a general acute care hospital may not delegate its duty to provide physicians for emergency room care because the law imposes a duty on hospital to provide that health care); superseded in part by Alaska Stat. Â§ 09.65.096 (2000); Irving v. Doctors Hosp. of Lake Worth, Inc., 415 So.2d 55, 59 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1982) (holding that jury should have been instructed on nondelegable duty doctrine, as well as apparent agency doctrine, when patient alleges malpractice by emergency room physician); Martell v. St. Charles Hosp., 523 N.Y.S.2d 342, 352 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1987) (suggesting New York would hold hospitals liable for the malpractice of independent emergency room physicians under the nondelegable duty doctrine).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, Texas and Missouri courts have rejected the nondelegable duty doctrine in connection with care provided by emergency room physicians. Baptist Mem'l Hosp. System v. Sampson, 969 S.W.2d 945, 949 (Tex. 1998) (finding it unnecessary to adopt nondelegable duty doctrine for malpractice by emergency room physicians because the patient may sue the negligent physician, and sue the hospital for violation of any duties owed directly to patients); Kelly v. St. Luke's Hospital of Kansas City, 826 S.W.2d 391(Mo. Ct. App. 1992) (declining to apply nondelegable duty because it was not in statutes or regulations, and practice of medicine in emergency room is not an inherently dangerous activity); see also Estates of Milliron v. Francke, 793 P.2d 824, 827 (Mont. 1990) (refusing to apply nondelegable duty doctrine to hold hospital liable for the negligent acts of a radiologist, an independent contractor).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile few courts have adopted the nondelegable duty doctrine, numerous courts have endorsed the doctrine of apparent authority or apparent agency to hold hospitals liable when an injured patient proves a physician was the hospital's apparent agent. 10  Although it found it unnecessary to address it in the present cases, the Court of Appeals has sanctioned the use of the apparent agency doctrine in this setting. See Strickland v. Madden, 323 S.C. 63, 70-71, 448 S.E.2d 581, 585 (Ct. App. 1994) (hospital may be vicariously liable for negligent health care rendered by a physician who is not an employee of the hospital under doctrine of apparent agency; but plaintiff failed to show apparent agency where doctor was a private practitioner whose only connection to hospital was that he had staff privileges to admit patients); Shuler v. Tuomey Regional Medical Ctr., 313 S.C. 225, 437 S.E.2d 128 (Ct. App. 1993) (discussing apparent agency in negligence action against emergency room physician and hospital, but concluding plaintiff did not demonstrate the physician was an apparent agent of hospital).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder the apparent agency doctrine, the injured patient must establish that (1) the hospital consciously or impliedly represented the physician to be its agent, (2) the patient relied upon the representation, and (3) the patient changed his position to his detriment in reliance on the representation. See Strickland v. Madden, 323 S.C. at 70, 448 S.E.2d at 585; Watkins v. Mobil Oil Corp., 291 S.C. 62, 67, 352 S.E.2d 284 (Ct. App. 1986) (citing Restatement (Second) of Agency Â§ 267 (1958)). The focus is on the acts and conduct of the principal, not the agent. Frasier v. Palmetto Homes of Florence. Inc., 323 S.C. 240, 473 S.E.2d 865 (Ct. App. 1996); see also Hubbard &amp; Felix at 647-48, 652-56 (discussing apparent agency and nondelegable duties).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn instructive example of a court grappling with a case like those we are presented with today, and ultimately adopting an expanded theory of apparent agency, is found in three Ohio cases. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1987, the Ohio Court of Appeals held that a hospital has a nondelegable duty to its emergency room patients that is not affected by the hospital's contract with an independent-contractor physicians group. Griffin v. Matthews, 522 N.E.2d 1100 (Ohio Ct. App. 1987). Three years later, the Ohio Supreme Court held that a hospital does not have a nondelegable duty to assure the absence of negligence in the care provided by private, independent physicians granted staff privileges. Albain v. Flower Hosp., 553 N.E.2d 1038 (Ohio 1990). The Albain court found Griffin, which dealt with emergency room physicians, inapplicable. The court did not explicitly overrule Griffin, but questioned its validity by describing it as a \"misdirected attempt to circumvent the necessity of proving agency by estoppel.\" Albain, 553 N.E.2d at 1047.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA mere four years later, a divided Ohio Supreme Court rejected the narrowly drawn apparent agency theory it had set out in Albain. Clark v. SouthView Hosp., 628 N.E.2d 46 (Ohio 1994). In Clark, the administrator of the decedent's estate alleged that emergency room physicians committed malpractice in the death of a woman who suffered an asthma attack. The 26-year-old woman, who had suffered previous attacks, chose to drive to the defendant hospital. Apparently impressed by the hospital's advertising, its reputation, and her mother's belief it was the destination of choice in an emergency, the woman (with her 18-month-old daughter) had driven past another hospital's emergency room en route to the defendant hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Clark court comprehensively explained the shortcomings of its analysis and the narrow view expressed in Albain. The court described how hospitals have changed from places where physicians essentially experimented upon people too poor to summon a physician to their home to places that employ highly trained medical staffs, expensive technology, and public relations experts to parlay public confidence into paying patients. The Clark court adopted a broader theory that we believe ultimately will be followed by the many other courts using the apparent agency approach in this setting:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A hospital may be held liable under the doctrine of agency by estoppel for the negligence of independent medical practitioners practicing in the hospital if it holds itself out to the public as a provider of medical services and in the absence of notice or knowledge to the contrary, the patient looks to the hospital, as opposed to the individual practitioner, to provide competent medical care ....\r\n  As to notice to the plaintiff that care is being provided by independent medical practitioners, we stress that such notice, to be effective, must come at a meaningful time.\r\n\r\nClark, 628 N.E.2d at 53-54. The court went on to reject suggestions that a hospital could insulate itself from liability by giving notice to patients through consent forms signed upon admission or signs posted in the emergency room. Id. at 54 n.1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn sum, our decision is amply supported by law in other jurisdictions. Courts throughout the nation have struggled with this issue, and nearly all have held hospitals liable under one or more theories. The Ohio cases illustrate what we perceive to be the likely trend among the many courts that have adopted an apparent agency theory in these cases. Under that trend, hospitals will not be allowed to escape liability by giving last-minute notice of independent-contractor practitioners through admission forms or emergency room signs. The result is that hospitals may be held liable for the malpractice of their emergency room physicians, regardless of whether it is through a theory of apparent agency or nondelegable duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe also conclude it is appropriate to find a nondelegable duty in this case because apparent agency in its traditional form requires a representation by the principal (the hospital) and proof of reliance on that representation by the patient. See Strickland v. Madden, supra. Most courts applying the apparent agency doctrine in the emergency room setting have relaxed those requirements substantially in order to hold the hospital liable, a decision criticized by some commentators. See Jackson v. Power, 743 P.2d at 1382 n.10 (listing cases and agreeing with \"the weight of authority that application of apparent authority in the hospital/emergency room physician situation does not require an express representation to the patient that the treating physician is an employee of the hospital. Nor is direct testimony as to reliance required absent evidence that the patient knew or should have known that the treating physician was not a hospital employee when the treatment was rendered\"); McWilliams &amp; Russell, supra, 47 S.C. L. Rev. at 448-52 (asserting that courts, confronted with the tide of changing public perception of hospitals, have employed the apparent agency doctrine without rigor in emergency room setting).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe point often made in the cases and commentary, either implicitly or explicitly, is that expecting a patient in an emergency situation to debate or comprehend the meaning and extent of any representations by the hospital - which likely would be based on an opinion gradually formed over the years and not on any single representation - imposes an unfair and improper burden on the patient. Consequently, we believe the better solution, grounded primarily in public policy reasons we explain below, is to impose a nondelegable duty on hospitals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. NOT SUPPORTED BY PUBLIC POLICY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTuomey Regional asserts that no public policy considerations support the Court of Appeals' conclusion. First, Tuomey Regional argues the duty is unnecessary because physicians must carry professional liability insurance, making judgments collectible. Second, holding hospitals liable will not improve care because hospitals may not practice medicine. Third, patients do not care whether a physician is a hospital employee or independent contractor, and no one in need of medical care decides where to go based upon the relationship of the physicians with the hospital. Finally, Tuomey Regional argues that the adoption of the nondelegable duty doctrine in this setting is a decision for the Legislature to make, not the courts. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCommentators have debated whether compensation is a goal of tort law, or simply a means by which other goals are accomplished. See Hubbard &amp; Felix at 1-26 (discussing policies of tort law). Regardless, Tuomey Regional's focus on the availability of compensation misses another important aspect of tort law: the desire to give parties with crucial duties a keen incentive to do everything possible to avoid violating those duties. \"Immunity fosters neglect and irresponsibility, while liability encourages the exercise of due care.\" Brown v. Anderson Count Hosp. Ass'n, 268 S.C. at 487, 234 S.E.2d at 877; see also Hubbard &amp; Felix at 6-10, 638-40 (discussing theory of rational avoidance of liability and policy bases for vicarious liability). Imposing a nondelegable duty on hospitals in this context fulfills both goals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reject Tuomey Regional's insistence that \"hospitals may not practice medicine\" - a point it has asserted throughout this litigation. It is true that a hospital may not decide that Patient X is to receive a dose of a particular medication twice a day; nor may a hospital order that Patient Y undergo specified tests at 2 p.m. on a particular day. Only licensed physicians may make such decisions. But the \"practice of medicine\" encompasses a much broader range of actions than those specific directives. It includes innumerable decisions regarding the type and quality of medical equipment, staffing levels, and the renovation or addition of facilities. Hospital and emergency room administrators make countless decisions that intimately affect the \"practice of medicine\" all day, every day. The contract between Tuomey Regional and Coastal in the present cases illustrates how the hospital, in ways both obvious and subtle, affects and controls the practice of medicine. See Jeannie Pinkston, Note, 48 Okla. L. Rev. 797, 804 (1995) (stating the oft-quoted adage that \"hospitals don't practice medicine, physicians do\" no longer reflects public perception of a modern hospital, which has assumed the role of a profit-producing business and aggressively markets itself as an administrator and provider of comprehensive health care).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we disagree with Tuomey Regional's assertion that patients do not decide where to seek care based on the relationship between a hospital and its physicians. While an emergency room may be selected because it is the nearest one, patients in urban areas often may choose from several. Patients make those decisions based primarily on the reputation of the hospital, which it often has aggressively promoted, and not on the reputation of individual emergency room physicians. In such situations, patients understandably and correctly expect to be cared for by physicians and other staff members carefully selected and approved by the hospital.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe reject Tuomey Regional's contention that this decision should be left to the Legislature. Courts created, then eliminated, charitable immunity for hospitals. The same policy considerations at work in those cases make it proper for the courts to impose this nondelegable duty on hospitals. Cf. Brown v. Anderson County Hosp. Ass'n, 268 S.C. at 485-86, 234 S.E.2d at 876 (rejecting argument that Court should leave any changes in charitable immunity doctrine to Legislature because courts created it and it had become inconsistent with legislative and judicial policy in tort law).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe conclude the Court of Appeals properly outlined and applied the public policy considerations in question. Our decision, like those made by other courts that have considered this issue and held hospitals liable under one or more theories, is grounded primarily in those considerations. Given the fundamental shift in the role that a hospital plays in our health care system, the commercialization of American medicine, and the public perception of the unity of a hospital and its emergency room, we hold that a hospital owes a nondelegable duty to render competent service to its emergency room patients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, we conclude it is not necessary, as the Court of Appeals did in the cases at hand, to impose an absolute nondelegable duty on hospitals. Instead, we adopt the approach expressed in Restatement (Second) of Torts: Employers of Contractors Â§ 429 (1965). That section, sometimes described as ostensible agency, provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  One who employs an independent contractor to perform services for another which are accepted in the reasonable belief that the services are being rendered by the employer or by his servants, is subject to liability for physical harm caused by the negligence of the contractor in supplying such services, to the same extent as though the employer were supplying them himself or by his servants.\r\n\r\nSection 429 applies not only when the injured person accepts services in the belief they are being rendered by the independent contractor's employer, but also when a third person accepts such services on the injured person's behalf and reasonably believes the services are being rendered to the injured person by the independent contractor's employer. See section 429 cmt. a; Restatement (Second) of Torts, Introductory Note to Â§Â§ 416-429 at p.394 (explaining that various nondelegable duties are imposed \"in situations in which, for reasons of policy, the employer is not permitted to shift the responsibility for the proper conduct of the work to the contractor\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder section 429, the plaintiff must show that (1) the hospital held itself out to the public by offering to provide services; (2) the plaintiff looked to the hospital, rather than the individual physician, for care; and (3) a person in similar circumstances reasonably would have believed that the physician who treated him or her was a hospital employee. When the plaintiff does so, the hospital will be held vicariously liable for any negligent or wrongful acts committed by the treating physician. The hospital may attempt to avoid liability for the physician's acts by demonstrating the plaintiff failed to prove these factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNumerous courts have relied on section 429 in decisions allowing a plaintiff to attempt to hold a hospital vicariously liable for a purportedly independent physician's negligent acts. E.g., Walker v. Winchester Mem'1 Hosp. , 585 F. Supp. 1328, 1330 (W.D. Va. 1984); Stewart v. Midani, 525 F. Supp. 843, 851 (N.D. Ga. 1981); Jackson v. Power, 743 P.2d at 1380; Richmond County Hosp.

Super. Ct. 1980).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the present cases involve emergency room physicians, our decision is not necessarily limited to such physicians. It is limited, however, to those situations in which a patient seeks services at the hospital as an institution, and is treated by a physician who reasonably appears to be a hospital employee. Our holding does not extend to situations in which the patient is treated in an emergency room by the patient's own physician after arranging to meet the physician there. Nor does our holding encompass situations in which a patient is admitted to a hospital by a private, independent physician whose only connection to a particular hospital is that he or she has staff privileges to admit patients to the hospital. Such patients could not reasonably believe his or her physician is a hospital employee. See Ward v. Lutheran Hosps. &amp; Homes Soc. of America Inc, 963 P.2d 1031 (Alaska 1998) (reaffirming Jackson, supra, and holding that hospital was not liable under nondelegable duty or apparent agency doctrines for allegedly negligent acts of private, independent physicians who had staff privileges to treat their patients at hospital); Menzie v. Windham Comm. Mem'1 Hosp, 774 F. Supp. 91 (D. Conn. 1991); Jackson, 743 P.2d at 1385; Richmond County Hosp. Auth., 361 S.E.2d at 166.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed in the light most favorable to respondents, the record in the present cases shows that they may allege that they or their relative sought care at Tuomey Regional's emergency room based on the hospital's offering of services to the public, that they looked to the hospital to provide the care, not an individual physician, and that they were treated by physicians who reasonably appeared to be hospital employees. Genuine issues of material fact exist; therefore, summary judgment is not appropriate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the Court of Appeals' decision to impose a nondelegable duty on hospitals with regard to the physicians who practice in their emergency rooms. We adopt the Restatement of Torts (Second) Â§ 429 instead of imposing an absolute duty on hospitals. In both respondents' cases, we reverse the grant of summary judgment to Tuomey Regional on the ground of nondelegable duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals found that its decision on the nondelegable duty issue rendered the issue of apparent agency moot. Simmons, 330 S.C. at 118 n.l, 498 S.E.2d at 409 n.1. Respondents in their brief to this Court assert the Court of Appeals' reversal of summary judgment includes a reversal of the trial judge's ruling on the apparent agency cause of action. Respondents urge this Court to affirm the reversal of summary judgment on the ground of apparent agency. Tuomey Regional, apparently believing the Court of Appeals did not rule on the apparent agency issue, contends there is no reason to remand the case to the Court of Appeals for further consideration because the apparent agency issue is without merit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could remand the apparent agency issue to the Court of Appeals for its consideration and ordinarily would find that an appropriate disposition. However, we conclude it is unnecessary to remand this case to the Court of Appeals because the parties have raised both issues to us on the merits and because the analyses of apparent agency and nondelegable duty are so closely intertwined in this instance. Although closely related, each is a viable theory an injured patient may assert. Accordingly, we also reverse the grant of summary judgment to Tuomey Regional on the ground of apparent agency in both respondents' cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe remand respondents' cases to circuit court for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice George T.

Ariail, of Greenville, all for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, A.J.: Appellant Michael Martin (\"Defendant\") and Pierre Wilson (\"Co-defendant Wilson\") were convicted of murder. Defendant has appealed. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/ PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nDwayne Cobb (\"Victim\") was found dead in his apartment on October 16, 1996. Victim's body was found face down in a bucket of water. Drowning was the official cause of death. No time of death was established, but Victim was last seen alive around 2:00 a.m. to 2:15 a.m.. The coroner testified that Victim had eaten a fish sandwich within 2 hours prior to his death, but when Victim ate the sandwich is unknown. His body was not discovered until around noon the following day.\r\nVictim was a barber who regularly gave haircuts both at his place of employment and at his apartment. On October 15, 1996, the day before his murder, Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson were both at Victim's apartment between 11:30 a.m. and noon so that Co-defendant Wilson could get a haircut. During the haircut, Victim's friend Shannon Cobb 1  arrived at the apartment. Both defendants left the apartment after the haircut. Victim and Shannon Cobb then left to run errands and take Cobb to work. Cobb testified that Victim discussed with Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson his plans to travel to New York to do some shopping.\r\nDuring the afternoon, Victim visited his friend Derrick Haygood in Clemson and they played with their pet dogs. Around 6:00 p.m., Victim and Haygood left Clemson and went to Seneca. Later that night, Victim picked up Shannon Cobb from work at 11:30 p.m. The two then went by the Steak and Waffle to get take-out food to eat. Victim took Cobb to her apartment, stayed a few minutes, got a beep on his beeper from Derrick Haygood, used the phone, and left. An unknown amount of time after leaving her apartment, Victim called Shannon Cobb to tell her the Steak and Waffle had given him a fish sandwich instead of the chicken sandwich he ordered. Derrick Haygood and his girlfriend Annitra Robinson testified that Victim stopped by his apartment in Clemson around 2:00 a.m. the morning of his murder. Victim stayed for a only a brief period of time and left. Victim's home is about a 5 minute drive from Haygood's trailer.\r\nDefendant and Co-defendant Wilson shared an apartment in Pendleton with each other and Defendant's girlfriend Marsha Bhagwandin, an entertainer at a Greenville bar named Nepal's. Bhagwandin testified that around 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. on the day before the murder Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson took her to work. They kept Bhagwandin's car, a 1996 black Mustang with tinted windows which had an air freshener and parking pass hanging from the rear view mirror. They were to pick her up at 2:00 a.m. when she got off work. When they were late picking Bhagwandin up from work, she left Nepal's and went to a bar called The Hourglass on Laurens Road in Greenville. Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson arrived at The Hourglass around 3:45 a.m. to take Bhagwandin home. When asked why they were late, Bhagwandin testified that Defendant replied \"some shit happened\" and that Co-defendant Wilson added \"somebody may have died tonight.\" The three went home to Pendleton and stayed there the rest of the night.\r\n\r\nWitness Kalita Owens testified that she left a friend's apartment between 2:00 a.m. and 3:00 a.m. the day of the murder. The friend's apartment was only two doors down from Victim's apartment. Owens testified that in front of the apartment building was a dark colored sports car with tinted windows that had something hanging from the rear view mirror. She testified it caught her attention because she had never seen it there before even though she was at her friend's apartment almost daily.\r\nOn October 16, 1996, Victim was to take his friend Shannon Cobb to get the tires changed on her car. When Victim didn't show up or answer his pager, Cobb went to his apartment. Around 11:45 a.m., when Victim did not answer his door, Cobb got a maintenance worker to let her into the apartment. Victim's body was discovered on the floor of the apartment face down in a pot of water. The maintenance worker called the police. The cause of Victim's death was drowning, although the pathologist discovered Victim had a black eye and a bloody nose as well.\r\nAround 11:00 a.m. on the morning of the murder, the manager of T-Bones Restaurant in Greenville noticed several bags of garbage in the store's dumpster. T-Bones is located on the same Laurens Road in Greenville as The Hourglass bar where Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson picked up Bhagwandin the night before. The manager found in the trash several items including a cell phone, jewelry, and a photograph of Victim's apartment that Victim's uncle identified as personal items belonging to Victim. Also in the trash were dark colored clothes, a pair of female underwear, and a pair of large sneakers. Latex gloves where also found in the trash that the uncle did not identify as Victim's. Bhagwandin testified that she had bought similar latex gloves to use while cleaning her dog and apartment before moving in with Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson.\r\n\r\nAccording to the testimony of Sylvia Jimenez and her son Jesse Jimenez, two black men named Michael and Pierre stopped by Sylvia's daughter's apartment in Seneca around 12:30 a.m. and stayed for about 15 minutes the morning of the murder. Jesse testified that the two were wearing black clothes and driving a black mustang with tinted windows. The clothing color is significant because the articles of clothing found in the dumpster behind T Bones along with the Victim's belongings were black clothes.\r\nThe State entered Co-defendant Wilson's statement to the police into the record. Co-defendant Wilson stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n  Dwayne was my barber, he cut my hair Tuesday morning at about nine or ten a.m. He was cutting another guy's hair when I got there so I had to wait. I was there about an hour, then I left, I went back home to Pendleton, my roommate was there with his girlfriend, we took her to work around 6:30 p.m., then we went to the movies, we saw Last Man Standing, the movie started at 9:55 p.m. After the movie we rode around and then we went to pick up Marcia [Bhagwandin] at Nepal's around two a.m. After that we went to the Huddle House to eat, after eating we went back home to Pendleton.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter entering the statement, the State rested. Both defendants made motions for a directed verdict that the trial court denied. Neither defendant put up a defense. The jury returned with a guilty verdict for both Defendant and Co-defendant Wilson. Defendant has appealed and the issues before the Court are:\r\n\r\n\r\n  I.  Did the trial court err by not granting a directed verdict at the conclusion of the State's case based on a failure to produce substantial evidence of Defendant's guilt?\r\n  II.  Did the trial court err by denying a motion for a mistrial after the solicitor emphasized Defendant's lack of remorse and failure to present a defense?\r\n  III.  Did the trial court err by not granting a directed verdict after the solicitor stated in his closing that \"we will probably never know which one of these defendants actually did the killing.\"? \r\n    \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.  Failure to Grant a Directed Verdict Based on a Lack of Evidence\r\nDefendant argues the trial court erred by not directing a verdict because the State failed to place him at the scene of the crime or show his participation in the killing of the Victim. We agree.\r\nThe trial court has a duty to submit the case to the jury where the evidence is circumstantial, if there is substantial circumstantial evidence which reasonably tends to prove the guilt of the accused or from which his guilt may be fairly and logically deduced. State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996). The trial judge should grant a directed verdict motion when the evidence merely raises a suspicion that the accused is guilty. State v. Irvin, 270 S.C. 539, 243 S.E.2d 195 (1978). In reviewing the appeal of a refusal to grant a directed verdict of not guilty, this Court must look at the evidence in the light most favorable to the State. Williams, 321 S.C. at 332-33, 243 S.E.2d at 629.\r\nIn this case, the State failed to meet the \"any substantial evidence\" standard. Most significantly, the State's evidence failed to place either defendant inside the apartment. The Solicitor himself summed up the State's failure of proof by confessing to the trial judge \"we don't know which person actually held [Victim's] head in that pan of water\" and \"Your Honor, the whole point is we don't know if they acted in concert.\" Put another way, unlike the usual accomplice liability case or aiding and abetting situation, here the State had no proof that .either defendant held Victim's head under water and the State had no proof that the defendants were working together to bring about the Victim's death.\r\nTaken in a light most favorable to its position, the State's has shown that a car resembling the one in possession of the Defendant was parked at the Victim's apartment complex the night the murder was committed. There is no evidence (such as a license tag number) that the black car was actually Bhagwandin's black mustang. The State also presented no evidence that both defendants arrived at the apartment complex in that car or that either defendant entered Victim's apartment. Furthermore, there is no evidence establishing the death occurred during the time the black car was in front of the building.\r\nThis case is similar to State v. Schrock, 283 S.C. 129, 322 S.E.2d 450 (1984), in which this Court reversed the denial of a directed verdict in a murder conviction. In Schrock, the State presented evidence the defendant was in the area of the murders and that footprints at the scene of the crime were-similar to footprints found in the area in which Schrock admitted he had been walking. In this case, the black car seen at the apartment is not identified as Bhagwandin's car. Like the footprints in Schrock, the possibility that it was the same car, without any other evidence placing the defendants at the scene, is not enough evidence to place Defendant inside Victim's apartment.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE the trial court's denial of a directed verdict. Accordingly, we need not address the other issues on appeal.\r\nFINNEY, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n1No family relation to the victim. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25101","title":"Aughtry v.

Ben Bowen, of Bowen, McKenzie &amp; Bowen, L.L.P., of Greenville, for petitioner.\r\n        Michael A. Farry and David Wilson, both of Horton, Drawdy, Ward &amp; Black, of Greenville, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: We granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals denying petitioner worker's compensation benefits. Aughtry v. Abbeville County School Dist. #60, 332 S.C. 453, 504 S.E.2d 830 (Ct. App. 1998). We now reverse and reinstate the full commission's order which found petitioner suffered a compensable injury and remanded the case to the single commissioner for a determination of benefits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner was employed as an assistant principal at Abbeville High School. On the day of the accident, the school's opening was delayed until 10:00 a.m. because of icy road conditions. Petitioner was called at home by the principal and told to report to the High School at 7:30 a.m., his usual time. As petitioner was driving to work, his car skidded on the icy road behind the school and came to rest on the school's football practice field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe full commission found petitioner suffered a compensable injury, and the circuit court affirmed. The Court of Appeals reversed in a 2-1 decision, holding recovery was barred by the \"going and coming\" rule. 1 We find Judge Anderson's dissent persuasive, and hold the \"going and coming\" rule inapplicable to these unusual circumstances. Petitioner's injury occurred on the school premises, when his car landed on the practice football field. Substantial evidence in the record therefore supports the full commission's order finding that petitioner \"sustained a compensable injury. . . while on the employer's premises . . . .\", Medlin v. Upstate Plaster Serv., 329 S.C. 92, 495 S.E.2d 447 (1998), and it should be upheld. Accordingly, the decision of the majority of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 As a general rule, an employee who is injured while going to or coming\r\nfrom the place where his work is performed is not entitled to worker's\r\ncompensation. See, e.g., Medlin v.

Social Club (\"the Adult Businesses\") challenged the constitutionality of a Greenville County (\"the County\") permitting and zoning ordinance. The trial court found the ordinance constitutional and the sexually oriented businesses have appealed. We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn February 1995, the County enacted Greenville County Zoning Ordinance No. 2673 (\"the Ordinance\") regulating the location of all sexually oriented businesses. The Ordinance requires sexually oriented businesses to obtain a permit from the County's zoning administrator in order to operate. Furthermore, the Ordinance controls where sexually oriented businesses can locate. The Adult Businesses are all sexually oriented businesses located in zoned areas that do not permit adult uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County sent each Adult Business a letter informing them they were in violation of the Ordinance and had one year to comply. At the end of that year, none of the Adult Businesses had complied with the Ordinance and the County ordered them closed. The Adult Businesses then filed suit claiming the Ordinance is unconstitutional and sought injunctive relief against the County. The County counterclaimed seeking an injunction requiring the Adult Businesses to comply with the Ordinance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt trial, the Adult Businesses argued the Ordinance is an unconstitutional prior restraint because it fails to provide for prompt judicial review. Also, the Adult Businesses argued that the Ordinance impermissibly zoned them out of the County. The Adult Businesses supported this argument with expert testimony that only four to five S-1 sites were available in the County for sexually oriented businesses to locate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County responded by pointing out that the Ordinance required a permit to be issued within 30 days of the application unless one of seven specified conditions existed. The County argued that this time limit provided for prompt judicial review because if the permit was not issued within the 30 days, the sexually oriented business could seek relief from the court system. The County also presented expert testimony showing fourteen available S-1 sites. The expert also estimated that there were \"a couple of hundred\" sites available in the unzoned portion of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court ruled for the County on all issues. Initially, the trial court determined over one hundred sites existed for relocation in the unzoned portion of the County. Furthermore, the trial court found nine S-1 sites existed in the County where the Adult Businesses could relocate. Based on these findings, the trial court concluded the Adult Businesses were not impermissibly zoned out of the County.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial court also found the Ordinance was not an unconstitutional prior restraint because the zoning administrator did not have unbridled discretion in granting or denying a permit. Also, the trial court ruled that the relatively brief 30 day period between the permit application and decision by the zoning administrator guaranteed prompt judicial review. The Adult Businesses appealed and the following issues are before the Court:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (1)  Did the trial court err in finding the Ordinance was not an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech?\r\n  (2)  Did the trial court err in finding the Ordinance was a reasonable time, manner, and place restriction because there were locations both in the zoned and unzoned areas of the County where the Adult Businesses could relocate?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur United States Supreme Court has held that businesses providing non-obscene, sexually explicit material are entitled to protection by the First and Fourteenth Amendment. See Young v. American Mini Theatres, Inc., 427 U.S. 50, 96 S. Ct. 2440 (1976); City of Renton v. Playtime Theatres, Inc., 475 U.S. 41, 106 S. Ct. 925 (1986); see also Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560, 111 S. Ct. 2456 (1991)(recognizing that nude dancing also receives First Amendment protection). However, the Supreme Court has also recognized sexually oriented businesses may have negative secondary effects, such as an increase in crime, on their surrounding communities. Young, 427 U.S. at 471, 96 S. Ct. at 2452-53. In light of these secondary effects, the Supreme Court has allowed local governments to regulate sexually oriented businesses, not based on the content of the speech, but as a response to their negative impact on the community. Id. Most often, local governments have chosen to use zoning restrictions and licensing requirements as the tools to balance free speech concerns with the regulation of secondary effects.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLocal governments can enact zoning laws based on their police power to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the community. See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-23-10 (1976); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-7-10 (1976). Zoning laws that have the effect of restricting freedom of expression without regard to the content of the speech are referred to as \"content neutral\" laws. Renton, at 46-47, 106 S. Ct. at 928. Zoning ordinances merely restricting the location of adult businesses without banning them altogether are considered content neutral as long as they are based on their prevention of the harmful secondary effects the Supreme Court has noted these sexually oriented businesses may cause. Id. Since these zoning laws are considered content neutral, they are evaluated as \"time,  place, and manner\" regulations for purposes of determining their validity under the First Amendment. Id. Permissible time, place, and manner restrictions are justified by a substantial governmental interest unrelated to free speech and allows for adequate alternative avenues of communication of the sexually explicit material. Id. Therefore, sexually oriented business regulations will be upheld if they are designed to serve the substantial governmental interest of preventing harmful secondary effects and they allow for reasonable avenues of communication. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on their police powers described above, local governments may also impose licensing requirements on adult businesses. However, when a municipality imposes licensing requirements on only businesses which retail a certain kind of speech, such as non-obscene, sexually explicit speech, serious questions as to the validity of the licensing requirements arise. See FW /PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 225, 110 S.Ct. 596, 604 (1990). In order not to offend the First Amendment, such licensing regulations must satisfy two tests: (1) the regulation must impose adequate standards for officials to apply in rendering a decision as whether to grant, deny, or revoke a license; and (2) the regulation must also impose procedural safeguards. Id. at 225-26, 110 S. Ct. at 605.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe County attempts to use both forms of regulations of businesses retailing sexually explicit materials: zoning restrictions based on location and imposition of licensing requirements. The Ordinance in this case is basically a duplicate of the Richland County ordinance this Court analyzed in both Centaur, Inc. v. Richland County, 301 S.C. 374, 392 S.E.2d 165 (1990) and Rothschild v. Richland County Bd. of Adjustment, 309 S.C. 194, 420 S.E.2d 853 (1992). Those cases focused mainly on whether the Richland County ordinance was a proper time, place, and manner zoning restriction. In regards to the licensing requirement, Centaur only analyzed whether the ordinance imposed adequate standards for officials to apply in rendering a decision as whether to deny, suspend, or revoke a license. However, as Centaur's footnote 4 makes clear, this Court did not discuss whether the licensing requirement met procedural safeguards so as to be constitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  THE COUNTY'S ORDINANCE AS AN UNCONSTITUTIONAL PRIOR RESTRAINT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adult Businesses argue that the Ordinance's licensing requirement operates as an unconstitutional prior restraint on speech because it fails to impose adequate procedural safeguards. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adult Businesses base their arguments on FW/PBS, Inc. v. City of Dallas, 493 U.S. 215, 110 S.Ct. 596 (1990). In FW/PBS, the Supreme Court struck down a Dallas licensing scheme as being an impermissible prior restraint on protected speech. In finding the permitting scheme improper, the U.S. Supreme Court outlined a two prong analysis:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [T]he licensor must make the decision whether to issue the license within a specified and reasonable time period during which the status quo is maintained, and there must be the possibility of prompt judicial review in the event that the license is erroneously denied.\r\n\r\nId. at 228, 110 S. Ct. at 606. The Supreme Court struck down the Dallas scheme because it failed to require the licensor to make the decision whether to issue the license \"within a specified and reasonable time period.\" The FW /PBS opinion did not address the second prong of \"prompt judicial review.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  THE ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn regards to the first prong of the Supreme Court's test, the Ordinance differs significantly from the Dallas ordinance found unconstitutional in FW /PBS. Under the Ordinance, the County Zoning Administrator has 30 days from the date of the application to issue a permit to a sexually oriented business. Unlike the unconstitutional Dallas ordinance, all necessary inspections of the Adult Business applicant must be completed within 21 days of the application. Therefore, 30 days is the longest period of time that a sexually oriented business permit applicant would have to wait for the County's zoning administrator's decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the lower court failed to discuss the procedure for appealing a decision by the County zoning administrator. Before appealing to the circuit court, the Adult Businesses must exhaust all administrative remedies. See generally Garris v. Governing Bd. of South Carolina Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 511 S.E.2d 48 (1998). Since the Ordinance fails to proscribe any special method for appealing a permit denial by the zoning administrator, the standard process for appealing a zoning administrator's decision would apply. The record does not contain the Greenville Ordinances controlling appeals from zoning administrator decisions. Furthermore, this Court cannot take judicial notice of such local ordinances. Kincaid v. Landing Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 89, 344 S.E.2d 869 (Ct. App. 1986). Without those ordinances, it is impossible to know whether the zoning administrator's decision is immediately appealable to the circuit court, or whether the zoning administrator's decision must first be heard by a board of zoning appeals in order to exhaust all administrative remedies. In any event, it is impossible to determine the full time period necessary to reach a final administrative decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the ordinances governing appeals from the zoning administrator are not part of the record on appeal, we affirm the lower court's decision on this\r\n issue in favor of the County. The Adult Businesses failed to include these ordinances in the record on appeal. The Adult Businesses, as the appellant in this issue, have the burden of presenting this Court with an adequate record. Goode v. St. Stephens United Methodist Church, 329 S.C. 433, 446-47, 494 S.E.2d 827, 834 (Ct. App. 1997). Without the necessary County ordinances, this Court cannot determine the time period between the initial permit application and a final appealable administrative decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB.  PROMPT JUDICIAL REVIEW\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adult Businesses argue that the trial court erred in finding that mere access to the state court system satisfies FW/PBS's requirement of \"prompt judicial review.\" We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrior to the FW/PBS decision, prompt judicial review required a final judicial determination on the merits. In Freedman v. Maryland, 380 U.S. 51, 59, 85 S. Ct. 734, 739 (1965), the Supreme Court stated:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Any restraint imposed in advance of a final judicial determination on the merits must similarly be limited to preservation of the status quo for the shortest fixed period compatible with sound judicial resolution . . . [T]he procedure must . . . assure a prompt final judicial decision, to minimize the deterrent effect of an interim and possible erroneous denial of a license. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nHowever, since the FW /PBS decision, the federal circuits have split on retaining the \"final judicial determination on the merits\" requirement as an element of prompt judicial review. This split occurred because Justice O'Connor used language in her opinion such as the \"possibility of,\" or the provision of \"an avenue for,\" prompt judicial review as the essence of the safeguard. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits hold the view that \"prompt judicial review\" continues to require a timely judicial determination on the merits. See Baby Tam &amp; Co. v. City of Las Vegas, 154 F.3d 1097, 1101-02 (9th Cir. 1998); 11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George's County, 58 F.3d 988, 998-1001 (4th Cir. 1995); East Brooks Books, Inc. v. City of Memphis, 48 F.3d 220, 225 (6th Cir. 1995). These courts have reasoned that because a person always has a judicial forum available when his or her speech is allegedly encroached, \"to hold that mere access to judicial review fulfills [Freedman's prompt review requirement] makes the safeguard itself meaningless.\" Baby Tam, 154 F.3d at 1101. As the Ninth Circuit explained in Baby Tam:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The phrase \"judicial review\" compels this conclusion. The phrase necessarily has two elements -- (1) consideration of a dispute by a judicial officer, and (2) a decision. Without consideration, there is no review; without a decision, the most exhaustive review is worthless. In baseball terms it would be like throwing a pitch and not getting a call. As legendary major league umpire Bill Klem once said to an inquisitive catcher: \"It ain't nothin' till I call it.\" This is also true of judicial review. Until the judicial officer makes the call, it ain't nothin'.\r\n\r\nId. at 1101-02. In these cases a \"final\" determination does not refer to a court's decision becoming final through various rehearing and appellate procedures. Id. A final determination means that a judicial officer should make the final decision denying a license rather than an administrative officer. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Courts of the First, Fifth, and Seventh Circuits have approached the meaning of \"prompt judicial review\" differently after the FW/PBS case.  See TK's Video, Inc. v. Denton County, 24 F.3d 705, 709 (5th Cir.1994); Graff v. City of Chicago, 9 F.3d 1309, 1324-25 (7th Cir.1993); Jews for Jesus, Inc. v. Massachusetts Bay Transp. Auth., 984 F.2d 1319, 1327 (1st Cir.1993). These Circuits have found that prompt access to judicial review is sufficient, even if there is no time frame for either a hearing or a decision on the merits. See TK's Video, Inc., 24 F.3d at 709; Graff, 9 F.3d at 1324-25.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to comport with the requirements of Freedman and FW /PBS, we choose to follow the Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits by requiring that the procedure provide for a final judicial determination within a reasonable time frame. Otherwise, the prompt judicial review requirement loses all significance since the protection afforded by judicial review is meaningful only when it can be anticipated within a brief time period. Also, whether the FW/PBS decision could even alter the prompt judicial review standard as set by Freedman is questionable due to the fractured nature of the FW/PBS court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the current case, there is no guarantee that a judicial hearing will be held or a decision will be rendered within a prescribed period of time. Because of the absence of such a guarantee, the licensing scheme fails to provide for prompt judicial review. 2  Without prompt judicial review, the Ordinance's permitting scheme is unconstitutional. The other portions of the Ordinance are severable from those sections pertaining only to the licensing requirements for adult businesses. See Joytime Distrib. &amp; Amusement Co. v. State, Op. No. 25007 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Oct. 23, 1999) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 32 at 10). As such, those portions of the Ordinance not addressed in this opinion may still be enforced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC.  PERMIT SUSPENSIONS BY THE ZONING ADMINISTRATOR\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adult Businesses argue on appeal that the Ordinance is unconstitutional because of the power granted to the zoning administrator to unilaterally suspend the permits of sexually oriented businesses. This issue has not been preserved for review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn order to be preserved for review, the lower court must rule upon the issue. Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71, 497 S.E.2d 731(1998). The trial court order does not address the power of permit suspension by the zoning administrator. Since the Adult Businesses failed to have the trial court rule on this issue, this Court will not address it on appeal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  THE ORDINANCE DOES NOT ZONE THE ADULT BUSINESSES OUT OF EXISTENCE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Adult Businesses argue section 12(a) of the Ordinance unreasonably limits alternative avenues of communication because it restricts the location of sexually oriented businesses to S-1 zoned property and that not enough S-1 property is available for relocation. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 12 of the Ordinance has nine subsections regulating the permissible locations of sexually oriented businesses. Section (a) states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A person commits a misdemeanor if he operates or causes to be operated a sexually oriented business outside of a designated S-1 district. All sexually oriented businesses shall be located within a S-1 district.\r\n\r\nWhen read alone, this section appears to prevent a sexually oriented business from locating in the unzoned portion of the County. However, subsection (i) of Section 12 states:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  With the exception of subsection (a) above, the provisions of this ordinance shall apply to those areas of the county that are not zoned. (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nSubsection (i) specifically excludes the S-1 zoning requirement of subsection (a) from applying to sexually oriented businesses located in unzoned areas of the County. \"In construing statutory language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given effect.\" TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Dept. of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, 503 S.E.2d 471, 476 (1998). Also, \"statutes are to be construed in favor of constitutionality, and the court will presume a legislative act is constitutionally valid unless a clear showing to the contrary is made.\" Bradley v. Hullander, 277 S.C. 327, 330, 287 S.E.2d 140,141 (1982). When read together, subsection (i) allows sexually oriented businesses to locate in the County's unzoned areas while still requiring such businesses to meet the other requirements of Section 12.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the trial court made the factual finding that nine S-1 sites existed in the County where the Adult Businesses could relocate. An action for a declaratory judgment that a zoning ordinance is invalid is at law. Peterson v. City of Clemson, 312 S.C. 162, 439 S.E.2d 317 (Ct. App. 1993). In actions at law tried without a jury, the findings of fact of the judge will not be disturbed on appeal unless found to be without evidence which reasonably supports them. Townes Assocs. Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 221 S.E.2d 773 (1976). Since the trial court found that nine S-1 sites are available for relocation, more than enough S-1 properties exist where the six Adult Businesses could relocate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite finding the permitting scheme of the Ordinance at issue unconstitutional, this Court continues to view local governmental regulation of sexually oriented businesses as proper. See Restaurant Row Associates v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 516 S.E.2d .442 (1999). As with other legislative enactments, this Court accords ordinances regulating sexually oriented businesses a presumption of constitutionality which the attacking party has the burden of overcoming. See Centaur, Inc. v. Richland County, 301 S.C. 374, 392 S.E.2d 165 (1990). However, when zoning ordinances invoke First Amendment concerns, we must follow the guidelines supplied by the United States Supreme Court. Id., 301 S.C. at 379, 392 S.E.2d at 168. That precedent requires local municipalities to tailor their sexually oriented business regulations to address their local situations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRichland County's zoning situation is very different from Greenville County's in that the former is wholly zoned and the later is not. Whether a sexually oriented business zoning regulation is designed to serve a substantial governmental interest and allows for reasonable avenues of communication is a question that must be answered in light of the particular situation of each locality that enacts such an ordinance. Municipalities different from Richland County cannot merely copy the ordinance at issue in Centaur and expect to automatically meet every constitutional requirement. Each governmental body must look at its own situation and do the legal work necessary to ensure that their laws comport with precedent from this Court as well as the United States Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing, we REVERSE the trial court's decision, and hold that the permitting scheme of the Greenville County ordinance is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C . J . , MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n1 The Fourth Circuit has taken the position that because of the fragmented nature of the FW /PBS decision, this case does not effectuate any change in the prompt judicial review requirement. The Fourth Circuit held: \r\n\r\n  Moreover, it is well settled that \"[w]hen a fragmented Court decides a case and no single rationale explaining the result enjoys the assent of five Justices, 'the holding of the Court may be viewed as that position taken by those Members who concurred in the judgments on the narrowest grounds.' (Citations omitted) Thus,\r\n    even if Justice O'Connor's opinion in FW /PBS could be read as having altered the Freedman \"prompt judicial review\" factor . . . because this position obviously did not gain the assent of the concurring Justices (Brennan, Marshall, and Blackmun, who made clear that they believed that all three of the Freedman procedural safeguards were required), FW /PBS could not have modified Freedman.\"\r\n\r\n11126 Baltimore Blvd., Inc. v. Prince George's County, 58 F.3d 988, 999 (1995).\r\n2 We recognize that under the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, municipal issues of this type are not expedited or required to be decided within a certain time frame. Other states have specific provisions in their rules of civil procedure that allow for such expedited review. See e.g., Pa.. R. Civ. P. 1531(f)(1). Without such a provision, a municipality cannot guarantee that a judicial hearing will be held and a decision rendered within any specific amount of time. This procedural problem illustrates how constitutionally perilous it can be for a municipality to use a licensing scheme to regulate protected speech. Zoning schemes, although they have First Amendment concerns of their own, have met with greater success in balancing free speech concerns with the regulation of adult businesses. See Restaurant Row Associates v. Horry County, 335 S.C. 209, 516 S.E.2d 442 (1999); Condor, Inc. v. Board of Zoning Appeals, 328 S.C. 173, 493 S.E.2d 342 (1997); Rothschild v.

In the Matter of Duncan, Op. No. 25127 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May 15, 2000). Respondent has filed a petition for rehearing asking the Court to delete the phrase \"and Rule 7(a)(7)(wilfully violating a valid court order)\" at the end of the second paragraph on page 3 of the opinion.

Richardson, Jr. and Michael S. Pauley, of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance proceeding, respondent admits that he has committed ethical violations and consents to the imposition of a sanction to be determined by this Court. We accept respondent's admission and find an indefinite suspension is the appropriate sanction. The suspension shall be retroactive to July 30, 1999, the date on which respondent was temporarily suspended from the practice of law. 1\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts as stated in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent are as follows. Respondent represented a client who was under investigation in Lexington County for several crimes, including murder. On or about May 29, 1995, the client was questioned by law enforcement personnel in the polygraph room of the Lexington County Law Enforcement Center. When the questioning was interrupted, respondent, who had been present in the Law Enforcement Center, but not in the polygraph room, entered the polygraph room and engaged in a conversation with his client. Because respondent and his client were alone in the polygraph room, there was an expectation of privacy for purposes of engaging in privileged and confidential attorney-client communications. However, unbeknownst to respondent, his conversation with the client was being recorded on videotape by personnel of the Lexington County Sheriff's Department who were stationed in an adjacent room. Immediately after leaving the polygraph room, respondent's client was arrested on the charge of murder. He was later charged with first degree burglary, armed robbery, assault and battery with intent to kill and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, all in connection with the matters under investigation at the time of the unauthorized taping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent did not learn of the unauthorized taping until August 1997. Respondent obtained a copy of the tape from the public defender who, along with another court appointed attorney, had taken over representation of the client. Respondent contacted a reporter for a local television station about the tape. Respondent gave the tape to the reporter, or caused the tape to be given to the reporter, in reliance on an agreement between the two that the television station would copy the tape, but that only the video portion of the tape would be broadcast. The reporter also agreed not to reveal the source from which the copy of the tape was obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent gave the tape to the reporter with knowledge that the tape and the news reports related thereto would most likely be broadcast extensively in the midlands of South Carolina, including Lexington County, where the client would eventually be tried, as well as throughout the State. It was respondent's intent, in giving the tape to the reporter, to influence the upcoming trial to the client's advantage and to make known the actions of the Lexington County Sheriff's Department in taping his client. Following broadcast of the tape, respondent provided an affidavit for use in the client's trial wherein he stated he did not believe that either the State or the client could receive a fair trial in Lexington County as a result of the release of the tape to the news media. Respondent acknowledges that the release of the tape created considerable additional work for the parties and the courts of this State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn or about March 18, 1998, respondent was called to testify before a federal grand jury which was conducting an investigation into whether the unauthorized taping by personnel of the Lexington County Sheriff's Department violated federal wiretapping laws. While under oath, respondent knowingly made a false material declaration to the grand jury. Specifically, respondent testified that he did not provide the tape to the media and that he did not know who provided the tape to the media. On or about July 29, 1999, respondent pled guilty to one count of making a false declaration to a grand jury in violation of 18 U.S.C. Â§ 1623. He was sentenced to four months in prison, four months under home confinement, and two years of supervised release, and fined $33,386.92.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR); Rule 7(a)(4)(conviction of a serious crime); Rule 7(a)(5)(engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6)(violating the oath of office).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 3.3(a)(1) (making a false statement of material fact to a tribunal); Rule 3.6(a) (making an extrajudicial statement about a case that the lawyer would expect to be disseminated by the media knowing that it will have a substantial likelihood of materially prejudicing an adjudicative proceeding in the matter); Rule 8.4(a) (violating or attempting to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(b) (commission of a criminal act which reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(c) (engaging in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (engaging in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is therefore ordered that respondent shall be indefinitely suspended from the practice of law in this State. This suspension shall be retroactive to July 30, 1999, the date on which he was temporarily suspended from the practice of law. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n1 In the Matter of Duncan, 336 S.C. 148, 519 S.E.2d 561 (1999). \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25144","title":"State v.

Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald J. Zelenka, and Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland; and Solicitor Donald V. Myers, of Lexington, forrespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: We are asked to determine whether the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to accept appellant's guilty plea when the indictment was not stamped \"true bill.\" We remand for a hearing to determine whether the indictment was true billed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant Marcus Antonio Grim pled guilty to charges of murder, armed robbery, criminal conspiracy, possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, and pointing a firearm. He was sentenced to thirty years for the murder, with all the other sentences to run concurrently. The day after his plea, defense counsel discovered the armed robbery indictment, while signed and dated by the foreman of the grand jury, did not indicate the action taken by the grand jury. 1  At a subsequent hearing, the trial judge stated he had taken the grand jury's report and every indictment submitted to it that day was true billed; however, there is no actual evidence of this in the record. The trial judge stated to appellant:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There are two ways that I can go about correcting this, one would be to have the foreman of the grand jury come back up here and I would have him testify as to the action they took. The other would be if you would be willing to waive presentment to the grand jury of this indictment so that the plea that I took yesterday would then be in proper order and proper form.\r\n\r\nAppellant agreed to waive presentment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the trial court have subject matter jurisdiction to accept appellant's plea?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAppellant argues the trial court did not have subject matter jurisdiction to accept his guilty plea to the armed robbery indictment because the indictment did not indicate whether it had been true billed by the grand jury. We remand to the trial court for a hearing to determine whether the indictment was true billed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a few exceptions not relevant here, a circuit court does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear a guilty plea unless the defendant has been indicted by a grand jury or has waived presentment. Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362, 495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998). As a threshold matter, appellant's waiver of presentment the day after his plea did not act to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the court. See State v. Beachum, 288 S.C. 325, 342 S.E.2d 597 (1986). Furthermore, parties cannot confer subject matter jurisdiction by consent. Plante v. State, 315 S.C. 562, 446 S.E.2d 437 (1994). Subject matter jurisdiction can be raised at any time. Carter, 329 S.C. at 355, 495 S.E.2d at 777.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProceedings in a court of general jurisdiction will be presumed regular absent evidence to the contrary. Pringle v. State, 287 S.C. 409, 339 S.E.2d 127 (1986). In Pringle, we held an indictment which the grand jury foreman failed to sign was proper and the lower court had jurisdiction where there was evidence the regular indictment procedure had been followed. However, the jury foreman's signature is not essential to the validity of the indictment. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on Pringle, the Court of Appeals has held an indictment proper even though it was not stamped \"true bill,\" where there was evidence in the form of sworn testimony from the grand jury's docket coordinator, a court reporter, and a legal secretary that the indictment was in fact true billed. State v. Bultron, 318 S.C. 323, 457 S.E.2d 616 (Ct. App. 1995) cert. denied (Dec. 8, 1995). The Court of Appeals treated the failure to stamp \"true bill\" on the indictment as a scrivener's error.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn contrast, the Court of Appeals recently remanded a case for a hearing to determine whether the grand jury true billed an indictment where the indictment was signed and dated by the foreman, but there was no evidence to show the action taken by the grand jury. Anderson v. State, Op. No. 3112 (S.C. Ct. App. filed Feb. 7, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 5 at 22). Anderson is virtually identical to the present case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals' reasoning in Bultron and Anderson persuasive and remand for a hearing to determine whether the indictment at issue was true billed. When confronted with issues as presented here, a trial court has several alternatives. The court may conduct an evidentiary hearing to determine whether the indictment was true billed; or resubmit the indictment for grand jury consideration; or effect a waiver of presentment of the indictment to the grand jury and, again, entertain the defendant's plea; or simply allow withdrawal of the plea and proceed anew. The trial court record must establish subject matter jurisdiction. The procedure for publication of bills of indictment varies from county to county and no one procedure is more or less effective than another. However, caution must be exercised to ensure the presence of subject matter jurisdiction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 The indictments for the other crimes are not challenged. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25145","title":"State v.

Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE MCKELLAR: The Court of Appeals held the admission of prior bad act evidence was harmless error. State v. Brooks, 335 S.C. 140, 515 S.E.2d 764 (Ct. App. 1999). We reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn November 11, 1996, petitioner Ivadella Brooks presented a check dated the same day for seventy dollars to a cashier at a Winn Dixie grocery store to pay for some groceries and receive cash back. The cashier asked the head cashier, Hattie Mae Glover, for a check approval. The checking account was in the names of Arthur Moss, Sr., or Vernelle M. Thomas. The check was written to the order of Winn Dixie and had a \"for housekeeping\" notation on it. Glover recognized the names of Moss and Thomas and knew Moss had died eight years earlier and Thomas had died several months earlier. 1  Glover asked Brooks how she got the check and who signed it. Brooks responded that she had done some work for Moss and that he had signed the check. At some point, Brooks endorsed the back of the check. The Winn-Dixie manager called the police and Brooks was arrested for forgery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in custody, Brooks gave a statement to police. She claimed the cashier had written \"Winn Dixie\" as the payee on the check and that Blanche Thomas, whose husband had previously been married to Vernelle M. Thomas, had given the check to Brooks's mother, Frances, as repayment of a loan. Brooks stated her mother then gave the check to her to cash. At trial, Blanche Thomas denied borrowing money from Brooks or her mother and denied ever having seen the check.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State then introduced evidence that Brooks had committed a prior forgery by writing a check on a closed account on September 25, 1995. The owner of a check cashing business testified and a photograph taken of Brooks with the forged check was introduced. 2 The State claimed the prior forgery evidence was admissible as an exception to Rule 404(b), SCRE, to show absence of mistake or accident and intent in the current forgery. Brooks objected, arguing the evidence was not relevant and, even if relevant, was more prejudicial than probative. The trial court overruled the objection and held the evidence was proper because the two forgeries were \"similar in that both accounts were closed . . . and either she knew, or should have known, that the account . . . was closed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn appeal, Judge Howell found the admission of the evidence was error but harmless. Judge Goolsby concurred in result finding the admission of the evidence was not error and thus a harmless error analysis was unnecessary. Judge Connor concurred in part and dissented in part finding the admission of the evidence was error but not harmless.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the admission of the State v. Lyle 3  evidence?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the admission of the prior bad act evidence as harmless error. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Evidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however, be admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.\" Rule 404(b), SCRE; Lyle, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe record must support a logical relevance between the prior bad act and the crime for which the defendant is accused. State v. Adams, 322 S.C. 114, 470 S.E.2d 366 (1996). \"[I]f the court does not clearly perceive the connection between the extraneous criminal transaction and the crime charged, that is, its logical relevancy, the accused should be given the benefit of the doubt, and the evidence should be rejected.\" Lyle, 125 S.C. at 417, 118 S.E. at 807. Evidence of other crimes that is logically relevant to prove intent is admissible under Lyle if its probative value outweighs its undue prejudicial effect.\" State v. Simmons, 310 S.C. 439, 442, 427 S.E.2d 175, 177 (1993), rev'd on other grounds, 512 U.S. 154, 129 L. Ed.2d 133, 114 S. Ct.. 2187 (1994). Evidence is relevant when \"it tends to make more or less probable some matter in issue upon which it directly or indirectly bears.\" Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurther, even though the evidence falls within a Lyle exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant. The determination of the prejudicial effect of prior bad act evidence must be based on the entire record and the result will generally turn on the facts of each case. The erroneous admission of prior bad act evidence, however, may be deemed harmless. State v. Forney, 321 S.C. 353, 468 S.E.2d 641, 644 (1996)(citing State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991)); State v. Parker, 315 S.C. 230, 433 S.E.2d 831 (1993)(evidence of unrelated prior bad act is not reversible error where its admission was harmless beyond reasonable doubt).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not see how evidence of Brooks's prior conviction has any logical relevance to the forgery charge in this case. Brooks's defense at trial was that Thomas had given her mother the check and that she had attempted to cash it. The introduction of the facts of the prior conviction does not disprove that Thomas gave Brooks's mother the check or that Brooks forged this check or knew it was forged. The State should not have been allowed to offer this evidence to prove absence of mistake or intent. We find the State introduced the prior act to demonstrate that Brooks acted in conformity with her propensity to commit crimes which is in direct contradiction of Lyle. See also State v. Hough, 325 S.C. 88, 480 S.E.2d 77 (1997) (by introducing prior bad act evidence, state was attempting to demonstrate that because defendant had committed crimes in past, he was doing so on this occasion, precisely type of inference Lyle prohibits). Thus, the admission of the prior bad act evidence was erroneous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, we do not think the error was harmless. When the prior bad acts are similar to the one for which the appellant is being tried, the danger of prejudice is enhanced. State v. Gore, 283 S.C. 118, 121, 322 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1984). Whether the improper introduction of this evidence is harmless requires us to look at the other evidence admitted at trial to determine whether the defendant's \"guilt is conclusively proven by competent evidence, such that no other rational conclusion could be reached.\" Parker, 315 S.C. at 234, 433 S.E.2d at 833.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas testified she did not give Brooks's mother a check in repayment of a loan. However, Brooks presented witnesses who corroborated her defense that the check was given to her mother by Thomas as repayment of a loan. Brooks's mother testified Thomas gave her a check in October or November of 1996 for repayment of a loan. Albert Williams, Brooks's boyfriend, testified that in November 1996, Thomas gave Brooks's mother a check. Alphonzo Brooks, Brooks's brother, testified Thomas gave his mother a check. 4  Based upon the conflicting evidence introduced at trial, we can not say that no other rational conclusion other than Brooks's guilt could be reached. We find the jury likely used the prior bad act evidence to infer Brooks probably committed this crime. See State v. Hough, supra.

Stacey, of the South Carolina Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for petitioner.\r\n        Attorney General Charles M. Condon, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Teresa A. Knox, and Assistant Attorney General Matthew M. McGuire, all of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking .review of the dismissal of his application for post-conviction relief (PCR). We grant the petition for a writ of certiorari on petitioner's Question 1, dispense with further briefing, and affirm the PCR judge's order. Certiorari is denied as to petitioner's remaining Questions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner was indicted for \"strong arm robbery\" in violation of S.C. Code Section 16-11-325 (Supp. 1999). The text of the indictment read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Defendant . . . did in York County, on or about July 10, 1996, assist and act together with others in the felonious taking of goods and/or monies from the person or presence of Calvin Burris, Jr., by means of force or intimidation; such goods and/or monies being described as follows: Approximately Two Thousand and NO/100 ($2000.00) Dollars in US Currency and a cellular telephone, with the intent to deprive the owner permanently of such goods and/or monies, all in violation of the Common Law of South Carolina, penalty provided under Section 16-11-325, Code of Laws of South Carolina, (1976), as amended.\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the indictment fails to allege the essential elements of the common law robbery offense because the indictment does not mention asportation. Petitioner contends that because the indictment fails to allege the essential elements of the offense, the indictment is jurisdictionally deficient. Therefore, petitioner concludes, the trial court lacked the jurisdiction to try him for common law robbery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile petitioner did not raise this issue at his PCR hearing, subject matter jurisdiction issues may be raised at any time. See Wienhauer v. State, 334 S.C. 327, 513 S.E.2d 840 (1999) (issue of subject matter jurisdiction may be raised for the first time on appeal).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction if: (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; (2) there has been a waiver of indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser included charge of the crime charged in the indictment. Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 S.E.2d 773 (1998). An indictment is sufficient to convey jurisdiction if it apprises the defendant of the elements of the offense intended to be charged and informs the defendant of the circumstances he must be prepared to defend. Granger v. State, 333 S.C. 2, 507 S.E.2d 322 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHere, the indictment gave the time, place, and manner of the events in which petitioner was accused of having participated. Therefore, the indictment was sufficient to inform petitioner of the circumstances which he would be called upon to defend. Moreover, petitioner's argument notwithstanding, the indictment language alleges the substance of asportation when it reads, \"taking of goods and/or monies from the person or presence of.\" This is sufficient because asportation merely means the taking of an object with felonious intent. State v.Tindall, 213 S.C. 484, 50 S.E.2d 188 (1948) (the asportation of stolen property is ordinarily established by the slightest removal of the chattel with felonious intent).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTherefore, the trial court had subject matter jurisdiction to try petitioner for common law robbery. Accordingly, the order dismissing petitioner's PCR application is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25147","title":"In the Matter of Broadwater","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25147","description":"","date":"2000-06-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Broadwater\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Thomas D.

Richardson, Jr., of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        John P. Freeman, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and disciplinary counsel have entered into an agreement under Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413, SCACR. In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to be suspended from the practice of law for two years. We accept the agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts in the agreement are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent had a stroke in February 1997. Prior to suffering the stroke, respondent settled a case for certain clients. Respondent did not distribute the settlement funds to the clients but diverted the funds for his own use by paying his own personal medical expenses. As a result, respondent owes the insurance company as subrogee the amount of $4,494.00.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent also delayed in disbursing other client funds following his stroke. In particular, respondent delayed paying various medical providers from settlement proceeds of a client. He has now provided documentation that he has paid the providers and he represents that he has properly distributed all of the proceeds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs to his escrow account, respondent is unable to document the purpose of certain checks that he wrote on the account. He admits that he has not properly maintained his escrow account records.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn another matter, respondent admits that he charged an excessive amount for the service of subpoenas by mail. Respondent agrees to refund the $250 that he collected from the client for that service. Respondent further agrees not to seek any attorney fees from the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that he failed to obtain his client's written consent to a settlement until after he had communicated to opposing counsel and the court that the matter was settled, and until after the case had been dismissed with prejudice. He also admits that he failed to advise his client that she could obtain some benefits without the necessity of filing a lawsuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn connection with this same client, respondent sent opposing counsel a copy of a letter he had sent to his client which contained privileged information. He acknowledges that he should have written to opposing counsel without referencing the privileged material.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR. Respondent failed to diligently represent a client. Rule 1.3. Respondent failed to properly communicate with a client. Rule 1.4. Respondent violated his duty as to fees. Rule 1.5. He violated his duty regarding the safekeeping of his clients' and third parties' property. Rule 1.15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAccordingly, respondent is hereby suspended from the practice of law for two years. Respondent must establish he has provided the agreed upon restitution before applying for readmission. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25148","title":"In the Matter of Hall","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25148","description":"","date":"2000-06-12","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Matter of Hall\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n.style1 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif}\r\n.style2 {font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-weight: bold; }\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINAIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Mark E.

Condon and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, Jr., of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Respondent was indefinitely suspended from the practice of law on November 30, 1998. In the Matter of Hall, 333 S.C. 247, 509 S.E.2d 266 (1998). 1  Disciplinary Counsel filed additional formal charges against respondent on January 8, 1999. A copy of the notice and formal charges were served upon respondent at his last known law office address by both regular mail and certified mail; however, both were returned by the post office. On January 19, 1999, a copy of the notice and formal charges were served on the Clerk of this Court as agent for service for non-resident attorneys or attorneys who have disappeared. See Rule 14(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Finally, attempted service was made by Special Investigator Larry R. Huffstetler at respondent's former law office as well as two other addresses for respondent which Huffstetler discovered during his investigation; however, his attempts were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo answer or motion was received from respondent or anyone acting on his behalf. Accordingly, an Affidavit of Default was filed on February 23, 1999. A hearing was held on March 22, 1999, before a sub-panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (Commission). Respondent did not appear at the hearing. The sub-panel and, thereafter, a full panel, recommended that respondent be disbarred.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Commission forwarded the record and its recommendation to this Court. Respondent did not file a brief with the Court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nService of formal charges in any disciplinary proceeding is made by personal service upon the lawyer or the lawyer's counsel by any person authorized by the Chair of the Commission or by registered or certified mail to the lawyer's last known address. Rule 14(c), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Failure to answer formal charges or to appear when specifically ordered by the hearing panel shall constitute an admission of the factual allegations in the complaint. Rule 24(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR. Upon receipt of the record and recommendation from the panel, this Court may order oral argument, but is not required to do so, before rendering a decision. Rule 27(c)(2), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe hereby find that ordering oral argument in this case would be futile. Proper but unsuccessful attempts have been made to serve respondent at every stage of the disciplinary process; however, he has apparently absconded. The following formal charges against respondent are therefore deemed admitted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNeglect of Legal Matters\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent neglected several legal matters by failing to respond to client inquiries, failing to contact or communicate with clients, failing to diligently represent the clients' interests, and failing to complete legal work on behalf of the clients. Respondent abandoned his law practice without notice to the clients and without returning files, documents or unearned legal fees to the clients.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPracticing Law While Under Suspension\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile he was suspended for failure to pay license fees and following his indefinite suspension, respondent continued to practice law.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFailure to Respond to Disciplinary Authority\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to respond to letters or notices of full investigation sent to him by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRespondent has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (failure to provide competent representation); Rule 1.3 (failure to act with reasonable diligence in representing clients); Rule 1.4 (failure to keep clients reasonably informed about the status of their cases, failure to promptly comply with clients' reasonable requests for information, and failure to explain matters to clients to the extent reasonably necessary for them to make informed decisions regarding representation); Rule 1.15 (failure to deliver funds or other property that the client is entitled to receive); Rule 1.16 (failure upon termination of representation to protect clients' interests, surrender papers and property to which the clients are entitled and refund any advance payment of fees that has not been earned); Rule 3.2 (failure to make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interest of a client); Rule 8.1 (failure to respond to a lawful demand for information from disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4 (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition, respondent has violated provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement contained in Rule 413, SCACR, including: Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (willful failure to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on this misconduct, respondent is hereby disbarred. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISBARRED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Respondent received a public reprimand on August 21, 1995. In the Matter of Hall, 319 S.C. 358, 461 S.E.2d 396 (1995).

Code Ann. Â§ 1-3-240(B) (Supp. 1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1993, the South Carolina General Assembly adopted the Restructuring Act, which provided for a substantial reorganization of South Carolina state government. A key provision of the Restructuring Act was the grant to the Governor of broad discretionary authority to appoint and remove executive branch officials. These provisions allow the Governor the flexibility to assemble his or her management team. To this end, included in that act was section 1-3-240(B), which allows the Governor to remove any appointed state officer at his or her discretion, notwithstanding that the officer's term has not yet expired or that a substantial amount of time remains in the officer's term. When Governor Hodges was elected in 1999, he chose not to issue a broad executive order removing all state officers appointed by past governors. Instead, he requested the resignation of certain members of state boards and commissions. Governor Hodges requested that John S. Rainey (\"Rainey\") resign his position as Chairman of the Board of Directors of Santee Cooper. When Rainey refused, Governor Hodges issued Executive Order 99-62 removing Rainey from the Board. On December 8, 1999, Rainey sent a letter to Governor Hodges in which he refused to relinquish his office on the grounds that the 1993 Restructuring Act granting the Governor discretionary power to remove state officers from their positions did not apply to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sole issue before this Court is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Whether the Governor of South Carolina has the authority to remove a member of the Board of Directors of Santee Cooper upon the issuance of an executive order pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-3-240(B) (Supp. 1998)?\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Hodges argues that this Court should. declare that the members of the Board of Directors of Santee Cooper are subject to the Governor's discretionary removal power under the provisions of the 1993 Restructuring Act and, thus, the executive order removing Rainey is effective. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.  Statutory Construction\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Charleston County Sch. Dist. v. State Budget and Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993). Under the plain meaning rule, it is not the court's place to change the meaning of a clear and unambiguous statute. In re Vincent J., 333 S.C. 233, 509 S.E.2d 261 (1998) (citations omitted). Where the statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning. Id. at 233, 509 S.E.2d at 262 (citing Paschal v. State Election Comm'n, 317 S.C. 434, 454 S.E.2d 890 (1995)). \"What a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence of the legislative intent or will. Therefore, the courts are bound to give effect to the expressed intent of the legislature.\" Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§ 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe language of section 1-3-240(B) and (C) is unambiguous and evidences the General Assembly's intent to grant the Governor of South Carolina the power to remove appointed state officers at his or her discretion. Specifically, section 1-3-240(B) provides for the general power to remove as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (B)  Any person appointed to a state office by a Governor, either with or without the advice and consent of the Senate, other than those officers enumerated in subsection (C), may be removed from office by the Governor at his discretion by an Executive Order removing the officer.\r\n\r\nImmediately following is section 1-3-240(C) which provides for an enumerated list of agencies where the Governor's power of removal is limited:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (C)  Persons appointed to the following offices of the State may be removed by the Governor for malfeasance, misfeasance, incompetency, absenteeism, conflicts of interest, misconduct, persistent neglect of duty in office, or incapacity:\r\n  \r\n    (1)  Workers' Compensation Commission;\r\n    (2)  Commission of the Department of Revenue;\r\n    (3)  Ethics Commission;\r\n    (4)  Election Commission;\r\n    (5)   Professional and Occupational Licensing Board;\r\n    (6)  Juvenile Parole Board;\r\n    (7)  Probation, Parole and Pardon Board;\r\n    (8)  Director of the Department of Safety;\r\n    (9)  Board of the Department of Health and Environmental Control, excepting the Chairman;\r\n    (10)  Chief of State Law Enforcement Division.\r\n  \r\n\r\nThis Court has upheld the Restructuring Act and has applied the above set forth sections 1-3-240(B) and (C) to other directors of state boards and commissions. See, e.g., Rose v. Beasley, 327 S.C. 197, 489 S.E.2d 625 (1997) (affirming Governor Beasley's removal of Boykin Rose from the office of Director of Department of Public Safety under section 1-3-240(C)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe canon of construction \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius\" or \"inclusio unius est exclusio alterius\" holds that \"to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another, or of the alternative.\" Black's Law Dictionary 602 (7th ed. 1999). Section 1-3-240(C) does not specifically exempt the Santee Cooper Board of Directors from its operation, as it does ten other boards. The fact that the Santee Cooper Board of Directors was not included in the list of exclusions implies that the General Assembly intended for section 1-3-240(B) to apply to the Board. \"The enumeration of exclusions from the operation of a statute indicates that the statute should apply to all cases not specifically excluded. Exceptions strengthen the force of the general law and enumeration weakens it as to things not expressed.\" Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction Â§ 47.23 at 227 (5th ed. 1992) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe text of the Restructuring Act is certain -- the Act grants the Governor the right to remove appointed state officers at his or her discretion, while specifically exempting ten boards and commissions. If the legislature's intent is clearly apparent from the statutory language, a court may not embark upon a search for it outside the statute. Abell v. Bell, 229 S.C. 1, 91 S.E.2d 548 (1956). When the language of a statute is clear and explicit, a court cannot rewrite the statute and inject matters into it which are not in the legislature's language, and there is no need to resort to statutory interpretation or legislative intent to determine its meaning. Timmons v. South Carolina Tricentennial Comm'n, 254 S.C. 378, 175 S.E.2d 805 (1970).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that the purpose of an enactment will prevail over the literal import of the statute, this does not mean that this Court can completely rewrite a plain statute. According to this Court in South Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. Breeland:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A choice of language in a act will not be construed with literality when to do so will defeat the lawmakers' manifest intention, and a court will reject the ordinary meaning of words used in a statute when, to accept the ordinary meaning, will lead to a result so plainly absurd that it can not possibly have been intended by the legislature.\r\n\r\n208 S.C. 469, 480, 38 S.E.2d 644, 650 (1946) (citations omitted). For example, this Court has interpreted statutes in accord with legislative intent despite contrary literal meaning in cases where there has been an oversight by the legislature that is clearly in conflict with the overall intent of the statute, such as when the legislature uses \"or\" instead of \"and\" or \"county\" instead of \"city.\" 1 However, this Court should not completely disregard the text of an unambiguous statute based on an alleged conflict with an earlier statute. In the instant case, the ordinary meaning of section 1-3-240(B) will not .lead to absurd results unintended by the legislature, so the plain language of the statute should not be disregarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.  Implied Repeal\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRainey argues that section 1-3-240(B) is in conflict with Santee Cooper's enabling legislation that allows for the removal of board members for cause, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-31-20 (Supp. 1998). 2 According to Rainey, section 1-3-240(B) should not be read according to its literal meaning because the legislature did not intend for section 1-3-240(B) to \"impliedly repeal\" Santee Cooper's 1934 enabling legislation. Rainey maintains that because the two statutes are in inherent conflict, this Court should not apply section 1-3-240(B) to Santee Cooper, even though its Board of Directors were not specifically listed in the section 1-3-240(C) exclusions. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe law does not favor the implied repeal of statute. Butler v. Unisun Ins., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). Statutes dealing with the same subject matter must be reconciled, if possible, so as to render both operative. Id. \"It is presumed that the Legislature is familiar with prior legislation, and that if it intends to repeal existing laws it would . . . expressly do so; hence, if by any fair or liberal construction two acts may be made to harmonize, no court is justified in deciding that the later repealed the first.\" Justice v. Pantry, 330 S.C. 37, 43-44, 496 S.E.2d 871, 874 (Ct. App. 1998) (quoting State v. Hood, 181 S.C. 488, 491, 188 S.E.2d 134, 136 (1936)).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the instant case, we find that the 1934 Santee Cooper enabling legislation and the 1993 Restructuring Act are not in conflict. On the contrary, section 1-3-240(B) and (C) of the Restructuring Act can be reconciled with section 58-31-20 of the Santee Cooper legislation because both statutes provide alternative and complimentary means of removal. 3 In fact, it is very logical to have both statutes in effect because the provision in the Santee Cooper Act (section 58-31-20) acts as an important safety net. Pursuant to section 58-31-20 of the Santee Cooper Act, the advisory board can remove a board member for cause, which allows the advisory board to remove a member who is not properly performing in the event the Governor fails to do so. For example, if the Governor decides to appoint a political ally to the board who commits some type of malfeasance, section 58-31-20 acts as the ultimate safety net by permitting the advisory board to remove the Governor's appointee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1-3-240(B) of the Restructuring Act does not affect the advisory board's removal power, it merely allows the Governor to remove a director at his or her discretion. As a matter of public policy, the Governor's discretionary removal power is important because it allows the Governor to remove a director with whom he or she cannot work. Moreover, the Restructuring Act states that the Governor's removal power is not in conflict with other removal provisions because it is merely additional to any removal powers conferred by other statutes. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-3-260 (1976) (\"The power and procedure of removal conferred and provided for in Â§Â§ 1-3-240 and 1-3-250 are additional to any other removal powers or procedure authorized by statute.\") (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. State Office\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGovernor Hodges argues that section 1-3-240(B) applies to the Santee Cooper Board of Directors because Santee Cooper is a state agency and, therefore, the office of its board members is a \"state office\" for purposes of the statute. We agree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 1-3-240(B), state officers can be removed by the Governor at his discretion. Rainey argues that section 1-3-240(B) does not apply to Santee Cooper's board members because Santee Cooper's enabling legislation provides that they are not \"public officers.\" Section 58-31-60 of Santee Cooper's 1934 enabling legislation provides:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The position of director of the Public Service Authority is not a public office, and the State shall in no way be responsible for the acts of the directors, but each director and his surety and the Public Service Authority shall be responsible for all acts of the director in connection with the functions herein provided for.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-31-60 (1976) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGeneral law on this subject provides that public officers are \"all officers of the State that have heretofore been commissioned and trustees of the various colleges of the State, members of various State boards and other persons whose duties are defined by law.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 8-1-10 (1976). However, Santee Cooper's directors have many indicia of public office holders. The directors are appointed by the Governor, they are commissioned, and their duties are defined by law. Santee Cooper is also considered a state agency under current statutory law. 4 Under current law, Santee Cooper \"is a corporation owned completely by the people of the State\" for a \"public purpose\" and is operated \"for the benefit of the all the people of the State.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-31-80 (Supp: 1998). Santee Cooper also enjoys the many benefits and protections of a state agency, such as: (1) the power of eminent domain, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-31-30(18) (Supp. 1998); (2) protection under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-40 (Supp. 1998); and (3) protection under. the Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 30-4-10 (Supp. 1998). Thus, we are faced with the question of how to harmonize various sections of law with respect to the status of Santee Cooper's directors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe goal of statutory construction is to harmonize conflicting statutes whenever possible and to prevent an interpretation that would lead to a result that is plainly absurd. Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville Co., 331 S.C. 19, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  However plain the ordinary meaning of the words used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention. If possible, the court will construe the statute so as to escape the absurdity and carry the intention into effect.\r\n\r\nId. (citing Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications, Inc., 312 S.C. 725, 501 S.E.2d 725 (1994)). If one examines section 58-31-60 of Santee Cooper's enabling legislation in context it is clear that it deals specifically with director liability. Specifically, section 58-31-60 states that \"the State shall in no way be responsible for the acts of the directors, but each director and his surety and the Public Service Authority shall be responsible for all acts of the director in connection with the functions herein provided for.\" Section 58-31-60 limits the State's liability for the individual wrongs committed by directors, such as fraudulent acts. This statute is given limited effect because it was intended to apply solely to director liability prior to the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. If this Court were to give section 58-31-60 broad effect and decline to classify Santee Cooper's board members as state officers, such interpretation would lead to an absurd result where board members are classified as state officers under statutes that protect Santee Cooper as a state agency, such as the South Carolina Tort Claims Act and the Freedom of Information Act, and not classified as state officers where that classification might not be beneficial, such as in the instant case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in 1934 when Santee Cooper's enabling legislation was enacted, the State was protected by total sovereign immunity and could only be sued in tort or in contract when the State consented. The 1934 Act, therefore, offered Santee Cooper bondholders protection because it provided that although bondholders could not sue the State, they could sue both the directors and Santee Cooper on their bonds. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-31-60 (\". . . each director and his surety and the Public Service Authority shall be responsible for all acts of the director in connection with the functions herein provided for.\"). We eliminated the State's immunity from suit based upon its contractual obligation in 1978 in Kinsey Construction Co. v. South Carolina Department of Mental Health, 272 S.C. 168, 249 S.E.2d 900 (1978). In 1985, we abolished total sovereign immunity with respect to torts in McCall v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). In response to McCall, the legislature passed the Tort Claims Act, which waived sovereign immunity under certain circumstances. Under the current law, it would be illogical to find that Santee Cooper's directors were not state officers because they would not be protected by the Tort Claims Act and potentially would be personally liable on Santee Cooper's bonds, as they arguably were under the 1934 enabling legislation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRainey argues that Santee Cooper should be considered a state agency for some purposes and not for others. In South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Citizens &amp; South. Nat. Bank, 300 S.C. 142, 160, 396 S.E.2d 775, 786 (1989), this Court held \"Santee Cooper is a unique state agency . . . Santee Cooper has been held to be a quasi-municipal corporation that is for some purposes an agency of South Carolina.\" Rainey argues that for some purposes and under some statutes Santee Cooper will be considered a state agency, depending on the statute's own distinct legislative history and meaning. Rainey cannot choose which statutes will classify Santee Cooper as a state agency based upon how advantageous that classification will be to him. Because current case law and statutory law classify Santee Cooper a state agency, Santee Cooper's Board of Directors should be considered state officers for purposes of section 1-3-240(B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Contracts Clause\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRainey argues that section 1-3-240(B) would be unconstitutional in application if used to remove a Santee Cooper board member because it would violate the Contract Clause of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions 5  by impairing the contractual rights of Santee Cooper bondholders. To constitute a Contract Clause violation this Court must determine three issues: (1) whether there is a contractual relationship; (2) whether the change in the law impairs that contractual relationship; and (3) whether the impairment is substantial. See General Motors Corp. v. Romein, 503 U.S. 181, 112 S. Ct. 1105, 117 L. Ed.2d 328 (1992). Finally, \"[f]or a law to survive scrutiny under the Contract Clause when the law substantially impairs a contract, it must be reasonable and necessary to accomplish a legitimate public purpose.\" Ken Moorhead Oil Co. v. Federated Mutal Ins. Co., 323 S.C. 532, 542, 476 S.E.2d 481, 486 (1996) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA.  Contractual Relationship\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"When bonds are issued, there arises a contract between the purchaser and seller, the obligation of which cannot be impaired, as it would be in violation of article 1, Â§ 10, Const. U.S., and of article 1, Â§ 8, Const. S.C.\" Welch v. Getzen, 85 S.C. 156, 67 S.E.2d 294 (1910); see also South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth. v. Summers, 282 S.C. 148, 318 S.E.2d 113 (1984) (holding municipal tax assessment impaired rights of holders of bonds issued by Santee Cooper in violation of the United States and State Constitutions). Santee Cooper is the seller of its bonds. The contract exists between the bondholders and Santee Cooper, not its Board of Directors. Therefore, any change in the Board of Directors does not affect the underlying contract with Santee Cooper. If that were the case, every time the Board of Directors changed, a contractual impairment would occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nB. Substantial Impairment\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\"For purposes of Contract Clause analysis, a statute can be said to substantially impair a contract when it alters the reasonable expectations of the contracting parties.\" Ken Moorhead Oil, 323 S.C. at 542, 476 S.E.2d at 486. A change in the composition of Santee Cooper's Board of Directors for any reason does not alter the reasonable expectations of the bondholders. Rainey argues that the \"bondholders could reasonably expect that the rights of Santee Cooper, including the right to a stable board (which in turn translates into stable management) whose members may only be removed for cause by the Advisory Board, would not be altered or limited until after the bonds were retired.\" Rainey argues that the Governor's discretionary removal of the Chairman of Santee Cooper constitutes a threat to the stability of Santee Cooper, which may result in a lowering of the value of the bonds. According to Rainey, affecting the Board of Director's stability will have adverse effects on: (1) Santee Cooper's favorable bond ratings; (2) the bond's attractiveness to buyers; (3) the marketability of the outstanding Santee Cooper debt securities; and (4) increased credit insurance costs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe adverse effects proposed by Rainey do not rise to the level of a substantial impairment of contract. 6  A change in the composition of the Board of Directors, as a result of the Governor's will, death of a member, retirement, or removal for cause, would not lead to the vast instability that Rainey proposes. The Board of Directors would still be able to function and the outstanding bonds would still exist. Rainey has supplied no evidence that the value of the outstanding bonds would be affected by the Governor's removal of a board member. He merely provides affidavits that speculate about the possibility of a change in bond value if the bond ratings are adversely affected by a change in the Board composition. 7\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe find that the members of Santee Cooper's Board of Directors are subject to the Governor's discretionary removal power under section 1-3-240(B) of the 1993 Restructuring Act and, thus, Governor Hodges' executive order removing Rainey is effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMOORE, and WALLER, JJ., concur. FINNEY, C.J., and BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 Rainey cites several examples where this Court has interpreted statutes in accord with legislative intent, despite the literal meaning of the statute. However, in none of these examples has this Court completely disregarded the plain meaning of the statute. In all of his examples this Court changed particular words to be more in line with the overall intent of the statute. None of his examples involve this Court disregarding the whole text of a statute because a contrary legislative intent can be ascertained from reading other earlier statutes, which is what Rainey argues this Court should do in the instant case. The examples provided by Rainey include where this Court has found: \"July\" to mean \"June;\" \"attached\" to mean\"taxed;\" \"county\" to mean \"city;\" and \"hereinafter\" to mean \"hereinbefore.\" See generally Fulghum v. Bleakley, 177 S.C. 286, 181 S.E. 30, 32 (1935); Robson v. Cantwell, 143 S.C. 104, 141 S.E.2d 180 (1928).\r\n2 \"Members of the board of directors may be removed for cause by the advisory board or a majority thereof.\" S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 58-31-20 (1976). \r\n3 Even if the Restructuring Act was incompatible with Santee Cooper's enabling legislation, the Restructuring Act would prevail because it was enacted subsequent to the enabling legislation. The more recent and specific legislation controls if there is a conflict between two statutes. Porter v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Comm'n, 327 S.C. 220, 489 S.E.2d 467 (1997).\r\n4 South Carolina case law also confirms that Santee Cooper is a state agency. See Cooper v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 264 S.C. 332, 215 S.E.2d 197 (1975) (Public Service Authority is \"a public corporation in the nature of a quasi municipal corporation, exercising certain governmental functions as an agency of the state.\"); Creech v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., 200 S.C. 127, 205 S.E.2d 645 (1942), superseeded by statute on other grounds, 311 S.C. 417, 429 S.E.2d 802 (1993) (\"South Carolina Public Service Authority is a public corporation, exercising certain governmental functions as an agency of the State\"). \r\n5 Article 1, section 10 of the United States Constitution provides: \r\n\r\n  No State shall enter into any Treaty, Alliance, or Confederation; grant Letters or Marque and Reprisal; coin Money, emit Bills of Credit; make any Thing but gold and silver Coin a Tender in Payment of Debts; pass any Bill of Attainder, ex post facto law, or Law impairing the Obligation of Contracts, or grant any Title of Nobility.\r\n\r\nU.S. Const. art. I, &sect; 10, cl. 1 (emphasis added). See S.C. Const. art. I, &sect; 4.\r\n6 If the adverse effects cited by Rainey are considered an impairment, they certainly do not constitute a substantial impairment. In fact, the affidavits used by Rainey to support his claim of impairment do not describe substantial or highly detrimental effects as the result of a change in the composition of the Board of Directors. For example, in the affidavit of Walter T. Cox he states that the removal of the Chairman by the Governor is a threat to stability which \"may result\" in the bonds being less valuable if it affects the overall bond ratings. The affidavit of Alan Spen, who has rated Santee Cooper's bond offerings, merely states that the possibility that the Board could be replaced by the Governor is \"viewed as less than favorable.\" Finally, the affidavit of Christopher Fink of Morgan Stanley &amp; Company merely states that the possibility of removing the Chairman prior to the expiration of his term will lead to uncertainty which \"could have a negative impact on the marketability of the outstanding Santee Cooper debt securities.\" (emphasis added). \r\n7 Rainey attempts to compare the instant case with South Carolina Serv. Auth. v. Summers, 282 S.C. 148, 318 S.E.2d 113 (1984) where this Court held that the imposition of an ad valorem tax on Santee Cooper's property violated the Contract Clause because it violated the statutory tax exemption granted to Santee Cooper. Summers is not analogous to the instant case because it involves the imposition of a tax, which clearly impairs the security provision provided to bondholders and violates the covenant made by the State not to alter any rights of Santee Cooper. See S.C. Code Ann. &sect; 58-31-30 (1976).\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT (concurring in part, dissenting in part): I concur with Parts III and IV of the majority's opinion. I disagree, however, with Parts I and II. In my opinion, the Governor does not have discretionary authority to remove a member of the Board of Directors of Santee Cooper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelying on the statutory construction maxim \"expressio unius est exclusio alterius,\" the majority concludes because Santee Cooper was not included in the list of exclusions noted in Â§ 1-3-240(C), the General Assembly intended the Governor's discretionary removal power to apply to the Board of Santee Cooper. The majority's application of the maxim improperly effects an implied repeal of Santee Cooper's enabling legislation. 1d\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Santee Cooper was created in 1934, the General Assembly enacted specific provisions for the removal of Santee Cooper's Board members. Section 58-31-20 (1976) specifically provides: \"[m]embers of the board of directors [of Santee Cooper] may be removed for cause by the advisory board or a majority thereof.\" (Italic added). The advisory board  is composed of five members, one of whom is the governor. Â§ 58-31-20.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs recognized by the majority, the law does not favor the implied repeal of a statute. Butler v. Unisun Ins., 323 S.C. 402, 475 S.E.2d 758 (1996). Nonetheless, the majority concludes Â§ 1-3-240(B) and Â§ 58-31-20 are not in conflict; Â§ 58-31-20 simply acts as a \"safety net\" allowing the advisory board to remove the governor's appointee if he commits some type of malfeasance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I read Â§ 1-3-240(B) and Â§ 58-31-20, the two statutes are irreconcilable and cannot be reasonably harmonized. Allowing the Governor complete and sole discretion to remove a Board member without cause usurps the advisory board's authority to remove a Board member for cause. Simply put, if the advisory board, of which the Governor is a member, fails to remove a Board member for cause, the Governor can effectively veto the action and remove the member at his own discretion. Contrary to the majority's assertion, Â§ 1-3-240(B) impliedly repeals the advisory board's removal power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBecause Â§ 1-3-240(B) and Â§ 58-31-20 are clearly in conflict, the latter, as the specific act, controls, even though it was passed before Â§ 1-3-240(B). Atlas Food Systems and Services, Inc., v. Crane Nat'l Vendors, 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995); see Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory Construction  Â§ 51.05 at 174 (5th ed. 1992) (\"[w]here one statute deals with a subject in general terms, and another deals with a part of the same subject in a more detailed way, the two should be harmonized if possible; but if there is any conflict, the latter will prevail, regardless of whether it was passed prior to the general statute, . . .\").\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature. Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 476 S.E.2d 690 (1996). When it passed the Restructuring Act, the General Assembly amended the removal provisions of administrative agencies, specifically stating removal is subject to Â§ 1-3-240(B). See Â§ 24-1-40 (Supp. 1999) (director of Department of Corrections is subject to removal from office as provided in Â§ 1-3-240); Â§ 44-9-30 (Supp. 1999) (governing board of State Department of Mental Health may be removed by Governor pursuant to Â§ 1-3-240); Â§ 44-49-20 (Supp. 1999) (director of Department of Alcohol and Other Drug Abuse Services is subject to removal by Governor pursuant to Â§ 1-3-240); Â§ 48-4-30 (Supp. 1999) (Governor may remove any board member of the Department of Natural Resources pursuant to Â§ 1-3-240); Â§ 51-1-10 (Supp. 1999) (director of Parks, Recreation and Tourism is subject to removal by the Governor pursuant to Â§ 1-3-240). The legislature's failure to amend Â§ 58-31-20 indicates a conscious decision by the General Assembly to exclude the Santee Cooper Board from the Governor's removal power in Â§ 1-3-240(B).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, Â§ 1-3-240 does not authorize the Governor to remove a member of the Santee Cooper Board at his sole discretion. Accordingly, I would vacate Executive Order 99-62 which removes Rainey from the Board. Rose v. Beasley, 327 S.C. 197, 489 S.E.2d 625 (1997) (under South Carolina law, the Governor may not remove from office unless the power to do so is conferred upon him by the Constitution or statute).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFINNEY, C.J., concurs.\r\n1dExpressio unius est exclusio alterius is a rule of statutory construction; it is not a rule of substantive law. Accordingly, the maxim \"should be used with care.\" Norman J.

Â§14-3-330(2) (1976), and therefore reverse and remand for trial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is an order granting bifurcation of issues in a contract case immediately appealable? 2 Is an order bifurcating discovery immediately appealable?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioners (\"Flagstar\") operate restaurants throughout the United States. Two class actions were filed against Flagstar in United States District Courts, in addition to which numerous individual claims alleging discriminatory treatment of African-American patrons were filed. Those claims were settled, and Flagstar brought this declaratory judgment action alleging that an insurance policy issued by respondents (\"Royal\") provides coverage for the discrimination claims. This policy includes a provision which purports to exclude \"bodily injury\" or \"personal injury\" that \"arises on the basis of race . . . color . . . [or] national origin.\" (Exclusion \"C\") The policy nonetheless defines \"personal injury\" as injury \"arising out of . . . discrimination.\" The insuring agreement further provides that the insurer covers obligations which the insured may become legally obligated to pay as a result of damages arising from \"personal injury\" stemming from an \"occurrence.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyal moved for judgment on the pleadings pursuant to Rule 12(c), SCRCP, asserting that coverage for race-based injury claims was barred under Exclusion C. After that motion was denied, Flagstar moved for bifurcation of the trial into two distinct phases, pursuant to Rule 42(b), SCRCP. This rule provides for separate trials of any \"separate issue\" as long as the right to trial by jury 3  is preserved inviolate. Flagstar proposed that a jury would first determine whether Exclusion C operated to preclude coverage. If so, the litigation would end adversely to Flagstar. If not, trial would proceed on to the issues of whether the acts constituted \"occurrences\" or \"personal injury\" under the policy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trial judge, over the objection of Royal, 4 granted the motion for bifurcation. In addition to bifurcating the issues for trial, the order bifurcated discovery. The trial judge noted that Royal had, in its Rule 12(c), SCRCP motion, demonstrated \". . . some recognition on its part that Exclusion C and its application in this case are [sic] a critical, threshold issue in this case.\" The Court of Appeals initially dismissed the appeal on the order of a single judge, but a full panel thereafter determined that the order was immediately appealable, and reversed the trial court on the merits of the Rule 42(b) bifurcation. In reversing the trial court, the Court of Appeals held:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Given the complexities of the insurance coverage issues in this case, we hold that the trial court erred in granting the motion for separate trials. Rule 42(b) SCRCP, contains a distinct issue requirement. Clearly this case presents overlapping issues and ambiguity in the contract terms. Because this court has concluded there are overlapping issues that entitle Royal to one trial on both coverage and exclusion we also conclude that under Fortune, 5  Royal was entitled to a single trial under Rule 42(b). Therefore, denial of a single trial amounts to denial of a mode of trial and is appealable.\r\n  We granted certiorari, and now reverse.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyal successfully argued in the Court of Appeals that the order granting bifurcation was immediately appealable. The Court of Appeals then held that the trial court had erroneously granted bifurcation in that the complexity of the issues involved in this insurance contract litigation 6  were overlapping, and could not meet the \"separate issue\" requirement of Rule 42(b). Because the Court of Appeals erred in deciding the threshold question of appealability, we do not reach the issue of whether or not the trial court's order granting bifurcation was correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRoyal argues that the order granting bifurcation of the issues and discovery was immediately appealable because that grant triggered the operation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§14-3-330(2)(1976), the pertinent portion of which is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review on appeal:\r\n  \r\n    (2) an order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, . . . or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nRoyal reasons that since it requested a jury trial, and since bifurcation of the issues deprived it of that mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right, the order granting bifurcation was immediately appealable. The Court of Appeals agreed with Royal's thesis that the issues in this case were not capable of separate consideration by a fact finder or fact finders, and thus the order was immediately appealable. We disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(2), this Court has held on numerous occasions that when a trial court's order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right, such order is immediately appealable. Lester v. Dawson 327 S.C. 263, 491 S.E.2d 240 (1997); C&amp;S Real Estate Services. Inc., v. Massengale 290 S.C. 299, 350 S.E.2d 191 (1986); Creed v. Stokes 285 S.C. 542, 331 S.E.2d 351 (1985); First Union National Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 511 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1998); Preferred Sav. Bank, Inc. v. Elkholy 303 S.C. 495, 399 S.E.2d 195 (Ct. App. 1990). These cases not only permit, but indeed require, immediate appeal in the event of denial of a mode of trial to which one is entitled as a matter of right. Failure to immediately appeal such an order forever bars appellate review. See, e.g., Creed v. Stokes, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAn order granting bifurcation of issues for trial simply does not strike to the heart of this Court's traditional analysis of claims of denial of a mode of trial. That analysis proceeds by determining whether or not a party is erroneously denied a trial by jury in a law case, or is erroneously required to proceed before a jury in an equity case. 7 In this case, no party is denied the right to a trial by jury. Moreover, after trial, Royal will be free to advance on appeal that the trial judge abused his discretion in ordering bifurcation and that it has thereby been effectively deprived of a fair and/or fully informed fact finder. An abuse of discretion, if any, by the trial court in its ruling can be corrected at that time. 8  See Breland v. Love Chevrolet, Op. No. 25080 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 6, 2000) (immediate appeals under Â§ 14-3-330(2) are permitted only where the alleged error cannot be corrected by a new trial). To hold otherwise would require this Court to, inter alia, predetermine the admissibility of evidence in advance of trial, 9 to pass upon matters of pretrial discovery and to engage in \"piecemeal litigation.\" Breland v. Love Chevrolet, supra.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn short, trial of all issues in the case in a single proceeding is not a mode of trial to which the parties are entitled as a matter of right. Any abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court in severing issues for trial may be appealed after the trial, and after full development of the evidence. We therefore hold that an order granting separate trials of issues in a contract case is not immediately appealable, either permissibly or mandatorily, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976). This ruling also disposes of the second issue of whether the portion of the order bifurcating discovery is immediately appealable. See also Patterson v. Spector Broadcasting Corp., 287 S.C. 249, 335 S.E.2d 803 (1985) (discovery orders are not directly appealable).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing discussion, the opinion of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER; JJ., and Acting Justice Ernest A. Finney, Jr., concur.\r\n1 332 S.C. 182, 503 S.E.2d 497 (Ct. App. 1998). \r\n2 This case was consolidated for argument with Senter v. Pig ly Wiggly Co., Inc., Op. No. 25151 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 12, 2000), which addresses the appealability of a trial court order denying bifurcation of the issues of liability and damages in a tort case.\r\n3 S.C. Const. art. 1, &sect;14. \r\n4 Royal argued that whether or not exclusion(s) applied could not be determined until it was determined whether or not covered events had occurred. Royal further asserted that the issues in the case were so inextricably intertwined that the issues could not be tried separately.\r\n5 Fortune v. Gibson, 304 S.C. 279, 403 S.E.2d 674 (Ct. App. 1991). \r\n6 The litigation was declared complex pursuant to agreement of the parties.\r\n7Flagstar has argued that the Court of Appeals \"placed the cart before the horse\" in first determining the inappropriateness of the bifurcation order, and thereafter bootstrapping the issue of appealability. While we agree that the analysis was incorrect in that the threshold question of appealability was erroneously decided, we nonetheless point out that some minimal inquiry will always be necessary on the part of an appellate court considering the appealability of an order which is alleged to have deprived a party of a modeof trial.\r\n8 Our ruling should not be interpreted by the trial bench as in any way lessening the level of responsibility of the trial judge to determine appropriate severability in deciding a Rule 42(b) motion. In exercising their discretion, trial judges should take care to analyze whether or not the issues are overlapping or not distinct, in determining whether or not the \"separate issue\" mandate of Rule 42(b) is met.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n9 See Senter, supra, fn. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25151","title":"Senter v.

A., of Beaufort, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted certiorari to review an order of the Court of Appeals 1  which denied immediate appellate review of the trial court's denial of a motion to bifurcate trial of the issues of liability and damages. 2 We affirm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Is an order denying bifurcation of the issues of liability and damages in a personal injury case immediately appealable?\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe respondent filed this action alleging personal injury suffered when she slipped on a pooling of water on petitioner's premises. Prior to trial, petitioner filed a motion pursuant to Rule 42(b), SCRCP, to bifurcate the issues of liability and damages. The reasons advanced for seeking bifurcation were that the injuries claimed were extensive, that the evidence supporting respondent's claim consisted of unduly prejudicial photographs, and that detailed descriptions of medical treatment and graphic accounts of pain and suffering would be introduced. The trial court denied the motion and petitioner sought immediate appellate review. The Court of Appeals dismissed, finding that the trial court's order was not entitled to immediate appellate review.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the admission of the graphic evidence would result in prejudice to petitioner, in that a jury could not help but find liability based upon the extent of the injuries and damage; the detailed accounts supporting the same; and the graphic nature of the photographs. The petitioner thus posits that since it is absolutely entitled to a fair and impartial fact finder, requiring it to go to trial on the issues of damages and liability in a single proceeding would deprive it of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right, i.e., trial by a fair and impartial jury. Bifurcation, petitioner further contends, is the only mode of trial available to protect its right to a fair and impartial fact finder under the circumstances of this case. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA motion seeking bifurcation of the issues of liability and damages in a personal injury case is addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court pursuant to Rule 42(b), SCRCP, which states in pertinent part as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  (b)  Separate Trials. The court, in furtherance of convenience or to avoid prejudice, or when separate trials will be conducive to expedition and economy, may order a separate trial of any claim, . . . or of any separate issue. . . always preserving inviolate the right of trial by jury as declared by the Constitution or as given by a statute of the State. (Emphasis supplied)\r\n\r\nThe trial court's order in this case was discretionary, and an abuse of discretion, if any, which deprives petitioner of a fair trial can be corrected on appeal following trial on all issues. See Creighton v. Coligny Plaza Ltd. Partnership, 334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510 (Ct. App. 1998)(the question of bifurcation is a matter for the trial court's discretion). To hold otherwise would, inter alia, require this court to predetermine the admissibility of the evidence in advance of the trial. This, of course, we decline to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the order denying bifurcation in this case should be immediately appealable because the denial triggered the operation of S. C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976), the pertinent portion of which for purposes of petitioner's argument is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The Supreme Court shall have appellate jurisdiction for correction of errors of law in law cases, and shall review on appeal:\r\n  \r\n    (2)  An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, . . . or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action;\r\n  \r\n\r\nWe disagree. The code provision relied upon as controlling by the petitioner has been interpreted as not merely allowing, but rather as requiring immediate appeal when the trial court's order deprives a party of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right. Creed v. Stokes, 285 S.C. 542, 331 S.E.2d 351 (1985). The majority of cases requiring immediate appeal involve review of denials of trial by jury and are based on the public policy consideration of advancing the constitutional mandate to preserve the right to trial by jury inviolate. 4  Lester v. Dawson, 327 S.C. 263, 491 S.E.2d 240 (1997); C &amp; S Real Estate Services, Inc. v. Massengale, 290 S.C. 299, 350 S.E.2d 191 (1986); First Union National Bank of South Carolina v. Soden, 333 S.C. 554, 511 S.E.2d 372 (Ct. App. 1998); Preferred Sav. Bank, Inc., v. Elkholy, 303 S.C. 95, 399 S.E.2d 195 (Ct. App. 1990). We decline petitioner's invitation to  extend our interpretation of this statute so as to permit or to require immediate appeal of orders denying bifurcation of the issues of liability and damages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a  matter decided pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330 (2), this Court recently held that a trial court's order denying a change of venue \"did not 'affect' the defendant's right to venue in the county of its residence because any error in the order can be corrected on appeal following the trial.\" See Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds. Inc., Op. No. 25080 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 6, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 9 at 30) (citing Knowles v. Standard Sav. &amp; Loan Ass'n, 274 S.C. 58, 261 S.E.2d 49 (1979)). Such is the case here. This procedure will advance the salutary consideration of avoiding \"piecemeal litigation\" which would occur if immediate review of such pretrial motions were either mandated or permitted. Id.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPetitioner argues that the recent Court of Appeals decision in Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, 332 S.C. 182, 503 S.E.2d 497 (Ct. App. 1999), in which the court held that a trial court's order granting bifurcation of issues in a contract case was immediately appealable, constitutes an implicit holding that a Rule 42(b) order is immediately appealable if it deprives a party of a mode of trial to which it is entitled as a matter of right. Flagstar, which was consolidated with this case for argument, affords no comfort to the petitioner in that we have this date reversed the Court of Appeals' holding in that case. Flagstar Corp. v. Royal Surplus Lines, Op. No. 25150 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 12, 2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe therefore hold that an order denying bifurcation of the issues of liability and damages in a personal injury case is not immediately appealable, either permissibly or mandatorily, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2) (1976).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBased on the foregoing discussion, the order of the Court of Appeals is\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1A single judge of the Court of Appeals dismissed petitioner's appeal from the lower court which action was sustained by order of a full panel of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2The respondent contends that the Court of Appeals was without jurisdiction to entertain substantial portions of the petitioner's argument owing to the fact that such arguments were based upon factual development which occurred after the filing of the notice of appeal. Since consideration of the purportedly improper argument is unnecessary to our determination of this appeal we do not reach any jurisdictional issue.\r\n3Petitioner contends that the Court of Appeals' order erroneously focuses on the respondent's right to a jury trial, adopting as it does a \"single proceeding\" approach for personal injury trials which the Court of Appeals denominates as the \"standard mode of trial.\" Petitioner argues that such an analysis ignores the petitioner's absolute right to a fair and impartial fact finder.\r\n\r\n4 S.C.

In 1995, Vinovich was\r\r\n\r\r\ninvolved in litigation with appellant Department of Revenue (DOR). On\r\r\n\r\r\nAugust 17, 1995, an ALJ ordered the revocation of all of Vinovich's video\r\r\n\r\r\npoker machine licenses in units 9 and 10. Vinovich appealed the decision to\r\r\n\r\r\nthe circuit court. Circuit Court Judge Maring issued a temporary stay of the\r\r\n\r\r\norder of revocation. After a full hearing, on May 2, 1996, Judge Maring\r\r\n\r\r\naffirmed the ALJ and dissolved the temporary stay order. Judge Maring,\r\r\n\r\r\nhowever, did not immediately file the order.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nRespondent Gateway Enterprises, Inc., is also in the video gaming\r\r\n\r\r\nindustry. On May 10, 1996, Gateway leased units 3, 4, 9, and 10 at 1087\r\r\n\r\r\nDecker Boulevard. On May 14, 1996, respondent obtained licenses for the\r\r\n\r\r\nvideo poker machines in units 3, 4, 9, and 10.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn May 15, 1996, at 9:18 a.m., Judge Maring filed his order affirming\r\r\n\r\r\nthe ALJ and dissolving the temporary stay. At 2:00 p.m., DOR discovered a\r\r\n\r\r\nvideo poker machine operating in unit 4 with one of Vinovich's licenses\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich was subject to the revocation order. DOR seized the license and cited\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway for operating an unlicensed machine. On May 17 th, DOR returned\r\r\n\r\r\nand found video poker machines operating in units 9 and 10. Gateway was\r\r\n\r\r\ncited for violating S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2804(A)(Supp. 1998). Section 12\r\r\n\r\r\n21-2804(A) prohibits the operation of video machines at a location where\r\r\n\r\r\nlicenses have previously been revoked. DOR sought the revocation of all of\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway's licenses and the imposition of penalties. The ALJ ordered the\r\r\n\r\r\nrevocation of all licenses being used in units 9 and 10 and imposed fines.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecial Circuit Court Judge J. Stanton Cross, Jr., reversed.

The May 15th order\r\r\n\r\r\ndissolving the stay of the ALJ order is not a \"judgment\" subject to the\r\r\n\r\r\nautomatic 10-day stay under Rule 62(a). See Rule 54(a), SCRCP.\r\r\n\r\r\n(\" 'Judgment' as used in these rules includes any decree or order which\r\r\n\r\r\ndismisses the action as to any party or finally determines the rights of any\r\r\n\r\r\nparty.\").\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1 The ALJ Division has established its own Rules of Procedure as\r\r\n\r\r\nauthorized by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-650 (Supp. 1999). See Al-Shabazz v.\r\r\n\r\r\nState, Op. No. 24995 (S.C. Sup. Ct. re-filed February 14, 2000)(Shearouse\r\r\n\r\r\nAdv. Sh. No. 6 at 37). Rule 34, ALJD, provides: \"The filing of an appeal from\r\r\n\r\r\nthe final decision of an agency shall stay the final decision of that agency\r\r\n\r\r\nunless the effect of filing an appeal is otherwise established by statute, the\r\r\n\r\r\nAdministrative Procedures Act notwithstanding; or the administrative law\r\r\n\r\r\njudge has entered an order regarding the effect of the proceedings in the\r\r\n\r\r\nagency.\" (emphasis added). Rule 29(D), ALJD, provides: \"An administrative\r\r\n\r\r\nlaw judge who issues a final order subject to judicial review may in the order\r\r\n\r\r\nstay its effect.\" Finally, Rule 52, ALJD, provides: \"The South Carolina Rules\r\r\n\r\r\nof Civil Procedure may, where practicable, be applied in proceedings before\r\r\n\r\r\nthe [Administrative Law Judge] Division to resolve questions not addressed\r\r\n\r\r\nby these rules.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHere, pursuant to Rule 34, the appeal of DOR's final decision to the\r\r\n\r\r\nALJ was automatically stayed. The ALJ then issued his final order.\r\r\n\r\r\nPursuant to Rule 29, there was not an automatic stay of the ALJ's order.\r\r\n\r\r\nJudge Maring, however, issued a stay pursuant to Rule 62, SCRCP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.270\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway Enterprises, Inc., v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJudge Maring filed his order affirming the ALJ's order and dissolving\r\r\n\r\r\nhis order staying the ALJ's order on May 15, 1996. Since there is not an\r\r\n\r\r\nautomatic 10-day stay, once Judge Maring dissolved the stay he had\r\r\n\r\r\npreviously granted, DOR was entitled to immediately enforce the ALJ's order\r\r\n\r\r\nrevoking the licenses.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2) Revocation of Licenses\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDOR contends the circuit court erred in holding licenses could not be\r\r\n\r\r\nrevoked because a licensee could not violate Â§ 12-21-2804(A). 2  We agree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe pertinent portion of Â§ 12-21-2804(A)(emphasis added) provides:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"[DOR] shall revoke the licenses of an establishment which fails to meet the\r\r\n\r\r\nrequirements of this section. No license may be issued for a machine in an\r\r\n\r\r\nestablishment in which a license has been revoked for a period of six months\r\r\n\r\r\nfrom the date of revocation.\" The circuit court held that Gateway could not\r\r\n\r\r\nviolate this section as it refers to only DOR's actions in refusing to issue a\r\r\n\r\r\nlicense. In other words, the circuit court held the statute is a directive only to\r\r\n\r\r\nDOR not to issue licenses for certain machines. We disagree. Under this\r\r\n\r\r\nsection, DOR clearly has the authority to refuse to issue any licenses to\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway for the six month period and to revoke Gateway's licenses because\r\r\n\r\r\nit failed to meet the requirements of this section. Accordingly, the circuit\r\r\n\r\r\ncourt erred in reversing the ALJ. 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe circuit court's order is\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2 We note the ALJ erred in ruling on the constitutionality of the\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute. See Al-Shabazz v. State, Op. No. 24955 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed February\r\r\n\r\r\n14, 2000)(Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 6 at 21)(ALJs must leave question of\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute's constitutionality to the courts).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3 DOR contends the circuit court erred in holding 2 12-21-2804(A) is a\r\r\n\r\r\npenal statute and should be strictly construed against DOR. We agree.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe do not find the statute ambiguous and therefore we do not need to apply\r\r\n\r\r\nany rules of statutory construction, including the one which requires penal\r\r\n\r\r\nstatutes to be strictly construed against the State. Thus, we do not need to\r\r\n\r\r\ndecide if the statute is, in fact, penal.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.271\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway Enterprises, Inc., v. S.C.

Gregory, Jr., Concur\r\r\n\r\r\nBURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.272\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nGateway Enterprises, Inc., v. S.C. Dep't of Revenue\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT: I concur in the majority's analysis of Â§ 12-21-\r\r\n\r\r\n2804(A). However, I disagree with the majority's conclusion Rule 62(a) does\r\r\n\r\r\nnot apply to Judge Maring's May 15, 1996 order.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nRule 62(a), SCRCP, provides for an automatic stay of ten days after the\r\r\n\r\r\nentry of a final judgment. The purpose of the stay is to give the losing party\r\r\n\r\r\na chance to comply with the order or file a notice of appeal and seek a stay\r\r\n\r\r\npending appeal.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe majority holds \"The May 15th order dissolving the stay of the ALJ\r\r\n\r\r\norder is not a `judgment' subject to the automatic 10-day stay under Rule\r\r\n\r\r\n62(a).\" I agree the language dissolving the stay is not an appealable\r\r\n\r\r\n\"judgment.\" However, the order does not merely dissolve the stay, but\r\r\n\r\r\naffirms the ALJ's decision revoking Vinovich's video poker licenses.\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Judgment\" under Rule 54 is defined as \"any decree or order which dismisses\r\r\n\r\r\nthe action as to any party or finally determines the rights of any party.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nRule 54(a), SCRCP. The May 15th order is a judgment because it finally\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermined the rights of the parties. See First Union National Bank of\r\r\n\r\r\nSouth Carolina v. Hitman. Inc., 306 S.C. 327, 330, 411 S.E.2d 681, 683 (Ct.\r\r\n\r\r\nApp.1991), aff'd, 308 S.C. 421, 418 S.E.2d 545 (1992).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDOR contends it was the ALJ's order, not the circuit court's, it was\r\r\n\r\r\nenforcing, and the ALJ's order became enforceable the moment the stay was\r\r\n\r\r\nlifted. While not specifically adopting this argument, the majority\r\r\n\r\r\nnevertheless reaches the same result. In my opinion, DOR's argument is\r\r\n\r\r\nunpersuasive. The argument confuses the discretionary stay pending appeal\r\r\n\r\r\nfrom an administrative order under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(2) with the\r\r\n\r\r\nautomatic 10-day stay under Rule 62(a). Once the matter was appealed,\r\r\n\r\r\njurisdiction transferred to the circuit court and its order was the final order\r\r\n\r\r\nof the case. The discretionary stay Judge Maring issued during the\r\r\n\r\r\npendency of the appeal in no way affects the automatic 10-day stay of his\r\r\n\r\r\nfinal judgment under Rule 62(a).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI would hold Judge Maring's May 15, 1996 order was a final judgment\r\r\n\r\r\nunder Rule 54, subject to Rule 62(a)'s ten-day stay.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.273\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25154","title":"State v.

We affirm.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.284\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Dickman\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTS\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn October 19,1997, a badly decomposed body was found in a wooded\r\r\n\r\r\narea of Beaufort County. The body was later identified as Richard\r\r\n\r\r\nMandeville (Victim) who lived with appellant and John Seals. Victim had\r\r\n\r\r\nbeen shot in the back of the head. When questioned by police, appellant and\r\r\n\r\r\nSeals both said Victim had gone to California. Eventually, however, Seals\r\r\n\r\r\ntold police that appellant had shot Victim.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSeals testified at trial that appellant shot Victim while the three of\r\r\n\r\r\nthem were in appellant's car. Seals was driving, Victim was in the passenger\r\r\n\r\r\nseat, and appellant was in the backseat behind Victim. After shooting\r\r\n\r\r\nVictim, appellant directed Seals to drive to a remote area where they\r\r\n\r\r\nremoved the body from the car and dragged it into the woods. Seals emptied\r\r\n\r\r\nVictim's pockets and threw Victim's wallet into the river on the way home.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe next day, appellant cleaned the blood from the inside of the car. 1\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAppellant gave a statement to police. After initially indicating Seals\r\r\n\r\r\nwas the shooter, appellant told police he had shot Victim. At trial, appellant\r\r\n\r\r\nrecanted this statement and testified that Seals was the shooter.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nISSUE\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDoes the evidence support an accomplice liability charge?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDISCUSSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOver appellant's objection, the trial judge charged the jury that\r\r\n\r\r\nappellant could be found guilty under a theory of accomplice liability based\r\r\n\r\r\non \"the hand of one is the hand of all.\" See State v. Crowe, 258 S.C. 258, 188\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 379 (1972) (if two or more combine together to commit an unlawful\r\r\n\r\r\nact and a homicide is committed by one of the actors as a probable or natural\r\r\n\r\r\nconsequence of the acts done in pursuance of the common design, all present\r\r\n\r\r\nparticipating in the unlawful undertaking are as guilty as the one who\r\r\n\r\r\ncommitted the fatal act). Appellant contends this was error.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1 Seals was charged with misprison (or misprision) of a felony for his\r\r\n\r\r\ninvolvement in these events.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np. 285\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Dickman\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAt trial, appellant objected to a charge on accomplice liability because\r\r\n\r\r\nthe indictment charged him only as a principal. It is well-settled that a\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant may be convicted on a theory of accomplice liability pursuant to an\r\r\n\r\r\nindictment charging him only with the principal offense. State v. Leonard,\r\r\n\r\r\n292 S.C.-133, 136, 355 S.E.2d 270 (1987); State v. Cox, 258 S.C. 114, 187\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 525 (1972); State v. Hicks, 257 S.C. 279, 185 S.E.2d 746 (1971); State\r\r\n\r\r\nv. Hunter, 79 S.C. 73, 60 S.E. 240 (1908). Accordingly, this argument is\r\r\n\r\r\nwithout merit. 2\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn appeal, appellant argues the evidence does not support an\r\r\n\r\r\naccomplice liability charge. This argument is procedurally barred since it\r\r\n\r\r\nwas not raised below. State v. Tucker, 319 S.C. 425, 462 S.E.2d 263 (1995);\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 377 S.E.2d 581 (1989) (a party cannot argue one\r\r\n\r\r\nground below and then argue another ground on appeal).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn any event, on the merits, we find the evidence supports the charge.\r\r\n\r\r\nSee State v. Burriss, 334 S.C. 256, 513 S.E.2d 104 (1999) (law to be charged\r\r\n\r\r\nis determined from the evidence presented at trial and if any evidence exists\r\r\n\r\r\nto support a charge, it should be given). The critical question is whether\r\r\n\r\r\nthere is any evidence appellant and Seals were acting together at the time of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe killing if Seals was the shooter as appellant claimed. Although on cross\r\r\n\r\r\nexamination appellant denied he and Seals planned to kill Victim that day,\r\r\n\r\r\nhis testimony on direct does provide some evidence of such a plan.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAppellant testified Seals asked him to kill Victim because Victim was\r\r\n\r\r\nalways behind on the rent. Appellant told another friend the murder would\r\r\n\r\r\nbe on a Sunday and the murder did in fact occur on a Sunday. On the day of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe murder, Seals tried to collect the rent from Victim without success.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhen he subsequently saw appellant, Seals's first words to appellant were\r\r\n\r\r\n\"do it.\" Appellant testified, \"I knew what he intended at that time.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nImmediate thereafter, Seals called Victim on the telephone and arranged\r\r\n\r\r\nto pick him up for the fatal car ride.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2 At oral argument, appellant relied on our recent opinion in State v.\r\r\n\r\r\nMartin, Op. No. 25093 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed March 27, 2000), as precedent to\r\r\n\r\r\nthe contrary. Martin, however, was withdrawn and refiled June 12, 2000.\r\r\n\r\r\nIn its revised version, Martin does not address this issue.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.286\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Dickman\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile they were driving, appellant found the gun wrapped in a towel\r\r\n\r\r\nunder the front seat where Seals had put it. He picked up the gun and held\r\r\n\r\r\nit up for Seals to see in the rear view mirror. Appellant's nerve failed him\r\r\n\r\r\nand he did not shoot. When Victim briefly left the car, appellant apologized\r\r\n\r\r\nfor not shooting and gave Seals the gun. The two had no further\r\r\n\r\r\ncommunication between them before Seals allegedly shot Victim.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe find this testimony provides some evidence appellant and Seals\r\r\n\r\r\nwere acting pursuant to a plan to kill Victim at the time of the murder.\r\r\n\r\r\nAccordingly, the charge on accomplice liability was properly submitted to the\r\r\n\r\r\njury.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAppellant's remaining issue is without merit and we dispose of it under\r\r\n\r\r\nRule 220(b), SCACR.

Act No. 125 which, among other things, makes\r\r\n\r\r\npossession of these machines illegal as of July 1, 2000. Plaintiffs seek an\r\r\n\r\r\ninjunction against enforcement of the Act claiming it effects an\r\r\n\r\r\nunconstitutional taking of their property without just compensation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBecause of the great public interest in finally determining this matter,\r\r\n\r\r\nwe accepted the case in our original jurisdiction and ordered expedited\r\r\n\r\r\nbriefing. Having considered the extensive briefs of the parties, we hold\r\r\n\r\r\ncompensation is not constitutionally required under either our Federal or\r\r\n\r\r\nState Constitutions. Accordingly, we deny the injunction.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBACKGROUND\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFor nearly seventy years, gaming machines have been illegal in this\r\r\n\r\r\nState and subject to forfeiture as contraband. In 1931, the General\r\r\n\r\r\nAssembly enacted a comprehensive statute outlawing the possession of all\r\r\n\r\r\nforms of gambling devices, including vending machines that could be\r\r\n\r\r\noperated as gambling devices. 1931 S.C. Act No. 368. 1\r\r\n  In 1982, however, the\r\r\n\r\r\nGeneral Assembly enacted an exemption for \"video games with free play\r\r\n\r\r\nfeature\" which were a relatively recent technological development. 1982 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1\r\r\n Codified as 1932 Code of Laws Â§ 1301-A.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np. 319\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWestside Quik Shop, Inc., et al. v. Stewart and Condon\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAct No. 466. 2\r\r\n  In State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991), we\r\r\n\r\r\nheld nonmachine cash payouts from these video gaming machines were legal\r\r\n\r\r\nunder a pre-existing statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-19-60 (Supp: 1999). 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the ensuing years, our State witnessed the dramatic growth of video\r\r\n\r\r\ngaming into a multi-billion dollar industry that became the subject of much\r\r\n\r\r\npublic debate. Despite the repeated introduction of legislation aimed at\r\r\n\r\r\nrepealing the exemption for video gaming machines,  4\r\r\n  no legislation was\r\r\n\r\r\npassed until 1993. In July of that year, the General Assembly provided for\r\r\n\r\r\nlocal option referenda to be held on a county by county basis to determine\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether nonmachine cash payouts for video gaming should become illegal.\r\r\n\r\r\n1993 S.C. Act No. 164, Pt. II, Â§ 19H. In November 1994, twelve counties\r\r\n\r\r\nvoted in favor of making such payouts illegal. The local option referenda,\r\r\n\r\r\nhowever, were ultimately struck down by this Court in 1996 as\r\r\n\r\r\nunconstitutional special legislation. Martin v. Condon, 324 S.C. 183, 478\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 272 (1996). Cash payouts once again became legal throughout the\r\r\n\r\r\nState.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn November 1998, this Court upheld, the statutory scheme regulating\r\r\n\r\r\nvideo gaming machines against a challenge that this type of gaming device\r\r\n\r\r\nconstituted an unconstitutional lottery. Johnson v. Collins Entertainment\r\r\n\r\r\nCo., 333 S.C. 96, 508 S.E.2d 575 (1998).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFinally, in an extra session called by the Governor in June 1999, the\r\r\n\r\r\nGeneral Assembly enacted 1999 S.C. Act No. 125 providing for a November\r\r\n\r\r\nreferendum to be held statewide to decide the fate of video gaming. Voters\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2\r\r\n Codified as S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 52-15-10 and subsequently recodified as\r\r\n\r\r\nÂ§ 12-21-2710. In 1997, this section was amended to limit the exemption for\r\r\n\r\r\nvideo games to those \"which meet the technical requirements provided for in\r\r\n\r\r\nSection 12-21-2782 and Section 12-21-2783.\" 1997 S.C. Act No. 155, Pt. II,\r\r\n\r\r\nÂ§ 54(B).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3\r\r\n Repealed effective July 1, 2000, by 1999 S.C. Act No. 125, Pt. I, Â§ 8.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n4\r\r\n See, e.g, H.R. 3823, 108th Leg., 2d Sess. (1989) (bill to repeal Â§\r\r\n\r\r\n16-19-60); H.R. 3867, 108th Leg., 2d Sess. (1989) (bill to make it unlawful to\r\r\n\r\r\nhave or to operate a machine for playing games which utilizes a deck of\r\r\n\r\r\ncards); H.R. 3104, 109th Leg., 1st Sess. (1991) (bill to repeal Â§ 16-19-60).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.320\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWestside Quik Shop, Inc., et al. v. Stewart and Condon\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nwould be asked whether cash payouts for video gaming machines should\r\r\n\r\r\ncontinue to be allowed after June 30, 2000. If voters answered \"no,\" Part I of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Act would become effective July 1, 2000. This part of the Act repeals\r\r\n\r\r\nÂ§ 16-19-60, which allows nonmachine cash payouts, and amends S.C. Code\r\r\n\r\r\nAnn. Â§ 12-21-2710 (2000) to remove the exemption for video gaming\r\r\n\r\r\nmachines, thereby rendering the possession or operation of these machines\r\r\n\r\r\nillegal. 5\r\r\n  Further, under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-21-2712 (2000), these machines\r\r\n\r\r\nare then subject to forfeiture and destruction by the State. 6\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBefore the referendum was held, an action was brought challenging its\r\r\n\r\r\nconstitutionality. After taking the case in our original jurisdiction, in\r\r\n\r\r\nOctober 1999, this Court struck down the referendum but severed it from the\r\r\n\r\r\nremaining parts of the Act. Specifically, we found Part I, which bans the\r\r\n\r\r\npossession or operation of these machines, to be a free standing legislative\r\r\n\r\r\nenactment and therefore valid. Joytime Distrib. and Amusement Co. v.\r\r\n\r\r\nState, Op. No. 25007 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed October 14, 1999) (Shearouse Adv.\r\r\n\r\r\nSh. No. 32 at 10). Accordingly, on July 1, under Â§Â§ 12-21-2710 and -2712,\r\r\n\r\r\nthese machines will become contraband subject to forfeiture and destruction\r\r\n\r\r\nregardless of their use or operability. See State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video\r\r\n\r\r\nGame Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n5\r\r\n Section 12-21-2710, as amended effective July 1, 2000, provides in\r\r\n\r\r\npart:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is unlawful for any person to keep on his premises or operate\r\r\n\r\r\nor permit to be kept on his premises or operated within this\r\r\n\r\r\nState any vending or slot machine, or any video game machine\r\r\n\r\r\nwith a free play feature operated by a slot in which is deposited a\r\r\n\r\r\ncoin or thing of value . . . .\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n6\r\r\n Section 12-21-2712, as amended effective July 1, 2000, provides:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAny machine, board, or other device prohibited by Section 12-21\r\r\n\r\r\n2710 must be seized by any law enforcement officer and at once\r\r\n\r\r\ntaken before any magistrate of the county in which the machine,\r\r\n\r\r\nboard, or device is seized who shall immediately examine it, and\r\r\n\r\r\nif satisfied that it is in violation of Section 12-21-2710 or any\r\r\n\r\r\nother law of this State, direct that it be immediately destroyed.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.321\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWestside Quik Shop, Inc., et al. v. Stewart and Condon\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMore than seven months after our decision in Joytime and less than\r\r\n\r\r\nsix weeks before the impending ban will go into effect, plaintiffs commenced\r\r\n\r\r\nthis action.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nISSUES\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI.  Are plaintiffs entitled to compensation for the forfeiture of their\r\r\n\r\r\nvideo gaming machines?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nII. Are plaintiffs entitled to compensation for their loss of business?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIII.  Are plaintiffs entitled to compensation for the real property upon\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich their businesses are located?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDISCUSSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPlaintiffs contend Act. No. 125 should be enjoined because it effects a\r\r\n\r\r\ntaking of their video gaming machines without compensation. We find\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiffs are entitled to no compensation because their machines are\r\r\n\r\r\nlawfully subject to forfeiture as contraband.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe forfeiture of contraband that comports with the Fourteenth\r\r\n\r\r\nAmendment's Due Process Clause 7\r\r\n  is not a compensable taking under the\r\r\n\r\r\nTakings Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 8\r\r\n  Bennis v. Michigan, 516 U.S. 442,\r\r\n\r\r\n452 (1996); see also United States v. $7,990.00 in U.S. Currency, 170 F.3d\r\r\n\r\r\n843 (8th Cir. 1999).

Act No. 125 amends Â§ 12\r\r\n\r\r\n21-2710 to include the video gaming machines in question which will become\r\r\n\r\r\nsubject to forfeiture under Â§ 12-21-2712 as of July 1, 2000. We have already\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermined that the forfeiture of gaming machines pursuant to these\r\r\n\r\r\nstatutes accords with due process requirements. Id. 9\r\r\n  We see no reason to\r\r\n\r\r\nanswer this question differently where the forfeiture applies to video gaming\r\r\n\r\r\nmachines that until recently were not contraband.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn determining whether the forfeiture of a particular type of property\r\r\n\r\r\nviolates due process, we consider the nature of the property, the necessity for\r\r\n\r\r\nits sacrifice, and the extent to which it has heretofore been regarded as\r\r\n\r\r\nwithin the police power. See Sentell v. New Orleans &amp; C.R. Co., 166 U.S.\r\r\n\r\r\n698, 705 (1897); Peoples Program for Endangered Species v. Sexton, 323 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n526, 529, 476 S.E.2d 477, 479 (1996). Gaming devices in general have long\r\r\n\r\r\nbeen recognized as legitimately within the police power of the State to\r\r\n\r\r\ncontrol or take by forfeiture, Lawton v. Steele, 152 U.S. 133, 136 (1894), and\r\r\n\r\r\nwe have consistently deferred to the legislature's determination of what\r\r\n\r\r\ngaming devices must be sacrificed for the public welfare. See, e.g., Johnson\r\r\n\r\r\nv. Collins Entertainment Co., supra. Further, we have acknowledged the\r\r\n\r\r\ndifficulty of enforcing statutes prohibiting gaming. State v. Kizer, 164 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n383, 162 S.E. 444 (1932), overruled on other grounds, State v. 192 Coin\r\r\n\r\r\nOperated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000). As\r\r\n\r\r\nthe United States Supreme Court has observed, forfeiture serves a deterrent\r\r\n\r\r\npurpose both by preventing the further illicit use of the property and by\r\r\n\r\r\nimposing an economic penalty, thereby rendering the illegal behavior\r\r\n\r\r\nunprofitable. Bennis, 516 U.S. at 452 (quoting Calero-Toledo v. Pearson\r\r\n\r\r\nYacht Leasing Co., 416 U.S. 663, 687 (1974)). We conclude the forfeiture of\r\r\n\r\r\ngaming machines pursuant to ÂºÂ§Â§ 12-21-2710 and -2712 comports with due\r\r\n\r\r\nprocess even when applied to machines that were previously lawfully\r\r\n\r\r\npossessed.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther, we note there will have been a lapse of more than eight\r\r\n\r\r\nmonths from the time Part I of Act No. 125 became law by decision of this\r\r\n\r\r\nCourt in October 1999 and the date it becomes enforceable on July 1, 2000.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n9\r\r\n We construed Â§ 12-21-2712 to include an opportunity for the owner to\r\r\n\r\r\ncontest the magistrate's determination of illegality.

Stewart and Condon\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDuring this time, plaintiffs owning video gaming machines have been free to\r\r\n\r\r\nprofitably dispose of them out of state. These plaintiffs have had a\r\r\n\r\r\nreasonable period of time to avoid any forfeiture of their property and cannot\r\r\n\r\r\nclaim a compensable taking. See Hamilton v. Kentucky Distilleries &amp;\r\r\n\r\r\nWarehouse Co., 251 U.S. 146 (1919) (finding no taking under War-Time\r\r\n\r\r\nProhibition Act which prohibited sale of liquor but allowed a period of seven\r\r\n\r\r\nmonths and nine days to dispose of stored liquor).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe find the forfeiture of plaintiffs' video gaming machines, or their\r\r\n\r\r\nleasehold interest in these machines, is not a compensable taking under\r\r\n\r\r\neither our Federal or State Constitutions.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nII.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPlaintiffs claim the forfeiture of their video gaming machines effects a\r\r\n\r\r\ntaking of their businesses.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIt has long been settled that injury to a business dependent on\r\r\n\r\r\nconfiscated property is not compensable under the Fifth Amendment.\r\r\n\r\r\nUnited States v.

Eastern\r\r\n\r\r\nEnterprises v. Apfel, 524 U.S. 498 (1998). Although plaintiffs assert their\r\r\n\r\r\nreal property is well-suited in location and configuration only to the video\r\r\n\r\r\ngaming business, they cannot tenably claim it will have absolutely no\r\r\n\r\r\neconomic value if no longer used to house video gaming operations. Further,\r\r\n\r\r\neven if the regulation does deny the owner all economically viable use of his\r\r\n\r\r\nland, it does not constitute a taking if it substantially advances legitimate\r\r\n\r\r\ngovernment interests. Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S.\r\r\n\r\r\n1003 (1992). As discussed above, we find the forfeiture of video gaming\r\r\n\r\r\nmachines does substantially advance legitimate government interests in\r\r\n\r\r\nprohibiting illicit gaming.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMoreover, even where he is deprived of all economically viable use of\r\r\n\r\r\nhis property, an owner must still have reasonable investment-backed\r\r\n\r\r\nexpectations to establish a taking. Good v. United States, 189 F.3d 1355\r\r\n\r\r\n(Fed. Cir. 1999); McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, Op. No. 25108\r\r\n\r\r\n(S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh.

The circuit court granted the \r\r\n\r\r\nChurch's motion for summary judgment, ruling the action was time-barred \r\r\n\r\r\npursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (1976) and Doe v. R.D., 308 S.C. 139, 417 \r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 541 (1992). The Court of Appeals reversed. Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary \r\r\n\r\r\nChurch of God, 334 S.C. 150, 511 S.E.2d 699 (Ct. App. 1999). We \r\r\n\r\r\ngranted the Church's petition for a writ of certiorari to review that decision and \r\r\n\r\r\nnow affirm.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTS\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe will briefly outline the facts, which are set forth more fully in \r\r\n\r\r\nthe Court of Appeals' opinion. Moriarty was born August 26, 1971. She \r\r\n\r\r\nattended the Church's Kiddie Kollege Day Care Center from August 1973, when \r\r\n\r\r\nshe was two years old, until May 1976, when she was about 41/z years old. \r\r\n\r\r\nDuring that period, Moriarty became stubborn and unhappy. She experienced \r\r\n\r\r\nnight terrors and grew apprehensive about attending day care. A pediatrician, \r\r\n\r\r\nwho was unaware of anything unusual happening at the day care center, told \r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty's mother not to worry about it.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty continued to have emotional problems and teachers told \r\r\n\r\r\nher mother that Moriarty did not work up to her potential. She received mental \r\r\n\r\r\nhealth counseling during her school years. In 1992, Moriarty sought mental \r\r\n\r\r\nhealth counseling again after she began obsessively counting numbers in her \r\r\n\r\r\nhead. She became depressed, missed her nursing classes, slept excessively, and \r\r\n\r\r\nbegan taking Prozac.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter studying masturbation in her nursing classes, she became \r\r\n\r\r\nobsessed it was abnormal. Her studies and counseling apparently triggered her \r\r\n\r\r\nrecovery of the repressed memories. She began to see pictures in her mind of \r\r\n\r\r\na little girl's hand masturbating a male and in late November 1992, she \r\r\n\r\r\nrecognized the hand as her own. Moriarty remembered wearing a particular \r\r\n\r\r\nyellow dress during an episode of abuse, and an old family film not viewed in \r\r\n\r\r\nyears showed her wearing that dress. Moriarty recalled particular physical \r\r\n\r\r\ncharacteristics of the abuser: crooked teeth, bushy eyebrows, and frizzy hair.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.295\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nShe visited each of the locations where she had attended day care and had a\r\r\n\r\r\n\"strong reaction\" to Kiddie Kollege. Upon review of a series of photographs, she\r\r\n\r\r\nhad a \"strong reaction\" to a picture of one individual who had bushy eyebrows\r\r\n\r\r\nand frizzy hair. Moriarty recalled her abuser used a particular name to refer\r\r\n\r\r\nto his penis. She further remembered her abuser warning her that if she told\r\r\n\r\r\nabout the abuse she would be \"overtaken by the devil.\" Moriarty alleged the\r\r\n\r\r\nabuser removed her from supervised rest periods to perform the abusive acts.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe complaint that Moriarty, then twenty-six years old, filed in\r\r\n\r\r\nNovember 1995 alleged causes of action for negligent infliction of severe\r\r\n\r\r\nemotional distress, invasion of privacy, negligent supervision, and breach of\r\r\n\r\r\nwarranty. Moriarty contended she had sued the Church within three years of\r\r\n\r\r\nrecovering specific memories of the alleged abuse in late 1992 and 1993, and her\r\r\n\r\r\nlawsuit was timely under the discovery rule contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3\r\r\n\r\r\n535 (Supp. 1999). 1\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Church argued the action accrued, if at all, not later than May\r\r\n\r\r\n1976. Therefore, Moriarty's action was time-barred because she failed to\r\r\n\r\r\ncommence it within one year of her twenty-first birthday or not later than\r\r\n\r\r\nAugust 26, 1993. See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 (1976). 2  The Church further\r\r\n\r\r\nargued the statute of limitations was not tolled under section 15-3-535.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court of Appeals rejected the Church's position and reversed\r\r\n\r\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to the Church.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe affirm without extensive discussion the Court of Appeals'\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1  Section 15-3-535 provides:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nExcept as to actions initiated under Section 15-3-545, all actions\r\r\n\r\r\ninitiated under Section 15-3-530(5) must be commenced within\r\r\n\r\r\nthree years after the person knew or by the exercise of reasonable\r\r\n\r\r\ndiligence should have known that he had a cause of action.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2  The reduction in the age of majority from twenty-one to eighteen took\r\r\n\r\r\neffect July 2, 1976, about two months after Moriarty stopped attending the\r\r\n\r\r\nChurch's day care center. Act No. 695, 1976 Acts 1886. Therefore, her case\r\r\n\r\r\nwould fall under the twenty-one-year provision.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.296\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nholding that repressed memories of sexual abuse can exist and a plaintiff may\r\r\n\r\r\nattempt to recover damages when those memories are triggered and\r\r\n\r\r\nremembered. The condition is known as dissociative amnesia. A cause of action\r\r\n\r\r\nbased on such a theory is valid in South Carolina for the reasons set forth by\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Court of Appeals. Moriarty, 334 S.C. at 156-62, 511 S.E.2d at 702-05.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe will address in more detail the Court of Appeals' holdings\r\r\n\r\r\nregarding the use of the discovery rule contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nISSUES\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1.  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that a\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff may assert the \"discovery rule\"\r\r\n\r\r\ncontained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 in a case\r\r\n\r\r\ninvolving repressed memory of sexual abuse?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2.  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that a\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed memory plaintiff must provide\r\r\n\r\r\ncorroborating evidence of injury as a prerequisite\r\r\n\r\r\nto application of the discovery rule?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3.  If corroborating evidence is a prerequisite to\r\r\n\r\r\napplication of the discovery rule, did the Court of\r\r\n\r\r\nAppeals err by permitting circumstantial\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence to satisfy that prerequisite?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n4.  If corroborating evidence is a prerequisite to\r\r\n\r\r\napplication of the discovery rule, may application\r\r\n\r\r\nof the rule and the existence of corroborating\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence remain questions of fact for the jury?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\r\n\r\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue\r\r\n\r\r\nas to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as\r\r\n\r\r\na matter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Summary judgment is not appropriate\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen further inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.297\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\napplication of the law. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d\r\r\n\r\r\n187 (1997). Summary judgment should not be granted even when there is no\r\r\n\r\r\ndispute as to evidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be\r\r\n\r\r\ndrawn from those facts. Id. In determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\r\n\r\r\nexist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may\r\r\n\r\r\nbe drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.\r\r\n\r\r\nManning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988). An appellate court\r\r\n\r\r\nreviews the granting of summary judgment under the same standard applied\r\r\n\r\r\nby the trial court pursuant to Rule 56, SCRCP. Wells v. City of Lynchburg, 331\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 296, 501 S.E.2d 746 (Ct. App. 1998).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe are free to decide questions of law - in this case whether South\r\r\n\r\r\nCarolina recognizes a certain cause of action and whether the discovery rule\r\r\n\r\r\nmay apply when that cause of action is asserted - with no particular deference\r\r\n\r\r\nto the lower court. See S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9; S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 14-3-\r\r\n\r\r\n320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 1999); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 1999)\r\r\n\r\r\n(granting Supreme Court and Court of Appeals the jurisdiction to correct errors\r\r\n\r\r\nof law in both law and equity actions); I'On v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, Op. No.\r\r\n\r\r\n25048 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 17, 2000) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 2 at 1).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDISCUSSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1. APPLICATION OF DISCOVERY RULE\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Church contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding that the\r\r\n\r\r\n\"discovery rule may toll the statute of limitations during the period a victim\r\r\n\r\r\npsychologically represses her memory of sexual abuse.\" Moriarty, 334 S.C. at\r\r\n\r\r\n168, 511 S.E.2d at 709 (emphasis in original). 3  We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3  Cases addressing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 usually have not described\r\r\n\r\r\nthat statute as \"tolling\" the statute of limitations. The cases typically state that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe statute of limitations \"begins to run\" on the date the plaintiff either knew\r\r\n\r\r\nor should have known through the exercise of reasonable diligence that she had\r\r\n\r\r\na cause of action. See, e.g., Roe v: Doe, 28 F.3d 404 (4th Cir. 1994); True v.\r\r\n\r\r\nMonteith, 327 S.C. 116, 489 S.E.2d 615 (1997); Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n126, 442 S.E.2d 169 (1994); Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange, Inc., 276 S.C. 301,\r\r\n\r\r\n278 S.E.2d 333 (1981); Dorman v. Campbell, 331 S.C. 179, 500 S.E.2d 786 (Ct.\r\r\n\r\r\n(3 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.298\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA plaintiff must bring a personal injury action within three years\r\r\n\r\r\nafter the plaintiff knew or by the exercise of reasonable diligence should have\r\r\n\r\r\nknown that she had a cause of action. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(5) and -535\r\r\n\r\r\n(Supp. 1999). \"The exercise of reasonable diligence means simply that an\r\r\n\r\r\ninjured party must act with some promptness where the facts and\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstances of an injury would put a person of common knowledge and\r\r\n\r\r\nexperience on notice that some right of his has been invaded or that some claim\r\r\n\r\r\nagainst another party might exist. The statute of limitations begins to run from\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(3 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\nApp. 1998); Brown v. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 483 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1997); see\r\r\n\r\r\nalso Mills v. Killian, 273 S.C. 66, 254 S.E.2d 556 (1979) (concluding \"the accrual\r\r\n\r\r\nupon discovery rule represents the more equitable and rational view\" in a case\r\r\n\r\r\nthat arose prior to the enactment of section 15-3-535). Section 15-3-535 does\r\r\n\r\r\nnot contain any express \"tolling\" provisions, unlike S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40,\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich we have described as a \"tolling statute.\" See Wiggins, supra (using\r\r\n\r\r\n\"begins to run\" language when discussing section 15-3-535 and \"tolling\"\r\r\n\r\r\nlanguage when discussing section 15-3-40).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty could have brought her lawsuit under two other statutes of\r\r\n\r\r\nlimitation if she had done so in a timely manner: the six-year limit of S.C. Code\r\r\n\r\r\nAnn. Â§ 15-3-530(5) that was in effect in 1976 and the age of majority statute\r\r\n\r\r\ncontained in section 15-3-40. The time periods established in those statutes had\r\r\n\r\r\nexpired by the time Moriarty brought her lawsuit in 1995; therefore, one could\r\r\n\r\r\nargue there was no statute of limitations to \"toll,\" i.e., \"to suspend or stop\r\r\n\r\r\ntemporarily.\" See Black's Law Dictionary 1488 (1990). On the other hand, one\r\r\n\r\r\ncould conclude, as the Court of Appeals apparently did, that the initial six-year\r\r\n\r\r\nlimit or age of majority statute was tolled by Moriarty's repression of the\r\r\n\r\r\nmemories.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDistinctions about whether another statute of limitations is \"tolled\" by\r\r\n\r\r\nsection 15-3-535 or whether a cause of action accrues upon discovery, thus\r\r\n\r\r\ncausing the limitations period to begin to run under section 15-3-535, appear\r\r\n\r\r\nlargely academic. Cf. Hearndon v. Graham, 710 So.2d 87, 90-92 (Fla. Ct. App.\r\r\n\r\r\n1998). The ultimate question remains the same: May a plaintiff assert section\r\r\n\r\r\n15-3-535 in a repressed memory case in order to maintain a timely cause of\r\r\n\r\r\naction? However, for consistency's sake, we adhere to our analysis in previous\r\r\n\r\r\ncases and avoid use of \"tolling\" language in discussing section 15-3-535.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.299\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nthis point and not when advice of counsel is sought or a full-blown theory of\r\r\n\r\r\nrecovery developed.\" Wiggins v. Edwards, 314 S.C. 126, 128, 442 S.E.2d 169,\r\r\n\r\r\n170 (1994) (quoting Snell v. Columbia Gun Exchange Inc., 276 S.C. 301, 278\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 333 (1981)).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\"The important date under the discovery rule is the date that a\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff discovers the injury, not the date of the discovery of the identity of [the]\r\r\n\r\r\nwrongdoer.\" Wiggins, supra. However, under section 15-3-535, \"the statute of\r\r\n\r\r\nlimitations is triggered not merely by knowledge of an injury but by knowledge\r\r\n\r\r\nof facts, diligently acquired, sufficient to put an injured person on notice of the\r\r\n\r\r\nexistence of a cause of action against another.\" True v. Monteith, 327 S.C. 116,\r\r\n\r\r\n118, 489 S.E.2d 615, 617 (1997).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nInitially, we agree with the Church and the Court of Appeals that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe circuit court's reliance on Doe v. R.D., 308 S.C. 139, 417 S.E.2d 541(1992)\r\r\n\r\r\nwas misplaced. In Doe, the plaintiff was fully aware that he had been sexually\r\r\n\r\r\nabused by his father from age six to sixteen. He filed a lawsuit against his\r\r\n\r\r\nparents more than twenty years after the abuse ended and long past the age of\r\r\n\r\r\nmajority. The plaintiff argued the discovery rule should apply or the majority\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute of limitations should be tolled until he discovered the extent of his\r\r\n\r\r\ninjuries through a diagnosis of delayed stress syndrome.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe rejected those arguments, concluding only the Legislature may\r\r\n\r\r\ncreate such an exception to the statutes of limitation. We noted, however, that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe plaintiff had not alleged he only recently discovered he was sexually abused\r\r\n\r\r\nby his father, suggesting that might lead to different result. Id. at 141, 417\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d at 542.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe find Doe distinguishable because it was not a repressed memory\r\r\n\r\r\ncase. Moriarty, unlike the plaintiff in Doe, did not realize she had been injured\r\r\n\r\r\nby sexual abuse until her studies and counseling allegedly caused her to recover\r\r\n\r\r\nthe repressed memories. It is not necessary to create any exception to the\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute of limitations in Moriarty's case. It is necessary only to apply the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule's requirement of reasonable diligence, as this Court and others\r\r\n\r\r\nhave done in various cases. See, e.g., Hinson v. Owens-Illinois Inc., 677 F.\r\r\n\r\r\nSupp. 406 (D.S.C. 1987) (asbestos case); True, supra (legal malpractice action\r\r\n\r\r\nby client); Ropers v. Efird's Exterminating Co., 284 S.C. 377, 325 S.E.2d 541\r\r\n\r\r\n(1985) (action by homeowner against termite extermination company); Brown\r\r\n\r\r\nv. Pearson, 326 S.C. 409, 483 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 1997) (sexual harassment\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.300\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\naction by church members against pastor).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSimilarly, we conclude the view expressed in Roe v. Doe, 28 F.3d\r\r\n\r\r\n404 (4th Cir. 1994) is neither dispositive nor at odds with application of the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule in this case. In Roe, the plaintiff discovered her injury by\r\r\n\r\r\ngradually recovering memories of sexual abuse that she had repressed since the\r\r\n\r\r\nage of four or five. The Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, applying the discovery\r\r\n\r\r\nrule in an objective fashion, concluded the plaintiff sufficiently had regained her\r\r\n\r\r\nmemory to discover the injury no later than May 4,1989. Thus the lawsuit she\r\r\n\r\r\nfiled May 5, 1992, did not comply with the three-year limit contained in S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-3-535.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nRoe stands for the proposition that a repressed memory plaintiff -\r\r\n\r\r\nlike plaintiffs seeking to use the discovery rule in other cases - must bring her\r\r\n\r\r\naction within the required period after the date a reasonable person would have\r\r\n\r\r\nregained sufficient memories to discover her injury. Unlike the plaintiff in Roe,\r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty filed her complaint within three years after allegedly discovering her\r\r\n\r\r\ninjury by remembering she had been abused at the Church's day care center.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMany states have applied the discovery rule by judicial decision or\r\r\n\r\r\nby statute in childhood abuse cases in which memories allegedly were\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed. See Doe v. Roe, 955 P.2d 951, 960 (Ariz. 1998) (listing cases);\r\r\n\r\r\nDalrymple v. Brown, 701 A.2d 164, 170 n.9 (Pa. 1997) (listing cases); S.V. v.\r\r\n\r\r\nR.V., 933 S.W.2d 1, 20-22 (Tex. 1996) (listing cases and statutes); Moriarty, 334\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 164-65, 511 S.E.2d at 707 (listing cases and statutes); Gregory G.

H. 3927, 110th Leg., lst Sess. (S.C. 1993). The bill\r\r\n\r\r\nwould have required a plaintiff to bring an action for sexual abuse or incest\r\r\n\r\r\nwithin ten years of becoming eighteen or \"within four years from the time of\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery by the person of the injury and the causal relationship between the\r\r\n\r\r\n(4 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.301\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Church contends the discovery rule should not apply because\r\r\n\r\r\nrepression is just another way of describing the normal process of forgetting,\r\r\n\r\r\nand cites courts that have refused to apply the rule in repressed memory cases.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Church relies on Doe v. Maskell, 679 A.2d 1087 (Md. 1996), in which the\r\r\n\r\r\nMaryland Court of Appeals held that a court-created discovery rule did not\r\r\n\r\r\napply in a repressed memory case involving high school students sexually\r\r\n\r\r\nabused by a school chaplain. The Maryland court explained that adversaries\r\r\n\r\r\nof the concept believe no empirical evidence of repression exists, the\r\r\n\r\r\npsychological community disagrees on the subject, and recovered memories can\r\r\n\r\r\nbe manipulated by therapists. The court concluded that repressing a memory\r\r\n\r\r\nand forgetting it are indistinguishable scientifically and legally, and observed\r\r\n\r\r\nthe legislature could address the matter if it wished. Id. at 1091-92.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn our view, equating a repressed memory to merely \"forgetting\"\r\r\n\r\r\nignores advances in the understanding of the human mind. True, it is not a\r\r\n\r\r\nprecise science and many matters cannot be determined, for example, with the\r\r\n\r\r\ncertainty of an engineering problem or mathematical equation in a products\r\r\n\r\r\nliability lawsuit. But the same can be said about many cases involving a \"battle\r\r\n\r\r\nof experts,\" which is why courts and legislatures have developed rules of\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence and principles regarding the admissibility of scientific and technical\r\r\n\r\r\ntestimony. See State v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 19-21, 515 S.E.2d 508, 517-18\r\r\n\r\r\n(1999) (declining to adopt Daubert 5 analysis and explaining procedure trial\r\r\n\r\r\njudge must use under South Carolina Rules of Evidence in deciding whether to\r\r\n\r\r\nadmit scientific evidence); Rules 702-705, SCRE; see also Kumho Tire Co., Ltd.\r\r\n\r\r\nv. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 119 S.Ct. 1167, 143 L.Ed.2d 238 (1999) (holding\r\r\n\r\r\nthat a federal trial judge's gatekeeping obligation under the Federal Rules of\r\r\n\r\r\nEvidence - to ensure that an expert witness' testimony rests on a reliable\r\r\n\r\r\nfoundation and is relevant to the task at hand - applies not only to testimony\r\r\n\r\r\nbased on scientific knowledge, but also to all expert testimony, including\r\r\n\r\r\ntechnical and other specialized knowledge).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(4 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\ninjury and the sexual abuse or incest, whichever occurs later.\" The bill would\r\r\n\r\r\nnot have required any corroborating evidence.

GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Church contends that applying the discovery rule would defeat\r\r\n\r\r\nthe purpose of limitations statutes in this setting. Even a reasonable three- or\r\r\n\r\r\nfour-year-old would recognize such conduct as a battery and so should have only\r\r\n\r\r\nuntil the age of majority plus one year to file an action, the Church argues. The\r\r\n\r\r\nChurch cites Lindabury v. Lindabury, 552 So.2d 1117 (Fla. Ct. App. 1989)\r\r\n\r\r\n(incestuous acts damaged child when they occurred and action filed long after\r\r\n\r\r\nreaching age of majority was time-barred) and Tyson v. Tyson, 727 P.2d 226\r\r\n\r\r\n(Wash. 1986) (sharply divided court rejected application of the discovery rule in\r\r\n\r\r\na case of repressed memories of sexual abuse).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe reject the Church's argument. Instead, we find the views\r\r\n\r\r\nexpressed by the dissenters in Lindabury and Tyson, who would have applied\r\r\n\r\r\nthe discovery rule, more persuasive. The Lindabury dissenter explained that\r\r\n\r\r\nrepression appeared in the literature by the late 1800s and, even though it is\r\r\n\r\r\none of the many \"gray areas\" in the field of psychiatry, courts should not\r\r\n\r\r\nmechanically apply the statute of limitations in such cases. Id. at 1118-21. A\r\r\n\r\r\nmore recent Florida Court of Appeals from another district criticized Lindabury,\r\r\n\r\r\nexplaining that the majority of courts have applied the discovery rule in\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed memory cases. Hearndon v. Graham, 710 So.2d 87 (Fla. Ct. App.\r\r\n\r\r\n1998). The Washington legislature nullified Tyson by enacting a discovery rule\r\r\n\r\r\nin such cases, and the Tyson majority opinion has not been followed by most\r\r\n\r\r\ncourts. See Wash. Rev. Code Â§ 4.16.340 (1999).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOur Court of Appeals and the numerous commentators it cites\r\r\n\r\r\nexplain that young children may sense something wrong has occurred when\r\r\n\r\r\nthey are molested. But they are neither mentally nor emotionally prepared to\r\r\n\r\r\ndeal with it and so may repress the memory for years. Although there is no\r\r\n\r\r\nclear consensus among the psychological, medical, or legal communities about\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed memory syndrome, we do not believe the law should expect a 41/2\r\r\n\r\r\nyear-old child to recognize an \"offensive touching,\" such that the child should\r\r\n\r\r\nalways be bound by the majority statute of limitations.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe reject the Church's argument that the Court of Appeals\r\r\n\r\r\nestablished a discovery rule that will be applied in a subjective fashion. That\r\r\n\r\r\ncourt flatly stated that \"[a]pplication of the discovery rule is an objective\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermination . . . [and] [t]he focus is upon the date of discovery of the injury,\r\r\n\r\r\nnot the date of discovery of the wrongdoer.\" Moriarty, 334 S.C. at 163, 511\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d at 706 (citing Wiggins, supra). The discovery rule will apply in\r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty's case if she can prove to the jury that a person of common knowledge\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.303\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nand experience would not have been put on notice that she had a claim against\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Church until late 1992 and 1993. She will have to establish the fact of her\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed memories by expert testimony because the matter lies outside the\r\r\n\r\r\nexpertise of the lay person. Id. at 171-73, 511 S.E.2d at 710-11.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe rule under the Court of Appeals' opinion is not whether\r\r\n\r\r\nMoriarty herself was on notice by a certain date (a subjective standard), but\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether a reasonable person in her circumstances would have been on notice\r\r\n\r\r\nby a certain date (an objective standard). The statute begins to run on the date\r\r\n\r\r\nthat the jury believed the repression ended and the resurfacing memories would\r\r\n\r\r\nhave put a reasonable person on sufficient notice.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn sum, the discovery rule exists to avoid the harsh and unjust\r\r\n\r\r\nresult of closing the courtroom doors to a plaintiff whose \"blameless ignorance\"\r\r\n\r\r\nresulted in a failure to pursue a cause of action within the limitations period.\r\r\n\r\r\nSee Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 170, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 1025, 93 L.Ed. 1282,\r\r\n\r\r\n1292 (1949). The limitations period is intended to run against those who are\r\r\n\r\r\nneglectful of their rights and who fail to exercise reasonable diligence in\r\r\n\r\r\nenforcing their rights. However, it is not the policy of the law to unjustly\r\r\n\r\r\ndeprive an injured person of a remedy. See Wiggins, supra; True, supra.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAn analogy offered by another court applying the discovery rule in\r\r\n\r\r\na case similar to Moriarty's is enlightening:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe present case might profitably be compared with a\r\r\n\r\r\nhypothetical one. Suppose that the defendant threw\r\r\n\r\r\nacid in a plaintiff s face and blinded her. As a result of\r\r\n\r\r\nher blindness, which was caused by the defendant, the\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff has become disabled from making an\r\r\n\r\r\nidentification, and no other evidence is available.\r\r\n\r\r\nTwenty-five years later, however, a new procedure\r\r\n\r\r\nrestores the plaintiffs 20:20 eyesight. She identifies\r\r\n\r\r\nthe defendant as her assailant from a photograph\r\r\n\r\r\ntaken of the defendant on the day of the assault. To\r\r\n\r\r\napply the statute of limitations against the plaintiff in\r\r\n\r\r\nsuch a case to defeat recovery would surely be\r\r\n\r\r\nintolerable, for to do so would permit the assailant to\r\r\n\r\r\nprofit from his own wrong.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.304\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v.

Compton, 652 A.2d 49, 59 (D.C. 1994).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that a plaintiff\r\r\n\r\r\nmay assert the discovery rule contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 in a case\r\r\n\r\r\ninvolving repressed memories of sexual abuse.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2. CORROBORATING EVIDENCE\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court of Appeals, recognizing the \"horrific possibility of false\r\r\n\r\r\naccusations,\" held that a plaintiff must present independently verifiable,\r\r\n\r\r\nobjective evidence that corroborates a repressed memory claim in order to assert\r\r\n\r\r\nthe discovery rule contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535. That court further\r\r\n\r\r\nheld that expert testimony is required to prove both the abuse and the\r\r\n\r\r\nrepressed memory. Moriarty, 334 S.C. at 168-73, 511 S.E.2d at 709-11. The\r\r\n\r\r\nChurch urges the Court to embrace the requirement of corroborating evidence.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCourts that have not required corroborating evidence reason that\r\r\n\r\r\na repressed memory case is no different than any other \"swearing contest\" or\r\r\n\r\r\n\"battle of experts.\" A plaintiff in a repressed memory case will bear a\r\r\n\r\r\nsubstantial burden of proving a case at trial under the controversial theory, and\r\r\n\r\r\nit is not necessary for the court to impose a higher burden in applying the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule or on the merits. See McCollum v. D'Arcy, 638 A.2d 797, 799\r\r\n\r\r\n(N.H. 1994) (rejecting requirement of corroborating evidence because it is not\r\r\n\r\r\nrequired in other discovery rule cases and legislature may impose it if it\r\r\n\r\r\nwishes); Logerquist v. Danforth, 932 P.2d 281 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1996) (stating\r\r\n\r\r\nmost courts in applying discovery rule in repressed memory case have not\r\r\n\r\r\nrequired corroboration; plaintiff must still prove her case and application of\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule and whether abuse occurred are questions of fact for jury);\r\r\n\r\r\nPhillips v.

The primary reasons other courts have imposed the\r\r\n\r\r\nrequirement are the disagreement among the psychological and medical\r\r\n\r\r\ncommunities about the validity of repressed memory syndrome, the danger a\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff s memories could be faked or implanted during therapy, and the desire\r\r\n\r\r\nthat a plaintiff not have the ability to control the running of the statute of\r\r\n\r\r\nlimitations solely by allegations whose only support is contained within the\r\r\n\r\r\nplaintiff's mind. See Roe v. Doe, 28 F.3d at 408-09 (suggesting that\r\r\n\r\r\ncorroborative evidence of abuse and repressed memory should be required)\r\r\n\r\r\n(Hall, J., concurring); Olsen v.

We\r\r\n\r\r\ndisagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Direct evidence is the testimony of a person who asserts or claims\r\r\n\r\r\nto have actual knowledge of a fact, such as an eyewitness. Circumstantial\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence is proof of a chain of facts and circumstances indicating the existence\r\r\n\r\r\nof a fact.\" State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134,156 n.13, 508 S.E.2d 857, 86 n.13 (1998)\r\r\n\r\r\n(language drawn from jury instruction in criminal case). \"The law makes\r\r\n\r\r\nabsolutely no distinction between the weight or value to be given to either direct\r\r\n\r\r\nor circumstantial evidence.\" Id.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThis Court has not distinguished between the two types of evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nin numerous cases. See, e.g., Tiller v. Nat'l Health Care Center of Sumter, 334\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 333, 341, 513 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1999) (proof that workers' compensation\r\r\n\r\r\nclaimant sustained an injury may be established by circumstantial or direct\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence); Holtzscheiter v.

Best Western Royal Motor Lodge, 282 S.C. 634, 642,\r\r\n\r\r\n321 S.E.2d 63, 68 (Ct. App. 1984) (circumstantial evidence and inferences\r\r\n\r\r\ndrawn therefrom may be relied on to support a finding of fact of an\r\r\n\r\r\nadministrative agency). 6\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe find no reason to draw a distinction between the use of direct or\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstantial evidence in a repressed memory case. The other examples of\r\r\n\r\r\ncorroborating evidence identified above may consist of direct or circumstantial\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence. The focus in this setting is not on whether the corroborating evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nis direct or circumstantial. The focus is on whether the evidence is \"objectively\r\r\n\r\r\nverifiable,\" such that it corroborates the plaintiffs recovered memories.\r\r\n\r\r\nAccordingly, we affirm the Court of Appeals and hold that corroborating\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence may consist of the various examples, including proof of a chain of facts\r\r\n\r\r\nand circumstances having sufficient probative force to produce a reasonable and\r\r\n\r\r\nprobable conclusion that sexual abuse occurred.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n6  In Needs, we also authorized continued use of a circumstantial evidence\r\r\n\r\r\ncharge in criminal cases that states a jury may not convict a defendant \"unless\r\r\n\r\r\nevery circumstance relied upon by the State be proven beyond a reasonable\r\r\n\r\r\ndoubt; and all of the circumstances so proven be consistent with each other\r\r\n\r\r\nand taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the\r\r\n\r\r\nexclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis.\" Needs, 333 S.C. at 156 n.13,\r\r\n\r\r\n508 S.E.2d at 868 n.13. This charge indicates circumstantial evidence requires\r\r\n\r\r\ngreater scrutiny than direct evidence in a criminal proceeding. Regardless, we\r\r\n\r\r\nconclude that circumstantial and direct evidence may be equally valid and\r\r\n\r\r\nconvincing in this civil action.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.308\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v. GARDEN SANCTUARY CHURCH OF GOD\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n4. QUESTIONS OF FACT FOR JURY\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nGiven our holding that corroborating evidence is a prerequisite to\r\r\n\r\r\napplication of the discovery rule in a repressed memory case, the final issue is\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether application of the discovery rule and the existence of corroborating\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence may remain questions of fact for the jury. The answer is \"yes.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nApplication of the discovery rule contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3\r\r\n\r\r\n535, as well as the determination of the date the statute began to run in a\r\r\n\r\r\nparticular case, are questions of fact for the jury when the parties present\r\r\n\r\r\nconflicting evidence. See Arant v. Kressler, 327 S.C. 225, 229, 489 S.E.2d 206,\r\r\n\r\r\n208 (1997) (when testimony conflicts regarding time of discovery of a cause of\r\r\n\r\r\naction, it becomes an issue for the jury to decide); Johnston v. Bowen, 313 S.

App. 1998) (in\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermining whether statute of limitations begins to run under discovery rule,\r\r\n\r\r\njury must resolve conflicting evidence as to whether a claimant knew or should\r\r\n\r\r\nhave known he had a cause of action).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this case, following the Church's motion for a judgment as a\r\r\n\r\r\nmatter of law based on the statute of limitations, Moriarty must demonstrate\r\r\n\r\r\nthe existence of a genuine issue of material fact regarding the application of the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule. She also must present corroborating evidence supporting her\r\r\n\r\r\nclaim of alleged abuse. The court must consider the evidence and all inferences\r\r\n\r\r\nthat may be drawn from it in the light most favorable to Moriarty, the non\r\r\n\r\r\nmoving party. See Rule 56, SCRCP; Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 24 (1988).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIf the motion is denied, Moriarty still bears the burden of proving\r\r\n\r\r\nat trial that she repressed memories of the abuse and that corroborating\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence supports her claim. If the jury finds for the plaintiff on those issues,\r\r\n\r\r\nthe jury must determine when the plaintiff recalled the abuse, such that a\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.309\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nMORIARTY v.

A repressed memory plaintiff may assert the discovery rule\r\r\n\r\r\ncontained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-535 (Supp. 1999). However, the plaintiff\r\r\n\r\r\nmust present - both at the summary judgment stage and at trial - objectively\r\r\n\r\r\nverifiable evidence to corroborate a repressed memory claim in order to use the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule. Such corroborating evidence may consist of direct or\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstantial evidence. The plaintiff must use expert testimony to establish\r\r\n\r\r\nthe abuse and the fact of the repressed memories. The application of the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery rule, as well as the existence of corroborating evidence, are questions\r\r\n\r\r\nof fact for the jury to determine when the parties present conflicting evidence.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe express no opinion on the merits of Moriarty's claim or on the\r\r\n\r\r\nvalidity of repressed memory syndrome as it may apply in her case. We reverse\r\r\n\r\r\nthe grant of summary judgment to Church and remand this case for further\r\r\n\r\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nTOAL, C.J., BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice\r\r\n\r\r\nL.

Ballard, of West Columbia, for respondent.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney grievance matter, David M. Adams \r\r\n\r\r\n(\"Adams\") is charged with violating various provisions of the Rules of \r\r\n\r\r\nProfessional Conduct contained in Rule 407, SCACR, and the Rules for Lawyer \r\r\n\r\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement (\"RLDE\") contained in Rule 413, SCACR. The Full \r\r\n\r\r\nPanel recommended disbarment pursuant to Rule 7(b)(1), RLDE. We agree \r\r\n\r\r\nwith the Full Panel's recommendation and disbar Adams from the practice of \r\r\n\r\r\nlaw.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams is an attorney, formerly licensed to practice law by this Court, who\r\r\n\r\r\nmaintained a law practice in Charleston, South Carolina. On December 29, \r\r\n\r\r\n1998, this Court placed Adams' license on Interim Suspension based upon \r\r\n\r\r\nseveral acts of misconduct. A brief outline of Adams' misconduct as determined \r\r\n\r\r\nby the Full Panel is as follows:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1.  The Sandra K. Livingston/Shirrese B. Brockington Matter:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.311\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the summer of 1998, Sandra K. Livingston (\"Livingston\") was\r\r\n\r\r\nappointed Personal Representative of her father's estate.\r\r\n\r\r\nLivingston hired Adams to be her attorney and/or the attorney for\r\r\n\r\r\nthe estate. Her father's construction company was auctioned and\r\r\n\r\r\nthe net proceeds ($116,985.00) were placed in Adams' escrow\r\r\n\r\r\naccount. Some of the auctioned items were titled vehicles with\r\r\n\r\r\noutstanding liens. Adams did not forward any money to Farmers\r\r\n\r\r\nand Merchants Bank to release the liens, nor did Adams forward to\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Personal. Representative or the estate the balance of\r\r\n\r\r\napproximately $39,890.00 for unencumbered assets. He wrote\r\r\n\r\r\napproximately fifteen checks, using money from the Livingston\r\r\n\r\r\nestate, to persons or entities other than his client, the Livingston\r\r\n\r\r\nestate account, or Farmers and Merchants Bank.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2.  The Wachovia Check Matters: Adams used operating account\r\r\n\r\r\nfunds to satisfy a trust obligation in the Livingston matter in\r\r\n\r\r\nviolation of Rule 1.5 (safekeeping of funds and commingling of\r\r\n\r\r\nfunds). Adams also violated Rule 1.15 by writing an escrow account\r\r\n\r\r\ncheck in the Livingston matter because the Livingston funds had\r\r\n\r\r\nlong since vanished from the escrow account. The check, therefore,\r\r\n\r\r\nused funds from clients other than the Livingston estate.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3.  The Welch Misappropriation: A $33,640.17 deposit was made\r\r\n\r\r\ninto Adams' escrow account for the Welch estate. Adams' account\r\r\n\r\r\nbalance dropped to $5.52. All subsequent Welch disbursements\r\r\n\r\r\nwere made with misappropriated funds.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n4.  The Reynolds Misappropriation: Adams represented Joseph\r\r\n\r\r\nWilliam Reynolds regarding his mother's estate. The net proceeds\r\r\n\r\r\nfrom the sale of the Reynolds' home were placed in Adams' escrow\r\r\n\r\r\naccount. Adams wrote a check with partial disbursement to Mr.\r\r\n\r\r\nReynolds, and partial disbursement to himself. He also wrote\r\r\n\r\r\nseveral checks using the money from the Reynolds' estate payable\r\r\n\r\r\nto the South Carolina Department, of Revenue Estate Tax Division\r\r\n\r\r\nfor the estate taxes of another client. Disbursements regarding the\r\r\n\r\r\nReynolds' estate came from other client funds, including a\r\r\n\r\r\n$3,055.05 check made payable to the South Carolina Department\r\r\n\r\r\nof Revenue and Taxation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n5.  The Internal Revenue Service Matter: Adams failed to pay\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.312\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nfederal income taxes, or filed late tax returns for 1989, 1990, and\r\r\n\r\r\n1991. He failed to file federal tax returns for 1994,1995, and 1996.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Internal Revenue Service seized Adams' home on Kiawah\r\r\n\r\r\nIsland. Adams borrowed $30,000.00 from Blyth Bullock to redeem\r\r\n\r\r\nhis residence: When Adams repaid Ms. Bullock, he used another\r\r\n\r\r\nclient's funds.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n6.  The Barbara Oree Matter: Adams failed to keep Ms. Oree\r\r\n\r\r\ninformed as to the progress of her case, failed to return her phone\r\r\n\r\r\ncalls, and failed to respond to requests for information. He took\r\r\n\r\r\nlittle or no action for the benefit of the estate. Ms. Oree receive a\r\r\n\r\r\nSummons from the Probate Court for contempt for not closing the\r\r\n\r\r\nestate in a timely manner.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n7.  The Burk Y. Herrin, Jr. Matter: Adams was hired to reopen the\r\r\n\r\r\nHerrin estate. Adams misappropriated approximately $3,449.38\r\r\n\r\r\nin the Herrin matter. He also failed to recover 42 shares of stock,\r\r\n\r\r\nand did not supply information to Herrin as to the status of his\r\r\n\r\r\nstock.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n8.  The Michael Arnau Matter: Adams was hired to represent\r\r\n\r\r\nMichael Arnau (\"Arnau\") in a dispute with the IRS over unpaid\r\r\n\r\r\nemployment taxes. Adams failed to take any action on the case for\r\r\n\r\r\nover a year, failed to communicate with Arnau on numerous\r\r\n\r\r\noccasions, and failed to respond to inquires as to the status of the\r\r\n\r\r\ncase. Adams cannot find the bulk of the Arnau file.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n9.  The Patricia O. DeTreville Matter: Adams misappropriated\r\r\n\r\r\n$68,919.38 from the DeTreville estate. Ms. DeTreville closed out\r\r\n\r\r\ntwo estate accounts and provided them to Adams for deposit into\r\r\n\r\r\nhis escrow account in order to make final disbursement to the heirs.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams received $71,155.79 on behalf of the estate. Funds disbursed\r\r\n\r\r\nor expended on behalf of the estate totaled approximately\r\r\n\r\r\n$2,236.41. Adams' escrow account went to a negative balance on\r\r\n\r\r\nOctober 8,1998; and therefore $68,919.38 was misappropriated by\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams, or. applied to uses other than those for which it was\r\r\n\r\r\nintended.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n10.  The Frank Woolbright Matter: Frank Woolbright hired Adams\r\r\n\r\r\nto represent him in an estate matter and a Common Pleas matter.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.313\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams failed to communicate with his client concerning both\r\r\n\r\r\nmatters. Mr. Woolbright received a letter from the Charleston\r\r\n\r\r\nprobate court threatening to rule Mr. Woolbright in contempt for\r\r\n\r\r\nfailing to file a number of documents in the estate. Adams also\r\r\n\r\r\nneglected the Common Pleas matter by failing to respond to\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscovery, and not attending both the September 10, 1998 and\r\r\n\r\r\nSeptember 16, 1998 hearings.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n11.  The Jeannette S. Wood Matter: On December 18, 1997, some\r\r\n\r\r\nreal estate was sold for $19,000 pursuant to an estate matter. A\r\r\n\r\r\ncheck was issued to Adams for $17,135.58 as a result of the sale.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams misappropriated funds due and owing to Jeannette S. Wood,\r\r\n\r\r\nas Personal Representative, or due and owing to the Estate of\r\r\n\r\r\nGeorge Farago. Roper Hospital was supposed to receive some of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe proceeds from the real estate sale. Neither Roper Hospital, its\r\r\n\r\r\nattorney, nor the Personal Representative has received any of the\r\r\n\r\r\nproceeds from the real estate sale on December 18, 1997.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n12.  Escrow Account Violations: Adams failed to comply with Rule\r\r\n\r\r\n417, SCACR, including: a failure to maintain receipt and\r\r\n\r\r\ndisbursement journals specifically identifying the date, source, and\r\r\n\r\r\ndescription of each item deposited; a failure to maintain accurate\r\r\n\r\r\nledger methods; failure to maintain copies of accountings and\r\r\n\r\r\ndisbursements; failure to sufficiently detail the identity of each\r\r\n\r\r\nitem of the receipt and records of deposit; and using an escrow\r\r\n\r\r\naccount check to meet payroll.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n13.  Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Authority: Adams failed\r\r\n\r\r\nto reply to the Notice of Full Investigation and to several letters of\r\r\n\r\r\ninquiry by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct, including letters\r\r\n\r\r\nregarding the following cases: the Barbara Oree matter, the Burk\r\r\n\r\r\nY. Herrin Jr. matter, and,the Edward K. Pritchard, III matter.\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams did respond late to the Third Notice of Full Investigation,\r\r\n\r\r\nbut he did not accurately address all issues contained in the Notice\r\r\n\r\r\nof Full Investigation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n14.  The Full Panel found Adams misappropriated approximately $280,\r\r\n\r\r\n196.44 from his clients. Although some of his clients in these\r\r\n\r\r\nmatters have been fully compensated, $280,196.44 is the total\r\r\n\r\r\namount of money that was mishandled, misappropriated, or used\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.314\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nfor an improper purpose.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn March 4, 1999, Adams was served with a Notice of Filing of Formal\r\r\n\r\r\nCharges by the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (\"Commission\"). He did not file\r\r\n\r\r\nan Answer to the Formal Charges within the thirty days required by Rule 413,\r\r\n\r\r\nSCACR. The Commission filed an Affidavit of Default on April 12, 1999. On\r\r\n\r\r\nJune 4, 1999, Adams was served with a Notice of Filing of Second Formal\r\r\n\r\r\nCharges. He did not file an Answer and an Affidavit of Default was filed on\r\r\n\r\r\nJuly 20, 1999.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn July 28, 1999, a Subpanel hearing-was held. Adams did not appear,\r\r\n\r\r\nbut was represented by counsel, Desa Ballard (\"Ballard\"), of West Columbia.\r\r\n\r\r\nBallard requested a continuance based upon health problems associated with\r\r\n\r\r\nAdams' prostate cancer. We agree with the Subpanel's denial of Adam's request\r\r\n\r\r\nfor continuance based on the reasons cited below. The Subpanel denied the\r\r\n\r\r\nrequest for a continuance, and the companion Motion to Vacate the default\r\r\n\r\r\nbased on the following reasons: (1) Adams elected not to appear at the hearing\r\r\n\r\r\non his own volition because he faxed an affidavit from his employment in\r\r\n\r\r\nMaryland, where he was apparently working on the day of the hearing; (2) the\r\r\n\r\r\ncase had been going on for some time; (3) Adams chose not to reply to the\r\r\n\r\r\ninquiries of the Commission of Lawyer Conduct; and (4) these appear to be\r\r\n\r\r\nwillful refusals to cooperate. The Subpanel did not find the medical evidence\r\r\n\r\r\nindicated Adams' health condition rendered him unable to cooperate with the\r\r\n\r\r\nCommission and attend the hearing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Subpanel recommended: (1) Adam be disbarred on the day of the\r\r\n\r\r\nCourt's opinion in this case; (2) he be required to pay all costs incurred by the\r\r\n\r\r\nCommission in connection with this matter ($343.08); and (3) this Court order\r\r\n\r\r\nimmediate restitution to all persons financially injured, repayment of unearned\r\r\n\r\r\nor inequitable costs, and reimbursement to any claims made against the\r\r\n\r\r\nLawyer's Fund for Client Protection, as authorized by Rule 7(b)(7) of Rule 413.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn November 29, 1999, Adams filed seven exceptions to the subpanel\r\r\n\r\r\nreport pursuant to Rule 26(c)(7), RLDE. The prosecutor filed a response to his\r\r\n\r\r\nexceptions on December 3,1999. On January 21, 2000, the Full Panel adopted\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Subpanel's report.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCONCLUSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBy his conduct, Adams has violated several of the Rules of Professional\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.315\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nConduct and Rules for. Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. The .evidence\r\r\n\r\r\noverwhelmingly demonstrates a pattern of misappropriation of client funds,\r\r\n\r\r\ncommingling of client money, neglect of legal matters, and other misconduct.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Subpanel found Adams engaged in the following acts of misconduct: (1)\r\r\n\r\r\nmisappropriation of approximately $280,196.44; (2) failure to pay federal\r\r\n\r\r\nincome taxes, or filed late tax returns for 1989, 1990, and 1991, and failure to\r\r\n\r\r\nfile federal tax returns for 1994; 1995, and 1996; (3) willful failure to respond\r\r\n\r\r\nto a lawful demand from a Disciplinary Authority, Rule 7(a)(3), RLDE; (4)\r\r\n\r\r\nconduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bring the legal\r\r\n\r\r\nprofession into disrepute or demonstrate an unfitness to practice law, Rule\r\r\n\r\r\n7(a)(5), RLDE; (5) violating the oath of office taken upon the admission to\r\r\n\r\r\npractice law in this state, Rule 7(a)(6), RLDE; and (6) violating specific Rules\r\r\n\r\r\nof Professional Conduct, including Rule 1.1 (competence), Rule 1.3 (diligence);\r\r\n\r\r\nRule 1.4 (communication), Rule 1.15 (safekeeping of property), and Rule 8.4 (all\r\r\n\r\r\nsubsections of misconduct).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline attorneys and to decide the\r\r\n\r\r\nappropriate sanction. Matter of Holt, 317 S.C. 48, 451 S.E.2d 884 (1994). While\r\r\n\r\r\nthis Court may draw its own conclusions and make its own findings in an\r\r\n\r\r\nattorney disciplinary matter, the unanimous findings and conclusions of the\r\r\n\r\r\nFull Parcel are entitled to much respect and consideration. Matter of Larkin,\r\r\n\r\r\n336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999). The Commission recommends disbarment,\r\r\n\r\r\nas provided for in Rule 7(b)(1), RLDE. Based on the egregious nature of Adams'\r\r\n\r\r\nconduct and his outrageous pattern of misappropriation, we agree with the\r\r\n\r\r\nCommission's recommendation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDisbarment in this case is neither excessive nor disproportionate to\r\r\n\r\r\nsanctions imposed by this Court in similar cases involving misappropriation,\r\r\n\r\r\nneglect, and other similar acts of misconduct. See, e.g., Matter of Driggers, 334\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 40, 512 S.E.2d 112 (1999) (attorney disbarred for failing to provide\r\r\n\r\r\ncompetent representation, keep clients informed, consult with clients, promptly\r\r\n\r\r\naccount for and deliver funds and documents, misappropriation of funds, and\r\r\n\r\r\nknowing failure to respond to disciplinary proceedings); Matter of Godbold, 336\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 568, 521 S.E.2d 160 (1999) (attorney disbarred for failing to remit\r\r\n\r\r\nsettlement funds to clients, remit funds to clients' medical providers, failing to\r\r\n\r\r\npay bills, and failing to file state and federal tax returns); Matter of Glee, 333\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 9, 507 S.E.2d 326 (1998) (attorney disbarred for converting client funds for\r\r\n\r\r\nhis own purposes; failing to provide competent representation, failing to comply\r\r\n\r\r\nwith demand for payment, failing to act with reasonable diligence, failing to\r\r\n\r\r\nkeep client informed about status of case, being dilatory in winding up and\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.316\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn the Matter of Adams\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nclosing a probate action, and engaging in conduct involving dishonesty); Matter\r\r\n\r\r\nof Hunter, 331 S.C. 58, 503 S.E.2d 464 (1998) (attorney disbarred for\r\r\n\r\r\nmisappropriating client funds and converting these funds for his own gain,\r\r\n\r\r\nfailing to act with reasonable diligence, and engaging in morally reprehensible\r\r\n\r\r\nconduct); Matter of Edwards, 323 S.C. 3, 448 S.E.2d 547 (1994) (attorney\r\r\n\r\r\ndisbarred for failing to keep clients informed, misappropriating or improperly\r\r\n\r\r\nusing client funds, knowingly presenting false testimony; and in failing to\r\r\n\r\r\ncooperate in investigation of disciplinary charges against him).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAccordingly, we hereby DISBAR Adams, effective on the date of the filing\r\r\n\r\r\nof this order. We order Adams to pay all costs incurred by the Commission in\r\r\n\r\r\nconnection with this matter. We also order Adams, pursuant to Rule 7(b)(7),\r\r\n\r\r\nSCACR, to make complete restitution immediately to all parties whose funds\r\r\n\r\r\nwere misappropriated, including, but not limited to, clients, health care\r\r\n\r\r\nproviders, and financial institutions. To the extent financial institutions, client\r\r\n\r\r\nsecurity funds, or any other source paid restitution on account of Adams'\r\r\n\r\r\nmisappropriation, Adams shall make complete restitution. Within fifteen days\r\r\n\r\r\nof the date of this opinion, Adams shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\r\n\r\r\nshowing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.317\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25159","title":"Etheredge v.

Richland School District One, 330 S.C. \r\r\n\r\r\n447, 499 S.E.2d 238 (Ct. App.1998). We reverse.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn January 25, 1994, Ernest Dunlap (Dunlap), was shot and \r\r\n\r\r\nkilled by Floyd Brown (Floyd), a student at Eau Claire High School (Eau \r\r\n\r\r\nClaire), while standing in the hallway during a class change. Linda \r\r\n\r\r\nEtheredge (Etheredge), personal representative of the estate of Dunlap filed \r\r\n\r\r\nan action against Richland County School District One (School District)\r\r\n\r\r\nalleging wrongful death. The School District moved for summary judgment \r\r\n\r\r\naverring that the actions were barred by the South Carolina Tort Claims Act. \r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-78-10, et seq. (Supp. 1999).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe evidence submitted to the trial court at the summary \r\r\n\r\r\njudgment hearing consisted primarily of several affidavits. The School \r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict submitted the affidavits of two Eau Claire employees (1) Dorothy \r\r\n\r\r\nWalker, a teacher and (2) Ellen Mosely, the principal at the time of the \r\r\n\r\r\nshooting. Etheredge submitted the affidavit of Harland Brown (Brown), one \r\r\n\r\r\nof the campus monitors employed by the school.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBrown was employed at Eau Claire from September 1993 \r\r\n\r\r\nthrough February 1994. In his affidavit, he stated that he was informed that \r\r\n\r\r\nhis job would entail breaking up fights, preventing the students from having \r\r\n\r\r\ndrugs and alcohol on the premises at the high school, and providing security \r\r\n\r\r\nfor the school. Brown alleged that he received absolutely no training from \r\r\n\r\r\nthe School District or Eau Claire.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBrown asserted that he was not given the proper equipment to \r\r\n\r\r\nperform his job 1\r\r\n  and his requests to the School District for the appropriate \r\r\n\r\r\nequipment were ignored. He also insisted that he needed the authority to\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1\r\r\n Brown felt that he needed a uniform, a badge to display authority, \r\r\n\r\r\npossibly a sidearm, a night stick, a flashlight, chemical mace, and handcuffs \r\r\n\r\r\nand/or other restraining devices.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.328\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEtheredge v. Richland School District One\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nsearch the persons, bookbags or lockers of the students. Brown described the\r\r\n\r\r\nsituation at Eau Claire as very volatile. He expressed his belief that\r\r\n\r\r\nstudents apprehended for criminal activity were never disciplined in a\r\r\n\r\r\nmanner consistent with the severity of their offense. He was present at Eau\r\r\n\r\r\nClaire in his capacity as campus monitor on the day of the shooting.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe trial court granted the School District's motion based on S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 15-78-60 (Supp. 1999). 2\r\r\n  Etheredge appealed.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded, holding\r\r\n\r\r\nthat the trial court erred in granting summary judgment and finding that\r\r\n\r\r\nthere was sufficient evidence to create a jury question whether the School\r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict acted in a grossly negligent manner. We granted the School\r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict's petition for a writ of certiorari.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe School District argues that the Court of Appeals erred in\r\r\n\r\r\nholding that Brown's affidavit created a genuine issue of material fact\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether the School District was grossly negligent. We agree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA governmental entity is not liable for a loss resulting from the\r\r\n\r\r\n\"responsibility or duty including but not limited to supervision, protection,\r\r\n\r\r\ncontrol, confinement, or custody of any student . . . except when the\r\r\n\r\r\nresponsibility or duty is exercised in a grossly negligent manner.\" S.C. Code\r\r\n\r\r\nAnn. Â§ 15-78-60(25) (Supp. 1999).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nGross negligence is the intentional conscious failure to do\r\r\n\r\r\nsomething which it is incumbent upon one to do or the doing of a thing\r\r\n\r\r\nintentionally that one ought not to do. Clyburn v. Sumter County District\r\r\n\r\r\nSeventeen, 317 S.C. 50, 451 S.E.2d 885 (1994); Richardson v. Hambright,\r\r\n\r\r\n296 S.C. 504, 374 S.E.2d 296 (1988). It is the failure to exercise slight care.\r\r\n\r\r\nClyburn, supra. Gross negligence has also been defined as a relative term,\r\r\n\r\r\nand means the absence of care that is necessary under the circumstances.\r\r\n\r\r\nHollins v. Richland County School District One, 310 S.C. 486, 427 S.E.2d 654\r\r\n\r\r\n(1993). Additionally, while gross negligence ordinarily is a mixed question of\r\r\n\r\r\nlaw and fact, when the evidence supports but one reasonable inference, the\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2\r\r\n The trial court relied upon five subsections of Â§ 15-78-60: subsections\r\r\n\r\r\n(4), (5), (9), (20), and (25).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.329\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEtheredge v. Richland School District One\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nquestion becomes a matter of law for the court. Clyburn, supra.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate when it is clear that there is\r\r\n\r\r\nno genuine issue of material fact and the conclusions and inferences to be\r\r\n\r\r\ndrawn from the facts are undisputed. SSI Medical Services. Inc. v. Cox, 301\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 493, 392 S.E.2d 789 (1990). In ruling on a motion for summary\r\r\n\r\r\njudgment, the evidence and the inferences which can be drawn therefrom\r\r\n\r\r\nshould be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Clyburn, supra, we affirmed the decision of the Court of\r\r\n\r\r\nAppeals and the lower court granting summary judgment to the School\r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict. We held that the School District was not grossly negligent as a\r\r\n\r\r\nmatter of law in its handling of a dispute between a student and a\r\r\n\r\r\nnonstudent where the nonstudent attacked the student on a school bus with\r\r\n\r\r\na knife. After hearing of the initial altercation on the bus, the school bus\r\r\n\r\r\nadministrator called the student and the nonstudent's sister into the office to\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscuss the situation, warned the sister that the nonstudent sister would face\r\r\n\r\r\ncriminal charges if she boarded the bus again and attempted to contact the\r\r\n\r\r\nparents. The bus driver watched for the nonstudent and stated she would\r\r\n\r\r\nnot stop the bus if she saw the nonstudent. We found that the intervention\r\r\n\r\r\nshowed that the School District exercised at the very least \"slight care.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn Hollins, supra, we found that whether the School District\r\r\n\r\r\nexercised \"slight care\" in sending a note home with an eleven-year old\r\r\n\r\r\nstudent who lost her bus privileges was a question for the jury. The\r\r\n\r\r\nsuspension notice was given to the child and not directly to her mother.\r\r\n\r\r\nWhile walking home, the eleven-year old was fatally struck by an automobile\r\r\n\r\r\nwhile attempting to cross the highway. We said that the school itself created\r\r\n\r\r\nthe risk by failing to give adequate notice to the parent about the\r\r\n\r\r\nsuspension. We took notice of the age difference between the parties and\r\r\n\r\r\ndistinguished the steps taken by the administrators in Clyburn to control the\r\r\n\r\r\nsituation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn this case, the students were high school age and the School\r\r\n\r\r\nDistrict had no direct knowledge or notice of the animosity between Dunlap\r\r\n\r\r\nand Floyd. The only reasonable inference that can be drawn is that the\r\r\n\r\r\nSchool District, at the very least, exercised \"slight care\" to ensure the safety\r\r\n\r\r\nof its students. The principal, assistant principal and the two security\r\r\n\r\r\nmonitors constantly monitored the hallways and were in constant contact\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.330\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nEtheredge v. Richland School District One\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nwith each other by walkie talkies. The teachers stood in their doorways to\r\r\n\r\r\nwatch students during the change of class. Some of the doors were locked to\r\r\n\r\r\nlimit the flow of traffic. A list of suspended students was circulated daily.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere was an intervention system set up to help resolve conflicts between\r\r\n\r\r\nthe students. At the very least, \"slight care\" was taken.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBrown's affidavit describes what he finds to be deficiencies at\r\r\n\r\r\nEau Claire, but there is no evidence in Brown's affidavit that links these\r\r\n\r\r\ndeficiencies or the School District's failure to provide him with a uniform,\r\r\n\r\r\nnight stick or to properly train him to the prevention of this tragic incident.\r\r\n\r\r\nFurther, the fact that the School District might have done more does not\r\r\n\r\r\nnegate the fact that it exercised \"slight care.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe School District also argues that the Court of Appeals\r\r\n\r\r\nerroneously interpreted the School District's Answer as an admission that\r\r\n\r\r\nthe School District had notice, before the shooting, of the problems between\r\r\n\r\r\nDunlap and Floyd. We agree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nParagraph three (3) of the School District's answer states:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Defendant admits that Earnest Dunlap,\r\r\n\r\r\nIII was shot and killed while attending Eau Claire\r\r\n\r\r\nHigh School as a student. The Defendant further\r\r\n\r\r\nadmits that prior to this incident, Ernest Dunlap,\r\r\n\r\r\nIII's actions toward the pupil who shot him created a\r\r\n\r\r\nbelief by that pupil that such pupil was in imminent\r\r\n\r\r\ndanger of losing his life or sustaining serious bodily\r\r\n\r\r\ninjury.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is no indication from this language that the School District knew\r\r\n\r\r\nabout the specific problems between these two students. Nor is there an\r\r\n\r\r\nadmission that the School District had advance notice that a shooting was\r\r\n\r\r\nabout to happen. The answer merely attempts to state the belief of Floyd.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Court of Appeals is\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nREVERSED.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.331\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25161","title":"State v.

Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(\"Bridges\"). We affirm Locklair's conviction and sentence.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThis case involved a fatal love triangle between Locklair, Bridges, and\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges' estranged husband Christopher Jones (\"Jones\"). While Locklair and\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges were dating, Jones decided he wanted to reconcile with Bridges. His\r\r\n\r\r\nattempt at reconciliation led to a fatal altercation between Locklair and Jones.\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair shot Jones three times in a church parking lot and was indicted for\r\r\n\r\r\nJones' murder on June 5,1995 and convicted on June 14,1995. Bridges decided\r\r\n\r\r\nto move in with Locklair after he murdered her husband. While Locklair was\r\r\n\r\r\nfree on a $50,000 bond for Jones' death, he shot and killed Bridges after she\r\r\n\r\r\ndecided to move out of his home.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn April 16, 1995, the day of the fatal incident, Locklair's mother called\r\r\n\r\r\nAllen Nichols (\"Nichols\"), a close friend of Locklair's, because she was concerned\r\r\n\r\r\nthat Locklair may attempt to kill himself. Locklair's mother warned Nichols to\r\r\n\r\r\nkeep Locklair away from guns. Despite these warnings, Nichols decided to go\r\r\n\r\r\ntarget practicing with his .22 caliber rifle and his Beretta pistol with Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\nlater that afternoon. Nichols and Locklair drove to Woodruff, South Carolina\r\r\n\r\r\nto shoot wild turkeys, but the flock got away.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAs they were leaving Woodruff, Locklair asked Nichols to drive by\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges' parents' house so he could return Jones' death certificate and Bridges'\r\r\n\r\r\nsocial security card to her. Nichols knew that Locklair had recently broken up\r\r\n\r\r\nwith Bridges and warned him not to argue with her. When they arrived at the\r\r\n\r\r\nhouse, Locklair attempted to call Bridges on Nichols' cell phone but it would not\r\r\n\r\r\nwork. Locklair reached over and started honking the truck's horn to get\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges' attention. Bridges and her mother, Betty Williams (\"Williams\"),\r\r\n\r\r\nwalked out to Nichols' car. Bridges asked Locklair what was wrong and asked\r\r\n\r\r\nwhy he had cut up her clothes. According to Nichols, Locklair told Bridges he\r\r\n\r\r\nwas sorry and pleaded with her to talk to him. Bridges refused to talk to\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair and said \"no Jimmy, I'm not coming back to you.\" As Nichols shifted\r\r\n\r\r\ngears to prepare to leave, Locklair reached into the glove compartment and\r\r\n\r\r\ngrabbed the Beretta pistol.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols attempted to grab Locklair's shirt collar and Locklair pulled him\r\r\n\r\r\nout of the truck. Bridges and Williams screamed and began to run away.\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols testified that he saw Locklair taking long strides towards Bridges and\r\r\n\r\r\nhe heard Locklair pulling the trigger of the pistol repeatedly, but the safety was\r\r\n\r\r\non. As Nichols attempted to make a running tackle, Locklair disengaged the\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np. 336\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nsafety and shot Bridges in the back. Nichols said he tackled Locklair after the\r\r\n\r\r\nfirst shot but Locklair fired two more times before they fell to the ground. The\r\r\n\r\r\ngun then struck the asphalt and fired an additional round before.jamming.\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair then stood up and told Nichols, \"leave me the f*** alone, I got to do\r\r\n\r\r\nthis.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair stood up after Nichols tackled him and stepped over the victim's\r\r\n\r\r\nbody before walking towards the William's home. Another witness, Robert\r\r\n\r\r\nWilliams, the victim's stepfather, testified that Locklair looked \"like he was\r\r\n\r\r\nhunting somebody.\" Locklair pointed the gun at the house and attempted to\r\r\n\r\r\nfire, but the gun jammed. Nichols tackled Locklair again while he tried to fire\r\r\n\r\r\nat the house. Meanwhile, Robert Williams left the car where he was observing\r\r\n\r\r\nand ran toward Locklair and Nichols. Robert Williams grabbed the gun and\r\r\n\r\r\nwrestled with Locklair over it. He eventually dislodged the gun and it fell on\r\r\n\r\r\nthe ground, discharging once. Locklair pushed Nichols aside and ran toward\r\r\n\r\r\na neighbor's house. Locklair went twenty or thirty feet, looked back once, then\r\r\n\r\r\nran down the street. Robert Williams attempted to shoot Locklair but the gun\r\r\n\r\r\njammed again and did not fire.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Woodruff Police Department issued a bulletin from the Spartanburg\r\r\n\r\r\nCounty Sheriffs office concerning Locklair. The search continued until 4:00\r\r\n\r\r\na.m. the following day, when Locklair was found at his parents'.home five miles\r\r\n\r\r\nfrom the scene. At the police station, Locklair voluntarily waived his rights,\r\r\n\r\r\ngave a tape recorded statement, and signed a hand written confession.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn the day before the murder, Bridges stayed the night with her sister,\r\r\n\r\r\nStacy Waddell (\"Waddell\"). Locklair came to Waddell's house early in the\r\r\n\r\r\nmorning to speak to Bridges. When Locklair went back to Bridges' bedroom he\r\r\n\r\r\nwas carrying an eight inch butcher knife. Waddell demanded the weapon and\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair gave her the knife. Waddell gave the knife to William Earl Jennings\r\r\n\r\r\n(\"Jennings\") who had come to take Locklair home. Jennings testified that\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair flung the knife out of the window as they drove home and said \"you\r\r\n\r\r\ncan't do anything with a knife.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLater that day, Waddell took Bridges to Locklair's home to pick up some\r\r\n\r\r\nof her clothes and personal items. Locklair had shredded all of Bridges' clothes\r\r\n\r\r\nand pictures. Waddell also testified that some of Bridges' identification was\r\r\n\r\r\nmissing.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn the day of the fatal incident, Leslie Taylor (\"Taylor\"), a co-worker of\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges, testified that a man called to speak to Bridges and told Taylor that \"if\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.337\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nsomething doesn't happen, someone is going to die.\" Taylor asked her\r\r\n\r\r\nsupervisor to speak to the caller. Her supervisor identified the caller as\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair. According to the supervisor, Locklair said if she did not let him speak\r\r\n\r\r\nto Bridges \"someone was going to be killed.\" The supervisor told Locklair that\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges was not there and he became angry and hung up the phone.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn May 18,1995, the Spartanburg County Grand Jury indicted Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\nfor murder and possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent\r\r\n\r\r\ncrime. The State served its notice of intent to seek the death penalty on\r\r\n\r\r\nSeptember 3,1996. The jury found Locklair guilty as charged on September 19,\r\r\n\r\r\n1998. On September 20, 1998, the trial judge presented the following\r\r\n\r\r\naggravating circumstances for the jury's consideration at the conclusion of the\r\r\n\r\r\npenalty phase:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1.  The Appellant had a previous conviction of murder.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2.  The Appellant knowingly created a great risk of danger to\r\r\n\r\r\nmore than one person in a public place by means of a weapon\r\r\n\r\r\nor device which would be hazardous to the lives of more than\r\r\n\r\r\none person.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3.  The Appellant murdered two or more persons pursuant to\r\r\n\r\r\none act or one scheme or course of conduct.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOn September 22, 1998, the jury found the existence of the first and\r\r\n\r\r\nsecond aggravating circumstances beyond a reasonable doubt. The jury\r\r\n\r\r\nrecommended the death penalty and the trial judge sentenced Locklair to death.\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair appeals his death sentence and conviction, raising the following issues:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(1)  Whether the trial judge erred by refusing to charge voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\nmanslaughter where there was evidence Locklair was involved in\r\r\n\r\r\na domestic dispute with the victim and the victim's mother threw\r\r\n\r\r\na cigarette case at him immediately before he shot the victim?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(2)  Whether the trial judge erred by ordering Locklair to submit to a\r\r\n\r\r\npsychiatric examination over his objection where he had already\r\r\n\r\r\nbeen judged fit to stand trial, was not asserting insanity, and had\r\r\n\r\r\nnot given notice that he would plead guilty but mentally ill\r\r\n\r\r\n(\"GBMI\")?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(3)  Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on the\r\r\n\r\r\nstatutory aggravating circumstance contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\r\n\r\r\n16-3-20(C)(a)(3) (1976), the \"great risk of death\" aggravator?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.338\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(4)  Whether the trial judge erred by instructing the jury on the\r\r\n\r\r\nstatutory aggravating circumstance contained in S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\r\n\r\r\n16-3-20(C)(a)(2) (1976), the \"prior murder conviction\" aggravator,\r\r\n\r\r\nwhere Locklair did not have a prior conviction for murder at the\r\r\n\r\r\ntime the murder was committed and his conviction for the other\r\r\n\r\r\nmurder came after the homicide in this case?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(5)  Whether Locklair is entitled to a new sentencing hearing\r\r\n\r\r\neven if one of the aggravating circumstances is held to have\r\r\n\r\r\nbeen properly submitted?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI. Voluntary Manslaughter\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair argues that the trial judge erred by refusing to charge voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\nmanslaughter because: (1) there was evidence of a domestic dispute between\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair and Bridges; and (2) Bridges' mother threw a cigarette case at him\r\r\n\r\r\nimmediately before he shot Bridges. We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Voluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in\r\r\n\r\r\nsudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation.\" State v. Johnson, 333\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 62, 508 S.E.2d 29 (1998). Both heat of passion and sufficient legal\r\r\n\r\r\nprovocation must be present at the time of the killing to constitute voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\nmanslaughter. State v. Walker, 324 S.C. 257, 478 S.E.2d 280 (1996) (citations\r\r\n\r\r\nomitted). Sudden heat of passion upon sufficient legal provocation that\r\r\n\r\r\nmitigates a felonious killing to manslaughter must be such as would naturally\r\r\n\r\r\ndisturb the sway of reason, and render the mind of an ordinary person\r\r\n\r\r\nincapable of cool reflection, and produce what, according to human experience,\r\r\n\r\r\nmay be called \"an uncontrollable impulse to do violence.\" State v. Gardner, 219\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 97, 64 S.E.2d 130 (1951) (citing State v. Davis, 50 S.C. 405, 27 S.E. 905\r\r\n\r\r\n(1897)). Where death is caused by use of a deadly weapon, words alone,\r\r\n\r\r\nhowever opprobrious, are not sufficient to constitute a legal provocation. Id. at\r\r\n\r\r\n104, 64 S.E.2d at 134. Rather, when death is caused by the use of a deadly\r\r\n\r\r\nweapon, the opprobrious words must be accompanied by the appearance of an\r\r\n\r\r\nassault - by some overt, threatening act - which could have produced the heat\r\r\n\r\r\nof passion. State v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272 (1993) (citing State v.\r\r\n\r\r\nJudge, 208 S.C. 497, 38 S.E.2d 715 (1946)).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is proper for a trial judge to refuse to charge voluntary manslaughter\r\r\n\r\r\nin a murder case where it very clearly appears there is no evidence whatsoever\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.339\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\ntending to reduce the crime from murder to manslaughter. State v. Davis, 278\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 544, 298 S.E.2d 778 (1983). This Court has held in several cases that it is\r\r\n\r\r\nproper to charge voluntary manslaughter where the defendant and the victim\r\r\n\r\r\nhad been in a heated argument prior to the murder. See State v. Wiggins, 330\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. 538, 500 S.E.2d 489 (1998) (holding that evidence tended to show\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant acted in sudden heat of passion where defendant was in a heated\r\r\n\r\r\nargument with victim and feared for his life because victim threatened him);\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Lowry, 315 S.C. 396, 434 S.E.2d 272 (1993) (holding that a voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\nmanslaughter charge was necessary where the defendant and the victim were\r\r\n\r\r\nin a heated argument and victim was about to initiate a physical encounter\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen shooting occurred); State v. Davis, 278 S.C. 544, 298 S.E.2d 778 (1983)\r\r\n\r\r\n(holding voluntary manslaughter charge was proper where a witness testified\r\r\n\r\r\nthat defendant and victim had been fighting). These cases are distinguishable\r\r\n\r\r\nfrom the instant case because there is no evidence that Locklair and Bridges\r\r\n\r\r\nwere in a heated argument prior to the murder. According to Locklair's hand\r\r\n\r\r\nwritten confession,\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nTammy got smart with me and I am suppose to be on Zoloft med.\r\r\n\r\r\nbut I lost my perscription [sic]. After she got smart with me &amp;\r\r\n\r\r\nstarted to walk off, I grabbed the gun. Her mom threw a cig. case\r\r\n\r\r\nat me, her dad was trying to stop me and Allen also.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAll Locklair claims is that Bridges \"got smart\" with him. However, words alone,\r\r\n\r\r\nno matter how opprobrious, are not sufficient to prove legal provocation when\r\r\n\r\r\na deadly weapon is used. See Gardner, 219 S.C. at 104, 64 S.E.2d at 134. Also,\r\r\n\r\r\n\"getting smart\" with someone would not naturally disturb the sway of reason\r\r\n\r\r\nof an ordinary person and produce an uncontrollable impulse to do violence. Id.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThere is no evidence in the record that indicates Bridges and Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\nwere fighting prior to the incident or that Bridges threatened Locklair in any\r\r\n\r\r\nway. According to Nichols, Bridges calmly spoke to Locklair and never raised\r\r\n\r\r\nher voice. When Nichols testified as to the conversation between Locklair and\r\r\n\r\r\nBridges, he did not note any insulting or threatening language. Nichols\r\r\n\r\r\ndescribed the incident in the following testimony:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols: Tammy said what's wrong with you, Jimmy. He\r\r\n\r\r\nsaid what, what. And she said what have you\r\r\n\r\r\ndone, and he said what are you talking about\r\r\n\r\r\nTammy. And he said, she said you didn't have to\r\r\n\r\r\ndo all those things. She started talking about he\r\r\n\r\r\ncut up her clothes or cut up a check or put water\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.340\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nor something or something to that effect all in\r\r\n\r\r\nthere. And she was asking him you know why in\r\r\n\r\r\nthe world did you do that. You didn't have to do\r\r\n\r\r\nall that. It wasn't necessary for you to do all that\r\r\n\r\r\nstuff . . . .\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nQuestion: Okay, now how was she talking to him there?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols: Just in a, a monotone. She was just wondering\r\r\n\r\r\nyou know just, you know like you know why, why\r\r\n\r\r\nwould you do something like that. Just about\r\r\n\r\r\nthe same tone I am .... There was never any\r\r\n\r\r\nyelling or anything of that nature.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nQuestion: Okay. And what happens after, as, as that's\r\r\n\r\r\ngoing on or, or after that?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols: . . . And Jimmy asked Tammy, she kept saying\r\r\n\r\r\nno, and he said let me just talk to you for a\r\r\n\r\r\nminute. Come here. Just let me talk to you for\r\r\n\r\r\na minute by yourself. Please just; just listen to\r\r\n\r\r\nme, hear me out, and you know that type of\r\r\n\r\r\nthing. And she said no, Jimmy, no .... She said\r\r\n\r\r\nno, Jimmy, I'm not coming back to you. If I'm\r\r\n\r\r\nnot mistaken, that was her last words. And I\r\r\n\r\r\npushed the clutch in, and he, he paused for just\r\r\n\r\r\na second, and then he, he reached for the dash.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe opened up my dash, And when he reached for\r\r\n\r\r\nthe dash, I immediately, I grabbed hold of him.\r\r\n\r\r\n(emphasis added).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nTherefore, since Bridges did not take any overt physical actions against\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair, even the most liberal construction of her words do not reduce the\r\r\n\r\r\ncrime to manslaughter. 1\r\r\n \r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1\r\r\n Locklair argues that State v. Kahan, 268 S.C. 240, 233 S.E.2d 293\r\r\n\r\r\n(1977) is persuasive. In Kahan, the trial judge instructed the jury on\r\r\n\r\r\nvoluntary manslaughter when there was evidence that the couple had been\r\r\n\r\r\narguing at a Christmas party several hours before the shooting and there\r\r\n\r\r\nwere no witnesses to the shooting. This Court ruled the voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\n (1 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.341\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nProvocation necessary to support a voluntary manslaughter charge must\r\r\n\r\r\ncome from some act of or related to the victim in order to constitute sufficient\r\r\n\r\r\nlegal provocation. State v. Tucker, 324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260 (1996). \"The\r\r\n\r\r\nprovocation of the deceased must be such as naturally and instantly produces\r\r\n\r\r\nin the mind of a person ordinarily constituted the highest degree of\r\r\n\r\r\nexasperation; rage, anger, sudden resentment, or terror, rendering the mind\r\r\n\r\r\nincapable of cool reflection.\" State v. Franklin, 310 S.C. 122, 125, 425 S.E.2d\r\r\n\r\r\n758 (Ct. App. 1993), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. State, 336 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999) (emphasis added). Locklair argues that the jury\r\r\n\r\r\ncould find voluntary manslaughter in this case because Williams, Bridges'\r\r\n\r\r\nmother, threw a cigarette case at Locklair prior to the shootings. First, the\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence shows that Williams threw the cigarette case at Locklair after he\r\r\n\r\r\ngrabbed the gun to kill Bridges. According to Locklair's written statement:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"After she got smart with me &amp; started to walk off, I grabbed the gun. Her mom\r\r\n\r\r\nthrew a cig. case at me, her dad was trying to stop me &amp; Allen also.\"  Second,\r\r\n\r\r\nthis overt act was made by a third party, not the deceased, and South Carolina\r\r\n\r\r\nhas not recognized sufficient legal provocation from a third party that can be\r\r\n\r\r\ntransferred to the victim. 2\r\r\n  Finally, throwing a cigarette case would not\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(1 continued...)\r\r\n manslaughter instruction was proper because the defendant claimed his\r\r\n\r\r\nwife's death was a suicide and the jury was required to decide whether he\r\r\n\r\r\nmurdered his wife. The evidence they argued earlier that evening was\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstantial evidence that he killed her in sudden heat of passion. Kahan\r\r\n\r\r\ndoes not hold that words alone constitute sufficient legal provocation.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2\r\r\n Locklair cites the Texas case, Sattiewhite v. Texas, 786 S.W.2d 271\r\r\n\r\r\n(Tex. Crim. App. 1989), for the proposition that provocation on the part of the\r\r\n\r\r\ndeceased or a third party acting in concert with the deceased will support a\r\r\n\r\r\nmanslaughter verdict. However, a Texas statute specifically defines sudden\r\r\n\r\r\npassion as \"passion directly caused by and arising out of provocation by the\r\r\n\r\r\nindividual killer or another acting with the person killed which passion arises\r\r\n\r\r\nat the time of the offense and is not solely the result of former provocation.\"\r\r\n\r\r\nId. at 287 (citing Tex. Code Ann. Â§ 1904(b)) (emphasis added). South\r\r\n\r\r\nCarolina does not have a comparable statute.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair also relies on the South Carolina case, State v. Wyatt, 317 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n370, 453 S.E.2d 890 (1995) for the proposition that provocation by a third\r\r\n\r\r\nparty would support a voluntary manslaughter verdict.

Psychiatric Examination.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair argues the trial judge abridged his Fifth Amendment rights by\r\r\n\r\r\nordering him to submit to a psychiatric examination where he did not assert an\r\r\n\r\r\ninsanity defense and did not give notice that he would plead guilty but mentally\r\r\n\r\r\nill (\"GBMI\"). We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAccording to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-410 (Supp.1998), circuit court judges\r\r\n\r\r\nhave the inherent duty to order a competency examination if there is reason to\r\r\n\r\r\nbelieve that the person charged with the criminal offense is not fit to stand trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSection 44-23-410 states:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWhenever a judge of the Circuit Court or Family Court has reason\r\r\n\r\r\nto believe that a person on trial before him, charged with the\r\r\n\r\r\ncommission of a criminal offense or civil contempt, is not fit to stand\r\r\n\r\r\ntrial because the person lacks the capacity to understand the\r\r\n\r\r\nproceedings against him or to assist in his own defense as a result\r\r\n\r\r\nof a lack of mental capacity, the judge shall:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(1)  order examination of the person by two examiners designated\r\r\n\r\r\nby the Department of Mental Health...; or\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(2)  order the person committed for examination and observation\r\r\n\r\r\nto an appropriate facility of the Department of Mental Health\r\r\n\r\r\nor the Department of Disability and Special Needs . . . .\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-23-410 (Supp. 1998) (emphasis added). Despite the\r\r\n\r\r\nmandatory language of the statute requiring a judge to order a competency\r\r\n\r\r\nexamination if there is reason to believe that a person charged with a criminal\r\r\n\r\r\noffense is not fit to stand trial, ordering a competency examination is within the\r\r\n\r\r\ndiscretion of the trial judge and a refusal to grant an examination will not be\r\r\n\r\r\ndisturbed on appeal absent a clear showing of an abuse of discretion. State v.\r\r\n\r\r\nSingleton, 322 S.C. 480, 472 S.E.2d 640 (Ct. App. 1996). Where insanity is\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n(2 continued...)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\ncrowd as he tried to leave. The appellant shot two men who tried to prevent\r\r\n\r\r\nhim from leaving. The appellant's theory in Wyatt was self-defense.\r\r\n\r\r\nTherefore, under the facts in Wyatt, the provocation derived from the victims'\r\r\n\r\r\nactions, not his wife's, who was merely a third party to the incident.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.343\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\ninterposed as a defense in a criminal prosecution, compulsory examination of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe accused by experts for the purpose of determining his mental condition does\r\r\n\r\r\nnot violate either the constitutional protection against self-incrimination or the\r\r\n\r\r\nconstitutional guaranty of due process of law. State v. Myers, 220 S.C. 309, 67\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 506 (1951). Locklair argues that while a trial judge may order a\r\r\n\r\r\npsychiatric examination where insanity is asserted as a defense, there is no\r\r\n\r\r\nauthority that indicates a trial judge has the authority to order an examination\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen a defendant provides no notice that he will plead GBMI, and GBMI is\r\r\n\r\r\nnever pled. We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe trial judge in this case has the inherent, discretionary authority to\r\r\n\r\r\norder an independent psychiatric evaluation of Locklair if he believed Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\nwas not fit to stand trial or if he believed that Locklair's mental competency\r\r\n\r\r\nwould be an issue at trial. The mental competency of the defendant to stand\r\r\n\r\r\ntrial is a baseline inquiry by the court. In order to protect the legal process 'and\r\r\n\r\r\npreserve the integrity of the trial, a trial judge has the authority to order a\r\r\n\r\r\npsychiatric evaluation of the defendant when his or her competency may be in\r\r\n\r\r\nquestion. 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe trial judge was under the impression that Locklair's mental condition\r\r\n\r\r\nmay be made an issue at trial. At the May 29, 1998  hearing, the trial judge\r\r\n\r\r\nheard the State's motion for an independent mental examination. Defense\r\r\n\r\r\ncounsel provided a copy of their expert's report on Locklair's mental condition.\r\r\n\r\r\nDefense counsel agreed with the trial judge's summary of their expert's\r\r\n\r\r\nconclusions:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Court: And in that report, it indicates that the\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant suffers or did suffer from some\r\r\n\r\r\ntype of mental illness that would cause\r\r\n\r\r\nhim to lack capacity to confirm [sic] his\r\r\n\r\r\nconduct to the requirements of the law at\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3\r\r\n Other jurisdictions require a defendant to submit to a psychiatric\r\r\n\r\r\nexamination when he or she raises issues of mental competency. See\r\r\n\r\r\ngenerally State v. Jackson, 335 S.E.2d 903 (N.C. App. 1985) (holding that\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen defendant asserts insanity as a defense, court has authority to require\r\r\n\r\r\ndefendant to submit to a mental examination by a court-appointed\r\r\n\r\r\npsychiatrist); State v. Myers, 570 A.2d 1260 (N.J.

McWee, 322 S.C. 387, 393, 472 S.E.2d 235, 239 (1996). Locklair claims\r\r\n\r\r\nthe State used evidence from his examination with Dr. Lewis to successfully\r\r\n\r\r\nurge that he be sentenced to death. Dr. Lewis conducted the examination for\r\r\n\r\r\nthe court and found that Locklair had a normal family life and childhood.\r\r\n\r\r\nSpecifically, Locklair takes issue with the following argument by the solicitor:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThey told you or it was told to you that he had a normal childhood,\r\r\n\r\r\nhis grades were normal, he finished high school, he had a good job,\r\r\n\r\r\nhe was never abused by anybody. In spite of his education, in spite\r\r\n\r\r\nof all this background, this is where he ends up. That's what he's\r\r\n\r\r\ndone with that start in life. He had better than many other people\r\r\n\r\r\nI submit to you.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nHowever, Locklair's own social worker provided an independent basis for this\r\r\n\r\r\ninformation. The State did not have to rely on Dr. Lewis' report because\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair's social worker testified that Locklair had a simple life, lived a quiet\r\r\n\r\r\nexistence, was an average student, and had consistent employment.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.345\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v.

Â§ 16-3\r\r\n\r\r\n20(C)(a)(3)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair argues that the trial judge erred by refusing to direct a verdict\r\r\n\r\r\non the \"great risk of danger\" aggravator. This statutory aggravating\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstance states that the jury can consider whether \"the offender by his act\r\r\n\r\r\nof murder knowingly created a great risk of danger to more than one person in\r\r\n\r\r\na public place by means of a weapon or device which would normally be\r\r\n\r\r\nhazardous to the lives of more than one person\" when deciding the appropriate\r\r\n\r\r\npunishment for murder. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (C)(a) (3) (1976). We\r\r\n\r\r\ndisagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\"In determining whether to submit an aggravating circumstance to the\r\r\n\r\r\njury, the trial court is concerned with the existence of the evidence, not its\r\r\n\r\r\nweight.\" State v. Smith, 298 S.C. 482, 485, 381 S.E.2d 724, 726 (1989). The\r\r\n\r\r\ntrial judge should submit the aggravator to the jury if \"supported by any\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence direct or circumstantial.\" Id. The \"great risk of danger\" aggravator\r\r\n\r\r\nwas properly submitted to the jury because there was ample evidence that\r\r\n\r\r\nsuggested Locklair put the lives of more than one person in danger in a public\r\r\n\r\r\nplace by means of a weapon or device which would normally be hazardous to the\r\r\n\r\r\nlives of more than one person.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn construing statutes, words must be given their plain and ordinary\r\r\n\r\r\nmeaning without resort to subtle or forced construction in attempt to expand\r\r\n\r\r\nthe statute. State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991). Here, the\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute mandates that the offender create a great risk of danger to more than\r\r\n\r\r\none person in a \"public place.\" This incident took place in a public place because\r\r\n\r\r\nit occurred on a public street and in William's front yard in a small mill village.\r\r\n\r\r\nThere were many people in the general vicinity of the incident and there were\r\r\n\r\r\nseveral children playing on the public street when the incident occurred.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair argues that a firearm is not a \"weapon or device which would\r\r\n\r\r\nnormally be hazardous to the lives of more than one person.\" Locklair claims\r\r\n\r\r\nthat the statute contemplates the use of a bomb or other explosive device. We\r\r\n\r\r\ndisagree and find that a gun is the type of weapon contemplated by the statute.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe statutory aggravator only requires that the weapon used be \"normally\r\r\n\r\r\nhazardous to the lives of more than one person.\" Requiring the use of a bomb\r\r\n\r\r\nor other explosive device would be a forced construction of the statute adding\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.346\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v.

However, the trial\r\r\n\r\r\ntestimony does not support this assertion. According to Nichols' testimony,\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair put more than one person at great risk of danger because he attempted\r\r\n\r\r\nto fire the gun several times, but the safety was on. After he shot Bridges,\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair pointed the gun at Williams' home where there were children inside.\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols was forced to tackle Locklair to stop him and Robert Williams, the\r\r\n\r\r\nvictim's stepfather, had to struggle with Locklair to retrieve the gun.\r\r\n\r\r\nAccording to the trial testimony, the gun was dropped several times during the\r\r\n\r\r\nstruggle with shots being fired in different directions. Also, at the very least,\r\r\n\r\r\nNichols and Robert Williams, were placed in great danger as they attempted to\r\r\n\r\r\nstop Locklair from firing and retrieve the gun. Finally, Locklair put many\r\r\n\r\r\npeople at great risk of danger. Nichols, Robert William, Betty Williams, Dewey\r\r\n\r\r\nMorgan, and several children playing in the street were all within firing range\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen the shooting occurred.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIV.

Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a)(2) states that the trial judge may include\r\r\n\r\r\nin his instruction the following statutory aggravator if supported by evidence:\r\r\n\r\r\n\"Murder was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction of\r\r\n\r\r\nmurder.\" Locklair shot and killed Bridges on April 26, 1995. At the time of her\r\r\n\r\r\nmurder, Locklair had not been indicted or convicted of Christopher Jones'\r\r\n\r\r\nmurder. On June 5, 1995, Locklair was indicted for the Jones' murder, and on\r\r\n\r\r\nJune 14,1995, Locklair was convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment. The\r\r\n\r\r\ntrial in this case did not commence until September 20, 1996.

Locklair argues that the prior murder conviction must have\r\r\n\r\r\noccurred prior to the date of Bridges' murder in order for the judge to charge the\r\r\n\r\r\naggravating circumstance. We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn State v. Sims, 304 S.C. 409, 405 S.E.2d 377 (1991), this Court\r\r\n\r\r\ninterpreted the language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(b)(1) (Supp. 1989)\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich contained the following statutory mitigating circumstance: the defendant\r\r\n\r\r\n\"had no significant history of prior criminal convictions involving the use of\r\r\n\r\r\nviolence against another person.\" The Court interpreted the word \"prior\" to\r\r\n\r\r\nmean prior to trial, rather than prior to the time of the crime. At the time Sims\r\r\n\r\r\ncommitted the crime in South Carolina, he had no history of prior criminal\r\r\n\r\r\nconvictions because he was not convicted of his California crimes until after he\r\r\n\r\r\ncommitted the crimes in South Carolina. Id. This Court focused on the plain\r\r\n\r\r\nlanguage of the statute in Sims and determined that if the legislature wanted\r\r\n\r\r\nthe prior convictions to occur at the time of the crime, they would have specified\r\r\n\r\r\nit in the statute, as they did in several other statutory mitigating\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstances.

Similarly, the\r\r\n\r\r\nlegislature did not specify in section 16-3-20(C)(a)(2) that the defendant must\r\r\n\r\r\nhave a prior murder conviction at the time of the crime in order to receive an\r\r\n\r\r\ninstruction on the aggravating circumstance.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSouth Carolina's death penalty statute was \"patterned after the death\r\r\n\r\r\npenalty statutes of our sister state Georgia.\" State v. Roach, 273 S.C. 194, 255\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 799 (1979), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence,, 305 S.C. 45,\r\r\n\r\r\n406 S.E.2d 315 (1991). In Stephens v. Hopper, 247 S.E.2d 92 (Ga. 1978), the\r\r\n\r\r\nGeorgia Supreme Court interpreted a statutory aggravating circumstance\r\r\n\r\r\nwhich provided in part that \"the offense of murder, rape, armed robbery, or\r\r\n\r\r\nkidnapping was committed by a person with a prior record of conviction for a\r\r\n\r\r\ncapital felony.\" The Georgia Supreme Court concluded that the jury should\r\r\n\r\r\nconsider the record as of the time of the sentencing proceeding, and not at the\r\r\n\r\r\ntime of the crime. Id. at 96. \"To conclude otherwise would produce the\r\r\n\r\r\nintolerable result that an offender with no prior record could commit numerous\r\r\n\r\r\nseparate murders one after the other before being apprehended, and then, at\r\r\n\r\r\nthe trials for those murders, could never receive death under this aggravating\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstance even though convicted of each and ever one of the murders.\" Id\r\r\n\r\r\nat 96-97.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nOther jurisdictions support the above proposition. North Carolina,\r\r\n\r\r\nMississippi, and Nevada authorize the death penalty where the defendant was\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.348\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\"previously convicted\" of another qualifying crime before trial. These\r\r\n\r\r\njurisdictions have held that the \"previous conviction\" can occur before the trial.\r\r\n\r\r\nSee, e.g., State v. Warren, 499 S.E.2d 431 (N.C. 1998) (holding that the\r\r\n\r\r\n\"previously convicted\" aggravating circumstance includes convictions which\r\r\n\r\r\noccur after the event, provided the conviction occurs before sentencing); Jones\r\r\n\r\r\nv. State, 381 So.2d 983 (Miss. 1980) (holding the word \"previously,\" used in a\r\r\n\r\r\nstatute providing for the use of prior convictions, relates to the time of trial and,\r\r\n\r\r\nthus, defendant's armed robbery conviction, which was entered after he\r\r\n\r\r\ncommitted murder, could be considered during the sentencing phase of his\r\r\n\r\r\nmurder trial). In Calambro v. State, 952 P.2d 946 (Nev. 1998), the Nevada\r\r\n\r\r\nSupreme Court makes a persuasive policy argument for why the \"prior\r\r\n\r\r\nconviction\" aggravator should be considered at the time of sentencing:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe statute was never intended to operate on the vagaries of\r\r\n\r\r\nconviction sequences. Instead, the focal point is the time of\r\r\n\r\r\nsentencing. The sentencing panel is entitled to consider all\r\r\n\r\r\nrelevant aspects of the defendant's criminal background prior to\r\r\n\r\r\nrendering sentence. The fact that Gallego murdered two victims\r\r\n\r\r\nafter killing the two victims in the instant case is not relevant to\r\r\n\r\r\nthe dictates of the statute. The clear language of the statute\r\r\n\r\r\nrequired only that Gallego stood convicted of the California\r\r\n\r\r\nmurders at the time of the introduction of the evidence in the\r\r\n\r\r\npenalty phase of the present, proceeding. It would be both absurd\r\r\n\r\r\nand counterproductive for this court to construe the plain language\r\r\n\r\r\nof the statute so as to exclude convictions of murders or crimes of\r\r\n\r\r\nviolence occurring after the primary offense but before the penalty\r\r\n\r\r\nphase of a defendant's trial. This we refuse to do.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nId. at 947 (citing Gallego v. State, 711 P.2d 856, 863-864 (1985)).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBecause the South Carolina General Assembly did not specify that the\r\r\n\r\r\nprior convictions had to occur before the commission of the crime, we find that\r\r\n\r\r\nfor purposes of section 16-3-20(C)(a)(2), prior convictions have to occur by the\r\r\n\r\r\ntime of the sentencing proceeding. The emphasis in the sentencing phase of a\r\r\n\r\r\ncapital trial is on the character of the defendant. The purpose of the sentencing\r\r\n\r\r\nphase in a capital trial is to direct the jury's attention to the specific\r\r\n\r\r\ncircumstances of the crime and the characteristics of the offender. State v. Ard\r\r\n\r\r\n332 S.C. 370, 505 S.E.2d 328 (1998). According to this Court in State v. Tucker,\r\r\n\r\r\n324 S.C. 155, 478 S.E.2d 260, 270 (1996), \"cases in South Carolina and around\r\r\n\r\r\nthe country have consistently found a defendant's prior criminal record to be\r\r\n\r\r\nhighly relevant in sentencing; any limitations have been directed to admitting\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.349\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nState v. Locklair\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nonly felonies or violent crimes.\" See, e.g., Woodson v. North Carolina, 428 U.S.\r\r\n\r\r\n280, 304, 96 S. Ct. 2978, 2991, 49 L.Ed.2d 944, 961 (1976) (\"[W]e believe that\r\r\n\r\r\nin capital cases . . . the Eighth Amendment . . .requires consideration of the\r\r\n\r\r\nrecord of the individual offender . . . as a constitutionally indispensable part of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe process of inflicting the penalty of death); State v. Stewart, 283 S.C. 104, 320\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 447 (1984) (\" [I]nformation concerning prior criminal convictions shall be\r\r\n\r\r\nadmissible as additional evidence during the sentencing or representing [sic]\r\r\n\r\r\nphase of a capital trial.\"); State v. Jackson, 608 So.2d 949, 954 (La. 1992)\r\r\n\r\r\n(\"Evidence of convictions of serious unrelated crimes is extremely probative of\r\r\n\r\r\nand relevant to the character and propensities of the defendant and may be\r\r\n\r\r\nuseful for the jury to evaluate in performing its awesome task of deciding\r\r\n\r\r\nwhether or not to recommend execution.\"). Therefore, Locklair's prior murder\r\r\n\r\r\nconviction was relevant character evidence that was properly presented in the\r\r\n\r\r\nsentencing phase of the trial.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nV.  New Sentencing Hearing\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nLocklair argues that he is entitled to a new sentencing hearing even if\r\r\n\r\r\nthis Court holds one of the two aggravating circumstances found by the jury\r\r\n\r\r\nwas properly submitted for its consideration. According to Locklair, Tuggle v.\r\r\n\r\r\nNetherland, 516 U.S. 10, 116 S.Ct. 283, 133 L.Ed.2d 235 (1995) mandates\r\r\n\r\r\nreversal under these circumstances. Because we find that both statutory\r\r\n\r\r\naggravating circumstances were properly submitted to the jury, it is not\r\r\n\r\r\nnecessary to address the Tuggle issue.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCONCLUSION\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not\r\r\n\r\r\nthe result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and that the jury's\r\r\n\r\r\nfinding of aggravating circumstances is supported by the evidence. Further, the\r\r\n\r\r\ndeath penalty is neither excessive nor disproportionate to that imposed in\r\r\n\r\r\nsimilar cases. See State v. Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593, 518 S.E.2d 588 (1999); State\r\r\n\r\r\nv. Humpheries, 325 S.C. 28, 479 S.E.2d 52 (1996); State v. Williams, 321 S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\n327, 468 S.E.2d 626 (1996).

We granted Creditor's petition for a writ of certiorari\r\r\n\r\r\nfollowing the denial by the Court of Appeals of Creditor's petition for rehearing.\r\r\n\r\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appeals' opinion as modified.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFACTS\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBrockbank and his wife, Sharon K. Brockbank, purchased a double\r\r\n\r\r\nwide mobile home from Kahn Development Company in February 1995. Kahn\r\r\n\r\r\nassigned the contract to Creditor. 2\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Agreement for Sale of Manufactured Home (Agreement) states\r\r\n\r\r\nthat Debtor \"may take possession of the property, live in it, and continue in\r\r\n\r\r\npossession while this Agreement remains in effect.\" Debtor agreed to pay taxes\r\r\n\r\r\nand maintain fire insurance coverage, with Creditor named as the loss payee on\r\r\n\r\r\nthe insurance policy. Debtor agreed not to transfer or assign his rights under\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Agreement without Creditor's prior written permission. Debtor agreed not\r\r\n\r\r\nto move the mobile home from the location specified in the Agreement until the\r\r\n\r\r\nloan was paid in full. Debtor agreed to maintain the home in good repair, and\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor retained the right to inspect it at any reasonable time upon reasonable\r\r\n\r\r\nnotice to Debtor.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Agreement further provides that\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[i]f you fail to make payment when due, if you break\r\r\n\r\r\nany promise under this Agreement, or if the prospect of\r\r\n\r\r\npayment is impaired, the seller (\"we\") may declare this\r\r\n\r\r\nAgreement in default and demand that the entire\r\r\n\r\r\nbalance be paid in full.

The total sales price, including the $2,200\r\r\n\r\r\ndownpayment, was $57,978.40. Monthly payments were $309.88.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.352\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBROCKBANK v. BEST CAPITAL CORP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nagainst you, you shall pay all of our expenses of suit\r\r\n\r\r\nand reasonable attorney's fees, not to exceed 15% of the\r\r\n\r\r\nbalance owing under this Agreement.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nUnder a section titled \"Seller's remedies,\" the Agreement states:\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nExcept as provided by law, if you default in making any\r\r\n\r\r\npayment or in performing any other obligation\r\r\n\r\r\nhereunder, we may either bring an action against you\r\r\n\r\r\nfor specific performance, or enforce a forfeiture of your\r\r\n\r\r\ninterest in the manufactured home. If a forfeiture is\r\r\n\r\r\nenforced, you will forfeit all rights and interests in and\r\r\n\r\r\nto the property and appurtenances, and shall\r\r\n\r\r\nimmediately surrender to us peaceable possession of the\r\r\n\r\r\nproperty and forfeit to us, as liquidated damages, all\r\r\n\r\r\npayments made hereunder together with all\r\r\n\r\r\nimprovements placed on or in the property. In no event\r\r\n\r\r\nshall the provisions of this paragraph affect our other\r\r\n\r\r\nlawful rights or remedies against you.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nFinally, the Agreement states that \"[u] pon your performance of all requirements\r\r\n\r\r\nunder this Agreement, including payment of all sums due, we will convey to you\r\r\n\r\r\ngood and marketable title free of all liens to this manufactured home.\"\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDebtor left the marital home in August 1995, but continued to make\r\r\n\r\r\nthe payments until January 1996. The next month, Debtor sued his wife for\r\r\n\r\r\ndivorce and stopped making payments on the marital home. Mrs. Brockbank\r\r\n\r\r\ncould not afford to make the payments on the home and moved out in March\r\r\n\r\r\n1996. Debtor stated in an affidavit that\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[s] ometime in January 1996, I received [Creditor's]\r\r\n\r\r\ndemand letter dated January 18, 1996, wherein\r\r\n\r\r\n[Creditor] demanded payment of the entire outstanding\r\r\n\r\r\nbalance under the sales agreement. I telephoned\r\r\n\r\r\n[Creditor] about the payments on the mobile home. I\r\r\n\r\r\ntold [Creditor] that I would not make monthly\r\r\n\r\r\npayments if I did not have use of the home. I was told\r\r\n\r\r\nthat [Creditor] and my wife were discussing payment\r\r\n\r\r\narrangements.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.353\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBROCKBANK v. BEST CAPITAL CORP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nI did not receive any other information or have any\r\r\n\r\r\nother contact with [Creditor] until after April 28, 1996.\r\r\n\r\r\nOn April 28, 1996, I returned to the mobile home to\r\r\n\r\r\nvisit my family and a stranger appeared at the door.\r\r\n\r\r\nThe stranger told me that she had purchased this\r\r\n\r\r\nmobile home approximately two weeks earlier.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor had resold the home for $19,500.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nDebtor alleged that Creditor was required, pursuant to Article 9 of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe UCC, to provide him with notice of the sale of the mobile home. See S.C.\r\r\n\r\r\nCode Ann. Â§ 36-9-504(3) (Supp. 1999). Debtor moved for partial summary\r\r\n\r\r\njudgment on the issue of liability, asserting a hearing was necessary only to\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermine damages under the formula established in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9\r\r\n\r\r\n507(1) (Supp. 1999).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor counterclaimed, requesting a deficiency judgment and\r\r\n\r\r\nsanctions under the South Carolina Frivolous Civil Proceedings Sanctions Act.\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor admitted it had not sent Debtor or his estranged wife notice of the sale,\r\r\n\r\r\nbut argued that Article 9 applies only to secured transactions and there was no\r\r\n\r\r\nsecurity interest created by the Agreement. Creditor also contended that Debtor\r\r\n\r\r\nwas not entitled to notice because he had abandoned the home and his estranged\r\r\n\r\r\nwife voluntarily had surrendered it to Creditor.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe trial judge granted summary judgment to Creditor. The judge\r\r\n\r\r\nruled the Agreement constituted an unsecured loan and so the default and\r\r\n\r\r\npenalty provisions of Article 9 did not apply to the transaction. The Court of\r\r\n\r\r\nAppeals reversed, finding that the transaction between Debtor and Creditor falls\r\r\n\r\r\nsquarely within the statutory definition of a secured transaction. Based on that\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermination, the Court of Appeals remanded the case for the trial judge to\r\r\n\r\r\ndetermine whether Brockbank's alleged abandonment of the home divested him\r\r\n\r\r\nof his rights under Article 9, including the right to notice of the sale.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nISSUES\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n1.

BEST CAPITAL CORP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAgreement created a security interest in the\r\r\n\r\r\nmobile home?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2.  Did the Court of Appeals err in remanding to the\r\r\n\r\r\nlower court the issue of whether Debtor's\r\r\n\r\r\ndeparture from the home divested him of his\r\r\n\r\r\nrights under Article 9?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3.  Did the trial judge err in finding that Debtor's\r\r\n\r\r\ndeparture from the home divested him of his\r\r\n\r\r\nrights under Article 9?\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment\r\r\n\r\r\nwhen \"the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on\r\r\n\r\r\nfile, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as\r\r\n\r\r\nto any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\r\n\r\r\nmatter of law.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP. Summary judgment is not appropriate when\r\r\n\r\r\nfurther inquiry into the facts of the case is desirable to clarify the application of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe law. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).\r\r\n\r\r\nSummary judgment should not be granted even when there is no dispute as to\r\r\n\r\r\nevidentiary facts if there is dispute as to the conclusion to be drawn from those\r\r\n\r\r\nfacts. Id. In determining whether any triable issues of fact-exist, the court must\r\r\n\r\r\nview the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the\r\r\n\r\r\nevidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party. Manning v.\r\r\n\r\r\nQuinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988).

CREATION OF SECURITY INTEREST 3\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nA mobile home usually is classified as personal property. See City\r\r\n\r\r\nof North Charleston v. Claxton, 315 S.C. 56, 431 S.E.2d 610 (Ct.

Â§ Section 36-2-401; see also Black's Law Dictionary 295 (1990)\r\r\n\r\r\n(defining conditional sales contract).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe Agreement required that Debtor surrender the mobile home to\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor in the event of default, that Debtor name Creditor as the loss payee in\r\r\n\r\r\nthe fire insurance policy, that Debtor could not assign his rights in the home\r\r\n\r\r\nwithout Creditor's prior written permission, that Debtor could not move the\r\r\n\r\r\nhome until repaying the loan in full, that Debtor maintain the home, and that\r\r\n\r\r\nCreditor could inspect it at any reasonable time. These provisions indicate, both\r\r\n\r\r\nobjectively and subjectively, the parties' intent to create a security interest in the\r\r\n\r\r\nmobile home.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n2. NECESSITY OF REMAND\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe trial judge ruled that even if the Agreement created a security\r\r\n\r\r\ninterest, thereby triggering Article 9, Debtor was divested of the Article 9 rights\r\r\n\r\r\nand remedies when he purportedly abandoned the home.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.357\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBROCKBANK v. BEST CAPITAL CORP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nWe agree with the parties that the issue of whether Debtor's alleged\r\r\n\r\r\nabandonment of the home divested him of his Article 9 rights was raised to and\r\r\n\r\r\nruled on by the trial judge. The Court of Appeals erred in remanding the case\r\r\n\r\r\nfor lower court to decide the issue. See Hudson v. Hudson, 290 S.C. 215, 349\r\r\n\r\r\nS.E.2d 341 (1986) (remand is unnecessary where trial court properly found it\r\r\n\r\r\nhad jurisdiction and already had ruled on post-trial motions). Consequently, we\r\r\n\r\r\ndirected the parties to brief the final issue.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n3. NECESSITY OF NOTICE AFTER DEBTOR'S DEPARTURE\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nAs just explained, the trial judge ruled that even if the Agreement\r\r\n\r\r\ncreated a security interest, thereby triggering Article 9, Debtor was divested of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe Article 9 rights and remedies when he \"abandoned\" the mobile home. The\r\r\n\r\r\njudge further ruled that the sale of the home was a consequence of Debtor's\r\r\n\r\r\n\"abandonment\" of the home, and was not pursuant to Debtor's default.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIt is undisputed that Creditor, after taking possession of the mobile\r\r\n\r\r\nhome, did not notify Debtor or his estranged wife before selling the home to\r\r\n\r\r\nanother person. Creditor, however, contends the home was not sold pursuant\r\r\n\r\r\nto Debtor's default because Creditor never exercised its option under the\r\r\n\r\r\nAgreement to declare Debtor to be in default. Article 9's default and damage\r\r\n\r\r\nprovision's were not triggered because the home \"was abandoned by Debtor to\r\r\n\r\r\nMrs. Brockbank, and Mrs. Brockbank voluntarily turned the home over to\r\r\n\r\r\n[Creditor].\" Creditor further asserts notice is not required because Debtor had\r\r\n\r\r\nno equitable financial interest (equity) in the home. We disagree.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nArticle 9 provides that\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n[w]hen a debtor is in default under a security\r\r\n\r\r\nagreement, a secured party has the rights and remedies\r\r\n\r\r\nprovided in this part and except as limited by\r\r\n\r\r\nsubsection (3) those provided in the security agreement.\r\r\n\r\r\nHe may reduce his claim to judgment, foreclosure or\r\r\n\r\r\notherwise enforce the security interest by any available\r\r\n\r\r\njudicial procedure.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-501(1) (Supp. 1999). A secured party \"has on default the\r\r\n\r\r\nright to take possession of the collateral,\" either by judicial action or without\r\r\n\r\r\njudicial process if it can be done without breaching the peace. S.C. Code Ann.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\np.358\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nBROCKBANK v. BEST CAPITAL CORP.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nÂ§ 36-9-503 (Supp. 1999). A secured party \"may sell, lease, or otherwise dispose\r\r\n\r\r\nof any or all of the collateral in its then condition or following any commercially\r\r\n\r\r\nreasonable preparation or processing.\" S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 36-9-504(1) (Supp.\r\r\n\r\r\n1999).\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThese provisions make no distinction between abandonment and\r\r\n\r\r\ndefault. They make no distinction between whether the creditor acquired\r\r\n\r\r\npossession of the collateral before or after default, or by the debtor's voluntary\r\r\n\r\r\nreturn of the collateral, or by a declaration of default and repossession, or by\r\r\n\r\r\nabandonment, or otherwise. Similarly, the provisions make no distinction\r\r\n\r\r\nbetween situations in which a debtor has equity in the collateral and when he\r\r\n\r\r\nor she does not.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe UCC does not define \"default.\" In a typical secured transaction\r\r\n\r\r\nsuch as this one, \"default\" is a state of being as defined under the terms of the\r\r\n\r\r\nparties' agreement. Debtor, in failing to make the payments when due, was in\r\r\n\r\r\ndefault under the plain terms of the Agreement. Creditor at that point could\r\r\n\r\r\nexercise the rights and remedies available to it under Article 9, absent a\r\r\n\r\r\ncontrary provision in the parties' agreement. It was not necessary for Creditor\r\r\n\r\r\nto expressly \"declare\" Debtor to be in default in order to bring the Article 9 rights\r\r\n\r\r\nand remedies into play. See McGrady v. Nissan Motor Acceptance Corp., 40 F.\r\r\n\r\r\nSupp. 2d 1323,1331(M.D. Ala. 1998) (plaintiff was in default on automobile loan\r\r\n\r\r\nwhere plaintiff had failed to make monthly payment and contract stated that a\r\r\n\r\r\ndefault occurs when a party fails to make payment when due); Chrysler Credit\r\r\n\r\r\nCorp. v. B.J.M., Jr., Inc., 834 F. Supp. 813, 831-32 (E.D. Pa. 1993) (noting that\r\r\n\r\r\nUCC is silent on what constitutes default; generally speaking, upon default of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe debtor, Article 9 allows the secured party who acts in good faith to obtain a\r\r\n\r\r\njudgment on the debt, repossess and sell the collateral, or repossess and retain\r\r\n\r\r\nthe collateral in satisfaction of the debt). We decline to interpret Article 9 in a\r\r\n\r\r\nmanner that would allow a creditor to sidestep the applicability of the notice\r\r\n\r\r\nprovision by asserting it has the unilateral power to declare a state of default.\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nIn exercising its rights, Creditor was required to scrupulously\r\r\n\r\r\nadhere to procedures contained in Article 9.

Enterprise Ford Tractor, 480 S.E.2d 497, 500 (Va. 1997) (\"when a default\r\r\n\r\r\noccurs, a secured creditor is required to comply with Article 9 of the UCC in\r\r\n\r\r\ntaking possession and selling the secured property\"); Comer v.

Unless collateral is perishable or threatens\r\r\n\r\r\nto decline speedily in value or is of a type customarily\r\r\n\r\r\nsold on a recognized market, reasonable notification of\r\r\n\r\r\nthe time and place of any public sale or reasonable\r\r\n\r\r\nnotification of the time after which any private sale or\r\r\n\r\r\nother intended disposition is to be made must be sent\r\r\n\r\r\nby the secured party to the debtor, if he has not signed\r\r\n\r\r\nafter default a statement renouncing or modifying his\r\r\n\r\r\nright to notification of sale. (Emphasis added.)\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\n\r\r\nThe 1988 amendment to this subsection \"makes it explicitly clear\r\r\n\r\r\nthat the right of a debtor to renounce or modify his right to notice can only be\r\r\n\r\r\nmade after, but not before, default.\" Note 1 of South Carolina Reporter's Notes\r\r\n\r\r\nto section 36-9-504; Act No. 494, Part 5, 1988 S.C. Acts 4449. This Article 9\r\r\n\r\r\nprovision allows a debtor to waive his right to notice only by executing a written\r\r\n\r\r\nstatement after default which is signed by the debtor.
