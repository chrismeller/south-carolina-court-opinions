Department of Probation, Parole &amp; Pardon Services, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  Petitioner pled guilty to assault and battery of a high and\r\n  aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  He was\r\n  sentenced to ten yearsâ€™ imprisonment, suspended upon time served and five\r\n  yearsâ€™ probation.Â  He was also required\r\n  to register under the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed his conviction\r\n  and sentence.Â  State v. Hicks, 377\r\n  S.C. 322, 659 S.E.2d 499 (Ct. App. 2008).\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  petitionerâ€™s probation was revoked, and ninety days of his sentence was\r\n  reinstated, after which probation was to be reinstated.Â  Additionally, Sex Offender Conditions\r\n  promulgated by the South Carolina Department of Probation, Pardon and Parole\r\n  Services (DPPPS) were added as a condition of petitionerâ€™s probation.Â  Petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals;\r\n  however, he challenged only one of the three conditions the probation\r\n  revocation judge found he violated.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals addressed the merits of petitionerâ€™s arguments and affirmed\r\n  the revocation and the addition of conditions.Â  State v. Hicks, 382 S.C. 370, 675 S.E.2d 769 (Ct. App. 2009). \r\nPetitioner has now filed a\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari in which he makes the same arguments he made\r\n  to the Court of Appeals.Â  We deny the petition as to Questions 2 and 3, but grant the\r\n  petition as to Question 1 and dispense with further briefing. Â \r\nWhere the ruling of a trial\r\n  judge is based on more than one ground, an appellate court must affirm unless the\r\n  appellant appeals all grounds upon which the ruling was based.Â  Anderson v.

Roper Hospital, Inc., 377 S.C. 503, 661 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We reverse\r\n  the decision of the court of appeals and reinstate the trial court's order\r\n  granting summary judgment to Dr. Smith. \r\nI.\r\nShortly\r\n  after Jamia Hoard was born at Roper Hospital in Charleston, South Carolina on\r\n  March 30, 2002, she developed respiratory distress and was transferred from the\r\n  Level 1 newborn nursery to the Level 2 nursery.Â  Jamia's treating physician was\r\n  Marshall Goldstein, M.D., a board-certified neonatologist.Â  Dr. Goldstein\r\n  determined it was necessary for Jamia to have a peripheral intravenous line\r\n  (IV) for infusion of medications and fluids and for withdrawal of blood for\r\n  testing.Â  After nurses were unable to place the IV, Dr. Goldstein ordered\r\n  pediatric nurse practitioner Karen Johnson to insert an umbilical vein catheter\r\n  (UVC).[1]Â  \r\nA\r\n  chest X-ray was taken prior to insertion of the UVC.Â  Johnson initially\r\n  advanced the UVC to a depth of 11 to 13 centimeters.Â  Because the UVC was not\r\n  drawing blood, Johnson inserted it deeper into Jamia's chest.Â  A second X-ray\r\n  was made to confirm whether the UVC was placed properly.Â  When Johnson read the\r\n  second X-ray, she did not observe a problem with the UVC placement. Â The X-rays\r\n  were sent to the radiology department for review by a radiologist. \r\nThe\r\n  next morning, the on-call radiologist, Robert Smith, M.D., read Jamia's X-rays.Â \r\n  Dr. Smith's written report stated: &quot;An umbilical vein catheter has been\r\n  placed.Â  The tip terminates high within the right atrium. Â There are persistent\r\n  bilateral coarse infiltrates essentially unchanged compared with the prior\r\n  exam.Â  No pneumothorax is seen.&quot;Â  At 10:34 a.m., Dr. Smith sent the X-rays\r\n  and his report to the nursery.\r\nWhen\r\n  Dr. Goldstein made rounds that afternoon at 2:00 p.m., he examined Jamia,\r\n  reviewed her lab results and X-rays, and read Dr. Smith's radiology report. Â Following\r\n  this examination, Dr. Goldstein wrote a note in Jamia's chart in which he stated\r\n  the UVC was placed &quot;in approximately [the] right atrium.&quot; \r\nAt approximately\r\n  4:00 a.m. the next day, April 1, Jamia went into cardiac arrest.Â  The nursing\r\n  staff called Dr. Goldstein, who instructed staff to pull the UVC back and to\r\n  transfer Jamia immediately to the Level 3 nursery at the Medical University of\r\n  South Carolina (MUSC).[2]Â  At MUSC, neonatologists\r\n  determined Jamia was experiencing &quot;cardiac tamponade,&quot; a potentially\r\n  fatal syndrome.[3] \r\nIn\r\n  her deposition, neonatologist Anne Hansen, M.D. explained that the tip of the\r\n  UVC slowly eroded the wall of the right atrium.Â  Hansen explained that the\r\n  fluid, which was being infused on a continuous basis, was filling the\r\n  pericardial sac instead of going into the bloodstream. Â Ultimately, the volume\r\n  of fluid surrounding the heart rendered it unable to properly expand and\r\n  contract. Â Hansen described the process that led to Jamia's cardiac arrest:\r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  fluid actually [comes] out of the tip of the [UVC] causing a perforation\r\n  through the atrium wall and then this fluid filling up this potential space\r\n  between the pericardial sac and the [heart] muscle.Â  . . .Â  So here is this\r\n  line with intravenous fluid coming through.Â  [B]etween the plastic itself and\r\n  the fluid eroding, eroding, eroding until it erodes all the way through the\r\n  [heart] muscle wall.Â  And then it accumulates and pushes this sac away and\r\n  pushes the heart muscle in and causes a pressure build up all the way around\r\n  the heart.\r\n\t. . . . \r\n\t[T]he\r\n  effects of this tamponade situation were severe enough that . . . it actually\r\n  perfused the heart muscle where it was so poor that the muscle itself stopped\r\n  working.\r\n\r\nJamia and her parents (the Hoards) filed professional\r\n  malpractice actions against Drs. Smith and Goldstein, Roper Hospital, and Karen Johnson, alleging their actions or omissions caused Jamia to experience cardiac\r\n  arrest, which in turn caused her to suffer brain damage and partial paralysis. Â All\r\n  defendants, except Dr. Smith, settled with the Hoards.Â  Dr. Smith moved the\r\n  trial court for summary judgment, contending no evidence was presented to\r\n  suggest that his alleged negligence was the proximate cause of Jamia's injury.Â Â  \r\nThe Hoards contended at summary judgment that Jamia's injuries\r\n  were caused by the improper insertion of the UVC.Â  They additionally asserted\r\n  Jamia may not have suffered cardiac arrest if Dr. Smith had contacted the\r\n  nursery after he read the X-rays at 10:34 a.m. or had stated in his written\r\n  report that the UVC was &quot;malpositioned.&quot; Â Four expert witnesses testified regarding the standard\r\n  of care applicable to radiologists and neonatologists.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  trial court initially determined the evidence presented a question of fact\r\n  regarding Dr. Smith's alleged negligence in failing to clearly indicate that the\r\n  UVC was &quot;malpositioned&quot; or other term of similar import.Â  Summary\r\n  judgment was granted, however, as the trial court held that &quot;[t]he\r\n  Plaintiffs' case against Dr. Smith fails\r\n  because there was no proximate causation between Dr. Smith's alleged negligence\r\n  and the injury to Jamia Hoard.&quot;Â  The Hoards\r\n  appealed. \r\nOn appeal, Jamia's parents asserted: &quot;It is hornbook\r\n  law that a jury is the judge of the credibility of a witness and may disregard\r\n  all or part of a witness's testimony.&quot; Â The court of appeals agreed with\r\n  this position and reversed the grant of summary judgment.Â  We accepted Dr. Smith's petition for certiorari to\r\n  review the court of appeals decision.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThis\r\n  case turns on whether there is any evidence that Dr. Smith's alleged negligence\r\n  was a proximate cause of the injury.Â  The trial court found no evidence that\r\n  Dr. Smith's alleged failure to act within the established standard of care\r\n  proximately caused Jamia's cardiac arrest.Â  The trial court's finding was based\r\n  on the fact that, approximately fourteen hours before Jamia experienced cardiac\r\n  arrest, her treating physician, Dr. Goldstein, made a clinical judgment not to\r\n  reposition the UVC.Â  Dr. Goldstein made this decision well aware that the\r\n  placement of the UVC was elevated in the atrium, not &quot;optimal&quot; and\r\n  outside the standard of care.[4]\r\nDr.\r\n  Goldstein considered repositioning the UVC, but decided\r\n  the risks outweighed the potential advantages.Â  Dr. Goldstein was concerned\r\n  that if he withdrew or repositioned the UVC twenty-two hours after it was placed,\r\n  withdrawal of the line could dislodge a blood clot and cause additional\r\n  problems. Â Moreover, it was Dr. Goldstein's assessment that Jamia was improving\r\n  and the only indication of a problem with the UVC was Dr. Smith's report. Â Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  reversing the trial court's order, the court of appeals\r\n  held &quot;a jury could have chosen not to believe Dr. Goldstein's testimony.Â \r\n  Simply because testimony is uncontradicted does not render it\r\n  undisputed.&quot;Â  Hoard, 377 S.C. at 510, 661 S.E.2d at 117.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals therefore concluded the trial court had erred in granting\r\n  summary judgment to Dr. Smith on the question of proximate cause because a jury\r\n  would be free not to believe Dr. Goldstein.\r\nA.\r\nSummary Judgment\r\nSummary\r\n  judgment is a drastic remedy and should be cautiously invoked so that a\r\n  litigant will not be improperly deprived of trial on disputed factual issues.Â  Cunningham\r\n    ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003). Â &quot;The\r\n  purpose of summary judgment is to expedite the disposition of cases which do\r\n  not require the services of a fact finder.&quot; Â Singleton v. Sherer,\r\n  377 S.C. 185, 659 S.E.2d 196 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  Summary judgment is properly\r\n  granted when: \r\n\r\n\t[T]he\r\n  pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file,\r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\n  any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a\r\n  matter of law. Â \r\n\r\nRule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP.\r\nWhen reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion,\r\n  this court applies the same standard which governs the trial court under Rule\r\n  56(c), SCRCP, and summary judgment is proper only when there is no genuine\r\n  issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a\r\n  matter of law.Â  Fleming v.\r\n    Rose, 350 S.C.\r\n  488, 493, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002). Â \r\n\r\nB.\r\nProximate Cause\r\nA plaintiff alleging medical malpractice must provide\r\n  evidence showing: (1) the generally recognized and accepted practices and\r\n  procedures that would be followed by the average, competent physician in the\r\n  defendant's field of medicine under the same or similar circumstances, and (2)\r\n  the defendant departed from the recognized and generally accepted standards. Â Jones v. Doe, 372 S.C. 53, 61, 640 S.E.2d 514, 518 (Ct. App. 2006). Â Additionally, the\r\n  plaintiff must demonstrate the defendant's departure from such generally\r\n  recognized practices and procedures proximately caused the plaintiff's alleged\r\n  injuries and damages. Â David v. McLeod Regl. Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242,\r\n  248, 626 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006).Â  \r\n&quot;In\r\n  a medical malpractice action, it is incumbent on the plaintiff to establish\r\n  proximate cause as well as the negligence of the physician.&quot; Â Ellis v.\r\n    Oliver, 323 S.C. 121, 125, 473 S.E.2d 793, 795 (1996) (citing Armstrong\r\n      v. Weiland, 267 S.C. 12, 225 S.E.2d 851 (1976)). Â &quot;When one relies solely upon the\r\n  opinion of medical experts to establish a causal connection between the alleged\r\n  negligence and the injury, the experts must, with reasonable certainty, state\r\n  that in their professional opinion, the injuries complained of most probably\r\n  resulted from the defendant's negligence.&quot; Â Id. at 125, 473 S.E.2d at\r\n  795.Â  When expert testimony is the only evidence of proximate cause relied\r\n  upon, the testimony &quot;must provide a significant causal link between the\r\n  alleged negligence and the plaintiff's injuries, rather than a tenuous and hypothetical connection.&quot;Â  Id. at 125, 473 S.E.2d at 795.Â  \r\n&quot;Negligence\r\n  is not actionable unless it is a proximate cause of the injuries, and it may be deemed a proximate cause only when without such negligence the\r\n  injury would not have occurred or could have been avoided.&quot; Â Hughes v.\r\n    Children's Clinic, P. A., 269 S.C. 389, 398, 237 S.E.2d 753, 757 (1977)\r\n  (citing Gunnels v. Roach, 243 S.C. 248, 133 S.E.2d 757 (1963)).Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn his motion for summary judgment, Dr. Smith\r\n  presented evidence that Dr. Goldstein read the radiology report and reviewed\r\n  the X-rays on the afternoon of March 31 and knew the UVC was not optimally\r\n  placed.Â  It was Dr. Goldstein's judgment that, as described above, removing the\r\n  UVC presented greater risk to Jamia than leaving it in place.Â  Well aware that\r\n  the UVC was not optimally placed, Dr. Goldstein made a knowing judgment not to\r\n  move the line.Â  Fourteen hours later, Jamia experienced cardiac arrest.\r\nThe\r\n  Hoards presented the deposition testimony of several experts.Â  Dr. Anne Hansen, a\r\n  neonatologist, testified for the Hoards. Â According to Dr. Hansen, if Dr.\r\n  Goldstein had repositioned the UVC on March 31, Jamia would have been fine.Â  Dr.\r\n  Hansen stated that, in her practice, when an x-ray shows the UVC is in the\r\n  right atrium, &quot;we pull those lines back as soon as we find out and those\r\n  babies are all fine.&quot;Â  Dr.\r\n  Hansen was asked: &quot;Is there anything in [Dr. Goldstein's] admission note\r\n  at 2:00 p.m. on the 31st of March that would justify a clinical decision by him\r\n  to leave the UVC in the position he notes there?&quot;Â  She responded:\r\n  &quot;No.&quot;Â  Hansen testified that Jamia's blood pressure reading at 2:00\r\n  p.m. on March 31 indicated there was &quot;no tamponade going on at that\r\n  point.&quot;Â  Dr. Hansen explained: \r\n\r\n\t[T]here was probably slow erosion of the inner wall of\r\n  the right atrium, but it had not happened to the extent that there was actually\r\n  erosion through into the pericardial space at this point.Â  So if they had\r\n  pulled this line out on the 31st at 2:00 p.m., the baby would have been fine.\r\n\r\nDr.\r\n  Smith correctly contends the record fails to establish that a genuine question\r\n  of material fact exists regarding whether his alleged failure to act within the\r\n  standard of care could have been a proximate cause of Jamia's cardiac arrest\r\n  and subsequent injuries.Â  This is so because the record demonstrates that Dr. Goldstein\r\n  was aware of the standard of care concerning UVC placement and he made an\r\n  intentional and independent decision not to move the UVC based on numerous\r\n  factors.Â  We further observe that Dr. Goldstein had on other occasions moved\r\n  catheter lines that were not optimally placed.\r\nThe\r\n  Hoards counter that the court of appeals properly reversed the grant of summary\r\n  judgment because the evidence established a question of fact regarding the\r\n  element of proximate cause.Â  In making this argument, they contend it is\r\n  possible that Dr. Goldstein gave false testimony and did not actually know the\r\n  standard of care.Â  Therefore, if Dr. Smith had been clearer in his report or\r\n  had orally communicated his findings, then Dr. Goldstein may have been alerted\r\n  to the &quot;malposition&quot; of the UVC and may have repositioned it.Â  We\r\n  reject this &quot;speculative hypothetical.&quot;Â  David v. McLeod Regl.\r\n    Med. Ctr., 367 S.C. 242, 249, 626 S.E.2d 1, 4 (2006) (rejecting\r\n  &quot;speculative hypothetical[s]&quot; and holding: &quot;In South Carolina, medical\r\n  malpractice actions require a greater showing than generic allegations and conjecture.&quot;).\r\nWe\r\n  turn to the standard relied on by the court of appeals, in which it adopted the\r\n  Hoards' position that &quot;a jury could have disregarded Dr. Goldstein's\r\n  testimony and found Dr. Smith's failure to alert Dr. Goldstein of the line's\r\n  position was a proximate cause of Jamia's injuries.Â  . . .Â  Simply because testimony is uncontradicted does not render it\r\n  undisputed.&quot;Â  Hoard, 377 S.C. at 509-10, 661 S.E.2d at 116-17.Â \r\n  A jury's prerogative to disregard uncontradicted testimony is a sound principle\r\n  of law, but it has no application in a summary judgment setting.\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals relied upon Black v. Hodge, 306 S.C. 196, 198, 410\r\n  S.E.2d 595, 596 (Ct. App. 1991) and Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 434,\r\n  532 S.E.2d 612, 615 (Ct. App. 2000).Â  In Black, the court of appeals affirmed\r\n  a jury verdict for Respondent Hodge despite Black's contention on appeal that\r\n  the jury was required to accept her uncontradicted testimony.Â  306 S.C. at 198, 410 S.E.2d at 596.Â  There, the court of appeals' decision correctly\r\n  stated that a jury is not required to accept uncontradicted witness testimony,\r\n  as credibility is a question for the jury.Â  Id.Â  Likewise, in Ross,\r\n  on appeal from a jury verdict, the court of appeals found issues concerning\r\n  witness credibility were properly resolved by the jury.Â  340 S.C. at 434, 532\r\n  S.E.2d at 615.Â  The principle enunciated in Black and Ross is\r\n  sound.\r\nOne\r\n  may not, however, avoid summary judgment by asserting that a jury may\r\n  disbelieve uncontradicted evidence.Â  This argument, if accepted, would render\r\n  summary judgment obsolete, and it is in any event at odds with Rule 56, SCRCP,\r\n  and our summary judgment jurisprudence:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[R]ule 56(e), SCRCP,\r\n  requires that when a motion for summary judgment is made and supported as provided\r\n  by the rule, an adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations or denials\r\n  of his pleadings. Â The adverse party's response, including affidavits or as\r\n  otherwise provided by the rule, must set forth specific facts showing there is\r\n  a genuine issue for trial.\r\n\r\nSSI Med.

Â S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5.Â  We vacate the ALC's\r\n  discovery orders and remand.[1]\r\nI.\r\nThe parties in this case are fiercely\r\n  competitive healthcare providers in upstate South Carolina.Â  The primary parties, Petitioner Oncology and Hematology Associates\r\n  of South Carolina, d/b/a Cancer Centers of the Carolinas (CCC), and Respondent\r\n  Spartanburg Regional Healthcare System (SRHS), are licensed to provide linear\r\n  accelerator[2] services in adjoining service areas.[3]Â \r\n  CCC is a private physician group, and SRHS is a public entity.Â  CCC and SRHS\r\n  compete with each other primarily for cancer patients who reside in proximity\r\n  to the Greenville-Spartanburg County line.Â  The underlying dispute concerns CCC\r\n  and SRHS vying for cancer patients in Greer, South Carolina.Â  Part of Greer is located in Spartanburg County and\r\n  part of Greer is located in Greenville County.\r\nIn August 2007, SRHS submitted a Certificate of Need (CON)\r\n  application to the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental\r\n  Control (DHEC) asking to relocate one of its linear accelerators from the Gibbs Regional Cancer Center in Spartanburg to its\r\n  Village of Pelham Cancer Center in Greer. Â The Village of Pelham is located on\r\n  the Spartanburg County side of Greer.Â  Four miles away, CCC operates a linear\r\n  accelerator at the Greenville Hospital System (GHS) facility on the Greenville County\r\n  side of Greer. Â \r\nThe Greer community is viewed as fertile territory for\r\n  providing treatment to cancer patients.Â  Both CCC and SRHS seek to maximize utilization\r\n  of their respective linear accelerators in the Greer community.Â  Despite CCC's\r\n  protest, DHEC staff recommended approval of SRHS's\r\n  request to relocate one of its linear accelerators from the Gibbs Regional Cancer Center to Greer.Â  The DHEC Board\r\n  approved the staff's recommendation and granted the CON to SRHS.[4]\r\nCCC requested a contested case hearing before the\r\n  ALC to challenge DHEC's approval of the CON.[5]Â \r\n  In its petition, CCC contended SRHS's application to relocate its linear\r\n  accelerator, and DHEC's review process, had failed to address significant\r\n  criteria required by the 2004-2005 South Carolina Health Plan.Â  CCC asserted:\r\n  &quot;The DHEC Board similarly erred by failing to grant CCC's request for\r\n  final Board review and [to] reverse DHEC Staff's approval letter for SRHS's CON\r\n  application.&quot;Â  CCC unsuccessfully sought to vacate the CON and to remand the\r\n  matter to DHEC.Â  \r\nSRHS responded to CCC's challenge by inundating it with\r\n  discovery requests.[6]Â \r\n  Rather than tailoring discovery to the challenged CON, which addressed only the\r\n  relocation of a linear accelerator to the Greer location, SRHS took a shotgun\r\n  approach and sought virtually all information concerning every facet of CCC's\r\n  operation.Â  The following is a sampling of the information SRHS sought from CCC\r\n  by way of requests for production (RFP) and interrogatories: \r\n\r\n\tRFP 6: Produce all business plans, pro formas, market analyses,\r\n  strategic plans, and projections and/or forecasts of any kind for all of CCC's locations\r\n  in the Anderson, Greenville, Cherokee, Oconee, Union, Pickens, and Spartanburg\r\n  County areas from 2006 forward.

CCC and [GHS] and/or\r\n  any entity affiliated with [GHS].\r\n\t\te.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; USO and [GHS] and/or any entity affiliated\r\n  with [GHS].\r\n\t\tf.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; CCC and any other individual or entity\r\n  related to the provision of linear accelerator services.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tInterrogatory 29: Provide the number of patients treated\r\n  with linear accelerators owned, operated, leased, and/or in any way connected\r\n  to CCC for calendar years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, and 2009 to date by linear\r\n  accelerator.\r\n\r\nCCC responded to some discovery requests and produced\r\n  voluminous information and documentation to SRHS.Â  As to the discovery requests\r\n  CCC found objectionable, it contended the information sought was overbroad, overly burdensome, protected by\r\n  work-product doctrine, or irrelevant to the pending matter.Â  CCC additionally asserted\r\n  that it would be harmed competitively if required to provide SRHS with\r\n  confidential information that revealed contracts and rates it had negotiated\r\n  with other organizations.Â  Moreover, CCC maintained that the presence of a\r\n  protective order did not transform irrelevant material into relevant material.\r\nSRHS moved the ALC to compel CCC to fully respond to its discovery\r\n  requests.Â  SRHS contended that &quot;each of the contested interrogatories . .\r\n  . identify subjects that are relevant and necessary for [SRHS] to explore in\r\n  order to assess the merits of this litigation.&quot; Â CCC provided\r\n  supplemental responses to SRHS's discovery requests, and again contended it had\r\n  furnished reasonable and complete responses.Â  CCC asked the ALC to deny SRHS's motion to compel further discovery, stating:\r\n\r\n\tWhile\r\n  CCC acknowledges the scope of discovery is generally broad, in the instant case\r\n  both SRHS and the Court itself have taken positions, which clearly impose\r\n  limitations on the discovery propounded by SRHS for which it now seeks to\r\n  compel provision of additional responses and information from CCC.Â  CCC takes\r\n  very seriously proper discovery in an administrative contested case for\r\n  development of issues, and CCC is concerned about and objects to SRHS's\r\n  tactics.Â  \r\n\tSRHS\r\n  is intentionally over-reaching and attempting to game the contested case\r\n  proceeding before the Court herein in order to further its own goals of\r\n  damaging CCC as a competitor and of expanding its competitive market influence\r\n  in physician referrals and provision of radiation and medical oncology services\r\n  in Upstate South Carolina.Â  Such actions are extremely inappropriate.Â  CCC\r\n  is confident the Court will readily agree and not permit SRHS to abuse the\r\n  process.Â  (Emphasis added).\r\n\r\nAt the hearing on SRHS's motion to compel\r\n  discovery, SRHS complained about CCC's meddling efforts to challenge the CON\r\n  for, as the ALC put it, &quot;just moving one machine to a different\r\n  place.&quot;\r\n\r\n\tThe Court:Â  You're saying in other words they asked\r\n  for it?\r\n\t[SRHS]:Â  That's right.Â  Yeah.Â  Yeah.Â  And there's a cost to\r\n  jumping in and that's part of the cost.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ALC referred to SRHS's discovery requests as a\r\n  &quot;fishing expedition,&quot; the ALC ultimately granted SRHS's motion to\r\n  compel.Â  \r\nFollowing the hearing, but prior to the\r\n  issuance of the order, SRHS served USO with a subpoena duces tecum requesting\r\n  documents related to its relationship with GHS and CCC.Â  Thereafter, USO moved\r\n  to intervene for the limited purpose of addressing the discovery matters before\r\n  the ALC.Â  The ALC conducted another hearing, after which it issued five orders: (1) order denying CCC's motion to quash the\r\n  subpoena served on GHS; (2) order denying USO's and CCC's motions to quash the\r\n  subpoena served on USO; (3) order denying CCC's\r\n  motion for reconsideration of the ALC's prior discovery rulings; (4) order granting USO's request to intervene for the\r\n  limited purpose of challenging the discovery orders; and (5) order compelling CCC\r\n  to respond to SRHS's first and second interrogatories and requests for production.Â  \r\nThe ALC's order explained: &quot;I find\r\n  these materials to be well within the generally recognized parameters of Rule\r\n  26(b) in that the requests are reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery\r\n  of admissible evidence.&quot;Â  Moreover, the\r\n  ALC found the confidentiality order already in place protected CCC from the misappropriation\r\n  of confidential information by SRHS.\r\nThis case concerns the five interlocutory orders\r\n  issued by the ALC. \r\n\r\nII.\r\n&quot;The Supreme Court shall have power to issue\r\n  writs or orders of injunction, mandamus, quo warranto, prohibition, \r\ncertiorari, habeas corpus, and other original and remedial writs.&quot;&nbsp; S.C. \r\nConst. art. V, Â§ 5. &nbsp;&quot;A trial judge's rulings on discovery matters will not be\r\n  disturbed by an appellate court absent a clear abuse of discretion.&quot;\r\n  Â Hollman v. Woolfson, 384 S.C. 571, 577, 683 S.E.2d 495, 498 (2009) (citing Dunn v. Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 381 S.E.2d 734 (1989)).Â  &quot;A writ of\r\n  certiorari may be issued to review a discovery order where exceptional\r\n  circumstances exist.&quot;Â  Id. at 577, 683 S.E.2d at 498 (citing Laffitte\r\n    v. Bridgestone Corp., 381 S.C. 460, 674 S.E.2d 154 (2009)).Â  Exceptional\r\n  circumstances exist in this challenge to the ALC's discovery orders.\r\nIII.\r\nCCC contends the information and documents required\r\n  under the discovery orders are not remotely relevant to resolution of the issue\r\n  before the ALC.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWe are keenly aware that the scope of discovery is\r\n  broad. Â Rule 26(b)(1), SCRCP, provides:\r\n\r\n\tParties may obtain discovery regarding any matter, not\r\n  privileged, which is relevant to the subject matter involved in the pending\r\n  action . . . [and] [i]t is not ground for objection that the information sought\r\n  will be inadmissible at the trial if the information sought appears reasonably\r\n  calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.\r\n\r\nYet,\r\n  there are limits, which we see trial courts generally unwilling to recognize\r\n  and enforce.Â  SRHS's discovery requests of CCC and its business partners are abusive\r\n  and beyond the pale.Â  \r\nOur willingness to review a discovery order by way of\r\n  a writ of certiorari will be as rare as the proverbial &quot;hen's tooth.&quot;\r\n  Â We have no desire to micromanage discovery orders.Â  It is our hope that in\r\n  resolving this matter, we will speak to trial courts generally.Â  While\r\n  discovery serves as an important tool in the truth-seeking function of our\r\n  legal system, we are concerned that &quot;discovery practice&quot; has become a\r\n  cottage industry and the merits of a claim are being relegated to a secondary\r\n  status.Â  Â Â \r\nWe find persuasive a decision of the Texas Supreme\r\n  Court in a similar situation.Â  See In re CSX Corp., 124 S.W.3d\r\n  149 (2003).Â  The Texas Supreme Court granted a party mandamus relief from\r\n  discovery requests the court determined were overly broad and irrelevant to\r\n  resolution of the dispute at hand:Â  \r\n\r\n\tGenerally, the scope of discovery is within the trial\r\n  court's discretion. Â However, the trial court must make an effort to impose\r\n  reasonable discovery limits. Â The trial court abuses its discretion by ordering\r\n  discovery that exceeds that permitted by the rules of procedure. Â \r\n\tOur\r\n  procedural rules define the general scope of discovery as any unprivileged\r\n  information that is relevant to the subject of the action, even if it would be\r\n  inadmissible at trial, as long as the information sought is 'reasonably\r\n  calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.' Â . . .Â  Although\r\n  the scope of discovery is broad, requests must show a reasonable expectation of\r\n  obtaining information that will aid the dispute's resolution. Â Thus, discovery\r\n  requests must be 'reasonably tailored' to include only relevant matters.\r\n\r\nId. at 152\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  After finding the trial court had abused its\r\n  discretion by issuing an overly broad discovery order, the trial court order\r\n  compelling discovery was vacated.Â  Id. at 153. Â \r\nIn this case, the ALC correctly identified\r\n  the &quot;central issue&quot; in the case before it, i.e., whether the\r\n  2004-2005 South Carolina Health Plan standards applied to the relocation of SRHS's\r\n  linear accelerator.Â  SRHS contends the standards applied only to the addition,\r\n  and not the relocation, of a linear accelerator.Â  CCC contends otherwise.Â  Â \r\nSRHS's discovery requests are not remotely\r\n  relevant to a resolution of the issue concerning the relocation of the linear\r\n  accelerator.Â  A challenge to relocation of the linear accelerator does not\r\n  entitle SRHS to the information it seeks from CCC and affiliated entities.Â  SRHS\r\n  abused the discovery process with its scorched-earth approach. \r\nWe decline to rewrite and narrowly tailor\r\n  SRHS's oppressive discovery requests so as to make them proper.Â  That would\r\n  reward improper conduct.Â  Where, as here, a party abuses discovery, the proper\r\n  remedy is to vacate the requests and require the party to start over.Â  As a\r\n  result, we vacate the five discovery orders before us.Â  \r\nIV.\r\nWe vacate all discovery orders and remand\r\n  for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[8] \r\nVACATED AND REMANDED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, HEARN, JJ., and\r\n  Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; In challenging the discovery orders, Petitioners initially combined their writ of\r\n  certiorari with a writ of supersedeas and a notice of appeal.Â  We dismissed the\r\n  notice of appeal from the discovery orders as interlocutory and not immediately\r\n  appealable.Â  We determined exceptional circumstances existed, warranting the\r\n  grant of a writ of certiorari.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; A linear accelerator is used by radiation oncologists to provide\r\n  external radiation treatments to cancer patients. \r\n[3]&nbsp; CCC is licensed by DHEC to provide linear accelerator services in the\r\n  service area that includes Greenville, Pickens, and Oconee Counties, while SRHS\r\n  is licensed to provide linear accelerator services in the adjoining service\r\n  area comprised of Spartanburg, Cherokee, and Union Counties.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; DHEC staff found SRHS had established that\r\n  the relocation of its linear accelerator would serve its current patient\r\n  population, provide a more convenient location for existing patients, and\r\n  relocation was financially viable.Â  DHEC additionally determined that SRHS's proposed relocation would not adversely\r\n  affect other facilities in the service area.Â  \r\n[5]&nbsp; DHEC takes no position on CCC's challenge to the ALC's discovery orders.\r\n  Â \r\n[6]&nbsp; Likewise, CCC served SRHS with discovery\r\n  requests.Â  There is no issue before us concerning CCC's discovery requests.Â  \r\n[7]&nbsp; USO is an entity affiliated with CCC.Â  Because of the reach of SRHS's\r\n  discovery requests, USO has intervened in this matter.\r\n[8]&nbsp; We are vacating all discovery orders, including those impacting GHS and\r\n  USO.Â  If the ALC determines that SRHS's discovery may properly reach entities\r\n  affiliated with CCC, or that an affiliated entity should be permitted\r\n  intervenor status, it will be done on a clean slate.Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26815","title":"In the Matter of Roger Paul Roy, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26815","description":"In this attorney disciplinary matter, Roger P.

Watson, III, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  This attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter arises out of Roger Paul Roy, Jr.'s (Respondent) management of his trust\r\n  account and handling of his personal refinance loan closing.Â  The Hearing\r\n  Panel (the Panel) recommended Respondent be publicly reprimanded for his\r\n  misconduct and assessed the costs of the proceedings.Â  Both the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (the ODC) and Respondent object to the Panel's\r\n  recommendation.Â  However, we agree with the Panel's recommendation.Â Â  \r\n\r\nFacts/Procedural Background\r\nRespondent's law\r\n  practice handles a relatively large amount of real estate transactions, in\r\n  addition to other matters.Â  On October 19, 2006, Respondent refinanced the\r\n  mortgage on his home and handled the closing himself.Â  \r\nWhile negotiating\r\n  the refinance, Respondent obtained a payoff amount over the telephone from the\r\n  original lender.Â  This oral payoff amount did not include a prepayment\r\n  penalty.Â  A written payoff statement was sent, but did not arrive until after\r\n  the closing.Â  Thus, Respondent closed his refinance loan without a written\r\n  payoff statement from the original lender.Â  In total, approximately $658,000\r\n  was received from the refinance lender and deposited into Respondent's trust\r\n  account.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 24, 2006, checks were distributed from the trust account:Â  $492,119.42\r\n  to pay off the original lender's mortgage; $63,324.45 to pay off what appears to\r\n  be an additional prior mortgage with the refinance lender; $98,516.57 was\r\n  excess cash to close and was paid to Respondent and his wife; the remaining\r\n  several thousand dollars were disbursed by checks written to cover various fees\r\n  and costs associated with the closing.Â  The $492,119.42 check to the original\r\n  lender was rejected because it did not include a prepayment penalty that was\r\n  due under the terms of the mortgage.Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the next year, Respondent attempted to negotiate a new payoff amount with the\r\n  original lender.Â  Respondent continued making the monthly payments of $3,400 on\r\n  the original mortgage, using the $492,119.42 in his trust account.Â  During this\r\n  time, Respondent did not inform the refinance lender that the original mortgage\r\n  had not been paid off and satisfied as the terms of the refinance loan\r\n  required.Â  This failure placed the refinance mortgage in junior priority to the\r\n  original mortgage.Â  Additionally, Respondent failed to inform his title\r\n  insurance company of this irregularity.Â  Thus, both the refinance lender and\r\n  the title insurance company were exposed to unanticipated and unbargained for\r\n  risk.\r\nRespondent\r\n  finally paid off the original mortgage on October 21, 2007.Â  Because interest\r\n  had continued to accrue on the original mortgage balance, Respondent had to\r\n  deposit over $22,000 of his own funds into the trust account to have sufficient\r\n  funds to pay off the original mortgage. \r\nThroughout\r\n  this time and into 2008, Respondent had an accountant reconciling his trust\r\n  account.Â  While he was unaware of any noncompliance at the time, Respondent\r\n  admits the accountant's methods did not comply with Rule 417, SCACR.Â  During\r\n  this time, Respondent's accounting ledgers indicated that several individual\r\n  client account ledgers carried negative balances.Â  Because other client account\r\n  ledgers carried sufficient positive balances to indicate an overall positive\r\n  balance in the trust account, the deficiencies were not noticed during the\r\n  accountant's &quot;bank to book&quot; reconciliations.Â  This accounting\r\n  practice effectively meant that some clients' funds were being used to cover\r\n  other client's deficiencies, although no checks were returned for\r\n  non-sufficient funds in the account. \r\nRespondent\r\n  contends that the accounting software insisted upon by his title insurance\r\n  company caused much data to be lost during the transition and later updates.Â \r\n  As a result of lost data, a $6,000 check was not indicated in Respondent's\r\n  accounts.Â  Once Respondent paid off the original mortgage in October 2007,\r\n  there was a $6,000 shortfall.Â  The shortfall was caught the next month during\r\n  the routine reconciliation process, and Respondent promptly deposited personal\r\n  funds into the account to make up the shortfall.\r\nIn\r\n  September 2007, Respondent's title insurance company came for the routine audit\r\n  and pronounced the trust account in complete disarray.Â  The title company filed\r\n  the complaint with the ODC, alleging Respondent's failure to properly reconcile\r\n  his trust account.Â  The ODC then brought formal charges in November 2008 and\r\n  Respondent replied to those charges in December 2008.\r\nThe Panel found\r\n  violations of the following rules: Rule 417, SCACR, for failing to reconcile\r\n  and adequately maintain accounting of his financial records; Rule 1.1\r\n  Competence, for failing to competently conduct the refinance; Rule 1.15\r\n  Safeguarding Property, for failing to safeguard both the proceeds of the\r\n  refinance and the lien position of the refinance lender's new mortgage, and\r\n  client funds in his trust account; and Rule 8.4 Misconduct, by his continuing\r\n  failure to resolve the original mortgage payoff for nearly one year and for\r\n  failing to properly reconcile his trust account and individual client account\r\n  ledgers.Â  The Panel recommended Respondent be given a public reprimand and be\r\n  ordered to pay the costs of the disciplinary proceedings.Â  \r\nThe ODC takes\r\n  exception to this recommendation, urging that the serious nature of these\r\n  violations requires a more serious sanction, even though no clients were\r\n  injured and Respondent is currently in compliance with the Rules.Â  Respondent\r\n  also takes exception to the Panel's recommendation, asserting that the facts do\r\n  not warrant a public sanction, and that a private sanction would be most\r\n  appropriate, given Respondent's standing in the legal community and lack of\r\n  prior disciplinary history.\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nThe\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys and decide appropriate sanctions after a\r\n  thorough review of the record rests with this Court.Â  In re Thompson,\r\n  343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  In such matters, this Court may\r\n  draw its own conclusions and make its own findings of fact. Â Id.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, the findings and conclusions of the Panel are entitled to much\r\n  respect and consideration.Â  Id.Â Â Â  \r\nAnalysis\r\nRespondent\r\n  urges that the Panel's recommended public sanction is too severe given the\r\n  facts of this case.Â  We disagree.\r\n&quot;This\r\n  Court has made it abundantly clear that an attorney is charged with a special\r\n  responsibility in maintaining and preserving the integrity of trust\r\n  funds.&quot; In the Matter of Houston, 382 S.C. 164, 167, 675 S.E.2d\r\n  721, 723 (2009) (citation omitted).Â  The facts of In the Matter of Houston are similar to this case.Â  In that case, the attorney failed to properly comply\r\n  with the record-keeping requirements of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  Id. at 166, 675 S.E.2d at 722-23.Â  Like in this case, no clients were harmed and no\r\n  funds were misused.Â  Id. at 167, 675 S.E.2d at 723.Â  The attorney failed\r\n  to keep proper records of the money going through the trust account, but\r\n  already had taken corrective measures by the time this Court heard the case.Â  Id.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, this Court, taking into consideration the severity of the\r\n  misconduct, ordered the attorney be given a public reprimand, obtain the\r\n  assistance of a certified public accountant, attend four hours of CLEs, and pay\r\n  the costs of the proceedings.Â  Id. at 167-68, 675 S.E.2d at 723.Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  Respondent admits that he failed to properly reconcile his trust account for\r\n  more than two years.Â  By failing to keep proper financial records in accordance\r\n  with the Rules of Professional Conduct, Respondent opened his clients to an\r\n  inexcusable risk of harm. Â Additionally, his improper handling of his refinance\r\n  exposed both his refinance lender and title insurance company to significant\r\n  risk as the refinance lien was unprotected and in a secondary position\r\n  throughout the eleven months Respondent attempted to negotiate a new payoff\r\n  amount.Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  over the eleven months Respondent was making the monthly payment on the\r\n  original mortgage, he depleted the funds entrusted to him for payment of the\r\n  original mortgage in excess of $28,000.Â  Thus, Respondent was effectively using\r\n  his clients' funds to meet his personal repayment obligations.Â  Respondent\r\n  deposited over $22,000 of his personal funds into the trust account to meet the\r\n  final payoff amount for the original mortgage.Â  Afterwards, he noticed there\r\n  was still a $6,000 shortfall in the trust account, so he deposited the amount\r\n  necessary to bring it into balance.Â  If Respondent had simply paid off and\r\n  satisfied the original mortgage upon closing the refinance loan, as he was\r\n  obligated to, this shortfall would not have occurred.\r\nAlthough\r\n  no clients complained, no client funds were lost or intentionally\r\n  misappropriated, and the account was never overdrawn throughout this period, it\r\n  appears to be mere fortuitous happenstance that no actual harm was caused.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find a public sanction is an appropriate sanction under these circumstances. \r\nConclusion\r\nWe adopt the\r\n  Panel's recommendations and hereby publicly reprimand Respondent and order him\r\n  to pay the costs of this action within ninety days of the filing of this\r\n  opinion.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26816","title":"In the Matter of William Grayson Ervin","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26816","description":"In this attorney disciplinary matter, the court issues a 6 month suspension, retroactive to the date of interim suspension.","date":"2010-05-11","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\nP.heading {\r\ntext-align:center\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of William Grayson Ervin, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26816\r\nHeard April 6, 2010 - Filed May 11, 2010Â Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley\r\n  M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Senior Assistant\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tThomas\r\n  C. Brittain, of Conway, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  In this disciplinary matter,\r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) brought formal charges against\r\n  Respondent William Grayson Ervin following his arrest for pointing and\r\n  presenting a firearm.Â  The Panel recommended Respondent be suspended for two\r\n  years retroactively, pay the costs of the proceeding, and attend counseling for\r\n  two years.Â  We believe a lesser sanction is warranted and suspend Respondent\r\n  for six months retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  \r\nI.\r\nRespondent\r\n  graduated from college in 2004 and then worked as a police officer in Horry County for a year and a half.Â  Following his graduation from law school in 2007,\r\n  Respondent began working as an assistant solicitor with the Ninth Circuit\r\n  Solicitor's Office.\r\nThis\r\n  case arises from a road rage incident.Â  On February 15, 2008, Respondent was\r\n  arrested and charged with pointing and presenting a firearm after he allegedly\r\n  pointed his gun at a driver (&quot;female driver&quot;) in another vehicle\r\n  while driving.Â  Respondent was immediately fired from the solicitor's office\r\n  and placed on interim suspension.\r\nThe female driver\r\n  informed law enforcement that she was alone in her vehicle when Respondent,\r\n  without provocation, displayed a firearm.Â  While Respondent exercised extremely\r\n  poor judgment warranting a sanction, the facts are not as reprehensible as\r\n  reported by the female driver.\r\nThe\r\n  record reveals the following facts.Â  Respondent was driving from Charleston to Myrtle Beach on February 15, 2008.Â  As he was merging onto the Ravenel Bridge, he drove behind a vehicle traveling around twenty miles-per-hour.Â  Respondent\r\n  testified the vehicle was &quot;zigzagging&quot; in the lane, so he attempted\r\n  to get around it.Â  Respondent admitted he was following the vehicle too\r\n  closely.Â  As he tried to pass the vehicle, Respondent testified the female\r\n  driver and her male passenger extended their middle fingers and shouted at\r\n  him.Â  Respondent testified he tried to pass them a couple of times, but they\r\n  cut him off each time.Â  When Respondent was eventually able to get in front of\r\n  the car, he tapped his brakes, apparently in an attempt to frustrate the\r\n  driver.\r\nThe\r\n  female driver then pursued Respondent and passed him.Â  As the couple's vehicle\r\n  passed Respondent's vehicle, the male passenger held up a gun, put his middle\r\n  finger up, and yelled at him.Â Â  Respondent passed them, took his gun from the\r\n  center console,[1] and said: &quot;What the\r\n  hell are you doing, I have one too.&quot;Â  This concluded the road rage\r\n  incident, and the female driver exited the highway.Â  The female driver called\r\n  911 claiming to be a victim of road rage.Â  The female driver provided\r\n  information concerning Respondent's vehicle.Â  Shortly thereafter, the police\r\n  stopped Respondent's vehicle and arrested him.Â  \r\nRespondent and the\r\n  female driver disputed the events leading up to the incident.Â  According to the\r\n  incident report, the female driver claimed she was by herself in the vehicle,\r\n  and as she was driving on the highway, Respondent's vehicle came up behind her\r\n  at a high rate of speed.Â  The female driver stated that as he passed her,\r\n  Respondent was yelling and pointing a gun at her.Â  The female driver denied any\r\n  road rage conduct on her part, as well as the presence of a male passenger in\r\n  her vehicle.\r\nAfter\r\n  investigating the matter, the Attorney General's Office offered Respondent the\r\n  opportunity to enter into pre-trial intervention (PTI) in exchange for the\r\n  dismissal of the charge.[2]Â  After Respondent\r\n  successfully completed PTI, the charge was nol prossed and expunged from his\r\n  record.\r\nFor\r\n  reasons not known, law enforcement never investigated Respondent's claim that a\r\n  male passenger had first pointed a firearm at Respondent and threatened him.Â \r\n  Law enforcement simply accepted the female driver's claim that she was alone.Â \r\n  The truth came to light at the Panel Hearing.Â  The female driver's call to 911\r\n  was recorded.Â  The 911 recording proves the presence of a male passenger in the\r\n  vehicle.Â  The voice of the male passenger is heard relaying identifying\r\n  information about Respondent's vehicle, such as his license plate number.Â \r\n  Additionally, Respondent submitted affidavits from the female driver's landlord\r\n  stating she saw the driver and her husband - the male passenger - after the\r\n  incident and the driver told her &quot;they&quot; had a problem with someone on\r\n  the bridge.Â  Respondent also submitted an affidavit from the property manager\r\n  of the female driver's residence.Â  He asserted that the female driver told him\r\n  about the incident and that both she and her husband were in the vehicle.Â  A\r\n  day later, she told the property manager the person involved in the incident\r\n  was a solicitor and &quot;we (she and [her husband]) are going to sue him for\r\n  'a lot of money.'&quot;\r\nThe\r\n  true facts concerning the road rage incident in no manner exonerate Respondent,\r\n  yet the facts mitigate the degree of his misconduct.Â  Respondent exercised\r\n  extremely poor judgment in participating in this road rage incident.Â \r\n  Respondent could have removed himself from the situation after the initial\r\n  contact, but he chose to further engage the couple in the other vehicle.Â \r\n  Respondent was then confronted and threatened by the male passenger with a\r\n  firearm.Â  The female driver lied to law enforcement, and when law enforcement\r\n  merely accepted her claims without any scrutiny, she saw an opportunity to\r\n  leverage Respondent in a civil lawsuit.Â  If law enforcement had simply listened\r\n  to the 911 transmission, the falsity of the centerpiece of the female driver's\r\n  claim would have been revealed. \r\nThe\r\n  Panel questioned Respondent regarding his counseling sessions.Â  Respondent admitted\r\n  he perhaps had unresolved issues as a result of a prior shooting incident when\r\n  he was a police officer.Â  Respondent was candid with the Panel and took full\r\n  responsibility for his actions.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  their report, the Panel adopted Respondent's version of events as a matter of\r\n  fact, specifically finding that the driver lied when she told police she was\r\n  alone in the vehicle.Â  We concur in this assessment. Â The Panel found\r\n  Respondent violated Rules 8.4(a) and 8.4(b), Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR.Â  As mitigating factors, the Panel found Respondent made full\r\n  disclosure to ODC, he demonstrated genuine remorse for his conduct, and he had\r\n  no disciplinary history.Â  Respondent has been on interim suspension since his\r\n  arrest.Â  The Panel recommended Respondent be suspended for two years\r\n  retroactively, pay the costs of the proceeding, and attend counseling for\r\n  twenty-four months.Â  \r\nII.\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to\r\n  discipline attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough\r\n  review of the record.Â  In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10-11, 539 S.E.2d 396, 401 (2000).Â  This Court &quot;may accept, reject, or modify in\r\n  whole or in part the findings, conclusions and recommendations of the [Panel].&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 27(e)(2), Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nWe adopt the\r\n  Panel's factual findings regarding the incident and agree that, through his\r\n  actions on February 15, 2008, Respondent violated Rules 8.4(a) and 8.4(b) of\r\n  the Rules on Professional Conduct (misconduct to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional conduct and to commit a criminal act that reflects adversely on\r\n  the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects).Â \r\n  Respondent exercised extremely poor judgment in allowing an avoidable situation\r\n  to escalate into a dangerous incident.Â  However, we believe Respondent realizes\r\n  the serious nature of the incident and has expressed genuine remorse for his\r\n  conduct.Â  We find a six-month suspension is warranted.Â  See In re\r\n    Jordan, 385 S.C. 614, 686 S.E.2d 682 (2009) (imposing a nine-month\r\n  suspension where attorney was charged with multiple drug offenses, including\r\n  possession with intent to distribute, but successfully completed the PTI\r\n  program); In re Sorenson, 380 S.C. 119, 669 S.E.2d 91 (2008) (imposing a\r\n  public reprimand where attorney completed the PTI program after being charged\r\n  with unlawful gaming and betting on four separate occasions); In re Hart,\r\n  366 S.C. 557, 623 S.E.2d 650 (2005) (imposing a public reprimand where attorney\r\n  was arrested for criminal domestic violence, but completed the PTI program).Â  \r\n\r\nIV.\r\nWe suspend\r\n  Respondent from the practice of law for six months, retroactive from the date\r\n  of his interim suspension on February 21, 2008.Â  Additionally, per the Panel's\r\n  report, we order Respondent attend counseling at least once a month for\r\n  twenty-four months, submit quarterly reports from his counselor to ODC, and pay\r\n  the costs of these proceedings.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Respondent lawfully owned the gun and was\r\n  lawfully carrying the gun in his vehicle.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; Since Respondent worked for the solicitor's\r\n  office, the Attorney General's Office (AGO) handled the prosecution.Â  At the\r\n  hearing, counsel for Respondent stated Respondent did not know whether the AGO\r\n  planned to present the case to the grand jury for indictment.Â  However,\r\n  Respondent was under the impression that the process would take a long time due\r\n  to the AGO's workload, and for this reason, he decided to take the offer of PTI\r\n  in exchange for the charges being dropped.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26817","title":"Robinson v.

Celia Robinson, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of\r\n  Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott and Assistant Attorney General Ashley\r\n  A. McMahan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â \r\n  In this post-conviction relief (PCR) case, the Court granted Adrian D.\r\n  Robinson's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judge's order\r\n  denying Robinson's request for relief from his sentence for trafficking in crack\r\n  cocaine, third offense.Â  In his PCR application, Robinson contended:Â  (1) he\r\n  should not have been sentenced for a third offense given he was not validly\r\n  convicted of a second drug offense; and (2) his trial counsel was ineffective\r\n  in failing to object to his sentence. Â We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn June 7, 2000, Robinson pleaded guilty to four drug\r\n  offenses.Â  The offenses of possession with intent to distribute (PWID) crack\r\n  cocaine and PWID crack cocaine within proximity of a park or school were\r\n  considered first offenses.Â  The indictments for these offenses alleged Robinson\r\n  committed these acts on April 30, 1999.Â  Robinson also pleaded guilty to\r\n  possession of crack cocaine and possession of marijuana.Â  The indictments for\r\n  these offenses alleged Robinson committed these acts on February 17, 2000.Â  The\r\n  sentencing forms for the possession of marijuana charge and the possession of\r\n  crack cocaine charge, which were signed by Robinson, indicate these offenses\r\n  constituted second offenses.Â  Robinson did not appeal his plea or sentences.\r\nWhile on parole for the above-listed offenses,\r\n  Robinson was indicted in March 2003 for trafficking in crack cocaine in an amount\r\n  between ten and twenty-eight grams and PWID crack cocaine within proximity of a\r\n  college or university.Â  The indictments alleged Robinson committed these acts\r\n  on December 30, 2002.\r\nFollowing a trial, a jury convicted Robinson of both\r\n  indicted offenses.Â  During the sentencing hearing, the solicitor informed the\r\n  trial judge of Robinson's prior record and indicated the current conviction\r\n  constituted a third drug offense.Â  The solicitor referenced Robinson's 2000\r\n  guilty plea and noted that Robinson had pleaded guilty to possession of crack\r\n  cocaine as a second offense during that plea.Â  Robinson's trial counsel did not\r\n  object to the solicitor's recitation of Robinson's prior record or the solicitor's\r\n  assertion that the trafficking charge constituted a third offense.Â  Instead,\r\n  trial counsel urged the judge to sentence Robinson to the minimum term for a\r\n  third offense and to order the sentences to be served concurrently.\r\nUltimately, the trial judge sentenced Robinson to\r\n  twenty-five years' imprisonment for trafficking in crack cocaine in an amount\r\n  between ten and twenty-eight grams, third offense, and to a concurrent sentence\r\n  of fifteen years' imprisonment for the PWID crack cocaine in proximity of a\r\n  college. \r\nRobinson appealed his convictions and sentences to the\r\n  Court of Appeals pursuant to Anders v. California, 386 U.S. 738 (1967).Â \r\n  After an Anders review, the Court of Appeals dismissed Robinson's appeal\r\n  and granted appellate counsel's petition to be relieved.Â  State v. Robinson,\r\n  Op. No. 2005-UP-176 (S.C. Ct. App. filed March 10, 2005).\r\nSubsequently, Robinson filed a PCR application in\r\n  which he alleged multiple grounds of ineffective assistance of trial counsel\r\n  and challenged the trial court's lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  \r\nAt the beginning of the PCR hearing, PCR counsel\r\n  informed the judge that Robinson was pursuing his application solely on the\r\n  ground that trial counsel was ineffective in allowing him to be sentenced for a\r\n  third drug offense rather than a second drug offense. \r\nRobinson believed he was entitled to be sentenced as a\r\n  second offender, as opposed to a third offender, given he pleaded guilty to all\r\n  four of the drug offenses on the same day.Â  Because the two &quot;sets of\r\n  charges&quot; were entered on the same date, Robinson claimed they could not\r\n  constitute a first and second drug offense.Â  As a result, Robinson maintained\r\n  his sentence for trafficking was illegally entered as a third offense rather\r\n  than a second offense.Â  \r\nAfter the hearing, the PCR judge issued a written\r\n  order in which he denied Robinson's application and dismissed it with\r\n  prejudice.Â  Â Specifically, the PCR judge found that Robinson &quot;could have\r\n  been sentenced as a third offender regardless of the fact that the first and\r\n  second convictions, used to enhance his sentence, were entered on the same date\r\n  and were not part of a comprehensive plea bargain.&quot;Â  \r\nIn reaching this conclusion, the judge noted that\r\n  Robinson was sentenced under section 44-53-375(C) of the South Carolina Code,[1] which does not define what constitutes a prior narcotics conviction that would\r\n  support enhancement.Â  However, the judge found the version of section 44-53-470\r\n  of the Code, in effect at the time of Robinson's trial, stated &quot;[a]n\r\n  offense is considered a second or subsequent offense, if, prior to his\r\n  conviction of the offense, the offender has at any time been convicted under this\r\n  article or under any State or Federal statute relating to narcotic drugs, marihuana,\r\n  depressant, stimulant, or hallucinogenic drugs.&quot;Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-53-470 (2002).Â  The judge found section 44-53-470 &quot;plainly states that\r\n  an offense will constitute a second offense if 'the offender has at any time\r\n  been convicted under this article.'&quot;Â  \r\nApplying section 44-53-470, the judge concluded\r\n  Robinson &quot;had a prior conviction or first offense, before the second\r\n  conviction even though the two occurred at the same hearing.&quot;Â  Â Additionally,\r\n  the judge found Robinson had &quot;notice and knowledge&quot; of his charge for\r\n  a second offense given:Â  (1) he signed the sentencing sheets from the June 2000\r\n  plea that indicated he pleaded guilty to a second offense; and (2) the\r\n  solicitor, during Robinson's trial, stated that Robinson was being tried for a\r\n  third offense.Â  \r\nThe judge rejected Robinson's argument that section\r\n  17-25-45(F) of the Code[2] supported his position.Â  In so ruling, the judge found that this section had to\r\n  be interpreted in conjunction with section 17-25-50 of the Code,[3] which &quot;illustrates that the Legislature intended that offenses taking\r\n  place in one instance or act [of] criminality be treated as one offense.&quot;Â \r\n  In Robinson's case, the judge found there was no temporal relation between the\r\n  offenses because the first offenses occurred on April 30, 1999, and the second offenses\r\n  occurred on February 17, 2000.Â  As a result, the judge concluded that these\r\n  convictions should be viewed as two separate offenses and that Robinson failed\r\n  to establish that counsel was deficient.\r\nThis Court granted Robinson's petition for a writ of certiorari\r\n  to review the PCR judge's order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution\r\n  guarantees a defendant the right to effective assistance of counsel.Â  U.S.\r\n  Const. amend. VI; Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984); Lomax\r\n    v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665 S.E.2d 164 (2008).Â  &quot;There\r\n  is a strong presumption that counsel rendered adequate assistance and exercised\r\n  reasonable professional judgment in making all significant decisions in the\r\n  case.&quot;Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596\r\n  (2007).\r\nThe United States\r\n  Supreme Court has established a two-pronged test to establish ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel by which a PCR applicant must show (1) counsel's\r\n  performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the\r\n  defendant.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 687; Cherry v. State, 300\r\n  S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â  Under the second prong, the PCR applicant &quot;must\r\n  show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional\r\n  errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.&quot;Â  Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 694.Â  &quot;A reasonable probability is a\r\n  probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.&quot;Â  Simmons v. State, 331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998).\r\n&quot;This\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) court's\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;Â  Dempsey v. State, 363\r\n  S.C. 365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  In reviewing the PCR judge's decision, an appellate\r\n  court is concerned only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to\r\n  support that decision.&nbsp; Smith\r\n    v. State, 369 S.C. 135, 138,\r\n  631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006).Â  This\r\n  Court will uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR judge\r\n  when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber v. State, 371\r\n  S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRobinson contends the PCR judge erred in denying\r\n  relief where the trial judge and the jury did not have authority to convict or\r\n  sentence him for a third drug offense given he had not previously been validly\r\n  convicted of any second drug offense.Â  \r\nIn support of this contention, Robinson claims his\r\n  convictions from the June 2000 guilty plea constituted four, first-offense drug\r\n  convictions.Â  Because he pleaded guilty to these charges during a single\r\n  proceeding, Robinson argues each conviction was a first offense and could not\r\n  have affected the other simultaneously-entered guilty pleas.Â  Specifically, he\r\n  avers the version of section 44-53-470 in effect at the time of his alleged\r\n  conviction for a second offense required a valid conviction prior to\r\n  establishing an offense as a second offense.Â  Referencing legislative intent\r\n  and this Court's line of cases involving recidivist sentencing,[4] Robinson maintains one offense cannot be enhanced by a prior conviction entered\r\n  on the same day.\r\nAdditionally, Robinson asserts that there was no\r\n  negotiated agreement with the State for him to plead guilty to any second\r\n  offenses; thus, this Court's decision in Rollison v. State, 346 S.C.\r\n  506, 552 S.E.2d 290 (2001)[5] is inapposite.Â  In distinguishing Rollison, Robinson claims he intended\r\n  to plead guilty to first offense charges with a sentencing-cap of seven years'\r\n  imprisonment for each of the four offenses.Â  As a result, he contends his June\r\n  2000 pleas were not knowingly and voluntarily entered.Â  Ultimately, Robinson claims\r\n  his June 2000 pleas did not constitute a valid second offense and, thus, should\r\n  not have served to enhance his subsequent 2003 drug conviction.Â  \r\nThe threshold question we must resolve is whether\r\n  Robinson's June 2000 pleas were valid.Â  Significantly, Robinson did not appeal\r\n  his June 2000 pleas nor did he file a PCR application within the statute of\r\n  limitations.[6]Â \r\n  Consequently, we find Robinson is precluded from now attacking the validity of\r\n  his pleas.\r\nHowever, even if we were to find Robinson's challenges\r\n  regarding the validity of his pleas were not procedurally barred, we conclude\r\n  they are without merit.Â  \r\nContrary to Robinson's contention, a defendant can\r\n  enter a valid plea to a first and second offense during the same proceeding.Â  Thus,\r\n  it was constitutionally permissible for Robinson to enter a plea of guilty to a\r\n  first and second drug offense during the same proceeding.Â  See State\r\n    v. Patterson, 272 S.C. 2, 249 S.E.2d 770 (1978) (holding, in a case where\r\n  defendant pleaded guilty during the same proceeding to a first and second drug\r\n  offense that occurred on the same date, trial judge properly treated the\r\n  charges as first and second offenses given at the time of the imposition of the\r\n  sentence for the second offense the appellant stood convicted by way of a\r\n  guilty plea of a first offense); Rollison, 346 S.C. at 515, 552 S.E.2d\r\n  at 294 (&quot;A defendant can enter a valid plea to a first and second offense\r\n  at the same plea hearing.&quot; (Toal, C.J., dissenting)).Â  \r\nHaving found that Robinson's June 2000 pleas were valid,\r\n  the question becomes whether the underlying convictions were sufficient to\r\n  establish a second offense under section 44-53-470 and, in turn, enhance\r\n  Robinson's sentence for trafficking in crack cocaine. \r\nAt the time Robinson pleaded guilty, this section\r\n  provided that an offense would constitute a second or subsequent offense if the\r\n  offender had &quot;at any time been convicted under this article.&quot;Â  As\r\n  will be discussed, we find Robinson's June 2000 plea of guilty resulted in two\r\n  separate offenses for sentencing purposes after June 2000.Â  Thus, the current\r\n  trafficking conviction constituted a third offense.\r\nInitially, we note the offenses that were the subject\r\n  of the June 2000 pleas were clearly separate and did not stem from a continuous\r\n  course of conduct.[7]Â \r\n  As evidenced by the record, the indictments for PWID crack cocaine and PWID\r\n  crack cocaine within proximity of a park or school alleged Robinson committed\r\n  these acts on April 30, 1999.Â  The separate indictments[8] for possession of crack cocaine and possession of marijuana alleged Robinson\r\n  committed these acts on February 17, 2000.Â  Thus, the charges stemming from\r\n  Robinson's conduct on April 30, 1999 and February 17, 2000 could have been\r\n  separately tried.Â  Therefore, the fact that Robinson pleaded guilty to each of\r\n  these offenses in a single proceeding did not negate their distinctiveness.Â  \r\nHowever, because the conduct for which Robinson was\r\n  indicted for the offenses of possession of crack cocaine and possession of\r\n  marijuana occurred during the course of a single incident on February 17, 2000,\r\n  we find these offenses should count as only one for the purpose of sentencing.Â \r\n  Similarly, the offenses committed on April 30, 1999 count as one for sentencing\r\n  purposes.Â  Therefore, Robinson had acquired two separate offenses that should\r\n  have been considered for sentencing purposes in a subsequent conviction.Â  See State v. Boyd, 288 S.C. 206, 209, 341 S.E.2d 144, 146 (Ct. App. 1986)\r\n  (&quot;We hold that where a defendant has been convicted on two or more counts\r\n  for the violation of the Controlled Substance Act arising out of simultaneous\r\n  acts committed in the course of a single incident, the convictions will be\r\n  considered as only one for the purpose of sentencing under a subsequent\r\n  conviction for a violation of the Controlled Substance Act.&quot;).\r\nThus, applying section 44-53-470, we hold Robinson's convictions\r\n  for possession of crack cocaine and possession of marijuana constituted second\r\n  offenses as Robinson had also been convicted of PWID crack cocaine. Â See Waiters v. State, 371 S.C. 591, 593, 641 S.E.2d 434, 435 (2007)\r\n  (&quot;Under Â§ 44-53-470, the timing of the crimes is irrelevant to the\r\n  determination of a subsequent offense so long as there is a prior\r\n  conviction.&quot;).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the trial judge properly enhanced\r\n  Robinson's trafficking sentence based on his two prior drug convictions.Â  See Butler v. State, 625 S.E.2d 458, 463 (Ga. Ct. App. 2005), aff'd, 637 S.E.2d 688 (Ga.&nbsp;2006) (concluding trial\r\n  judge properly enhanced defendant's conviction for selling cocaine based on\r\n  three prior convictions even though two of the convictions were entered on the\r\n  same date given they were separately indicted, contained in separate sentencing\r\n  orders, and concerned two separate sales of cocaine that took place on\r\n  different days).\r\nFinally, Robinson argues the PCR judge erred in finding\r\n  trial counsel provided effective representation. Â In view of our determination\r\n  that Robinson was properly sentenced for a third drug offense, we find there is\r\n  evidence to support the PCR judge's decision that Robinson's trial counsel was\r\n  not deficient in failing to challenge the instant conviction as a third\r\n  offense.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn conclusion, we find a decision to affirm the PCR\r\n  judge's order is consistent with this Court's recent pronouncement concerning\r\n  recidivist sentencing.Â  See Bryant, 384 S.C. at 534, 683 S.E.2d at\r\n  285 (interpreting and applying recidivist statutes, sections 17-25-45(F) and\r\n  17-25-50, involving prior convictions resulting in a sentence of life without\r\n  parole and reiterating that a prior conviction for sentencing purposes merely\r\n  requires a conviction which occurred on a separate occasion prior to the\r\n  current adjudication).\r\nHere, Robinson violated the drug laws on two separate\r\n  occasions prior to his 2003 conviction for trafficking in crack cocaine.Â  The\r\n  fact that these convictions were entered during a single proceeding did not\r\n  operate to &quot;fuse&quot; the separate convictions into a single offense.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, the PCR judge's order is\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that we should affirm the denial of\r\n  petitioner's application for post-conviction relief (PCR) but write separately\r\n  because I would decide the case solely on the basis that the statute of\r\n  limitations bars consideration of petitioner's claim.Â  I therefore concur in\r\n  the result reached by the majority.\r\nIn June 2000,\r\n  petitioner pled guilty to four drug offenses.Â  Pursuant to a plea bargain, two\r\n  of these four offenses were designated &quot;first offenses&quot; and two\r\n  &quot;second offenses.&quot;Â  It is well-settled that an individual may, as\r\n  part of a plea bargain, plead guilty to a crime of which he is not guilty.Â  Rollison\r\n    v. State, 346 S.C. 506, 552 S.E.2d 290 (2001).Â  So long as the defendant\r\n  understands the nature and elements of the charges, the consequences of his\r\n  plea and the constitutional rights he is waiving by virtue of the plea, he is\r\n  free to bargain for 'enhanced' convictions, that is, to have some convictions\r\n  classified as second drug offenses.Â  Id.Â  In the same vein, he can\r\n  bargain for multiple first offenses.Â  Id.\r\nHere,\r\n  petitioner did not timely file a PCR challenge to this 2000 plea, and cannot\r\n  now be heard to challenge the knowing and voluntary nature of that plea, nor\r\n  the quality of assistance rendered by plea counsel as the statute of\r\n  limitations applies to that conviction.Â  Peloquin v. State, 321 S.C.\r\n  468, 469 S.E.2d 606 (1996) (one year to file application).Â  I would decide the\r\n  case on this ground, and dismiss the writ of certiorari as improvidently\r\n  granted.Â  I do not join any of the majority's discussion of the validity of\r\n  that 2000 plea, the analysis of that plea's impact on petitioner's subsequent\r\n  sentence, and specifically distance myself from the discussion of S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 17-25-45 and -50, which I find irrelevant to the question whether\r\n  petitioner was properly sentenced as a third offender following his trial and\r\n  conviction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This section requires a judge to sentence a third or\r\n  subsequent offender to &quot;a mandatory minimum term of imprisonment of not\r\n  less than twenty-five years nor more than thirty years, no part of which may be\r\n  suspended nor probation granted, and a fine of fifty thousand dollars.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(C)(1)(c) (2002).\r\n[2]Â  At the time of Robinson's trial, section 17-25-45(F)\r\n  provided:\r\n\r\n\tFor the purpose of determining a prior conviction\r\n  under this section only, a prior conviction shall mean the defendant has been\r\n  convicted of a most serious or serious offense, as may be applicable, on a\r\n  separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-25-45(F) (2003).Â  \r\n[3]Â  Section 17-25-50 provides:\r\n\r\n\tIn determining the number of offenses for the purpose\r\n  of imposition of sentence, the court shall treat as one offense any number of\r\n  offenses which have been committed at times so closely connected in point of\r\n  time that they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding under the law\r\n  they constitute separate and distinct offenses.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  17-25-50 (2003). \r\n[4]Â  See Bryant v. State, 384 S.C. 525,\r\n  534, 683 S.E.2d 280, 285 (2009) (interpreting sections 17-25-45 and 17-25-50,\r\n  the recidivist statutes providing for a sentence of life without parole based\r\n  on prior convictions, and discussing appellate court decisions construing these\r\n  code sections). \r\n[5]Â  In Rollison, the defendant pleaded guilty to\r\n  both first and second offense drug charges on the same day in accordance with a\r\n  negotiated agreement with the State.Â  Rollison, 346 S.C. at 508, 552\r\n  S.E.2d at 291.Â  As part of the agreement, the defendant agreed to plead to PWID\r\n  crack cocaine, first offense, and possession of crack cocaine, second offense.Â \r\n  In exchange for the defendant's plea, the State agreed to dismiss three other\r\n  charges.Â  Id.Â  Subsequently, the defendant filed a PCR application in\r\n  which he contended his plea counsel was ineffective for permitting him to\r\n  accept the plea bargain and plead to a second offense PWID at the same time he\r\n  was pleading guilty to his first drug offense.Â  Id. at 510, 552 S.E.2d\r\n  at 292.Â  This Court reversed the PCR judge's finding that plea counsel was\r\n  ineffective because the plea record and the defendant's PCR testimony\r\n  established that the defendant was fully aware he was pleading guilty to both\r\n  first and second offenses.Â  Id. at 511-12, 552 S.E.2d at 292-93.Â  \r\n[6]Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003)\r\n  (&quot;An application for relief filed pursuant to\r\n  this chapter must be filed within one year after the entry of a judgment of\r\n  conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur to the lower\r\n  court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an appeal,\r\n  whichever is later.&quot;).\r\n[7]Â  See Bryant, 384 S.C. at 534, 683\r\n  S.E.2d at 285 (interpreting sections 17-25-45 and 17-45-50 involving prior\r\n  convictions that subjected defendant to a mandatory life without parole\r\n  sentence and finding that the language &quot;so closely connected in point of\r\n  time that they may be considered as one offense&quot; to mean that &quot;the\r\n  offenses are inextricably connected and share an immediate temporal\r\n  proximity&quot;).\r\n[8]Â  We would also note the York County Grand Jury\r\n  indicted Robinson on June 17, 1999, for the offenses that occurred on April 30,\r\n  1999.Â  A year later, on June 22, 2000, the York County Grand Jury indicted\r\n  Robinson for the offenses that occurred on February 17, 2000.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26818","title":"In the Matter of  Brian D.

Giese, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE:&nbsp; This case concerns Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE,\r\n  which allows in evidence as non-hearsay an out-of-court statement made by a non-testifying\r\n  &quot;coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy.&quot;Â  Keith Anthony Sims was convicted and sentenced for murder. Â Sims\r\n  appealed, challenging the admission of a statement attributed to a non-testifying\r\n  declarant as inadmissible hearsay.Â  The court of appeals affirmed, and we\r\n  granted a writ of certiorari to review that decision.Â  State v.\r\n  Sims, 377 S.C. 598, 661 S.E.2d 122 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2008).Â  The court of appeals erred in finding the challenged evidence\r\n  satisfied the &quot;in furtherance of the conspiracy&quot; prong of Rule\r\n  801(d)(2)(E).Â  We affirm in result, however, because the erroneously admitted\r\n  hearsay was harmless. \r\nI.\r\nThe\r\n  body of Brian Anderson was found in a Newberry County pond on December 31,\r\n  2003.Â  The body was chained to a pipe weighted down by two cement blocks.Â \r\n  Anderson had been shot in the right eye.Â  Marks on Anderson's body indicated he\r\n  was dragged to the pond.Â  Nearby, law enforcement agents found work gloves and\r\n  packaging.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  next day, Anderson's blood-spattered car was located in the parking lot of a\r\n  Columbia apartment complex.Â  The pattern of blood stains indicated that someone\r\n  in the front passenger's seat had shot Anderson while he was in the driver's\r\n  seat.Â  Anderson was last seen alive on December 30 at a party in a Columbia\r\n  hotel.Â  \r\nSims\r\n  and Anderson were acquaintances.Â  They left the party together around midnight in\r\n  Anderson's car.Â  Evidence pointed to Sims as the killer, and he was\r\n  arrested and charged with murder.Â  His subsequent statements to law enforcement contained\r\n  several versions of his involvement in Anderson's death.[1]\r\nDuring\r\n  the investigation, law enforcement learned that Sims had enlisted the support\r\n  of three individuals to help him dispose of Anderson's body, Sims's bloody\r\n  clothes and the gun used to kill Anderson.Â  Those three individuals were Natalie\r\n  English (Sims's girlfriend), Derrick Ruff (Sims's friend), and Nikki Davis\r\n  (Ruff's girlfriend). Â English, Ruff, and Davis were charged as accessories\r\n  after-the-fact of murder.Â  \r\nDavis\r\n  cooperated with law enforcement and led them to several pieces of critical\r\n  evidence, including the gun that Sims used to kill Anderson.Â  The information\r\n  Davis provided also enabled law enforcement to recover several items that had\r\n  belonged to Anderson; these items were found in a dumpster behind the church\r\n  Sims's mother attends.\r\nII.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, Sims testified he and Anderson had lived near each other on Monticello\r\n  Road in Richland County.Â  Although they had occasional arguments, Sims stated\r\n  they had been friends for several years.Â  Sims testified that Anderson had\r\n  &quot;quite a few guns,&quot; and a few weeks before his death, Anderson\r\n  had threatened Sims &quot;over some money.&quot;Â  \r\nAccording\r\n  to Sims, around 1:00 a.m. on December 31, 2003, Anderson offered to take him\r\n  home from the party.Â  Sims contended Anderson had &quot;a little gun in his\r\n  hand&quot; when he got into the car.Â  Sims acknowledged that he also was\r\n  carrying a gun: &quot;I have got shot in the past.Â  So I usually carry my gun\r\n  with me.&quot;Â  Sims testified that as they turned into his driveway:\r\n\r\n\t[Anderson]\r\n  was telling me that he was going to end all his beefs before the New Year.Â  And\r\n  he was reaching underneath his seat.Â  So I thought he was fixing to . . . grab\r\n  him a gun and shoot me.Â  So I pulled out my gun.Â  Out of fear I shot.\r\n\r\nSims added: &quot;I didn't\r\n  mean to kill him.Â  I was pulling my gun out because I thought he was fixing to\r\n  kill me.&quot;Â  Sims stated he did not realize until after he had fired that\r\n  &quot;I had just shot an unarmed man, so I was scared.&quot;Â  \r\nSims said that\r\n  following Anderson's shooting, he told his girlfriend, English, &quot;something\r\n  happened between me and [Anderson].&quot;Â  Sims stated he and English drove to\r\n  Newberry because he wanted to ask his friend Ruff what he should do.Â  English\r\n  drove her car, and Sims drove Anderson's car, which contained Anderson's body.Â \r\n  After Sims and Ruff talked, they left to dispose of Anderson's body.Â  After\r\n  dumping the body in the pond, Sims testified, &quot;we left [the car] in\r\n  Columbia.&quot;Â  \r\nSims acknowledged\r\n  that he gave several false statements to law enforcement in January of 2004.Â \r\n  He admitted at trial: &quot;I lied.Â  I was scared.&quot;Â  Sims said he was\r\n  afraid to be truthful because &quot;I had shot Brian [Anderson] and then I had\r\n  seen he didn't have no gun.&quot;Â  On January 22, 2004, Sims acknowledged\r\n  shooting Anderson but, again, his statement was not truthful: &quot;I told them\r\n  when we had got in my driveway and Brian had pulled a gun out on me.&quot;Â  At\r\n  trial, Sims admitted, &quot;I was lying because when I seen he had no\r\n  gun I was scared.&quot;Â  \r\nRuff\r\n  and Davis testified at trial and acknowledged helping Sims hide Anderson's body\r\n  and destroy evidence.Â  Sims's other coconspirator, English, did not testify.\r\nDavis\r\n  testified extensively regarding the events that followed Anderson's death.Â \r\n  According to Davis, around 3:00 a.m., English and Sims knocked on the door of\r\n  the home she shared with Ruff and his mother.Â  After Sims woke Ruff, he and\r\n  Sims spoke privately.Â  Davis claimed at this point she was not aware of the\r\n  killing or that her friends were planning to help Sims dispose of Anderson's\r\n  body: &quot;She [English] wouldn't tell me what was going on.Â  And so she asked\r\n  me if I wanted to go to Charleston.Â  And I told her, yeah . . . .&quot;Â  Davis\r\n  stated Sims searched for bricks in Ruff's yard.Â  After leaving Ruff's home,\r\n  they stopped at a gas station for English to buy &quot;gloves and stuff.&quot;Â  \r\nNext,\r\n  they drove down a dirt road and parked in front of a house.Â  Davis maintained\r\n  that she still was unaware of the killing or the real purpose of the trip.Â \r\n  Shortly after Sims and Ruff exited the car, Davis observed them &quot;toting\r\n  like this long thing I guess to a car, and a chain, you know, some bricks, just\r\n  toting it to the back of the house . . . .&quot;Â  Davis continued:\r\n\r\n\tThe next\r\n  thing I knew he [Sims] sped from behind the house inside of another car. Â And\r\n  that's when I, you know, started pushing Natalie [English]. Â I'm asking her\r\n  what's going on? Â Did he steal a car or what's going on? Â Where did he get that\r\n  from and stuff like that. Â And then she told me, you know, Keith had\r\n    murdered somebody.Â  But I didn't, you knowâ€”\r\n\r\nSims's counsel objected to\r\n  this portion of Davis's testimony on the ground of hearsay.Â  Without comment,\r\n  the trial court overruled Sims's general hearsay objection.Â  \r\nDavis's testimony\r\n  continued, stating they drove English's car to a park, where they met Sims, who\r\n  had driven Anderson's car.Â  According to Davis, as Sims opened the door to\r\n  Anderson's car, &quot;the guy, he just fell out.&quot;Â  Although Davis\r\n  contended she had been &quot;unable to think,&quot; she admitted that she had\r\n  helped Sims, English, and Ruff drag Anderson's body to the pond and throw him in.Â  \r\nBefore\r\n  leaving the park, Sims gave Davis a bag containing Anderson's cell phone,\r\n  chain, and wallet.Â  Sims then drove Anderson's car to Columbia, while Ruff,\r\n  English, and Davis drove English's car to Charleston. Â After arriving in\r\n  Charleston, Davis disposed of the bag and Sims's bloody clothes.Â  They promptly\r\n  returned to Columbia and met Sims at a friend's apartment.Â  Sims\r\n  rejoined the group and they drove together to Newberry. \r\nSims\r\n  told Davis to dispose of the gun, which he had wrapped in a shirt.Â  Davis\r\n  testified she and English drove to Columbia to attend church with Sims's mother.\r\n  Â Sims and Ruff remained in Newberry.Â  While English and Davis were driving to\r\n  Columbia, Davis disposed of the gun.Â  When they reached the church, Davis threw\r\n  several items from Anderson's car into a dumpster behind the church.Â  \r\nRuff\r\n  testified and confirmed that he had participated with Sims, English, and Davis in\r\n  hiding the body and disposing of the evidence.\r\nThe court charged the jury on murder, voluntary\r\n  manslaughter, and self-defense.Â  Sims was convicted of murder and sentenced.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed, to which we granted a writ of certiorari.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nSims\r\n  contends that the trial judge committed reversible error by allowing Davis to\r\n  testify that English, a non-testifying third party, told her &quot;Keith [Sims]\r\n  had murdered somebody&quot; because this evidence violated Rule 802, the rule\r\n  against hearsay.Â  The court of appeals analyzed the issue in terms of Rule\r\n  801(d)(2)(E), the coconspirator exception and found no error in the admission\r\n  of the statement attributed to English.Â  \r\nAn\r\n  appellate court reviews challenges to the admission and exclusion of evidence\r\n  for an abuse of discretion. Â See State\r\n    v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564\r\n  S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002) (&quot;The admission of evidence is within the discretion\r\n  of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;).Â  We agree with Sims that the challenged\r\n  testimony was inadmissible hearsay, but in view of the overwhelming evidence of\r\n  guilt, we find the error harmless.\r\nA.\r\nHearsay\r\n&quot;'Hearsay'\r\n  is a statement, other than one made by the declarant while testifying at the\r\n  trial or hearing, offered in evidence to prove the truth of the matter\r\n  asserted.&quot; Rule 801(c), SCRE.Â  Generally, hearsay is not admissible\r\n  evidence &quot;except as provided by these rules or by other rules prescribed by the Supreme Court of this State or by statute.&quot;Â \r\n  Rule 802, SCRE.\r\nBecause\r\n  of the generic nature of Sims's hearsay objection and the trial court's one\r\n  word rulingâ€”&quot;overruled&quot;â€”we do not have the benefit of any analysis in\r\n  the trial court concerning Rule 801(d)(2)(E), SCRE.Â  The first vetting of the\r\n  evidentiary challenge occurred on appeal.\r\nB.\r\nCoconspirator Exception to\r\n  the Rule against Hearsay\r\nA conspiracy is &quot;a combination or agreement between two or more persons for the purpose of\r\n  accomplishing a criminal or unlawful object, or achieving by criminal or\r\n  unlawful means an object that is neither criminal nor unlawful. Â The essence of\r\n  a conspiracy is the agreement.&quot;Â  State v. Buckmon, 347 S.C. 316,\r\n  323, 555 S.E.2d 402, 405 (2001) (internal citation omitted).\r\nWhile\r\n  hearsay testimony generally is not admissible, an exception is allowed when a\r\n  statement is offered against a party and is &quot;a statement by a\r\n  coconspirator of a party during the course and in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy.&quot; Â Rule 801(d)(2)(E),\r\n  SCRE.Â  When a statement meets these requirements, it is considered non-hearsay.\r\nThe\r\n  court of appeals concluded the challenged statement was not hearsay because it\r\n  was made by one coconspirator (English) to another member of the conspiracy\r\n  (Davis), and it occurred &quot;during the course and in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy.&quot;Â  The court of appeals opinion concluded: \r\n\r\n\tWe rule\r\n  the trial judge properly allowed one co-conspirator to testify to another\r\n  co-conspirator's statement relating to appellant's [Sims's] own statement of\r\n  guilt because the statement was calculated to induce participation in the\r\n  combined and joint effort to dispose of the victim's body, the gun, and other\r\n  evidence of murder. Â We hold the statement was NOT hearsay,\r\n  but constituted relevant and admissible probative evidence in this murder. \r\n\r\nSims, 377 S.C. at 612-13, 661 S.E.2d at 130 (emphasis in original).[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  State urges us to accept the court of appeals view that Davis's statement was\r\n  admissible under the coconspirator exception to the hearsay rule.Â  We agree\r\n  with the court of appeals that the evidence establishes the existence of a\r\n  conspiracy and that English's purported statement to Davis was made during the\r\n  course of the conspiracy.[3] Â We part company with the court of appeals only as it relates to Rule\r\n  801(d)(2)(E)'s requirement that the statement be made &quot;in furtherance of the\r\n  conspiracy.&quot;Â  \r\nConcerning\r\n  the &quot;in furtherance of&quot; prong, our law provides that &quot;a statement\r\n  by a co-conspirator must advance the conspiracy to be admissible under Rule\r\n  801(d)(2)(E).&quot; State\r\n  v. Gilchrist, 342 S.C. 369, 372, 536\r\n  S.E.2d 868, 869 (2000) (internal citation omitted).Â  &quot;While mere\r\n  conversation or narrative declarations are not admissible under this rule,\r\n  statements made to induce enlistment, further participation, prompt further\r\n  action, allay fears, or keep coconspirators abreast of an ongoing conspiracy's\r\n  activities are admissible.&quot;Â  Id. at 372, 536 S.E.2d at 869 (quoting United States v.\r\n    Arias-Villanueva, 998 F.2d 1491, 1502 (9th Cir. 1993)).\r\nIn State\r\n  v. Anders, a witness testified that she overheard a coconspirator of Anders\r\n  say that Anders &quot;was going to pay him big for blowing up the\r\n  building.&quot; Â 331 S.C. 474, 476, 503 S.E.2d 443, 444 (1998).Â  We held that &quot;even\r\n  if made during the conspiracy, the statement in no way advanced the\r\n  conspiracy.&quot;Â  Id. at 476-77, 503 S.E.2d at 444 (emphasis in\r\n  original).Â  In Anders, we noted that our jurisprudence in this area mirrored\r\n  that in other jurisdictions.Â  See United States v. Pallais, 921 F.2d\r\n  684, 688 (7th Cir. 1990) (&quot;Mere chitchat, casual admissions of culpability, and other noise and\r\n  static in the information stream are not admissible.&quot;); United States\r\n    v. Posner, 764 F.2d 1535, 1538 (11th Cir. 1985) (stating a letter that\r\n  &quot;spilled the beans&quot;\r\n  regarding a tax scheme &quot;could hardly be considered to have advanced any\r\n  object of the conspiracy&quot;).Â  Caselaw subsequent to Anders remains\r\n  in accord.Â  See United\r\n  States v. Pratt, 239 F.3d 640, 643 (4th Cir.\r\n  2001) (&quot;Idle conversation that touches on, but does not further, the\r\n  purposes of the conspiracy does not constitute a statement in furtherance of a\r\n  conspiracy under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).&quot;).\r\nWhile\r\n  English's challenged statement was made during the conspiracy, it was not made\r\n  in furtherance of the conspiracy.Â  The statement neither advanced the\r\n  conspiracy nor was intended to further induce Davis's participation in the\r\n  conspiracy.Â  English's statement that Sims had &quot;murdered somebody&quot; was\r\n  simply part of her narrative, best described as &quot;spilling the beans.&quot;Â  See Posner, 764 F.2d at 1538.Â  We thus conclude the statement was not\r\n  admissible under Rule 801(d)(2)(E).\r\n\r\nC.\r\nHarmless\r\n  Error\r\nWhile\r\n  we agree with Sims that the statement is inadmissible hearsay, we find the\r\n  error harmless in view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt. &quot;Generally,\r\n  appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not\r\n  affecting the result.&quot;Â  State v. Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 212, 631 S.E.2d 262, 267 (2006) (citing State v.\r\n  Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d\r\n  595, 597 (1991)).Â  &quot;[A]n insubstantial error not affecting the result of\r\n  the trial is harmless where 'guilt has been conclusively proven by competent\r\n  evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.'&quot; Â Id. at 212, 631 S.E.2d at 267 (quoting State v.\r\n  Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581,\r\n  584 (1989)).Â  \r\nSims\r\n  was able to fully develop a theory of self-defense by stating repeatedly:\r\n  &quot;I thought he was reaching for his gun to shoot and kill me.Â  So out of\r\n  fear I pulled my gun out and shot&quot;; &quot;I didn't mean to kill him.Â  . .\r\n  .Â  I guess just out of - out of fear I shot&quot;; and &quot;I had shot Brian\r\n  and then I had seen he didn't have no gun.&quot; Â \r\nMoreover,\r\n  English's statement that Sims &quot;had murdered somebody&quot; is properly\r\n  viewed as a colloquial expression that Sims had killed Anderson, without regard\r\n  to the legal niceties distinguishing murder from other forms of homicide.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court charged the jury on the law of murder, voluntary manslaughter, and\r\n  self-defense.Â  During deliberations, the jury asked the court to provide a\r\n  &quot;concise definition&quot; of only murder and manslaughter.Â  Without\r\n  objection, the court provided the jury with the written instructions, after\r\n  which the jury returned a guilty verdict for murder.Â  A careful review of the record\r\n  convinces us that the murder conviction was the product of overwhelming evidence\r\n  of guilt and the jury's thoughtful consideration of the law.Â  We reject any\r\n  suggestion that the jury, during the course of this four-day trial, merely\r\n  assented to the &quot;murder&quot; reference in Davis's lengthy testimony.Â  Â \r\nIV.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, because the challenged testimony was not &quot;in furtherance of&quot; the\r\n  conspiracy, we hold the testimony was not admissible under the coconspirator exception\r\n  of Rule 801(d)(2)(E).Â  We hold, however, that the error was harmless.Â  We\r\n  affirm the court of appeals in result.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN RESULT.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion in which\r\n  HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal: I concur in the majority's result, but respectfully disagree with its\r\n  reasoning.Â  I would hold that the trial judge did not err in allowing Davis to\r\n  testify that English told her &quot;Keith [Sims] had murdered somebody.&quot;Â \r\n  In my view, the court of appeals correctly analyzed this issue, finding that\r\n  English's statement was admissible under SCRE 801(d)(2)(e), the co-conspirator\r\n  exception to the rule against hearsay.Â  Therefore, I would affirm the court of\r\n  appeals in every respect and not reach a harmless error analysis.\r\nHEARN, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Sims's initial statement\r\n  acknowledged that Anderson had &quot;dropped him off&quot; after the party, but\r\n  denied any involvement in Anderson's death: &quot;I ain't got no pistol.Â  . .\r\n  .Â  That's crazy.Â  I didn't kill Brian.&quot;Â  In a subsequent statement,\r\n  Sims told law enforcement that he and Anderson left the party together around\r\n  1:00 a.m.; they stopped at McDonald's and a crack house before Anderson dropped\r\n  off Sims.Â  In a third statement, Sims continued to deny any involvement in\r\n  Anderson's death.Â  Sims eventually admitted to law enforcement that he shot\r\n  Anderson, but contended Anderson had pulled a gun on him.Â  At trial two years\r\n  later, Sims admitted killing Anderson, who was unarmed.Â  Sims asserted\r\n  self-defense as he testified he believed Anderson was reaching for a gun.Â Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The holding of the court of appeals warrants a correction and a\r\n  clarification.Â  First,the court of\r\n  appeals erred in referring to English's statement to Davis as Sims's &quot;own\r\n  statement of guilt.&quot;Â  We view this as a scrivener's error, for the coconspirator\r\n  analysis in the court of appeals opinion correctly attributes the statement to\r\n  English.Â  We further clarify that Davis's status as a coconspirator was not\r\n  relevant to the analysis of the admissibility of English's statement.Â  A statement made by a coconspirator to\r\n  (or overheard by) a third party who is not a member of the conspiracy may be admissible,\r\n  provided the statement was made during\r\n  the course and in furtherance of the conspiracy.Â  SeeState v. Anders, 331 S.C. 474, 503 S.E.2d 443\r\n  (1998); United States v. Shores, 33 F.3d 438, 444 (4th Cir. 1994). Â \r\n[3]&nbsp; During oral argument, Sims's counsel\r\n  acknowledged that Sims &quot;enlisted&quot; English, Ruff and Davis to dispose\r\n  of Anderson's body and other evidence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26821","title":"Poynter Investments v.

E.g.,Â  AJG Holdings, LLC v. Dunn,\r\n  382 S.C. 43, 674 S.E.2d 505 (Ct. App. 2009) (internal citation omitted).Â  An\r\n  additional requirement, that after a finding that the moving party had shown\r\n  these three elements the trial court then balance the equities, was added by\r\n  the Court of Appeals in County of Richland v. Simpkins, 348 S.C. 664,\r\n  560 S.E.2d 902(Ct. App. 2002).Â  This additional requirement appears in at least\r\n  three other preliminary injunction decisions issued by the Court of Appeals\r\n  between Simpkins and AJG Holdings: MailSource, LLC v. M. A.\r\n    Bailey &amp; Assoc., 356 S.C. 363, 588 S.E.2d 635 (Ct. App. 2003); Levine\r\n      v. Spartanburg Reg. Serv. Dist., Inc., 367 S.C. 458, 626 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App.\r\n  2005); and Peek v. Spartanburg Reg. Healthcare Sys., 367 S.C. 450, 626\r\n  S.E.2d 34 (Ct. App. 2005). \r\nThe\r\n  authority cited for the balancing requirement is Foreman v. Foreman ,\r\n  280 S.C. 461, 313 S.E.2d 312 (Ct. App. 1984).Â  Foreman, however, did not\r\n  involve a request for injunctive relief, but was instead an equitable division\r\n  case.Â  In our view, the â€œbalancing the equitiesâ€ requirement is neither\r\n  necessary nor appropriate in a preliminary injunction case, where the three\r\n  requirements (irreparable harm, success on merits, and inadequate remedy at\r\n  law) are well established and clearly delineate the burden of proof and of\r\n  persuasion.Â  Moreover, the balancing requirement is subsumed by the irreparable\r\n  harm and inadequate remedy at law components of the three-part test.\r\nWe\r\n  therefore modify these five Court of Appeals decisions to the extent they\r\n  include a separate &quot;balancing the equities&quot; requirement.Â  The trial\r\n  judge here did not err in declining to perform this extra task.\r\n2.&nbsp; Geographical Restitution\r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the trial judge exceeded his authority in rewriting or\r\n  &quot;blue-penciling&quot; the territorial restriction.Â  We agree.\r\nNeither\r\n  this Court, nor the Court of Appeals, has directly addressed the authority of a\r\n  court to decrease the geographical limitations in an overly broad non-compete\r\n  agreement.Â  However, this Court has held that it would violate public policy to\r\n  allow a court to insert a geographical limitation where none existed.Â  See\r\n    Stonhard, Inc., v. Carolina Flooring Spec., Inc., 366 S.C. 156, 621 S.E.2d\r\n  352 (2005).Â  Stonhard held that such a reformation would be void, as it\r\n  would add a term to the contract that the parties neither negotiated nor agreed\r\n  to.Â  Id.Â  The Court of Appeals has held that it would be impermissible\r\n  to extend the non-compete period contained in the agreement as a remedy for its\r\n  breach, since such an extension &quot;would essentially re-write the partiesâ€™\r\n  contract, a service the courts of South Carolina do not perform.â€Â  MailSource,\r\n    LLC, 356 S.C. at 369, 588 S.E.2d at 639 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  in Faces Boutique, Ltd. v. Gibbs, 318 S.C. 39, 455 S.E.2d 707 (Ct. App.\r\n  1995), the Court of Appeals upheld the trial courtâ€™s finding that a non-compete\r\n  agreement was overbroad in that it purported to prevent the defendant, an\r\n  esthetician, from being associated in any capacity with a business that\r\n  competed with the original business.Â  The original business brought suit to\r\n  enforce the covenant when the defendant went to work for a competitor as a\r\n  manicurist.Â  On appeal, the court noted that at trial the original business had\r\n  agreed to limit the agreement to its â€œspiritâ€ rather than its literal terms,\r\n  but held that a party could not convert an overbroad clause into an enforceable\r\n  one by agreeing to an interpretation that artificially limited the actual terms\r\n  used in the contract.Â  \r\nThese\r\n  cases stand for the proposition that, in South Carolina, the restrictions in a\r\n  non-compete clause cannot be rewritten by a court or limited by the parties'\r\n  agreement, but must stand or fall on their own terms.Â  We hold, therefore, that\r\n  the trial judge erred in rewriting the territorial restriction in the parties'\r\n  contract.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  order which purports to enforce a non-competition agreement on terms other than\r\n  those agreed upon by the parties.Â  We also note that the parties appear to be\r\n  laboring under the misconception that the appeal of this preliminary injunction\r\n  prevented the circuit court from proceeding with the merits of the case.Â  An\r\n  order granting a preliminary injunction is immediately appealable under S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(4) (Supp. 2009).Â  Section 14-3-450 (1976) explicitly\r\n  provides where an appeal is permitted by Â§ 14-3-330(4), &quot;the proceedings\r\n  in other respects in the court below shall not be stayed during the pendency of\r\n  the appeal unless otherwise ordered by the court below.&quot;Â  Accordingly, unless\r\n  ordered by the trial court, an appeal from a preliminary injunction order does\r\n  not prevent the case moving forward on the merits.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26822","title":"Blackburn v.

App. 2009).Â  This Court\r\n  granted certiorari.Â  We now reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and\r\n  remand to the circuit court.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn late 2002, Kent\r\n  Blackburn, Tina Carver, and Raymond Windham formed a corporation, operating as\r\n  the Carolina Mobility Center (Carolina Mobility), to sell durable medical\r\n  equipment.Â  The newly formed company borrowed $50,000 for capital and each of\r\n  the three members signed on the note.Â  In early 2003, the shareholders\r\n  agreed to hire Alison Minnich as an employee, at a salary of $34,000.[1]Â \r\n  In addition, Minnich received a 10% stake in the company.Â  Blackburn, Carver,\r\n  and Windham each held a 30% stake.\r\nIn 2004, in\r\n  addition to paying Minnich's salary, Carolina Mobility paid salaries to Carver\r\n  and Windham of nearly $34,000 each.Â  Carver and Windham received salaries of\r\n  $13,333.33 each in 2005.Â  The shareholders also received disbursements in\r\n  accordance with their stakes in the company.Â  Carver was responsible for\r\n  signing checks on behalf of the corporation.\r\nA\r\n  dispute developed among the members of the corporation and Blackburn and\r\n  Minnich (collectively &quot;Petitioners&quot;) filed suit alleging that, as\r\n  Carolina Mobility became profitable, Carver and Windham (collectively\r\n  &quot;Respondents&quot;) began paying themselves from the corporate funds,\r\n  amounts disguised as salaries for minimal or non-existent contributions to the\r\n  corporation.Â  As a result, Petitioners alleged that Respondents lessened the\r\n  value of Petitioners' ownership interest in Carolina Mobility.Â  Petitioners\r\n  asked that the corporation be dissolved and that the Respondents be required to\r\n  pay Petitioners the lost value of their stock.  \r\nAfter\r\n  a bench trial, Judge Thomas Russo issued an order (Judge Russo's Order) finding\r\n  in favor of Petitioners.Â  Judge Russo found that the Respondents &quot;have\r\n  engaged in a pattern of improperly draining the assets of the corporation\r\n  through claims of services as employees of the corporation, and have improperly\r\n  represented to the other shareholders their activities on behalf of the\r\n  corporation.&quot;Â  Specifically, Judge Russo found that Respondents &quot;paid\r\n  Minnich her salary and then split the rest of the earnings as individual\r\n  salaries instead of profit, thus devaluing the corporation.&quot;Â  Rather than\r\n  dissolve the corporation as Petitioners requested, Judge Russo elected to\r\n  require Respondents to purchase Petitioners' shares at Fair Market Value.[2]Â \r\n  The court order concluded: &quot;Following the appraisal, [Petitioners] should\r\n  be paid in accordance with their percentage of the corporation's shares.&quot;Â \r\n  No party filed a Motion for Reconsideration.  \r\nIn\r\n  accordance with the trial court's order, the parties agreed on an appraiser (Appraiser).Â \r\n  The parties also agreed on a valuation method, choosing the &quot;income\r\n  approach.&quot;Â  In the Appraiser Report (Report), Appraiser valued the total\r\n  shares in Carolina Mobility at $34,300.Â  Petitioners filed objections to the\r\n  Report on the ground that it did not account for the corporation's loss in\r\n  value due to Respondents' improper actions.Â  Petitioners moved that the Report\r\n  be vacated and that Appraiser be instructed to value the corporation only after\r\n  &quot;normalizing the earnings of the corporation in a manner consistent with [Judge\r\n  Russo's order].&quot;Â  Respondents filed a motion to enforce the judgment in\r\n  accordance with the Report.  \r\nA\r\n  hearing was held before Judge Michael Nettles on the motions.Â  Judge Nettles\r\n  issued an order (Judge Nettles's Order) granting Respondents' motion to enforce\r\n  the judgment and ordering payment to Petitioners in accordance with their\r\n  percentage shares.Â  Petitioners appealed and the Court of Appeals affirmed.Â \r\n  This Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.  \r\nISSUE  \r\nDid\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in upholding the trial court's decision denying\r\n  Petitioners' Motion to Vacate the Report?\r\nDISCUSSION  \r\nA.&nbsp; Terms of the Appraisal  \r\nPetitioners'\r\n  contend that the Appraiser failed to conform to the agreed-upon guidelines in\r\n  conducting the appraisal.Â  We agree with Petitioners that by failing to make\r\n  &quot;normalization adjustments,&quot; the Appraiser did not comply with the\r\n  &quot;income approach,&quot; and the Appraisal should be vacated.  \r\nAs\r\n  noted, in his order, Judge Russo required the parties to agree on an impartial\r\n  corporate appraiser to compute the corporation's value.Â  The parties did so.Â \r\n  In an Engagement Letter to Respondents' attorney, Appraiser outlined the\r\n  &quot;terms and objectives&quot; of the valuation. Â Under the terms of the\r\n  letter, Respondents acknowledged that Appraiser's &quot;services and work\r\n  product&quot; would be subject to the terms of the letter, including the\r\n  attached &quot;Exhibit 1.&quot;Â  Exhibit 1 provided that the analysis would be\r\n  done in accordance with the Statement of Standards for Valuation Services of\r\n  the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) and National\r\n  Association of Certified Valuation Analysts (NACVA).  \r\nB.&nbsp; The Income Approach  \r\nThe\r\n  parties also agreed on a method for valuating the corporation, selecting the\r\n  &quot;income approach&quot; from three options.[3]Â \r\n  The &quot;income approach&quot; or &quot;investment value&quot; approach[4] is a method for ascertaining the present value of a corporation's expected\r\n  future earnings.Â  See 14 Business Organizations with Tax Planning Â§\r\n  186.05[2] (Matthew Bender) (2010).Â  &quot;This figure is obtained by\r\n  multiplying a recent year's financial performance or an average of recent\r\n  years' performances by a capitalization ratio selected to reflect the\r\n  corporation's future prospects.&quot;Â  Id.      \r\nC.&nbsp; Normalization  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  complain that Appraiser omitted a key step in conducting the &quot;income\r\n  approach&quot; valuation - normalization.Â  The standards of the AICPA[5],\r\n  by which Appraiser agreed to conduct the valuation, require that in conducting\r\n  the &quot;income approach,&quot; the appraiser must consider\r\n  &quot;normalization adjustments.&quot;[6]Â \r\n  Statement on Standards for Valuation Services: Valuation of a Business,\r\n  Business Ownership Interest, Security, or Intangible Asset Â§ 33 (Am. Inst. of\r\n  Certified Pub. Accountants 2007) [hereinafter &quot;AICPA Standards&quot;][7].Â \r\n  The AICPA Standards define &quot;Normalized Earnings&quot;[8] as &quot;economic benefits adjusted for nonrecurring, noneconomic, or other\r\n  unusual items to eliminate anomalies and/or facilitate comparisons.&quot;   \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the NACVA Standards provide that &quot;historical financial statements should\r\n  be analyzed and, if appropriate, adjusted to reflect the appropriate asset\r\n  value, income, cash flows and/or benefit stream, as applicable, to be\r\n  consistent with the valuation method(s) selected by the member.&quot;Â \r\n  Professional Standards, Â§ 3.9 (Nat'l Ass'n of Certified Valuation Analysts\r\n  2002) [hereinafter &quot;NACVA Standards&quot;].[9]  \r\nIn\r\n  conducting the valuation, Appraiser e-mailed attorneys for Petitioners and\r\n  Respondents and asked them to comment on salaries paid to the shareholders from\r\n  2003-2005 and to state a reasonable compensation for that period.Â  Counsel for\r\n  Respondents replied as follows:  \r\n\r\n\tMy clients' position is that the salaries they\r\n  received were consistent with their contribution to the company.Â  We have\r\n  maintained this position prior to and at the trial of this matter.Â  With that\r\n  said, the judge states in his order that our salaries were in excess of the\r\n  contributions.Â  However, he does not state how excessive.Â  I would suggest\r\n  reviewing the briefs submitted by the two parties on this issue.Â  I believe we\r\n  both made arguments therein.\r\n\tUnless Louis is willing to suggest an amount, it may\r\n  be most helpful for you all to determine what you think may have been\r\n  appropriate for each person and then see if we can agree to that number.\r\n\r\nCounsel for Petitioners responded as follows:\r\n\r\n\tYou have hit on the heart of the issue that was before\r\n  the court.Â  The Plaintiffs contended that the payments to Carver and Windham\r\n  were not for services rendered to the Corporation but rather were simply a\r\n  looting of the corporate profits.Â  The testimony before the court was that\r\n  Carver and Windham were not working for Carolina Mobility but rather were\r\n  spending their time in their other businesses.Â  Carver did do some\r\n  administrative work for Carolina Mobility, primarily paying the bills as she\r\n  controlled the company checkbook.Â  The work Carver did was part time\r\n  administrative work which required only a low skill level.Â  Carver and Windham\r\n  both claimed to be full time employees of Carolina Mobility (TKT) b[ut] the\r\n  Court ruled otherwise.Â  I would refer you to the [sic] Judge Russo's order. . .\r\n  . You should follow Judge Russo's order and while it might be proper to assign\r\n  some value to Carver's services[,] the vast majority of the payment[s] to\r\n  Blackburn,[10] Carver and Windham should be reversed to properly normalize the corporation[']s\r\n  income.\r\n\r\nDespite\r\n  the e-mail exchange with the attorneys, in the final valuation, Appraiser made\r\n  no adjustment for the salaries.Â  On Exhibit 2 of the valuation, \r\nthe entries for\r\n  &quot;Normalizing Adjustments&quot; were filled only with a dash.Â  \r\nAppraiser valued the corporation\r\n  at $34,300 based on the corporation's performance from 2003-2005.  \r\nD.&nbsp; Conclusion  \r\nBy\r\n  failing to make normalizing adjustments, Appraiser did not abide by the\r\n  agreed-upon method in conducting the valuation.Â  Respondents' excessive\r\n  salaries constituted unusual expenses which should have been removed in order\r\n  to appropriately value the corporation.Â  Moreover, Appraiser's failure to\r\n  normalize contradicted Judge Russo's order.Â  As noted, the &quot;income\r\n  approach&quot; provides a method of ascertaining the present value of a\r\n  corporation's expected future earnings.Â  By failing to make adjustments,\r\n  Appraiser effectively rewarded Respondents for their misconduct by factoring\r\n  their unmerited salaries into calculating the corporation's future value.  Â  \r\nWe\r\n  disagree with the conclusion of the Court of Appeals that &quot;no evidence or\r\n  information was proferred&quot; to Judge Nettles &quot;showing the report was\r\n  prepared improperly.&quot;Â  Judge Nettles had before him the Report, which\r\n  showed that the entries for &quot;Normalizing Adjustments&quot; were left\r\n  blank.Â  Moreover, Petitioners argued that the Report was deficient in that it\r\n  contained no normalizing adjustments and offered AICPA Standards, which Judge\r\n  Nettles declined to consider.Â  At a minimum, Petitioners showed Respondents' salaries were excessive\r\n  and some normalization adjustment was required.[11]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the appraisal must be vacated and the Court of Appeals erred in\r\n  upholding the trial court's refusal to do so.[12]  \r\nCONCLUSION  \r\nWe\r\n  find Appraiser violated the agreed-upon method in making the final valuation.Â \r\n  Because the Report did not make any allowance for Respondent's excessive\r\n  salaries, it failed to comply with the &quot;income approach&quot; by failing\r\n  to &quot;normalize&quot; earnings of the corporation.Â  Consequently, we reverse\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand the matter to the circuit court\r\n  which should instruct Appraiser to conduct a new appraisal consonant with Judge\r\n  Russo's order.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Carver testified that Minnich's salary was $31,200.\r\n[2] Though S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-300 allows a court to dissolve a corporation,\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-14-310(d) allows the court to instead order other relief,\r\n  including providing for the purchase at their fair value of shares of any\r\n  shareholder.\r\n[3] Counsel for Petitioners explained that there are three methods for valuating a\r\n  corporation: (1) the asset method; (2) the fair market value method; and (3)\r\n  the income approach.\r\n[4] See Quill v. Cathedral Corp., 627 N.Y.S.2d 157, 159 (N.Y. App.\r\n  Div. 1995) (recognizing that the &quot;investment value&quot; approach is also\r\n  referred to as the &quot;income approach&quot;).\r\n[5] The AICPA Standards were not issued until June 2007 and were not effective\r\n  until January 2008.Â  Nonetheless, the Standards were available in draft form in\r\n  2006 and the Engagement Letter stipulated that they would be used in the\r\n  valuation. \r\n[6] As Judge Nettles noted that Petitioners were &quot;protected on the\r\n  record,&quot; we find the AICPA Standards are properly before us.\r\n[7] The AICPA Standards are available on the AICPA website at:\r\n  http://fvs.aicpa.org/NR/rdonlyres/672E1DD4-2304-47CA-8F34-8C5AA64CB008/0/SSVS_Full_Version.pdf.\r\n[8] The glossary definition of &quot;Normalization&quot; within the AICPA Standards\r\n  provides &quot;see Normalized Earnings.&quot;\r\n[9] The NACVA Standards are available on the NACVA website at:\r\n  http://nacva.com/association/A_pro_stand.asp.\r\n[10] It is unclear why Petitioners' counsel asks that payments to Blackburn be\r\n  reversed.Â  Blackburn did not receive a salary and was only paid when\r\n  distributions were made to the other majority shareholders.\r\n[11] Respondents argue in support of the Court of Appeals opinion that Petitioners\r\n  have not quantified the damages they seek to collect as they failed to offer\r\n  evidence of the amount of salary reduction.Â  We note that, in the e-mail\r\n  response to Appraiser, Petitioners' counsel allowed that Appraiser\r\n  &quot;might&quot; choose to value Carver's services, but made clear that\r\n  Petitioners' position was that a $0 value was warranted under the facts as\r\n  found by Judge Russo.Â  Consequently, in our view, the burden of producing\r\n  evidence setting a value on Respondents' services rested equally, if not\r\n  entirely, with Respondents.\r\n[12] It is possible that Appraiser did consider\r\n  normalization but did not make normalizing adjustments because it considered\r\n  Respondents' salaries appropriate.Â  However, such a finding would directly\r\n  contradict the findings of fact of Judge Russo, who found that the salaries\r\n  were excessive.Â  This position would also require that the appraisal be\r\n  vacated.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26823","title":"State v.

Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330(2)(a) (1977).\r\nThe\r\n  provisions of section 14-3-330, including subsection (2), have been narrowly\r\n  construed, and the immediate appeal of orders issued before or during trial\r\n  generally has not been permitted.Â  Hagood,Â  362 S.C. at 196, 607 S.E.2d\r\n  at 709.Â  &quot;Piecemeal appeals should be avoided and most errors can be\r\n  corrected by the remedy of a new trial.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nIn a case of first\r\n  impression, this Court concluded in Hagood that an order disqualifying a\r\n  party's attorney in a civil case is immediately appealable as it affects\r\n  a substantial rightâ€”the right of a party to have counsel of his or her\r\n  choosingâ€”and could effectively determine the case because it bears upon the\r\n  attorney/client relationship.Â  Id. at 197-98, 607 S.E.2d at 710.Â  \r\nWe explained, &quot;An\r\n  order affects a substantial right and is immediately appealable when it '(a) in\r\n  effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might\r\n  be taken or discontinues the action, (b)&nbsp;grants or refuses a new trial or\r\n  (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any\r\n  action[.]'&quot;Â  Id. at 195, 607 S.E.2d at 709 (quoting S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 14-3-330(2)).Â  \r\nAfter noting there\r\n  is no clear majority view on the appealability of a disqualification order in a\r\n  civil case,[2] we observed that the\r\n  reasons most often cited for concluding such an order is immediately appealable\r\n  &quot;include (1) the importance of the party's right to counsel of his choice\r\n  in an adversarial system; (2) the importance of the attorney-client relationship,\r\n  which demands a confidential, trusting relationship that often develops over\r\n  time; (3) the unfairness in requiring a party to pay another attorney to become\r\n  familiar with a case and repeat preparatory actions already completed by the\r\n  preferred attorney; and (4) an appeal after final judgment would not adequately\r\n  protect a party's interests because it would be difficult or impossible for a\r\n  litigant or an appellate court to ascertain whether prejudice resulted from the\r\n  lack of a preferred attorney.&quot;Â  Id. at 197, 607 S.E.2d at 710.\r\nWe found this\r\n  reasoning persuasive and &quot;conclude[d] an order granting a motion to\r\n  disqualify a party's attorney in a civil case affects a substantial right and may\r\n  be immediately appealed under Section 14-3-330(2).&quot;Â  Id.Â  In\r\n  reaching this conclusion, we reasoned the right to be represented by an\r\n  attorney of one's choosing could, in effect, determine the action, and it is\r\n  closely related to the right to a particular mode of trial, which is an\r\n  established substantial right:\r\n\r\n\tSuch an\r\n  order implicitly falls within the statutory definition of a substantial right\r\n  under Section 14-3-330(2)(a).Â  The right to be represented by an attorney of [one's]\r\n  choosing is one of those rare orders which, in effect, could determine the\r\n  action and prevent a judgment from which an appeal might be taken, or could\r\n  discontinue an action due to the potential impact on both the attorney-client\r\n  relationship and the overall litigation and trial of the case.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  right to be represented by [one's] preferred attorney is closely related to the\r\n  right to a particular mode of trial, a well-established substantial right.\r\n\tDeprivation\r\n  of the right to [one's] preferred attorney would affect the attorney-client\r\n  relationship, which is extremely important in our adversarial system.Â \r\n  Furthermore, an appeal after final judgment and a new trial, if granted, would\r\n  not adequately protect a party's interests because it would be difficult or\r\n  impossible for the affected party or the appellate court to ascertain by any\r\n  objective standard whether prejudice resulted from the disqualification.\r\n\r\nId. at 197-98, 607 S.E.2d at 710.\r\nWe hold the policy\r\n  implications present in Hagood, i.e., the right of a party to retain\r\n  counsel of his or her choosing and the development of an attorney/client\r\n  relationship, are not compelling factors when considering the disqualification\r\n  of an assistant solicitor.Â  The reasons the Court articulated in Hagood as justification for allowing the direct appeal are not present here, as the\r\n  State has no substantial right that has been invaded, and the State's ability to\r\n  appeal has historically been limited in criminal matters.[3]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  appeals in which this Court has considered the issue of disqualification of\r\n  either one solicitor or an entire solicitor's office have been appeals arising after the defendant's conviction, as they are in the posture of the defendant raising\r\n  the issue as a ground for reversal.Â  See, e.g., State v. Patterson,\r\n  324 S.C. 5, 482 S.E.2d 760 (1997); State v. Chisolm,&nbsp;312 S.C. 235,\r\n  439 S.E.2d 850 (1994); State v. Bell, 374 S.C. 136, 646 S.E.2d\r\n  888&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2007), cert. denied (S.C. 2008).Â  This is consistent\r\n  with the general rule that a defendant may not appeal until after he is\r\n  convicted and sentenced.Â  See State v. Miller, 289 S.C. 426, 426,\r\n  346 S.E.2d 705, 705 (1986) (&quot;In South Carolina, a criminal defendant may\r\n  not appeal until sentence has been imposed.&quot;).Â  We see no justification\r\n  for extending different treatment to the State so as to allow direct appeal of\r\n  this pretrial order.\r\nIII.\r\nWe conclude\r\n  a pretrial order disqualifying a prosecuting attorney in a criminal case is not\r\n  directly appealable by the State.Â  Consequently, the State's appeal from the circuit court order\r\n  disqualifying an individual assistant solicitor is dismissed.\r\nAPPEAL\r\n  DISMISSED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J.,Â \r\n  KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority, but\r\n  write separately to reaffirm my view that an order disqualifying an attorney is\r\n  never immediately appealable.Â  Hagood v. Sommerville, 362 S.C. 191, 607\r\n  S.E. 2d 707 (2005) (Pleicones, J., dissenting).Â  I respectfully submit that\r\n  policy does not provide a basis for construing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330 (1976\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2009) differently in an appeal that originates in the court of\r\n  general sessions from one taken from the court of common pleas. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Defense counsel did not move to disqualify\r\n  the entire solicitor's office.\r\n[2]Â  See generally David B. Harrison, Annotation, Appealability\r\n  of State Court's Order Granting or Denying Motion to Disqualify Attorney, 5\r\n  A.L.R.4th 1251 (1981 &amp; Supp. 2009).\r\n[3] Â The denial of a disqualification motion is\r\n  not directly appealable as the ruling does not affect the merits or a party's\r\n  substantial rights, nor does it effectively determine the action, and any error\r\n  in the failure to grant the motion is more amenable to correction through the\r\n  remedy of a new trial.Â  Cf. Townsend v. Townsend, 323 S.C. 309,\r\n  312, 474 S.E.2d 424, 427 (1996) (&quot;A denial of a motion for\r\n  disqualification of a judge is an interlocutory order not affecting the merits\r\n  and, thus, is reviewable only on appeal from a final order.&quot;); Rogers\r\n    v.
