We reverse.\r\n\r\n                                     FACTS\r\nIn 1999 and 2001, John Hollman underwent three laser-assisted in situ\r\nkeratomileusis (LASIK) eye surgeries performed by physician employees of TLC\r\nLaser Eye Centers (Piedmont/Atlanta), LLC, and TLC The Laser Center (Institute),\r\nInc. (appellants). In the next several years, his vision deteriorated. In 2007, he\r\nfiled an action against appellants as well as Dr. Jonathan Woolfson, Dr. Michael A.\r\nCampbell, and others, alleging medical malpractice. His wife, Danielle Hollman,\r\nfiled an action for loss of consortium (both actions hereinafter \"Hollman,\" since\r\nthey have been treated as if consolidated).\r\n\r\nIn the course of discovery, the Hollmans (respondents) became aware that\r\nappellants had compiled a \"Complex Case\" and \"Patient Advocacy\" database.\r\nThey requested that appellants produce the database as well as the medical records\r\nof some nonparty patients. Appellants opposed the request. The trial court ordered\r\nappellants to produce the requested items subject to a protective order designed to\r\nprotect the private health information of nonparty patients from unnecessary\r\nexposure.\r\n\r\nThe protective order defined \"Confidential Health Information\" by reference to\r\nHIPAA definitions of protected information. In addition, it defined as Confidential\r\nHealth Information materials that contained, were based on, or were derived from\r\nsuch Confidential Health Information. The protective order limited use of\r\n\nConfidential Health Information to Hollman1 and limited disclosure to necessary\r\npersonnel in that litigation. It required that, within sixty days after the termination\r\nof the action, all materials designated as Confidential Health Information be\r\nreturned to the producing party or destroyed and all work product materials\r\ncontaining or referring to Confidential Health Information be destroyed.\r\nAppellants thereupon produced the database.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, respondents filed a motion to modify the protective order to permit\r\nrespondents' counsel to contact and interview patients whose confidential health\r\ninformation was contained in the database. The motion was granted. Appellants\r\nfiled a petition for writ of certiorari to this Court, asking the Court to exercise its\r\noriginal jurisdiction on the basis of exceptional circumstances in order to review\r\nthat order. This Court granted the petition, reversed the trial court's order, and\r\nremanded for further proceedings to determine whether the information to be\r\ngained by contacting and interviewing the nonparty patients was both relevant and\r\nnecessary to respondents' claims. On remand, the trial court concluded it was.\r\nThis Court granted appellants' petition for writ of certiorari to review this ruling\r\nand vacated the trial court's order. Hollman v. Woolfson, 384 S.C. 571, 683 S.E.2d\r\n495 (2009).\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, six months after this Court's opinion and while Hollman was still\r\npending in circuit court, respondent John Hollman filed a class action complaint\r\nagainst appellants and many of their employees in United States District Court. In\r\nJune 2010, appellants and respondents entered into a settlement agreement under\r\nwhich they settled all claims in both the state and federal actions. Appellants were\r\ndismissed from Hollman. Respondents' claims against the individual physicians\r\nhad not been settled, so Hollman proceeded without appellants. As a result of the\r\nsettlement, John Hollman withdrew from the federal class action, but a new lead\r\nplaintiff, Dickerson, was substituted, an action contemplated in the settlement.\r\n\r\nIn July 2010, Dickerson moved in the federal class action for precertification\r\ndiscovery to compel production of the database. Contemporaneously, appellants\r\nfiled a notice of motion and motion for rule to show cause, motion to modify the\r\nprotective order, and motion for sanctions in Hollman, although they were no\r\nlonger parties in that action. Appellants cited what they alleged to be persistent,\r\nongoing violations of the protective order by respondents and their counsel.\r\n\r\n\r\n1In addition to the two Hollman actions, the order applied to Carter et ux. v.\r\nNimmons et al. The latter case is not at issue.\r\n\nIn August 2010, the Hollman trial court issued an order denying the motion.\r\nAppellants moved for reconsideration. In November 2010, the trial court held a\r\nhearing on that motion and indicated orally it would be denied. The trial court\r\ninstructed respondents' counsel to draft the order.\r\n\r\nIn April 2011, respondents settled their claims against the remaining state court\r\ndefendants in Hollman. Respondents' counsel wrote a letter to appellants' counsel\r\non April 20, 2011, informing them of the settlement and impending dismissal of\r\nHollman. The letter also indicated that respondents' counsel had not drafted an\r\norder denying appellants' Rule 59(e) motion but were prepared to do so.\r\nAppellants' counsel did not reply. In May 2011, the trial court dismissed Hollman.\r\n\r\nIn September 2011, appellants moved the court to order respondents' counsel to\r\nprepare an order denying appellants' Rule 59(e) motion or, in the alternative, that\r\nthe court prepare such an order. The trial court held a hearing on the motion in\r\nNovember 2011 and, by order of January 2012, denied the motion in part and\r\ngranted it in part. It denied appellants' motion for reconsideration, finding it lacked\r\nsubject matter jurisdiction over appellants' request as a result of the dismissal of the\r\ncase. Notwithstanding this finding, it also held that settlement and dismissal of the\r\ncase operated as a final adjudication, barring further litigation of pre-settlement\r\nviolations of the protective order. It held appellants waived their right to a written\r\norder denying the Rule 59(e) motion by failing to respond to respondents' counsel's\r\nletter advising of the impending dismissal of the case without an order on\r\nappellants' Rule 59(e) motion. Turning to the protective order itself, the trial court\r\nheld it retained jurisdiction to hear appellants' request for return of the database and\r\ngranted their motion to compel observance of the protective order and return of the\r\ndatabase, but subject to conditions it found had been consented to by the parties.\r\nSpecifically, it ordered appellants' counsel to retain all returned database materials\r\nin its office and ordered that all work product materials governed by the protective\r\norder be filed under seal with the trial court until further order. The trial court\r\ndenied appellants' motion for sanctions. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                       ISSUES\r\n      I.\t    Do procedural bars prevent this Court from reviewing the August\r\n             2010 order?\r\n      II.\t   Did the trial court err as a matter of law when it interpreted the\r\n             protective order?\r\n\n                                    DISCUSSION \n\r\nI. Procedural bars\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the trial court erred when it ruled that, because Hollman was\r\ndismissed before an order ruling on appellants' motion for reconsideration was\r\nentered, it lacked jurisdiction to enter such an order. We agree.\r\n\r\nDespite finding it lacked jurisdiction to enter an order ruling on appellants' motion\r\nfor reconsideration, the trial court held it retained jurisdiction to enforce the\r\nprotective order and ruled on the merits of appellants' allegations. This was\r\nobviously correct, since a court that issues a protective order retains jurisdiction to\r\nenforce it notwithstanding the conclusion of the suit in which it was issued. See Ex\r\nparte Bland, 380 S.C. 1, 667 S.E.2d 540 (2008) (finding attorneys willfully\r\nviolated protective order issued in litigation where underlying case had been\r\nsettled); Davis v. Jennings, 304 S.C. 502, 405 S.E.2d 601 (1991) (finding a\r\nnewspaper entitled to intervene where Rule 24, SCRCP, motion was filed one\r\nmonth after case was dismissed with prejudice and record was sealed). This is true\r\nwhether the motion for enforcement of the protective order was made before or\r\nafter the dismissal of the underlying case. Where a timely post-trial motion is\r\nmade seeking issuance of the merits order, the court has jurisdiction to rule on that\r\nmotion as well. Thus, the trial court erred when it ruled it lacked jurisdiction to\r\nenter an order ruling on appellants' motion for reconsideration.\r\n\r\nAppellants also argue many of the findings in the August 2010 order should be\r\nvacated because they deal with matters not raised in the hearing below. Appellants\r\nraised these issues in their Rule 59(e) motion, but the trial court erroneously ruled\r\nit lacked jurisdiction to address them. On remand, the trial court will address the\r\nmerits of the Rule 59(e) motion.\r\n\r\nAppellants also argue that the trial court erred when it held that appellants' failure\r\nto respond to respondents' counsel's letter notifying them of the impending\r\ndismissal of Hollman and five-month delay before they moved for preparation of\r\nan order ruling on their motion for summary judgment in Hollman extinguished\r\ntheir right to seek a written order on their motion for reconsideration. We agree.\r\nAppellants' failure to respond to the letter from respondents' counsel did not affect\r\ntheir right to obtain a written order from the trial court from which they could\r\nappeal. The drafting of the order was under the trial court's supervision.\r\nAssuming a party can waive the right to a written order from which he can appeal\r\nby failing to move the court to draft it after a significant lapse of time, the facts of\r\nthis case do not imply such a waiver.\r\n\nFinally, appellants argue the trial court erred when it ruled the parties' settlement\r\nagreement and resulting dismissal of the action constituted a final adjudication on\r\nthe merits of appellants' contention that respondents were violating the protective\r\norder, barring appellants' motion for rule to show cause. We agree. The trial\r\ncourt's determination that no violations of the protective order took place after the\r\nparties' settlement depends on its construction of the protective order. As\r\ndiscussed below, we conclude that construction was erroneous as a matter of law.\r\n\r\nII. Construction of the protective order\r\n\r\nAppellants argue the circuit court erred when, in its order denying appellants'\r\nmotion for rule to show cause, it held that \"Confidential Health Information\" as\r\ndefined in the protective order refers only to health information coupled with the\r\nidentity of a patient. We agree.\r\n\r\n\"As a general rule, judgments are to be construed like other written instruments.\r\nThe determinative factor is the intent of the court, as gathered, not from an isolated\r\npart thereof, but from all the parts of the judgment itself. Hence, in construing a\r\njudgment, it should be examined and considered in its entirety. If the language\r\nemployed is plain and unambiguous, there is no room for construction or\r\ninterpretation, and the effect thereof must be declared in the light of the literal\r\nmeaning of the language used.\" City of North Myrtle Beach v. East Cherry Grove\r\nRealty Co., LLC, 397 S.C. 497, 503, 725 S.E.2d 676, 679 (2012). A protective\r\norder is analogous to a judgment. The interpretation of the terms of a clear and\r\nunambiguous written instrument is a question of law. See Miles v. Miles, 393 S.C.\r\n111, 117, 711 S.E.2d 880, 883 (2011). Questions of law are reviewed de novo.\r\nCatawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina, supra.\r\n\r\nIn relevant part, the protective order defines \"Confidential Health Information\" as\r\n\r\n      any document or information supplied that identifies an individual or\r\n      subscriber in any manner and relates to the past, present, or future\r\n      payment for the provision of health care to such individual or\r\n      subscriber. The term \"Confidential Health Information\" specifically\r\n      includes \"protected health information\" as such term is defined by the\r\n      Standards for Privacy of Individually Identifiable Health Information,\r\n      45 CFR parts 160 and 164, promulgated pursuant to the Health\r\n      Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996. See 45 C.F.R.\r\n      sections 164.501 (\"protected health information\") and 160.103\r\n      (\"individually identifiable health information\"). \"Confidential Health\r\n      Information\" includes all notes, summaries, compilations, extracts,\r\n\n      abstracts, or oral communications that contain, are based on, or are\r\n      derived from Confidential Health Information.\r\n\r\nThe definition of \"individually identifiable health information\" in 45 C.F.R. §\r\n160.103 provides that\r\n\r\n      \"Individually identifiable health information\" is information that is a\r\n      sub-set of health information, including demographic information\r\n      collected from an individual, and:\r\n      (1) Is created or received by a healthcare provider, health plan, \n\r\n      employer or healthcare clearing house; and \n\r\n      (2) Relates to the past, present or future physical or mental health or\r\n      condition of an individual; the provision of healthcare to an\r\n      individual; or the past, present or future payment for the provision of\r\n      healthcare to an individual; and\r\n             (i) That identifies the individual; or\r\n             (ii) With respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe\r\n             the information can be used to identify the individual.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) The relevant portion of 45 C.F.R. § 164.501 provides a similar\r\nframework. That section defines \"health information\" as\r\n\r\n      any information, including genetic information, whether oral or\r\n      recorded in any form or medium, that:\r\n      (1) Is created or received by a health care provider, health plan, public\r\n      health authority, employer, life insurer, school or university, or health\r\n      care clearinghouse; and\r\n      (2) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or\r\n      condition of an individual, the provision of health care to an\r\n      individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of\r\n      health care to an individual.\r\n\r\nIt further defines \"individually identifiable health information\" as\r\n\r\n      information that is a subset of health information, including\r\n      demographic information collected from an individual, and:\r\n\n      (1) Is created by or received by a health care provider, health plan,\r\n      employer, or health care clearinghouse; and\r\n      (2) Relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or\r\n      condition of an individual; the provision of health care to an\r\n      individual; or the past, present, or future payment for the provision of\r\n      health care to an individual; and\r\n      (i) That identifies the individual; or\r\n      (ii) With respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe the\r\n      information can be used to identify the individual.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added.) The plain language of both regulations indicates that protected\r\ninformation includes any combination of health information collected from an\r\nindividual with respect to which there is a reasonable basis to believe it could be\r\nused to identify the individual. §§ 160.103; 164.501. This definition certainly\r\nincludes compilations of data containing the dates of treatment, diagnosis, type of\r\nsurgery, and treatment providers of appellants' individual patients, for example. It\r\nincludes names of service providers, dates of visits, and diagnostic information\r\nobtained from patients' medical records, even when the patient's name is redacted.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the order's limitations on use and distribution extend to \"all notes,\r\nsummaries, compilations, extracts, abstracts, or oral communications that contain,\r\nare based on, or are derived from Confidential Health Information.\" Under this\r\ndefinition, the contents of the database as a whole must be \"Confidential Health\r\nInformation\" since it is at least a compilation that contains Confidential Health\r\nInformation.\r\n\r\nBecause the trial court's construction of the protective order was improper, its\r\nfinding that the only acts that constituted violations of the protective order\r\noccurred before the 2010 settlement must also be reversed and remanded for\r\nconsideration under the proper construction of the protective order.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\nThe trial court erred when it held it lacked jurisdiction to enter an order ruling on\r\nappellants' motion for reconsideration after the action had been dismissed when a\r\nprotective order governed disclosure of certain materials discovered in that action.\r\nThe trial court also erred when it held that \"Confidential Health Information\"\r\nembraced only information containing both the name and personal health\r\ninformation of a patient. \"Confidential Health Information\" includes any\r\n\ncombination of personal health information derived from appellants' records\r\nregarding which there is a reasonable basis to believe it could be used to identify\r\nthe individual, as well as all summaries, compilations, and extracts derived from\r\nsuch Confidential Health Information. We reverse and remand for further\r\nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\n\r\nREVERSED and REMANDED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE, J., and Acting Justice James E.

The circuit court sentenced\r\nAppellant to life imprisonment. At the time of Appellant's conviction, South\r\nCarolina law provided that an individual serving a life sentence for murder would\r\nbecome eligible for parole following completion of twenty years of her sentence.\r\nAppellant initially appeared before the Board of Probation, Parole, and Pardon\r\nServices (the Parole Board) on July 6, 1997, after completing twenty years of her\r\nsentence through the award of good time credits. The Parole Board denied\r\nAppellant parole following that hearing, and on twelve subsequent occasions.\r\nAppellant's most recent appearance, on January 18, 2012, is at issue here.\r\n\r\n       The Parole Board is comprised of seven members.2 Six of those seven\r\nmembers participated in Appellant's hearing. Four members voted in favor of\r\ngranting Appellant parole, while two members voted against granting parole.\r\nAccording to section 24-21-645 of the South Carolina Code, the Parole Board may\r\nissue an order authorizing parole signed either by a majority of its members or by\r\nall three members meeting as a parole panel; however, at least two-thirds of the\r\nmembers of the Parole Board must authorize and sign orders approving parole for\r\npersons convicted of a violent crime as defined in section 16-1-60 of the South\r\nCarolina Code. S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-645(A) (Supp. 2012). Prior to 1987,\r\nsection 24-21-645 provided that the Parole Board may authorize parole when\r\nauthorized by a majority of its members. See id. § 24-21-645 (Supp. 1984)\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Although two-thirds of the members of the Parole Board participating in\r\nAppellant's hearing voted in favor of parole, the Parole Board ultimately denied\r\nparole. As explained in detail, infra, the Parole Board interprets section 24-21-645\r\nto require an inmate receive a two-thirds majority vote of the Parole Board's seven\r\nmembers, thus meaning Appellant needed five votes, rather than four, to receive\r\n\r\n1The grand jury's indictment alleged that Appellant killed a minor by means of\r\n\"beating, choking, strangling, and drowning.\"\r\n2See S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-10 (2007) (explaining that \"The [Parole Board] is\r\ncomposed of seven members. The terms of office of the members are for six years.\r\nSix of the seven members must be appointed from each of the congressional\r\ndistricts and one member must be appointed at large.\").\r\n\nparole. In denying Appellant's parole, the Parole Board cited the nature,\r\nseriousness, and indication of violence of her offense.\r\n\r\n       Appellant filed a notice of appeal with the ALC, claiming that the Parole\r\nBoard erred by applying the current version of section 24-21-645 instead of the\r\nversion of that statute in effect at the time Appellant committed her crime.\r\nAppellant argued that the version of section 24-21-645 in effect at the time of her\r\nconviction required only a majority of the Parole Board vote in favor of parole, and\r\nthat application of the current version of section 24-21-645, and its two-thirds\r\nrequirement, constituted an ex post facto violation. In the alternative, Appellant\r\nalso asserted that she should receive parole under the current version of section 24-\r\n21-645. According to Appellant, the six members of the Parole Board who\r\nparticipated in her hearing represented a quorum, and she received two-thirds of\r\nthat quorum, satisfying the statutory conditions for parole.\r\n\r\n       The ALC rejected Appellant's claims, holding that retroactive application of\r\nsection 24-21-645's two-thirds requirement did not constitute an ex post facto\r\nviolation, and that the General Assembly intended the term \"members of the\r\nboard\" to indicate members of the full Parole Board, and not members of the\r\nParole Board attending or voting at a parole hearing. Appellant appealed the\r\nALC's order to the court of appeals, and this Court certified the case for review\r\npursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.

S.C. Code Ann. § 1–23–\r\n610(B) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\n      This Court will only reverse the decision of an ALC if that decision is:\r\n\r\n      (a) in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n\r\n      (b) in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n\r\n      (c) made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n\r\n      (d) affected by other error of law;\r\n\r\n      (e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and substantial\r\n          evidence on the whole record; or\r\n\r\n      (f) arbitrary or capricious or characterized by an abuse of discretion\r\n          or clearly unwarranted exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nId. \"The [C]ourt may not substitute its judgment for the judgment of the [ALC] as\r\nto the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.\" Id.

Applicable Law\r\n\r\n      Section 24-21-645 of the South Carolina Code provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      (A) The board may issue an order authorizing the parole which must\r\n      be signed either by a majority of its members or by all three members\r\n      meeting as a parole panel on the case ninety days prior to the effective\r\n      date of the parole; however, at least two-thirds of the members of the\r\n      board must authorize and sign orders authorizing parole for persons\r\n      convicted of a violent crime as defined in Section 16-1-60. A\r\n      provisional parole order shall include the terms and conditions, if any,\r\n      to be met by the prisoner during the provisional period and terms and\r\n      conditions, if any, to be met upon parole.\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-645 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added).3 However, prior to\r\nsection 24-21-645's amendment as part of Act No. 462, the Omnibus Criminal\r\n\r\n\r\n3Section 16-1-60 of the South Carolina Code provides that, \"for purposes of\r\ndefinition under South Carolina law, a violent crime\" includes:\r\n\r\n      murder; attempted murder; assault and battery by mob, first degree,\r\n      resulting in death; criminal sexual conduct in the first and second\r\n      degree and; criminal sexual conduct with minors, first, second, and\r\n      third degree; assault with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct,\r\n      first and second degree; assault and battery with intent to kill; assault\r\n      and battery of a high and aggravated nature; kidnapping; trafficking in\r\n      persons; voluntary manslaughter; armed robbery; attempted armed\r\n      robbery; carjacking; drug trafficking . . . or trafficking cocaine base . .\r\n      . manufacturing or trafficking methamphetamine . . . arson in the first\r\n      degree; arson in the second degree; burglary in the first degree;\r\n      burglary in the second degree; engaging a child for a sexual\r\n      performance; homicide by child abuse; aiding and abetting homicide\r\n      by child abuse; inflicting great bodily injury upon a child; allowing\r\n      great bodily injury to be inflicted upon a child; criminal domestic\r\n      violence of a high and aggravated nature; abuse or neglect of a\r\n      vulnerable adult resulting in death; abuse or neglect of a vulnerable\r\n      adult resulting in great bodily injury; taking of a hostage by an inmate;\r\n      detonating a destructive device upon the capitol grounds resulting in\r\n      death with malice; spousal sexual battery; producing, directing, or\r\n      promoting sexual performance by a child; sexual exploitation of a\r\n      minor first degree; sexual exploitation of a minor second degree;\r\n      promoting prostitution of a minor; participating in prostitution of a\r\n      minor; aggravated voyeurism; detonating a destructive device\r\n      resulting in death with malice; detonating a destructive device\r\n      resulting in death without malice; boating under the influence\r\n      resulting in death; vessel operator's failure to render assistance\r\n      resulting in death; damaging an airport facility or removing equipment\r\n      resulting in death; failure to stop when signaled by a law enforcement\r\n      vehicle resulting in death; interference with traffic-control devices,\r\n      railroad signs, or signals resulting in death; hit and run resulting in\r\n      death; felony driving under the influence or felony driving with an\r\n      unlawful alcohol concentration resulting in death; putting destructive\r\n      or injurious materials on a highway resulting in death; obstruction of a\r\n\nJustice Improvement Act of 1986, the statute did not contain the two-thirds\r\nprovision emphasized above, and provided:\r\n\r\n      The Board may issue an order authorizing the parole which shall be\r\n      signed either by a majority of its members or by all three members\r\n      meeting as a parole panel on the case, ninety days prior to the\r\n      effective date of the parole.\r\n\r\nId. § 24-21-645 (Supp. 1984).\r\n\r\n       The gravamen of Appellant's complaint is that the pre-amendment version of\r\nsection 24-21-645 should apply to her case because she committed her crime prior\r\nto the amendment. Alternatively, Appellant asserts that she should have been\r\ngranted parole even under the amended statute, as both the Parole Board and the\r\nALC interpreted that statute erroneously.\r\n\r\n                             2. Ex Post Facto Violation\r\n\r\n      Appellant argues that the Parole Board's retroactive application of section\r\n24-21-645 constitutes an ex post facto violation, and that the ALC performed a\r\nflawed ex post facto analysis. We agree.\r\n\r\n      The United States and South Carolina Constitutions specifically prohibit the\r\npassage of ex post facto laws. U.S. Const. art. I, §§ 9, 10; S.C. Const. art. 1, § 4.\r\nA measure is an ex post facto law when it retroactively alters the definition of a\r\ncrime or increases the punishment for a crime. Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256,\r\n261, 531 S.E.2d 507, 509 (2000). The relevant inquiry regarding an increase in\r\npunishment is whether a legislative amendment \"produces a sufficient risk of\r\nincreasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes.\" Id.\r\n(quoting Cal. Dep't of Corr. v. Morales, 514 U.S. 499, 509 (1995)). If the\r\namendment produces only a \"speculative and attenuated possibility\" of increasing\r\nan inmate's punishment, then there is no ex post facto violation. Id. Furthermore, a\r\nchange in law that merely affects a mode of procedure, but does not alter\r\nsubstantial personal rights is not ex post facto. State v. Huiett, 302 S.C. 169, 172,\r\n394 S.E.2d 486, 487 (1990) (citing Miller v. Florida, 482 U.S. 423 (1987)). A\r\n\r\n      railroad resulting in death; accessory before the fact to commit any of\r\n      the above offenses; and attempt to commit any of the above offenses.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 16-1-60 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\ncourt should look to the effect of the statute on the \"quantum of punishment\" to\r\ndetermine whether an amendment offends the ex post facto prohibition. Id.\r\n\r\n      The ALC rejected Appellant's claim as speculative, and characterized the\r\ntwo-thirds rule change as \"purely procedural,\" based primarily on a line of cases\r\npreviously analyzed, or decided, by this Court: Morales, supra, Roller v. Gunn,\r\n107 F.3d 227 (4th Cir. 1997), and Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 531 S.E.2d 507\r\n(2000).In Morales, the United States Supreme Court analyzed the California State\r\nLegislature's amendment of a parole statute. A jury convicted Morales of first\r\ndegree murder in 1971. 514 U.S. at 502. While serving his sentence, Morales met\r\nand later married Lois Washabaugh. Id. In April 1980, the state released Morales\r\nto a Los Angeles halfway house. Id. Shortly thereafter, in July 1980, police\r\nrecovered a human hand on a Los Angeles freeway, and fingerprint identification\r\nmatched the hand to Washabaugh. Id. Police never located Washabaugh's body,\r\nbut discovered her car, purse, and credit cards in Morales's possession. Id.\r\nMorales pleaded nolo contendere to second degree murder, and received a\r\nsentence of fifteen years' imprisonment to life. Id. Morales qualified for parole\r\nbeginning in 1990. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Board of Prison Terms (the Board) held a hearing to determine\r\nMorales's suitability for parole. Id. at 502–03. California law required the Board\r\nto set a release date for Morales unless it found public safety required a \"more\r\nlengthy period of incarceration.\" Id. at 503. The Board found Morales unsuitable\r\nfor parole based on numerous reasons including his history of violence and heinous\r\nnature of his offense. Id. The law in place at the time Morales murdered\r\nWashabaugh entitled him to subsequent annual suitability hearings. Id. However,\r\nin 1981, the California legislature authorized the Board to defer subsequent\r\nsuitability hearings for up to three years if the prisoner's previous convictions\r\nincluded more than one offense which involved the taking of a life and if the Board\r\nfound it unreasonable to expect that parole would be granted during the following\r\nyears and stated a basis for that finding. Id. In consideration of the reasons that\r\nled the Board to find Morales unsuitable for parole, the Board determined it\r\nunreasonable to expect Morales would be found suitable for parole in 1990 or\r\n1991, and scheduled Morales's next hearing for 1992. Id.\r\n\r\n      Morales filed a habeas corpus petition asserting that the 1981 amendment, as\r\napplied to him, constituted an ex post facto law. Id. at 504. The United States\r\nCourt of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed, holding that because, \"a prisoner\r\n\ncannot be paroled without first having a parole hearing . . . any retrospective law\r\nmaking parole hearings less accessible would effectively increase the [prisoner's]\r\nsentence and violate the ex post facto clause.\" Id. Accordingly, the Ninth Circuit\r\nheld that the constitution required the Board to provide Morales with annual parole\r\nsuitability hearings, as required by the law in effect at the time he committed his\r\ncrime. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court reversed, rejecting Morales's view that the ex post facto\r\nclause forbids any legislative change that has any conceivable risk of affecting a\r\nprisoner's punishment. Id. at 508–9 (holding that some \"speculative, attenuated\r\nrisk of affecting a prisoner's actual term of confinement by making it more difficult\r\nfor him to make a persuasive case for early release, but that fact alone cannot end\r\nthe matter for ex post facto purposes\"). According to the Supreme Court, the\r\nproper evaluation of the 1981 amendment centered on whether the amendment\r\nproduced a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the\r\ncovered crime. Id. at 509. The Supreme Court noted that the 1981 amendment\r\napplied only to offenders for whom the likelihood of release on parole was quite\r\nremote, and that the legislature intended the amendment to relieve the Board from\r\nthe costly responsibility of scheduling parole hearings for prisoners with little to no\r\nchance of being released. Id. at 510–11 (citing In re Jackson, 703 P.2d 100, 105\r\n(Cal. 1985), relying on California legislative history). Additionally, the\r\namendment did not address initial hearings, only subsequent hearings. Id. at 511.\r\nTherefore, the amendment had no effect on any prisoner unless the Board found\r\nthe prisoner unsuitable for parole, and that it was unreasonable to expect that\r\nparole would be granted at a hearing in the following years. Id. Finally, the\r\nSupreme Court noted that the Board retained the authority to tailor the frequency\r\nof subsequent suitability hearings to the particular circumstances of the individual\r\nprisoner, and therefore, \"the narrow class of prisoners covered by the amendment\r\ncannot reasonably expect that their prospects for early release on parole would be\r\nenhanced by the opportunity of annual hearings.\" Id. at 511–12. In sum, the\r\nSupreme Court held the 1981 amendment created only the \"most speculative and\r\nattenuated risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered\r\ncrime,\" and thus, did not constitute an ex post facto law. Id. at 514.\r\n\r\n      The Morales decision played a critical role in the United States Court of\r\nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit's disposition of the defendant's arguments in Roller\r\nv. Cavanaugh, 984 F.2d 120 (4th Cir. 1993) (Roller I), and Roller v. Gunn, 107\r\nF.3d 227 (4th Cir. 1997) (Roller II).\r\n\n       In 1983, Gary Lee Roller was convicted of voluntary manslaughter and\r\ngrand larceny and sentenced to consecutive terms of thirty years' imprisonment and\r\nfive years' imprisonment. Roller I, 984 F.2d at 121. In December 1990, Roller\r\nfiled a complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 challenging application of the South\r\nCarolina General Assembly's amendments to section 24-21-645 on ex post facto\r\ngrounds. Id. The amendments mandate that a prisoner convicted of committing a\r\nviolent crime may only have her case reviewed biannually after an initial denial,\r\nrather than annually. Id. Additionally, as discussed supra, the amendments\r\nrequire a two-thirds majority of the parole board to authorize parole for violent\r\noffenders rather than a simple majority. Id. The district court found for DPPPS,\r\nbut the Fourth Circuit reversed. See Roller I, 984 F.2d at 124 (\"South Carolina has\r\nundoubtedly applied its new statute to 'alter the conditions of . . . [Roller's]\r\npreexisting parole eligibility.' Indeed, it has effectively 'revoked' eligibility for an\r\nextra year following a denial.\" (alteration in original) (remanding with instructions\r\nto grant declaratory relief in Roller's favor)).\r\n\r\n       However, in April 1995, in light of the Supreme Court's Morales decision,\r\nDPPPS moved for modification of the court order declaring the retrospective\r\napplication of the section 24-21-645 amendments unconstitutional. Roller II, 107\r\nF.3d at 230. In June 1996, based on Morales, the district court concluded that\r\napplication of section 24-21-645 of the South Carolina Code to Roller did not\r\nviolate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Id. (citing Roller v. Gunn, 932 F. Supp. 729, 730\r\n(D.S.C. 1996)). The Fourth Circuit affirmed, holding that South Carolina's\r\namendments bore a \"strong resemblance\" to the California statute sustained in\r\nMorales. Id. at 235. The court noted the similarities between the South Carolina\r\nand California laws, including that neither law increased the actual sentence of\r\nimprisonment and that both laws applied only to prisoners convicted of violent\r\ncrimes, \"prisoners which the South Carolina legislature determined were unlikely\r\nto receive release on parole.\" Id. Additionally, neither law affected the date of any\r\nprisoner's initial parole suitability hearing, only the timing of subsequent hearings,\r\nand did not alter the substantive parole qualification standards. Id. at 235–36.\r\nTherefore, the Fourth Circuit concluded:\r\n\r\n      Roller's claim, however, boils down to mere speculation about his\r\n      release. Such conjecture is insufficient under Morales to establish a\r\n      violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. In South Carolina, the\r\n      determination of parole is subject to the broad discretion of the\r\n      [Parole Board]. Forecasts on how the board might decide to exercise\r\n      its discretion in any given case are merely in the nature of conjecture.\r\n      Roller simply fails \"to provide support for his speculation that . . .\r\n\n       prisoners subject to [24-21-645] might experience an unanticipated\r\n       change that is sufficiently monumental to alter their suitability for\r\n       release on parole.\" Furthermore, as the district court noted, there is\r\n       nothing on the face of section 24-21-645 that limits the [Parole\r\n       Board's] authority to schedule expedited hearings if presented with\r\n       suitable circumstances. In Morales, this same consideration led the\r\n       Supreme Court to conclude that even if a prisoner's circumstances\r\n       drastically changed during the period that his parole hearing had been\r\n       delayed, \"there is no reason to conclude that the amendment will have\r\n       any effect on any prisoner's actual term of confinement.\"\r\n\r\nId. at 236 (alterations in original).\r\n\r\n       The Fourth Circuit also addressed the pertinent issue in the instant case, the\r\ntwo-thirds requirement. Id. The Fourth Circuit analogized that provision to the\r\nstatute examined by the Supreme Court in Dobbert v. Florida, 432 U.S. 282\r\n(1977). In Dobbert, the trial judge overruled the jury's recommendation of life\r\nimprisonment and imposed a death sentence. Id. at 286–87. The defendant\r\nclaimed that the statute which permitted this decision violated the Ex Post Facto\r\nClause because under the pre-amendment statute the jury made the final death\r\npenalty determination. Id. at 287–88, 292. The Supreme Court rejected his claim\r\nas speculative, holding \"it certainly cannot be said with assurance that, had his trial\r\nbeen conducted under the old statute, the jury would have returned a verdict of\r\nlife.\" Id. at 294. In Roller II, the Fourth Circuit viewed the defendant's challenge\r\nof the two-thirds requirement speculative as well, holding:\r\n\r\n       Like the claim of the petitioner in Dobbert, Roller's claim is\r\n       speculative. There is no way of knowing whether a particular board\r\n       member's vote would be the same under the new two-thirds majority\r\n       rule as it would have been under the old rule. As the Supreme Court\r\n       noted in Dobbert, \"[The jurors] may have chosen leniency when they\r\n       knew that that decision rested ultimately on the shoulders of the trial\r\n       judge, but might not have followed the same course if their vote were\r\n       final.\" Similarly, parole board members might be more likely to vote\r\n       for granting parole under the two-thirds rule, knowing that any\r\n       favorable decision must be concurred in by a greater number of their\r\n       colleagues.\r\n\r\nRoller II, 107 F.3d at 236–37 (alteration in original).\r\n\n        The dissent in Roller concluded that South Carolina's amendments differed\r\nsignificantly from the California statute analyzed in Morales. Id. at 238–39 (Hall,\r\nJ., dissenting). For one, the California statute applied only to prisoners \"convicted\r\nof more than one offense involving the taking of a life.\" Id. at 238. However, the\r\nSouth Carolina statute applied to all inmates convicted of a violent crime,\r\nincluding crimes for which only one to ten years' imprisonment is prescribed. Id.\r\nFurthermore, the default requirement under the California statute is annual review,\r\nbut under the South Carolina statute the default requirement is two years, with no\r\nprovision requiring the Parole Board to find that deferral is warranted. Id. at 239.\r\n\r\n       The dissent assessed the two-thirds requirement in conjunction with the\r\nother changes to South Carolina's parole statute. Id. at 239–40 (\"The majority\r\nconsiders this change apart from the other retrospective changes in the statute and\r\ndeclares that any ex post facto challenge is foreclosed . . . As a preliminary matter,\r\nI believe the two-thirds requirement must be considered together with other\r\nchanges to the parole statute.\"). According to the dissent, if the two-thirds\r\nrequirement made parole tougher to attain, the factor must be examined in\r\nconjunction with the amendment's decrease in the frequency of hearings to\r\ndetermine whether the overall changes to the statute violated the Ex Post Facto\r\nClause. Id. at 240. The dissent's ultimate conclusion regarding South Carolina's\r\namended parole statute bears repeating:\r\n\r\n      The majority also notes that Morales compels upholding the two-\r\n      thirds requirement because to do otherwise would amount to the\r\n      judicial \"micromanagement\" that the Court cautioned against.\r\n      Morales does no such thing. The California statute involved an\r\n      exceedingly speculative possibility that the punishment of the affected\r\n      inmates would be increased: The statute applies only to multiple\r\n      murderers, presumably a small fraction of the inmate population; the\r\n      Board has to affirmatively decide that a hearing should be deferred\r\n      and to explain why; the inmate might be able to appeal the deferral\r\n      decision, and the Board could, of its own volition, advance a hearing\r\n      date where a change in circumstances warranted; and, significantly,\r\n      under California's system, the determination of parole suitability often\r\n      precedes the actual release date by several years. South Carolina's\r\n      amendments, on the other hand, affect persons convicted of relatively\r\n      minor crimes; mandate automatic deferrals, with no provision for an\r\n      administrative appeal; increase the percentage of the Board that must\r\n      vote to grant parole. In addition, there is no indication that a grant of\r\n      parole is not ordinarily followed promptly by actual release. If\r\n\n      Morales is our guide, the South Carolina statute increases the\r\n      punishment by decreasing the likelihood of release on parole to a\r\n      degree that offends the Ex Post Facto Clause.\r\n\r\nId.    This Court found the dissent's reasoning persuasive in its analysis of the\r\npetitioner's claim in Jernigan v. State, 340 S.C. 256, 531 S.E.2d 507 (2000). In\r\nthat case, the petitioner filed a post-conviction relief (PCR) action challenging the\r\nchange in his parole review from annually to biannually. Id. at 260, 531 S.E.2d at\r\n509. The Court previously analyzed this parole review change in Gunter v. State,\r\n298 S.C. 113, 378 S.E.2d 443 (1989). In that case, the Court held that \"the\r\nstandards governing petitioner's parole eligibility have not been changed,\" but\r\ninstead, \"only the frequency with which petitioner can be reconsidered for parole\r\nhas been altered.\" Id. at 115–16, 378 S.E.2d at 444.\r\n\r\n       However, the Court overruled Gunter in Griffin v. State, 315 S.C. 285, 433\r\nS.E.2d 862 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1093 (1994). The Griffin court adopted\r\nthe Fourth Circuit's decision in Roller I, finding that the change in biannual review\r\nwas not merely procedural. Griffin, 315 S.C. at 288, 433 S.E.2d at 864 (\"The\r\nFourth Circuit's analysis is compelling. It is difficult to determine where the\r\ndifference lies between a review once every two years and once every eight years.\r\nThis gray area tortures the ex post facto analysis between a change in the standards\r\nfor review and a procedural change in timing.\").\r\n\r\n       In Jernigan, this Court found the Roller II dissent's analysis more persuasive\r\nthan that of the Roller II majority, stating:\r\n\r\n      The South Carolina statute which calls for biannual parole review\r\n      hearings for all violent offenders is clearly distinguishable from the\r\n      very specific statute at issue in Morales. Under South Carolina law,\r\n      there is [sic] a variety of crimes defined as violent, and the possible\r\n      sentences for these crimes range from one year to life imprisonment.\r\n      In Morales, the statute applied to a very well-defined set of inmates—\r\n      multiple killers—while the South Carolina statute applies equally to a\r\n      variety of inmates—from murderers to marijuana traffickers—and\r\n      many of these inmates will likely be paroled at some point.\r\n      Moreover, the South Carolina statute does not require any specific\r\n      findings in order to defer parole review for two years; instead, the\r\n      two-year interval is automatic after an initial denial of parole.\r\n\nJernigan, 340 S.C. at 263–64, 531 S.E.2d at 511. Thus, the Court determined that\r\nthe change from annual parole eligibility review to biannual review produced a\r\nsufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to covered crimes,\r\nand any retroactive application of section 24-21-645 constituted an ex post facto\r\nviolation. Id. at 264–65, 531 S.E.2d at 512 (\"Accordingly this Court's holding in\r\nGriffin v. State, supra, that retroactive application of the statute increasing parole\r\nreview to every two years constitutes an ex post facto violation, remains the law in\r\nSouth Carolina.\").\r\n\r\n       The Jernigan Court did not address section 24-21-645's two-thirds\r\nrequirement. In the instant case, the ALC acknowledged that the Jernigan Court\r\nagreed with the dissent in Roller II regarding biannual review, but held this fact is\r\nnot dispositive of whether the retroactive application of the two-thirds requirement\r\nis also a violation of the Ex Post Facto Clause. According to the ALC, this Court's\r\nJernigan decision concerned the Parole Board's lack of discretion in reviewing\r\nparole for inmates convicted of violent crimes and to whom the Parole Board\r\npreviously denied parole, noting \"[t]here was an automatic increase in review from\r\none year to two, regardless of the nature of the crime for which the inmate was\r\nconvicted, and regardless of the sentence the inmate was serving.\" The ALC found\r\nthat in the instant case, the statutory change in the number of votes to approve\r\nparole has no bearing on how often the Parole Board members voted, and has no\r\nimpact on the discretion of the Parole Board or its decision-making process.4\r\n\r\n4 The ALC also concluded that Appellant's argument required the court to\r\nspeculate how the Parole Board might have voted had section 24-21-645's previous\r\nmajority requirement applied. The apparent root of the ALC's reasoning on this\r\npoint is that there is no way to determine whether Appellant would have received\r\nfour votes from the Parole Board under the prior version of section 24-21-645.\r\nTherefore, Appellant cannot demonstrate that the Parole Board members would\r\nhave voted the same way had they applied the prior version of section 24-21-645 to\r\nAppellant's case. However, the ALC engaged in an expansive speculation\r\nadventure antithetic to the speculation reasoning the United States Supreme Court\r\nexpressed in the Morales and Dobbert decisions. For example, the ALC\r\nconcluded, the Parole Board members may have sensed that the less than two-\r\nthirds of the Parole Board was going to vote for parole, and voted for Appellant to\r\nencourage her to continue her efforts to rehabilitate. However, in Dobbert, the\r\nSupreme Court merely reasoned that the defendant could not show that his\r\npunishment would have been different under a previous version of the statute.\r\nDobbert, 432 U.S. at 294 n.7. In Morales, the Supreme Court discussed simply\r\n\n       We disagree with the ALC's conclusions and hold that this Court's decision\r\nin Jernigan is controlling. The Jernigan Court's rejection of the \"speculation\"\r\nargument regarding biannual review applies with equal force to the two-thirds\r\nrequirement.5 The distinctions between the California statute analyzed in Morales\r\nand the biannual review amendment of section 24-21-645 are evident in the two-\r\nthirds requirement, as well. The two-thirds requirement applies to a wide-variety\r\nof crimes, rather than a well-defined set of inmates, the two-thirds requirement is\r\nthe default provision for all violent crimes regardless of the crime's nature, and the\r\nrequirement compels an offender to convince an additional member of the Parole\r\nBoard. This certainly \"produces a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of\r\npunishment,\" attached to a violent crime. See Jernigan, 340 S.C. at 264–65, 531\r\nS.E.2d at 511–12 (relying on Lynce v. Mathis, 519 U.S. 433, 444–45 (1997), for\r\nthe proposition that if a statute effectively increases the \"quantum of punishment,\"\r\nthen retroactive application is unconstitutional).\r\n\r\n       Moreover, section 24-21-645 contains none of the restraints and safeguards\r\ncritical to the analysis by the majority in Morales, or the dissent in Roller II.6\r\n\r\nthat it was speculative to reason that annual parole hearings would enhance the\r\npossibility of parole by the narrow class of prisoners covered by the statute\r\nanalyzed in that case. Morales, 514 U.S. at 511–12. The ALC's argument does\r\nnot resemble the speculation reasoning of Dobbert or Morales.\r\n\r\n      But, perhaps most troubling about the ALC's speculation is its lack of\r\nsupport in the Record. The rejection letter the Parole Board issued Appellant\r\nmakes no mention of the number of votes she received at her hearing. Moreover,\r\nAppellant's counsel noted at oral argument that inmates are not informed of the\r\nvote outcome from their hearings unless they request a recording of their hearing.\r\nDPPPS did not contradict this assertion.\r\n5Jernigan, 340 S.C. at 264 n.5, 531 S.E.2d at 511 n.5 (\"In any event, more\r\nexpansive rights may be afforded under state constitutional provisions than those\r\nconferred by the federal constitution. Accordingly we find the change in parole\r\nconsideration under § 24-21-645 offends S.C. Const. art. I, § 4, even if the federal\r\nconstitution is not offended.\" (citing State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617\r\n(1997)).\r\n6The ALC found the United States District Court for the District of Maryland's\r\ndecision in Alston v. Robinson, 791 F. Supp. 569 (D.Md. 1992), persuasive. In that\r\ncase, the plaintiffs contended that retrospective application of the requirement that\r\n\n       Simply put, prior to the amendment, Appellant merely needed to obtain\r\nfavorable votes from a majority of the Parole Board. Following the amendment,\r\nAppellant must obtain favorable votes from two-thirds of the Parole Board. This\r\namendment is not procedural, but poses a sufficient risk of increasing the measure\r\nof punishment attached to Appellant's crime and other similarly situated\r\nindividuals. Additionally, this risk is compounded by the Parole Board's position\r\nthat Appellant must convince two-thirds of the entire Parole Board, and not merely\r\nthose members who participate in her hearing.7 Moreover, this change affects an\r\n\r\nseven out of nine members of a parole review board approve leave, work release,\r\nand parole, constituted an ex post facto violation where previously the statute only\r\nrequired a simple majority of a five-member quorum. Id. at 590. The court held\r\nthat although the seven member requirement did appear to make it \"more difficult\"\r\nfor the plaintiffs to achieve parole, the change did not alter the criteria which the\r\nparole review board applied to determine parole eligibility, and this fact rendered\r\nthe change \"very much\" procedural in nature. Id.\r\n\r\n       The ALC's reliance on Alston is misplaced due to that case's primary\r\ndependence on authority evaluating whether a change in the number of jurors\r\nrequired for conviction constitutes an ex post facto violation. The analysis of the\r\ntwo-thirds requirement and a reduction in jury size are not sufficiently similar. As\r\nthe Supreme Court expressed in Williams v. Florida, 399 U.S. 78, 100 (1970), the\r\nprimary concern in evaluating a jury's appropriate composition is to preserve a size\r\nlarge enough to promote group deliberation free from outside intimidation, and\r\nprovide a fair possibility for obtaining a cross-section of the community. These are\r\nclearly not the principal concerns regarding retroactive application of the\r\namendment to section 24-21-645. Instead, as the Court observed in Jernigan, the\r\ncritical question is whether the change creates a reliable risk of increasing the\r\npunishment attached to the inmate's crime. See Jernigan, 340 S.C. at 264–65, 531\r\nS.E.2d at 512 (preventing retroactive application of the change from annual parole\r\neligibility review to biannual review). The Williams Court held that \"neither\r\ncurrently available evidence nor theory suggests that the 12-man jury is necessarily\r\nmore advantageous to the defendant than a jury composed of fewer members.\" See\r\nWilliams, 399 U.S. at 100. It is error to conflate this jury-specific reasoning with\r\nan analysis of section 24-21-645 and its two-thirds requirement.\r\n7Cf. Garner v. Jones, 529 U.S. 244, 255 (2000) (\"When the rule does not by its\r\nown terms show a significant risk, the respondent must demonstrate, by evidence\r\ndrawn from the rule's practical implementation by the agency charged with\r\n\ninmate's substantial personal right to statutorily correct parole review. See Cooper\r\nv. S.C. Dep't of Prob., Parole, and Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 489, 499, 661 S.E.2d\r\n106, 111–12 (2008) (\"Parole is a privilege and Cooper has no right to be paroled;\r\nhowever, Cooper does have a right to require the [Parole Board] to adhere to\r\nstatutory requirements in rendering a decision.\" (alteration added)).\r\n\r\n       It is clearly more difficult to convince a two-thirds majority of the Parole\r\nBoard to grant parole, than a simple majority, and the identical issues posed by\r\nretroactive application of the biannual review procedure apply similarly to the two-\r\nthirds requirement. 8     3. The Meaning of \"Two-Thirds\"\r\n\r\n      Appellant argues that the ALC's construction of section 24-21-645 is\r\nerroneous and should be rejected. We agree.\r\n\r\n      Statutory interpretation is a question of law subject to de novo review. Town\r\nof Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41\r\n\r\nexercising discretion, that its retroactive application will result in a longer period of\r\nincarceration than under the earlier rule. The litigation in Morales concerned a\r\nstatute covering inmates convicted of more than one homicide and proceeded on\r\nthe assumption that there were no relevant differences between inmates for\r\npurposes of discerning whether retroactive application of the amended California\r\nlaw violated the Ex Post Facto Clause. In the case before us, respondent must\r\nshow that as applied to his own sentence the law created a significant risk of\r\nincreasing his punishment.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n8 DPPPS also argues that because Appellant pled guilty and received a sentence of\r\nlife imprisonment, retroactive application of section 24-21-645 could not increase\r\nher punishment because, \"the extent of her punishment is that she would spend the\r\nrest of her life in prison.\" This argument is without merit. At the time of\r\nAppellant's sentencing a person imprisoned for life would become eligible for\r\nparole after serving twenty years of her sentence. Moreover, the nature of parole is\r\nearly release from imprisonment. The rationale asserted by DPPPS would\r\nforeclose all ex post facto claims by potential parolees given that the true extent of\r\ntheir \"punishment,\" or imprisonment, has not yet been completed. This view of\r\nparole and ex post facto law is untenable and more importantly, legally\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\n(2008) (citation omitted). \"The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to\r\nascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.\" Media Gen.

Where the statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and\r\nconveys a clear, definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not\r\nneeded and the court has no right to impose another meaning.

Code Ann. § 24-21-\r\n10(B) (Supp. 2012). Section 24-21-645 of the South Carolina Code provides that\r\nthe Parole Board may issue an order authorizing parole signed by either a majority\r\nof its members or by all three members meeting as a panel. Id. § 24-21-645 (Supp.\r\n2012). However, \"at least two-thirds of the members of the [Parole Board] must\r\nauthorize and sign orders authorizing parole for persons convicted of a violent\r\ncrime as defined in section 16-1-60 of the South Carolina Code.\" Id. Section 24-\r\n21-645 does not specify a quorum for Parole Board meetings but \"in the absence of\r\nany statutory or other controlling provision, the common-law rule that a majority\r\nof the whole board is necessary to constitute a quorum applies, and the board may\r\ndo no valid act in the absence of a quorum.\" Garris v. Governing Bd. of S.C.\r\nReins. Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 453, 511 S.E.2d 48, 59 (1998) (emphasis added); see\r\nalso James v. S.C. Dep't of Prob., Parole, and Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 564, 569,\r\n660 S.E.2d 288, 291 (Ct. App. 2008) (\"Here, five members of the [Parole Board]\r\nwere present, and each voted to deny . . . parole. A unanimous and majority\r\ndecision was reached by a quorum in this hearing.\" (alterations added)).\r\n\r\n      Appellant interprets \"members of the board\" in section 24-21-645 to mean\r\nthose members of the Parole Board present and voting at a parole hearing.\r\n\nAppellant argues that conversely, her interpretation does not include members who\r\ndid not attend the hearing. DPPPS counters that, even though a quorum of the\r\nParole Board is all that is required to conduct business, the statute's \"members of\r\nthe board\" language means that an inmate convicted of a crime must get at least\r\ntwo-thirds of the seven members of the Parole Board.\r\n\r\n       The ALC agreed with DPPPS, and held that \"members of the board\"\r\nconnotes the entire seven members of the Parole Board. According to the ALC,\r\nbecause section 24-21-10(B) of the South Carolina code defines the Parole Board\r\nas composed of seven members, section 24-21-645(A)'s two-thirds requirement\r\npertaining to \"members of the board,\" means that an inmate convicted of a violent\r\ncrime must obtain favorable votes from at least two-thirds of the seven Parole\r\nBoard members. The ALC reasoned that the portion of section 24-21-645(A)\r\npermitting the Parole Board to authorize parole for non-violent offenses by simple\r\nmajority when read in conjunction with the two-thirds requirement demonstrates\r\nthat the General Assembly \"meant for the term 'members of the board' to mean\r\nmembers of the full Parole Board, and not members of the [Parole Board]\r\nattending or voting at a parole hearing.\" The ALC's interpretation is wrong.\r\n\r\n       Section 24-21-645 is ambiguous, and thus susceptible to more than one\r\ninterpretation. Obviously, the statute can be read to mean that an offender must\r\nreceive votes from two-thirds of the members of the entire Parole Board, regardless\r\nof how many members actually attend a hearing. However, as Appellant notes, the\r\nterms \"majority\" and \"two-thirds\" as utilized by section 24-21-645 are not static\r\nterms, and their meaning changes depending on their application. Thus, the fact\r\nthat the General Assembly used such terms does not evince intent to require\r\ninmates convicted of violent offense to obtain favorable votes from five members\r\nof the Parole Board regardless of the actual composition of the Parole Board at the\r\ninmates hearing.9\r\n\r\n\r\n9Comparison with section 24-21-30 of the South Carolina Code is instructive.\r\nSection 24-21-30 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      (B) The board may grant parole to an offender who commits a violent\r\n      crime as defined in Section 16-1-60 which is not included as a \"no\r\n      parole offense\" as defined in Section 24-13-100 on or after the\r\n      effective date of this section by a two-thirds majority vote of the full\r\n      board. The board may grant parole to an offender convicted of an\r\n      offense which is not a violent crime as defined in Section 16-1-60 or a\r\n\n       Requiring Appellant to only obtain votes from Parole Board members\r\nactually present at her hearing comports with the common meaning and\r\nunderstanding of the term \"quorum.\" In the absence of a controlling provision, the\r\ncommon-law rule that a majority of the whole board is necessary to constitute a\r\nquorum applies. Garris, 333 S.C. at 453, 511 S.E.2d at 59. Section 24-21-645\r\ndoes not specify the number of Parole Board members that must review the parole\r\n\r\n      \"no parole offense\" as defined in Section 24-13-100 by a unanimous\r\n      vote of a three-member panel or by a majority vote of the full board.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-30 (2007) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       The parties agree that although section 24-21-30 and section 24-21-645 are\r\nsimilar, the latter statute controls the instant case. Section 24-21-645 speaks\r\ndirectly to \"Parole and provisional orders,\" within the context of a review schedule\r\nfollowing \"parole denial of prisoners confined for violent crimes.\" S.C. Code Ann.\r\n§ 24-21-645 (Supp. 2012). Section 24-21-30 does not contain this language, and is\r\nentitled \"Meetings; parole and pardon panels.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 24-21-30 (Supp.\r\n2012). It is conceivable that the General Assembly included the \"full board\"\r\nlanguage to address parole orders under section 24-21-30, but expressly did not\r\ninclude this language in section 24-21-645 in providing direction to the Parole\r\nBoard in addressing those inmates convicted of a violent crime that had previously\r\nbeen denied parole by the \"full board.\" Regardless, it is clear that the General\r\nAssembly did not include the term \"full board\" in section 24-21-645 or 24-21-650,\r\nbut included the term in section 24-21-30. See id. § 24-21-650 (explaining the\r\nissuance of an order of parole). Furthermore, the General Assembly amended\r\nsection 24-21-30 in 1995, ten years following section 24-21-645's amendment. See\r\nid. § 24-21-30 (Supp. 1995) (\"From and after January 1, 1996, this section reads as\r\nfollows.\"). These facts weigh in favor of construing section 24-21-645 as not\r\nrequiring an inmate convicted of a violent crime to obtain favorable votes from\r\ntwo-thirds of the seven-member Parole Board, but instead to obtain only two-thirds\r\nof those members of the Parole Board participating in a particular hearing. See\r\nState v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 650, 659 S.E.2d 101, 105 (2008) (\"As with any\r\nstatute that is penal in nature, the Court must construe it strictly in favor of the\r\ndefendant and against the State.\"); Hair v. State, 305 S.C. 77, 79, 406 S.E.2d 332,\r\n334 (1991) (construing in favor of the defendant the different time frames for\r\nparole eligibility found in the general parole statute and in a statute regarding\r\nparole eligibility for burglary).\r\n\nsuitability of an inmate convicted of a violent crime, but also does not expressly\r\nexclude the common-law quorum principle. See, e.g., Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C.\r\n463, 473, 605 S.E.2d 556, 561 (Ct. App. 2004), aff'd, 373 S.C. 90, 645 S.E.2d 245\r\n(2007) (\"[A] statute is not to be construed in derogation of common law rights if\r\nanother interpretation is reasonable.\" (alteration added)). Thus, the statute does not\r\ndemonstrate the General Assembly's intent to frustrate the ability of a valid DPPPS\r\nquorum to execute the statutory duties of the department.\r\n\r\n       We agree with Appellant's contention that the interpretation advanced by\r\nDPPPS invites absurd results. For example, if the Parole Board reviewing the\r\nparole suitability of an inmate convicted of a violent crime consisted of only four\r\nmembers, a unanimous decision to grant parole would nonetheless result in a\r\nparole denial.10 Essentially, the current DPPPS interpretation treats non-\r\nparticipating members of the Parole Board as \"no\" votes. DPPPS fails to present\r\nany authority for what is the illogical position that the General Assembly intended\r\nfor non-participating Parole Board members to arbitrarily count against inmates\r\n\r\n10The ALC observed that \"there is no evidence that the [Parole Board] has ever\r\neven met with fewer than five members when considering the parole of an inmate\r\nconvicted of a violent crime.\" However, the ALC observed that the Parole Board\r\ncould meet with only four of the seven members. Regarding this hearing\r\nconfiguration the ALC determined:\r\n\r\n      If a vote of only four members present ever took place in the case of\r\n      an inmate convicted of a violent crime, the result would presumably\r\n      be a denial of parole for that inmate, as the court in James [v. S.C.\r\n      Dep't of Prob., Parole, and Pardon Servs., 377 S.C. 564, 569, 660\r\n      S.E.2d 288, 291 (Ct. App. 2008)] points out that though a two thirds\r\n      majority of the full [Parole Board] is required to grant parole of a\r\n      violent crime falling under section 16-1-60, there is no statutory\r\n      requirement \"that a certain number of board members . . . be present\r\n      in order to deny parole for someone convicted of a violent crime.\"\r\n\r\n(alterations added). Thus, under the ALC's own interpretation of section 24-21-\r\n645, any hearing convened by a quorum of the Parole Board is an automatic denial\r\nof parole for an inmate convicted of a violent crime. The ALC erred in failing to\r\nrecognize the legal infirmity of a statutory interpretation that even allowed the\r\npossibility that a simple meeting of a valid quorum of the Parole Board resulted in\r\nthe automatic denial of an inmate's parole.\r\n\nconvicted of a violent crime, or that the General Assembly intended for a meeting\r\nof the Parole Board convened with only a quorum to result in a continuous denial\r\nof parole to inmates convicted of a violent crime. Put another way, DPPPS fails to\r\nbring forward any rationale as to why absent Parole Board members could not just\r\nas well be treated as \"yes,\" votes.11\r\n\r\n       The ALC erred in interpreting section 24-21-645's two-thirds provision to\r\nrequire Appellant to obtain five votes instead of four. The ALC's interpretation\r\nautomatically views non-participating Parole Board members as \"no\" votes, and\r\nignores the fact that Appellant obtained favorable votes from two-thirds of the\r\nParole Board members participating in her hearing. This interpretation of section\r\n24-21-645 is out of step with this Court's rules of statutory construction.\r\nMoreover, if the General Assembly intended for section 24-21-645 to require\r\ninmates convicted of a violent crime to obtain approval from two-thirds of the\r\n\"full\" Parole Board, the statute would contain language to that effect. Appellant\r\nobtained favorable votes from two-thirds of the Parole Board and should have been\r\ngranted parole even if section 24-21-645 is applied retroactively.\r\n\r\n                                  CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n       We hold that retroactive application of section 24-21-645 constitutes an ex\r\npost facto violation, and inmates convicted of a violent crime must only convince\r\ntwo-thirds of the Parole Board members participating in their hearing. Appellant\r\nreceived the requisite number of votes from the Parole Board, and thus, should be\r\ngranted parole. Thus, we remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nThe ALC's decision is therefore,\r\n\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result in\r\na separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J., concurring in result in a separate\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n11 A hypothetical application of the Parole Board's interpretation to a wider context\r\ntruly demonstrates its absurdity. For example, the South Carolina Constitution\r\nprovides that \"a majority of each house shall constitute a quorum to do business.\"\r\nS.C. Const. art. III, § 11. The Parole Board's view of a quorum would treat those\r\nmembers of each house who are not present as \"no\" votes, effectively frustrating\r\nthe ability of the quorum to act.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I concur in result. I agree that \"two-thirds of the\r\nmembers of the board\" in § 24-21-645 means two-thirds of the members\r\nparticipating in the hearing. This interpretation of § 24-21-645 resolves the case\r\nbefore us. It has long been this Court's policy to decline to rule on constitutional\r\nissues unless they are essential to the disposition of the case.

I join the majority's construction of\r\nsection 24-21-645 of the South Carolina Code, specifically as to the meaning of\r\n\"two-thirds.\" Appellant received the requisite two-thirds approval and should be\r\nparoled.\r\n\r\nI disagree, however, that the statutory change from a majority to two-thirds\r\nconstitutes an ex post facto violation. I view the statutory amendment as merely a\r\nprocedural change. See, e.g., Alston v. Robinson, 791 F. Supp. 569 (D. Md. 1992)\r\n(finding statutory revision requiring a larger percentage of members of the parole\r\nboard to approve prisoner leave, work release and parole was a procedural change\r\nthat did not substantially alter prisoners' quantum of punishment, and therefore, its\r\nretroactive application did not violate the Ex Post Facto Clause); Arizona ex rel.\r\nGonzalez v. Superior Court, 907 P.2d 72, 74 (Ariz. 1995) (holding that the\r\nlegislature's alteration of the vote requirement for parole does not violate ex post\r\nfacto constitutional principles, for although it \"may diminish [a prisoner's] ability\r\nto achieve parole,\" the amended statute does not affect the quantum of punishment\r\nand \"has not newly criminalized his acts, enhanced his punishment, or altered the\r\nlegal rules of evidence\").\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27282","title":"Wachovia Bank v.

(Petitioner) committed the\r\nunauthorized practice of law in closing a home equity loan in 2001, and that\r\nPetitioner's unclean hands barred it from any equitable relief. We affirm as\r\nmodified.          FACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n\r\n        In 2001, Michael Coffey (Husband) obtained a home-equity line of credit\r\nfrom Petitioner. Husband signed a mortgage prepared by Petitioner's employees\r\nthat purported to encumber Husband's Hilton Head Island home (the property).\r\nThe mortgage contained the express language that Husband lawfully owned the\r\nproperty, and held the right to mortgage the property. However, Husband did not\r\npossess any interest in the property. In fact, Ann Coffey (Wife) held sole title to\r\nthe property. Wife did not participate in the loan transaction and had no\r\nknowledge of Husband's transaction with Petitioner. Petitioner did not perform a\r\ntitle search to determine ownership of the property at time of the transaction.\r\nAdditionally, Petitioner prepared the loan documents and closed the loan\r\ntransaction without the participation or supervision an attorney licensed to practice\r\nlaw in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n       Husband subsequently purchased a sailboat, and financed the purchase\r\nthrough a $125,000 draw on the line of credit. Husband placed title to the sailboat\r\nin the name of A&M Partners, a corporation Husband and Wife jointly owned, and\r\nof which they served as President and Vice-President, respectively. Husband made\r\nregular payments on the line of credit from July 2001 until his death on March 21,\r\n2005. Husband made these payments using funds from a personal checking\r\naccount he shared with Wife. Following Husband's death, Wife continued making\r\nmonthly payments using the same checking account. In September 2005, Wife\r\ndiscovered documents showing a loan or mortgage on the sailboat. Wife wrote\r\n\"boat loan,\" or \"boat\" on the memo line of at least three checks she sent to\r\nWachovia in September and November 2005.\r\n\r\n       That same year, Wife also began efforts to sell the boat with the assistance\r\nof her daughter, Maureen Coffey-Edri (Daughter). In December 2005, Daughter\r\nprovided St. Barts Yachts (St. Barts), a yacht broker, with loan information for the\r\nsailboat showing a payoff amount due to Petitioner in the amount of $125,643.30.\r\nAn employee of St. Barts prepared a draft \"Seller's Disbursement Summary,\"\r\nshowing a sale price of $112,000, with a $125,600 \"payoff\" to Petitioner. This\r\npayoff amount required a balance due from Wife of $25,525. However, when\r\n\nWife asked a St. Barts employee to check on the status of the loan, the employee\r\ninformed her that there was no lien or mortgage on the sailboat. Wife believed the\r\nsailboat was \"paid for,\" and never inquired with Petitioner about the line of credit\r\nor any other possible encumbrances on the sailboat. Wife sold the sailboat in\r\nJanuary 2006 for $112,000 and received $100,075 from the sale. Wife deposited\r\nthe proceeds in her personal bank account and did not make any further payments\r\nto Petitioner.\r\n\r\n       In June 2006, Petitioner filed a foreclosure action in the circuit court against\r\nHusband's estate, Wife, both individually and as personal representative of\r\nHusband's estate, and three of the couple's five children. In September 2006, Wife\r\nfiled an inventory and appraisal of Husband's estate with the Beaufort County\r\nProbate Court. This inventory and appraisal acknowledged Husband and Wife's\r\njoint ownership of the boat. Petitioner then filed an amended complaint in 2008\r\nnaming Wife and Bank of America, N.A. as the only defendants. Petitioner sought\r\nto foreclose on the mortgage signed by Husband and included causes of action for\r\nequitable lien, prejudgment interest, restitution, ratification, quantum meruit, and\r\nquasi-contract. Petitioner filed a motion for summary judgment, and Wife filed a\r\ncross-motion for summary judgment on all of Petitioner's claims.\r\n\r\n        The master-in-equity denied Petitioner's motion for summary judgment on\r\nits claims against Wife, and granted Wife summary judgment on all of the claims\r\nasserted by Petitioner. The master-in-equity held, inter alia:\r\n\r\n      I am troubled by the concept that [Wife] sold the sailboat and retained\r\n      the proceeds and that there is some perception of unfairness to\r\n      Petitioner. However, in this court's opinion, Petitioner is the architect\r\n      of its own problem. Petitioner prepared the loan documents and\r\n      closed the loan with Husband without an attorney. Had Petitioner\r\n      retained an attorney to prepare the loan documents and performed a\r\n      title search, which should have been done, it would have known\r\n      Husband did not own the subject [p]roperty to be mortgaged. This\r\n      case would not have been filed and Petitioner's mistake would have\r\n      been caught. It now attempts to seek equitable relief for its own\r\n      mistake. Its own mistake arose by its own acts.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\n       Petitioner appealed, and the court of appeals affirmed. Wachovia Bank, N.A.\r\nv. Coffey, 389 S.C. 68, 698 S.E.2d 244 (Ct. App. 2010). The court of appeals held\r\n\nthat Petitioner's actions constituted the unauthorized practice of law, and therefore,\r\nbarred its equitable and legal claims. Id. at 76–77, 698 S.E.2d at 248 (\"We\r\ntherefore reach the inescapable conclusion that [Petitioner] has come to court with\r\nunclean hands and is barred from seeking equitable relief . . . . [Petitioner's] legal\r\ncauses of action are barred as well.\") (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n    This Court granted Petitioner's request for certiorari pursuant to Rule 242,\r\nSCACR.                          ISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  I.\t   Whether the court of appeals erred in holding that Wachovia was on \n\r\n        notice that its conduct constituted the unauthorized practice of law and \n\r\n        that Wachovia had unclean hands. \n\r\n\r\n II.\t   Whether the court of appeals erred in stating that Petitioner's legal \n\r\n        remedies were barred. \n\r\n\r\nIII.\t   Whether the holding of the court of appeals conflicts with that court's\r\n        prior holding that a trial court does not have jurisdiction to determine\r\n        the unauthorized practice of law.\r\n\r\n                             STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n\r\n       \"An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment under the\r\nsame standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56, SCRCP.\" Quail Hill, LLC\r\nv. Cnty. of Richland, 387 S.C. 223, 235, 692 S.E.2d 499, 505 (2010) (citation\r\nomitted). Rule 56, SCRCP provides that summary judgment is proper \"if the\r\npleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together\r\nwith the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material\r\nfact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.\" Rule\r\n56(c), SCRCP. \"In determining whether any triable issue of fact exists, the\r\nevidence and all inferences which can reasonably be drawn therefrom must be\r\nviewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.\" Quail Hill, LLC, 387\r\nS.C. at 235, 692 S.E.2d at 505. (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n                                   LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n\r\n       Petitioner's arguments, and to a significant degree the lower court decisions\r\nin this case, center on whether Petitioner's alleged unauthorized practice of law\r\n\nbars equitable and legal relief. However, this is not the dispositive question in this\r\ncase. Instead, the pertinent inquiry is whether Petitioner may foreclose on an\r\ninvalid mortgage.\r\n\r\n        As explained, supra, Husband obtained a $125,000 home equity line of\r\ncredit from Petitioner, and secured the loan with the couple's residence, which was\r\ntitled in Wife's name only. Petitioner failed to verify Husband's interest in the\r\ncouple's residence. Therefore, Petitioner never possessed a valid mortgage on the\r\nproperty and cannot pursue an action against Wife related to that mortgage. See,\r\ne.g., Hayne Fed. Credit Union v. Bailey, 327 S.C. 242, 248, 489 S.E.2d 472, 475\r\n(1997) (\"A mortgage foreclosure is an action in equity.\").1\r\n                                                            \r\n1 We respectfully disagree with the dissent's view that Petitioner may rely on\r\nequitable principles to foreclose on an invalid mortgage. One of equity's most\r\nimportant aspects is the principle of \"right and fair dealing,\" between parties to\r\nparticular transaction. See, e.g., Kelly v. McCray, 278 S.C. 88, 90, 292 S.E.2d 587,\r\n589 (1982) (agreeing with the lower court that equity prevented the respondent\r\nfrom rendering her own agreement unenforceable). However, equitable maxims\r\ndo not operate to place burdens on individuals made party to a particular\r\ntransaction through no fault or expressed interest of their own, or, as in this case,\r\nthrough the fault and mistake of others. Cf. Henry L. McClintock, McClintock on\r\nEquity, at 52 (2d. 1948) (listing the equitable maxims, \"(1) equity regards as done\r\nwhat ought to be done; (2) equity looks to intent, rather than to form; . . . [(3)]\r\nequity imputes an intention to fulfill an obligation; [(4)] equity will not suffer a\r\nwrong without a remedy; and [(5)] equity follows the law.\" (citation omitted)\r\n(alterations added)); see also Regions Bank v. Wingard Props. Inc., 394 S.C. 241,\r\n249, 715 S.E.2d 348, 352 (Ct. App. 2011) (\"Maxims developed, at least in part, to\r\nreflect the attempt by the courts of equity to create guiding principles, in the same\r\nway that the legal courts developed binding precedent.\").\r\n\r\n       We do not agree with the view that what \"ought to be done\" is to place\r\nresponsibility for Petitioner's mistake on to Wife. The dissent offers an incorrect\r\nsummation of today's decision, stating that we find Petitioner is not entitled to\r\nequitable relief because of a mere \"mistake.\" To the contrary, equity should not be\r\nused to validate Husband's decision to mortgage a property for which he held no\r\ninterest, and Petitioner's choice to simply take Husband at his word, and then\r\nattempt to charge Wife with responsibility for that blunder. This finding comports\r\nwith well-settled equitable principles and poses no new \"bar\" or \"universal rule\" as\r\nthe dissent asserts.\r\n\n      Thus, the master-in-equity properly granted summary judgment in favor of\r\nWife. We need not discuss the remaining issues presented by the parties. See\r\nFutch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 518 S.E.2d 591\r\n(1999) (providing that an appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\nresolution of a prior issue is dispositive).\r\n\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the court of appeals decision is\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nBEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a\r\nseparate opinion in which HEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                               \r\n       The dissent focuses too narrowly on the notion that Petitioner committed an\r\n\"error,\" to the exclusion of Petitioner's and Husband's actual conduct in this case.\r\n\r\n       We stress that sophisticated financial institutions that prepare mortgages\r\npurporting to encumber a customer's property must ensure that the customer in fact\r\nholds a legal interest in that property so as to protect all pertinent interests.\r\nConcomitantly, South Carolina courts should not stretch equitable principles to\r\nunfairly place fault on parties who did not contribute to the underlying transaction.\r\nSee, e.g., McClintock on Equity, at 320 (\"Where the parties have manifested an\r\nintention that the real property of one of them shall be especially set aside as\r\nsecurity for the payment of an obligation due to the other, equity will give effect to\r\nthe intention by treating the property as though it had been validly mortgaged.\"\r\n(emphasis added)). We earnestly appreciate the dissent's concerns. However, we\r\nwould be more concerned with an equitable doctrine so broad as to allow lenders\r\nto ameliorate their complete failure to exercise proper due diligence at the expense\r\nof third parties.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully dissent and would remand the matter to\r\nthe Court of Appeals. Petitioner (Wachovia) sought to recover the proceeds from\r\nrespondent Coffey's sale of the boat under several equitable theories: mortgage\r\nforeclosure, unjust enrichment, equitable mortgage, restitution, ratification,\r\nquantum merit, or quasi-contract. While the majority may well be correct that\r\nWachovia's foreclosure action fails because the purported mortgage was invalid, it\r\nis the unavailability of recovery under that cause of action that is the predicate for\r\nWachovia's other theories. In footnote 1, the majority makes explicit its\r\nphilosophy that equity acts to punish those who make a mistake. See also Matrix\r\nFin. Servs. Corp. v. Frazer, 394 S.C. 434, 714 S.E.2d 532 (2011). In my view,\r\nequity exists to correct mistakes and prevent windfalls. E.g., McNair v. Rainsford,\r\n330 S.C. 332, 499 S.E.2d 488 (Ct. App. 1998) (unjust enrichment/constructive\r\ntrust used to recover money from innocent third party where third party would be\r\nunjustly enriched by a windfall actually owed to plaintiff). The majority offers no\r\nexplanation why the lender should be denied the opportunity to recover the money\r\nit lent other than that it made an error.\r\n\r\nWe granted certiorari to review a Court of Appeals' decision that affirmed the trial\r\ncourt's grant of summary judgment to respondent. The Court of Appeals held that\r\nbecause Wachovia committed the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) in closing a\r\nhome equity loan in 2001, its unclean hands barred it from any equitable relief.\r\nFurther, the Court of Appeals held Wachovia's UPL barred it from any legal\r\nremedies. I would reverse the equitable ruling under BAC Home Loan Servicing\r\nLP v. Kinder, 398 S.C. 619, 731 S.E.2d 547 (2012), which clarified that UPL bars\r\nequitable remedies2 only when the transaction occurred after August 8, 2011.\r\nFurther, I would vacate the dicta stating that UPL also bars Wachovia from any\r\nlegal relief, as no legal relief was sought by Wachovia in this case. Since the trial\r\ncourt's order granting respondent summary judgment on Wachovia's theories of\r\nunjust enrichment/restitution/quasi-contract, mortgage ratification and foreclosure,\r\nequitable lien, and prejudgment interest rest on several grounds other than UPL, I\r\n\r\n                                                            \r\n2It is with some irony I note that the UPL ruling announced in Matrix Fin. Serv.\r\nCorp. v. Frazer, 394 S.C. 134, 714 S.E.2d 532 (2001) is intended to protect\r\nborrowers from lenders. Here, viewing the facts in the light most favorable to\r\nWachovia, it appears the lender was taken advantage of by a long-time client.\r\n\nwould remand the case to the Court of Appeals to consider the issues raised by\r\nWachovia on appeal but left unaddressed by its original decision.\r\n\r\nThe majority holds Wachovia is not entitled to equitable relief because it made a\r\nmistake. I cannot tell whether this new bar is applicable only to commercial\r\nlenders, or if it is a universal rule. Further, the majority leaves standing the dicta in\r\nthe Court of Appeals' opinion to the effect that UPL bars a lender from legal as\r\nwell as equitable remedies. While I am concerned about the impact of the\r\nmajority's decision on lenders especially, I am even more apprehensive about its\r\nimpact on the status of equity generally in South Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEARN, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27283","title":"Turner v.

Because the presumed facts of this case\r\nfall outside the clear language of section 62-2-302(b), the probate court, and the\r\ncircuit court on review, correctly dismissed Appellant's claim. We affirm.\r\n\n                                          I. \n\r\n\r\nIn July 2008, Decedent Robert L. Gilmore (\"Decedent\") executed his Will, which\r\nwas filed with the probate court upon his death in August of 2010. Decedent\r\nbequeathed his entire estate to Respondents Francis D. Daniels and Patricia C.\r\nDaniels, who are unrelated to Decedent.\r\n\r\nAppellant Jennifer H. Turner was born on November 8, 1972. It is undisputed that\r\nAppellant and Decedent did not know each other. Following Decedent's death,\r\nAppellant's mother informed her that Decedent was her biological father.1\r\nAppellant filed a claim of inheritance with the probate court based on section 62-2-\r\n302(b) of the South Carolina Code, which allows a pretermitted child to receive an\r\nintestate share if the testator failed to provide for the child based upon a mistaken\r\nbelief that the child was dead.\r\n\r\nThe probate court dismissed Appellant's claim pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP,\r\nfinding the allegations in Appellant's petition did not fit within the clear language\r\nof the statute. On appeal, the circuit court affirmed. Appellant's appeal from the\r\ncircuit court was certified to this Court. Rule 204, SCACR.\r\n\r\n                                         II.\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in affirming the probate court's dismissal\r\nof her inheritance claim.2 We disagree.\r\n\r\n1 We acknowledge no DNA testing has been conducted to verify the biological\r\nrelationship between Appellant and Decedent; however, under the standard of\r\nreview applied to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, motions, we construe all of the facts in\r\nAppellant's well-plead petition in the light most favorable to her. Thus, our\r\nanalysis presumes that Appellant is Decedent's child.\r\n2 Appellant also claims the probate court's construction of section 62-2-302(b)\r\nviolates the public policy of South Carolina and the Equal Protection Clause of the\r\nUnited States Constitution. However, these arguments were not ruled upon by the\r\nprobate court, and Appellant failed to file a motion pursuant to Rule 59(e),\r\nSCRCP, to obtain a ruling. Because these issues are not preserved for appellate\r\nreview, we do not address them. See Great Games, Inc. v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., 339\r\nS.C. 79, 85, 529 S.E.2d 6, 9 (2000) (finding a constitutional challenge was not\r\npreserved for appellate review where it was not ruled upon by the trial court and\r\nthat omission was not raised in a motion for reconsideration).\r\n\nSection 62-2-302(b) states:\r\n\r\n      If, at the time of execution of the will the testator fails to provide in\r\n      his will for a living child solely because he believes that child to be\r\n      dead, the child . . . receives a share in the estate equal in value to that\r\n      which he would have received if the testator had died intestate.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\n\r\nWe find the rules of statutory construction preclude Appellant's claim. It is clear\r\nfrom the unambiguous language of section 62-2-302(b) that the Legislature\r\nintended to limit this exception to include only the scenario specifically\r\nenumerated in the statute. Appellant readily admits Decedent never learned of her\r\nexistence before his death; therefore, Appellant was not omitted from Decedent's\r\nwill solely because Decedent believed her to be dead. See Jennings v.

We conclude the policy does\r\nnot provide coverage.\r\n\n                                      FACTS\n\r\n\r\nBennett & Bennett Construction, Inc. (Bennett & Bennett), a general contractor,\r\nwas engaged by a homeowner to remove synthetic stucco cladding from her home\r\nand replace it with a decorative brick face. Bennett & Bennett hired a\r\nsubcontractor, M&M Construction of the Carolinas, LLC (M&M), to install the\r\nbrick. The brick featured a sandy finish, and both Bennett & Bennett and the\r\ninstructions included with the brick warned M&M not to use pressure washing or\r\nacid to clean the brick.\r\n\r\nM&M completed installation of the brick face, removed the scaffolding, and left\r\nthe site. It informed Bennett & Bennett the work was complete and sent a final\r\ninvoice. Bennett & Bennett inspected the work and discovered mortar and slurry\r\ndried onto the face of the brick in a few areas. Bennett & Bennett informed M&M\r\nof the problem and directed it to make necessary corrections.\r\n\r\nM&M hired a subcontractor to clean the brick. The subcontractor used a pressure\r\nwasher and acid solution that discolored some of the bricks and removed their\r\ndecorative finish. After attempts to repair the appearance of the brick face without\r\nentirely replacing it proved unsuccessful, Bennett & Bennett instructed M&M to\r\nremove and replace all of the brick. M&M ceased all communication with Bennett\r\n& Bennett, which then replaced the brick face at its own expense.\r\n\r\nBennett & Bennett filed suit against M&M for breach of contract, breach of\r\nwarranty, and negligence. Bennett & Bennett gave notice to both M&M and Auto\r\nOwners Insurance Company (Auto Owners), M&M's CGL insurer. Neither M&M\r\nnor Auto Owners responded or appeared to defend the suit or at the damages\r\nhearing after entry of default against M&M. The circuit court awarded default\r\njudgment against M&M.\r\n\r\nBennett & Bennett then brought this action against Auto Owners and M&M\r\nseeking a declaratory judgment that M&M's CGL policy from Auto Owners\r\nprovided coverage for the damages caused by M&M's subcontractor. Following a\r\nbench trial, the circuit court found the incident was an occurrence under the policy\r\nand that neither exclusion j(5) nor exclusion n applied to remove coverage. It\r\ndenied Auto Owners' motion to reconsider. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                      ISSUES\r\n      I.\t Did the circuit court err when it ruled exclusion j(5) does not bar\r\n          coverage under the policy?\r\n\n      II. Did the circuit court err when it ruled exclusion n does not bar coverage\r\n          under the policy? STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nInsurance policies are subject to the general rules of contract construction. B.L.G.\r\nEnterprises, Inc. v. First Financial Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 535, 514 S.E.2d 327,\r\n330 (1999). Whether a contract is ambiguous is a question of law, and the\r\ninterpretation of an unambiguous contract is a question of law. South Carolina\r\nDept. of Natural Resources v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 623, 550\r\nS.E.2d 299, 302-303 (2001). Questions of law are reviewed de novo. Town of\r\nSummerville v. City of North Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40, 41\r\n(2008).                             ANALYSIS\r\n   I. Exclusion j(5)\r\n\r\nAuto Owners contends the circuit court erred when it held exclusion j(5) did not\r\napply because M&M's work was complete. We agree.\r\n\r\nWhen a contract is unambiguous, it must be construed according to the terms the\r\nparties have used. B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc., 334 S.C. at 535, 514 S.E.2d at 330.\r\n\r\nIn the policy at issue, exclusion j(5) removes from the policy's coverage \"property\r\ndamage\" to\r\n\r\n      That particular part of real property on which you or any contractors\r\n      or subcontractors working directly or indirectly on your behalf are\r\n      performing operations, if the \"property damage\" arises out of those\r\n      operations . . . .\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held exclusion j(5) did not apply to operations that occur after the\r\ninsured's work has been completed. We disagree. Exclusion j(5) unambiguously\r\nexcludes coverage whenever the insured or a person acting on the insured's behalf\r\ncauses damages in the course of working on the property, regardless of whether the\r\ninsured's work has been completed.\r\n\r\nExclusion j(5) removes coverage when a subcontractor working on the insured's\r\nbehalf \"[is] performing operations, if the 'property damage' arises out of those\r\noperations.\" It is not disputed here that the damage was caused by a subcontractor\r\nworking on behalf of the insured and that the property damage arose from that\r\n\nwork. The only question is whether the subcontractor was \"performing operations\"\r\nfor purposes of the policy.\r\n\r\n\"Operations\" is not defined in the policy. When policy language is undefined,\r\ncourts must give it its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning. See American Credit\r\nof Sumter, Inc. v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 623, 628, 663 S.E.2d 492,\r\n495 (2008). The American Heritage Dictionary defines \"operation\" as \"A process\r\nor series of acts performed to effect a certain purpose or result.\" 2nd College Ed.\r\n1991. Nothing in the context of exclusion j(5) or elsewhere in the policy suggests\r\n\"operations\" should not be given its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.\r\n\r\nThe verb phrase \"are performing\" is in the present continuous tense, indicating that\r\nthe temporal limits of the exclusion are coterminous with the performance of the\r\nacts. There can be no question the damage in this case occurred while the insured's\r\nsubcontractor was actively \"performing operations.\" See Action Auto Stores, Inc.\r\nv. United Capitol Ins. Co., 845 F.Supp. 428, 435 (W.D. Mich. 1993) (construing\r\n\"are performing operations\" narrowly in favor of the insured to hold \"that the only\r\ndamage which is excludable is damage which occurred during the time defendant\r\nworked upon the property\"); Fisher v. American Family Mut. Ins. Co., 579 N.W.2d\r\n599, 604 (N.D. 1998) (\"exclusion j(5) excludes coverage only for property damage\r\nduring the time [the subcontractor] worked upon the property\"); Advantage\r\nHomebuilding, LLC v. Maryland Casualty Company, 470 F.3d 1003, 1011 (10th\r\nCir. 2006) (\"[T]he better reasoned view is that exclusion j(5) applies whenever\r\nproperty damage arises out of the work of the insured, its contractors, or its\r\nsubcontractors while 'performing operations.'\" (internal emphasis and quotation\r\nmarks omitted; emphasis added)).\r\n\r\nThe circuit court held that M&M's subcontractor was not \"performing operations\"\r\nwhen the damage occurred by invoking a time period in the policy that does not\r\naffect the applicability of the policy exclusions but only governs which coverage\r\nlimitation applies. The circuit court correctly determined that \"your work\" was\r\ncompleted under the policy when the damage occurred but incorrectly concluded\r\nthat exclusion j(5) therefore did not apply. But the policy language regarding\r\nwhen \"your work\" is completed is relevant only to the \"products completed\r\noperations hazard\" coverage that applies to damages incurred after \"your work\" is\r\ncompleted. Products completed operations hazard coverage requires an additional\r\npremium, and a separate aggregate limit applies. See Valmont Energy Stell, Inc. v.\r\nCommercial Union Ins. Co., 359 F.3d 770, 775-76 (5th Cir. 2004) (general\r\naggregate limit and products completed operations aggregate limit divided the\r\ncoverage \"into two components, each of which contained its own coverage\r\n\nlimitation\"). The point at which \"your work\" is completed as defined under\r\n\"products completed operations hazard\" marks the end of the period when the\r\npolicy's general aggregate limit applies and the beginning of the period when the\r\nproducts completed operations aggregate limit applies.\r\n\r\nM&M purchased both types of coverage. In M&M's policy, both coverages are\r\nconferred under the same general grant of coverage and are subject to the same set\r\nof exclusions. Thus, the coverage provided to M&M under the general aggregate\r\nlimit and the products completed operations hazard limit is identical in every way\r\nexcept the time when it applies. The point in time when M&M's general aggregate\r\ncoverage ended and its products completed operations coverage began is\r\nimmaterial to this case since the insurer is not defending on the basis that the\r\npolicy's limits have been exhausted.1\r\n\r\nOther cases cited by the circuit court in support of its finding were inapposite.\r\nThey dealt with damages that occurred after the contractors' activities on the\r\nproject had completely ceased, not with damages that occurred during the course of\r\nthe actions of the insured or his subcontractor, as is the case here. See Pinkerton &\r\nLaws, Inc. v. Royal Insurance Company of America, 227 F.Supp.2d 1348, 1355\r\n(2002) (concluding exclusion j(5) did not apply when water damage resulted to\r\nother property after improper installation of windows); Lennar Corp. v. Great\r\nAmerican Ins. Co., 200 S.W.3d 651 (Tex. Ct. App. 2006), abrogated on other\r\ngrounds by Gilbert Texas Const., L.P. v. Underwriters at Llyod's London, 327\r\nS.W.3d 118 (Tex. 2010) (water damage caused by defective installation of exterior\r\ninsulation and finish systems); McMath Const. Co., Inc. v. Dupuy, 897 So.2d 677\r\n(La. Ct. App. 2004) (water damage from leaks caused by defective installation of\r\nstucco); Spears v. Smith, 690 N.E.2d 557 (Ohio Ct. App. 1996) (sinking, cracking,\r\nseparating, and other issues caused by inadequate floor support).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n1 M&M's policy provides a $1,000,000 aggregate limit for each of these types of\r\ncoverage. Thus, for example, had a falling brick injured a passerby while the brick\r\nwas initially being installed and the damages exceeded $1,000,000, coverage\r\nwould have been exhausted under the general aggregate limit. Despite the\r\nexhaustion of that coverage, however, another $1,000,000 in coverage would have\r\nbeen available under the products completed operations aggregate limit had\r\nanother passerby then been injured while the brick was being removed (\"[w]ork\r\nthat may need service maintenance correction repair or replacement but which is\r\notherwise complete will be treated as completed\").\r\n\nBecause we conclude that exclusion j(5) unambiguously excludes coverage when\r\nthe insured's subcontractor damages the work product while performing operations,\r\nregardless of whether \"your work\" is complete under the policy, we hold that\r\nexclusion j(5) barred coverage for damages caused by M&M's subcontractor while\r\nimproperly cleaning the brick face.\r\n\r\n   II. Exclusion n\r\n\r\nThe circuit court also held exclusion n did not exclude coverage under the facts of\r\nthis case. Although unnecessary to our analysis, we note that exclusion n also bars\r\ncoverage under the policy.\r\n\r\nThe plain language of exclusion n states in relevant part that the policy does not\r\ncover Damages claimed for any loss, cost or expense . . . incurred . . . for the\r\n      . . . repair, replacement, adjustment, removal or disposal of . . . \"Your\r\n      work\" . . . If such . . . work . . . is withdrawn . . . from use . . . because\r\n      of a known or suspected defect, deficiency, inadequacy, or dangerous\r\n      condition in it.\r\n\r\nIn Auto Owners v. Newman, 385 S.C. 187, 684 S.E.2d 541 (2009), this Court held\r\nexclusion n barred coverage under a CGL policy for the cost of removing and\r\nreplacing defectively installed stucco because it was the insured's work. Likewise,\r\nin this case, the insured contracted to install a decorative brick face, and the\r\naesthetic characteristics of the brick were an important aspect of the contract. The\r\nbrick face was replaced because of a deficiency in its aesthetic characteristics. See\r\nalso Alverson v. Northwestern Nat. Cas. Co., 559 N.W.2d 234, 236 (S.D. 1997)\r\n(finding that improperly performed cleaning of windows to remove mortar dropped\r\non them by masons became the masonry contractor's work incidental to its contract\r\nand finding resulting damage excluded from coverage as \"that particular part of\r\nany property [the windows] that must be restored, repaired, or replaced because\r\n'your work' [window cleaning] was incorrectly performed on it\"). Thus, the\r\ninsured's work was replaced because of a deficiency or inadequacy in it, and\r\ncoverage is barred under exclusion n.\r\n\r\n                                   CONCLUSION\r\nAs we have repeatedly explained, a CGL policy does not insure the insured's work\r\nitself but consequential risks that stem from the insured's work. See Century\r\nIndemnity Co. v. Golden Hills Builders, Inc., 348 S.C. 559, 565-66, 561 S.E.2d\r\n\n355, 358 (2002), overruled in part on other grounds by Crossman Communities of\r\nNorth Carolina, Inc. v. Harleysville Mutual Insurance Co., 395 S.C. 40, 717\r\nS.E.2d 589 (2011). CGL coverage \"is for tort liability for injury to persons and\r\ndamage to other property and not for contractual liability of [the] insured for\r\neconomic loss because [the] completed work is not that for which the damaged\r\nperson bargained[.]\" Id. at 566, 561 S.E.2d at 358 (citing Sapp v. State Farm Fire\r\n& Cas. Co., 226 Ga. App. 200, 486 S.E.2d 71 (1997)) (emphasis in original).\r\nConsistent with this understanding of the type of coverage that is provided by a\r\nCGL policy, the plain language of exclusions j(5) and n each independently\r\nexclude coverage when, as here, a subcontractor acting on behalf of the insured\r\ndirectly damages the insured's work product, necessitating its removal and\r\nreplacement.\r\n\r\nBecause we find coverage unambiguously barred under both exclusion j(5) and\r\nexclusion n, we reverse.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs. BEATTY, J., concurring in result only. HEARN, J.,\r\nconcurring in a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE HEARN: I concur in part.

Pollack's injury on the job, his employer\r\naccommodated his work restrictions by providing him light duty employment.\r\nThereafter, Appellant was discharged for violating a company policy by failing to\r\nreport an accident involving an employer vehicle. Appellant filed a claim seeking\r\nTemporary Total Disability benefits. The Workers' Compensation Commission\r\n\ndenied the claim, holding Appellant's termination and resulting incapacity to earn\r\nwages was due to his violation of company policy and not his work-related injury.\r\nWe affirm.                                 I.\r\n\r\nAppellant was employed by Respondent Southern Wine & Spirits of America as a\r\ndrivers' supervisor.1 On March 31, 2010, Appellant suffered an admitted injury to\r\nhis back while lifting a case of alcohol. Appellant was seen by a physician and\r\nreturned to work five days later on April 5 with restrictions, including lifting\r\nrestrictions not to exceed 15 pounds. Respondent accommodated Appellant's work\r\nrestrictions and, at his full salary, assigned him to light duty in the same position he\r\nheld prior to the injury.\r\n\r\nApproximately two months later, on May 27, Appellant responded to an accident\r\ninvolving another company vehicle assigned to Jessie Richardson. Respondent's\r\ncompany policy states that \"All accidents and incidents with a vehicle must be\r\nreported, whether or not there is damage to the Company vehicle, another vehicle,\r\nor other property\" and that \"All accidents in a Company vehicle, at fault or not,\r\nmust be immediately reported to the Driver Supervisor. Failure to report an\r\naccident will result in immediate termination.\" Appellant completed his\r\ninvestigation of the initial accident involving Richardson's vehicle. As he was\r\nleaving the scene, Appellant's company vehicle hit the side of Richardson's\r\nvehicle. Appellant claimed he surveyed his company vehicle and only saw what\r\nhe described as a line of dirt on the vehicle, as opposed to any real property\r\ndamage. Appellant did not report the collision between his vehicle and\r\nRichardson's to Respondent.2\r\n\r\nRespondent suspended Appellant pending an investigation. At the direction of his\r\nsupervisors, Appellant subsequently completed an accident report detailing the\r\nincident. Following routine drug and breath alcohol tests, Appellant was reinstated\r\n\r\n1Our reference to Respondent in the singular is to the employer, Southern Wine &\r\nSpirits of America, although we recognize that the insurance carrier is an\r\nadditional named Respondent.\r\n2 The employer was informed of Appellant's accident by Richardson. As discussed\r\ninfra, Richardson prepared a written statement, which was admitted into evidence\r\nat the workers' compensation hearing over Appellant's objection on hearsay\r\ngrounds.\r\n\nby his local superiors on June 4, pending review by Respondent's corporate office\r\nin Miami, Florida. On June 15, Respondent terminated Appellant for his failure to\r\nreport the accident.\r\n\r\nThereafter, Appellant filed a Workers' Compensation Form 50 seeking Temporary\r\nTotal Disability (TTD) compensation for the admitted injury to his back from June\r\n15, the date of his termination. Respondent opposed Appellant's request for TTD\r\nbenefits and asserted he was terminated for cause and therefore ineligible for TTD\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nAt the hearing before the single commissioner, Appellant, who admitted he had\r\nprevious infractions during his employment, testified he was aware of the company\r\npolicy, but maintained that he decided the accident was not serious enough to\r\nwarrant a formal report.\r\n\r\nSonny Blocker, Appellant's supervisor and Respondent's plant manager, testified\r\nthe decision to terminate Appellant went through the human resources department\r\nand ultimately came from the company headquarters in Miami. Blocker also\r\ntestified that other employees have been terminated for failing to report incidents\r\nor accidents in the past. Additionally, Blocker stated that, but for Appellant's\r\nviolation of company policy, Appellant would still be working in a light duty\r\ncapacity for Respondent.\r\n\r\nThe single commissioner denied Appellant's request for TTD compensation. The\r\ncommissioner held Appellant failed to prove his entitlement to TTD benefits,\r\nconcluding that Appellant was terminated for cause for violating company policy.\r\nAn appellate panel of the Workers' Compensation Commission (the Commission)\r\naffirmed the single commissioner's denial of TTD compensation. The Commission\r\nconcluded that Respondent accommodated Appellant's work restrictions until he\r\nwas terminated. Moreover, the Commission found Appellant was terminated for\r\ncause stemming from violations of company policy and stated:\r\n\r\n      Pursuant to S.C. Code § 42-9-260, an employer is required to pay\r\n      temporary total disability benefits when the employee is out of work\r\n      due to a reported work-related injury. Nothing in this statute can be\r\n      read for the proposition that an employer may never terminate for\r\n      cause an employee who is otherwise entitled to receive temporary\r\n      total disability payments.\r\n\r\nThus, the Commission determined that Appellant was not out of work due to his\r\ninjury, but rather for violating company policies that led to his termination for\r\n\ncause. It reasoned that to hold otherwise would lead to an absurd result in which\r\nan employer could never terminate a light duty, accommodated employee without\r\ntriggering TTD benefits. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                                        II.\r\n\r\nUnder the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), an appellate court may not\r\nsubstitute its judgment for that of the agency as to the weight of the evidence on\r\nquestions of fact, but it may reverse when the decision is affected by an error of\r\nlaw.

Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981)).\r\n\"'Substantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record as a whole, would\r\nallow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency\r\nreached to justify its action.'\" Id. at 417, 586 S.E.2d at 113 (quoting Howell v.\r\nPacific Columbia Mills, 291 S.C. 469, 471, 354 S.E.2d 384, 385 (1987)).\r\n\r\n                                       III.\r\nAppellant argues the Commission erred in denying him TTD compensation.3 We\r\ndisagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 42-9-260 of the South Carolina Code, TTD payments may\r\nbegin when \"an employee has been out of work due to a reported work-related\r\ninjury . . . for eight days[.] . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 42-9-260 (Supp. 2012)\r\n(emphasis added). Under the workers' compensation regulations, disability is\r\nconsidered \"incapacity because of injury to earn wages which the employee was\r\nreceiving at the time of the injury in the same or any other employment.\" 25A S.C.\r\nCode Reg. 67-502(B)(1) (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added). A disability is\r\n\"presumed to continue until the employee returns to work or compensation is\r\notherwise suspended or terminated according to Section 42-9-260.\" Id. An\r\nemployer is not obligated to pay TTD benefits if the employee has returned to\r\nwork for more than 15 days or the employee has been released by the treating\r\nphysician for limited duty work and the employer provides limited duty work\r\nconsistent with the terms upon which the employee has been released. Id.\r\n\r\n3Respondent contends the Commission's order is not immediately appealable. We\r\ndisagree and summarily reject this contention pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.\r\n\nAppellant seeks to avoid the law of substantial evidence by suggesting that \"as a\r\nmatter of law, when the injured worker is under work restrictions, the employer\r\nmust either offer suitable employment within the injured worker's capacity or pay\r\ntemporary total disability compensation.\" We do not disagree with Appellant's\r\nproposition, but find it has no application here, for it is premised on the false\r\nassumption that Respondent did not offer suitable employment within his\r\nrestrictions. It is beyond dispute that Respondent offered Appellant continued\r\nemployment within his light duty restrictions, which was accepted by Appellant.\r\nThus, in this case we are presented with a factual determination, not a question of\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nIt appears Appellant seeks to have this Court construe South Carolina's workers'\r\ncompensation laws to mandate the payment of TTD benefits, regardless of the\r\nfactual circumstances of the particular case, whenever an employee is discharged\r\nfrom an accommodated, light duty position. We categorically reject such an\r\ninterpretation, as the fallacy in Appellant's position is self-evident.4 See Lancaster\r\nCnty. Bar Ass'n v. S.C. Comm'n on Indigent Defense, 380 S.C. 219, 222, 670\r\nS.E.2d 371, 373 (2008) (\"In construing a statute, this Court will reject an\r\ninterpretation when such an interpretation leads to an absurd result that could not\r\nhave been intended by the legislature.\").\r\n\r\nPursuant to section 42-9-260 and the accompanying regulations, the entitlement of\r\nTTD benefits is premised on a nexus between the work-related injury and the\r\ninability to earn wages. An injured employee will be entitled to TTD\r\ncompensation when his incapacity to earn wages is due to or because of the injury.\r\nSee Travelscape, LLC v. S.C. Dep't of Rev., 391 S.C. 89, 98, 705 S.E.2d 28, 33\r\n(2011) (\"Where the statute's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear,\r\ndefinite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court\r\nhas no right to impose another meaning.\"). This is a quintessential factual question\r\n4 To accept Appellant's argument that, as a matter of law, no employer may ever\r\nterminate an injured, accommodated employee without incurring responsibility for\r\nTTD benefits would be contrary to section 42-9-260 and applicable regulations.\r\nAppellant's interpretation of the law would essentially insulate injured employees\r\nwho engage in misconduct while employed in rehabilitative settings and essentially\r\ntie the hands of an employer who has sought to accommodate the employee to the\r\nbest of its ability. Such an unwarranted construction of the statutory and\r\nregulatory language would have the additional and undesirable effect of\r\ndiscouraging employers from endeavoring to accommodate injured workers with\r\nlight duty work.\r\n\nfor the fact-finder, the Commission. See, e.g., Johnson v. Rent-A-Center, Inc., 398\r\nS.C. 595, 730 S.E.2d 857 (2012) (holding substantial evidence supports the\r\nCommission's findings that the employee was disabled and entitled to TTD\r\nbenefits). As a result, this Court is limited to determining whether substantial\r\nevidence supports the Commission's finding that Appellant's inability to earn\r\nwages was a result of his termination for cause, not his work-related injury.\r\n\r\nWhile we are constrained by the substantial evidence standard of review, we do\r\nagree with Appellant that an employer's denial of TTD benefits must be scrutinized\r\ncarefully. Certainly, this is a critically important task for the Commission in its\r\nfact-finding role. Having thoroughly reviewed the record, we are persuaded the\r\nsingle commissioner and the Commission thoughtfully considered the evidence,\r\nremaining sensitive to an employer's possible motivation to \"look for\" a reason to\r\nfire an injured worker.5\r\n\r\nWe hold there is substantial evidence to support the Commission's finding that\r\nAppellant's incapacity to earn wages was due to his termination for cause, not his\r\nwork-related injury. It is undisputed that Appellant, who never received TTD\r\nbenefits, was accommodated by Respondent within his light duty work restrictions.\r\nAppellant was permitted to remain in his position, subject to the 15-pound lifting\r\nrestriction. Further, Appellant admits he violated company policy by not reporting\r\n\r\n5 The jurisprudence in this area reflects the Commission's commendable\r\nrecognition of the natural motivations that may be at play when an employer seeks\r\nto deny or terminate TTD benefits. See, e.g., Johnson, 398 S.C. 595, 730 S.E.2d\r\n857 (affirming the Commission's award of TTD benefits and rejection of the\r\nemployer's argument that it attempted to accommodate the employee's injury and\r\nthat its purported offer of light duty work was reasonable); Last v. MSI Const. Co.,\r\n305 S.C. 349, 409 S.E.2d 334 (1991) (affirming the Commission and holding\r\nsubstantial evidence supported the continuation of TTD benefits where the\r\nemployer sought to terminate TTD benefits based on a claimant's refusal to accept\r\nmedical care while the claimant was incarcerated); Davis v. UniHealth Post Acute\r\nCare, --- S.C. ---, 741 S.E.2d 770 (Ct. App. 2013) (affirming the Commission and\r\nholding substantial evidence supported the Commission's determination that the\r\nemployer was required to pay TTD compensation to the claimant where the\r\nclaimant did not refuse employment by falling asleep briefly on the job). Here, the\r\nCommission has made a factual determination contrary to Appellant's position, and\r\nthat finding is manifestly supported by substantial evidence.\r\n\nthe accident involving the company vehicle.6 We find there is substantial evidence\r\nto support the Commission's finding that Appellant was terminated for cause and\r\ntherefore Appellant's inability to earn wages was not due to or because of a work-\r\nrelated injury.7                       IV.\r\nBecause the decision of the Commission denying Appellant TTD benefits is\r\nsupported by substantial evidence, it is affirmed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Appellant further acknowledged that his conduct at work prior to his injury had\r\nnot been ideal. Respondent, through counsel, characterizes Appellant's previous\r\nwork history as putting him on \"thin ice.\" While this characterization is likely\r\nhyperbole, Appellant's less than model employment weighs against the suggestion\r\nthat he was terminated due to his work injury.\r\n7Pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR, we affirm Appellant's challenge to the\r\nCommission's consideration of Jessie Richardson's written statement. Having\r\ndetermined that the decision of the Commission is supported by substantial\r\nevidence, we decline to address the Commission's discussion of the doctrine of\r\nconstructive refusal.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27286","title":"Disabato v.

First, embodied in the South Carolina\r\nFreedom of Information Act, Title 30, Chapter 4 of the South Carolina Code (the\r\nFOIA), is the principle of an open, transparent system of government, vital to\r\nmaintaining an informed electorate and preventing the secret exercise of\r\ngovernmental power with its potential corruption. Juxtaposed against this principle\r\nare the rights of citizens to freely speak and associate embodied in the First\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. We must decide whether the FOIA\r\nas applied to the South Carolina Association of School Administrators (SCASA), a\r\nnon-profit corporation engaged in political advocacy, unconstitutionally infringes\r\nupon SCASA's First Amendment speech and association rights. We hold the FOIA\r\ndoes not violate those rights and reverse the circuit court's order granting SCASA's\r\nmotion to dismiss.\r\n\r\n                 FACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\n     SCASA is a non-profit, South Carolina corporation whose purpose is to\r\nadvocate on legislative and policy issues impacting education. In August of 2009,\r\n\nRocky Disabato sent SCASA a request for information pursuant to the FOIA.1 The\r\nExecutive Director of SCASA sent Disabato a response in which she refused to\r\nproduce any of the requested materials and asserted that SCASA is not a public\r\nentity subject to the FOIA.\r\n\r\n       Thereafter, Disabato filed a complaint in circuit court seeking a declaration\r\nthat SCASA violated the FOIA by refusing to comply with his request as well as\r\nan injunction requiring SCASA to comply with the FOIA. SCASA filed a motion\r\nto dismiss the action pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP, on the grounds that, when\r\nthe FOIA is applied to a public body that is a non-profit corporation engaged in\r\npolitical advocacy, the FOIA unconstitutionally violates the First Amendment\r\nrights of speech and association.2\r\n\r\n      In ruling on the motion to dismiss, the circuit court assumed that SCASA is\r\nsupported by public funds, is a public body subject to the FOIA, and is a\r\ncorporation engaged in political speech and issue advocacy. The court first held\r\n\r\n\r\n1   Disabato's letter stated in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n       Pursuant to the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act, I hereby\r\n       request that you provide me with a copy of all emails, letters, memos,\r\n       documents, and other records possessed or maintained by the South\r\n       Carolina Association of School Administrators that discuss both the\r\n       American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and Governor\r\n       Mark Sanford, including but not limited to any references to the\r\n       lawsuit filed by your organization against Gov. Sanford in May 2009.\r\n       I also request that you provide me with a copy of any record that\r\n       reflects all telephone calls made by or received by your organization\r\n       and its staff, including the staff members' cell phones, from January 1,\r\n       2009 to July 31, 2009. Your response is due within fifteen days.\r\n2 SCASA's brief asserts that it also moved to dismiss the complaint on the grounds\r\nthat application of the FOIA to SCASA violates Article 1, Section 2 of the South\r\nCarolina Constitution which provides for the \"freedom of speech.\" S.C. Const. art.\r\nI, § 2 (1976). However, the record is devoid of any mention of Article 1, Section\r\n2, and therefore, the issue is not before us. See Wilder Corp. v. Wilke, 330 S.C. 71,\r\n76, 497 S.E.2d 731, 733 (1998) (\"It is axiomatic that an issue cannot be raised for\r\nthe first time on appeal . . . .\").\r\n\nthat the FOIA burdens SCASA's First Amendment speech and association rights,\r\nand then reviewed the constitutionality of the FOIA using a combination of the\r\nexacting and strict scrutiny standards of review. In its order dismissing Disabato's\r\ncomplaint, the court stated that \"[t]he FOIA's broad definition of 'public body' can\r\nonly be sustained as constitutional if the FOIA's open meeting and records\r\ndisclosure requirements are substantially related to a sufficiently important\r\ngovernmental purpose and no less restrictive means of achieving this purpose\r\nexists.\" The court held the FOIA as applied to SCASA does not meet that standard\r\nbecause the disclosure and open meetings requirements are not substantially\r\nrelated to the purposes of the statute and because a less restrictive means of\r\nachieving the statute's purposes exists. Accordingly, the court held the FOIA\r\nviolates SCASA's First Amendment speech and association rights and granted the\r\nmotion to dismiss. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n                             ISSUES PRESENTED\r\nI. \t    Is SCASA a \"public body\" subject to the South Carolina Freedom of\r\n        Information Act?\r\n\r\nII. \t   Does application of the FOIA to SCASA violate SCASA's First Amendment\r\n        speech and association rights as incorporated through the Fourteenth\r\n        Amendment?         STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n      A claim may be dismissed when the defendant demonstrates that the plaintiff\r\nhas failed to allege facts sufficient to establish a cause of action. Rule 12(b)(6),\r\nSCRCP. We review the grant of dismissal according to the same standard applied\r\nby the circuit court. See Williams v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 233, 553 S.E.2d 496,\r\n500 (Ct. App. 2001). A ruling on a motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6)\r\nmust be based solely on the factual allegations set forth in the complaint, and the\r\ncourt must consider all well-pled allegations as true. Gressette v. S.C. Elec. & Gas\r\nCo., 370 S.C. 377, 378–79, 635 S.E.2d 538, 538 (2006).\r\n\r\n       The Supreme Court has a limited scope of review in considering\r\nconstitutional challenges to statutes. Joytime Distribs. & Amusement Co. v. State,\r\n338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d 647, 650 (1999). The Court presumes that all\r\n\nstatutes are constitutional and will, if possible, construe a statute so as to render it\r\nconstitutional. Davis v. Cnty. of Greenville, 322 S.C. 73, 77, 470 S.E.2d 94, 96\r\n(1996).                          LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       Our General Assembly enacted the FOIA based on the premise \"that it is\r\nvital in a democratic society that public business be performed in an open and\r\npublic manner so that citizens shall be advised of the performance of public\r\nofficials and of the decisions that are reached in public activity and in the\r\nformulation of public policy.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-15 (2007). In furtherance of\r\nthat purpose, the FOIA subjects a \"public body\" to record disclosure and open\r\nmeeting requirements.\r\n\r\n      Among those entities defined as a public body subject to the statute are \"any\r\norganization, corporation, or agency supported in whole or in part by public funds\r\nor expending public funds . . . .\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-20(a). We held in Weston\r\nv. Carolina Research & Development Foundation, 303 S.C. 398, 401 S.E.2d 161\r\n(1991), that the statute's unambiguous language brings even a private corporation\r\nsupported by public funds within the definition of a public body. Id. at 403, 401\r\nS.E.2d at 164. We further clarified that holding, stating:\r\n\r\n      this decision does not mean that the FOIA would apply to business\r\n      enterprises that receive payment from public bodies in return for\r\n      supplying specific goods or services on an arm[']s length basis. In\r\n      that situation, there is an exchange of money for identifiable goods or\r\n      services and access to the public body's records would show how the\r\n      money was spent. However, when a block of public funds is diverted\r\n      en masse from a public body to a related organization, or when the\r\n      related organization undertakes the management of the expenditure of\r\n      public funds, the only way that the public can determine with\r\n      specificity how those funds were spent is through access to the\r\n      records and affairs of the organization receiving and spending the\r\n      funds.\r\n\r\nId. at 404, 401 S.E.2d at 165.\r\n\r\n       The FOIA's record disclosure requirement provides that \"any person has a\r\nright to inspect or copy any public record of a public body\" subject to certain\r\n\nexceptions. S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-30(a). A public body must provide any\r\nrequested records within fifteen days of a request, and the body may collect fees to\r\ncover the costs of searching for and producing records. S.C. Code Ann § 30-4-\r\n30(b) – (c). Additionally, the FOIA's open meetings requirement provides that all\r\nmeetings of public bodies must be open to the public, subject to limited exceptions.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-60. A public body must provide advance notice of all\r\nmeetings and keep written minutes which must include statutorily specified\r\ninformation. S.C. Code Ann. §§ 30-4-80 & 30-4-90. Finally, the FOIA provides\r\nthat any citizen of the State may seek a declaratory judgment and injunctive relief\r\nto enforce the provisions of the FOIA, and willful violations of the FOIA are a\r\nmisdemeanor subject to punishment by a fine or imprisonment. S.C. Code Ann. §§\r\n30-4-100 & 110.\r\n\r\nI.    PUBLIC BODY\r\n       As an initial matter, Disabato asks us to declare that SCASA is a public body\r\nsubject to the FOIA. However, SCASA's motion to dismiss did not challenge the\r\nsufficiency of Disabato's allegation that SCASA is a public body. Therefore, the\r\nissue is not before us. The allegations in Disabato's complaint, if true, may or may\r\nnot be enough to establish that SCASA is a public body for purposes of the FOIA;\r\nhowever, a judicial declaration that SCASA is a public body must be based upon\r\nevidence, not on mere allegations. Therefore, the issue of whether SCASA is a\r\npublic body can only be resolved after the parties have engaged in discovery, and\r\nat this procedural stage, we assume, but do not decide, that SCASA is a public\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nII.   FIRST AMENDMENT CHALLENGE\r\n       The only issue before us is whether the application of the FOIA to SCASA\r\nis an unconstitutional infringement upon SCASA's First Amendment speech and\r\nassociation rights. Disabato contends that the FOIA does not impact SCASA's\r\nFirst Amendment rights in any way, and thus, we need not consider the FOIA's\r\nconstitutionality under the First Amendment. Disabato also contends that even if\r\nthe FOIA does impact SCASA's First Amendment rights, the FOIA does not\r\nunconstitutionally infringe upon those rights.\r\n\r\n        Accordingly, we must engage in a two-step analysis of SCASA's challenge.\r\nInitially, we must determine whether the FOIA impacts SCASA's speech and\r\nassociation rights, and if we conclude it does, we must then determine whether it is\r\n\nan unconstitutional infringement of SCASA's rights. See, e.g., Perry Educ. Ass'n v.\r\nPerry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460 U.S. 37, 44 (1983) (first concluding that the\r\nchallenged law implicated First Amendment rights before proceeding to consider\r\nthe constitutionality of the law). We conclude that while the FOIA does impact\r\nupon SCASA's speech and association rights, the First Amendment is not violated.\r\n\r\n      A.    The FOIA's Impact on SCASA's First Amendment Rights\r\n            1.     Freedom of Speech\r\n\r\n       Among the protections afforded by the First Amendment against state action\r\nis the right to not speak publicly.3 Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v. Nation\r\nEnters., 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985). Affording persons a right to speak in private\r\nfurthers the interests in enabling and promoting speech behind the First\r\nAmendment. Id. Persons may not be willing to express some speech in public, for\r\nexample dissident beliefs or personal information, and thus, such speech would be\r\nstifled were persons not able to express it in private.\r\n\r\n       By requiring that all meetings be open to the public, the FOIA prevents\r\nprivate oral communication among SCASA's members. The records disclosure\r\nrequirement prevents private written communications because any such\r\ncommunications are subject to public disclosure. Thus, the FOIA implicates\r\nSCASA's right to not speak publicly.\r\n\r\n            2.     Freedom of Association\r\n\r\n      The United States Supreme Court has interpreted the First Amendment as\r\nencompassing an implicit right to associate for the purpose of engaging in speech\r\nand the other activities protected by the First Amendment.4 Roberts v. U.S.\r\n\r\n3 The freedom of speech found in the First Amendment is a fundamental right, and\r\nthus, the First Amendment's prohibition against laws abridging the freedom of\r\nspeech applies against the states through the Fourteenth Amendment. Thornhill v.\r\nAlabama, 310 U.S. 88, 95 (1940).\r\n4 The freedom of association implicit in the First Amendment is a fundamental\r\nright, and thus, like the freedom of speech, the First Amendment's protection\r\nagainst the abridgement of the freedom of association applies against the states\r\nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment. See NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,\r\n357 U.S. 449, 460–66 (1958).\r\n\nJaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 618 (1984). The right to associate is recognized due to the\r\ninextricable link between association and the enumerated rights of the First\r\nAmendment and the role of association in facilitating self-governance. See\r\nNAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson, 357 U.S. 449, 460 (1958) (noting the \"close\r\nnexus between the freedoms of speech and assembly\"); Ashutosh Bhagwat,\r\nAssociational Speech, 120 Yale L.J. 978, 993 (2011) (discussing the rationale for\r\nrecognizing a right to associate). By associating, persons can increase the strength\r\nand visibility of their views, and are accordingly better able to communicate those\r\nviews to their representatives in government. See Patterson, 357 U.S. at 460 (\"The\r\neffective advocacy of both public and private points of view, particularly\r\ncontroversial ones, is undeniably enhanced by group association . . . .\"). Thus, for\r\nthe freedom to speak on political issues to have any substance, people must be able\r\nto associate in order to make their common views heard.\r\n\r\n       Among the protections afforded by the freedom of association are the rights\r\nto not associate, to privacy in one's associations, and to be free from governmental\r\ninterference with the internal affairs and organization of one's associations.\r\nRoberts, 468 U.S. at 622–23. The FOIA implicates SCASA's right to associational\r\nprivacy both by requiring that SCASA's meetings be open to the public and by\r\nrequiring SCASA to disclose records including membership lists.                More\r\nimportantly, the FOIA's open meeting requirement impairs SCASA's ability to\r\neffectively associate for the purpose of political and issue advocacy. By requiring\r\nthat all meetings be open to the public, the provision essentially demands that\r\nSCASA conduct all of its associational activities with members of its opposition\r\npresent. We recognize that the ability of a group such as SCASA to formulate a\r\nstrategy for political advocacy may be diminished by the presence of persons\r\nopposed to the organization's views because the members' ability to freely and\r\nopenly debate their views may be chilled. As a result, an organization that cannot\r\ndeliberate internally over its strategy and message has a weakened ability to\r\nmeaningfully associate. See Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1126, 1142 n.9\r\n(9th Cir. 2009) (holding that an organization's ability to engage in internal\r\ndeliberations on strategy is a component of the freedom of association). Thus, the\r\nFOIA implicates SCASA's right to associate by interfering with its ability to\r\ndeliberate internally and by removing any associational privacy.\r\n\r\n      In conclusion, the FOIA impacts SCASA's freedoms of speech and\r\nassociation. However, simply because a statute negatively affects a constitutional\r\nright does not mean the statute unconstitutionally infringes that right. Instead,\r\n\ncourts assess the constitutionality of a statute by selecting the appropriate level of\r\nscrutiny and subjecting the statute to that scrutiny. If a statute satisfies the\r\nappropriate level of scrutiny, it is constitutional despite its impacts upon a\r\nconstitutional right. Accordingly, while we agree with the circuit court that the\r\nFOIA burdens SCASA's First Amendment rights of speech and association, we\r\nmust now determine the appropriate level of scrutiny in order to determine whether\r\nthat infringement is unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n      B.     Level of Scrutiny\r\n       First, Disabato contends the circuit court erred in selecting an exacting\r\nscrutiny or strict scrutiny standard as the appropriate standard. We agree.\r\n\r\n       The circuit court misapprehended the United States Supreme Court's recent\r\ndecisions in John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 130 S. Ct. 2811 (2010) and Citizens United v.\r\nFEC, 558 U.S. 310 (2010), in holding that those decisions dictate the appropriate\r\nstandard of review to be applied here. In Reed and Citizens United, the Court\r\nconsidered First Amendment challenges to disclosure requirements related to\r\nelections, and reviewed those requirements under an exacting scrutiny standard.\r\nExacting scrutiny is a special level of scrutiny applied only in election disclosure\r\ncases, and it falls somewhere \"in the gray area between strict scrutiny and\r\ndeference under rational basis review.\" Anthony Johnstone, A Madisonian Case\r\nfor Disclosure, 19 Geo. Mason L. Rev. 413, 425 (2012). To satisfy exacting\r\nscrutiny there must be a substantial relationship between the disclosure\r\nrequirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest. Reed, 130 S. Ct. at\r\n2818. While the Reed and Citizens United decisions involved disclosure\r\nrequirements and the FOIA requires disclosure, those decisions made clear they\r\nwere applying exacting scrutiny because the First Amendment challenges were\r\nmade in the election context. See Reed, 130 S. Ct. at 2818; Citizens United, 558\r\nU.S. at 366–71. Here, the First Amendment challenge to the FOIA is not a\r\nchallenge in the electoral context, and thus, exacting scrutiny is not applicable.5\r\n\r\n5  Additionally, we note that even if Reed and Citizens United supplied the\r\nappropriate standard of review, the circuit court misstated that standard. The\r\ncircuit court stated the exacting scrutiny standard—\"substantially related to a\r\nsufficiently important governmental purpose\"—and then tacked on the additional\r\nrequirement that \"no less restrictive means of achieving this purpose exists.\" The\r\nrequirement that there be no less restrictive means is a component of strict\r\n\n       Outside the context of electoral disclosure requirements, the level of scrutiny\r\napplied to a statute that affects speech depends on whether the statute is content-\r\nbased or content-neutral in relation to the affected speech. Content-based statutes\r\nare subjected to strict scrutiny, whereas content-neutral statutes are subjected to\r\nintermediate scrutiny. See Republican Party of Minnesota v. White, 536 U.S. 765,\r\n774–75 (2002) (finding a statute was content-based and applying strict scrutiny);\r\nTurner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. F.C.C., 520 U.S. 180, 189 (1997) (finding a statute was\r\ncontent-neutral and applying intermediate scrutiny). A statute will be upheld under\r\nintermediate scrutiny despite its impact on speech if it serves important\r\ngovernmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free speech and does not\r\nburden substantially more speech than necessary to further those interests. Turner,\r\n520 U.S. at 189. To survive strict scrutiny, a statute must serve a compelling state\r\ninterest and be narrowly tailored to serve that interest. White, 536 U.S. at 774–75.\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court supplied the following guidance for\r\ndistinguishing content-based statutes from content-neutral statutes:\r\n\r\n      The principal inquiry in determining content-neutrality . . . is whether\r\n      the government has adopted a regulation of speech because of\r\n      disagreement with the message it conveys. The government's purpose\r\n      is the controlling consideration. A regulation that serves purposes\r\n      unrelated to the content of the expression is deemed neutral, even if it\r\n      has an incidental effect on some speakers or messages but not others.\r\n      Government regulation of expressive activity is content neutral so\r\n      long as it is \"justified without reference to the content of the regulated\r\n      speech.\"\r\n\r\nWard v. Rock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 791 (1989) (quoting Clark v. Cmty.\r\nfor Creative Non-Violence, 468 U.S. 288, 293 (1984)) (citations omitted).\r\n\r\n      The language of the FOIA contains no indication that it is intended to or\r\ndoes distinguish between speech or that it places a greater burden on any particular\r\nmessage. Rather, the FOIA equally burdens all public bodies regardless of the\r\ncontent of their speech. Moreover, the State's purpose in enacting the FOIA, as\r\nexpressed by the General Assembly, was to strengthen our democracy, a purpose\r\n\r\nscrutiny, the highest standard of review. See United States v. Playboy Entm't Grp.,\r\nInc., 529 U.S. 803, 813 (2000).\r\n\nunrelated to the content of the expression. Thus, we conclude the statute is\r\ncontent-neutral and the intermediate scrutiny standard applies.\r\n\r\n       Turning to the freedom of association, when a statute severely affects\r\nassociational rights, such as when an organization is required to accept a member it\r\ndoes not desire, strict scrutiny applies. Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S. 581, 586\r\n(2005); see also Boy Scouts of Am. v. Dale, 530 U.S. 640, 648 (2000) (applying\r\nstrict scrutiny where an association was forced to accept a member it did not\r\ndesire). However, when a statute only incidentally affects associational rights, it is\r\nsubject to the more permissive Clingman standard. Clingman, 544 U.S. at 586–87.\r\nUnder that standard, the statute is constitutional, provided it serves an important\r\ngovernmental interest and is a reasonable and nondiscriminatory restriction on\r\nassociation. Id.\r\n\r\n       Considering the FOIA's impacts upon SCASA's right to associate, we find it\r\nonly incidentally affects that right. It does not bar public bodies from exercising\r\ntheir associational rights, nor does it require them to admit members they do not\r\ndesire. Rather, the FOIA only indirectly impacts SCASA's associational rights by\r\nburdening its ability to effectively associate through the requirement that it open its\r\nmeetings to the public.\r\n\r\n       Also, while the FOIA burdens SCASA's members' right to privacy or\r\nanonymity in their associations, the United States Supreme Court has indicated that\r\nright only merits strong constitutional protection where disclosure of one's\r\nassociation creates a risk of harassment or reprisal. In Patterson, the Court\r\nrecognized the importance of associational privacy but noted that its importance\r\ndepends upon the circumstances, including whether the association expresses\r\ndissident beliefs. Patterson, 357 U.S. at 462. There, the NAACP established that\r\nits members had been subjected to economic reprisals and threats of physical harm\r\nwhen their memberships in the association were made public. Id. at 462. In light\r\nof those circumstances, the Court held the NAACP's right to associational privacy\r\ncould only be constitutionally overcome by a compelling state interest. Id. at 463.\r\nSubsequently, in Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1 (1976), the Court held the Patterson\r\ndecision was inapposite where there was not actual or threatened harassment\r\nsimilar to that in the Patterson case. Id. at 70. More, recently, in Reed, the Court\r\nstated that an individual can prevail on a claim that a statute unconstitutionally\r\ninterferes with his right to associational privacy if he can establish to a reasonable\r\nprobability that disclosure of information identifying him as a member of the\r\n\nassociation would cause him to suffer threats, harassment, or reprisals. Reed, 130\r\nS. Ct. at 2820. Here, the record is devoid of any claim that SCASA expresses\r\ndissident beliefs or that its members would suffer threats, harassment, or reprisal if\r\ntheir membership in SCASA was to be disclosed to the public.\r\n\r\n       Therefore, we conclude the FOIA's impacts on SCASA's associational rights\r\nare subject to the lesser standard of review established in Clingman whereby a\r\nreasonable and nondiscriminatory restriction on association that furthers an\r\nimportant governmental interest is constitutionally permissible. While that\r\nstandard has not been precisely located within the usual tripartite system of\r\nconstitutional review—rational basis, intermediate scrutiny, and strict scrutiny—\r\nwe conclude that it is equivalent to intermediate scrutiny. Like intermediate\r\nscrutiny, the Clingman standard requires an important governmental interest. The\r\nClingman standard also requires that the restriction be nondiscriminatory.\r\nSimilarly, intermediate scrutiny requires that the restriction be nondiscriminatory\r\nbecause it is only applied to content-neutral restrictions on the freedom of speech\r\nand specifically requires an interest unrelated to the suppression of speech.\r\nFinally, the Clingman standard's requirement that the restriction be reasonable is\r\npresumably the equivalent of the intermediate scrutiny standard's requirement that\r\nthe challenged law not burden substantially more speech than necessary.\r\n\r\n      Accordingly, we will employ the intermediate scrutiny standard. If the\r\nFOIA satisfies the intermediate scrutiny standard, it also satisfies the Clingman\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n      C.     Constitutionality\r\n       Finally, we must determine whether the FOIA's impacts on SCASA's speech\r\nand association rights are constitutionally permissible by considering whether the\r\nFOIA serves important governmental interests unrelated to the suppression of free\r\nspeech and does not burden substantially more speech than necessary to advance\r\nthose interests.\r\n\r\n      The FOIA serves the important governmental interests of providing\r\ntransparency in governmental decision-making, preventing fraud and corruption,\r\nand fostering trust in government. An informed electorate is essential to a healthy\r\ndemocracy because members of the public cannot meaningfully cast their votes if\r\nthey are ignorant of what actions the government has taken and the rationale for\r\nthose actions. Furthermore, secret government activity creates fertile ground for\r\n\nfraud and corruption, especially in the area of public expenditures where, without\r\ntransparency, the public can be kept unaware of misappropriations and conflicts of\r\ninterest. As Justice Brandeis wrote, \"[p]ublicity is justly commended as a remedy\r\nfor social and industrial diseases. Sunlight is said to be the best of disinfectants;\r\nelectric light the most efficient policeman.\" L. Brandeis, Other People's Money 62\r\n(National Home Library Foundation ed. 1933). Finally, regardless of whether\r\ngovernmental activity conducted in secrecy actually is nefarious or corrupt, the\r\npublic cannot be expected to possess a high level of trust in that which is hidden\r\nfrom its view. The General Assembly specifically addressed these interests in the\r\nFOIA's legislative findings, and numerous states have made similar findings when\r\nenacting freedom of information laws similar to South Carolina's FOIA.\r\n\r\n       The interests giving rise to the FOIA, and recognition of their foundational\r\nrole in our democracy, trace back to the earliest days of our nation. As James\r\nMadison wrote, \"A popular government, without popular information or the means\r\nof acquiring it, is but a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy; or perhaps both.\r\nKnowledge will forever govern ignorance; And a people who mean to be their own\r\ngovernors, must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.\" Letter\r\nfrom James Madison to W.T. Barry (Aug. 4, 1822), reprinted in The Complete\r\nMadison 337 (S. Padover ed. 1953). John Marshall also acknowledged these\r\ninterests in Virginia's convention on the adoption of the federal constitution,\r\nrecognizing the importance of secrecy in some governmental matters, but\r\ncautioning that secrecy should be employed only \"when it would be fatal and\r\npernicious to publish the schemes of government.\" 3 Debates in the Several State\r\nConventions on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution 233 (J. Elliot ed. 1901).\r\nSee also Patricia M. Wald, The Freedom of Information Act, 33 Emory L.J. 649,\r\n652–54 (1984) (discussing the historical background of freedom of information\r\nlaws). Furthermore, in similar cases, courts have repeatedly recognized the\r\nimportance of these interests and found them sufficient to permit similar intrusions\r\nupon First Amendment rights. Most recently, in Reed, the United States Supreme\r\nCourt considered a First Amendment challenge to the disclosure of referendum\r\npetition signatures pursuant to the Washington Public Records Act (PRA). The\r\nPRA provided that all public documents were to be made available to the public\r\nfor inspection and copying. 130 S. Ct. at 2816. One of the petitioners, an\r\nadvocacy group, collected and submitted signatures to the state in support of\r\nholding a referendum on a recently enacted state law. Id. The respondents then\r\n\nfiled requests pursuant to the PRA for copies of the petitions and declared their\r\nintent to publish the names of the signers online. Id. The petitioners filed suit and\r\na motion for a preliminary injunction on the grounds the PRA, as applied to the\r\nreferendum petitions, violated the First Amendment. Id. at 2816–17. The district\r\ncourt granted the petitioners a preliminary injunction, the United States Court of\r\nAppeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.\r\nId. at 2817. The Supreme Court found the state's interests in eliminating fraud in\r\nthe electoral process and ensuring governmental transparency and accountability\r\nsatisfied the exacting scrutiny standard. Id. at 2819. Thus, the Reed decision is\r\nparticularly instructive both because it establishes that public records disclosure\r\nacts can survive a level of scrutiny more restrictive than the intermediate scrutiny\r\napplicable here and establishes that a state's interests in promoting governmental\r\ntransparency and accountability and in preventing fraud and corruption are strong\r\ngovernmental interests.\r\n\r\n      The United States Supreme Court also considered disclosure requirements in\r\nCitizens United. In that case, the plaintiff asserted a First Amendment challenge to\r\nportions of the federal Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002 that required\r\ndisclosure of who created and funded a political advertisement and the election at\r\nwhich the advertisement was directed. 558 U.S. at 366. Upholding the disclosure\r\nrequirements under the exacting scrutiny standard, the Court again emphasized the\r\ngovernmental interest in transparency, noting the transparency provided by the\r\ndisclosures \"enables the electorate to make informed decisions and give proper\r\nweight to different speakers and messages.\" Id. at 371.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, in Asgeirsson v. Abbott, 773 F. Supp. 2d 684 (W.D. Tex.\r\n2011), aff'd, Case No. 11-50441 (5th Cir. Sept. 25, 2012), the plaintiffs contended\r\nthe Texas Open Meetings Act violated the First Amendment. The Act, similar to\r\nthe open meeting requirement of South Carolina's FOIA, required governmental\r\nbodies to hold their meetings open to the public when discussing public business.\r\nId. at 690. The court concluded that intermediate scrutiny was applicable because\r\nthe statute was content-neutral. Id. at 695. The court then held the Act served\r\nthree compelling interests—providing transparency, preventing fraud and\r\ncorruption, and fostering trust—and survived intermediate scrutiny. Id. at 701–02.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, the Minnesota Supreme Court, considering a First Amendment\r\nchallenge to an open meetings law, held the law served the compelling state\r\ninterests of informing the electorate and allowing the public to express their views.\r\n\nSt. Cloud Newspapers, Inc. v. Dist. 742 Cmty. Sch., 332 N.W.2d 1, 7 (Minn. 1983).\r\nAccordingly, the court held the open meetings law did not unconstitutionally\r\ninterfere with the First Amendment rights of speech and association. Id.\r\n\r\n       The Colorado Supreme Court also upheld an open meetings law under a\r\nFirst Amendment challenge, finding the law served the important governmental\r\ninterest of the public's right to access public information. Cole v. State, 673 P.2d\r\n345, 350 (Colo. 1983). The court, elaborating on that interest, noted that\r\ninformation concerning governmental actions is a necessary prerequisite of self-\r\ngovernment and ensuring public access to such information promotes\r\naccountability. Id.\r\n\r\n      Additionally, the longstanding, universal adoption of freedom of information\r\nlaws by the federal and state governments supports the conclusion that such laws\r\nadvance important governmental interests. The federal government enacted its\r\nFreedom of Information Act in 1966. See Act of September 6, 1966, Pub. L. No.\r\n89-554, 80 Stat. 383 (codified at 5 U.S.C. §§ 552–559 (1970)). The Act requires\r\nfederal agencies to both produce records for public inspection and conduct their\r\nmeetings open to the public. 5 U.S.C. §§ 552, 552b. Every state and the District\r\nof Columbia has also adopted a freedom of information law requiring the\r\ndisclosure of public records and open meetings.6\r\n\r\n\r\n6 Ala.

Code Ann. §§ 2-3-201–221 & 2-6-101–112;\r\n\n       We also find the FOIA does not burden substantially more speech than\r\nnecessary to further those interests. The FOIA exempts certain sensitive records\r\nand meetings from public disclosure, and thus attempts to only implicate that\r\nspeech and association necessary to serve its purposes. See S.C. Code Ann. § 30-\r\n4-40 (Supp. 2011) (exempting certain records from public disclosure); S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 30-4-70 (exempting certain meetings from the open meetings requirement).\r\nFor example, \"correspondence or work products of legal counsel for a public body\"\r\nare exempted from public disclosure, S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-40(a)(7), and\r\n\"[d]iscussion of employment, appointment, compensation, promotion, demotion,\r\ndiscipline, or release of an employee\" is exempted from the open meetings\r\nrequirement, S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-70(a)(1).\r\n\r\n      Of course, the main thrust of SCASA's challenge to the FOIA is that it\r\napplies beyond traditional governmental entities to all public bodies, including\r\nnon-profit corporations engaged in political advocacy. However, the application of\r\nthe FOIA beyond traditional governmental entities is limited to statutorily defined\r\npublic bodies, which are only those entities supported by public funds. Weston,\r\n303 S.C. at 403, 401 S.E.2d at 164. The FOIA also serves these important\r\ngovernmental interests when applied to such entities due to the importance of\r\nensuring transparency and accountability in the expenditure of public funds. We\r\npreviously recognized in Weston that the FOIA is ineffectual if it does not extend\r\nto such bodies, explaining that when an entity receives public funds en masse or\r\nmanages the expenditure of public funds, \"the only way that the public can\r\ndetermine with specificity how those funds were spent is through access to the\r\n\r\nNeb.

If public bodies were not subject to the FOIA,\r\ngovernmental bodies could subvert the FOIA by funneling State funds to non-\r\nprofit corporations so that those corporations could act, outside the public's view,\r\nas proxies for the State.

Examined in light of that limited application, the FOIA\r\ndoes not burden substantially more speech than necessary to accomplish its\r\npurpose. The dissent would read the FOIA as applying to a private organization\r\nthat receives even a negligible amount of public funding for a discrete purpose.\r\nWe made clear in Weston that the FOIA only applies to private entities who\r\nreceive government funds en masse. See Weston, 303 S.C. at 404, 401 S.E.2d at\r\n165. The FOIA would not apply to a private entity that receives public funds for a\r\nspecific purpose. For example, the FOIA would not apply to a private organization\r\nthat receives public funds to operate a childcare center or healthcare clinic.\r\nHowever, the FOIA does apply to any private organization that is generally\r\nsupported by public funds.\r\n\r\n       For the same reasons, we disagree with the dissent's characterization of the\r\nFOIA as improperly imposing conditions on the recipient of funds rather than on\r\nactivities. The recipient versus activities distinction is not particularly apposite\r\nhere because the FOIA does not apply to a recipient of public funds as a condition\r\nof the receipt of the funds. Rather, the general support of an entity through public\r\nfunds brings it within the class of entities to which the FOIA applies.\r\n\r\n                                 CONCLUSION\r\n       We hold the circuit court erred in finding the FOIA unconstitutional under\r\nthe First Amendment when applied to SCASA. The FOIA is a content-neutral\r\nstatute that serves important governmental interests and does not burden\r\nsubstantially more speech than necessary to serve those interests, and therefore, it\r\ndoes not violate SCASA's First Amendment speech and association rights.\r\nHowever, we express no opinion as to whether SCASA is a public body subject to\r\nthe FOIA and leave that issue for determination on remand. For the foregoing\r\nreasons, we reverse the circuit court's dismissal of this case and remand to the\r\ncircuit court for further proceedings.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., and KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in\r\npart and dissenting in part in a separate opinion in which BEATTY, J.,\r\nconcurs.\r\n\nJUSTICE PLEICONES: I respectfully concur in part and dissent in part. I\r\nwholeheartedly agree with the majority regarding the importance of ensuring\r\ntransparency and accountability in the expenditure of public funds, and in my view\r\nFOIA plays a critical part in providing that transparency. But critical\r\ngovernmental interests alone cannot justify undue burdens on First Amendment\r\nrights. In my view, FOIA cannot constitutionally be applied to \"any organization,\r\ncorporation, or agency supported . . . in part by public funds or expending public\r\nfunds\" without regard to the potential application to organizations that may engage\r\nin both public and private functions because to do so may run afoul of First\r\nAmendment rights. I would therefore sever from the definitional section of FOIA\r\nthe language that applies it in sweeping terms to any organization that receives any\r\npublic funds. Whether SCASA is subject to FOIA for other reasons can be\r\nexplored on remand.\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina's Freedom of Information Act, S.C. Code Ann. §§ 30-4-10 et seq.,\r\ndefines a \"public body\" as \"any organization, corporation, or agency supported in\r\nwhole or in part by public funds or expending public funds.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 30-\r\n4-20(a). FOIA requires any such \"public body\" make its records available for\r\npublic inspection and copying and announce and hold its meetings open to the\r\npublic, subject to certain exemptions. §§ 30-4-30 to -90. Failure to comply with\r\nthe requirements subjects both groups and individuals to civil and criminal\r\nliability. §§ 30-4-100 to -110.\r\n\r\nSCASA moved to dismiss Appellant's suit to compel its disclosure of certain\r\nrecords on the basis that the FOIA requirements violate its First Amendment\r\nspeech rights as a private organization engaged in issue advocacy.\r\n\r\n\"It is well established that in the area of freedom of expression an overbroad\r\nregulation may be subject to facial review and invalidation, even though its\r\napplication in the case under consideration may be constitutionally\r\nunobjectionable.\" Forsyth County, Ga. v. Nationalist Movement, 505 U.S. 123,\r\n129 (1992). Thus, we must evaluate SCASA's challenge as a facial one: does\r\nFOIA impermissibly intrude on the First Amendment rights of organizations that\r\nreceive some public funding but are not wholly instrumentalities of the state? As\r\nexplained infra, in my view the sweeping applicability of FOIA disclosure and\r\nopen meetings requirements impermissibly intrudes on First Amendment rights\r\nbecause the requirements apply to any organization that receives any public\r\nfunding without any differentiation of its publicly and privately funded activities.\r\n\nThe First Amendment protects not only the right to speak but also the right not to\r\nspeak and the right to speak in private. See, e.g., Harper & Row Publishers, Inc. v.\r\nNation Enters., 471 U.S. 539, 559 (1985); Buckley v. Valeo, 424 U.S. 1, 64-65\r\n(1976). In addition, it protects the right of an association or organization to\r\ndeliberate internally and to formulate its message without interference. See\r\nHerbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 190 (1979) (\"Through the editorial process\r\nexpression is composed; to regulate the process is therefore to regulate the\r\nexpression.\"); Perry v. Schwarzenegger, 591 F.3d 1126, 1142 n.9 (9th Cir. 2009).\r\nThus, I agree with the majority that FOIA disclosure requirements implicate First\r\nAmendment concerns.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the majority correctly recognizes that the burden FOIA disclosure and\r\nopen meetings requirements impose on speech and association rights is substantial,\r\nimpairing an organization's ability to deliberate internally and outside the presence\r\nof its opponents or to formulate its message in private. See AFL-CIO v. Federal\r\nElection Commission, 333 F.3d 168, 178 (D.C. Cir. 2003) (\"[C]ompel[ling] public\r\ndisclosure of an association's confidential internal materials . . . intrudes on the\r\nprivacy of association and belief guaranteed by the First Amendment [and]\r\nseriously interferes with internal group operations and effectiveness.\"). These\r\nrequirements also impose the substantial burden of legal uncertainty regarding an\r\norganization's obligations and vulnerability to legal attack and even individuals'\r\nliability to criminal charges. See Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission,\r\n130 S.Ct. 876, 889, 891 (2010) (\"Prolix laws chill speech for the same reason that\r\nvague laws chill speech: People of common intelligence must necessarily guess at\r\nthe law's meaning and differ as to its application\"; \"First Amendment standards . . .\r\nmust give the benefit of any doubt to protecting rather than stifling speech.\"\r\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted)).\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is axiomatic that the First Amendment protects only private speech\r\nfrom governmental interference.8 Thus, if an organization is in fact a\r\n\r\n\r\n8 See, e.g., Randall Bezanson and William Buss, The Many Faces of Government\r\nSpeech, 86 Iowa L. Rev. 1377, 1502 (2001) (\"The First Amendment is explicitly\r\ndrafted as a restraint on government: 'Congress shall make no law abridging the\r\nfreedom of speech.' If the government can claim to act as a First Amendment right\r\nholder, the First Amendment loses coherence, for in such situations there is\r\nnothing for the First Amendment to act on or constrain. The idea of government\r\n\ngovernmental entity or wholly a government instrumentality, it does not possess\r\nFirst Amendment rights. Similarly, a public employee speaking in the course and\r\nscope of her duties as a spokesperson for the government's message has no First\r\nAmendment right to avoid restrictions on that speech. See Garcetti v. Ceballos,\r\n547 U.S. 410 (2006). Likewise, when the government engages a private speaker to\r\npromote its message, the resulting communication is not private speech protected\r\nby the First Amendment, and the government is free to restrict it.9 See Rust v.\r\nSullivan, 500 U.S. 173, 192-95 (1991).\r\n\r\nThe requirements at issue here purport to apply only to \"public\" bodies as defined\r\nby § 30-4-20(a). However, the statutory designation of an organization as a\r\n\"public body\" does not establish that an entity functions as a governmental body\r\nfor purposes of a constitutional challenge. See, e.g., Rendell-Baker v. Kohn, 457\r\nU.S. 830, 840-43 (1982) (determining whether actions are fairly attributable to the\r\nstate in § 1983 context).\r\n\r\nOur previous interpretation of \"public funds\" in § 30-4-20(a) somewhat narrows\r\nthe applicability of the FOIA disclosure requirements. We have held that the\r\ndefinition of \"public funds\" excludes \"payment from public bodies in return for\r\nsupplying specific goods or services on an arms[-]length basis.\" Weston v.\r\nCarolina Research and Development Foundation, 303 S.C. 398, 404, 401 S.E.2d\r\n161, 165 (1991). Thus, many businesses and organizations engaging in\r\ntransactions with government entities are not subjected to FOIA requirements.\r\nHowever, FOIA remains applicable to the entirety of any recipient organization if\r\n\"a block of public funds is diverted en masse from a public body to a related\r\norganization, or when the related organization undertakes the management of the\r\n\r\n\r\n'speech' under the First Amendment is thus both illogical and inconsistent with the\r\ntext.\").\r\n9 When the government funds a limited forum for private speech rather than\r\nfunding its own message, a different standard applies. See Legal Services Corp. v.\r\nVelazquez, 531 U.S. 533, 540-42 (2001). Viewpoint-based restrictions are\r\npermissible only when the government funds dissemination of its own message.\r\nId. The FOIA disclosure requirements at issue here are viewpoint neutral,\r\napplying without distinction to a broad range of speech of any organization that\r\nreceives any public funding. Thus, it is unnecessary to determine whether funds to\r\nwhich the requirements attach are provided for the purpose of communicating the\r\ngovernment's own message or funding a limited forum for private speech.\r\n\nexpenditure of public funds . . . .\" Id. The clear language of the statute, we said in\r\nWeston, mandates that an organization receiving public funds in even one\r\ntransaction is a \"public body\" for purposes of FOIA requirements, and construing\r\nthe statute to reach only governmental or quasi-governmental organizations would\r\n\"obliterate both the intent and the clear meaning of the statutory definition.\" 303\r\nS.C. at 403, 401 S.E.2d at 164. Thus, the statute may reach an otherwise private\r\norganization that receives even a negligible amount of public funding for a discrete\r\npurpose.10 In effect, therefore, FOIA disclosure requirements attach as a condition\r\nto the receipt by a private organization of any government funding that is not\r\nexchanged for a specific good or service in an arm's-length transaction. § 30-4-\r\n20(a); Weston, supra.\r\n\r\nGovernment may not impose an unconstitutional condition on the receipt of public\r\nbenefits. See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. at 196-98; Rumsfeld v. Forum for\r\nAcademic and Institutional Rights, Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 59 (2006). A condition is\r\nunconstitutional if it could not be imposed directly. See Rumsfeld, 547 U.S. at 59.\r\n\r\nHere, the conditions imposed by the receipt of any public funding include that\r\nmost of the recipient organization's meetings be on the record and open to the\r\npublic and that many of its records be disclosed to any interested party. Failing to\r\ncomply with these requirements subjects organizations and individuals to civil\r\nliability and criminal penalty.\r\n\r\nAlthough such requirements do not fit readily within any established line of First\r\nAmendment jurisprudence,11 I assume for purposes of analysis that the majority is\r\n\r\n10 At a minimum, for purposes of a First Amendment challenge, we must assume\r\nthat a lay person would read the law in this way. See Citizens United, supra.\r\n11 First Amendment jurisprudence contains two clear lines of disclosure analysis.\r\nOne relates to mandated disclosure of membership lists, primarily implicating the\r\nassociational rights of members. See, e.g., NAACP v. Alabama ex rel. Patterson,\r\n357 U.S. 449 (1958); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415 (1963). The other distinct\r\nline of cases dealing with disclosure relates to the election context, primarily\r\nimplicating political association and somewhat more extensive disclosure, but\r\nmuch less than is required under FOIA. See, e.g., Citizens United, supra; Buckley\r\nv. Valeo, supra; John Doe No. 1 v. Reed, 130 S.Ct. 2811 (2010). Neither is\r\ndirectly applicable to the required disclosure of broad swaths of an organization's\r\ninternal communications, implicating the right to speak privately, deliberate\r\n\ncorrect to evaluate FOIA disclosure and open meetings requirements as content-\r\nneutral time, place, or manner restrictions on speech, thus subject to intermediate\r\nscrutiny. Under this standard, speech regulation must advance a significant,\r\nlegitimate government interest (prong one). See Hill v. Colorado, 530 U.S. 703,\r\n725-26.\r\n\r\nI agree with the majority that FOIA is designed to achieve a significant and\r\nlegitimate government interest in transparency regarding the spending of public\r\nfunds. However, neither the State nor the majority has explained, nor is it\r\napparent, how extending FOIA requirements beyond the publicly subsidized\r\nactivities to entire organizations receiving any public funds advances the legitimate\r\npublic interest at stake. Because the requirements reach activities of an\r\norganization that are unrelated to publicly funded activities, they have not been\r\nshown to advance a legitimate government interest and fail prong one.\r\n\r\nIn addition, to survive intermediate scrutiny, the regulation must be narrowly\r\ntailored so that the means chosen do not \"burden substantially more speech than is\r\nnecessary to further the government's legitimate interests\" (prong two). Ward v.\r\nRock Against Racism, 491 U.S. 781, 799 (1989). Where a statute sweeps broadly\r\nwithout any interest-related purpose for that sweep, it burdens substantially more\r\nspeech than necessary to accomplish its purpose. FCC v. League of Women Voters\r\nof California, 468 U.S. 364, 400 (1984) (disallowing prohibition on any\r\neditorializing as condition of receipt of any government funding). Indeed, in its\r\nunconstitutional conditions analysis, the United States Supreme Court has\r\nemphasized that imposition of a speech-related condition is suspect when it applies\r\nto a recipient rather than to an activity.12 See Rust v. Sullivan, 500 U.S. at 197\r\n\r\n\r\ninternally, formulate a message without interference, and associate effectively.\r\nEven if election-related disclosure precedents were directly applicable in this case,\r\nas the majority applies them for purposes of associational rights, in my view the\r\nmajority has not shown how the restrictions at issue are reasonable in relation to\r\ntheir purpose or are not overbroad. If, for example, an organization received\r\ngovernment funding for a discrete, relatively minor activity in which it acted to\r\nconvey the government's message, there is no reason why its membership list need\r\nbe disclosed in order for the public to know the purpose and manner in which\r\npublic funds were spent. See Clingman v. Beaver, 544 U.S. 581, 590 (2005).\r\n12 The cases cited by the majority as upholding First Amendment challenges to\r\nother states' FOIA requirements are inapposite because, in those cases, the\r\n\n(explaining that a condition's applying to \"the recipient of the subsidy rather than .\r\n. . a particular program or service\" is key to determination (emphasis in original)).\r\nHere, the condition is imposed on the recipient of the funds rather than on the\r\nparticular program or service being funded and thus fails prong two because it\r\nlacks any tailoring. The words of another court, though in a slightly different\r\ncontext,13 are applicable here:\r\n\r\n      Having concluded that the [plaintiffs] have asserted substantial First\r\n      Amendment interests in [avoiding] the disclosure of their own internal\r\n      materials and at least marginal interests in preventing the chilling of\r\n      political participation by their members and officials, we proceed to\r\n      assess the strength of the government's proffered interest in disclosure.\r\n      The Commission offers two justifications . . . . : The regulation deters\r\n      FECA violations, and it promotes the agency's own public\r\n      accountability. Although we have no doubt that these interests are\r\n      valid, we need not engage in a detailed balancing analysis, for the\r\n      Commission made no attempt to tailor its policy to avoid\r\n      unnecessarily burdening the First Amendment rights of the political\r\n      organizations it investigates. See, e.g., United States v. Popa, 187 F.3d\r\n      672, 676 (D.C.Cir.1999) (declining to determine the precise level of\r\n      scrutiny applicable to a particular statute where it was insufficiently\r\n      tailored to meet even the least exacting standard). Indeed, the blanket\r\n      nature of the Commission's regulation—requiring, as it does, the\r\n      release of all information not expressly exempted by FOIA—appears\r\n      to result in the release of significant amounts of information that\r\n      furthers neither goal. For example, the Commission never explains\r\n      how releasing investigatory files will deter future violations in cases\r\n      where, as here, the respondents have been cleared of wrongdoing. Nor\r\n      does the Commission explain how a policy requiring the release of\r\n      materials that played no meaningful role in its decisionmaking process\r\n\r\nrestrictions were challenged as infringements on the First Amendment rights of\r\ngovernment officeholders acting in their official capacities. Those cases did not\r\naddress the constitutionality of extending FOIA requirements to officeholders or\r\nentities engaging in protected activities unrelated to their publicly funded activities.\r\n13 AFL-CIO analyzed a Federal Election Commission policy of publicly\r\ndisseminating all materials obtained in its investigations of organizations accused\r\nof violating election laws.\r\n\n      will promote its own accountability. The facts of this case are\r\n      particularly disturbing because the Commission proposes to release\r\n      between 10,000 and 20,000 pages of documentation that it has never\r\n      examined. The materials therefore cannot shed light on the\r\n      Commission's reasoning, and may not even relate to questionable\r\n      activities. The fact that the Commission redacts information falling\r\n      under one or more FOIA exemptions is no answer, since the Freedom\r\n      of Information Act does little to protect the First Amendment interests\r\n      at issue.\r\n\r\nAFL-CIO v. Federal Election Commission, 333 F.3d 168, 178 (2003). Moreover,\r\nthe potential intrusion on First Amendment rights here is even more disturbing\r\nthan in AFL-CIO: recipient organizations are subjected not to disclosure of\r\nmaterial related to a discrete investigation instigated by an agency with\r\nprosecutorial discretion to decline to investigate spurious accusations but to\r\nperpetual and wide-ranging disclosure requirements at the behest of any individual\r\nor organization. See §§ 30-4-20(b), 30-4-30(a). In addition, as was also the case in\r\nAFL-CIO, the FOIA exemptions do little here to protect the First Amendment\r\ninterests at issue.\r\n\r\nThe burden that is imposed on unrelated exercise of a speaker's First Amendment\r\nrights by the definition of \"public body\" in § 30-4-20(a) has no substantial relation\r\nto the governmental interest at stake. It applies solely by virtue of the fact that the\r\norganization has received public funds, regardless of any relationship between the\r\norganization's publicly and privately funded activities. Thus, the FOIA disclosure\r\nrequirements at issue impose an unconstitutional condition on the exercise of First\r\nAmendment rights.\r\n\r\nIn my view, we must strike as unconstitutional the language \"or in part\" and \"or\r\nexpending public funds\" from § 30-4-20(a). Likewise, I would hold that the\r\ninterpretation of \"quasi-governmental body of the State\" cannot extend to\r\norganizations that engage in activities not fairly attributable to the government\r\nitself. I have no trouble also concluding that such action would not destroy the\r\nlegislative intent of the General Assembly in enacting FOIA, since FOIA would\r\nstill apply to governmental bodies. Stone v. Traynham, 278 S.C. 407, 409-10, 297\r\nS.E.2d 420, 422 (1982) (striking an exemption from a statute only \"as it applies to\r\nappointed bodies\" upon a determination that the action would not destroy\r\nlegislative intent (emphasis in original)). It would be inconceivable the General\r\n\nAssembly would not provide for transparency of governance by public agencies\r\nand other governmental bodies on the basis it could not also apply the same\r\ndisclosure requirements on private organizations in their entirety when they receive\r\nany amount of public funding. Id. This is not to say that organizations private\r\nonly in form would be exempt from FOIA or that appropriately tailored\r\nrequirements could not be upheld.\r\n\r\nThus, I would affirm as modified, holding that the portions of FOIA extending it to\r\norganizations in their entirety upon the receipt of any public funds are facially\r\nunconstitutional and are severed from the statute. I would remand to the trial court\r\nfor further proceedings consistent with this view.\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27287","title":"McHam v.

Trial Proceedings & Direct Appeal\r\n      This case arose out of a stop at a traffic safety checkpoint conducted on May\r\n22, 2002 by the South Carolina Highway Patrol. The checkpoint was at Powell\r\nMill Road near U.S. Highway 29 in Spartanburg County. Three officers were\r\npresent with marked patrol cars. McHam was driving a 1984 Ford Thunderbird\r\nwhen he was stopped at the checkpoint along with his passenger, Kobe Carter, at\r\naround 10:50 p.m. The car was making noises, and McHam's brakes were\r\nsquealing due to mechanical problems as he stopped. Neither of the occupants was\r\nwearing a seat belt.\r\n\r\n       Trooper James Scott Crawford approached McHam and asked for his\r\ndriver's license, registration, and proof of insurance. McHam provided his driver's\r\nlicense, but he and the passenger then began looking in various locations in the\r\nvehicle for the registration and insurance. According to Crawford, he thought\r\n\"[t]hey were making a lot of movements in the car that [he] didn't feel was\r\nconsistent [with] looking for a registration card or a proof of insurance,\" so he\r\nwalked around to the other side \"to make sure they weren't accessing a weapon or\r\nanything like that.\" Once he got around to the passenger's side, the officer could\r\nnot see their hands clearly because it was dark out and there wasn't much artificial\r\nlighting, so \"for [his own] safety he opened up the door to watch what they were\r\ndoing while they were going through the car.\"\r\n\r\n       As soon as Crawford opened the door, he saw \"a baggy of crack that was\r\nsituated . . . between the seat and the passenger's door.\" At first he pretended not\r\nto see it, and he used his radio to summon another trooper. When the second\r\ntrooper, Stephen J. Sulligan, came over, Crawford grabbed the crack, reached in\r\nand shut the car off and took the keys, and then arrested the passenger. A third\r\ntrooper, Jeff Bradley, then arrived. The troopers searched under the car seats for\r\nweapons and noticed a grocery bag with cocaine. McHam was searched and a\r\nlarge amount of cash was found on his person. Marijuana and a small amount of\r\n\ncash were found on the passenger, and more cash was discovered in the car. A set\r\nof digital scales was found near the car during the arrest. McHam was ticketed for\r\na seat belt violation and having faulty equipment on the vehicle, and he was\r\ncharged with trafficking in cocaine and possession of crack cocaine with intent to\r\ndistribute.\r\n\r\n       Trial counsel made an in limine motion at the start of the trial to suppress the\r\ndrug evidence. Counsel argued that, while the officer had the authority to order the\r\noccupants to exit the vehicle and to review the requested documents, there was no\r\narticulable suspicion that they were involved in criminal activity, and the officer\r\nhad no cause to open the car door. Counsel argued this was a routine traffic stop\r\nand if the officer had not opened the car door, the drugs would never have been\r\nfound, so they should be suppressed as the product of an illegal search and seizure\r\nin violation of the Fourth Amendment.1\r\n\r\n        The trial court denied the suppression motion. The court found the initial\r\ntraffic stop was made for a legitimate purpose, and the officer acted reasonably in\r\nopening the car door to enable him to see what the occupants were doing and to\r\nensure his own safety during the traffic stop. The court noted that traffic stops,\r\neven when thought to be routine, were inherently dangerous, especially in the dark,\r\nand stated both sides had acknowledged the officer had the right to remove the\r\ndefendants from the vehicle to ensure his own safety, so opening the door in order\r\nto better view the occupants did not constitute an unreasonable search and any\r\nseizure was not violative of a constitutional provision.\r\n\r\n       During the trial, McHam's counsel did not renew his Fourth Amendment\r\nobjection, although he did object to some of the drug evidence based on the chain\r\nof custody. McHam was convicted of trafficking in cocaine and possession of\r\ncrack cocaine. He was sentenced to concurrent prison terms of twenty-five years\r\nand ten years, respectively, and was fined for each offense.\r\n\r\n       McHam's counsel filed a direct appeal pursuant to Anders v. California, 386\r\nU.S. 738 (1967). The Anders issue raised by counsel was whether the lower court\r\nerred in refusing to suppress the evidence that was seized as a result of an unlawful\r\nsearch of the vehicle McHam was driving. McHam's direct appeal was dismissed\r\nby the Court of Appeals after an Anders review. State v. McHam, 2005-UP-460\r\n(S.C. Ct. App. filed July 26, 2005).\r\n\r\n\r\n1  McHam and his passenger were tried together. Most of these arguments were\r\narticulated by the passenger's counsel, and McHam's counsel joined in the motion.\r\n\nB.    PCR Proceedings\r\n       McHam subsequently filed this PCR matter alleging ineffective assistance of\r\ncounsel. At the PCR hearing, McHam's PCR counsel contended trial counsel was\r\nineffective for failing to contemporaneously object to the admission of the drug\r\nevidence based on an illegal search and seizure. PCR counsel maintained the\r\nofficer's opening of the car door constituted an improper search leading to the\r\nillegal seizure of the drug evidence, and this evidence should have been\r\nsuppressed. Counsel stated that, although trial counsel raised the Fourth\r\nAmendment issue in an in limine motion, he failed to preserve the issue for appeal\r\nas he did not renew his objection on this basis when the drugs were actually\r\nadmitted into evidence at trial. PCR counsel argued McHam was prejudiced\r\nbecause, if the issue had been preserved, it would have been considered on direct\r\nappeal, at which time an appellate court could have ruled the search was unlawful.\r\n\r\n      McHam presented the testimony of his trial counsel, who testified that he\r\nthoroughly investigated the search issue and thought he had a good chance of\r\nprevailing on the suppression motion. However, he conceded that he did not\r\npreserve the issue by objecting when the evidence came in at trial. He also\r\nacknowledged the suppression motion was the most critical part of McHam's trial.\r\n\r\n       The State, in contrast, asserted the opinion of the Court of Appeals did not\r\nappear to dismiss the Anders appeal on a procedural basis as it did not employ that\r\nlanguage. Rather, the State maintained the Fourth Amendment issue was\r\ndismissed on the merits and, as a result, formed no basis for a PCR claim. In\r\naddition, the State reiterated its position that the officer did not violate the Fourth\r\nAmendment as his action was justified by concerns for officer safety.\r\n\r\n       The PCR judge denied McHam's application for relief and dismissed it with\r\nprejudice. The PCR judge found trial counsel's \"representation on the suppression\r\nmotion [] exceed[ed] the standard of reasonableness\" and that he \"was not\r\nineffective for failing to prevail on the suppression motion.\" The PCR judge stated\r\nit appeared the Court of Appeals had reviewed the suppression issue submitted by\r\nMcHam on direct appeal and \"[t]he dismissal of the appeal appears to be on [the]\r\nmerits rather than for a failure to preserve as suggested by [McHam].\" The PCR\r\njudge further noted: \"Anders review requires a review of the appeal to determine if\r\nany issue briefed has merit. In this case, the issue was raised and found to be\r\nwithout merit. Therefore, attorney error, if any, was harmless.\" The PCR judge\r\nconcluded McHam had not demonstrated that his attorney failed to properly argue\r\nthe motion to suppress or that the lack of an objection had led to the dismissal of\r\nhis direct appeal.\r\n\n                          II. STANDARD OF REVIEW\r\n       On certiorari in PCR cases, the Court applies an \"any evidence\" standard of\r\nreview. Terry v. State, 394 S.C. 62, 66, 714 S.E.2d 326, 328 (2011) (citing Cherry\r\nv. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989)). \"This Court will uphold\r\nthe findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative value to\r\nsupport them,\" and it \"will reverse the PCR judge's decision when it is controlled\r\nby an error of law.\" Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886\r\n(2007). This Court gives great deference to the PCR judge's findings of fact and\r\nconclusions of law. Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C. 365, 610 S.E.2d 812 (2005).\r\n\r\n                              III. LAW/ANALYSIS\r\n       McHam contends the PCR judge erred in ruling he did not receive\r\nineffective assistance of counsel. He asserts the PCR judge erroneously assumed\r\nthe Court of Appeals ruled on the merits of the unpreserved search issue when it\r\nconducted an Anders review. McHam argues that, although trial counsel made an\r\nin limine motion to suppress the drug evidence seized as a result of an illegal\r\nsearch, counsel was deficient because he failed to renew the objection when the\r\ndrugs were admitted into evidence at trial, and this failure to preserve a meritorious\r\nissue prejudiced him.\r\n\r\n       In response, the State argues the PCR judge properly held counsel was not\r\nineffective for failing to renew a pretrial suppression motion because the evidence\r\nwas properly admitted at trial and McHam can show no prejudice from counsel's\r\nallegedly deficient performance. The State reiterates the PCR judge's finding that\r\nany attorney error was harmless because an Anders brief was submitted on\r\nMcHam's behalf.\r\n\r\n       Alternatively, the State, quoting State v. Lyles, 381 S.C. 442, 444-45, 673\r\nS.E.2d 811, 813 (2009), acknowledges that \"a decision of the Court of Appeals\r\ndismissing an appeal after conducting a review pursuant to Anders is not a decision\r\non the merits of the appeal, but simply reflects that the appellate court was unable\r\nto ascertain a non-frivolous issue which would require counsel to file a merits\r\nbrief.\" The State asserts if the issue was not considered on the merits, McHam still\r\ndid not show prejudice, as officer safety justified the officer's actions.\r\n\r\n       The United States Supreme Court has set forth a two-pronged test to\r\nestablish ineffective assistance of counsel by which a PCR applicant must show\r\n(1) counsel's performance was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance\r\nprejudiced the defense. Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984);\r\n\nHolden v. State, 393 S.C. 565, 713 S.E.2d 611 (2011). The burden is on the PCR\r\napplicant to prove the allegations in his application. Terry, 394 S.C. at 66, 714\r\nS.E.2d at 329.\r\n\r\nA.    Deficient Performance\r\n        Although the PCR judge found trial counsel was not deficient, it is clear\r\nfrom the record that counsel did not object on Fourth Amendment grounds when\r\nthe drug evidence was admitted at trial. At the PCR hearing, trial counsel was\r\nforthright in acknowledging that he failed to renew his objection. When asked if\r\nhe objected to the drug evidence when it was introduced at trial, counsel admitted:\r\n\"Going back through the transcript it doesn't look like I did object to or at least\r\npreserve my objection during the course of the trial.\" Counsel stated, \"And if that\r\nwere the case, and it wasn't preserved, then he would not have been able to argue\r\nthe most critical piece of his trial, which was the . . . denial of the suppression\r\nmotion.\" Counsel agreed with the characterization by McHam's PCR attorney that\r\nMcHam \"basically [] won or lost the case on that motion of suppression[.]\"\r\nContrary to the PCR judge's determination, we find counsel's failure to renew the\r\nFourth Amendment objection constituted deficient performance that satisfies the\r\nfirst prong of the Strickland test. See Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 442, 334\r\nS.E.2d 813, 814 (1985) (\"The proper measure of counsel's performance remains\r\nwhether he has provided representation within the range of competence required by\r\nattorneys in criminal cases.\").\r\n\r\nB.    Prejudice\r\n       The trial court further found that, even if trial counsel had been deficient,\r\nMcHam was not prejudiced as the merits of the search issue were considered and\r\nrejected on direct appeal when the Court of Appeals conducted an Anders review.\r\n\r\n       Under the second prong of the analysis in Strickland, the PCR applicant\r\n\"must show that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's\r\nunprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been different.\"\r\nStrickland, 466 U.S. at 694. \"A reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to\r\nundermine confidence in the outcome of the trial.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Under the Anders procedure, an appellate court is required to review the\r\nentire record, including the complete trial transcript, for any preserved issues with\r\npotential merit. See State v. Williams, 305 S.C. 116, 117, 406 S.E.2d 357, 358\r\n(1991) (Upon the receipt of an Anders brief and \"the receipt of the pro se brief or\r\nthe expiration of the period to file a pro se brief, this Court will then proceed to\r\n\nreview the record as required by Anders. If no issue of arguable merit is\r\ndiscovered, the appeal will be dismissed and counsel's petition to be relieved will\r\nbe granted. In the event the Court finds any issue(s) of arguable merit, the parties\r\nwill be directed to submit new briefs.\"); State v. Lawrence, 349 S.C. 129, 130, 561\r\nS.E.2d 633, 634 (Ct. App. 2002) (stating \"[a]fter a thorough review of the record in\r\naccordance with Anders v. California and State v. Williams, we find the only\r\npreserved issue at trial is whether the trial court erred in denying Lawrence's\r\nmotion for a directed verdict on the charge of discharging a firearm into an\r\noccupied structure\" (emphasis added) (footnotes omitted)).\r\n\r\n       This Court has previously held that an issue that was raised on direct appeal\r\nbut found to be unpreserved may be raised in the context of a PCR claim alleging\r\nineffective assistance of counsel. McLaughlin v. State, 352 S.C. 476, 575 S.E.2d\r\n841 (2003); Foye v. State, 335 S.C. 586, 518 S.E.2d 265 (1999). Based on the\r\nforegoing, it is clear the Court of Appeals did not consider the merits of the Fourth\r\nAmendment issue because it was not preserved by trial counsel. To the extent the\r\nPCR judge concluded otherwise and based his finding of a lack of prejudice on this\r\nconclusion, he was in error.\r\n\r\n       Since the Fourth Amendment issue was not considered on direct appeal\r\nbecause it was unpreserved, an examination of the merits of the issue is appropriate\r\nin analyzing the prejudice prong in McHam's PCR claim. See generally Sikes v.\r\nState, 323 S.C. 28, 30, 448 S.E.2d 560, 562 (1994) (\"When the defendant claims\r\nthat counsel's failure to articulate a Fourth Amendment claim was ineffective\r\nassistance, [the] defendant must show that such claim is meritorious and that the\r\nverdict would have been different absent the evidence that should have been\r\nexcluded.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n                        Merits of Fourth Amendment Issue\r\n       The Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution guarantees the\r\nright of the people to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures and provides\r\nthat no warrants shall be issued except upon probable cause, supported by oath or\r\naffirmation and particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons or\r\nthings to be seized. U.S. Const. amend. IV. \"A search compromises the individual\r\ninterest in privacy; a seizure deprives the individual of dominion over his or her\r\nperson or property.\" State v. Wright, 391 S.C. 436, 442, 706 S.E.2d 324, 327\r\n(2011) (quoting Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 133 (1990)).\r\n\r\n       \"Temporary detention of individuals during the stop of an automobile by the\r\npolice, even if only for a brief period and for a limited purpose, constitutes a\r\n\n'seizure' of 'persons' within the meaning of [the Fourth Amendment].\" Whren v.\r\nUnited States, 517 U.S. 806, 809-10 (1996). \"An automobile stop is thus subject to\r\nthe constitutional imperative that it not be 'unreasonable' under the circumstances.\"\r\nId. at 810. \"As a general matter, the decision to stop an automobile is reasonable\r\nwhere the police have probable cause to believe that a traffic violation has\r\noccurred.\" Id. (citing Delaware v. Prouse, 440 U.S. 648, 659 (1979) and\r\nPennsylvania v. Mimms, 434 U.S. 106, 109 (1977)). In addition, while detaining a\r\nvehicle at a traffic safety checkpoint constitutes a \"seizure,\" where the checkpoint\r\nserves the public interest and does not impose an unreasonable restriction on one's\r\nliberty, it does not violate Fourth Amendment proscriptions. Mich. Dep't of State\r\nPolice v. Sitz, 496 U.S. 444 (1990); State v. Vickery, 399 S.C. 507, 732 S.E.2d 218\r\n(Ct. App. 2012) .\r\n\r\n       McHam did not challenge the propriety of his initial stop, so the sole focus\r\nof our inquiry is on the validity of the officer's opening of the passenger's side door\r\nof the vehicle McHam was driving. The parties agree that an officer may order the\r\ndriver and any passengers to exit a detained vehicle without violating the Fourth\r\nAmendment. See Mimms, 434 U.S. at 109-10 (holding once a driver has been\r\nlawfully detained, the police may order the driver to exit the vehicle, even in the\r\nabsence of unusual or suspicious behavior, without violating the Fourth\r\nAmendment's prohibition on unreasonable searches and seizures; the Court stated,\r\n\"We think it too plain for argument that the State's proffered justification-the safety\r\nof the officer-is both legitimate and weighty,\" and it \"specifically recognized the\r\ninordinate risk confronting an officer as he approaches a person seated in an\r\nautomobile.\"); Maryland v. Wilson, 519 U.S. 408, 414-15 (1997) (extending the\r\nrule announced in Mimms and \"hold[ing] that an officer making a traffic stop may\r\norder passengers to get out of the car pending completion of the stop\" because the\r\n\"danger to an officer from a traffic stop is likely to be greater when there are\r\npassengers in addition to the driver in the stopped car\"); State v. Banda, 371 S.C.\r\n245, 252-53, 639 S.E.2d 36, 40 (2006) (observing the police may order both the\r\ndriver and the passenger out of a vehicle at a valid stop without violating the\r\nFourth Amendment (citation omitted)).\r\n\r\n       In this case of first impression the Court is asked to decide whether an\r\nofficer may open a car door, based on considerations of officer safety, during an\r\notherwise valid traffic stop without violating the Fourth Amendment. Other\r\njurisdictions that have considered the question under a variety of factual scenarios\r\nhave found officer safety can be a valid justification for opening the door of an\r\noccupied vehicle. The analysis turns on a consideration of (1) whether the act\r\n\nconstituted a search, and (2) whether any search was nevertheless justified under\r\nthe Fourth Amendment.\r\n\r\n      (1) Is it a Search?\r\n      In our view, as to the first point, the officer's opening of the door of an\r\noccupied vehicle constituted a search.\r\n\r\n       In State v. Schlosser, 774 P.2d 1132, 1135-37 (Utah 1989), the court held\r\nthat an officer who opened a car door to see whether the passenger was \"hiding\r\nsomething\" was a search that exceeded the legitimate objectives of the traffic stop.\r\nCiting Arizona v. Hicks, 480 U.S. 321, 325 (1987), the court noted \"even a small\r\nintrusion\" can be an unlawful search under the Fourth Amendment. Id. at 1135.\r\nThe court rejected the plain view doctrine, stating the doctrine requires the officer\r\nto be able to observe what is in open or plain view when he is located where he has\r\na lawful right to be, while here the officer had opened the car door to view portions\r\nof the interior of the car that he could not otherwise see.2 Id. at 1136.\r\n\r\n     The court relied upon the reasoning of the United States Supreme Court in\r\nNew York v. Class, 475 U.S. 106 (1986):\r\n\r\n      In [Class, 475 U.S. at 114-15], the Supreme Court stated that \"a car's\r\n      interior as a whole is . . . subject to Fourth Amendment protection\r\n      from unreasonable intrusions by the police.\" The Court held that an\r\n      officer's opening the driver's door of an automobile to examine the\r\n      vehicle identification number constituted a \"search\" and that the\r\n      search was justified because the officer sought only to uncover the\r\n      VIN, or vehicle identification number, a number required by state law\r\n      to be located in a place ordinarily in plain view from outside the\r\n      vehicle. 475 U.S. at 114, 119, 106 S.Ct. at 966, 969. The Court\r\n      warned, however, that \"[i]f the VIN is in the plain view of someone\r\n      outside the vehicle, there is no justification for governmental intrusion\r\n      into the passenger compartment to see it.\" 475 U.S. at 119, 106 S.Ct.\r\n\r\n2   Cf. State v. Daniels, 252 S.C. 591, 596-97, 167 S.E.2d 621, 623-24 (1969)\r\n(finding an officer investigating a robbery who looked in a vehicle's window and\r\nsaw materials that appeared to be related to the robbery on the back seat did not\r\nengage in a \"search\" as the items were visible from a place where the officer had a\r\nright to be, and he had the duty and the right to seize them without a warrant; the\r\nCourt stated \"[a] seizure of what is in plain view, without a search . . . is not\r\nprohibited by either Constitution.' \" (ellipsis in original) (citation omitted)).\r\n\n      at 969. Clearly, the State has no regulatory interest or justification in\r\n      this case that is similar to the state's interest in Class to justify the\r\n      intrusion into the passenger compartment.\r\n\r\nSchlosser, 774 P.2d at 1135 (ellipsis and second alteration in original).3 The court\r\nin Schlosser noted, however, that the officer \"cited no safety concerns as the basis\r\nfor his actions; he sought only to investigate the possibility that defendants were\r\nengaged in illegal activity, and for that reason he opened the passenger door.\" Id.\r\nat 1137.\r\n\r\n       In Commonwealth v. O'Connor, 487 N.E.2d 238, 239-40 (Mass. App. Ct.\r\n1986), the court held that the defendant's act of reaching below the dash after\r\nseeing the officer did not justify the officer stopping his cruiser and opening the\r\ndoor of the defendant's vehicle, which revealed the presence of cocaine. The court\r\nobserved that, prior to opening the car door, \"the officer made no attempt to\r\nquestion or communicate with the [defendant], nor does the record disclose that he\r\nwas warranted in taking reasonable precautions for his safety.\" Id. (quoting\r\nCommonwealth v. Podgurski, 436 N.E.2d 150, 153 (Mass. 1982). In Podgurski,\r\nthe officer's act of sticking his head inside the slightly ajar sliding door of a\r\nwindowless cargo van, whereupon he discovered the occupants bagging hashish,\r\nwas deemed to constitute a search. 436 N.E.2d at 152-53.\r\n\r\n       In State v. Rhodes, 843 P.2d 927, 928 (Or. 1992) (en banc), the officer found\r\nthe defendant slumped over in a vehicle with the engine running and the door open.\r\nAfter moving the door, the officer smelled alcohol and saw an empty beer can,\r\nleading to a charge of driving under the influence. The defendant argued that an\r\nofficer's \"conduct in further opening [the] pickup door (beyond the three or four\r\n                                            \r\ninches it already was open) was a 'search'\" and the evidence seen should be\r\nsuppressed. Id. at 929-30. The court defined a \"search\" as \"an intrusion by a\r\ngovernmental officer, agent, or employee into the protected privacy interest of an\r\nindividual.\" Id. at 930. The court explained that the officer \"physically grasped\r\nthe vehicle's door and moved it, exposing the inside of the passenger compartment\r\n\r\n\r\n3 The Supreme Court in Class found the reasonableness of the intrusion should be\r\nmeasured by balancing the nature and quality of the intrusion on the individual's\r\nFourth Amendment interests against the importance of the governmental interests\r\nalleged to justify the intrusion. Class, 475 U.S. at 118. Thus, the occupants'\r\nexpectations of privacy, which are less in a vehicle than one's home, should be\r\nbalanced against the government's offered justification of officer safety. See id. at\r\n112-13, 117-18.\r\n\nto a visual inspection of a scope and intensity that, so far as this record shows,\r\ncould not have been made without opening the door.\" Id. \"In other words [the\r\nofficer's] action permitted him to observe and smell what he otherwise could not\r\nhave seen or smelled from a lawful vantage point. That was a search.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Although we are aware of contrary authority, we find the above reasoning to\r\nbe persuasive and hold the opening of the door of an occupied vehicle is an\r\nintrusion, however slight, that generally constitutes a search for purposes of the\r\nFourth Amendment. In such cases, a search results based on the fact that it enables\r\nthe officer to observe portions of the interior of the vehicle that would not\r\notherwise be readily visible to those who are outside the vehicle. See id.\r\n\r\n      (2) Is the Search Justified by an Exception to the Warrant Requirement?\r\n      Having determined the officer's conduct constitutes a search, the next point\r\nfor consideration is whether the search was, nevertheless, justified because \"[t]he\r\nFourth Amendment by its terms prohibits [only] 'unreasonable' searches and\r\nseizures.\" Class, 475 U.S. at 116.\r\n\r\n       \"The touchstone of our analysis under the Fourth Amendment is always 'the\r\nreasonableness in all the circumstances of the particular governmental invasion of\r\na citizen's personal security.' \" Mimms, 434 U.S. at 108-09 (quoting Terry v. Ohio,\r\n392 U.S. 1, 19 (1968)). \"Reasonableness, of course, depends 'on a balance\r\nbetween the public interest and the individual's right to personal security free from\r\narbitrary interference by law officers.' \" Id. at 109 (citation omitted).\r\n\r\n       \"Warrantless searches and seizures are unreasonable absent a recognized\r\nexception to the warrant requirement.\" State v.

App. 2008); see also Wright, 391 S.C. at\r\n444, 706 S.E.2d at 327-28 (discussing an exception for exigent circumstances);\r\nState v. Herring, 387 S.C. 201, 210, 692 S.E.2d 490, 494-95 (2009) (same).\r\n\r\n      Governmental interest in officer safety has been recognized to be a\r\nsubstantial one, and we hold as a general principle that officer safety can justify the\r\nopening of a door to an occupied vehicle under reasonable circumstances. See\r\nMimms, 434 U.S. at 110 (observing the governmental interest in officer safety\r\nduring a traffic stop is substantial); State v. Brake, 103 P.3d 699, 704-05 (Utah\r\n\n2004) (stating there is \"a well-developed body of law which recognizes the\r\ninherent dangers of traffic encounters and responds to those dangers by permitting\r\nlaw enforcement officers to take measures to protect their safety without risk of\r\nviolating constitutional protections\"; the court further stated [t]he inherent danger\r\nin traffic stops does not, however, justify the warrantless search of the interior of a\r\nvehicle,\" and \"a warrantless automobile search requires probable cause and exigent\r\ncircumstances unless it satisfies traditionally recognized justifications of protecting\r\nthe safety of police or the public or preventing the destruction of evidence\"\r\n(emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n       In the current appeal, the officer observed McHam and his passenger make\r\nwhat he described as unusual movements in areas where he did not think a person\r\nwould normally look for registration or insurance papers, and he testified that he\r\nwanted to be able to see the hands of the occupants for his own safety, in case they\r\nhad weapons. Although no weapons were ultimately found in the car, when\r\nviewed at the time of the officer's confrontation, we believe the evidence supports\r\na determination that officer safety was a legitimate concern, given the dimly-lit\r\nconditions at the scene of the stop, the presence of more than one occupant in the\r\nvehicle, the fact that the officer was the only one approaching the vehicle at that\r\nmoment, and the actions of the occupants.\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we find that, even if trial counsel had renewed his\r\nmotion in order to preserve the issue, McHam has not shown there is a reasonable\r\nprobability that the outcome of the trial would have been different because his\r\nFourth Amendment claim fails on its merits. Under these circumstances, McHam\r\nhas not established the requisite prejudice to support his claim of ineffective\r\nassistance of counsel. See generally Foye v. State, 335 S.C. 586, 518 S.E.2d 265\r\n(1999) (holding PCR was properly denied where the applicant did not prove he\r\nwas prejudiced by trial counsel's deficient performance in failing to preserve an\r\nissue at trial).                IV. CONCLUSION\r\n       We hold the PCR judge erred in finding counsel was not deficient and we\r\nconclude counsel's failure to renew an objection to the drug evidence did constitute\r\ndeficient performance that satisfied the first prong of Strickland. To the extent the\r\nPCR judge alternatively found McHam had not satisfied the second prong of\r\nStrickland—prejudice—because the merits of his Fourth Amendment issue were\r\nconsidered in his direct appeal and rejected, we also find this was error. An\r\nappellate court conducting an Anders review searches only for preserved issues of\r\narguable merit. Since the Fourth Amendment issue was not preserved, it was not\r\n\nconsidered on direct appeal. However, we agree with the PCR judge's ultimate\r\nfindings that McHam did not establish prejudice and did not prove his claim for\r\nineffective assistance of counsel as we conclude McHam's Fourth Amendment\r\nclaim fails on its merits. Consequently, the decision of the PCR judge is affirmed\r\nas modified.4\r\n\r\n        AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.

Dudek,\r\nof Columbia, and Assistant Public Defender Shane E.\r\nGoranson, of Greenwood, for Amicus Curiae, Anthony\r\nNation.\r\n\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Jennifer Dykes appeals the circuit court's order\r\nrequiring that she be subject to satellite monitoring for the rest of her life pursuant\r\nto sections 23-3-540(C) and (H) of the South Carolina Code of Laws (Supp. 2011).\r\nWe affirm as modified.\r\n\r\nSection 23-3-540 represents a codification of what is commonly referred to as\r\nJessica's Law. Many states have some version of this law, which was enacted in\r\nmemory of Jessica Lunsford, a nine-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by\r\na convicted sex offender in Florida. Across the country, these laws heightened\r\ncriminal sentences and post-release monitoring of child sex offenders. The\r\nspecific issue presented in this case concerns the mandate for lifetime global\r\npositioning satellite monitoring with no judicial review. The complete absence of\r\njudicial review under South Carolina's legislative scheme is more stringent than the\r\nstatutory scheme of other jurisdictions. A common approach among other states is\r\neither to require a predicate finding of probability to re-offend or to provide a\r\njudicial review process, which allows for, upon a proper showing, a court order\r\nreleasing the offender from the satellite monitoring requirements. See generally,\r\nN.C. Gen. Stat. Ann. § 14-208.43 (West 2010) (providing a termination procedure\r\none year after the imposition of the satellite based monitoring or a risk assessment\r\nfor certain offenders). While we hold that the statute's initial mandatory imposition\r\nof satellite monitoring is constitutional, the lifetime requirement without judicial\r\nreview is unconstitutional.               I.\r\nDykes, when twenty-six years old, was indicted for lewd act on a minor in\r\nviolation of Section 16-15-140 of the South Carolina Code (2006) as a result of her\r\nsexual relationship with a fourteen-year-old female. Dykes pled guilty to lewd act\r\non a minor and was sentenced to fifteen years' imprisonment, suspended upon the\r\nservice of three years and five years' probation.1\r\n\r\nUpon her release, Dykes was notified verbally and in writing that pursuant to\r\nsection 23-3-540(C) she would be placed on satellite monitoring if she were to\r\n\r\n1 Because her offense predated the satellite monitoring statute, she was not subject\r\nto monitoring at the time of her plea.\r\n\nviolate the terms of her probation. Shortly thereafter, Dykes violated her probation\r\nin multiple respects.2 Dykes did not contest any of these violations, though she did\r\noffer testimony in mitigation.\r\n\r\nThe State recommended a two-year partial revocation of Dykes' probation and\r\nmandatory lifetime satellite monitoring. S.C. Code Ann. section 23-3-540(A)\r\nmandates that when an individual has been convicted of engaging in or attempting\r\ncriminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree (CSC-First) or lewd act on\r\na minor, the court must order that person placed on satellite monitoring. Likewise,\r\nif a person has been convicted of such offenses before the effective date of the\r\nstatute and violates a term of her probation, parole, or supervision program, she\r\nmust also be placed on satellite monitoring. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(C).\r\nThe individual must remain on monitoring for as long as she is to remain on the\r\nsex offender registry, which is for life. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(H); see also\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-460 (requiring biannual registration for life).3\r\nSignificantly, the lifetime monitoring requirement for one convicted of CSC-First\r\nor lewd act on a minor is not subject to any judicial review process. See S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 23-3-540(H) (prohibiting judicial review of the lifetime monitoring for\r\nCSC-First and lewd act on a minor).\r\n\r\nIn contrast, if a person is convicted of committing or attempting any offense which\r\nrequires registration as a sex offender other than CSC-First or lewd act on a minor,\r\nthe court has discretion with respect to whether the individual should be placed on\r\nsatellite monitoring. See S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(B), (D), (G)(1).4 In addition,\r\n\r\n\r\n2 Five citations and arrest warrants were issued to her for various probation\r\nviolations: a citation pertaining to her relationship with a convicted felon whom\r\nDykes met while incarcerated and with whom she was then residing; an arrest\r\nwarrant for Dykes' continued relationship with that individual; a citation for\r\ndrinking an alcoholic beverage; a citation for being terminated from sex offender\r\ncounseling after she cancelled or rescheduled too many appointments; and an arrest\r\nwarrant for failing to maintain an approved residence and changing her address\r\nwithout the knowledge or consent of her probation agent.\r\n3Once activated, the monitor can pinpoint the individual's location to within fifteen\r\nmeters.\r\n\nafter ten years, an individual who has committed the above-stated crimes may\r\npetition the court to have the monitoring removed upon a showing that she has\r\ncomplied with the monitoring requirements and there is no longer a need to\r\ncontinue monitoring her. If the court denies her petition, she may petition again\r\nevery five years.5 S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(H).\r\n\r\n                                        II.\r\nAt her probation revocation hearing, Dykes objected to the constitutionality of\r\nmandatory lifetime monitoring. In support of her arguments, Dykes presented\r\nexpert testimony that she poses a low risk of reoffending and that one's risk of\r\nreoffending cannot be determined solely by the offense committed. The State\r\noffered no evidence, relying instead on the mandatory, nondiscretionary\r\nrequirement of the statute.\r\n\r\nThe circuit court found Dykes to be in willful violation of her probation and that\r\nshe had notice of the potential for satellite monitoring. The court denied Dykes'\r\nconstitutional challenges and found it was statutorily mandated to impose satellite\r\nmonitoring without making any findings as to Dykes' likelihood of reoffending.\r\nThe court also revoked Dykes' probation for two years, but it ordered that her\r\nprobation be terminated upon release. This appeal followed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4 The offenses include: criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the second degree;\r\nengaging a child for sexual performance; producing, directing, or promoting sexual\r\nperformance by a child; assaults with intent to commit criminal sexual conduct\r\ninvolving a minor; violation of the laws concerning obscenity, material harmful to\r\nminors, child exploitation, and child prostitution; kidnapping of a person under the\r\nage of eighteen unless the defendant is a parent; and trafficking in persons under\r\nthe age of eighteen if the offense includes a completed or attempted criminal\r\nsexual offense. S.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-540(G)(1).\r\n5As long as the individual is being monitored, she must comply with all the terms\r\nset by the State, report damage to the device, pay for the costs of the monitoring\r\n(unless she can show financial hardship), and not remove or tamper with the\r\ndevice; failure to follow these rules may result in criminal penalties. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. §§ 23-3-540(I) to (L).\r\n\n                                         III.\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment provides that no person shall be deprived of life,\r\nliberty, or property without due process of law. U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1.\r\nDykes contends that the imposition of mandatory, lifetime satellite monitoring\r\nwithout consideration of her likelihood of re-offending violates her due process\r\nrights.                                   A.\r\nDykes asserts she has a fundamental right to be \"let alone.\" We disagree. The\r\nUnited States Supreme Court has cautioned restraint in the recognition of rights\r\ndeemed to be fundamental in a constitutional sense. See Washington v.\r\nGlucksberg, 521 U.S. 702 (1997) (noting the Supreme Court's reluctance to expand\r\nthe concept of substantive due process). Indeed, courts must \"exercise the utmost\r\ncare whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the liberty\r\nprotected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy\r\npreferences of [members of the judiciary].\" Id. at 720. The Due Process Clause\r\nprotects only \"those fundamental rights and liberties which are, objectively, 'deeply\r\nrooted in this Nation's history and tradition.'\" Id. at 720-21 (internal citations\r\nomitted). We reject the suggestion that a convicted child sex offender has a\r\nfundamental right to be \"let alone\" that is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's history\r\nand tradition.\"\r\n\r\nOur rejection of Dykes' fundamental right argument flows in part from the premise\r\nthat satellite monitoring is predominantly civil. See Smith v. Doe, 538 U.S. 84\r\n(2003) (noting that whether a statute is criminal or civil primarily is a question of\r\nstatutory construction). Where, as here, the legislature deems a statutory scheme\r\ncivil, \"only the clearest proof\" will transform a civil regulatory scheme into that\r\nwhich imposes a criminal penalty. Id. at 92 (quoting Hudson v. United States, 522\r\nU.S. 93, 100 (1997)) (internal quotations omitted).\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the absence of a fundamental right, we do find that lifetime\r\nimposition of satellite monitoring implicates a protected liberty interest to be free\r\nfrom permanent, unwarranted governmental interference. We agree with other\r\njurisdictions that have held the requirement of satellite monitoring places\r\nsignificant restraints on offenders that amount to a liberty interest. See\r\n\nCommonwealth v. Cory, 911 N.E.2d 187, 196 (Mass. 2009) (finding satellite\r\nmonitoring burdens an offender's liberty interest in two ways, by \"its permanent,\r\nphysical attachment to the offender, and by its continuous surveillance of the\r\noffender's activities\"); United States v. Smedley, 611 F.Supp.2d 971, 975 (E.D. Mo.\r\n2009) (holding that imposing home detention with electronic monitoring as\r\ncondition of release impinged on liberty interest); United States v. Merritt, 612\r\nF.Supp.2d 1074, 1079 (D. Neb. 2009) (stating that \"[a] curfew with electronic\r\nmonitoring restricts the defendant's ability to move about at will and implicates a\r\nliberty interest protected under the Due Process Clause\"); State v. Stines, 683\r\nS.E.2d 411 (N.C. Ct. App. 2009) (holding that requiring enrollment in satellite-\r\nbased monitoring program deprives an offender of a significant liberty interest).\r\nTherefore, having served her sentence, Dykes' mandatory enrollment in the\r\nsatellite monitoring program invokes minimal due process protection.\r\n\r\nThus, courts must \"ensure[] that legislation which deprives a person of a life,\r\nliberty, or property right have, at a minimum, a rational basis, and not be\r\narbitrary . . . .\" In re Treatment and Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 139-40,\r\n568 S.E.2d 338, 346 (2002); see also Nebbia v. N.Y., 291 U.S. 502, 525 (1934)\r\n(\"[T]he guarant[ee] of due process, as has often been held, demands only that the\r\nlaw shall not be unreasonable, arbitrary, or capricious . . . .\"); Hamilton v. Bd. of\r\nTrs. of Oconee Cnty. Sch. Dist., 282 S.C. 519, 319 S.E.2d 717 (Ct. App. 1984)\r\n(holding that, to comport with due process, the legislation must have a rational\r\nbasis for the deprivation and may not be \"so inadequate that the judiciary will\r\ncharacterize it as arbitrary\").           B.\r\nThe General Assembly has expressly outlined the purpose of the state's sex\r\noffender registration and electronic monitoring provisions:\r\n\r\n      The intent of this article is to promote the state's fundamental right to\r\n      provide for the public health, welfare, and safety of its citizens\r\n      [by] . . . provid[ing] law enforcement with the tools needed in\r\n      investigating criminal offenses. Statistics show that sex offenders\r\n      often pose a high risk of reoffending. Additionally, law enforcement's\r\n      efforts to protect communities, conduct investigations, and apprehend\r\n      offenders who commit sex offenses are impaired by the lack of\r\n      information about these convicted offenders who live within the law\r\n      enforcement agency's jurisdiction.\r\n\nS.C. Code Ann. § 23-3-400 (2007). This Court has examined this language and\r\nheld \"it is clear the General Assembly did not intend to punish sex offenders, but\r\ninstead intended to protect the public from those sex offenders who may re-offend\r\nand to aid law enforcement in solving sex crimes.\" State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26, 31,\r\n558 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2002). Thus, a likelihood of re-offending lies at the core of\r\nSouth Carolina's civil statutory scheme.\r\n\r\nIn light of the General Assembly's stated purpose of protecting the public from sex\r\noffenders and aiding law enforcement, we find that the initial mandatory\r\nimposition of satellite monitoring for certain child-sex crimes satisfies the rational\r\nrelationship test. Accordingly, we find constitutional the baseline requirement of\r\nsection 23-3-540(C) that individuals convicted of CSC-First or lewd act on a minor\r\nmandatorily submit to electronic monitoring upon their release from incarceration\r\nor violation of their probation or parole.\r\n\r\nAlthough we find the initial mandatory imposition of satellite monitoring under\r\nsection 23-3-540(C) constitutional, we believe the final sentence of section 23-3-\r\n540(H) is unconstitutional, for it precludes judicial review for persons convicted of\r\nCSC-First or lewd act on a minor.6 The complete absence of any opportunity for\r\njudicial review to assess a risk of re-offending, which is beyond the norm of\r\nJessica's law, is arbitrary and cannot be deemed rationally related to the\r\nlegislature's stated purpose of protecting the public from those with a high risk of\r\nre-offending. See Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 139-40, 568 S.E.2d at 346 (finding due\r\nprocess ensures that a statute which deprives a person of a liberty interest has \"at a\r\nminimum, a rational basis, and may not be arbitrary\"); see also Lyng v. Int'l\r\nUnion, 485 U.S. 360, 375 (1988) (Marshall, J., dissenting) (noting that although\r\nallegedly arbitrary legislation invokes the least intrusive rational basis test, that\r\nstandard of review \"is not a toothless one\") (quoting Matthews v. De Castro, 429\r\nU.S. 181, 185 (1976))); Addington v. Texas, 441 U.S. 418, 427 (1979) (noting that\r\nalthough Texas has legitimate interest to protect the community from those that are\r\nmentally ill, Texas \"has no interest in confining individuals involuntarily if they\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6 \"A person may not petition the court if the person is required to register pursuant\r\nto this article for committing criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first\r\ndegree, pursuant to Section 16-3-655(A)(1), or committing or attempting a lewd\r\nact upon a child under sixteen, pursuant to Section 16-15-140.\"\r\n\nare not mentally ill or if they do not pose some danger to themselves or others\").7\r\nThus, we hold it is unconstitutional to impose lifetime satellite monitoring with no\r\nopportunity for judicial review, as is the case with CSC-First or lewd act pursuant\r\nto section 23-3-540(H).\r\n\r\nThe finding of unconstitutionality with respect to the non-reviewable lifetime\r\nmonitoring requirement in section 23-3-540(H) does not require that we invalidate\r\nthe remainder of the statute. This is so because of the legislature's inclusion of a\r\nseverability clause. See 2006 Act No. 346 § 8 (stating that if a court were to find\r\nany portion of the statute unconstitutional, that holding does not affect the rest of\r\nthe statute and the General Assembly would have passed it without that ineffective\r\npart). The only provision invalidated by today's decision is the portion of section\r\n23-3-540(H) that prohibits only those convicted of CSC-First and lewd act on a\r\nminor from petitioning for judicial relief from the satellite monitoring.8\r\n\r\n7 This finding of arbitrariness is additionally supported by the South Carolina\r\nConstitution, which, unlike the United States Constitution, has an express privacy\r\nprovision. See S.C. Const. art. I, § 10 (\"The right of the people to be secure in their\r\npersons, houses, papers, and effects against unreasonable searches and seizures and\r\nunreasonable invasions of privacy shall not be violated . . . .\"). Our constitution's\r\nprivacy provision informs the analysis of whether a state law is arbitrary and lends\r\nadditional support to the conclusion that section 23-3-540(H)'s preclusion of\r\njudicial review for those offenders mandated to satellite monitoring under section\r\n23-3-540(C) is unconstitutional. Cf. State v. Weaver, 374 S.C. 313, 649 S.E.2d\r\n479 (2007) (holding that by articulating a specific prohibition against unreasonable\r\ninvasions of privacy, the people of South Carolina have indicated a higher level of\r\nprivacy protection than the federal Constitution).\r\n8 We respond to the dissent in two respects. First, the dissent misapprehends our\r\nposition by its suggestion that \"[f]ormulating the right by couching it in terms of a\r\nspecific class of persons fails to appreciate the extent of the right at stake\" and that\r\n\"the Constitution does not recognize separate rights for different classes of citizens\r\nand instead guarantees rights to all American citizens.\" Certainly, in the abstract,\r\npeople generally have a right to be let alone. Respectfully, however, fundamental\r\nrights are not to be defined or examined in a vacuum, but rather must be viewed in\r\nthe context of the situation presented. Even the dissent's analysis so\r\nacknowledges, as it refers to Dykes's status, stating \"when viewed in light of the\r\nfacts of this case\" and quoting Justice Kennedy's opinion in Lawrence v. Texas,\r\n\nConsequently, Dykes and others similarly situated must comply with the\r\nmonitoring requirement mandated by section 23-3-540(C). However, persons\r\nconvicted of CSC-First and lewd act on a minor are entitled to avail themselves of\r\nthe section 23-3-540(H) judicial review process as outlined for the balance of the\r\noffenses enumerated in section 23-3-540(G). We affirm the circuit court as\r\nmodified.9\r\n\r\n539 U.S. 558, 562 (2003), in which he observed that \"[l]iberty protects the person\r\nfrom unwarranted government intrusions . . . .\" (emphasis added). The dissent's\r\nmultiple invocations of the word \"unwarranted\" with regard to government\r\nintrusions necessarily implicate a context-specific analysis when examining the\r\nright asserted. Compare District of Columbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008)\r\n(holding the Second Amendment confers to an individual the right to keep and bear\r\narms) with 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(1) (2012) (unlawful for a person with a prior felony\r\nconviction to possess a firearm). Indeed, the question before us is whether the\r\nstate may constitutionally impose civil satellite monitoring for convicted child sex\r\noffenders. In the context of this case, as much as the dissent wishes otherwise,\r\nDykes cannot avoid her unalterable status as a convicted child sex offender, and\r\npursuant to Glucksberg, she holds no fundamental right to be let alone.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the dissent attributes to the majority a position we have never taken.\r\nWith our opinion today, we have not, as the dissent suggests, upheld mandatory\r\nlifetime monitoring with no judicial review for assessment of the risk of\r\nreoffending. In fact, although refusing to recognize a fundamental right, we have\r\nfound the statutorily prescribed mandatory lifetime monitoring without a risk\r\nassessment is arbitrary and therefore unconstitutional. Going forward, pursuant to\r\nthe savings clause and despite the dissent's suggestion to the contrary, Dykes and\r\nothers similarly situated are entitled to periodic judicial reviews under section 23-\r\n3-540(H) to determine if satellite monitoring remains necessary.\r\n9 In addition to her substantive due process claim, Dykes asserts constitutional\r\nviolations of procedural due process, the prohibition on ex post facto laws, equal\r\nprotection, and unreasonable search and seizure. We reject her additional claims\r\npursuant to Rule 220, SCACR, and the following authorities: Connecticut v. Doe,\r\n538 U.S. 1, 8 (2003) (rejecting sex offender's due process argument requesting a\r\nhearing on his current level of dangerousness, and stating those \"who assert a right\r\nto a hearing under the Due Process Clause must show that the facts they seek to\r\n\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., concurs.

Jimeno, 500 U.S. 248, 250 (1991) (\"The Fourth Amendment\r\ndoes not proscribe all state-initiated searches and seizures; it merely proscribes\r\nthose which are unreasonable.\").\r\n\n       JUSTICE HEARN: Respectfully, I dissent. Because I believe Dykes'\r\nstatus as a sex offender does not diminish her entitlement to certain fundamental\r\nrights, I would hold section 23-3-540(C) is unconstitutional because it is not\r\nnarrowly tailored. I express no opinion on the constitutionality of section 23-3-\r\n540(H) because that subsection was never challenged and is thus not before us. 10\r\nDykes' argument is, and always has been, that subsection (C) of 23-3-540—the\r\nprovision requiring lifetime satellite monitoring for persons who violate a term of\r\nprobation and were convicted of committing criminal sexual conduct with a minor\r\nin the first degree or committing or attempting a lewd act upon a child under\r\nsixteen—violates her substantive due process rights by imposing monitoring\r\nwithout any showing of her likelihood to reoffend. By invalidating a statutory\r\nprovision not challenged, the majority ignores those settled principles of error\r\npreservation and appellate jurisprudence, and awards Dykes a consolation prize she\r\nhas never requested and arguably has no standing to accept.\r\n\r\n      Proceeding to the question presented, I agree with Dykes that subsection (C)\r\nof 23-3-540 unconstitutionally infringes on her right to substantive due process.\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution's command that\r\n\"[n]o state shall . . . deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due\r\nprocess of law,\" U.S. Const. amend. XIV, § 1, guarantees more than just fair\r\nprocess; it \"cover[s] a substantive sphere as well, 'barring certain government\r\nactions regardless of the fairness of the procedures used to implement them,'\"\r\n\r\n10 I question whether Dykes would even have standing to challenge subsection (H).\r\nThe constitutional minimum of standing requires the showing of \"an injury in\r\nfact—an invasion of a legally protected interest which is (a) concrete and\r\nparticularized, and (b) actual or imminent, not conjectural or hypothetical,\" a\r\ncausal connection between the injury and the challenged action, and evidence that\r\nthe injury will be redressed by a favorable decision. Sea Pines Ass'n for Prot. of\r\nWildlife, Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Natural Res., 345 S.C. 594, 601, 550 S.E.2d 287, 291\r\n(2001) (quoting Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560 (1992) (internal\r\nquotations and citations omitted)). Here, Dykes would fail the initial inquiry\r\nbecause she cannot demonstrate any particularized, imminent injury. Subsection\r\n(H) allows a person to petition the court for release from electronic monitoring\r\n\"[t]en years from the date the person begins to be electronically monitored.\"\r\nDykes was ordered to begin GPS monitoring on April 22, 2010 and would\r\ntherefore not be eligible to avail herself of this provision until 2018. Any claim\r\nthat she suffered an injury under subsection (H) would be speculative at this point.\r\n\nCounty of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. 833, 840 (1998) (quoting Daniels v.\r\nWilliams, 474 U.S. 327, 331 (1986)). The core of the Due Process Clause,\r\ntherefore, is the protection against arbitrary governmental action. Id. at 845.\r\n\r\n       However, one does not have a right to be free from government action\r\nmerely because a law is arbitrary or unreasonable. See Moore v. City of E.\r\nCleveland, 431 U.S. 494, 544 (1977) (White, J., dissenting.). Rather, \"the\r\nsubstantive component of the due process clause only protects from arbitrary\r\ngovernment action that infringes a specific liberty interest.\" Hawkins v. Freeman,\r\n195 F.3d 732, 749 (4th Cir. 1999) (en banc). Substantive due process in particular\r\nprotects against the arbitrary infringement of \"fundamental rights that are so\r\n'implicit in the concept of ordered liberty' that 'neither liberty nor justice would\r\nexist if they were sacrificed.'\" Doe v. Moore, 410 F.3d 1337, 1342–43 (11th Cir.\r\n2005) (quoting Palko v. Connecticut, 302 U.S. 319, 325–26 (1937), overruled on\r\nother grounds by Benton v. Maryland, 395 U.S. 784 (1969)). If the interest\r\ninfringed upon is a fundamental right, the statute must be \"narrowly tailored to\r\nserve a compelling state interest.\" Reno v. Flores, 507 U.S. 292, 302 (1993); In re\r\nTreatment & Care of Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. 122, 140, 568 S.E.2d 338, 347 (2002).\r\nIf the right is not fundamental, the statute is only subject to rational basis review.\r\nLuckabaugh, 351 S.C. at 140, 568 S.E.2d at 347. Accordingly, the initial inquiry is\r\nwhether the alleged right impacted by the statute is fundamental.\r\n\r\n       As a threshold matter, I acknowledge the Court must tread carefully in this\r\narena. Over the years, the United States Supreme Court has acknowledged the\r\n\"liberty\" protected by the Due Process Clause extends beyond the specific\r\nfreedoms contained in the Bill of Rights. Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702,\r\n720 (1997) (noting that the Supreme Court has found the right to marry, have\r\nchildren, direct the education of one's children, marital privacy, use contraception,\r\nretain bodily integrity, and receive an abortion are all protected). The Supreme\r\nCourt, however, \"has always been reluctant to expand the concept of substantive\r\ndue process because guideposts for responsible decisionmaking in this uncharted\r\narea are scarce and open-ended.\" Collins v. City of Harker Heights, 503 U.S. 115,\r\n125 (1992). Furthermore, when a court recognizes a right as fundamental under\r\nthe umbrella of substantive due process, it effectively removes the matter from the\r\ndemocratic process. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720. We must therefore \"exercise the\r\nutmost care whenever we are asked to break new ground in this field, lest the\r\nliberty protected by the Due Process Clause be subtly transformed into the policy\r\npreferences of the Members of this Court.\" Id. (internal citations and quotations\r\n\nomitted). Hence, the Due Process Clause only \"protects those fundamental rights\r\nand liberties which are, objectively, deeply rooted in this Nation's history and\r\ntradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that neither liberty nor\r\njustice would exist if they were sacrificed.\" See id. at 720–21 (internal citations\r\nand quotations omitted).\r\n\r\n       In articulating the precise right that section 23-3-540(C) infringes, Dykes\r\nframes it as the right \"to be let alone.\" However, in determining whether the right\r\nat stake is fundamental, we must first make \"a 'careful description' of the asserted\r\nliberty right or interest [to] avoid[] overgeneralization in the historical inquiry.\"\r\nHawkins, 195 F.3d at 747.             I profoundly disagree with the majority's\r\ncharacterization of the right at issue as the right of \"a convicted sex offender\" to be\r\n\"let alone.\" Formulating the right by couching it in terms of a specific class of\r\npersons fails to appreciate the extent of the right at stake and instead focuses on the\r\nthe State's asserted justification for infringing upon that right. The Constitution\r\ndoes not recognize separate rights for different classes of citizens and instead\r\nguarantees rights to all American citizens. Furthermore, determining whether a\r\nlaw violates an individual's substantive due process rights is a two-pronged\r\nanalysis that first requires a determination as to whether a fundamental right has\r\nbeen implicated, and if so, whether the State has a compelling interest to justify the\r\ninfringement. Injecting the State's interest—here, Dykes' status as a convicted sex\r\noffender—into the articulation of the right at stake conflates the analysis and\r\ndooms from the outset any possibility of finding the alleged right fundamental.\r\nWhile a person's status as a sex offender may affect whether the State can infringe\r\nupon her fundamental rights in certain ways, that factor should be considered in the\r\nsecond part of the analysis. Therefore, when viewed in light of the facts of this\r\ncase and the authorities relied upon by Dykes, I believe the narrow right on which\r\nshe relies is the right to be free from the permanent, continuous tracking of her\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\n       Although Dykes has overstated the exact right on which she relies,\r\ntraditional notions of liberty and the right to be let alone are instructive for they\r\nprovide the context within which the Court must analyze Dykes' specific right. Sir\r\nWilliam Blackstone, in his landmark Commentaries on the Laws of England, noted\r\nthe government's right to restrict an individual's free will is not immutable and any\r\ngreater restriction than necessary threatens liberty in general:\r\n\r\n      [W]e may collect that the law, which restrains a man from doing\r\n      mischief to his fellow citizens, though it diminishes the natural,\r\n\n      increases the civil liberty of mankind: but every wanton and causeless\r\n      restraint on the will of the subject, whether practiced by a monarch, a\r\n      nobility, or a popular assembly, is a degree of tyranny.\r\n\r\n1 William Blackstone, Commentaries *121–22. Blackstone's commentary reflects\r\nour substantive due process milieu, where the core rights of freedom and liberty\r\ncan only be limited when sufficiently necessary to advance the public good.\r\n\r\n       Furthermore, various members of the Supreme Court have voiced their\r\nviews that the government has an acutely constrained power to infringe on one's\r\nliberty. Louis Brandeis, before he was appointed to the Supreme Court, wrote,\r\n\r\n      [T]here came a recognition of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings\r\n      and his intellect. Gradually the scope of these legal rights broadened;\r\n      and now the right to life has come to mean the right to enjoy life, —\r\n      the right to be let alone; the right to liberty secures the exercise of\r\n      extensive civil privileges . . . .\r\n\r\nSamuel D. Warren & Louis D. Brandeis, The Right to Privacy, 4 Harv. L. Rev.\r\n193, 193 (1890). After joining the Supreme Court, Justice Brandeis noted the\r\nFounding Fathers\r\n\r\n      recognized the significance of man's spiritual nature, of his feelings\r\n      and of his intellect. They knew that only a part of the pain, pleasure\r\n      and satisfactions of life are to be found in material things. They\r\n      sought to protect Americans in their beliefs, their thoughts, their\r\n      emotions and their sensations. They conferred, as against the\r\n      government, the right to be let alone—the most comprehensive of\r\n      rights and the right most valued by civilized men.\r\n\r\nOlmstead v. United States, 277 U.S. 438, 478 (1928) (Brandeis, J., dissenting),\r\noverruled in part by Berger v. New York, 388 U.S. 41 (1967) and Katz v. United\r\nStates, 389 U.S. 347 (1967). Additionally, in an oft-quoted dissent in Poe v.\r\nUllman, 367 U.S. 497 (1961), Justice Harlan wrote,\r\n\r\n      [T]he full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause\r\n      cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific\r\n      guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution. This 'liberty' is not\r\n      a series of isolated points pricked out in terms of the taking of\r\n      property; the freedom of speech, press, and religion; the right to keep\r\n\n      and bear arms; the freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures;\r\n      and so on. It is a rational continuum which, broadly speaking,\r\n      includes a freedom from all substantial arbitrary impositions and\r\n      purposeless restraints.\r\n\r\nId. at 543 (Harlan, J., dissenting).11 As the Supreme Court later noted, these words\r\n\"eloquently\" describe our role in the substantive due process inquiry. Moore, 431\r\nU.S. at 501.\r\n\r\n       In Glucksberg, however, the Supreme Court admonished overreliance on\r\nthese expansive concepts of freedom in the due process analysis. Although the\r\nSupreme Court has, in the past, relied on Justice Harlan's dissent in Poe in its\r\nfundamental rights analysis, at no point has the Court jettisoned its \"established\r\napproach\" of searching for concrete examples of the claimed right in the Court's\r\njurisprudence. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 721–22 & n.17. While satellite monitoring\r\nitself may not have an analogous precursor in the Court's jurisprudence, in the\r\nabsence of a history to rely on in similar circumstances, the Court has resorted to\r\nexamining more traditional notions of liberty. Cf. Griswold, 381 U.S. at 482–86\r\n(detailing general concepts of privacy under the Constitution and concluding that\r\nproscribing the use of contraception \"is repulsive to the notions of privacy\r\nsurrounding the marriage relationship\"). In my opinion, the right at stake—\r\npreventing a government's ubiquitous eye from following an individual's every\r\nmovement throughout her life—rests easily within our established conception of\r\nliberty. As Justice Kennedy has noted,\r\n\r\n      Liberty protects the person from unwarranted government intrusions\r\n      into a dwelling or other private places. In our tradition the State is not\r\n      omnipresent in the home. And there are other spheres of our lives and\r\n      existence, outside the home, where the State should not be a dominant\r\n      presence. Freedom extends beyond spatial bounds.\r\n\r\nLawrence v. Texas, 539 U.S. 558, 562 (2003). A basic tenet of liberty is that there\r\nare places and aspects of our lives in which the State may not invade without clear\r\njustification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The majority in Poe did not reach the substantive issue involved because it found\r\n11\r\n\r\n\r\nthe case to be nonjusticiable. Poe, 367 U.S. at 507–09.\r\n\n        Recognizing the growing threat of technological advances on individual\r\nliberty, Justice Douglas warned almost fifty years ago that \"[t]he dangers posed by\r\nwiretapping and electronic surveillance strike at the very heart of the democratic\r\nphilosophy.\" Osborn v. United States, 385 U.S. 323, 352 (1966) (Douglas, J.,\r\ndissenting). Even then, the scope of the government's ability to enter an\r\nindividual's private life was troubling, and it has only increased with the advent of\r\nGPS monitoring. I therefore believe an examination of the general impact of the\r\nsatellite monitoring scheme is helpful in understanding how the articulated right is\r\nhere infringed and the extent to which Dykes' liberty is impacted. Recently, the\r\nSupreme Court had the opportunity to consider a similar issue in United States v.\r\nJones, 132 S. Ct. 945 (2012), albeit in a different context. At issue in Jones was\r\nwhether the government's surreptitious placement of a GPS tracking device on\r\nJones's car without a warrant was an unreasonable search in violation of the Fourth\r\nAmendment to the United States Constitution. Id. at 947. The majority held it was\r\nbecause the attachment of the monitor to the car was a physical trespass on\r\npersonal property for the purpose of obtaining information. Id. at 949.\r\n\r\n       In his concurring opinion, Justice Alito tackled the thornier question of\r\nwhether this satellite monitoring violated an individual's reasonable expectation of\r\nprivacy. Justice Alito observed that recent technological advancements have\r\nplaced vast swaths of information in the public realm, a development which \"will\r\ncontinue to shape the average person's expectations about the privacy of his or her\r\ndaily movements.\"12 Id. at 963 (Alito, J., concurring). With that in mind, he\r\nconcluded monitoring one's movements on a public street for a relatively short\r\nperiod of time would not violate an individual's reasonable expectations of privacy.\r\nId. at 964 (citing United States v. Knotts, 460 U.S. 276, 281–82 (1983)). When\r\nthat monitoring becomes long-term, however, the nature of the invasion changes:\r\n\r\n      But the use of longer term GPS monitoring in investigations of most\r\n      offenses impinges on expectations of privacy. For such offenses,\r\n      society's expectation has been that law enforcement agents and others\r\n\r\n\r\n  In Jones, the monitor placed on the underside of Jones's car constantly tracked\r\n12\r\n\r\n\r\nthe car's movements over a four-week period without his knowledge. 132 S. Ct. at\r\n947. The majority's contention to the contrary, Justice Alito noted there is no\r\neighteenth century analogue to this type of investigation, because that \"would have\r\nrequired either a gigantic coach, a very tiny constable, or both—not to mention a\r\nconstable with incredible fortitude and patience.\" Id. at 958 (Alito, J., concurring).\r\n\n      would not—and indeed, in the main, simply could not—secretly\r\n      monitor and catalogue every single movement of an individual's car\r\n      for a very long period.\r\n\r\nId. Applying this principle to the four-week monitoring at issue in Jones, Justice\r\nAlito concluded, \"We need not identify with precision the point at which the\r\ntracking of th[e] vehicle became a search, for the line was surely crossed before the\r\n4-week mark.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Justice Sotomayor similarly noted we live in an age so inundated with\r\ntechnology that we may unwittingly \"reveal a great deal of information about\r\n[our]selves to third parties in the course of carrying out mundane tasks.\" Id. at 957\r\n(Sotomayor, J., concurring). In that vein, she agreed with Justice Alito's concerns\r\nabout the intrusiveness of satellite monitoring: \"GPS monitoring generates a\r\nprecise, comprehensive record of a person's public movements that reflects a\r\nwealth of detail about her familial, political, professional, religious, and sexual\r\nassociations.\"13 Id. at 955. Thus, satellite monitoring invites the State into the\r\nsubject's world twenty-four hours per day, seven days per week, and it provides the\r\nState with a precise view of her intimate habits, whether she is in public or not. If\r\nwe are not careful about and cognizant of this fact, \"the Government's unrestrained\r\npower to assemble data that reveal private aspects of identity is susceptible to\r\nabuse\" and \"may 'alter the relationship between citizen and government in a way\r\nthat is inimical to democratic society.'\" Id. at 956 (quoting United States v.\r\nCuevas-Perez, 640 F.3d 272, 285 (7th Cir. 2011) (Flaum, J., concurring)).\r\n\r\n      Although decided under the rubric of the Fourth Amendment, Jones is\r\nnevertheless instructive here. As Justice Alito and Justice Sotomayor incisively\r\nobserved, the very concept of what we as citizens view as private is called into\r\nquestion by technology which facilitates unprecedented oversight of our lives.\r\nMore importantly, at issue in this case is not just the tracking of individuals for a\r\nperiod of time while they are being investigated for a specific crime—as with a\r\nFourth Amendment search—but the statutorily mandated monitoring of certain\r\n13 Justice Alito's concurrence was joined by three other members of the Court,\r\nJustice Ginsburg, Justice Breyer, and Justice Kagan. After noting she shared the\r\nsame concerns as Justice Alito, Justice Sotomayor wrote that \"[r]esolution of these\r\ndifficult questions . . . is unnecessary\" at this time because the majority's trespass\r\ntheory was dispositive of the case. Jones, 132 S. Ct. at 957 (Sotomayor, J.,\r\nconcurring).\r\n\nindividuals for as long as they live with no ability to have it removed. See\r\nOsborne, 385 U.S. at 343 (Douglas, J., dissenting) (\"These examples . . .\r\ndemonstrate an alarming trend whereby the privacy and dignity of our citizens is\r\nbeing whittled away by sometimes imperceptible steps. Taken individually, each\r\nstep may be of little consequence. But when viewed as a whole, there begins to\r\nemerge a society quite unlike any we have seen—a society in which government\r\nmay intrude into the secret regions of man's life at will.\"); United States v. Pineda-\r\nMoreno, 617 F.3d 1120, 1124 (9th Cir. 2010) (Kozinski, J., dissenting from the\r\ndenial of rehearing en banc) (\"By holding that this kind of surveillance doesn't\r\nimpair an individual's reasonable expectation of privacy, the panel hands the\r\ngovernment the power to track the movements of every one of us, every day of our\r\nlives.\").\r\n\r\n       I therefore conclude that the right of an individual to be free from the\r\ngovernment's permanent, continuous tracking of her movements is easily\r\nencompassed by the larger protection of liberty and personal privacy accorded by\r\nthe Constitution. As our history of protestations on government intrusion from\r\nBlackstone to Jones illustrates, our Constitution was designed to guarantee a\r\ncertain freedom from government interference in the day-to-day order of our lives\r\nwhich lies at the heart of a free society. Accordingly, I believe neither liberty nor\r\njustice would exist if the government could, without sufficient justification,\r\nconstantly monitor the precise location of an individual twenty-four hours a day\r\nuntil she dies. In my opinion, safeguarding against this Orwellian nightmare14 falls\r\nsquarely within the ambit of fundamental precepts embraced by the drafters of the\r\nConstitution. I would therefore hold that Dykes has a fundamental right to be free\r\nfrom the permanent, continuous tracking of her movements which the State may\r\nonly infringe upon where it demonstrates the statute at issue is narrowly tailored to\r\nserve a compelling interest.\r\n\r\n14\r\n George Orwell's novel 1984 increasingly appears less of a dystopian fantasy and\r\nmore a cautionary tale:\r\n\r\n      There was of course no way of knowing whether you were being\r\n      watched at any given moment. How often, or on what system, the\r\n      Thought Police plugged in on any individual wire was guesswork. It\r\n      was even conceivable that they watched everybody all the time.\r\n\r\nGeorge Orwell, 1984 6 (1949).\r\n\n       Before progressing to the second portion of the analysis, I question whether\r\nthe majority's holding that the statute implicates \"a protected liberty interest\" is\r\nmeaningfully different from my conclusion that it implicates a fundamental right or\r\nwhether it is just an exercise in semantics. The issue is whether the interest/right is\r\nfundamental and in my opinion, a general liberty interest in being free from\r\npermanent, unwarranted government interference is \"deeply rooted in this Nation's\r\nhistory and tradition, and implicit in the concept of ordered liberty, such that\r\nneither liberty nor justice would exist if they were sacrificed.\" Glucksberg, 521\r\nU.S. at 721. Unpalatable though it may be to recognize that persons guilty of sex\r\ncrimes against children have fundamental rights, the Constitution was not designed\r\nto protect only the rights of people we like. See Communist Party of U.S. v.\r\nSubversive Activities Control Bd., 367 U.S. 1, 190 (1961) (Douglas, J., dissenting)\r\n(\"Our Constitution protects all minorities, no matter how despised they are.\").\r\nConstant, unjustified government intrusions in the lives of an individual are the\r\ntypes of tyrannical acts the Founding Fathers sought to protect against when\r\nestablishing our nation. I therefore believe even under the majority's iteration of\r\nthe interest at stake, that interest is fundamental and the statute must be evaluated\r\nunder a strict scrutiny analysis.15 Flores, 507 U.S. at 302 (1993) (holding that\r\nsubstantive due process \"forbids the government to infringe certain 'fundamental'\r\nliberty interests at all, no matter what process is provided, unless the infringement\r\nis narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest\"); Luckabaugh, 351 S.C. at\r\n140, 568 S.E.2d at 347 (2002) (acknowledging that the constitutionality of a statute\r\nwhich implicated the defendant's \"liberty interest from bodily restraint\" should be\r\nanalyzed under strict scrutiny).\r\n\r\n       Accordingly, I proceed to the consideration of whether section 23-3-540(C)\r\nis narrowly tailored to serve a compelling state interest—thus surviving strict\r\nscrutiny—and conclude it is not. One cannot \"minimize the importance and\r\nfundamental nature of [an individual's liberty interest]. But, as our cases hold, this\r\nright may, in circumstances where the government's interest is sufficiently\r\n\r\n15 I note as well my disagreement with the majority's assertion that merely because\r\nit is civil in nature, rather than criminal, the statute does not implicate a\r\nfundamental right. Whether a statute is characterized as civil or criminal is\r\nimmaterial to this analysis and certainly not dispositive. See Luckabaugh, 351 S.C.\r\nat 135–140, 568 S.E.2d at 344–347 (recognizing that although the Sexually Violent\r\nPredator Act is civil and non-punitive in nature, it nevertheless infringes the\r\n\"fundamental right to liberty, free from bodily restraint\").\r\n\nweighty, be subordinated to the greater needs of society.\" United States v. Salerno,\r\n481 U.S. 739, 750–51 (1987). Dykes concedes that protecting the public from sex\r\noffenders who pose a high risk of reoffending is a compelling state interest;\r\nnevertheless, she steadfastly maintains, and I agree, that protecting the public from\r\nthose who have a low risk of reoffending is not.\r\n\r\n       It is beyond question that \"[s]ex offenders are a serious threat in this\r\nNation.\" McKune v. Lile, 536 U.S. 24, 32 (2002). In fact, \"the victims of sexual\r\nassault are most often juveniles,\" and \"[w]hen convicted sex offenders reenter\r\nsociety, they are much more likely than any other type of offender to be rearrested\r\nfor a new rape or sexual assault.\" Id. at 32–33. Thus, the General Assembly noted\r\n\"[s]tatistics show that sex offenders often pose a high risk of re-offending,\" S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 23-3-400 (2007), prompting it to enact provisions \"to protect the\r\npublic from those sex offenders who may re-offend,\" State v. Walls, 348 S.C. 26,\r\n31, 558 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2002). Accordingly, I recognize Dykes' status as a\r\nconvicted sex offender is relevant to the analysis. However, any infringement\r\nwhich is substantially justified by the possibility that an individual may reoffend—\r\nwithout any actual consideration of her likelihood to reoffend—belies a conclusion\r\nthat the statute is narrowly tailored. Monitoring sex offenders who pose a low risk\r\nof reoffending for the rest of their lives is not \"sufficiently weighty\" such that the\r\nsubject's liberty interest in being free from government monitoring must be\r\n\"subordinated to the greater needs of society.\" Salerno, 481 U.S. at 750–51.\r\n\r\n       I therefore find that requiring Dykes to submit to satellite monitoring for the\r\nrest of her life without an assessment of her risk of reoffending violates her\r\nsubstantive due process rights. To paraphrase Blackstone, section 23-3-540(C)'s\r\napplication to Dykes has the potential to decrease her natural liberty without any\r\nattendant increase in overall civil liberty. Accordingly, I would hold that\r\nsubsection (C) of 23-3-540 is unconstitutional and must be stricken from the\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEATTY, J., concurs.\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27288","title":"Centex International v.

(Appellant) filed\r\nconsolidated income tax returns for its three corporate affiliates that wholly owned\r\nthe general partnership of Centex Homes, a developer of residential communities.\r\nAppellant appeals the Administrative Law Court's (ALC's) order upholding the\r\nSouth Carolina Department of Revenue's (the Department's) denial of its claim for\r\ninfrastructure tax credits for the 2002-2005 income tax years. Appellant contends\r\nthe ALC erred in: (1) concluding the corporate affiliates of Appellant were not\r\neligible to claim the infrastructure tax credit as partners of Centex Homes; (2) its\r\n\ninterpretation and application of the aggregate and entity theories of partnership\r\ntaxation; and (3) concluding that Appellant and its affiliates are not a single\r\ntaxpayer that may claim the infrastructure tax credit on its consolidated tax return.\r\nThis Court certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b),\r\nSCACR. We affirm.         I. Factual/Procedural History\r\n\r\n       The underlying facts of the instant case are not in dispute. Centex Homes is\r\na general partnership that operates in South Carolina and is wholly owned by\r\nAppellant's three corporate affiliates. Centex Homes acquires and develops land\r\nfor the purpose of establishing communities and constructing single-family homes\r\nin South Carolina and other states. As a result of constructing developments\r\nwithin this state, Centex Homes incurred infrastructure project expenses of\r\napproximately $68,000,000.\r\n\r\n       In 2007, Appellant filed amended corporate income tax returns for tax years\r\n2002 to 2005, which included amended partnership returns for Centex Homes. In\r\nthese returns, Appellant claimed tax credits in the amount of $5,113,040 based\r\nupon the expenses incurred by Centex Homes for the development of roads and\r\nwater and sewer lines. Appellant sought these credits pursuant to section 12-6-\r\n3420 of the South Carolina Code, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      (A) A corporation may claim a credit for the construction or\r\n      improvement of an infrastructure project against taxes due under\r\n      Section 12-6-530 for:\r\n\r\n             (1) expenses paid or accrued by the taxpayer;\r\n\r\n             (2) contributions made to a governmental entity; or\r\n\r\n             (3) contributions made to a qualified private entity in the case\r\n             of water or sewer lines and their related facilities in areas\r\n             served by a private water and sewer company.\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420(A) (2000) (emphasis added) (the \"Infrastructure\r\nCredit Statute\").1\r\n\r\n1 We cite to the code section in effect at the time of the designated tax years as it\r\nwas amended in 2006. Act No. 335, 2006 S.C. Acts 2684. This amendment did\r\nnot effectuate any substantive changes.\r\n\n       The Department conducted a Field Audit of Appellant for the South Carolina\r\ncorporate income tax periods ending March 2002 through March 2005. The\r\nDepartment's audit, which was dated July 25, 2007, determined Appellant: (1)\r\nincorrectly calculated its South Carolina corporate income by failing to apportion\r\nthe amounts of revenue from the out-of-state intangibles generated from activity in\r\nSouth Carolina; and (2) was not entitled to the claimed infrastructure tax credits as\r\nthe credits were earned by the partnership, Centex Homes, rather than the\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\n       On October 23, 2007, Appellant filed a written protest in response to the\r\nDepartment's audit and notice of proposed assessment. On December 4, 2009, the\r\nDepartment issued Appellant its final Determination in which it confirmed the\r\nField Audit and set forth the legal basis for its adjustments and denial of the claim\r\nfor credits. Specifically, the Department denied Appellant's claim for the\r\ninfrastructure tax credits because \"Centex Homes was not eligible for the corporate\r\ntax credit as a general partnership and therefore could not pass through the credit to\r\nits individual corporate partners.\"\r\n\r\n       Upon receipt of the Determination, Appellant requested a contested case\r\nhearing before the ALC to dispute the Department's determination. The\r\nDepartment filed a Motion for Partial Summary Judgment on the infrastructure tax\r\ncredit issue. In response, Appellant filed a Cross-Motion for Summary Judgment\r\non the same issue. Both parties stipulated that no issue of fact remained on the\r\ninfrastructure tax credit issue.\r\n\r\n        Following a hearing, the ALC granted the Department's motion and denied\r\nAppellant's cross-motion by order dated June 2, 2011. In so ruling, the ALC\r\ninitially determined the Infrastructure Credit Statute mandated that a corporation\r\ndirectly incur the expenses that generate the claimed tax credit. The ALC reasoned\r\nthat section 12-6-3420, when read in its entirety, limited \"the taxpayer\" in\r\nsubsection (A)(1) to the \"corporation\" attempting to claim the credit under\r\nsubsection (A). Because the infrastructure expenses were directly incurred by\r\nCentex Homes, a general partnership, the ALC concluded Appellant could not\r\nclaim the credit \"based upon its indirect involvement in the partnership's business\r\nactivity.\" Additionally, the ALC found this conclusion was consistent with the\r\nDepartment's long-standing policy that \"a credit must be used by the taxpayer that\r\nearns it.\"\r\n\n        Despite this conclusion, the ALC acknowledged a statutory exception that\r\n\"would allow an avenue for indirect expenditures to create access to tax credits.\"\r\nSpecifically, section 12-6-3310(B)(1) outlines a \"pass-through\" provision, which\r\nstates:\r\n\r\n      Unless specifically prohibited, an \"S\" corporation, limited liability\r\n      company taxed as a partnership, or partnership that qualifies for a\r\n      credit pursuant to this article may pass through the credit earned\r\n      to each shareholder of the \"S\" corporation, member of the limited\r\n      liability company, or partner of the partnership.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3310(B)(1) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added) (the \"Pass-\r\nThrough Statute\").2 The ALC interpreted this code section to mean that \"a tax\r\ncredit may only be passed through to individual partners after the partnership itself\r\nqualifies for the tax credit.\" Because the ALC found the infrastructure tax credit\r\nwas limited solely to corporations, the court concluded that a partnership cannot\r\nqualify to claim the credit. The ALC explained that, \"[i]n order for the flow\r\nthrough provisions to remain consistent with the corporate limitations of § 12-6-\r\n3420, the word 'claim' must be interpreted as synonymous with 'generate.' \" Thus,\r\nthe ALC concluded that \"because the partnership was not qualified to claim the tax\r\ncredit in the first place, none of its corporate partners may do so under § 12-6-\r\n3310(B)(1).\"\r\n\r\n        In reaching this ultimate conclusion, the ALC rejected Appellant's\r\ncontentions that: (1) provisions for partnerships in the Internal Revenue Code,\r\nwhich have been adopted by South Carolina,3 dictate that the tax credit be treated\r\nas if the individual corporate partners generated the credits directly under a\r\nmodified \"aggregate theory\"; and (2) disallowance of the infrastructure credits\r\nwould be inequitable as the corporate partners \"spent over 68 million dollars on\r\ninfrastructure and have to pay corporate income taxes on their distributive share\r\nfrom the partnership.\"\r\n\r\n2 We cite to the 2010 supplement as that is the date cited in the ALC's order.\r\nHowever, we would note that subsection (B)(1) became effective on June 18, 2003.\r\nAct No. 69, 2003 S.C. Acts 733. Section 12-6-3310 was subsequently amended on\r\nJune 12, 2008 to provide for tax credits claimed by a limited liability company.\r\nAct No. 352, 2008 S.C. Acts 3460.\r\n3 See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 12-6-40, -50, -600 (Supp. 2010) (adopting select\r\nprovisions of the Internal Revenue Code).\r\n\n        Subsequently, Appellant filed a timely motion for reconsideration pursuant\r\nto Rule 59, SCRCP. After hearing arguments from the parties, the ALC denied\r\nAppellant's motion for reconsideration and specifically confirmed each of the prior\r\nrulings. Additionally, the ALC rejected Appellant's contention that it was entitled\r\nto claim the infrastructure credit because it filed a consolidated return and, thus, all\r\nof its affiliates constituted a single taxpayer for purposes of the credit. The ALC\r\nreasoned that, \"[i]n order for a consolidated group to claim the credit on a\r\nconsolidated basis, § 12-6-3420 requires that at least one corporation of the group\r\nmust first be entitled to the credit.\" Although the ALC acknowledged that a credit\r\ncan be applied on a consolidated basis, it found the corporate partners in the instant\r\ncase were never entitled to the credit in the first place.\r\n\r\n       Appellant filed a timely appeal with the Court of Appeals. This Court\r\ncertified the appeal pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\n\r\n                               II. Standard of Review\r\n\r\n       Because the parties presented this tax case in the posture of a motion for\r\nsummary judgment, it is governed by Rule 56(c) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\nCivil Procedure. This rule provides a motion for summary judgment shall be\r\ngranted \"if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions\r\non file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to\r\nany material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\nlaw.\" Rule 56(c), SCRCP.\r\n\r\n       \"Tax appeals to the ALC are subject to the Administrative Procedures Act\r\n(APA).\" CFRE, L.L.C. v. Greenville County Assessor, 395 S.C. 67, 73, 716 S.E.2d\r\n877, 880 (2011). \"The decision of the Administrative Law Court should not be\r\noverturned unless it is unsupported by substantial evidence or controlled by some\r\nerror of law.\" Original Blue Ribbon Taxi Corp. v.

Dep't of Revenue, 388 S.C. 138, 144, 694 S.E.2d 525, 528\r\n(2010) (\"A reviewing court may reverse the decision of the ALC where it is in\r\nviolation of a statutory provision or it is affected by an error of law.\" (citing S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 1-23-610(B)(a), (d) (Supp. 2009)). However, \"[q]uestions of\r\nstatutory interpretation are questions of law, which we are free to decide without\r\nany deference to the court below.\" CFRE, 395 S.C. at 74, 716 S.E.2d at 881.\r\n\n        \"The cardinal rule of statutory interpretation is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintention of the legislature.\" Sloan v. Hardee, 371 S.C. 495, 498, 640 S.E.2d 457,\r\n459 (2007). \"When a statute's terms are clear and unambiguous on their face, there\r\nis no room for statutory construction and a court must apply the statute according\r\nto its literal meaning.\" Id.

See CFRE, 395 S.C. at 74, 716 S.E.2d at 881\r\n(\"[I]nterlaced with these standard canons of statutory construction is our policy of\r\nstrictly construing tax exemption statutes against the taxpayer.\"); SCANA Corp. v.\r\nS.C.

Discussion\r\n\r\nA.    Arguments\r\n\r\n      Initially, we note that Appellant does not assert the Department unjustly\r\ndeprived it of a $68,000,000 expense against its income for infrastructure costs.\r\nInstead, Appellant contends it was denied additional tax credits in the amount of\r\n$5,000,000. In support of this contention, Appellant posits four primary theories\r\nupon which it can claim the credit.\r\n\n       First, because a partnership is included in the statutory definition of\r\n\"taxpayer,\" the infrastructure expenses paid by Centex Homes satisfied the\r\nprovision of the Infrastructure Credit Statute that requires \"expenses paid or\r\naccrued by the taxpayer.\" Second, Centex Homes \"earned the credit by paying the\r\nqualifying expenditures\" and, thus, constituted a \"partnership that qualifies for a\r\ncredit\" under the Pass-Through Statute. Third, Appellant's corporate partners\r\ndirectly earned the credit as any expenses made by Centex Homes were not strictly\r\nthose of the partnership but, rather, were attributed to each corporate partner in\r\naccordance with their ownership interest. Finally, the consolidated tax return filed\r\nby Appellant necessarily included the income and deductions related to the\r\nqualifying infrastructure expenses incurred by the \"consolidated group\" of\r\ncorporate partners as they constituted a \"single taxpayer.\"\r\n\r\nB.    Analysis\r\n\r\n      (1) \"A Taxpayer\" versus \"The Taxpayer\" under the Infrastructure\r\n         Credit Statute\r\n\r\n       Because the term \"taxpayer\" is statutorily defined to include partnerships,\r\nAppellant asserts the plain language of the Infrastructure Credit Statute allows\r\nAppellant to claim the tax credit as Centex Homes constitutes a \"taxpayer\" and,\r\nthus, satisfied the requirement of subsection (A)(1) that \"expenses [were] paid or\r\naccrued by the taxpayer.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420(A)(1). Simply stated,\r\nAppellant maintains Centex Homes was statutorily authorized to earn the credit. In\r\nturn, Appellant could claim the credit via its corporate affiliates.\r\n\r\n       In its argument, Appellant directs the Court's attention to other sections of\r\nthe Infrastructure Credit Statute to establish that the credit is not strictly limited to\r\ncorporations. Instead, Appellant asserts the legislature used the word \"corporation\"\r\nin the Infrastructure Credit Statute to identify only the entity that may claim the\r\ncredit. According to Appellant, the use of the term \"corporation\" did not limit the\r\ntype of entity that can generate or earn the credit as other entities, such as electric\r\ncooperatives, also qualify for the credit.\r\n\r\n     We find the ALC properly analyzed and rejected each of Appellant's\r\narguments. Although Appellant is correct that the term \"taxpayer\" is statutorily\r\n\ndefined to include partnerships,4 Appellant uses a forced construction to achieve its\r\ndesired result.\r\n\r\n        As evident from the plain terms of the statute, the legislature used the phrase\r\n\"the taxpayer\" rather than \"a taxpayer.\" By using the word \"the\", the legislature\r\nprecluded partnerships from earning the infrastructure credit as it relates back to \"a\r\ncorporation.\" See People v. Enlow, 310 P.2d 539, 546 (Colo. 1957) (\"The word\r\n'the' is a word of limitation—a 'word used before nouns, with a specifying or\r\nparticularizing effect, opposed to the indefinite or generalizing force of 'a' or 'an.'\").\r\nMoreover, the credit is to be applied to corporate income taxes as the legislature\r\nspecifically referenced S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-530, which imposes state income\r\ntaxes on corporations doing business in this state. Thus, the entity earning the\r\ncredit is limited to the claiming corporation.\r\n\r\n       This limitation was purposeful as it is consistent with the general rule that\r\ntax credits should be claimed by the entity that earns or generates the credit. See\r\nBerks County Tax Collection Comm. v. Penn. Dep't of Cmty. & Econ. Dev., 60\r\nA.3d 589, 592 (Pa. Commonw. Ct. 2013) (\"A tax credit is commonly accepted to\r\nmean a direct reduction against the liability for tax owed. As defined in Black's\r\nLaw Dictionary 1310 (5th ed. 1979), a tax credit is a '(t)ype of offset in which the\r\ntaxpayer is allowed a deduction from his tax for other taxes paid.' \" (citations\r\nomitted)). Furthermore, if we were to take Appellant's argument to its logical\r\nextreme, an individual (which is included in the statutory definition of \"taxpayer\")\r\ncould generate the credit for a corporation. Thus, when read in the context of the\r\nInfrastructure Credit Statute, we conclude the phrase \"the taxpayer\" specifically\r\nrefers to \"a corporation\" attempting to claim the credit in subsection (A).\r\n\r\n       Finally, we find the other code sections cited by Appellant do not support its\r\nposition. Reading section 12-6-3420 in its entirety, and not just the isolated\r\nsections identified by Appellant, reveals the legislature's intent that a corporation\r\nmust be the entity that incurs the expenses to generate the tax credit. Significantly,\r\nsubsections (G), (H), and (I) specifically identify a \"corporation\" as the entity that\r\nmay claim the credit. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420(G), (H), (I) (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n4 Pursuant to the South Carolina Income Tax Act, \"unless otherwise required by\r\nthe context,\" the term \"taxpayer\" includes \"an individual, trust, estate,\r\npartnership, association, company, corporation, or any other entity subject to\r\nthe tax imposed by this chapter or required to file a return.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 12-\r\n6-30(1) (2000) (emphasis added).\r\n\n       Furthermore, Appellant's reliance on the legislature's inclusion of a\r\n\"qualifying private entity\" in subsection (F) of the Infrastructure Credit Statute is\r\nnot dispositive. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420(F) (2000). Essentially, Appellant\r\ncontends this section authorizes an electric cooperative, as a \"qualified private\r\nentity,\" to claim the infrastructure credit. In support of this contention, Appellant\r\nreferences section 12-20-105,5 a section that provides a tax credit for entities that\r\npay license taxes under section 12-20-100.6 Because electric cooperatives are not\r\n\"incorporated in the same manner as traditional corporations,\" Appellant\r\ninferentially argues that a non-corporate entity may claim the infrastructure tax\r\ncredit; thus, the credit is not limited to corporations.7\r\n\r\n        Appellant's attempt to expand the scope of the Infrastructure Credit Statute\r\nis unavailing. Subsections (A)(3) and (C)(1)(c) outline the fact that water and\r\nsewer lines deeded to a \"qualified private entity,\" which maintain the\r\ninfrastructure, are acceptable projects and eligible for the tax credit. S.C. Code\r\nAnn. § 12-6-3420(A)(3), (C)(1)(c) (2000). Neither of these sections includes\r\nqualified private non-corporate entities as possible claimants. Additionally,\r\nsubsection (C)(2), which defines a \"qualified private entity\" as properly licensed\r\nutilities to which such a project is needed, makes no mention of an electric\r\ncooperative. Id. § 12-6-3420(C)(2). Accordingly, we find the legislature intended\r\nonly for a corporate utility company to qualify for the credit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n5 Section 12-20-105 provides tax credits for companies subject to a license tax\r\nunder section 12-20-100 against its license tax liability for amounts paid in cash to\r\nprovide infrastructure for an eligible project. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-20-105 (2000 &\r\nSupp. 2012). This section includes electric cooperatives and cross-references the\r\nInfrastructure Credit Statute to preclude a company from claiming a credit under\r\nboth statutes. Id. § 12-20-105(G).\r\n6 Section 12-20-100 provides for license tax on utility companies and electric\r\ncooperatives. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-20-100 (2000).\r\n7 Appellant's argument appears to be based on the \"Cross-Reference\" in section\r\n12-6-3420, which states, \"Utilities companies and electric cooperatives claiming\r\ncredit under this section ineligible to claim credit against license tax liability, see §\r\n12-20-105.\" S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420.\r\n\n      (2) \"Partnership that Qualifies for a Credit\" under the Pass-Through\r\n         Statute\r\n\r\n     Alternatively, Appellant asserts it may claim the credit pursuant to the Pass-\r\nThrough Statute, which states:\r\n\r\n      Unless specifically prohibited, an \"S\" corporation, limited liability\r\n      company taxed as a partnership, or partnership that qualifies for a\r\n      credit pursuant to this article may pass through the credit earned\r\n      to each shareholder of the \"S\" corporation, member of the limited\r\n      liability company, or partner of the partnership.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3310(B)(1) (Supp. 2010) (emphasis added). Because\r\nCentex Homes \"made qualified expenditures and contributed to the resulting\r\ninfrastructure projects to local municipalities on behalf of its corporate partners and\r\ntherefore earned the credit,\" Appellant asserts it is \"eligible to claim the credit.\"\r\nAppellant further argues there is no statutory provision that \"specifically prohibits\"\r\nthe pass through of the tax credit from a partnership to the corporate taxpayer.\r\nAdditionally, Appellant notes that a 2008 amendment to the Pass-Through Statute\r\nprovides that limited liability companies, which are taxed as partnerships, are\r\nentitled to all credits applicable to corporations. Thus, by implication, the\r\nlegislature intended for partnerships to qualify for a corporate tax credit.\r\n\r\n       Strictly construing the Pass-Through Statute, we find that Centex Homes\r\ndoes not qualify for the credit. Although not defined in the statute, the word\r\n\"qualified\" connotes that the entity is \"entitled\" or \"eligible,\" i.e., possessing the\r\nproperties or characteristics necessary or complied with specific requirements or\r\nprecedent conditions to become eligible or entitled. Black's Law Dictionary 1116-\r\n17 (5th ed. 1979); Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary 936 (8th ed. 1981).\r\nAs previously discussed, the infrastructure credit may be claimed only by a\r\ncorporation; thus, a partnership can never qualify for the infrastructure credit.\r\nSuch an express limitation constitutes a specific prohibition against a pass through\r\nfrom a partnership to a corporation. Moreover, unlike several other tax credits,8\r\nthe Infrastructure Credit Statute does not contain language incorporating the pass-\r\nthrough provisions of section 12-6-3310.\r\n\r\n\r\n8 See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3340 (2000) (Renewable Energy Credit); id. §\r\n12-6-3370 (Water Control Structure Credit); S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3560 (Supp.\r\n2010) (Motion Picture and Advertisement Company Credit).\r\n\n       Furthermore, Appellant's reference to the 2008 amendment does not affect\r\nthis conclusion. With an effective date of June 12, 2008, the legislature amended\r\nsection 12-6-3310 to add subsection (C) in order \"to provide for the application of\r\ntax credits when earned by certain limited liability companies.\" Act No. 352, 2008\r\nS.C. Acts 3458. Thus, the amended version of section 12-6-3310 expressly\r\nauthorizes limited liability companies, which are taxed for South Carolina income\r\ntax purposes as partnerships and corporations, to earn and pass through allowable\r\ncredits. S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3310(C) (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n       Although this amendment post-dates the tax years in question, it is\r\ninstructive as to the intended purpose of the statutes at issue. Specifically, we find\r\nthe explicit inclusion of limited liability companies and silence as to partnerships\r\nindicates a legislative intent to purposefully restrict the types of entities that may\r\nearn and pass through tax credits. Had the legislature intended to authorize all\r\nentities to earn and pass through tax credits, it would not have been necessary to\r\nenact the 2008 amendment as the definition of \"taxpayer,\" which broadly includes\r\n\"any other entity subject to the tax imposed by this chapter or required to file a\r\nreturn,\" would have been sufficient to encompass limited liability companies. S.C.\r\nCode Ann. § 12-6-30(1) (2000) (defining \"taxpayer\"). Moreover, by delineating\r\nthe types of entities that may earn the credit, it is clear that the mere payment of\r\ninfrastructure expenses is not sufficient to qualify for the credit. Rather, in order to\r\nearn the credit, the entity must statutorily qualify and make the requisite\r\nexpenditures to the infrastructure project.\r\n\r\n        Because the legislature is presumed to be aware of prior legislation and does\r\nnot perform futile acts, we find the 2008 amendment represents a conscious\r\ndecision by the legislature to preclude partnerships from earning and passing\r\nthrough certain tax credits. See State v. McKnight, 352 S.C. 635, 648, 576 S.E.2d\r\n168, 175 (2003) (\"There is a presumption that the legislature has knowledge of\r\nprevious legislation as well as of judicial decisions construing that legislation when\r\nlater statutes are enacted concerning related subjects.\"); State ex rel. McLeod v.\r\nMontgomery, 244 S.C. 308, 314, 136 S.E.2d 778, 782 (1964) (\"In seeking the\r\nintention of the legislature, we must presume that it intended by its action to\r\naccomplish something and not to do a futile thing.\"). Accordingly, this\r\namendment is confirmation that our decision to deny Appellant's claim for the\r\nInfrastructure Tax Credits effectuates the intent of the legislature.\r\n\r\n      Although our rules of statutory construction mandate this conclusion, we\r\nquestion the wisdom of the statutory language as we believe an entity that\r\n\nlegitimately expends funds for state infrastructure deserves to be rewarded with a\r\ntax incentive.\r\n\r\n       Given this harsh result, we have looked to other jurisdictions to see if courts\r\nhave permitted the type of pass through that Appellant seeks. While these cases\r\nare not dispositive as they are based on specific state statutes, we view them as\r\ninstructive. In Bell Atlantic Nynex Mobile, Inc. v. Commissioner of Revenue\r\nServices, 869 A.2d 611 (Conn. 2005), the Connecticut Supreme Court analyzed\r\nwhether corporations, which held partnership interests in a partnership, could claim\r\na tax credit as a result of the partnership's payment of personal property taxes on\r\nelectronic data processing equipment. The court ruled that under the terms of the\r\napplicable statute, section 12-217t of the Connecticut General Statutes, the\r\npartnership could not establish eligibility for the tax credit as it did not fall within\r\nthe statutory definition of \"taxpayer\" for purposes of the statute. Id. at 620-21\r\n(citing section 12-213(a)(1) of the Connecticut General Statutes, which defines\r\n\"taxpayer\"). Specifically, the court found \"the text of the statute indicates that the\r\nlegislature intended to grant eligibility for the § 12-217t tax credit to a 'taxpayer'\r\nwho has paid the personal property taxes on the electronic processing equipment\r\nand who can use the tax credit against tax liabilities arising from the corporation\r\nbusiness tax or other specific chapters of the tax code.\" Id. at 620. As a result, the\r\ncourt concluded the credit could not pass through to the corporate partners as no\r\ntax credit existed for their use. Id. at 622.\r\n\r\n       In reaching this conclusion, the court rejected the corporate partners'\r\nargument that partnership law, specifically the conduit treatment of partnership tax\r\nattributes, warranted the pass through of the credit. Id. at 625. Although the court\r\nacknowledged the existence of this theory and statutory pass-through provisions, it\r\nfound that \"[n]ot every action taken by the partnership passes through to the\r\npartners as if they performed the act.\" Id. More specifically, these provisions do\r\nnot \"create credits\" as an entity may only be entitled to a credit by \"virtue of state\r\nlaw.\" Id.\r\n\r\n       Finally, the court rejected the corporate partners' claim that denial of the\r\ncredit \"leads to an absurd result because it denies two corporations acting through a\r\npartnership a benefit that each party could obtain if it acted on its own.\" Id. at 626.\r\nNoting that the corporate partners were \"sophisticated business entities,\" the court\r\nfound the selection of the partnership form of business was \"a critical decision that\r\ncarries with it certain legal consequences, including tax implications.\" Id.\r\nAccordingly, the court concluded that the \"legislature's decision to grant a tax\r\ncredit to certain business forms while denying it to others does not constitute an\r\n\nabsurd result\" as the \"fairness of such decisions remains within the prerogative of\r\nthe legislature\" and not the court. Id.\r\n\r\n       Similarly, the Wisconsin Court of Appeals concluded that a taxpayer\r\ncorporation was not entitled to income tax reduction for sales and use tax made by\r\na partnership, of which the taxpayer was a general partner, as the tax credit statute\r\nallowed a credit for \"the sales and use tax . . . paid by the corporation.\" L&W\r\nConstr. Co. v. Wisc. Dep't of Revenue, 439 N.W.2d 619, 620 (Wisc. Ct. App. 1989)\r\n(quoting section 71.0432(2) of the Wisconsin Statutes). Thus, the statute\r\nunambiguously provided that a credit was only available to corporations that\r\ndirectly pay such sales and use taxes. Id. at 621. The court found the possibility\r\nthat the claiming corporation could have become liable for partnerships debts did\r\nnot bring the corporation within the ambit of the statute. Id.\r\n\r\n      (3) \"Entity\" and \"Aggregate\" Partnership Theories\r\n\r\n       Even if the Pass-Through Statute does not permit Centex Homes to earn and\r\npass through the credit to its three corporate partners, Appellant asserts state and\r\nfederal partnership law dictates that the tax credit be treated as if the individual\r\ncorporate partners generated the credits directly under the \"aggregate\" and \"entity\"\r\ntheories9 of partnership law.\r\n\r\n      In support of this assertion, Appellant cites: (1) section 702(b) of the\r\nInternal Revenue Code (I.R.C.); (2) section 12-6-600 of the South Carolina Code;\r\nand (3) Dalton v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 295 S.C. 174, 367 S.E.2d 459\r\n(Ct. App. 1988) and Ellis v. South Carolina Tax Commission, 280 S.C. 65, 309\r\nS.E.2d 761 (1983),10 wherein this Court addressed the general pass-through statute\r\nnow codified at section 12-6-600.\r\n\r\n9  \"Under the 'entity theory' it is the partnership entity which owns its assets, not\r\nthe partners. Partners are only secondarily liable for the tax debts of the\r\npartnership as they are for any debt of the partnership.\" 68 C.J.S. Partnership §\r\n100 (Supp. 2013) (footnotes omitted). \"Under the 'aggregate theory' as opposed to\r\nthe 'entity theory,' a partnership is an aggregate of individuals and does not\r\nconstitute a separate legal entity.\" Id. \"Under this view, except for tax and other\r\nliabilities and rights created specifically by statute, a partnership has no juridical\r\nexistence except through its partners.\" Id.\r\n10 See Ellis, 280 S.C. at 68, 309 S.E.2d at 762-63 (recognizing that although a\r\npartnership files an informational return, \"the income or losses must be passed\r\n\n      Section 702 of the I.R.C. provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n      The character of any item of income, gain, loss, deduction, or credit\r\n      included in a partner's distributive share under paragraphs (1) through\r\n      (8) of subsection (a) shall be determined as if such item were realized\r\n      directly from the source from which realized by the partnership,\r\n      or incurred in the same manner as incurred by the partnership.\r\n\r\n26 U.S.C.A. § 702(b) (West 2013) (emphasis added). In conjunction, section 12-\r\n6-600 states:An entity treated as a partnership for federal income tax\r\n      purposes is not subject to tax under this chapter. Each partner shall\r\n      include its share of South Carolina partnership income on the partner's\r\n      respective income tax return. All of the provisions of the Internal\r\n      Revenue Code apply to determine the gross income, adjusted gross\r\n      income, and taxable income of a partnership and its partners, subject\r\n      to the modifications provided in Article 9 of this chapter and subject\r\n      to allocation and apportionment as provided in Article 17 of this\r\n      chapter.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-600 (2000).\r\n\r\n       Based on these authorities, Appellant maintains that a \"credit is treated as if\r\nit were realized or incurred by the partner directly from the source without ever\r\nhaving passed through the partnership.\" Thus, because the three partners of Centex\r\nHomes were corporate partners that reported tax deductions for qualifying\r\ninfrastructure expenses, they each earned the credit directly through Centex Homes\r\nas an \"entity\" or through the partners individually as an \"aggregate.\" In turn, the\r\ncredit could be claimed by Appellant.\r\n\r\n\r\nthrough and distributed to the individual partners for separate inclusion or\r\ndeduction in their individual tax returns\"; explaining that \"each item of income,\r\ngain, loss, deduction or credit is treated as if it were realized or incurred by the\r\npartner directly from the source without ever having passed through the\r\npartnership\"); Dalton, 295 S.C. at 180, 367 S.E.2d at 462 (citing Ellis and\r\nreaffirming principle that every item of gain, loss, deduction or credit retains its\r\ncharacter as before the pass through takes place).\r\n\n        We find that none of the above-cited authorities support Appellant's\r\nposition. Although Appellant is correct that a credit may be passed through a\r\npartnership to its individual partners either through the aggregate theory or the\r\nentity theory, the condition precedent to the pass through is that the credit is\r\ninitially earned by the partnership. As previously stated, Centex Homes did not\r\nqualify for the infrastructure credit as it may be claimed only by corporations.\r\nThus, there was no credit to distribute or allocate to its three corporate partners\r\nand, in turn, Appellant.\r\n\r\n      (4) Consolidated Corporate Tax Return\r\n\r\n       Finally, Appellant asserts it should be allowed to claim the credits as its\r\nconsolidated return reflected the single tax liability of its corporate affiliates.11 By\r\nfiling a consolidated return, Appellant maintains that all income tax credits must be\r\ndetermined on a consolidated basis and should, therefore, reduce the consolidated\r\ngroup's tax liability \"regardless of whether or not the corporation entitled to the\r\ncredit contributed to the tax liability of the consolidated group.\"12 Because the\r\nqualifying infrastructure expenditures were incurred by Appellant's corporate\r\npartners, Appellant argues it should be allowed to claim the credit against its\r\nconsolidated tax liability.\r\n\r\n       Although Appellant is correct that a consolidated group may be treated as a\r\nsingle taxpayer and claim a credit on a consolidated basis, the group must first be\r\nentitled to the credit as stated in subsection (H) of the Infrastructure Credit Statute.\r\nSee S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420(H) (2000) (\"A corporation which files or is\r\nrequired to file a consolidated return is entitled to the income tax credit allowed by\r\nthis section on a consolidated basis. The tax credit may be determined on a\r\nconsolidated basis regardless of whether or not the corporation entitled to the\r\ncredit contributed to the tax liability of the consolidated group.\" (emphasis added)).\r\n\r\n\r\n11  See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-5020(A)(1) (2000 & Supp. 2012) (authorizing the\r\nfiling of a consolidated return for a parent corporation and substantially controlled\r\nsubsidiaries); id. § 12-6-5020(D) (providing that \"[a] consolidated return means a\r\nsingle return for two or more corporations in which income or loss is separately\r\ndetermined\").\r\n12 See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-5020(F) (providing that corporation, which files a\r\nconsolidated return and is entitled to one or more income tax credits, must\r\ndetermine credits on a consolidated basis).\r\n\n       In the instant case, neither the Centex Homes partnership nor its corporate\r\npartners were ever eligible to claim a credit. Appellant, simply by filing a\r\nconsolidated return, cannot change this statutory prohibition. Cf. Emerson Elec.\r\nCo. v. Wasson, 287 S.C. 394, 397, 339 S.E.2d 118, 120 (1986) (recognizing that\r\n\"when two or more corporations join in a consolidated tax return, each remains an\r\nidentifiable taxpayer\" and that \"[a] corporation does not lose its status as an\r\nidentifiable entity by affiliating with another\").\r\n\r\n                                  IV. Conclusion\r\n\r\n       Based on the foregoing, we find the plain language of the Infrastructure\r\nCredit Statute is clear that only a corporation may claim the credit. Because the\r\npartnership of Centex Homes incurred the infrastructure project expenses, it did\r\nnot qualify for the credit. Thus, there was no credit available to pass through to its\r\npartners and, in turn, to Appellant. Furthermore, we find the legislature's 2008\r\namendment to the Pass-Through Statute, which allowed limited liability companies\r\nto earn the same tax credits as a corporation, confirms this result as it represents a\r\npurposeful act to restrict the types of entities that may earn and pass through tax\r\ncredits. Although Appellant presents several potential methods of acquiring the\r\ncredit directly or indirectly from its affiliates, we find none to be persuasive as the\r\nterms of the statutes may not be ignored or circumvented.\r\n\r\n       Even though we question the reasoning for restricting the infrastructure\r\ncredit to corporate entities, we believe the statutory language is clear that the\r\nlegislature intended this limitation. The result here may appear to be inequitable;\r\nhowever, we are constrained to conclude it is correct under extant law. The\r\nwisdom of tax policy is exclusively within the purview of the legislature and may\r\nnot be supplanted by this Court. See Taiheiyo Cement U.S.A., Inc. v. Franchise\r\nTax Bd., 138 Cal. Rptr. 3d 536, 538-39 (Cal. Ct. App. 2012) (\"It is fundamental\r\nthat the extent of allowable deductions is dependent exclusively upon legislative\r\ngrace and does not turn upon equitable considerations and that a taxpayer claiming\r\na deduction must bring himself squarely within the terms of a statute expressly\r\nauthorizing it.\" (citation omitted)). Accordingly, we affirm the ALC's order that\r\ndenied Appellant's claim for the infrastructure credits.\r\n\r\n      AFFIRMED.\r\n\r\n      HEARN, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. TOAL, C.J.,\r\ndissenting in a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: I respectfully dissent. In my view the ALC erred in\r\nconcluding that Appellant's corporate affiliates were not eligible to claim\r\ninfrastructure tax credits pursuant to section 12-6-3420 of the South Carolina\r\nCode. I would reverse and remand.\r\n\r\n      Section 12-6-3420 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n      (A) A corporation may claim a credit for the construction or\r\n          improvement of an infrastructure project against taxes due under\r\n          Section 12-6-530 or Section 12-11-20 for:\r\n\r\n          (1) expenses paid or accrued by the taxpayer;\r\n\r\n          (2) contributions made to a governmental entity; or\r\n\r\n          (3) \tcontributions made to a qualified private entity in the case of\r\n               water or sewer lines and their related facilities in areas served\r\n               by a private water and sewer company.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3420 (Supp. 2012).\r\n\r\n       In my view, section 12-6-3420 requires a corporation claim the credit on its\r\ncorporate tax return, which must reflect permitted infrastructure related expenses\r\nor contributions by \"the taxpayer.\" The Department argues that \"the taxpayer\"\r\nrefers exclusively to the \"corporation\" mentioned in subsection (A).13 I disagree.\r\n\r\n\r\n13In my opinion, the Department's argument regarding the definition of \"taxpayer\"\r\ndiffers significantly, and notably, from prior interpretations. For example, in\r\nMedia General Communications, Incorporated v. South Carolina Department of\r\nRevenue, 388 S.C. 138, 694 S.E.2d 525 (2010), three associated corporations (the\r\ncorporations) challenged the accounting procedure the Department utilized in\r\ncalculating the corporations' South Carolina income tax. That case centered on\r\nsection 12-6-2320 of the South Carolina Code, which provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n      (A) If the allocation and apportionment provisions of this chapter do\r\n          not fairly represent the extent of the taxpayer's business activity in\r\n          this State, the taxpayer may petition for, or [the Department] may\r\n          require, in respect to all or any part of the taxpayer's business\r\n          activity, if reasonable:\r\n\n      (4) the employment of any other method to effectuate an equitable allocation\r\n          and apportionment of the taxpayer's income.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-2320(4).\r\n\r\n       The Department initially issued tax assessments for the corporations\r\nutilizing the separate entity apportionment method (the SEA method), the\r\nDepartment's standard method for apportioning income among multi-state, related\r\nbusiness entities. Id. at 142, 694 S.E.2d at 526–27 (\"South Carolina's statutory\r\napportionment methodology as utilized in the Department's assessments . . . results\r\nin income taxes and license fees . . . in the amount of $3,758,320.\"). The\r\ncorporations filed a protest requesting the Department use the combined entity\r\napportionment method (the CEA method). The CEA method's details are not\r\npertinent to the instant case, but resulted in a significantly lower tax burden of\r\n$863,179. Id. at 142, 694 S.E.2d at 527. The Department determined that the\r\nCEA method fairly represented the corporations' business activities, but denied the\r\ncorporations' petition on the ground that the Department did not have the authority\r\nto require use of the CEA method. Id. at 143, 694 S.E.2d at 527. The ALC\r\nreversed, finding that the allowance of the use of \"any other method\" as provided\r\nby section 12-6-2320(4) encompassed [the CEA method]. Id. The Department\r\nappealed, and advanced an argument rooted firmly in the statutory definition of\r\n\"taxpayer:\"\r\n\r\n      The Department . . . argues section 12–6–2320(A)(4) should not be\r\n      construed to allow [the CEA method] based on the legislative intent\r\n      expressed in the corporate tax statutes requiring the filing of tax\r\n      returns by a single entity. Specifically, the South Carolina Code\r\n      defines \"taxpayer\" as including \"an individual, trust, estate,\r\n      partnership, association, company, corporation, or any other entity\r\n      subject to the tax imposed by this chapter or required to file a return.\"\r\n      S.C. Code Ann. § 12–6–30(1) (2000). The Department notes the\r\n      definition refers to a single corporation as a taxpayer and thus to\r\n      separate filing requirements for each entity. Consequently, this\r\n      definition must be used for the meaning of \"taxpayer\" as it appears in\r\n      section 12–6–2320(A) and it limits the statute's application to a\r\n      separate entity.\r\n\r\nId. at 148–49, 694 S.E.2d at 530 (finding that the ALC was not required to defer to\r\nan interpretation contrary to the plain language of the statute (emphasis in\r\n\nThe term \"taxpayer\" is statutorily defined, \"unless otherwise required by context,\"\r\nto mean an individual, trust, estate, partnership, association, company, corporation,\r\nor any other entity subject to taxation. See S.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-30(1). In my\r\nview, the current context—the General Assembly's intent to encourage and reward\r\ninfrastructure investment—does not demand limiting the statutory definition of\r\n\"taxpayer.\" Moreover, in my opinion, the General Assembly's use of the word\r\n\"the,\" preceding \"taxpayer,\" does not evince an intent for that term to only denote\r\ncorporation. Said another way, the General Assembly could have consistently used\r\nthe term \"corporation,\" rather than taxpayer. For example, and as Appellant notes,\r\nthe statute would have then provided:\r\n\r\n      A) \tA corporation may claim a credit for the construction or\r\n          improvement of an infrastructure project against taxes due under\r\n          Section 12-6-530 or Section 12-11-20 for:\r\n\r\n          (1) expenses paid or accrued by the taxpayer corporation;\r\n\r\n       However, the General Assembly did not provide such limiting language.\r\nSee Brown v. Martin, 203 S.C. 84, 88, 26 S.E.2d 317, 318 (1943) (\"The General\r\nAssembly has power to prescribe legal definitions of its own language, and such\r\ndefinitions are generally binding upon the Courts, and should prevail.\" (citation\r\nomitted)); see Bell Finance Co., Inc. v. S.C. Dept. of Consumer Affairs, 297 S.C.\r\n111, 114, 374 S.E.2d 918, 920 (Ct. App. 1988) (\"Where the statute, however,\r\ncontains words that are statutorily defined, the statutory definitions should\r\ngenerally be followed in interpreting the statute.\"); see also Introini v. S.C. Nat'l\r\nGuard, 828 F. Supp. 391, 396–97 (D.S.C. 1993) (finding legislative definitions\r\ncontrolling).\r\n\r\n       In my opinion, section 12-6-3420 is not ambiguous, and the clear and\r\nplain meaning of the language allows Appellant to claim a credit for\r\ninfrastructure expenses accrued by Centex Homes, the statutorily defined\r\n\"taxpayer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\noriginal)). However, in the instant case, the Department asks the Court to ignore\r\nthe statutory definition of taxpayer to achieve their now intended result, one at\r\nodds with the General Assembly's intent.\r\n\n        The Department relies heavily on the general rule that tax credits and\r\nexemptions are a matter of legislative grace, and thus, strictly construed\r\nagainst the taxpayer. See, e.g., C. W. Matthews Contracting Co., Inc. v. S.C.\r\nTax Comm'n, 267 S.C. 548, 230 S.E.2d 223 (1976) (\"However, [Southern\r\nSoya Corp. v. Wasson, 252 S.C. 484, 167 S.E.2d 311 (1969)], and Chronicle\r\nPublishers, [Inc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 244 S.C. 192, 136 S.E.2d 261 (1964)]\r\nrecognize a principle that applies in the present case: that a deduction is a\r\nmatter of legislative grace; and that a statute allowing a deduction, if\r\nambiguous, is construed strictly against the taxpayer.\"). However, this\r\npolicy does not place a thumb on the scale of the Department, and simply\r\nmeans that \"constitutional and statutory language will not be strained or\r\nliberally construed in the taxpayer's favor,\" and this Court will not seek an\r\ninterpretation in the Department's favor \"where the plain and unambiguous\r\nlanguage leaves no room for construction.\" CFRE, LLC v. Greenville Cnty.\r\nAssessor, 395 S.C. 67, 74–75, 716 S.E.2d 877, 881 (2011) (citing Se.-Kusan,\r\nInc. v. S.C. Tax Comm'n, 276 S.C. 487, 489, 280 S.E.2d 57, 58 (1981)). In\r\nfact, it is \"[o]nly when the literal application of the statute produces an\r\nabsurd result will we consider a different meaning.\" CFRE, 395 S.C. at 75,\r\n716 S.E.2d at 881 (citation omitted). In my opinion, allowing Appellant to\r\nclaim the infrastructure tax credit is not an absurd result given the General\r\nAssembly's clear intent.14\r\n\r\n14 The Department argues that the term \"taxpayer\" is limited to the corporation\r\nmentioned in section 12-6-3420, and that if this Court relies on the statutory\r\ndefinition of \"taxpayer,\" the \"absurdity arises that subsections (A)(2) and (A)(3)\r\nremain devoid of a reference to any type of entity, leaving a relation back to the\r\ncorporation as the only proper conclusion.\" According to the Department, to\r\n\"argue that expenditures under these two subsections should be made by\r\ncorporations only, but qualifying expenses under subsection (A)(1) opens the\r\ninfrastructure credit to all forms of taxpayers is patently illogical.\" However,\r\nsubsections (A)(2) and (A)(3) also do not contain the word \"taxpayer\" as used in\r\nsubsection (A)(1). Thus, the Department actually advances the argument\r\nsubsections (A)(2) and (A)(3) both relate back to the term \"taxpayer\" in subsection\r\n(A)(1), and taken together, all three subsections relate back to the term corporation,\r\na single corporation, as found in section (A)'s first paragraph. In my opinion, it is\r\njust as plausible that the General Assembly intended taxpayer's applicable\r\nstatutory definition to control subsections (A)(2) and (A)(3). Thus, in my view,\r\nthere are competing and conceivable interpretations of the import of the term\r\ntaxpayer in section 12-6-3420, and the Department fails to demonstrate any absurd\r\nresult.\r\n\n       The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\nintent of the legislature. See Charleston Cnty. Sch. Dist. v. State Budget & Control\r\nBd., 313 S.C. 1, 5, 437 S.E.2d 6, 8 (1993) (citing Bankers Trust of S.C. v. Bruce,\r\n275 S.C. 35, 37–38, 267 S.E.2d 424. 425 (1980). In my view, the statute is clearly\r\nintended to encourage and reward infrastructure investment in South Carolina, and\r\nthe Department and ALC articulate an interpretation which frustrates the General\r\nAssembly's intent.\r\n\r\n       Additionally, in my opinion, the pass-through provisions of section 12-6-\r\n3310 allow the general partnership in this case to pass through the tax credit earned\r\nin section 12-6-3420 to Appellant. Section 12-6-3310 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n       (B)(1) \t Unless specifically prohibited, an \"S\" corporation, limited\r\n                liability company taxed as a partnership, or partnership that\r\n                qualifies for a credit pursuant to this article may pass\r\n                through the credit earned to each shareholder of the \"S\"\r\n                corporation, member of the limited liability company, or\r\n                partner of the partnership.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 12-6-3310 (Supp. 2012) (emphasis added). In my opinion, as\r\ndiscussed supra, because the expenses Centex Homes incurred qualify for the\r\ncredit, the general partnership should be allowed to \"pass through\" this credit to its\r\nthree corporate partners—wholly owned subsidiaries of Appellant. In my opinion,\r\nthe \"unless specifically prohibited\" language in section 12-6-3310 is significant.\r\nThere is no statutory provision specifically prohibiting a corporation from claiming\r\na tax credit generated by a partnership the corporation controls, nor is there a\r\nprovision explicitly preventing the partnership from passing this credit back to the\r\nentity's partners.\r\n\r\n      For the foregoing reasons, I would reverse the ALC's decision.\r\n\r\n      KITTREDGE, J., concurs\r\n\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27289","title":"In the Matter of James Michael Brown,","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/HTMLFiles/SC/27289.pdf","description":"This is an order definitely suspending a lawyer from the practice of law.","date":"2013-07-31","type":"opinion","text":"                   THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA \n\r\n                        In The Supreme Court \n\r\n\r\n            In the Matter of James Michael Brown, Respondent.\r\n\r\n            Appellate Case No. 2013-000463\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Opinion No. 27289 \n\r\n                    Heard May 14, 2013 – Filed July 31, 2013 \n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           DEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n            Lesley M.

He requests the suspension or disbarment be made retroactive to\r\nFebruary 8, 2013, the date of his interim suspension. In the Matter of Taylor, S.C.\r\nSup. Ct. Order dated February 8, 2013 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 7 at 72). In\r\naddition, respondent agrees to complete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program\r\nEthics School prior to seeking reinstatement or readmission. We accept the\r\nAgreement and disbar respondent from the practice of law in this state, retroactive\r\nto the date of respondent's interim suspension. Id. We further order respondent to\r\ncomplete the Legal Ethics and Practice Program Ethics School prior to seeking\r\nreinstatement. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\nIn March 2010, respondent was retained to assist Client in filing a civil action\r\nregarding a contract dispute. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss on the\r\nmerits. The motion to dismiss was not heard as Client's lawsuit was\r\nadministratively dismissed in April 2011 due to the parties' failure to comply with\r\ncertain ADR requirements. Respondent did not advise Client of the dismissal and\r\ntook no further action on Client's behalf.\r\n\r\nIn late 2011, Client inquired about the status of his lawsuit. In response,\r\nrespondent falsely stated to Client that the defendant had filed a motion for\r\nsummary judgment that would need to be resolved before the case could move\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nIn May 2012, Client again inquired about the status of the lawsuit. In response,\r\nrespondent falsely stated to Client that a hearing had been scheduled in August\r\n2012 to address the motion for summary judgment. Following the date of the\r\nfictitious summary judgment hearing, respondent falsely stated to Client that the\r\nmotion was taken under advisement by the judge.\r\n\r\nIn October 2012, respondent falsely stated to Client that summary judgment had\r\nbeen granted. When Client asked for a copy of the order, respondent created a fake\r\norder and forged the name of the judge on it. Respondent did not immediately\r\nprovide the order to Client. In December 2012, after another request, respondent\r\nforwarded the false order to Client.\r\n\r\nIn January 2013, after receiving a copy of the false order which purportedly held\r\nClient's contract insufficient, Client consulted another attorney about drafting\r\nfuture contracts that would be enforceable. During that consultation, Client\r\nreferenced the lawsuit and the summary judgment order. The new attorney\r\nreviewed the order and discovered it did not have the clerk's date stamp. The new\r\nattorney sent his assistant to the courthouse to get a clocked copy of the order. The\r\nclerk's office was unable to locate a copy of the order.\r\n\r\nThe new attorney then contacted respondent for a clocked copy of the order.\r\nRespondent scanned a clocked copy of a filed pleading in an unrelated matter and\r\ndigitally cut the clerk's stamp from that document and pasted it on the false\r\nsummary judgment order in Client's case. On January 18, 2013, respondent\r\nforwarded the altered document to the new attorney by email message with a copy\r\nto Client stating:\r\n\n      I have attached the filed order as we discussed. The time to appeal ran back\r\n      in November, and honestly while I didn't agree with all the rulings I didn't\r\n      see any grounds for appeal. As you can imagine [Client] was not going to\r\n      be pleased with the result but in the end the litigations costs were likely\r\n      going to far exceed the recovery anyway.\r\n\r\nThe new attorney then confirmed with the clerk's office that the order had not been\r\nfiled, that the judge whose name appeared on the signature line had been on\r\nvacation at the time of the purported summary judgment hearing, and that the\r\nmatter had been administratively dismissed in April 2011.\r\n\r\nOn January 23, 2013, the deputy clerk of court called respondent and informed him\r\nthat the motion for summary judgment and summary judgment order could not be\r\nlocated in the court's file. Respondent falsely stated to the deputy clerk that\r\nanother judge (a judge other than the one who was shown on the order) had\r\nactually heard the motion and that the defendant's motion to dismiss was\r\n\"converted\" to a motion for summary judgment. The deputy clerk then asked\r\nrespondent to bring his file to her office. Respondent informed the deputy clerk\r\nthat he would not be able to bring the file until the next afternoon.\r\n\r\nOn January 24, 2013, respondent met with Client and told him the truth about the\r\ncase and his falsification and forgery of the order. Client then accompanied\r\nrespondent to the clerk's office where respondent admitted to the deputy clerk that\r\nhe had fabricated and forged the order. The matter was reported to the Chief Judge\r\nfor Administrative Purposes. The Chief Judge for Administrative Purposes, the\r\nnew attorney, and respondent each reported this matter to ODC.\r\n\r\nRespondent's law firm has reimbursed Client for all fees and costs paid.\r\n\r\n                                        Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall\r\nprovide competent representation to client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by\r\nclient's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall consult with\r\nthe client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall\r\nact with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4\r\n(lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about the status of the matter and\r\npromptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.16(a)(2)\r\n\n(lawyer shall not represent a client or, where representation has commenced, shall\r\nwithdraw from the representation of client if lawyer's mental condition materially\r\nimpairs the lawyer's ability to represent the client); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make\r\nreasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with interests of client); Rule 4.1\r\n(in course of representing client, lawyer shall not knowingly make false statement\r\nof material fact or law to third person); Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct\r\nfor lawyer to commit criminal act that reflects adversely on lawyer's honesty,\r\ntrustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); Rule 8.4(d) (it is\r\nprofessional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\nfraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct\r\nfor lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of justice).\r\n\r\nRespondent also admits he has violated the following Rules for Lawyer\r\nDisciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for\r\ndiscipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it\r\nshall be ground for discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute\r\nthe administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\ndisrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(6)\r\n(it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate the oath of office taken to\r\npractice law in this state).         Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent from\r\nthe practice of law, retroactive to February 8, 2013, the date of his interim\r\nsuspension. Id.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara\r\n             M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia,\r\n             for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\r\n             Gary D. James, Sr., pro se, of North Myrtle Beach, for\r\n             respondent.\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Office of Disciplinary\r\nCounsel (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by\r\nConsent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\nEnforcement (RLDE) contained in Rule 413 of the South Carolina Appellate Court\r\nRules (SCACR). In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\ndisbarment. He requests the disbarment be made retroactive to November 15,\r\n2011, the date of his interim suspension. In the Matter of James, 395 S.C. 333, 718\r\nS.E.2d 430 (2011). In addition, respondent agrees to pay the costs incurred in the\r\ninvestigation and prosecution of this matter by ODC and the Commission on\r\nLawyer Conduct (the Commission) within thirty (30) days of the imposition of\r\ndiscipline. Further, within sixty (60) days of the imposition of discipline,\r\nrespondent agrees to enter into a payment plan to pay restitution as enumerated\r\nhereafter. We accept the Agreement and disbar respondent from the practice of\r\nlaw in this state, not retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension. In\r\naddition, respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission in\r\nthe investigation and prosecution of this matter within thirty (30) days of the date\r\nof this opinion and shall, within sixty (60) days of the date of this opinion, enter\r\n\ninto a payment plan with the Commission to pay restitution as set forth hereafter in\r\nthis opinion. The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.\r\n\r\n                                       Facts\r\n\r\n                                      Matter I\r\n\r\nFrom 2003 until his interim suspension in November 2011, respondent was a solo\r\npractitioner. His practice focused primarily on real estate matters, but he also\r\nhandled probate matters.\r\n\r\nRespondent maintained two trust accounts at Conway National Bank. One account\r\nwas for real estate transactions; the other was for all other client matters.\r\nRespondent did not fully comply with the recordkeeping and reconciliation\r\nrequirements set forth in Rule 417, SCACR, for either account. Respondent's\r\nmonthly reconciliation process consisted of comparing his monthly bank statement\r\nto his client settlement statements, then checking off items on the settlement\r\nstatements as those items cleared. Once all items on a settlement statement\r\ncleared, respondent shredded the settlement statement. Respondent did not\r\nmaintain client ledgers for six years as required by Rule 417. Other violations of\r\nRule 417 included failure to create or maintain reconciliation reports. As a result\r\nof respondent's lack of records, a complete accounting of funds is not possible.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter II\r\n\r\nRespondent conducted a real estate closing in which his client was purchasing\r\nproperty from a state agency. Respondent issued the purchase money check from\r\nhis real estate trust account to the state agency on July 13, 2011, even though he\r\nhad not received the funds to cover the check from his client. Respondent asked\r\nthe state agency to hold the check until the deed was received and recorded. On\r\nJuly 28, 2011, respondent informed the state agency it could negotiate the check.\r\nThe check was returned for insufficient funds because the client's funds were not\r\ncredited to the trust account until July 29, 2011.\r\n\r\n                                     Matter III\r\n\r\nFrom 2007 through 2011, respondent issued approximately $1,407,928.00 in\r\nchecks payable to himself or to his law firm from his real estate trust account.\r\nRecords produced by respondent reflect approximately $182,572.00 of the funds\r\n\nwere earned fees. Respondent's records are not sufficient to explain the difference\r\nof approximately $1,225,356.00 in disbursements.\r\n\r\nHowever, it can be determined that, sometime in 2010, respondent could not cover\r\nthe disbursement in a real estate closing because the balance in his real estate trust\r\naccount was insufficient. From that point forward, respondent engaged in a pattern\r\nof using funds received for one real estate closing to pay off the loan in a previous\r\nclosing.                                 A.\r\n\r\nIn January 2011, respondent conducted a cash closing for Client A. Client A wired\r\n$487,883.31 to respondent's real estate trust account for the purchase of the\r\nproperty. Respondent was supposed to use the funds to pay off the seller's\r\nmortgage of approximately $435,132.03. After the deposit of Client A's funds,\r\nrespondent paid the commissions and other closing costs, but did not have\r\nsufficient funds to pay off the loan. The balance in respondent's real estate trust\r\naccount at the end of January 2011 was only $148,577.99.\r\n\r\nIn February 2011, respondent used the remaining funds from Client A to pay off\r\nthe loan in a prior closing. The payoff of the loan in the prior closing left only\r\n$74.00 in the trust account. The seller's mortgage in the Client A closing remained\r\nunpaid.\r\n\r\nIn March 2011, respondent conducted a real estate closing for Client B.\r\nRespondent used the funds received for Client B's closing to issue a check for\r\n$200,000.00 as a partial payment on the seller's loan in the Client A closing.\r\n\r\nIn May 2011, respondent borrowed $225,000.00 from Mr. Doe, a client and friend.\r\nRespondent deposited that money into his trust account and used the money to pay\r\noff the loan in the Client B closing and to make monthly payments on the balance\r\nof the loan in the Client A closing.\r\n\r\nIn August 2011, respondent attempted to make arrangements to borrow another\r\n$200,000.00 from Mr. Doe. Respondent intended to deposit the proceeds of this\r\nsecond loan into his operating account and then transfer it to his real estate trust\r\naccount to pay off the balance in the Client A closing. Before respondent received\r\nthe money, he wrote a check for $200,000.00 from his operating account and\r\ndeposited it into his real estate trust account. He then arranged to wire funds to pay\r\noff the balance of the loan in the Client A closing. At the time respondent wrote\r\n\nthe operating account check and sent the wire from his real estate trust account, he\r\nknew he had not deposited funds to cover these transactions.\r\n\r\nUltimately, respondent did not receive a second loan from Mr. Doe. The operating\r\naccount check failed to clear because respondent never deposited the funds to\r\ncover it. As a result, $200,000.00 was charged back to respondent's trust account.\r\nIn the meantime, respondent's title insurance company paid the seller's loan in the\r\nClient A closing.                        B.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 2011, Client C wired $10,600.00 to respondent's real estate trust\r\naccount for the purchase of a time share from the trust of an elderly woman with\r\nAlzheimer's disease. The transaction was scheduled to close in September 2011.\r\nRespondent transferred the time share but did not pay the seller's trust.\r\n\r\nFrom the date of the receipt of Client C's wire until August 31, 2011, respondent\r\nissued nine checks from his real estate trust account payable to his law firm\r\ntotaling $11,280.00. Respondent's records are insufficient to determine whether or\r\nnot any of these payments were legitimate, however, none of these payments were\r\nmade on behalf of Client C. The balance in the real estate trust account fell below\r\nthe amount of the Client C deposit eleven times in August and September 2011.\r\nFunds were not available to cover Client C's closing at the time of respondent's\r\ninterim suspension in November 2011.     C.\r\n\r\nOn August 30, 2011, respondent deposited $236,000.00 received for a refinance\r\nclosing for Mr. and Mrs. Roe into his real estate trust account. The loan proceeds\r\nwere supposed to be used to pay off three existing loans totaling $226,689.14 and\r\nto cover closing costs. The Roes' credit union was the lender on the new loan and\r\nthe existing loans. Upon receipt of the proceeds of the Roes' new loan, respondent\r\nused part of those funds to reimburse the title insurance company for its payoff of\r\nthe Client A loan. On September 9, 2011, respondent conducted the Roes' closing\r\nknowing funds received for that purpose were not in his real estate trust account.\r\nRespondent did not mail the payoffs of the Roes' existing loans to the credit union.\r\n\r\nBetween August 30, 2011, and September 26, 2011, respondent wrote twelve\r\nchecks payable to his law firm totaling $12,090.00. At the end of September 2011,\r\nthe balance in respondent's real estate trust account was less than $5,000.00, more\r\n\nthan $220,000.00 short of the funds that were due in connection with the Roe\r\nclosing.\r\n\r\nFor several weeks, the Roes and representatives of the credit union made repeated,\r\nunsuccessful attempts to contact respondent about the payoff of the existing loans.\r\nOn October 18, 2011, respondent contacted the Roes and told them they could\r\ncome to his office to pick up the payoff checks at 10:00 a.m. the next morning.\r\nFor medical reasons, the Roes could not drive to Myrtle Beach, so a representative\r\nof the credit union agreed to go.\r\n\r\nOn October 19, 2011, respondent gave the credit union representative four checks,\r\nthree from his real estate trust account and one from his operating account. At the\r\ntime respondent disbursed the checks, there were no funds in his accounts to cover\r\nthem. Respondent had received a $350,000.00 check for a closing from another\r\nclient1 and had intended to use this money to cover the checks to pay off the Roe's\r\nloans, but he had not yet deposited that check.\r\n\r\nUpon receipt of the Roes' payoff checks, the credit union representative went to the\r\nMyrtle Beach branch of the Conway National Bank which was two blocks away\r\nfrom respondent's office. The representative inquired if there were sufficient funds\r\nin the accounts to cover the checks and was informed there were not sufficient\r\nfunds.\r\n\r\nThe credit union representative returned to respondent's office. Respondent\r\ninformed the representative that he had not yet made the deposit to cover the\r\nchecks, but intended to do so later in the day. Respondent then agreed to make the\r\ndeposit and meet the representative at noon. Respondent then drove to the Conway\r\nbranch of the bank, miles from his office, rather than make the deposit at the\r\nbranch nearby. Respondent deposited the other client's closing check into his trust\r\naccount then returned to his office in Myrtle Beach and showed the credit union\r\nrepresentative the deposit slip as evidence that the Roes' payoff checks were\r\ncovered. The credit union representative then deposited the checks into the credit\r\nunion account.\r\n\r\nThe three Roe payoff checks written on the real estate trust account were returned\r\ndue to insufficient funds as the bank had placed a hold on the $350,000.00 check.\r\nUltimately, the bank determined that the check was fraudulent. At the time the\r\n\r\n Respondent does not recall the name of this client and he is unable to produce any\r\n1\r\n\r\n\r\ndocumentation related to this closing.\r\n\nbank returned the Roe payoff checks to the credit union, there was only $10.25 in\r\nrespondent's real estate trust account. Forty-six dollars and sixty-five cents\r\n($46.65) remained in respondent's other trust account.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter IV\r\n\r\nAfter paying the mortgage in the Client A closing, the title insurance company\r\nterminated respondent as an approved closing attorney. Respondent manufactured\r\na closing protection letter for the Roe closing by using a closing protection letter\r\nfrom an unrelated file and cutting and pasting the Roes' closing information onto it;\r\nrespondent submitted the letter to the Roes' lender. The closing was not approved\r\nby the title insurance company and the closing protection letter was not valid. As a\r\nresult, when respondent failed to pay off the Roes' existing loans, there was no title\r\ninsurance to cover the loss. Consequently, the Roes were obligated to make\r\nmonthly payments on both the new mortgage and existing loans.\r\n\r\nThe Roes made monthly payments on all of the loans until the matter was sorted\r\nout. The matter was resolved when the credit union agreed not to collect on the\r\nnew loan and to restore the Roes to the position they were in prior to the refinance.\r\nThe credit union filed a claim with its insurance carrier for the loss of the new loan\r\nproceeds. The Lawyers' Fund paid the Roes $4,231.45 as reimbursement for the\r\nextra loan payments they made to the credit union.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter V\r\n\r\nRespondent had represented Mr. Doe and his company in a number of matters for\r\nseveral years. See Matter III (A). On May 30, 2011, in an attempt to cover for the\r\nfunds in the Client B closing, respondent borrowed $225,000.00 from Mr. Doe. At\r\nthe time of the loan, respondent was representing Mr. Doe's company in a real\r\nestate transaction. Respondent signed a promissory note stating that he would\r\nrepay the full amount plus 10% interest on June 30, 2011. When respondent was\r\nunable to repay the loan as agreed, he promised Mr. Doe he would file a mortgage\r\nto secure the loan.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to comply with the Rules of Professional Conduct when he\r\nentered into this business transaction with his client, Mr. Doe. First, the terms of\r\nthe loan were not fair and reasonable to Mr. Doe as respondent knew the only\r\nsource for repayment would be funds received on behalf of a client for a real estate\r\nclosing. Respondent knew he would not obtain funds from a legitimate source to\r\npay off the loan to Mr. Doe within thirty days. Second, respondent failed to advise\r\n\nMr. Doe, in writing or otherwise, of the desirability of seeking the advice of\r\nindependent legal counsel regarding the loan. Finally, respondent failed to disclose\r\nthe conflict of interest or obtain Mr. Doe's informed, written consent, as required\r\nby the Rules of Professional Conduct.\r\n\r\nRespondent failed to repay the loan as agreed. Respondent did not record a\r\nmortgage to secure the loan. In December 2011, Mr. Doe filed a civil action in an\r\nattempt to recover the funds. In April 2012, Mr. Doe obtained a default judgment\r\nagainst respondent in the amount of $247,320.14. The judgment has not been paid.\r\n\r\n                                      Matter VI\r\n\r\nIn June 2011, Client D retained respondent to probate an estate. Client D paid\r\nrespondent $1,500.00 for attorney's fees and $452.84 due to the Probate Court.\r\nUpon respondent's interim suspension in November 2011, Client D learned the\r\nfunds had not been paid to the Probate Court. Client D was informed by the\r\nattorney appointed to protect respondent's clients' interests that her funds were not\r\non deposit in respondent's trust account.\r\n\r\nClient D had to hire another attorney to assist her with the estate. Client D paid the\r\nfunds to the Probate Court. She received $1,952.84 from the Lawyers' Fund as\r\nreimbursement of the attorney's fees and other funds paid to respondent.\r\n\r\n                                         Law\r\n\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of\r\nthe Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act\r\nwith reasonable diligence and promptness in representing client); Rule 1.7(a)(2)\r\n(lawyer shall not represent client if there is significant risk that the representation\r\nof one or more clients will be materially limited by the lawyer's responsibilities to\r\nanother client, a former client or a third person or by a personal interest of the\r\nlawyer); Rule 1.8(a) (lawyer shall not enter into a business transaction with a client\r\nor knowingly acquire an ownership, possessory, security or other pecuniary\r\ninterest adverse to a client unless: a) the transaction and terms on which lawyer\r\nacquires the interest are fair and reasonable to the client and are fully disclosed and\r\ntransmitted in writing in a manner that can be reasonably understood by the client;\r\nb) the client is advised in writing of the desirability of seeking and is given a\r\nreasonable opportunity to seek the advice of independent legal counsel on the\r\ntransaction; and c) the client gives informed consent, in a writing signed by the\r\nclient, to the essential terms of the transaction and the lawyer's role in the\r\n\ntransaction, including whether the lawyer is representing the client in the\r\ntransaction); Rule 1.15(a) (lawyer shall hold property of clients or third persons\r\nseparate from lawyer's own property and shall retain complete records of funds for\r\nsix years after termination of representation); Rule 1.15(d) (lawyer shall promptly\r\ndeliver to client or third person any funds or other property that the client or third\r\nperson is entitled to receive); Rule 1.15(f) (lawyer shall not disburse funds from\r\ntrust account unless funds to be disbursed have been deposited and collected); Rule\r\n1.15(g) (lawyer shall not use any entrusted property to obtain credit or other\r\npersonal benefit for lawyer or any person other than the legal or beneficial owner\r\nof the property); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client, lawyer shall not\r\nknowingly make false statement of material fact or law to a third person); Rule\r\n8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit criminal act that reflects\r\nadversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a lawyer in other\r\nrespects); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\nconduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).
