We affirm in part \r\n  and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThis case involves an auto accident \r\n  between the Barnettesâ€™ 1991 Plymouth van and a logging truck owned by respondent, \r\n  Adams Brothers Logging, Inc.  Sixteen-year old Voncorie Barnette was driving \r\n  the Plymouth van; his eight-year old brother Marlos and his mother Evelyn were \r\n  passengers.  The van was stopped at a red light in Rock Hill.  A logging truck \r\n  driven by Adams Brothers employee, Dan Little, was stopped directly behind the \r\n  Barnette vehicle.  The light turned green and Voncorie began to proceed through \r\n  the intersection; however, he decelerated believing another vehicle was about \r\n  to enter the intersection.  The logging truck driven by Little collided with \r\n  the Barnette vehicle, having proceeded into the intersection approximately one \r\n  car length.  The Barnettes were transported to the hospital by ambulance where \r\n  they were treated and released.  \r\nBetween March and May 1999, lawsuits \r\n  were filed on behalf of Voncorie, Marlos, and Evelyn Barnette, seeking recovery \r\n  for personal injuries, and a loss of consortium was filed on behalf of Evelynâ€™s \r\n  husband, Willie Barnette. \r\nApproximately one and one-half years \r\n  later, in January 2001, the chief administrative judge orally established a \r\n  date of April 1, 2001, as the close of discovery.  In May 2001, the court found \r\n  that the plaintiffs had failed to timely name five expert witnesses; accordingly, \r\n  it ruled they would not be allowed to testify.  Simultaneously, the court ruled \r\n  Evelyn Barnette would be required to produce Social Security records, and ordered \r\n  the parties to provide pre-trial briefs to Judge Short by June 13, 2001.  \r\nOn July 13, 2001, the circuit court \r\n  issued an order dismissing all of the Barnettesâ€™ complaints.  The order states, \r\n  â€œPlaintiffâ€™s machinations and invidious manipulations of the discovery process \r\n  had, by the time the undersigned became administrative judge for the Sixteenth \r\n  Judicial Circuit, created an extremely hostile environment, consumed an inordinate \r\n  amount of the Courtâ€™s time to the detriment of other litigants in York County, \r\n  and made what should have been a simple wreck case into an administrative nightmare.â€  \r\n  It held the actions of the Barnettesâ€™ attorney â€œmanifest a persistent pattern \r\n  of failing without justification to present his clients for deposition.â€ \r\n  [1]   The court found counselâ€™s direct defiance of its orders and failure \r\n  to cooperate in discovery, justified dismissal of plaintiffsâ€™ claims.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\r\n   1.&nbsp;Did the trial court err \r\n    in excluding the testimony of plaintiffsâ€™ experts?\r\n   2.&nbsp;Did the trial court err \r\n    in dismissing all three cases?\r\n\r\n\r\n 1. EXCLUSION OF EXPERTS\r\n The Barnettes contend the trial court erred in excluding the testimony of \r\n  their five expert witnesses, whom they named in late March 2001.  We agree.\r\n \r\nIn determining the appropriate sanction \r\n  for late disclosure of an expert witness, this Court has stated, â€œit lies within \r\n  the discretion of the trial judge to decide what sanction, if any, should be \r\n  imposed.  The rule is designed to promote decisions on the merits after a full \r\n  and fair hearing, and the sanction of exclusion of a witness should never be \r\n  lightly invoked.  Jackson v. H &amp; S Oil Co., Inc., 263 S.C. 407, 411, \r\n  211 S.E.2d 223, 225 (1975) (quoting Carver v. Salt River Valley Water \r\n  Users' Ass'n., 446 P.2d 492, 496 (Ariz. 1968)).  In Orlando v. Boyd, \r\n  320 S.C. 509, 466 S.E.2d 353 (1996), we addressed the trial courtâ€™s exclusion \r\n  of the plaintiffâ€™s expert witness for failing to abide by a pre-trial scheduling \r\n  date for taking depositions, stating, â€œ[w]hatever sanction is imposed should \r\n  serve to protect the rights of discovery provided by the rules.  A sanction \r\n  of dismissal is too severe if there is no evidence of any intentional misconduct.â€  \r\n  320 S.C. at 511-512, 466 S.E.2d at 355.    \r\nIn Jumper v. Hawkins, 348 \r\n  S.C. 142, 558 S.E.2d 911 (Ct. App. 2001), the Court of Appeals addressed the \r\n  authority of a trial court to exclude the testimony of an expert.  The Jumper \r\n  court held a trial judge is required to consider and evaluate the following \r\n  factors before imposing the sanction of exclusion of a witness: (1) the type \r\n  of witness involved; (2) the content of the evidence emanating from the proffered \r\n  witness; (3) the nature of the failure or neglect or refusal to furnish the \r\n  witness' name; (4) the degree of surprise to the other party, including the \r\n  prior knowledge of the name of the witness;  and (5) the prejudice to the opposing \r\n  party.  348 S.C. at 152, 558 S.E.2d at 916.  \r\nIn the present case, the trial court \r\n  made no specific finding of prejudice to the respondents, other than finding \r\n  the late disclosure would necessitate further discovery.  Moreover, the trial \r\n  court advised the parties that there had been no disobedience of any order of \r\n  the court, and that it had not imposed any sanctions.  Under the facts presented, \r\n  we find the exclusion of plaintiffsâ€™ experts was not warranted.  Accordingly, \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s exclusion of plaintiffsâ€™ experts is reversed.\r\n 2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  DISMISSAL OF PLAINTIFFSâ€™ \r\nCOMPLAINTS \r\nThe Barnettes also assert the trial court erred in dismissing their complaints.  \r\n  As to the actions of Voncorie, Marlos, and Willie Barnette, we agree; as to \r\n  Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s claim, we disagree.\r\n\r\nPursuant to Rule 37(b)(2)(C), SCRCP, \r\n  when a party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, the court \r\n  may â€œmake such orders in regard to the failure as are just,â€ including an order \r\n  dismissing the action or proceeding, or any part thereof.  Accord In \r\n  Re Anonymous Member of South Carolina Bar, 346 S.C. 177, 194, 552 S.E.2d \r\n  10, 18 (2001)(noting that â€œjudges must use their authority to make sure that \r\n  abusive deposition tactics and other forms of discovery abuse do not succeed \r\n  in their ultimate goal:  achieving success through abuse of the discovery rules \r\n  rather than by the rule of law.â€).  The imposition of sanctions is generally \r\n  entrusted to the sound discretion of the trial judge.  Halverson v. Yawn, \r\n  328 S.C. 618, 493 S.E.2d 883 (Ct. App. 1997).  A trial judge's exercise of his \r\n  discretionary powers with respect to sanctions imposed in discovery matters \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent a clear abuse of discretion.  Id.  \r\n  The burden is on the party appealing from the order to demonstrate the trial \r\n  court abused its discretion.  Id.    \r\nAt a May 18, 2001 hearing, counsel \r\n  for Adams Brothers moved to compel Evelyn Barnette to produce her social security \r\n  records, indicating he needed a medical authorization before the Social Security \r\n  Administration (SSA) would release her records. [2]   The court granted the motion from the bench, \r\n  insofar as the records related to Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s position before the SSA.  \r\n  Although the trial courtâ€™s written order, dated May 21, 2001, did not specifically \r\n  order Evelyn Barnette to sign a medical authorization, it did order that the \r\n  defendantâ€™s motion for production of the SS records was granted.  The Barnettes \r\n  filed a timely motion to alter or vacate, which was denied.  On May 30, 2001, \r\n  counsel for Adams Brothers sought clarification of the written order, requesting \r\n  Mrs. Barnette be ordered to sign a medical authorization for her medical records.  \r\n  On June 4, 2001, the court held another hearing, at which it indicated that \r\n  its oral ruling on May 18th was intended as an order for Mrs. Barnette \r\n  to sign a medical release authorization for the SS records.  At the conclusion \r\n  of the hearing, the court orally ordered that the defendants be allowed to take \r\n  the deposition of the social security representative on two days notice. \r\n  [3]   The Barnettesâ€™ attorney filed another motion to alter the courtâ€™s \r\n  June 4th oral rulings, which was denied.  \r\nYet another hearing was held by the \r\n  court on June 11, 2001, when it came to the courtâ€™s attention that the SSA was \r\n  not willing to allow their agent to be deposed without a written consent form \r\n  from Evelyn Barnette.  The court ordered Evelyn sign a release form, and deliver \r\n  it to defense counsel by 1:00 pm on Wednesday, June 13th.  At the hearing, defense \r\n  counsel indicated that the plaintiffs had not yet complied with the courtâ€™s \r\n  oral June 4th order to exchange witness and exhibit lists.   Counsel \r\n  for the plaintiffs responded that he didnâ€™t feel he was bound by the courtâ€™s \r\n  oral orders from the bench, and that he was â€œgoing to have to give it some serious \r\n  thoughtâ€ whether to comply with the courtâ€™s orders, and whether to require Evelyn \r\n  Barnette to sign a consent to release her SS records.  At the conclusion of \r\n  the June 11th hearing, the court stated the plaintiffsâ€™ refusal to \r\n  comply with its orders could result in the following:\r\n\r\n  . . . the imposition of sanctions \r\n    which may result in dismissing the action. . . My view of this matter is that \r\n    if the plaintiff continues to disregard the instructions of this court with \r\n    regard to discovery and getting the matter ready for trial, that it is exercising \r\n    bad faith, willful disobedience to the orders of this court. . . and failure \r\n    to comply by 5:00 pm today (June 11th) may well result in dismissal \r\n    of all three of these cases.\r\n\r\nFurther, the court reiterated that \r\n  Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s authorization to release her SS records must be delivered \r\n  by 1:00 pm Wednesday, June 13th, and that written pre-trial briefs \r\n  must be filed that day as well.  Plaintiffsâ€™ motion to vacate or reconsider \r\n  these rulings was denied.  Mrs. Barnette failed to comply with the courtâ€™s order \r\n  that she sign a medical authorization form.  \r\nThe court issued form orders dismissing \r\n  all three cases on June 14, 2001; a detailed written order was entered on July \r\n  13, 2001.  The Barnetteâ€™s motions to alter or amend were denied.  \r\nGiven Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s persistent \r\n  refusal to comply with the trial courtâ€™s orders, particularly her failure to \r\n  authorize release of her social security records, we find the court acted within \r\n  its discretion in dismissing her action.  In Re Anonymous Member of South \r\n  Carolina Bar, supra.  However, we find the trial courtâ€™s dismissal \r\n  of the remaining complaints was largely premised upon Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s refusal \r\n  to sign the medical authorization form; accordingly, we find that only her case \r\n  should have been dismissed.  Cf. Balloon Plantation v. Head Balloons, \r\n  303 S.C. 152, 399 S.E.2d 439 (Ct.App.1990) (sanction imposed should be aimed \r\n  at the specific misconduct of the party sanctioned).  We find the discovery \r\n  violations pertaining to Marlos and Voncorieâ€™s claims, and to Willie Barnetteâ€™s \r\n  loss of consortium claim, [4]  do not warrant dismissal.  Accordingly, we \r\n  reverse the circuit courtâ€™s dismissal of these claims and remand for further \r\n  proceedings.  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nOn the record before us, we find \r\n  exclusion of plaintiffsâ€™ expert witnesses was not warranted; accordingly, the \r\n  circuit courtâ€™s ruling in this regard is reversed.  We affirm the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal of Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s complaint; however, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  dismissal of the remaining complaints and remand for trial.\r\nAffirmed in part, reversed in \r\n  part, and remanded.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   The cases were initiated in March and May, 1999. \r\n     Despite repeated attempts to depose the Barnettes beginning in July 1999, \r\n    counsel for the plaintiffs persistently refused, contending he wanted further \r\n    discovery from the defendants before allowing his clientsâ€™ depositions to \r\n    go forward.  After numerous hearings, the depositions were finally taken in  \r\n    March 2001.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]    The defense learned in her March 8th \r\n    deposition that Evelyn had sought and been denied SS disability four times, \r\n    claiming that she had been disabled as a result of the accident.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   The court also ruled at the June 4th \r\n    hearing that the parties would be required to exchange witness lists and exhibit \r\n    lists by Friday, June 8th.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   This Court has recognized that a loss of consortium \r\n    claim is not derivative, but is a distinct, independent cause of action.  \r\n    Preer v. Mims, 323 S.C. 516, 476 S.E.2d 472 (1996).  Judgment in favor \r\n    of the defendant in one action is not a bar to the other action.  Graham \r\n    v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984).  Accordingly, the fact \r\n    that Evelyn Barnetteâ€™s claim is dismissed does not bar Willie Barnetteâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25712","title":"Duckson v.

Peeples, Post Conviction \r\n  Relief Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25712\r\nSubmitted March 19, 2003 - Filed September \r\n  8, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDeputy Chief Attorney Joseph L. Savitz, III, of S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, \r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, Chief Deputy Capital &amp; Collateral Litigation Donald J. Zelenka, \r\n  Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard, and Assistant Attorney General \r\n  Elizabeth R. McMahon, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Petitionerâ€™s parole was revoked \r\n  following a hearing at which he was represented by a retained attorney.  Petitioner \r\n  then filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR) alleging, among other \r\n  things, that his parole revocation attorney rendered ineffective assistance \r\n  of counsel.  Following an evidentiary hearing, the PCR judge held:\r\n\r\n  (1)&nbsp; Petitioner had stated no cognizable claim under the Uniform Post \r\n  Conviction Relief Act [1] ; and\r\n  (2)&nbsp; Petitioner failed to prove that his parole revocation counsel was \r\n  ineffective.\r\n\r\nWe granted certiorari, and now affirm.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nHas petitioner stated a cognizable PCR claim?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nIn Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d 742 (2000), \r\n  we held that, generally, PCR is available â€œonly when the applicant mounts \r\n  a collateral attack challenging the validity of his conviction or sentenceâ€¦â€ \r\n  Id. at 367, 527 S.E.2d at 749 (emphasis in original).  The only exceptions \r\n  are that a PCR action may be brought to assert a claim that the applicantâ€™s \r\n  sentence has expired, or that his probation, parole, or conditional release \r\n  has been unlawfully revoked.  Id., citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5).\r\nAt first glance, it would appear that petitionerâ€™s claim of ineffective \r\n  assistance of counsel brings this action within the ambit of Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5).  \r\n  An ineffective assistance claim is premised, however, on the violation of an \r\n  individualâ€™s Sixth Amendment right to counsel.  See, e.g., McKnight \r\n  v. State, 320 S.C. 356, 465 S.E.2d 352 (1995).  No such Sixth Amendment \r\n  right to counsel exists, however, in the context of a parole revocation hearing \r\n  which is an administrative rather than a criminal proceeding. [2]   See In re McCracken, 346 S.C. 87, 551 S.E.2d \r\n  235 (2001) (Sixth Amendment right to the effective assistance of counsel limited \r\n  to criminal actions). [3] \r\nA constitutional right to counsel may arise in a parole revocation proceeding \r\n  by virtue of the Due Process clause. See Gagnon v. Scarpelli, \r\n  411 U.S. 778 (1973).  Further, a state statute permits counsel to appear at \r\n  such a hearing.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-50 (Supp. 2002).  At his parole \r\n  revocation hearing, petitioner was represented by his retained attorney.  Since \r\n  petitionerâ€™s attorney was permitted to appear, and since petitioner does not \r\n  contend that his Due Process rights [4]  were violated, he has failed to allege that his parole \r\n  revocation hearing was â€œunlawful.â€ Petitioner has therefore failed to state \r\n  a claim cognizable in a PCR action.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5).\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the PCR court \r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  WALLER, \r\n  J., concurring in result in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n JUSTICE WALLER:          Because \r\n  I believe petitioner had a right to the effective assistance of counsel at his \r\n  parole revocation hearing, and therefore can bring a post-conviction relief \r\n  (PCR) action, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s reasoning.  However, since petitioner \r\n  failed to establish counselâ€™s ineffectiveness, I concur in result only.\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was convicted of murder in \r\n  1969 and sentenced to life imprisonment.  He was paroled in 1979, went back \r\n  to prison in 1984 because of a parole violation, and was paroled again in 1988.  \r\n\r\nThe instant action stems from his 1999 parole revocation.  \r\n  According to the warrant issued in October 1998 by the Department of Probation, \r\n  Parole and Pardon Services, petitioner violated his parole by failing to report, \r\n  changing his residence at 4063 Charleston Highway, West Columbia, without permission, \r\n  and failing to pay a supervision fee. \r\n  [5]   On April 7, 1999, the Parole Board held a hearing at which petitioner \r\n  was represented by John Watson. [6] \r\n    Petitioner contested the violations, but the Parole Board revoked his \r\n  parole, thereby reinstating his life sentence.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner testified that he \r\n  had a seventh-grade education and worked for steel companies.  He stated he \r\n  had not moved from his Charleston Highway residence and explained that his parole \r\n  agent might have visited his residence while he was in the hospital since he \r\n  was going every day for treatments.  As to his attorneyâ€™s performance at the \r\n  parole revocation hearing, petitioner asserted Watson should have presented \r\n  witness testimony.  He showed that the arrest warrant, which was served on petitioner \r\n  in January 1999, listed the 4063 Charleston Highway address.  In addition, petitioner \r\n  called his sister, Willie Deen Anderson, who testified that petitioner had been \r\n  sick, and before he went back to jail, she drove him to the hospital every day \r\n  for six months.  \r\nWatson testified for the State at the PCR hearing.  \r\n  Watson explained he attempted to convince the Parole Board that:  (1) petitioner \r\n  had not moved from his Charleston Highway residence, (2) any failure to report \r\n  was because petitioner was in the hospital frequently for dialysis treatments, \r\n  and (3) the $100 arrearage had been paid by Watson.  Watson showed the Parole \r\n  Board letters to petitioner at the Charleston Highway address and the receipt \r\n  for the $100 payment.  Watson testified he unsuccessfully attempted to contact \r\n  petitionerâ€™s landlady and that other witnesses, such as petitionerâ€™s former \r\n  wife and his daughter, refused to testify on petitionerâ€™s behalf.\r\nThe PCR court found petitioner had no \r\n  right to counsel at the parole revocation hearing and therefore could not state \r\n  a PCR claim.  Alternatively, the PCR court found that even if petitioner was \r\n  entitled to counsel, he had not shown counsel was ineffective.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAs recognized by the majority, a parolee \r\n  may have a right to counsel at a parole revocation hearing.  See Gagnon \r\n  v. Scarpelli, 411 U.S. 778 (1973).  In Gagnon, the United States \r\n  Supreme Court was faced with the question of whether â€œan indigent probationer \r\n  or parolee has a due process right to be represented by appointed counsel at \r\n  these hearings.â€  Id. at 783.  The Supreme Court started its analysis \r\n  by looking at Morrissey v. Brewer, 408 U.S. 471 (1972), which established \r\n  the minimum requirements of due process for parole revocation.  The Supreme \r\n  Court rejected the argument that because of the rights outlined by Morrissey, \r\n  counsel was unnecessary.  Instead, the Supreme Court noted that â€œthe effectiveness \r\n  of the rights guaranteed by Morrissey may in some circumstances depend \r\n  on the use of skills which the probationer or parolee is unlikely to possess.â€  \r\n  411 U.S. at 786.  The Gagnon Court concluded that the entitlement of \r\n  counsel should be determined on a case-by-case basis.  Giving guidance on how \r\n  courts should make this determination, the Supreme Court stated the following:\r\n\r\n[C]ounsel should be provided in cases where, after being \r\n  informed of his right to request counsel, the probationer or parolee makes such \r\n  a request, based on a timely and colorable claim (i) that he has not committed \r\n  the alleged violation of the conditions upon which he is at liberty; or (ii) \r\n  that, even if the violation is a matter of public record or is uncontested, \r\n  there are substantial reasons which justified or mitigated the violation and \r\n  make revocation inappropriate, and that the reasons are complex or otherwise \r\n  difficult to develop or present.  In passing on a request for the appointment \r\n  of counsel, the responsible agency also should consider, especially in doubtful \r\n  cases, whether the probationer appears to be capable of speaking effectively \r\n  for himself.\r\n\r\n411 U.S. at 790-91.\r\nThis Court has not had the occasion to address \r\n  whether a parolee is entitled to counsel at a parole revocation hearing.  However, \r\n  the Court has held that at a probation revocation hearing, there is a \r\n  right to counsel.  See Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 343 S.E.2d \r\n  620 (1986) (discussing Gagnon, as well as holding that Supreme Court \r\n  Rule 51 [now Rule 602, SCACR] requires that all persons charged with probation \r\n  violations be advised of their right to counsel, and indigent persons be advised \r\n  of their right to court appointed counsel); see also Salley \r\n  v. State, 306 S.C. 213, 215, 410 S.E.2d 921, 922 (1991) (â€œThe right to counsel \r\n  attaches in probation revocation hearings.â€); Huckaby v. State, 305 S.C. \r\n  331, 335, 408 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1991) (â€œall persons charged with probation violations \r\n  must be advised of their right to counselâ€) (citing Barlet, supra).  \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the right to counsel likewise attaches at \r\n  a parole revocation hearing, or at the very least, at those parole revocation \r\n  hearings that meet the guidelines for appointment of counsel laid out by the \r\n  Supreme Court in Gagnon.  See Gagnon, 411 U.S. at 790-91. \r\n  [7] \r\nAs to the instant case, petitioner clearly contested the \r\n  some of the alleged parole violations and offered reasons in mitigation for \r\n  others.  In addition, he testified he only has a seventh grade education, which \r\n  presumably would impact his ability to effectively present his case.  Finally, \r\n  it appears from Watsonâ€™s PCR testimony that a certain amount of investigation \r\n  and evidence gathering was required for the hearing, which clearly would have \r\n  been near impossible for petitioner to accomplish since he was incarcerated.  \r\n  Accordingly, given the facts of this case, it is my opinion petitioner clearly \r\n  was entitled to counsel at his parole revocation hearing.  See id. \r\n \r\n\r\nPetitioner makes the very reasonable argument that he was \r\n  entitled to the effective assistance of counsel.  The majority seems \r\n  to contend that a right to counsel grounded in the constitutional principles \r\n  of due process does not guarantee effectiveness of counsel, unlike the same \r\n  right grounded in Sixth Amendment principles.  I disagree.  Certainly, a due \r\n  process right to counsel would be a hollow one if there were no concomitant \r\n  guarantee to an effective attorney.  See, e.g., In re Issac \r\n  J., 6 Cal.Rptr.2d 65, 69 (Cal. Ct. App. 1992) (finding that in appropriate \r\n  cases, there is a due process right to counsel in a termination of parental \r\n  rights proceeding, and â€œ[w]here there is a due process right to counsel, there \r\n  is a concomitant right to the effective assistance of counselâ€); In re Smith, \r\n  573 A.2d 1077 (Pa. Super. 1990) (finding that where juvenile had right to counsel \r\n  in delinquency proceeding, the right obviously was to effective assistance of \r\n  counsel).\r\nTherefore, petitionerâ€™s claim of ineffective assistance of \r\n  parole revocation counsel is cognizable under the PCR statute.  Although petitionerâ€™s \r\n  claim is not a challenge to his conviction or sentence, it is encompassed by \r\n  the claim that his parole was unlawfully revoked -- a claim which is specifically \r\n  authorized by the PCR statute.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5) (2003); \r\n  see also Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 527 S.E.2d \r\n  742 (2000) (where the Court held that PCR is proper only when the applicant \r\n  collaterally attacks the validity of his conviction or sentence; however, a \r\n  non-collateral challenge may be brought pursuant to Â§ 17-27-20(a)(5) which, \r\n  inter alia, specifically allows a PCR claim that parole has been â€œunlawfully \r\n  revokedâ€); Kerr v. State, 345 S.C. 183, 547 S.E.2d 494 (2001) (same). [8] \r\nIn sum, I believe petitioner had a right to counsel at his \r\n  parole revocation hearing pursuant to Gagnon and therefore he has a right \r\n  to assert a PCR claim that counsel was ineffective.  Accordingly, I would reverse \r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s findings on this issue.  Nonetheless, I agree with the PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  alternative finding that counsel in this case was not ineffective.\r\nTo prove ineffective assistance of counsel, a PCR applicant \r\n  must show that:  (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) prejudice \r\n  resulted from the deficient conduct.  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. \r\n  668 (1984); Nichols, supra.  This Court will uphold the PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  findings if there is any evidence of probative value to support them.  Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).\r\nWatsonâ€™s testimony at the PCR hearing clearly supports the \r\n  PCR courtâ€™s ruling that petitioner was not denied his right to effective assistance \r\n  of counsel.  At the parole revocation hearing, Watson presented documentary \r\n  evidence that petitioner resided at the Charleston Highway address and that \r\n  the $100 arrearage had been paid.  Although no witnesses were presented, Watson \r\n  stated he attempted to contact witnesses and have them appear, but was unsuccessful \r\n  in his efforts.  Moreover, Watson presented oral argument to the Parole Board \r\n  as to his personal belief that petitioner lived at the Charleston Highway residence.  \r\n  Unfortunately for petitioner, however, the Parole Board apparently was not persuaded \r\n  by counselâ€™s presentation of petitionerâ€™s case. \r\n  [9] \r\nBecause the PCR courtâ€™s finding that Watson rendered effective \r\n  assistance at the parole revocation hearing is amply supported by the evidence, \r\n  the PCR courtâ€™s denial of relief should be affirmed.  Accordingly, I concur \r\n  in the result reached by the majorityâ€™s opinion.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 through -160 (2003).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  The concurrence would recognize no distinction \r\n    between probation and parole in this context.  Probation is judicially-imposed \r\n    at the time of sentencing:  whether a violation of probationary terms has \r\n    occurred, and if so, the consequences of such a violation, are matters for \r\n    the courts.  See e.g., State v. Crouch, Op. No. 25698 (S.C. \r\n    Sup. Ct. filed August 11, 2003).  On the other hand, the Board of Probation, \r\n    Parole, and Pardon Services determines both parole eligibility and revocations. \r\n    Id.; Brown v. State, 306 S.C. 381, 412 S.E.2d 399 (1991).   \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  The concurring opinion would extend the holding \r\n    of Barlet v. State, 288 S.C. 481, 343 S.E.2d 620 (1986), that all \r\n    individuals have a right to counsel in a probation revocation, to parole \r\n    revocations as well.  See footnote 3, infra.  The Barlet \r\n    decision is grounded in our Rules, and not in the Constitution.  See \r\n    Rule 602 (a), SCACR; see also e.g. Austin v. State, 305 S.C. \r\n    453, 409 S.E.2d  395 (1991) (right to counsel on PCR certiorari by virtue \r\n    of Court rule, not constitution).  While it may be preferable to give all \r\n    inmates facing parole revocation the right to counsel, such a requirement \r\n    is not found in the Constitution or Court rule.  See Ex parte Foster, \r\n    350 S.C. 238, 565 S.E.2d 290 (2002) (â€œThe unnecessary appointment of lawyers \r\n    to serve as counsel or GALs places an undue burden on the lawyers of this \r\n    State. . . . [A] lawyer should not be appointed as counsel for an indigent \r\n    unless the indigent has a right to appointed counsel under the state or federal \r\n    constitution, a statute, a court rule or the case law of this Stateâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  The concurring opinion would engraft the Sixth \r\n    Amendment standard of effective assistance of counsel onto an attorney appointed \r\n    pursuant to the Due Process clause.  In support of this proposition, \r\n    that opinion cites a California Court of Appeals decision, In re Isaac \r\n    J., 6 Cal. Rptr. 2d 65 (Cal. App. 4th Dist. 1992), and an opinion \r\n    from the Superior Court of Pennsylvania, In re Smith, 573 A.2d 1077  \r\n    (Pa. Super. 1990).  In fact, the California Courts of Appeal are divided whether \r\n    parents facing termination of their parental rights are entitled to the effective \r\n    assistance of counsel issue, and the issue has not been resolved by the California \r\n    Supreme Court.  Compare Isaac J., supra with In re \r\n    Ammanda G., 231 Cal.Rptr. 372 (Cal. App. 3rd Dist. 1986).  \r\n    Like Pennsylvania, we have long recognized that juveniles are entitled to \r\n    the effective assistance of counsel in their quasi-criminal proceedings, and \r\n    have judged claims that the standard was not met by the same criteria used \r\n    in adult PCR cases.  See, e.g., Sanders v. State, 281 S.C. 53, \r\n    314 S.E.2d 319 (1984).  Neither of the cases cited convinces us that we should \r\n    transform petitionerâ€™s Sixth Amendment claim into a Due Process claim, \r\n    and thereafter judge that Due Process claim by a Sixth Amendment standard.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  He was $100 in arrears.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  Petitioner retained Watson who had represented petitioner on different \r\n    matters over the years.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  I note the Supreme Court in Gagnon held there was no difference \r\n    between the revocation of parole and the revocation of probation which would \r\n    be relevant to the guarantee of due process.  See Gagnon, 411 \r\n    U.S. at 782 &amp; n.3.  Therefore, given this Courtâ€™s decisions which have \r\n    held that the right of counsel attaches at probation revocation hearings, \r\n    it logically should follow that the same right attaches in the parole setting.  \r\n    Arguably, however, since Barlet relied on Supreme Court Rule 51, the \r\n    predecessor to Rule 602, SCACR, and Rule 602 mentions the right to counsel \r\n    for a probation violation, but is silent as to a parole violation, I hesitate \r\n    to extend the Courtâ€™s Barlet holding to the parole context.  Since \r\n    there appears to be no South Carolina authority supporting the proposition \r\n    that there is a right to counsel at all parole revocation hearings, \r\n    I confine my analysis to the right to counsel pursuant to the law set out \r\n    in Gagnon.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]  In addition, this Court has held, in the probation revocation context, \r\n    that â€œa probationer retains his full Sixth Amendment right to counsel.â€  Huckaby \r\n    v. State, 305 S.C. 331, 335, 408 S.E.2d 242, 244 (1991).  Moreover, in \r\n    Nichols v. State, 308 S.C. 334, 417 S.E.2d 860 (1992), the Court evaluated \r\n    Nicholsâ€™ claim of ineffective assistance of counsel at a probation hearing \r\n    and found counsel had been deficient in his performance and that Nichols had \r\n    been thereby prejudiced.  Again, given the closely related nature of parole \r\n    and probation revocation proceedings, see footnote 3, supra, \r\n    there is South Carolina authority that petitioner may bring this type of PCR \r\n    claim. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [9]  There is evidence in the record supporting the allegations regarding \r\n    petitionerâ€™s failure to report; therefore, the Parole Board had the discretion \r\n    to revoke petitionerâ€™s parole.  See State v. McCray, 222 S.C. \r\n    391, 396, 73 S.E.2d 1, 3 (1952) (â€œRevocation of probation or parole, in whole \r\n    or in part, is the means of enforcement of the conditions of it; and in the \r\n    absence of capricious or arbitrary exercise, the discretion of the revoking \r\n    court will not be disturbedâ€); cf. State v. Proctor, 345 S.C. \r\n    299, 301, 546 S.E.2d 673, 674 (Ct. App. 2001) (the determination to revoke \r\n    probation is reversible only when based on an error of law or a lack of supporting \r\n    evidence renders it arbitrary or capricious).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25713","title":"Toler v.

Templeton, of Elmore &amp; Wall, P.A., of Charleston, for appellant.\r\nPerrin Q. Dargan, III, and Paul E. Sperry, of Robertson &amp; Hollingworth, \r\n  of Charleston, for respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We certified this appeal from the \r\n  Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.  Ball Corporation (appellant) \r\n  appeals the lower courtâ€™s order granting Trident Construction Company, Inc.â€™s \r\n  (respondentâ€™s) motion to compel arbitration.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn January 30, 2001, Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Association (Tolerâ€™s Cove) filed \r\n  a complaint against respondent alleging construction defects resulting from \r\n  work performed to a condominium complex in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina.  \r\n  Respondent filed an answer asserting its right to compel arbitration.\r\nFollowing two inspections of the building to determine the precise \r\n  nature of Tolerâ€™s Coveâ€™s complaints and to identify the subcontractors responsible \r\n  for the work, respondent learned Tolerâ€™s Coveâ€™s allegations focused in part \r\n  on work performed by appellant [1] \r\n   pursuant to its subcontract with respondent to perform stucco repair and \r\n  installation at the project.\r\nAppellantâ€™s subcontract with respondent states on the first page:  \r\n  THIS AGREEMENT SUBJECT TO ARBITRATION UNDER 15-48-10 S.C. CODE OF LAWS.  \r\n  The subcontract also contains the following arbitration provision:\r\n\r\nSECTION 19.  All claims, disputes and other matters in question between the \r\n  Contractor and Subcontractor arising out of or relating to the Contract Documents \r\n  or the breach thereof; shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the \r\n  Construction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.\r\n\r\nOn October 21, 2001, respondent submitted to the court a consent \r\n  order to file a third-party complaint.  On January 3, 2002, respondent filed \r\n  the third-party complaint against appellant once learning the order had been \r\n  filed.  Respondentâ€™s third-party complaint stated:  â€œ[Appellantâ€™s] contract \r\n  contains an arbitration provision that is enforceable under South Carolina law.â€  \r\n  On February 11, 2002, appellant filed its answer to the complaint.  After procuring \r\n  all other partiesâ€™ consents to arbitration except appellantâ€™s, respondent moved \r\n  to compel arbitration on February 21, 2002.  Appellant responded to respondentâ€™s \r\n  written discovery requests that were served four days after that motion.  The \r\n  lower court subsequently granted respondentâ€™s motion to compel arbitration.  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Whether the courtâ€™s order compelling \r\n  arbitration is immediately appealable?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Did the court err by granting the motion to compel \r\n  arbitration?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n       Whether the arbitration clause is unconscionable?\r\n      \r\n  \r\n\r\nI\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe partiesâ€™ agreement, on its face, does not resolve the issue of \r\n  whether the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) or the South Carolina Uniform Arbitration \r\n  Act applies to the arbitration agreement because it does not include a choice \r\n  of law provision.  The lower court, however, took judicial notice of the fact \r\n  the agreement involves interstate commerce.  This finding is the law of the \r\n  case because neither party has taken issue with that finding.  See ML-Lee \r\n  Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, 327 S.C. 238, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  470 (1997) (unappealed ruling is law of the case).  Therefore, the substantive \r\n  law of the FAA applies to the partiesâ€™ arbitration agreement.  See Osteen \r\n  v. T.E. Cuttino Constr. Co., 315 S.C. 422, 434 S.E.2d 281 (1993) (where \r\n  contract involves interstate commerce, state law regarding arbitration is supplanted \r\n  by federal substantive law).  However, we must still determine whether the FAA \r\n  preempts our state procedural rule that an order compelling arbitration is not \r\n  immediately appealable under Heffner v. Destiny, Inc., 321 S.C. 536, \r\n  471 S.E.2d 135 (1995).  \r\nThe courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration is not immediately appealable \r\n  under South Carolina law because Heffner held all orders relating to \r\n  arbitration not mentioned in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-48-200(a) (Supp. 2002) \r\n  [2]  are not immediately appealable. [3] \r\nThe federal policy favoring arbitration, as expressed in the FAA, \r\n  is binding in state courts and supersedes inconsistent state law and statutes \r\n  that invalidate arbitration agreements.  Zabinski v. Bright Acres Assocs., \r\n  346 S.C. 580, 590, 553 S.E.2d 110, 115; Munoz v. Green Tree Financial Corp., \r\n  343 S.C. 531, 539, 542 S.E.2d 360, 363, n.2.  However, the FAA contains no express \r\n  preemptive provision, nor does it reflect a congressional intent to occupy the \r\n  entire field of arbitration.  Volt Information Servs., Inc. v. Board of Trustees \r\n  of Leland Stanford Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 477, 109 S.Ct. 1248, 1255 (1989).  \r\n  The question is whether the state law would undermine the goals and policies \r\n  of the FAA.  Id. at 477-478, 109 S.Ct. at 1255.  There is no federal \r\n  policy favoring arbitration under a certain set of procedural rules and the \r\n  federal policy is simply to ensure the enforceability of private agreements \r\n  to arbitrate.  Id.  See also Zabinski, supra (state procedural \r\n  rules that do not undermine enforceability of otherwise valid contract to arbitrate \r\n  may be deemed to have been incorporated into contract through choice of law \r\n  provisions); Wells v. Chevy Chase Bank, F.S.B., 768 A.2d 620 (Md. 2001) \r\n  (finding general state appeals statute that recognizes order compelling arbitration \r\n  to be appealable not preempted by Â§ 16(b)(2) of the FAA).\r\nWhile the FAA will preempt any state law that completely invalidates \r\n  the partiesâ€™ agreement to arbitrate, see Zabinski, supra, \r\n  in the instant case South Carolina law is not invalidating the arbitration agreement \r\n  or undermining the goals and policies of the FAA.  Instead, the arbitration \r\n  agreement is being enforced by the courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration which \r\n  coincides with the FAAâ€™s policy in favor of arbitration of disputes.  See \r\n  Zabinski, supra; Heffner, supra.\r\nAccordingly, because South Carolinaâ€™s procedural \r\n  rule on appealability of arbitration orders, rather than the FAA rule, is applicable, \r\n  the courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration is not immediately appealable.  Regardless, \r\n  because appellantâ€™s issues are capable of repetition and need to be addressed \r\n  we proceed to a review of those issues.\r\nII\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues respondent waived its right to arbitrate by engaging in the \r\n  litigation process.\r\nIt is generally held that the right to enforce an arbitration clause \r\n  may be waived.  General Equip. &amp; Supply Co., Inc. v. Keller Rigging &amp; \r\n  Constr., SC, Inc., 344 S.C. 553, 544 S.E.2d 643 (Ct. App. 2001).  See \r\n  also Evans v. Accent Manufactured Homes, Inc., 352 S.C. 544, 575 \r\n  S.E.2d 74 (Ct. App. 2003).  In order to establish waiver, a party must show \r\n  prejudice through an undue burden caused by delay in demanding arbitration.  \r\n  General Equip., supra.  Mere inconvenience to an opposing party \r\n  is not sufficient to establish prejudice.  Id.  There is no set rule \r\n  as to what constitutes a waiver of the right to arbitrate; the question depends \r\n  on the facts of each case.  Id.  Furthermore, it is the policy of this \r\n  state to favor arbitration of disputes.  Id.\r\nIn this case, the litigation process had lasted approximately thirteen \r\n  months between the time the initial complaint was filed by Tolerâ€™s Cove and \r\n  the time respondent moved to compel arbitration.  As between respondent and \r\n  appellant, a third-party-defendant, the litigation process had lasted only approximately \r\n  six weeks between the time respondent filed a complaint against appellant and \r\n  the time respondent filed a motion to compel arbitration.  This fact alone does \r\n  not prejudice appellant due to a delay in demanding arbitration.  See \r\n  General Equip., supra (no waiver where party seeking arbitration \r\n  had been involved in litigation for less than eight months).  Cf.  Liberty \r\n  Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 521 S.E.2d 749 (Ct. App. 1999) (waiver \r\n  occurred where party seeking arbitration had been involved in litigation for \r\n  two and one-half years).\r\nFurther, as in General Equip., the discovery that occurred \r\n  was very limited in nature and the parties had not availed themselves of the \r\n  courtâ€™s assistance other than respondentâ€™s request to file a third-party complaint.  \r\n  Respondent had not held any depositions or engaged in extensive discovery requests.  \r\n  Accordingly, respondent did not waive its right to enforce the arbitration clause. \r\n\r\nIII\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues the arbitration clause in the subcontract should be invalidated \r\n  because the arbitration costs are unconscionable given appellant is a defunct \r\n  corporation.  Appellant asserts the arbitration filing fee of $8,500 and the \r\n  case service fee of $2,500 are unconscionable.  Appellant also believes the \r\n  requirement under American Arbitration Association rules that a deposit be made \r\n  in advance of arbitration to cover the arbitration expenses is unconscionable.\r\nAppellant does not have to pay the $8,500 filing fee, instead, respondent, \r\n  as the claimant, is responsible for that fee.  Appellant would only have to \r\n  pay the fee if appellant filed a counterclaim.  Further, the $2,500 case service \r\n  fee is split between the parties, which in this case is five parties.  Appellant \r\n  would be responsible only for $500 of the case service fee.  Also, any advance \r\n  deposit required to cover arbitration expenses would be shared among the parties.  \r\n  Therefore, the costs related to the arbitration do not make the arbitration \r\n  clause unconscionable because they are not so oppressive that no reasonable \r\n  person would make them and no fair and honest person would accept them.  See \r\n  Fanning v. Fritzâ€™s Pontiac-Cadillac-Buick, Inc., 322 S.C. 399, 472 S.E.2d \r\n  242 (1996) (unconscionability is absence of meaningful choice on part of one \r\n  party due to one-sided contract provisions together with terms that are so oppressive \r\n  that no reasonable person would make them and no fair and honest person would \r\n  accept them).\r\nFurther, as the party seeking to invalidate the arbitration agreement \r\n  on the ground that arbitration would be prohibitively expensive, appellant has \r\n  not met its burden of showing the likelihood of incurring such costs.  Green \r\n  Tree,  531 U.S. at 92, 121 S.Ct. at 522.\r\nAccordingly, the lower court did not err by rejecting appellantâ€™s \r\n  argument that the arbitration clause should be invalidated on the basis of unconscionability.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the courtâ€™s order compelling arbitration is \r\n  not immediately appealable.  However, addressing appellantâ€™s issues on appeal, \r\n  we find respondent did not waive its right to enforce the arbitration clause \r\n  in the subcontract and that the clause is not unconscionable.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n&nbsp; TOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.

Â§ 28-2-470 (1991) challenging respondent Jasper Countyâ€™s (Countyâ€™s) \r\n  notice of intent to condemn 1,776 acres of undeveloped land owned by GDOT on \r\n  the Savannah River.  The trial court found GDOTâ€™s challenge without merit.  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\n\r\nThe property to be condemned is presently \r\n  used by GDOT to facilitate dredging activities in the Savannah River Harbor \r\n  under local sponsor agreements with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE).  \r\n  County intends to condemn the land, then lease all but forty acres of it to \r\n  a private stevedoring corporation, SAIT, a subsidiary of Stevedoring Services \r\n  of America, Inc. (SSA). \r\nOn the leased property, SAIT will \r\n  construct in phases a maritime terminal.  The main terminal will occupy 1,000 \r\n  acres, 130 acres will be used for an access road, and 646 acres will be set \r\n  aside for â€œengineering purposesâ€ including dredging disposal.  The terminal \r\n  will handle freight â€œof general public originâ€ and have the capacity to handle \r\n  a half-million shipping containers annually.  It will operate in conjunction \r\n  with a business park County plans to develop on the forty remaining acres of \r\n  the condemned property. \r\nCountyâ€™s lease with SAIT has a ninety-nine-year \r\n  term and is contingent on successful condemnation.  SAIT may sublet the leased \r\n  premises with Countyâ€™s approval.  In lieu of rent, SSA will pay the compensation \r\n  for the condemned property, which County originally offered GDOT in the amount \r\n  of approximately $8.35 million.    \r\nISSUES\r\n \r\n   1. Does the condemnation violate \r\n    the prior public use doctrine?\r\n  2. Is the use for which the property \r\n    is being condemned a public use?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.  Prior public \r\n  use\r\nUnder S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-30(4) (Supp. 2002), a county may â€œexercise powers of eminent \r\n  domain for county purposes except where the land is devoted to a public use.â€  \r\n  In bringing this action, GDOT claimed the property is presently put to public \r\n  use, and therefore not subject to condemnation, because it is encumbered by \r\n  use easements held by the USACE for dredge material containment areas.  In ruling \r\n  for County, the trial court found the dredging activity is merely an indirect \r\n  benefit to the public and not â€œa public use.â€  In the alternative, he found \r\n  Countyâ€™s taking would not destroy the prior public use.  \r\nGenerally, the prior public use doctrine \r\n  is applicable between entities with equally delegated powers of eminent domain.  \r\n  See Florida East Coast Rwy. Co. v. City of Miami, 372 So.2d 152 \r\n  (Fla. App. 1979); Greater Clark County Sch. Corp. v. Pub. Serv. Co., Indiana, \r\n  Inc., 385 N.E.2d 952 (Ind. App. 1979); State v. Union County Park Commâ€™n, \r\n  214 A.2d 446 (N.J. 1965).  The rationale is to prevent condemnation back and \r\n  forth between competing condemnors.  Florida East Coast Rwy. Co., supra; \r\n  Greater Clark County Sch. Corp., supra.  As stated by one court:  \r\n  â€œThe doctrine of prior public use does not clothe the court with power to weigh \r\n  the communal benefit of the proposed use against the present use of property \r\n  sought to be condemned.  It is, rather, a rule of law limited to controversies \r\n  between two [entities] each possessing a delegated, general power of eminent \r\n  domain.â€  Bd. of Educ. of Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 2 v. Pace College, \r\n  276 N.Y.S.2d 162, 165-66 (A.D. 1966).  When the resisting landowner possesses \r\n  no such power, the question does not arise.  Id. \r\n  [1]   \r\nConsistent with this line of cases, \r\n  we conclude the prior public use doctrine should be limited to those cases involving \r\n  competing condemnors.  It is for the condemning entity to determine whether \r\n  privately owned property, although presently used for public benefit, \r\n  should be condemned for a competing public use.  The difficulty of injecting \r\n  the judicial branch into the arena of competing â€œpublic usesâ€ is in fact demonstrated \r\n  by the one case in which this Court attempted to apply the doctrine of prior \r\n  public use.  In Tuomey Hosp. v. City of Sumter, 243 S.C. 544, 134 S.E.2d \r\n  744 (1964), we addressed a condemnation by a municipality whose delegated power \r\n  of eminent domain was subject to an exception for property previously â€œdevoted \r\n  to public use.â€  The property to be condemned was a charitable hospital.  We \r\n  noted the difficulty of defining the term â€œpublic use:â€  mere benefit to the \r\n  public is not enough; the public must have some â€œdefinite and fixed useâ€ that \r\n  is protected by law.  Without deciding whether the use in question actually \r\n  qualified as a â€œpublic use,â€ we found it was a factual issue to be determined \r\n  at trial. [2] \r\nWe hereby overrule Tuomey \r\n  to the extent it allows application of the prior public use doctrine in situations \r\n  other than between entities with equal powers of eminent domain.  Here, although \r\n  GDOT is an arm of a sovereign state, it has no power of eminent domain in South \r\n  Carolina.  Because GDOT is in the posture of a private landowner in this case, \r\n  we decline to apply the doctrine of prior public use.\r\n2.  \r\n  Use for which taken\r\nArticle I, Â§ 13, of our State Constitution \r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n  Except as otherwise provided in \r\n    this Constitution, private property shall not be taken for private use without \r\n    the consent of the owner, nor for public use without just compensation being \r\n    first made therefor.\r\n\r\nGDOT argues the condemnation is unconstitutional \r\n  because the property is being taken for private and not public use.  We agree. [3] \r\nThe trial court held that Countyâ€™s \r\n  lease to SAIT for a marine terminal qualifies as a â€œpublic useâ€ and therefore \r\n  Countyâ€™s taking of GDOTâ€™s property is constitutionally permitted.  He distinguished \r\n  our decision in Karesh v. City Council of City of Charleston, 271 S.C. \r\n  339, 247 S.E.2d 342 (1978), which held unconstitutional the City of Charlestonâ€™s \r\n  condemnation of land to build and then lease a parking facility and convention \r\n  center to a private corporation.  The trial court found the condemnation here \r\n  distinguishable because the public interest is protected by federal law and \r\n  regulation, referencing the lease provisions regarding the application of general \r\n  maritime laws, and by Countyâ€™s control of the premises as landlord.  \r\nKaresh is controlling here.  \r\n  In Karesh, the parking facility was to be made available on reasonable \r\n  demand to all members of the general public with only 10% reserved for the proposed \r\n  convention center.  We found this public interest was not enough in the context \r\n  of a condemnation proceeding because private property rights were being infringed.  \r\n  Our decision in Karesh turned on the fact that the parking garage and \r\n  convention center, which were â€œostensibly public facilities,â€ were to be leased \r\n  long-term to the developer and used as an adjunct to the developerâ€™s own business.  \r\n  The importance of this fact is apparent from our subsequent decision in Goldberg \r\n  v. City Council of City of Charleston, 273 S.C. 140, 254 S.E.2d 803 (1979), \r\n  which addressed a later challenge to the revised project involving the same \r\n  parking garage.  In Goldberg, we summarily found the project no longer \r\n  suffered the same constitutional impediments found in Karesh and was \r\n  valid because the city would now own and operate the parking garage.  General \r\n  regulations governing the lease here and the standard landlord control provisions \r\n  included in the lease do not rise to the level of public control required under \r\n  Karesh.  \r\nFurther, the trial court found the \r\n  projected industrial development and economic benefit to the citizens of the \r\n  county was sufficient to constitute a public use.  Facts introduced at trial \r\n  indicate the majority of Countyâ€™s population have low-paying tourist and service \r\n  industry jobs and 25% live below the poverty line.  The proposed project would \r\n  be valued at approximately $400 million by the time it is completed,  about \r\n  40% of Countyâ€™s current tax base.  Projected tax revenues under a fee-in-lieu \r\n  of tax agreement are between $3.5 and $4 million.  The project would also diversify \r\n  Countyâ€™s job base. \r\nThe cases relied on by the trial \r\n  court in finding economic benefit is a sufficient public use, however, are not \r\n  condemnation cases but tax cases [4]  and bond revenue cases. [5]   The â€œpublic purposeâ€ discussed in these cases \r\n  is not the same as a â€œpublic use,â€ a term that is narrowly defined in the context \r\n  of condemnation proceedings.  Edens v. City of Columbia, 228 S.C. 563, \r\n  573, 91 S.E.2d 280, 283 (1956).  Although the projected economic benefit to \r\n  County is very attractive, it cannot justify condemnation in this case.  As \r\n  stated in Karesh:  â€œHowever attractive the proposed [project], however \r\n  desirable the project from a [government] planning point of view, the use of \r\n  the power of eminent domain for such purposes runs squarely into the right of \r\n  an individual to own property and use it as he pleases.â€  271 S.C. at 344-45, \r\n  247 S.E.2d at 345.  \r\nWe take a restrictive view of the \r\n  power of eminent domain because it is in derogation of the right to acquire, \r\n  possess, and defend property.  Karesh, 271 S.C. at 342, 247 S.E.2d at \r\n  344; see generally 2A Julius L. Sackman &amp; Patrick J. Rohan, Nicholsâ€™ \r\n  The Law of Eminent Domain Â§Â§ 7.02-7.07 (rev. 3d ed. 1990) (discussing broad \r\n  and narrow views of public use).  It is well-settled that the power of eminent \r\n  domain cannot be used to accomplish a project simply because it will benefit \r\n  the public.  As we have previously emphasized:\r\n\r\n  The public use implies possession, \r\n    occupation, and enjoyment of the land by the public at large or by public \r\n    agencies; and the due protection of the rights of private property will preclude \r\n    the government from seizing it in the hands of the owner, and turning it over \r\n    to another on vague grounds of public benefit to spring from a more profitable \r\n    use to which the latter will devote it.\r\n\r\nEdens, \r\n  228 S.C. at 573, 91 S.E.2d at 283.  The involuntary taking of an individualâ€™s \r\n  property by the government is not justified unless the property is taken for \r\n  public use -- a fixed, definite, and enforceable right of use, independent of \r\n  the will of a private lessor of the condemned property.  Karesh, 271 \r\n  S.C. at 344, 247 S.E.2d at 345.  \r\nCountyâ€™s \r\n  proposed marine terminal does not meet our restrictive definition of public \r\n  use.  The private lessor, SAIT, will finance, design, develop, manage, and operate \r\n  the marine terminal.  The terminal itself will be a gated facility with no general \r\n  right of public access; access is limited to those doing business with SAIT.  \r\n  SAIT will have agreements with various steamship lines and will charge them \r\n  per container fees for unloading, storing, and delivering.  The marine terminal \r\n  is considered a â€œpublicâ€ terminal simply because it will serve different steamship \r\n  lines as opposed to a single line or cargo interest.    \r\nWe hold the trial court erred in \r\n  finding the property will be taken for public use and conclude the condemnation \r\n  is therefore unlawful.  In so holding, we emphasize it is the lease arrangement \r\n  in the context of a condemnation that defeats its validity.  We express no opinion \r\n  regarding Countyâ€™s ability to accomplish the project in a different manner. \r\n  [6]   In light of our disposition, we decline to address GDOTâ€™s remaining \r\n  issues.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and \r\n  PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] The doctrine of prior public use, if applicable, does not depend on \r\n    whether the prior use was acquired by condemnation or purchase.  See \r\n    New York Cent. &amp; H. R.R. Co. v. City of Buffalo, 93 N.E. 520 (N.Y. \r\n    1910). \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2] Analyzing a prior public use by evaluating the actual use to which \r\n    the property is put is problematic because the term â€œpublic useâ€ applies in \r\n    two steps of the analysis in condemnation cases:  first, whether there is \r\n    a prior â€œpublic useâ€ which forbids the taking of such land; and second, \r\n    as discussed below, whether the land taken is taken for â€œpublic useâ€ \r\n    as required under our State constitution.  An expansive interpretation of  \r\n    â€œpublic useâ€ under the prior public use prong may restrict condemnation and \r\n    protect certain private property owners whose property use somehow benefits \r\n    the public; conversely, however, such an interpretation results in less \r\n    protection for the majority of property owners when applied in the second \r\n    prong of the analysis -- the purpose for which the land is taken -- by allowing \r\n    the condemning entity to more easily establish a public use to justify the \r\n    condemnation.  This tension is evident in Tuomey where we cited but \r\n    did not strictly apply the definition of â€œpublic useâ€ from earlier cases applying \r\n    the term in the context of the second prong.  E.g., Riley v. Charleston \r\n    Union Station Co., 71 S.C. 457, 51 S.E. 485 (1905).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] An action challenging a condemnation under Â§ 28-2-470 is considered \r\n    one in equity because it essentially seeks to enjoin the condemnation.

The fire \r\n  destroyed the contents and fixtures of the business.  At the time of the fire, \r\n  Dry Cleaners had a fire insurance policy with both defendant Zurich American \r\n  Insurance Co. (Zurich) and defendant Allstate Insurance Co.  \r\nOn July 20, 2001, Dry Cleaners requested that Zurich \r\n  adjust and pay the losses sustained by its customers for clothes left at Dry \r\n  Cleaners which were destroyed by the fire.  Dry Cleaners submitted to Zurich \r\n  proof of loss statements for its contents loss of over $200,000, its leasehold \r\n  improvements loss, and loss of income/business interruption loss.\r\nDefendant GAB Robins North America, Inc. (GAB) \r\n  is a national insurance adjusting company that provides adjusting, investigation, \r\n  claims administration, and information management services to the property/casualty \r\n  insurance industry.  Zurich retained GAB to adjust Dry Cleanersâ€™ claim, and \r\n  GAB in turn assigned defendant R.S. Townsend, a general adjuster licensed by \r\n  the South Carolina Department of Insurance, to adjust the fire claim.  Thus, \r\n  both GAB and Townsend were acting as the agents of Zurich at all relevant times.\r\nIn October 2001, Zurich paid Dry Cleaners a partial \r\n  payment of $25,000 toward its business contents loss.  In December 2001, Zurich \r\n  paid Dry Cleaners $29,796.87, which represented a partial payment for the loss \r\n  related to the customersâ€™ clothing destroyed in the fire.  Through GAB and Townsend, \r\n  Zurich rejected each of Dry Cleanersâ€™ sworn proof of loss statements.  Except \r\n  for the payments recounted above, Zurich has not paid Dry Cleanersâ€™ claims.\r\nIn its amended complaint, Dry Cleaners alleged \r\n  a negligence cause of action against GAB and Townsend.  Specifically, Dry Cleaners \r\n  alleged GAB and Townsend:  (1) owed it a duty of due care; and (2) breached \r\n  their duty by failing to observe industry standards and by failing to exercise \r\n  due care in the adjustment of the fire claim.  Dry Cleaners additionally alleged \r\n  that as a result of GAB and Townsendâ€™s negligence, gross negligence, and recklessness, \r\n  it suffered damages and is entitled to punitive damages.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDry Cleaners argues this Court should \r\n  recognize a duty between the insured and the independent insurance adjuster \r\n  thereby allowing its negligence claim against GAB and Townsend.\r\nIn South Carolina, although the insurer owes the \r\n  insured a duty of good faith and fair dealing, see Nichols v. State \r\n  Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 279 S.C. 336, 306 S.E.2d 616 (1983), [2]  this duty of good faith arising under the contract \r\n  does not extend to a person who is not a party to the insurance contract.  Carolina \r\n  Bank and Trust Co. v. St. Paul Fire and Marine Co., 279 S.C. 576, 310 S.E.2d \r\n  163 (Ct. App. 1983).  Thus, no bad faith claim can be brought against an independent \r\n  adjuster or independent adjusting company.  It is a novel issue in this State \r\n  whether a negligence claim can be brought against an independent adjuster \r\n  or independent adjusting company.  \r\nTo establish a cause of action for negligence, \r\n  a plaintiff must show three elements:  (1) a duty of care owed by the defendant \r\n  to the plaintiff;  (2) a breach of that duty; and (3) damage proximately resulting \r\n  from the breach of duty.  E.g., South Carolina State Ports Auth. v. \r\n  Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., 289 S.C. 373, 346 S.E.2d 324 (1986).  The \r\n  Court must determine, as a matter of law, whether the law recognizes a particular \r\n  duty.  E.g., Steinke v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and \r\n  Regulation, 336 S.C. 373, 387, 520 S.E.2d 142, 149 (1999).  An affirmative \r\n  legal duty to act exists only if created by statute, contract, relationship, \r\n  status, property interest, or some other special circumstance.  Carson v. \r\n  Adgar, 326 S.C. 212, 217, 486 S.E.2d 3, 5 (1997).  Foreseeability of injury, \r\n  in and of itself, does not give rise to a duty.  South Carolina State \r\n  Ports Auth. v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., 289 S.C. at 376, 346 S.E.2d \r\n  at 325.\r\nThere is a split of authority among those state \r\n  jurisdictions that have addressed whether a negligence claim can be brought \r\n  against an independent adjuster.  The majority does not allow this cause of \r\n  action.  See Meineke v. GAB Business Servs., Inc., 991 P.2d 267 \r\n  (Ariz. Ct. App. 1999); Sanchez v. Lindsey Morden Claims Servs., Inc., \r\n  84 Cal.Rptr.2d 799 (Cal. Ct. App. 1999); King v. National Security Fire and \r\n  Cas. Co., 656 So.2d 1338 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 1995); Velastequi v. Exchange \r\n  Ins. Co., 505 N.Y.S.2d 779 (N.Y. Civ. Ct. 1986); Dear v. Scottsdale Ins. \r\n  Co., 947 S.W.2d 908 (Tex. App. 1997); see also Troxell \r\n  v. American States Ins. Co., 596 N.E.2d 921, 925 n.1 (Ind. Ct. App. 1992); \r\n  Wolverton v. Bullock, 35 F.Supp.2d 1278 (D.Kan. 1998).  \r\nSome states, however, have recognized a duty, and \r\n  therefore allow a negligence claim in this context.  See Continental \r\n  Ins. Co. v. Bayless and Roberts, Inc., 608 P.2d 281 (Alaska 1980); Morvay \r\n  v. Hanover Ins. Cos., 506 A.2d 333 (N.H. 1986); Brown v. State Farm Fire \r\n  and Cas. Co., 58 P.3d 217 (Okla. Ct. App. 2002); see also \r\n  Bass v. California Life Ins. Co., 581 So.2d 1087 (Miss. 1991) (allowing \r\n  claim for gross negligence).\r\nIn recognizing a negligence action against investigators \r\n  hired by the insurer, the New Hampshire Supreme Court in Morvay v. Hanover \r\n  Ins. Cos., noted that the investigators â€œwere fully aware that the [insureds] \r\n  could be harmed financially if they performed their investigation in a negligent \r\n  manner and rendered a report to [the insurer] that would cause the company to \r\n  refuse payment.â€  506 A.2d at 335.  This Court, however, has held that foreseeability \r\n  of injury is an insufficient basis for recognizing a duty.  South Carolina \r\n  State Ports Auth. v. Booz-Allen &amp; Hamilton, Inc., supra.\r\nWe decline to recognize a general duty of due care \r\n  from an independent insurance adjuster or insurance adjusting company to the \r\n  insured, and thereby align South Carolina with the majority rule on this issue.  \r\n  See, e.g., Meineke v. GAB Business Servs., Inc., supra; \r\n  Sanchez v. Lindsey Morden Claims Servs., Inc., supra; King \r\n  v. National Security Fire and Cas. Co., supra; Velastequi v. Exchange \r\n  Ins. Co., supra; Dear v. Scottsdale Ins. Co., supra.  \r\n  We note, however, that â€œthe authorized acts of an agent are the acts of the \r\n  principal.â€  ML-Lee Acquisition Fund, L.P. v. Deloitte &amp; Touche, \r\n  327 S.C. 238, 242, 489 S.E.2d 470, 472 (1997).  In addition, a bad faith claim \r\n  against the insurer remains available as a source of recovery for a plaintiff \r\n  such as Dry Cleaners.  Therefore, in a bad faith action against the insurer, \r\n  the acts of the adjuster or adjusting company (agent) may be imputed to the \r\n  insurer (principal).\r\n Accordingly, we answer the first certified question \r\n  in the negative.  As a result, we need not address the second question.\r\nQUESTIONS ANSWERED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The facts are based on the factual findings in the district courtâ€™s \r\n    certification order.  See Rule 228, SCACR.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  In Nichols, we recognized a tort of bad faith against an insurer.  \r\n    Specifically, we held that if an insured can demonstrate bad faith or unreasonable \r\n    action by the insurer in processing a claim under the insurance contract, \r\n    then the insured can recover consequential damages, and the actual damages \r\n    are not limited by the contract.  279 S.C. at 340, 306 S.E.2d at 610.  Furthermore, \r\n    punitive damages can be recovered if the insured can demonstrate the insurerâ€™s \r\n    actions were willful or in reckless disregard of the insuredâ€™s rights.

Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, \r\n          for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n        Marshall Usher Rogol, of Darlington, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The facts, as set forth \r\n  in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI. Criminal Defense Matter\r\nRespondent was appointed to represent a criminal defendant.  The defendant's \r\n  grandmother made several calls to respondent regarding her grandson's case.  \r\n  In response to the calls, respondent sent the defendant's grandmother a letter \r\n  advising her that his retainer fee was not less than $10,000 and asking her \r\n  to contact his office if she was able to assist in payment of the retainer.  \r\n  Subsequent discussions with the defendant's grandmother were limited to a bond \r\n  reduction for the defendant.\r\nRespondent concedes his letter was ill advised, but maintains he relied on \r\n  Rule 602, SCACR, for the proposition that partial payments to appointed attorneys \r\n  are allowed.  Respondent further maintains that he worded the letter so as to \r\n  convey the message that payment for his representation was not mandatory; however, \r\n  he admits the message was misconstrued by the recipient.  Respondent also admits \r\n  that he failed to adequately communicate with the defendant's grandmother regarding \r\n  his appointed role in the representation, his obligations and any obligation \r\n  defendant's grandmother may have had with regard to payment for his legal services \r\n  on behalf of her grandson.\r\nII. Contingency Fee Matter\r\nRespondent was retained, on a contingency fee basis, to represent a client \r\n  who was struck in the head by an object falling from an overhead display at \r\n  a local retail store.  Respondent did not enter into a written fee agreement \r\n  with the client.\r\nAfter meeting with the client, respondent began negotiating with the store's \r\n  insurance carrier.  Respondent eventually received a verbal commitment from \r\n  the insurance carrier for a settlement amount that respondent thought would \r\n  be a fair resolution of the client's personal injury action.  Respondent represents \r\n  that the client's husband was informed of the settlement offer and he was to \r\n  deliver the message to the client.  Respondent acknowledges he did not provide \r\n  the offer to the client by telephone or in writing and he failed to verify that \r\n  the client actually received the settlement offer.  When respondent did not \r\n  receive any instructions from the client, he took no further action on the case.  \r\n  Respondent admits that he failed to follow-up with the client regarding the \r\n  settlement offer and that he allowed the applicable statute of limitations to \r\n  run without taking any steps to protect the client's interests.\r\nIII. Trust Account Matter\r\nRespondent admits that for nearly a year he was not in compliance with the \r\n  financial recordkeeping requirements of Rule 417, SCACR.  Respondent admits \r\n  he commingled his personal funds with client funds that were held in his trust \r\n  account.  Respondent withdrew funds, which belonged to respondent, from the \r\n  trust account to pay employee salaries, other firm related expenses and personal \r\n  expenses.  \r\nRespondent advised Disciplinary Counsel that he opened the trust account with \r\n  $3,000 of his personal funds and that he would periodically add to that &quot;cushion.&quot;  \r\n  Respondent represents that he always maintained a balance in the trust account \r\n  over and above the client funds deposited in the account. \r\nRespondent acknowledges that he was essentially utilizing his trust account \r\n  as a trust account, operating account and personal account.  He further admits \r\n  that he did not maintain client ledger cards as required by Rule 417, SCACR.  \r\n  However, Disciplinary Counsel found no evidence of misappropriation of client \r\n  funds.  In addition, respondent cooperated fully in the investigation of this \r\n  matter.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall \r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide \r\n  by a client's decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall \r\n  consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule \r\n  1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about \r\n  the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); \r\n  Rule 1.4(b) (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary \r\n  to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation); \r\n  Rule 1.5(b) (when the lawyer has not regularly represented a client, the basis \r\n  or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, \r\n  before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation); Rule \r\n  1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold client funds in a separate account and complete \r\n  records of such funds shall be kept by the lawyer); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute) and Rule 7(a)(6) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office \r\n  taken upon admission to practice law in this state). \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  Accordingly, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent \r\n  for his actions.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25717","title":"In the Matter of Michael G.

In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents \r\n  to the sanction of disbarment.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent \r\n  from the practice of law in this state.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent misappropriated approximately \r\n  $30,176.65 in trust funds for his own personal use and, on at least one occasion, \r\n  was dishonest in explaining how the funds were used.  Respondent also forged \r\n  signatures of payees on several checks, thereafter converting the funds to his \r\n  own use.

Richardson, Jr., \r\n          and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary \r\n          Counsel.\r\n        Michael E. Atwater, of Columbia, \r\n          Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney \r\n  disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel have \r\n  entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents \r\n  to the imposition of any sanction set forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\n  \r\nRespondent has also filed a motion \r\n  asking the Court to allow him to supplement the record with an affidavit in \r\n  mitigation and to allow him to personally appear before the Court regarding \r\n  the agreement or, in the alternative, to remand the matter to the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct for further review of the agreement in light of his affidavit \r\n  in mitigation.  We deny respondent's request for oral argument as well as his \r\n  request to remand the matter to the Commission; however, we grant his request \r\n  to supplement the record with the affidavit in mitigation and the affidavit \r\n  has been considered in reaching the decision set forth herein.  \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent and, in light of the information set forth in the affidavit in mitigation, \r\n  issue a public reprimand.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as \r\n  follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI. Lack of Written Fee Agreement \r\n  \r\nRespondent entered into a verbal \r\n  contract to represent a client in a medical malpractice action.  Respondent \r\n  contacted the client's former attorney and obtained the balance of the client's \r\n  retainer as well as the client's file.  Respondent initiated and eventually \r\n  settled the medical malpractice action without ever obtaining a written fee \r\n  agreement with the client.  Respondent maintains he mailed several fee agreements \r\n  to the client which the client never signed and returned.  \r\nAs a result of a disagreement over \r\n  respondent's legal fee, the client contacted the Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  to initiate a disciplinary complaint against respondent.  Respondent failed \r\n  to respond to requests by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel for information \r\n  regarding respondent's representation of the client.  \r\nRespondent admits that he failed \r\n  to obtain a written fee agreement with the client and that he did not have anything \r\n  in writing that outlined the method pursuant to which the fee was to be determined.  \r\n  Respondent admits that his fee was to be contingent upon the outcome of the \r\n  matter.\r\nHowever, in mitigation, respondent \r\n  states the client's former attorney, over a period of four years, had failed \r\n  to actively pursue the medical malpractice claim because he considered the claim \r\n  to be dubious.  After the client transferred his file to respondent, respondent \r\n  was able to obtain new evidence, amend the claim and resolve it in the client's \r\n  favor and with the client's blessing.  While respondent was unable to locate \r\n  a signed fee agreement, he maintains there was evidence that such an agreement \r\n  was sent to the client to be signed and returned.  Respondent maintains the \r\n  signed agreement could have been returned to the client along with other documents \r\n  at the conclusion of the case.  Respondent points out, however, that there is \r\n  ample evidence in the client file that the client transferred the file to respondent \r\n  for litigation, that the client hired respondent's firm to pursue a matter in \r\n  which the fee is controlled by federal statute, that the client communicated \r\n  with respondent throughout the entire process, including settlement and disbursement, \r\n  and the client signed a general power of attorney giving respondent the authority \r\n  to handle the client's legal matters while the client was overseas with the \r\n  military. \r\nII. Conflict of Interest\r\nPrior to respondent's admission to \r\n  the South Carolina Bar, he was employed as a paralegal in a law firm.  While \r\n  employed as a paralegal, respondent assisted an attorney in the formation of \r\n  a corporation for a college friend (Husband) and the friend's wife (Wife).  \r\n  After being admitted to the South Carolina Bar, respondent represented Wife \r\n  and her son with regard to several traffic violations.  \r\nIn 1999, respondent was retained \r\n  by Husband to pursue a divorce action against Wife.  Wife's counsel filed a \r\n  motion seeking respondent's disqualification.  The trial court, in its order \r\n  granting the motion, recognized that the corporation was to be equitably divided \r\n  and would more than likely be a contested issue at trial.  The trial court was \r\n  concerned about the possible conflict of interest that could result from respondent's \r\n  representation of Husband as well as the possibility that respondent could be \r\n  called as a witness.\r\nFollowing the issuance of the order, \r\n  Wife contacted the Office of Disciplinary Counsel to initiate a disciplinary \r\n  complaint against respondent.  Respondent failed to respond to requests by the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel for information regarding respondent's representation \r\n  of Husband.  \r\nRespondent admits that undertaking \r\n  representation of Husband was an error in judgment.  He also admits he failed \r\n  to respond to inquiries made by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel and that \r\n  he did not initially cooperate in the investigation being conducted by the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nHowever, in mitigation, respondent \r\n  states that Wife's complaint was raised long after he had been involved in representation \r\n  of Husband and in retaliation for the aggressive manner in which he represented \r\n  Husband.  Respondent maintains Wife's attorneys litigated the case without objection \r\n  to respondent representing Husband and even negotiated with respondent over \r\n  a period of time in an attempt to settle the matters in dispute.  Respondent \r\n  contends there would have never been a complaint about his representation of \r\n  Husband if the matters had been settled as Wife and her counsel desired.  Respondent \r\n  also contends the family court order specifically stated there was no evidence \r\n  of a conflict of interest in his representation of Husband.  He states that \r\n  although Wife's complaint alleged he was a possible witness, he was never called \r\n  as a witness because Wife's assertions that respondent could be a witness were \r\n  not true.\r\nIII. Failure to Respond to \r\n  Summary Judgment Motion\r\nRespondent was retained to pursue \r\n  a medical malpractice action on behalf of a client.  Respondent failed to respond \r\n  to the defendants' motions for summary judgment thereby failing to provide the \r\n  court with evidence in support of his client's claims.\r\nRespondent, in mitigation, states \r\n  that he did an immense amount of work on this case, taking over twenty depositions, \r\n  including the depositions of five experts, traveled more than 10,000 miles in \r\n  the process of discovery and spent more than $10,000 in uncovered expenses.  \r\n  He states he spent hundreds of hours preparing the case for trial.\r\nRespondent states that the week he \r\n  received the motion for summary judgment was the same week his wife left him. [1]   He states that on a daily basis he was faced \r\n  with issues involving his house and his children.  He explained his circumstances \r\n  and the resultant emotional upheaval in a letter to Judge Shedd and asked for \r\n  an extension of time in which to respond to the summary judgment motion.  Respondent \r\n  maintains he spoke with Judge Shedd's law clerk who told respondent to let Judge \r\n  Shedd know the amount of time he needed to prepare a response to the motion.  \r\n  Respondent continued to work on his response, but ten days later received an \r\n  order granting the motion for summary judgment.  Respondent telephoned Judge \r\n  Shedd's law clerk who recommended respondent contact opposing counsel and ask \r\n  if they would consent to have the order withdrawn, otherwise, Judge Shedd would \r\n  not reverse his decision.  Respondent contacted opposing counsel but they would \r\n  not consent to having the order withdrawn and proceeding with a hearing on the \r\n  summary judgment motion.\r\nRespondent represents that his client \r\n  has been made whole by respondent's malpractice insurance carrier.  In addition, \r\n  respondent has since successfully represented and is currently representing \r\n  members of the client's family in other unrelated litigation.    \r\nIV. Letter in Support of Affidavit \r\n  in Mitigation\r\nIn an attempt to resolve the first \r\n  two matters addressed in this opinion, respondent entered into an Agreement \r\n  for Discipline by Consent on August 20, 2001.  In support of the agreement, \r\n  respondent provided the Commission on Lawyer Conduct and this Court with an \r\n  affidavit in mitigation.  Attached to the affidavit was a letter that appeared, \r\n  on its face, to be written and signed by respondent's former law partner (Partner).  \r\n  However, respondent signed Partner's name to the letter.\r\nRespondent and Partner both admit \r\n  that respondent contacted Partner regarding a letter to be submitted to the \r\n  Commission and that they agreed respondent would provide Partner with a proposed \r\n  draft of the letter.  Partner was to review the letter and mail it to the Commission.  \r\n  However, due to time constraints, respondent had Partner's permission to execute \r\n  the letter on his behalf at the time of submission.  Respondent admits, in retrospect, \r\n  that this method of executing the letter was improper or, at the very least, \r\n  misleading.\r\nContemporaneous with the approval \r\n  of the agreement by this Court, but prior to the implementation of a sanction, \r\n  respondent advised the Office of Disciplinary Counsel that respondent affixed \r\n  Partner's signature to a letter included in the mitigation materials submitted \r\n  to this Court.  At the time, respondent was unaware of the Court's actions in \r\n  approving the agreement.\r\nRespondent, in mitigation, maintains \r\n  Partner's allegation is unfair and was made at a time when respondent was suing \r\n  Partner.  Respondent contends Partner has changed his story in conversations \r\n  with Disciplinary Counsel.  Respondent states that the fact that Partner could \r\n  offer to write a letter on respondent's behalf, instruct respondent to execute \r\n  it for him, and subsequently place respondent in jeopardy for having done so \r\n  is still hard for respondent to accept or comprehend.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct \r\n  he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation \r\n  to a client); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness \r\n  in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the \r\n  extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions \r\n  regarding the representation, keep the client reasonably informed about the \r\n  status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); \r\n  Rule 1.5(b) (when a lawyer has not regularly represented a client, the basis \r\n  or rate of the fee shall be communicated to the client, preferably in writing, \r\n  before or within a reasonable time after commencing the representation); Rule \r\n  1.5(c) (a contingent fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method \r\n  by which the fee is to be determined and upon conclusion of the matter the lawyer \r\n  shall provide the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the \r\n  matter, the remittance to the client, if there is a recovery, and the method \r\n  of its determination); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite \r\n  litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 3.3(a) (a lawyer \r\n  shall not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a tribunal \r\n  or offer evidence the lawyer knows to be false); Rule 3.7 (a lawyer shall not \r\n  act as an advocate at a trial in which the lawyer is likely to be a necessary \r\n  witness except under limited circumstances); Rule 8.1 (a lawyer in connection \r\n  with a disciplinary matter shall not knowingly make a false statement of material \r\n  fact, fail to disclose a fact necessary to correct a misapprehension known by \r\n  the person to have arisen in the matter or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful \r\n  demand for information from a disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule \r\n  8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving \r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration \r\n  of justice).\r\nRespondent's misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary \r\n  authority including a request for a response); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute); and \r\n  Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\nConclusion\r\n We find, after consideration of \r\n  the mitigating circumstances, that respondent's misconduct warrants a public \r\n  reprimand.  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and \r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his actions.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent states that the matters discussed in \r\n    sections I and II of this opinion also arose at the time he was going through \r\n    the emotional upheaval of an unwanted divorce, property division and a child \r\n    custody battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25719","title":"Payne v.

Zelenka, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Allen Bullard, all \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: Petitioner, \r\n  Geoffrey Payne (â€œPayneâ€) asserts that his counsel was ineffective for failing \r\n  to object to counsel for co-defendantâ€™s comment on Payneâ€™s right not to testify.   \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural History\r\nGeoffrey Payne (â€œPayneâ€) was convicted \r\n  of murder and criminal conspiracy, \r\n  [1]  and this Court affirmed his convictions on direct appeal.  State \r\n  v. Payne, Op. No. 98-MO-008 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed January 26, 1998).  Payne \r\n  applied for post-conviction (â€œPCRâ€) relief, which was dismissed.  Payneâ€™s counsel \r\n  petitioned for a writ of certiorari requesting to be relieved as counsel.  Johnson \r\n  v. State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d 201 (1988).  The petition was denied, \r\n  and the Court ordered rebriefing, and later granted certiorari on the following \r\n  issue:\r\n\r\nWas Payneâ€™s counsel ineffective for failing to object \r\n  to counsel for the co-defendantâ€™s comment on Payneâ€™s right to remain silent \r\n  during the closing argument?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPayne asserts that his counsel was ineffective \r\n  for failing to object to his co-defendantâ€™s counselâ€™s statement about his right \r\n  to remain silent.  We disagree.  \r\nIn his closing argument, \r\n  Kelseyâ€™s attorney, Douglas S. Strickler (â€œStricklerâ€), stated to the jury,\r\n\r\nSo I will talk with you a little about what I had to say \r\n  at the start; and thatâ€™s that he would go ahead and confess to what he is guilty \r\n  of, what he has done.  What did Mr. Breibart tell you at the start?  Thatâ€™s \r\n  [Payneâ€™s] attorney.  \r\n  Iâ€™ve got to bring that up because yesterday you heard nothing \r\n  but Joe Kelsey because Joe wanted and was willing to sit right there and \r\n  look yâ€™all in your eyes and tell you the answer to the only questions that matter, \r\n  not whether he remembered seeing blood when he talked about it at one point \r\n  and didnâ€™t remember it another time or whether, you know, there is a two-inch \r\n  difference in the size of the pipe bomb.\r\n  He talked with you about the only questions that matter in \r\n  this case, and there has never been anything to say from the moment he sat down \r\n  and gave his statement to the police - - which he brought to your attention \r\n  and which he testified to and which the State makes no claim that he testified \r\n  inconsistently with.  \r\n  He has said consistently that she was killed in the back \r\n  seat by [Payne] . . . . \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).  Payne alleges \r\n  that Stricklerâ€™s statement concerning Kelseyâ€™s willingness to testify, and his \r\n  indirect reference to the fact that Payne did not testify, infringed on his \r\n  constitutional right to remain silent.  Thus, he alleges that his counsel was \r\n  ineffective for failing to object to the comment.\r\nIn order to prove ineffectiveness \r\n  of counsel, Payne must prove that his counselâ€™s performance was deficient and \r\n  that the deficiency prejudiced the outcome of the trial.  Strickland v. Washington, \r\n  466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984); Gallman v. State, 307 S.C. 273, \r\n  414 S.E.2d 780 (1992). \r\n The state may not directly \r\n  or indirectly comment on the defendantâ€™s right to remain silent.  State v. \r\n  Johnson, 293 S.C. 321, 360 S.E.2d 317 (1987).  Further, a co-defendantâ€™s \r\n  counsel is held to the same standard because the importance of this protection \r\n  is the effect an indirect reference may have upon the jury regardless of whose \r\n  counsel made the reference.  State v. Green, 269 S.C. 623, 239 S.E.2d \r\n  646 (1977).  \r\nThe PCR judge found \r\n  that Stricklerâ€™s comment did not indirectly reflect on Payneâ€™s right not to \r\n  testify.  We disagree.  In our view, Stricklerâ€™s comment, â€œyou heard nothing \r\n  but Joe Kelsey because Joe wanted and was willing to sit right up there and \r\n  look yâ€™all in your eyes and tell you the answer to the only questions that matter,â€ \r\n  does indirectly refer to the fact that Payne elected to remain silent.  \r\n  Accordingly, we believe that Strickler inappropriately commented on Payneâ€™s \r\n  constitutional right not to testify, and counsel for Payneâ€™s failure to object \r\n  satisfies the deficiency prong of the Strickland analysis.  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 687, 104 S.Ct .at 2064.  \r\nBut Stricklandâ€™s \r\n  prejudice prong is not satisfied because there was overwhelming evidence that \r\n  Payne murdered the victim.  Id; See also Gill v. State, 346 S.C. 209, \r\n  552 S.E.2d 26 (2001) (â€œimproper comments on a defendant's failure to testify \r\n  do not automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant.â€)   \r\n\r\n Both Kelsey and co-defendant \r\n  Jammie Lee (â€œLeeâ€) testified that Payne strangled the victim.  Lee testified \r\n  that Payne hit the victim twice on the head with a wrench.  After Payne strangled \r\n  the victim, Lee testified that the victim was still alive, and Kelsey testified \r\n  that the victim was dead.  Both Lee and Kelsey testified that Payne had sexual \r\n  intercourse with the victim, attempted to remove the victim from the vehicle \r\n  and take her into the woods.  Lee and Kelsey helped take the victim into the \r\n  woods.  Kelsey testified that he placed the pipe bomb in the victimâ€™s mouth \r\n  and that Payne lit the fuse with a lighter.  Lee testified that Payne threw \r\n  the lighter on the dashboard of his car.   Whether the victim died by Payne \r\n  strangling her to death, or by Payne lighting the fuse of the pipe bomb that \r\n  exploded in her mouth, the testimony overwhelmingly proves that Payne murdered \r\n  her.  Therefore, we hold that Payne was not prejudiced by his counselâ€™s failure \r\n  to object to Stricklerâ€™s reference to Payneâ€™s refusal to testify.  \r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the reasoning above, \r\n  we AFFIRM the PCR judgeâ€™s determination that Payneâ€™s counsel was not \r\n  ineffective for failing to object to Stricklerâ€™s comment on Payneâ€™s right to \r\n  remain silent.  \r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I concur in the result, but write separately because, \r\n  in my opinion, the PCR judge correctly found that attorney Strickler did not \r\n  impermissibly comment on petitionerâ€™s exercise of his Fifth Amendment privilege \r\n  to remain silent.  He therefore found that petitionerâ€™s counsel \r\n  was not ineffective in failing to object.  I agree with the PCR judgeâ€™s analysis, \r\n  and agree with the majority that we should affirm.\r\nIn State v. Green, 269 S.C. 623, 239 S.E.2d 646 (1977), the \r\n  Court was faced with the claim that the trial court erred in denying appellantsâ€™ \r\n  motion for a severance.  At trial, appellants had sought either a severance, \r\n  or the right to comment on a codefendantâ€™s refusal to take the stand. The Court \r\n  held that the trial court committed no error in refusing to permit the appellants \r\n  to comment on the codefendantâ€™s refusal to take the stand, and cited with approval \r\n  to a Fifth Circuit decision [2]  \r\n  which held that a comment on an accusedâ€™s silence is improper whether made by \r\n  a codefendant, by the prosecutor, or by the judge. Id.  The Court acknowledged \r\n  that in situations where an attorney must, in order to fulfill his duty to his \r\n  client, call attention to a codefendantâ€™s silence, a severance was warranted.  \r\n  In Green, no severance was required because the appellants and the codefendant \r\n  did not have antagonistic defenses and therefore the appellants were not prejudiced \r\n  by their inability to comment on the codefendantâ€™s refusal to take the stand.\r\nViewing Green in context as a severance case, I am not as \r\n  confident as the majority that it should be read to hold that the same, if not \r\n  stricter, proscriptions on references to a defendantâ€™s silence apply to codefendantsâ€™ \r\n  attorneys as to judges and prosecutors. [3]   In my opinion, we should recognize that an attorney, in the \r\n  course of zealously representing his client, must emphasize the facts that place \r\n  his client in the best light.  I would adopt a test similar to that used in \r\n  the Eighth Circuit and in the Eleventh Circuit when reviewing allegedly \r\n  improper comments made by a codefendantâ€™s attorney:  whether the attorney manifestly \r\n  intended to refer to the defendantâ€™s silence or whether the comment was of such \r\n  a nature that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it as a reference \r\n  to the defendantâ€™s silence?  See e.g., United States v. Jackson, \r\n  64 F.3d 1213 (8th Cir. 1995).  In other words, we should ask whether \r\n  the comments actually or implicitly invited the jury to infer the defendantâ€™s \r\n  guilt from his silence.  See e.g., United States v. Mena, 863 \r\n  F.2d 1522 (11th Cir. 1989).\r\nIn the present case petitioner and his codefendant (Kelsey) presented \r\n  antagonistic defenses in which each blamed the other for killing the victim.  \r\n  Petitionerâ€™s attorneyâ€™s (Breibartâ€™s) pretrial motion to sever \r\n  the cases was denied, as were his repeated requests for a severance and/or a \r\n  mistrial during the proceedings.  During opening statements, Strickler acknowledged \r\n  Kelseyâ€™s guilt of two of the charges, possession of a pipe bomb and desecration \r\n  of human remains, but denied that his client had murdered the victim or conspired \r\n  with petitioner to commit the murder.  During Breibartâ€™s opening statement, \r\n  he criticized Stricklerâ€™s acknowledgment of Kelseyâ€™s culpability, but told the \r\n  jury that Kelsey had confessed to all the crimes. \r\nKelsey testified, and admitted his guilt of the charges \r\n  other than conspiracy and murder: petitioner did not testify.  A third youth \r\n  involved in the crimes testified for the State; he had initially identified \r\n  Kelsey as the perpetrator, but in later statements and in his trial testimony \r\n  he identified petitioner as the responsible individual.\r\nDuring the closing argument, Strickler said:\r\n\r\nSo I will talk with you a little bit about what I had to \r\n  say at the start; and thatâ€™s that [Kelsey] would go ahead and confess to what \r\n  he is guilty of, what he has done.  What did Mr. Breibart tell you at the start?  \r\n  Thatâ€™s [petitionerâ€™s] attorney.\r\nIâ€™ve got to bring that up because yesterday you heard nothing but [Kelsey] because \r\n  [he] wanted and was willing to sit right up there and look yâ€™all in your eyes \r\n  and tell you the answer to the only questions that matterâ€¦\r\nHe talked with you about only the questions that matter in this case, and there \r\n  has never been anything to say from the moment he sat down and gave his statement \r\n  to the police - which he brought to your attention and which the State makes \r\n  no claim that he has testified inconsistently with.\r\nHe has said consistently that [the victim] was killed in the back seat by [petitioner]â€¦.\r\n\r\nThere was no objection to this argument.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, petitioner complained that Stricklerâ€™s argument \r\n  referring to Kelseyâ€™s testimony impermissibly singled out petitionerâ€™s failure \r\n  to testify.  When Breibart was asked at the hearing why he did not object, \r\n  he said that he felt highlighting Kelseyâ€™s trial testimony was favorable to \r\n  the petitioner since Kelsey had essentially confessed to murder, just as Breibart \r\n  had predicted in his opening statement.  Breibart testified that he felt \r\n  Stricklerâ€™s closing argument was not a comment on petitionerâ€™s silence, but \r\n  was instead intended to emphasize Kelseyâ€™s self-damaging trial testimony.\r\nThe PCR judge held that Breibart was not ineffective in failing \r\n  to object to Stricklerâ€™s closing argument because, viewed in context, the argument \r\n  was not an improper comment on petitionerâ€™s right to remain silent.  We must \r\n  uphold this finding if supported by any probative evidence in the record.  Jackson \r\n  v. State, Op. No. 25678 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 21, 2003).  In my opinion, \r\n  there is evidence to support the finding that Breibartâ€™s strategic decision \r\n  not to object was reasonable since the argument, viewed in context, was helpful \r\n  to his clientâ€™s position.  See e.g. Legare v. State, 333 S.C. \r\n  275, 509 S.E.2d 472 (1998) (where counsel articulates valid reason for strategy \r\n  he is not ineffective).  Further, applying the test outlined above, I would \r\n  not find the comments objectionable as actually or implicitly inviting the jury \r\n  to infer petitionerâ€™s guilt from his silence, but rather as Stricklerâ€™s proper \r\n  attempt to highlight the consistency of Kelseyâ€™s story.  See e.g. United \r\n  States v. Jackson, supra (attorney may properly argue his testifying \r\n  clientâ€™s credibility in closing); United States v. McClure, 734 F.2d \r\n  484 (10th Cir. 1984) (testifying codefendantâ€™s attorney may properly \r\n  argue his clientâ€™s willingness to face questioning on stand).\r\nFor these reasons, I would affirm the PCR courtâ€™s order denying petitioner \r\n  relief.  This case highlights one of the problems that arise when codefendants \r\n  have antagonistic defenses but the State nevertheless insists upon a joint trial.  \r\n  The codefendants in this case were placed in the unenviable position of having \r\n  to attack each other while the State played a largely passive role.  Had the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision to deny petitionerâ€™s severance motion been before us, \r\n  I would have been inclined to find reversible error. [4]   State v. Green, supra.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Payneâ€™s co-defendant, Joseph Kelsey (â€œKelseyâ€), \r\n    was also convicted of murder and criminal conspiracy.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  De Luna v. United States, 308 F.2d 140 \r\n    (5th Cir. 1962). \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  I note that federal circuits appear split whether \r\n    a Fifth Amendment violation even occurs when the comment is made by a codefendantâ€™s \r\n    attorney.  Compare, e.g., United States v. Whitley, 734 \r\n    F.2d 1129 (6th Cir. 1984)(no violation) with United States \r\n    v. Patterson, 819 F.2d 1495 (9th Cir. 1987).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  Petitioner took no direct appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25720","title":"Rogers v.

Norfolk Southern Corp., 343 S.C. 52, \r\n  538 S.E.2d 664 (Ct. App. 2000).  We affirm as modified.  \r\nFACTS [1] \r\nNorfolk Southern Corporation (â€œNorfolk Southernâ€), under contract with U.S. \r\n  Silica (â€œSilicaâ€), transports Silicaâ€™s product over spur tracks owned by Silica.  \r\n  Silica runs slurry [2]  through pipes running beneath the spur lines to \r\n  a storage facility.\r\nA slurry pipe ruptured two days before John David Rogersâ€™ \r\n  (â€œRogersâ€) injury.  Silica employees temporarily repaired the pipes, intending \r\n  to replace them at a later date.  Silica did not notify Norfolk Southern of \r\n  the rupture.\r\nOn the day of Rogersâ€™ injury a Norfolk Southern train \r\n  entered the Silica complex on a spur track.  The Norfolk Southern crew, consisting \r\n  of a conductor and an engineer, dismounted from the train for a break. They \r\n  returned to discover a large hole beneath the track estimated to be between \r\n  four to five feet deep and approximately eight to ten feet wide.  The train \r\n  engineer noticed a small stream of clear water at the bottom of the hole, which \r\n  flowed outward from the direction of the Silica plant.  The train conductor \r\n  testified that no exposed pipe was visible in the hole.  The train conductor \r\n  asked Norfolk Southern to inspect the track to ensure the train could traverse \r\n  it safely.  Norfolk Southern sent Rogers, an assistant track supervisor, to \r\n  inspect the hole.                                            \r\nRogers testified that, upon arriving at the site, he \r\n  could see the hole from 150 feet away but could not tell what caused the hole.  \r\n  Rogersâ€™ assistant testified to seeing â€œwet sandâ€ around the hole.  Norfolk Southernâ€™s \r\n  head track inspector testified he knew a hole created by the failure of a water \r\n  line would cause an inspector to be more cautious â€œthan if it had just been \r\n  water washed across the track or water leaking from a low pressure pipe, [because] \r\n  it might cause a concave-type hole under the track rather than one that would \r\n  go straight down.â€\r\nAs Rogers neared the hole, the ground shifted beneath \r\n  him. Rogers jerked backwards to avoid falling and immediately felt pain in his \r\n  back.  Rogers sought medical treatment and was diagnosed with a herniated disc, \r\n  which resulted in pain in his back and his left leg.  Rogers attempted to return \r\n  to work after surgery, but he has work restrictions on lifting, bending, stooping, \r\n  and twenty percent impairment to his lumbar spine.  \r\nRogers filed suit against Norfolk Southern under FELA, \r\n  alleging Norfolk Southern was negligent in failing to provide him with a reasonably \r\n  safe place to work.  Rogers also filed suit against Silica for common law negligence.  \r\n  The jury returned a $3,000,000 verdict against Silica and Norfolk Southern, \r\n  apportioning 30% of the verdict to Norfolk Southern and 70% to Silica.  Following \r\n  the verdict, Norfolk Southernâ€™s motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict \r\n  (JNOV) was denied.  The Court of Appeals reversed.  \r\nISSUES\r\nI.       Did the Court of Appeals err in applying a state standard in reviewing \r\n  a trial courtâ€™s denial of Norfolk Southernâ€™s Motion for JNOV in a case premised \r\n  on federal law?\r\nII.      Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the trial courtâ€™s denial \r\n  of Norfolk Southernâ€™s Motion for JNOV?\r\nI\r\nStandard for JNOV\r\nThe Court of Appeals issued its opinion in this case before we decided Norton \r\n  v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., 350 S.C. 473, 567 S.E.2d 851 (2002) in which \r\n  we held state trial courts hearing a federal claim must review motions for a \r\n  new trial under a federal standard.  In Norton, this Court noted state \r\n  courts have concurrent jurisdiction to hear Federal Employers Liability Act \r\n  (â€œFELAâ€) claims.  See id; 45 U.S.C. Â§Â§ 51, et seq.  \r\n  We further noted a state court trying a FELA action is controlled by federal \r\n  substantive law and state procedural law.  Because a motion for a new trial \r\n  involves questions of the sufficiency of evidence, we held state courts must \r\n  apply federal, not state, standards in reviewing such motions.  Norton v. \r\n  Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., supra.  \r\nA Motion for JNOV [3]  \r\n  requires a court to determine the sufficiency of the evidence.  Therefore, a \r\n  state court presiding over a FELA action must apply federal rules in deciding \r\n  a Motion for JNOV.  Cf. Norton v. Norfolk Southern Ry. Co., supra.\r\nThe Court of Appeals applied the state standard of review and concluded Rogers \r\n  presented no evidence to support the juryâ€™s finding that Norfolk Southern was \r\n  negligent. [4]   The Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by failing to apply the federal standard, applicable to both trial and \r\n  appellate courts, which is:\r\n\r\nthe evidence and all reasonable inferences from it are assessed \r\n  in the light most favorable to the non-moving party . . . and the credibility \r\n  of all evidence favoring the non-moving party is assumed. . . . Assessed in \r\n  this way, the evidence must then be â€˜of such quality and weight that reasonable \r\n  and fair-minded men in the exercise of impartial judgment could reasonably return \r\n  a verdict for the non-moving party. . . .â€™ a â€˜mere scintilla of evidenceâ€™ is \r\n  not sufficient to withstand the challenge.\r\n\r\nCrinkley v. Holiday Inns, 844 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. 1988) \r\n  (internal citations omitted).  In other words, â€œthe test of a jury case is simply \r\n  whether the proofs justify with reason the conclusion that employer negligence \r\n  played any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which \r\n  damages are sought.â€  Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506, \r\n  77 S.Ct. 443, 448, 1 L.Ed.2d 493 (1957) (citation omitted).  However, before \r\n  the case may be properly left to the jury there must be more than a scintilla \r\n  of evidence establishing defendantâ€™s liability.  Brady v. Southern Ry., \r\n  320 U.S. 476, 479, 64 S.Ct. 232, 234, 88 L.Ed. 239 (1943) (â€œthe weight of the \r\n  evidence under ... [FELA] must be more than a scintilla before the case may \r\n  be properly left to the discretion of the trier of fact....â€).  \r\nBoth the state and federal standards require a trial \r\n  judge to view the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.  \r\n  However, under the state standard the trial court should not grant JNOV where \r\n  the evidence yields more than one inference.  An appellate court may not overturn \r\n  the decision of the trial court, under the state standard, if there is any evidence \r\n  to support the trial courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nIn contrast, under the federal standard both the trial and appellate courts \r\n  must ask whether a fair, impartial, and reasonable juror could return a verdict \r\n  for the non-moving party.  To survive the motion the non-moving party must have \r\n  presented more than a scintilla of evidence to establish his claim.  In ruling \r\n  on a Motion for JNOV in a FELA action, a state court must ask whether more than \r\n  a scintilla of evidence was presented which â€œjustify with reason the conclusion \r\n  that employer negligence played any part, even the slightest, in producing the \r\n  injury or death for which damages are sought.â€  Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. \r\n  Co., supra.  \r\nII\r\nNorfolk Southernâ€™s Motion for JNOV\r\nNorfolk Southern has a non-delegable duty to provide Rogers a safe place to \r\n  work, even when Rogers is working on the property of a third party.  See \r\n  Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Trimiew, 480 S.E.2d 104 (Va. 1997); McGraw \r\n  v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., 500 S.E.2d 300 (W. Va. 1997); Schrier \r\n  v. Indiana Harbor Belt R. Co., 430 N.E.2d 204 (Ill. Ct. App. 1981).  Norfolk \r\n  Southernâ€™s duty to provide a safe working environment extends only to foreseeable \r\n  dangers.  Brown v. CSX Transp., Inc., 18 F.3d 245, 248 (4th \r\n  Cir. 1994) (quoting Atlantic Coast Line R. Co. v. Craven, 185 F.2d 176, \r\n  178 (4th Cir. 1950) (â€œAn employer has a duty to provide his employees \r\n  a safe place to work, but this duty cannot be absolute.  Dangers are implicit \r\n  in such occupations as railroading, and railroads are not insurers of their \r\n  employees.â€)); Brown, 18 F.3d at 250 (an employer â€œmay not be held liable \r\n  if it had no reasonable way of knowing that the hazard, which caused [Plaintiffâ€™s] \r\n  injury, existed.â€).  \r\nCongress mandated courts construe FELA provisions liberally in favor of injured \r\n  railroad workers.  Urie v. Thompson, 337 U.S. 163, 69 S.Ct. 1018, 93 \r\n  L.Ed. 1282 (1949).  Although FELA is to be liberally construed, this â€œdoes not \r\n  mean that it is a workersâ€™ compensation statute.  [The U.S. Supreme Court has] \r\n  insisted that FELA â€˜does not make the employer the insurer of the safety of \r\n  his employees while they are on duty.  The basis of his liability is his negligence, \r\n  not the fact that injuries occur.â€™â€ Consolidated Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, \r\n  512 U.S. 532, 543, 114 S.Ct. 2396, 2404 (1994).  An employee may recover under \r\n  FELA only upon proving the employerâ€™s negligence contributed, in whole or in \r\n  part, to the workerâ€™s injury.  See 45 U.S.C. Â§ 51 (a railroad â€œshall \r\n  be liable in damages to any person suffering injury while he is employed by \r\n  such carrier . . . for such injury . . . resulting in whole or in part from \r\n  the negligence of any of the officers, agents or employees of such carrierâ€).  \r\n  Plaintiffs, even under FELA, must prove the traditional common law elements \r\n  of negligence: duty, breach, causation and damages.  See Brown, \r\n  supra. Reasonable foreseeability of harm is essential to a FELA claim.  \r\n  See Brown, 18 F.3d at 249.          \r\nRogers was sent to the track on U.S. Silicaâ€™s premises to inspect the track \r\n  and report any problems or damages found, and advise his supervisors of any \r\n  necessary repairs.  On the day Rogers was injured, Rogers was sent to the track \r\n  specifically to inspect the hole that was discovered by the conductor and engineer.  \r\n  To prevail on a FELA negligence claim, Rogers must prove â€œduty, breach, foreseeability, \r\n  and causation.â€  Adams v. CSX Transp. Inc., 899 F.2d 536, 539 (6th \r\n  Cir. 1990). Norfolk Southern had a duty to provide its employees with a safe \r\n  workplace.   Id. Nevertheless, â€œ[t]he employer is not held to an absolute \r\n  responsibility for the reasonably safe condition of the place, tools and appliances, but only to the duty of exercising reasonable care to \r\n  that end, the degree of care being commensurate with the danger reasonably to \r\n  be anticipated.â€  Isgett v. Seaboard Coast Line R.R. Co., 332 F. Supp. \r\n  1127, 1139 (D.S.C. 1971). \r\nWe fail to see how, in this instance, Norfolk Southern could have been any \r\n  more prudent.  Rogers was Norfolk Southernâ€™s first responder following advisement \r\n  by its employees of the obvious problem at the site.  Rogersâ€™ job was to inspect \r\n  the area around the track and to inform Norfolk Southern of any danger. [5]   We agree with the \r\n  Court of Appeals that Norfolk Southern was not chargeable, prior to Rogersâ€™ \r\n  arrival, with knowledge of the cause of the problem at the site.  Rogers \r\n  v. Norfolk Southern Corp., 343 S.C. 52, 61, 538 S.E.2d 664, 669 (Ct. App. \r\n  2001).  Norfolk Southern was not, therefore, negligent in any particular in \r\n  dispatching Rogers to inspect the site.\r\nThe law does not require that employers be omniscient, only that they exercise \r\n  reasonable care.  Rogers was the agent of Norfolk Southern entrusted with informing \r\n  the company of dangers in the Norfolk Southern workplace. No more than a mere \r\n  scintilla of evidence, if that, was adduced at trial from which the negligence \r\n  of Norfolk Southern could be inferred.  We conclude that a fair, impartial and \r\n  reasonable juror could not have returned a verdict against Norfolk Southern.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals arrived at the correct result as to all allegations of \r\n  negligenceâ€”albeit through application of the incorrect standard.\r\nWe therefore AFFIRM AS MODIFIED the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., and Acting Justice James C. Williams, \r\n  Jr., concur.  BURNETT, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which WALLER, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  I respectfully dissent.  The evidence presented by \r\n  Rogers is more than sufficient to satisfy the federal â€œmore than a mere scintillaâ€ \r\n  standard.                 \r\n\r\nUnder the federal standard, applied alike at trial and on \r\n  review, the evidence and all reasonable inferences from it are assessed in the \r\n  light most favorable to the non-moving party . . . and the credibility of all \r\n  evidence favoring the non-moving party is assumed. . . . Assessed in this way, \r\n  the evidence must then be â€˜of such quality and weight that reasonable and fair-minded \r\n  men in the exercise of impartial judgment could reasonably return a verdict \r\n  for the non-moving party. . . .â€™  A â€˜mere scintilla of evidenceâ€™ is not sufficient \r\n  to withstand the challenge.\r\n\r\nCrinkley v. Holiday Inns, 844 F.2d 156, 160 (4th Cir. 1988) \r\n  (internal citations omitted).  \r\nA scintilla is defined as â€œa traceâ€ of evidence.  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 1347 \r\n  (7th ed. 1999).\r\nThe majority concludes Norfolk Southern was not negligent \r\n  in dispatching Rogers to inspect the site.  I agree.  The mere dispatch of Rogers \r\n  to the site was not negligent.  \r\nIn my opinion, however, Norfolk Southern was negligent \r\n  in failing to provide Rogers with a safe place to work.  As noted by the majority, \r\n  Norfolk Southern had a non-delegable duty to provide Rogers a safe place to \r\n  work, even when Rogers was working on the property of a third party.  See \r\n  Norfolk Southern Ry. Co. v. Trimiew, 480 S.E.2d 104 (Va. 1997); McGraw \r\n  v. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. Co., 500 S.E.2d 300 (W. Va. 1997); Schrier \r\n  v. Indiana Harbor Belt R. Co., 430 N.E.2d 204 (Ill. Ct. App. 1981).   \r\nViewing the testimony and its inferences in the light \r\n  most favorable to Rogers as we are required to do, Norfolk Southern was negligent \r\n  in failing to provide a safe place for Rogers to perform his work.  Norfolk \r\n  Southernâ€™s non-delegable duty required it inspect the premises within the area \r\n  of its responsibility for conditions injurious to its employees.  This duty \r\n  necessarily required it be aware of conditions adjacent to the tracks which \r\n  posed an immediate potential of danger to its employees.  This Norfolk Southern \r\n  failed to do.\r\nThe convex hole created beneath the Norfolk Southern \r\n  tracks resulted from the rupture of slurry pipes which ran beneath the tracks.  \r\n  The pipes were visible going into the ground adjacent to the track and emerging \r\n  from the ground on the opposite side of the track.  Although the installation \r\n  of the pipes was not disclosed to Norfolk Southern, the pipes were not concealed \r\n  from view.  Photographs and witness testimony show the entry of the slurry pipes \r\n  into the ground twenty feet from the spur track.  It was clearly foreseeable \r\n  that a dangerous condition existed adjacent to Norfolk Southernâ€™s tracks.  \r\nIn my opinion, more than a mere scintilla, a trace, \r\n  of evidence was introduced establishing Norfolk Southern knew or, in the exercise \r\n  of ordinary care, should have known the conditions at Silica posed a danger \r\n  to its employees.  Accordingly, under FELA standards, Rogers is entitled to \r\n  prevail.  Rogers v. Missouri Pac. R. Co., 352 U.S. 500, 506 (1957) (under \r\n  FELA, an employee prevails if he establishes â€œthat employer negligence played \r\n  any part, even the slightest, in producing the injury or death for which damages \r\n  are sought.â€).    \r\nThe majority opines no fair, impartial, and reasonable \r\n  juror could have returned a verdict against Norfolk Southern.  The record, however, \r\n  is devoid of evidence the jury which returned the verdict against Norfolk Southern \r\n  was unfair, partial, or unreasonable.  Instead, Rogers presented this jury more \r\n  than a mere scintilla of evidence Norfolk Southern breached its non-delegable \r\n  duty, resulting in injury to him.\r\nI would REVERSE the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nWALLER, J., concurs. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  A more extensive treatment of the facts \r\n    can be found in the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion.  Rogers v. Norfolk Southern \r\n    Corp., 343 S.C. 52, 538 S.E.2d 664 (Ct. App. 2000).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Slurry is an abrasive mixture of sand and water \r\n    that can be pumped through a pipe.  The slurry has a sandblasting effect on \r\n    the pipes causing the pipes to be worn down over time.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   We observe \r\n    that the federal rules do not provide specifically for a Motion for JNOV.  \r\n    The federal rules do allow for a Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law.  \r\n    See Rule 50, FRCP.  As a practical matter South Carolina=s Motion for \r\n    JNOV and the federal Motion for Judgment as a Matter of Law are the same.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   The Court of Appeals wrote the state standard required \r\n    a trial court to:\r\n  view the evidence and the inferences that reasonably can be drawn therefrom \r\n    in the light most favorable to the party opposing the motions.  The trial \r\n    court must deny the motions when the evidence yields more than one inference \r\n    or its inference is in doubt.

Oliver, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25721\r\nHeard June 10, 2003 - Filed September \r\n  29, 2003\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nComing B. Gibbs, Jr., of Charleston, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the Commission on \r\n  Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against respondent Susan Oliver.  Respondent \r\n  filed an answer admitting the charges, but requesting the charges against her \r\n  be dismissed.  After a hearing, the Panel recommended respondent be given a \r\n  public reprimand.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn March 21, 1996, respondent was placed on disability inactive status\r\npursuant to former Rule 413, SCACR. [1]   Prior to being placed on disability inactive \r\n  status, respondent represented a client in a workers compensation matter.  On \r\n  November 30, 1995, a settlement payment, in the amount of $15,498 was received \r\n  on the clientâ€™s behalf.  Of this amount, respondentâ€™s fee and costs were $5,310, \r\n  giving the client a net amount of $10,188.  After respondent took $2,000 cash \r\n  out of the amount, the rest was deposited into respondentâ€™s trust account.  \r\n  Respondent did not timely disburse the proceeds to her client. \r\nDuring December 1995 and January 1996, respondent wrote a series \r\n  of checks on her trust account, payable to â€œcashâ€ and other personal expenses, \r\n  reducing the balance in the trust account to $8,453.69.\r\nRespondent was committed to a mental health facility and remained \r\n  there from January 26, 1996, to March 6, 1996.  After her release, respondent \r\n  obtained funds from family members and the remaining funds in her trust account \r\n  to pay the client.\r\nThe Panel found respondent misappropriated approximately $1,734.31 \r\n  from the client, and at the time these misappropriations occurred, respondent \r\n  was suffering from the symptoms of her bipolar disorder. [2] \r\nPanelâ€™s Findings\r\nThe Panel found that respondent has committed the following violations \r\n  from Paragraph 5 of the Rule on Disciplinary Procedure, former Rule 413, SCACR:  \r\n  (1) violation of the oath of office taken upon admission to practice law, (2) \r\n  violation of a rule of professional conduct, (3) conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or bring the courts or legal profession into disrepute \r\n  or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law, and (4) conduct in violation \r\n  of the Rules on Trust Accounts of Attorneys.  The Panel further found that respondent \r\n  has violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  (1) Rule 1.1, competence; (2) Rule 1.3, diligence; (3) Rule 1.4, communication; \r\n  (4) Rule 1.15 safekeeping of property; and (5) Rule 8.4, misconduct.\r\nWhen determining how to discipline respondent, the Panel noted that \r\n  in severe cases this Court has refused to accept impairment as an excuse or \r\n  defense to a charge of misconduct.  However, the Panel noted that in this case, \r\n  the misappropriation occurred over a very short period of time, was relatively \r\n  minor, and was immediately repaid by respondent upon her release from the hospital.  \r\n  The Panel was impressed with respondentâ€™s honesty and desire for rehabilitation \r\n  and was convinced that respondentâ€™s failings did not represent a willingness \r\n  to allow wrongdoing, but were the result of a single, isolated incident of mental \r\n  illness.  The Panel, therefore, recommended respondent be publicly reprimanded.  \r\n  The Panel noted respondent would remain on disability inactive status until \r\n  further order of this Court.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  The authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which discipline is \r\n  given rests entirely with the Supreme Court.  In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, \r\n  551 S.E.2d 586 (2001).  The Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law, and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation.  In re Larkin, \r\n  336 S.C. 366, 520 S.E.2d 804 (1999).  The Court must administer the sanction \r\n  it deems appropriate after a thorough review of the record.  Id.\r\nIn a similar case involving misappropriation and subsequent \r\n  reimbursement by a lawyer suffering bipolar disorder, we ordered a two-year \r\n  retroactive suspension.  In re Howle, 294 S.C. 244, 363 S.E.2d 693 (1988).  \r\n  In another case, we ordered a thirty-day suspension for similar misconduct and \r\n  placed the attorney on disability inactive status.  In re Holler, 329 \r\n  S.C. 395, 496 S.E. 2d 627 (1998).\r\nRespondentâ€™s conduct warrants a serious sanction.  However, we conclude \r\n  a six-month definite suspension is the appropriate sanction given the misappropriation \r\n  occurred over a short period of time, was relatively minor, and was immediately \r\n  repaid by respondent upon her release from the hospital.\r\nAccordingly, we definitely suspend respondent for six months, retroactive \r\n  to the date respondent was placed on disability inactive status, and order her \r\n  to pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings.  Within fifteen days of \r\n  the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk \r\n  of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      &nbsp; s/Jean H.

Richardson, Jr., and Deborah Stroud McKeown, both of Columbia, for \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nWilliam G. Walsh, of Simpsonville, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any sanction set forth in \r\n  Rule 7(b), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  We accept the agreement and remove respondent \r\n  from office.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Intemperate Behavior Matters\r\nA defendant, who had been charged with failure to stop for \r\n  a stop sign, appeared before respondent for a bench trial.  After the State \r\n  presented its case in chief, the defendant and his wife testified and asserted \r\n  the defendant had, in fact, stopped for the stop sign.  Respondent, sua \r\n  sponte, asked the officer if he had a videotape of the stop.  The officer \r\n  informed respondent that he had a videotape but that he would have to locate \r\n  it.  Respondent then stated to the defendant, &quot;All right, I'll go you double \r\n  or nothing.  Okay?  If I play the tape and find that you did not stop you will \r\n  pay, as a fine, not only what is written on the ticket, but that amount again \r\n  for not telling me the truth.&quot;  After viewing the tape, respondent found \r\n  it was clear the defendant did not stop at the stop sign.  Although the defendant \r\n  still believed he had come to a complete stop, he stated, &quot;Write the ticket \r\n  up.&quot;   \r\nThereafter, respondent asked the defendant if he had any \r\n  questions and the defendant stated, &quot;At this point, I think I need to keep \r\n  my mouth shut.&quot;  Respondent threatened to charge the defendant with contempt.  \r\n  Respondent shouted in a loud and harsh voice, &quot;Are you going to defy me \r\n  [defendant]?  [Wife], tell your husband unless I see a 100 - no wait- a 180 \r\n  degree change in his attitude in five seconds I'm going to lock him up for contempt \r\n  of court.  I'll be damned if I'm going to have you or anyone else make a complete \r\n  total mockery, do you understand me, sir?&quot;  Respondent continued to berate \r\n  the defendant in a loud and harsh tone for his continued belief that the tape \r\n  showed he came to a stop.  Respondent stated, &quot;You don't deserve to be \r\n  driving . . . [y]ou drive badly and you lied to me.&quot;  When the defendant's \r\n  wife asked to speak, respondent stated, &quot; . . . I don't know how much credibility \r\n  you have . . . I gave you an out.  I gave him an out.  Your attitude, run the \r\n  tape.  I'm not going to run a tape unless I know exactly what's going to happen, \r\n  okay?  I'm not that stupid.  You are, you didn't figure out that I had an idea \r\n  of what goes on?&quot;  \r\nRespondent further chastised the defendant for challenging the word of the \r\n  officer, stating, &quot;Didn't an officer under oath swear that you did not \r\n  stop?&quot;  Respondent's question suggested a predisposed bias toward the testimony \r\n  of an officer over defendants.  Respondent again told the defendant he was &quot;stupid.&quot;\r\nRespondent now recognizes that (1) in requesting a tape after the parties had \r\n  rested their respective cases, and after the officer had elected not to offer \r\n  the tape, respondent assisted the officer in the prosecution of the defendant; \r\n  (2) his &quot;double or nothing&quot; proposal would tend to cause defendants \r\n  to waive their right to plead not guilty and to proceed with a bench trial; \r\n  (3) defendants can be &quot;mistaken&quot; without &quot;lying&quot;; and (4) \r\n  it was inappropriate under any circumstances for respondent to say &quot;I'll \r\n  be damned,&quot; call a defendant &quot;stupid,&quot; lose his temper or appear \r\n  to lose his temper, or shout in a loud, demeaning tone while holding court.\r\nOn two other occasions, respondent displayed similar intemperate behavior.  \r\n  In one instance, after releasing the jury at the conclusion of a trial, respondent \r\n  screamed at the defendant who had been tried, told her how ashamed he was of \r\n  her and asked her &quot;who the hell&quot; did she think she was.\r\nIn another instance, a defendant appearing before respondent informed respondent \r\n  that his mother, who had accompanied him to court, had recently undergone serious \r\n  surgery and that, as a result of the surgery, she was wearing a colostomy bag.  \r\n  The defendant's two children were also present.  The respondent addressed the \r\n  defendant, who had no prior criminal record, in a harsh tone, told the defendant \r\n  he did not care about the condition of the defendant's mother, and sentenced \r\n  the defendant to three days in jail.  The defendant's mother took respondent's \r\n  tone to be loud, harsh, and angry and reported that respondent raised his voice \r\n  and growled while addressing the defendant.  Respondent represents that he consistently \r\n  gives a small amount of jail time for simple possession of marijuana, as well \r\n  as for several other offenses he considers serious, as is within his discretion \r\n  to do.  He further represents that he is stern and harsh with defendants as \r\n  part of their punishment and in an attempt to rehabilitate them.\r\nRespondent acknowledges that he has, in the past, often and regularly talked \r\n  loudly, sternly and in a demeaning manner to defendants.  Respondent initially represented \r\n  to Disciplinary Counsel that he felt this was appropriate because it was his \r\n  responsibility to see to the correction of defendants and that it was part of \r\n  their punishment that respondent was charged with imposing. [1]   Respondent now acknowledges that shouting, \r\n  belittling and cursing in the presence of defendants is inconsistent with the \r\n  Code of Judicial Conduct.\r\nII.               Roll Call Matters\r\nIn March or April 2003, respondent initiated a procedure \r\n  in both Simpsonville and Fountain Inn Municipal Courts pursuant to which defendants \r\n  charged with magisterial level offenses who requested jury trials were required \r\n  to appear in respondent's court once a week and answer a &quot;jury trial roll \r\n  call&quot; at the conclusion of the other business of the court even when no \r\n  jury trials were scheduled on those dates and even when no term for jury trials \r\n  had been scheduled. [2]   The \r\n  defendants were required to appear on the date the bench trial had originally \r\n  been scheduled and once a week thereafter until there was a disposition of their \r\n  case or an attorney made an appearance on their behalf.  Initially, respondent \r\n  handled this procedure by issuing subpoenas to the defendants.  Thereafter, \r\n  respondent prepared a form for use in both the Simpsonville and Fountain Inn \r\n  Municipal Courts.\r\nOn April 17, 1985, the Chief Justice of the South Carolina \r\n  Supreme Court issued an administrative order for magistrate and municipal courts \r\n  which provides, in part, &quot;. . . that a person charged with a . . . traffic \r\n  offense triable in a . . . municipal court may make written demand for jury \r\n  trial prior to the time and date set for bench trial, and the case shall be \r\n  forthwith continued until the next available time reserved for jury trials, \r\n  thereby relieving defendant of the responsibility for the appearance at the \r\n  originally scheduled bench trial.&quot;  This order is a part of the Magistrate's \r\n  and Municipal Court Judge's Bench Book provided to each and every magistrate \r\n  and municipal court judge by South Carolina Court Administration.  Respondent \r\n  was, upon appointment, given a copy of the Bench Book containing the administrative \r\n  order.  Respondent recognizes that (1) the &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; \r\n  procedure he implemented is in violation of that order; (2) requiring defendants \r\n  to appear at previously scheduled bench trials after they have requested a jury \r\n  trial is in violation of the administrative order; (3) he was without authority \r\n  to issue subpoenas for &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; and that doing so was \r\n  in contravention of the administrative order; (4) he was without authority to \r\n  issue orders requiring defendants to appear for &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; \r\n  and that doing so was in violation of the administrative order; and (5) it was \r\n  inappropriate to coerce defendants to obtain an attorney, especially for minor \r\n  traffic offenses, and inappropriate to treat defendants without attorneys different \r\n  from those with attorneys.\r\n&nbsp;One defendant, who was charged with not having a brake light, \r\n  requested a jury trial.  The defendant appeared at approximately three &quot;roll \r\n  calls.&quot;  On one occasion, respondent stated &quot;. . . you've requested \r\n  a jury trial . . . you will be here every Tuesday until your case is called, \r\n  your case is tried, or an attorney sends notice of representation.  You will \r\n  be here for roll call . . . you requested a jury trial.  You're being called \r\n  every Tuesday for roll call until the case is tried . . . Okay?  It's that simple.&quot;  \r\n\r\nOn one occasion, the defendant requested to be excused early after appearing \r\n  in a timely fashion for &quot;roll call.&quot;  He was held in contempt and \r\n  sentenced to twenty-four hours in jail.  This occurred after respondent learned \r\n  that the defendant had asked to be allowed to answer roll call prior to the \r\n  conclusion of the other business of the court to tend to some personal business \r\n  the defendant felt was pressing.  Respondent represents the sentence for contempt \r\n  was warranted because the defendant was disrespectful to the court.  The record \r\n  indicates that respondent stated to the defendant, &quot;You're the one who \r\n  asked for a jury trial.  You're gonna waste the city's money on a jury trial?  \r\n  You don't think that I, a judge, would give you a fair hearing?  You want a \r\n  jury to hear it?  You want to cost the city all that money for a jury?  You're \r\n  the one making a big deal of it! . . . . So you think a jury trial is fair, \r\n  so that means you don't think I can be fair. . . . You've got things you've \r\n  got to do so you come in and you mouth off, you mouth off to the Clerk of Court, \r\n  you mouth off to the administrative judge and you come in my courtroom with \r\n  an attitude . . . .&quot;  Then respondent asked the ministerial judge, &quot;What \r\n  do you think would be appropriate for [defendant]?&quot;  The ministerial judge \r\n  stated he thought &quot;[t]wenty-four hours&quot; was appropriate.  Respondent \r\n  then asked the clerk, &quot;Okay, madam clerk, what do you think would be appropriate?&quot;  \r\n  The clerk responded, &quot;The same.&quot;  Thereafter, respondent sentenced \r\n  the defendant to twenty-four hours in jail.  Respondent now recognizes that \r\n  this was an inappropriate delegation of his judicial authority and that he compromised \r\n  the independence of the judiciary by soliciting input on the disposition of \r\n  the matter from the ministerial judge and the clerk of court and by indicating \r\n  that the ministerial judge and the clerk of court were in a special position \r\n  to influence the judge.\r\nThe following week, the defendant appeared as required for \r\n  &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; and respondent was advised that the defendant \r\n  had withdrawn his request for a jury trial.  Respondent proceeded to hear the \r\n  case and dismiss the brake light charge against the defendant.  The defendant \r\n  advised Disciplinary Counsel that he withdrew his request for a jury trial to \r\n  avoid having to come to &quot;roll call&quot; each week, to avoid hiring an \r\n  attorney for an alleged brake light violation, and because he felt he could \r\n  not get a fair trial from respondent.   \r\nA second defendant, who had been charged with a speeding \r\n  violation and had requested a jury trial, was told to be in court on the date \r\n  his bench trial had originally been scheduled.  On that date, no jury trials \r\n  were scheduled or held.  Respondent suggested to the defendant that he might \r\n  want to withdraw his request for a jury trial.  When the defendant elected not \r\n  to do so, respondent issued a subpoena requiring the defendant to appear again \r\n  the following week despite the fact that no jury trials were scheduled or held \r\n  on that date.  This process continued for two weeks.  When the defendant appeared \r\n  on the third occasion, respondent demanded that the defendant provide his social \r\n  security number to be included on the &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; order.  \r\n  When the defendant objected to providing that information, respondent threatened \r\n  the defendant with contempt of court. [3]   It was the defendant's contention \r\n  that the use of a person's social security number for such purposes is proscribed \r\n  by federal law.  Respondent is now aware that such is the case.\r\nOn the same date, respondent issued an order directing the \r\n  defendant to appear in court at 10:00 a.m. every Tuesday thereafter until the \r\n  completion of the trial of his case or receipt by the court of a letter of representation \r\n  from an attorney.  Under this arrangement, the defendant was required to appear \r\n  approximately ten times for &quot;jury roll call,&quot; sit through the other \r\n  business of the court and then be excused until the next week.  The only reason \r\n  given by respondent for requiring the appearances was to &quot;. . . make sure \r\n  we don't lose track of each other.&quot;\r\nNumerous other defendants who requested a jury trial were \r\n  also required to appear before respondent on the date set for their bench trials \r\n  and to appear for &quot;jury trial roll calls&quot; every Tuesday for weeks \r\n  thereafter.  On each occasion, roll was called at the conclusion of the other \r\n  business before the court and the defendants were then allowed to leave the \r\n  court with the requirement that they be back at the same time each week until \r\n  their cases were concluded or they obtained the services of an attorney to represent \r\n  them on their charges.  The roll call requirement caused some defendants to \r\n  travel long distances on a weekly basis and caused others to be absent from \r\n  their jobs.  At least three defendants who either did not appear on the date \r\n  of their originally scheduled bench trial or who did not appear for &quot;jury \r\n  trial roll call&quot; were tried in their absence and convicted of the offenses \r\n  with which they had been charged.\r\nRespondent maintains the purpose of the &quot;jury trial \r\n  roll calls&quot; was to &quot;keep track&quot; of defendants who often ended \r\n  up not availing themselves of the jury trials they had requested.  In addition, \r\n  respondent contends that, while awaiting roll call, defendants would be educated \r\n  about respondent and his court and many would determine respondent was lenient \r\n  and fair and that it would be in their best interest to withdraw their request \r\n  for a jury trial and instead let their case be concluded by a bench trial before \r\n  respondent.  Respondent now recognizes that, in addition to being contrary to \r\n  the plain language of the administrative order, the &quot;jury trial roll call&quot; \r\n  procedure acted to deter persons from exercising their right to a trial by jury \r\n  and their right to be released on bond pending trial.\r\nIII.              Pre-trial Conference Matters\r\nPrior to the holding of jury trials, pro se \r\n  defendants were served with subpoenas requiring that they attend pre-trial conferences.  \r\n  No such subpoenas were served on the prosecutor or police officers; however, \r\n  witnesses and victims were subpoenaed.  At the pre-trial conferences, respondent \r\n  sat on the bench and the pro se defendants were required to enter \r\n  into discussions with the prosecutor for the State.  Respondent maintains he \r\n  did not conduct the conferences, but instead they were conducted by the prosecutor.  \r\n  Respondent now recognizes that this arrangement is suggestive of a bias toward \r\n  the State, that there is no statutory authority authorizing the issuance of \r\n  such subpoenas, that it was inappropriate to issue such subpoenas for the convenience \r\n  of the State and not that of defendants, that it was inappropriate for respondent \r\n  to issue subpoenas requiring defendants' presence at the conferences and then \r\n  allow the prosecutor to conduct the conferences, and that this mandatory, one-sided \r\n  appearance conflicted with the directives of the administrative order.\r\nIV.              Juror Dismissal Matter\r\nA juror who had two young children and could not find anyone \r\n  to care for them while she was on jury duty brought them with her to respondent's \r\n  court.  The juror advised a court employee of her situation.  The employee told \r\n  the juror that she had to go into the courtroom and discuss the matter with \r\n  respondent.  When the juror entered the courtroom, respondent, in a loud and \r\n  harsh tone, told her she could not bring the children into the courtroom, pointed \r\n  his finger at her and told her to leave.  The juror reported back to the employee \r\n  and was again instructed she had to go into the courtroom and discuss the matter \r\n  with respondent.  When the juror explained to the employee that respondent had \r\n  just told her to leave the courtroom, the employee told the juror to go home.  \r\n  The events were very embarrassing to the juror.  Respondent represents that \r\n  he was harsh with the juror because she was late to court, she should have brought \r\n  up the issue of the lack of adequate care for the children prior to the date \r\n  of jury service, and she should have left the children unattended in the hall \r\n  and come into his courtroom without the children to address the issue of being \r\n  excused from jury duty.  Respondent is now aware that, pursuant to S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 14-78-50, the juror was, as a matter of law, entitled to be excused from \r\n  jury duty, that his staff should have advised the juror of the requirement of \r\n  providing an affidavit as required by the statute, and that it was respondent's \r\n  responsibility to have such issues addressed without respondent causing embarrassment \r\n  to potential jurors under such circumstances.\r\nV.               Prior Disciplinary History\r\nRespondent has received letters of caution from the Commission \r\n  on Judicial Conduct on two prior occasions for conduct similar to that set forth \r\n  in the Agreement for Discipline by Consent.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that the conduct set forth above constitutes \r\n  a violation of the following Canons of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, \r\n  SCACR: Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity and independence of the judiciary); \r\n  Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in \r\n  all of the judge's activities); Canon 2(A)(a judge shall respect and comply \r\n  with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes public confidence \r\n  in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary); Canon 2(B)(a judge shall \r\n  not convey or  permit others to convey the impression that they are in a special \r\n  position to influence the judge); Canon 3 (a judge shall perform the duties \r\n  of judicial office impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(2)(a judge shall \r\n  be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3(B)(4)(a \r\n  judge shall be patient, dignified and courteous to litigants, jurors, witnesses, \r\n  lawyers and others with whom the judge deals in an official capacity); Canon \r\n  3(B)(5)(a judge shall perform judicial duties without bias or prejudice); Canon \r\n  3(B)(7)(a judge shall accord to every person who has a legal interest in a proceeding \r\n  the right to be heard according to law); Canon 3(C)(1)(a judge shall diligently \r\n  discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities without bias or prejudice \r\n  and maintain professional competence in judicial administration, and should \r\n  cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration of court \r\n  business); and Canon 3(C)(2)(a judge shall require staff, court officials and \r\n  others subject to the judge's direction and control to observe the standards \r\n  of fidelity and diligence that apply to the judge).\r\nRespondent also concedes that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of the Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground \r\n  for discipline for a judge to violate the Code of Judicial Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5)(it \r\n  shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to be habitually intemperate); \r\n  and Rule 7(a)(7)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to willfully \r\n  violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find, based on respondent's history of intemperate behavior \r\n  in the courtroom, his failure to modify his behavior after previous letters \r\n  of caution, and his failure to abide by an administrative order of the Chief \r\n  Justice, that removal from office is warranted.  See In the Matter \r\n  of Dearman, 277 S.C. 394, 287 S.E.2d 921 (1982)(magistrate removed from \r\n  office due to habitual intemperance).  It is therefore ordered that respondent \r\n  be removed from office as of the date of the filing of this opinion.\r\n REMOVED. \r\n TOAL, C.J, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\nMOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  On one occasion, respondent stated in open court, \r\n    &quot;It's purposely cold in here.  I don't want it comfortable in here.  \r\n    In fact, I'm thinking about taking out chairs and just putting in hard benches.  \r\n    It's intentionally uncomfortable, that's part of the punishment aspect.&quot;  \r\n    Respondent now acknowledges that such comments were inappropriate and indicated \r\n    a bias towards those who elected not to forfeit bond and were awaiting trial.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  On one occasion, respondent heard approximately \r\n    seventeen cases and then had &quot;jury trial roll call.&quot;  On another \r\n    occasion, respondent heard approximately twenty-five cases before having &quot;roll \r\n    call.&quot;\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Respondent required the first defendant, despite \r\n    the defendant's wish not to do so, to recite the details of his earlier incarceration \r\n    to the second defendant and all those present in the courtroom.  After hearing \r\n    the first defendant recite the circumstances of his incarceration, the second \r\n    defendant relented and gave respondent his social security number.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25723","title":"In the Matter of Jones","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25723","description":"This opinion disbars Wade H.

Richardson, Jr., Susan M. Johnston and Princess F. H. Hodges, all of \r\n  Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nJohn P. Freeman, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the sanction of an indefinite suspension or \r\n  disbarment.  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from the practice \r\n  of law in this state.  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nFrom August 2000 until November 2002, respondent retained \r\n  for his personal use approximately $51,000 in legal fees that belonged to the \r\n  law firm by which he was employed.  On some occasions, respondent misappropriated \r\n  funds by having clients make checks payable to him instead of the firm.  On \r\n  other occasions involving closings, instead of preparing a check to the law \r\n  firm for the entire legal fee, respondent made one check payable to the firm \r\n  for a portion of the fee and made another check payable to his personal credit \r\n  card.  On another occasion, respondent, without the client's consent, used client \r\n  trust funds to pay two of his credit cards.  It was respondent's intention to \r\n  charge the client legal fees for the amount of the disbursements.  \r\nTaking into account monies the firm owed him, respondent still owes the firm \r\n  $23,520.  Respondent is attempting to repay this amount to the firm and fully \r\n  acknowledges his responsibilities to the firm.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.15(a) (a lawyer shall hold property of clients that is in the lawyer's \r\n  possession in connection with a representation separate from the lawyer's own \r\n  property); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be \r\n  a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute). \r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and disbar respondent.  Within \r\n  thirty days of the date of this opinion, Disciplinary Counsel and respondent \r\n  shall establish a restitution schedule pursuant to which respondent shall make \r\n  restitution to the law firm from which funds were taken.  Failure to make restitution \r\n  in accordance with this opinion and the restitution plan may result in respondent \r\n  being held in contempt of this Court.  Respondent shall not apply for readmission \r\n  until restitution to the firm has been paid in full.\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, \r\n  SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice \r\n  of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDavid Christopher Shea, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  Respondent also agrees to resign from membership in the South Carolina Bar effective \r\n  December 31, 2003.  Because respondent is 71 years old and has agreed to resign \r\n  from the Bar, we accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The facts, \r\n  as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Tax Sale Matter\r\nRespondent was consulted by a client concerning a property \r\n  dispute which resulted from a tax sale of the client's property.  The client \r\n  paid respondent a retainer of approximately $175.  Thereafter, respondent investigated \r\n  the tax sale and reported his findings to the client.  The case was scheduled \r\n  for trial before the master-in-equity in Charleston.  Meanwhile, the client \r\n  retained a new attorney who obtained the contents of the client's file from \r\n  respondent.  When the case came before the master-in-equity, respondent appeared \r\n  as attorney for the opposing party.\r\nThe property matter was the same or substantially related \r\n  to the matter in which the former client had consulted respondent prior to the \r\n  date of the hearing.  The former client's interests were materially adverse \r\n  to the party respondent represented at the hearing.  Respondent did not, prior \r\n  to the trial, consult personally with the former client about his adverse representation \r\n  of the opposing party at trial nor did he obtain the former client's consent \r\n  to represent the opposing party.\r\nII.               Court Reporter Matter\r\nOn three separate occasions, respondent failed to promptly \r\n  remit payment to Ray Swartz and Associates, Professional Court Reporters, for \r\n  transcripts.  On one occasion, respondent submitted a check which was returned \r\n  due to insufficient funds.   Respondent made repeated promises to pay the amounts, \r\n  but did not do so until after letters of complaint were sent to the Commission \r\n  on Lawyer Conduct by Ray Swartz and Associates.  \r\nIII.              Criminal Trial Matter\r\nRespondent represented a client in a non-capital murder \r\n  trial.  Respondent argued the wrong burden of proof in his closing argument, \r\n  stating the burden of proof was clear and convincing evidence.  He also made \r\n  a post-trial motion for judgment notwithstanding the verdict although the only \r\n  proper post-trial motion was a motion for a new trial.  Respondent set forth \r\n  mitigating circumstances and argued for parole eligibility for less than twenty \r\n  years despite the fact that the case was a non-capital case in which statutory \r\n  mitigating factors did not apply and the client was facing a statutorily mandated \r\n  life sentence with parole eligibility after twenty years.  Finally, respondent \r\n  failed to sufficiently advise his client about the risks of testifying, resulting \r\n  in the solicitor being able to use evidence of a prior bad act against the client \r\n  during cross-examination.  Respondent did not make a record of the extent of \r\n  his advice to the client.\r\nIn addition, respondent had engaged in a sexual relationship \r\n  with the client's mother prior to representing the client at trial.  Respondent \r\n  did not disclose that information to the client prior to or during the trial.\r\nIV.              Real Estate Closing Matter\r\nRespondent performed a real estate closing for a client.  \r\n  New Home Builders, a construction company of which respondent was president \r\n  at the time, loaned the client $7,000.  Respondent and another corporate officer \r\n  signed the check.  This loan was made without advising the client to seek the \r\n  advice of independent counsel.\r\nV.               Quiet Title and Partition Matter\r\nRespondent was retained by a client to quiet title to a \r\n  piece of property.  The client was unable to pay the initial cost of the representation \r\n  so respondent agreed to front all costs and recoup any expenses he may incur \r\n  upon settlement and sale of the property.  No written contract was entered into \r\n  by respondent and the client.  Respondent failed to document the time he spent \r\n  on the matter.\r\nRespondent conducted a title search and filed a Lis Pendens, \r\n  Summons and Complaint, and a Notice of Intent to Refer the Case to the Master-In-Equity, \r\n  in circuit court.  The action to quiet title also included a claim to partition \r\n  the land so that it could be sold.  The matter was referred to the master-in-equity \r\n  who wrote a letter to respondent detailing problems with the case which rendered \r\n  it unable to proceed.  Thereafter, no action was taken on the case and it was \r\n  eventually dismissed for lack of prosecution.  \r\nThe client contacted respondent in an effort to obtain information about her \r\n  case, but respondent failed to return her telephone calls.  The client, accompanied \r\n  by her children, went to respondent's office to discuss delays in the case and \r\n  to request the return of the client's file so that she could seek other counsel; \r\n  however, respondent refused to release the file.  A confrontation ensued, and \r\n  respondent ordered the client and her children to leave his office.  When they \r\n  refused to leave, respondent summoned the police.  \r\nThe client paid respondent $500 for expenses related to the case.  Respondent \r\n  informed the Commission on Lawyer Conduct that he expended over $1,400 in personal \r\n  funds on the case.  As a result, respondent asserted a lien on the client file \r\n  and refused to release any documents to the client other than documents the \r\n  client had provided to him.  The assertion of such a lien on the client's file \r\n  was done without basis in law or fact.\r\n VI.             Forgery Matter\r\nIn 1971 and 1972, respondent prepared three deeds which \r\n  bore the forged signatures of several grantors.  All of the signatures were \r\n  witnessed and/or notarized by respondent and/or his secretary or another notary \r\n  public.  The forged signatures were placed on the deeds without the knowledge \r\n  or consent of the grantors and outside the presence of the witnesses or notary.  \r\n  Respondent did not forge the grantor's names on the deeds in question, but failed \r\n  to fulfill his duties as witness and/or notary or failed to properly supervise \r\n  his secretary when she served as a witness to the deeds.  Moreover, respondent \r\n  failed to include one of the grantors on the three deeds.  In 1973, another \r\n  lawyer prepared a deed, which included the names of all of the grantors, conveying \r\n  a parcel of the property to a different grantee.  \r\nVII.             Failure to Respond\r\nRespondent failed to reply to a Notice of Full Investigation sent to him by \r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct in one of the above matters.  An examination \r\n  of respondent's file at the Notice to Appear, conducted pursuant to Rule 19(c)(4), \r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, revealed a handwritten response, a draft of a typed response, \r\n  a transmittal letter and an unsigned file copy of a response mailed to the Commission; \r\n  however, a response was never received by the Commission.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.7(a) (a lawyer shall not represent a client if the representation of that \r\n  client will be directly adverse to another client unless the lawyer reasonably \r\n  believes the representation will not adversely affect the relationship with \r\n  the other client and each client consents after consultation); Rule 1.9(a) (a \r\n  lawyer who has formerly represented a client in a matter shall not thereafter \r\n  represent another person in the same or a substantially related matter in which \r\n  that person's interests are materially adverse to the interests of the former \r\n  client unless the former client consents after consultation); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer \r\n  shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests \r\n  of the client); Rule 4.1 (in the course of representing a client a lawyer shall \r\n  not knowingly make a false statement of material fact or law to a third person \r\n  or fail to disclose a material fact to a third person when disclosure is necessary \r\n  to avoid assisting a criminal or fraudulent act by a client); Rule 8.4(a) (it \r\n  is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(c) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage \r\n  in conduct involving moral turpitude); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent concedes that his misconduct constitutes grounds \r\n  for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority \r\n  including a request for a response); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for \r\n  discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration \r\n  of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute); and \r\n  Rule 7(a)(6) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  oath of office taken upon admission to practice law in this state).\r\nConclusion\r\nNormally, the misconduct set forth in this opinion would \r\n  warrant an indefinite suspension.  However, as stated earlier, respondent is \r\n  71 years old and has agreed to resign from the South Carolina Bar.

Harrison, of Pickens, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a thirty day suspension \r\n  from the practice of law.  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent from \r\n  the practice of law for thirty days. \r\n  [1]   The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client and her children \r\n  with regard to injuries sustained in an automobile accident.  Respondent failed \r\n  to reduce the contingency fee agreement to writing.  \r\nOver a period of four years, respondent never communicated in writing with \r\n  the client and only had three meetings with the client.  The client initiated \r\n  all contact with respondent regarding her case.  \r\nWithin three months of agreeing to represent the client, respondent learned \r\n  that the client's physicians did not support the contention that the client's \r\n  injuries were caused by the car accident.  However, respondent failed to render \r\n  candid advice to the client regarding the merits of her case.  When the client \r\n  contacted respondent to inquire about the status of her case, respondent repeatedly \r\n  told her he was working on the case and, on one occasion, told her the case \r\n  was &quot;on the docket.&quot;  Respondent failed to inform the client of the \r\n  applicable statute of limitations.  When the client finally confronted respondent \r\n  about the lack of progress with her case, respondent informed her that he had \r\n  never filed the lawsuit because he and the client &quot;would be laughed out \r\n  of court.&quot; \r\nRespondent's deceit and misrepresentation prevented the \r\n  client from seeking competent legal advice and making an informed decision regarding \r\n  the merits of her case.  As a result of respondent's inaction and failure to \r\n  render timely legal advice, the client has been barred from any recovery for \r\n  herself or her children due to the expiration of the statute of limitations.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably \r\n  necessary to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation, \r\n  keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly \r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5(c) (a contingent \r\n  fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee \r\n  is to be determined and upon conclusion of the matter the lawyer shall provide \r\n  the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter, the remittance \r\n  to the client, if there is a recovery, and the method of its determination); \r\n  Rule 1.16(d) (while a lawyer may withdraw from representation of a client if \r\n  the client insists upon pursuing an objective the lawyer considers imprudent, \r\n  upon termination of representation, the lawyer shall take steps to the extent \r\n  reasonably practicable to protect a client's interests, such as giving reasonable \r\n  notice to the client, allowing time for employment of other counsel, surrendering \r\n  papers and property to which the client is entitled and refunding any advance \r\n  payment of fee that has not been earned); Rule 2.1 (in representing a client, \r\n  a lawyer shall exercise independent professional judgment and render candid \r\n  advice); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation \r\n  consistent with the interests of the client); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct).\r\nRespondent also admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds \r\n  for discipline under Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe hereby accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for thirty days.  \r\n  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Spell, of Charleston, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  The facts, as set forth \r\n  in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Loan Closing Matter\r\nRespondent was retained by a client to act as a closing \r\n  attorney in the refinancing of the client's home.  When respondent learned the \r\n  client would not be available on the date originally scheduled for the closing, \r\n  he provided the loan package to the mortgage broker.  The mortgage broker took \r\n  the loan package to the client's house to be executed over the weekend.  Respondent \r\n  admits he was not present when the loan documents were executed by the client.  \r\n  Instead, respondent requested that the mortgage broker contact respondent on \r\n  his cellular phone if questions arose regarding the transaction or the execution \r\n  of the closing documents.  \r\nRespondent instructed the mortgage broker to make sure the client understood \r\n  her three day right of rescission and to &quot;make sure the borrower understands \r\n  that the settlement statements in the package were prepared by the lender and \r\n  [do] not show all fees to be collected.&quot;  Respondent instructed the mortgage \r\n  broker to inform the client that she would have to come to respondent's office \r\n  and sign a settlement statement prepared by respondent's office prior to the \r\n  disbursement of funds.  Respondent did not communicate directly with the client \r\n  for approximately eighteen days after the loan package was executed.  \r\nThe client received the loan proceeds prior to discussing or signing the settlement \r\n  statement that was to be prepared by respondent.  As a result of respondent's \r\n  failure to adequately and timely explain the closing and the disbursements to \r\n  the client, the client negotiated the proceeds without fully understanding the \r\n  amounts she would receive as a result of the closing.  This lack of understanding \r\n  led to the client spending funds for purposes other than to pay off a specific \r\n  debt which was a major reason for the client refinancing her home. \r\nRespondent admits that his actions assisted a person, who is not a member of \r\n  the Bar, to engage in the unauthorized practice of law.  He also admits that \r\n  his failure to directly participate in the closing contributed to the frustration \r\n  of the client's original purpose for refinancing her home.\r\nII.               Recording of Deed Matter\r\n                   Respondent closed a residential real estate transaction \r\n  for a client.  As a result of respondent's failure to timely record the deed, \r\n  the client was required to pay his property taxes at a rate of 6%, rather than \r\n  the primary residence rate of 4%.  \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2(a) (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives \r\n  of representation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence \r\n  and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4(a) (a lawyer shall keep a \r\n  client reasonably informed about the status of a matter and promptly comply \r\n  with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.4(b) (a lawyer shall explain \r\n  a matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed \r\n  decisions regarding the representation); Rule 5.5(b) (a lawyer shall not assist \r\n  a person who is not a member of the bar in the performance of activity that \r\n  constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule \r\n  8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that \r\n  is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent also acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate \r\n  the Rules of Professional Conduct); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute); and Rule 7(a)(6) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the oath of office \r\n  taken upon admission to practice law in this state). \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  \r\n  See In the Matter of Lester, 353 S.C. 246, 578 S.E.2d 7 (2003).  \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly \r\n  reprimand respondent for his actions.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND. \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Buffkin, both of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into \r\n  an agreement pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and agrees to accept an admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand. [1]   The facts, as set forth in the agreement, \r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Failure to Respond to Disciplinary Counsel Matter\r\nRespondent failed to timely respond to inquiries from Disciplinary \r\n  Counsel during an investigation into a complaint against respondent.  Respondent \r\n  did not respond to a letter from Disciplinary Counsel informing respondent of \r\n  the complaint or to a letter from Disciplinary Counsel sent pursuant to In \r\n  re Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), which again requested a \r\n  response to the allegations in the complaint.  Respondent did not file a written \r\n  response to the allegations until after she was served with a Notice of Full \r\n  Investigation.\r\nDuring the initial investigation, respondent was experiencing \r\n  difficulty receiving mail sent to her home office.  Respondent failed to take \r\n  reasonable steps to ensure that she was receiving mail at that address, which \r\n  was listed with the South Carolina Bar and this Court.\r\nII.               Continuing Legal Education (CLE) Matter\r\nRespondent failed to keep accurate records of the time she \r\n  spent attending continuing legal education seminars in 2001 and 2002.  As a \r\n  result, respondent inadvertently claimed full credit for a CLE seminar that \r\n  was actually cut short when one of the scheduled speakers was unable to attend.  \r\n  Following an audit by the Commission on Continuing Legal Education and Specialization, \r\n  respondent was administratively suspended for nine days until she completed \r\n  and reported sufficient CLE hours to meet her annual requirement.\r\nIII.              Contract Dispute Matter\r\nRespondent was retained to represent a client in connection \r\n  with a contract dispute with a builder.  When settlement negotiations were unsuccessful, \r\n  the client agreed to pursue the matter with litigation.  After filing a complaint, \r\n  respondent gave her client file to another attorney to review for possible association \r\n  on the case.  Respondent did not retain a copy of the file.  The other attorney \r\n  did not accept the case and respondent never retrieved her client file.  In \r\n  addition, because respondent failed to properly serve the builder with the complaint, \r\n  the lawsuit was dismissed for lack of service.  Respondent did not inform the \r\n  client of the dismissal or that her file had been sent to another attorney.  \r\n  The client learned of the dismissal by calling the clerk of court, who she contacted \r\n  after thirteen telephone calls to respondent went unreturned.  By the time the \r\n  client learned of the dismissal, the statute of limitations had expired on her \r\n  claims against the builder.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by her conduct she has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2 (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives \r\n  of representation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence \r\n  and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a \r\n  matter to the extent reasonably necessary to permit the client to make informed \r\n  decisions regarding the representation, keep the client reasonably informed \r\n  about the status of the matter, and promptly comply with reasonable requests \r\n  for information); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite \r\n  litigation consistent with the interests of the client); Rule 8.4(a) (it is \r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nRespondent's misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline \r\n  under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) \r\n  (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional \r\n  Conduct); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to \r\n  fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority including a \r\n  request for a response); and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondent's misconduct warrants a public reprimand.  \r\n  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly \r\n  reprimand respondent for her actions.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.

Freeman, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to a sanction ranging from a one year suspension \r\n  from the practice of law to an indefinite suspension from the practice of law.  \r\n  After considering information submitted by respondent in mitigation, we accept \r\n  the agreement and impose an indefinite suspension.  The facts, as set forth \r\n  in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nI.                 Matter A\r\nRespondent was retained to defend clients in a civil action \r\n  and to file a counterclaim on the clients' behalf.  The clients paid respondent \r\n  a $2,000 retainer fee.  It was further agreed that respondent would receive \r\n  a fee of twenty-five percent of any recovery on the counterclaim minus the $2,000 \r\n  retainer fee.  However, respondent failed to prepare and have executed a written \r\n  fee agreement.\r\nFor almost two years, respondent conducted discovery in \r\n  the case.  When opposing counsel filed a motion for summary judgment, respondent \r\n  requested the counterclaim be dismissed pursuant to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.  A consent \r\n  order dismissing the lawsuit was executed by respondent, without the knowledge \r\n  or consent of the clients, and filed in Horry County.  Over the next two years \r\n  and nine months, respondent initiated and continued a pattern of intentional \r\n  misrepresentations to the clients concerning the progress of the case.  During \r\n  that time, respondent performed little or no work on the case and the case was \r\n  never restored to the docket.\r\nHowever, respondent informed the clients that the court \r\n  had awarded them a judgment of $135,000.  Respondent informed the clients that \r\n  they would receive $102,000 of the judgment.  When the clients asked respondent \r\n  for a copy of the order, respondent maintained the court had issued a verbal \r\n  order and he therefore could not produce any documentation to support the existence \r\n  of the order.  Thereafter, respondent continued to make numerous misleading \r\n  statements and produce fabricated documents consistent with the misleading statements \r\n  to deceive the clients regarding respondent's efforts to secure the non-existent \r\n  judgment.  \r\nAt one point, respondent presented the clients with a check for $25,000 drawn \r\n  on respondent's operating account. [1]   Respondent informed the clients that the money was a partial \r\n  payment of the judgment.  Over the next several months, respondent made numerous \r\n  false promises and statements to the clients regarding respondent's efforts \r\n  to obtain the balance of the non-existent judgment.  On two separate occasions, \r\n  respondent informed the clients that he had received the remaining balance of \r\n  the judgment and would be depositing the money into the clients' account; however, \r\n  no such deposit was ever made.  Respondent did pay the clients $8,000, once \r\n  again out of personal funds, under the guise of an additional partial payment \r\n  of the judgment.  Respondent assured the clients he would have the remaining \r\n  balance within thirty days.  Approximately one month later, respondent presented \r\n  the clients with a check for $5,000 drawn on respondent's operating account, \r\n  into which respondent had purportedly placed personal funds to continue to cover \r\n  up the scheme to deceive the clients.  Shortly thereafter, respondent informed \r\n  the clients that he still did not have the balance of the funds but offered \r\n  to pay the clients the balance owed by selling stock and property, which he \r\n  would recover through a subsequent lawsuit.  The clients informed respondent \r\n  that they did not want his money but instead wanted the money from the judgment \r\n  respondent claimed had been awarded to the clients.\r\nII.               Matter B\r\nRespondent was retained by a client to represent her as \r\n  to any claims she had as a result of her husband's death in a car accident.  \r\n  Respondent led the client to believe he had hired an expert witness to examine \r\n  her husband's car and that the fictitious expert had issued a report stating \r\n  the accident was due to the car having faulty brakes.  Respondent waited until \r\n  the day before the statute of limitations expired to file the case.  Respondent \r\n  misrepresented to the client the value of her case and failed to provide her \r\n  with candid advice regarding the merits of the case.  As a result, the client \r\n  had unrealistic expectations of a large settlement or judgment.\r\nJust over a year after the case was filed, respondent, without \r\n  the client's knowledge or consent, consented to the case being dismissed pursuant \r\n  to Rule 40(j), SCRCP.  Respondent failed to inform the client of his actions \r\n  after the consent order was signed.  After respondent informed the client that \r\n  he could no longer handle her case due to his impending withdrawal from the \r\n  practice of law, the client took her file to another attorney for review.  That \r\n  attorney would not accept the case due to a lack of evidence to substantiate \r\n  the claim.  When the client asked respondent why her file did not contain the \r\n  expert's report, respondent informed the client that the report should have \r\n  been in the case file.\r\nIII.              Matter C\r\nRespondent was retained to assist a client in obtaining \r\n  title to a mobile home and resolving an unrelated contract dispute.  However, \r\n  respondent failed to maintain adequate communication with the client regarding \r\n  the status of his cases and failed to pursue the client's cases in a diligent \r\n  manner, requiring the client to seek other legal counsel.\r\nIV.              Matter D\r\nRespondent was retained to handle a workers' compensation \r\n  claim for a client.  After receiving an initial judgment, respondent filed an \r\n  appeal.  However, respondent failed to perform the necessary research to determine \r\n  the impact the appeal would have on the statute of limitations.  As a result, \r\n  the statute of limitations which applied to the case expired.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2 (a) (a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives \r\n  of representation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued); Rule 1.2(c) (a lawyer may limit the objectives of the \r\n  representation if the client consents after consultation); Rule 1.3 (a lawyer \r\n  shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing a client); \r\n  Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall explain a matter to the extent reasonably necessary \r\n  to permit the client to make informed decisions regarding the representation, \r\n  keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and promptly \r\n  comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.5(c) (a contingent \r\n  fee agreement shall be in writing and shall state the method by which the fee \r\n  is to be determined and upon conclusion of the matter the lawyer shall provide \r\n  the client with a written statement stating the outcome of the matter, the remittance \r\n  to the client, if there is a recovery, and the method of its determination); \r\n  Rule 2.1 (in representing a client, a lawyer shall exercise independent professional \r\n  judgment and render candid advice); Rule 3.1 (a lawyer shall not bring or defend \r\n  a proceeding, or assert or controvert an issue therein, unless there is a basis \r\n  for doing so that is not frivolous); Rule 3.2 (a lawyer shall make reasonable \r\n  efforts to expedite litigation consistent with the interests of the client); \r\n  Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct); Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer \r\n  to engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct \r\n  that is prejudicial to the administration of justice).\r\nIn addition, respondent admits that his actions constitute \r\n  grounds for discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR:  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer \r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be \r\n  a ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute \r\n  the administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession \r\n  into disrepute).\r\nConclusion\r\nOrdinarily, the misconduct set forth in this opinion would \r\n  warrant disbarment.  However, respondent has presented medical evidence that \r\n  these violations occurred while he was suffering from a psychological illness \r\n  which manifested itself in an intense need to please others even to the detriment \r\n  of respondent's own personal health and well being.  Taking into account respondent's \r\n  diagnosis and the fact that he is currently undergoing treatment for his condition, \r\n  we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and impose an indefinite suspension.  \r\n  In re Glover, 333 S.C. 423, 510 S.E.2d 419 (1998)(&quot;In the past, \r\n  we have allowed evidence of depression to mitigate misconduct.&quot;).  Within \r\n  fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit \r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule \r\n  413, SCACR.\r\n INDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  \r\n  MOORE, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent represents he used personal funds, \r\n    not other client funds or law firm funds, to pay the client.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25729","title":"In the Matter of Chastain","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25729","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter.","date":"2003-09-29","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n.MsoBodyText\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\tline-height:200%;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoBodyTextIndent\r\n\t{text-align:justify;\r\n\ttext-indent:.5in;\r\n\tfont-size:15.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";\r\n\tcolor:black;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Randall M. Chastain, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25729\r\nHeard September 24, 2003 - Filed September \r\n  29, 2003\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia; \r\n  for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\nRandall M. Chastain, of Charleston, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary \r\n  matter, the Hearing Officer and the Full Panel recommended respondent Randall \r\n  M. Chastain be disbarred.  We agree and disbar respondent.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondentâ€™s disciplinary history is \r\n  pertinent to the instant matter.  In 1994, this Court definitely suspended respondent \r\n  for:  neglecting several legal matters, failing to respond to various clientsâ€™ \r\n  telephone calls and letters, failing to return retainer fees, and failing to \r\n  respond to inquiries by disciplinary authorities.  We imposed a two-year definite \r\n  suspension and ordered respondent to pay restitution in excess of $30,000 to \r\n  his clients before applying for readmission to the Bar.  In re Chastain, \r\n  316 S.C. 438, 450 S.E.2d 578 (1994).\r\nIn 1995, we found respondent in \r\n  criminal contempt of the 1994 suspension order because he had performed legal \r\n  research and prepared and reviewed pleadings.   In re Chastain, Order \r\n  No. 1995-OR-1448 (S.C. Sup. Ct. dated October 6, 1995).  No additional sanction \r\n  was imposed on respondent.  \r\nIn 1997, we suspended respondent \r\n  for 90 days after he pleaded guilty to three counts of failure to make and file \r\n  a state income tax return in tax years 1989, 1990, and 1993.  In re Chastain, \r\n  327 S.C. 173, 488 S.E.2d 878 (1997).\r\nFinally, in 2000, we considered \r\n  whether to sanction respondent after he was convicted of one count of breach \r\n  of trust with fraudulent intent.  The conduct underlying the conviction involved \r\n  the failure to return one of the retainer fees involved in the 1994 proceeding.  \r\n  We declined to impose an additional sanction.  In re Chastain, 340 S.C. \r\n  356, 532 S.E.2d 264 (2000).\r\nRespondent has never \r\n  been reinstated since his 1994 two-year definite suspension.  However, even \r\n  a suspended lawyer is subject to the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement.  \r\n  Specifically, Rule 34 of the RLDE provides as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nA lawyer who is disbarred, suspended \r\n  or transferred to incapacity inactive status shall not be employed by a member \r\n  of the South Carolina Bar as a paralegal, investigator or in any other capacity \r\n  connected with the law.â€¦  A disbarred or suspended lawyer who violates this \r\n  rule shall be deemed in contempt of the Supreme Court and may be punished accordingly.\r\n\r\nRule 34, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.         \r\nThe charges brought against respondent \r\n  in the instant matter concern his employment as Office Manager with the Richland \r\n  County Attorneyâ€™s Office.  According to the formal charges, respondent became \r\n  employed with the County Attorneyâ€™s Office in September 1999.  The job description \r\n  for the position of Office Manager states that the manager â€œorganizes and oversees \r\n  the day-to-day office/administrative activities of the County Attorneyâ€™s Department \r\n  including paralegal activities; adherence to established Court dates/deadlines, \r\n  legal preparations and other related documentation and research.â€  In addition, \r\n  the job description detailed that the Office Manager would:  (1) regularly interact \r\n  with outside attorneys and representatives of the court system; and (2) have \r\n  part-time law clerks reporting to him.\r\nThe Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  alleged that these job responsibilities applied to respondentâ€™s employment with \r\n  the County Attorneyâ€™s Office, and therefore, respondent acted as a paralegal \r\n  and supervised other paralegals.  In short, the formal charges allege that respondentâ€™s \r\n  job as Office Manager constituted employment connected with the law in violation \r\n  of Rule 34 of the RLDE.  Additionally, respondent failed to respond to the formal \r\n  charges, various initial inquiries from Disciplinary Counsel, and the Notice \r\n  of Full Investigation.  Accordingly, respondent was found in default.\r\nAt the hearing (which respondent \r\n  did not attend), Disciplinary Counsel presented a single witness, Barbara Hinson, \r\n  records custodian for the Commission on Lawyer Conduct. \r\n  [1]   The Hearing Officer found respondent had been properly served with \r\n  both the Notice of the Hearing and the Order of Default and yet had failed to \r\n  appear at the hearing to provide any mitigation evidence.  Further, the Hearing \r\n  Officer found respondent had violated various Rules of Professional Conduct \r\n  (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR. [2]   In addition, the Hearing Officer found respondent had violated \r\n  Rule 34, RLDE, supra.   As to the sanction, the Hearing Officer specifically \r\n  referenced this Courtâ€™s 1995 contempt order wherein the Court found respondent \r\n  in criminal contempt for practicing law while under suspension.  The Hearing \r\n  Officer concluded that respondent engaged in a deliberate pattern of misconduct \r\n  and recommended respondent be disbarred.  The Panel adopted the Hearing Officerâ€™s \r\n  report and recommendation.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIt is of course well-settled that \r\n  the authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline \r\n  is given rests entirely with this Court.  E.g., In re Yarborough, \r\n  337 S.C. 245, 524 S.E.2d 100 (1999).  Because respondent failed to answer the \r\n  formal charges against him, this failure constitutes an admission of the factual \r\n  allegations.  See Rule 24(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR; In re Purvis, \r\n  347 S.C. 605, 557 S.E.2d 651 (2001).  Furthermore, respondent failed to appear \r\n  at the hearing; therefore, he is deemed to have:  (1) admitted the factual allegations \r\n  that were to be the subject of such appearance; and (2) conceded the merits \r\n  of any recommendation to be considered at the hearing.  Rule 24(b), RLDE; Purvis, \r\n  supra.  Accordingly, we only have to determine the appropriate sanction \r\n  for respondent.  E.g., Purvis, supra; In re Rast, \r\n  337 S.C. 588, 524 S.E.2d 619 (1999).\r\nWe find respondent violated the \r\n  following Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Rule 5.5 (unauthorized practice of law);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       Rule 7(a)(1), (3), (5), (6) &amp; (7) (it is grounds for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to violate or attempt to: violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, \r\n  Rule 407, SCACR; knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary \r\n  authority;         engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of \r\n  justice or to bring to the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or \r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law;    violate the oath of office \r\n  taken upon admission to practice law in this state; willfully violate a valid \r\n  court order issued by a court of this state);\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       (3)\r\n       Rule 8.1(b) (a lawyer in connection with a disciplinary matter, \r\n  shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from \r\n  a disciplinary authority); and\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       (4)&nbsp;\r\n       Rule 8.4 (violation of the rules of professional conduct).\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nMoreover, it is clear respondent \r\n  violated Rule 34 of the RLDE. See Rule 34, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (a suspended \r\n  lawyer shall not be employed as a paralegal, investigator or in any other \r\n  capacity connected with the law).\r\nRespondent has demonstrated a \r\n  pattern of misconduct.  In addition to his other misconduct over the years, \r\n  he has on more than one occasion worked, while under suspension, in a capacity \r\n  connected with the practice of law.  Obviously, employment within a County Attorneyâ€™s \r\n  office falls within the ambit of the type of work barred by Rule 34, RLDE.  \r\n  Accordingly, we disbar respondent.  See In re Hall, 341 S.C. 98, \r\n  533 S.E.2d 588 (2000) (where Hall was disbarred for practicing law while under \r\n  indefinite suspension, neglect of legal matters, and failure to respond to disciplinary \r\n  authority).\r\nWithin fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent \r\n  shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has compiled \r\n  with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also surrender his Certificate of \r\n  Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of Court.\r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT, PLEICONES, JJ., and \r\n  Acting Justice G. Thomas Cooper, Jr.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Hinson essentially provided exhibits documenting respondentâ€™s disciplinary \r\n    history and his failure to respond to ODCâ€™s various inquiries and filings.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  See Rules 5.5; 7(a)(1), (3), (5), (6) &amp; (7); 8.1(b); and \r\n    8.4.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Robert J.
