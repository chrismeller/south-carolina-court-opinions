McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, and Senior Assistant Attorney General\r\nHarold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia; and Walter M. Bailey, Jr., of Summerville, for\r\nRespondent. \r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES: We granted certiorari to review \r\n  a decision of the Court of Appeals holding that petitioner Benjamin was properly \r\n  sentenced to life without the possibility of parole (LWOP) following an armed \r\n  robbery conviction.  State v. Benjamin, 341 S.C. 160, 533 S.E.2d 606 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2000).  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nBenjamin and another individual robbed a Citgo convenience store.  \r\n  In the course of this armed robbery, a Citgo employee was shot and killed.  \r\n  Approximately four hours later, the two men robbed a Dodgeâ€™s convenience store \r\n  at gunpoint.  The charges arising from the Citgo incident were tried first, \r\n  and Benjamin was convicted of murder and armed robbery.  He received an LWOP \r\n  sentence for murder and a thirty-year sentence for the armed robbery.  See \r\n  State v. Benjamin, 345 S.C. 470, 549 S.E.2d 258 (2001) (affirming these \r\n  convictions and sentences).  Both murder and armed robbery are defined as â€œmost \r\n  serious offensesâ€ under the â€œtwo strikesâ€ law.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-25-45(C)(1) \r\n  (Supp. 2001).\r\nFollowing the Citgo trial, Benjamin was tried and convicted of armed \r\n  robbery of the Dodgeâ€™s convenience store.  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§17-25-45(A) \r\n  (Supp. 2001) provides â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of lawâ€¦upon a conviction \r\n  for a most serious offense as defined by this section, a person must be sentenced \r\n  to [LWOP] if that person has one or more prior convictions for: (1) a most serious \r\n  offense . . . .â€ \r\nBenjamin was sentenced to LWOP for the armed robbery of the Dodgeâ€™s store over \r\n  his objection that the legislature did not intend that Â§17-25-45(A) apply to \r\n  convictions arising from a single crime spree.  The Court of Appeals affirmed \r\n  this sentence, and we granted certiorari to review that decision.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDoes S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-25-45(A) \r\n  apply so as to require an LWOP sentence for a subsequent conviction where all \r\n  convictions arise from a single crime spree?\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANALYSIS\r\nBenjamin contends that the legislature did not intend \r\n  that recidivist statutes such as Â§17-25-45 apply to individuals who engage in \r\n  a single continuous course of criminal conduct.  In support of this contention, \r\n  Benjamin points to an alleged ambiguity in Â§17-25-45(F), and to S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§17-25-50 (1985).  We find no ambiguity in subsection (F), and find Benjaminâ€™s \r\n  reliance on Â§17-25-50 misplaced.  \r\n\r\nSection 17-25-45(F) provides:\r\nFor the purpose of determining a prior conviction under \r\n  this section only, a prior conviction shall mean the defendant has been convicted \r\n  of a most serious offense or a serious offense, as may be applicable, on a separate \r\n  occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.\r\n\r\nBenjamin contends this section is ambiguous because it may be \r\n  read to say either (1) that the commission of the prior most serious offense \r\n  must have occurred on an earlier, separate occasion, or (2) that the conviction \r\n  occurred â€œon a separate occasion,â€ â€œprior to the instant adjudication.â€  \r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the language \r\n  of Â§17-25-45(F) is plain and unambiguous.  Benjaminâ€™s first reading of the statute \r\n  is simply unsupported by the statutory language.  There is no reference in Â§17-25-45(F) \r\n  to the time of the prior offenseâ€™s commission; rather, the only temporal reference \r\n  is to the prior conviction.  In clear and unambiguous language, this subsection \r\n  defines a prior conviction for purposes of Â§17-25-45 as a serious or most serious \r\n  conviction, on a separate occasion, prior to the instant adjudication.  E.g., \r\n  State v. Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991)(when statuteâ€™s \r\n  terms are clear and unambiguous, court must apply them literally).  \r\nAt the time of the Dodgeâ€™s armed robbery conviction, Benjamin had already been \r\n  convicted, on a separate occasion, of the most serious offenses of murder and \r\n  armed robbery that occurred at the Citgo.  An LWOP sentence was, therefore, \r\n  mandated by Â§17-25-45(A).\r\nBenjamin argues, however, that we must construe Â§17-25-45 \r\n  in light of Â§17-25-50, which provides:\r\n\r\nIn determining the number of offenses for the purpose of \r\n  imposition of sentence, the court shall treat as one offense any number of offenses \r\n  which have been committed at times so closely connected in point of time that \r\n  they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding under the law they constitute \r\n  separate and distinct offenses.\r\n\r\nOur precedents required us to consider together both original \r\n  recidivist statutes, Â§17-25-50 and the predecessor to Â§17-25-45, Â§17-25-40.  \r\n  See State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 272 S.E.2d 628 (1980); State \r\n  v. Muldrow, 259 S.C. 414, 192 S.E.2d 211 (1972).  After these cases were \r\n  decided, the legislature revised the statutory scheme.  These pre-1982 precedents \r\n  must nevertheless  be considered in light of the current statutes.\r\nWhen the General Assembly repealed Â§17-25-40 \r\n  [1]  in 1982 and replaced it with Â§17-25-45, it fundamentally altered the \r\n  relationship between the recidivist statutes.  The 1982 act explicitly provides \r\n  â€œNotwithstanding any other provision of law [certain defendants] shall be sentenced \r\n  to life in prison.â€ 1982 Act No. 358, Â§1.A.  This language, specifically barring \r\n  consideration of any other statute, has been retained in the current version \r\n  of Â§17-25-45.  See Â§17-25-45(A) and (B) (Supp. 2001).  That the legislature \r\n  intends that Â§17-25-45 be construed independent of any other statute is reinforced \r\n  by the introductory language of subsections (E) and (F), both of which begin \r\n  â€œFor purposes of determining a prior conviction under this section onlyâ€¦.â€  \r\n  It is no longer necessary or appropriate to harmonize or reconcile Â§17-25-45 \r\n  and Â§17-25-50 in light of the General Assemblyâ€™s unmistakable instruction that \r\n  Â§17-25-45 be applied without regard to any other provision of law. \r\n  [2]   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBenjamin was properly sentenced, pursuant to Â§17-25-45(A), \r\n  to LWOP for the armed robbery of the Dodgeâ€™s convenience store.  The decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals upholding that sentence is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n BURNETT, J., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, \r\n  concur.  WALLER, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which MOORE, A.C.J., \r\n  concurs.\r\nJUSTICE WALLER (dissenting):  I respectfully \r\n  dissent.  In my view, the Legislature did not intend that individuals, such \r\n  as Benjamin, who commit several crimes during a single, continuous crime spree \r\n  be subjected to recidivist sentencing. \r\n  [3] \r\nA recidivist is â€œa habitual criminal.  A criminal \r\n  repeater.  An incorrigible criminal.  One who makes a trade of crime.â€  Blackâ€™s \r\n  Law Dictionary, 1269 (6th Ed. 1990).  Recidivist legislation \r\n  attempts to encourage offenders to stay out of trouble and punishes those who \r\n  refuse to be deterred even after a conviction.  Commonwealth v. Eyster, \r\n  585 A.2d 1027, 1031 (Pa. 1991).  Recidivists are persons who continue to commit \r\n  criminal, antisocial behavior after incarceration for an earlier offense.  Recidivist \r\n  statutes aim at punishing those who have shown they are incorrigible offenders.  \r\n  Shannon Thorne, One Strike and Youâ€™re Out: Double Counting and Dual Use Undermines \r\n  the Purpose of Californiaâ€™s Three-Strikes Law, 34 U.S.F.L.Rev. 99 (1999).  \r\n  The purpose of requiring separate offenses is to ensure that those offenders \r\n  being sentenced under the harsh provisions of a recidivist sentencing statute \r\n  have not been classified as habitual offenders because of multiple convictions \r\n  arising from a single criminal enterprise; it provides the state with some certainty \r\n  that the offender has participated in multiple criminal trials and, despite \r\n  these opportunities to understand the gravity of his behavior and abide by the \r\n  law, has continued to engage in criminal conduct. Daniel Rogers, People v. \r\n  Furman and Three Strikes: Have the Traditional Goals of Recidivist Sentencing \r\n  Been Sacrificed at The Altar of Public Passion?, 20 Thomas Jefferson L. \r\n  Rev. 139, 156 (Spring 1998). \r\nIn my view, the recidivist statute is aimed at \r\n  career criminals, those who have been previously sentenced and then commit another \r\n  crime, not at persons like Benjamin whose recidivist status is premised solely \r\n  upon acts occurring within a four-hour period.\r\nContrary to the majorityâ€™s contention, section \r\n  17-25-45 cannot, in my opinion, be read in isolation, but must be read in conjunction \r\n  with section 17-25-50.  \r\nSection 17-25-50 provides:\r\nIn determining the number of offenses for the purpose of \r\n  imposition of sentence, the court shall treat as one offense any number of \r\n  offenses which have been committed at times so closely connected in point of \r\n  time that they may be considered as one offense, notwithstanding under the \r\n  law they constitute separate and distinct offenses.  (Emphasis supplied).\r\nSection 17-25-45(A) provides, in part, â€œ[n]otwithstanding \r\n  any other provision of law. . . upon a conviction for a most serious offense \r\n  . . ., a person must be sentenced to a term of imprisonment for life without \r\n  the possibility of parole if that person has one or more prior convictions for. \r\n  . . (certain specified offenses).â€\r\nThis Court has recognized that the predecessor \r\n  to section 17-25-45 (17-25-40) and section 17-25-50 must be construed together.  \r\n  See State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 452, 272 S.E.2d 628, 631, \r\n  n. 2 (1980) (recognizing that section 17-25-50 must be read in conjunction with \r\n  section 17-25-40, the predecessor to section 17-25-45).  Accord State \r\n  v. Burdette, 335 S.C. 34, 515 S.E.2d 525 (1999)(recognizing section 17-25-40 \r\n  is the predecessor to section 17-25-45).  See also State v. Muldrow, \r\n  259 S.C. 414, 192 S.E.2d 211 (1972) (statute directing trial court to treat \r\n  as one offense any number of offenses committed at times so closely connected \r\n  in point of time that they may be considered as one offense is applicable only \r\n  for purpose of sentencing under recidivist statute).  \r\nThe majority points to the â€œnotwithstanding any \r\n  other provision of lawâ€  language of section 17-25-45(A), as an indication of \r\n  legislative intent that it is no longer appropriate to construe sections 17-25-50 \r\n  and 17-25-45 together.  I disagree.  In State v. Woody, 345 S.C. 34, \r\n  545 S.E.2d 521 (2001), the Court of Appeals held sections 17-25-45(F) and 17-25-50 \r\n  could be reconciled such that both apply under the recidivist statute.  The \r\n  Woody court found â€œnothing to suggest section 17-25-45(F) somehow abrogates \r\n  section 17-25-50.â€  345 S.C. at 37, 545 S.E.2d at 522.  I agree. \r\n  [4]   \r\nIt is a well-accepted principle of statutory construction \r\n  that statutes which are part of the same legislative scheme should be construed \r\n  together.  Stardancer Casino, Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d \r\n  357 (2001).  Statutes must be read as a whole and sections that are part of \r\n  the same general statutory scheme must be construed together and each given \r\n  effect, if reasonable.  Higgins v. State, 307 S.C. 446, 449, 415 S.E.2d \r\n  799, 801 (1992).  Furthermore, the court should not consider the particular \r\n  clause being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction with \r\n  the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.  South Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics Comm'n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991).  However plain the ordinary meaning of the words \r\n  used in a statute may be, the courts will reject that meaning when to accept \r\n  it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not possibly have \r\n  been intended by the legislature or would defeat the plain legislative intention.  \r\n  Ray Bell Constr. Co. v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 331 S.C. 19, \r\n  501 S.E.2d 725 (1998).  \r\nAs the Court did in Stewart and Muldrow, \r\n  it is our duty to construe the statutes as a whole, and in Benjaminâ€™s favor.  \r\n  Doing so here, it is patent that Benjaminâ€™s single course of conduct should \r\n  be treated as one offense.  I would hold that Benjaminâ€™s four-hour crime-spree \r\n  was simply not the type of recidivism the Legislature had in mind when it enacted \r\n  section 17-25-45.  State v. Baker, 310 S.C. 510, 512, 427 S.E.2d 670, \r\n  671-72 (1993)(statute as a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair \r\n  interpretation consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers).  \r\n\r\nMoreover, to read section 17-25-45 in isolation, \r\n  as the majority does here, permits the solicitor unfettered discretion to treat \r\n  similarly situated defendants differently, based solely upon whether the solicitor \r\n  elects to try the charges together, or separately, such that there is a â€œprior \r\n  conviction.  For example, if two defendants commit multiple offenses at one \r\n  time, such as armed robbery, burglary, kidnapping, and murder, then whether \r\n  each defendant is subject to a LWOP sentence depends entirely upon whether the \r\n  solicitor elects to try the offenses separately, in which case there is a â€œprior \r\n  conviction,â€ or jointly, in which case there is not.  Further, under this factual \r\n  situation, one defendant may be subjected to a LWOP sentence while another, \r\n  equally culpable defendant is not.  Not only could such a scenario give rise \r\n  to equal protection violations, but, in my opinion, the Legislature clearly \r\n  could not have intended such a result. \r\n  [5]   \r\nI would hold that Benjamin is not eligible \r\n  for an LWOP sentence for the robbery of Dodgeâ€™s store; I would reverse the Court \r\n  of Appealsâ€™ opinion. MOORE, A.C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  1982 Act No. 358, Â§3.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  To the extent the Court of Appeals reaches a different \r\n    conclusion in State v. Woody, 345 S.C. 34, 545 S.E.2d 521 (Ct. App. \r\n    2001), that decision is overruled.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]    The majority does not dispute that all of Benjaminâ€™s \r\n    convictions arose from a single crime spree.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   The majority overrules Woody; I would \r\n    affirm Woody.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]    Further evidence that the Legislature could not have intended such \r\n    a result is found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 24-21-640 (Supp. 2001), governing circumstances \r\n    warranting parole, which provides, in part, relative to granting parole to \r\n    persons serving a second or subsequent conviction of a violent crime, â€œ[p]rovided \r\n    that where more than one included offense shall be committed within a one-day \r\n    period or pursuant to one continuous course of conduct, such multiple offenses \r\n    must be treated for purposes of this section as one offense.â€  In my view, \r\n    it would be incongruous to require the parole board to treat offenses committed \r\n    within a 24-hour period as one offense for purposes of determining parole, \r\n    while simultaneously holding that such offenses constitute multiple offenses \r\n    for purposes of a life without parole sentence under section 17-25-45.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25615","title":"Hendrix v.

Appellant was also required by Colorado statute \r\n  to register as a sex offender, [1]  but could petition to be removed \r\n  from the registry five years after the date of his guilty plea. [2]   \r\nOn November 15, 2000, \r\n  Appellant and his spouse moved to Anderson, South Carolina, which triggered \r\n  the requirements of the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry Act (â€œActâ€). S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§Â§ 23-3-400 through -520. The Act mandates that Appellant register \r\n  as a sex offender in South Carolina for life.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-460; See \r\n  South Carolina Sex Offenders Registry at http://www.sled.state.sc.us.  The online \r\n  registry provides information like sex, age, height and weight to help identify \r\n  the offender.  It also includes the offenderâ€™s last reported address and the \r\n  sex offense that he committed.  Originally, Appellant was registered as having \r\n  committed Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature (â€œABHANâ€), but \r\n  sometime between March 22, 2002, and October 8, 2002, the offense was changed \r\n  to Assault with Intent to Commit Criminal Sexual Conduct in the Third Degree. \r\n  [3]    \r\nOn November 22, 2000, \r\n  Appellant filed this action seeking a declaratory judgment that the Act does \r\n  not apply to his Colorado conviction for third degree sexual assault, and that \r\n  his mandatory listing on the Sex Offender Registry of South Carolina violated \r\n  his constitutional right to equal protection and due process.  Appellant also \r\n  moved to permanently enjoin the Sheriff of Anderson County from requiring that \r\n  he register under the Act. \r\nThe trial court denied \r\n  Appellantâ€™s request for injunctive relief, rejected his constitutional claims, \r\n  and required him to register under the Act. \r\nAppellant raises the following issue on appeal:\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err when it \r\n  concluded that requiring Appellant to register under the Sex Offender Registry \r\n  Act did not violate his right to Equal Protection or Due Process when the equivalent \r\n  offense, if committed in South Carolina, would not have required registry?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellant argues that \r\n  the state has violated his right to equal protection by forcing him to register \r\n  on the South Carolina Sex Offender Registry for an offense he committed in Colorado \r\n  when the equivalent offense, if committed in South Carolina, would not have \r\n  triggered the requirement that he register.  [4]   We disagree. \r\nThe movement to enact sex offender \r\n  registration statutes arose after Megan Kanka, a seven-year old child, was raped \r\n  and murdered in New Jersey by a convicted sex offender who had moved in across \r\n  the street from her family. [5]   \r\n  The killer enticed the girl to come over to his house in order to see his new \r\n  puppy. [6]   The New Jersey legislature responded \r\n  to this highly publicized event by declaring a legislative emergency to immediately \r\n  debate and enact a sexual crimes bill. [7]   On October 31, 1994, Governor \r\n  Whitman signed the bill, which became known as Meganâ€™s Law. [8]   N.J. Stat. Ann. 2C:7-1 et \r\n  seq.  The law requires sexual criminals to register with local law enforcement.  \r\n\r\nThe United States Congress also \r\n  reacted to the national outrage over sexual crimes by passing the Jacob Wetterling \r\n  Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Predator Act (â€œJacob Wetterling \r\n  Actâ€), which President Clinton signed on September 13, 1994. Jacob Wetterling \r\n  Crimes Against Children and Sexually Violent Offender Registration Program, \r\n  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 14071 (West 1994).  The Jacob Wetterling Act gives states incentives \r\n  to enact laws that protect the public from sexual criminals by conditioning \r\n  federal funding under the Public Health and Welfare Code to state enactment \r\n  of a sex crimes law.  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 14071(g)(1) and (g)(2).  The Jacob Wetterling \r\n  Act also creates a national sexual offender database, in which the states are \r\n  required to participate.  42 U.S.C.A. Â§ 14071(b)(2)(B).  \r\nBy the time that the New Jersey \r\n  legislature and Congress passed these laws, the South Carolina General Assembly \r\n  had enacted its own Act, which became effective on July 1, 1994.  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§Â§ 23-3-400 et seq.  The following types of sex criminals are placed \r\n  on the registry:\r\n\r\n(1) A South Carolina resident \r\n  who has pled guilty or nolo contendere, or been convicted of a sex offense in \r\n  this state; [9]  in any other state; or in federal court; or\r\n(2) A South Carolina resident \r\n  who is registered on another stateâ€™s sex offender registry; or \r\n(3) A judge may order that a criminal \r\n  be registered if good cause is shown.          \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430(A) and \r\n  (D).\r\nAppellant pled guilty to the Colorado \r\n  crime of sexual assault in the third degree, which is not listed as a sex offense \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-430.  Instead, Appellant was registered in South Carolina \r\n  as committing Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature (â€œABHANâ€).  \r\n  The Act provides that the sentencing judge may order registration for \r\n  this offense.  [10]   Appellant argues that registering him as \r\n  committing ABHAN - a crime he technically did not commit - is â€œmisleadingâ€ and \r\n  deprives him of his right to equal protection. \r\nEqual Protection\r\nThe equal protection clause \r\n  of United States Constitution provides that â€œno state shall . . . deny to any \r\n  person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.â€  U.S. Const. \r\n  amend. XIV, Â§ 1; see also S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.  If a statutory provision \r\n  â€œdoes not involve a suspect classification or a fundamental right, â€¦ the question \r\n  under equal protection analysis is whether the legislation is rationally related \r\n  to a legitimate state purpose.â€  Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. 557, 574, \r\n  549 S.E.2d 591, 600 (2001). [11] \r\n    \r\nAppellant argues that the state \r\n  has deprived him of his fundamental right to privacy, \r\n  [12]  and therefore that the court should apply the strict scrutiny analysis.  \r\n  See Clark v. Jeter, 486 U.S. 456, 461, 108 S.Ct. 1910, 1914, 100 L.Ed.2d \r\n  465, 471 (1988) (recognizing that strict scrutiny is applied to â€œclassifications \r\n  based on race or national origin, and classifications affecting fundamental \r\n  rightsâ€).  Although the U.S. Supreme Court has recognized a right to privacy \r\n  in limited circumstances, the privacy protections do not extend to information \r\n  about a sexual offense Appellant committed in another state, which became a \r\n  matter of public record when Appellant registered as a sex offender in Colorado.  \r\n  Accordingly, the Court need not apply a strict scrutiny analysis to this matter. \r\n\r\nSince the classification \r\n  did not affect a fundamental right, this Court applies the â€œrational relationshipâ€ \r\n  test in determining that the statute did not violate Appellantâ€™s right to equal \r\n  protection.  The scope of review should be limited â€œin cases involving a constitutional \r\n  challenge to a statute because all statutes are presumed constitutional and, \r\n  if possible, will be construed to render them valid.â€ Curtis, 345 S.C. \r\n  at 569, 549 S.E.2d at 597.     Under this analysis, Appellantâ€™s classification \r\n  as a sex offender in South Carolina is justified if\r\n\r\n  (1) the classification \r\n  bears a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought to be effected; (2) the members of the class are treated alike under similar circumstances and \r\n  conditions; and (3) the classification rests on some reasonable basis.  \r\n\r\nId. at 574, 549 S.E.2d \r\n  at 599-600.  The Act complies with the first prong of the test, as the legislative \r\n  purpose is clearly defined:\r\n\r\nThe intent of this article is \r\n  to promote the state's fundamental right to provide for the public health, welfare, \r\n  and safety of its citizens. Notwithstanding this legitimate state purpose, these \r\n  provisions are not intended to violate the guaranteed constitutional rights \r\n  of those who have violated our nation's laws.\r\nThe sex offender registry will \r\n  provide law enforcement with the tools needed in investigating criminal offenses. \r\n  Statistics show that sex offenders often pose a high risk of re-offending. Additionally, \r\n  law enforcement's efforts to protect communities, conduct investigations, and \r\n  apprehend offenders who commit sex offenses are impaired by the lack of information \r\n  about these convicted offenders who live within the law enforcement agency's \r\n  jurisdiction.  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-400.  Thus \r\n  classifying Appellant as a sex offender is reasonably related to the legitimate \r\n  state purpose of protecting the public and aiding law enforcement in limiting \r\n  the risk that sex offenders pose to communities.  See Cutshall, 199 F.3d \r\n  at 482-483.  Appellantâ€™s classification as a sex offender in South Carolina \r\n  also comports with the second prong of the test because all persons who \r\n  must register under the Act are subject to uniform administrative and legal \r\n  procedures regardless of which sexual offense they commit.  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann Â§ 23-3-450 through -490.  \r\nAppellant argues that \r\n  his classification as a sex offender in South Carolina fails the third prong \r\n  of the Curtis test because the state has no reasonable basis for asserting \r\n  that he committed an ABHAN in South Carolina when the actual crime he pled guilty \r\n  to was sexual assault in the third degree in Colorado.  In our opinion, the \r\n  stateâ€™s action is reasonable because the purpose of the law is to protect the \r\n  public welfare and to assist law enforcement in accomplishing that goal.  Registering \r\n  persons who committed crimes in another state when they move to South Carolina \r\n  is a reasonable method of achieving this goal. [13]   The stateâ€™s classification of Appellant \r\n  as a sex offender satisfies rational scrutiny and the Curtis test because \r\n  Colorado deemed him a sex offender, and South Carolina gives comity to Coloradoâ€™s \r\n  adjudication.  Therefore, the statute reasonably protects South Carolinians \r\n  because the registry notifies them of Appellantâ€™s sex offense.\r\nWhile we find that the \r\n  stateâ€™s registration of Hendrix as committing an ABHAN to be constitutional, \r\n  we are troubled that the state incorrectly registered Hendrix as committing \r\n  an ABHAN when in actuality, he pled guilty to sexual assault in the third degree \r\n  as defined by statute.  \r\nWe hold that when the South Carolina \r\n  Law Enforcement Division (â€œSLEDâ€) registers a sex criminal due to his conviction \r\n  of a sexual offense in another state, the agency must correctly state the offense \r\n  the criminal committed in that jurisdiction.  Accordingly, under the â€œOffenseâ€ \r\n  heading on the registry, SLED should provide (1) the state where the offense \r\n  was committed; (2) the citation of that stateâ€™s statute that was violated; (3) \r\n  the name of the crime committed; and (4) the date of conviction.  For example, \r\n  in this case, Appellantâ€™s offense would appear under the â€œOffenseâ€ heading as \r\n  follows: \r\n\r\nColorado\r\nÂ§ 18-3-404: Third Degree Sexual \r\n  Assault\r\n2000-03-08 \r\n  [14]     \r\n\r\nWe reserve for another \r\n  day the question of whether Appellantâ€™s right of equal protection would be offended \r\n  if his petition to be removed from the Colorado registry is granted, yet he \r\n  remains on the South Carolina registry for life.    \r\nDue \r\n  Process\r\nAppellant argues that \r\n  the state violated his due process right because it deprived him of a liberty \r\n  interest without a hearing.  Appellant must first â€œshow that he has a constitutionally \r\n  protected liberty or property interest, and that he has been deprived of that \r\n  protected interest by some form of state action.â€  Fleming v. Rose, 338 \r\n  S.C. 524, 539-540, 526 S.E.2d 732, 740 (Ct. App. 2000), revâ€™d on diff. grounds, \r\n  350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002).     \r\nAppellant asserted in his complaint \r\n  that South Carolina enhanced his punishment because once a person is registered \r\n  as a sex offender in this state, he must register annually for life.  In Colorado, \r\n  he can appeal to have his name removed from the registry after five years. \r\n  [15]    Appellantâ€™s argument fails because this Court has ruled that registering \r\n  as a sex offender is a non-punitive imposition. State v. Walls, 348 S.C. \r\n  26, 31, 558 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2002).  Therefore, the length of time one must \r\n  be listed on the sex offender registry is non-punitive, and it cannot constitute \r\n  a deprivation of a constitutionally protected liberty interest.  As such, Appellant \r\n  has not shown a due process violation. \r\nConclusion\r\nThe stateâ€™s listing of Appellant \r\n  on the Sex Offender Registry has not violated his right to equal protection \r\n  or due process.  Accordingly, we AFFIRM the trial courtâ€™s denial of injunctive \r\n  relief.     \r\nWe also hold that when \r\n  SLED registers a sex offender who committed a sex crime in another state, it \r\n  must list under the â€œOffenseâ€ heading: (1) the state where the offense was committed; \r\n  (2) the citation of that stateâ€™s statute that was violated; (3) the name of \r\n  the crime committed; and (4) the date of conviction. \r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  At the time that Appellant pled guilty, the relevant \r\n    Colorado statute was Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 18-3-412.5 (West 1999 &amp; Supp. \r\n    2000).  The provision of this statute defining which persons who are required \r\n    to register can now be found in Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 16-22-103 (West Supp. \r\n    2002), which was effective July 1, 2002.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  At the time that Appellant pled guilty, the relevant \r\n    Colorado statute that addressed the petition to be removed from the registry \r\n    was Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 18-3-412.5(7) (West 1999 and Supp. 2000).  The \r\n    statute that presently covers the petition is Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 16-22-113 \r\n    (West Supp. 2002), which was effective July 1, 2002.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3] The March 22, 2002, document was provided in the Record On Appeal, \r\n    and October 8, 2002, was the date of oral arguments for this case.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4] See S.C.

Â§ 23-3-430(D) provides, â€œUpon conviction, adjudication \r\n    of delinquency, guilty plea, or plea of nolo contendere of a person of an \r\n    offense not listed in this article, the presiding judge may order as a condition \r\n    of sentencing that the person be included in the sex offender registry if \r\n    good cause is shown by the solicitor.â€ \r\n\r\n \r\n   [11]  Appellant is not part of a suspect class.  See \r\n    e.g., Cutshall v. Sundquist, 193 F.3d 466, 483 (6th Cir. 1999) \r\n    (holding that convicted sex offenders are not a suspect class).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [12]  The Constitution of South Carolina specifically \r\n    recognizes a right to privacy.  S.C. Const. art. I Â§ 10.  The United States \r\n    Supreme Court has recognized a constitutional right to privacy in various \r\n    situations.  See Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113, 152, 93 S.Ct. 705, 726, \r\n    35 L.Ed.2d 147, 176-177 (1973) (finding that the constitutional right to privacy \r\n    protects personal decisions â€œrelating to marriage, procreation, contraception, \r\n    family relationships, and child rearing and educationâ€).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [13]  S.C.

Pope, of York, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:&nbsp; We granted certiorari to consider \r\n  whether the Court of Appeals erred in holding that evidence of petitionerâ€™s \r\n  prior drug convictions were properly admitted at trial.  State v. Dunlap, \r\n  346 S.C. 312, 550 S.E.2d 889 (Ct. App. 2001).  We affirm as modified, finding \r\n  that Judge Shulerâ€™s concurring opinion properly analyzed this case as one involving \r\n  â€˜door openingâ€™ or â€˜invited response.â€™\r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner was convicted \r\n  of distributing crack cocaine in 1999 and received a nineteen-year sentence \r\n  and was ordered to pay a $100,000 fine.  His prior record included the following \r\n  convictions:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1997:&nbsp; \r\n      \r\n       conspiracy to possess crack cocaine with intent to\r\n        distribute \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      1994: \r\n      \r\n       distribution of an imitation drug \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      1994: \r\n      \r\n       simple possession of marijuana \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      1991: \r\n      \r\n      shoplifting\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDuring petitionerâ€™s \r\n  attorneyâ€™s opening statement, counsel acknowledged that petitioner â€œhad been \r\n  in trouble with the law from the time he was fifteen years old,â€ was â€œa young \r\n  man addicted to drugs,â€ and â€œwe could convict him right now because he is a \r\n  young man who was hooked on crack and had a problem with it.  He never sold \r\n  it, but he used it.â€\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether petitionerâ€™s prior drug convictions \r\n  were properly admitted?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWhile it is technically \r\n  accurate that petitioner had never been convicted of distributing crack cocaine, \r\n  an examination of his record demonstrates that he had attempted, albeit unsuccessfully, \r\n  to position himself as a drug dealer.  The 1994 conviction for distributing \r\n  an imitation substance came about when petitioner sold a chunk of white chocolate \r\n  for $800, representing it to be crack cocaine.  In 1997, petitioner was convicted \r\n  of conspiracy to possess crack cocaine with intent to distribute.\r\nThe opening statement created the impression that petitioner had \r\n  no prior connection to the sale of narcotics.  In reality, petitioner was not \r\n  a mere drug user, but an individual who sought to â€˜elevateâ€™ his status to that \r\n  of a drug dealer.  That he was unsuccessful in actually selling anyone illegal \r\n  drugs does not alter the fact that he tried.  We therefore agree with Judge \r\n  Shuler that petitionerâ€™s counsel opened the door to the introduction of evidence \r\n  rebutting the contention that petitioner was merely an addict.  Compare \r\n  Edmond v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 534 S.E.2d 682 (2000) fn. 3 (noting counsel \r\n  can open door to evidence of post-arrest silence by asserting government never \r\n  gave defendant opportunity to tell his story); cf. State v. Locklair, \r\n  341 S.C. 352, 535 S.E.2d 420 (2000) (statement at pretrial hearing that defendant \r\n  may offer evidence of mental illness at trial opened door to court-ordered psychiatric \r\n  exam and to issue of defendantâ€™s mental health).\r\nBecause we find that counsel opened the door to the admission of \r\n  petitionerâ€™s prior drug record, we need not reach the issue whether these convictions \r\n  were admissible to impeach petitionerâ€™s credibility under Rule 609, SCACR.  \r\n  We take this opportunity, however, to remind the bench and bar that violations \r\n  of narcotics laws are generally not probative of truthfulness.  State v. \r\n  Aleksey, 343 S.C. 20, 538 S.E.2d 248 (2000) (applying Rule 608, SCRE).  \r\n  This relative lack of probative value should figure prominently in the weighing \r\n  of prejudice, pursuant to Rule 609 (a) (1), when determining whether to permit \r\n  a criminal defendantâ€™s impeachment by such conduct.  See Green v. \r\n  State, 338 S.C. 428, 527 S.E.2d 98 (2000)(factors to be considered in allowing \r\n  impeachment with prior convictions for crimes not involving dishonesty or falsehood).  \r\n  Further, we agree with Judge Shuler that when the prior offense is similar to \r\n  the offense for which the defendant is on trial, the danger of unfair prejudice \r\n  to the defendant from impeachment by that prior offense weighs against its admission.  \r\n  See e.g., State v. Colf, 337 S.C. 622, 628, 525 S.E.2d 246, 249 \r\n  (2000)(similarity of prior crimes increases prejudice, not probative value).   \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe decision of the Court of Appeals affirming petitionerâ€™s appeal \r\n  is\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25617","title":"Farmer v.

Code Ann. Â§ 15-5-150 (1976), and the statute \r\n  of limitations.  We reverse in part and affirm in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents \r\n  (Plaintiffs), who are South Carolina residents, commenced this action for actual \r\n  and punitive damages allegedly resulting from the purchase of defective cotton \r\n  seed.  Plaintiffs alleged they represented a class of â€œall cotton growersâ€ who \r\n  purchased the defective seed from Corporations.\r\nCorporations, \r\n  except Mixon Seed Company, are foreign corporations.  They pled as an affirmative \r\n  defense Â§ 15-5-150 which provides:\r\n\r\nAn action against \r\n  a corporation created by or under the laws of any other state, government or \r\n  country may be brought in the circuit court:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  By any resident of this State for any cause of action; or\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       (2)&nbsp;\r\n      &nbsp;By a plaintiff not a resident of this State when the cause of action shall have \r\n  arisen or the subject of the action shall be situated within this State.\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nCorporations claimed that under this \r\n  section Plaintiffsâ€™ assertion of a potential nationwide class could not include \r\n  nonresidents whose causes of action did not arise in South Carolina.  Corporations \r\n  also pled the statute of limitations as an affirmative defense.\r\nPlaintiffs moved to strike \r\n  these two defenses.  They claimed the door-closing statute does not apply so \r\n  long as the class representatives are South Carolina residents; further, they \r\n  argued no statute of limitations barred the action.  The trial judge granted \r\n  Plaintiffsâ€™ motion and struck these two defenses from Corporationsâ€™ answers.  \r\n  Corporations appeal.\r\nISSUE\r\nDoes Â§ 15-5-150 limit a class action \r\n  against a foreign corporation in state court?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAs an initial matter, we note the \r\n  parties and the trial judge have framed the issue of the door-closing statute \r\n  as one of subject matter jurisdiction as held previously by this Court.  See \r\n  Parsons v. Uniroyal-Goodrich Tire Corp., 313 S.C. 394, 438 S.E.2d 238 \r\n  (1993); Olson v. Lockwood Greene Engineers, Inc., 278 S.C. 67, 292 S.E.2d \r\n  186 (1982) overruled in part by Parsons, supra; Cox \r\n  v. Lunsford, 272 S.C. 527, 252 S.E.2d 918 (1979); Nix v. Mercury Motor \r\n  Exp., Inc., 270 S.C. 477, 242 S.E.2d 683 (1978); see also Builder \r\n  Mart of America, Inc. v. First Union Corp., 349 S.C. 500, 563 S.E.2d 352 \r\n  (Ct. App. 2002); Murphy v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp., 346 S.C. 37, \r\n  550 S.E.2d 589 (Ct. App. 2002); Eagle v. Global Assoc., 292 S.C. 354, \r\n  356 S.E.2d 417 (Ct. App. 1987).  Because Â§ 15-5-150 does not involve subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction but rather determines the capacity of a party to sue, we \r\n  overrule these cases to the extent they hold otherwise.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction \r\n  is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings \r\n  in question belong.   Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-238, \r\n  442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994).  Section 15-5-150 does not affect the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n  power to hear any general class of proceedings.  We have specifically held that \r\n  another door-closing statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 33-15-102 (1990), \r\n  [1]  affects only a partyâ€™s capacity to sue and not the subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  of the circuit court.  Chet Adams Co. v. James F. Pedersen Co., 307 S.C. \r\n  33, 413 S.E.2d 827 (1992).  Similarly, Â§ 15-5-150 does not affect subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction.\r\nOn the merits, the trial \r\n  judge held the door-closing statute does not apply as a matter of law because \r\n  the representatives of the class are South Carolina residents.  Corporations \r\n  contend this was error because the class itself cannot include members who would \r\n  not be able to bring the action in their individual capacities under the door-closing \r\n  statute.  We agree.\r\nWhether the \r\n  door-closing statute limits the members of a class action is a novel question. [2]   The federal case relied upon \r\n  by the trial judge and Plaintiffs, Central Weslyan College v. Kaiser Gypsum \r\n  Co., 6 F.3d 177 (4th Cir. 1993), is not controlling.  In that \r\n  case, the plaintiff, a South Carolina college, commenced an action in federal \r\n  court seeking compensation for asbestos removal.  The district court conditionally \r\n  certified a nationwide class of all colleges and universities that had suffered \r\n  property damage from asbestos removal.  On appeal, the Fourth Circuit summarily \r\n  held that federal policy in favor of consolidating asbestos litigation pre-empted \r\n  our State door-closing statute and Â§ 15-5-150 was not a bar to class certification.  \r\n  6 F.3d at 186.  By its terms, however, Â§ 15-5-150 applies only to actions brought \r\n  in the circuit court.  The statute clearly does not apply to federal \r\n  suits and the Fourth Circuitâ€™s ruling on its non-application in that case is \r\n  irrelevant.\r\nSection 15-5-150 \r\n  was enacted in 1870.  Historically, cases involving early class actions held \r\n  that a class was proper only if composed of plaintiffs who could properly be \r\n  joined as parties to the action.  See Faber v. Faber, 76 S.C. \r\n  156, 56 S.E. 677 (1907).  This early joinder rule would have limited class members \r\n  to those who had the capacity to sue individually, supporting the conclusion \r\n  the legislature intended Â§ 15-5-150 to limit class membership to those who had \r\n  capacity under its terms.\r\nPublic policy \r\n  supports this view of legislative intent.  We have previously recognized three \r\n  important objectives of the door-closing statute:  1) it favors resident plaintiffs \r\n  over nonresident plaintiffs; 2) it provides a forum for wrongs connected with \r\n  the State while avoiding the resolution of wrongs in which the State has little \r\n  interest; and 3) it encourages activity and investment within the State by foreign \r\n  corporations without subjecting them to litigation unrelated to their activity \r\n  within the State.  Rosenthal v. Unarco Ind., Inc., 278 S.C. 420, 297 \r\n  S.E.2d 638 (1982).  These policy objectives are equally applicable in the context \r\n  of class actions. \r\nFrom the Stateâ€™s \r\n  perspective, the rationale for allowing a class action is â€œto manage litigation \r\n  involving numerous class members who would otherwise all have access to court \r\n  via individual lawsuits.â€  Worth v. City of Rogers, 86 S.W.3d 875, \r\n  879 (Ark. 2002) (emphasis added).  Limiting the class to members who qualify \r\n  under Â§ 15-5-150 simply excludes class members who would otherwise have no access \r\n  to our courts via individual lawsuits.  Further, the Stateâ€™s interest in limiting \r\n  suits against foreign corporations outweighs the interest of the few South Carolina \r\n  plaintiffs seeking to represent nationwide classes. \r\nIn conclusion, we hold Â§ 15-5-150 \r\n  controls the eligibility of class members in a class action where the defendant \r\n  is a foreign corporation.  Accordingly, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order striking \r\n  this affirmative defense. \r\nIn light of \r\n  our conclusion that the class may include only those eligible under Â§ 15-5-150, \r\n  the applicable statute of limitations is under South Carolina law.  Counsel \r\n  for Corporations conceded during argument on the motion to strike that our statute \r\n  of limitations does not bar the suit.  The trial courtâ€™s ruling striking the \r\n  statute of limitations as a defense is therefore affirmed.\r\nREVERSED \r\n  IN PART; AFFIRMED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., \r\n  WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [1]  This section restricts the right of a foreign corporation to sue in \r\n    the courts of this State until the corporation has obtained a certificate \r\n    of authority.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [2]  We find the wrongful death cases cited by Corporations inapposite.  \r\n    In a wrongful death action, the representative plaintiffâ€™s capacity is derived \r\n    from the decedentâ€™s; in a class action, the representativeâ€™s capacity does \r\n    not derive from the class members but rather is representational capacity \r\n    based on commonality.

Savitz, III, Assistant \r\n  Appellate Defender Eleanor Duffy Cleary, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Donald \r\n  J. Zelenka, all of Columbia, and Solicitor Druanne Dykes White, of Anderson, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:  Christopher Dale Tench was convicted \r\n  of murder, first degree burglary, and attempted armed robbery.  He was sentenced \r\n  to death for murder, life imprisonment for burglary, and ten years for attempted \r\n  armed robbery.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early morning hours of January \r\n  12, 1999, police were called to a home in Anderson, SC, where they found Appellant, \r\n  Christopher Dale Tench, bleeding from the torso, left hand, and both legs, the \r\n  apparent victim of a shooting.  Tench told police he had been shot by three \r\n  men at Broadway Lake; however, he could not describe either his assailants or \r\n  the exact location of the shooting.  In the hopes of obtaining further information \r\n  leading to the individuals who shot Tench, police sought a search warrant for \r\n  his vehicle.  The affidavit supporting the warrant sought â€œblood, fibers, weapons, \r\n  projectiles, casings or papers or receipts which would indicate the manner, \r\n  method, motive, cause or perpetrators involved in the shooting . . .â€  \r\nThe search warrant was executed at approximately \r\n  2:00 p.m. on January 12, 1999,  by Investigator Clamp, one of the \r\n  officers who had been called to Tenchâ€™s home in the early morning hours.  As \r\n  Clamp was executing the warrant, he was advised by another officer that police \r\n  were investigating the murder of a man named James Michael McBride, who had \r\n  been found shot to death at his home the same morning.  Clamp was advised that \r\n  some peanut shells had been found outside McBrideâ€™s residence.  Accordingly, \r\n  Clamp began looking for any evidence which might link the two crimes together.  \r\n  Clamp seized the following items from Tenchâ€™s vehicle: \r\n\r\n1 Pillow, Sample of Dirt, Peanuts, Light Switch, 1 Dime, \r\n  Box of Ammo. (partial box)- Reloads, assorted cans and bottles, assorted papers, \r\n  1 pair of black gloves, paint scraping, 8 trace evidence lifts, 2 blood swabs, \r\n  yellow handled pliers, green colored ball cap, small black flashlight, insurance \r\n  papers, 3 sheets of latent fingerprint lifts and inked impressions of the tires.  \r\n  Also collected was small blood stained portion of the driverâ€™s seat, 1 small \r\n  blue ball bat, 1 set of booster cables.  \r\n\r\nThree days later, while in the hospital being treated \r\n  for his injuries, Tench confessed to shooting McBride.  However, Tench claimed \r\n  he had intended only to burglarize the home but was confronted by McBride when \r\n  he entered the home.  According to Tench, McBride started shooting at him; Tench \r\n  pleaded with McBride to be allowed to leave but McBride kept shooting.  Tench \r\n  shot him, killing him.  \r\nTench was subsequently indicted for murder, \r\n  first-degree burglary, and armed robbery; the state sought the death penalty \r\n  for murder.  At trial, Tench moved to suppress all evidence seized during the \r\n  search of his car on the basis that the affidavit and search warrant did not \r\n  set forth sufficient probable cause for police to search for evidence linking \r\n  him to McBrideâ€™s murder.  The court denied the motion to suppress.  The jury \r\n  convicted Tench on all counts and recommended a sentence of death.  The trial \r\n  court sentenced him to death for murder, life imprisonment for burglary, and \r\n  ten years for attempted armed robbery.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the court err in denying the motion to suppress the evidence \r\n  seized in the search of Tenchâ€™s automobile?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nTench asserts the search warrant was unsupported \r\n  by probable cause that evidence of any crime could be found in his car; accordingly, \r\n  he contends the trial court erred in refusing to suppress the evidence seized \r\n  therein.  We disagree.\r\nA search warrant may issue only upon a finding \r\n  of probable cause.  State v. Weston, 329 S.C. 287, 494 S.E.2d 801 (1997) \r\n  .  The magistrate's task in determining whether to issue a search warrant is \r\n  to make a practical, common sense decision concerning whether, under the totality \r\n  of the circumstances set forth in the affidavit, there is a fair probability \r\n  that evidence of a crime will be found in the particular place to be searched.  \r\n  Id. ; State v. Philpot, 317 S.C. 458, 454 S.E.2d 905 (Ct.App.1995) \r\n  .  A reviewing court should give great deference to a magistrate's determination \r\n  of probable cause.  State v. Crane, 296 S.C. 336, 372 S.E.2d 587 (1988) \r\n  .\r\nThe affidavit prepared by Investigator \r\n  Major provides: \r\n\r\nThat on or about 12:39 a.m. on January 12, 1999, \r\n  deputies from the Anderson County Sheriffâ€™s Office responded to shooting call \r\n  at 150 Cedar Road in Anderson, S.C.  On their arrival, they found Christopher \r\n  Dale Tench sitting in a chair at the kitchen table bleeding from his torso, \r\n  his left hand and both legs, an apparent victim of multiple gunshot wounds.  \r\n  Tench was able to inform the officers that he was shot near Broadway Lake.  \r\n  He could not, however, describe his assailant(s) nor provide a specific location \r\n  of the incident.  His mother, who was at the house, stated that Tench arrived \r\n  home driving his white with a burgundy half top 1977 Cadillac 2-Door Coupe de \r\n  Ville.  He exited the vehicle wounded and bleeding.  There is smeared blood \r\n  on the outside handle of the driverâ€™s door.  The driverâ€™s seat is blood soaked \r\n  and blood can been [sic] seen on the instrument panel and steering wheel.  An \r\n  Anderson County deputy sheriff located and recovered an apparent projectile \r\n  from the outside of the trousers worn by Tench.  It is the Affiantâ€™s belief \r\n  that based on these facts, items will be on or within the vehicle which will \r\n  indicate the manner, method, motive, cause, or perpetrators involved in the \r\n  shooting of Christopher Dale Tench.\r\n\r\nWe find the affidavit sufficiently establishes \r\n  probable cause.  The affidavit specifically notes that police recovered an â€œapparent \r\n  projectile from the outside of Tenchâ€™s trousers.â€  Police were aware that Tench \r\n  had driven the car home from the scene of the shooting and there was blood both \r\n  in and on the car.  Given that a projectile was recovered from Tenchâ€™s trousers, \r\n  we find police had a legitimate basis to believe that further projectiles could \r\n  feasibly be found in the car.  Further, in light of the fact that Tench did \r\n  not give police the precise location of the shooting, the police could feasibly \r\n  have believed he may have been shot at as he attempted to enter or exit the \r\n  vehicle, which would have provided a sufficient basis to search for projectiles \r\n  or shell casings in the vehicle.  Moreover, since Tench could not pinpoint for \r\n  police the exact location of the shooting, we find police had sufficient cause \r\n  to obtain tire impressions, to enable them to investigate matching impressions \r\n  at the alleged scene of the crime.  \r\nFinally, the affidavit authorized police to search \r\n  for evidence which would indicate the â€œmanner, method, motive, cause or perpetrators \r\n  involved in the shooting of Christopher Dale Tench.â€  Although Tench asserts \r\n  police were, in reality, attempting to search for evidence linking him to the \r\n  McBride murder, the simple fact of the matter is that any evidence which did \r\n  link Tench to that murder also tended to indicate the manner, method, motive \r\n  and perpetrator involved in shooting Tench.  Accordingly, we find the affidavit \r\n  established probable cause, and the trial court properly denied the motion to \r\n  suppress.  \r\nIn any event, even were we to find the \r\n  affidavit insufficient to establish probable cause, we would find any error \r\n  in admission of the seized evidence harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.  See \r\n  State v. Davis, 309 S.C. 326, 422 S.E.2d 133 (1992) (erroneous admission \r\n  of evidence may constitute harmless error if the evidence did not affect the \r\n  outcome of the trial), overruled on other grounds by Brightman v. \r\n  State, 336 S.C. 348, 520 S.E.2d 614 (1999); State v. Bernotas, 277 \r\n  S.C. 106, 283 S.E.2d 580 (1981) (for an error in the erroneous admission of \r\n  unlawfully seized evidence to require reversal, the appellant must be sufficiently \r\n  prejudiced).   \r\nIndependent of the items Tench sought \r\n  to have suppressed at trial, [1]  the state presented overwhelming evidence of \r\n  Tenchâ€™s guilt, to wit: 1) Tenchâ€™s confession to police in which he admitted \r\n  to breaking into McBrideâ€™s house and to shooting him, 2) blood found at the \r\n  victimâ€™s house which matched Tenchâ€™s DNA, \r\n  [2]  3) the bullet from Tenchâ€™s leg was consistent with the spent rounds \r\n  found at the scene, 4) a shoe print found at the scene was consistent with prints \r\n  of Tenchâ€™s tennis shoes, and 5) some unfired .44 cartridges which police obtained \r\n  from Darvin Davis, the man from whom Tench purchased a .44 caliber pistol several \r\n  hours prior to the shooting.  \r\nGiven the abundant evidence of Tenchâ€™s \r\n  guilt, we find any error in admission of the seized items clearly harmless beyond \r\n  a reasonable doubt.  State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d 617 (1997) \r\n  (failure to suppress evidence is harmless where record contains overwhelming \r\n  evidence of guilt).  \r\nAs this is the direct appeal of Tenchâ€™s \r\n  death sentence, we must conduct a proportionality review pursuant to S.C.

Nuessle, Family Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25619\r\nHeard March 5, 2003 - Filed April 7, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nJames T. McLaren and C. Dixon Lee, III, of Columbia; and Timothy \r\n  S. Mirshak, of Augusta, Georgia, for Petitioner.\r\nRobert L. Widener, of McNair Law Firm, P.A., Columbia; for \r\n  Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: In this \r\n  divorce case, we granted certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision \r\n  in Thomas v. Thomas, 346 S.C. 20, 550 S.E.2d 580 (Ct. App. 2001).  We \r\n  affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nAngela Thomas (Wife) and Kevin M. Thomas (Husband) \r\n  were married on May 2, 1992.  Both parties had previously been married, and \r\n  they each have two children from their prior respective marriages.  No children \r\n  were born to this marriage, however.\r\nIn early August 1995, Wife bought a Georgia \r\n  lottery ticket.  One of the â€œquick-picksâ€ on the ticket turned out to be the \r\n  winning numbers for the $9 million grand prize, paid in annual installments \r\n  over 20 years. [1]   The lottery prize was claimed in Wifeâ€™s name \r\n  only.  Although Wife testified that she always purchased the lottery tickets \r\n  with her â€œpocket money,â€ Husband stated that both he and Wife bought lottery \r\n  tickets during the marriage.  Husband also testified that he and Wife agreed \r\n  to put the prize in her name so his former wife would not â€œcome afterâ€ him for \r\n  more child support.\r\nWife, who worked as a clerk at the Veterans Administration \r\n  Hospital, immediately terminated her employment upon winning the lottery.  Approximately \r\n  one year later, Husband left his employment at D.S.M. Chemical.  When they left \r\n  their employment, Wife earned almost $20,000 per year, and Husband earned between \r\n  $40,000 and $50,000 per year depending on overtime.\r\nFrom the time Wife won the lottery until \r\n  the partiesâ€™ separation, the lottery money clearly was used by both of them \r\n  as marital income.  For example, they made significant improvements to the marital \r\n  home, opened joint investment accounts, and also purchased a $225,000 lake house.\r\nWife and Husband separated on November 3, 1997, \r\n  after a physical altercation occurred between them. \r\n  [2]   Wife filed for divorce on the ground of physical abuse.  Husband also \r\n  filed for divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s continuous separation.  In 1999, \r\n  the family court granted Husband a divorce on the ground of one yearâ€™s separation.  \r\n  The parties agreed to the division of almost all of the property in the marital \r\n  estate; therefore, the main issue at the divorce hearing was the division of \r\n  the lottery proceeds.  Noting that the issue was a novel one in South Carolina, \r\n  the family court found the lottery proceeds were marital property, applied the \r\n  New York case of Ullah v. Ullah, 555 N.Y.S.2d 834 (N.Y. App. Div. 1990), \r\n  and awarded 50 per cent of the remaining lottery proceeds to Husband.  The family \r\n  court also stated in its order that it had considered the fifteen statutory \r\n  factors for the equitable apportionment of marital property.  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2002). \r\nWife appealed, arguing, inter alia, that \r\n  the family court failed to apply the relevant statutory factors in determining \r\n  equitable division of the lottery proceeds.  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the family courtâ€™s 50% award of the \r\n  lottery proceeds to Husband?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWife argues the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  by failing to reverse the family courtâ€™s application of the â€œfortuitous circumstancesâ€ \r\n  rule of Ullah v. Ullah.  She further argues the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  by applying the statutory factors but not adopting this as the legal rule to \r\n  be used for the division of lottery proceeds.  Finally, Wife contends the family \r\n  court erred in evenly splitting the lottery prize and that this Court should \r\n  award her a greater share in the winnings. \r\n  [3] \r\n\r\nAlthough in the instant case the Court \r\n  of Appeals clearly applied the statutory factors to affirm the family courtâ€™s \r\n  50% award to Husband, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is arguably ambiguous on \r\n  the novel issue of how the family court should properly divide lottery winnings \r\n  in a divorce action.   As noted by the Court of Appeals, a review of the relevant \r\n  case law reveals that two approaches have evolved -- the so-called â€œfortuitous \r\n  circumstancesâ€ rule or the statutory factor analysis.\r\n\r\nThe fortuitous circumstances rule can \r\n  be traced to Ullah v. Ullah, a New York case.  In that case, Mr. Ullah \r\n  purchased a New York State â€œLottoâ€ ticket and won $8 million, payable in 21 \r\n  annual installments.  Within months after winning, Mr. and Mrs. Ullah resigned \r\n  from their jobs.  Ullah v. Ullah, 555 N.Y.S.2d at 835.  In their divorce \r\n  action, Mr. Ullah appealed from a judgment that awarded his wife an equal share \r\n  of the winnings.  The Ullah court affirmed, stating as follows:\r\n\r\nWhile a guiding principle of equitable distribution is that \r\n  parties are entitled to receive equitable awards which are proportionate to \r\n  their contributions to the marriage, â€¦ in the instant case the contributions \r\n  each spouse made prior to winning the prize have little relevance to the manner \r\n  in which the lottery jackpot should be distributed.  This award was won \r\n  through sheer luck, against odds of 12,913,583 to one.  As [the trial \r\n  court] aptly recognized, this enormous return required â€œlittle effort or investmentâ€.  \r\n  As it was predominately the result of fortuitous circumstances and not the \r\n  result of either spouseâ€™s toil or labor, we find that an equal division of this \r\n  jackpot was entirely appropriate.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added, citations omitted).\r\nAn alternative view is found in Alston \r\n  v. Alston, 629 A.2d 70 (Md. 1993).  The Alston court applied Marylandâ€™s \r\n  equitable distribution statute on the issue of how to divide Mr. Alstonâ€™s lottery \r\n  prize of over $1 million.  Mr. Alston purchased the winning lottery ticket after \r\n  the parties had separated, and after Mrs. Alston had filed for divorce.  \r\n  Mrs. Alston initially sought divorce based on the coupleâ€™s voluntary separation \r\n  for over one year; she did not seek alimony or a monetary award.  However, after \r\n  she learned that her husband had won the lottery, Mrs. Alston immediately dismissed \r\n  the initial divorce complaint.  She filed a second complaint approximately six \r\n  months later for divorce on the ground of adultery and for a monetary award \r\n  based on the lottery annuity.  The trial court granted Mrs. Alston a divorce \r\n  because of Mr. Alstonâ€™s adultery and granted her 50% of the lottery proceeds.  \r\n  The intermediate appellate court affirmed, but that decision was reversed by \r\n  the Alston court.  \r\nThe Alston court discussed in depth the \r\n  history and purpose of the equitable distribution statute, commenting that â€œthe \r\n  General Assembly was primarily concerned with achieving equity by reflecting \r\n  non-monetary contributions of the acquisition of marital assets.â€  Id. \r\n  at 75.  The court stated that â€œno hard and fast rule can be laid downâ€ regarding \r\n  the division of lottery winnings and that â€œeach case must depend upon its own \r\n  circumstances to insure that equity be accomplished.â€  Id.  \r\nNonetheless, the Alston court noted that \r\n  the eighth factor in the statute, regarding â€œhow and when specific marital propertyâ€ \r\n  was acquired and the contribution that each party made toward its acquisition, \r\n  â€œshould be given considerable weight.â€  Id.  In addition, the Alston \r\n  court stated the following:\r\n\r\nWhere one party, wholly through his or her own efforts, and \r\n  without any direct or indirect contribution by the other, acquires a specific \r\n  item of marital property after the parties have separated and after the marital \r\n  family has, as a practical matter, ceased to exist, a monetary award representing \r\n  an equal division of that particular property would not ordinarily be consonant \r\n  with the history and purpose of the statute.\r\n\r\nId. at 76 (emphasis added).  Thus, finding \r\n  that the record contained â€œno evidence which would justify awarding any portion \r\n  of the annuity to Mrs. Alston,â€ the court reversed Mrs. Alstonâ€™s 50% award and \r\n  remanded for the trial court to revisit the issue of alimony.  Id. at \r\n  77.  \r\nThe court in DeVane v. DeVane, 655 A.2d \r\n  970 (N.J. Super. 1995), succinctly summarized the two approaches as follows:\r\n\r\nTwo distinct rules have emerged concerning the manner in which \r\n  lottery winnings should be disbursed between the parties on the dissolution \r\n  of the marriage and distribution of marital assets.  One rule, represented by \r\n  Ullah, emphasizes that the asset is a windfall and was not created due \r\n  to the efforts of either party; therefore, it should be divided equally.â€¦  The \r\n  other rule is represented by [Alston], which holds that the court should \r\n  apply the factors guiding equitable distribution â€¦ to arrive at an appropriate \r\n  distribution decision.\r\n\r\nId. at 971 (citations omitted).  The DeVane \r\n  court concluded that the trial judge should apply all the factors set forth \r\n  in the New Jersey equitable distribution statute and â€œdistribute the marital \r\n  assets consistent with the unique needs of the parties.â€  Id. at 972.\r\nIn South Carolina, the law of \r\n  equitable distribution â€œis premised on providing the family court the flexibility \r\n  to view each case based on the individual circumstances peculiar to the parties \r\n  involved and to fashion a division of the partiesâ€™ assets in a manner that is \r\n  uniquely fair to the parties concerned.â€  Marsh v. Marsh, 313 S.C. 42, \r\n  46, 437 S.E.2d 34, 36 (1993).  Because we can foresee numerous scenarios where \r\n  a mechanistic, 50-50 split would be inequitable, we reject the fortuitous circumstances \r\n  rule. [4]   Instead, we hold that \r\n  the statutory factor analysis is the proper method for determining the equitable \r\n  apportionment of lottery proceeds.  Equity will best be served if the family \r\n  court has at its disposal all the factors enumerated in the statute thereby \r\n  allowing the court to take into consideration â€œthe unique needs of the parties.â€  \r\n  DeVane, 655 A.2d at 972; see also Marsh, supra.  \r\n  Accordingly, when the family court is faced with this issue in the future, the \r\n  15 statutory factors found in the equitable apportionment statute should be \r\n  the family courtâ€™s guide.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-472 (Supp. 2002). \r\n\r\nNevertheless, we note that the \r\n  third and fifteenth statutory factors likely will be given particular attention \r\n  in a case such as this.  See Alston, supra.  The third \r\n  factor requires the family court to take into consideration â€œthe value of the \r\n  marital propertyâ€ and â€œthe contribution of each spouse to the acquisition, preservation, \r\n  depreciation, or appreciation in value of the marital property, including the \r\n  contribution of the spouse as homemaker; provided, that the court shall consider \r\n  the quality of the contribution as well as its factual existence.â€  The fifteenth \r\n  factor is a â€œcatchallâ€ which provides that the family court consider â€œsuch other \r\n  relevant factors as the trial court shall expressly enumerate in its order.â€  \r\n  Clearly, the family court should take into consideration the fact that winning \r\n  the lottery is a lucky occurrence producing what is, in essence, a windfall \r\n  to the marriage.\r\nTurning to the facts of the instant \r\n  case, the Court of Appeals applied the statutory factors to affirm the family \r\n  courtâ€™s 50% award to Husband.  Wife asserts that because she purchased the lottery \r\n  ticket, her contribution should be considered greater thereby entitling her \r\n  to more than a 50% share of the lottery proceeds.  However, we agree with the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that â€œan equal distribution was fair and equitable \r\n  under the facts and circumstances of this case.â€  Thomas, 346 S.C. at \r\n  27, 550 S.E.2d at 583.    Although Wife bought the ticket, the facts of this \r\n  case plainly show that prior to their separation, the parties jointly shared \r\n  the winnings.  Wife cannot escape the fact that this was a windfall to the marriage \r\n  resulting from the luck of the draw.  We find a 50-50 split to be the appropriate, \r\n  equitable apportionment of the lottery proceeds.\r\nFurthermore, we agree with the \r\n  Court of Appeals that the family courtâ€™s order indicated that the statutory \r\n  factors indeed were considered.  The family court did more than merely state \r\n  in its order that it had considered the factors.  Instead, the family court \r\n  made numerous findings of fact which clearly evidence its consideration of the \r\n  statutory factors. [5]   Therefore, the Court of Appeals \r\n  properly affirmed.  E.g., Jenkins v. Jenkins, 345 S.C. 88, 545 \r\n  S.E.2d 531 (Ct. App. 2001) (if it can be determined that the family court addressed \r\n  the factors under section 20-7-472 sufficiently for the appellate court to conclude \r\n  the court was cognizant of the statutory factors, then the family courtâ€™s decision \r\n  will be affirmed).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn sum, we adopt \r\n  the statutory factor analysis as the appropriate method for the equitable division \r\n  of lottery proceeds in a divorce action.  We affirm the decision to evenly split \r\n  the lottery winnings between Husband and Wife.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  The pre-tax payments are $447,000 each, with the final payment in \r\n    the amount of $485,000.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  The parties had several problems throughout their marriage.  According \r\n    to Wife, Husband abused alcohol and acted inappropriately when intoxicated.  \r\n    They also had problems during the marriage arising from their respective children.  \r\n    Attempts at marriage counseling were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  We note that the family court correctly found the lottery proceeds \r\n    to be marital property, and neither party has appealed this finding.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  For example, if a spouse buys a winning lottery ticket after the \r\n    parties have separated, but before they have divorced, the family court should \r\n    be able to take that into consideration.  See Alston, supra \r\n    (where, in reversing a 50-50 award, the court seemed to place heavy emphasis \r\n    on the fact that at the time the husband purchased the lottery ticket, â€œthe \r\n    marital family ha[d], as a practical matter, ceased to existâ€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  For example, the family court detailed the duration of the marriage, \r\n    the partiesâ€™ respective situations regarding the children from their previous \r\n    marriages, and their health.  The family court also noted that Husband and \r\n    Wife both:  have a high school education, provided income to the marriage \r\n    as well as other non-economic contributions, and are the same age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25620","title":"State v.

In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of a six month suspension, \r\n  retroactive to July 11, 2002, the date he was placed on interim suspension.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and impose a six month suspension, retroactive to the \r\n  date of his interim suspension.  The facts as set forth in the agreement are \r\n  as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was subpoenaed as a potential witness in a case \r\n  tried before Horry County Magistrate Marjorie B. Livingston. [1]   Before adjourning for lunch, Judge Livingston \r\n  directed the witnesses, including respondent, not to discuss the case during \r\n  the lunch break.  \r\nPrior to resuming the trial, Judge Livingston was informed by defense counsel \r\n  that several witnesses reported respondent had spoken to them about the case \r\n  during the lunch break.  During an in camera hearing, several \r\n  people reported that they had seen respondent sitting and talking with one of \r\n  the defense witnesses.  \r\nOne witness testified, during the in camera hearing, that she \r\n  overheard respondent state to the witness he was sitting with, &quot;remember \r\n  now, don't answer anything they don't ask you.&quot;  The witness respondent \r\n  had been seen sitting with and talking to confirmed he had had such a conversation \r\n  with respondent. [2]   Another \r\n  witness stated respondent had also attempted to talk to her about the trial, \r\n  but she told him the conversation was improper.  \r\nRespondent denied having any conversations with the witnesses regarding the \r\n  merits of the case and denied sitting with any of the witnesses.  Respondent \r\n  admitted he had asked one of the witnesses what the witness thought about the \r\n  situation.  Respondent testified the witness stated, &quot;it's just two adults \r\n  with [a] misunderstanding,&quot; and respondent stated, &quot;well, fine, I \r\n  agree with that, fine.&quot;  Respondent also maintained the witness initiated \r\n  a conversation about whether respondent liked Atlantic Beach and about respondent's \r\n  relationship with Atlantic Beach police.  Respondent stated he told the witness, \r\n  &quot;remember, I didn't discuss anything with you about this case period.  \r\n  I did not discuss anything with you about this case because you have not testified \r\n  and I was instructed not to discuss anything and I did not.&quot;    Based on \r\n  respondent's communications with witnesses during the lunch break, Judge Livingston \r\n  granted the defendant's motion to dismiss the case. \r\nRespondent now acknowledges that portions of his testimony \r\n  during the in camera hearing were incorrect, particularly his \r\n  testimony that he did not sit with one of the witnesses and had not discussed \r\n  the case with any of the witnesses.  Respondent agrees that the circumstances \r\n  of the events during the lunch break were substantially as set forth in the \r\n  testimony of the other witnesses given during the in camera hearing. \r\n\r\nLaw\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following Canons \r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct: Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold the integrity \r\n  and independence of the judiciary); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety \r\n  and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's activities); Canon 2(A) \r\n  (a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in \r\n  a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of \r\n  the judiciary); Canon 3 (a judge shall perform the duties of judicial office \r\n  impartially and diligently); Canon 3(A) (the judicial duties of a judge take \r\n  precedence over all the judge's other activities); Canon 3(B)(2) (a judge shall \r\n  be faithful to the law and maintain professional competence in it; a judge shall \r\n  not be swayed by partisan interests, public clamor or fear of criticism); Canon \r\n  3(B)(9) (a judge shall not, while a proceeding is pending or impending in any \r\n  court, make any public comment that might reasonably be expected to affect its \r\n  outcome or impair its fairness or make an nonpublic comment that might substantially \r\n  interfere with a fair trial or hearing); Canon 4 (a judge shall conduct extra-judicial \r\n  activities so as to minimize the risk of conflict with judicial obligations); \r\n  Canon 4(A)(1) (a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities \r\n  so that they do not cast reasonable doubt on the judge's capacity to act impartially \r\n  as a judge); Canon 4(A)(2) (a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial \r\n  activities so that they do not demean the judicial office); and Canon 4(A)(3) \r\n  (a judge shall conduct all of the judge's extra-judicial activities so that \r\n  they do no interfere with the proper performance of judicial duties).\r\nBy violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also violated Rule \r\n  7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.  \r\n  He also violated Rule 7(a)(7), RJDE, by willfully violating a valid court order \r\n  issued by a court of this state.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a suspension from \r\n  judicial duties.  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and suspend respondent for six months, retroactive to July 11, 2002, the date \r\n  of his interim suspension.  \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [1]    This case involved a charge of simple assault \r\n    and battery against the Interim Chief of Police for Atlantic Beach.  The charge \r\n    arose from an altercation between the Interim Chief and respondent's brother \r\n    at an Atlantic Beach Town Council meeting.  Respondent was not present at \r\n    the meeting and, therefore, did not witness the events giving rise to the \r\n    charge; however, he was subpoenaed as a witness by the defense.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]    The witness testified he felt compelled to sit \r\n    with respondent, although he knew it was a violation of Judge's Livingston's \r\n    instructions, because respondent was the judge at J. Reuben Long Detention \r\n    Center where the witness had previously been detained on a public intoxication \r\n    charge and other minor offenses.  The witness also testified respondent asked \r\n    him what he thought of the situation that gave rise to the charges against \r\n    the Interim Chief and stated he did not like Atlantic Beach and that he did \r\n    not have anything to do with the municipality.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25622","title":"State v.

Doe v. The Ward \r\n  Law Firm, P.A., Op. No. 2001-UP-377 (S.C. Ct. App. Filed July 26, 2001). \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nThe Does adopted Child by Order of the Spartanburg \r\n  County family court on December 23, 1983.  Child has experienced a host of medical \r\n  ailments including both physical and mental problems.  Within the first months \r\n  of Childâ€™s life he began experiencing respiratory difficulties which persist \r\n  to this day.  Doctors have diagnosed Child with a cyst located on his brain.  \r\n  He has also experienced delayed puberty.\r\nAt about six years of age, Child began to experience \r\n  separation anxiety after father Doe suffered a heart attack.  Childâ€™s mental \r\n  health worsened when, at age thirteen, he began experiencing severe and violent \r\n  mood swings.  Childâ€™s violent tendencies culminated with physical confrontations \r\n  with both parents.  In one incident Child threatened mother Doe with a knife.  \r\n  In another, he destroyed the tendons and cartilage in her finger.  Those violent \r\n  tendencies have also been directed at himself resulting in self-mutilation and \r\n  expressions of a desire to commit suicide.  \r\nThe Does have attempted to help Child through medical and psychiatric \r\n  care, including commitment to mental institutions on three separate occasions.  \r\n  A variety of psychiatrists, psychologists and neurologists examined him.  In \r\n  spite of such treatment, Child has failed to respond to therapy and has suffered \r\n  severe reaction to some forms of medicinal treatment.\r\nAt the family court hearing, Does submitted letters of several doctors \r\n  suggesting knowledge of childâ€™s biological familyâ€™s medical history would be \r\n  important in diagnosing and treating Child.  One psychologist stated he â€œsuspect[ed] \r\n  that certain inherited predispositions, genetic weaknesses, possible congenital \r\n  and/or birth delivery toxicity or trauma may have been factors in [Childâ€™s] \r\n  present academic, personality and behavioral deficits.â€\r\nFor this reason, the Does petitioned the family court to \r\n  permit the Does to view Childâ€™s adoption file held by the Ward Law Firm. [1]   In the alternative, Does petitioned \r\n  for access to the Clerk of Courtâ€™s adoption records.  In both instances, Does \r\n  requested the family court appoint an intermediary to review the files and only \r\n  divulge non-identifying information of the biological parents.\r\nThe family court declined to require Law Firm to allow \r\n  Does to review its adoption file.  The court found it lacked subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction to address the issue because it was â€œa contract matter between \r\n  the attorney and plaintiffs and not an issue incident to the adoption.â€  Addressing \r\n  the merits, the court found Law Firm was not an agency or category of persons \r\n  contemplated by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(C) (Supp. 2001) (allowing a family \r\n  court to grant access to an authorized agencyâ€™s adoption records).  Further, \r\n  the family court found the Does had not shown â€œgood causeâ€ required by S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(B) (Supp. 2001).  The Court of Appeals affirmed.  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the Does did not show â€œgood causeâ€ to \r\n  obtain the Clerk of Courtâ€™s adoption file?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding the Does could not review Childâ€™s adoption \r\n  files housed by the Ward Law Firm?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       III.\r\n       Did the Court of \r\n  Appeals err in holding the family court should not appoint an intermediary to \r\n  review Childâ€™s adoption files and to contact the biological parents to obtain \r\n  necessary information?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nClerk of Courtâ€™s Adoption Files\r\nBoth the family court and the \r\n  Court of Appeals relied upon our ruling in Bradey v. Childrenâ€™s Bureau of \r\n  South Carolina, 275 S.C. 622, 274 S.E.2d 418 (1981), to deny the Does an \r\n  opportunity to review the adoption record filed with the Clerk of Court.  In \r\n  Bradey, Bradey sought to compel release of identifying information about \r\n  his biological parents.  As in the present case, the statute at issue prevented \r\n  the dissemination of adoption information absent â€œgood causeâ€ shown.  \r\n  [2] \r\nWe began our analysis in Bradey \r\n  by discussing the privacy interests of the parties to the adoption.  We held \r\n  a party could not show the required good cause absent a compelling need for \r\n  identifying information about the biological parents.  Absent a compelling need, \r\n  the veil of privacy surrounding the biological parents could not be lifted.\r\nAlthough the Bradey decision \r\n  did not specifically define \r\nâ€˜compelling needâ€™, we noted Bradey \r\n  did not fall into â€œthe relatively small group of adoptees whose psychological \r\n  needs are compelling[]â€ sufficiently to warrant violating the biological parentsâ€™ \r\n  privacy.  Id. at 628, 274 S.E.2d at 422 (quoting Application \r\n  of Maples, 563 S.W.2d 760, 763-64 (Mo. 1978)).  We further noted that Bradeyâ€™s \r\n  insecurities in not knowing the identity of his biological parents did not interfere \r\n  with his ability to maintain steady employment and have a stable family life \r\n  of his own.  Bradey, 275 at 629, 274 S.E.2d at 422.\r\nGood cause, therefore, required \r\n  an individual show a compelling need to remove the veil of privacy from the \r\n  biological parents.  The compelling need itself was demonstrated by a variety \r\n  of factors including the medical or mental health of the adopted child and whether \r\n  not having the information impaired the childâ€™s ability to lead a stable, productive \r\n  life.\r\nCentral to \r\n  the analysis of both courts below is Bradeyâ€™s reliance on confidentiality \r\n  in the adoption process and the presumption that such confidentiality should \r\n  be maintained absent an extraordinary, compelling need.  While we do not disagree \r\n  with such rationale nor do we overturn Bradey, it is important to note \r\n  that, since the Bradey decision, the adoption code has undergone expansive \r\n  revision.  See 1986 Act No. 464; 1986 Act No. 525; see also  \r\n  1981 Act No. 71 Â§ 3 repealing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-45-140(c) (1976).          \r\nSouth Carolina adoption law continues \r\n  to provide that all papers and records pertaining to an adoption are confidential \r\n  and must be sealed to prevent inspection absent a showing of good cause. [3]   See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  20-7-1780 (Supp. 2001) (â€œNo person may have access to the records except for \r\n  good cause shown by order of the judge of the court in which the decree of adoption \r\n  was entered.â€).  However, we must now be mindful when balancing the privacy \r\n  rights of each party with the interests of the child that the Legislature has \r\n  determined the best interests of the child should prevail.  See S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1647 (Supp. 2001) The Legislatureâ€™s stated purpose in enacting \r\n  the changes contained in the Adoption Act:\r\n\r\nis to establish fair and reasonable \r\n  procedures for the adoption of children and to provide for the well-being of \r\n  the child, with full recognition of the interdependent needs and interests of \r\n  the biological parents and the adoptive parents. However, when the interests \r\n  of a child and an adult are in conflict, the conflict must be resolved in \r\n  favor of the child.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nAccordingly, \r\n  we are presented the task of determining whether the Does presented â€œgood causeâ€ \r\n  why releasing such information would be in Childâ€™s best interests.  The Does \r\n  have done so.\r\nApart from Childâ€™s physical difficulties \r\n  with respiratory problems and a cyst on his brain, the Does have demonstrated \r\n  the need to obtain the information for Childâ€™s mental health.  Childâ€™s behavioral \r\n  history shows him to be dangerous to himself and his immediate family.  Having \r\n  shown that it is in the best interests of their child to obtain these confidential \r\n  records they are entitled to view â€œall papers and records pertaining to the \r\n  adoption and filed with the [Spartanburg County] clerk of court.â€  S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(B).\r\nII\r\nLaw Firmâ€™s Adoption Files\r\nThe Does believe S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 20-7-1780(D) provides access to the Law Firmâ€™s adoption files.  We disagree.\r\nThe statute allows an agency to \r\n  furnish â€œadoptive parents, biological parents, or adoptees nonidentifying information \r\n  when in the sole discretion of the chief executive officer of the agency the \r\n  information would serve the best interests of the persons concerned either during \r\n  the period of placement or at a subsequent time . . .â€  Id.  Under the \r\n  Doesâ€™ theory, the Law Firm is an agency, which is required to release their \r\n  files to Does if shown to be in Childâ€™s best interests.  We disagree.\r\nEach partyâ€™s \r\n  argument in their respective brief and at oral argument centered upon whether \r\n  a law firm is an agency based upon S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(D) and S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1650(E).  We do not feel compelled to answer the question presently \r\n  where, assuming arguendo the law firm is an agency, the statute vests the decision \r\n  whether to release information to the â€œsole discretion of the chief executive \r\n  officer of the agency.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(D).  As Law Firm consistently \r\n  exercised its discretion to deny the release of Childâ€™s adoption files, the \r\n  Doesâ€™ reliance on Â§20-7-1780(D) would not aid in obtaining the files, even if \r\n  Law Firm were an agency according to the statute.\r\nThis conclusion does not leave \r\n  Does without a remedy.  Absent \r\nany statutory limitation on this \r\n  Courtâ€™s ability to compel Law Firm to release its adoption file, the intent \r\n  of the Legislature in such circumstances is that, in the face of competing interests, \r\n  the best interests of the Child be the paramount concern.  [4]   See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-1647. \r\nThe Does have shown \r\n  good cause why the release of Law Firmâ€™s adoption file is in Childâ€™s best interests.  \r\n  Therefore, the Does may obtain information contained within Law Firmâ€™s file \r\n  if a search of the Clerk of Courtâ€™s file does not reveal the necessary information.\r\nIII\r\nAppointment \r\n  of Intermediary\r\nThe opinions of both the family \r\n  court and Court of Appeals have correctly stressed the need to protect the identity \r\n  of parties in an adoption because privacy is vital to the success of adoption \r\n  as public policy.  The Does have consistently maintained their desire throughout \r\n  these proceedings to receive only non-identifying information about the biological \r\n  parents in order to help Child.  Their attitude is consistent with the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent to protect the privacy of all parties to an adoption by limiting the \r\n  dissemination of identifying information.  See, e.g., S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 20-7-1780(A) (closing adoption hearings to the general public); Â§ 20-7-1780(D) \r\n  (allowing an agency under certain circumstances to furnish adoptive parents \r\n  with â€œnon-identifyingâ€ information); Â§ 20-7-1780(E) (regulating the way agencies \r\n  may release identifying information to adoptive child of biological parents \r\n  and biological siblings; regulating the way agencies may release identifying \r\n  information to biological parents and biological siblings of adoptive child); \r\n  Â§ 20-7-1780(F) (making it a misdemeanor to furnish adoptive child or biological \r\n  parents/siblings identifying information).  \r\nHowever, if Does show â€œgood causeâ€ \r\n  under Â§ 20-7-1780 they may have access to all information included in the Clerk \r\n  of Courtâ€™s records on Childâ€™s adoption.  The Does would also obtain identifying \r\n  information when reviewing Law Firmâ€™s adoption file.  The Legislature requires \r\n  we defer to the best interests of the child when a conflict arises between the \r\n  adopted child and privacy interests of the parties.  In this case we may both \r\n  promote the best interests of the child and the privacy rights of each party \r\n  by the appointment of an intermediary.\r\nIt is in Childâ€™s best interests \r\n  to have access to the file but it is not essential, to help Child, that Does \r\n  receive identifying information about the biological parents.  By appointing \r\n  a trained, confidential intermediary to review the file, contact the biological \r\n  parents, if necessary, and prepare a report for the family courtâ€™s review, we \r\n  fulfill the childâ€™s best interests while maintaining the privacy of parties \r\n  to an adoption.  The family court possesses the power to appoint such an intermediary.  \r\n  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(3) (1976) (empowering the family court \r\n  to â€œmake any order necessary to carry out and enforce the provisions of [the \r\n  Childrenâ€™s Code]â€).  \r\nColorado law is instructive on the intermediaryâ€™s status.  There, courts may \r\n  appoint a â€œtrained confidential intermediaryâ€ to determine the whereabouts of \r\n  an adopteeâ€™s biological relatives.  See Colo. Rev. Stat. Ann. Â§ 19-5-304 \r\n  et. seq. (Supp. 1992); see also, In re Tomlinson, \r\n  851 P.2d 170 (Colo. 1993).  The intermediary is considered an officer of the \r\n  court and is required to guard any information received as confidential. [5]   See id.  \r\nMore relevant to the circumstances of this case, New York allows courts to \r\n  appoint a guardian ad litem or â€œother disinterested person, who shall have access \r\n  to the adoption records for the purpose of obtaining the medical information \r\n  sought and consent to disclose the information from those records or, where \r\n  the records are insufficient for such purpose, through contacting the biological \r\n  parents.â€  N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law Â§ 114(4) (McKinney 1999).  The intermediary â€œserves \r\n  as a filter, obtaining the records and extracting the needed information, which \r\n  is then passed on to the petitioner.â€  N.Y. Dom. Rel. Law Â§ 114, prac. cmt. \r\n  The court, upon receiving the intermediaryâ€™s report, reviews it in camera, \r\n  redacts any identifying information, and discloses the balance of the report \r\n  to the adoptee.  See id.; see also, Chattman \r\n  v. Bennett, 393 N.Y.S.2d 768, 769 (N.Y. App. Div. 1977) (allowing court \r\n  to â€œmake available to petitioner, from the file pertaining to her adoption, \r\n  her medical records and those of her natural parents, as well as any other material \r\n  therein relating to possible genetic or hereditary conditions, while deleting \r\n  therefrom any nonpertinent information, including the names of the natural parents.â€).\r\nWe believe the appointment of \r\n  an intermediary is appropriate under the circumstances of this case.  The intermediary \r\n  shall be independent of any party to the suit and be trained as a guardian ad \r\n  litem or as an attorney.  The intermediary will serve as a liaison between the \r\n  court and the biological parents.  It is the duty of the intermediary to review \r\n  the adoption files and contact the biological parents, if necessary to obtain \r\n  the information sought by the Does.  The intermediary shall treat any information \r\n  received as strictly confidential.\r\nAt the conclusion of the research, \r\n  the intermediary shall issue a report detailing the information received while \r\n  redacting any information which identifies the biological relatives.  The family \r\n  court judge shall then review the report in camera to determine \r\n  whether the intermediary has furnished all pertinent information while maintaining \r\n  the confidentiality of the biological parents.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe REVERSE and REMAND this matter \r\n  to the family court for proceedings consistent with this opinion.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, \r\n  JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   \r\n    The attorney who handled Childâ€™s adoption is deceased.  The Ward Law Firm \r\n    has possession of his files.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   The Bradey statute read: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  All files and records pertaining to the adoption proceedings \r\n    in the Childrenâ€™s Bureau in the State of South Carolina, or in the Department \r\n    of Social Services of the State of South Carolina, or in any authorized agency, \r\n    shall be confidential and withheld from inspection except upon order of court \r\n    for good cause shown.\r\n  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-45-140(c) (1976) repealed 1981 \r\n    Act No. 71 Â§ 3, eff. May 19, 1981.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   \r\n    State law currently mandates the family court require a background investigation \r\n    of biological parents before allowing an adoption.  See S.C. Code Ann. \r\n    Â§ 20-7-1740(A)(3) (Supp. 2001).  The investigative report must include certain \r\n    non-identifying information about the biological parents including â€œa medical \r\n    history of the biological family of the adoptee, including parents, siblings, \r\n    and other family members related to the adoptee including ages, sex, race, \r\n    and any known genetic, psychological, metabolic, or familial disorders . . \r\n    .â€  S.C. Code Â§ 20-7-1740(A)(3)(a) (Supp. 2001).  The medical history requirement \r\n    did not take effect until three years after Childâ€™s adoption.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [4]&nbsp; Law Firm argues as additional sustaining \r\n    grounds that the release of its adoption file raises attorney work product \r\n    and attorney-client privilege problems.  See Iâ€™on, L.L.C. v. Town \r\n    of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000) (Prevailing party \r\n    at trial may raise additional sustaining grounds for appellate court to affirm \r\n    as long as the grounds appear in the record on appeal).  While Law Firm raised \r\n    the issues of both attorney-client privilege and work product privilege at \r\n    trial we do not believe they have shown the information to be privileged.  \r\n    See Rivers v. Rivers, 292 S.C. 21, 354 S.E.2d 784 (Ct. App. \r\n    1987) (the trial judge determines whether a communication is privileged after \r\n    making a preliminary inquiry into the facts and circumstances surrounding \r\n    the communication); Cf. Rule 26(b)(5), SCRCP.  Further, the record \r\n    does not make clear the identity of the client. If it were the Does, they \r\n    may waive the attorney-client privilege.  See Rule 407, SCACR, Rules \r\n    of Prof. Conduct, Rule 1.6(a); State v. Hitopoulus, 279 S.C. 549, 551, \r\n    309 S.E.2d 747, 749 (1983).  \r\n\r\n \r\n  [5]&nbsp; The primary purpose of appointing an intermediary \r\n    under the Colorado statute is to arrange for the adoptee and relative to contact \r\n    each other directly.  It is not to conduct an independent investigation to \r\n    gather pertinent facts or medical histories while maintaining the confidentialities \r\n    of all parties.  As such, Coloradoâ€™s â€œtrained confidential intermediaryâ€ statute \r\n    is not unique.  See, e.g., Ga. Dom. Rel. Code Â§ 19-8-23; Ala \r\n    Code Â§ 25-10A-31(h)-(j).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25624","title":"Dawkins v.

Fields, 345 S.C. 23, 545 S.E.2d 515 (Ct. App. 2001).  We \r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS / PROCEDURAL HISTORY \r\nRespondents Lamar W. Dawkins and George W. Chisholm, \r\n  shareholders of Seaside Development Corporation (Seaside), brought suit against \r\n  Seasideâ€™s directors and officers and a shareholder corporation, alleging common \r\n  law breach of fiduciary duty, violation of statutory standards for directors, \r\n  corporate oppression, and violation of preemptive rights.  The trial court granted \r\n  petitionersâ€™ motion for summary judgment.  Dawkins and Chisholm appealed, and \r\n  the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Dawkins, supra.\r\nSeaside was formed in 1959 for the purpose of acquiring \r\n  and holding real property on Hilton Head Island.  Seaside purchased a large \r\n  tract of land along Burkes Beach Road.  The intent was to subdivide the land \r\n  on the north side of Burkes Beach Road for individual residential purposes but \r\n  to keep intact, and eventually sell, the 18-plus acres on the south side.  In \r\n  January 1996, Seaside agreed to sell the south side tract to the Town of Hilton \r\n  Head Island for $1.2 million.\r\nRespondents allege in their complaint that Seasideâ€™s \r\n  directors schemed to increase their proportional interest in the shares of the \r\n  corporation.  Respondents challenge the propriety of three different stock issuances \r\n  - 180 shares in August 1995, 205 shares in January 1996, and 330 shares in July \r\n  1996.  Respondents allege the share price, although issued at the par value \r\n  of $100, was â€œgrossly inadequateâ€ and that the authorization of the stock sales \r\n  was without an appropriate business purpose.  Respondents contend that Seasideâ€™s \r\n  directors failed to adequately disclose the nature of the transactions thereby \r\n  diluting other shareholdersâ€™ rights in the corporation.  In addition, respondents \r\n  maintain that as part of the scheme, Seaside declared a 100% dividend on all \r\n  shares in September 1996 and again in October 1997.\r\nRespondents filed their complaint in July 1998.  \r\n  Within four months of the complaint being filed, the trial court heard argument \r\n  on the summary judgment motion.  During that time, respondents filed discovery \r\n  requests, moved to compel discovery, and also moved for a continuance. [1]   On November 16, 1998, the trial court heard \r\n  petitionersâ€™ summary judgment motion and respondentsâ€™ continuance motion.  On \r\n  this same day, petitioners answered respondentsâ€™ discovery requests.\r\nIn support of their motion for summary judgment, petitioners submitted \r\n  an affidavit from petitioner Richard E. Fields [2]  and an â€œexhibit bookâ€ which contained \r\n  numerous corporate documents supporting their motion.  According to the Fields \r\n  affidavit, both respondents were notified of the stock sales.  The documents \r\n  in the exhibit book showed that Seaside had several debt obligations, including \r\n  taxes on the property and Dawkinsâ€™ mortgage on part of the property, which it \r\n  wanted to satisfy by selling stock.  In opposition to the motion for summary \r\n  judgment, respondents submitted their verified complaint and the affidavit of \r\n  Professor John Freeman, a law professor and expert in corporations and securities.\r\nIn April 1999, the trial court denied respondentsâ€™ motion for a continuance \r\n  and granted summary judgment for petitioners.  The trial court refused to consider \r\n  respondentsâ€™ expert affidavit, concluding the affidavit contained legal opinions \r\n  and conclusions rather than specific facts.  Regarding the motion for continuance, \r\n  the trial court decided â€œfurther discovery by [respondents] is not likely to \r\n  create a genuine factual issue for trial.â€  \r\nRespondents moved to alter or amend the order, arguing that, inter \r\n  alia, the trial court erred in (1) excluding the expert affidavit, and (2) \r\n  failing to consider their verified complaint as an affidavit for purposes of \r\n  the summary judgment motion.  In denying this motion, the trial court concluded \r\n  that the verified complaint was not an appropriate substitute for an affidavit \r\n  and, in any event, contained merely conclusory allegations.  Regarding the expert \r\n  affidavit, the trial court concluded again that the affidavit constituted an \r\n  opinion on the law which improperly invaded the trial courtâ€™s own role to decide \r\n  the summary judgment motion.\r\nOn appeal, the Court of Appeals reversed, finding that summary judgment \r\n  was erroneously granted to petitioners.  The Court of Appeals decided:  (1) \r\n  a verified complaint is the equivalent of an affidavit for purposes of summary \r\n  judgment; (2) the trial court erred in refusing to consider Professor Freemanâ€™s \r\n  affidavit; and (3) there were genuine issues of material fact.  The Court of \r\n  Appeals did not address respondentsâ€™ argument that, because of the lack of discovery, \r\n  the trial court erred in even hearing the motion for summary judgment.  Dawkins, \r\n  supra.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the trial court improperly refused to \r\n  consider the expert affidavit?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       2.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in holding that a verified complaint is a proper \r\n  substitute for an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       3.\r\n       \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err in finding that genuine material issues of fact \r\n  preclude summary judgment?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       4.&nbsp;\r\n      Did the trial court err in granting summary judgment for petitioners without \r\n  allowing additional time for discovery?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.  EXPERT AFFIDAVIT\r\nPetitioners argue the Court of Appeals erred in finding that the trial \r\n  court erroneously refused to consider Professor Freemanâ€™s expert affidavit.  \r\n  Specifically, petitioners maintain that the affidavit was not based on personal \r\n  knowledge and improperly attempted to explain the law to the trial court.\r\nThe rule governing summary judgment provides that â€œ[s]upporting and opposing \r\n  affidavits shall be made on personal knowledge, shall set forth such \r\n  facts as would be admissible in evidence, and shall show affirmatively that \r\n  the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated therein.â€  Rule 56(e), \r\n  SCRCP (emphasis added).  Nonetheless, â€œ[a]n expert witness may state an opinion \r\n  based on facts not within his firsthand knowledge.â€¦ He may base his opinion \r\n  on information, whether or not admissible, made available to him before the \r\n  hearing if the information is of the type reasonably relied upon in the field \r\n  to make opinions.â€  Hundley v. Rite Aid of South Carolina, Inc., 339 \r\n  S.C. 285, 529 S.E.2d 45, 50 (Ct. App. 2000) (citations omitted); see \r\n  also Rule 703, SCRE. [3] \r\nThe Court of Appeals found that the affidavit was based on Professor Freemanâ€™s \r\n  personal knowledge because he stated he had reviewed the pleadings, the summary \r\n  judgment motion, and the documents petitioners submitted in support of their \r\n  motion.  Dawkins, 345 S.C. at 31, 545 S.E.2d at 519.  We agree with the \r\n  Court of Appeals that the â€œpersonal knowledgeâ€ requirement, as to an expert \r\n  witness, was satisfied in the instant case.  See Hundley, supra.\r\nThe Court of Appeals also concluded that the expert affidavit should have \r\n  been considered by the trial court despite the fact that it contained an opinion \r\n  on the ultimate issue.  Dawkins, 345 S.C. at 31, 545 S.E.2d at 519.  \r\n  However, because Professor Freemanâ€™s affidavit primarily contained legal \r\n  arguments and conclusions, we hold the trial court properly refused to consider \r\n  the affidavit.\r\nRule 702, SCRE, provides that â€œ[i]f â€¦ specialized knowledge will assist \r\n  the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue, \r\n  a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, \r\n  or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or otherwise.â€  \r\n  While it is true that â€œan opinion â€¦ is not objectionable because it embraces \r\n  an ultimate issue to be decided by the trier of fact,â€ Rule 704, SCRE, Professor \r\n  Freemanâ€™s affidavit inappropriately attempted to usurp the trial courtâ€™s role \r\n  in determining whether petitioners were entitled to summary judgment.  See \r\n  Oâ€™Quinn v. Beach Assocs., 272 S.C. 95, 106-07, 249 S.E.2d 734, 739-40 \r\n  (1978) (where expert testimony was offered to establish a conclusion of law, \r\n  the Court held that the trial court properly excluded the testimony because \r\n  that was within the exclusive province of the trial court).\r\nIn general, expert testimony on issues of law is inadmissible.  \r\n  See generally Note, Expert Legal Testimony, 97 Harv.L.Rev. \r\n  797, 797 (1984); see also Askanase v. Fatjo, 130 F.3d 657, \r\n  673 (5th Cir. 1997) (where the court disallowed a legal expertâ€™s \r\n  opinion on whether corporate officers and directors breached their fiduciary \r\n  duties because â€œ[s]uch testimony is a legal opinion and inadmissible.â€); United \r\n  States v. Sinclair, 74 F.3d 753, 758 n.1 (7th Cir. 1996) (commenting \r\n  that Federal Rules of Evidence 702 and 704 prohibit experts from offering opinions \r\n  about legal issues that will determine the outcome of a case).\r\nRecently, this Court decided the issue of whether expert testimony from \r\n  a criminal defense attorney on whether trial counsel was deficient could be \r\n  admitted at a post-conviction relief (PCR) hearing.  Green v. State, \r\n  351 S.C. 184, 198, 569 S.E.2d 318, 325 (2002).  Green argued that Rule 702 required \r\n  the PCR judge to admit the expert opinion testimony.  We disagreed, and stated \r\n  the following:\r\n\r\nThe expert offered no factual \r\n  evidence.  He proffered his opinion, assuming certain facts, [that] trial counselâ€™s \r\n  actions fell below acceptable legal standards of competence.  The testimony \r\n  was not designed to assist the PCR court to understand certain facts, but, rather, \r\n  was legal argument why the PCR court should rule, as a matter of law, trial \r\n  counselâ€™s actions fell below an acceptable legal standard of competence.  Such \r\n  â€œtestimonyâ€ falls outside of Rule 702, SCRE.\r\n\r\nId. (emphasis added).\r\nGreen is instructive to the instant case.  Here, Professor Freemanâ€™s \r\n  affidavit reads as if it could have been respondentsâ€™ oral argument to the trial \r\n  court at the summary judgment hearing.  Although Professor Freeman arguably \r\n  offered some helpful, factual information, \r\n  [4]  the overwhelming majority of the affidavit is simply legal argument \r\n  as to why summary judgment should be denied.  For that reason, we hold the trial \r\n  court correctly refused to consider it, and the Court of Appeals erred in finding \r\n  otherwise.  See Green, supra; Oâ€™Quinn, supra. \r\n\r\n2.  VERIFIED COMPLAINT\r\nPetitioners argue that the Court of Appeals erred in holding that respondentsâ€™ \r\n  verified complaint should have been allowed by the trial court as a substitute \r\n  for an affidavit.\r\nDiscussing this novel issue, the Court of Appeals stated the following: \r\n\r\nAlthough our courts have \r\n  not specifically addressed whether a verified complaint is the equivalent of \r\n  an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment, Rule 56 of the South Carolina \r\n  Rules of Civil Procedure is identical to its federal counterpart. â€¦\r\n\r\nFederal courts \r\n  addressing the issue have held that for the purposes of summary judgment, a \r\n  verified complaint is the equivalent of an affidavit, provided that the verified \r\n  complaint meets the requirements of Rule 56(e). â€¦ Likewise, numerous state \r\n  courts have held that a verified complaint is the equivalent of an affidavit \r\n  for summary judgment purposes. â€¦  Moreover, our review of South Carolina cases \r\n  leads us to believe that such a result is consistent with South Carolina law.  \r\n  â€¦  Accordingly, we hold that for summary judgment purposes, a verified pleading \r\n  is equivalent to an affidavit, provided it meets the requirements of Rule \r\n  56(e).\r\n\r\nDawkins, 345 S.C. at 28-30, 545 S.E.2d at 518-19 (emphasis added, \r\n  footnotes and citations omitted).\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ well-supported \r\n  [5]  conclusion that a verified complaint is an acceptable substitute for \r\n  an affidavit at the summary judgment phase as long as the pleading satisfies \r\n  Rule 56(e).  Petitioners argue, however, that respondentsâ€™ verified complaint \r\n  did not meet the requirements of Rule 56(e).  We agree.  \r\nRule 56(e) requires that affidavits:  â€œ[1] shall be made on personal knowledge, \r\n  [2] shall set forth such facts as would be admissible in evidence, and [3] shall \r\n  show affirmatively that the affiant is competent to testify to the matters stated \r\n  therein.â€  Rule 56(e), SCRCP.  â€œFew pleadings will satisfy these requirements, \r\n  even when verified.â€  10B Charles Alan Wright, Arthur R. Miller &amp; Mary Kay \r\n  Kane, Federal Practice and Procedure: Civil 3d Â§ 2738 (1998).\r\nIn the instant case, both respondents verified the complaint as follows:\r\n\r\nPERSONALLY APPEARED before \r\n  me, [respondentâ€™s name], who being duly sworn, deposes and says:  that he is \r\n  one of the Plaintiffs, in the foregoing action, that he has read the within \r\n  Complaint, and that the facts are true of his own knowledge, except those \r\n  matters and things therein alleged upon information and belief, and as to those, \r\n  he believes them to be true.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nAllegations made upon information and belief do not meet the â€œpersonal \r\n  knowledgeâ€ requirements of Rule 56(e).  See, e.g., Sheinkopf \r\n  v. Stone, 927 F.2d 1259 (1st Cir. 1991); Fowler v. Southern \r\n  Bell Tel. &amp; Tel. Co., 343 F.2d 150 (5th Cir. 1965); Seay \r\n  v. Allstate Ins. Co., 296 S.E.2d 30 (N.C. Ct. App. 1982).  Likewise, because \r\n  of the abundance of conclusory allegations found in respondentsâ€™ verified complaint, \r\n  it simply is not an appropriate substitute for an affidavit.  See Sheinkopf, \r\n  supra; Fowler, supra; see also Wright, Miller \r\n  &amp; Kane, Â§ 2738 (â€œultimate or conclusory facts and conclusions of law, as \r\n  well as statements made on â€¦ â€˜information and belief,â€™ cannot be utilized on \r\n  a summary-judgment motionâ€).\r\nIn sum, we find the Court of Appeals correctly held that a verified pleading \r\n  may substitute for an affidavit at the summary judgment phase; however, \r\n  it erred in finding that respondentsâ€™ verified complaint met Rule 56(e)â€™s requirements.  \r\n  Id.  Accordingly, the trial court appropriately refused to accept respondentsâ€™ \r\n  verified complaint as an affidavit for purposes of summary judgment.\r\n3.  ISSUES OF FACT / FULL AND FAIR OPPORTUNITY FOR DISCOVERY\r\nPetitioners argue the Court of Appeals erred in finding \r\n  there were genuine material issues of fact.  Respondents, on the other hand, \r\n  contend the Court of Appeals correctly found there were issues of fact precluding \r\n  summary judgment.  Moreover, respondents argue as an additional sustaining ground \r\n  that the motion for summary judgment was premature because they were deprived \r\n  of a full and fair opportunity to conduct discovery.\r\nâ€œThe purpose of summary judgment is to expedite disposition of cases which \r\n  do not require the services of a fact finder.â€  George v. Fabri, 345 \r\n  S.C. 440, 452, 548 S.E.2d 868, 874 (2001).  In reviewing the grant of a summary \r\n  judgment motion, the Court applies the same standard as the trial court under \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP:  â€œsummary judgment is proper when â€˜there is no genuine issue \r\n  as to any material fact and ... the moving party is entitled to judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€™â€  Baughman v. American Tel. and Tel. Co., 306 S.C. \r\n  101, 114-15 410 S.E.2d 537, 545 (1991).  In determining whether summary judgment \r\n  is appropriate, the evidence and its reasonable inferences must be viewed in \r\n  the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Id. at 115, 410 S.E.2d \r\n  at 545. \r\nSummary judgment is a drastic remedy and must not be granted until the \r\n  opposing party has had a full and fair opportunity to complete discovery. \r\n  Id. at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 543.  Nonetheless, the nonmoving party must demonstrate \r\n  the likelihood that further discovery will uncover additional relevant evidence \r\n  and that the party is â€œnot merely engaged in a â€˜fishing expedition.â€™â€  Id. \r\n  at 112, 410 S.E.2d at 544. \r\nThe Court of Appeals found numerous issues of fact.  However, in doing \r\n  so, the Court of Appeals relied heavily on Professor Freemanâ€™s opinions and \r\n  likewise found the verified complaint should have been considered as an affidavit.  \r\n  Given our rulings above, the record before the trial court properly consisted \r\n  of the pleadings, Fieldsâ€™ affidavit, and the accompanying â€œexhibit book.â€  Our \r\n  review of the record before the trial court compels a finding that summary judgment \r\n  was properly granted.  See Humana Hosp.-Bayside v. Lightle, 305 \r\n  S.C. 214, 216, 407 S.E.2d 637, 638 (1991) (â€œWhere a plaintiff relies solely \r\n  upon the pleadings, files no counter-affidavits, and makes no factual showing \r\n  in opposition to a motion for summary judgment, the lower court is required \r\n  under Rule 56, to grant summary judgment, if, under the facts presented by the \r\n  defendant, he was entitled to judgment as a matter of law.â€).\r\nThe record unequivocally shows that Seaside had corporate debts, properly \r\n  notified its shareholders of the intent to satisfy the debts through a stock \r\n  issuance, and fairly offered stock to all the shareholders.  There is simply \r\n  no factual support for respondentsâ€™ claims; instead, all the evidence before \r\n  the trial court shows that the stock was issued in good faith and for a proper \r\n  business purpose.  See Roper v. Dynamique Concepts, Inc., 316 \r\n  S.C. 131, 447 S.E.2d 218 (Ct. App. 1994) (the issuance of additional shares \r\n  of stock as a last ditch effort to raise capital for a financially troubled \r\n  corporation was sufficient to overcome a claim of oppression because the shares \r\n  had been issued in good faith).\r\nAlthough we are bound to review the record in a light most favorable to \r\n  respondents, â€œ[a] court â€˜cannot ignore facts unfavorable to that party and [it] \r\n  must determine whether a verdict for the party opposing the motion would be \r\n  reasonably possible under the facts.â€™â€  Bloom v. Ravoira, 339 S.C. 417, \r\n  423, 529 S.E.2d 710, 713 (2000) (citation omitted).  It is undisputed that Dawkins \r\n  participated in meetings where these issues were discussed and received notice \r\n  of the stock offerings.  Likewise, the only logical inference from the record \r\n  is that Chisholm either was on notice of the stock offerings, or by his own \r\n  conduct, prevented himself from receiving the notice.  As to the value of the \r\n  stock and respondentsâ€™ allegations that the stock was undervalued, we note the \r\n  stock was issued at par value.  In addition, respondents knew the value of the \r\n  south side tract exceeded $1 million because, in the early 1990â€™s, Seaside had \r\n  received a $1.75 million offer for the land.\r\nWe find the trial court appropriately ruled that respondents failed to \r\n  present any â€œspecific factsâ€ establishing a genuine issue for trial.  Respondents \r\n  are not permitted to simply rest on the allegations in their complaint, especially \r\n  where, as here, the majority of the factual allegations are conclusory in nature.  \r\n  See Rule 56(e), SCRCP (â€œan adverse party may not rest upon the mere allegations \r\n  or denials of his pleading, but his response, by affidavits or as otherwise \r\n  provided in this rule, must set forth specific facts showing that there is a \r\n  genuine issue for trial.â€).\r\nAs to respondentsâ€™ argument that summary judgment was premature because \r\n  they did not have a full and fair opportunity for discovery, we hold that under \r\n  the unusual circumstances of this case, the trial court appropriately granted \r\n  summary judgment.  See Middleborough Horiz. Property Regime Council \r\n  of Co-Owners v. Montedison S.p.A., 320 S.C. 470, 479-80, 465 S.E.2d 765, \r\n  771 (Ct. App. 1995) (affirming summary judgment where appellants â€œadvance[d] \r\n  no good reason why four months was insufficient time under the facts of this \r\n  case to develop documentation in opposition to the motion for summary judgmentâ€).  \r\n  Furthermore, we agree with the trial court that further discovery was unlikely \r\n  to create any genuine issue of material fact.  See Baughman, 306 \r\n  S.C. at 112, S.E.2d at 544 (nonmoving party must demonstrate that further discovery \r\n  will likely uncover additional relevant evidence); see also George \r\n  v. Fabri, 345 S.C. at 452, 548 S.E.2d at 874 (purpose of summary judgment \r\n  is to dispose of cases which do not require a fact finder).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, the decision of the Court of Appeals \r\n  is \r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., \r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I agree with the majority that at the summary judgment \r\n  phase, a verified complaint is an acceptable substitute for an affidavit, as \r\n  long as the pleading satisfies Rule 56(e), SCRCP.  However, I respectfully disagree \r\n  that there was no genuine issue of material fact that precluded summary judgment.  \r\n  In my opinion, the factual averments of respondentsâ€™ verified complaint raised \r\n  a genuine issue whether petitioners breached their fiduciary duty.  The complaint \r\n  alleged that the shares were issued for inadequate compensation.  And that there \r\n  was no legitimate business purpose for issuing the shares, as evidenced by the \r\n  100% dividend, returned on those shares only a few months later.  I would therefore \r\n  affirm the Court of Appeals.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Respondents wanted the trial court to continue the hearing for summary \r\n    judgment, or deny the summary judgment motion as premature, because they had \r\n    not yet had an opportunity to conduct discovery.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Fields is Seasideâ€™s president and chairman of \r\n    the board.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Rule 703 states:  â€œThe facts or data in the particular case upon \r\n    which an expert bases an opinion or inference may be those perceived by or \r\n    made known to the expert at or before the hearing.

Burch, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25626\r\nHeard March 19, 2003 - Filed April 14, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nThomas C. Salane, of Columbia, for Appellant.\r\nWilliam P. Hatfield and Reginald C. Brown, Jr., both of Florence, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  Appellant (Insurance Company) \r\n  appeals a jury verdict awarding the Hinkles (respondents) $1,500 actual damages \r\n  and $280,000.01 punitive damages on their claim of negligent nonrenewal \r\n  of a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy. [1]   Insurance Company argues it \r\n  was entitled to a directed verdict or to a judgment notwithstanding the \r\n  verdict (JNOV) for several different reasons; that the punitive damage award \r\n  was excessive as a matter of law; and that it was entitled to a new trial because \r\n  of flaws in the jury charge.  We find the trial judge erred in denying the Insurance \r\n  Companyâ€™s directed verdict motion and reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents own a mobile home manufactured in 1980.  They have financed improvements \r\n  to the home by remortgaging it.  In 1992, respondent Emily Hinkle (Emily) approached \r\n  the Foster Insurance Agency about purchasing a homeownerâ€™s policy to cover the \r\n  trailer.  She told the agent the respondents needed flood coverage because the \r\n  mobile home was located in a flood zone near a creek. \r\n  [2]   The insurance application contains this notation in the agentâ€™s handwriting \r\n  â€œInclude VSI &amp; Fed Flood.â€ \r\nThe declaration page for the period 8/21/92 to 8/21/93 includes a \r\n  $3 charge for â€˜Floodâ€™ as an optional coverage.  It is undisputed that, from \r\n  the Insurance Companyâ€™s perspective, this $3 optional flood coverage was meant \r\n  only to protect the lenderâ€™s interest in case the trailer was totally destroyed \r\n  in a flood.  The respondents believed they had flood coverage.\r\nThe policy was issued only after the agent responded to Insurance Companyâ€™s \r\n  request for more information, including verification that the mobile home was \r\n  not in a flood area.  Respondents supplied the agent with a copy of an appraisal \r\n  done by the trailerâ€™s lien holder that indicated that the mobile home was not \r\n  in a FEMA flood hazard area.  The agent forwarded the appraisal to the \r\n  Insurance Company.  The agent testified she could submit any application whether \r\n  or not it met Insurance Companyâ€™s underwriting guidelines, but that it was Insurance \r\n  Companyâ€™s decision whether to bind the policy.\r\nIt is undisputed that had \r\n  the Insurance Company known that the mobile home was, in fact, located in a \r\n  flood zone, respondentsâ€™ insurance application would have been rejected under \r\n  the Insurance Companyâ€™s underwriting guidelines.  Further, Emily testified that \r\n  she understood there was no assurance that the policy would be renewed, but \r\n  that the decision to offer a renewal would be made anew each year.\r\nThe first policy period ran from August 1992 until August 1993.  \r\n  On January 19, 1993, the home was flooded, but not destroyed.  The agent submitted \r\n  the respondentsâ€™ claim to the Insurance Company, which paid them approximately \r\n  $7,290.  This claim was paid despite the fact that, under the policy, the only \r\n  flood coverage provided that the lender would be paid in full if the trailer \r\n  were totally destroyed.\r\nIn March 1993, the Insurance Company sent a notice of nonrenewal to the respondents.  \r\n  This notice was triggered by the Insurance Companyâ€™s erroneous attribution of \r\n  a theft claim to the respondentsâ€™ policy.  The Insurance Company, virtually \r\n  simultaneously, sent respondents a renewal notice.  The Insurance Company honored \r\n  the renewal notice, and the respondents purchased a second policy covering the \r\n  period August 1993, to August 1994.  They received a renewal notice and purchased \r\n  a third policy for the period August 1994, to August 1995.\r\nOn December 23, 1994, during the third policy year, the respondentsâ€™ \r\n  mobile home was again flooded.  This time, Insurance Company denied the claim \r\n  on the ground that there was no coverage.  The denial of this claim led to respondents \r\n  suing Insurance Company for bad faith refusal to pay, a suit that resulted in \r\n  a verdict for respondents.\r\nFollowing this second flood loss, Insurance Company sent a timely \r\n  notice of nonrenewal to respondents stating as the reason for the nonrenewal \r\n  â€œloss frequency.â€  The respondents testified they had a difficult time getting \r\n  homeownerâ€™s insurance from another company, paid that company higher premiums \r\n  for less coverage, and suffered emotional upset as the result of the loss of \r\n  coverage.  Since their home is located in a flood plain, respondents are unable \r\n  to obtain private flood insurance and apparently have chosen not to participate \r\n  in the federal flood program.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether the trial court erred in denying Insurance Companyâ€™s \r\n  motion for a directed verdict on the negligent nonrenewal claim?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nWhen considering a directed verdict or a JNOV motion, the trial court \r\n  is required to view the evidence and the inferences that can be drawn from that \r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.  Sabb v. South \r\n  Carolina State Univ., 305 S.C. 416, 567 S.E.2d 231 (2002).  This Court will \r\n  reverse the trial courtâ€™s rulings on these motions only where there is no evidence \r\n  to support the rulings or where the rulings are controlled by an error of law.  \r\n  Id.  \r\nRespondents have styled their legal theory here as â€˜negligent nonrenewal of \r\n  a homeownerâ€™s insurance policy.â€™  As the Insurance Company pointed out at trial \r\n  and in its brief, there was nothing â€˜negligentâ€™ about its decision not to renew \r\n  the respondentsâ€™ policy:  it was an intentional act. [3]   Nevertheless, this case was tried \r\n  and is argued as if negligence were the issue. \r\nAs noted above, a negligence claim is premised on the defendantâ€™s breach of \r\n  a duty owed to the plaintiff. Sabb v. South Carolina State Univ., supra.  \r\n  Generally, unless the insurance policy provides otherwise or in the absence \r\n  of a statutory requirement, there is no legal duty to renew a policy.  E.g., \r\n  44 C.J.S. Insurance Â§ 344 (1993).  Therefore, the first question here is the \r\n  source of the duty alleged to have been negligently breached by Insurance Company.\r\nThere is no contention that any renewal obligation is found in the contract.  \r\n  In brief, respondents allege the duty breached is found in Â§ 38-75-790.  Section \r\n  38-75-790 provides:\r\n\r\nNo insurer may nonrenew a policy of homeowners insurance because the insured \r\n  has filed a claim with that insurer for damages resulting from an act of God.\r\n\r\nAt the nonsuit stage, however, respondents maintained:\r\n\r\nWe also previously intended to go forwards [sic] on the \r\n  violation of the statute 38-75-790 as creating we believe, a private right of \r\n  action for the insurance companies [sic] nonrenewal in violation of the statute \r\n  because that was a [sic] act of God occurrence.  An [sic] while we believe our \r\n  position is strong so that the record is pristine in this case, we are not going \r\n  to pursue that claim except as it relates to the bad faith claim.\r\n\r\nInsurance Companyâ€™s attorney responded \r\n  to this statement by asking what, then, was the basis of the negligence claim, \r\n  since the only evidence was that the nonrenewal was intentional.  The trial \r\n  judge denied the Insurance Companyâ€™s request for a nonsuit on the negligence \r\n  claim.   \r\nIt is clear, however, \r\n  that the only possible source of a duty here is Â§ 38-75-790.  As noted above, \r\n  however, at the nonsuit stage, respondents maintained the statute was only relevant \r\n  to their bad faith claim. [4]         \r\nAt the directed verdict stage, \r\n  the following exchange occurred between the attorneys:\r\n\r\nInsurance Company:  With regard \r\n  to my understanding of the [negligence] claim which is a quasi violation of \r\n  a statute or statute creating a duty negligence [sic] and meeting that duty, \r\n  the complaint alleged a violation of 38-75-790.  Do I understand that [respondents \r\n  are] not asserting that independent cause of action for a violation of section \r\n  38-75-790?\r\nRespondent:  Is that a question?\r\nInsurance Company:  Yes.\r\nRespondent:  Iâ€™m sorry.  I was \r\n  conferring with [co counsel].\r\nInsurance Company:  Do I understand \r\n  correctly that youâ€™ve withdrawn the second cause of action for violation of \r\n  the statute 38-75-790?\r\nRespondent:  As a private cause \r\n  of action we have.\r\n\r\nInsurance Company again sought \r\n  to require respondents to specify the basis of their negligence theory.  Respondents \r\n  stated they were relying upon their arguments made at the nonsuit hearing to \r\n  oppose the Insurance Companyâ€™s directed verdict.  They then argued that there \r\n  was conflicting evidence whether the Insurance Company had a firm policy of \r\n  declining to insure all trailers in flood zones or whether there was some flexibility \r\n  in this process. [5]     Nowhere \r\n  was there any mention of a duty or any reference to Â§ 38-75-790.  The judge \r\n  denied the directed verdict motion.  \r\nInsurance Company then \r\n  objected to numerous aspects of respondentsâ€™ request to charge.  It pointed \r\n  out that the first reference to Â§ 38-75-790 mis-paraphrased the statute; the \r\n  trial judge responded by saying he understood that part of the charge to have \r\n  been withdrawn because it went to the private cause of action claim.  The Insurance \r\n  Company then objected to the entire charge on â€˜negligent nonrenewal,â€™ in part \r\n  because it twice referred to Â§ 38-75-790, and in part because it charged that \r\n  a violation of that statute constituted negligence per se.  Insurance Company \r\n  also objected to another charge on the effect of a violation of Â§ 38-75-790, \r\n  and respondents agreed to withdraw it. \r\nInsurance Company objected to yet another reference to Â§ 38-75-790, \r\n  and to the chargeâ€™s paraphrase of that statute.  Respondents again alleged that \r\n  the repetition of the statute at this point in the charge was necessary to instruct \r\n  the jury fully on their bad faith claim.  As the discussion continued, respondents \r\n  agreed to omit all references to Â§ 38-75-790 in connection with their negligent \r\n  nonrenewal claim.\r\nFollowing the jury verdict \r\n  for respondents on their â€˜negligent nonrenewalâ€™ cause of action, Insurance Company \r\n  filed a timely post-trial motion.  It sought a JNOV on the ground that there \r\n  was no private cause of action under Â§ 38-75-790.  Respondentsâ€™ return to the \r\n  JNOV concedes they withdrew that claim at trial, but nonetheless asserts the \r\n  statute â€œclearly establishes a duty of care by this defendant to the plaintiffs.â€\r\nFor purposes of this appeal, \r\n  we assume that a decision not to renew a homeownerâ€™s policy because the homeowner \r\n  made a claim for damages resulting from an act of God \r\n  [6]  would support a tort claim. [7]   Therefore, the dispositive question is whether \r\n  there is any evidence that Insurance Company â€˜negligentlyâ€™ nonrenewed respondentsâ€™ \r\n  homeownerâ€™s policy.  We hold that there is none.\r\nThere is no evidence that \r\n  the Insurance Companyâ€™s decision to nonrenew was based on a negligent breach \r\n  of duty.  Rather, the repeated claims put the Insurance Company on notice that \r\n  the flood risk for this particular site was excessive, and it subsequently determined \r\n  respondentsâ€™ trailer was located in a flood zone.  Insurance Companyâ€™s underwriting \r\n  guidelines prohibited issuance of a homeowner policy for a mobile home located \r\n  in such a zone.  Accordingly, the decision not to offer to renew respondentsâ€™ \r\n  policy was made.\r\nThe respondents would have \r\n  the Court adopt a rule that an insurance company, having mistakenly issued a \r\n  policy based on the insuredsâ€™ misrepresentation (innocent or not) of the risk, \r\n  is bound to renew this policy in perpetuity.  While Â§ 38-75-790 prevents an \r\n  insurance company from nonrenewing a homeownerâ€™s policy in retaliation for a \r\n  claim predicated upon an act of God, nothing in that statute precludes an insurer \r\n  from reassessing the risk of a particular insured property, and from declining \r\n  to renew the policy upon a determination that the property does not meet the \r\n  insurerâ€™s underwriting guidelines.\r\nThe trial judge erred in \r\n  denying the Insurance Companyâ€™s directed verdict and JNOV motions because there \r\n  is no evidence that Insurance Company negligently breached any \r\n  duty owed to respondents.  Accordingly, the verdict for the respondents is \r\nREVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The case was also submitted to the jury on a bad \r\n    faith failure to renew claim.  The verdict on that claim was for the respondents, \r\n    but $0 damages.  The parties agree this was a â€˜perverseâ€™ defense verdict, \r\n    and this claim is not the subject of this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Since the appeal comes before the Court on a claim \r\n    of entitlement to a directed verdict/JNOV, we review the facts in the light \r\n    most favorable to respondents.  E.g., Sabb v.

The agent testified while she could submit any \r\n    application, whether or not it met the underwriting guidelines, it was the \r\n    Insurance Companyâ€™s decision whether to bind the coverage.  Recall that Insurance \r\n    Company asked whether respondentsâ€™ trailer was in a flood zone before binding \r\n    the contract, and the respondents supplied their lenderâ€™s appraisal showing \r\n    the property was not in a flood area.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  We also assume for purposes of this opinion that \r\n    respondents suffered floods that qualified as an act of God.\r\n  \r\n  A flood of unprecedented or \r\n    extraordinary nature is an â€œact of Godâ€ in the legal sense, but such a flood \r\n    is held not to be so where it could be anticipated by ordinary foresight and \r\n    prudenceâ€¦\r\n  Baynham v.

King, of Lewis, Babcock, &amp; \r\n  Hawkins, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BURNETT:  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals which reversed a lower court order dismissing an action \r\n  for â€œfraud upon the courtâ€ and an â€œindependent action in equity for fraudâ€ pursuant \r\n  to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 346 S.C. 28, 550 \r\n  S.E.2d 584 (Ct. App. 2001).  We affirm.    \r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1992, Respondent, \r\n  Ray H. Chewning, Jr., (Chewning) brought a products liability action against \r\n  Respondent Ford Motor Company (Ford).  He alleged that defects in his Ford Bronco \r\n  II caused a rollover accident in which he sustained personal injuries.  After \r\n  a trial in 1993, the jury returned a verdict in Fordâ€™s favor.  \r\nIn 1998, Chewning \r\n  filed this action in state court against Ford, its expert witness, David J. \r\n  Bickerstaff, and David J. Bickerstaff and Associates, Inc., asserting various \r\n  causes of action.  In essence, Chewning alleged Bickerstaff committed perjury \r\n  during his 1993 trial and Ford concealed documents from him during the course \r\n  of discovery.  \r\nFord removed the action to federal court.  The federal court granted \r\n  Fordâ€™s motion to dismiss all claims, except for Chewningâ€™s cause of action for \r\n  fraud upon the court.  The federal court remanded the fraud upon the court claim \r\n  â€œand such other related claims in equity, if any, as the state court may allow \r\n  to be added by amendment.â€  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., 35 F.Supp. 2d \r\n  487, 492 (D.S.C. 1998).\r\nChewning refiled his case in state court \r\n  asserting causes of action for fraud upon the court and an independent action \r\n  in equity for fraud.  In his amended complaint, Chewning alleged Fordâ€™s attorneys \r\n  hired Bickerstaff to testify falsely on Fordâ€™s behalf in various Bronco II actions. \r\n  [1]   In addition, Chewning alleged Fordâ€™s attorneys withheld critical documents \r\n  during discovery.  Chewning asserted the judgment in his original action should \r\n  be vacated as a result of the defendantsâ€™ activities.  \r\nConcluding \r\n  Chewningâ€™s complaint was untimely and asserted allegations of intrinsic fraud \r\n  which could not be used to set aside the earlier verdict, the trial judge dismissed \r\n  the complaint pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.  In addition, the trial judge \r\n  determined Chewningâ€™s amended complaint failed to allege fraud with particularity \r\n  as required by Rule 9(b), SCRCP,  as it â€œdoes not identify any allegedly perjured \r\n  testimony by Bickerstaff in the underlying products liability trial, only subsequent \r\n  cases after Chewningâ€™s.â€  Chewning appealed.   \r\nThe Court of Appeals reversed.  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., \r\n  supra.  It held Chewningâ€™s claim was timely and, further, the complaint \r\n  sufficiently stated a claim for fraud upon the court.  Id.\r\nISSUES \r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by holding the subornation of perjury and concealing \r\n  of documents by an attorney during the course of litigation may constitute fraud \r\n  upon the court?  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by finding Chewningâ€™s complaint alleged fraud upon \r\n  the court with sufficient particularity? \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nFord contends the Court of Appeals \r\n  erred by holding the subornation of perjury and concealing of documents by an \r\n  attorney during litigation constitutes fraud upon the court.  [2]   It contends these actions constitute \r\n  intrinsic, rather than extrinsic, fraud and, therefore can not form the basis \r\n  of Chewningâ€™s claim for fraud upon the court.  We disagree.  \r\nFraud Upon the Court\r\nOur Court has not previously defined fraud \r\n  upon the court in connection with setting aside a final judgment.  \r\n  [3]   In Evans v. Gunter, 294 S.C. 525, 529, 366 S.E.2d 44, 46 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1988), the Court of Appeals noted one commentator described â€œfraud upon \r\n  the courtâ€ as â€œthat species of fraud which does, or attempts to, subvert the \r\n  integrity of the Court itself, or is a fraud perpetrated by officers of the \r\n  court so that the judicial machinery cannot perform in the usual manner its \r\n  impartial task of adjudging cases that are presented for adjudication.â€  (citing \r\n  H. Lightsey, J. Flanagan, South Carolina Civil Procedure, 408 (2nd ed. \r\n  1985).  \r\nOther jurisdictions describe fraud upon the \r\n  court as follows:\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, only the most egregious misconduct, \r\n  such as bribery of a judge or members of a jury, or the fabrication of evidence \r\n  by a party in which an attorney is implicated will constitute fraud on the court.  \r\n  Less egregious misconduct, such as nondisclosure to the court of facts allegedly \r\n  pertinent to the matter before it, will not ordinarily rise to the level of \r\n  fraud on the court.\r\n\r\nRozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d 1332, 1338 \r\n  (5th Cir. 1978)  citing United States v. Intâ€™l Telephone \r\n  &amp; Telegraph Corp., 349 F.Supp. 22, 29 (D. Conn. 1972) (internal citations \r\n  omitted).  \r\nFraud upon the court is a â€œserious \r\n  allegation . . . involving â€˜corruption of the judicial process itselfâ€™.â€  Cleveland \r\n  Demolition Co., Inc. v. Azcon Scrap Corp., supra 827 F.2d at 986 \r\n  quoting In re Whitney-Forbes, 770 F.2d 692, 698 (7th \r\n  Cir. 1985).  \r\n\r\n. . . â€˜[F]raud on the court,â€™ whatever else it embodies, \r\n  requires a showing that one has acted with an intent to deceive or defraud the \r\n  court.  A proper balance between the interests of finality on the one hand and \r\n  allowing relief due to inequitable conduct on the other makes it essential that \r\n  there be a showing of conscious wrongdoing - - what can properly be characterized \r\n  as a deliberate scheme to defraud - - before relief from a final judgment is \r\n  appropriate. . . . Thus, when there is no intent to deceive, the fact that misrepresentations \r\n  were made to a court is not of itself sufficient basis for setting aside a judgment \r\n  for â€˜fraud on the court.â€™\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Buck, 281 F.3d 1136, 1342 (10th \r\n  Cir. 2002) quoting Robinson v. Audi Aktiengesellschaft, 56 F.3d \r\n  1259, 1267 (10th Cir. 1995). \r\n Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., 322 U.S. 238 (1944), \r\n  is the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s leading â€œfraud upon the courtâ€ decision.  \r\n  In that decision, an attorney for Hartford drafted an article in support of \r\n  a particular glass manufacturing process, had an officer of the glass-workersâ€™ \r\n  union sign the article as its author, and then had the article published in \r\n  a trade journal.  The article was included in support of Hartfordâ€™s controversial \r\n  patent application.  The patent was granted.  Hartford then initiated a patent \r\n  infringement suit against Hazel-Glass.  In finding Hazel-Glass had infringed \r\n  upon Hartfordâ€™s patent, the Third Circuit Court of Appeals relied on the article.  \r\n  Ultimately, the true identity of the author was discovered.  In upholding Hazel-Glassâ€™ \r\n  suit, the USSC Court emphasized:\r\n\r\nThis is not simply a case of a judgment obtained with \r\n  the aid of a witness who, on the basis of after-discovered evidence, is believed \r\n  to have been guilty of perjury.  Here, . . .we find a deliberately planned and \r\n  carefully executed scheme to defraud not only the Patent Office but the Circuit \r\n  Court of Appeals. . . . This matter does not concern only private parties.  \r\n  There are issues of great moment to the public in a patent suit.  Furthermore, \r\n  tampering with the administration of justice in the manner indisputably shown \r\n  here involves far more than an injury to a single litigant.  It is a wrong against \r\n  the institutions set up to protect and safeguard the public, institutions in \r\n  which fraud cannot complacently be tolerated consistently with the good order \r\n  of society.  Surely it cannot be that preservation of the integrity of the judicial \r\n  process must always wait upon the diligence of litigants.  The public welfare \r\n  demands that the agencies of public justice be not so impotent that they must \r\n  always be mute and helpless victims of deception and fraud.\r\n\r\n  Id. U.S. at 245-46 (internal citations omitted).  \r\n\r\nIntrinsic/Extrinsic Fraud\r\nIn considering collateral attacks on final \r\n  judgments, a court must balance the interest of finality against the need to \r\n  provide a fair and just resolution of the dispute.  See Hagy v. Pruitt, \r\n  339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714 (2000).  In most circumstances, there is a time \r\n  limitation upon a party who seeks to reopen a final judgment.  Rule 60(b), SCRCP, \r\n  provides, in part: \r\n  (b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mistakes; Inadvertence; \r\n  Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered Evidence; Fraud, etc.  \r\n\r\nOn motion and upon such terms as are just, the court may \r\n  relieve a party or his legal representative from a final judgment, order, or \r\n  proceeding for the following reasons: \r\n  \r\n  (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable \r\n  neglect;\r\n  (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; newly discovered evidence which by due diligence \r\n  could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule 59(b);\r\n  (3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct \r\n  of an adverse party; \r\n  (4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the judgment is void;\r\n  (5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; the judgment has been satisfied, released, or \r\n  discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or \r\n  otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have \r\n  prospective application.\r\n  \r\nThe motion shall be made within a reasonable time, and for \r\n  reasons (1), (2), and (3) not more than one year after the judgment, order or \r\n  proceeding was entered or taken . . .This rule does not limit the power of \r\n  a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party from a judgment \r\n  order, or proceeding, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.  \r\n                             \r\n\r\n(Underline added).\r\nThere is no statute of limitations when a party seeks \r\n  to set aside a judgment due to fraud upon the court.  Rule 60(b), SCRCP; see \r\n  Hagy v. Pruitt, supra (court has the inherent authority to set \r\n  aside a judgment on the ground of extrinsic fraud in spite of any facially applicable \r\n  statute of limitations).  In order to secure equitable relief on the basis of \r\n  fraud, the fraud must be extrinsic.  Bryan v. Bryan, 220 S.C. 164, 66 \r\n  S.E.2d 609 (1951).   (extrinsic fraud is necessary in order to secure equitable \r\n  relief vacating a prior judgment). \r\nExtrinsic fraud is â€œfraud that induces a person not to present a case or deprives \r\n  a person of the opportunity to be heard.  Relief is granted for extrinsic fraud \r\n  on the theory that because the fraud prevented a party from fully exhibiting \r\n  and trying his case, there has never been a real contest before the court on \r\n  the subject matter of the action.â€  Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina v. \r\n  Public Serv. Commâ€™n, 294 S.C. 9, 11, 362 S.E.2d 176, 177 (1987). \r\nIntrinsic fraud, on the other hand, is fraud which was presented and considered \r\n  in the trial.  Hagy v. Pruitt, 339 S.C. 425, 529 S.E.2d 714 (2000).  \r\n  It is fraud which misleads a court in determining issues and induces the court \r\n  to find for the party perpetrating the fraud.  Hilton Head Ctr. v. South \r\n  Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, supra.  \r\nPerjury by a party or a witness is intrinsic fraud.  Rycroft \r\n  v. Tanguay, 279 S.C. 76, 302 S.E.2d 327 (1983).  â€œ[O]rdinarily there is \r\n  no ground for equitable interference with a judgment in the fact that perjury \r\n  or false swearing was committed by such party or his witnesses at trial, at \r\n  least where the perjurious or false evidence was not accompanied by any extrinsic \r\n  or collateral fraud, and related to issues or matters which were or could have \r\n  been considered in the original cause.â€  Bryan v. Bryan, supra \r\n  220 S.C. at 168, 66 S.E.2d at 610.  In addition, the failure to disclose to \r\n  an adversary or court matters which would defeat one's own claim is intrinsic \r\n  fraud.  Hilton Head Ctr. of South Carolina, Inc. v. Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, \r\n  supra.  [4]   \r\n\r\nEquitable relief from a judgment is denied \r\n  in cases of intrinsic fraud, on the theory that an issue which has been tried \r\n  and passed upon in the original action should not be retried in an action for \r\n  equitable relief against the judgment, and that otherwise litigation would be \r\n  interminable; relief is granted for extrinsic fraud on the theory that by reason \r\n  of the fraud preventing a party from fully exhibiting and trying his case, there \r\n  never has been a real contest before the court of the subject matter of the \r\n  action.\r\n\r\nBryan v. Bryan, supra S.C. at 168, S.E.2d \r\n  at 610.   \r\nâ€œRelief is granted for extrinsic but not intrinsic fraud \r\n  on the theory that the latter deceptions should be discovered during the litigation \r\n  itself, and to permit such relief undermines the stability of all judgments.â€  \r\n  Mr. G. v. Mrs. G., 320 S.C. 305, 308, 465 S.E.2d 101, 103 (Ct. App. 1995).  \r\n\r\nFord claims the subornation of perjury by an attorney \r\n  and/or the intentional concealment of documents by an attorney do not constitute \r\n  extrinsic fraud because they do not defeat the opposing partyâ€™s opportunity \r\n  to litigate the matter.  Ford further asserts, because perjury and discovery \r\n  abuse  should be ferreted out during the course of litigation, disappointed \r\n  parties should not be permitted to reopen final judgments on this basis.  We \r\n  disagree.  \r\nThe subornation of perjury by an attorney and/or the intentional \r\n  concealment of documents by an attorney are actions which constitute extrinsic \r\n  fraud.  Contrary to perjury by a witness or a partyâ€™s failure to disclose requested \r\n  materials, conduct which constitutes intrinsic fraud, where an attorney - an \r\n  officer of the court - suborns perjury or intentionally conceals documents, \r\n  he or she effectively precludes the opposing party from having his day in court. [5]   These actions by an attorney \r\n  constitute extrinsic fraud.  [6]     \r\n                          &nbsp; \r\n Moreover, we note that, while their analysis does not \r\n  turn on the categorization of fraud as intrinsic or extrinsic, numerous jurisdictions \r\n  hold an attorneyâ€™s subornation of perjury and/or the intentional concealment \r\n  of documents constitute fraud upon the court.  See Kupferman v. Consol. \r\n  Research &amp; Mfg. Corp., 459 F.2d 1072 (2d Cir. 1972) (institution of \r\n  action by attorney who knew that there was complete defense to action might \r\n  be fraud upon the court); Great Coastal Express, Inc., v. Intâ€™l Brotherhood \r\n  of Teamsters, 675 F.2d 1349, 1357 (4th Cir. 1982) (â€œ[I]nvolvement \r\n  of an attorney, as an officer of the court, in a scheme to suborn perjury would \r\n  certainly be considered fraud on the court.â€); Cleveland Demolition Co. v. \r\n  Azcon Scrap Corp., 827 F.2d 984, 986 (4th Cir. 1987) (â€œA verdict \r\n  may be set aside for fraud on the court if an attorney and a witness have conspired \r\n  to present perjured testimony.â€); Rozier v. Ford Motor Co., 573 F.2d \r\n  1332 (5th Cir. 1978) (fabrication of evidence where attorney is implicated \r\n  is fraud upon the court); H.K. Porter Co. v. Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber, \r\n  536 F.2d 1115, 1119 (6th Cir. 1976) (â€œSince attorneys are officers \r\n  of the court, their conduct, if dishonest, would constitute fraud on the court.â€); \r\n  Dixon v. Commâ€™n of Internal Revenue, 2003 WL 1216290 (9th \r\n  Cir. 2003) (fraud on the court occurred where attorneys entered into secret \r\n  settlement agreements with taxpayers in exchange for false testimony); Synanon \r\n  Found., Inc., v. Bernstein, 503 A.2d 1254 (D.C. 1986) (attorney subornation \r\n  of perjury and false statements to trial court constitute fraud upon the court); \r\n  Porcelli v. Joseph Schlitz Brewing Co., 78 F.R.D. 499 (E.D. Wis. 1978) \r\n  (noting distinction between perjury involving officers of the court and witness \r\n  or party); see 12 James Wm. Moore et al., Mooreâ€™s Federal Practice \r\n  Â¶ 60-21[4][b] (3d ed. 2002).                   \r\nAttorney fraud calls into question the integrity of the \r\n  judiciary and erodes public confidence in the fairness of our system of justice.  \r\n  Accordingly, where an attorney embarks on a scheme to either suborn perjury \r\n  or intentionally conceal documents, extrinsic fraud constituting a fraud upon \r\n  the court occurs. [7]    \r\nII.\r\nFord contends the Court of Appeals erred by finding Chewningâ€™s complaint \r\n  sufficiently alleged fraud upon the court.  Specifically, Ford claims Chewningâ€™s \r\n  amended complaint is fatally deficient because it fails to allege  Bickerstaff \r\n  offered any perjured testimony suborned by Fordâ€™s attorneys in Chewningâ€™s trial.  \r\n  Furthermore, Ford asserts Bickerstaff offered opinion, rather than fact, testimony \r\n  and, therefore, his testimony can not form the basis of a fraud claim.  We disagree.\r\nIn his amended complaint, Chewning alleged Ford, \r\n  its attorneys, and Bickerstaff had a â€œsecret strategy to deal with the defenseâ€ \r\n  of numerous actions against Ford concerning the design of the Bronco II.  Chewning \r\n  claimed that â€œFordâ€™s attorneys knowingly purchased and used the false testimony \r\n  [of Bickerstaff] . . . and concealed this from Plaintiffs.â€  Specifically, Chewning \r\n  asserted â€œ[Ford] would use the favorable and  untruthful testimony of Bickerstaff \r\n  fraudulently to create evidence that the Bronco II was designed in a safe and \r\n  reliable manner.â€  Additionally, he averred â€œFord and its attorneys would hide \r\n  and cover up any unfavorable engineering documents characterized as â€˜criticalâ€™ \r\n  and/or field tests [of the Bronco II].â€  \r\nThe amended complaint refers to two \r\n  specific documents which Chewning alleges were improperly withheld from him \r\n  during the course of discovery in his underlying action.  One of these documents \r\n  is denominated the â€œBickerstaff letter.â€  This letter, dated June 20, 1990, \r\n  is from Bickerstaff to two of Fordâ€™s attorneys.  The letter states, in part:  \r\n  â€œI feel I should be reimbursed my current rate.  I would suggest you retain \r\n  our services to assist you in preparing myself, in Fordâ€™s favor, as we discussed \r\n  per our phone conversation of 6/18/90.â€  \r\nChewning alleged Bickerstaff had been identified as a fact witness \r\n  in an earlier Bronco II case (the Rosenbusch case). [8]   According to Chewning, Fordâ€™s attorneys met \r\n  with Bickerstaff prior to his July 1990 deposition in that case and agreed to \r\n  represent him personally.  The amended complaint alleges the Bickerstaff letter, \r\n  which was â€œnot disclose[d] to any attorneys for plaintiffs in any case until \r\n  years later,â€ is evidence Bickerstaff offered to testify falsely on Fordâ€™s behalf \r\n  in return for substantial sums of money and Ford, through its attorneys, Anderson \r\n  and Seitz, agreed to pay money, â€œdisguised as payments on purchase orders for \r\n  â€˜consultingâ€™ workâ€ unrelated to his Bronco II testimony.  Chewning alleged Bickerstaff \r\n  testified falsely in at least thirty Bronco II cases, including his own, and \r\n  specifically referred to his untruthful testimony in the Cammack and Crenshaw \r\n  cases.  A second document, the â€œVehicle Design and Testing Memo,â€ is a memorandum \r\n  from Ford to the Arizona Proving Ground acknowledging jacking, stability, and \r\n  design problems with the Bronco II.  Part of this memorandum states it was impossible \r\n  for Ford to develop specific test criteria to assess the Bronco IIâ€™s adequacy.  \r\n  At trial, however, Ford presented a computer model which established the Bronco \r\n  II was stable.  Chewning asserts, if he had had the Vehicle Design and Testing \r\n  Memo, he could have attacked the computer model.  \r\nChewningâ€™s amended complaint contains sufficient allegations of fraud upon \r\n  the court.  Although it fails to identify any specific portion of Bickerstaffâ€™s \r\n  trial testimony as perjurious, the amended complaint alleges Fordâ€™s attorneys \r\n  hired Bickerstaff to testify falsely during numerous Bronco II trials. [9]   Under this allegation, most all of Bickerstaffâ€™s testimony \r\n  -- including that presented at Chewningâ€™s trial -- was perjurious.  Moreover, \r\n  assuming Bickerstaff testified as an expert for Ford and gave his opinion on \r\n  the stability of the Bronco II, his testimony would nonetheless be untruthful \r\n  if he was hired to testify falsely for Ford.  Contrary to Fordâ€™s claims, if \r\n  Fordâ€™s attorneys hired Bickerstaff to testify falsely and knowingly withheld \r\n  critical documents in Bronco II trials, including Chewningâ€™s trial, Chewning \r\n  would have been prevented from fully exhibiting and presenting his case.  The \r\n  attorneysâ€™ misconduct would constitute extrinsic fraud.  If proven by clear \r\n  and convincing evidence, the attorneysâ€™ actions would constitute fraud upon \r\n  the court.  The Court of Appeals properly found Chewningâ€™s amended complaint \r\n  sufficiently stated a claim for fraud on the court so as to survive Fordâ€™s Rule \r\n  12(b)(6) motion to dismiss.  Toussaint v. Ham, supra (Rule 12(b)(6) \r\n  motion may not be sustained if facts alleged and reasonable inferences would \r\n  entitle the plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe recognize that important benefits are achieved by the \r\n  preservation of final judgments.  This opinion, with its unique facts, in no \r\n  way alters the Courtâ€™s longstanding policy towards final judgments.  Again, \r\n  any claim of fraud upon the court must be accompanied by particularized allegations.  \r\n  Claims which are not made in good faith are subject to sanction pursuant to \r\n  Rule 11, SCRCP.\r\nThe remaining issue is affirmed pursuant to Rule 220, SCACR and the following \r\n  authorities:  Id., 292 S.C. 415, 357 S.E.2d 8 (1987) (Rule 12(b)(6) motion \r\n  may not be sustained if facts alleged and inferences reasonably deducible therefrom \r\n  would entitle plaintiff to any relief on any theory of the case); Williams \r\n  v. Condon, 347 S.C. 227, 553 S.E.2d 496 (Ct. App. 2001) (in review of motion \r\n  to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6) appellate court applies the same standard \r\n  of review implemented by the trial court).           \r\nThe Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Fordâ€™s present attorneys did not represent Ford during the underlying litigation.   \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Chewningâ€™s amended complaint alleged two claims against the defendants:  fraud \r\n    upon the court and an independent action in equity for fraud.  The trial judge \r\n    dismissed both causes of action.  Chewning appealed the dismissal of his fraud \r\n    upon the court cause of action; this was the only cause of action addressed \r\n    by the Court of Appeals.  Chewning v. Ford Motor Co., supra.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   \r\n    In Davis v. Davis, 236 S.C. 277,  113 S.E.2d 819 (1960), the Court \r\n    considered the effect of an attorneyâ€™s statement to the lower court during \r\n    a divorce action.  The Court determined that, by representing to the court \r\n    that a party was in default when she was not, â€œ[t]his reasonably may be held \r\n    to have been extrinsic fraud upon her and upon the courtâ€ and vacated a prior \r\n    judgment as a result.  Id. S.C. at 281, S.E.2d at 821 (1960).  The \r\n    Court noted the attorneyâ€™s representation was a â€œbona fide mistakeâ€ and, â€œtherefore, \r\n    constructive, rather than actual, fraud.â€  Id. at 281, S.E.2d at 821-22.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [4] Like South Carolina, \r\n    federal courts recognize that perjury or use of a fraudulent document, without \r\n    more, does not constitute fraud on the court.  See United States \r\n    v. Throckmorton, 98 U.S. (8 Otto) 61, 66 (1878) (â€œ. . . the doctrine is \r\n    equally well settled that the court will not set aside a judgment because \r\n    it was founded on a fraudulent instrument, or perjured evidence. . . .â€); \r\n    Geo. P. Reintjes Co. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 71 F.3d 44, 49 (1st \r\n    Cir. 1996) (â€œ. . . perjury alone, absent allegation of involvement by an officer \r\n    of the court . . . has never been sufficient [to constitute fraud upon the \r\n    court justifying collateral attack]â€) (citing numerous cases); Great Coastal \r\n    Express v. Intâ€™l Bhd. of Teamsters, 675 F.2d 1349, 1357 (4th \r\n    Cir. 1982) (â€œ. . . courts confronting the issue have consistently held that \r\n    perjury or fabricated evidence are not grounds for relief as â€˜fraud on the \r\n    courtâ€™.â€) (citing numerous additional cases).    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    See In the Matter of Goodwin, 279 S.C. 274, 305 S.E.2d 578 (1983) \r\n    (attorney has an ethical duty not to perpetrate a fraud upon the court by \r\n    knowingly presenting perjured testimony).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  In Bankers Trust Co. \r\n    v. Braten, 317 S.C. 547, 455 S.E.2d 199 (Ct. App. 1995), the Court \r\n    of Appeals declined to find extrinsic fraud where it was alleged an attorney \r\n    had perpetrated fraud upon two courts in earlier litigation.  The Court of \r\n    Appeals noted the defending party was aware of the alleged misrepresentations \r\n    when they occurred and, in fact, challenged the misrepresentations in one \r\n    proceeding.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals concluded there was no evidence \r\n    the alleged fraud prevented the defending party from presenting his case in \r\n    full.  \r\n  The Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis is consistent with our decision today.   A \r\n    party does not have a claim for extrinsic fraud if he failed to exercise due \r\n    diligence in discovering the existence of facts or documents during the underlying \r\n    litigation.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7]  \r\n    We note, because fraud upon the court is an affront to the administration \r\n    of justice, a litigant who has been defrauded need not establish prejudice.  \r\n    Hazel-Atlas Glass Co. v. Hartford-Empire Co., supra; Dixon \r\n    v. Commâ€™n of Internal Revenue, 2003 WL 1216290 (9th Cir. 2003) \r\n    (â€œ . . . the perpetrator of the fraud [upon the court] should not be allowed \r\n    to dispute the effectiveness of the fraud after the fact.â€).    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]  \r\n    By way of background, the amended complaint explains Bickerstaff  was an engineer \r\n    for Ford who worked on the design and testing of the Ford Bronco II; it alleges \r\n    he was critical of the Bronco IIâ€™s stability, became â€œdisaffected,â€ and left \r\n    Ford prior to the production of the first Bronco II.    \r\n\r\n \r\n  [9] Furthermore, whether Bickerstaffâ€™s June 20, 1990, letter supports Chewningâ€™s \r\n    claim that Fordâ€™s attorneys hired him to testify falsely does not go to the \r\n    sufficiency of the complaint, but to the sufficiency of the evidence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25628","title":"Wigfall v.

Victor Rawl, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25628\r\nHeard December 5, 2002 - Filed April \r\n  14, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nDavid T. Pearlman and James K. Holmes, both of The Steinberg Law Firm, LLP, \r\n  of Charleston; for Appellant\r\nC. Jo Anne Wessinger and Steven W. Hamm, both of Richardson, Plowden, Carpenter \r\n  &amp; Robinson, PA, of Columbia; for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Alfred Lee Wigfall (â€œWigfallâ€) \r\n  appeals the decision of the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (â€œCommissionâ€) \r\n  limiting his disability to a scheduled member in lieu of awarding him permanent, \r\n  total disability.  The Court of Appeals transferred Wigfallâ€™s direct appeal \r\n  to this Court because he seeks to overturn Singleton v. Young Lumber Company, \r\n  236 S.C. 454, 114 S.E.2d 837 (1960).  We decline to overturn Singleton \r\n  and affirm the Commissionâ€™s order.\r\nFACTS\r\nWigfall sustained a broken left femur in a work related accident.  \r\n  Commission concluded Wigfall suffered a 90% permanent partial disability to \r\n  his leg.  Wigfallâ€™s sole physical injury is to that leg.  The single commissioner \r\n  concluded Wigfallâ€™s injury, employment history, age and educational attainment \r\n  rendered him totally disabled.   However, the single commissioner denied Wigfall \r\n  benefits of total disability, relying on  Singleton, supra.  The \r\n  single commissioner ordered Wigfall be compensated for a single, scheduled injury \r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30(15) (1976).  The full Commission and circuit \r\n  court affirmed the Order. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the exclusive remedy rule violate the Equal Protection\r\nClause of the Constitution? \r\nII.          Does the term â€œimpairment,â€ as used in Singleton, include \r\n  both wage loss and medical considerations?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Should Singletonâ€™s exclusive remedy rule be overruled?\r\n\r\nI\r\nEqual Protection Clause\r\nInitially, Wigfall argues the exclusive remedy rule violates the\r\nEqual Protection Clause. \r\n  [1]   Wigfall raised the issue for the first time before the circuit court.  \r\n  The circuit court did not rule on the issue and Wigfall failed to seek consideration \r\n  of the issue pursuant to Rule 59, SCRCP.  Therefore the issue is not preserved \r\n  for appellate review.  Talley v. South Carolina Higher Educ. Tuition Grants \r\n  Comm., 289 S.C. 483, 347 S.E.2d 99 (1986); see also Schurlknight \r\n  v. City of North Charleston, 345 S.C. 45, 545 S.E.2d 833 (Ct. App. 2001) \r\n  (workersâ€™ compensation case). \r\nII\r\nâ€œImpairmentâ€\r\nWigfall asserts we should interpret the term â€œimpairmentâ€ as used in Singleton \r\n  to include both medical and wage loss considerations.  Therefore, Wigfall asserts \r\n  he would be totally disabled under the Singleton standard if he demonstrates \r\n  his scheduled loss was accompanied by a loss in earning capacity.  We disagree.\r\nThe Singleton Court held:\r\n\r\nWhere the injury is confined to the scheduled member, and there is no impairment \r\n  of any other part of the body because of such injury, the employee is limited \r\n  to the scheduled compensation, even though other considerations such as age, \r\n  lack of training, or other conditions peculiar to the individual, effect a total \r\n  or partial industrial incapacity.  To obtain compensation in addition to \r\n  that scheduled for the injured member, claimant must show that some other part \r\n  of his body is affected.  \r\n\r\nSingleton, 236 S.C. at 471, 114 S.E.2d at 845 (emphasis added).\r\nThe Singleton Court did not intend for the additional \r\n  â€œimpairmentâ€ to be a loss of earning capacity, age, lack of training or any \r\n  other economic factor.  The Singleton Court intended â€œimpairmentâ€ to \r\n  encompass a physical deficiency.  Wigfallâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\nIII\r\nSingleton\r\nTwo competing models of workersâ€™ compensation are of concern in resolving this \r\n  matter.  The first, the economic model, defines disability and incapacity in \r\n  terms of the claimantâ€™s loss of earning capacity as a result of the injury.  \r\n  The second, the medical model, provides awards for disability based upon degrees \r\n  of medical impairment to specified body parts.  Stevenson v. Rice Serv.â€™s, \r\n  Inc., 323 S.C. 113, 473 S.E.2d 699 (1996); Dunmore v. Brooks Veneer Co., \r\n  248 S.C. 326, 149 S.E.2d 766 (1966) (in cases of scheduled losses the compensation \r\n  depends on the character of the injury (the medical model), and not the loss \r\n  of earning capacity (the economic model)); Jewell v. R.B. Pond Co., 198 \r\n  S.C. 86, 15 S.E.2d 684 (1941) (Act has two purposes: 1) to compensate for loss \r\n  of injured employeeâ€™s earning capacity; 2) to indemnify for physical ailments \r\n  in a class of cases legislatively specified). \r\n  [2]   The two models are distinct in parts of the S.C. Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Act and intertwined in other parts.  \r\nSouth Carolina provides three methods to obtain disability \r\n  compensation:  1) total disability under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10; 2) partial \r\n  disability under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20; [3]  and 3) scheduled disability under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-9-30.  The first two methods are premised on the economic model, in \r\n  most instances, while the third method conclusively relies upon the medical \r\n  model with its presumption of lost earning capacity. \r\nA.      S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-10.\r\nA claimant may obtain total disability in one of three \r\n  ways under Â§ 42-9-10.  \r\nFirst, a claimant may be presumptively totally disabled.  As such, a claimant \r\n  must show a physical injury enumerated in Â§ 42-9-10. [4]   However, because the Legislature \r\n  has categorized certain types of injuries as per se totally disabling, \r\n  the claimant need not show a loss of earning capacity.  The loss of earning \r\n  capacity is, like a scheduled loss in Â§ 42-9-30, conclusively presumed.  Therefore, \r\n  even in a category in which the earning capacity serves as a benchmark for disability, \r\n  the Legislature has determined that certain injuries equal a permanent disability \r\n  without the need to consider earning capacity.  See Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ \r\n  Compensation Law, Â§ 83.08 at 83-20.\r\nSecond, a claimant may establish total disability under \r\n  Â§ 42-9-10 by showing an injury, which is not a Â§ 42-9-30 scheduled injury, caused \r\n  sufficient loss of earning capacity to render him totally disabled.  An example \r\n  of such a claim occurred in Coleman v. Quality Concrete Prod.â€™s, Inc., \r\n  245 S.C. 625, 142 S.E.2d 43 (1965), where a claimant experienced a double hernia \r\n  after being injured while at work.  The claimant established the double hernia, \r\n  coupled with a lack of education or adequate job training, made him unable to \r\n  find comparable, stable employment.  The injury, combined with those other factors, \r\n  diminished his earning capacity to such an extent as to entitle him to total \r\n  disability.\r\nThird, a claimant may establish total disability through multiple physical \r\n  injuries. Under this scenario a claimant who has a Â§ 42-9-30 scheduled injury \r\n  must show an additional injury.  Singleton, supra; see \r\n  also McCollum v. Singer Co., 300 S.C. 103, 386 S.E.2d 471 (Ct. \r\n  App. 1989) (Court found claimant totally disabled due to combined partial impairments \r\n  to the back, stomach and leg).\r\nIn Singleton, claimantâ€™s recovery was premised on the theory that an \r\n  injury to a scheduled body part combined with a loss of earning capacity equaled \r\n  total disability.  Neither party disputed that Singletonâ€™s lone physical injury \r\n  was to his leg.  However, a physician testified Singletonâ€™s injury prevented \r\n  him from working in the job for which he was trained.  This Court disagreed \r\n  with Singletonâ€™s theory finding a claimant with a scheduled loss  unaccompanied \r\n  by any other physical injury was entitled only to the benefits of the scheduled \r\n  loss in Â§ 42-9-30 and not total disability under Â§ 42-9-10. [5] \r\nSingleton stands for the exclusive rule that a claimant with one scheduled \r\n  injury is limited to the recovery under Â§ 42-9-30 alone.  The case also stands \r\n  for the rule that an individual is not limited to scheduled benefits under Â§ \r\n  42-9-30 if he can show additional injuries beyond a lone scheduled injury.  \r\n  This principle recognizes â€œthe common-sense fact that, when two or more scheduled \r\n  injuries [or a scheduled and non-scheduled injury] occur together, the disabling \r\n  effect may be far greater than the arithmetical total of the schedule allowances \r\n  added together.â€  Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, 87.05 at 87-8; \r\n  see, e.g., Cunnyngham v. Donovan, 271 F. Supp. 508 (E.D. \r\n  La. 1967); Williams v. Industrial Commâ€™n, 237 P.2d 471 (Ariz. 1951).\r\nB.      S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 42-9-30\r\nA claimant may obtain disability for a scheduled physical injury included in \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1976).  The claimant is not required  to show lost \r\n  earning capacity because the compensation is based on the character of the injury \r\n  and lost earning capacity is conclusively presumed.  Fields v. Owens Corning \r\n  Fiberglas, 301 S.C. 554, 393 S.E.2d 172 (1990); Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  Law, Â§ 86.02 at 86-5 (1999).  As discussed previously, under Singleton \r\n  a claimant with a single scheduled injury may only obtain a scheduled recovery.\r\nWigfall seeks to limit Singleton by establishing a fourth way to obtain \r\n  total disability by allowing a claimant to be totally disabled if he can prove \r\n  a scheduled injury caused sufficient lost earning capacity.  Under this theory \r\n  Wigfall must show a physical injury within the scheduled injuries of Â§ 42-9-30.  He must also show the physical injury has caused him to lose his \r\n  earning capacity, thereby rendering him totally disabled.  \r\nWigfall asserts developments since Singleton buttress his argument.  \r\n  For example, Wigfall points to the Singleton courtâ€™s citation to\r\n2 Schneiderâ€™s Workmenâ€™s Compensation, Â§ 2322 at 567 for the proposition \r\n  that:\r\n\r\n[A] workman sustaining one of the minor injuries for which \r\n  specific compensation is provided under the statute might, because of such injury, \r\n  be unable to resume his employment and, because of his lack of education or \r\n  experience or physical strength or ability, might be unable to obtain other \r\n  employment, does not entitle him to be classed as totally and permanently disabled.\r\n\r\nSingleton, 236 S.C. at 470, 114 S.E.2d at 845.\r\nWigfall asserts the modern trend is contrary to such language.  He contends \r\n  the modern view is â€œ[t]otal disability may be found in the case of workers who, \r\n  while not altogether incapacitated for work, are so handicapped that they will \r\n  not be employed regularly in any well-known branch of the labor market.â€  Larsonâ€™s \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, Â§ 83.01 at 83-3.  \r\nWigfallâ€™s assertion confuses the majority trend in \r\n  statutes premised upon the economic model with the majority view in interpreting \r\n  statutes based on the medical model.  That is, according to Larson, a \r\n  majority of states hold that a claimant may be found totally disabled when an \r\n  unscheduled injury or multiple injuries prevent him from obtaining employment \r\n  regularly in the labor market.  Larson also informs us, however, a majority \r\n  of states continue to follow the rule that an individual with a single scheduled \r\n  injury is limited to compensation under the scheduled injury statute, even if \r\n  the person is unable to obtain regular employment as a result of the injury. \r\n   [6] \r\nSouth Carolina recognizes that a claimant may be totally disabled even though \r\n  he is not altogether incapacitated if such an injury prevents him from obtaining \r\n  regular employment in the labor market.  See Coleman v. Quality Concrete \r\n  Prods., Inc., supra; Colvin v. E.I. Du Pont De Nemours Co., \r\n  227 S.C. 465, 88 S.E.2d 581 (1955); McCollum v. Singer Co., 300 S.C. \r\n  103, 386 S.E.2d 471 (Ct. App. 1989).  In the context of scheduled injuries, \r\n  South Carolina recognizes a claimantâ€™s entitlement to be deemed disabled and \r\n  to receive compensation for an injury even though the claimant is able to work.  \r\n  See Stephenson v. Rice, 323 S.C. 113, 473 S.E.2d 699 (1996).  \r\n  South Carolina has never recognized that a claimant can suffer a single scheduled \r\n  injury and as a result become totally, permanently disabled.  See Singleton, \r\n  supra.  Our decisions are therefore in line with a majority of states.\r\nWigfall cites to several cases for the proposition that states are turning \r\n  from the Singleton exclusive view.  However, the cases are distinguishable \r\n  from Singleton in that they involve claimants with multiple injuries.  \r\n  See, e.g., Whitley v. Columbia Lumber Manuf. Co., 318 N.C. \r\n  89, 348 S.E.2d 336 (N.C. 1986) (claimant suffered injury to multiple scheduled \r\n  members including a right arm and left hand); Van Dorpel v. Haven-Busch Co., \r\n  85 N.W.2d 97 (Mich. 1957) (claimant suffered loss of four fingers and the \r\n  partial amputation of a right leg).  In such cases Singleton would allow  \r\n  an individual to prove total disability.  \r\nAdmittedly, Wigfallâ€™s most alluring argument is the \r\n  complaint of inequity which results from allowing a claimant to establish total \r\n  disability through a single non-scheduled injury plus a loss of earning capacity \r\n  but not allowing a claimant to establish total disability through a single scheduled \r\n  injury plus a significant loss of earning capacity.  The result is an individual \r\n  with a hernia may obtain total disability by showing lost earning capacity, \r\n  while an individual with a scheduled injury may not attain total disability \r\n  even if he could show the scheduled injury caused the claimant to lose his earning \r\n  capacity.\r\nWigfallâ€™s argument is in line with several jurisdictions \r\n  which have rejected the exclusive approach in favor of one which allows a claimant \r\n  who has a scheduled injury to elect total disability if he can prove the injury \r\n  caused the loss of earning capacity.  See, e.g., Langbell v. \r\n  Industrial Commâ€™n, 529 P.2d 227 (Ariz. 1974); Cooper Indus. Prod., Inc. \r\n  v. Worth, 508 S.W.2d 59 (Ark. 1974).  Such jurisdictions base their decisions \r\n  on the inequities resulting from the exclusive approach and the liberal construction \r\n  afforded to workersâ€™ compensation statutes.\r\nWhile we may be inclined to accept Wigfallâ€™s equity argument, \r\n  we decline to do so in the face of the Legislatureâ€™s mandates concerning our \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation system.  Our ruling is based less on concepts of stare \r\n  decisis and more on the acknowledgement that legislative intent is the paramount \r\n  concern when interpreting a statute.\r\n The cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain \r\n  and give effect to the intent of the legislature.  Charleston County Sch. \r\n  Dist. v. State Budget and Control Bd., 313 S.C. 1, 437 S.E.2d 6 (1993).  \r\n  â€œWhat a legislature says in the text of a statute is considered the best evidence \r\n  of the legislative intent or will.â€  Norman J. Singer, Sutherland Statutory \r\n  Construction Â§ 46.03 at 94 (5th ed. 1992).  If a statuteâ€™s language is plain, \r\n  unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning â€œthe rules of statutory interpretation \r\n  are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€  Hodges \r\n  v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 81 (2000).\r\nWe are further bound by precedent to strictly construe statutes in derogation \r\n  of the common law.  Gilfillin v. Gilfillin, 344 S.C. 407, 544 S.E.2d \r\n  829 (2001).  Workersâ€™ compensation statutes provide an exclusive compensatory \r\n  system in derogation of common law rights.  See Caughman v. Columbia \r\n  YMCA, 212 S.C. 337, 47 S.E.2d 788 (1948).   As such, when reading a workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation statute we strictly construe its terms, leaving it to the Legislature \r\n  to amend and define its ambiguities.  \r\n Section 42-9-30 provides:\r\n\r\n  In cases included in the following schedule, the disability in each case shall \r\n  be deemed to continue for the period specified and the compensation so \r\n  paid for such injury shall be as specified therein, to wit:\r\n  . . .\r\n  (15) For the loss of a leg, sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the average \r\n  weekly wages during one hundred ninety-five weeks;\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-30 (1976).\r\nThe term â€œshallâ€ in a statute means that the action is mandatory. \r\n  Montgomery v. Keziah, 277 S.C. 84, 282 S.E.2d 853 (1981).  A plain reading \r\n  of the statute is that in cases in which a claimant loses the use of a leg, \r\n  the disability must continue for one hundred ninety-five weeks and the compensation \r\n  must equal sixty-six and two-thirds percent of the claimantâ€™s average weekly \r\n  wages.  Under such a reading, Wigfall is entitled only to the scheduled benefits \r\n  because he suffers solely from a scheduled disability.\r\nButtressing a plain reading of the statute is the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  inactivity on the issue over the last forty years since Singleton.  The \r\n  Legislature is presumed to be aware of this Courtâ€™s interpretation of its statutes.  \r\n  See State v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, \r\n  525 S.E.2d 872 (2000).  When the Legislature fails over a forty-year period \r\n  to alter a statute, its inaction is evidence the Legislature agrees with this \r\n  Courtâ€™s interpretation.\r\nWigfall asserts decisions by both the Michigan Supreme \r\n  Court and the North Carolina Supreme Court counsel against Singleton.  \r\n  Wigfall cites Van Dorpel v. Haven-Busch Company, 85 N.W.2d 97 (Mich. \r\n  1949), for the proposition that we should not be bound by the forty-year inaction \r\n  of the Legislature in upholding Singleton.  He cites to the North Carolina \r\n  Supreme Courtâ€™s decision in Whitley v. Columbia Lumber Manuf. Co., 348 \r\n  S.E.2d 336 (N.C. 1986), as evidence that Courts should read workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claims liberally to allow for â€œfull compensationâ€ of injured workers in spite \r\n  of â€œspecific exclusive remedy statutory language.â€  See Spoone v. Newsome \r\n  Chevrolet-Buick, 309 S.C. 432, 434, 424 S.E.2d 489, 490 (1992)(â€œBecause \r\n  South Carolina adopted large portions of the North Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation \r\n  legislation, we rely on North Carolina precedent in Workersâ€™ Compensation cases.â€).   \r\n  Wigfallâ€™s reliance is misplaced.  \r\nWigfall, in brief and at oral argument, asserted we should not consider legislative \r\n  inaction to determine legislative intent.  To do so, Wigfall argues, would allow \r\n  a court to fall prey to â€œa Rip Van Winkle doctrine of judicial stagnation and \r\n  inertia.â€  See Van Dorpel, supra.  \r\nThe Michigan Supreme Court in Van Dorpel admitted the disability statute \r\n  it interpreted was â€œsilent on the precise issue involved.â€  Id. at 147. \r\n  Therefore, the Michigan Supreme Court stated that it â€œ37 years ago decided what \r\n  it thought the correct interpretation should be. . . . [but now] happen[s] to \r\n  disagree with that old interpretation and wish[es] to make a new interpretation.â€  \r\n  Id.\r\nThe Michigan Supreme Court faced a situation in which \r\n  it had almost a half-century before interpreted into a statute something which \r\n  was neither required nor forbidden.  Later, with its prior interpretation challenged, \r\n  the court concluded the passage of time counseled that its previous interpretation \r\n  was unjust.  Because the statute itself did not require such a finding, the \r\n  court was not compelled to comply with an unworkable precedent.  Wigfallâ€™s assessment \r\n  of the case overlooks this critical point:  The Michigan Supreme Court was not \r\n  compelled to rely on legislative inaction as its guide because the precedent \r\n  to be overturned was not based on legislative action in the first instance.  \r\n\r\nThe Michigan Supreme Court need not be swayed by acquiescence where the Legislature \r\n  has been silent all along, but this Court must acquiesce where the Legislature \r\n  has stood silent only after its command was heeded in Singleton.  Here \r\n  statutory language commands that where Wigfall sustains a lone scheduled injury \r\n  he may only recover for that scheduled injury.  \r\nIn Whitley, the North Carolina Supreme Court concerned itself with interpreting \r\n  the apparently exclusive phrase â€œin lieu of all other compensationâ€ found in \r\n  its version of the scheduled injury provision of workersâ€™ compensation.  See \r\n  N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-31 (1985) (â€œIn cases included by the following schedule \r\n  the compensation in each case . . . shall be in lieu of all other compensation, \r\n  including disfigurement . . .â€) (emphasis added).\r\nUltimately, the court concluded \r\n  the phrase meant that a claimant may either elect to recover under the stateâ€™s \r\n  total incapacity statute, N.C. Gen. Stat. Â§ 97-29 (1985), or under its scheduled \r\n  loss section.  The benefit was the claimant, who could not prove total disability \r\n  due to lost earning capacity, could receive compensation under Â§ 97-31, where \r\n  lost earning capacity was presumed.  However, if the claimant could prove lost \r\n  earning capacity was total and permanent, they could elect to receive compensation \r\n  under Â§ 97-29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nThe North Carolina court reached its decision after \r\n  examining the legislative history of the act relying mainly on the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  actions following Stanley v. Hyman-Michaels Co., 222 N.C. 257, 22 S.E.2d \r\n  570 (1942).  In Stanley the North Carolina Supreme Court ruled a claimant \r\n  who had multiple scheduled losses may recover under the total disability statute \r\n  instead of the scheduled loss statute.  The Stanley court also allowed \r\n  the claimant double recovery under the statute for disfigurement and loss of \r\n  a scheduled member.  See id.                  \r\nIn response, the North Carolina General Assembly \r\n  amended the scheduled member statute to include the â€œin lieuâ€ language.  See \r\n  generally, J. Cameron Furr, Jr., Note, Whitley v. Columbia Lumber Manufacturing \r\n  Co.:  Abolishing the Exclusive Remedy Requirement for the Scheduled Injuries \r\n  Section of the North Carolina Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, 66 N.C. L. Rev. \r\n  1365 (1988) (provides case analysis and critique of Whitley decision).  \r\n  Instead of making the scheduled loss statute operate as an exclusive remedy \r\n  to those who had scheduled injuries, the Whitley court construed the \r\n  legislative action as only precluding double recovery.  See Whitley, \r\n  318 N.C. at 97, 348 S.E.2d at 340.  The court also found additional legislative \r\n  acts to strike the time limitations in the total disability statute indicated \r\n  its intent â€œto address the plight of a worker who suffers an injury permanently \r\n  abrogating his earning ability.â€  Id.  The court thus read those legislative \r\n  amendments to reveal legislative intent for the claimant to choose the more \r\n  favorable remedy.  See id.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nWith the intent of the legislature to allow greater \r\n  recovery for claimants whose scheduled injuries caused total disability, the \r\n  Whitley court argued other policy considerations required a finding that \r\n  the â€œin lieuâ€ language did not make the scheduled loss statute operate as an \r\n  exclusive remedy.  Chief among those policy considerations was the goal of workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation to compensate claimants for their loss of wage earning capacity.  \r\n  See id.  Making the scheduled loss statute an exclusive remedy \r\n  would not truly compensate claimants for their full loss of earning capacity.  \r\n  However, allowing a claimant with a scheduled injury to receive total and permanent \r\n  disability status would compensate for such a loss if the individual proved \r\n  a significant diminishment of earning capacity.  See id.\r\nFinally, the Whitley court relied on principles \r\n  of statutory construction to hold the â€œin lieuâ€ language did not provide a claimant \r\n  with an exclusive remedy under Â§ 97-31.  The court, in recognizing the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent to compensate claimants whose scheduled injury causes total disability \r\n  and the policy considerations underlying workersâ€™ compensation, professed that \r\n  to narrowly construe the statute to limit recovery would not be equitable.  \r\n  Further, the court concluded any ambiguity must be resolved in favor of the \r\n  claimant whom the Legislature intended to be compensated if they could prove \r\n  their scheduled loss caused total disability through a complete loss of earning \r\n  capacity.  See id. at 97, 348 S.E.2d at 340. \r\n\r\nâ€œThe [North Carolina] supreme \r\n  court therefore concluded that the intent of the general assembly, the policy \r\n  considerations, and the inequity of restricting the employeeâ€™s recovery required \r\n  that [Â§] 97-31 not function as an exclusive remedy when the employee is totally \r\n  and permanently disabled.â€  Furr, supra at 1368.  \r\nAlthough North Carolina workersâ€™ \r\n  compensation case law retains a special significance in this state, our own \r\n  Legislatureâ€™s pronouncements of the law must necessarily prevail.  The scheduled \r\n  benefits section of Â§ 42-9-60 is not similar to the language of Â§ 97-31.  The \r\n  intent of the South Carolina Legislature is clear by its use of mandatory language.  \r\n  Further, the inaction to legislatively amend Â§ 42-9-60 demonstrates the Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  intent to allow Singleton to remain effective.  Contrasted with our Legislatureâ€™s \r\n  acquiescence to Singleton is the North Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s interpretation \r\n  of its own Legislatureâ€™s actions demonstrating an intent to move away from the \r\n  exclusive remedy rule.\r\nOur view of the South Carolina \r\n  Workersâ€™ Compensation Act, in terms of public policy considerations and equity \r\n  principles, is materially different from the North Carolina Supreme Courtâ€™s \r\n  view of its own statute. Workersâ€™ compensation statutes abrogate traditional \r\n  common law approaches to compensate workers injured on the job.  With rare exceptions, \r\n  workersâ€™ compensation displaces tort law with a no-fault system for on-the-job \r\n  injuries.  But see S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-60 (Supp. 2001) (barring \r\n  an intoxicated employee from receiving workersâ€™ compensation).\r\nBy displacing traditional tort \r\n  law the Legislature intended to provide a no-fault system focusing on quick \r\n  recovery, relatively ascertainable awards and limited litigation.  See \r\n  Furr, supra at 1373; Taylor v. J.P. Stevens and Co., 59 \r\n  N.C. 643, 645, 292 S.E.2d 277, 279 (N.C. Ct. App. 1982), modified and affâ€™d, \r\n  307 N.C. 392, 298 S.E.2d 681 (1983) (citing Barnhardt v. Yellow Cab Co., \r\n  266 N.C. 419, 423, 146 S.E.2d 479, 484 (1966)).  In exchange for these benefits, \r\n  the parties and society as a whole bear some costs.  \r\nOne such cost is workersâ€™ compensation \r\n  claims may not be equitable in all situations.  See Potomac Electric \r\n  Power Co. v. Director, Office of Workersâ€™ Compensation Programs, U.S. Dept of \r\n  Labor, 449 U.S. 268, 281 (1980) (â€œRespondents . . . argue that the Act should \r\n  be interpreted in a manner which provides a complete and adequate remedy, to \r\n  an injured employee. Implicit in this argument, however, is the assumption that \r\n  the sole purpose of the Act was to provide disabled workers with a complete \r\n  remedy for their industrial injuries.  The inaccuracy of this implicit assumption \r\n  undercuts the validity of respondentsâ€™ argument.â€). â€œThe schedule brings a windfall \r\n  to the worker in some cases and gross hardship to the worker in others.â€  Graves \r\n  v. Eagle Iron Works, 331 N.W.2d 116, 120 (Iowa 1983). \r\n  [7]   \r\nIt is essential to remember that \r\n  the Legislature created a system, for good or ill, which â€œserve[s] a social \r\n  function by providing the injured employee with sufficient income and medical \r\n  care to keep him from destitution. . . . [they] are not designed to compensate \r\n  the employee for his injury, but merely to provide him with the bare minimum \r\n  of income and medical care to keep him from being a burden to others.â€  Gary \r\n  A. Scarzafava and Frank Herrera, Jr., Workplace Safety - The Prophylactic \r\n  and Compensatory Rights of the Employee, 13 St. Maryâ€™s L.J. 911, 944 (1982) \r\n  (quoting Arthur Larson, The Nature and Origins of Workmenâ€™s Compensation, \r\n  37 Cornell L.Q. 206, 209-10, 213 (1952)).  However, such sources of inequities \r\n  are the province of the Legislature to correct by balancing the interests, risks \r\n  and rewards of such a large, comprehensive program.  This Court may only take \r\n  such equitable arguments into account where legislative intent and statutory \r\n  language are not clear.\r\nOur decision does not dispute \r\n  that the result Wigfall desires may be, in the abstract, the most just result \r\n  of those in his condition.  Nor does it dispute the idea that equity may continue \r\n  to play a part in this Courtâ€™s decision-making process.  Our decision does maintain \r\n  the rule that equity cannot prevail over a positive legislative enactment.  \r\n  Town of Zebulon v. Dawson, 216 N.C. 520, 5 S.E.2d 535 (1939).  As the \r\n  South Carolina Court of Appeals explained:\r\n\r\nThere is a sound reason for this principle.  An important function of legislation \r\n  is to consider and to balance the competing interests and equities arising from \r\n  the conduct of human affairs.  Workerâ€™s compensation laws are a classic example \r\n  of this legislative balancing of the equities.  When the legislature has struck \r\n  a balance by enacting a statutory rule, the courts have no prerogative to annul \r\n  the legislative choice by applying â€œchancellorâ€™s footâ€ notions of equity in \r\n  its place.  Stated differently, â€œ[I]t is not the province of this Court to perform \r\n  legislative functions.â€  The function of equity is to supplement the law, not \r\n  to displace it.  \r\n\r\nSpoon v. Newsome Chevrolet Buick, 306 S.C. 438, 440 412 S.E.2d 434, \r\n  434-35 (Ct. App. 1991), affirmed 309 S.C. 432, 424 S.E.2d 489 (1992) \r\n  (citations omitted). \r\nWe â€œare not at liberty to extend by construction the meaning implicit in the \r\n  language found in the Workmenâ€™s [sic] Compensation Act in order to provide a \r\n  more liberal rule of compensation than that which the legislature has seen fit \r\n  to adopt.â€ Singleton, 236 S.C. at 473, 114 S.E.2d at 846 (citing \r\n  Rudd v. Fairforest Finishing Co., 189 S.C. 188, 200 S.E. 727 (1939)). [8]   Therefore, when Wigfall urges us to adhere \r\n  to other precedent liberally construing the Workersâ€™ Compensation Act in order \r\n  to expand coverage not to limit it, we must refrain.  See Peay v. \r\n  United States Silica Co., 313 S.C. 91, 437 S.E.2d 64 (1993).  We may apply \r\n  such rules of statutory construction when the meaning of the act is ambiguous.  \r\n  We may not, however, read a statute liberally when the legislative enactment \r\n  is susceptible of only one inference.  We cannot read â€œshallâ€ in Â§ 42-9-30 to \r\n  mean anything other than an exclusive â€œmustâ€, just as we cannot read 195 weeks \r\n  in 42-9-30(15) to mean anything other than 195 weeks, no more and no less.\r\nBecause the Legislatureâ€™s intent is clear from the statuteâ€™s language and the \r\n  decision by the Legislature not to statutorily overturn Singleton, we \r\n  affirm the rule that where a claimant has only one scheduled injury his recovery \r\n  is pursuant Â§ 42-9-30.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above reasons we AFFIRM the Commission.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] U.S. Const. Amend. XIV, Â§ 1.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    Under the medical model loss of earning capacity is not irrelevant.  Instead, \r\n    the Legislature has statutorily presumed lost earning capacity for certain \r\n    scheduled injuries even where the employee is still capable of working.  See \r\n    G. E. Moore Co. v. Walker, 232 S.C. 320, 102 S.E.2d 106 (1958); 4 Arthur \r\n    Larson &amp; Lex K. Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, Â§ 86.02 \r\n    at 86-5 (1999) (in scheduled benefits diminishment of earning capacity is \r\n    conclusively presumed).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   A claimant may obtain partial permanent disability \r\n    under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-9-20 (1976).  To do so a claimant must show an injury \r\n    and a loss of earning capacity.  Roper v. Kimbrellâ€™s of Greenville, Inc., \r\n    231 S.C. 453, 99 S.E.2d 52 (1957).  Because Wigfall claims he is totally disabled, \r\n    this statute is not applicable.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   \r\n    The list of injuries included in the presumptive total disability category \r\n    include:  â€œ[t]he loss of both hands, arms, feet, legs, or vision in both eyes, \r\n    or any two thereof, constitutes total and permanent disability to be compensated \r\n    according to the provisions of this sectionâ€ or that claimant â€œis a paraplegic, \r\n    a quadriplegic, or who has suffered physical brain damage. . . .â€  S.C. Code \r\n    Ann. Â§ 42-9-10.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [5] The Singleton court did not address whether a person who has multiple \r\n    physical impairments must also show lost earning capacity to qualify as totally \r\n    disabled.  Dicta in the case seems to suggest that lost earning capacity is \r\n    irrelevant.  The Court of Appeals in McCollum v. Singer Co., supra, \r\n    found claimant totally disabled due to combined partial impairments to the \r\n    back, stomach and leg because it found that such injuries combined carried \r\n    a presumption of lost earning capacity.  The question  whether a claimant \r\n    with multiple injuries in the Singleton context must prove a sufficient \r\n    lost earning capacity to be deemed totally disabled is an issue raised in \r\n    this appeal.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]  \r\n    For those states adhering to the exclusive rule see: Ratliff v.

King, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.25629\r\nHeard March 4, 2003 - Filed April 14, \r\n  2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nC. Rauch Wise, of Greenwood, for petitioners.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General Charles H. Richardson, and Assistant \r\n  Attorney General Melody J. Brown, all of Columbia; and Solicitor C. Kelly Jackson, \r\n  of Sumter, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Petitioners Claude and Phil Humphries \r\n  were convicted of trafficking in marijuana. They were each sentenced to twenty-five \r\n  years imprisonment and fined $25,000.  The Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions.  \r\n  State v. Humphries, 346 S.C. 435, 551 S.E.2d 286 (Ct. App. 2001).  We \r\n  granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and now \r\n  reverse.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to order \r\n  the State to disclose the identity of the confidential informant?  \r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Did the Court of Appeals err by holding improperly admitted â€œbad act evidenceâ€ \r\n  was harmless error?  \r\n\r\nI.\r\nPetitioners argue the Court of Appeals erred by affirming \r\n  the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to require the State to disclose the identity of the \r\n  confidential informant.  They assert the confidential informant was a material \r\n  witness, not a tipster.  We disagree. \r\nAt the beginning of trial, petitioners requested the court \r\n  order the State to disclose the name of the confidential informant.  The assistant \r\n  solicitor stated the confidential informant was not a material witness, but \r\n  simply notified law enforcement that a package containing drugs was going to \r\n  be delivered by United Parcel Service (UPS) to petitionersâ€™ automotive garage. [1]   The assistant solicitor further stated, as a result of the \r\n  confidential informantâ€™s tip, a UPS package addressed to petitionersâ€™ garage \r\n  was seized by law enforcement, a drug detection dog identified the package as \r\n  containing drugs, and the package was later delivered to the garage by an undercover \r\n  officer disguised as a UPS employee.  The confidential informant was not present \r\n  when the package was seized, the dog identified the package as containing drugs, \r\n  or when the package was delivered to the garage by the undercover officer.\r\n The trial judge ruled he was â€œnot convinced \r\n  at this point that the confidential informant was more than a mere tipster.â€  \r\n  He advised petitioners that, should it develop during trial that the informant \r\n  was a material witness, he would entertain a new motion for disclosure.  \r\nAlthough the State is generally privileged from revealing \r\n  the name of a confidential informant, disclosure may be required when the informantâ€™s \r\n  identity is relevant and helpful to the defense or is essential for a fair determination \r\n  of the Stateâ€™s case against the accused.  State v. Shupper, 263 S.C. \r\n  53, 207 S.E.2d 799 (1974).  For instance, if the informant is an active participant \r\n  in the criminal transaction and/or a material witness on the issue of guilt \r\n  or innocence, disclosure of his identity may be required depending upon the \r\n  facts and circumstances.  State v. Burney, 294 S.C. 61, 362 S.E.2d 635 \r\n  (1987); State v. Diamond, 280 S.C. 296, 312 S.E.2d 550 (1984); State \r\n  v. Batson, 261 S.C. 128, 198 S.E.2d 517 (1973).  On the other hand, an informantâ€™s \r\n  identity need not be disclosed where he possesses only a peripheral knowledge \r\n  of the crime or is a mere â€œtipsterâ€ who supplies a lead to law enforcement.  \r\n  State v. Burney, supra; State v. Wright, 322 S.C. 484, \r\n  472 S.E.2d 642 (Ct. App. 1987).  The burden is upon the defendant to show the \r\n  facts and circumstances entitling him to the disclosure.  State v. Shupper, \r\n  supra.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals correctly held the trial judge did \r\n  not abuse his discretion by failing to require the prosecution to disclose the \r\n  name of the confidential informant.  At the time he made his ruling, \r\n  the only information before the trial judge was that the confidential informant \r\n  notified law enforcement that a package containing illegal narcotics would be \r\n  delivered by UPS to petitionersâ€™ garage.  Petitioners failed to meet their burden \r\n  establishing the informant was anything more than a mere tipster.\r\nII.\r\nThe majority of the Court of Appealsâ€™ panel held \r\n  the trial judge erred by admitting certain â€œbad act evidenceâ€ under the common \r\n  scheme or plan exception in Rule 404(b), SCRE; it nonetheless concluded the \r\n  erroneous admission was harmless.  State v. Humphries, supra. \r\n  [2]   The controversial evidence is testimony by Jeffrey Seruya, a prior \r\n  employee, which suggests Petitioner Claude Humphries had marijuana delivered \r\n  to Seruyaâ€™s residence after Claudeâ€™s arrest on the underlying criminal charge. [3]   \r\nThe Court of Appeals erred by concluding Seruyaâ€™s testimony concerning \r\n  Claudeâ€™s delivery of marijuana to his residence and his redelivery of the marijuana \r\n  to Claude was harmless error.  The evidence against petitioners consisted \r\n  of 1) acceptance of a package delivered from UPS with a return address from \r\n  an automotive parts business in California (at the time of petitionersâ€™ arrest, \r\n  the package had not been opened, or, apparently, even moved from where Phil \r\n  placed it upon its receipt); 2) $4500 in cash (wrapped in a rag and stored in \r\n  a desk drawer at an automotive garage) with the scent of narcotics; and 3) Seruyaâ€™s \r\n  testimony stating he was suspicious illegal activity was taking place at C&amp;J \r\n  Automotive, was told not to open packages from California during his employment, \r\n  and claimed the package seized by law enforcement from C&amp;J Automotive was \r\n  similar in appearance (i.e., brown box with gummed label) to those boxes he \r\n  was told not to open.  While these factors constitute some evidence of guilt, \r\n  Seruyaâ€™s testimony suggesting Claude had marijuana sent to Seruyaâ€™s residence \r\n  and later retrieved it from Seruya was highly significant as it was the only \r\n  direct evidence of Claudeâ€™s intent to deal in marijuana.  Since we conclude \r\n  Seruyaâ€™s testimony concerning Claudeâ€™s delivery of marijuana to his residence \r\n  and his redelivery to Claude was not harmless, we reverse petitionersâ€™ convictions.\r\nREVERSED. \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., \r\n  concur.  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.&nbsp;\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   \r\n    Petitioner Claude Humphries owned C&amp;J Automotive.  At times, his brother, \r\n    Petitioner Phil Humphries, worked at C&amp;J.    \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    The State argues the Court of Appeals erred by holding the trial judge improperly \r\n    ruled the â€œbad act evidenceâ€ was admissible as a common scheme or plan under \r\n    Rule 404(b), SCRE.   In essence, the State asks the Court to affirm the judgment \r\n    for any ground appearing in the Record on Appeal.  Rule 220(c), SCACR.  We \r\n    decline to do so.  Iâ€™On, L.L.C., v.

We affirm in part, and reverse in part.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant/respondent John McPherson Scott (Father) \r\n  and respondent/appellant Deirdre Erwin Scott (Mother) married on May 18, 1991.  \r\n  It was the second marriage for both.  Mother had custody of Kristen Martin, \r\n  her daughter from her previous marriage, [1]  but Father had no children from \r\n  his previous marriage.  On June 30, 1993, Caitlyn was born.\r\nFather filed for divorce in September \r\n  1998 on the ground of Motherâ€™s adultery.  He sought custody of both his daughter \r\n  Caitlyn and his step-daughter Kristen. [2]   After a hearing in October 1998, \r\n  the family court issued a temporary order on November 9, 1998, granting Father \r\n  temporary custody of Caitlyn and awarding visitation to Mother every other weekend \r\n  and every other Wednesday evening.  The temporary order granted Mother custody \r\n  of Kristen and stated that Father could have visitation with her, but this visitation \r\n  would be subject to Kristenâ€™s wishes.  The temporary order further designated \r\n  Motherâ€™s visitation for Thanksgiving and Christmas of that year.  The order \r\n  did not, however, make any provisions for summer 1999 visitation.  A Guardian \r\n  Ad Litem (GAL) was appointed to represent the interests of Kristen and Caitlyn.\r\nThe final divorce hearing took place January \r\n  29 through February 2, 2001.  At that time, Caitlyn was 7 years old and Kristen \r\n  was 16 years old.  During the over two years that the marital litigation was \r\n  pending, Father refused to agree to any visitation not specified in the temporary \r\n  order, and Mother went back to the family court no less than three times for \r\n  modifications of her visitation. [3] \r\n  \r\nThe primary issue at the lengthy divorce \r\n  hearing was custody of Caitlyn. [4] \r\n    Evidence regarding both Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s capacity to alienate the \r\n  other from Caitlyn was presented.  For example, Kristenâ€™s relationship with \r\n  Martin, her biological father, and the litigation regarding Martinâ€™s and Martinâ€™s \r\n  parentsâ€™ visitation with Kristen, was discussed extensively.  In sum, the evidence \r\n  revealed that Mother and Father worked together in an attempt to prevent both \r\n  Martin and his parents from maintaining a relationship with Kristen. \r\nFather also evidenced a capacity to alienate \r\n  Caitlyn from Mother.  Generally, he was inflexible regarding Motherâ€™s visitation.  \r\n  As discussed above, Father fought Motherâ€™s efforts regarding summer visitation \r\n  and clearly would not allow Mother anything other than what was specified in \r\n  the temporary order.  In addition, there was the so-called â€œBrownie incident.â€  \r\n  Mother attended a Brownie event with Caitlyn.  Father also showed up at the \r\n  event and apparently was incensed by Motherâ€™s presence since it was his weekend \r\n  with Caitlyn.  He called the Brownie troop leader that night and threatened \r\n  to have her â€œdisbarredâ€ as a troop leader.  He subsequently removed Caitlyn \r\n  from that troop.\r\nIn addition to the evidence regarding the parentsâ€™ \r\n  potential for alienation, there were numerous other factual issues explored \r\n  at the hearing. Most were disputed -- a true â€œhe said-she saidâ€ situation.  \r\n  For example, there was conflicting testimony as to who was Caitlynâ€™s â€œprimary \r\n  caretakerâ€ prior to the partiesâ€™ separation, exactly how much Father traveled \r\n  with his job prior to the separation, when Mother exposed the children to her \r\n  paramour, etc.  Nonetheless, there was agreement that both Father and Mother \r\n  love Caitlyn and that Caitlyn has a strong bond with both parents.\r\nThe GAL submitted a \r\n  written report and also testified at the hearing.  He noted several times that \r\n  the custody issue was an extremely â€œclose call.â€  In his written report, he \r\n  recommended that Mother get custody. During his testimony, he acknowledged that \r\n  he considered not making any recommendation at all, but he concluded that Caitlyn \r\n  would be a little bit happier with Mother and her half-sister Kristen.  When \r\n  asked by the family court about a joint custody arrangement, the GAL stated \r\n  he did not have a problem with that since the parties lived only five blocks \r\n  from each other and Caitlyn was â€œvery bondedâ€ with both parents.\r\n&nbsp;The family court granted Father a divorce \r\n  based on Motherâ€™s adultery. [5]  \r\n  Regarding the custody issue, the family court made numerous, detailed factual \r\n  findings in the divorce decree, including that: both Mother and Father had engaged \r\n  in deceitful and manipulative conduct; Mother shows dependent traits; Father \r\n  demonstrates â€œa consistent need to control and exclude;â€ and both were â€œguilty \r\n  of placing their own interests above the interests of their children.â€\r\n Most significant, the family court found \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  Although the Court finds both parents to be fit insofar \r\n  as each is able to meet the basic needs of Caitlyn, the Court has serious concerns \r\n  about the propensity of both parties to place their own emotional needs above \r\n  the needs of Caitlyn.  If this Court were to give sole custody of Caitlyn \r\n  to either parent, the Court is convinced that the ability of Caitlyn to have \r\n  a normal parent/child relationship with the other parent would be seriously \r\n  compromised.  Therefore, the decision articulated hereinafter is designed \r\n  to insure that Caitlyn has regular contact with both parents.  It is further \r\n  designed to attempt to ameliorate some of the destructive behaviors and attitudes \r\n  in these parents and to teach these parents to share.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  The family court found joint \r\n  custody was in Caitlynâ€™s best interest, and ordered that custody alternate between \r\n  Father and Mother every four weeks. [6] \r\nFather filed a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion \r\n  for reconsideration.  The family court made minor amendments, but denied the \r\n  motion in material part.  Regarding joint custody, the family court noted that \r\n  by statute it had the power to award joint custody.  The family court further \r\n  stated it was â€œconvincedâ€ that joint custody was Caitlynâ€™s only hope for an \r\n  â€œequal relationship with both parents.â€\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was the award of joint custody appropriate under \r\n  the circumstances of this case?  \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is the restraining order in the divorce decree regarding \r\n  overnight guests of the opposite sex overly broad and unreasonable? \r\n  3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is Mother entitled to an award of attorneyâ€™s fees?\r\n\r\nJOINT CUSTODY\r\nFather argues the family court erred in awarding \r\n  joint custody and that he should have been awarded custody of Caitlyn.  In response \r\n  to Fatherâ€™s joint custody argument, Mother maintains that although it is unusual \r\n  for the family court to award joint custody, she believes the arrangement was \r\n  appropriate under the unique circumstances of this case.  She alternatively \r\n  argues, however, that she should be awarded custody of Caitlyn if the joint \r\n  custody decision is reversed.  Because we find exceptional circumstances exist \r\n  in the instant case, we affirm the family courtâ€™s decision awarding joint custody.\r\nWhen reviewing the factual determinations of the \r\n  family court, an appellate court may take its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.  Woodall v. Woodall, 322 S.C. 7, 10, 471 S.E.2d 154, \r\n  157 (1996).  However, where there is disputed evidence, the appellate court \r\n  may adhere to the findings of the family court.  Id.  Because the family \r\n  court is in a superior position to judge the witnessesâ€™ demeanor and veracity, \r\n  its findings should be given broad discretion.  Id.  Furthermore, the \r\n  appellate court â€œshould be reluctant to substitute its own evaluation of the \r\n  evidence on child custody for that of the [family] court.â€  Id.\r\nThe controlling factor in a custody case \r\n  is the best interest of the child.  E.g., Patel v. Patel, 347 \r\n  S.C. 281, 555 S.E.2d 386 (2001).  Moreover, in making custody decisions â€œthe \r\n  totality of the circumstances peculiar to each case constitutes the only \r\n  scale upon which the ultimate decision can be weighed.â€   Parris v. Parris, \r\n  319 S.C. 308, 310, 460 S.E.2d 571, 572 (1995) (emphasis added).\r\n This Court has stated that â€œ[d]ivided \r\n  custody [7]  is usually harmful to and not \r\n  conducive to the best interest and welfare of the children.â€ Mixson v. Mixson, \r\n  253 S.C. 436, 446, 171 S.E.2d 581, 586 (1969).  Therefore, only under â€œexceptional \r\n  circumstancesâ€ should joint custody be ordered.  Id. at 447, 171 S.E.2d \r\n  at 586; see also Courie v. Courie, 288 S.C. 163, 168, 341 \r\n  S.E.2d 646, 649 (Ct. App. 1986) (â€œDivided custody is avoided if at all possible, \r\n  and will be approved only under exceptional circumstances.â€).\r\nIn 1996, the Legislature amended the statute \r\n  governing the family courtâ€™s jurisdiction to specifically grant the family court \r\n  the exclusive jurisdiction â€œ[t]o order joint or divided custody where the court \r\n  finds it is in the best interests of the child.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420 \r\n  (Supp. 2002).  Thus far, the only published decision to comment on this subsection \r\n  is Stanton v. Stanton, 326 S.C. 566, 484 S.E.2d 875 (Ct. App. 1997), \r\n  where the Court of Appeals stated the following:  â€œAlthough joint or divided \r\n  custody is now permitted under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(42) (Supp.1996), visitation \r\n  amounting to divided custody is disfavored by our supreme court.â€  Id. \r\n  at 573, 484 S.E.2d at 878-79.\r\nIt is our opinion section 20-7-420(42) \r\n  did not change the law in this State that, generally, joint custody is disfavored.  \r\n  Mixson, supra.  Nevertheless, our focus remains on the best interest \r\n  of the child.  See Patel, supra; Â§ 20&#8209;7&#8209;420(42).  \r\n  The issue therefore is whether this case presents exceptional circumstances \r\n  such that the best interest of the child requires an award of joint custody.  \r\n  We conclude it does.\r\nThe Mixson Court explained why it disfavored \r\n  a divided custody arrangement:\r\n\r\nThe courts generally endeavor to avoid dividing the custody \r\n  of a child between contending parties, and are particularly reluctant to award \r\n  the custody of a child in brief alternating periods between estranged \r\n  and quarrelsome persons.  Under the facts and circumstances of particular cases, \r\n  it has been held improper to apportion the custody of a child between its parents, \r\n  or between one of its parents and a third party, for ordinarily it is not conducive \r\n  to the best interests and welfare of a child for it to be shifted and shuttled \r\n  back and forth in alternate brief periods between contending parties, \r\n  particularly during the school term.  Furthermore, such an arrangement is likely \r\n  to cause confusion, interfere with the proper training and discipline of the \r\n  child, make the child the basis of many quarrels between its custodians, render \r\n  its life unhappy and discontented, and prevent it from living a normal life.\r\n\r\n253 S.C. at 447, 171 S.E.2d at \r\n  586 (emphasis added, internal quotation marks and citation omitted).\r\nThe family court in \r\n  this case fashioned the joint custody to alternate in four-week intervals.  \r\n  In our opinion, this is not a â€œbriefâ€ period as envisioned by Mixson.  \r\n  See id. (reversing joint custody on daily basis); Stanton, \r\n  supra (reversing a week-to-week visitation arrangement for a special \r\n  needs child).  Clearly, the family court fashioned the joint custody arrangement \r\n  to be the least disruptive for Caitlyn in an effort to combat the dangers generally \r\n  associated with joint custody.\r\nMore significantly, however, we \r\n  concur with the family court that the evidence indicates a serious concern about \r\n  the effects a sole custody arrangement would have on Caitlyn because of the \r\n  potential for the custodial parent to effectively alienate Caitlyn from the \r\n  non-custodial parent. We hold the peculiar facts of this case amount to exceptional \r\n  circumstances warranting joint custody.  See Sanders v. Sanders, \r\n  232 S.C. 625, 103 S.E.2d 281 (1958) (affirming divided custody order).\r\nThe exceptional circumstances \r\n  in this case are reminiscent of those in Sanders. \r\n  [8]   As here, the parties in Sanders were considered fit; both loved \r\n  and wanted their children.  The trial court decided that a divided custody arrangement, \r\n  alternating every six months, was appropriate under the circumstances.  The \r\n  mother appealed, arguing that divided custody would not be â€œas good for the \r\n  children as a permanent home with her would be.â€  This Court commented as follows:\r\n\r\nDivided custody is probably not \r\n  the perfect solution, for problems of this kind are rarely if ever susceptible \r\n  of perfect solution; but in the circumstances of the instant case it seems \r\n  the best one possible from the standpoint of the childrenâ€™s welfareâ€¦.\r\nWe speak from the bench, not the \r\n  pulpit; but we are moved, nevertheless, to say that had the love of these parents \r\n  for their children been less [sic] selfish and more considerate, this unhappy \r\n  proceeding would never have been before us.â€¦ The family structure of these people \r\n  has now been wrecked.  Whether it can ever be wholly restored is not for us \r\n  to say.  But [the trial courtâ€™s] decree sheds a ray of hope upon the future \r\n  relationship between these parents and their children.  Obedience to that decree, \r\n  and patience and charity toward each other and toward them, may yet bring to \r\n  the latter happy and normal development, and to the former a more satisfying \r\n  parenthood than they have heretofore known.\r\n\r\nId. at 633-34, 103 S.E.2d \r\n  at 286 (emphasis added).  \r\nAlthough arguably not a â€œperfect \r\n  solution,â€ the joint custody ordered by the family court in the instant case \r\n  perhaps â€œsheds a ray of hopeâ€ on the future relationship between these parents \r\n  and their daughter Caitlyn.  Id.  We implore Father and Mother to obey \r\n  both the letter and the spirit [9] \r\n   of the decree.\r\nRESTRAINING ORDER ON OVERNIGHT GUESTS\r\nFather takes issue with the following \r\n  provision in the divorce decree:\r\n\r\n  IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, ADJUDGED \r\n  AND DECREED that all parties be, and are hereby, enjoined and restrained from \r\n  having contact with a member of the opposite sex not related by blood or marriage \r\n  in the presence of either child from the hours of 10:00 p.m. until 8:00 a.m.  \r\n  This injunction and restriction applies to any structure or open area where \r\n  the children and the party will sleep in close proximity to each other.\r\n\r\nFather argues that this restriction \r\n  is overly broad and unreasonable.  For example, he contends that if read literally, \r\n  Caitlyn would not be allowed to have any girlfriends sleep over when Father \r\n  has custody of Caitlyn.  We agree.\r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  struck down a similar provision in Jackson v. Jackson, 279 S.C. 618, \r\n  310 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 1983).  In that case, the father was allowed to have \r\n  his son visit only if the child was â€œnot exposed to persons not related to [the \r\n  father] by blood or marriage.â€  The Jackson court explained as follows:\r\n\r\nThis restriction was intended \r\n  to prevent the child from visiting in the presence of [the fatherâ€™s] live-in \r\n  girlfriend.  The restriction is overly broad and unreasonable as there was no \r\n  finding that the presence of [the girlfriend] would adversely affect the welfare \r\n  of the child.  â€¦  Even if this finding had been made, the restriction is overly \r\n  broad in carrying out its intended purpose.  Carried to its logical extreme, \r\n  it would prevent the child from entertaining his own friends at his fatherâ€™s \r\n  home.\r\n\r\nId. at 622, 310 S.E.2d \r\n  at 829 (citation omitted).         \r\nThe restriction in this case likewise \r\n  is overly broad and therefore is reversed.  Id.\r\nATTORNEYâ€™S \r\n  FEES\r\nThe family court concluded that \r\n  neither party was responsible for the otherâ€™s attorneyâ€™s fees.  Mother argues, \r\n  however, that she is entitled to attorneyâ€™s fees because:  (1) she prevailed \r\n  on the custody issue involving Kristen; (2) she obtained joint custody of Caitlyn \r\n  when Father had had temporary custody of her; and (3) she succeeded in her attempts \r\n  to modify visitation while litigation was pending.  We find the family court \r\n  was within its discretion to deny Mother attorneyâ€™s fees and therefore affirm \r\n  on this issue.  See Donahue v. Donahue, 299 S.C. 353, 365, 384 \r\n  S.E.2d 741, 748 (1989) (â€œAn award of attorneysâ€™ fees and costs is a discretionary \r\n  matter not to be overturned absent abuse by the trial court.â€); Cullen v. \r\n  Prescott, 302 S.C. 201, 207, 394 S.E.2d 722, 726 (Ct. App. 1990) (â€œThe award \r\n  of attorney fees is within the sound discretion of the court.â€).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the family courtâ€™s award of joint custody \r\n  and the denial of attorneyâ€™s fees, and reverse the restraining order regarding \r\n  overnight guests.\r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  Kristen was born on January 22, 1985.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  Because Father sought custody of Kristen, Kristenâ€™s biological father \r\n    Greg Martin was named as a defendant.  Martin, however, did not participate \r\n    in the divorce hearing and did not contest Fatherâ€™s claim for custody of Kristen.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  After failing to respond to Motherâ€™s request for summer 1999 visitation, \r\n    Mother moved the family court which awarded Mother several weeks of summer \r\n    visitation.  In November 1999, Mother sought modification of her visitation \r\n    which Father opposed.  The family court increased her visitation to every \r\n    Wednesday night and granted Mother her requested visitation over the Christmas \r\n    holiday.  When summer vacation approached in 2000, the GAL proposed extended \r\n    visitation again for Mother.  Mother made a written proposal to Father, but \r\n    there was no response.  Mother again moved the family court for relief.  The \r\n    family court awarded Mother over six weeksâ€™ consecutive visitation to Mother.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  It was not until the middle of trial that Father abandoned his claim \r\n    for custody of Kristen.  Although Father and Kristen enjoyed a close relationship \r\n    during the partiesâ€™ marriage, the relationship apparently disintegrated almost \r\n    immediately upon the partiesâ€™ separation.  Kristen would not visit with Father, \r\n    nor would she speak on the telephone to him.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Mother did not contest the adultery issue.  She subsequently married \r\n    her paramour.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  In addition, the non-custodial parent during the four-week period \r\n    gets a weekend visitation with Caitlyn.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  This Court has, in the past, used the term â€œdivided custodyâ€ to describe \r\n    what in this case has been termed â€œjoint custody,â€ which is also sometimes \r\n    referred to as â€œjoint physical custody.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n     \r\n    [8]    We note that while Sanders was an annulment action and this \r\n    is a divorce action, the relevant circumstances regarding the custody issue \r\n    are analogous. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]  We share Fatherâ€™s dissatisfaction \r\n    with the family courtâ€™s attempt to teach the parents how â€œto shareâ€ using \r\n    Caitlyn as the teaching tool.  It is regrettable the family court used this \r\n    language in its order.  Cf. Davenport v. Davenport, 265 S.C. \r\n    524, 527, 220 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1975) (â€œCustody of a child is not granted a \r\n    party as a reward or withheld as a punishment.â€).  Nonetheless, we note Father \r\n    has shown he will â€œshareâ€ Caitlyn no more than what a court order allows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25631","title":"Harrison v.

[1]   The jury found in favor of petitioner but \r\n  awarded damages in the amount of only $1.00.  Petitioner appealed, and in an \r\n  unpublished decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed.  Harrison v. Bevilacqua, \r\n  Op. No. 2000-UP-441 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 13, 2000).  We granted the petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, and we now \r\n  affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMcLean is a diagnosed schizophrenic.  He was involuntarily \r\n  committed to Crafts-Farrow State Hospital (run by the Department) in 1982.  \r\n  He remained in the Departmentâ€™s continuous care until his discharge on March \r\n  6, 1995.  While in the hospital, McLean resided in a locked ward.  He had a \r\n  very small room, but it was locked during the day.  McLean had lobby privileges, \r\n  but he declined yard privileges.\r\nOne day while in the hospital lobby, McLean \r\n  saw some representatives from an organization called Protection and Advocacy \r\n  for the Handicapped.  He told them he wanted to be discharged so they became \r\n  involved in his case.  In 1994, after being contacted by Protection and Advocacy, \r\n  petitioner was appointed guardian ad litem for McLean.  In March 1994, all parties \r\n  agreed at a probate court hearing that McLean could be released from the Departmentâ€™s \r\n  care pending a home study.  Eventually, McLean did go home where he has 24-hour, \r\n  one-on-one care.\r\nWhile in the hospital, McLeanâ€™s estate \r\n  paid for his care.  At the time of the probate court hearing in 1994, McLeanâ€™s \r\n  assets, both cash and real estate, were valued at over $1 million. \r\nAt trial, petitioner attempted to prove that the \r\n  Department had been negligent because McLean:  (1) had been confined in the \r\n  hospital too long; (2) should not have resided in a locked ward; and (3) had \r\n  been improperly medicated.  In her complaint, which was filed on June 1, 1995, \r\n  petitioner alleged that the Department should have discharged McLean as early \r\n  as October 1983.  Other allegations included that the Department failed to follow \r\n  its own Level of Care reports which, at various times, recommended McLeanâ€™s \r\n  transfer to an open ward or a community facility or his home.\r\nThere was conflicting expert testimony \r\n  on the allegations of negligence.  Regarding damages, petitioner presented undisputed \r\n  evidence of how much McLean paid the Department for his care. [2]   McLean did not testify, and \r\n  there was no evidence admitted regarding mental anguish or pain and suffering.  \r\n  The jury found in favor of petitioner but only awarded $1.00 in damages.  The \r\n  trial court denied petitionerâ€™s motions for a new trial nisi additur, JNOV, \r\n  or new trial absolute.  On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Should the Court adopt the continuous treatment rule or \r\n  the doctrine of continuing tort to determine that McLeanâ€™s causes of action \r\n  accrued when his treatment ended on March 6, 1995, his discharge date?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n      Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40, the tolling statute for disability?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      3.\r\n       Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming the denial of \r\n  petitionerâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute based upon the $1.00 verdict?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n1.  CONTINUOUS TREATMENT/CONTINUING \r\n  TORT RULE\r\nPetitioner asserts that McLeanâ€™s claims \r\n  are of a continuous character given the continuing treatment he received over \r\n  a 13-year period.  She therefore argues that this Court should adopt the continuous \r\n  treatment rule, or the doctrine of continuing tort, to find McLeanâ€™s causes \r\n  of action accrued at the termination of his treatment by the Department, i.e., \r\n  the date of discharge, March 6, 1995.\r\nPrior to trial, the Department moved for summary \r\n  judgment on the basis of the statute of limitations.  The Department argued \r\n  that petitionerâ€™s allegations began in October 1983 yet the complaint was not \r\n  filed until 1995, and therefore the action was time-barred.  Petitioner contended \r\n  that because this was a â€œcontinuous tort,â€ or pursuant to the â€œcontinuous treatment \r\n  rule,â€ the statute did not begin to run until McLean was discharged.  Alternatively, \r\n  petitioner argued the tolling statute for disability, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-40 \r\n  (Supp. 2001), would allow her to â€œgo back at least five years from the date \r\n  of filingâ€¦in pursuing this claim.â€  The trial court decided Â§ 15-3-40 would \r\n  apply; it therefore ruled petitioner could not present any evidence of negligence \r\n  which occurred more than five years prior to the filing of the complaint.  As \r\n  a result, the only evidence of negligence presented at trial was related to \r\n  events after June 1, 1990.  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s suit for negligence against the Department \r\n  arises under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act; the applicable statute of limitations \r\n  reads as follows in pertinent part:  â€œExcept as provided for in Section 15-3-40, \r\n  any action brought pursuant to this chapter is forever barred unless an action \r\n  is commenced within two years after the date the loss was or should have been \r\n  discoveredâ€¦.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-110 (Supp. 2001).  The statute, however, \r\n  is tolled if the plaintiff is under a disability.  See Â§ 15-3-40.  Section \r\n  15-3-40 provides:\r\n\r\nIf a person entitled to bring \r\n  an action â€¦ under Chapter 78 of this title â€¦ is at the time the cause of action \r\n  accrued either:\r\n  \r\n(1) within the age of eighteen years;  or\r\n(2) insane;\r\n  \r\nthe time of the disability is not a part of the time limited \r\n  for the commencement of the action, except that the period within which the \r\n  action must be brought cannot be extended:\r\n  \r\n(a) more than five years by any such disability, except \r\n  infancy;  nor\r\n(b) in any case longer than one year after the disability \r\n  ceases. \r\n  \r\n\r\nÂ§ 15-3-40 (emphasis \r\n  added).\r\nNeither \r\n  the trial court nor the Court of Appeals stated exactly when petitionerâ€™s claims \r\n  accrued.  Petitioner argues that the proper date is March 6, 1995, when McLeanâ€™s \r\n  treatment by the Department ended.  The Court of Appeals, however, declined \r\n  to adopt the continuous treatment rule, or the continuing tort doctrine, stating \r\n  that the power to adopt them â€œlies within the exclusive domain of our supreme \r\n  court or legislature.â€  Harrison, supra.  The Court of Appeals \r\n  upheld the trial courtâ€™s application of section 15-3-40 and its decision â€œlimiting \r\n  [petitionerâ€™s] claims to the five years preceding the filing of her complaint.â€  \r\n  Id.\r\nIn \r\n  Preer v. Mims, 323 S.C. 516, 476 S.E.2d 472 (1996), this Court recognized \r\n  that the continuous treatment rule had been adopted â€œby a significant number \r\n  of courts around the country.â€  Id. at 519, 476 S.E.2d at 473.  The rule \r\n  can be summarized as follows:  \r\n\r\nThe so-called \r\n  â€œcontinuous treatmentâ€ rule as generally formulated is that if the treatment \r\n  by the doctor is a continuing course and the patientâ€™s illness, injury or condition \r\n  is of such a nature as to impose on the doctor a duty of continuing treatment \r\n  and care, the statute does not commence running until treatment by the doctor \r\n  for the particular disease or condition involved has terminated -- unless during \r\n  treatment the patient learns or should learn of negligence, in which case the \r\n  statute runs from the time of discovery, actual or constructive.\r\n\r\nId. \r\n  (quoting David W. Louisell &amp; Harold Williams, Medical Malpractice, Â§ 13.02[3] \r\n  (1996)); see also Anderson v. Short, 323 S.C. 522, 524-25, \r\n  476 S.E.2d 475, 476-77 (1996).\r\nIn \r\n  both Preer and Anderson, the Court stressed that if the continuous \r\n  treatment rule were adopted as the law in South Carolina, it would contain the \r\n  discovery exception, as outlined above.  Because in both those cases the discovery \r\n  exception would have precluded the plaintiffsâ€™ claims, and thus they would not \r\n  have benefited from the adoption of the continuous treatment rule, the Court \r\n  expressly declined to adopt the rule.  Id.\r\nThe Department argues McLean likewise would not benefit from the rule \r\n  because he should have discovered the alleged negligence.  However, we agree \r\n  with petitioner that it is not reasonable to expect McLean - a diagnosed, institutionalized \r\n  schizophrenic who has been adjudged to be incompetent - to have been able to \r\n  discover negligent psychiatric treatment.  Therefore, we are faced with the \r\n  issue of whether to adopt the continuous treatment rule.\r\nâ€œThere \r\n  are a number of policy considerations behind the â€˜continuous treatmentâ€™ rule;â€ \r\n  [3]  however, most often, application of the rule is justified by reasoning \r\n  that, without such a rule, a plaintiff would be required to bring suit against \r\n  his or her physician before treatment is even terminated.  See, e.g., \r\n  Tullock v. Eck, 845 S.W.2d 517, 519 (Ark. 1993) (noting â€œthe most often \r\n  stated rationaleâ€ for the rule is that â€œthe patient should not be required to \r\n  interrupt the treatment to bring suit against the physician because a statute \r\n  of limitations is about to run.â€); Cooper v. Kaplan, 585 N.E.2d 373, \r\n  374 (N.Y. 1991) (â€œThe premise underlying the doctrine is that a plaintiff should \r\n  not have to interrupt ongoing treatment to bring a lawsuit, because the doctor \r\n  not only is in a position to identify and correct the malpractice, but also \r\n  is best placed to do so.â€).  Yet this justification would be undermined by the \r\n  discovery exception to the rule, which would be part of the rule were we inclined \r\n  to adopt it.  See Preer, supra; Anderson, supra.  \r\n  Surely, a patient could only interrupt treatment if she had (or should have) \r\n  discovered the negligence.\r\nAs for other reasons for the rule, the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \r\n  Circuit has stated that the â€œcontinuous treatment doctrine is based on a patientâ€™s \r\n  right to place trust and confidence in his physician.â€  Otto v. Natâ€™l Inst. \r\n  of Health, 815 F.2d 985, 988 (4th Cir. 1987); accord Haberle \r\n  v. Buchwald, 480 N.W.2d 351, 355 (Minn. Ct. App. 1992) (the rule is based \r\n  on the policy â€œthe patient must repose reliance upon his physician in the completion \r\n  of the course of curative treatment, a relationship of trust which inhibits \r\n  the patientâ€™s ability to discover acts of omission or commission constituting \r\n  malpractice.â€).  Additionally, â€œ[a] â€˜practical reasonâ€™ for this termination \r\n  of treatment rule is that â€˜actionable treatment does not ordinarily consist \r\n  of a single act or, even if it does, it is most difficult to determine the precise \r\n  time of its occurrence.â€™â€  Haberle, 480 N.W.2d at 354-55.  Finally, basic \r\n  tort principles of fairness and deterrence also provide justifications for the \r\n  rule.  See Melanie Fitzgerald, Comment, The Continuous Treatment Rule: \r\n  Ameliorating the Harsh Result of the Statute of Limitations in Medical Malpractice \r\n  Cases, 52 S.C. L. Rev. 955, 966-67 (2001).\r\nThe primary argument against \r\n  adoption of the continuous treatment rule is that it offends the clear policy \r\n  set by the Legislature in its adoption of statutes of limitations and statutes \r\n  of repose.  See id. at 965-66 (primarily discussing statutes of \r\n  limitations).  Indeed, respondents maintain that adoption of the rule would \r\n  be â€œentirely inconsistentâ€ with the six-year statute of repose for medical malpractice \r\n  actions.  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-545 (Supp. 2001).\r\nSection 15-3-545(A) provides \r\n  that:\r\n\r\nIn any actionâ€¦to recover damages \r\n  for injury to the person arising out of any medical, surgical, or dental treatment, \r\n  omission, or operation by any licensed health care providerâ€¦ acting within the \r\n  scope of his profession must be commenced within three years from the date \r\n  of the treatment, omission, or operation giving rise to the cause of action \r\n  or three years from date of discovery or when it reasonably ought to have been \r\n  discovered, not to exceed six years from date of occurrence, or as tolled by \r\n  this section.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).  In Langley \r\n  v. Pierce, 313 S.C. 401, 438 S.E.2d 242 (1993), we discussed this section \r\n  and stated the following:\r\n\r\nSubsection (D) of 15-3-545 \r\n  provides a limited tolling provision, applicable only to minors.  Inclusion \r\n  of the phrase â€œor as tolled by this sectionâ€ in subsection (A) clearly \r\n  indicates that the only tolling of Â§ 15-3-545(A) intended by the legislature \r\n  is that contained in subsection (D).    \r\nMoreover, this Court has \r\n  recognized that the six-year repose provision in Â§ 15-3-545 â€œconstitutes an \r\n  outer limit beyond which a medical malpractice claim is barred, regardless of \r\n  whether it has or should have been discovered.â€  Hoffman v. Powell, 298 \r\n  S.C. 338, 339, 380 S.E.2d 821, 821 (1989).\r\n\r\nId. at 403, 438 S.E.2d \r\n  at 243 (emphasis in original).  We further noted that â€œâ€˜a statute of repose \r\n  is typically an absolute time limit beyond which liability no longer exists \r\n  and is not tolled for any reason because to do so would upset the economic \r\n  balance struck by the legislative body.â€™â€  Id. at 404, 438 S.E.2d at \r\n  243 (emphasis added, citations omitted).\r\nAfter careful consideration, it is our opinion the continuous treatment \r\n  rule should not be judicially adopted.  See id. (statute of repose \r\n  is an absolute time limit not tolled for any reason).  We note the instant case \r\n  implicates not only the general medical malpractice six-year repose statute, \r\n  but also the repose portion of the disability tolling statute, section 15-3-40, \r\n  which provides for an extension of the statute of limitations by five years \r\n  when the plaintiff is insane.  Hence, under the peculiar facts of this case, \r\n  application of the continuous treatment rule would infringe upon two areas which \r\n  the Legislature has spoken on regarding absolute limitations:  (1) medical \r\n  malpractice; and (2) delay of commencement of action due to disability.\r\nPut simply, we find judicial adoption of the continuous treatment rule \r\n  would run afoul of the absolute limitations policy the Legislature has clearly \r\n  set via the statutes discussed above.  See Hecht v. First Nat. Bank \r\n  &amp; Trust Co. 490 P.2d 649, 656 (Kan. 1971) (describing other statesâ€™ \r\n  adoption of the continuous treatment rule as â€œa judicial effort to soften the \r\n  harshness of the statutory accrual ruleâ€ and refusing to judicially legislate \r\n  in this area).  Certainly, this is an area where the Legislature can create \r\n  statutory law if it so chooses. [4]   \r\nCiting Georgia law, petitioner also argues the Court should adopt the \r\n  continuing tort doctrine.  We disagree.\r\nUnder Georgia law, the doctrine of continuing tort:\r\n\r\napplies â€œwhere \r\n  any negligent or tortious act is of a continuing nature and produces injury \r\n  in varying degrees over a period of time.â€ â€¦ Under this theory, the statute \r\n  of limitation does not begin to run â€œuntil such time as the continued tortious \r\n  act producing injury is eliminated.â€\r\n\r\nMears v. \r\n  Gulfstream Aerospace Corp., 484 S.E.2d 659, 664 (Ga. Ct. App. 1997) (citations \r\n  omitted).  However, the Georgia Court of Appeals has stated that the â€œcontinuing \r\n  tortâ€ theory is inapplicable to actions for medical malpractice â€œsince it would \r\n  nullify the intent of the General Assembly that, after five years, no medical \r\n  malpractice action could be brought, even when a disability attaches to toll \r\n  the running of the statute because the statute of repose abolishes any action \r\n  five years after the negligent or wrongful act or omission.â€  Charter Peachford \r\n  Behavioral Health Sys. v. Kohout, 504 S.E.2d 514, 521 (Ga. Ct. App. 1998).  \r\n  Thus, for the same reasons we reject adoption of the continuous treatment rule, \r\n  Georgia has rejected application of its own continuous tort theory to medical \r\n  malpractice claims.  Accordingly, we find petitionerâ€™s argument on the continuing \r\n  tort doctrine unavailing.\r\n2.  \r\n  APPLICATION OF SECTION 15-3-40\r\nPetitioner \r\n  argues that the trial court erred in applying section 15-3-40, the disability \r\n  tolling statute, to bar McLeanâ€™s claims related to events before June 1, 1990.  \r\n  Specifically, petitioner contends that the causes of action did not accrue until \r\n  March 6, 1995, the date of McLeanâ€™s release from the hospital.\r\nBecause \r\n  we decline to adopt the continuous treatment rule, there is no merit to petitionerâ€™s \r\n  argument that the date of accrual is March 6, 1995.  Furthermore, respondents \r\n  correctly point out that it was petitionerâ€™s own â€œalternativeâ€ argument to the \r\n  trial court to apply section 15-3-40.  Therefore, petitioner cannot now complain \r\n  the trial court erred when it took her own suggestion.  Cf. Ex parte \r\n  McMillan, 319 S.C. 331, 461 S.E.2d 43 (1995) (party cannot acquiesce to \r\n  issue at trial and then complain on appeal).  \r\n  [5] \r\n3.  \r\n  NEW TRIAL ABSOLUTE\r\nThe \r\n  jury returned a verdict in petitionerâ€™s favor but awarded only $1.00 damages.  \r\n  Petitioner contends this is grossly inadequate in light of the $129,885.00 McLean \r\n  paid to the Department from June 1, 1990 to December 1, 1994.  Petitioner argues \r\n  that because she presented this uncontested evidence of damages, the trial court \r\n  erred in failing to grant the new trial absolute motion based on inadequate \r\n  damages.  We disagree.\r\nâ€œIf \r\n  the amount of the verdict is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to \r\n  be the result of passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other influence outside \r\n  the evidence, the trial judge must grant a new trial absolute.â€  Oâ€™Neal v. \r\n  Bowles, 314 S.C. 525, 527, 431 S.E.2d 555, 556 (1993) (emphasis in the original).  \r\n  The juryâ€™s determination of damages, however, is entitled to substantial deference.  \r\n  See, e.g., Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, Inc. v. \r\n  Dutton, 311 S.C. 56, 427 S.E.2d 673 (1993).  â€œThe decision to grant a new \r\n  trial is left to the sound discretion of the trial court and ordinarily will \r\n  not be disturbed on appeal.â€  Rush v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 380, 426 \r\n  S.E.2d 802, 805 (1993).\r\nThe \r\n  Court of Appeals decided there was â€œno way to determine the basis for the juryâ€™s \r\n  decision in this case as no special interrogatories were preparedâ€ and three \r\n  different theories of negligence were presented.  Specifically, the Court of \r\n  Appeals stated as follows:   \r\n\r\nIt is conceivable \r\n  that the jury believed the Department properly cared for McLean and released \r\n  him at the appropriate time, but that he should have been placed in an open \r\n  ward.  Under such a verdict, the jury could have reasonably valued McLeanâ€™s \r\n  actual damages at $1.00 because the evidence does not prove that the relative \r\n  freedom of the open ward was of much value to him. \r\n\r\nAlternatively, \r\n  the Court of Appeals noted that because McLean requires constant care, the jury \r\n  could have determined that â€œMcLean received good value forâ€ the $129,885.00 \r\n  he paid the Department.\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis on this issue and find the \r\n  amount of the verdict is not grossly inadequate.  Accordingly, the Court of \r\n  Appeals correctly affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of a new trial absolute.  \r\n  Oâ€™Neal v. Bowles, supra; Pelican Bldg. Ctrs. of Horry-Georgetown, \r\n  Inc. v. Dutton, supra. \r\n  [6] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\n          We \r\n  decline to adopt the continuous treatment rule or the doctrine of continuing \r\n  tort.  For the reasons stated above, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Petitioner sued the individual respondents for \r\n    various causes of action all of which were disposed in their favor on a directed \r\n    verdict motion.  She did not appeal the directed verdict.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  As will be further discussed below, petitioner was restricted in \r\n    the presentation of evidence.  Therefore, the amount of damages presented \r\n    to the jury represented expenses from June 1, 1990, through December 1, 1994.  \r\n    According to petitioner, this amount is $129,885.00.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  David W. Louisell &amp; Harold Williams, Medical Malpractice, Â§ 13.02[3] \r\n    (2002) (footnote omitted).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  For example, Texasâ€™ medical malpractice statute of limitations expressly \r\n    provides the last date of treatment as the triggering date if the treatment \r\n    is the subject of the claim.  See Texas Rev. Civ. Stat. Ann. art. 4590i \r\n    Â§ 10.01. (â€œNotwithstanding any other law, no health care liability claim may \r\n    be commenced unless the action is filed within two years from the occurrence \r\n    of the breach or tort or from the date the medical or health care treatment \r\n    that is the subject of the claim or the hospitalization for which the \r\n    claim is made is completed â€¦ .â€) (emphasis added).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  We note the Court of Appeals addressed this issue and concluded the \r\n    trial court correctly limited petitionerâ€™s claims to five years preceding \r\n    the filing of the complaint.  The Court of Appeals held the express language \r\n    of section 15-3-40 â€œreflects a clear legislative intent to set a five year \r\n    limit for the commencement of tort actions against the state by a plaintiff \r\n    who is laboring under a disability other than infancy.â€  Harrison, \r\n    supra (emphasis added).  We disagree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ interpretation \r\n    of section 15-3-40.  The express language of the statute allows the time for \r\n    commencement of an action to be â€œextendedâ€ by a maximum of five years.  Thus, \r\n    an insane plaintiff would apparently have seven years from discovery to bring \r\n    a negligence action under the Tort Claims Act.  See Â§Â§ 15-78-110, 15-3-40; \r\n    see also Fricks v. Lewis, 26 S.C. 237, 1 S.E. 884 (1886).  \r\n    We note, however, if the action is one for medical malpractice, there is also \r\n    the six-year statute of repose.  See Â§ 15-3-545.  Consequently, it \r\n    is unclear how this statute would interact with the seven years allowed by \r\n    sections 15-78-110 and 15-3-40.  In any event, because these questions have \r\n    not been raised by the parties, they need not be resolved for disposition \r\n    in the instant case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6] We affirm petitionerâ€™s remaining issue pursuant to Rule 220(b)(1), \r\n    SCACR and the following authority:  Otis Elevator, Inc. v.

Faculty \r\n  House of Carolina, Inc., 344 S.C. 194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001) .  \r\n  We affirm in result.\r\nFACTS\r\nOlson is a childhood \r\n  polio victim who, prior to November 6, 1995, was able to walk with the assistance \r\n  of crutches.  On that day, Olson ate lunch at the Faculty House, a dining club \r\n  located on the campus of the University of South Carolina (University). [1]   While Olson was walking toward the ladies room, the tip of \r\n  one her crutches slipped in an unknown liquid substance, causing the crutch \r\n  to skid away from Olsonâ€™s body.  Although she did not fall to the floor, Olson \r\n  suffered a torn rotator cuff and other injuries, and has been confined to a \r\n  wheel chair since the accident. \r\nOlson instituted this \r\n  action against the Faculty House alleging common law negligence, and violation \r\n  of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-210  et seq. (Accessibility Act or Act). [2]   Thereafter, the University was \r\n  added as a defendant.  The trial court granted summary judgment to both Faculty \r\n  House and the University.  With respect to Olsonâ€™s claim against the Faculty \r\n  House, the trial court ruled Olson had not demonstrated any violation of the \r\n  Accessibility Act.  As to the University, the court ruled Olson had failed to \r\n  timely file her complaint within the applicable statute of limitations.  The \r\n  court denied summary judgment on Olsonâ€™s common law negligence claims, and the \r\n  Court of Appeals affirmed.  Olson v. Faculty House of Carolina, Inc., \r\n  344 S.C. 194, 544 S.E.2d 38 (Ct. App. 2001) . \r\n  [3]     \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals err in affirming \r\n  the grant of summary judgment on Olsonâ€™s Accessibility Act claims? \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Should the Court of Appeals have addressed \r\n  the denial of Faculty Houseâ€™s motion for summary judgment as to Olsonâ€™s common \r\n  law claims?  \r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ACCESSIBILITY ACT  \r\nWhether the \r\n  trial court correctly granted summary judgment depends upon whether the Accessibility \r\n  Act creates a higher standard of care in foreign substance slip and fall cases \r\n  to physically disabled individuals than to other business patrons.  Although \r\n  we are sympathetic to Olson, we find nothing in the Act evinces a Legislative \r\n  intent to alter traditional common law principles of foreign substance slip \r\n  and fall liability.\r\nAs noted by the Court \r\n  of Appeals, the General Assembly enacted legislation in 1963 for the construction \r\n  of public buildings in such a manner as to make them accessible to physically \r\n  disabled persons.  Act No. 174, 1963 Acts 189.  Olson, supra. \r\n    Thereafter, the Legislature enacted the Accessibility Act.  The purpose of \r\n  the Act is to â€œenable persons with disabilities to achieve maximum personal \r\n  independence; to use and enjoy . . . public buildings. . . , and to participate \r\n  fully in all aspects of society.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-210 (2001 Supp.) .  \r\n  In furtherance of these goals, the S.C. Board for a Barrier Free Design \r\n  [4]  was created and required to adopt the latest revisions of the American \r\n  National Standards Institute (ANSI) specifications A117.1, with modifications \r\n  as the Board deems appropriate.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 10-5-250 (Supp. 2001) .  Section \r\n  4.5.1 of the ANSI standards, which was adopted by the Board, provides that floors \r\n  &quot;shall be stable, firm, and slip resistant, and shall comply with \r\n  section 4.5.&quot; [5]   (emphasis supplied).\r\nIt is conceded by \r\n  all parties to this case that the floor of the Faculty House was sufficiently \r\n  slip resistant when dry.  Accordingly, the issue is whether, by virtue \r\n  of the Act, Faculty House had a duty, solely with respect to its disabled patrons, \r\n  to ensure that its floor were more slip resistant, in the presence of \r\n  a foreign substance, than required by common law.\r\nIn Wintersteen v. \r\n  Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, 35-36, 542 S.E.2d 728, 730 (2001) , we adhered \r\n  to our common law foreign substance analysis stating, \r\n\r\nalthough there may be a foreseeable \r\n  risk that substances will wind up on the floor, there is no specific act of \r\n  the defendant which causes the substance to arrive there, i.e., it generally \r\n  arrives there through the handling of a third party.  To require shopkeepers \r\n  to anticipate and prevent the acts of third parties is, in effect, to render \r\n  them insurers of their customers' safety.  This is simply not the law of this \r\n  state.  \r\n\r\nOlson asserts that \r\n  section 10-5-260 of the Act establishes a higher duty of care than owed under \r\n  the common law.  We disagree.  \r\n          Section 10-5-260 provides, \r\n  in pertinent part, \r\n\r\nâ€œIt is the responsibility of \r\n  the owner or the occupant of property which contains structural or building \r\n  elements or components required to be in compliance with this article, to \r\n  continuously maintain these elements and components in a condition \r\n  that is safe and usable by persons with disabilities at all times.  (Emphasis \r\n  supplied).\r\n\r\nWe agree with the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ holding that the plain and ordinary meaning of &quot;maintain&quot; \r\n  under Â§ 10-5-260 refers to the safety of the structural elements of the floor, \r\n  not to the presence of a foreign substance on its surface.  To hold otherwise \r\n  would impose a duty upon merchants to continuously inspect and maintain floors \r\n  to ensure their freedom from foreign substances.  Such a duty would be contrary \r\n  to our traditional foreign substance analysis.  We find nothing in the Accessibility \r\n  Act which alters these very basic tenets of South Carolina law.  While we agree \r\n  with Olson that the Act does, indeed, impose some heightened burdens upon merchants \r\n  and business owners to ensure that buildings are accessible and barrier free, \r\n  we simply cannot agree that the Act also requires those merchants to essentially \r\n  ensure the safety of physically disabled patrons in foreign substance situations.  \r\n  Had the Legislature intended such a broad departure from our common law analysis, \r\n  it would have said so.  City of Myrtle Beach v. Juel Corp., 344 S.C. \r\n  43, 543 S.E.2d 538 (2001) (In construing statutes, words must be given their \r\n  plain and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction \r\n  to limit or expand the statute's operation; statutes in derogation of common \r\n  law must be strictly construed and should not be impliedly extended to cases \r\n  not within their scope and purpose).\r\nWe cannot escape the \r\n  conclusion, as reached by the trial court and the Court of Appeals, that there \r\n  is simply nothing in the Act or the ANSI standards which requires, in foreign \r\n  substance cases, a merchantâ€™s floors to have a higher degree of â€œslip-resistanceâ€ \r\n  when wet than when dry, or which imposes upon merchants a duty to continuously \r\n  inspect for foreign substances.  Likewise, we find no indication the Legislature \r\n  intended to abrogate the common law as regards physically disabled foreign substance \r\n  slip and fall victims.  Accordingly, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ holding \r\n  that Faculty House was properly granted summary judgment. \r\n  [6] \r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; MERITS OF FACULTY \r\n  HOUSE APPEAL  \r\nThe Faculty House contends \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in declining to address the merits of its appeal \r\n  of the denial of its motion for summary judgment.  We disagree.  \r\nThe Court of Appeals \r\n  recognized that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not immediately \r\n  appealable.  Ballenger v. Bowen, 313 S.C. 476, 443 S.E.2d 379 (1994) \r\n  .  In Ballenger, supra , we stated,\r\n\r\nThis Court has repeatedly held \r\n  that the denial of summary judgment is not directly appealable.  Willis v. \r\n  Bishop, 276 S.C. 156, 276 S.E.2d 310 (1981) ;  Mitchell v. Mitchell, \r\n  276 S.C. 44, 275 S.E.2d 1 (1981) ; Neal v. Carolina Power and Light, \r\n  274 S.C. 552, 265 S.E.2d 681 (1980) ; United States Fidelity &amp; Guaranty \r\n  Co. v. City of Spartanburg, 267 S.C. 210, 227 S.E.2d 188 (1976) ; Medlin \r\n  v. W.T. Grant, Inc., 262 S.C. 185, 203 S.E.2d 426 (1974) ; Greenwich \r\n  Savings Bank v. Jones, 261 S.C. 515, 201 S.E.2d 244 (1973) ; Geiger v. \r\n  Carolina Pool Equipment Distributors, Inc., 257 S.C. 112, 184 S.E.2d 446 \r\n  (1971) ; see also Gilmore v. Ivey, 290 S.C. 53, 348 S.E.2d 180 \r\n  (Ct.App.1986) ; Associates Financial Services Co. of South Carolina, Inc. \r\n  v. Gordon Auto Sales, 283 S.C. 53, 320 S.E.2d 501 (Ct.App.1984) .  A majority \r\n  of the other jurisdictions have reached this same conclusion.  4 C.J.S. Appeal \r\n  and Error, Â§ 98 (1993); 4 Am.Jur.2d Appeal and Error, Â§ 104 (1962 &amp; \r\n  Supp.1993); 15 A.L.R.3d 899 (1967 &amp; Supp.1993) .  Further, this Court has \r\n  held that the denial of summary judgment is not reviewable even in an appeal \r\n  from final judgment.  Raino v. Goodyear Tire, 309 S.C. 255, 422 S.E.2d \r\n  98 (1992) ; Holloman v. McAllister, 289 S.C. 183, 345 S.E.2d 728 (1986) \r\n  .\r\n\r\n313 S.C. at 476-77 .  Ballenger \r\n  specifically overruled two cases which were inconsistent with this rule, and \r\n  noted that â€œthe denial of summary judgment does not finally determine anything \r\n  about the merits of the case and does not have the effect of striking any defense \r\n  since that defense may be raised again later in the proceedings.  Therefore, \r\n  an order denying a motion for summary judgment is not appealable.â€  313 S.C. \r\n  at 477-78 .  See also Silverman v. Campbell, 326 S.C. 208, 486 \r\n  S.E.2d 1 (1997) (reiterating that denial of summary judgment is not appealable, \r\n  even after final judgment).  The only recent exception to this rule by this \r\n  Court was in a case prior to Ballenger, Davis v. Lunceford, 287 \r\n  S.C. 242, 335 S.E.2d 798 (1985) , in which we allowed the appeal of the denial \r\n  of summary judgment to proceed in the third appeal of a medial malpractice action \r\n  which had been pending for thirteen years. \r\n  [7]   \r\nWe adhere to recent \r\n  precedent and hold that the denial of a motion for summary judgment is not appealable, \r\n  even after final judgment.  To the extent the cases cited by the Court of Appeals \r\n  are inconsistent, they are expressly overruled. \r\n  [8]   Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™ refusal to consider the merits \r\n  of Faculty Houseâ€™s appeal is affirmed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe grant of \r\n  summary judgment on Olsonâ€™s Accessibility Act claims is affirmed.  We find that \r\n  the Legislature did not, in enacting the Accessibility Act, intend to impose \r\n  upon merchants a duty to continuously inspect and maintain floors for foreign \r\n  substances, nor did it intend to create a higher standard of care in foreign \r\n  substance slip and fall cases to physically disabled individuals than to other \r\n  patrons.  For the same reasons, we affirm the grant of summary judgment to the \r\n  University.\r\nWe adhere to Ballenger \r\n  and hold the denial of summary judgment is not appealable, even after final \r\n  judgment.  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly declined to address the \r\n  merits of Faculty Houseâ€™s appeal.\r\n AFFIRMED IN RESULT.  \r\n  \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]   The building was leased to the Faculty House by the University.   \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   This Article is entitled â€œConstruction of Public \r\n    Buildings for Access By Persons with Disabilities.â€\r\n\r\n \r\n    [3]   Olsonâ€™s common law claims remain pending.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]   The Board was abolished in 2000 when the Accessibility Act was re-written.  \r\n    In its place, there is now an Accessibility Committee for the South Carolina \r\n    Building Codes Council.  S.C. Code Â§ 10-5-235 (2001 Supp.) .\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]    Section 4.5 of the ANSI standards provides, â€œSlip resistance is \r\n    based on a frictional force necessary to keep a shoe or crutch tip from slipping \r\n    on a walking surface under the conditions of use likely to be found on the \r\n    surface.  Although it is known that the static coefficient of friction is \r\n    one basis of slip resistance, there is not as yet a generally accepted method \r\n    to evaluate the slip resistance of walking surfaces for all use conditions.â€  \r\n    Under the 1961 ANSI standards, floors were required to have a floor that was \r\n    nonslip.  The 1961 standards were in effect at the time the floor was constructed \r\n    in 1976, but the current version were in effect at the time of the accident.  \r\n    Regardless, both versions require essentially the same thing, i.e., either \r\n    nonslip, or slip resistant floors.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]   To the extent the Court of Appeals addressed other issues in affirming \r\n    the grant of summary judgment to the Faculty House, its opinion is vacated.  \r\n    Moreover, given our holding that the Act creates no higher duty in this situation \r\n    than does the common law, we need not address Olsonâ€™s issues concerning the \r\n    grant of summary judgment to the University, and we affirm the grant of summary \r\n    judgment to it for the reasons stated in Issue 1.  I'On, L.L.C. v. Town \r\n    of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000)  (court can affirm \r\n    for any reason appearing in the record).  The Court of Appealsâ€™ discussion \r\n    of the grant of summary judgment to the University is vacated.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]    Contrary to Faculty Houseâ€™s suggestion, this Courtâ€™s opinion in \r\n    State Farm  Mutual Auto Ins. Co. v. Bookert, 337 S.C. 291, 523 S.E.2d \r\n    181 (1999)  does not amount to a holding that the denial of summary judgment \r\n    is immediately appealable.  In that case, this Court reversed the grant of \r\n    summary judgment to the respondents, in a declaratory judgment action, and \r\n    held that respondents injuries were not covered under the policy as a matter \r\n    of law.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [8]   Tanner v.

Ferrene, Jr., of Ferrene &amp; Associates, PA, of Hilton Head Island, \r\n  and William E. Bird, of Bird Law Firm, PA, of Columbia; for appellants.\r\nCurtis Lee Coltrane, of Coltrane &amp; Alford, PC, of Hilton Head Island, for \r\n  respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  We are asked to determine whether \r\n  the trial court made certain errors in this breach of contract action.  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondents, residential home builders, and appellants entered into a contract \r\n  for the construction of a home in the Rose Hill Plantation development.  No \r\n  fixed time was set for the completion of the contract.\r\nFrom the outset of construction, appellants requested several material \r\n  changes to both the construction method and the house design.  These changes \r\n  resulted in more expenses and affected the timeline of finishing the house, \r\n  especially when some of the changes were requested after work had been completed.  \r\n  Some, but not all, of the changes were reduced to writing in the form of change \r\n  orders.\r\nRespondents also encountered problems when appellants had additional \r\n  contractors appear unannounced on the jobsite to do certain jobs.  In March \r\n  1998, respondents sent a letter to appellants regarding their use of third-party \r\n  contractors and informed them that two of the contractors appellants hired had \r\n  created drainage problems.\r\nThe contract between appellants and respondents called for respondents \r\n  to submit regular requests for progress payments as construction was completed. [1]   Respondents submitted draw requests \r\n  and written change orders to appellants.  Appellants paid the first three draw \r\n  requests and some of the change orders.  The last payment respondents received \r\n  was on November 5, 1997.  Subsequently, two draw requests were submitted to \r\n  appellants, however, the requests were not paid.  Respondents continued working \r\n  for four months after receiving the last payment and continued to pay suppliers \r\n  and subcontractors until they ran out of money. \r\n  [2]   \r\nOn April 9, 1998, appellantsâ€™ attorney sent a letter to respondents \r\n  terminating them from the job immediately.  Appellant Jim Davidson admitted \r\n  on cross-examination that, at the time of termination, there was still work \r\n  to be done under the contract and the change orders.  \r\nPrior to terminating respondents, appellants contacted Randy West, \r\n  a general contractor, to have him determine whether the percentage of completion \r\n  of the house was consistent with the amount of money that had been paid to respondents.  \r\n  West visited the job site and determined the statement of completion was not \r\n  consistent with the amount that had been paid.  However, West recommended that \r\n  respondents be allowed to finish the job.  After respondents were terminated, \r\n  West agreed to complete the job and correct certain items.\r\nRespondents brought an action against appellants.  Appellants counterclaimed \r\n  seeking damages for breach of contract as a result of respondentsâ€™ defective \r\n  and incomplete performance and damages for two other counterclaims.\r\nAppellants alleged respondents built the house approximately two \r\n  feet below the elevation level called for in the plans and failed to put in \r\n  fill dirt to raise the level of the lot where the house would be placed.  Appellants \r\n  alleged the lack of fill dirt caused water to pool in and around the home.\r\nAt the close of the evidence, the court found appellants had breached the contract \r\n  as a matter of law.  Appellantsâ€™ counterclaim for damages alleged to result \r\n  from the failure of respondents to site the house properly on the lot and respondentsâ€™ \r\n  claims for damages and lost profits were submitted to the jury.\r\nThe jury returned a verdict in respondentsâ€™ favor for appellantsâ€™ \r\n  breach of contract.  The jury also, on a separate verdict form, found for appellants \r\n  on their claim regarding the failure of respondents to site the house properly \r\n  on the lot; however, the jury did not award any damages to appellants. \r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by charging the wrong measure of \r\n  damages for prevention of contractual performance?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondents requested the trial court charge the law under Warren v. Shealy, \r\n  83 S.C. 113, 65 S.E. 1 (1909), that appellants cannot recover for the costs \r\n  they incurred to complete the house because they had refused to permit respondents \r\n  to fulfill their performance of the contract.  Appellants objected that the \r\n  proposed charge would allow respondents to recover the full amount left on the \r\n  contract when, due to their termination, they had not incurred certain costs.  \r\n  The trial court charged the jury as requested by respondents:\r\n\r\nAn owner of a building under construction, under a contract providing for payment \r\n  of the price of the completion of work, who refuses to permit the contractor \r\n  to complete the work is liable for the contract price less payments made and \r\n  cannot counterclaim for the amount paid for finishing the building.\r\n\r\n          Appellants contend the expenses respondents did not incur should \r\n  be reduced from the claim for the balance of the contract that was due to be \r\n  paid.  Appellants distinguish Warren v. Shealy because that case involved \r\n  a contract for services only, and not a contract, as here, for services and \r\n  materials.  In Warren, appellants argue, it was appropriate for the non-breaching \r\n  party to recover the full amount due under the contract because those damages \r\n  represented profit or unpaid labor, not material costs that otherwise did not \r\n  occur as a result of performance being prevented. \r\nAppellantsâ€™ assessment of Warren v. Shealy is correct.  However, \r\n  the trial court in this case in fact charged exactly what appellants are arguing \r\n  the court should have charged.  The trial court charged that after partially \r\n  performing a contract, one who is wrongfully prevented from completing the contract \r\n  may recover actual expenditures and damages for lost profits.  The court also \r\n  charged that the measure of damages for the breach of a contract is the loss \r\n  actually suffered as a result of the breach.  Further, the court charged that \r\n  respondentsâ€™ damages consist of out-of-pocket costs actually incurred as a result \r\n  of the contract and the gain above the costs that would have been realized had \r\n  the contract been performed.  Therefore, appellantsâ€™ argument that the trial \r\n  court failed to charge the correct measure of damages is without merit.  See \r\n  South Carolina Fin. Corp. of Anderson v. West Side Fin. Co., 236 S.C. \r\n  109, 113 S.E.2d 329 (1960) (measure of damages for breach of contract is loss \r\n  actually suffered by contractee as result of breach).  \r\nAppellants further assert Warren should not have been charged \r\n  because the issue of appellantsâ€™ counterclaim for the cost to complete the house \r\n  had been removed from the juryâ€™s consideration.  While it may have been unnecessary \r\n  for the trial court to give the Warren charge, reading the charge as \r\n  a whole, it is clear the court informed the jury of the correct measure of damages.  \r\n  The charge adequately covered the law of damages resulting from a breach of \r\n  contract where one party is prevented from completing performance under the \r\n  contract.  We find the jury was not confused or misled by the Warren \r\n  instruction.  See Keaton ex rel. Foster v. Greenville Hosp. System, \r\n  334 S.C. 488, 514 S.E.2d 570 (1999) (jury charge correct if when charge read \r\n  as whole, it contains correct definition and adequately covers law); see \r\n  also State v. Smith, 315 S.C. 547, 446 S.E.2d 411 (1994) (jury instructions \r\n  should be considered as whole, and if as whole they are free from error, any \r\n  isolated portions which may be misleading do not constitute reversible error); \r\n  State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 272 S.E.2d 634 (1980) (jury charge which \r\n  is substantially correct and covers law does not require reversal).    \r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by failing to require jury re-deliberation \r\n  to correct the verdict?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe jury was given two verdict forms.  One form represented respondentsâ€™ action \r\n  against appellants for breach of contract.  This form requested the jury answer \r\n  whether they found for respondents and if they found for respondents, they were \r\n  to determine the amount of damages.  The second verdict form covered appellantsâ€™ \r\n  counterclaim for breach of contract against respondents.  The form asked whether \r\n  the jury found for appellants and if the jury found for appellants, they were \r\n  to â€œstate the total amount of actual damage, if any, sustained by [appellants.]â€\r\n          The jury returned a verdict finding for respondents in the amount \r\n  of $129,000.  On appellantsâ€™ counterclaim, the jury found for appellants but \r\n  did not find any damages.  The trial court sua sponte clarified with \r\n  the jury that their verdict on the counterclaim was a breach by respondents \r\n  but no damages.  At appellantsâ€™ request, the court polled the jury and found \r\n  the verdict stood.\r\n          Appellants argue the jury should have re-deliberated given the jury \r\n  found for appellants on their claim, but nevertheless did not find any damages.  \r\n  They argue the court dismissed the jury without giving appellants an opportunity \r\n  to request re-deliberation.\r\n          This issue is not preserved for our review.  Appellants did not object \r\n  to the verdict at the time it was rendered, failed to request that the verdict \r\n  be resubmitted for clarification, and allowed the jury to be discharged before \r\n  voicing their objection to the verdict.  See Dykema v. Carolina Emergency \r\n  Physicians, P.C., 348 S.C. 549, 560 S.E.2d 894 (2002) (party may not allow \r\n  jury to be discharged in face of obviously defective verdict, which could easily \r\n  be corrected upon resubmission to jury); Stevens v. Allen, 342 S.C. 47, \r\n  536 S.E.2d 663 (2000) (when issue raised, trial judge should resubmit verdict \r\n  assessing liability but awarding zero damages to jury with instructions to either \r\n  find for defense or award some amount of damages); Smith v. Phillips, \r\n  318 S.C. 453, 458 S.E.2d 427 (1995) (no duty imposed on trial judge to question \r\n  juryâ€™s verdict of liability, but no damages, unless requested to by a party); \r\n  Limehouse v. Southern Ry., 216 S.C. 424, 58 S.E.2d 685 (1950) (where \r\n  verdict is objectionable as to form, party who desires to complain should call \r\n  that fact to courtâ€™s attention when verdict is published.  Otherwise, right \r\n  to do so is waived).  Further, appellants did not object to the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  charge on the verdict form or the actual verdict form itself which stated that \r\n  if the jury should find for appellants on their counterclaim, the jury was to \r\n  â€œstate the total amount of actual damage, if any, sustained byâ€ appellants.  \r\n  The â€œif anyâ€ language in the verdict form indicated the jury could find no damages \r\n  even if they found for appellants on their counterclaim.  See Holy \r\n  Loch Distribs., Inc. v. Hitchcock, 340 S.C. 20, 531 S.E.2d 282 (2000) (to \r\n  preserve issue for appellate review, issue must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by trial court).\r\nISSUE III\r\n\r\nDid the trial court err by eliminating from the juryâ€™s consideration \r\n  the issue whether appellants had breached the contract?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe trial court found appellants had breached the contract as a matter of law \r\n  because appellants admitted they terminated respondents from the job without \r\n  giving respondents an opportunity to correct the errors they alleged.\r\nGiven appellants admitted on cross-examination that, at the time \r\n  they terminated respondents, there was still work to be done under the contract, \r\n  the trial court properly found that appellants breached the contract as a matter \r\n  of law because the evidence on this issue was not susceptible of more than one \r\n  reasonable inference.  Cf. Jones v. Ridgely Communications, Inc., \r\n  304 S.C. 452, 405 S.E.2d 402 (1991) (jury issue exists where evidence is susceptible \r\n  of more than one reasonable inference).\r\nAppellants argue the jury was entitled to determine whether appellantsâ€™ \r\n  termination of respondents was justifiable.  However, appellants did not present \r\n  any evidence that the termination was justifiable.  Appellantsâ€™ own advisor, \r\n  Randy West, testified that, although he felt respondentsâ€™ statements of completion \r\n  on their draw requests were not consistent with the amount that had been paid \r\n  by appellants, he advised appellants to allow respondents to finish the job.  \r\n  Further, while West testified that he corrected certain items performed by respondents \r\n  after the contract termination, there was no evidence that respondents were \r\n  given a chance to correct these items prior to termination or that they would \r\n  not have corrected these items on their own accord prior to completing the house.\r\n Accordingly, the trial court properly found appellants had breached \r\n  the contract as a matter of law when they terminated respondents from the job \r\n  prior to completion of the house.\r\nISSUE IV\r\n\r\nDid the trial court abuse its discretion by excluding expert \r\n  testimony?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPrior to trial, in response to interrogatories propounded \r\n  by respondents, appellants stated:  â€œ[Appellants,] at this time, do not plan \r\n  to use any expert witnesses.  If an [sic] when one is identified, his identity \r\n  will be revealed to [respondents.]â€  In response to the interrogatory asking \r\n  what witnesses, other than experts, appellants planned to use, appellants listed \r\n  West.  When this response was supplemented by a second response several months \r\n  later, no expert witnesses were identified.\r\nAt trial, respondents moved to exclude the expert testimony of Randy \r\n  West.  Respondents argued they were not informed West would be used as an expert \r\n  at trial.  Appellants countered that because they had indicated West would be \r\n  a witness and that respondents had deposed West, allowing him to testify as \r\n  an expert would not be a surprise to respondents.\r\nThe trial court ruled West could not testify as an expert due to \r\n  appellantsâ€™ failure to list him as an expert witness.  The court found the failure \r\n  to list West as an expert prevented respondents from possibly hiring their own \r\n  expert.  The court also felt that, given appellants terminated respondents from \r\n  the job before they had completed the job or been given an opportunity to correct \r\n  any alleged defects in the work, Westâ€™s testimony about the quality of the workmanship \r\n  would be irrelevant.  The court stated West could testify as to his observations \r\n  of the property, but not the quality of the workmanship.\r\nBy the terms of Rule 33, SCRCP, â€œinterrogatories shall be deemed \r\n  to continue from the time of service, until the time of trial of the action \r\n  so that information sought, which comes to the knowledge of a party, or his \r\n  representative or attorney, after original answers to interrogatories have been \r\n  submitted, shall be promptly transmitted to the other party.â€  Therefore, there \r\n  is a continuing duty on the part of the party from whom information is sought \r\n  to answer a standard interrogatory, such as the one requesting the party list \r\n  any expert witnesses whom the party proposes to use as a witness at the trial \r\n  of the case.\r\nThe partiesâ€™ disclosure of information before trial is designed to \r\n  avoid surprise and to promote decisions on the merits after a full and fair \r\n  hearing.  Reed v. Clark, 277 S.C. 310, 286 S.E.2d 384 (1982).  When it \r\n  appears a violation of Rule 33 has occurred, it lies within the discretion of \r\n  the trial court to decide what sanction, if any, should be imposed.  Jackson \r\n  v. H&amp;S Oil Co., Inc., 263 S.C. 407, 211 S.E.2d 223 (1975) (case decided \r\n  under former Circuit Court Rule 90).  The sanction of excluding a witness should \r\n  never be lightly invoked.  Kirkland v. Peoples Gas Co., 269 S.C. 431, \r\n  237 S.E.2d 772 (1977).  Before so ruling, the trial court should ascertain the \r\n  type of witness involved, the content of the evidence, the explanation for the \r\n  failure to name the witness in answer to the interrogatory, the importance of \r\n  the witnessâ€™ testimony, and the degree of surprise to the other party.  Laney \r\n  v. Hefley, 262 S.C. 54, 202 S.E.2d 12 (1974).\r\nWe find the trial court justifiably determined appellants should \r\n  be sanctioned for failing to list West as an expert witness in their responses \r\n  to the interrogatories.  The trial court properly considered several factors \r\n  as dictated by Laney v. Hefley, supra.\r\nFirst, the court looked at appellantsâ€™ explanation for their failure \r\n  to name West as an expert.  Appellants informed the court West was not listed \r\n  as an expert because appellants did not think West would have to be qualified \r\n  as an expert to testify to defects in the construction.\r\n Second, the court considered the importance of Westâ€™s testimony.  \r\n  The court indicated Westâ€™s testimony on the quality of workmanship was irrelevant \r\n  given appellants had breached the contract by terminating respondents from the \r\n  job before the work was completed.  The court also noted that the content of \r\n  Westâ€™s proposed testimony had already been presented to the jury through appellant \r\n  Jim Davidsonâ€™s testimony.\r\nFinally, the court considered the degree of surprise to respondents.  \r\n  The court found, by not listing West as an expert witness, respondents were \r\n  prevented from possibly hiring their own expert.\r\nConsidering the factors as outlined in Laney, the trial court \r\n  did not abuse its discretion by excluding Westâ€™s testimony regarding the quality \r\n  of respondentsâ€™ workmanship.  See Hoeffner v. The Citadel, 311 \r\n  S.C. 361, 429 S.E.2d 190 (1993) (trial courtâ€™s ruling on admission of evidence \r\n  will not be disturbed on appeal absent abuse of discretion amounting to error \r\n  of law).\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    contract stated, â€œProgress payments shall be paid immediately to Contractor \r\n    as billed on completed work.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25634\r\nSubmitted February 20, 2003 - Filed \r\n  April 28, 2003\r\n\r\nREVERSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy \r\n  Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen \r\n  Bullard, Jr., and Assistant Attorney General David A. Spencer, of Columbia, \r\n  for petitioner.\r\nAssistant Appellant Defender Aileen P. Clare, of S.C. Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of \r\n  certiorari to review the grant of post-conviction relief (PCR).  We now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\n \r\nRespondent Gantt was convicted and sentenced for first degree criminal sexual \r\n  conduct, kidnapping, armed robbery, grand larceny of a vehicle, possession of \r\n  crack cocaine, and resisting arrest.  These convictions all stemmed from a single \r\n  incident.\r\nThe thirty-one-year-old victim (Victim) testified she was cleaning \r\n  her car at a car wash when respondent approached her from behind, put a gun \r\n  to her back, and demanded her money and jewelry.  After she complied, he threatened \r\n  to kill her if she screamed and told her to get in the car.  They drove to a \r\n  wooded area where respondent raped Victim in the front seat of the car and threw \r\n  the used condom out the car window.  \r\nRespondent then had Victim drive \r\n  to a bank to withdraw money for him.  When Victim asked a teller for help, respondent \r\n  drove off in Victimâ€™s car leaving her at the bank.  Victim took police to the \r\n  scene of the rape where an officer recovered the used condom.  The DNA profile \r\n  recovered from the semen in the condom matched respondentâ€™s.  \r\nRespondent was arrested the same day.  He was in Victimâ€™s car, a \r\n  gun was in the car, [1]  and he had a piece of crack cocaine in his \r\n  pocket.  He fought with the arresting officers.  \r\nAt trial, respondent \r\n  testified that he met Victim at a crack house and she agreed to have sex with \r\n  him in exchange for crack.  They had consensual sex in her car then drove to \r\n  the bank so she could withdraw money to buy more crack.  Victim was acting paranoid \r\n  from the drugs so respondent followed her into the bank.  When she was belligerent \r\n  to him, he left in her car.  \r\nShortly after respondentâ€™s \r\n  arrest, Officer Davis went to the jail with a search warrant to obtain blood, \r\n  saliva, and hair from respondent.  Officer Davis testified that respondent refused \r\n  to cooperate at that time.  The samples were subsequently taken pursuant to \r\n  court order.  Respondent testified he initially refused to cooperate because \r\n  he wanted his lawyer present.  Evidence corroborated that respondent willingly \r\n  gave the requested samples when presented with the proper order. \r\nOn appeal, respondent \r\n  claimed the trial judge erred in allowing evidence of his refusal to cooperate \r\n  because the search warrant was invalid under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (2002).  \r\n  In an unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals declined to address the issue \r\n  because there was no objection to the validity of the search warrant. \r\nRespondent subsequently \r\n  brought this PCR action claiming counsel was ineffective for failing to object \r\n  to the search warrantâ€™s validity. \r\n  [2]   The PCR judge found counsel was ineffective and respondent was prejudiced \r\n  because the State used the evidence of respondentâ€™s non-compliance as evidence \r\n  of his guilt.  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWas respondent prejudiced \r\n  by evidence that he refused to comply with the search warrant?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nA lawful arrest does not in itself \r\n  justify a warrantless search that requires bodily intrusion.  The Fourth Amendment \r\n  protects against intrusions into the human body for the taking of evidence absent \r\n  a warrant unless there are exigent circumstances such as the imminent destruction \r\n  of evidence. [3]   Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757 \r\n  (1966); see also State v. Dupree, 319 S.C. 454, 462 S.E.2d 279 \r\n  (1995) (applying Schmerber analysis to search of suspectâ€™s mouth).  Where \r\n  blood is needed only to determine blood type to match existing evidence as here, \r\n  a warrant must be obtained even though there has been a lawful arrest.  \r\nA warrant allowing a bodily intrusion \r\n  must comply with Â§ 17-13-140 [4]  \r\n  and requires the following:  1) a finding there is a clear indication that material \r\n  evidence of guilt will be found; 2) a finding the method used to secure the \r\n  evidence is safe and reliable; and 3) a balancing of the seriousness of the \r\n  crime, the importance of the evidence, and the unavailability of less obtrusive \r\n  means against the right to be free from bodily intrusion.  State v. Register, \r\n  308 S.C. 534, 419 S.E.2d 771 (1992); In re: Snyder, 308 S.C. 192, 417 \r\n  S.E.2d 572 (1992).  The search warrant in this case did not meet these requirements. \r\n\r\nRespondentâ€™s refusal to comply \r\n  with an invalid search warrant was essentially a refusal to comply with a warrantless \r\n  search.  We have held under Doyle v. Ohio, [5]  the prosecution may not comment \r\n  on the accusedâ€™s refusal to comply with a warrantless search.  Simmons v. \r\n  State, 308 S.C. 481, 419 S.E.2d 225 (1992). [6]  Had trial counsel \r\n  challenged the validity of the search warrant, respondent could have objected \r\n  to evidence that he refused to comply.  Counsel was therefore ineffective in \r\n  failing to challenge the search warrantâ€™s validity.\r\nAn applicant for PCR, however, \r\n  must show prejudice from counselâ€™s deficient performance.  Patrick v. State, \r\n  349 S.C. 203, 562 S.E.2d 609 (2002).  When a Doyle violation has occurred, \r\n  as alleged here, we will consider the following factors in determining prejudice \r\n  on PCR:  1) whether the reference to the accusedâ€™s exercise of his constitutional \r\n  right was a single reference; 2) whether the State tied the exercise of this \r\n  right directly to the accusedâ€™s exculpatory account; 3) whether the accusedâ€™s \r\n  exculpatory account was totally implausible; and 4) whether the evidence of \r\n  guilt was overwhelming.  McFadden v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 539 S.E.2d \r\n  391 (2000).  \r\nAs argued by the solicitor in \r\n  closing, this case turned on credibility.  The evidence that respondent kidnapped \r\n  and raped Victim was not overwhelming in contrast to respondentâ€™s exculpatory \r\n  account of a consensual encounter.  The reference to respondentâ€™s refusal to \r\n  comply with the search warrant, however, was only a single reference and was \r\n  not tied to respondentâ€™s guilt.  The solicitorâ€™s entire colloquy with Officer \r\n  Davis was:\r\n\r\nQ:      What was [respondentâ€™s] response to you in the request for these \r\n  samples?\r\nA:      That he did not want to do it.\r\nQ:      Did he refuse?\r\nA:      Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn argument, the solicitor referred \r\n  once to respondentâ€™s refusal in the context of â€œhe knew his rightsâ€ when police \r\n  arrived with the search warrant, but the solicitor did not argue this refusal \r\n  as evidence of guilt. \r\n We find respondent failed \r\n  to make the requisite showing that there is a reasonable probability the result \r\n  of the trial would have been different but for counselâ€™s error.  Patrick \r\n  v. State, supra.  Because there is no evidence supporting the PCR \r\n  judgeâ€™s finding of prejudice, we reverse.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT, JJ., concur.  PLEICONES, J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion. \r\n JUSTICE \r\n  PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent.  The post-conviction relief (PCR) judge \r\n  granted respondentâ€™s application, finding respondent had proven both that his \r\n  trial counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that respondent was prejudiced \r\n  by this deficient performance.  The majority and I agree that trial counsel \r\n  should have objected both to the evidence of respondentâ€™s refusal to comply \r\n  with the unlawful search warrant, and to the solicitorâ€™s reference to this refusal \r\n  in his closing argument since â€œit is clearly established that the state cannot, \r\n  through evidence or argument, comment on the accusedâ€™s exercise of a constitutional \r\n  right.â€  Simmons v. State, 308 S.C. 481, 484, 419 S.E.2d 225, 226 (1992).  \r\n  Further, since as the majority acknowledges the evidence of respondentâ€™s guilt \r\n  was not overwhelming and the case turned on credibility, I would defer to the \r\n  PCR judgeâ€™s finding that respondent was prejudiced by this deficient performance. \r\n  See, e.g., Burnett v. State, Op. No. 25582 (S. C. Sup. Ct. filed \r\n  January 13, 2003) (this Court is required to affirm the PCR judgeâ€™s findings \r\n  where they are supported by any evidence of probative value).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    gun was a B.B. gun.  The victim testified she knew nothing about guns.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   \r\n    At the hearing, counsel agreed he was ineffective for failing to preserve \r\n    this issue but he believed the outcome of the trial would not have been different.  \r\n    Counselâ€™s admission is unlike the testimony of counsel in Martinez v. State, \r\n    304 S.C. 39, 403 S.E.2d 113 (1991), where trial counsel admitted the testimony \r\n    of a potential witness could have made a difference.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] For \r\n    example, blood alcohol level is considered evidence subject to imminent destruction.  \r\n    Schmerber, 384 U.S. at 770-71.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] This \r\n    section provides generally for the issuance of a search warrant based on probable \r\n    cause.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    426 U.S. 610 (1976).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] This \r\n    holding effectively overruled State v. Middleton, 266 S.C. 251, 222 \r\n    S.E.2d 763 (1976), which held where the search is refused and therefore not \r\n    conducted, there is no fourth or fifth amendment right implicated and testimony \r\n    regarding the refusal is admissible.              \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25635","title":"Campbell v.

On cross-motions for summary judgment, the trial court granted \r\n  summary judgment for respondents and also granted respondentsâ€™ request for class \r\n  certification.  Appellants appeal both decisions.  We reverse.\r\nFACTS \r\n  [1] \r\nIn 1969, the Legislature created appellant \r\n  Hilton Head No. 1 Public Service District (the District) as a special purpose \r\n  district to supply water and sewer services to the northern portion of Hilton \r\n  Head Island.  The District is governed and managed by a commission whose members \r\n  are appointed by the Governor upon the recommendation of the Beaufort \r\n  County legislative delegation.  Prior to this Courtâ€™s decision in Weaver \r\n  v. Recreation Dist., 328 S.C. 83, 492 S.E.2d 79 (1997), the District levied \r\n  taxes on property within the Districtâ€™s service area.  Appellant Beaufort County \r\n  collected the taxes.\r\nIn Weaver, we ruled that the statute which \r\n  authorized the recreation districtâ€™s appointed commission to levy a property \r\n  tax violated the State Constitutionâ€™s provision forbidding taxation by unelected \r\n  officials. [2]   The general holding from Weaver \r\n  is that any legislative delegation of taxing authority to an appointed \r\n  body unconstitutionally permitted â€œtaxation without representation.â€  Id.  \r\n  The Weaver Court, however, ordered only prospective relief, stating the \r\n  following:\r\n\r\nWe are cognizant â€¦ of the disruptive effect todayâ€™s holding \r\n  could have on the financial operation of numerous special purpose districts, \r\n  local commissions and boards throughout this state.  Accordingly, in order to \r\n  give the General Assembly an opportunity to address this problem, we hold this \r\n  decision shall be applied prospectively beginning December 31, 1999.\r\n\r\nId. at 87-88, 492 S.E.2d \r\n  at 82.  In response, the Legislature passed legislation in 1998 that removed \r\n  the taxing power from appointed bodies such as the Districtâ€™s commission.  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-11-271 (Supp. 2002).\r\nThe individual respondents in the instant action \r\n  represent people who own real and/or personal property located in the District, \r\n  paid taxes on the property in the years 1995 through 1998, and did not receive \r\n  water or sewer service from the District. \r\n  [3]   On June 1, 1998, respondents filed their lawsuit.  The case has a \r\n  tortured procedural history; [4]  \r\n  however, respondentsâ€™ only remaining cause of action is a 42 U.S.C. Â§ 1983 claim \r\n  based on an alleged violation of the United States Constitution. \r\n  [5] \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment in favor \r\n  of respondents finding that taxation without representation is a violation of \r\n  the federal Constitution.  Specifically, the trial court found that the privilege \r\n  of no taxation without representation is embodied in Article IV, section 4 of \r\n  the federal constitution, which guarantees a republican form of government.  \r\n  The trial court noted â€œit was taxation without representation that spurred on \r\n  the American Revolution,â€ and therefore could not accept appellantsâ€™ argument \r\n  that the federal constitution did not forbid taxation without representation.  \r\n  In addition, the trial court granted respondentsâ€™ motion for class certification.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       1.&nbsp;\r\n       Did the trial court err in finding that taxation without \r\n  representation violates the Republican Guarantee Clause of the United States \r\n  Constitution?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Did the trial court err in certifying the class?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondents argued to the trial court that â€œtaxation \r\n  without representationâ€ is not permitted under the United States Constitution.  \r\n  Respondents reasonably continue to contend that this founding principle of our \r\n  nation necessarily is embodied in the federal constitution.  Appellants, on \r\n  the other hand, argue the trial court erred in finding the Republican Guarantee \r\n  Clause prohibits taxation without representation.  Moreover, appellants do not \r\n  suggest that our nation has abandoned its founding principles, but rather argue \r\n  that the limited delegation of taxing power that occurred prior to Weaver \r\n  in no way violated a right guaranteed by the federal constitution.  After \r\n  reviewing the relevant authorities, we agree with appellants, and reverse the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nThe Republican Guarantee Clause of the \r\n  federal Constitution provides as follows:  â€œThe United States shall guarantee \r\n  to every state in this Union a republican form of government, and shall protect \r\n  each of them against invasion; and on application of the legislature, or of \r\n  the executive (when the legislature cannot be convened) against domestic violence.â€ \r\n   U.S. Const. art. IV, Â§ 4.  By its express terms, this clause does not guarantee \r\n  against taxation without representation.\r\nFurthermore, â€œ[a]lthough it may surprise innumerable \r\n  generations of American schoolchildren and adults who have studied the American \r\n  [R]evolution and the Boston Tea Party, there is firm Supreme Court precedent \r\n  to support taxation without representation.â€  Samuel B. Johnson, The District \r\n  of Columbia and the Republican Form of Government Guarantee, 37 How. L.J. \r\n  333, 337 (1994); see also Emily M. Calhoun, The First Amendment \r\n  and Distributional Voting Rights Controversies, 52 Tenn. L. Rev. 549, 574 \r\n  (1985) (â€œThe Court â€¦ has refused to transmute the Revolutionary slogan â€˜no taxation \r\n  without representationâ€™ into a constitutional principle.â€).  \r\nIndeed, the United States Supreme Court (USSC) \r\n  has repeatedly rejected the contention that the federal constitution guarantees \r\n  no taxation without representation.  For instance, in Heald v. District of \r\n  Columbia, 259 U.S. 114 (1922) (Brandeis, J.), residents of the District \r\n  of Columbia challenged a property tax which Congress levied, arguing it subjected \r\n  them to taxation without representation.  The USSC clearly stated:  â€œThere is \r\n  no constitutional provision which so limits the power of Congress that taxes \r\n  can be imposed only upon those who have political representation.â€  Id. \r\n  at 124.\r\nLikewise, in Loughborough v. Blake, \r\n  18 U.S. (5 Wheat.) 317 (1820) (Marshall, C.J.), residents of the District of \r\n  Columbia challenged the right of Congress to impose a direct tax on the District.  \r\n  They argued that Congressâ€™ right to legislate on matters related to the District \r\n  â€œmust be limited by that great principle which was asserted in our revolution, \r\n  that representation is inseparable from taxation.â€  Id. at 324.  However, \r\n  Chief Justice Marshall, writing for a unanimous Court, noted that it was â€œobviousâ€ \r\n  the situation was completely different from that complained of during the Revolution, \r\n  and held â€œthat Congress possesses, under the constitution, the power to lay \r\n  and collect direct taxes within the District of Columbia.â€  Id. at 324-25. \r\n  [6]\r\nHeald and Loughborough remain good \r\n  law.  Recently, a three-judge panel of the federal district court rejected a \r\n  claim by residents of the District of Columbia that they had a right to vote \r\n  for Congress.  Adams v. Clinton, 90 F.Supp.2d 35 (D.D.C.), affâ€™d, \r\n  531 U.S. 941 (2000).  As part of the extensive discussion on the plaintiffsâ€™ \r\n  various constitutional claims, the Adams court reviewed Heald \r\n  and Loughborough, as well as other authorities that have rejected â€œthe \r\n  cry of â€˜no taxation without representation.â€™â€  Id. at 55.  Interestingly, \r\n  the court commented as follows on Loughborough: \r\n\r\nIf there were a Justice who would have been particularly sensitive \r\n  to this reprise of the Revolutionary War battle cry of â€œno taxation without \r\n  representation,â€ surely it would have been Marshall-- who served as a company \r\n  commander at Valley Forge.  See Jean Edward Smith, John Marshall: Definer \r\n  Of A Nation 62-65 (1996).  Nonetheless, speaking for a unanimous Court, Marshall \r\n  held that Congress had the power to tax residents of the District of Columbia \r\n  despite their lack of representation.\r\n\r\nId.  The USSC affirmed Adams.\r\nRespondents rely on Kelley v. Metropolitan County \r\n  Bd. of Educ. of Nashville and Davidson County, 836 F.2d 986  (6th \r\n  Cir. 1987), cert. denied, 487 U.S. 1206 (1988), in support of their argument.  \r\n  In Kelley, the court held that the federal district court erred in ruling \r\n  that the state of Tennessee, as opposed to the local school board, should bear \r\n  certain costs of school desegregation.  In dicta, the Kelley court commented \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\nIn language of majestic simplicity, our Constitution provides \r\n  that â€œThe United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican \r\n  Form of Government....â€  U.S. Const. Art. IV, Â§ 4.  A â€œrepublicanâ€ form of government, \r\n  as Madison suggested in Number Ten of the Federalist Papers, is â€œa Government \r\n  in which the scheme of representation takes place.â€  (Emphasis supplied.) \r\n  In few (if any) areas of government is Madisonâ€™s â€œscheme of representationâ€ \r\n  more important than it is in the area of government finance and taxation.  A \r\n  principal cause of our Revolutionary War, after all, was the imposition of taxes \r\n  without representation.  The concept that â€œtaxation without representation is \r\n  tyrannyâ€ was one for which a number of the Framers had put their very lives \r\n  on the line.  Our Constitution was not adopted to perpetuate the evil that led \r\n  us to break our ties with the British Crown.\r\n\r\nId. at 997.  Kelley, however, is inapposite \r\n  to the issue in the instant case.  The Kelley court was concerned with \r\n  a federal judge apportioning state money the court felt was more appropriately \r\n  done by the legislative branch.  Kelley did not resolve the issue of \r\n  whether there is an independent, federal right to no taxation without representation.\r\nAccordingly, while the American Revolution \r\n  may have been spurred on by the rallying cry â€˜no taxation without representation,â€™ \r\n  the federal Constitution that was subsequently drafted contained no express \r\n  provision guaranteeing that as a right.  In contrast, this Court has interpreted \r\n  the South Carolina constitution as clearly prohibiting taxation without representation.  \r\n  See, e.g., Weaver, supra.  Respondents simply cannot \r\n  rest on the Weaver holding for their federal section 1983 claim.  Because \r\n  we find there is no independent, federal right found in the Republican \r\n  Guarantee Clause prohibiting taxation without representation, respondents have \r\n  no available section 1983 action against appellants. \r\n  [7] \r\nWe therefore hold the trial court erred in granting \r\n  summary judgment to respondents; instead, summary judgment should have been \r\n  granted in appellantsâ€™ favor.  Given this conclusion, we need not address the \r\n  issue of whether the trial court erred in certifying a plaintiff class.\r\n REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice John W. Kittredge, \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The facts in this matter are undisputed.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [2]  See S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 5 (â€œNo tax ... shall be established, \r\n    fixed, laid or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of \r\n    the people or their representatives lawfully assembled....â€).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Additionally, respondents include only those who still do not receive \r\n    any water or sewer service from the District.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [4]  For example, the case began with two similar complaints filed in \r\n    state and federal court, each alleging several causes of action.  The state \r\n    court case was removed to federal court, consolidated with the federal case, \r\n    and then eventually remanded to state court.  See Lawyer v. Hilton \r\n    Head Public Serv. Dist. No. 1, 220 F.3d 298 (4th Cir. 2000), \r\n    affâ€™g Campbell v. Hilton Head No. 1 Public Serv. Dist., 114 \r\n    F.Supp.2d 482 (D.S.C. 1999).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [5]  Section 1983 provides:\r\n  \r\n  Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance, regulation, \r\n    custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the District of Columbia, subjects, \r\n    or causes to be subjected, any citizen of the United States or other person \r\n    within the jurisdiction thereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, \r\n    or immunities secured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to \r\n    the party injured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper proceeding \r\n    for redress.\r\n  \r\n  (Emphasis \r\n    added).  Thus, the statute creates a civil rights action for the deprivation \r\n    of a federal right.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [6]  See also Thomas v. Gay, 169 U.S. 264 (1898).  \r\n    In this case, the appellants were non-residents of Oklahoma who objected to \r\n    Oklahomaâ€™s tax on their personal property - herds of cattle that were kept \r\n    and grazed on an Indian reservation in Oklahoma.  The appellants argued the \r\n    tax constituted taxation without representation.  The USSC commented as follows:\r\n  \r\n  Undoubtedly there are general principles, familiar to our systems \r\n    of state and federal government, that the people who pay taxes imposed by \r\n    laws are entitled to have a voice in the election of those who pass the laws, \r\n    and that taxes must be assessed and collected for public purposes, and that \r\n    the duty or obligation to pay taxes by the individual is founded in his participation \r\n    in the benefits arising from their expenditure.  But these principles, \r\n    as practically administered, do not mean that no person, man, woman, or child, \r\n    resident or nonresident, shall be taxed, unless he was represented by some \r\n    one for whom he had actually voted, nor do they mean that no manâ€™s property \r\n    can be taxed unless some benefit to him personally can be pointed out.  \r\n    Thus it has been held that personal allegiance has no necessary connection \r\n    with the right of taxation; an alien may be taxed as well as a citizen.â€¦  \r\n    So, likewise, it is settled law that the property, both real and personal, \r\n    of nonresidents may be lawfully subjected to the tax laws of the state in \r\n    which they are situated.\r\n  \r\n  Id. \r\n    at 276-77 (emphasis added, citation omitted).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]  In addition, we note that claims made pursuant to the Republican \r\n    Guarantee Clause generally have been held by the USSC to be nonjusticiable, \r\n    political questions.  See, e.g., Pacific States Tel. &amp; \r\n    Tel. Co. v. Oregon, 223 U.S. 118 (1912); see also Baker \r\n    v. Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 223-24 (1962) (stating the USSC has â€œconsistently \r\n    held that a challenge to state action based on the Guaranty Clause presents \r\n    no justiciable questionâ€) (and cases cited therein); Adams v. Clinton, \r\n    90 F.Supp.2d at 71; but see New York v. United States, \r\n    505 U.S. 144, 185 (1992) (questioning whether all claims under the Republican \r\n    Guarantee Clause present nonjusticiable, political questions).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25636","title":"In the Matter of John H.

We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent Edisto Island Historical Preservation Society (Buyer) is a nonprofit \r\n  organization that operates a museum located on Edisto Island.  Buyer entered \r\n  into a contract for the purchase of land adjacent to the museum for $27,000.  \r\n  Petitioner John Gregory (John) is the personal representative of the estate \r\n  of Alexander Gregory, the last record owner of the property in question.  John, \r\n  his brother Joseph, [1]  and three other purported heirs of Alexander \r\n  signed the contract as sellers on September 13, 1995. \r\nThe contract in question is a form real estate contract.  It \r\n  identifies Harper Real Estate as the sellersâ€™ agent and acknowledges the realtorâ€™s \r\n  receipt of $500 earnest money from Buyer.  The contract provides a closing date \r\n  of November 30,1995, and states:\r\n\r\nENCUMBRANCES AND RESTRICTIONS.  Seller shall convey marketable \r\n  title to Buyer, in fee simple, free from all liens, except those Buyer has agreed \r\n  to assume.  . . . .If Seller is unable to convey marketable title without \r\n  a court action, or incurring any unusual expense or within 30 days after herein \r\n  specified closing date, Buyer or Seller has the option of terminating this contract \r\n  by giving written notice to the other.  In such case, Seller shall pay Actual \r\n  Cost Incurred.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added). \r\nNo closing occurred on November 30 as provided \r\n  by the contract.  Nearly a year later, John sent the following letter in his \r\n  capacity as personal representative.  The letter is dated October 7, 1996, and \r\n  is addressed to Buyer.  \r\n\r\nMs. McCollum called me, in September of 1995, to indicate \r\n  [Buyerâ€™s] interest in the purchase of the property.  I advised Harper Realty \r\n  of  [Buyerâ€™s] interest in the purchase of the property.  Mrs. Siegling, of Harper \r\n  Realty, followed through and negotiated a Buyer/Seller Agreement.  Mrs. Siegling, \r\n  of Harper Realty, stated that she would obtain a $500.00 earnest money check, \r\n  from [Buyer].  Mrs. Siegling advised me that she would send me a copy of your \r\n  deposit check.\r\nI have tried, on numerous occasions to secure a copy of your \r\n  cancelled earnest money check.  The South Carolina Real Estate Commission contacted \r\n  Harper Realty to get a copy of your cancelled check.  Harper Realty has declined \r\n  to honor my request, for a copy of your earnest money check.\r\nI explained to Harper Realty and to the South Carolina Real \r\n  Estate Commission that without an earnest money deposit, you were in breach \r\n  of contract. . . .\r\nThe recent real estate transaction was done in good faith, \r\n  on my part.  However, I can no longer deny others the right to purchase the \r\n  property.\r\nHarper Realty has not maintained contact, with me, since \r\n  my request for a copy of your earnest money cancelled check.\r\nHarper Realty should have notified you, several months ago, \r\n  of your breach of contract and that you no longer have the right to purchase \r\n  the property.\r\n\r\nOn July 31, 1997, Buyer commenced this action for \r\n  specific performance of the contract and moved for summary judgment.  In response, \r\n  petitioners argued the contract was terminated pursuant to the â€œENCUMBRANCES \r\n  AND RESTRICTIONSâ€ provision which allows termination for failure of marketable \r\n  title.  Petitioners claimed title was not marketable at the time set for closing \r\n  because John mistakenly deeded the property to three people who were later determined \r\n  not to be legitimate heirs of Alexander. [2]   Petitioners relied on Johnâ€™s October 7 letter \r\n  as notice of termination.  The master found the October 7 letter was not sufficient \r\n  notice of termination because it did not relate to marketable title. \r\nISSUE\r\nWas the October 7 letter \r\n  sufficient notice of termination?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nPetitioners contend the master and the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  in finding the October 7 letter insufficient as notice of termination.  They \r\n  argue there is no requirement that the notice of termination state the reason \r\n  the contract is being terminated and that termination is not limited to marketability \r\n  of title.  \r\nFirst, under the contract the right to terminate upon notice \r\n  is clearly limited to marketability of title.  It is included in the â€œENCUMBRANCES \r\n  AND RESTRICTIONSâ€ provision and is specifically prefaced by the phrase â€œif Seller \r\n  is unable to convey marketable title.â€\r\nFurther, notice of termination must be given in accordance \r\n  with the terms of the contract.  Retailers Serv. Bureau v. Smith, 165 \r\n  S.C. 238, 163 S.E. 649 (1932); see also Zullo v. Smith, 427 A.2d \r\n  409 (Conn. 1980) (written notice of termination is sufficient if it specifies \r\n  a reason for termination provided in the contract); Stovall v. Publishers \r\n  Paper Co., 584 P.2d 1375 (Or. 1978) (notice of termination must be clear \r\n  and unambiguous).  Here, Johnâ€™s October 7 letter does not reference marketability \r\n  of title, the only reason for termination upon notice as provided by the contract. \r\n  [3]   The letter is at best ambiguous since it charges Buyer with an alleged \r\n  breach based on petitionersâ€™ difficulties with their own agent, Harper Realty.\r\nMoreover, where the purchaser is aware of an encumbrance \r\n  and is willing to purchase, title is marketable.  Ingram v. Kaseyâ€™s Assocs., \r\n  328 S.C. 399, 493 S.E.2d 856 (Ct. App. 1997); see also Gibbs v. G.K.H., \r\n  Inc., 311 S.C. 103, 427 S.E.2d 701 (Ct. App. 1993) (marketable title is \r\n  that which a reasonable purchaser, well-informed as to the facts and their legal \r\n  significance, is ready and willing to accept).  In view of Buyerâ€™s willingness \r\n  to accept title as is, marketability cannot be asserted as a ground for termination.\r\nWe find the master and the Court of Appeals properly found \r\n  the October 7 letter was not sufficient notice of termination.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Petitioner \r\n    Mary Davis is the heir of Joseph who died after the contract was signed.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n     These three people, in addition to John and Joseph, signed the contract for \r\n    sale.  By decree issued July 2, 1997, the probate court found that only John \r\n    and his brother Joseph were legitimate heirs and quieted title to the property \r\n    in them.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    Counsel agreed at oral argument there is no outstanding dispute regarding \r\n    the $500 earnest money referenced in the October 7 letter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25639","title":"In the Matter of Judge Barry Koon","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25639","description":"This opinion publicly reprimands Newberry Municipal Court Judge Barry S.

Richardson, Jr., and Deborah Stroud McKeown, both of Columbia, for \r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n Barry S. Koon, of Newberry, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   Respondent \r\n  and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, \r\n  SCACR.  Therein, respondent admits he violated the Code of Judicial Conduct, \r\n  Rule 501, SCACR, and agrees to the imposition of a letter of caution with a \r\n  finding of minor misconduct, a confidential admonition or a public reprimand.  \r\n  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand. \r\n  [1] \r\nFacts\r\nThe facts, as stated in the agreement, are as follows.  \r\n  Respondent is a former magistrate for the County of Newberry.  Respondent is \r\n  currently a part-time municipal court judge for the Town of Newberry.  While \r\n  serving as a part-time municipal court judge, respondent participated in a taped \r\n  telephone message, used in placing telephone calls to potential voters, requesting \r\n  voter support for a candidate for Lieutenant Governor.  In the telephone message, \r\n  respondent referred to himself as &quot;a former magistrate for Newberry County.&quot;\r\n&nbsp;Canon 5(A)(1) of the Code of Judicial Conduct provides \r\n  that a judge shall not &quot;publicly endorse or publicly oppose another candidate \r\n  for public office.&quot;  Part-time judges, such as respondent, are exempt from \r\n  the requirements of Canon 5(A)(1).  However, respondent acknowledges that by \r\n  mentioning his former judicial position in the telephone message, it appeared \r\n  he was attempting to use his judicial office to influence voters to vote for \r\n  one candidate over another.

McCullough,\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25640\r\nSubmitted April 15, 2003 - Filed April \r\n  28, 2003\r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Deborah Stroud McKeown, both of Columbia, for \r\n  the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDeborah D. McCullough, of Fort Mill, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial \r\n  disciplinary action, respondent and Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an \r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, Rules for Judicial \r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR.  Therein, respondent admits she violated \r\n  the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR, and agrees to the imposition \r\n  of a confidential admonition, a public reprimand or a definite suspension not \r\n  to exceed six months.  We accept the agreement and suspend respondent for six \r\n  months. [1] \r\nFacts\r\nThe facts, as stated in the Agreement, are as follows.  \r\n  Respondent accepted $1,826 in bond money from a defendant.  Instead of depositing \r\n  the funds into her bond account and transmitting them to Magistrate Edward H. \r\n  Harvey, the trial judge, respondent maintains she placed them in her briefcase \r\n  for safekeeping.  When respondent went to deposit the funds into her bond account, \r\n  she could not locate them in her briefcase.  However, respondent failed to report \r\n  the missing funds to South Carolina Court Administration or to the Office of \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel as required by order of the Chief Justice of this Court \r\n  dated November 9, 1999.\r\nSome seven months later, York County Chief Magistrate Brenda \r\n  Ervin contacted respondent and asked that respondent produce her bond account \r\n  records the following day because the County was conducting an audit of respondent's \r\n  bond account.  The same day, respondent telephoned Judge Harvey and advised \r\n  him she had located the envelope containing the bond money in her briefcase.  \r\n  Respondent forwarded to Judge Harvey a check in the amount of $1,826.  Respondent \r\n  maintains she located the bond money while gathering her financial records for \r\n  the audit and while cleaning out her briefcase before an upcoming conference.\r\nA review by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel of the records \r\n  of respondent's bond account revealed that on more than one occasion checks \r\n  written from respondent's bond account were returned for insufficient funds.  \r\n  Respondent failed to report the dishonored checks to South Carolina Court Administration \r\n  and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nLaw\r\nBy her conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold \r\n  the integrity and independence of the judiciary); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid \r\n  impropriety and the appearance of impropriety in all of the judge's activities); \r\n  Canon 2(A)(a judge shall respect and comply with the law and shall act at all \r\n  times in a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 3(a judge shall perform the duties of judicial office \r\n  impartially and diligently); Canon 3(B)(2)(a judge shall be faithful to the \r\n  law and maintain professional competence in it); Canon 3(B)(8)(a judge shall \r\n  dispose of all judicial matters promptly, efficiently and fairly); and Canon \r\n  3(C)(1)(a judge shall diligently discharge the judge's administrative responsibilities \r\n  without bias or prejudice and maintain professional competence in judicial administration, \r\n  and should cooperate with other judges and court officials in the administration \r\n  of court business).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a six month \r\n  suspension.  Respondent is therefore suspended for six months.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent has been disciplined previously for \r\n    unrelated misconduct.  On October 21, 2002, she received a confidential admonition \r\n    from the Commission on Judicial Conduct for actions which gave the appearance \r\n    that she was attempting to use her judicial position to convince an attorney \r\n    to handle a defendant's case and to influence Judge Ervin's handling of the \r\n    defendant's case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25641","title":"Whetstone v.

Wayne Floyd, of West Columbia, and Melissa Jane Reed Kimbrough, of Columbia, \r\n  for Respondent Thomas Ivey.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Charles W. Whetstone, Jr., (â€œWhetstoneâ€), \r\n  a former circuit court judge, brings this action in our original jurisdiction \r\n  through a common law writ of certiorari to quash a subpoena requiring him to \r\n  testify in a Post Conviction Relief (â€œPCRâ€) hearing for Thomas Ivey (â€œIveyâ€).  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIvey filed a PCR petition alleging, inter alia, his \r\n  trial counsel, Michael Culler (â€œCullerâ€), provided ineffective assistance of \r\n  counsel.  Ivey alleges Culler had a conflict of interest because of his friendship \r\n  with Officer Thomas Harrison (â€œOfficer Harrisonâ€), a man for whose murder Ivey \r\n  was convicted in an earlier trial. \r\n  [1] \r\nButtressing Iveyâ€™s claim is a letter signed by Culler stating \r\n  he could not represent Patricia Perkins (â€œPerkinsâ€), an individual tangentially \r\n  involved in the murder of Officer Harrison, because he was a friend of the slain \r\n  officer.  Culler does not deny signing the letter, but stated he was not aware \r\n  why he did so because he only casually knew Officer Harrison, and would not \r\n  consider him a close friend.\r\nThe PCR judge denied Whetstoneâ€™s Motion to Quash \r\n  the Subpoena.  The PCR judgeâ€™s order allowed Ivey to question Whetstone on two \r\n  grounds:  1) whether he ever had a conversation with Culler discussing his association \r\n  with Officer Harrison; and 2) whether he ever saw the Perkinsâ€™ letter in which \r\n  Culler asked to be relieved as counsel in the related case.  The order specifically \r\n  precluded Iveyâ€™s asking Whetstone what he might have done had he known of a \r\n  potential conflict of interest.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the PCR court err in allowing the questioning of a former \r\n  circuit court judge who presided over the applicantâ€™s trial?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIt is not disputed that a judge may testify on matters \r\n  not touching upon his official duties.  At issue is the extent to which a judge \r\n  may be required to testify about a case over which he previously presided.\r\nThe South Carolina Code of Judicial Conduct provides \r\n  little guidance by confining its directives only against judges serving as character \r\n  witnesses.  See Rule 501, Canon 2(B) cmt., SCACR.  Our search of relevant \r\n  South Carolina case law has produced only State v. Talbert, 41 S.C. 526, \r\n  19 S.E. 852 (1894).  \r\nIn Talbert, the defense sought a judgeâ€™s \r\n  testimony concerning an arrest warrant issued against the defendant.  The Stateâ€™s \r\n  objection was sustained at trial.  \r\nThe issue on appeal was whether the trial court \r\n  should allow a judge to testify as a witness concerning actions taken in his \r\n  official capacity.  This Court affirmed, reasoning the defendantâ€™s position \r\n  was â€œclearly untenableâ€ because the warrant itself was the best evidence of \r\n  the fact sought to be proved, not the testimony of the judge.  The Court further \r\n  found the judgeâ€™s testimony irrelevant. [2] \r\nThis reasoning is echoed by the modern trend of \r\n  courts not allowing a judge to testify regarding a case in which he previously \r\n  presided unless the testimony is: 1) critical; and 2) can be obtained by no \r\n  other means.  See United States v. Dowdy, 440 F. Supp. 894 (W.D. \r\n  Va. 1977); Commonwealth v. Ellis, 10 Mass. L. Rptr. 333 (Mass. 1999) \r\n  available at 1999 WL 855196; State ex rel. Carroll v. Junker, \r\n  79 Wash.2d 12, 482 P.2d 775 (Wash. 1971); Helmbrecht v. St. Paul Ins. Co., \r\n  117 Wis.2d 74, 343 N.W.2d 132 (Wis. Ct. App. 1983); see generally \r\n  Michael D. Wade, â€œThe Judge as a Witness,â€ Mich. B.J. 906 (1995) (providing \r\n  six reasons why courts traditionally do not allow a judge to testify regarding \r\n  a case in which he previously presided).\r\nIvey contends Whetstoneâ€™s testimony is \r\n  critical in determining whether Culler provided ineffective assistance of counsel \r\n  due to a conflict of interest.  The PCR court agreed and found the judgeâ€™s testimony \r\n  â€œrelevant as to the limited issues of whether [Whetstone] had been informed \r\n  about any association of Mr. Culler with Officer Harrison by means of communication \r\n  from Mr. Culler, by being shown [the Perkinsâ€™ letter asking to be relieved], \r\n  by Mr. Whetstoneâ€™s seeing anything regarding such matters in the clerkâ€™s file, \r\n  or from other sources.â€  \r\nIveyâ€™s argument and the PCR courtâ€™s order, however, fail \r\n  to\r\naddress why Whetstoneâ€™s testimony is critical to assist the \r\n  court in determining whether Culler provided ineffective assistance of counsel.  \r\n  Ivey asserts Whetstoneâ€™s knowledge of a possible conflict of interest is relevant \r\n  because, under Holloway v. Arkansas, 435 U.S. 475, 98 S.Ct. 1173, 55 \r\n  L.Ed.2d 426 (1978), Ivey â€œmust prove that the judge had an affirmative duty \r\n  to inquire into the conflict disclosed by Mr. Culler in his signed letter filed \r\n  with the Clark [sic] of Court in the Patricia Perkins file.â€  Ivey concludes \r\n  â€œif Mr. Whetstone had personal knowledge of the letter, then he should have \r\n  made inquiry under Holloway v. Arkansas.â€  We disagree. \r\nHolloway is inapplicable to the facts of this \r\n  case.  Holloway focused on the responsibility of a trial court to resolve \r\n  a potential conflict of interest of an attorney representing multiple co-defendants.  \r\n  Holloway does not stand for a per se rule that a trial court must sua \r\n  sponte inquire into whether trial counsel has a conflict of interest as \r\n  Ivey seems to suggests.  See also Cuyler v. Sullivan, 446 \r\n  U.S. 335, 100 S.Ct. 1708, 64 L.Ed.2d 333 (1980) (a trial court must inquire \r\n  into potential conflicts of interest in multiple representation situations \r\n  where â€œthe trial court knows or reasonably \r\n  should know that a particular conflict exists.â€ 446 U.S. at 347).\r\nFurther, Iveyâ€™s claim of ineffective assistance of \r\n  counsel is founded upon the actions, or more properly the inaction, of Culler.  \r\n  Ivey argues Cullerâ€™s failure to recuse himself from the case or his failure \r\n  to notify Ivey of any potential conflict establishes an ineffective assistance \r\n  claim.  Iveyâ€™s claim, therefore, rests on allegations of improper actions by \r\n  defense counsel not on the actions or failures of the trial judge. \r\nThere is no critical, relevant reason to require \r\n  Whetstoneâ€™s testimony regarding whether he discussed possible conflicts of interests \r\n  with Culler or whether he became aware of possible conflicts of interests by \r\n  reviewing the Perkinsâ€™ letter. Culler does not deny he wrote the letter regarding \r\n  the Perkinsâ€™ case or was subsequently excused from representing her.  Culler \r\n  does not deny that he did not inform Ivey of the letter.  Culler now, however, \r\n  denies that he had any type of relationship with Officer Harrison other than \r\n  a passing acquaintance.\r\nNo relevant need for Whetstoneâ€™s \r\n  testimony overcomes the presumption judges should not be called to testify regarding \r\n  matters from a case over which they previously presided.  Further, Whetstone \r\n  need not be called to testify about the existence of a conversation with Culler, \r\n  when an alternate means of obtaining such information may be found in the testimony \r\n  of Culler himself.  The trial record and PCR testimony of the witnesses provide \r\n  ample resources from which Iveyâ€™s claims may be reviewed.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the above cited reasons, we quash the subpoena.\r\n MOORE, A.C.J., WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  TOAL, \r\n  C.J., not participating.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]   The facts of the underlying criminal cases involved \r\n    Ivey and an accomplice who escaped from an Alabama prison in January 1993.  \r\n    The two traveled to Columbia, South Carolina, where they kidnapped and eventually \r\n    murdered Robert Montgomery (â€œMontgomeryâ€).  Later the two, joined by Patricia \r\n    Perkins, purchased goods using forged checks in the name of Montgomery.  Suspicious \r\n    of the trio, a store employee contacted the police.  \r\n  The police stopped the three in a mall parking lot \r\n    to question them about the checks.  As Officer Harrison questioned Ivey, Iveyâ€™s \r\n    pistol discharged.   The ricocheted bullet struck Officer Harrison.  Ivey \r\n    proceeded to shoot Officer Harrison five more times.\r\n  Ivey was convicted for the murder of Officer Harrison.  \r\n    He was sentenced to death.  See State v. Ivey, 325 S.C. 137, \r\n    481 S.E.2d 125 (1997) (Ivey I).  Ivey was also convicted of the murder, \r\n    kidnapping, and armed robbery of Montgomery in a trial conducted by Judge \r\n    Whetstone.  See State v. Ivey, 331 S.C. 118, 502 S.E.2d 92 (1998) \r\n    (Ivey II).  Culler represented Ivey in Ivey II only.  Ivey was \r\n    again sentenced to death in Ivey II. The Officer Harrison murder conviction \r\n    was an aggravating circumstance in the sentencing phase of Ivey II.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n       The defense asserted, if called to testify, the judge would testify he \r\n    signed a warrant for the arrest of another individual, not Talbert.  The defenseâ€™s \r\n    theory was the other individual committed the crime, and the judgeâ€™s opinion \r\n    the other individual was the guilty party would support Talbertâ€™s claim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25642","title":"McQueen v.

Rhode Island, 533 U.S. 606 (2001).  \r\n\r\nFACTS AND PROCEDURE\r\nIn the early 1960â€™s, respondent McQueen purchased two non-contiguous lots located \r\n  on manmade saltwater canals in the Cherry Grove section of North Myrtle Beach.  \r\n  He paid $2,500 in 1961 for a lot on 53rd Avenue and $1,700 in 1963 \r\n  for a lot on 48th Avenue.  Since then, both lots have remained unimproved.  \r\n  The lots surrounding McQueenâ€™s are improved and have bulkheads or retaining \r\n  walls.\r\nIn 1991, McQueen filed applications with petitioner \r\n  Office of Ocean and Coastal Resource Management (OCRM) [2]  to build bulkheads on his lots.  After an administrative delay, \r\n  he reapplied in 1993 requesting permits to backfill his lots and build bulkheads.  \r\n  In January 1994, a hearing was held at which the following facts were put into \r\n  evidence.\r\nAt the time of the hearing, the majority of both \r\n  lots had reverted to tidelands or critical area saltwater wetlands.  This reversion \r\n  was caused by â€œcontinuousâ€ erosion, although little change had occurred since \r\n  the permits were originally sought in 1991.  The 53rd Avenue lot \r\n  is inundated regularly by tidal flow all the way up to the street.  The 48th \r\n  Avenue lot has less tidal flow but contains more critical area wetland vegetation.  \r\n  On both lots, only some irregular portions of high ground remain.\r\nThe proposed backfill would permanently destroy the \r\n  critical area environment on these lots.  Without the backfill and bulkheads, \r\n  the property does not have enough high ground to be developed.  Eventually tidal \r\n  water will reach the roads bordering these lots which will require bulkheads \r\n  to protect the public roads.  \r\nIn October 1994, a final decision \r\n  [3]  was issued denying both permits based on OCRMâ€™s evaluation of McQueenâ€™s \r\n  lots as predominantly critical area wetlands. [4]   McQueen then commenced this \r\n  action seeking compensation for a regulatory taking.  The master-in-equity found \r\n  the denial of the permits deprived McQueen of all economically beneficial use \r\n  of the lots and awarded him $50,000 per lot as just compensation.\r\nOCRM appealed.  By a divided court, the Court of Appeals affirmed \r\n  the finding of a taking because McQueen was deprived of all economically beneficial \r\n  use of his property.  The majority held:  â€œThe definitive issue is what rights \r\n  McQueen possessed when he purchased the lots and . . . the right to add a bulkhead \r\n  and fill were McQueenâ€™s at the time of purchase.â€  McQueen v. South Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council, 329 S.C. 588, 595, 496 S.E.2d 643, 647 (Ct. App. 1998).  \r\n  The Court of Appeals found the evidence insufficient, however, to support the \r\n  amount of compensation awarded by the master and the case was remanded.   OCRM \r\n  then sought a writ of certiorari in this Court which was granted.\r\nOn review of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision, we reversed.  We found \r\n  it was uncontested that McQueen was deprived of all economically beneficial \r\n  use of his property but found he had no reasonable investment-backed expectations \r\n  because of pre-existing wetlands regulations, therefore no taking had occurred.  \r\n  McQueen v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 340 S.C. 65, 530 S.E.2d 628 \r\n  (2000).  The United States Supreme Court then granted McQueenâ€™s petition for \r\n  a writ of certiorari, summarily vacated our opinion, and remanded for further \r\n  consideration in light of the recent Palazzolo decision.\r\nPalazzolo involved a partial taking of property including wetlands.  \r\n  The Rhode Island Supreme Court found the landowner had not been deprived of \r\n  all economically beneficial use of his property and, even if he had, the right \r\n  to fill wetlands was not part of his ownership estate because regulations prohibiting \r\n  such activity were enacted before he acquired title.  Palazzolo v. State, \r\n  746 A.2d 707 (2000).  On writ of certiorari, the United States Supreme Court \r\n  reversed holding that pre-existing regulation was not dispositive in itself, \r\n  either in the context of determining ownership rights under background principles \r\n  of state law or in determining the investment-backed expectation factor in a \r\n  partial taking.  Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 626 &amp; 629-30.\r\nISSUE\r\nDo background principles of South Carolina property \r\n  law absolve the State from compensating McQueen? \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nFirst, we accept as uncontested that McQueenâ€™s lots retain no value and therefore \r\n  a total taking has occurred. [5]   \r\n  When there has been a total deprivation of all economically beneficial use, \r\n  the threshold issue in determining whether compensation is due is whether the \r\n  landholderâ€™s rights of ownership are â€œconfined by limitations on the use of \r\n  land which â€˜inhere in the title itself.â€™â€  Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 629 \r\n  (quoting Lucas, 505 U.S. at 1029); see also Rickâ€™s Amusement, \r\n  Inc. v. State, 351 S.C. 352, 570 S.E.2d 155 (2001) cert. denied 122 \r\n  S.Ct. 1909 (2002) (threshold inquiry in regulatory taking is whether the property \r\n  interest affected is inherent in the plaintiffâ€™s ownership rights).  Background \r\n  principles of State property and nuisance law inform this inquiry.  Palazzolo, \r\n  533 U.S. at 629.  Where the proscribed use is not part of the ownerâ€™s title \r\n  to begin with, no compensatory taking has occurred.  Lucas, 505 U.S. \r\n  at 1027.  \r\nPublic Trust Doctrine\r\nAs a coastal state, South Carolina has a long line of cases regarding the public \r\n  trust doctrine in the context of land bordering navigable waters.  Historically, \r\n  the State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.  As stated \r\n  by this Court in 1884, not only does the State hold title to this land in jus \r\n  privatum, it holds it in jus publicum, in trust for the benefit of \r\n  all the citizens of this State.  State v. Pacific Guano Co., 22 S.C. \r\n  50, 84 (1884); see also State v. Hardee, 259 S.C. 535, 193 S.E.2d \r\n  497 (1972); Rice Hope Plantation v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Auth., \r\n  216 S.C. 500, 59 S.E.2d 132 (1950), overruled on other grounds, McCall \r\n  v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985). [6]   \r\nThe State has the exclusive right to control land below the high water mark \r\n  for the public benefit, Port Royal Mining Co. v. Hagood, 30 S.C. 519, \r\n  9 S.E. 686 (1889), and cannot permit activity that substantially impairs the \r\n  public interest in marine life, water quality, or public access.  Sierra \r\n  Club v. Kiawah Resort Assocs., 318 S.C. 119, 456 S.E.2d 397 (1995); see \r\n  also Heyward v. Farmersâ€™ Min. Co., 42 S.C. 138, 19 S.E. 963 (1884) \r\n  (public trust land cannot be placed entirely beyond direction and control of \r\n  the State); Cape Romain Land &amp; Improvement Co. v. Georgia-Carolina Canning \r\n  Co., 148 S.C. 428, 146 S.E. 434 (1928) (protected public purposes of trust \r\n  include navigation and fishery).  The Stateâ€™s presumptive title applies to tidelands.  \r\n  State v. Yelsen Land Co., 265 S.C. 78, 216 S.E.2d 876 (1975).  \r\nSignificantly, under South Carolina law, wetlands created by the encroachment \r\n  of navigable tidal water belong to the State.  Coburg Dairy, Inc. v. Lesser, \r\n  318 S.C. 510, 458 S.E.2d 547 (1995).  Proof that land was highland at the time \r\n  of grant and tidelands were subsequently created by the rising of tidal water \r\n  cannot defeat the Stateâ€™s presumptive title to tidelands.  State v. Fain, \r\n  273 S.C. 748, 259 S.E.2d 606 (1979).\r\nAs described above, each of McQueenâ€™s lots borders a man-made tidal canal. [7]   At the time the permits were denied, \r\n  [8]  the lots had reverted to tidelands with only irregular portions of \r\n  highland remaining.  This reversion to tidelands effected a restriction on McQueenâ€™s \r\n  property rights inherent in the ownership of property bordering tidal water.  \r\n\r\nThe tidelands included on McQueenâ€™s lots are public trust property subject \r\n  to control of the State.  McQueenâ€™s ownership rights do not include the right \r\n  to backfill or place bulkheads on public trust land and the State need not compensate \r\n  him for the denial of permits to do what he cannot otherwise do.  Accord  \r\n  Esplanade Props., Inc. v. City of Seattle, 307 F.3d 978 (9th \r\n  Cir. 2002) (finding no taking where state public trust doctrine precludes dredging \r\n  and filling tidelands).  Any taking McQueen suffered is not a taking effected \r\n  by State regulation but by the forces of nature and McQueenâ€™s own lack of vigilance \r\n  in protecting his property.  \r\nWe find no compensation is due.  After reconsideration in light of Palazzolo, \r\n  we reach the same conclusion we originally reached in this case and reverse \r\n  the Court of Appeals.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] McQueen \r\n    v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 340 S.C. 65, 530 S.E.2d 628 (2000). \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Formerly \r\n    South Carolina Coastal Council. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] The \r\n    Coastal Zone Management Appellate Panel upheld denial of the permits. \r\n\r\n \r\n    [4]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-39-130(C) (Supp. 2002) provides \r\n    that â€œno person shall fill, remove, dredge, drain or erect any structure on \r\n    or in any way alter any critical area without first obtaining a permit from \r\n    the department.â€  Under Â§ 48-39-10(J), â€œcritical areaâ€ includes tidelands.  \r\n    â€œTidelandsâ€ means â€œall areas which are at or below mean high tide and coastal \r\n    wetlands, mudflats, and similar areas that are contiguous or adjacent to coastal \r\n    waters and are an integral part of the estuarine systems involved.â€  Â§ 48-39-10.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]  \r\n    Our analysis differs depending on whether a taking is characterized as partial \r\n    or total.  When there has been a partial taking by government regulation, \r\n    the court determines if compensation is due by applying a complex of factors \r\n    referred to as the Penn Central factors:  the regulationâ€™s economic \r\n    effect on the landowner, the extent to which the regulation interferes with \r\n    reasonable investment-backed expectations, and the character of the government \r\n    action.  Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 617.  Where regulation compels the \r\n    property owner to suffer a physical occupation or deprives the owner of all \r\n    economically beneficial use of his property, however, with â€œcertain qualifications,â€ \r\n    compensation is due.  Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 617; see also Sea \r\n    Cabins on Ocean IV Homeownersâ€™ Assoc., Inc. v. City of North Myrtle Beach, \r\n    345 S.C. 418, 548 S.E.2d 595 (2001).  In these two instances, the owner must \r\n    be compensated â€œwithout case-specific inquiry into the public interest advanced \r\n    in support of the restraint,â€ a factor in the Penn Central complex.  \r\n    Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, 505 U.S. 1003, 1015 (1992).  \r\n  \r\n  Lucas left much confusion, however, about whether \r\n    another Penn Central factor, â€œinvestment-backed expectations,â€ survived \r\n    in the context of a total deprivation case.  Compare Good v. United \r\n    States, 189 F.3d 1355 (Fed. Cir. 1999) (this factor applies even in total \r\n    deprivation case) and Palm Beach Isles Assocs., 231 F.3d 1354 \r\n    (Fed. Cir. 2000) (Lucas eliminated this factor in total deprivation \r\n    case), petition for rehearing en banc denied 231 F.3d 1365 (Gajarsa, \r\n    J. dissenting); see also Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, \r\n    341 S.C. 297, 534 S.E.2d 270 (2000) (following Good).  Palazzolo \r\n    has not clearly resolved this issue.  In light of our disposition on the threshold \r\n    issue of background principles of state law discussed below, we need not decide \r\n    whether this factor applies to a total taking.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] The \r\n    Stateâ€™s presumptive title may be overcome only by showing a specific grant \r\n    from the sovereign which is strictly construed against the grantee.  Hobonny \r\n    Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 252 S.E.2d 133 (1979).  Cf. \r\n    City of Folly Beach v. Atlantic House Props., Ltd., 318 S.C. 450, 458 \r\n    S.E.2d 426 (1995) (without considering public trust, compensation was ordered \r\n    where it was uncontested plaintiff was â€œowner of recordâ€ of land below high \r\n    water mark).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [7] While \r\n    many of the cases cited above refer to land bordering â€œnavigable tidalâ€ water, \r\n    under South Carolina law tidal water is presumed navigable unless shown incapable \r\n    of navigation in fact, a showing not made here.  State v. Pacific \r\n    Guano Co., supra.  The fact that a waterway is artificial is irrelevant \r\n    since it is considered the functional equivalent of a natural waterway.  Hughes \r\n    v. Nelson, 303 S.C. 102, 399 S.E.2d 24 (1990).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8] The \r\n    value of the interest in land is to be determined at the time of condemnation.  \r\n    City of Folly Beach v. Atlantic House Props., Ltd., 318 S.C. 450, 458 \r\n    S.E.2d 426 (1995).  Condemnation occurred when the permits were denied by \r\n    a final decision.  See Palazzolo, 533 U.S. at 618.

Rosen and Donald B. Clark, of Rosen, Rosen &amp; Hagood, LLC, of \r\n  Charleston, for Petitioner.\r\nThomas R. Goldstein, of Belk, Cobb, Infinger &amp; Goldstein, PA, of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE PLEICONES:  We granted certiorari to review the \r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals interpreting Rule 63, SCRCP, in a case in \r\n  which the trial judge in a nonjury case became disabled before the \r\n  filing of an order containing his findings of fact and conclusions of law.  \r\n  Christy v. Christy, 347 S.C. 503, 556 S.E.2d 701 (Ct. App. 2001).  The \r\n  Court of Appeals held that under the circumstances of this case, a new trial \r\n  was required.  We agree, but base our decision on our long established rule \r\n  that a judge may change or alter his order in any way prior to its delivery \r\n  to the clerk of court for filing.  Since no order was filed prior to the trial \r\n  judgeâ€™s incapacity, a new trial is required.\r\nFACTS \r\nRespondent brought this action to terminate his alimony obligation \r\n  to petitioner alleging that petitioner had, in effect, entered into a common \r\n  law marriage.  Alternatively, respondent sought an alimony reduction based upon \r\n  his changed financial circumstances.  Petitioner counterclaimed for an increase \r\n  in alimony.\r\nThe common law marriage issue and the claims for modification of \r\n  alimony were bifurcated.  Family Court Judge Black heard the common law marriage \r\n  evidence, but became incapacitated before signing an order. \r\n  [1]   Judge Segars-Andrews, who had succeeded Judge Black, denied respondentâ€™s \r\n  motion for a new trial filed pursuant to Rule 63, SCRCP.  Judge Segars-Andrews \r\n  later signed an order, based in part on a draft order submitted to Judge Black, \r\n  finding there was no common law marriage.  Judge Biggs subsequently heard the \r\n  alimony modification claims, and issued an order finding in petitionerâ€™s favor.  \r\n  In a later order, Judge Biggs awarded petitioner attorneyâ€™s fees and \r\n  costs for the entire litigation.\r\nRespondent appealed [2] \r\n   all these family court orders.  The Court of Appeals held that Judge Segars-Andrews \r\n  erred in denying respondentâ€™s request for a new trial following Judge Blackâ€™s \r\n  incapacity, vacated her order, and remanded the common law marriage issue for \r\n  a new determination. [3]   Further, \r\n  the Court of Appeals vacated Judge Biggsâ€™ orders since they relied, at least \r\n  in part, on the resolution of the common law marriage claim.  Christy v. \r\n  Christy, supra.  We granted certiorari, and now affirm as modified.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nWhether a new trial is required when the trial judge who heard\r\na nonjury \r\n  matter dies or becomes incapacitated before the filing of a signed order containing \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS \r\nRule 63, SCRCP, [4]  \r\n  by its terms governs those situations where the trial judge becomes incapacitated \r\n  or dies after the filing of his findings of fact and conclusions of law, but \r\n  prior to the completion of post-trial acts authorized by the SCRCP.  As the \r\n  Court of Appeals found, other jurisdictions having our version of Rule 63 have \r\n  derived a â€˜negative inferenceâ€™ from the language of the rule, and concluded \r\n  that a new trial is mandated where, as here, the incapacity or death precedes \r\n  the filing of an order.  While we find no error in the Court of Appealsâ€™ analysis \r\n  of the rule, nor in its suggestion that two exceptions adopted by other jurisdictions \r\n  would be applicable under the appropriate circumstances, [5]  we hold that this case is governed not by any \r\n  negative inference derived from Rule 63, but rather by another principle of \r\n  state law. \r\nâ€œUntil the paper has been delivered by the judge to the clerk of court, to \r\n  be filed by him as an order in the case, it is subject to the control of the \r\n  judge, and may be withdrawn at any time before such delivery.â€  Archer v. \r\n  Long, 46 S.C. 292, 24 S.E. 83 (1896); see also e.g., Bowman v. \r\n  Richland Mem. Hosp., 335 S.C. 88, 515 S.E.2d 259 (Ct. App. 1999)(citing \r\n  Archer v. Long); compare Rule 58 (a), SCRCP (â€œA judgment is effective \r\n  only when . . . entered on the recordâ€); see also Ford v. State Ethics \r\n  Commâ€™n, 344 S.C. 642, 545 S.E.2d 821 (2001)(â€œUntil written and entered, \r\n  the trial judge retains discretion to change his mind and amend his oral rulingâ€).\r\nNo written order having been filed with the clerk of court by Judge Black prior \r\n  to his incapacity, a new trial is required.   Further, Judge Biggsâ€™ orders cannot \r\n  stand in light of our decision that a new trial is required on the common law \r\n  marriage claim.\r\nWe agree with the Court of Appeals that the appealed orders in this \r\n  matter must be vacated, and the entire matter remanded for further proceedings.  \r\n  The Chief Judge for Administrative Purposes of the Family Court for Charleston \r\n  County shall ensure that this case is scheduled, heard, and decided in an expeditious \r\n  matter.\r\nWe also agree with the Court of Appealsâ€™ suggestion that the parties may \r\n  consent to have all or some of the issues determined by the family court judge \r\n  upon the existing record.  In light of the protracted nature of this litigation, \r\n  we encourage the parties to expedite the disposition of these stale claims through \r\n  consent or stipulations.  Further, we order that should any appeal be taken \r\n  from orders issued on remand in these proceedings, such appeal shall be made \r\n  directly to this Court.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25644\r\nSubmitted April 17, 2002 - Filed April \r\n  28, 2003\r\n\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nChief Attorney Daniel T. Stacey, of Columbia; for Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W. McIntosh, Assistant Deputy Attorney General B. Allen Bullard\r\nAssistant Attorney General David Spencer, of Columbia; for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:  Antoine Cutner (â€œpetitionerâ€) \r\n  appeals his conviction, claiming the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over the charge of possession with intent to distribute marijuana within proximity \r\n  of a school, and that the trial court erred by allowing evidence that indicated \r\n  petitioner was a dealer of crack cocaine.  We affirm in part, reverse in part.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nPetitioner was convicted, after a trial \r\n  in his absence, of possession with intent to distribute (â€œPWIDâ€) marijuana and \r\n  PWID marijuana within proximity of a school.  Two days later, petitioner pled \r\n  guilty to other charges and was sentenced on those charges.  His sealed sentence \r\n  was opened and he was sentenced to ten years imprisonment for PWID marijuana \r\n  and five years imprisonment, to be served consecutively, for PWID marijuana \r\n  within proximity of a school.  No direct appeal was taken.\r\nPetitioner filed for post-conviction relief.  \r\n  After a hearing, the PCR court issued an order dismissing the PCR application \r\n  without prejudice and granting petitioner a belated direct appeal under White \r\n  v. State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).  Petitioner raises the following \r\n  issues on appeal.\r\n\r\nI.  Whether the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  over the charge of PWID marijuana within proximity of a school?\r\nII. Whether the trial court erred by permitting evidence \r\n  that petitioner was a dealer of crack cocaine?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nBefore trial, the State moved to amend \r\n  the indictment regarding the charge of PWID marijuana within proximity of a \r\n  school.  The indictment read:\r\n\r\nThat ANTOINE \r\n  CUTNER did in Richland County on or about March 30, 1998, distribute, sell, \r\n  purchase, manufacture, or unlawfully possess with intent to distribute, a controlled \r\n  substance, to wit:  marijuana, while in, on, or within a one-half mile radius \r\n  of the grounds of a public or private elementary, middle or secondary school; \r\n  a public playground or park; a public vocational or trade school or a technical \r\n  educational center; or a public or private college or university, to wit:  Ridgewood \r\n  Missionary Baptist Church.\r\n\r\n(emphasis \r\n  added).  The State, claiming a scrivenerâ€™s error, requested the indictment be \r\n  amended to read â€œto wit:  Eau Claire High School and/or Ridgewood/Babcock Center.â€\r\nPetitionerâ€™s counsel argued against the amendment stating the amendment would \r\n  change the nature of the offense charged. \r\n  [1]   The trial court overruled petitionerâ€™s objection, stating petitioner \r\n  was placed upon sufficient notice as to the charge he was facing.\r\nPetitioner claims the trial court erred \r\n  by granting the Stateâ€™s motion to amend the indictment to show the drugs were \r\n  possessed within proximity of Eau Claire High School, rather than Ridgewood \r\n  Baptist Church, as set forth in the indictment.\r\nA circuit court has subject matter jurisdiction \r\n  if:  (1) there has been an indictment which sufficiently states the offense; \r\n  (2) there has been a waiver of the indictment; or (3) the charge is a lesser-included \r\n  charge of the crime charged in the indictment.  Brown v. State, 343 S.C. \r\n  342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001) (citing Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 495 \r\n  S.E.2d 773 (1998)).  â€œThe true test of the sufficiency of an indictment is not \r\n  whether it could be made more definite and certain, but whether it contains \r\n  the necessary elements of the offense intended to be charged and sufficiently \r\n  apprises the defendant of what he must be prepared to meet.â€  Id. (quoting \r\n  Browning v. State, 320 S.C. 366, 368, 465 S.E.2d 358, 359 (1995) (emphasis \r\n  added by Brown).\r\nUnder South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-100 \r\n  (1985), the trial court â€œmay amend the indictment if such amendment does not \r\n  change the nature of the offense charged.â€  Generally, amendments are permitted \r\n  for the purposes of correcting an error of form, such as a scrivenerâ€™s error.  \r\n  State v. Jones, 211 S.C. 319, 45 S.E.2d 29 (1947).  Otherwise, if the \r\n  defendant objects to an amendment on grounds that the amended indictment would \r\n  change the nature of the offense, the trial judge is obligated to inform the \r\n  parties of the necessity of reindictment or obtain a waiver of presentment from \r\n  the defendant.  Hopkins v. State, 317 S.C. 7, 10, 451 S.E.2d 389 (1994).\r\nIn the case at hand, amending the indictment \r\n  from â€œto wit: Ridgewood Missionary Baptist Churchâ€ to state â€œto wit: Eau Claire \r\n  High School and/or Ridgewood/Babcock Centerâ€ is not a scrivenerâ€™s error.  Ridgewood \r\n  Missionary Baptist Church, Eau Claire High School, and Ridgewood/Babcock Center \r\n  are all entities within a one-half mile radius of where petitioner was arrested, \r\n  but only the schools make petitioner eligible for the additional penalties under \r\n  South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002).  Section 44-53-445 does not separately \r\n  criminalize distributing marijuana within proximity of a church, but the statute \r\n  does create a separate offense for distributing marijuana within proximity \r\n  of a school.  As such, amending the indictment to name Eau Claire High School \r\n  and/or Ridgewood/Babcock Center changes the nature of the offense.  \r\nCounsel for petitioner objected to the \r\n  amended indictment, which the trial court overruled.  Since the amendment was \r\n  not the result of a scrivenerâ€™s error and defense counsel objected, the trial \r\n  court only had two options under Hopkins: reindictment or waiver of presentment.  \r\n  The court pursued neither option to correct the defective indictment, and consequently \r\n  it lost its subject matter jurisdiction.  Thus, petitionerâ€™s conviction for \r\n  PWID within the proximity of a school must be reversed.           \r\nII. Crack Cocaine Evidence\r\nPetitioner argues the trial court erred \r\n  by permitting evidence indicating he was a dealer of crack cocaine.       \r\nAfter receiving a tip, Investigator Wendell Harris \r\n  and several other officers went to a wooded area in search of a person suspected \r\n  of dealing drugs.  Investigator Harris observed a known crack cocaine user exiting \r\n  the woods where the suspect was alleged to be.  Before Harris exited the car \r\n  in which he was riding, he saw a person fitting the description of the suspect \r\n  and recognized the person to be petitioner.  Upon exiting the car, he saw petitioner \r\n  â€œturn to run and . . . observed a black-like bag in his hand as he made the \r\n  turn.â€ \r\nHarris testified petitioner ran a few \r\n  feet into the woods with the bag before dropping it.  He chased petitioner through \r\n  the woods and by the time he reached the other side, another officer had apprehended \r\n  petitioner.  Petitioner indicated he had been in the woods to cut firewood.  \r\n  An officer later emerged from the woods with the bag Harris saw petitioner drop \r\n  and a beeper.  The bag had been located approximately fifteen feet into the \r\n  wooded area.  Inside the bag were plastic baggies, containing approximately \r\n  37 grams of marijuana, and a small scale.\r\nThe officer who located the bag and \r\n  beeper asked to whom the beeper belonged.  Petitioner indicated the beeper was \r\n  his, but the bag was not.  The beeper had been found within a few feet from \r\n  the bag.\r\nDuring trial, Investigator Harris testified \r\n  that while chasing petitioner, he observed petitioner â€œpulling out what appeared \r\n  to be white-like rocks and throwing them to the left and to the right.â€  He \r\n  also testified â€œ[b]ased on [his] experience, no doubt [petitioner] was getting \r\n  rid of crack cocaine.â€  At this point, defense counsel objected.  Following \r\n  an off-the-record bench conference, the trial court instructed the jury:\r\n\r\n. . . this defendant upon this indictment is charged with \r\n  possession with intent to distribute a quantity of marijuana, to which charge \r\n  he has pled not guilty.  There is some testimony here about crack cocaine.  \r\n  This defendant is not charged with possession of crack cocaine, he is not charged \r\n  with crack cocaine in any way whatsoever, so do not consider any testimony relative \r\n  to crack cocaine.  That is simply not an issue in this case.\r\n\r\nFollowing the instruction, Harris was \r\n  again asked about observing petitioner throwing out white objects without objection \r\n  by defense counsel.  The solicitor then questioned Harris about the fact that \r\n  petitioner was not charged with crack cocaine and that crack cocaine was not \r\n  found at the scene.  The following also occurred during Harrisâ€™ direct examination:\r\n\r\nQuestion:  Speaking of not being able to find the \r\n  crack cocaine on the ground and all this concern about children, because children \r\n  were out at 4 oâ€™clock when the defendant was selling drugs; correct?\r\n Answer:  Thatâ€™s correct.\r\n Question:  All right.  You even lost your -\r\nDefense counsel:  Objection . . .[t]here is no allegation \r\n  the defendant was selling drugs.\r\nSolicitor:  He says it in his statement.  . . .  I \r\n  withdraw the question.  . . .\r\n The court:  Withdraw the question.   . . .  Sustained.\r\n\r\nOn cross-examination, defense counsel \r\n  asked why the case summary and the incident report prepared by Harris did not \r\n  mention â€œseeing [petitioner] reach into his waistband and throw crack cocaine \r\n  on the ground.â€  Harris stated he did not include that information because it \r\n  was irrelevant.  Counsel then asked Harris if it was irrelevant, why he mentioned \r\n  it in his trial testimony.  Harris dodged this question.  The questioning continued: \r\n\r\n\r\nQuestion by defense counsel:  . . . you thought you \r\n  saw him throw crack cocaine on the ground and you didnâ€™t go back there and try \r\n  to find it, you just left it there for anybody to find, kids can walk back there \r\n  and get crack cocaine on the ground?\r\nAnswer:  No, we tried to recover it, but due to the \r\n  density of the woods and you talking about [sic] micrograms of crack, it would \r\n  be almost impossible to locate.\r\n\r\nPrior to trial, petitionerâ€™s statement \r\n  to the police was read aloud during the Jackson v. Denno \r\n  [2]  hearing.  The statement is as follows:\r\n\r\nQuestion by Investigator Harris:  Tell me what you \r\n  were doing in the woods at Ridgewood Apartments.\r\nAnswer:  I went in the woods to get my money from a \r\n  crack dealer that sells for me.\r\nQuestion:  How much dope did you have?\r\nAnswer:  Three hundred dollarsâ€™ worth.\r\nQuestion:  Why did you run from the police?\r\nAnswer:  I was scared because I got charges on me.\r\n. . .\r\nQuestion:  Who was the other guys [sic] out there \r\n  with you?\r\nAnswer:  Quinton Johnson and a subject named Terry.\r\nQuestion:  Was Quinton selling drugs?\r\nAnswer:  Yes.\r\nQuestion:  What does the crackhead sell for you?\r\nAnswer:  He sells crack for me.\r\nQuestion:  Is there anything else you would like to \r\n  add?\r\nAnswer:  No.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the hearing, defense counsel \r\n  objected to the statement under State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. \r\n  803 (1923) and Rule 404(b), SCRE, on the basis the statement was evidence of \r\n  other bad acts and that the prejudice of admitting the statement outweighed \r\n  its probative value.  The court admitted the statement under Rule 404(b).  The \r\n  court also noted the statement went â€œto the issue then being investigated.â€  \r\n  Upon the defenseâ€™s request, the court indicated it would give a limiting instruction \r\n  regarding the evidence.\r\nDuring Investigator Harrisâ€™ testimony, \r\n  petitionerâ€™s statement was read into the record.  The solicitor again asked \r\n  Harris questions about the relevancy of the crack evidence.  Harris indicated \r\n  even though petitioner gave a statement regarding crack, petitioner was not \r\n  charged with crack possession because no crack was located.  Counsel did not \r\n  object or request a limiting instruction at this time apparently because he \r\n  had previously objected and the court had given a limiting instruction regarding \r\n  the evidence.\r\nIn closing argument, the solicitor stated:\r\n\r\nThe only evidence in this case is that the defendant \r\n  profits by selling this garbage on our streets.  And the only evidence is that \r\n  he uses other people to sell this garbage as well as other types of trash and \r\n  drugs on our streets, and he profits from those people.\r\n. . . is the defense that the defendant was cutting wood, \r\n  is the defense that he doesnâ€™t deal in marijuana he only deals in crack . . \r\n  .\r\n\r\nDefense counsel, in closing argument, also discussed \r\n  the crack cocaine evidence.\r\nThe jury found petitioner guilty as charged.  \r\n  Counselâ€™s motion for a new trial based on previous objections that the crack \r\n  cocaine evidence was irrelevant to the case was denied.\r\nPetitioner argues the extensive crack \r\n  cocaine evidence was inadmissible and prejudicial.  \r\nWe find the crack cocaine evidence was \r\n  inadmissible under Rule 402, SCRE, which states that evidence that does not \r\n  relate to the crime charged, is irrelevant and inadmissible.  The crack cocaine \r\n  evidence did not bear on the crime charged, which was PWID of marijuana.  Irrelevant \r\n  evidence that was admitted by the trial judge is subject to a harmless error \r\n  analysis upon appellate review.  State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 647, \r\n  515 S.E.2d 98, 100 (1999).  We find the error harmless because there was sufficient \r\n  evidence presented to prove the PWID of marijuana charge.  Investigator Harris \r\n  testified that petitioner dropped a bag while he was chasing petitioner in the \r\n  woods.  Another officer picked up the bag, which contained a scale, plastic \r\n  baggies, and 37 grams of marijuana.  \r\nAccordingly, we find that the introduction \r\n  of the irrelevant crack cocaine evidence did not prejudice petitionerâ€™s conviction \r\n  on the PWID of marijuana charge.  \r\nConclusion\r\nWe find the trial court lacked subject \r\n  matter jurisdiction over the charge of PWID marijuana within proximity of a \r\n  school.  We further find the admission of the crack cocaine evidence was a harmless \r\n  error.  Accordingly, petitionerâ€™s conviction for PWID is AFFIRMED, and \r\n  petitionerâ€™s PWID within the proximity of a school is REVERSED.\r\nWALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.  \r\n  MOORE, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE MOORE (concurring in part and dissenting in part):  I respectfully \r\n  dissent from the portion of the majorityâ€™s opinion that reverses appellantâ€™s \r\n  conviction for PWID within the proximity of a school.\r\nAmending the indictment for PWID within proximity of a school to \r\n  list a school rather than a church did not change the nature of the offense \r\n  charged.  State v. Lynch, 344 S.C. 635, 545 S.E.2d 511 (2001) (indictment \r\n  may be amended provided such amendment does not change nature of offense charged).  \r\n  Prior to and after the amendment, appellant was charged with violating S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002), the statute prohibiting the possession of drugs \r\n  with the intent to distribute within the proximity of a school.  The possible \r\n  punishment appellant faced did not change, nor did the amendment alter the charge \r\n  in any fashion other than to correct a scrivenerâ€™s error naming a church instead \r\n  of a school.  See, e.g., State v. Batson, 261 S.C. 128, 198 S.E.2d \r\n  517 (1973) (amendment of indictment to insert name of agent to whom defendant \r\n  allegedly sold LSD did not change nature of offense charged and was permissible); \r\n  State v. Jones, 211 S.C. 319, 45 S.E.2d 29 (1947) (amendment correcting \r\n  misnomer as to name of victim in indictment charging assault with intent to \r\n  kill was not error where defendant was not misled and nature or grade of offense \r\n  was not changed).\r\nAccordingly, because the amended indictment contained the necessary \r\n  elements of the offense, did not change the nature of the offense charged, and \r\n  sufficiently apprised appellant of what he must be prepared to meet, [3]  the trial court had subject matter \r\n  jurisdiction over the offense of PWID marijuana within proximity of a school.  \r\n  See Brown v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 540 S.E.2d 846 (2001).\r\nI concur with section II of the majority opinion, which affirms the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding the admission of crack cocaine evidence.\r\nAccordingly, I would affirm appellantâ€™s convictions for PWID marijuana \r\n  and PWID marijuana within proximity of a school.\r\n BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-445 (2002) provides:\r\n  \r\n  It is a separate criminal \r\n    offense for a person to distribute, sell, purchase, manufacture, or to unlawfully \r\n    possess with intent to distribute, a controlled substance while in, on, or \r\n    within a one-half mile radius of the grounds of a public or private elementary, \r\n    middle, or secondary school; a public playground or park; a public vocational \r\n    or trade school or technical educational center; or a public or private college \r\n    or university.\r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  378 U.S. 368, 84 S.Ct. 1774, 12 L.Ed.2d 908 (1964).\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] While \r\n    arguing against the amendment, counsel for appellant admitted appellant was \r\n    clearly on notice from the indictment that the State proposed to try appellant \r\n    under the PWID within proximity of a school statute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25645","title":"In the Matter of W.

Neither the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Council (ODC) nor the respondent has filed a brief.  We disbar \r\n  respondent, retroactive to August 12, 1998.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent has admitted the allegations of the complaint, which are summarized \r\n  below:\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trust Fund Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent was the sole \r\n  proprietor of a firm that did a large amount of collection work.  In 1997, he \r\n  merged his practice with that of another firm [Firm].  As a result of the merger, \r\n  certain unethical practices of respondent came to light.\r\nFrom 1995 to 1997, respondent failed to maintain the integrity of his trust \r\n  account and of his operating account.  Respondent did not timely transmit documents \r\n  and checks.  Further, he misrepresented and/or converted some client funds to \r\n  pay other clients.\r\nRespondent handled a large number of collection matters for a Bank.  He would \r\n  collect funds from the Bankâ€™s debtors, then use those funds to pay himself fees \r\n  for other Bank matters.  The ODC identified fifteen checks whereby approximately \r\n  $89,000 was improperly withdrawn from respondentâ€™s trust fund and paid into \r\n  respondentâ€™s operating account.\r\nFollowing the 1997 merger between respondentâ€™s practice and the Firm, an audit \r\n  revealed a shortfall in respondentâ€™s trust account of $37,000 to $45,000.  The \r\n  Firm immediately deposited $45,000 into the account.  Respondentâ€™s largest client, \r\n  Bank, was subsequently billed and then paid $90,000 in legal fees for work done \r\n  by respondent.  This money was used to offset the Firmâ€™s $45,000 deposit into \r\n  respondentâ€™s trust account and to offset any client fund shortfall.  The Firm \r\n  eventually paid respondent $16,000, apparently after repaying itself and making \r\n  all of respondentâ€™s clients whole.\r\n\r\n  2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bank Matter\r\n\r\nRespondent settled a matter \r\n  for a client for $15,000, and deposited those funds into his trust account.  \r\n  In October 1996, he prepared a trust account check for $10,000, payable to client, \r\n  and placed the check in the clientâ€™s file.  In February 1997, the balance in \r\n  the trust account fell to $507.22, an amount insufficient to cover the $10,000 \r\n  check that had still not been delivered to respondentâ€™s client.  The client \r\n  was finally paid by a different check in May 1997.\r\nRespondent misappropriated these funds, or misapplied\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3.  Overpayment\r\n\r\nRespondentâ€™s client received \r\n  a $9,410 judgment against W.  W paid respondent approximately $7,000 toward \r\n  the judgment.  From this payment, respondent sent his client a check for $5,424 \r\n  and retained approximately $1,576 as his fee.  The judgment against W remained \r\n  on the record, and during a real estate transaction involving Wâ€™s property, \r\n  the closing attorney tendered respondent a check for the full amount of the \r\n  judgment, $9,410.  Respondent deposited this check in a different trust account, \r\n  and drew two checks, one to his client paying the remainder due on the judgment \r\n  and one to himself representing the balance of his fee.  Respondent placed the \r\n  clientâ€™s check and a cover letter in the clientâ€™s file.\r\nRespondent contemporaneously \r\n  prepared a check representing the overpayment made payable to the closing attorney, \r\n  and also placed this check in the clientâ€™s file.  Approximately nine months \r\n  later, one of respondentâ€™s employees directed respondentâ€™s attention to these \r\n  documents in the clientâ€™s file.  They remained in the file sixteen months later \r\n  when this investigation began.  Only after the ODC inquired were the funds returned, \r\n  with interest, to W.\r\n  4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Candor\r\nDuring this investigation, \r\n  respondent failed to identify two open trust accounts under his control, and \r\n  misrepresented to the ODC that he lacked signatory authority over any of the \r\n  Firmâ€™s accounts.  Further, he misrepresented that he was advancing fees when \r\n  in fact he was misappropriating funds, and misrepresented that he had deposited \r\n  $5,000 into his trust account when he had not.\r\nLAW\r\nThe Panel concluded respondent \r\n  had violated Rules 7(a)(1), (a)(5), and (a)(6) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary \r\n  Enforcement (RLDE), Rule 413, SCACR.  It also concluded respondent had violated \r\n  the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:  Rules 1.1, 1.3, \r\n  1.4, 1.5, 1.15, 3.3, 8.4(a), 8.4(b), 8.4(c), 8.4(d), and 8.4(e).\r\nThe Panel noted respondent \r\n  has no prior disciplinary record, and that he offered no mental or physical \r\n  infirmities in mitigation.  It recommended a retroactive disbarment.  This Court \r\n  is not bound by this recommendation, but administers the sanction it deems appropriate \r\n  after a thorough review of the record.  E.g., In the Matter of Zenner, \r\n  348 S.C. 499, 560 S.E.2d 406 (2002).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the appropriate sanction in this matter is disbarment, \r\n  with the date of the disbarment to run from August 12, 1998.  Within fifteen \r\n  days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the \r\n  Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, \r\n  and shall also surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law \r\n  to the Clerk of Court.  Further, respondent shall, within thirty days of the \r\n  date of this opinion, pay the costs of this proceeding ($538.48).  \r\n DISBARRED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  In the Matter of Strickland, 332 S.C. 87, \r\n    504 S.E.2d 317 (1998).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of George Eugene Lafaye, IV","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-04-24-01","description":"This order reinstates George Eugene Lafaye, IV, to the practice of law subject to certain conditions.","date":"2003-04-28","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of George Eugene Lafaye, IV,&nbsp;&nbsp;Petitioner.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nOn December 3, 2001, petitioner \r\n  was suspended for one year from the practice of law in this state.Â  In the \r\n  Matter of Lafaye, 347 S.C. 441, 556 S.E.2d 390 (2001).Â  Petitioner has now \r\n  filed a petition for reinstatement.Â  The Committee on Character and Fitness \r\n  recommends the petition be granted, subject to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;If petitioner returns to the practice of law after readmission, he must practice under the guidance of a licensed attorney at law; this mentor shall report to the Supreme Court at six month intervals for twenty-four months.\r\n \r\n  2.&nbsp; Petitioner must repay the financial obligations arising from his misconduct that were paid on his behalf by Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas, including those amounts forgiven by Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas.\r\n \r\n\r\nWe grant the petition, subject to the conditions set \r\n  forth by the Committee on Character and Fitness, and reinstate petitioner to \r\n  the practice of law in South Carolina.Â  Petitioner shall have one year form \r\n  the date of this order to repay the amounts owed to Moore, Taylor &amp; Thomas.Â  \r\n  Petitioner shall provide proof that he has met this requirement to the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.Â  In addition, all required reports from petitionerâ€™s \r\n  mentor should be filed with the Office of Disciplinary Counsel instead of this \r\n  Court.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            s/Jean H.

Hickson, \r\n  350 S.C. 213, 565 S.E.2d 763 (2002), Billy Hickson sought to file a petition \r\n  for a writ of certiorari in this Court, pursuant to Ex parte Cauthen, \r\n  after the Court of Appeals affirmed the termination of Hickson's parental rights.Â  \r\n  Hickson was allowed to proceed without paying filing fees pursuant to Ex \r\n  parte Cauthen.Â  The Court denied the petition for a writ of certiorari, \r\n  but stated \r\n\r\nwe take this opportunity to hold that it is unnecessary to file a petition for a writ of certiorari after a Cauthen appeal has been decided by the Court of Appeals.Â  The filing of a Cauthen appeal ensures that the trial transcript will be reviewed for any possible issues of arguable merit.Â  Thus, it is unnecessary to file a petition for a writ of certiorari after the Court of Appeals has affirmed pursuant to Cauthen. \r\n\r\nBecause we realize our holding in Hickson \r\n  is not entirely clear, we take this opportunity to clarify our intention therein.Â  \r\n  In Hickson, the Court intended to hold, as it did with Anders \r\n  cases inÂ  State v. McKennedy, 348 S.C. 270, 559 S.E.2d 850 (2002), that \r\n  petitions for discretionary review to this Court, after full review of the merits \r\n  by the Court of Appeals pursuant to Ex parte Cauthen, are outside the \r\n  standard review process.Â  See also In re Exhaustion of State \r\n  Remedies in Criminal and Post-Conviction Relief, 321 S.C. 563, 471 S.E.2d \r\n  454 (1990).Â  The rights afforded an indigent parent pursuant to Ex parte \r\n  Cauthen, specifically the appointment of counsel and the waiver of filing \r\n  fees and costs of perfecting the appeal, apply only to the first appeal of right, \r\n  which in this case was before the Court of Appeals, and not to discretionary \r\n  review by this Court.Â  We therefore deny petitioner's motion to be allowed to \r\n  proceed without costs.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        \r\n            s/Jean H.
