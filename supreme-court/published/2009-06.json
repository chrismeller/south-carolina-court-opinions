Moorhead, of Greenville, for\r\n  Appellant/Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\tC.\r\n  Stuart Mauney and T. David Rheney, both of Gallivan, White &amp; Boyd, of Greenville, for Respondent/Appellant.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This action arose out of\r\n  an automobile accident in which Noel Dillon was injured due to Neil Frazerâ€™s\r\n  admitted negligence.Â  The men were co-employees of a company located in Ontario, Canada and both were residents of Ontario.Â  After a jury verdict for $6,000, Dillon[1] appealed the trial courtâ€™s refusal to grant a new\r\n  trial absolute on damages.Â  Frazer appealed four points, all relating to\r\n  whether or not Dillonâ€™s action should have been barred by the exclusivity\r\n  statute found in Ontario workersâ€™ compensation law.Â  We certified the case\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We now affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling refusing\r\n  to apply Ontario law, reverse the trial courtâ€™s refusal of a new trial absolute\r\n  as to damages, and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  2002, Dillon and Frazer were employed by Massiv Die-Form (Massiv), a Canadian\r\n  corporation with no facilities or place of business in South Carolina.Â  The men\r\n  were in Greenville, South Carolina working for Massiv.Â  During their visit,\r\n  Dillon and Frazer stayed at a hotel in Greenville and drove a rental car, all\r\n  of which was paid for by Massiv.Â  Both Dillon and Frazer were paid 30 minutes\r\n  per day for the travel time between their hotel and the worksite.Â  Frazer was\r\n  the only employee authorized to drive the rental car.\r\nDillon sustained\r\n  injuries in a car accident when Frazer ran a stop sign in a car in which Dillon\r\n  was a passenger.Â  Dillon was transported by ambulance to a hospital, where it\r\n  was determined that he had eight fractured ribs on his right side and two on\r\n  his left, a fractured sternum, a fractured clavicle, a fractured left thumb,\r\n  and a punctured lung.Â  He was admitted to the hospital where he remained for\r\n  two days.Â  Once back in Canada, Dillon received physical therapy.Â  The\r\n  remainder of his care was covered by the Canadian Health System and those costs\r\n  were not sought in this action.\r\nDue to his\r\n  punctured lung, Dillon was not medically able to fly back to Canada until the Friday following his release from the hospital.Â  He did not return to work\r\n  for at least 10 weeks.Â  Initially, Dillon returned to full-time work, but\r\n  performed fewer overtime hours than prior to his injuries.Â  Dillon testified\r\n  that, prior to the accident, he worked roughly between 900 and 1,100 hours of\r\n  overtime and double time each year.Â  He stated that, after the accident, the number\r\n  of hours he was able to work diminished.\r\nFrazer admitted\r\n  liability, so the only questions remaining for the jury were the amount of\r\n  damages due Dillon and whether Dillonâ€™s wife was entitled to damages for loss\r\n  of consortium.Â  All told, Dillonâ€™s hospital care in Greenville amounted to\r\n  $10,518.Â  Dillon also claimed $320 for EMS transportation to the hospital and\r\n  $1,188 in physical therapy bills.Â  In addition to compensation for medical\r\n  care, Dillon also contended that he was entitled to $509,168 in lost past and\r\n  future earnings, including $101,350 in lost wages from the date of injury to\r\n  the estimated trial date and $407,818 for the post-trial period, based on calculations\r\n  by Dillonâ€™s expert.\r\nDuring\r\n  deliberations, the jury sent questions to the judge asking whether any\r\n  compensation had been paid to Dillon by a third party.Â  The jury awarded Dillon\r\n  $6,000 and found for Frazer on the consortium claim by Dillonâ€™s wife.Â  Dillon\r\n  moved for a new trial nisi additur or in the alternative, for a new\r\n  trial absolute as to damages only.Â  The trial court granted Dillonâ€™s motion for additur and increased the damages by $15,000, bringing the total amount\r\n  of damages to $21,000.Â  He denied all other motions.\r\nI. \r\nNew trial absolute\r\nDillon\r\n  argues on appeal that the trial court erred by not granting a new trial\r\n  absolute as to damages.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court has sound discretion when addressing questions of excessiveness or\r\n  inadequacy of verdicts, and its decision will not be disturbed absent an abuse of\r\n  discretion. Toole v. Toole, 260 S.C. 235, 239, 195 S.E.2d 389, 390 (1973).Â \r\n  â€œThe trial court must grant a new trial absolute if the amount of the verdict\r\n  is grossly inadequate or excessive so as to shock the conscience of the court\r\n  and clearly indicates the figure reached was the result of passion, caprice,\r\n  prejudice, partiality, corruption or some other improper motive.Â  The failure\r\n  of the trial judge to grant a new trial absolute in this situation amounts to\r\n  an abuse of discretion and on appeal this Court will grant a new trial\r\n  absolute.â€ Vinson v. Hartley, 324 S.C. 389, 404-05, 477 S.E.2d 715, 723\r\n  (Ct. App. 1996).Â  When considering a motion for a new trial based on the\r\n  inadequacy or excessiveness of the juryâ€™s verdict, the trial court must\r\n  distinguish between awards that are merely unduly liberal or conservative and\r\n  awards that are actuated by passion, caprice, prejudice, or some other improper\r\n  motive. Elam v. S.C. Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772\r\n  (2004).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn Kalchthaler\r\n  v. Workman, 316 S.C. 499, 450 S.E.2d 621 (Ct. App. 1994), the Court of\r\n  Appeals held that a party, having requested and been granted an additur,\r\n  cannot complain of the amount.Â  However, this does not preclude a party that is\r\n  granted additur from appealing the trial judgeâ€™s refusal to grant a new\r\n  trial absolute. Sullivan v. Davis, 317 S.C. 462, 467, 454 S.E.2d 907,\r\n  911 (Ct. App. 1995).\r\nDillon\r\n  presented evidence of over $500,000 in damages as a result of the accident.Â \r\n  While Frazer contested portions of Dillonâ€™s claim, unchallenged testimony at\r\n  trial established the following damages: $10,518 in medical bills, $320.00 for EMS transportation to the hospital, $1,188 in physical therapy bills, and $18,000 in lost\r\n  wages and overtime pay.Â  This totals $30,026 in undisputed damages.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find the jury verdict of $6,000 irreconcilably inconsistent with the unchallenged\r\n  evidence presented at trial.Â  The disparity between the award and the admitted\r\n  damages goes beyond a merely conservative award and suggests that the jurors were\r\n  motivated by improper considerations.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  suggestion is borne out by the following three questions asked by the jury\r\n  during deliberations: (1) if it could see the deposition of the human resources\r\n  director for Massiv; (2) whether Dillon received any compensation while he was\r\n  not working during the ten weeks after the accident; and (3) whether medical\r\n  bills for the accident were paid for, and if so, by whom.Â  The trial judge\r\n  responded that those matters â€œare not for your concern.â€Â  The juryâ€™s verdict demonstrates\r\n  that the jury failed to follow the courtâ€™s instruction. \r\nIn Sullivan, supra, the jury sent questions to the trial judge inquiring as to what\r\n  medical expenses had been covered by insurance. Id. at 466, 454 S.E.2d\r\n  at 910.Â  The jury awarded $20,000 despite the plaintiffâ€™s medical bills totaling\r\n  roughly $130,000, leading the Court of Appeals to conclude that â€œ[t]he jurors\r\n  obviously did not follow the courtâ€™s instructions to disregard insurance. . . .\r\n  Therefore we must set it aside and grant a new trial absolute.â€ Id. at 466-67, 454 S.E.2d at 910-11.Â  In the instant case, the record demonstrates\r\n  that the jury ignored the trial courtâ€™s instruction to disregard matters\r\n  relating to third party payment of medical bills.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  juryâ€™s award of $6,000 in the face of over $30,000 in undisputed damages is\r\n  grossly inadequate and demonstrates that the verdict was actuated by improper\r\n  motivation.Â  No plausible reason for the amount of the verdict has been\r\n  advanced.Â  For these reasons, the trial court erred in not granting Dillonâ€™s\r\n  motion for a new trial absolute.\r\nII.\r\nApplication of Ontario law\r\nFrazer\r\n  argues in relation to the Ontario workerâ€™s compensation exclusivity law, that\r\n  the trial court erred: (1) in refusing to apply the exclusivity law; (2) in\r\n  refusing to admit evidence on the exclusivity law; (3) in refusing to charge\r\n  the jury on the exclusivity law; and (4) in denying Frazerâ€™s motion for\r\n  judgment notwithstanding the verdict based on application of the exclusivity\r\n  law.Â  Because each point hinges on the applicability of Ontario workerâ€™s\r\n  compensation law and the exclusivity law, we address these points as one and\r\n  affirm on the ground that Frazer failed to plead Ontario law and so, is barred\r\n  under Rules 12(b) and 8(c). See Rule 12(b), SCRCP (every defense must be\r\n  asserted in the responsive pleading); Rule 8(c), SCRCP (in a responsive\r\n  pleading a party â€œshall set forth affirmatively . . . any other matter\r\n  constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense.â€).[2]\r\nEven\r\n  if Frazerâ€™s argument was preserved, we find that lex loci delicto properly governs this case. See Lister v. Nationsbank of Delaware,\r\n  329 S.C. 133,, 143, 494 S.E.2d 449, 454 (Ct. App. 1998) (In choice of law in South Carolina, the general rule is that the substantive law governing a tort action is the\r\n  law of the state where the injury occurred.); Oshiek v. Oshiek, 244 S.C.\r\n  249, 136 S.E.2d 303, 305 (1964), overruled on other grounds (In tort\r\n  cases, the law of the place where the injury was occasioned or inflicted\r\n  governs in respect of the right of action.).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s refusal to apply Ontario law and reverse the denial of Dillonâ€™s motion for a new trial absolute.Â  Since\r\n  Frazer admitted liability, we remand for a new trial on damages only.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Though Elizabeth Dillon filed Notice of Appeal, she did not pursue her appeal.\r\n[2] Frazer asserted South Carolina workerâ€™s compensation law in his pleadings, but\r\n  did not include Ontario workerâ€™s compensation law.Â  The trial court denied his\r\n  motion to amend his pleadings to include Ontario law.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26657","title":"State v.

Â State v. Edwards, 373 S.C. 230, 644 S.E.2d 66 (Ct. App. 2007).[1]Â \r\n  We affirm as modified.Â  We adhere to this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence and hold that a\r\n  trial court may admit evidence of witness intimidation when the defendant is\r\n  established as the source of the intimidation.Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nI.\r\nA\r\n  jury found Daniel Edwards, Jr., guilty on three counts of criminal sexual\r\n  conduct with a minor, second degree, and he was sentenced to prison.Â  The minor\r\n  was his step-daughter.Â  The Stateâ€™s witnesses included the victim and her\r\n  mother (Edwardsâ€™ wife).Â  The victimâ€™s mother testified that Edwards told her\r\n  â€œto get in touch with [the victim] and have her not show up because he had a\r\n  hit out on her, [and] that she wouldnâ€™t make it through the courtroom doors.â€Â \r\n  When asked whether Edwards ever said â€œanything about what he would do to [the\r\n  victim] if he were to go to jail on these charges,â€ the victimâ€™s mother stated\r\n  that â€œ[h]e told me that he would have her killed or he would kill her when he\r\n  got out.â€Â  This evidence was admitted over Edwardsâ€™ objection.\r\nBefore\r\n  admitting the testimony into evidence, the trial court carefully considered\r\n  counselsâ€™ arguments and thoroughly examined the issue.Â  \r\n\r\n\tIt is a\r\n  statement by the defendant, alleged statement of the defendant.Â  Clearly there\r\n  is a reasonable inference to be drawn from the statement that the testimony of\r\n  the witness would be damaging to him. . . . \r\n\t. . .Â  [It] could be construed by the jury to some\r\n  extent as an admission that he is guilty and will be found guilty and that he\r\n  will punish her for that, for testifying to what, considering all the evidence\r\n  in the light most favorable to the state . . . that he is the perpetrator of\r\n  this crime. \r\n\t. . .Â  In this case, clearly in this situation, with\r\n  the nature of the crime, I feel that it is tantamount to a threat, an attempted\r\n  threat to discourage a witness from testifying.Â  \r\n\tThere could be a logical inference that it wasnâ€™t\r\n  made.Â  There could be an inference, and youâ€™re entitled to cross-examine, but\r\n  the jury is entitled to weigh that.Â  I think that the probative value as to\r\n  certainly being corroborative, while itâ€™s not necessary--Iâ€™m going to charge\r\n  the jury accordingly.Â  It corroborates the Stateâ€™s position.Â  It corroborates\r\n  the allegations that heâ€™s the perpetrator.Â  There could be no other logical\r\n  explanation for the statement being made other than to intimidate a witness.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tAnd for those reasons I think the prejudice is\r\n  outweighed significantly by the probative value, so I will permit the testimony\r\n  over the objection of counsel.Â  \r\n\r\nEdwards\r\n  appealed, contending the evidence of alleged threats and witness intimidation\r\n  was improperly admitted because the evidence was â€œunreliable.â€Â  The court of\r\n  appeals affirmed, relying primarily on case law from other jurisdictions,\r\n  particularly the federal courts of appeals. The court of appeals observed\r\n  that â€œ[t]his appears to be a novel issue to South Carolinaâ€ and concluded by\r\n  stating:\r\n\r\n\tWhile the precedents from other jurisdictions are not\r\n  controlling, we find them persuasive and in this case elect to adopt their\r\n  analysis. Â Just as conflicting statements and attempts to flee are indicative\r\n  of â€œguilty knowledge and intent,â€ so too are the threats communicated here.Â \r\n  Consequently, the trial judge did not err in admitting the evidence regarding\r\n  threats by Edwards against the victim/witness.\r\n\r\nEdwards, 373 S.C. at 237, 240, 644 S.E.2d at 70, 71 (internal\r\n  citation omitted).Â  \r\n\r\nII.\r\nIn\r\n  criminal cases, this Court sits to review errors of law only.Â  State v.\r\n    Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 48, 625 S.E.2d 216, 220 (2006).\r\nA.\r\nThe\r\n  question presented is not novel to South Carolina.Â  This stateâ€™s jurisprudence\r\n  answers this challenge to the admissibility of evidence of witness intimidation,\r\n  especially Edwardsâ€™ focus on the reliability of the evidence.[2]\r\nIn State v. Rogers, 96 S.C. 350, 80 S.E. 620\r\n  (1914), this Court addressed the admissibility of an unsigned letter delivered\r\n  to a witness who later testified against Rogers.Â  Rogers was â€œtried and convicted\r\n  under an indictment charging him with willful and malicious injury to the cars\r\n  and engine of the Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Company, and endangering the\r\n  lives of the train crew and passengers.â€Â  Id. at 351, 80 S.E. at 620.Â \r\n  The letter introduced at trial was addressed to a witness for the State; the\r\n  letter â€œwas of a threatening nature, with a coffin drawn on it, and intended to\r\n  intimidate.â€Â  Id. at 351, 80 S.E. at 620.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, the judge instructed the jury not to consider the letter as testimony to\r\n  prove Rogersâ€™ guilt unless the State connected him to the letter, which it\r\n  never did.Â  This Court found the omission harmless, but made it clear the\r\n  admission of the letter was in error: â€œ[h]is honor should not have admitted in\r\n  evidence the letter . . . without connecting the defendant in some manner with\r\n  it.Â  It would have been better to require the [S]tate then and there, after it\r\n  was admitted, to connect the defendant with it, and, upon failure to do so, to\r\n  have ruled it out.â€Â  Id. at 352, 80 S.E. at 621.\r\nThis\r\n  is the reliability analysis requested by Edwardsâ€”that is, the proponent of the\r\n  evidence of intimidation must connect the defendant with the threat.Â  Without\r\n  establishing that connection, the evidence concerning witness intimidation is\r\n  unreliable and therefore inadmissible. Â \r\nThis\r\n  analysis is further supported by our reasoning and decision in State v.\r\n    Center, 205 S.C. 42, 30 S.E.2d 760 (1944).Â  In Center, this Court addressed\r\n  the admissibility of evidence relating to witness intimidation.Â  Center was\r\n  convicted of violating a law dealing with the sale of alcohol.Â  At trial,\r\n  testimony revealed that Centerâ€™s son came â€œto the shop [where one of the\r\n  witnesses worked] and whipped [him] on [his] job.â€Â  Id. at 47, 30 S.E.2d\r\n  at 763.Â  According to the witness, â€œ[Centerâ€™s son] said that if I got on the\r\n  stand . . . that [what he had just done] was not half what he was going to do\r\n  for me if I swore against his mother.â€Â  Id. at 47-48, 30 S.E.2d at 763.Â \r\n  The witness later revealed that being â€œwhippedâ€ meant he â€œ[b]lacked my eye.â€Â  Id. at 48, 30 S.E.2d at 763.Â  The trial court admitted the witness intimidation\r\n  evidence and Center was convicted.Â  This Court reversed the conviction.\r\n\r\n\tThere is\r\n  no testimony whatever that the defendant had any knowledge of such transaction,\r\n  therefore they are the acts of a third party and such testimony is prejudicial\r\n  where it is not shown the accused was privy thereto in that it is obnoxious to\r\n  the rule of law res inter alios acta which is defined as â€œâ€˜Things done between\r\n  strangers ought not to injure those who are not parties thereto.â€™â€Â  \r\n\t. . . .\r\n\tIn\r\n  the above cited case the ones alleged to have made the threats were the mother\r\n  and sister of the accused while in [the] instant case it was the son of the\r\n  accused.Â  In neither case was there any testimony showing that the accused had\r\n  any knowledge of such threats.\r\n\r\nId. at 49-50, 30 S.E.2d at 764 (internal citation\r\n  omitted).\r\nCenter stands for the proposition that the admissibility of\r\n  witness intimidation evidence turns on whether the source of the intimidation\r\n  may be linked to the defendant.Â  The Rogers and Center analyses speak\r\n  directly to the reliability sought by Edwards.Â  \r\nIn State\r\n  v. Goodson, 225 S.C. 418, 429, 82 S.E.2d 804, 809 (1954), a concurring\r\n  opinion from this Court recognized that â€œ[e]vidence that a person charged with [a]\r\n  crime procured or attempted to procure [the] absence of a witness or to bribe\r\n  or suppress testimony against him tends to show unrighteousness of defendantâ€™s\r\n  cause and a consciousness of guilt.â€\r\nMore\r\n  recently, in Mincey v. State, 314 S.C. 355, 444 S.E.2d 510 (1994), we\r\n  dealt with the prejudicial effect of a solicitorâ€™s unsubstantiated reference in\r\n  closing argument to witness intimidation.Â  Elijah Mincey was convicted of\r\n  distributing drugs.Â  During Minceyâ€™s trial several people at the scene of the\r\n  alleged drug distribution testified that he was not involved.Â  In the Stateâ€™s\r\n  closing argument, the solicitor referred to Mincey as â€œa pretty intimidating\r\n  man.â€ Â The solicitor also stated â€œ[Elijah Mincey] must be pretty intimidating\r\n  for these guys [to deny Minceyâ€™s involvement in the drug transaction],â€ and\r\n  concerning the confidential informer, â€œ[m]aybe sheâ€™s intimidated by Elijah.â€Â  Id. at 357-58, 444 S.E.2d at 511.Â  \r\nMincey sought post-conviction relief on the basis that trial\r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s comments\r\n  concerning witness intimidation.Â  The post-conviction relief court denied\r\n  relief, and we reversed and remanded for a new trial.Â  In granting post-conviction\r\n  relief, we noted the absence of â€œevidence that Mincey intimidated any of the\r\n  witnesses.â€Â  Id. at 358, 444 S.E.2d at 512.Â  \r\nToday we follow Rogers, Center, the concurring\r\n  opinion in Goodson, and Mincey and hold that witness intimidation\r\n  evidence, if linked to the defendant, may be admitted to show a consciousness\r\n  of guilt.Â  Establishing the defendant as the source of the intimidation\r\n  provides the necessary reliability for admissibility.Â  Here, the mother of the\r\n  victim identified Edwards as the author of the intimidation.Â  Because the State\r\n  presented evidence linking Edwards as the source of the witness intimidation,\r\n  we find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the evidence.[3]\r\nB.\r\nOur\r\n  approach follows the majority of jurisdictions that have addressed the issue.Â \r\n  For example, in United States v. Hayden, 85 F.3d 153, 159 (4th Cir.\r\n  1996), the court noted that â€œ[e]vidence of witness intimidation is admissible\r\n  to prove consciousness of guilt and criminal intent under Rule 404(b), if the\r\n  evidence (1) is related to the offense charged and (2) is reliable.â€Â  Hayden\r\n  challenged the trial courtâ€™s admission of â€œevidence that he had written a\r\n  threatening letter to a witnessâ€ and that he â€œtelephoned [a witness] to\r\n  threaten [the witness] and his family if [the witness] testified.â€Â  Id. at 158-59.Â  With regard to the letter, the Hayden court found:\r\n\r\n\tThere\r\n  was no handwriting analysis, nor were there any fingerprints, and the letter\r\n  was not signedâ€”it was sent anonymously.Â  The letterâ€™s content, however, pointed\r\n  to [Hayden] as its author.Â  The letter referred to the recipient as owing the\r\n  writer money for drugs unpaid for.Â  The recipient of the letter testified that\r\n  . . . Hayden was the only person to whom he had ever owed drug money and about\r\n  whom he was planning to testify.Â  Thus, the recipient established the identity\r\n  of the writer of the letter to a fairly reliable degree.\r\n\r\nId. at 159.Â  As\r\n  for the phone call, the court noted that the witness â€œwas able to identify the\r\n  voice [of Hayden].â€Â  Id.Â  From the analysis in Hayden, it is\r\n  reasonable to conclude that the Fourth Circuit equates the matter of\r\n  reliability with the ability of the proponent of the evidence to link the\r\n  threat to the defendant.\r\nAs noted, the prevailing view\r\n  across the country is in accord, as our court of appeals commendably\r\n  demonstrated in its thorough research of witness intimidation evidence in other\r\n  jurisdictions.Â  Edwards, 373 S.C. at 238-39, 644 S.E.2d at 70-71.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nEdwards urges this\r\n  Court to disallow, essentially on policy grounds, the type of witness intimidation\r\n  evidence presented here.Â  Edwards argues that the evidence is inherently\r\n  unreliable and allowing such evidence will promote false allegations of witness\r\n  intimidation.Â  We do not discount Edwardsâ€™ concerns.Â  Yet we ultimately trust\r\n  our adversarial system to work as designed.Â  The trial judge serves a critical gatekeeping role, under Rule 403, SCRE, and otherwise, in determining the\r\n  admissibility of evidence.Â  Assuming the foundation for witness intimidation\r\n  evidence has been satisfied and the evidence further survives a Rule 403 challenge,\r\n  we trust the collective wisdom of juries to sift through conflicting evidence\r\n  and find the truth.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  addition, while our jurisprudence in this area has been consistent since the\r\n  early 1900s, it has been infrequent.Â  In light of this Courtâ€™s infrequent\r\n  experience with this issue, and our review of other jurisdictions, we do not\r\n  foresee a floodgate of witness intimidation evidence.Â  \r\nAnd\r\n  finally, we are persuaded that the suggested per se rule disallowing\r\n  evidence of witness intimidation would invite the very intimidation our system\r\n  abhors.Â  On balance, a cautious approach allowing for the admissibility of witness\r\n  intimidation evidence serves to discourage witness intimidation as well as\r\n  minimize the potential for false claims of witness intimidation.\r\nIV.\r\nBecause evidence\r\n  was presented pointing to Edwards as the source of the witness intimidation and\r\n  the trial court, after careful consideration, determined that the probative\r\n  value was not substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice, we\r\n  find no abuse of discretion in the admission of the evidence of witness\r\n  intimidation.Â  The court of appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  AS MODIFIED. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The court of appeals also disposed of issues concerning the admission of\r\n  prior bad acts evidence and the denial of a motion for a mistrial.Â  Certiorari was granted only on the challenge to the witness\r\n  intimidation evidence.\r\n[2]&nbsp; As noted, the testimony elicited during trial revealed that Edwards\r\n  asked his wife to relay a death threat to the victim.Â  We can envision a litany\r\n  of other forms of witness intimidation, but for purposes of uniformity, we\r\n  believe the term witness intimidation sufficiently captures the nature of the\r\n  evidence in most situations.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The admission of evidence, of course, remains in the sound discretion of\r\n  the trial court.Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded for a host of reasons,\r\n  including a finding under Rule 403, SCRE, that the probative value of the\r\n  evidence is substantially outweighed by its prejudicial effect.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26659","title":"In the Matter of Kernard Edward Redmond","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26659","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter involving nine complaints against Kernard Edward Redmond.","date":"2009-06-01","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Kernard Edward Redmond, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26659\r\nHeard April 9, 2009 - Filed June 1, 2009Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tDisciplinary\r\n  Counsel Lesley M. Coggiola and Deputy Disciplinary Counsel Barbara M. Seymour, both\r\n  of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tKernard\r\n  Edward Redmond, of Darlington, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  This is an attorney\r\n  disciplinary matter involving nine complaints against Kernard Edward Redmond\r\n  (Respondent).Â  After a full investigation by the Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  (ODC), the Commission on Lawyer Conduct filed formal charges against\r\n  Respondent.Â  ODC and Respondent stipulated to specific facts and rule violations.Â \r\n  At a hearing before the Commission on Lawyer Conduct Panel (Panel), Respondent\r\n  acknowledged his misconduct, expressed remorse, and presented evidence of his\r\n  current success in the practice of law.Â  A three-member majority of the Panel\r\n  recommended that Respondent be admonished for his misconduct.Â  One member of\r\n  the Panel recommended a public reprimand and payment of costs, while another\r\n  member recommended a definite suspension and payment of costs.\r\nWe\r\n  find Respondentâ€™s acknowledgement of his misconduct and remorse to be sincere\r\n  and effective in the mitigation of his sanction.Â  We further find that as the\r\n  investigation progressed, Respondent was cooperative with ODC. Â Nonetheless,\r\n  due to Respondentâ€™s prior disciplinary history[1] and the gravity and cumulative nature of his misconduct, we decline to adopt\r\n  the majorityâ€™s recommendation of an admonition.Â  Accordingly, we hereby\r\n  publicly reprimand Respondent and order him to pay the costs of the\r\n  disciplinary proceedings.Â  The facts, as stipulated to by ODC and Respondent,\r\n  are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nMatter A\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client A on criminal charges arising out of a 1999 incident.Â  Client\r\n  A was tried and convicted.Â  Due to Respondentâ€™s inattention to detail and\r\n  failure to communicate with Client A, the Office of Appellate Defense (OAD)\r\n  declined to represent him.[2]Â \r\n  Respondent filed an appellate brief on Client Aâ€™s behalf, but ignored Client\r\n  Aâ€™s requests that he move to be relieved as counsel.Â  Client A repeatedly asked\r\n  Respondent to produce his file, but Respondent refused to do so until he reimburse\r\n  Respondent $1,950.00 for the cost of his trial transcript. Â \r\nOn\r\n  multiple occasions, OAD informed Respondent that it would represent Client A if\r\n  Respondent filed a motion to be relieved as counsel.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  inform Client A of OADâ€™s offer and failed to file a motion to be relieved.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s response to the notice of full investigation in Matter A was not\r\n  timely.\r\nMatter B\r\nIn\r\n  January 2002, Client B hired Respondent to pursue a civil claim on his behalf.Â \r\n  Respondent became aware that Client B previously filed his claim in\r\n  magistrateâ€™s court where it was dismissed with prejudice.Â  Despite knowing of\r\n  no reason that the claim would not be dismissed, Respondent re-filed the claim\r\n  in circuit court.Â  The claim was dismissed on res judicata grounds.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  during the course of litigation, Respondent misplaced Client Bâ€™s photographic\r\n  evidence and, therefore, did not timely respond to defense counselâ€™s discovery\r\n  requests.Â  Respondent was late in responding to ODCâ€™s initial inquiry into\r\n  Matter B as well as subsequent requests for additional information.Â  \r\nMatter C\r\nIn\r\n  2001, Respondent represented Client C for criminal charges to which Client C\r\n  pled guilty.Â  After Respondent left private practice to work at the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  office, Client Câ€™s mother asked Respondent for help in getting his sentence\r\n  reduced.Â  Respondent referred her to his old law firm but also undertook\r\n  certain duties consistent with continued representation.Â  Respondent admitted\r\n  that although he intended to sever the attorney-client relationship, he never\r\n  clearly did so and he knew Client C and his mother continued to rely on him.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s responses to ODC in Matter C were not timely.Â  \r\nMatter D\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client D in a personal injury matter.Â  Respondent failed to notify\r\n  Client D that he was leaving private practice and that another lawyer would\r\n  represent her.Â  Client D was ultimately represented by another attorney in\r\n  Respondentâ€™s former law firm.Â  At the time formal charges were filed against\r\n  him, Respondent was unable to locate Client Dâ€™s file. Â Respondentâ€™s responses\r\n  to ODC in Matter D were untimely.Â  \r\nMatter E\r\nIn or\r\n  around August 2003, Client E hired Respondent to represent him in a property\r\n  damage case. Â Respondent continued to represent Client E even after he began to\r\n  work at the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Contrary to Client Eâ€™s request, Respondent\r\n  failed to file Client Eâ€™s suit until March 2005.Â Respondentâ€™s response to ODCâ€™s inquiry in Matter E was not timely. \r\nMatter F\r\nRespondent\r\n  represented Client F in a medical malpractice matter and a disability benefits\r\n  claim.Â  After Respondent began working at the solicitorâ€™s office, Client F\r\n  requested his file.Â  Respondent merely told Client F to contact his old firm\r\n  and made no effort to help Client F retrieve his file.Â  Two years after Client\r\n  F filed his complaint with ODC, and at the suggestion of ODC, Respondent\r\n  retrieved Client Fâ€™s file and returned it to him.Â  Respondentâ€™s responses to\r\n  ODCâ€™s inquiries into Matter F were timely.Â  \r\nMatter G\r\nIn November 1998,\r\n  Respondent began to represent Client G in a civil matter.Â  Respondent filed\r\n  suit in magistrateâ€™s court and took the file with him when he began work at the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Respondent did not communicate adequately with Client G\r\n  and, contrary to his specific directions, accepted a settlement offer of\r\n  $500.00.Â  Respondent delivered the entire amount to Client G without deducting\r\n  a fee.Â  Client G signed a release.Â  Respondentâ€™s response to ODC in Matter G\r\n  was timely.Â  \r\n\r\nMatter H\r\nBefore\r\n  and after Respondent left private practice to work at the solicitorâ€™s office,\r\n  he represented Client H in a civil rights matter.Â  The matter was tried and the\r\n  jury rendered a verdict against Client H.Â  Client H requested that Respondent\r\n  turn over his file.Â  Respondent ignored this request.Â  Only after Client H\r\n  filed a complaint with ODC did Respondent attempt to locate the file.Â  The file\r\n  was never found. Â Respondentâ€™s response to ODCâ€™s initial inquiry in Matter H\r\n  was not timely.Â  \r\nMatter I\r\nWhile\r\n  working at the solicitorâ€™s office, Respondent was assigned to the prosecution\r\n  of a defendant whose brother he had represented in private practice.Â  Because\r\n  of this prior relationship, Respondent referred the case to a colleague.Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  the defendant complained to ODC that Respondent had engaged in a conflict of\r\n  interest.Â  The defendantâ€™s complaint in Matter I is without merit; however,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s response to ODCâ€™s initial inquiry in this matter was not timely. \r\nLaw\r\nODC argues that due to the gravity of Respondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct and his disciplinary history, the Panel erred in recommending an\r\n  admonition.Â  ODC argues that Respondentâ€™s actions warrant a harsher sanction.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nRespondent\r\n  stipulated that, by his misconduct, he violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall\r\n  provide competent representation to a client); Rule 1.2 (a lawyer shall abide\r\n  by a clientâ€™s decisions concerning the objectives of representation and shall\r\n  consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be pursued); Rule\r\n  1.3 (a lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\n  representing a client); Rule 1.4 (a lawyer shall reasonably consult with the\r\n  client about the means by which the clientâ€™s objectives are to be accomplished,\r\n  keep the client reasonably informed about the status of the matter, and\r\n  promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.16 (a lawyer\r\n  shall not represent a client under certain circumstances and should those\r\n  circumstances come to light after an attorney-client relationship has been\r\n  established, a lawyer must withdraw from representation in an appropriate\r\n  manner); Rule 3.1 (a lawyer shall not bring or defend a claim unless there is a\r\n  non-frivolous basis in law and fact for doing so); and Rule 8.1 (a lawyer, in\r\n  connection with a disciplinary matter, shall not knowingly fail to respond to a\r\n  lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  Respondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline\r\n  under Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct).Â  Accordingly, we find that a public reprimand is an\r\n  appropriate sanction under these circumstances.Â  Â Â  Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nWe decline to adopt the Panel majorityâ€™s\r\n  recommendation of an admonition due to Respondentâ€™s prior disciplinary history\r\n  and the gravity and cumulative nature of his misconduct.Â  Nonetheless, because\r\n  Respondent recognizes his misconduct and expresses sincere remorse, we hereby\r\n  publicly reprimand Respondent and order him to pay the costs of this action\r\n  within ninety days of the filing of this opinion. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] On July 26, 2000, Respondent received a Letter of\r\n  Caution in a matter unrelated to the complaints before us here.\r\n[2] Respondent was given, but did not timely forward to his\r\n  client, an affidavit of indigence required to be filled out by OAD\r\n  applicants.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26660","title":"In the Matter of Wyatt Breland Willoughby","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26660","description":"This is an opinion publicly reprimanding a lawyer.","date":"2009-06-01","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Wyatt Breland\r\n      Willoughby, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26660\r\nSubmitted May 4, 2009 - Filed June 1, 2009 \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and William C.

Â§ 12-36-90(2)(h),\r\n  allows a taxpayer to take a sales tax credit for those installment contracts on\r\n  which the purchaser fails to make payments and which are consequently charged\r\n  off as bad debts or uncollectible accounts.Â  Pursuant to the statute, Respondents\r\n  seek a refund of sales taxes for installment contracts which became uncollectible\r\n  after Dealer sold them to Finance Company.\r\nRespondents\r\n  contested the South Carolina Department of Revenueâ€™s (SCDOR) ruling that they\r\n  are ineligible for relief under the statute.Â  The Administrative Law Court\r\n  (ALC) ruled for Respondents and the circuit court affirmed.Â  As more fully\r\n  explained below, to qualify under the statute, Dealer and Finance Company must\r\n  constitute one â€œpersonâ€ and one â€œtaxpayerâ€ within the definitions set forth in Title\r\n  12, Chapter 36 of the South Carolina Code, also known as the Sales and Use Tax\r\n  Act.Â  Whether or not the parties together meet these definitions is the\r\n  critical question in the instant case.Â  We find that the parties are not one\r\n  â€œpersonâ€ under the terms of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-30 and so, reverse the\r\n  decision of the circuit court.\r\nFACTS\r\nTimothy\r\n  Brown (Husband) and his wife Noreen (Wife) are the sole shareholders of Dealer\r\n  and Finance Company, which are sub-chapter S corporations doing business in South Carolina.Â  Husband testified that the main purpose for Finance Companyâ€™s existence is\r\n  to take advantage of tax benefits.Â  By selling its contracts to Finance\r\n  Company, Dealer is able to avoid recognizing as income the full amount of the\r\n  contract and can instead recognize only the discounted amount it receives from\r\n  Finance Company.[1]\r\nThe\r\n  sales tax on the purchase of each vehicle sold is included in the installment\r\n  loan contract purchased by Finance Company.Â  Only Dealer has a retail license and\r\n  therefore, must pay sales tax to DOR.Â  Dealer, along with Finance Company, submitted\r\n  a Claim for Refund to DOR.Â  The claimed amount covered 1,731 loans and totaled\r\n  $330,274.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nâ€œThe\r\n  construction of a statute by an agency charged with its administration is\r\n  entitled to the most respectful consideration and should not be overruled\r\n  absent compelling reasons.â€ Â Sloan v. S.C. Bd. of Physical Therapy Examiners,\r\n  370 S.C. 452, 636 S.E.2d 598 (2006).Â  The circuit courtâ€™s scope of review is\r\n  set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-610(C) (2008).Â  On appeal, this Courtâ€™s\r\n  scope of review is the same as that of the circuit court. Â See Brown\r\n    v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health and Environmental Control, 348 S.C. 507, 560 S.E.2d\r\n  410 (2002).\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the circuit court err in finding that Dealer and Finance Company are entitled\r\n  to sales tax relief under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-90(2)(h), also known as the\r\n  â€œbad debt statute?â€\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-90(2)(h) allows for a tax credit for sales tax paid on\r\n  installment contracts that become worthless or uncollectible and are charged\r\n  off as bad debt.[2]Â \r\n  It provides in part:\r\n\r\n\tA taxpayer who pays the tax on the unpaid balance of\r\n  an account which has been found to be worthless and is actually charged off for\r\n  state income tax purposes may take a deduction for the sales price charged off\r\n  as a bad debt or uncollectible account on a return filed pursuant to this\r\n  chapter, except that if an amount charged off is later paid in whole or in part\r\n  to the taxpayer, the amount paid must be included in the first return filed\r\n  after the collection and tax paid.Â  The deduction allowed by this provision\r\n  must be taken within one year of the month the amount was determined to be a\r\n  bad debt or uncollectible account.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-36-90(2)(h) (2008). [3]\r\nThe\r\n  Code defines â€œtaxpayerâ€ as â€œany person liable for taxes under this chapter.â€ Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-40 (2008).Â  The Code further defines â€œpersonâ€ as:\r\n\r\n\tany individual, firm, partnership, limited liability\r\n  company, association, corporation, receiver, trustee, any group or combination\r\n  acting as a unit, the State, any state agency, any instrumentality, authority,\r\n  political subdivision, or municipality.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-30\r\n  (2008).\r\nThough\r\n  the statute does not explicitly say so, the logical reading of Â§ 12-36-90(2)(h)\r\n  is that the same taxpayer who paid the sales tax must be the taxpayer who\r\n  charged the debt off for income tax purposes.Â  To hold otherwise would be to\r\n  render the second part of the bad debt statute meaningless.Â  By providing that\r\n  the taxpayer must include the amount in a return if the amount charged off is\r\n  later repaid, it is apparent that the statute is meant to benefit only\r\n  retailers who suffered financially from a customerâ€™s non-payment.Â  \r\nSince\r\n  Dealer paid the sales tax and Finance Company charged off the bad debt, Dealer\r\n  and Finance Company must together meet the definition of â€œpersonâ€ and\r\n  â€œtaxpayerâ€ in order to meet the terms of the deduction statute.\r\nRespondents\r\n  contend, and the circuit court and ALC agreed, that Dealer and Finance Company\r\n  together constitute a â€œpersonâ€ under Â§ 12-36-30.Â  Therefore, in the view of the\r\n  circuit court, they are together a â€œtaxpayerâ€ as one person liable for sales\r\n  tax and â€œDealer, as a member of this unit, may take a deduction on its sales\r\n  returns for debts that are actually charged off by Finance Company, the second\r\n  member of the taxpayer unit.â€Â  Because we find that the two corporations do not\r\n  constitute one person within the meaning of Â§ 12-36-30, we do not reach Respondentsâ€™\r\n  status as a â€œtaxpayer.â€\r\nA. The Circuit Court erred in finding that Dealer and\r\n  Finance Company together constitute one â€œpersonâ€\r\n\r\n\tAs\r\n  noted above, Â§ 12-36-30 defines a â€œpersonâ€ as follows:\r\n\tany individual, firm, partnership, limited liability\r\n  company, association, corporation, receiver, trustee, any group or combination\r\n  acting as a unit, the State, any state agency, any instrumentality, authority,\r\n  political subdivision, or municipality.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-30\r\n  (2008).\r\nThe\r\n  phrase â€œany group or combination acting as a unitâ€ has not been interpreted by South Carolina courts.Â  Respondents argue that they constitute a â€œunitâ€ because they are\r\n  owned by the same individuals and â€œFinance Companyâ€™s sole reason for existence\r\n  is to purchase Dealerâ€™s installment sales contracts.â€ Â The circuit court agreed\r\n  with Respondents.Â  It found it significant that the previous version of the\r\n  statute read â€œor any other group or combinationâ€ and the word â€œotherâ€ was not\r\n  included in the current version.Â  The circuit court noted that â€œ[h]ad the\r\n  legislature wanted to limit â€˜any group or combination acting as a unitâ€™ to only\r\n  non-incorporated entities, as suggested by the Department, it could have kept\r\n  the word â€˜otherâ€™ in the statute, as in the former version . . . .â€\r\nDOR\r\n  contends that the â€œunitâ€ clause is a catch-all clause and, regardless of the\r\n  presence or absence of the word â€œother,â€ two corporations may not constitute\r\n  one person under the statute. Â We agree with DOR.\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of Kansas considered a similar statute in Pemco, Inc. v.\r\n    Kansas Department of Revenue, 907 P.2d 863 (Kan. 1995).Â  Pemco leased\r\n  construction equipment to its wholly-owned subsidiaries and argued that it did\r\n  not owe sales tax for the leases.Â  The company argued that it and one of its\r\n  subsidiaries constituted a â€œunitâ€ under the definition of â€œperson,â€ which\r\n  provides:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPersonsâ€ means any individual, firm, copartnership,\r\n  joint adventure, association, corporation, estate or trust, receiver or\r\n  trustee, or any group or combination acting as a unit . . . .\r\n\r\nKan. Stat. Ann. Â§ 79-3602(a) (1994 Supp.).Â  The Supreme\r\n  Court of Kansas held that the parent company and subsidiary could not\r\n  constitute a single â€œpersonâ€ under the statute:\r\n\r\n\tNote that the statute is simply defining what a person\r\n  is for purposes of the Act.Â  It first lists the usual types of entities\r\n  recognized at law and then adds, â€œor any group or combination acting as a\r\n  unit.â€Â  There is nothing to indicate an intent that this catch-all phrase was\r\n  intended to alter the status of any of the specifically listed entities.Â  A\r\n  logical interpretation is that it was intended to extend â€œpersonâ€ status to\r\n  groups or combinations acting as a unit even though the group or unit does not\r\n  fit within the legal definition of any of the specifically designated\r\n  entities.Â  Thus, an improperly incorporated corporation could not escape sales\r\n  tax liability by relying on its legal infirmities.Â  Also, tax liability could\r\n  not be avoided by claiming a weird type of group or unit not fitting into a\r\n  standard type of organization.\r\n\r\nPemco, 907 P.2d at 866.\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the reasoning of the court in Pemco in that â€œ[t]here is nothing\r\n  to indicate an intent that this catch-all phrase was intended to alter the\r\n  status of any of the specifically listed entities.â€ Â Id.Â  Dealer and\r\n  Finance Company are each â€œpersonsâ€ within the meaning of Â§ 12-36-30 since each\r\n  is a corporation.Â  To allow the two corporations to present themselves as one\r\n  â€œpersonâ€ by combining to form a unit would be to rewrite the statute. \r\nRespondents argue\r\n  that policy arguments weigh in their favor since, by avoiding application of\r\n  the Â§ 12-36-90(2)(h), â€œthe government keeps money it was never owed.â€Â  We note\r\n  that whether or not sales tax is owed depends on the sale of an item rather\r\n  than the fulfillment of the installment contract. Â See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-36-910 (2008).Â  Thus, Respondentsâ€™ argument is flawed since the Government\r\n  was owed the money at the time of sale.Â  By enacting the â€œbad debt statute,â€\r\n  the General Assembly created a method by which a taxpayer may recoup sales tax\r\n  paid on installment contracts that ultimately prove uncollectible.Â  Respondents\r\n  could have availed themselves of this method if not for their election to\r\n  obtain income tax savings pursuant to IRS regulations.[4]\r\nBecause we find\r\n  that Dealer and Finance Company are bound by their chosen forms, we reverse the\r\n  decision of the circuit court.\r\nB. Finance Company is not entitled to relief under the\r\n  doctrine of assignment\r\nRespondents\r\n  posit as an additional sustaining ground that Finance Company is entitled to\r\n  recoup sales tax based on the doctrine of assignment.Â  We disagree.\r\nDOR\r\n  contends that Respondents did not appeal from adverse rulings by the ALC and\r\n  circuit court on this issue and so, the rulings are the law of the case.Â  We\r\n  note, however, that the successful party in the lower court may raise on appeal\r\n  any additional reasons the appellate court should affirm the lower courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling. Â See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C.\r\n  406, 526 S.E.2d 716 (2000).Â  \r\nExercising our discretion under Iâ€™On and considering the merits of the additional sustaining ground, we find that\r\n  the lower courts correctly held that Finance Company is barred from the refund\r\n  by Â§ 12-60-470(C).Â  â€œA refund of taxes is solely a matter of governmental or\r\n  legislative grace and any person seeking such relief must bring himself clearly\r\n  within the terms of the statute authorizing the same.â€ Â Guaranty Bank &amp;\r\n    Trust Co. v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 254 S.C. 82, 90, 173 S.E.2d 367, 370 (1970).Â \r\n  Section 12-60-470(C)(2) provides that a taxpayer legally liable for the tax may\r\n  assign a refund to another person â€œonly after the taxpayerâ€™s claim is allowed,\r\n  the amount of the refund is finally decided, and the department has approved\r\n  the refund.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-60-470(C)(2) (2008).Â  In the instant case, if\r\n  an assignment occurred, it took place well before the event giving rise to a\r\n  claim for relief under the bad debt statute.Â  In fact, according to Husband,\r\n  the only assignment cited by Respondents occurs almost immediately after the\r\n  customer signs the installment agreement. Â Consequently, any assignment to\r\n  Finance Company cannot meet the requirements of Â§ 12-60-470(C)(2) and therefore, Finance Company is not\r\n  entitled to a refund on this basis.\r\nC. Dealer is not entitled to the tax credit on its own\r\nFinally, Respondents offer as an\r\n  additional sustaining ground the theory that Dealer may be entitled to the tax\r\n  credit on its own based on the idea that it has â€œbad debtâ€ â€œbecause it sells\r\n  its contracts to Finance Company for an amount determined by the historical\r\n  default rate of its customers.â€Â  The lower court declined to reach this\r\n  argument and we find it without merit.Â  According to the â€œAgreement to Purchase\r\n  Automobile Contractsâ€ between the two companies, Dealer assigns all right,\r\n  title, and interest to Finance Company.Â  Dealer therefore, having sold the\r\n  contract, has no bad debt.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding that Dealer and Finance Company together constitute a â€œpersonâ€ under Â§\r\n  12-36-30.Â  The decision of the circuit court is therefore\r\nREVERSED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, BEATTY,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Dealer sells its contracts to Finance Company for an amount determined by the\r\n  historical default rate of its customers.Â  The Internal Revenue Service allows\r\n  Dealer to report this discounted rate as income rather than the full amount of\r\n  the contract.\r\n[2] Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary defines â€œcharge-offâ€ in part as follows: â€œTo treat (an\r\n  account receivable) as a loss or expense because payment is unlikely; to treat\r\n  as bad debt.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 227 (7th ed. 1999).\r\n[3] Section 12-39-90(2)(h) provides relief to a taxpayer in the form of a tax\r\n  deduction on a future tax return.Â  However, the ALC held, and the circuit court\r\n  agreed, that the Dealer may demand a refund of the bad debt credit.Â  DOR notes\r\n  that its argument in this regard was rejected by the circuit court.Â  It has not\r\n  pursued this point on appeal.Â  \r\n[4] In pursuing a tax deduction under the â€œbad debt statute,â€ Dealer seeks to\r\n  benefit twice from defaults on the installment contracts.Â  Dealer testified\r\n  that he paid lower income taxes by selling the contracts to Finance Company for\r\n  an amount less than face value based on the assumption that a certain number of\r\n  the installment contracts would fail.Â  See supra note 1 and\r\n  accompanying text.Â  Now that a number of the installment contracts have failed,\r\n  as predicted, Dealer seeks an additional benefit through the sales tax\r\n  deduction provided by the â€œbad debt statute.â€\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26662","title":"Edwards and Williams v.

Â On May 13, 2009, the General Assembly appropriated the\r\n  ARRA funds, including the SFS funds, in the Budget[2].Â  In Proviso 90.15 of Part IB of the Budget, the General\r\n  Assembly set forth its intention to â€œaccept all available funds from the State Budget\r\n  Stabilization Fund contained within the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act\r\n  of 2009 and to authorize expenditure of such funds as delineated in this act.â€\r\nIn Part III, Section 1 of\r\n  the Budget, the General Assembly requires the Governor and the State\r\n  Superintendent of Education to take all actions necessary and required by the ARRA\r\n  and the U.S. Secretary of Education in order to secure the receipt of the funds\r\n  recognized and authorized for appropriation in the Budget.Â  In accordance with\r\n  the ARRA guidelines, Part III of the Budget requires the Governor to apply for\r\n  the phase one State Fiscal Stabilization funds within five days of the\r\n  effective date of Part III.Â  The Governor is required to apply for the phase\r\n  two funds within thirty days of those funds becoming available.\r\nIn\r\n  addition, on May 14, 2009, pursuant to Â§1607(b) of the ARRA, in an apparent\r\n  response to Governor Sanfordâ€™s public criticism of the ARRA, the General\r\n  Assembly adopted a concurrent resolution[3] to accept the ARRA funds should the Governor fail to accept the funds.Â  Section\r\n  1607(b) provides: â€œIf funds provided to any State in any division of this Act\r\n  are not accepted for use by the Governor, then acceptance by the State\r\n  legislature, by means of the adoption of a concurrent resolution, shall be\r\n  sufficient to provide funding to such State.â€Â  Pursuant to Â§1607(c), entitled â€œDISTRIBUTION,â€\r\n  Congress provides: â€œAfter the adoption of a State\r\n  legislatureâ€™s concurrent resolution, funding to the State will be for\r\n  distribution to local governments, councils of government, public entities, and\r\n  public-private entities within the State either by formula or at the Stateâ€™s\r\n  discretion.â€\r\nGovernor\r\n  Sanford vetoed provisions of the Budget, including the ARRA funds.Â  The General\r\n  Assembly voted to override the vetoes on May 21, 2009.\r\nNotwithstanding his Â§1607(a) certification of the ARRA funds and\r\n  the presence of a lawfully enacted appropriations act, Governor Sanford has\r\n  refused to formally apply for the SFS funds.Â  Governor Sanfordâ€™s refusal to\r\n  comply with state law is based on what he asserts as contrary and controlling\r\n  federal lawâ€”a claim of absolute discretion under the ARRA, specifically\r\n  Â§14005.Â  Although Governor Sanford removed these actions to federal court, the\r\n  matters were remanded to this Court by order dated June 1, 2009.\r\nII.\r\nQUESTIONS PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)\r\n    Does the General Assembly have the authority under South Carolina law to require Governor Sanford to apply for the SFS funds? \r\n    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (2) \r\n    If so, are the provisions of the\r\n  Budget requiring Governor Sanford to apply for the SFS funds in conflict with\r\n  the ARRA?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (3)\r\n    Should this Court grant a writ of\r\n  mandamus to compel Governor Sanford to apply for the SFS funds?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    (4)&nbsp;\r\n    Does the Superintendent of Education\r\n  have the authority to apply for the SFS funds in the Governor&rsquo;s name?\r\n  \r\n\r\nIII.\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA LAW\r\nSeparation of Powers\r\nâ€œIn the government of this State, the\r\n  legislative, executive, and judicial powers of the government shall be forever\r\n  separate and distinct from each other, and no person or persons exercising the\r\n  functions of one of said departments shall assume or discharge the duties of\r\n  any other.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 8.Â  One of the\r\n  prime reasons for separation of powers is the desirability of spreading out the\r\n  authority for the operation of the government to prevent the concentration of\r\n  power in the hands of too few and provide a system of checks and balances.Â  State\r\n    ex rel. McLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. 307, 312, 295 S.E.2d 633, 636\r\n  (1982).Â  Under our system, the legislative department\r\n  makes the laws, the executive department carries the laws into effect, and the\r\n  judicial department interprets and declares the laws.Â  Id. at 312, 295\r\n  S.E.2d at 636.\r\nThe\r\n  General Assembly has the duty and\r\n  authority to appropriate money as necessary for the operation of the agencies\r\n  of government and has the right to specify the conditions under which the\r\n  appropriated monies shall be spent. Â State ex rel.\r\n    Condon v. Hodges, 349 S.C. 232, 244, 562 S.E.2d 623,\r\n  631 (2002); Gilstrap v. S.C. Budget and Control Bd., 310\r\n  S.C. 210, 216, 423 S.E.2d 101, 105 (1992) (noting that the appropriation of\r\n  public funds is a legislative function); Clarke v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth.,\r\n  177 S.C. 427, 437, 181 S.E. 481, 484 (1935) (noting that the General Assembly\r\n  has full authority to make appropriations as it\r\n  deems wise in absence of any specific constitutional prohibition against the\r\n  appropriation).Â  This includes the duty to authorize and/or\r\n  appropriate the use of all federal funds.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-160 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  In the annual appropriations act, the General Assembly must appropriate\r\n  all anticipated federal funds and must include any conditions on the expenditure\r\n  of those funds, consistent with federal laws and regulations.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  2-65-20 (2005). Â Money may be drawn from the treasury only pursuant to\r\n  appropriations made by law.Â  S.C. Const.\r\n  art. X, Â§ 8.Â  An appropriation may be made by the General Assembly in the\r\n  annual appropriations act or in a permanent continuing statute.Â  State v. Cooper, 342\r\n  S.C. 389, 401, 536 S.E.2d 870, 877 (2000).\r\nThe\r\n  Governor is charged with executing the law.Â  S.C. Const.\r\n  art. IV, Â§ 15 (â€œThe Governor shall take care that the laws be faithfully\r\n  executed.â€). Â One of the Governorâ€™s duties is to submit a recommended state\r\n  budget to the General Assembly. S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 11-11-15 (Supp. 2008).Â  The Governor has the\r\n  ability, after the General Assembly has passed a budget, to veto items or\r\n  sections contained within the budget.Â  S.C. Const.\r\n  art. IV, Â§ 21.Â  However, if any item or section of the bill not approved by the\r\n  Governor is overridden by two-thirds of each house of the General Assembly, it\r\n  becomes a part of the law, notwithstanding the objections of the Governor.Â  Id. Â â€œOnce the legislature enacts a law, all that remains is the efficient\r\n  enforcement and execution of that law.â€Â  Knotts v. S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 348\r\n  S.C. 1, 7, 558 S.E.2d 511, 514 (2002).Â  The administration of\r\n  appropriations is a function of the executive department.Â  State ex rel.\r\n    McLeod v. McInnis, 278 S.C. at 314, 295 S.E.2d at 637.Â  Executive\r\n  agencies are required to comply with the General Assemblyâ€™s enactment of a law\r\n  until it has been otherwise declared invalid.Â  Layman v.\r\n    State, 376 S.C. 434, 450, 658 S.E.2d 320,\r\n  328 (2008).\r\nUnder the\r\n  constitution and laws of this State, the General Assembly is the sole entity\r\n  with the power to appropriate funds, including federal funds.Â  Therefore, the\r\n  General Assembly has the authority to mandate that the Governor apply for federal\r\n  funds which it has appropriated.Â  Because the General Assembly has overridden\r\n  the Governorâ€™s vetoes of the provisions of the Budget concerning the SFS funds,\r\n  those provisions are now law and must be executed by the Governor.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  under South Carolina law, Governor Sanford is obligated to take the actions\r\n  required to apply for and accept the SFS funds.Â  \r\nFEDERAL\r\n  LAW\r\nThe ARRA\r\nThe\r\n  question then becomes whether our State law is in conflict with the ARRA.Â  Where a statute is susceptible of two\r\n  constructions, one of which presents grave and doubtful constitutional\r\n  questions, and the other of which avoids those questions, the Courtâ€™s duty is\r\n  to adopt the latter.Â  Jones v. United States, 529\r\n  U.S. 848, 857 (2000).Â  â€œFederal legislation\r\n  threatening to trench on the Statesâ€™ arrangements for conducting their own\r\n  governments should be treated with great skepticism, and read in a way that\r\n  preserves a Stateâ€™s chosen disposition of its own power, in the absence of the\r\n  plain statementâ€ in the language of the legislation of Congressâ€™ intent to\r\n  alter the usual constitutional balance of state and federal powers. Â Nixon v. Mo. Mun. League, 541 U.S. 125, 140 (2004); Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 460-61 (1991).Â  In\r\n  accordance with this rule of statutory construction, we must, if possible,\r\n  construe the ARRA provisions to avoid any conflict between the ARRA and the\r\n  General Assemblyâ€™s mandate that the Governor apply for the SFS funds.\r\nThe primary purpose in construing a\r\n  statute is to ascertain legislative intent.Â  Gordon v.\r\n    Phillips Utils., Inc., 362 S.C. 403, 406, 608 S.E.2d\r\n  425, 427 (2005); Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  In construing a statute, this Court must give effect\r\n  to the will of Congress, and where its will has been expressed in reasonably\r\n  plain terms, that language should be regarded as conclusive.Â  Griffin v. Oceanic\r\n    Contractors, Inc., 458\r\n  U.S. 564, 570 (1982); Consumer Prod. Safety Commâ€™n v. GTE\r\n    Sylvania, Inc., 447 U.S. 102, 108 (1980).\r\nSection 1607 of\r\n  the ARRA provides the methods for a state to certify that it will request ARRA\r\n  funds and use the funds for the purposes set forth in the Act.Â  Under Â§1607(a), a certification must be\r\n  made by the Governor that the State will accept funds provided for in the ARRA\r\n  and use the funds for their intended purposes.Â  Despite the fact that he\r\n  expressed reservations about accepting the SFS funds, it is uncontested that\r\n  Governor Sanford made the certification that the State desired the ARRA funds.\r\nPetitioners in the\r\n  Edwards Action argue Â§1607(b) grants the General Assembly the authority to\r\n  apply for SFS funds if the Governor refuses to do so.Â  In light of the\r\n  Governorâ€™s Â§1607(a) certification, we need not address the substantive\r\n  contention in the Edwards Action that the General Assemblyâ€™s mere compliance\r\n  with Â§1607(b) is sufficient to require SFS funding.Â  We nevertheless construe\r\n  Â§1607(b), especially when read in conjunction with the distribution language of\r\n  Â§1607(c), as evidence of Congressional intent to allow a state legislature a\r\n  meaningful voice in the decisional process.Â  In short, Congressional intent as\r\n  expressed in Â§1607(b) and (c) defeats the Governorâ€™s contention that the ARRA\r\n  unambiguously makes him the sole arbiter of whether South Carolina will accept\r\n  the SFS funds.Â  At best, when Â§14005 is considered, we are confronted with a\r\n  genuinely ambiguous statute.Â  Here, the General Assembly, acting pursuant to Â§1607(b) and (c),\r\n  has expressed South Carolinaâ€™s desire to receive the SFS Funds.\r\nIn Â§14005(a), the\r\n  ARRA provides, â€œ[t]he Governor of a State desiring to receive an allocation\r\n  under section 14001 shall submit an application . . . .â€Â  Similarly, Â§14005(c)\r\n  provides â€œ[t]he Governor of a State seeking a grant . . . shall . . . submit an\r\n  application for consideration.â€\r\nGovernor Sanford\r\n  argues that notwithstanding his Â§1607(a) certification and the Budget, Â§14005\r\n  grants him the sole discretion to determine whether to apply for the SFS funds.Â \r\n  In this regard, Governor Sanford claims the ARRA, as a matter of federal law,\r\n  trumps state law under the Supremacy Clause of the United States Constitution.[4]Â  The Petitioners, the Attorney General, and Superintendent Rex\r\n  argue for a construction of the ARRA that does not create a conflict with\r\n  settled South Carolina separation of powers principles.Â  Accordingly, they\r\n  contend ARRA in general, and Â§14005 in particular, does not grant to the\r\n  Governor exclusive and unfettered discretion to accept or refuse the SFS funds,\r\n  especially at this stage in the process following certification and the provisions\r\n  of the Budget.\r\nGovernor Sanford\r\n  is correct in that Congress may impose conditions on states receiving federal\r\n  funds pursuant to its powers under the Spending Clause.[5]Â  However, limits on this power include the following: the\r\n  conditions must be stated unambiguously, must bear some relationship to the\r\n  purpose of the spending, and cannot require states to engage in\r\n  unconstitutional activities.Â  South Dakota v. Dole, 483 U.S. 203, 207-08 (1987).\r\nCongress clearly\r\n  intended to provide funds to any state desiring to receive those funds.Â \r\n  Sections 1607(b) and (c) evidence Congressâ€™ intent to include the legislatures\r\n  of the states in that decision.Â  However, there is no clear intent in the ARRA\r\n  to give the Governor absolute discretion over whether to apply for funds as a\r\n  condition of the Stateâ€™s receipt of the funds.\r\nThe\r\n  ARRA contains no\r\n  plain statement of Congressâ€™ intention to alter the unquestionable right of a\r\n  state to constitutionally provide for the establishment and operation of its\r\n  government.Â  Further, the action of the General Assembly in requiring Governor\r\n  Sanford to apply for the SFS funds in no way obstructs the purposes of the\r\n  ARRA.Â  To the contrary, the action of the General Assembly promotes the\r\n  purposes of the ARRA.[6]\r\nWe\r\n  accordingly construe the participial phrase â€œdesiring to receive an allocation [or seeking a grant]â€ in\r\n  Â§14005 as modifying the word immediately preceding itâ€”â€œStateâ€â€”to avoid any\r\n  conflict between our State constitutional allocation of power and the ARRA.Â \r\n  With this construction, it is the State which must desire to receive the funds\r\n  and grants, not merely the Governor.Â  The Governor is the officer designated by\r\n  Congress to perform the ministerial act of submitting the Stateâ€™s application\r\n  for the funds.\r\nUnder\r\n  South Carolina law, the General Assembly has the sole authority to direct the\r\n  appropriation of funds and, therefore, is the entity which decides whether the\r\n  State desires to receive the funds.Â  In its appropriation of the SFS funds in\r\n  the Budget and its concurrent resolution, the General Assembly has acted on the\r\n  Governorâ€™s Â§1607(a) certification and expressed the Stateâ€™s desire to receive\r\n  the funds.Â  At this stage in the process, the Governor certainly has no\r\n  discretion to make a contradictory decision on behalf of the State.\r\nWe\r\n  hold the Governor must apply for the SFS funds.\r\nIV.\r\nREMEDY \r\nThe Petitioners in the Edwards Action seek a declaratory judgment\r\n  that Â§1607(b) of the ARRA allows the General Assembly to request, accept, and distribute the SFS funds, which the General Assembly included in the Budget, and that\r\n  Governor Sanford must execute the Budget as enacted by the General Assembly.Â \r\n  While we do agree and declare that Governor Sanford must comply with the Budget\r\n  and promptly submit the ARRA â€œapplicationâ€ referenced in Â§14005, we decline to\r\n  do so as a function of Â§1607(b) and (c). \r\nSCASA requests\r\n  this Court to issue a writ of mandamus to compel Governor Sanford to promptly\r\n  submit the Â§14005 â€œapplicationâ€ and take all legal and necessary steps to\r\n  effectuate the Stateâ€™s receipt of the SFS funds for the purposes as set forth\r\n  by Congress.Â  We hold a writ of mandamus should issue against the Governor\r\n  requiring him to follow the law.\r\nThe Supreme Court has the power to issue writs of mandamus.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 5; S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-3-310 (1976).Â  Mandamus is the highest judicial writ known to the law.Â  Brackenbrook N. Charleston, LP v. County of Charleston, 360 S.C. 390, 400, 602 S.E.2d 39,\r\n  45 (2004).Â  It is a coercive writ which orders a public official\r\n  to perform a ministerial duty.Â  Wilson v. Preston, 378\r\n  S.C. 348, 354, 662 S.E.2d 580, 582 (2008); Ex Parte\r\n    Littlefield, 343 S.C. 212, 222, 540 S.E.2d 81, 86 (2000).Â  \r\nFor a\r\n  writ of mandamus to issue, the following must be shown: (1) a duty of the Respondent\r\n  to perform the act; (2) the ministerial nature of the act; (3) the Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  specific legal right for which discharge of the duty is necessary; and (4) a\r\n  lack of any other legal remedy.Â  Wilson v. Preston, 378 S.C. at 354, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  at 583.Â  A ministerial act or duty is one which a person performs because of a\r\n  legal mandate which is defined with such precision as to leave nothing to the\r\n  exercise of discretion.Â  Id. at 354, 662 S.E.2d at 583.\r\nA writ\r\n  of mandamus may issue against a Governor for the performance of a purely\r\n  ministerial act.Â  Blalock v. Johnston, 180\r\n  S.C. 40, 44, 185 S.E. 51, 52 (1936) (â€œ[W]hen, in the exercise of some official\r\n  power neither political nor essentially governmental, the law specially enjoins\r\n  upon the Governor of the state as a duty the performance of some particular\r\n  act, under circumstances in which he has no discretion, and his refusal to\r\n  perform the act deprives a party of his property or of some legal right,\r\n  mandamus will lie against the Governor to compel the performance of such\r\n  ministerial act, in the absence of other plain, speedy, or adequate remedy at\r\n  law.â€).Â  See also Fowler v.\r\n    Beasley, 322 S.C. 463, 467, 472 S.E.2d 630,\r\n  633 (1996) (noting the Supreme Court has jurisdiction to review\r\n  the ministerial acts of the Governor); Easler v.\r\n    Maybank, 191 S.C. 511, 511, 5 S.E.2d 288,\r\n  289 (1939) (noting that the Governor of South Carolina is\r\n  subject to a writ of mandamus to compel the performance of a purely ministerial\r\n  duty).\r\nThe duty to execute\r\n  the Budget, as properly enacted by the General Assembly, is a ministerial duty\r\n  of the Governor.Â  He has no discretion concerning the appropriation of funds.Â  The application for the SFS funds is a simple, definite\r\n  duty arising under the conditions specified in the ARRA and leaves nothing to\r\n  Governor Sanfordâ€™s discretion.Â  It is a ministerial duty.Â  Because the\r\n  General Assembly, following Governor Sanfordâ€™s certification and request that\r\n  the ARRA â€œfunds be released,â€ included the SFS funds in the Budget and by virtue of its concurrent resolution, the clear intent is the State of South Carolina desires the SFS funds, and Governor Sanford must ask for the funds.\r\nWhile\r\n  we recognize and respect Governor Sanfordâ€™s sincerely held beliefs concerning\r\n  the ARRA, those convictions do not alter the ministerial nature of the legal\r\n  duty now before him.Â  The decision on a request to mandamus the Governor is an extremely\r\n  delicate one, which is undertaken with great reluctance and consciousness of\r\n  its great gravity and importance.Â  Blalock v. Johnston, 180 S.C. at 43,\r\n  185 S.E. at 52.Â  However, when mandamus is warranted, â€œthe judiciary cannot\r\n  properly shrink from its duty.â€Â  Id. at 50, 180 S.E. at 55.\r\nWe\r\n  hold under the circumstances presented that a writ of mandamus is warranted and\r\n  issue a writ of mandamus to compel Governor Sanford to apply for the SFS funds\r\n  and take all legal and necessary steps to effectuate\r\n  the Stateâ€™s receipt of the SFS funds for the purposes as set forth by Congress.\r\nBecause we hold Governor Sanford is required to apply for the SFS\r\n  funds and issue a writ of mandamus ordering him to do so, the Court need not\r\n  reach the question of whether the Superintendent of Education may apply for the\r\n  funds on behalf of the Governor.\r\nV.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nOur\r\n  decision today should not be construed as a comment on the policy differences\r\n  between Governor Sanford and the General Assembly respecting the wisdom or\r\n  necessity of South Carolina accepting the SFS funds.Â  Under our limited role,\r\n  the matter is presented to us as one of statutory construction of the ARRA and\r\n  the application of settled state separation of powers principles.Â  We discharge\r\n  our duty to honor the rule of law, nothing more. \r\nWe issue a writ of mandamus compelling the\r\n  Governor of South Carolina to comply with the law as set forth above. \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of\r\n  2009, Pub.L. 111-5 (2009).\r\n[2] H. 3560, 118th Gen.

I, Â§ 8 , cl.1.\r\n[6] The Governorâ€™s position in this matter is much\r\n  like that of the state of South Dakota in Lawrence County v. Lead-Deadwood\r\n    Sch. Dist., 469 U.S. 256 (1985).Â  The Governor wants to change the purpose\r\n  for which Congress directed the ARRA funds to be used.Â  To that end, he wrote\r\n  President Obama and requested a waiver from the ARRAâ€™s spending purpose so that\r\n  the SFS funds could be used for state debt reduction.Â  The Office of Management\r\n  and Budget denied this request on the grounds that such spending would violate\r\n  the federal act.Â  Similarly, in Lawrence County, the United\r\n  States Supreme Court held that the state of South Dakota could not change the\r\n  purpose for which federal payment in lieu of taxes funds could be utilized.Â  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES,\r\n  CONCURRING:&nbsp; As explained\r\n  below, I would hold that the petitioners in Edwards v. State are\r\n  entitled to the declaratory relief that they seek, and therefore would not\r\n  reach the merits of the issues raised in the South Carolina Association of\r\n    School Administrators case.&nbsp; I do so because I believe that the Edwards case can be resolved without reaching the constitutional issues necessarily\r\ninvolved in the School litigation.\r\nPetitioners Edwards and Williams (petitioners) seek a declaration\r\n  that respondent Sanford (the Governor) must perform the actions required by the\r\n  American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA)[1] to apply for the State Fiscal\r\n  Stabilization (SFS) Funds available under that Act.&nbsp; I would grant the\r\n  requested relief.\r\nIn\r\n  enacting the ARRA, Congress, exercising its authority pursuant to the spending\r\n  clause,[2] provided two methods by which a state could express its desire to receive ARRA\r\n  funds.&nbsp; Section 1607 of the ARRA is entitled &ldquo;ADDITIONAL FUNDING DISTRIBUTION\r\n  AND ASSURANCE OF APPROPRIATE USE OF FUNDS.&rdquo;&nbsp; Under &sect; 1607(a), entitled\r\n  &ldquo;CERTIFICATION BY GOVERNOR,&rdquo; the ARRA provides &ldquo;for funds provided to any State\r\n  or agency thereof, the Governor of the State shall certify that: &nbsp;(1) the State\r\n  will request and use funds provided by this Act&nbsp; . . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; In &sect; 1607(b), entitled\r\n  &ldquo;ACCEPTANCE BY STATE LEGISLATURE,&rdquo; the act provides &ldquo;If funds provided . . . in\r\n  any division of this Act are not accepted for use by the Governor, then\r\n  acceptance by the State legislature, by means of the adoption of a concurrent\r\n  resolution, shall be sufficient to provide funding to such State.&rdquo;&nbsp; As the\r\n  legislative history makes clear, &sect; 1607(b) was included in the ARRA in response\r\n  to suggestions from the Governor that he was averse to accepting federal funds.\r\n&nbsp;Under my reading of the ARRA, either a certification or a\r\n  concurrent resolution is required in order for ARRA funds to be received by a\r\n  state.&nbsp; Section 1607 vests the decision to exercise discretion first in the\r\n  Governor, and then, as to any funds which he chooses not to accept, discretion\r\n  vests in the General Assembly.&nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  Governor did provide a timely letter[3] expressing his intent to accept ARRA funds, and his desire that the letter\r\n  serve as his &sect; 1607(a) certification.&nbsp; In this certification letter, however,\r\n  the Governor stated that he was not applying for the SFS Funds, and expressed\r\n  his &ldquo;reservations about accepting these funds.&rdquo;&nbsp; \r\nIn\r\n  response to the Governor&rsquo;s letter indicating that he was certifying but not\r\n  accepting SFS Funds, the General Assembly exercised the discretion afforded it\r\n  by &sect; 1607(b) and enacted a concurrent resolution accepting the SFS Funds.&nbsp;\r\n  Although the Governor argues that such a resolution does not have the force of\r\n  law in this State, he misapprehends the purpose for which this resolution was\r\n  passed: to exercise the discretion given the General Assembly under federal law\r\n  to accept funds which the Governor had declined.\r\nHere,\r\n  we have a certification from the Governor under &sect; 1607(a) which declines to\r\n  accept the SFS Funds, followed by a concurrent resolution under &sect; 1607(b) by\r\n  which the General Assembly exercised its discretionary power to accept the SFS\r\n  Funds.&nbsp; \r\nThe ARRA further requires that in order to receive SFS Funds, &ldquo;the\r\n  Governor of a State desiring to receive an allocation [of these funds]\r\n  shall submit an application . . . .&rdquo;&nbsp; &sect; 14005 (emphasis supplied).&nbsp; While there\r\n  is some debate as to the proper grammatical construction of this statutory\r\n  phrase, I conclude that &sect; 14005 was drafted to accommodate the two methods, certification\r\n  or concurrent resolution, by which a state can demonstrate that it desires SFS\r\n  Funds.&nbsp; South Carolina has manifested its desire for SFS Funds through the\r\n  concurrent resolution method provided for in &sect; 1607(b). Once a state has\r\n  expressed its desire to receive SFS funds through &sect; 1607, it is my view that\r\n  the state&rsquo;s governor is obligated to obtain those funds by complying with the\r\n  requirements in &sect; 14005. \r\nIf a state expresses its desire to receive ARRA funds through a\r\n  concurrent resolution, &sect; 1607(c) of the ARRA then requires that &ldquo;funding to the\r\n  State will be for distribution to local governments, councils of government,\r\n  public entities, and public-private entities within the State either by formula\r\n  or at the State&rsquo;s discretion.&rdquo;&nbsp; Here, through the adoption of the annual\r\n  appropriations act, the General Assembly has provided for the distribution of\r\n  the SFS Funds and thus has met the mandate of &sect; 1607(c).&nbsp; In short, South Carolina has fulfilled all the requirements set forth in federal law to demonstrate\r\n  that it desires SFS Funds.&nbsp; \r\nThe\r\n  Governor contends that the appropriations act offends the South Carolina Constitution&rsquo;s\r\n  separation of powers clause[4] to the extent it purports to compel him to apply for the SFS Funds.&nbsp; As\r\n  explained above, I read &sect; 1607 to give the governor of a state or, under\r\n  certain circumstances, its legislature, the authority to determine whether a\r\n  state desires ARRA funds.&nbsp; Under my view of the ARRA, the Governor&rsquo;s obligation\r\n  to complete the SFS Funds application process found in &sect; 14005 arises from the\r\n  General Assembly&rsquo;s compliance with the provisions of &sect; 1607(b) and (c), and is\r\n  not based upon the appropriations act itself.&nbsp; The appropriations act is\r\n  relevant to my analysis only to the extent that it fulfills the requirement of\r\n  &sect; 1607(c).&nbsp; I perceive no separation of powers issue here.\r\nPetitioners\r\n  request the Court issue a declaratory judgment that, the General Assembly\r\n  having fulfilled the requirements of &sect; 1607(b) and (c), the Governor and the\r\n  executive branch must perform any and all acts necessary for the State to receive\r\n  SFS Funds from the federal government.&nbsp; I would grant this relief.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Pub.

Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-110, et seq. (Supp. 2008).Â  The Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) issued\r\n  a fine of $100 for each unauthorized procedure for a total of $24,200.\r\nIn\r\n  February 2006, Appellants filed their complaint alleging that they received\r\n  unauthorized TCCs at HHRMC in 1998 or 1999.Â  Appellants asserted claims for\r\n  violations of South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act (SCUTPA), S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 39-5-10, et seq. (Supp. 2008) violations, unjust enrichment,\r\n  battery, and outrage.Â  The complaint also referenced a federal qui tam complaint filed against HHRMC by Dr. Lowman, a doctor formerly employed with\r\n  Respondents, alleging that HHRMC fraudulently billed Medicare as a result of\r\n  performing the unauthorized TCCs.Â  Respondents removed the complaint to\r\n  federal court pursuant to federal question jurisdiction based on the reference\r\n  to the Lowman complaint, but the district court remanded the case to state\r\n  court. \r\nRespondents\r\n  filed a motion to dismiss, and following a hearing, the trial court dismissed\r\n  the complaint in its entirety.Â  The trial court found that it lacked subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction over the case since DHEC was the sole agency empowered with\r\n  authority to resolve claims regarding violations of the CON Act.Â  The trial\r\n  court further ruled that even if it had jurisdiction, Appellants could not\r\n  maintain an unjust enrichment or SCUTPA claim because a private right of action\r\n  did not exist for violations of the CON Act.Â  The trial court dismissed the SCUTPA\r\n  claims on the additional grounds that the claims fell under the regulatory\r\n  exception, the allegations were not capable of repetition, and SCUTPA prohibits\r\n  class action suits.[2]Â  \r\nWe\r\n  certified the case pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and Appellants present the\r\n  following issues[3] for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling that it did not \r\n\t\t\thave subject matter jurisdiction over the case?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in ruling that the CON Act \r\n\t\t\tdid not create a private cause of action?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIII.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in dismissing the SCUTPA claims?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tIV. \r\n\t\t\tDid the trial court err in dismissing \r\n\t\t\tAppellantâ€™s unjust enrichment claim?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nGenerally,\r\n  in considering a motion to dismiss,\r\n  the trial court must base its ruling solely upon the allegations set forth on\r\n  the face of the complaint.Â  Doe\r\n    v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 375\r\n  S.C. 63, 66-67, 651 S.E.2d 305, 307 (2007).Â \r\n  The motion may not be sustained if the facts alleged in the complaint\r\n  and the inferences that can be drawn therefrom would entitle the plaintiff to\r\n  relief under any theory.Â  Id.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Subject Matter\r\n  Jurisdiction\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that the trial court erred in ruling that it did not have subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear the case.Â  We agree.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to\r\n  which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Skinner\r\n    v. Westinghouse Elec. Corp., 380\r\n  S.C. 91, 93, 668 S.E.2d 795, 796 (2008).Â \r\n  South Carolina trial courts are vested with general original jurisdiction in\r\n  civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction\r\n  shall be given to inferior courts.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 11.Â  In determining\r\n  whether the Legislature has given another entity exclusive jurisdiction over a\r\n  case, a court must look to the relevant statute.Â  See Unisys Corp. v. South Carolina Budget and\r\n    Control Bd. Div. of Gen. Servs. Info. Mgmt. Office, 346\r\n  S.C. 158, 175, 551 S.E.2d 263, 273 (2001) (examining the language of the\r\n  statute to determine the legislative intent regarding exclusive jurisdiction).Â  \r\nWe hold that the\r\n  trial court erred in ruling it did not have subject matter jurisdiction over\r\n  this case.Â  Appellants did not file suit\r\n  seeking a determination from the trial court that HHRMC was acting in violation\r\n  of the CON Act.Â  Rather, Appellantsâ€™ suit involved civil claims arising out HHRMCâ€™s\r\n  violations of the CON Act, which DHEC had already determined HHRMC had\r\n  committed.Â  While DHEC has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction to determine\r\n  whether a violation has occurred,[4] it does not have subject matter jurisdiction to hear civil claims\r\n  for damages resulting from those violations.[5] Â Therefore, we hold that the trial courtâ€™s ruling was erroneous. \r\nII. Private Cause of Action\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  that the trial court erred in ruling that the CON Act did not create a private\r\n  cause of action.Â  We disagree.\r\nWhere not expressly\r\n  provided, a private right of action may be created by implication if the\r\n  legislation was enacted for the special benefit of the private party. Â Citizens for Lee County, Inc. v. Lee County, 308 S.C. 23, 28, 416 S.E.2d 641,\r\n  645 (1992).Â  If the overall purpose of the statute is to\r\n  aid society and the public in general, the statute is not enacted for the\r\n  special benefit of a private party.Â  Adkins v. South Carolina Dept. of Corr.,\r\n  360 S.C. 413, 419, 602 S.E.2d 51, 54 (2004). \r\nWe\r\n  hold that no private right of action may be implied from the CON Act.Â  The\r\n  purpose of the Act is:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tto\r\n  promote cost containment, prevent unnecessary duplication of health care\r\n  facilities and services, guide the establishment of health facilities and\r\n  services which will best serve public needs, and ensure that high quality services\r\n  are provided in health facilities in this State.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-7-120\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  In our view, this expressly-stated purpose clearly indicates\r\n  that in enacting the CON Act, the Legislature intended to advance the quality\r\n  of healthcare provided in this State for all people receiving the care, not for\r\n  a particular individual.Â  The fact that the Act considers violations a\r\n  misdemeanor and imposes fines as well as license denial, revocation, or\r\n  suspension further supports the conclusion that the CON Act does not create a\r\n  private cause of action by implication.Â  See Adkins, 360 S.C. at 419,\r\n  602 S.E.2d at 51 (acknowledging that a violation of the Prevailing Wage Statute\r\n  is considered a misdemeanor and thus finding that nothing in the statute\r\n  indicated a legislative intent to create civil liability for a violation).Â  In\r\n  other words, the enforcement mechanism of the CON Act is DHECâ€™s authority to impose\r\n  sanctions and not civil liability. \r\nFor these reasons,\r\n  we hold that the CON Act does not provide a private cause of action for\r\n  violations.\r\nIII. SCUTPA\r\nAppellants argue\r\n  the trial court erred in dismissing their SCUTPA claim.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants filed this suit as a class\r\n  action.Â  Class action suits are representative lawsuits in which a single\r\n  individual or a small group of individuals represent the interests of a larger\r\n  group.Â  SCUTPA, however, prohibits a plaintiff from bringing a suit in a\r\n  representative capacity.Â  See Â§Â§ 39-5-20 and 140 (providing that that\r\n  any person who suffers a loss as a result of an unfair act or practice may\r\n  â€œbring an action individually, but not in a representative capacityâ€). Federal\r\n  courts have recognized that class action suits may not be brought pursuant to\r\n  SCUTPA.Â  See Gunnells v. Healthplan Servs., Inc., 348 F.3d 417 (4th Cir. 2003)\r\n  (impliedly affirming the district courtâ€™s refusal to certify a SCUTPA suit as a\r\n  class action pursuant to Â§ 39-5-140); In re Microsoft Corp.\r\n    Antitrust Litig., 127 F. Supp 2d 702, 727 (D. Md. 2001) (dismissing class\r\n  action claims under SCUTPA because â€œ[t]hat Act does not permit suits for\r\n  damages to be maintained as class actions.â€).Â  Additionally, other\r\n  jurisdictions with a similar provision in their Unfair Trade Practices Acts\r\n  have also reached the conclusion that such a claim may not be maintained as a\r\n  class action suit. See Danielson v. DBM, Inc., No. 1:05-CV-2091-WSD,\r\n  slip op. at 4 (N.D. Ga. August 11, 2005); Morris\r\n    v. Sears, Roebuck and Co., 765 So.2d 419, 421 (La. App. 2000) (recognizing that a\r\n  provision in the Louisiana Unfair Trade Practices Act providing that a\r\n  plaintiff â€œmay bring an action individually but not in a representative\r\n  capacityâ€ expressly prohibits a private class action).Â  Accordingly, because SCUTPA claims may not be maintained\r\n  in a class action law suit, the trial court properly dismissed Appellantsâ€™\r\n  claim.[6]\r\nIV. Unjust Enrichment\r\nFinally, Appellants\r\n  argue the trial court erred in dismissing their unjust enrichment claim.Â  We disagree. \r\n\r\nA\r\n  party may be unjustly enriched when it has and retains benefits or money which\r\n  in justice and equity belong to another.Â  Unjust enrichment is an equitable\r\n  doctrine which permits the recovery of that amount the defendant has been\r\n  unjustly enriched at the expense of the plaintiff.Â  Ellis v. Smith Grading\r\n    and Paving, Inc., 294 S.C. 470, 473, 366 S.E.2d 12, 14 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  \r\nHHRMC\r\n  argues that Hambrick v. GMAC Mortg. Corp., 370 S.C. 118, 634 S.E.2d 5 (Ct. App.\r\n  2006) is directly on point and thus precludes Appellantsâ€™ unjust enrichment\r\n  claim.Â  In Hambrick, the plaintiffs brought several causes of action,\r\n  including an unjust enrichment claim, against GMAC after\r\n  GMAC allegedly engaged in the unauthorized practice of law (UPL) in\r\n  preparing loan documents for the plaintiffs.Â  Citing Linder v. Ins. Claims\r\n    Consultants, Inc., 348 S.C. 477, 483, 560 S.E.2d 612, 616 (2002), the court\r\n  of appeals determined that there was no private right of action for UPL, and\r\n  therefore, held that the trial court properly dismissed the case.Â  \r\nAppellants,\r\n  on the other hand, argue that Hambrick is not controlling and that Inoco v. Jensen Constr. Co., 622 F.2d 1291 (8th Cir. 1980) is instructive.Â  In Inoco,\r\n  Jensen Construction was the lowest bidder on a small-business construction\r\n  contract and Inoco was the next lowest bidder.Â  After the contract was awarded\r\n  to Jensen, Inoco discovered that Jensen falsely certified itself as a\r\n  â€œsmall-businessâ€ under the Small Business Act (SBA) regulations and therefore should\r\n  not have been awarded the bid.Â  Inoco filed an unjust enrichment claim against\r\n  Jensen.Â  The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals held that although no private\r\n  right of action existed under the SBA, the court could look to the SBA to\r\n  determine whether a party has committed fraud or has been unjustly enriched.Â  \r\nIn the\r\n  instant case, we find that HHRMC was undoubtedly unjustly enriched.Â  HHRMC was\r\n  not authorized to perform TCCs, but did so and realized a benefit in the form\r\n  of tremendous revenues and profits from performing these highly lucrative, yet\r\n  unlawful, procedures.Â  Nonetheless, even if we were to hold that Hambrick was not controlling and allow independent actions against a facility that\r\n  violates the CON Act, just as the Inoco court allowed an independent\r\n  action for violations of the SBA, Appellantsâ€™ claim still fails.Â  Whether HHRMC\r\n  was authorized to perform TCCs was irrelevant to Appellantsâ€™ need for the\r\n  procedure, and Appellants would have received the TCCs from another provider\r\n  had HHRMC not administered them.Â  In other words, Appellants have suffered no\r\n  injury even if HHRMC has been unjustly enriched.Â  For these reasons, we must\r\n  affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Appellantsâ€™ unjust enrichment claim.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nOur\r\n  Legislature enacted the CON Act with the purpose of promoting quality\r\n  healthcare to the citizens of South Carolina, and when healthcare facilities\r\n  perform unauthorized medical procedures, they act in direct derogation of this purpose.Â \r\n  This problem is further exacerbated by inadequate penalties that a defiant\r\n  facility receives for violating the Act.Â  While DHEC is authorized to issue\r\n  fines and even though a violation is considered a misdemeanor, such sanctions\r\n  amount to a mere â€œslap on the wristâ€ penalty and provide no meaningful deterrence,\r\n  especially in light of the lucrative and profitable nature of some medical\r\n  procedures.Â  In our view, HHRMCâ€™s actions are no different than an unauthorized\r\n  healthcare provider from a foreign country setting up its operations in South\r\n  Carolina, a scenario which would certainly cause great outrage.Â  Nonetheless,\r\n  we can find nothing in the CON Act implying a private cause of action and\r\n  Appellants cannot show that they were injured as a result of HHRMCâ€™s actions.Â \r\n  Accordingly, we must affirm the trial courtâ€™s dismissal of Appellantsâ€™\r\n  complaint.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Respondents Tenet Physician Services-Hilton Head, Inc. and AMISUB (Hilton\r\n  Head), Inc. own and operate HHRMC.\r\n[2] The trial court also dismissed the battery and outrage claim, but Appellants\r\n  have not appealed these rulings.\r\n[3] Appellants also appeal the trial courtâ€™s ruling regarding recovery of Medicare\r\n  and Medicaid payments.Â  Specifically, the trial court ruled that Appellants lacked\r\n  standing to recover Medicare or Medicaid payments, were judicially estopped\r\n  from seeking such payments, and any such claims were preempted by the federal\r\n  False Claims Act.Â  We decline to address this issue since Appellants contend\r\n  that they are not seeking such payments.\r\n[4] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  44-7-140 (Supp. 2008) (providing that â€œ[DHEC] is designated the\r\n  sole state agency for control and administration of the granting of\r\n  Certificates of Need and licensure of health facilities and other activities\r\n  necessary to be carried out under this article.â€).Â  \r\n[5] Whether the CON Act creates a private cause of action or whether a\r\n  party may maintain an independent civil private cause of action seeking damages\r\n  as a result of CON Act violations, both cases over which a trial court would\r\n  have subject matter jurisdiction and discussed infra, is a distinct\r\n  issue from whether a healthcare facility violated the CON Act, a case over\r\n  which DHEC has exclusive subject matter jurisdiction.Â  See Â§ 44-7-140.\r\n[6] Although the trial court properly dismissed the claim pursuant to SCUTPAâ€™s\r\n  prohibition of class action suits, it erroneously dismissed the claim pursuant\r\n  to the regulatory exception, which provides that SCUTPA does not apply to:\r\n  â€œactions or transactions permitted under laws administered by any regulatory\r\n  body.â€Â  Â§ 39-5-40.Â  This exception exempts an entity from liability where its\r\n  actions are lawful or where it â€œâ€˜does something required by law, or does\r\n  something that would otherwise be a violation of the Act, but which is allowed\r\n  under other statutes or regulations.â€™â€ Ward v.

Code Ann. Regs. 38-414 (Supp. 2008) (requiring heightened insurance\r\n  coverage for â€œmotor carriersâ€).Â  Canal Insurance opposed the request and sought\r\n  a declaration that the $40,000 of combined limits coverage carried on the truck\r\n  was sufficient under South Carolina law.Â  Both parties moved for summary\r\n  judgment.[1]Â \r\n  The circuit court granted summary judgment to Canal Insurance, finding the\r\n  truck driver was not a â€œmotor carrierâ€ under state law and was not subject to\r\n  the insurance requirement of Regulation 38-414.Â  Bovain appeals. Â We reverse\r\n  and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of Bovain.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn September 9,\r\n  2004, Bovainâ€™s wife died after she collided with a logging truck driven by Roy\r\n  R. Greene.Â  Greene was pulling onto Interstate 26 from the side of the road\r\n  when Bovainâ€™s wife struck him from behind.Â  Her car burst into flames and she\r\n  died at the scene.Â  \r\nGreene, who does\r\n  business as Rusty Greene Tree Service, is in the business of hauling cut trees\r\n  to various pulpwood and paper companies.Â  At the time of the accident, Greene\r\n  was picking up logs from a worksite beside Interstate 26 and planned to take\r\n  them to a paper mill in Eastover, South Carolina.Â  Greene had insurance\r\n  coverage on the logging truck with Canal Insurance in a combined single\r\n  liability limit of $40,000.Â  The truck was a ten-wheeler weighing approximately\r\n  26,000 pounds that Greene had purchased used.Â  It had an attachment on the\r\n  front for moving logs.Â  \r\nOn November 4,\r\n  2005, Bovain filed this declaratory judgment action against Canal Insurance asserting\r\n  Greene was a â€œmotor carrierâ€ and seeking to reform the insurance policy to\r\n  increase the coverage to $750,000 pursuant to 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-414.Â \r\n  Under Regulation 38-414, which is applicable to â€œmotor carriers,â€ trucks\r\n  weighing 10,000 or more pounds (GVWR)[2] that carry non-hazardous material must be insured under a policy carrying at\r\n  least $750,000 of coverage.Â  Bovain argued Greene was a motor carrier and thus\r\n  was subject to the increased level of coverage required by Regulation 38-414.Â Â Â  \r\nCanal Insurance\r\n  asserted Greene transported his own property and thus was not a motor carrier.Â \r\n  Canal Insurance further argued that, even if Greene was a motor carrier, he was\r\n  exempt from Regulation 38-414 because he was using his truck to haul cut trees.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-407(4) (Supp. 2008) (providing an exemption\r\n  for â€œ[l]umber haulers engaged in transporting lumber and logs from the forest\r\n  to the shipping points in this Stateâ€).Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  granted summary judgment to Canal Insurance.Â  Bovain appeals, alleging the\r\n  circuit court erred (1)&nbsp;in ruling the insurance policy at issue cannot be\r\n  reformed to increase the limit of coverage to $750,000 pursuant to 23A S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 38-414, (2) in finding Greene was not a â€œmotor carrierâ€ within\r\n  the purview of Regulation 38-414, and (3) in finding that, even if Greene\r\n  qualified as a â€œmotor carrier,â€ he fell within the â€œlumber haulerâ€ exception\r\n  contained in 23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-407(4) and thus was exempt from\r\n  Regulation 38-414â€™s coverage requirement.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nRule 56(c) of the\r\n  South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court may grant a\r\n  motion for summary judgment â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Brockbank v.\r\n    Best Capital Corp.,&nbsp;341 S.C. 372, 378-79, 378, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n  692&nbsp;(2000).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment\r\n  under the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Id. at 379, 534 S.E.2d at 692.Â  \r\n(A)Â  Insurance for Motor\r\n  Carriers Under Regulation 38-414 \r\nBovain first asserts the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding Greene was not a â€œmotor carrierâ€ subject to the increased minimum\r\n  insurance requirements of Regulation 38-414.Â  We agree.\r\nSouth Carolina law\r\n  contains both statutes and regulations governing â€œmotor carriers.â€Â  At issue in\r\n  this case is Regulation 38-414, which provides for heightened insurance requirements\r\n  for certain â€œmotor carriersâ€ for hire as part of a group of Economic\r\n  Regulations.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  Regulation 38-414 provides that â€œ[i]nsurance policies and surety bonds for\r\n  bodily injury and property damage will have limits of liability not less thanâ€\r\n  $750,000 per incident for trucks weighing 10,0000 or more pounds GVWR that\r\n  carry non-hazardous freight.Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-414 (Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  This regulation applies â€œto any person . . . or corporation which is . . .\r\n  engaged as a motor carrier for hire within the State of South Carolinaâ€ unless\r\n  they are otherwise exempted.Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-401 (Supp. 2008).\r\nA â€œcarrier,â€ in the\r\n  legal sense, refers to one who undertakes to transport persons or property from\r\n  place to place.Â  Huckabee Transp. Corp. v. W. Assurance Co., 238 S.C.\r\n  565, 121 S.E.2d 105 (1961); Windham v. Pace, 192 S.C. 271, 6\r\n  S.E.2d 270 (1939).Â  The term â€œmotor carrierâ€ includes â€œboth a common carrier by\r\n  motor vehicle and a contract carrier by motor vehicle.â€Â  23A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 38-402(8) (Supp. 2008).\r\nStatutory law also\r\n  controls motor carriers.Â  Section 58-23-20 provides:Â  â€œNo corporation or person\r\n  . . . may operate a motor vehicle for the transportation of persons or property for compensation on an improved public highway in this Stateâ€ without\r\n  complying with the applicable statutory provisions and the regulations and\r\n  authority of the Public Service Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 58-23-20 (Supp.\r\n  2008) (emphasis added).\r\nâ€œThe term â€˜motor\r\n  vehicle carrierâ€™ [as used in the portion of the Code concerning the regulation\r\n  of motor vehicles for compensation] means every corporation or person . . .\r\n  owning, controlling, operating or managing any motor propelled vehicle . . .\r\n  used in the business of transporting persons or property for compensation over any improved public highway in this State[.]â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  58-23-10(4) (1977) (emphasis added).\r\nThe phrase â€œfor\r\n  compensationâ€ as used in section 58-23-20 â€œmeans a return in money or property\r\n  for transportation of persons or property by motor vehicle over public\r\n  highways, whether paid, received or realized, and shall specifically include\r\n  any profit realized on the delivered price of cargo where title or ownership is\r\n  temporarily vested during transit in the carrier as a subterfuge for the\r\n  purpose of avoiding regulation under this chapter.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;58-23-30 (1977).\r\nIn the case before\r\n  us, the circuit court found Greene was a private carrier, not a motor carrier,\r\n  so he was not subject to the insurance requirements in Regulation 38-414.Â  The\r\n  circuit court found â€œGreene is not a motor carrier for hire because he does not\r\n  transport the property of others for compensation.â€Â  The circuit court stated:Â \r\n  â€œGreene cuts trees, picks up trees that have been cut and abandoned to him by\r\n  other tree services, and hauls and sells those trees to pulpwood and paper\r\n  companies.Â  When he sells the trees, he receives their market value, not a fee\r\n  for handling them as cargo.Â  Greene is transporting and selling his own\r\n  property and is not subject to regulation as a motor carrier for hire.â€Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  stated because Greene is a private carrier, â€œhe is not required to carry a\r\n  certificate of authority issued by the Public Service Commission (PSC) . . . .Â \r\n  Instead, as a private carrier, Greene is governed by the general South Carolina\r\n  Financial Responsibility Act, which, at the time of the collision, only\r\n  required him to maintain minimum liability limits of $15,000/$30,000/$10,000\r\n  or, in this case, combined single limits of $40,000,â€ citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  38-77-140.Â  The circuit court concluded that reformation of the policy issued\r\n  by Canal Insurance to provide the minimum coverage for a motor carrier of\r\n  $750,000 was not appropriate as â€œGreene complied with the law as it applies to private\r\n  carriers.â€Â  \r\nOn appeal, Bovain\r\n  contends the circuit court erred in finding that Greene is not a motor carrier\r\n  subject to the increased limits of coverage in Regulation 38-414.Â  Bovain asserts\r\n  the temporary transfer of ownership of the logs to Greene may not be used to\r\n  avoid application of the limits of coverage in Regulation 38-414.Â  \r\nCanal Insurance, in\r\n  contrast, maintains Greene is not compensated for transporting the wood;\r\n  rather, Greene owns the trees and takes them to the mills of his choice.Â  Canal\r\n  Insurance asserts â€œ[t]he fact that Greene is paid by a timber broker [John\r\n  Frazier] for providing logs to various mills and pulpwood producers does not\r\n  contradict the fact that he is selling the wood as his own property . . . .â€Â  \r\nDuring his deposition\r\n  testimony, Greene testified that, on the date of the accident with Bovainâ€™s\r\n  wife, he had responded to a call from a tree cutting service that was removing\r\n  trees under a contract with the highway department near Interstate 26.Â  Greene\r\n  testified that he was asked to pick up the wood, which he was told â€œwas on I-26\r\n  in between the Lexington hospital and no. 1 exit going toward Charleston.â€Â \r\n  Greene had loaded his truck with cut wood on the side of Interstate 26 and then\r\n  was pulling onto Interstate 26 to take it to a mill in Eastover when the\r\n  collision occurred.Â  \r\nGreene stated he\r\n  had worked with John Frazier for approximately ten years.Â  Greene testified\r\n  that he picks up wood at various locations for himself, but stated, â€œI just\r\n  sell it through Frazier. Â Thatâ€™s how I get rid of it.â€Â  Greene does not charge\r\n  anything for picking up the wood because he plans to sell it.Â  Greene conceded that\r\n  when he took the lumber to the mills, he would not be paid at that time.Â \r\n  Instead, Frazier would pay him based on the amount of wood procured.Â  Greene\r\n  acknowledged that Frazier â€œtells me where I can go with it.â€Â  Greene stated he\r\n  did not talk directly to the mills, but did so only â€œ[t]hrough Frazier.â€Â Â Â  \r\nGreene stated he was\r\n  under Frazierâ€™s workersâ€™ compensation coverage.Â  In addition, Frazier loaned\r\n  him money to purchase his logging trucks, including the one that was involved\r\n  in this accident.Â  Greene stated he purchased the insurance policy with a\r\n  combined single limit of $40,000 as that was the absolute minimum level he\r\n  could acquire based on the truckâ€™s weight.[3]Â  \r\nJohn Frazier, a\r\n  self-identified broker and timber dealer, testified in his deposition that\r\n  Greene would take the wood to the mill, which would then issue a ticket, and\r\n  Greene would bring the ticket to him.Â  Frazier would then take out a percentage\r\n  of the amount for â€œhandlingâ€ and give Greene the remainder.Â  \r\nFrazier\r\n  acknowledged that when Greene brought logs to a mill, the sale price would be\r\n  credited to his [Frazierâ€™s] account, and Greene would bring him the ticket.Â \r\n  Frazier stated he has contracts with the paper companies and they pay him, not\r\n  Greene.Â  Frazier frequently gave â€œadvancesâ€ to Greene, and usually kept about\r\n  ten to twenty percent of the proceeds for being the â€œmiddle manâ€ and then gave\r\n  Greene the remainder.Â  Frazier stated he usually paid Greene and others,\r\n  including loggers (those he subcontracted with to cut the wood) and vendors,\r\n  every Friday.Â  Frazier stated Greene procured virtually all of the wood on his\r\n  own.Â  When asked why Greene did not just sell the wood himself, i.e., why did\r\n  he need him [Frazier], Frazier conceded:Â  â€œHe doesnâ€™t.â€ Â However, Frazier\r\n  explained that the mills like to work with people they know, and he had a\r\n  reputable company with sixty years of experience in the business so they liked\r\n  doing business with him.Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  evidence in the record indicates that Greene sold the logs in the name of John\r\n  Frazier for at least ten years, that the mills paid John Frazier, not Greene,\r\n  and that Frazier directed him as to which mills to sell to.Â  Under these\r\n  circumstances, Frazier is the true seller, and Greene is merely transporting the\r\n  logs for the convenience of Frazier.Â  \r\nThe fact that\r\n  Greene temporarily held title to the logs does not preclude the finding that he\r\n  was being paid to transport materials.Â  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§&nbsp;58-23-30 (1977) (The phrase â€œfor compensationâ€ as used in section\r\n  58-23-20 â€œmeans a return in money or property for transportation of persons or\r\n  property by motor vehicle over public highways, whether paid, received or\r\n  realized, and shall specifically include any profit realized on the delivered\r\n  price of cargo where title or ownership is temporarily vested during transit in\r\n  the carrier as a subterfuge for the purpose of avoiding regulation under this\r\n  chapter.â€).Â  \r\nSince Greene knew\r\n  when he was picking up the logs that he would promptly sell them in the name of\r\n  John Frazier, Greene was merely holding title temporarily until he took the\r\n  logs to the mill.Â  Thus, we conclude Greene was transporting the wood for\r\n  Frazier and hold that he qualifies as a motor carrier under South Carolina\r\n  law.Â  See 13 Am. Jur. 2d Carriers Â§ 5 (2000) (â€œThe nature of a\r\n  carrier is determined by its method of operation.Â  Thus, it has been said that\r\n  a carrierâ€™s status is determined by what it does rather than by what it says it\r\n  does.â€ (footnote omitted)). Â \r\n(B)Â  Exemption for Lumber\r\n  Haulers in Regulation 38-407(4)\r\nBovain next argues\r\n  the circuit court erred in determining that, â€œ[e]ven assuming . . . Greene is a\r\n  â€˜motor vehicle carrierâ€™ for hire, Greene would be exempt from the insurance\r\n  requirements in Title 58 and under the regulations because he is a lumber\r\n  hauler.â€Â  [R 7]Â  Bovain asserts Canal Insurance failed to establish that the\r\n  lumber hauler exemption was applicable here.Â  We agree. Â \r\nRegulation 38-407\r\n  provides for exemptions from the Economic Regulations for certain motor\r\n  carriers.Â  In particular, Regulation 38-407(4) provides an exemption for qualifying\r\n  â€œ[l]umber haulers engaged in transporting lumber and logs from the forest to the shipping points in this State.â€Â  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 38-407(4)\r\n  (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).Â  The phrase â€œfrom the forestâ€ is not defined in\r\n  the regulation.Â  \r\nBovain argued the\r\n  exemption did not apply because Greene was not transporting logs â€œfrom the\r\n  forest,â€ but was, instead, picking up logs left by a tree cutting operation\r\n  that was working in an area along Interstate 26.Â  The circuit court found\r\n  Bovain was â€œreading the exemption in an overly-restrictive mannerâ€ and that\r\n  â€œ[t]his exemption is a â€˜farm to marketâ€™ exemption and applies when an\r\n  individual hauls an agricultural product from the point of production to the\r\n  point of sale.â€Â Â Â  \r\nOn appeal, Bovain\r\n  contends the circuit court interpreted this exemption in a manner that is\r\n  inconsistent with the plain language of the regulation.Â  Bovain asserts Greene\r\n  was not a hauler engaged in transporting logs â€œfrom the forest,â€ and carriers\r\n  such as Greene who regularly utilize the Stateâ€™s highways to carry on their\r\n  business are not entitled to the protection of the â€œfarm-to-marketâ€ exemption,\r\n  which was intended to exempt the infrequent transportation of agricultural\r\n  products to the market, not the almost daily transportation of items for profit\r\n  as done by Greene.Â  \r\nThe burden of\r\n  proving the entitlement to an exemption is on the party asserting the\r\n  exemption.Â  See Ga. Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Jernigan, 305\r\n  S.E.2d 611, 614 (Ga. Ct. App. 1983) (finding a truck owner and its insurer\r\n  failed to meet their burden of showing a pulpwood truck came within the terms\r\n  of an exemption from the general statutory definition of â€œmotor contract\r\n  carrierâ€ where they did not prove the truck was engaged exclusively in the\r\n  transportation of agricultural products from the forest to the mill or other\r\n  place of manufacture).Â  In this case, the burden was on Canal Insurance to\r\n  prove the exemption was applicable, and there was no burden on Bovain in this\r\n  regard.Â  See id. (stating there is no burden on the opposing\r\n  party).\r\nIn general,\r\n  exemptions are an act of legislative grace and, as such, they are to be\r\n  strictly and reasonably construed.Â  See State v. Life Ins.

Â Such a right can never arise by mere implication, and all\r\n  laws granting the exemption are to be most strictly construed.â€ (citation omitted)). \r\nAs noted by one\r\n  treatise, â€œforestâ€ is synonymous with â€œwoods,â€ and in its commonly understood\r\n  sense, refers to an extensive area of land covered by trees:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  term â€œwoodâ€ is often used in the plural, with the same force as in the\r\n  singular, as indicating a large and thick collection of trees. Â It is synonymous with â€œforest,â€ and has been so defined, although the latter term is\r\n  sometimes said to imply a wood of considerable extent.Â  Both terms are broad enough to\r\n  include not only the trees but the land on which they stand.Â  When referring to land, the term\r\n  â€œwoodsâ€ means forest lands in their natural state, as distinguished from lands\r\n  cleared and enclosed for \r\n\r\n\r\ncultivation, and â€œforestâ€ means a tract of\r\n  land covered with trees, or a tract of woodland with or without enclosed\r\n  intervals of open and uncultivated ground. \r\n98 C.J.S. Woods and Forests Â§ 1 (2002) (footnotes omitted).\r\nThe Supreme Court\r\n  of Illinois has also found that â€œ[a] forest is defined as\r\n  a tract of land covered with trees; a wood, usually of considerable extent.â€Â  Forest\r\n    Preserve Dist. v. Jirsa, 168 N.E. 690, 691 (Ill. 1929) (alteration in\r\n  original); see also People v. Long Island R.R. Co., 110 N.Y.S.\r\n  512, 512 (N.Y. App. Div. 1908) (stating â€œ[a] forest is defined as being â€˜a\r\n  tract of land covered with trees; a wood, usually one of considerable extent; a\r\n  tract of woodland with or without [e]nclosed intervals of open and uncultivated\r\n  groundâ€™â€ (citation omitted)). \r\nWe find the\r\n  definitions above persuasive, and believe that the plain meaning of â€œforestâ€ is\r\n  that it commonly refers to an area of land covered with trees, usually of\r\n  considerable extent.Â  The express language of Regulation 38-407(4) exempts\r\n  those hauling lumber from a forest as the point of production.Â  We see\r\n  no reason to deviate from the plain language of the regulation.\r\nCanal Insurance\r\n  submitted an affidavit from David Findlay, the Administrator of the Motor\r\n  Carrier Services Division (MCS) of the South Carolina Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicles, who stated that â€œMCS interprets this regulation broadly as\r\n  applying to persons like Greene who haul cut trees to lumber processors.Â  These\r\n  exemptions are generally referred to as farm-to-market exemptions.â€Â  (Emphasis\r\n  added.)Â  Similarly, Findlay stated that MCS interprets a statute governing the\r\n  transporting of â€œforest products from the farm to the first marketâ€ to be\r\n  applicable â€œto lumber haulers that haul cut trees to sell to pulpwood\r\n  processors regardless of whether the trees are actually obtained from a\r\n    â€˜forest.â€™â€Â  (Emphasis added.)Â  \r\nMCS applies the\r\n  wrong standard of construction as exemptions are to be construed narrowly, not\r\n  broadly.Â  Further, MCS is not responsible for overseeing the Economic\r\n  Regulations.Â  Consequently, its interpretation is not determinative.\r\nBecause Regulation\r\n  38-407 is meant to be a farm-to-market exception, it should apply to areas of\r\n  usual harvesting, not just small areas where trees can be cut.Â  See\r\n    generally 17 Words and Phrases Forestation 43 (Supp. 2008)Â  (citing Cascade\r\n      Floral Prods., Inc. v. Depâ€™t of Labor &amp; Indus., 177 P.3d 124 (Wash. Ct.\r\n  App. 2006), which found that Washingtonâ€™s farm labor contractor act did not\r\n  apply to the brush picking industry as it was not â€œforestationâ€ within the\r\n  meaning of the act because the statutory definition of â€œforestationâ€ required\r\n  cultivation or commercial planting).\r\nA broad\r\n  interpretation of â€œforestâ€ as pertaining to any site where trees are cut would\r\n  eviscerate the language that the exemption applies to those hauling logs â€œfrom\r\n  the forest to the shipping points in this State.â€Â  We do not believe that is a\r\n  reasonable and strict construction of all of the pertinent terms of the\r\n  exemption.Â  The legislature could have easily used broader language and stated\r\n  that anyone hauling lumber or logs is exempted if that were its intent.Â  Cf. State v. Alls,&nbsp;330 S.C. 528, 531, 500 S.E.2d 781,\r\n  782&nbsp;(1998) (stating legislative provisions must be read as a whole and\r\n  sections which are part of the same law should be construed together and each\r\n  given effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction).Â  In this case,\r\n  we conclude Canal Insurance did not meet its burden of establishing that the\r\n  exemption applied here as there was no evidence that Greene was transporting lumber\r\n  and logs â€œfrom the forest to the shipping points in this State.â€Â  \r\nHaving found Greene qualified as a motor carrier, and that he did not\r\n  meet the requirements for exemption as a lumber hauler, we hold the policy\r\n  issued by Canal Insurance should be reformed because it does not conform to the\r\n  legal requirements for coverage as mandated by Regulation 38-414.Â  See Hamrick\r\n    v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins.

Code Ann. Regs. 38-414 (emphasis added).Â  The\r\n  South Carolina Legislature has mandated a level of coverage for larger vehicles\r\n  in order to protect the public from the increased dangers inherent with their\r\n  operation on our stateâ€™s highways.Â  It would be unreasonable to interpret the\r\n  language of Regulation 38-414 differently from the mandated coverage under the\r\n  Financial Responsibility Act, as the potential for catastrophic damage is much\r\n  greater with these larger vehicles.Â  We find insurance carriers have a duty to\r\n  issue policies in accordance with the mandated minimum levels of coverage and\r\n  that reformation of the Canal Insurance policy to provide the mandated minimum level\r\n  of coverage is appropriate.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold Greene is a motor carrier as defined in the South Carolina\r\n  Code and that the exemption from the Economic Regulations for lumber haulers is\r\n  not applicable here.Â  We find insurers have a duty to issue insurance in\r\n  accordance with the mandate of Regulation 38-414 and conclude Bovain is\r\n  entitled to reformation of the Canal Insurance policy to conform to the $750,000\r\n  minimum level of coverage required by Regulation 38-414.Â  Accordingly, we\r\n  reverse and remand for entry of summary judgment in favor of Bovain.\r\n\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, J. and Acting Justice James E.

(â€œKajimaâ€)\r\n  and Petitioner Zurich\r\n  American Insurance Company (â€œZurichâ€) could not transfer liability to Respondent South Carolina Employersâ€™ Fund\r\n  (â€œFundâ€).Â  Hopper v. Terry Hunt Constr., 373 S.C. 475, 646 S.E.2d 162\r\n  (Ct. App. 2007).Â  This Court granted a writ of certiorari to review that\r\n  decision.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nKajima hired Terry Hunt Construction (â€œHuntâ€) as a\r\n  subcontractor to install pipe at a jobsite in Greenwood, South Carolina.Â  On\r\n  February 19, 2004, Claimant Timothy Mark Hopper suffered an injury while\r\n  working for Hunt at the Greenwood jobsite.Â  Hunt had worked for Kajima on a\r\n  previous project and had presented an Acord Form 25-S Certificate of Insurance indicating\r\n  that Hunt had a workersâ€™ compensation policy.Â  The Certificate indicated that\r\n  the policy was effective from May 2, 2002 through December 31, 2002, and the\r\n  block labeled â€œDESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS/ LOCATIONSâ€ on the Certificate provided\r\n  certain â€œWorkers Comp Informationâ€ including the project number, the\r\n  subcontract number, and the claim deductible amount.Â  Before beginning work on\r\n  the Greenwood project, Hunt presented another Certificate to Kajima.Â  This\r\n  Certificate showed that the policy was effective from January 1, 2003 through\r\n  December 31, 2003, but unlike the previous Certificate of Insurance, the\r\nâ€œDESCRIPTION OF \r\n\r\nOPERATIONS/ LOCATIONSâ€ on\r\n  this Certificate was blank.Â  At the time of Claimantâ€™s accident, Hunt did not\r\n  have workersâ€™ compensation insurance, and Kajima therefore remained liable to\r\n  pay benefits.\r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner found that the Claimant suffered a compensable injury, but ruled\r\n  that Kajima and Zurich could\r\n  not shift liability pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2008) because the\r\n  Certificate of Insurance did not indicate that Hunt had coverage in South Carolina.[1]Â \r\n  The full commission adopted the single commissionerâ€™s order in its entirety.Â \r\n  The circuit court reversed and found that there was no evidence that the\r\n  Certificate of Insurance showed that there was coverage only in Georgia and no coverage in South Carolina.Â  The court of appeals reversed the circuit court, and\r\n  held that Petitioners could not transfer liability because substantial evidence\r\n  in the record showed that Kajima did not comply with the requirements of Â§\r\n  42-1-415.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Petitionersâ€™ request for a writ of certiorari to review the court\r\n  of appealsâ€™ decision, and Petitioner presents the following issue for review:\r\n\r\n  Did the\r\n    court of appeals err in holding that Petitioners could not transfer liability\r\n    to the Fund pursuant to Â§ 42-1-415?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nThis Court must affirm the findings of fact made by the full\r\n  commission if they are supported by substantial evidence. Lark v. Bi-Lo,\r\n    Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 136, 276 S.E.2d 304, 307 (1981).Â  However, the\r\n  appellate court may reverse the full commissionâ€™s decision if it is based on an\r\n  error of law.Â  Therrell v.\r\n    Jerryâ€™s Inc., 370 S.C. 22, 26, 633 S.E.2d 893,\r\n894-95 (2006).Â  The issue of\r\n  interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the Court.Â  Catawba Indian Tribe of South Carolina v. State, 372\r\nS.C. 519, 524, 642 S.E.2d 751, 753 (2007).\r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioners argue that the court of appeals erred in holding that\r\n  they could not transfer liability.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, a higher tier contractor is considered the\r\n  statutory-employer of an employee of a lower tier contractor, and thus, the\r\n  high tier contractor remains liable to pay benefits to an employee if he\r\n  sustains a compensable injury.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-400 (Supp. 2008).Â  Section\r\n  42-1-415(A), however, provides a narrow exception to this rule:\r\n\r\n  [U]pon the submission of documentation to the commission that a\r\n    contractor or subcontractor has represented himself to a higher tier\r\n    subcontractor, contractor, or project owner as having workersâ€™ compensation\r\n    insurance at the time the contractor or subcontractor was engaged to perform\r\n    work, the higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner must be\r\n    relieved of any and all liability under this title except as specifically\r\n    provided in this section.\r\n\r\nLiability may only be transferred from the higher tier\r\n  contractor to the Fund after the higher tier contractor has properly documented\r\n  the lower tier contractorâ€™s claim that it retains workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  insurance.Â  See Barton v. Higgs, 381 S.C. 367, 371, 674 S.E.2d 145, 147\r\n  (2009) (holding liability could not be transferred to the Fund where the Certificate\r\n  of Insurance was not signed).Â  \r\nWe find substantial\r\n  evidence in the record to support the commissionâ€™s finding that Kajima failed\r\n  to comply with the requirements of Â§ 42-1-415(A).Â  The Description of Operation\r\n  box on the Certificate of Insurance was left blank and unlike the previous\r\n  Certificate of Insurance that Kajima accepted, this Certificate contained no\r\n  information regarding the coverage that the policy provided, the deductible\r\n  amount, or the project to which the policy applied. In failing to fill out the\r\n  entire Acord Form, Hunt essentially submitted an incomplete document purporting\r\n  to show that it had a workersâ€™ compensation policy, which Kajima accepted.Â  In\r\n  our view, accepting an incomplete Acord Form does not constitute proper\r\n  documentation.Â  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  even if Hunt had submitted a completed Certificate, we find an additional\r\n  sustaining ground in the record to affirm the commissionâ€™s decision.Â  We have held that â€œengaged to perform workâ€ means â€œeach\r\n  time a subcontractor is actually hired to perform work.â€Â  See Hardee v.\r\n    McDowell, 381 S.C. 445, 453, 673 S.E.2d 813, 817 (2009) (explaining the\r\n  definition of â€œengaged to perform workâ€ and overruling South Carolina\r\n    Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) to the extent it was inconsistent with the opinion).Â  In addition to this\r\n  definition, we now hold that the statuteâ€™s language that the â€œsubcontractor has\r\n  represented himself . . . as having workersâ€™ compensation insuranceâ€ in\r\n  conjunction with â€œat the time the contractor or\r\n  subcontractor was engaged to perform workâ€ encompasses a continuous spectrum\r\n  and includes the complete time frame in which the subcontractor is\r\n  engaged to perform the work.Â  In other words, in order to transfer liability to\r\n  the Fund, a general contractor may not rely upon a Certificate reflecting an\r\n  expired policy as documentation of workersâ€™ compensation insurance.[2] Â To interpret the language in the statute otherwise would allow a general\r\n  contractor to turn a blind eye to information which is readily evident upon a\r\n  cursory inspection of the Certificate.Â  Such an interpretation would lead to an\r\n  absurd result not possibly intended by the legislature.Â  See Kiriakides v. United Artists Communications,\r\n    Inc., 312\r\n  S.C. 271, 275, 440 S.E.2d 364, 366 (1994)\r\n  (recognizing that the courts will reject that meaning when\r\n  to accept it would lead to a result so plainly absurd that it could not\r\n  possibly have been intended by the Legislature or would defeat the plain\r\nlegislative intention).\r\nIn the instant case, in an attempt to establish its right to transfer\r\n  liability for an accident occurring on February 19, 2004, Kajima relied on a document\r\n  explicitly providing that the workersâ€™ compensation coverage expired on\r\n  December 31, 2003.Â  Thus, on January 1, 2004 and any time thereafter, Kajima no\r\n  longer had documentation showing that Hunt had workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance at the time Hunt was engaged to perform work.Â  Accordingly,\r\nwe hold that Kajima could thus not transfer liability to the Fund.\r\nSection 42-1-415 is\r\n  a very narrow exception to the general rule that a general contractor, as the\r\n  statutory employer, remains liable to pay benefits if a subcontractorâ€™s\r\n  employee sustains an injury.Â  In order to protect the privilege to transfer\r\n  what would otherwise be the general contractorâ€™s responsibility, the statute\r\n  requires the general contractor to take minimal steps to properly document that\r\n  the subcontractor has workersâ€™ compensation insurance.Â  We hold that an\r\n  incomplete Acord Form does not constitute proper documentation and that a\r\n  general contractor may not rely upon a Certificate showing an expired workersâ€™\r\n  compensation policy to show â€œdocumentationâ€ of the subcontractorâ€™s workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance.Â  Therefore, we uphold the commissionâ€™s order finding\r\n  Kajima could not transfer liability to the Fund.[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm the court of appealsâ€™ decision.\r\nKITTREDGE, J.\r\n  and Acting Justice Timothy M. Cain, concur. PLEICONES, J. dissenting in a\r\n  separate opinion in which WALLER, J.\r\nÂ concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In September 2003, Kajima\r\n  entered a contract with Hunt Construction for work that commenced in November\r\n  2003.Â  Hunt gave Kajima an Acord 25-S Certificate of Liability Insurance\r\n  indicating Hunt had workers compensation coverage through December 31, 2003.Â \r\n  Pursuant to S.C. Reg. 67-415, this form, if issued by the carrier for the\r\n  insured and dated, signed, and issued by an authorized representative of the\r\n  carrier, â€œshall serve as documentation of insuranceâ€ for purposes of S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 42-1-415 (Supp. 2008). See Barton v. Higg,Â  381 S.C. 367,\r\n  674 S.E.2d 145(2009) (majority holds compliance with reg.â€™s four requirements\r\n  are necessary to constitute statutory documentation).Â  Here, the form was\r\n  issued, dated, and signed by an authorized representative and thus met Â§\r\n  42-1-415â€™s documentation requirement.Â  Id.Â  Nothing in either the\r\n  statute or the regulation requires, as would the majority here, that the formâ€™s\r\n  block nominated â€œDESCRIPTION OF OPERATIONS/LOCATIONSâ€ be filled in, nor that\r\n  the form contain coverage information or the amount of the deductible.Â  In my\r\n  opinion, there is no evidence in the record to support the ruling of the Full\r\n  Commission, upheld by the Court of Appeals, that Kajima accepted an incomplete\r\n  form and therefore did not have â€œdocumentation of insuranceâ€Â  â€œat the time the\r\n  contractor or subcontractor was engaged Â to perform workâ€, i.e., in September\r\n  2003.Â  \r\nI also dissent from\r\n  the additional sustaining ground found by the majority.Â  Section 42-1-415 (A)\r\n  provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n  Notwithstanding\r\n    any other provision of law, upon the submission of documentation to the\r\n    commission that a contractor or subcontractor has represented himself to a\r\n    higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner as having workersâ€™\r\n    compensation insurance at the time the contractor or subcontractor was engaged\r\n    to perform work, the higher tier subcontractor, contractor, or project owner\r\n    must be relieved of any and all liability under this title except as\r\n    specifically provided in this section.\r\n\r\nThe statute only requires\r\n  that the lower tier contractor represented himself as having workersâ€™\r\n  compensation insurance (not that it actually has such coverage) â€œat the time\r\n  the contractor or subcontractor was engaged to perform work.â€Â Â  The majority\r\n  interprets that term to mean that the general contractor is under a continuing\r\n  duty to assure itself of coverage during â€œthe complete time frame in which the\r\n  subcontractor is engaged to perform the work.â€Â  I disagree.\r\nIn South\r\n  Carolina Uninsured Employerâ€™s Fund v. House, 360 S.C. 468, 602 S.E.2d 81\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004) modified on other grounds Hardee v. McDowell, 381\r\n  S.C. 445, 673 S.E.2d 813(2009), the Court of Appeals held that Â§ 42-1-415 does\r\n  not require the general contractor to continue to collect proof of insurance\r\n  after the initial documentation. As Judge Stilwell wrote for the court:\r\n\r\n  We are\r\n    loath to read such a requirement into a statute that otherwise contains such\r\n    straightforward language.\r\n  Subsection\r\n    (C) of section 42-1-415 is directed toward the subcontractor, places upon it\r\n    the duty to notify the higher-tier contractor of any lapse in coverage, and\r\n    sets forth the consequences of the subcontractorâ€™s failure to do so when it\r\n    provides, in relevant part:\r\n  \r\n    Knowing and willful failure to notify, by\r\n      certified mail, the higher tierâ€¦contractorâ€¦who originally was provided\r\n      documentation of workersâ€™ compensation coverage of a lapse in coverage within\r\n      five days after the lapse is considered fraud and subjects theâ€¦subcontractor\r\n      who represented himself as having workersâ€™ compensation insurance to the\r\n      penalties for fraud provided by law.\r\n    S.C.\r\n      Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-415(C).\r\n  \r\n  The use\r\n    in subsection (C) of the word â€œoriginallyâ€ lends support to the reasoning that\r\n    the information given at the inception of the engagement is the controlling\r\n    factor, negating any statutory requirement on the part of the higher-tier contractor\r\n    to continue collection proof of insurance.\r\n  House, 360 S.C. at 472, 602 S.E.2d at 83.\r\n\r\nI\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals in House and would hold that Kajima is\r\n  relieved of liability under Â§ 42-1-415 because it received an Acord form which\r\n  complied with the regulatory requirements of Reg. 67-415 at the time Hunt was\r\n  engaged to perform the work.\r\nFor\r\n  the reasons given above, I respectfully dissent.\r\nWALLER,\r\nJ., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The single commissioner found that the Certificate of Insurance reflected a Georgia workersâ€™ compensation policy and that the Certificate did not indicate that the\r\npolicy had an all-states endorsement.\r\n[2] In our view, the plain language of Â§ 42-1-415(A) is\r\n  clear that a subcontractor must represent that he has workersâ€™ compensation coverage\r\n  while he is engaged to perform work.Â  Therefore, we disagree with the dissent\r\n  in looking to section Â§ 42-1-415(C) to clarify Â§ 42-1-415(A).Â  \r\n[3] Although the commission found that Petitioners could not transfer liability\r\n  based on a separate reason, we may affirm the commissionâ€™s decision for any\r\nground appearing in the record.Â  See Rule 220(c), SCACR. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26666","title":"McCrosson v.

Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-10 to -220 (Supp. 2008).Â  We hold the statute of repose\r\n  applies.\r\nThis\r\n  Court previously held, â€œthe six-year repose provision in [section] 15-3-545 â€˜constitutes an outer limit beyond which a medical\r\n  malpractice claim is barred, regardless of\r\n  whether it has or should have been discovered.â€™â€Â  Harrison v. Bevilacqua, 354 S.C. 129,\r\n    137-38, 580 S.E.2d 109, 113 (2003) (quoting Hoffman v. Powell,\r\n  298 S.C. 338, 339-40, 380 S.E.2d 821, 821 (1989)).Â  In Harrison, this\r\n  Court rejected the continuous treatment rule as such a rule would â€œrun afoul of\r\n  the absolute limitations policy the Legislature has clearly set . . . .â€Â  354\r\n  S.C. at 138, 580 S.E.2d at 114.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  section 15-3-545(A), which has not been amended since Harrison, states:\r\n\r\n  In\r\n    any action, . . . to recover\r\n    damages for injury to the person arising out of any medical . . . treatment . .\r\n    . by any licensed health care provider . . . acting within the scope of his\r\n    profession must be commenced within three years from the date of the treatment,\r\n    omission, or operation giving rise to the cause of action or three years from\r\n    date of discovery or when it reasonably ought to have been discovered, not\r\n      to exceed six years from date of occurrence, or as tolled by this section.\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â \r\n  Accordingly, the statute of repose provision within section 15-3-545(A) applies\r\n  as an absolute outer limit applicable in any medical malpractice action.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the statute of repose portion of section 15-3-545(A) is substantive law, unlike\r\n  a statute of limitations, which is procedural law.Â  Capco of Summerville,\r\n    Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Const. Co., Inc., 368 S.C. 137, 142, 628 S.E.2d 38, 41\r\n  (2006) (â€œA statute of limitations is a procedural device that operates as a\r\n  defense to limit the remedy available from an existing cause of action. Â A\r\n  statute of repose creates a substantive right in those protected to be free\r\n  from liability after a legislatively determined period of time.â€).Â  Further,\r\n  when the Legislature enacted the Tort Claims Act, the Legislature knew of the absolute\r\n  time limit imposed by the statue of repose.Â  Berkebile v. Outen, 311\r\n  S.C. 50, 53, 426 S.E.2d 760, 762 (1993) (citation omitted) (â€œA basic\r\n  presumption exists that the legislature has knowledge of previous legislation\r\n  when later statutes are passed on a related subject.â€).\r\nNext,\r\n  we turn to the Tort Claims Act itself.Â  â€œThe primary rule of statutory\r\n  construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the\r\n  legislature.â€Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324\r\n  S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996) (citation omitted).Â  The General\r\n  Assembly indicated its intent in the Tort Claims Act by stating, â€œ[t]he provisions of this chapter establishing limitations on and\r\n  exemptions to the liability of the State, its political subdivisions, and employees,\r\n  while acting within the scope of official duty, must be liberally construed in\r\n  favor of limiting the liability of the State.â€Â  S.C. Code\r\n    Ann. Â§ 15-78-20(f) (2005).\r\nWhen reading the Tort Claims Act as a whole, which we must, we\r\n  hold the above unambiguous expression of intent pervades the entire act.Â  Mid-State Auto, 324 S.C. at 69, 476 S.E.2d at\r\n  692 (â€œIn ascertaining the intent of the\r\n  legislature, a court should not focus on any single section or provision but\r\n  should consider the language of the statute as a whole.â€).Â  Specifically,\r\n  section 15-78-40 of the South Carolina Code (2005) states, â€œ[t]he State, an agency, a political subdivision, and a governmental\r\n  entity are liable for their torts in the same manner and to the same extent as\r\n  a private individual under like circumstances, subject to the limitations upon\r\n  liability and damages, and exemptions from liability and damages, contained\r\n  herein.â€Â  Similarly, section\r\n  15-78-50(b) of the South Carolina Code (2005) provides, â€œ[i]n no\r\n  case is a governmental entity liable for a tort of an employee where that\r\n  employee, if a private person, would not be liable under the laws of this\r\n  State.â€Â  Accordingly, the Legislature clearly intended to limit government\r\n  liability through the Tort Claims Act, and at no time did the Legislature intend\r\n  government liability to exceed that of a private entity.\r\nConversely, Kerr is inviting this Court to contravene the\r\n  unambiguous intent of the Legislature and expand liability for a government\r\n  hospital beyond a private hospitalâ€™s potential liability.Â  In fact, Kerrâ€™s\r\n  counsel conceded the statute of repose bar in a private action when stating,\r\n  â€œby the time this client came to see me, [the estate] had clearly lost [its]\r\n  right under [section] 15-3-545(A), the right to pursue any private entity because of the\r\n  medical malpractice statute of repose.Â  Six years had transpired.â€Â  To permit\r\n  this medical malpractice action to proceed beyond the statute of repose would\r\n  be to disregard the Tort Claims Act, particularly sections 15-78-40 and 15-78-50(b).\r\nHaving\r\n  found Hospital was entitled to summary judgment based on the statute of repose,\r\n  we need not reach the additional ground relied upon by the trial court. Â Wilson v. Moseley, 327 S.C. 144, 147, 488 S.E.2d 862, 864 (1997) (holding if one ground\r\n  proves dispositive, then this Court need not address the remaining grounds\r\nrelied on by a trial court when it granted summary judgment).\r\n\r\nIII.\r\nAs the six-year\r\n  statute of repose in section 15-3-545(A) applies\r\n  as an absolute outer limit applicable in any medical malpractice, the\r\n  grant of summary judgment to the Hospital is \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, ACTING CHIEF JUSTICE, PLEICONES, BEATTY JJ., and Acting\r\n  Justice James E.

Barone, both of Motley Rice, LLC, of Mount Pleasant, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  In this case, the circuit\r\n  court denied Appellantsâ€™ motion to enforce arbitration on the grounds that the\r\n  designated arbitrator had become unavailable and that the unavailability voided\r\n  the arbitration agreement.Â  Appellants appealed, and we certified this case\r\n  pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nRespondent\r\n  James O. Grant (â€œRespondentâ€) is the surviving husband of Lessie Mae P. Grant\r\n  (â€œGrantâ€) and the personal representative of her estate.Â  On December 4, 2003,\r\n  at the age of 72, Grant was admitted to the Magnolia Manor-Greenwood nursing\r\n  home.Â  Upon admission, Respondent executed an admission contract as a\r\n  â€œfiduciary partyâ€ on behalf of Grant, who was unable to sign the contract\r\n  herself.Â  The admission contract contained an arbitration provision, which\r\n  states as follows:\r\nVI:Â  Arbitration\r\n\r\n  Pursuant\r\n    to the Federal Arbitration Act, any action, dispute, claim, or controversy of\r\n    any kind (e.g., whether in contract or in tort, statutory or common law,\r\n    legal or equitable, or otherwise) now existing or hereafter arising between the\r\n    parties in any way arising out of, pertaining to or in connection with the\r\n    provision of health care services, any agreement between the parties, the\r\n    provision of any other goods or service by the Health Care Center or other\r\n    transactions, contracts or agreements of any kind whatsoever, any past,\r\n    present, or future incidents, omission, acts errors, practices, or occurrence\r\n    causing injury to either party whereby the other party or its agents, employees\r\n    or representatives may be liable, in whole or in part, or any other aspect of\r\n    the past, present, or future relationships between the parties shall be\r\n    resolved by binding arbitration administered by the National Health Lawyers\r\n    Association (the â€œNHLAâ€).[1] \r\n\r\nOn\r\n  January 1, 2004, the AHLA amended its rules for arbitrating health care\r\n  liability claims.Â  Under the new rules, the AHLA would only arbitrate claims\r\n  pursuant to arbitration agreements entered into after the alleged injury\r\n  occurred.Â  The parties did not modify the admission contract to reflect the\r\n  AHLA policy change.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 11, 2005, Grant fell and sustained a large hematoma above her left\r\n  eye.Â  Five days later, Grant died as a result of this injury.Â  Respondent\r\n  instituted this action against Appellants for survival, wrongful death, and\r\n  loss of consortium.Â  \r\nAppellants\r\n  filed a motion to enforce arbitration and stay the proceedings.Â  Respondent\r\n  contested Appellantsâ€™ motion on the grounds that the AHLA no longer arbitrated\r\n  personal injury claims arising under pre-injury arbitration agreements and that\r\n  the arbitration clause was therefore unenforceable.Â  Appellants argued in reply\r\n  that Section 5 of the Federal Arbitration Act (â€œFAAâ€) allowed for the\r\n  appointment of a replacement arbitrator when the designated arbitrator became\r\n  unavailable.Â  Following oral arguments, the circuit court entered an order\r\n  denying Appellantsâ€™ motion to enforce arbitration and stay the proceedings.Â  In\r\n  reviewing the arbitration agreement, the circuit court found that the AHLA had\r\n  become unavailable as an arbitrator, found that the designation of the AHLA as\r\n  arbitrator was a material term of the agreement, and declined to appoint a new\r\n  arbitrator because â€œthere would no longer be a meeting of the minds between the\r\n  parties.â€Â  Appellants present the following questions for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the circuit court err in\r\n  finding the arbitration agreement void and unenforceable because of the\r\n  unavailability of the designated arbitrator?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in\r\n  failing to appoint a substitute arbitrator or in failing to allow the parties\r\n  to consent to a substitute arbitrator in accordance with Section 5 of the\r\n  Federal Arbitration Act?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDeterminations of arbitrability are\r\n  subject to de novo review.Â  Stokes v. Metropolitan Life Ins. Co.,\r\n  351 S.C. 606, 609, 571 S.E.2d 711, 713 (Ct. App. 2002).Â  However, the circuit\r\n  courtâ€™s factual findings will not\r\n  be overruled if there is any evidence reasonably supporting them. Â Liberty\r\n    Builders, Inc. v. Horton, 336 S.C. 658, 664-665, 521 S.E.2d 749, 753 (Ct. App.\r\n  1999).\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that the circuit court erred in denying their motion to enforce\r\n  arbitration due to the AHLAâ€™s unavailability to act as arbitrator. Â We disagree.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  observe at the outset that it is the policy of this state to favor the\r\n  arbitration of disputes.Â  Tolerâ€™s Cove Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc. v. Trident\r\n    Const. Co., Inc., 355 S.C. 506, 612, 583 S.E.2d 581, 585 (2003).Â  Accordingly, any doubts concerning the\r\n  scope of arbitrable issues should be resolved in favor of arbitration. Â Zabinski\r\n    v. Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 597, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118 (2001).Â  A\r\n  motion to compel arbitration made pursuant to an arbitration clause in a\r\n  written contract should only be denied where the clause is not susceptible to\r\n  any interpretation which would cover the\r\n  asserted dispute.Â  Id. at 597, 553 S.E.2d at 118-119.Â  \r\nNevertheless, arbitration is a matter\r\n  of contract, and our evaluation of the enforceability of an arbitration\r\n  agreement is guided by general principles of contract law.Â  Munoz v. Green\r\n    Tree Fin. Corp., 343 S.C. 531, 538, 542 S.E.2d 360, 364 (2001).Â  The\r\n  parties to an arbitration agreement are at liberty to choose the terms under\r\n  which they will arbitrate.Â  Dowling v. Home Buyers Warranty Corp., II,\r\n  311 S.C. 233, 236, 428 S.E.2d 709, 710 (1993).Â  In order to have a valid and\r\n  enforceable contract, there must be a meeting of the minds between the parties\r\n  with regard to all essential and material terms of the contract.Â  Player v. Chandler, 299 S.C. 101, 105, 382 S.E.2d 891 (1989).Â  \r\nThe partiesâ€™ arbitration agreement provides that the arbitration\r\n  shall be administered pursuant to the FAA.Â  Section\r\n  5 of the FAA states in part:\r\n\r\n  If in\r\n    the agreement provision be made for a method of naming or appointing an\r\n    arbitrator or arbitrators or an umpire, such method shall be followed; but if\r\n    no method be provided therein, or if a method be provided and any party thereto\r\n    shall fail to avail himself of such method, or if for any other reason there\r\n    shall be a lapse in the naming of an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire, or in\r\n    filling a vacancy, then upon the application of either party to the controversy\r\n    the court shall designate and appoint an arbitrator or arbitrators or umpire,\r\n    as the case may require, who shall act under the said agreement with the same\r\n    force and effect as if he or they had been specifically named therein . . . .\r\n\r\n9 U.S.C. Â§ 5 (2007). Â \r\nAppellants\r\n  argue that the unavailability of AHLA has created a â€œlapseÂ  . . . in filling a vacancyâ€\r\n  that Section 5 was designed to remedy.Â  We disagree.\r\nThere is a dispute in the case law as to whether Section 5 applies in cases where, as here, the parties have specified an exclusive\r\n  arbitral forum, but that forum is no longer available.Â  Some courts,\r\n  particularly the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, have\r\n  held that Section 5 does not apply in such instances.Â  See In re Salomon Inc. Sâ€™holdersâ€™ Derivative Litig., 68 F.3d 554, 560 (2d Cir. 1995) (defining the term â€œlapseâ€ in\r\n  Section 5 to mean â€œa lapse in time in the naming of the arbitrator or in the\r\n  filling of a vacancy on a panel of arbitrators, or some other mechanical\r\n  breakdown in the arbitrator selection processâ€ and holding that Section 5 is therefore\r\n  inapplicable to cases where the specifically designated arbitrator becomes\r\n  unavailable); Â Dover Ltd. v. A.B. Watley, Inc., No. 04-7366, 2006 WL 2987054, *6 (S.D. N.Y Oct. 18, 2006) (recognizing\r\n  that â€œSection 5 . . . is inapplicable when the parties\r\n  have specified an exclusive arbitral forum, but that forum is no longer\r\n  availableâ€).Â  \r\nOther jurisdictions have interpreted Section 5 so as to generally\r\n  allow for the appointment of new arbitrators when the named arbitrator could\r\n  not or would not proceed.Â  See Ex parte Warren, 718 So.2d 45, 48 (Ala. 1998) (expressing the general rule that, â€œwhere the\r\n  arbitrator named in the arbitration agreement cannot or will not arbitrate the\r\n  dispute, a court does not void the agreement but instead appoints a different arbitrator.â€); Zechman v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &amp; Smith, Inc., 742 F.Supp. 1359, 1364 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (same).Â  However,\r\n  these cases have also identified an exception to this rule, which provides that\r\n  â€œ[o]nly if the choice of forum is an integral part of the\r\n  agreement to arbitrate, rather than an â€˜ancillary logistical concernâ€™ will the\r\n  failure of the chosen forum preclude arbitration.â€ Â Brown v. ITT Consumer\r\n    Fin. Corp., 211 F.3d 1217, 1220 (11th\r\n  Cir. 2000). Â Importantly, â€œ[n]one of these cases . .\r\n  . stand for the proposition that district courts may use Â§ 5 to circumvent the partiesâ€™ designation of an exclusive\r\n  arbitral forum.â€Â  In re Salomon Inc., 68 F.3d at 561.\r\nWe see great merit in the Second Circuitâ€™s view that Section 5\r\n  does not apply in cases where a specifically designated arbitrator becomes\r\n  unavailable.Â  However, we may assume without deciding that Section 5 applies in\r\n  the present case and reach the same result because, in our view, the specific designation of\r\n  the AHLA as arbitrator is an integral term of this arbitration agreement.\r\nTo determine whether a named arbitrator is an integral part of the\r\n  agreement or an ancillary logistical concern, courts look to the â€œessenceâ€ of\r\n  the arbitration agreement. Â Warren, 718\r\n  So.2d at 49 (citingZechman, 742 F.Supp. at 1364).Â  Under\r\n  the AHLA policy, the parties may not vary the rules on communications, service,\r\n  counting of days, publication and form of the award, release of documents, or\r\n  administration.Â  The parties are bound by a panel of arbitrators selected by\r\n  the service.Â  In our view, the partiesâ€™ waiver of this set of rights in\r\n  agreeing to arbitrate before the AHLA reflects their specific intent to\r\n  arbitrate exclusively before that body.Â  Furthermore, the designation of\r\n  a forum such as the AHLA â€œhas wide-ranging substantive implications that may\r\n  affect, inter alia, the arbitrator-selection process, the law,\r\n  procedures, and rules that govern the arbitration, the enforcement of the\r\n  arbitral award, and the cost of the arbitration.â€Â  Singleton v. Grade A\r\n    Market, Inc., No. 08-1385, 2009 WL 996015, *6 (D. Conn. April 13, 2009). Â Where\r\n  designation of a specific arbitral forum has implications that may\r\n  substantially affect the\r\n  substantive outcome of the resolution, we believe that it is neither\r\n  â€œlogisticalâ€ nor â€œancillary.â€Â  See Smith Barney, Inc. v. Critical Health Systems of North\r\n    Carolina, Inc., 212 F.3d 858, 862 (4th Cir. 2000) (â€œIt is far better to interpret the\r\n  agreement based on what is specified, rather than attempt to incorporate other\r\n  remote rules by reference.â€); Wall\r\n    Street Associates v. Becker Paribas, Inc. 818 F.Supp. 679, 683 (S.D. N.Y. 1993), affd. 27 F.3d 845 (2d Cir. 1994) (â€œ[A]n agreement to arbitrate before a particular forum is\r\n  as integral a term of a contract as any other, which courts must enforce.â€).Â \r\n  Accordingly, we hold that the arbitration agreement is unenforceable and that\r\n  the circuit court did not err in refusing to appoint a substitute arbitrator\r\n  pursuant to Section 5.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we affirm the judgment of the circuit court and remand for further\r\n  proceedings. \r\nWALLER, BEATTY\r\nand KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-54-44(B)(3) (2000).Â  On October 8, 2008, he was sentenced to eight (8)\r\n  months imprisonment and a fine of $1,000, provided that, upon payment of $500\r\n  plus costs and restitution in the amount of $8,410, the balance was suspended\r\n  upon service of one (1) year of probation.Â  On May 6, 2009, a circuit court\r\n  judge found respondent had violated several conditions of his probation, continued\r\n  respondentâ€™s probation until October 7, 2013, and reduced the restitution\r\n  payments to $50.00 per month beginning June 8, 2009.Â  Respondent has been\r\n  cooperative and forthright with ODC throughout its investigationÂ Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline pursuant to Rule\r\n  7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for\r\n  discipline for a lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any\r\n  other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers) and\r\n  Rule 7(a)(4) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to be convicted\r\n  of crime of moral turpitude or serious crime).Â  Further, he admits he has\r\n  violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, specifically Rule\r\n  8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct), Rule 8.4(b) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to commit a\r\n    criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness,\r\n    or fitness as a lawyer in other respects), and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n    misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the\r\n    administration of justice).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a ninety\r\n  (90) day period.Â  Respondent shall fulfill all obligations of his sentence,\r\n  including probation and payment of restitution, before he may file a Petition\r\n  for Reinstatement under Rule 32, RLDE.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26670","title":"In the Matter of Marvin Lee Robertson, Jr.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26670","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court disbarred a lawyer.","date":"2009-06-15","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        In the Matter of Marvin Lee\r\n          Robertson, Jr.,&nbsp; Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26670\r\nSubmitted May 19, 2009 - Filed June 15, 2009\r\n\r\nDISBARRED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Lesley M.\r\n          Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and William C.

and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to\r\n  disbarment pursuant to Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In addition,\r\n  respondent agrees to pay full restitution to clients, banks, and other persons\r\n  and entities who have incurred losses as a result of his misconduct and to\r\n  reimburse the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) and ODC for costs\r\n  incurred in this matter.Â  We accept the agreement and disbar respondent from\r\n  the practice of law in this state.Â  Further, respondent shall pay full\r\n  restitution to clients, banks, and other persons and entities who have incurred\r\n  losses as a result of his misconduct and reimburse the Commission and ODC for\r\n  costs incurred in this matter.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are\r\n  as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he failed to close this case and disburse the clientâ€™s share of the\r\n  funds for a period of approximately eighteen (18) months after receiving the\r\n  settlement proceeds.Â  He further admits he did not safeguard the clientâ€™s funds\r\n  and that the funds were not available on deposit in his trust account for at\r\n  least the last twelve (12) months prior to disbursement.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he closed the real estate transaction in this matter but did not make\r\n  the first mortgage payoff of $350,366.10 as shown on the closing statement.Â  Instead,\r\n  for some months after the closing, respondent made monthly mortgage payments on\r\n  the unsatisfied mortgage from various accounts under his control.Â  Further,\r\n  respondent admits that no title insurance policy was issued after the closing\r\n  despite fees of $791.70 being shown on the closing statement as withheld for\r\n  the policy.Â  Respondent admits he cannot account for the funds shown on the\r\n  closing statement as received and reserved for the first mortgage payoff and\r\n  title insurance policy and that the funds were not available on deposit in his\r\n  trust account at the time of his interim suspension on February 22, 2008.Â  Respondent\r\n  acknowledges he was the closing attorney for the first mortgage in a separate\r\n  much earlier transaction and failed to record that mortgage.Â Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nIn March\r\n  2007, respondent received a $42,000 settlement check.Â  Respondent admits he\r\n  negotiated the settlement check but did not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the\r\n  funds.Â  Respondent admits he failed to safeguard the funds and the funds were\r\n  not available on deposit in his trust account at the time of his February 22,\r\n  2008 interim suspension.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he undertook to represent a client in a domestic matter seeking to\r\n  negotiate a child support reduction and the Â modification of an agreement.Â  On\r\n  January 29, 2008, he was paid a flat fee of $2,500 for the representation.Â  As\r\n  a result of his interim suspension, respondent did not serve the opposing\r\n  party.Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nMatter V\r\nRespondent admits\r\n  he undertook to represent a client in an expungement and was paid $500.Â  He did\r\n  not complete the work on the matter.Â  \r\nMatter VI\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he received a $6,000 settlement check.Â  He negotiated the settlement\r\n  check but did not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the funds to the client.Â \r\n  Respondent admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that the funds were not\r\n  available on deposit in his trust account at the time of his February 22, 2008\r\n  interim suspension.Â Â  \r\nMatter VII\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he received a $10,000 settlement check.Â  He negotiated the settlement\r\n  check but did not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the funds to the client.Â \r\n  Respondent admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that the funds were not\r\n  available on deposit in his trust account at the time of his February 22, 2008\r\n  interim suspension.Â Â  \r\nMatter VIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits he received a $6,000 settlement check in October 2007.Â  He admits he\r\n  negotiated the settlement check without his clientâ€™s signature.Â  Respondent did\r\n  not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the funds until after his interim suspension\r\n  on February 22, 2008.Â  Respondent agrees he initially failed to safeguard the\r\n  funds and that he neglected to promptly remit the clientâ€™s share of the funds.Â  \r\nMatter IX\r\nIn June\r\n  2005, respondent admits he received a $75,000 settlement check.Â  He admits he\r\n  negotiated the check but did not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the funds to\r\n  the client.Â  Respondent admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that the\r\n  funds were not available on deposit in his trust account at the time of his\r\n  February 22, 2008 interim suspension.Â Â  \r\nMatter X\r\nIn March\r\n  2007, respondent received a settlement check in the amount of $1,419.Â \r\n  Respondent negotiated the check but did not disburse the clientâ€™s share of the\r\n  funds to his client or disburse the funds to the medical providers.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that the funds were not available\r\n  on deposit in his trust account at the time of his February 22, 2008 interim\r\n  suspension.Â Â  \r\nMatter XI\r\nIn March\r\n  2004, respondent received two personal injury protection (PIP) checks totaling\r\n  $1,000 from a client.Â  Respondent admits he negotiated the checks but did not\r\n  disburse the clientâ€™s share of the funds to his client or disburse funds to the\r\n  medical providers.Â  Respondent admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that\r\n  the funds were not available on deposit in his trust account at the time of his\r\n  February 22, 2008 interim suspension.Â Â  \r\nMatter XII\r\nIn 2004,\r\n  respondent undertook to represent a client in a personal injury case.Â  He\r\n  admits he failed to act with reasonable diligence on the matter and failed to\r\n  obtain a written settlement agreement from opposing counsel.Â  Further,\r\n  respondent admits that, in May 2007, he mistakenly told the court that the case\r\n  was settled.Â  Ultimately, the case was dismissed by the court.Â  \r\nMatter XIII\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that, in October 2006, he obtained two medical payment checks in the\r\n  amount of $3,000 from a client.Â  Respondent admits he negotiated the checks but\r\n  did not disburse the funds to the client or medical providers.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to safeguard the funds and that the funds were not available\r\n  on deposit in his trust account at the time of his February 22, 2008 interim\r\n  suspension.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that, by his\r\n  misconduct, he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide\r\n  competent representation to a client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness\r\n    in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep a client reasonably informed about\r\n      the status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for\r\n      information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold property of clients\r\n  in the lawyerâ€™s possession in connection with a representation separate from\r\n  the lawyerâ€™s own property); Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a\r\n  lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits he violated\r\n  Rule 417, SCACR.Â  \r\nFurther, respondent admits his\r\n  misconduct is grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate Rules of Professional Conduct) and 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for\r\n  discipline for lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline\r\n  by Consent and disbar respondent. Â Further, we order respondent to pay full\r\n  restitution to all clients, banks, and other persons and entities, including\r\n  the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client Protection, who have incurred losses as a result\r\n  of his misconduct and to reimburse the Commission and ODC for costs incurred in\r\n  this matter.Â  Within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion, ODC and\r\n  respondent shall enter into a restitution plan which complies with this opinion\r\n  and includes a timeline for reimbursement of the Commissionâ€™s and ODCâ€™s costs.Â \r\n  Under no circumstances shall respondent be permitted to file a Petition for\r\n  Reinstatement until full restitution and payment of costs have been made.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also\r\n  surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of\r\n  Court.Â  \r\nDISBARRED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES,\r\n  BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26671","title":"Mahdi v.

Â§\r\n  16-3-25 (2003).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn July 15, 2004,\r\n  petitioner killed an employee while robbing a gas station in North Carolina.Â \r\n  Petitioner shot the North Carolina victim twice in the face at point blank\r\n  range using a gun he had stolen from his grandmotherâ€™s neighbor.Â  He was\r\n  driving a vehicle stolen from Virginia, on which he had placed stolen license\r\n  plates. Â Two days later, petitioner car-jacked a man in Columbia at 3:30 a.m.\r\n  using the same weapon.Â  Early that same morning, petitioner pulled into the Wilco Travel Plaza located off Interstate 26 in Calhoun County.Â  Employees at the Travel Plaza became suspicious when petitioner was repeatedly unable to purchase gasoline\r\n  from the pumps, while attempting to use stolen credit and/or check cards.Â  The\r\n  employees called law enforcement, and when officers arrived, petitioner fled on\r\n  foot.Â  He ran to a nearby farm property owned by Captain and Mrs. Myers.[3]Â \r\n  The Myers did not reside on the rural property, but there was a shed in which\r\n  they kept equipment and in which Mrs. Myers had an office.\r\nPetitioner found a\r\n  .22 caliber semi-automatic rifle in the shed where he apparently spent the\r\n  day.Â  When Captain Myers stopped by the farm that evening, petitioner shot him\r\n  nine times with the .22:Â  three bullets struck the victim in the head.Â \r\n  Petitioner then poured diesel fuel over the body and lit it.Â  He stole Myersâ€™\r\n  truck and various firearms from the shed and drove to Florida, where he was\r\n  arrested three days later after a chase.\r\nAfter a\r\n  jury was selected but before it was sworn, petitioner elected to enter a guilty\r\n  plea to the charges of murdering Captain Myers, burglarizing the shed, and\r\n  stealing the personal property.Â  The trial judge conducted a sentencing\r\n  hearing, following which he issued an eleven and a half page sentencing order.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Whether petitionerâ€™s capital sentence should be reversed because\r\n    the trial judge improperly based his decision to impose a death sentence on\r\n    petitionerâ€™s assertion of his right to a jury trial, thereby effectively\r\n    punishing him for exercising this constitutional right?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nPetitionerâ€™s\r\n  argument relates to the following passage from the sentencing order, which is\r\n  the last paragraph in the section of the order titled â€œMitigating\r\n  Circumstances:â€\r\n\r\n  The defense further argues as non-statutory mitigating\r\n    circumstance that the Court should consider the Defendantâ€™s guilty plea in\r\n    determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed.Â  The Defendantâ€™s guilty\r\n    plea occurred during the fourth day of his trial, following jury selection but\r\n    prior to the jury being sworn.Â  This was one day following his attempted escape\r\n    through the use of the homemade key.Â  In addition, Mr. Mahdi has failed to\r\n    demonstrate any remorse for his actions at any point in time known to the\r\n    Court.Â  Therefore, I conclude that no significant weight should be given to\r\n    this non-statutory mitigating circumstance in the Courtâ€™s ultimate decision as\r\n    to the sentence to be imposed.\r\n\r\nPetitioner contends\r\n  this paragraph, specifically the second sentence, â€œThe Defendantâ€™s guilty plea\r\n  occurred during the fourth day of his trial, following jury selection but prior\r\n  to the jury being sworn,â€ demonstrates the judge improperly punished petitioner\r\n  for initially exercising his right to a jury trial.Â  See e.g. State\r\n    v. Hazel, 317 S.C. 368, 453 S.E.2d 879 (1995) (judge cannot consider\r\n  defendants exercise of right to jury trial sentencing).Â  The State maintains,\r\n  to the contrary, that this sentence is merely a factual recitation, or at most\r\n  a partial explanation why the judge declined to consider the plea as a significant\r\n  mitigator, but that it is not indicative of any punitive intent.Â  Since, as\r\n  petitioner conceded at oral argument, there was no objection to this passage at\r\n  trial, no issue has been preserved for this Courtâ€™s review.Â  State v. Owens,\r\n  378 S.C. 636, 664 S.E.2d 80 (2008) (strict error preservation rules apply to\r\n  capital cases).\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nPursuant to Â§\r\n  16-3-25(c), we have conducted a proportionality review and find the death\r\n  sentence was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary\r\n  factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of other decisions demonstrates that\r\n  petitionerâ€™s sentence is neither excessive nor disproportionate.Â  See e.g. State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 485 S.E.2d 360 (1997) (capital sentence\r\n  upheld where aggravators were burglary and armed robbery).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nPetitionerâ€™s\r\n  conviction and sentences are\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nWALLER, BEATTY\r\nand KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. Â TOAL, C.J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Although\r\n  I concur with the majority, I write separately to record the facts of this\r\nparticularly heinous case.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  July 14, 2004, Petitioner, then a resident of Virginia, embarked upon a crime\r\n  spree that would span four states.Â  Petitioner stole a .380 caliber pistol from\r\n  his neighbor, a set of Virginia license plates, and a station wagon.Â \r\nPetitioner left Virginia and headed to North Carolina.\r\nOn\r\n  July 15, Petitioner entered an Exxon gas station in Winston-Salem, North Carolina armed with the .380 pistol.Â  Petitioner took a can of beer from a cooler and\r\n  placed it on the counter.Â  The store clerk, Christopher Jason Boggs, asked\r\n  Petitioner for identification.Â  As Boggs was checking Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  identification, Petitioner fatally shot him at point-blank range.Â  Petitioner\r\n  fired another shot into Boggs as he lay on the floor.Â  Petitioner then\r\n  attempted unsuccessfully to open the storeâ€™s cash register.Â  Petitioner left\r\nthe store with the can of beer, and headed to South Carolina.\r\nEarly\r\n  in the morning of July 17, Petitioner approached Corey Pitts as he sat at a\r\n  traffic light in downtown Columbia, South Carolina.Â  Petitioner stuck his gun\r\n  in Pittsâ€™ face, forced him out of his car, and stole Pittsâ€™ Ford Expedition.Â \r\n  Petitioner replaced the Expeditionâ€™s license plates with the plates he had\r\nstolen in Virginia, and headed southeast on I-26.Â  \r\nAbout\r\n  thirty-five minutes down the road, Petitioner stopped at a Wilco Hess gas\r\n  station in Calhoun County and attempted to buy gas with a credit card.Â  The\r\n  pump rejected the card, and Petitioner spent forty-five minutes to an hour\r\n  attempting to get the pump to work.Â  Due to his suspicious behavior, the store\r\n  clerks called the police.Â  Aware that the clerksâ€™ suspicions had been alerted,\r\n  Petitioner left the Expedition at the station and fled on foot through woods\r\nbehind the station.Â  \r\nAbout\r\n  a quarter to half mile from the station, Petitioner came upon a farm owned by\r\n  Captain James Myers, a thirty-one year veteran law enforcement officer and\r\n  fireman.Â  Petitioner broke into a work shop on the Myers property.Â  Once inside\r\n  the work shop, Petitioner watched television and examined Myersâ€™ gun\r\n  collection.Â  Petitioner found Myersâ€™ shotgun and used the tools in the shop to\r\n  saw off the barrel and paint it black.Â  Petitioner also took Myersâ€™ .22 caliber\r\nrifle and laid in wait for Myers.\r\nThat\r\n  day, Myers had been at the beach celebrating the birthdays of his wife, sister,\r\n  and daughter.Â  Myers had visited with his father before returning to his farm.Â \r\n  Upon arriving at the farm, Myers stopped by the work shop, where he was\r\n  confronted by Petitioner.Â  Petitioner shot Myers nine times with the .22\r\n  rifle.Â  Petitioner then poured diesel fuel on Myerâ€™s body and set the body on\r\n  fire.Â  Petitioner stole Myersâ€™ police-issued truck, and left with Myersâ€™\r\nshotgun, his .22 rifle, and Myersâ€™ police-issued assault rifle.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nLater\r\n  that evening, Myersâ€™ wife, also a law enforcement officer, became worried when\r\n  Myers did not return home.Â  Mrs. Myers drove to the work shop and discovered\r\nMyersâ€™ burned body lying in a pool of blood.Â  \r\nPetitioner\r\n  escaped to Florida, where he was spotted by police on July 21 driving Myersâ€™\r\n  truck.Â  Fleeing the police, Petitioner abandoned the truck on foot in\r\n  possession of the assault rifle.Â  When cornered by police, Petitioner abandoned\r\nthe rifle and was eventually taken into custody.Â  \r\nI\r\n  recite these facts to emphasize the egregious nature of Petitionerâ€™s crimes.Â \r\n  In my time on this Court, I have seen few cases where the extraordinary penalty\r\n  of death was so deserved.Â  I therefore concur with the majority and vote to\r\naffirm Petitionerâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Court agreed to issue a writ of certiorari to consider this case since no\r\n  timely notice of appeal was served.Â  See Ray v.

Smith, 372 S.C. 404, 642 S.E.2d 627 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The State\r\n  petitioned for and was granted a writ of certiorari for this Court to review\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  We find the State did not have a right\r\n  to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  Accordingly, we vacate the opinion of the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  the summer of 1998, Respondent, his two minor sons (John Doe and Richard Roe),\r\n  his wife, and his daughter moved to Bluffton, South Carolina from New York.Â  Shortly after the move, Respondent and his wife were divorced.Â  Doe was removed\r\n  from his motherâ€™s custody after his brother, Richard Roe, discovered him\r\n  engaging in sexual behavior with the son of his motherâ€™s boyfriend.Â  Doe, Roe,\r\n  and their sister were ultimately placed in the custody of their uncle and aunt,\r\n  Cynthia Solak, who lived in West Virginia. \r\nFollowing Doeâ€™s\r\n  exhibition of sexual preoccupation, sexual acting out, and destructive\r\n  behavior, he underwent counseling and eventually revealed Respondentâ€™s\r\n  molestation of him during one of the counseling sessions. \r\nAs a\r\n  result, Respondent was indicted for first-degree CSC with a minor.Â  At trial,\r\n  Doe described in detail the sexual abuse.Â  On cross-examination, Doe\r\n  acknowledged that prior to trial, he and his aunt (Solak), had reviewed the\r\n  questions that would likely be asked and discussed his testimony.Â  Doe also\r\n  admitted that he had looked over to Solak while testifying.Â  However, Doe\r\n  maintained on re-direct examination that â€œ[t]hese are my answers.â€Â  Doe also\r\n  acknowledged that he revealed the sexual abuse while living with Solak because\r\n  he felt â€œsafe.â€ \r\nAfter Doeâ€™s\r\n  testimony, Respondentâ€™s counsel asked the trial judge to remove Solak from the\r\n  courtroom while Doeâ€™s older brother, Richard Roe, testified during an in\r\n    camera hearing on a Lyle[1] issue.Â  In making this request, counsel stated:\r\n\r\n\tI didnâ€™t\r\n  object after [Solak] testified to [her] be[ing] in the courtroom.Â  But it was\r\n  apparent during [Doeâ€™s] testimony that there were motions and mouth movement[s]\r\n  and things going back and forth between the witness and Miss Solak and that was\r\n  reported to me by individuals in the courtroom. \r\n\r\nSubsequently,\r\n  Solak voluntarily left the courtroom. \r\nFollowing\r\n  Roeâ€™s in camera testimony, Respondentâ€™s counsel moved for a mistrial on\r\n  the ground that Solak improperly coached and influenced Doe during his\r\n  testimony.Â  In the alternative, counsel moved to strike Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  Counsel\r\n  contended that Solakâ€™s misconduct compromised the validity and credibility of\r\n  Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial judge denied counselâ€™s motions, stating:\r\n\r\n\tYou did\r\n  not, as an officer of the court, call it to my attention so that I could take\r\n  appropriate action so you knew it was going on . . . and took no action.\r\n\tAnd so I\r\n  think that is a waiver and I do find - - And I watched [this] young man testify\r\n  - - that I do not believe that this caused any - - influenced his answers because\r\n  he was basically going over the same things so Iâ€™m not going to declare a\r\n  mistrial . . . .\r\n\r\nIn response,\r\n  Respondentâ€™s counsel claimed that she was not aware of the â€œmagnitude of what\r\n  was taking placeâ€ until she finished her cross-examination of Doe and sat down\r\n  with her co-counsel who informed her of what he saw between Doe and Solak\r\n  during the testimony. \r\nThe\r\n  judge then reiterated his denial of the mistrial motion and the motion to\r\n  strike Doeâ€™s testimony, explaining:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[I]f\r\n  co[-]counsel knew it, youâ€™re charged with knowing it too, because heâ€™s sitting\r\n  at the table with you.Â  \r\n\tHaving\r\n  failed to bring the matter to the courtâ€™s attention, you know, if itâ€™s a\r\n  strategic matter, you decided to ask him about it and knowing- - you did not\r\n  make - - ask for a sidebar or anything, which you could have.Â  \r\n\tI\r\n  frankly think what you did was probably the best way because I think the juryâ€™s\r\n  much more influenced in determining the credibility of testimony as to whether\r\n  or not the will of the young man was overridden by the people in authority . .\r\n  . .\r\n\tI have\r\n  the utmost confidence in the jury to render a just verdict in this case.Â  I\r\n  believe it certainly is made more difficult by that unfortunate thing\r\n  happening. \r\n\r\nAt\r\n  the conclusion of the Stateâ€™s case, Respondentâ€™s counsel renewed the mistrial\r\n  motion. Â The trial judge again summarily denied the motion. \r\nAfter\r\n  the jury found Respondent guilty of first-degree CSC with a minor, the trial\r\n  judge sentenced him to twenty years in prison.Â  The next day, the trial judge\r\n  heard testimony regarding Respondentâ€™s motion for a new trial specifically with\r\n  respect to the issue of Solakâ€™s coaching of Doe during his testimony. \r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Respondentâ€™s counsel offered the testimony of three individuals\r\n  who were present in the courtroom during Doeâ€™s testimony.[2]Â  \r\nThe\r\n  first witness testified â€œI couldnâ€™t see [Doe] from where I was so I donâ€™t know\r\n  what he was doing but I could see her sitting over there and she was nodding\r\n  her head back and forth, up and down and verbally saying stuff.â€ Â When asked by\r\n  the trial judge whether it appeared that Solak was trying to assist Doe in\r\n  answering the questions, the witness responded, â€œThatâ€™s what it appeared to be;\r\n  however, I couldnâ€™t see him so I donâ€™t know, you know, if he was looking at her\r\n  but I assumed he was . . . .â€ \r\nThe\r\n  second witness also testified that she observed Solak making motions with her head\r\n  during Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  She believed Solak was â€œtrying to give the minor,\r\n  twelve-year old answers to the questions that were being asked.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  third and final witness testified she observed Solak make head gestures toward\r\n  Doe. Â She stated she thought Respondentâ€™s counsel had observed the motions stating,\r\n  â€œwhen you were questioning him you asked him a question and, and I think you\r\n  noticed his eyes going towards her.Â  And thatâ€™s when you moved over in front of\r\n  her.â€ \r\nAfter\r\n  the post-trial hearing, the trial judge granted Respondentâ€™s motion for a new\r\n  trial.Â  In so ruling, the judge found:Â  1) Solak â€œused body language and other\r\n  non-verbal signals in the courtroom during [Doeâ€™s] testimony and such\r\n  communications were directed at [Doe] during his testimonyâ€; 2) â€œ[s]uch\r\n  behavior on the part of [Solak] may have overridden [Doeâ€™s] free willâ€; and 3)\r\n  â€œ[Solakâ€™s] behavior and the potential for corruption of [Doeâ€™s] testimony\r\n  clearly denied [Respondent] a fair trial.â€ \r\nThe\r\n  State appealed the trial judgeâ€™s order to the Court of Appeals.Â  In a divided\r\n  opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed the grant of a new trial.Â  State v.\r\n    Smith, 372 S.C. 404, 642 S.E.2d 627 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The majority prefaced\r\n  its analysis by implicitly finding that the State could appeal the decision on\r\n  the ground it was based on an error of law.Â  Id. at 408, 642 S.E.2d at 629-30.Â \r\n  The majority also concluded that Respondentâ€™s counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  contemporaneously object to the coaching did not waive Respondentâ€™s right to\r\n  request a mistrial given the record did not clearly show the coaching was\r\n  apparent to Respondentâ€™s counsel during Doeâ€™s cross-examination.Â  Id. at 409-10, 642 S.E.2d at 630-31.Â  Additionally, the majority believed the trial\r\n  judge did not have all of the relevant information or much time to consider the\r\n  issue when he initially denied the mistrial motions.Â  Having determined the\r\n  issue to be preserved, the majority found evidence in the record to support the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s decision to grant a new trial.Â  Id. at 409, 642 S.E.2d at 630.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  dissent advocated reversing the order of the trial judge and reinstating\r\n  Respondentâ€™s sentence.Â  Id. at 410, 642 S.E.2d at 631.Â  The dissent\r\n  believed Respondent received the relief sought in his request to remove Solak\r\n  from the courtroom after Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  Because Solak voluntarily left the\r\n  courtroom, the dissent found counselâ€™s request did not preserve the coaching\r\n  issue for appellate review.Â  Id. at 411, 642 S.E.2d at 631.Â  Moreover, the\r\n  dissent determined Respondent waived the issue because his counsel was apprised\r\n  of Solakâ€™s conduct during Doeâ€™s testimony but did not object or request a\r\n  mistrial until after Doeâ€™s brother, Roe, testified.Â  Because there was no\r\n  contemporaneous objection by Respondentâ€™s counsel, the dissent found the trial\r\n  judge erred by granting Respondentâ€™s motion for a new trial on this issue after\r\n  the judge had initially concluded that Respondent waived the coaching issue.Â  Id. at 412, 642 S.E.2d at 632.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the trial judge erred in granting Respondent a new trial.Â  In\r\n  support of this contention, the State avers:Â  1) the issue was not properly\r\n  preserved at trial, and 2) the judge erroneously substituted his judgment for\r\n  that of the jury. \r\nIn response, Respondent asserts this Court should\r\n  dismiss the Stateâ€™s appeal because the State had no right to appeal the order\r\n  granting Respondent a new trial.Â  In the alternative, Respondent claims the\r\n  trial judge properly granted him a new trial when it became apparent that Solak\r\n  improperly coached Doe during his trial testimony.Â  \r\nAs a\r\n  threshold issue, we must resolve whether the State had the right to appeal the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  â€œThe State may only appeal a new trial order if, in\r\n  granting it, the trial judge committed an error of law.â€Â  State v. Johnson,\r\n  376 S.C. 8, 10, 654 S.E.2d 835, 836 (2007).Â  â€œWhen determining whether an error\r\n  of law exists, and therefore whether the State has the right to an appeal, it\r\n  is necessary to consider the merits of the case.â€Â  Id. at 11, 654 S.E.2d\r\n  at 836.\r\nIn\r\n  order to review the merits of this case, we must initially determine whether Respondent\r\n  was procedurally barred from making a new trial motion challenging Solakâ€™s\r\n  â€œcoachingâ€ of Doe.\r\nAlthough\r\n  counsel failed to object to Solakâ€™s coaching during Doeâ€™s cross-examination, we\r\n  find the issue was properly preserved in that counsel timely raised the issue\r\n  to the trial judge and obtained a ruling.Â  After Doeâ€™s cross-examination,\r\n  counsel became aware of the extent of Solakâ€™s coaching once she conferred with\r\n  her co-counsel and other individuals in the courtroom who observed Solakâ€™s\r\n  conduct.Â  At that point, she informed the trial judge of the situation and\r\n  moved for a mistrial.Â  In view of this procedural posture, we conclude counselâ€™s\r\n  objection was sufficiently contemporaneous and provided the trial judge an\r\n  opportunity to rule on the mistrial motion.Â  See State v. McIntosh,\r\n  358 S.C 432, 445 n.7, 595 S.E.2d 484, 491 n.7 (2004) (finding objection was\r\n  sufficiently contemporaneous where defendantâ€™s attorney objected after second\r\n  improper question); cf. State v. Pauling, 322 S.C. 95, 100, 470\r\n  S.E.2d 106, 109 (1996) (stating that â€œ[h]aving denied the trial judge an\r\n  opportunity to cure any alleged error by failing to contemporaneously object . . ., Appellant is\r\n  procedurally barred from raising these issues for the first time on appealâ€).\r\nBecause\r\n  counsel posited a timely objection and received a ruling, we find the grounds\r\n  for the mistrial motion and, in turn, the new trial motion were not waived.Â  See State v. Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 6 n.6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718 n.6 (1998)\r\n  (stating â€œthe ultimate goal behind preservation of error rules is to insure\r\n  that an issue raised on appeal has first been addressed to and ruled on by the\r\n  trial courtâ€).\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  at the time the trial judge ruled on the motion for a mistrial, he was not\r\n  aware of the magnitude of Solakâ€™s misconduct.Â  In fact, after Respondentâ€™s\r\n  counsel requested to have Solak removed from the courtroom, the judge indicated\r\n  that he did not notice Solakâ€™s alleged coaching. Â However, at the hearing on\r\n  the new trial motion, the trial judge was more fully apprised of Solakâ€™s\r\n  â€œcoachingâ€ of Doe.Â  Based on this additional evidence, the trial judge was able\r\n  to thoroughly consider the mistrial motion and conclude that his prior ruling\r\n  regarding waiver was not proper under these circumstances.Â  Thus, not until the\r\n  new trial hearing was the trial judge able to make an informed decision based\r\n  upon all the relevant facts, law, and arguments.Â  See Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v.\r\n    Town of Mount Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716, 724 (2000) (â€œImposing\r\n  this preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower\r\n  court to rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.â€); Rhoad v. State, 372 S.C. 100, 108 n.3, 641 S.E.2d 35, 39\r\n  n.3 (Ct. App. 2007) (â€œUntil an order is written and entered, the judge is free\r\n  to change his mind and amend prior rulings.â€); cf. State\r\n    v. Floyd, 295 S.C. 518, 520, 369 S.E.2d 842, 843 (1988) (stating a ruling\r\n  on a motion in limine is subject to change based on events at trial).Â  Consequently,\r\n  we find the mistrial issue was not waived and the trial judge properly\r\n  considered it as a ground for granting Respondent a new trial.\r\nHaving\r\n  found Respondent did not waive the mistrial issue, we now address the merits of\r\n  this issue in conjunction with determining the Stateâ€™s right to appeal.Â  Thus,\r\n  the question becomes whether the trial judgeâ€™s grant of a new trial constituted\r\n  an error of law.Â  \r\nThis\r\n  Court is confined by an extremely limited â€œabuse of discretionâ€ standard of\r\n  review regarding the grant of a new trial in the circumstances presented in\r\n  this case.Â  See State v. Simmons, 279 S.C. 165, 166, 303 S.E.2d\r\n  857, 858 (1983) (stating the grant or denial of a new trial is within the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s discretion and will not be overturned on appeal absent a clear abuse of\r\n  discretion); 23A C.J.S. Criminal Law Â§ 1605 (2008) (â€œExcept in certain\r\n  circumstances, it is reprehensible for a spectator to try to influence a\r\n  witness while the witness is testifying, or to try to convey directions to the\r\n  witness as to the answers that should be given.Â  It is largely within the\r\n  discretion of the trial judge as to what should be done when such conduct\r\n  occurs.â€). \r\nBased\r\n  on our review of the record, there is evidence to support the judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  All parties admitted that Solak acted inappropriately in mouthing\r\n  words and making nonverbal signals to Doe during his testimony.Â  Clearly, the\r\n  trial judge was in the best position to assess the credibility of the witnesses\r\n  that testified at the hearing on the motion for a new trial. Â State v.\r\n    Tutton, 354 S.C. 319, 325, 580 S.E.2d 186, 190 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œThe determination\r\n  of a witnessâ€™s credibility must be left to the trial judge who saw and heard\r\n  the witness and is therefore in a better position to evaluate\r\n  his or her veracity.â€).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Doe was the key witness in the prosecutionâ€™s case, we cannot disregard the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s conclusion concerning the prejudicial impact on Respondentâ€™s\r\n  right to a fair trial.Â  Cf. Sharp v. Commonwealth, 849 S.W.2d\r\n  542, 546-47 (Ky. 1993) (reversing trial judgeâ€™s denial of defendantâ€™s motion\r\n  for a mistrial where child witness was coached by a family friend and finding\r\n  â€œthe violations here as so egregious and inimical to the concept of a fair\r\n  trial that they cannot be disregarded in the name of trial court discretionâ€); State\r\n    v. Dayhuff, 158 P.3d 330, 342 (Kan. Ct. App. 2007) (holding trial courtâ€™s\r\n  refusal to allow defendant, at the time of trial, to develop a factual basis\r\n  for his motion for a mistrial that was based on the allegation that the child\r\n  advocateâ€™s gestures during child witnessâ€™s testimony served to coach or vouch\r\n  for the child warranted a new trial).\r\nAlthough\r\n  we are aware of the trauma a trial may bring to minor victims, we reach our\r\n  decision constrained by our standard of review and the necessity to uphold the\r\n  integrity of the judicial system.Â  In view of the clearly improper â€œcoachingâ€\r\n  by Solak of the minor victim, we find the judge did not abuse his discretion or\r\n  commit an error of law in granting Respondent a new trial.Â  In so holding, we are\r\n  guided by the following principle:\r\n\r\n\tWhen it\r\n  is made to appear that anything has occurred which may have improperly\r\n  influenced the action of the jury, the accused should be granted a new trial,\r\n  although he may appear to be ever so guilty, because it may be said that his\r\n  guilt has not been ascertained in the manner prescribed by law.\r\n\r\nState v. Britt, 235 S.C. 395, 425, 111 S.E.2d 669, 685 (1959)\r\n  (emphasis added), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence,\r\n  305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).\r\nBecause we find the\r\n  trial judge properly exercised his authority to grant a new trial upon the\r\n  facts, we conclude the judgeâ€™s decision was not predicated â€œwholly upon error\r\n  of law.â€Â  See State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 395, 399-400, 297 S.E.2d\r\n  414, 416 (1982) (recognizing trial judgeâ€™s power to grant a new trial upon the\r\n  facts)[3]; cf. State v. Des Champs, 126 S.C. 416, 418, 120 S.E. 491, 492\r\n  (1923) (â€œ[W]here the grant of a new trial in a criminal cause is predicated\r\n  wholly upon error of law, we think an appeal by the [S]tate will lie.â€).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold the State did not have the right to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s order.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the foregoing, we hold the State did not have\r\n  the right to appeal the trial judgeâ€™s decision to grant Respondent a new\r\n  trial.Â  As a result, we vacate the opinion of the Court of Appeals.\r\nVACATED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate\r\n  opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â  I\r\n  respectfully dissent.Â  In my view, the State had a right to appeal the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s granting of a new trial because the order was based upon an error of\r\n  law.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing the trial courtâ€™s order granting a new trial, the majority is correct\r\n  to observe that we review the trial court according to an abuse of discretion\r\n  standard.Â  However, we must apply this standard in the context with which a\r\n  trial court may exercise its discretion to grant a new trial.Â  We have said\r\n  many times that the granting of a mistrial is an extreme measure that should\r\n  only be taken where an incident is so grievous that prejudicial effect can be\r\n  removed in no other way.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 310, 513\r\n  S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999) (citing State v. Kelsey, 331 S.C. 50,\r\n  502 S.E.2d 63 (1998)). Â Furthermore, we must consider the entire\r\n  trial record when considering whether the trial court abused its discretion in\r\n  ordering a new trial.Â  See State v. Johnson, 334 S.C. 78, 91, 512 S.E.2d\r\n  795, 803 (1999) (â€œThe prejudicial character of the error must be determined\r\n  from its relationship to the entire case.â€)\r\nMy\r\n  review of the record reveals no evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s finding\r\n  that Respondent was â€œclearly deniedâ€ a right to a fair trial.Â  In my view, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s own factual finding that Solakâ€™s behavior â€œmay have over-ridden\r\n  the victimâ€™s free willâ€ does not support such a conclusion.Â  Doe confirmed that\r\n  his testimony was his own, and Solak left the courtroom once it was alleged\r\n  that she was coaching Doeâ€™s testimony.Â  Even if Solakâ€™s behavior did result in\r\n  some degree of prejudice to Respondent, I believe this prejudice was outweighed\r\n  by the ample evidence in the record to support the juryâ€™s verdict.Â  I find no\r\n  foundation for the trial courtâ€™s order and believe that the trial court abused\r\n  its discretion in granting Respondent a new trial.Â  I would therefore reverse\r\n  the opinion of the court of appeals, reverse the order of the trial court, and\r\n  reinstate Respondentâ€™s conviction and sentence.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â Â  State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803\r\n  (1923).\r\n[2]Â  Neither Doe nor Solak testified at this hearing as\r\n  they had already returned to their home in West Virginia. \r\n[3]Â  In Dasher, a jury found the defendant guilty\r\n  of conspiracy to violate the South Carolina Controlled Substance Act.Â  After\r\n  the verdict, the defendant filed a post-trial motion for judgment in his favor\r\n  notwithstanding the verdict.Â  Prior to sentencing, the trial judge, without the\r\n  assignment of any grounds, â€œsupplanted the jury verdict of guilty and entered a\r\n  verdict of his own of not guilty.â€Â  Dasher, 278 S.C. at 395, 297 S.E.2d\r\n  at 414.Â  The State appealed the trial judgeâ€™s decision.Â  Finding no precedent\r\n  in this state to support the trial judgeâ€™s decision, this Court reversed.Â  Id. at 400, 297 S.E.2d at 416.Â  In so ruling, this Court reasoned that â€œ[t]his is\r\n  not a case in which a trial judge has granted a new trial upon the facts\r\n  (a power which he admittedly has), but rather one in which a trial judge has\r\n  entered a verdict of not guilty in the face of conflicting evidence (a\r\n  power he has never had in this jurisdiction).â€Â  Id. Â Because the trial\r\n  judge set aside the verdict of the jury in the face of conflicting facts and\r\n  substituted his judgment for that of the jury, this Court concluded that the\r\n  judge committed an error of law.Â  Id. at 400, 297 S.E.2d at 417.\r\nThe instant case is\r\n  distinguishable from Dasher.Â  Here, the trial judge did not set aside\r\n  the verdict of the jury.Â  Instead, the trial judge properly exercised his\r\n  authority to grant a new trial upon the facts given â€œan injustice had been\r\n  doneâ€ during the trial.Â  Id. at 400, 297 S.E.2d at 416.Â  Thus, unlike\r\n  the trial judge in Dasher, the judge did not invade the province of the\r\n  jury or substitute his verdict for that of the jury.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26674","title":"State v.

Myers, of\r\n  Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: Petitioner Shawn\r\n  Wiles was indicted for assault and battery with intent to kill (ABIK), failure\r\n  to stop for a blue light, and possession of a stolen vehicle.Â  A jury convicted\r\n  him of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN) and failure\r\n  to stop for a blue light.[1]Â \r\n  Pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, the Court of Appeals affirmed in an unpublished\r\n  opinion.Â  See State v. Wiles, Op. No. 2007-UP-318 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 14, 2007).Â  We granted petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn December 26, 2003, a state trooper\r\n  clocked two vehicles traveling 101 mph on Highway 25 in Edgefield County.Â  The first vehicle was a pickup truck, and the second was a stolen 1997 Ford Crown Victoria driven by petitioner.Â  Putting on his blue light and siren, the trooper gave\r\n  chase.Â  The truck lost control and veered off the road.Â  The Ford then pulled\r\n  over, but as the trooper approached it, the car turned around and headed back\r\n  on the highway.Â  \r\nThe high-speed chase again ensued with the trooper and another\r\n  highway patrol vehicle pursuing petitioner.Â  The trooper testified that\r\n  petitioner turned onto Route 378 toward Saluda and drove at speeds over 120 mph\r\n  while passing other cars on the road in an unsafe manner.Â  A few miles outside\r\n  the city of Saluda, the trooperâ€™s supervisor directed him to terminate the\r\n  chase because of safety concerns.Â  \r\nHowever, Saluda County Sheriffâ€™s deputy Frank Daniel was at that\r\n  same time responding to the call about the chase.Â  Deputy Daniel was in an\r\n  intersection waiting to make a left turn onto Route 378 when petitioner ran a\r\n  red light and crashed into Deputy Danielâ€™s car.[2]\r\nThe force of the collision with the deputyâ€™s car propelled the\r\n  Ford into a nearby building.Â  Petitioner and his female passenger exited the\r\n  car, and went into the building.Â  A SWAT team responded to the scene, and\r\n  eventually petitioner was located in the building hiding above the ceiling\r\n  tiles.Â  Petitioner was unarmed, and the SWAT team apprehended him without\r\n  further incident.\r\nAt trial, evidence was admitted that approximately one week before\r\n  the chase petitioner had escaped from a South Carolina prison.[3]Â  A Department of Corrections (DOC)\r\n  investigator interviewed petitioner when he was re-incarcerated.Â  According to\r\n  the investigator, petitionerâ€™s thoughts while driving 140 mph were that â€œhe was\r\n  about to be killed or would end up killing someone in the process of trying to\r\n  get away from the police.â€Â  On cross-examination, the DOC investigator\r\n  acknowledged petitioner had told him that he panicked when he saw the trooper\r\n  and he did not intentionally try to ram into the deputyâ€™s car.\r\nThe jury convicted petitioner of the lesser included offense of\r\n  ABHAN and failure to stop for a blue light.Â  The trial court sentenced\r\n  petitioner to consecutive sentences of 10 years for ABHAN, and three years for\r\n  the failure to stop.\r\nOn appeal, petitioner argued the trial court erred in allowing\r\n  evidence of petitionerâ€™s escape.Â  Finding the issue unpreserved, the Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed.Â  \r\n\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Did the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in finding petitionerâ€™s issue on appeal unpreserved?\r\n\t2.&nbsp; Did the trial court\r\n  err in admitting evidence of petitionerâ€™s escape?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Issue Preservation\r\nPrior to jury\r\n  selection, petitioner made a motion in limine to exclude evidence of his\r\n  escape.Â  The trial court ruled the evidence admissible to show res gestae,\r\n  motive and intent.Â  Petitioner appealed the trial courtâ€™s ruling, but the Court\r\n  of Appeals found the issue unpreserved for appellate review.Â  See State v. Wiles, supra (citing State v. Forrester,\r\n  343 S.C. 637, 642, 541 S.E.2d 837, 840 (2001)). Â Petitioner argues the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred because the trial judgeâ€™s ruling was final. Â Furthermore,\r\n  petitioner contends that counsel renewed his objection when the escape evidence\r\n  was admitted.Â  We agree with petitioner that this issue is preserved.\r\nGenerally,\r\n  a motion in limine is not a final determination; a contemporaneous\r\n  objection must be made when the evidence is introduced.Â  State v. Forrester,\r\n  343 S.C. at 642, 541 S.E.2d at 840.Â  There is an exception to this general rule\r\n  when a ruling on the motion in limine is made â€œimmediately prior to the\r\n  introduction of the evidence in question.â€Â  Id.Â  This exception is based\r\n  on the fact that when the trial courtâ€™s ruling is not preliminary, but instead\r\n  is clearly a final ruling, there is no need to renew the objection.Â  Id. (citing State v. Mueller, 319 S.C. 266, 268-69, 460 S.E.2d 409, 410\r\n  (Ct.App.1995)).[4]\r\nIn the instant case, the\r\n  evidence was not immediately introduced after the motion in limine.Â \r\n  Nonetheless, by his actions, the trial judge clearly indicated that his ruling\r\n  was a final, rather than preliminary, one because he commented to the jury about petitionerâ€™s escape before any evidence was admitted.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  trial judge told the jury the following:\r\n\r\n\tThe State is gonna attempt to\r\n  introduce evidence related to the fact, in their view, that [petitioner] was an\r\n  escapee from another institution â€¦.Â  The evidence â€¦ related to an escape is\r\n  only allowed to be used for you to evaluate what his motives were, what his\r\n  intents were, whether there was a mistake or accident, something like that.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the escape was then\r\n  referenced by both the State and petitionerâ€™s counsel in their opening\r\n  statements. \r\nIn our opinion,\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling on the admission of evidence regarding petitionerâ€™s escape was a final ruling,\r\n  and therefore, petitionerâ€™s argument that the evidence was improperly admitted\r\n  is preserved for appellate review.[5]Â  See Forrester, supra.Â  \r\nThus, we\r\n  find the Court of Appeals erred in ruling that the issue raised on appeal was procedurally\r\n  barred.\r\n2.Â  Evidence\r\n  of Escape\r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits, petitioner argues the trial court judge erred in allowing the\r\n  evidence of his escape to be admitted at trial on the ABIK and failure to stop\r\n  charges.Â  Petitioner contends the evidence should have been excluded as\r\n  improper evidence of prior bad acts and because it was more prejudicial than\r\n  probative.Â  We disagree.\r\nEvidence is relevant and admissible if it\r\n  tends to establish or make more or less probable the matter in controversy. Â See Rules 401 &amp; 402, SCRE. Â Evidence of other crimes,\r\n  wrongs, or acts is generally not admissible to prove the character of a person\r\n  in order to show action in conformity therewith; however, such evidence may be\r\n  admissible â€œto show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident,\r\n  or intent.â€ Â Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  The evidence admitted must logically\r\n  relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  E.g., State\r\n    v. Stokes, 381 S.C. 390, 673 S.E.2d 434&nbsp;(2009); State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000).Â  \r\nStated differently, evidence\r\n  which is â€œlogically relevant to establish a material element of the offense\r\n  charged is not to be excluded merely because it incidentally reveals the\r\n  accusedâ€™s guilt of another crime.â€Â  State v. Green, 261 S.C. 366, 371,\r\n  200 S.E.2d 74, 77&nbsp;(1973); see also State v. Adams,\r\n  322 S.C. 114, 122, 470 S.E.2d 366, 370-71&nbsp;(1996) (evidence of other crimes which supplies the\r\n  context of the crime, or is intimately connected with and explanatory of the\r\n  crime charged, is admissible as res\r\n    gestae evidence).\r\nNonetheless, even where the evidence is shown to be relevant, if\r\n  its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair\r\n  prejudice, the evidence must be excluded.Â  See Rule 403, SCRE.Â  Unfair prejudice means an undue tendency to suggest\r\n  decision on an improper basis. Â State v. Stokes, supra; State v. Beck, supra.\r\nHere, the evidence of petitionerâ€™s escape was logically relevant\r\n  for several reasons. Â First, the evidence of escape shows his motive for\r\n  fleeing from police; thus, it was relevant on the failure to stop for a blue\r\n  light charge. See Rule 404(b), SCRE. Â Second, the evidence that petitioner\r\n  was an escapee was relevant to his alleged intent on the ABIK charge. Â Id.; cf. State v. Green, supra (where the Court held that evidence of appellantsâ€™ escape from prison, and\r\n  their status as fugitives, was admissible on the issues of intent and common\r\n  design in an attempted armed robbery case).Â  Finally,\r\n  this evidence was also admissible under the res gestae theory.Â  See State v. Adams, supra.[6]Â  \r\nFurther,\r\n  we find this evidence was not unduly prejudicial. See Rule 403, SCRE; State\r\n    v. Stokes, supra; State v. Beck, supra.\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of petitionerâ€™s escape,\r\n  and the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion is AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner moved for a directed verdict on the\r\n  possession of a stolen vehicle charge because evidence admitted at trial\r\n  indicated that petitioner himself had stolen the car in Georgia.Â  The trial court granted the motion.Â  See State v. McNeil, 314 S.C.\r\n  473, 445 S.E.2d 461&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994) (the possession of a stolen vehicle\r\n  statute requires that the defendant receive the goods from someone who actually\r\n  stole them; he cannot receive the vehicle from himself).\r\n[2] The deputy was taken to the\r\n  hospital and missed 5 days of work, but he was not seriously injured.\r\n[3] The record reflects that in a separate proceeding\r\n  prior to the instant trial, petitioner pled guilty to, and was sentenced for,\r\n  the escape.\r\n[4] See also Staubes v. City of Folly\r\n  Beach,&nbsp;339 S.C. 406, 415, 529 S.E.2d 543, 547&nbsp;(2000) (â€œThis Court\r\n  does not require parties to engage in futile actions in order to preserve issues for appellate review.â€).\r\n[5] In any event, we note counsel did specifically renew\r\n  his objection on the record when this evidence was first admitted.\r\n[6] We agree with the State\r\n  that the evidence of petitionerâ€™s escape was â€œthe first link in a chain\r\n  of circumstancesâ€ which led to the criminal charges in the instant case.

McDevitt &amp; Street Co., 260 S.C. 463, 468, 196\r\nS.E.2d 833, 835 (1973), and reverse.\r\nI.\r\nOn April 18, 2003,\r\n  Brayboy sustained a back injury, which required lumbar fusion surgery.Â  On the\r\n  day of the injury, Brayboy moved a lot of lumber and while removing a chain\r\n  link fence, he felt a terrible pull in his back.Â  Brayboy worked the entire\r\n  day, which was a Friday, and reported the injury on Monday.Â  Subsequently,\r\nBrayboy filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim against his putative employer, WorkForce.\r\nBrayboyâ€™s\r\n  employment application included the following disclaimers:\r\n\r\n  If\r\n    I do not give accurate and truthful information on this Medical History\r\n    Questionnaire, which forms the second and final part of my employment\r\n    agreement, the entire employment agreement shall be considered null and void.\r\n  MISREPRESENTATIONS\r\n    AS TO PREEXISTING PHYSICAL OR MENTAL CONDITIONS MAY CAUSE FORFEITURE OF YOUR\r\n    WORKERSâ€™ COMPENSATION BENEFITS.\r\n\r\n(emphasis in original).Â  Notably,\r\n  Brayboy signed his name under these cautionary statements.Â  Despite these\r\n  warnings, Brayboy responded in the negative to all questions inquiring if\r\n  Brayboy had prior back injuries, physical defects, medical conditions, or\r\n  previous workersâ€™ compensation claims.Â  However, at the workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  hearing, Brayboy testified about multiple prior physical problems.Â  These\r\n  conditions included a back injury while in the Navy, a back injury in 1996\r\n  resulting in a workersâ€™ compensation claim, and a pinched nerve in 1996.\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  during his service in the Navy in the early 1970s, Brayboy fell, slid on the\r\n  shipâ€™s deck, and hit a rail.Â  According to Brayboy, the Navy x-rayed his back\r\n  and gave him medicine for treatment.Â  The Navy also diagnosed Brayboy with a\r\n  back deformity he had since birth â€” a missing piece of bone.Â  Brayboy further\r\n  stated he was honorably discharged in 1973 due to his back defect.\r\nNotably,\r\n  since the 1970s, Brayboy has received benefits from the Department of Veteransâ€™\r\n  Administration (VA).Â  The impairment rating increased from ten to twenty\r\n  percent due to a pinched nerve.Â  Following the 2003 injury, the VA raised\r\n  Brayboyâ€™s disability rating from twenty to forty percent as the â€œservice\r\n  connected condition(s) has/have worsened.â€\r\nBrayboy further\r\n  testified he filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim in 1996 while working for\r\n  McCrory Construction.Â  The claim arose from an accident when Brayboy was in a\r\n  hole thirty to forty feet deep taking measurements while other workers poured\r\n  concrete for a parking garage.Â  Brayboy stated a backhoe was too close to the\r\n  edge of the hole, and â€œ[the hole] collapsed, and I was pulled out by several of\r\n  my workers.â€Â  This accident injured Brayboyâ€™s middle to low back and right\r\n  ankle.\r\nBrayboy\r\n  filed a workersâ€™ compensation claim for this injury, received a settlement for\r\n  this claim, and was given a five percent impairment rating for his back as well\r\n  as five percent for his ankle.Â  Brayboy testified in deposition that his\r\n  current back pain was â€œprimarily in the same areaâ€ as the cave-in injury; however,\r\n  at the hearing, he disputed the similarity of the injuries.Â  Additionally,\r\n  Brayboy testified he suffered a pinched nerve in his right hip in 1996.Â  This\r\n  was unrelated to the cave-in and was due to wearing a heavy tool belt.\r\nBrayboy testified\r\n  he did not report any of his prior injuries to WorkForce as he did not feel the\r\n  injuries were relevant to a construction job.Â  Also, Brayboy stated he did not\r\n  include the cave-in injury as it had â€œcleared up very quickly.â€\r\nThe single\r\n  commissioner found a compensable injury and Brayboy credible when testifying he\r\n  filled out the employment application in adherence to his belief he was neither\r\n  permanently impaired nor disabled.Â  The Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission upheld\r\n  the award of the single commissioner.Â  The circuit court affirmed.\r\nWorkForce appealed and\r\n  the court of appeals issued an unpublished opinion reversing.Â  Following a\r\n  petition for rehearing, the court of appeals withdrew its opinion and requested\r\n  certification under Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â \r\n  We granted certification. \r\nII.\r\nThe existence of an employment relationship is a\r\n  jurisdictional issue for purposes of workersâ€™ compensation benefits reviewable\r\n  under the preponderance of the evidence standard of review.Â  Glass v.

Jean Hoefer Toal et\r\n  al., Appellate Practice in South Carolina 170 (2d ed. 2002).\r\nWe\r\n  must determine if Brayboy was an employee at the time of his injury and thus\r\n  eligible for workersâ€™ compensation benefits.Â  Alewine v. Tobin Quarries,\r\n    Inc., 206 S.C. 103, 109, 33 S.E.2d 81, 83 (1945) (â€œNo award under the\r\n  [Workersâ€™ Compensation] Act is authorized unless the employer-employee\r\n  relationship existed at the time of the alleged injury for which claim is made.\r\n  Â This relation is contractual in character . . . .â€).Â  An employee is\r\n  statutorily defined in section 42-1-130 of the South Carolina Code (Supp. 2008)\r\n  as â€œevery person engaged in an employment under any appointment,\r\n  contract of hire, or apprenticeship, expressed or implied, oral or written . .\r\n  . .â€Â  Brayboy asserts his status as an employee as a result of the contract for\r\n  hire with WorkForce.Â  WorkForce relies on the principle that an employment\r\n  relationship may be vitiated when there is a material misrepresentation in the\r\n  employment contract.Â  Givens, 279 S.C. at 13, 301 S.E.2d\r\n  at 546.\r\n\r\n  In Cooper,\r\n    this Court set forth three necessary factors for a material misrepresentation\r\n    in the employment application to vitiate the employment relationship:\r\n  (1) The\r\n    employee must have knowingly and wilfully made a false representation as to his\r\n    physical condition.\r\n    (2) The\r\n    employer must have relied upon the false representation and this reliance must\r\n    have been a substantial factor in the hiring.\r\n    [and]\r\n    (3)\r\n    There must have been a causal connection between the false representation and\r\n    the injury.\r\n\r\n260 S.C. at 468, 196 S.E.2d\r\n  at 835.\r\nWe\r\n  are firmly convinced that WorkForce has established all three factors.Â  First,\r\n  Brayboy failed to report a host of prior back problems, as well as a prior\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation claim for an injury to his back.Â  The willful nature of\r\n  Brayboyâ€™s false responses pervades the record.Â  Brayboy admits he provided\r\n  false information on the employment application.Â  The suggestion that Brayboy could\r\n  make material misrepresentations on his employment application because he\r\n  believed he was fit for construction work is a specious position.\r\nTurning\r\n  to part two of the test, WorkForce presented credible evidence it relies\r\n  heavily on the employment application.Â  In this regard, WorkForceâ€™s reliance is\r\n  twofold: the employment application is important in the hiring and placement\r\n  decisions. Â Clearly, the questionnaire portion of the application protects the\r\n  employer and employee.Â  Had Brayboy given truthful information, WorkForce would\r\n  have been able to give him suitable job assignments, which would not have\r\n  included heavy lifting.Â  Even Brayboy at one point conceded the importance of\r\n  providing truthful information on the employment application when he stated,\r\n  â€œ[WorkForce] wouldnâ€™t want to put a person with impairments or disabilities on\r\n  a construction job that [he] couldnâ€™t handle.â€Â  We find WorkForce detrimentally\r\n  relied on Brayboyâ€™s fraudulent application.[1]Â  Small v. Oneita Indus., 318 S.C. 553,\r\n    554-55, 459 S.E.2d 306, 306-07 (1995) (noting an agent of the\r\n  employer testified Smallâ€™s prior injury would affect job placement decisions, not\r\n  hiring decisions, and affirming the denial of workersâ€™ compensation benefits\r\n  due to a false representation on an employment application).\r\nConcerning\r\n  the third factor, we find irrefutable evidence of a causal connection between\r\n  the false information and the aggravation of his pre-existing back injury.Â  Brayboy\r\n  conceded that the April 2003 injury was in â€œprimarily in the same areaâ€ as the 1996\r\n  cave-in injury.Â  The April 2003 injury is also directly linked to his military\r\n  disability, as evidenced by the VA raising Brayboyâ€™s disability rating from\r\n  twenty to forty percent as the â€œservice connected condition(s) has/have\r\n  worsened.â€\r\nPursuant\r\n  to Cooper, we hold Brayboyâ€™s fraudulent responses on his employment\r\n  application vitiated his employment relationship and barred his recovery of\r\n  workersâ€™ compensation benefits.\r\nREVERSED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] WorkForce provides temporary employment and,\r\n  therefore, a WorkForce employee may be assigned to various jobs during their\r\n  employment.Â  On the day of his alleged injury, Brayboy was assigned to heavy\r\n  labor, the very type of assignment WorkForce claims it would not have given Brayboy\r\n  had he been truthful in his employment application.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26676","title":"State v.

Â As Lyons confronted Neuman, he was\r\n  grabbed from behind by Andre Waters, another inmate.Â  During the struggle,\r\n  Neuman and Waters attempted to handcuff Lyons.Â  When Lyons asked the inmates\r\n  what they were doing, they responded â€œweâ€™re tryinâ€™ to get outta here.â€Â  \r\nOnce\r\n  the inmates successfully handcuffed Lyons, they took his keys and locked him in\r\n  a storage closet.Â  Approximately five minutes later, the inmates brought Tammy\r\n  Mason, another correctional officer, to the storage closet.Â  Mason testified\r\n  that during her count of the inmates around 1:30 a.m., she was accosted by\r\n  Neuman and Waters and then handcuffed before she was brought to the storage\r\n  closet.Â  Shortly thereafter, Neuman and Waters brought inmate Franklin Mackey,\r\n  who was visibly injured, to the storage closet. Â According to Mason, Mackey\r\n  made the comment that he was beaten up by Neuman and Waters. \r\nAfter approximately\r\n  thirty minutes, Neuman and Waters returned to the closet, opened the door, and\r\n  asked for medical assistance as they were severely injured as a result of their\r\n  attempted escape over razor wire surrounding the correctional facility.Â  Neuman\r\n  then took Lyons to a telephone where a call was made alerting other correctional\r\n  officers about the physical condition of Neuman and Waters.Â  The responding\r\n  officers then apprehended Neuman and Waters.\r\nAfter the incident, Neuman provided a statement to Investigator Jeff Bentley in which Neuman\r\n  admitted to his involvement in the incident with Waters. Â As part of the\r\n  investigation, it was discovered that Neumanâ€™s wife and a childhood friend of\r\n  Neumanâ€™s had attempted to aid Neuman in his escape.\r\nWaters testified\r\n  for the defense.Â  Prior to Neumanâ€™s trial, Waters had pled guilty to the\r\n  charges arising from the escape attempt.Â  According to Waters, it was his idea\r\n  to escape and that Neuman â€œdecided to come alongâ€ after helping Waters restrain\r\n  Lyons. Â Waters claimed he was the one who handcuffed Lyons and Mason and put\r\n  them in the storage closet before attempting to escape. \r\nDuring reply,\r\n  Investigator Bentley discounted Watersâ€™s testimony.Â  When Bentley interviewed\r\n  Waters the day of the incident, Waters claimed the escape was Neumanâ€™s idea and\r\n  they were both involved in restraining Lyons, Mason, and Mackey and locking\r\n  them in the storage closet. \r\nAfter the Stateâ€™s\r\n  case, Neumanâ€™s counsel moved for a directed verdict and made a motion to\r\n  dismiss the indictment for the taking of hostages by an inmate on\r\n  constitutional grounds.Â  At the close of the testimony, Neumanâ€™s counsel\r\n  renewed his motion.Â  The judge denied both of these motions. \r\nThe jury convicted Neuman of attempted escape and taking of hostages by an inmate.Â  Pursuant to\r\n  the recidivist statute,[3] the trial judge sentenced Neuman to life without parole for the hostage-taking\r\n  charge and a consecutive five-year sentence on the escape charge. \r\nNeuman appeals his\r\n  conviction for taking of hostages by an inmate.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nNeuman asserts the\r\n  trial judge erred in refusing to dismiss the taking of hostages by an inmate\r\n  charge on the ground section 24-13-450 is unconstitutionally vague.Â  Because\r\n  the statute does not include the word â€œunlawfully,â€ Neuman claims the statute\r\n  effectively criminalizes lawful activity.Â  Without the word â€œunlawfully,â€\r\n  Neuman contends the statute does not contain the â€œlanguage necessary to\r\n  narrowly tailor the statute to apply only to unlawful activity.â€ \r\nA.\r\nAs a threshold\r\n  issue, the State asserts Neumanâ€™s argument is not preserved for appellate\r\n  review because Neuman did not specifically rely on the void for vagueness\r\n  doctrine when he challenged section 24-13-450 at trial.Â  Because Neuman only\r\n  referenced the overbreadth doctrine in his trial argument, the State claims\r\n  Neuman did not preserve his argument for this Courtâ€™s review.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  trial, Neumanâ€™s counsel moved to dismiss the indictment for taking of hostages\r\n  by an inmate.Â  In making this motion, counsel argued:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  move to dismiss the prosecution based on this indictment of hostage taking as\r\n  the statute is overbroad (inaudible) objection the constitution is defective in\r\n  that it encompasses about 5 to 10 elements of other crimes making it almost\r\n  impossible to defend against constitutionally and we would move to dismiss the\r\n  indictment at this time based on its constitutional defect under the - - 4th,\r\n  5th, 6th, 8th and 14th amendments\r\n  of the United States Constitution and the applicable South Carolina statutes.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe trial judge\r\n  denied Neumanâ€™s motion to dismiss.Â  In his ruling, however, the judge recognized\r\n  that the statute â€œis unusual and it is very broad.â€Â  The judge also expressed\r\n  his concern that the statute did not include â€œan unlawful purpose of criminal\r\n  intent.â€Â  Based on this concern, the judge indicated that he would include in\r\n  his charge that there â€œhas to be an unlawful purpose.â€ Â Applying a â€œreasonable\r\n  construction,â€ the judge ultimately concluded that the statute was sufficient\r\n  for the State to prosecute Neuman. \r\nAlthough the State\r\n  is technically correct that Neuman did not specifically raise the vagueness\r\n  doctrine in his trial argument, we find this issue was sufficiently preserved\r\n  for this Courtâ€™s review.\r\nFirst, Neumanâ€™s\r\n  counselâ€™s use of the term â€œoverbroadâ€ is not necessarily dispositive.Â  Clearly,\r\n  a challenge to section 24-13-450 would not have been based on the overbreadth\r\n  doctrine. Â This statute could not conceivably suppress protected speech or\r\n  conduct.Â  Without such a First Amendment concern, the overbreadth doctrine\r\n  would not have been an appropriate ground to challenge the statute. Â See In re Amir X.S., 371 S.C. 380, 384, 639 S.E.2d 144, 146 (2006) (noting a\r\n  person raising a First Amendment overbreadth doctrine challenge to a statute\r\n  must demonstrate that the statute could cause someone to refrain from\r\n  constitutionally-protected expression); State v. Bouye, 325 S.C. 260,\r\n  265, 484 S.E.2d 461, 464 (1997) (â€œThe overbreadth doctrine applies only to\r\n  First Amendment cases where the challenged law would have a â€˜chilling effectâ€™\r\n  on constitutionally protected forms of speech.â€). \r\nSecondly,\r\n  a review of Neumanâ€™s counselâ€™s argument reveals that he listed multiple\r\n  constitutional amendments in an effort to challenge the statute as\r\n  constitutionally defective.Â  We find counselâ€™s assertions regarding the Fifth and\r\n  Fourteenth amendments, as well as his assertion that the statute was â€œalmost\r\n  impossible to defend,â€ necessarily included a due process challenge. Â In turn, these\r\n  arguments were sufficiently broad to incorporate the vagueness doctrine.Â  See Kurschner v. City of Camden Planning Commâ€™n, 376 S.C. 165, 171, 656\r\n  S.E.2d 346, 350 (2008) (â€œProcedural due process imposes constraints on\r\n  governmental decisions which deprive individuals of liberty or property\r\n  interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment of the United States\r\n  Constitution.â€); Guinyard v. State, 260 S.C. 220, 226, 195 S.E.2d 392,\r\n  394 (1973) (â€œThe concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the\r\n  constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and\r\n  proper standards for adjudication. Â The primary issues involved are whether the\r\n  provisions of a penal statute are sufficiently definite to give reasonable\r\n  notice of the prohibited conduct to those who wish to avoid its penalties and\r\n  to apprise judge and jury of standards for the determination of guilt. Â If the\r\n  statute is so obscure that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at\r\n  its meaning and differ as to its applicability, it is unconstitutional.â€\r\n  (citation omitted)).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the trial judge interpreted Neumanâ€™s counselâ€™s argument as one for vagueness.Â \r\n  In his ruling, the judge recognized the omission of the term â€œunlawfulâ€ in the\r\n  statute.Â  Thus, Neumanâ€™s appellate argument was sufficiently raised to and\r\n  ruled upon to be preserved for this Courtâ€™s review. Â See State v.\r\n    Nelson, 331 S.C. 1, 6 n. 6, 501 S.E.2d 716, 718 n. 6 (1998) (stating â€œthe\r\n  ultimate goal behind preservation of error rules is to insure that an issue raised on appeal has first been addressed to and ruled on by the trial courtâ€).\r\nB.\r\nHaving found that Neumanâ€™s argument is proper for appellate review, we now turn to the merits of Neumanâ€™s\r\n  constitutional challenge.\r\nâ€œThis Court has a limited scope of review in cases involving a\r\n  constitutional challenge to a statute because all statutes are presumed constitutional\r\n  and, if possible, will be construed to render them valid.â€Â  Curtis v.

Curtis, 356 S.C. 622, 629, 591 S.E.2d 600, 603 (2004).Â  This concept has\r\n  been explained as follows, â€œ[a] law is unconstitutionally vague if it forbids\r\n  or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that a person of common\r\n  intelligence must necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its\r\n  application.â€ Â Curtis v. State, 345 S.C. at 572, 549 S.E.2d at 598.Â \r\n  â€œOne to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to\r\n  challenge it for vagueness.â€Â  Id.\r\nInitially, we note that Neuman does not have standing\r\n  to challenge section 24-13-450 for vagueness.Â  As we view the evidence, Neumanâ€™s\r\n  conduct falls within even the most restrictive application of the statute.Â \r\n  Neuman, an inmate, admitted his culpability in acting in concert with Waters,\r\n  another inmate.Â  Both Correctional Officers Lyons and Mason testified that\r\n  Neuman physically assaulted them, handcuffed them, forced them into the\r\n  dayroom, and ultimately locked them inside a closet in an effort to escape from\r\n  prison.Â  In view of this evidence, we believe Neuman lacks standing to\r\n  challenge the constitutionality of the statute.Â  See State v. Michau,\r\n  355 S.C. 73, 77, 583 S.E.2d 756, 759 (2003) (concluding appellant lacked\r\n  standing to challenge statute as unconstitutionally vague given the statute\r\n  clearly applied to his conduct); In re Amir X.S., 371 S.C. at 392, 639\r\n  S.E.2d at 150 (finding appellant did not have standing to challenge statute on\r\n  grounds of vagueness where appellantâ€™s conduct fell within the most narrow\r\n  application of the statute).\r\nAt\r\n  oral argument, however, Neuman claimed that section 24-13-450 did not apply to\r\n  his conduct in that he did not hold the correctional officers as â€œhostagesâ€ as\r\n  that term is usually defined.[4]Â \r\n  Specifically, Neuman disputed that the incident at the McCormick Correctional\r\n  Institution constituted a hostage-taking situation. Â Given the confinement of\r\n  the correctional officers was not with intent of using the officers to secure\r\n  demands from a third party, Neuman claimed his conduct was akin to that of\r\n  kidnapping. Â Because the statute did not apply to his conduct, he contended he\r\n  has standing to challenge the constitutionality of section 24-13-450.Â  \r\nEven\r\n  if Neuman correctly interprets the term â€œhostage,â€ his argument does not negate\r\n  the fact that his conduct still fell within the purview of the statute.Â  As\r\n  previously stated, an inmate may be found guilty of taking of hostages by an\r\n  inmate if â€œacting alone or in concert with others, who by threats, coercion,\r\n  intimidation, or physical force takes, holds, decoys, or carries away any\r\n  person as a hostage or for any other reason whatsoever.â€ Â S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 24-13-450 (2007) (emphasis added). Â In view of this disjunctive\r\n  language, the correctional officers in the instant case did not necessarily\r\n  have to be hostages[5] for Neuman to be convicted of this offense.Â  Instead, Neuman could have been\r\n  found guilty if he had taken, held, decoyed, or carried away the officers â€œfor\r\n  any other reason whatsoever.â€Â  In this case, Neuman admitted he and Waters\r\n  detained the officers in an effort to escape the correctional facility.Â  Thus,\r\n  we find Neuman does not have standing because the statute at issue clearly\r\n  applied to his conduct.\r\nC.\r\nEven assuming that Neuman has standing, we hold section 24-13-450 is\r\n  not unconstitutionally vague. \r\nFirst, we find a person of ordinary intelligence and judgment would be\r\n  sufficiently apprised of conduct that would come within the purview of the\r\n  statute. Â Clearly, one who is incarcerated in a correctional facility is aware\r\n  of his status as an inmate and conduct the statute makes criminal.Â  Because an\r\n  inmate is undoubtedly cognizant of conduct that constitutes even minor\r\n  infractions in a correctional facility, it would be difficult to conceive that\r\n  an inmate would have to guess that taking someone by physical force, threats,\r\n  coercion or intimidation and holding them as a hostage or for any other reason would\r\n  not be conduct proscribed by section 24-13-450.\r\nSecondly,\r\n  the fact that the term â€œunlawfulâ€ is not referenced in section 24-13-450 does\r\n  not deem the statute unconstitutionally vague.Â  In support of his argument, Neuman compares section 24-13-450 with the kidnapping statute.[6]Â \r\n  Because the kidnapping statute includes the terms â€œunlawfullyâ€ and â€œwithout\r\n  authority of law,â€ Neuman avers the specific language of the kidnapping\r\n  statute, unlike section 24-13-450, excludes lawful activity.Â  Â Â \r\nIn support of this contention, Neuman relies on this Courtâ€™s decision\r\n  in State v. Smith, 275 S.C. 164, 268 S.E.2d 276 (1980).Â  In Smith,\r\n  this Court held the kidnapping statute was not unconstitutionally vague.Â  In so\r\n  holding, this Court stated, â€œ[t]he terms of [the kidnapping] statute are clear\r\n  and unambiguous.Â  It proscribes the forceful seizure, confinement or carrying\r\n  away of another against his will without authority of law.â€Â  Id. at 166,\r\n  268 S.E.2d at 277.\r\nComparing section\r\n  24-13-450 with the kidnapping statute, we find section 24-13-450 supersedes as\r\n  a specific statute the general criminal offense statute of kidnapping. Â See State v. Davis, 294 P.2d 934, 936 (Wash. 1956) (analyzing statutes\r\n  designated to define offenses chargeable to prisoners of penal institutions\r\n  with other offenses chargeable to â€œany person,â€ and concluding specific statute\r\n  relating to prisoners would â€œsupersede the kidnapping statute, if ever\r\n  applicable, in the situation where an inmate of a state penal institution holds\r\n  or participates in holding an officer of that institution as a hostage by force\r\n  or violence or the threat thereofâ€); see also Rainey v. State,\r\n  307 S.C. 150, 414 S.E.2d 131 (1992) (recognizing general principle that more\r\n  recent and specific legislation supersedes\r\n  prior general law); State v. Brown, 289 S.C. 581, 347 S.E.2d 882 (1986) (noting\r\n  laws giving specific treatment to a given situation take\r\n  precedence over general laws on same subject, and later legislation takes\r\n  precedence over earlier laws).\r\nMoreover,\r\n  a review of both statutes reveals that section 24-13-450 essentially\r\n  incorporates all of the elements of kidnapping but confines the proscribed\r\n  conduct to the limited environment of a correctional facility.Â  See State\r\n    v. East, 353 S.C. 634, 637, 578 S.E.2d 748, 750 (Ct. App. 2003) (â€œSouth\r\n  Carolinaâ€™s kidnapping statute requires proof of an unlawful act taking one of\r\n  several alternative forms, including seizure, confinement, inveiglement, decoy,\r\n  kidnapping, abduction, or carrying away.â€); see generally Don F. Vaccaro, Annotation, Seizure of Prison Official\r\n    By Inmates as Kidnapping, 59 A.L.R.3d 1306 (1974 &amp; Supp. 2008)\r\n  (discussing cases in which courts have consider the issue of whether and under what\r\n  circumstances the seizure of a prison official by the inmates of a penal\r\n  institution constitutes the offense of kidnapping).\r\nBecause section 24-13-450, which is part of Title 24 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code regulating â€œCorrections, Jails, Probations, Paroles and Pardons,â€\r\n  was intended to define offenses specific to prisoners of penal institutions,\r\n  the conduct proscribed in the statute is by implication unlawful. Â Davis, 294 P.2d at 937 (recognizing that â€œ[u]nless the intended victims of a\r\n  defendant who is an inmate of a state penal institution, and of his\r\n  co-conspirators, are officers of a state penal institution, [the statute] would\r\n  have no applicationâ€).\r\nNotably, statutes\r\n  from other jurisdictions which regulate the taking of a hostage by an inmate\r\n  also do not include the â€œunlawfulâ€ element.Â  See, e.g., Â Mass. Gen. Laws\r\n  Ann. ch. 127, Â§ 38A (2002) (â€œAny prisoner in any penal or reformatory\r\n  institution who holds any officer or employee of such institution or any other\r\n  person as a hostage shall be punished by imprisonment in the state prison for\r\n  not more than twenty years.â€); Mich. Comp. Laws Ann. Â§ 750.349a (2004) (â€œA\r\n  person imprisoned in any penal or correctional institution located in this\r\n  state who takes, holds, carries away, decoys, entices away or secretes another\r\n  person as a hostage by means of threats, coercion, intimidation or physical\r\n  force is guilty of a felony and shall be imprisoned in the state prison for\r\n  life, or any term of years, which shall be served as a consecutive sentence.â€);\r\n  Wash. Rev. Code Ann. Â§ 9.94.030 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2008) (â€œWhenever any inmate\r\n  of a correctional institution shall hold, or participate in holding, any person\r\n  as a hostage, by force or violence, or the threat thereof, or shall prevent, or\r\n  participate in preventing an officer of such institution from carrying out his\r\n  or her duties, by force or violence, or the threat thereof, he or she shall be\r\n  guilty of a class B felony and upon conviction shall be punished by\r\n  imprisonment in a state correctional institution for not less than one year nor\r\n  more than ten years.â€). \r\nFinally,\r\n  we believe a conclusion that section 24-13-450 is constitutional comports with\r\n  the legislative purpose underlying this statute.Â  The General Assembly properly\r\n  exercised its police power with the intention of protecting correctional officers\r\n  by promulgating a distinct offense applicable solely to inmates.Â  Cf. Guinyard,\r\n  260 S.C. at 226-228, 195 S.E.2d at 396 (finding statute prohibiting sexual\r\n  intercourse with a patient or trainee of mental health facility was neither\r\n  constitutionally vague nor defective despite Legislatureâ€™s failure to make\r\n  knowledge of the institutional status of the person molested an element of the\r\n  offense). \r\nAdditional support for this analysis may be seen in this Courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that the prison riot statute,[7] which is also included in Title 24 of the South Carolina Code and omits the\r\n  term â€œunlawful,â€ is not unconstitutionally vague.Â  See State v.\r\n    Greene, 255 S.C. 548, 560, 180 S.E.2d 179, 185 (1971) (holding â€œprison riot\r\n  statute,â€ the pre-cursor to section 24-13-430, was not unconstitutionally vague\r\n  in that it did not define the crime of â€œriotâ€ given the statute in question was\r\n  directed at prisoners and the common law offense of riot was well established\r\n  by judicial definition and, therefore, â€œunderstood by the ordinary manâ€). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe hold that section 24-13-450, proscribing conduct\r\n  for the offense of taking of hostages by an inmate, is not unconstitutionally\r\n  vague.Â  Accordingly, we affirm Neumanâ€™s conviction and sentence.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a\r\n  separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree that the issue whether the statute is void\r\n  for vagueness is preserved for our review since that is what the trial judge\r\n  believed was being argued, and that is what he ruled upon.Â  Moreover, I agree\r\n  that appellant lacks standing to challenge the statute because his conduct\r\n  clearly falls within its terms.Â  In re Amir X.S., 371 S.C. 380, 639\r\n  S.E.2d 144 (2006).Â  I would end the analysis here.Â  Id.Â  Finally, it is\r\n  well-settled that an issue, unless a claim of lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction, cannot be raised for the first time at oral argument.Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t of Soc. Serv. v. Basnight, 346 S.C. 241, 551 S.E.2d 274 (Ct. App.\r\n  2001).Â  I therefore do not join the remainder of the majorityâ€™s discussion.\r\nI concur in the\r\n  decision to affirm appellantâ€™s appeal. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Neuman was also convicted of attempted escape.Â  He\r\n  has not appealed this conviction or the consecutive five-year sentence.\r\n[2]Â Â  This section provides:\r\n\r\n\tAn\r\n  inmate of a state, county, or city correctional facility or a private entity\r\n  that contracts with a state, county, or city to provide care and custody of\r\n  inmates, including persons in safekeeper status, acting alone or in concert\r\n  with others, who by threats, coercion, intimidation, or physical force takes,\r\n  holds, decoys, or carries away any person as a hostage or for any other reason\r\n  whatsoever shall be deemed guilty of a felony and, upon conviction, shall be\r\n  imprisoned for a term of not less than five years nor more than thirty years.\r\n  This sentence shall not be served concurrently with any sentence being served\r\n  at the time the offense is committed.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  24-13-450 (2007).Â  \r\n[3]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2008).\r\n[4]Â  Although the trial judge in his ruling expressed\r\n  concern that the term â€œhostageâ€ was not defined in the statute, we note that\r\n  Neuman did not raise any argument at trial or in his brief challenging this\r\n  term.\r\n[5]Â  We note the term â€œhostageâ€ is not defined in section\r\n  24-13-450 or in any other statute within the South Carolina Code.Â  During oral\r\n  argument, Neuman asserted that â€œhostageâ€ should be narrowly defined as it has\r\n  been in other jurisdictions.Â  See, e.g., Ingle v. State, 746\r\n  N.E.2d 927, 937 (Ind. 2001) (holding â€œa consistent definition of hostage would\r\n  refer to one who is taken to secure some separate demand from another partyâ€); Jenkins\r\n    v. State, 248 S.W.3d 291, 297 (Tex. Crim. App. 2007) (concluding the term\r\n  â€œhostageâ€ within the aggravated kidnapping statute means â€œthe unlawful taking,\r\n  restraining or confining of a person with the intent that the person, or\r\n  victim, be held as security for the performance, or forbearance, of some act by\r\n  a third personâ€).Â  In contrast, the State argued that the term should be\r\n  broadly defined as it is generally understood.Â  Specifically, the State asserted â€œhostageâ€ should be defined as â€œone that is involuntarily controlled by an outside\r\n  influence.â€&nbsp; This definition may be found at http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hostage.\r\nBecause Neuman has\r\n  not claimed the evidence was insufficient to support his conviction,\r\n  particularly with respect to the hostage element, we decline at this juncture\r\n  to adopt a definition of â€œhostageâ€ within the context of section 24-13-450. \r\n[6]Â Â  Section 16-3-910 provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhoever\r\n  shall unlawfully seize, confine, inveigle, decoy, kidnap, abduct or carry away\r\n  any other person by any means whatsoever without authority of law, except when\r\n  a minor is seized or taken by his parent, is guilty of a felony and, upon\r\n  conviction, must be imprisoned for a period not to exceed thirty years unless\r\n  sentenced for murder as provided in Section 16-3-20.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  16-3-910 (2003). \r\n[7]Â Â  Section 24-13-430 provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\tAny\r\n  inmate of the Department of Corrections, city or county jail, or public works\r\n  of any county that participates in a riot or any other acts or violence shall\r\n  be deemed guilty of a felony and upon conviction shall be imprisoned for not\r\n  less than five years nor more than ten years.\r\n\r\nS.C.

Elliott, and Assistant Attorney General Karen\r\n  Ratigan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Petitioner Craig Rolen\r\n  pled guilty to voluntary manslaughter and was sentenced to twenty-five years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  Petitioner filed an application for post-conviction relief (PCR)\r\n  alleging that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to withdraw his\r\n  guilty plea.Â  The PCR court denied relief.Â  This Court granted a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review that decision. \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nOn October 4, 2001, Kedrick Mahonâ€™s (Victim)\r\n  decomposed body was found in Petitionerâ€™s car at the bottom of a ravine.Â \r\n  Petitioner was arrested for Victimâ€™s murder on July 16, 2003.[1]Â \r\n  In September 2004, Petitioner contacted police and confessed to the murder and\r\n  was subsequently charged.\r\nPetitioner\r\n  requested a trial and a jury was selected.Â  However, immediately before trial,\r\n  Petitioner decided to plead guilty.Â  At the plea hearing, the solicitor told\r\n  the plea judge that Petitioner confessed to stabbing the victim and driving the\r\n  car into the ravine.Â  Petitioner told the plea judge that he voluntarily made\r\n  the confession and admitted to committing the murder.Â  The plea judge formally accepted\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s plea as voluntary and having a substantial factual basis.Â  After\r\n  members of Victimâ€™s family addressed the court, Petitioner suddenly exclaimed: \r\n\r\n\tAll\r\n  right, this has went on far enough, I didnâ€™t kill this man.Â  This has went too\r\n  far, I ainâ€™t doing this.Â  I didnâ€™t kill your brother . . . I didnâ€™t kill this\r\n  man, I canâ€™t do this . . . I donâ€™t know who did, I wish I did . . . I swear to\r\n  God I didnâ€™t do it . . .Â  Should have never pled guilty, I didnâ€™t do this.\r\n\r\nCounsel did not move to\r\n  withdraw the plea, and the plea judge sentenced Petitioner to twenty-five years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Petitioner testified that the State previously offered him a\r\n  deal to plead guilty to accessory after the fact to murder with a ten-year cap,\r\n  but he turned down the offer because he was innocent.Â  He testified he was\r\n  depressed, suicidal, and heavily medicated at the time he gave his confession\r\n  to police and that he confessed in hopes of receiving the death penalty.Â \r\n  Petitioner stated that he pled guilty because counsel told him that the jury\r\n  that had been impaneled would likely find him guilty.Â  Finally, Petitioner\r\n  testified that counsel did not inform him of his right to appeal his guilty\r\n  plea.\r\nCounsel\r\n  testified that he requested a competency test for Petitioner because he was\r\n  concerned about Petitionerâ€™s mental state and that Petitioner attempted to\r\n  commit suicide following the test.[2]Â \r\n  Counsel stated that he did not move to withdraw the plea because he believed\r\n  once the plea was accepted, it was final and could not be withdrawn.Â  Counsel\r\n  testified that he did not recall whether he discussed Petitionerâ€™s appellate\r\n  rights with him.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  PCR court found that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to withdraw\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  The PCR court also found that counsel informed\r\n  Petitioner of his right to appeal, but regardless, counsel was under no\r\n  obligation to advise Petitioner of his right to appeal.Â  Accordingly, the PCR\r\n  court denied Petitioner relief.\r\nThis Court granted\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari, and Petitioner presents the\r\n  following issues for review:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in ruling\r\n  that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move to withdraw Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  guilty plea?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid the PCR court err in ruling Petitioner\r\n  was not entitled to a belated direct appeal?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe burden of proof is on the applicant in post-conviction\r\n  proceedings to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On appeal, the PCR courtâ€™s ruling should be upheld if it\r\n  is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI. Withdrawal of Guilty Plea\r\nPetitioner argues that the\r\n  PCR court erred in ruling that counsel was not ineffective for failing to move\r\n  to withdraw Petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  order for a defendant to knowingly and voluntarily plead guilty, he must have a\r\n  full understanding of the consequences of his plea. Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238, 241 (1969).Â  A defendant who enters a plea on the advice of\r\n  counsel may only attack the voluntary and intelligent character of a plea by\r\n  showing that counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective standard of\r\n  reasonableness and that there is a reasonable probability that, but for\r\n  counselâ€™s errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty, but would have\r\n  insisted on going to trial. Â Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985).Â  When determining issues relating to guilty pleas, the Court\r\n  will consider the entire record, including the transcript of the guilty plea,\r\n  and the evidence presented at the PCR hearing.Â  Anderson v. State, 342\r\n  S.C. 54, 57, 535 S.E.2d 649, 657 (2000).Â  \r\nWe find that counsel was deficient in failing to move to withdraw\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  Petitioner requested a jury trial and only decided\r\n  to plead guilty after counsel advised him that the impaneled jury would likely\r\n  find him guilty.Â  Petitioner repeatedly asserted his innocence during the plea\r\n  hearing before the plea judge sentenced him.Â  In our view, at this point in the\r\n  hearing, it was clear that Petitioner wanted to withdraw his guilty plea.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  counsel was deficient in failing to move to withdraw Petitionerâ€™s guilty plea,\r\n  we must determine whether Petitioner was prejudiced by counselâ€™s performance.Â  The\r\n  plea judge had formally accepted the guilty plea prior to Petitionerâ€™s\r\n  protestation of his innocence.Â  Therefore, even if counsel had\r\n  moved to withdraw the guilty plea, the plea judge may have denied this request,\r\n  and Petitioner could not have proceeded to trial.Â  See State v. Riddle, 278\r\n  S.C. 148, 150, 292 S.E.2d 795, 796 (1982) (holding that the withdrawal of a guilty plea is\r\n  generally within the sound discretion of the trial court).Â  In this way, the prejudice analysis\r\n  in this case does not fit squarely within the traditional guilty plea prejudice\r\n  framework as set forth in Hill.Â  Nonetheless, we hold that\r\n  Petitioner was prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient performance because due\r\n  to counselâ€™s failure to make such a motion, the plea judge was not able to\r\n  exercise his discretion.Â  Even if the plea judge had denied Petitionerâ€™s motion\r\n  to withdraw his plea, Petitioner could have raised this issue on direct appeal.Â \r\n  Moreover, Petitioner proved he would have insisted on going to trial had the\r\n  plea judge granted the motion to withdraw.Â  \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold that counsel was ineffective for failing to move to withdraw\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  However, we find that granting Petitioner the relief\r\n  of an entire new plea hearing is inappropriate.Â  Once the plea judge found that\r\n  Petitionerâ€™s plea was voluntary and supported by a factual basis and formally\r\n  accepted the plea of guilt, Petitioner forfeited his ability to withdraw the\r\n  plea as a matter of right.Â  State v. Bickham, Op. No. 26581 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed Jan. 12, 2009) (Shearouse Adv.Sh. No.2 at 43) (Kittredge, J., concurring).Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we remand the case to the point in the guilty plea proceeding in which counsel\r\n  should have sought to withdraw the plea.Â  Â Â In our view, this tailored relief\r\n  remedies the precise prejudice resulting from plea counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance.[3]Â  See United States v. Morrison, 449 U.S. 361, 364 (1981) (recognizing that the remedy for a violation of the Sixth Amendment right to counsel\r\n  â€œshould be tailored to the injury suffered from the constitutional violation and should not unnecessarily infringe on competing interestsâ€).Â  Â \r\nII. Belated Direct Appeal\r\nPetitioner\r\n  argues that the PCR court erred in\r\n  ruling he was not entitled to a belated direct appeal.Â  We decline to address\r\n  this issue.Â  \r\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, there is no constitutional\r\n  requirement that a defendant be informed of the right to a direct appeal from a\r\n  guilty plea, and the bare assertion that a defendant was not advised of\r\n  appellate rights is insufficient to grant relief.Â  Weathers v.\r\n    State, 319 S.C. 59, 61, 459 S.E.2d 838,\r\n  839 (1995).Â  Instead, there must be\r\n  proof that extraordinary circumstances exist, such as where a defendant\r\n  inquires about an appeal, in order for counsel to be required to advise a\r\n  defendant of the right to appeal.Â  Id.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  decline to rule on whether the PCR court erred in finding that Petitioner was\r\n  not entitled to a belated direct appeal.Â  Had Petitioner filed a direct appeal,\r\n  any issues regarding withdrawal of the guilty plea would not have been\r\n  preserved for the appellate courtâ€™s review because counsel never made such a\r\n  motion.Â  Additionally, as stated above, we hold that counsel was ineffective\r\n  for failing to make a motion to withdraw, and thus, the most appropriate relief\r\n  is a new plea hearing.Â  Because we find that a belated direct appeal would not\r\n  afford Petitioner suitable relief, a ruling from the Court on this matter would\r\n  have no practical effect.Â  See Seabrook\r\n    v. Knox, 369\r\n  S.C. 191, 197, 631 S.E.2d 907, 910 (2006)\r\n  (recognizing that this Court will not decide\r\n  questions in which a judgment rendered will have no practical legal effect).Â  \r\n\r\n  Conclusion\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order denying relief and remand the case to\r\n  the point after formal acceptance of the guilty plea.Â  If the plea court grants\r\n  the motion to withdraw the plea, the case shall be placed on the trial docket\r\n  and proceed in the usual manner; if the court denies the motion to withdraw the\r\n  plea, the prior sentence will stand, and Petitioner may pursue his right to a\r\n  direct appeal.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWALLER, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  We granted certiorari to\r\n  review a post-conviction relief (PCR) order denying petitionerâ€™s claim that his\r\n  trial counsel was ineffective in failing to move to withdraw petitionerâ€™s\r\n  plea.Â  Since the question of â€œineffectivenessâ€ embraces both deficient\r\n  performance and prejudice, we err if we decline to make a finding on both\r\n  prongs.Â  I would find no prejudice, and affirm.\r\nWhere an applicant\r\n  claims his guilty plea counsel was ineffective, that applicant bears the burden\r\n  of showing both that counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that the deficient\r\n  performance resulted in prejudice, that is, it affected the outcome of the plea\r\n  process.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52 (1985).Â  Ordinarily â€œprejudiceâ€\r\n  is established by evidence that had counsel not been deficient, there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that the applicant would not have pled guilty but would\r\n  instead have insisted on going to trial.[4]Â  Id.Â  As the Hill Court recognized, a determination of prejudice\r\n  in this context will depend on the likelihood that had counsel done that which\r\n  the applicant asserts he should have, counselâ€™s act would have been successful,\r\n  i.e., had counsel investigated, he would have found evidence causing him to\r\n  change his advice to plead guilty.Â  The Court acknowledged that in judging\r\n  prejudice, it was necessary to make objective â€œpredictions of the outcome at a\r\n  possible trial.â€Â  Id. at 59-60.\r\nSpeculation is a\r\n  necessary component of most PCR cases since prejudice is judged by the\r\n  â€œreasonable probabilityâ€ standard: would the jury have acquitted had it not\r\n  heard the improper evidence?Â  Would the trial judge have suppressed the\r\n  evidence had a suppression motion been made?Â  Where, as here, counselâ€™s\r\n  deficiency is the failure to request some form of relief committed to the trial\r\n  judgeâ€™s discretion, the PCR applicant establishes prejudice by demonstrating\r\n  that had the request been made, it would have been an abuse of discretion to\r\n  have denied it.Â  E.g., Wolfe v. State, 326 S.C. 158, 485 S.E.2d\r\n  367 (1997) (continuance).\r\nHere, the majority\r\n  holds counsel was deficient in failing to make a motion to withdraw\r\n  petitionerâ€™s plea.Â  It acknowledges that whether to grant such a request lies\r\n  in the plea judgeâ€™s discretion.Â  The Court then declines to decide whether\r\n  petitioner has shown the requisite prejudice - i.e., whether it would have been\r\n  an abuse of discretion to have denied the motion if made.Â  Instead, the\r\n  majority appears to create a new standard of prejudice: counsel renders\r\n  ineffective assistance when she neglects to preserve an issue, whether or not\r\n  that issue has merit, for direct appeal.Â  Under this standard, the remedy is\r\n  not a new proceeding, but instead a rewind,[5] returning all characters to the point in the guilty plea when petitioner\r\n  maintains the motion to withdraw should have been made.Â  Among the unanswered\r\n  questions raised by this extraordinary remedy,[6] is whether, henceforth, a PCR judge who finds deficient performance will be\r\n  able to avoid the prejudice issue by remanding the matter to criminal court.\r\nThe majority goes\r\n  on to hold that if the motion is made and then denied, petitioner may appeal\r\n  from this ruling made in the new proceeding.Â  While ordinarily the State would\r\n  not be able to appeal the granting of a motion to withdraw a guilty plea made\r\n  in the plea proceeding, I question whether such an appeal would lie from a\r\n  ruling on remand. \r\nOn the merits, I\r\n  agree that counsel was deficient when she failed to move to withdraw\r\n  petitionerâ€™s guilty plea.Â  I do not find the requisite prejudice, however,\r\n  since I do not find a reasonable probability that had such a motion been made\r\n  it would have been granted.Â  First, had the plea judge believed the integrity\r\n  of the plea was in question, he should have sua sponte refused to\r\n  continue.Â  In my view, it is more likely that he viewed petitionerâ€™s outburst\r\n  as unfortunate but not unusual.Â  Since I find no prejudice from counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance, I would affirm the order denying petitionerâ€™s PCR\r\n  application.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Petitioner testified at the PCR hearing that after he was arrested on the\r\n  murder charges, he was released on bond and placed on house arrest.\r\n[2] Petitioner was found competent to stand trial.\r\n[3] We disagree with the dissentâ€™s assertion that we are creating a new standard of\r\n  prejudice or that this tailored relief is an extraordinary remedy.Â  Rather, we\r\n  have merely provided a remedy for what we find, under the specific facts of\r\n  this case, to be ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  See Morrison, at\r\n  365 (noting that the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s â€œapproach has thus been to\r\n  identify and then neutralize the taint by tailoring relief appropriate in the\r\n  circumstances to assure the defendant the effective assistance of counselâ€); see\r\n    also Davie v. State (holding plea counsel was ineffective for failing\r\n  to communicate a plea offer and crafting specific relief to remedy the\r\n  violation).\r\n[4] A different prejudice analysis is appropriate where, for example, the\r\n  ineffective assistance claim is that plea counsel failed to communicate a plea\r\n  offer.Â  Davie v. State, 381 S.C. 601, 675 S.E.2d 416 (2009).Â  \r\n[5] Although characterized as a remand, such a remand is not possible since the\r\n  matter before us is a civil action brought in the Court of Common Pleas, and\r\n  the â€œremandâ€ would be to a long-concluded proceeding in the Court of General\r\n  Sessions.\r\n[6] While the United States Supreme Court has held that in a direct appeal raising\r\n  a claim of a 6th amendment violationÂ  the relief must be tailored\r\n  based upon the violation, the Court still required the defendant demonstrate prejudice\r\n  in order to receive relief in her criminal proceeding.Â  United States v.

Rosemond, 335 S.C. 593,\r\n    598, 518 S.E.2d 588, 590 (1999). Â Rosemond then filed a PCR\r\n  application.Â  The PCR court ordered Dr. Pamela Crawford to evaluate Rosemond,\r\n  and Dr. Crawford diagnosed Rosemond with schizophrenia, paranoid type.Â \r\n  Subsequently, the PCR court stayed the PCR proceedings due to Rosemondâ€™s\r\n  incompetence.Â  Currently, Rosemond remains incompetent.\r\nDespite Rosemondâ€™s incompetency,\r\n  the PCR proceeding continued in response to this Courtâ€™s ruling in Council v. Catoe, 359 S.C. 120,\r\n    129, 597 S.E.2d 782, 787 (2004) (â€œ[W]e hold that a petitioner\r\n  cannot delay his collateral review of his trial proceedings due to his\r\n  incompetency. Â If, at a future date, the petitioner regains his competency and\r\n  discovers that at his original PCR hearing, his incompetency prevented his\r\n  ability to assist his counsel on a fact-based claim of ineffective assistance\r\n  of counsel, he may then raise that claim in a subsequent proceeding.â€).\r\nThe PCR court\r\n  denied relief on all grounds and further acknowledged Rosemondâ€™s continued\r\n  incompetency.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s denial\r\n  of relief.\r\nII.\r\nRosemond argues the denial of PCR relief was improper\r\n  for a multitude of reasons.Â  We first address trial\r\n  counselâ€™s opening statement and the alleged ex parte contact as these\r\n  arguments affect the guilt phase as well as the sentencing phase.\r\nA. Opening Statement\r\nRosemond\r\n  alleges the PCR court erred in finding no prejudice resulted from inappropriate\r\n  comments in counselâ€™s opening statement.Â  We disagree.\r\nDuring\r\n  trial counselâ€™s opening statement, counsel told the jury that some of the jury\r\n  members were selected because they â€œwere whatever was left.â€Â  At the PCR\r\n  hearing, trial counsel acknowledged the comments were inappropriate and explained\r\n  the statements were made out of frustration over the racial composition of the\r\n  jury.Â  Counselâ€™s remarks constituted deficient representation.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  transition to the second prong of the Strickland test to\r\n  determine whether prejudice occurred.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668,\r\n    687 (1984).Â  No prejudice occurred in\r\n  the guilt phase as the State presented overwhelming evidence of guilt:\r\n  Rosemondâ€™s confession and the murder weapon, which Rosemond helped the police\r\n  locate.Â  Further, in his confession, Rosemond admitted to planning the murder\r\n  of his girlfriend.\r\nSimilarly,\r\n  Rosemond was not prejudiced by trial counselâ€™s opening statement during the\r\n  sentencing phase of his trial.Â  First, the opening argument was made on March\r\n  23, 1996, and the jury made its sentencing recommendation on March 30, 1996.Â \r\n  Additionally, following the sentencing phase, the jury deliberated\r\n  approximately eleven hours over two days before recommending a sentence of\r\n  death.Â  Significantly, the jury notified the trial court of its difficulty\r\n  reaching a decision, which resulted in an Allen charge.Â  It is apparent the jury\r\n  discharged its duties in good faith and did not penalize Rosemond for his counselâ€™s\r\n  improper comments at the beginning of the guilt phase.Â  Rosemond suffered no\r\n  prejudice.Â  We find evidence supports the PCR courtâ€™s determination that\r\n  Rosemond is not entitled to relief on this ground.\r\nB. Ex Parte Communication\r\nRosemond\r\n  next argues he is entitled to PCR because the Solicitor â€œchoseâ€ the judge to\r\n  preside over Rosemondâ€™s trial and met with the judge to confirm his willingness\r\n  to serve.Â  We disagree.Â  Former Chief Justice Finney assigned the trial judge\r\n  to this case in February 1996.[1]Â \r\n  We reviewed the record and find the able trial judge presided over this case in\r\n  a fair and impartial manner.\r\nIII.\r\nNext, Rosemond\r\n  argues the PCR court erred in denying relief due to the complete lack of mitigation\r\n  evidence in the sentencing phase.Â  We agree.\r\nDuring the PCR hearing, trial counsel testified he did not present\r\n  evidence of Rosemondâ€™s alleged mental illness as a mitigating factor because\r\n  the trial court found Rosemond competent to stand trial.Â  Trial counsel mistakenly\r\n  believed the ruling precluded him from presenting Rosemondâ€™s mental health\r\n  mitigation evidence in the sentencing phase.Â  Counselâ€™s erroneous belief\r\n  clearly constituted deficient representation.Â  We turn to the prejudice prong\r\n  of Strickland.\r\nWhen\r\n  determining if want of mitigation evidence resulted in prejudice, we must\r\n  determine whether the â€œmitigating\r\n  evidence, taken as a whole, â€˜might well have influenced the juryâ€™s appraisalâ€™\r\n  of [the defendantâ€™s] culpability.â€Â  Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510,\r\n    538 (2003) (quoting Williams v. Taylor, 529 U.S. 362, 398 (2000)); see also Rompilla v. Beard, 545 U.S. 374, 393 (2005).Â  In this\r\n  regard, the United States Supreme Court held, â€œthe likelihood of a different\r\n  result if the [mitigation] evidence had gone in is â€˜sufficient to undermine\r\n  confidence in the outcomeâ€™ actually reached at sentencing.â€Â  Rompilla, 545 U.S. at\r\n    393 (quoting Strickland, 466 U.S. at\r\n      694).Â  Accordingly, if trial counselâ€™s complete failure to\r\n  present mitigation evidence undermines confidence in the outcome, then Rosemond\r\n  suffered prejudice.\r\nWe find\r\n  this case analogous to our recent holding in Council v. State, 380 S.C. 159,\r\n    181, 670 S.E.2d 356, 368 (2008), in which this Court upheld the PCR courtâ€™s grant of a new sentencing\r\n  trial.Â  In Council, only very\r\n  limited mitigation testimony was presented and no medical evidence was\r\n  presented.Â  Id. at 177, 670 S.E.2d at 365.Â \r\n  Thus, this Court held, â€œthere was very strong mitigating evidence to be weighed\r\n  against the [six] aggravating circumstances presented by the State.Â  We\r\n  believe, as did the PCR judge, this evidence may well have influenced the\r\n  juryâ€™s assessment of [Councilâ€™s] culpability.â€Â  Id. at 176, 670 S.E.2d\r\n  at 365.Â  Similarly, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit\r\n  concluded, â€œâ€˜had the jury been able to place [mental disturbance] on the\r\n  mitigating side of the scale, there is a reasonable probability that at least\r\n  one juror would have struck a different balance.â€™â€Â  Gray v. Branker, 529\r\n  F.3d 220, 238 (4th Cir. 2008) (quoting Wiggins, 539 U.S. at 537).\r\nIn the case before us, we need not speculate about the mitigation evidence\r\n  known by trial counsel as the evidence was presented during pretrial competency\r\n  hearings.Â  At one competency hearing,[2] Dr. Harold Morgan testified Rosemond was â€œclearly paranoid.â€Â  Dr. Morgan\r\n  described Rosemondâ€™s behavior during the interview as â€œvery evasive from the\r\n  beginning, very guarded, very distant, very aloof, sort of exuding tension and\r\n  fear and hostility.â€Â  Rosemond eventually terminated the interview with Dr.\r\n  Morgan.\r\nAt the\r\n  same competency hearing, Dr. Shea testified he learned Rosemondâ€™s brother was a\r\n  paranoid schizophrenic and Rosemond scored an 84 on his I.Q. test, which is in the\r\n  low average range.Â  Dr. Shea, after many tests and interviews, testified,\r\n  â€œ[i]tâ€™s my belief that Mr. Rosemond has some sort of a paranoid process going\r\n  on.Â  Iâ€™m having a very difficult time making an exact diagnosis, because, quite\r\n  frankly, he wonâ€™t -- he wonâ€™t discuss things with me to the extent that I need\r\n  to make an accurate diagnosis.â€Â  Dr. Shea described Rosemondâ€™s behavior as\r\n  â€œeven more oddâ€ and progressively worsening.Â  Dr. Sheaâ€™s working diagnosis of\r\n  Rosemond was he suffered from a delusional disorder or schizophrenia.\r\nIn a\r\n  subsequent competency hearing, Dr. Schwartz-Watts of the Department of Mental Health\r\n  testified she, Dr. Donald Morgan, and Dr. Geoffrey McKee evaluated Rosemond,\r\n  and Dr. Schwartz-Watts believed him competent to stand trial.Â  Dr. Shea agreed\r\n  at this second competency hearing that Rosemond was competent to stand trial\r\n  but reiterated Rosemond suffers from paranoia.\r\nDuring\r\n  the PCR hearing, Dr. Shea testified about a conversation with Dr.\r\n  Schwartz-Watts, in which Dr. Schwartz-Watts stated Rosemond may have pulled\r\n  himself together to appear competent.Â  Further, according to Dr. Shea, Dr. Schwartz-Watts\r\n  believed Rosemond may have been exhibiting the early stages of schizophrenia.Â \r\n  Dr. Schwartz-Watts agreed to testify to her belief, and Dr. Shea passed this\r\n  information on to trial counsel.\r\nEvidence\r\n  of Rosemondâ€™s purported mental illness was, therefore, available for the\r\n  sentencing phase.Â  However, trial counsel only called five witnesses, none of\r\n  whom made any reference to Rosemondâ€™s mental health issues: Rosemondâ€™s father,\r\n  Rosemondâ€™s pastor, two family friends, and Dr. Shea.\r\nRosemondâ€™s father testified Rosemond was a â€œgood\r\n  boy.â€Â  Rosemondâ€™s pastor stated Rosemond belongs to a â€œwholesome, functional\r\n  family.â€Â  The family friends described Rosemond as obedient, intelligent, and\r\n  respected and asked the jury to have mercy.Â  Lastly, Dr. Shea testified in a\r\n  conclusory manner that Rosemond could adjust to prison.Â  On cross-examination,\r\n  Dr. Shea agreed he had not diagnosed Rosemond with a mental illness.Â  In sum, no evidence was presented to the jury\r\n  concerning Rosemondâ€™s troubling mental health issues.Â  In fact, the theme of\r\n  the evidence was the absence of any mental health concerns, for the evidence\r\nconsistently portrayed Rosemond as a â€œgood boy.â€\r\nRosemondâ€™s\r\n  competence to stand trial in no manner precluded his counsel from presenting\r\n  the mental illness information that was known.Â  As no evidence of Rosemondâ€™s known\r\n  mental health issues was presented, we reject the Stateâ€™s efforts to portray\r\n  Rosemondâ€™s position as merely wanting to present a â€œfancier mitigationâ€ case.Â  Jones\r\n    v. State, 332 S.C. 329, 339, 504 S.E.2d 822, 827 (1998) (affirming the\r\n  denial of PCR finding Jones merely sought\r\n  a â€œfancierâ€ presentation of mitigation evidence).\r\nGiven\r\n  the juryâ€™s struggle during the sentencing phase and the want of any mental\r\n  health mitigation evidence, we hold the known evidence of Rosemondâ€™s mental\r\n  health issues â€œâ€˜might well have influenced the juryâ€™s appraisalâ€™ of\r\n  culpability.â€Â  Rompilla, 545 U.S. at\r\n    393.Â  As a result, Rosemond was prejudiced, as we find\r\n  confidence in the outcome is substantially undermined.Â  Thus, we reverse the\r\n  denial of PCR on this issue and remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.\r\nIV.\r\nIn\r\n  light of Rosemondâ€™s entitlement to a new sentencing hearing, we need not\r\n  address the remaining assignment of errors concerning the sentencing phase.Â  Hughes v. State, 367 S.C. 389, 409, 626 S.E.2d 805, 815 (2006) (holding appellate\r\n  court need not reach remaining issues when addressed issues are dispositive).Â  We nevertheless elect to address Rosemondâ€™s challenge to trial\r\n  counselâ€™s failure to object to the trial court instructing the jury not to recommend\r\n  a sentence of life based on mercy: â€œyou may recommend\r\n  a sentence of life imprisonment for any reason or for no reason at all other\r\n    than as an act of mercy.â€ (emphasis added).Â  We agree with Rosemond and hold that if a plea for mercy is admitted in evidence, then a jury should be\r\n  entitled to consider it.\r\nIn State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45,\r\n  51, 406 S.E.2d 315, 318-19 (1991), this Court held a defendant\r\n  may present witnesses to ask for mercy in the sentencing phase.Â  Further, our\r\n  case law requires a trial court to instruct a jury it may impose a life\r\n  sentence even if it finds a statutory aggravating circumstance.Â  State v.\r\n    Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 218-19, 499 S.E.2d 209, 215 (1998).\r\nDuring\r\n  the sentencing phase, the testimony of two family friends was properly admitted\r\n  and these witnesses asked the jury for mercy.Â  In contrast, the trial court\r\n  then instructed the jury to discount such pleas by instructing the jury that it\r\n  could not recommend a life sentence based on the evidence of mercy.Â  Notably, the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s jury instruction mirrored the instruction found proper subsequent\r\n  to Rosemondâ€™s trial in State v. Hughey, 339 S.C. 439, 459, 529 S.E.2d 721,\r\n  731 (2000).Â  We overrule Hughey to the extent it approved and sanctioned\r\n  the charge given here.\r\nIt\r\n  is proper to instruct a jury in a capital sentencing phase that it may\r\n  recommend a life sentence for any reason or no reason at all, including as an\r\n  act of mercy.Â  A juryâ€™s consideration of mercy, if proper evidence of mercy is\r\n  admitted, is well recognized in the sentencing phase of a capital case.Â  Because\r\n  a capital jury may consider properly admitted evidence of mercy in the\r\n  sentencing phase, consideration of mercy is not inconsistent with the instruction\r\n  that â€œthe jury should not be guided by sympathy, prejudice, passion, or public\r\n  opinion . . . .â€Â  State v. Singleton, 284 S.C. 388, 393, 326 S.E.2d 153,\r\n  156 (1985) overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45,\r\n  69 n.5, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 n.5 (1991).\r\nV.\r\nDue to the\r\n  overwhelming evidence of guilt and want of prejudice, we affirm the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  denial of relief regarding the assignment of errors related to the guilt phase\r\n  of Rosemondâ€™s trial.Â  We reverse the PCR court and hold Rosemond established\r\n  his entitlement to a new sentencing hearing as a result of trial counselâ€™s\r\n  failure to present any mental health mitigation evidence in the sentencing\r\n  phase. Â We remand the case for a new sentencing hearing.[3] Â We overrule State v. Hughey to the extent it approved the\r\n  instruction that precluded a capital juryâ€™s consideration of mercy evidence in\r\n  the sentencing phase.\r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] We\r\n  acknowledge the practice of the prosecutor selecting the trial judge is\r\n  inappropriate and troubling.Â  We further note this alleged practice is no\r\n  longer possible, as the Chief Justice of the South Carolina Supreme Court makes\r\n  judicial assignments in death penalty cases in conjunction with Court\r\nAdministration.\r\n[2] A\r\ncompetency hearing is, of course, conducted outside the presence of the jury.\r\n[3] As noted, Rosemond is currently not competent.Â \r\n  A new sentencing hearing is contingent on Rosemond regaining competency.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26680","title":"Sojourner v.

Code Ann. Â§ 5-31-620 (2004) (the â€œElection Provisionâ€)\r\n  requires that an election be held prior to acquiring or disposing of a public\r\n  utility and that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-31-640 (2004) (the â€œFreeholder Provisionâ€)\r\n  requires that twenty-five percent of the resident freeholders of the\r\n  municipality petition the municipality before an election may be held.Â  Sojourner\r\n  argued that Respondentsâ€™ agreement to sell was in violation of the law because\r\n  there was no written petition from any residents, qualified registered\r\n  electors, or freeholders within the Town submitted to the Town Council or to\r\n  any other public authority in the Town or County requesting an election on this\r\n  matter.Â  \r\nRespondents\r\n  countered that the Freeholder Provision is unconstitutional because it\r\n  restricts the voting rights of the Townâ€™s electors and their elected\r\n  representatives in violation of the Equal Protection Clauses of the United\r\n  States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution.Â  Respondents further\r\n  argued that the Freeholder Provision is inextricably intertwined with the\r\n  Election Provision, and that both sections are therefore unconstitutional and\r\n  unenforceable.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  January 14, 2009, the Master-In-Equity issued an order in favor of\r\n  Respondents.Â  The Master declared The Freeholder Provision unconstitutional as\r\n  violative of the Equal Protection Clause, declared the Election Provision\r\n  unconstitutional because it was inextricably intertwined with the unlawful\r\n  Freeholder Provision, and held that Respondentsâ€™ agreement was valid pursuant\r\n  to authority granted to local governments by the Home Rule Act of 1975.\r\nSojourner\r\n  appealed the Masterâ€™s decision and presents the following questions for this\r\n  Courtâ€™s review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Master err in declaring\r\n  the Freeholder Provision unconstitutional on the grounds that it is an unlawful\r\n  restriction on voting rights in violation of the Equal Protection Clause? \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.&nbsp;\r\n    Did the Master err in declaring\r\n  the Election Provision unconstitutional on the grounds that it is inextricably\r\n  intertwined with the unconstitutional Freeholder Provision?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Did the Master err in holding\r\n  that, in the absence of the Freeholder and Election Provisions, the Home Rule\r\n  Act authorizes local governments to sell municipal utilities?\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF\r\nREVIEW\r\nA â€œlegislative act will not be declared unconstitutional unless\r\n  its repugnance to the constitution is clear and beyond a reasonable doubt.â€ Â Joytime\r\n    Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 640, 528 S.E.2d\r\n  647, 650 (1999).Â  Every presumption is made in favor of a statuteâ€™s\r\n  constitutionality. Â Gold v. South Carolina Bd. of Chiropractic Examâ€™rs,\r\n  271 S.C. 74, 78, 245 S.E.2d 117, 119 (1978).Â  The scope of review should be limited in cases\r\n  involving a constitutional challenge to a statute because all statutes are\r\n  presumed constitutional and, if possible, will be construed to render them\r\n  valid.Â  Hendrix v. Taylor, 353 S.C. 542, 550, 579 S.E.2d 320, 324\r\n  (2003).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nI. Constitutionality\r\nof the Freeholder Provision\r\nSojourner\r\n  argues that a compelling state interest justifies conditioning the sale of a\r\n  municipally-owned sewer and water system on an election triggered by a\r\n  freeholder-initiated petition and the Freeholder Provision is therefore\r\n  constitutional.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  right to vote is a fundamental right protected by heightened scrutiny under the\r\n  Equal Protection Clause.Â  State v. Thompson, 349 S.C. 346, 354, 563\r\n  S.E.2d 325, 329-30 (2002).Â  Restrictions on the right to vote on grounds other\r\n  than residence, age, and citizenship generally violate the Equal Protection Clause\r\n  and cannot stand unless such restrictions promote a compelling state interest.Â  Kramer v. Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 15, 395 U.S. 621, 627 (1969).Â  \r\nThe Freeholder Provision provides:\r\n\r\n  Before\r\n    any election shall be held under the provisions of this article at least\r\n    twenty-five per cent of the resident freeholders of the city or town, as shown\r\n    by its tax books, shall petition the city or town council that such election be\r\n    ordered.Â  \r\n\r\nSection 5-31-640.Â  \r\nSojourner\r\n  argues the Freeholder Provision is justified by the compelling state interest\r\n  in protecting the property rights of freeholders.Â  In particular, Sojourner\r\n  argues that maintenance and operation of sewer systems have an effect on\r\n  property owners that is different from and greater than that on the general\r\n  public.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that there is no compelling interest to support the Freeholder Provision.Â \r\n  Municipal utilities, as with other matters that affect public health and safety\r\n  of the entire community, have long been considered to be of general interest to\r\n  the community.Â  Hill v. Stone, 421 U.S. 289, 299 (1975) (holding that\r\n  â€œeven under a system in which [payment] falls directly on property taxpayers,\r\n  all members of the community share in the cost in various waysâ€).Â  Indeed, the\r\n  legislative intent of the Municipal Utility Act, of which the Freeholder and\r\n  Election Provisions are a part, is expressly dedicated for the benefit of all\r\n  those who own, use, or occupy dwellings or commercial buildings and exercised in\r\n  accordance with the police powers necessary to regulate the maintenance and\r\n  preservation of the health of the inhabitants of the State.Â  See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 5-31-2010 (2004).Â  Moreover, in the Equal Protection context, the\r\n  right to protect oneâ€™s property is not a fundamental right.Â  Thompson,\r\n  349 at 353, 563 S.E.2d at 329.Â  In our view, Sojournerâ€™s argument that property\r\n  owners are so much more affected by sewer system operations than other voters\r\n  so as to create a compelling state interest in special statutory protection has\r\n  no foundation in fact or in law and is therefore without merit.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we hold that the Freeholder Provision is not supported by a compelling state\r\n  interest and is therefore unconstitutional.Â  \r\nII. Severability of the\r\n  Freeholder Provision from\r\n  the Election Provision\r\nSojourner argues that even if the Court finds that the\r\n  Freeholder Provision is unconstitutional, it may be severed because it is not\r\n  so intertwined with the Election Provision that the Election Provision may not\r\n  be enforced.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  test for severability is whether\r\n  the constitutional portion of the statute remains\r\n  complete in itself, wholly independent of\r\n  that which is rejected, and is of such a character that it may fairly be\r\n  presumed that the legislature would have passed it independent of that which\r\n  conflicts with the constitution.Â  Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc., 338 S.C. at 648, 528 S.E.2d at\r\n  654.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Election Provision provides: \r\n\r\n  Before such construction,\r\n    purchase, sale, conveyance or disposal of any [municipal utility] . . . the\r\n    city or town council of the municipality shall submit the question of such\r\n    construction, purchase, sale, conveyance or disposal of the qualified\r\n    registered electors of the city or town at an election to be ordered for that\r\n    purpose by the city or town council and to be conducted in accordance with the\r\n    laws governing municipal elections. \r\n\r\nSection\r\n  5-31-620.\r\nWe agree with the Master that the\r\n  Election Provision and the Freeholder Provision are mutually dependent and\r\n  cannot be severed.Â  The Freeholder Provision conditions an election authorizing\r\n  the sale of a sewer system upon freeholders petitioning the city or town\r\n  council for such election.Â  Moreover, the Freeholder Provision and the Election\r\n  Provision were initially part of one section when enacted, and thus, we find\r\n  that the original legislative intent was for both provisions to operate as a\r\n  cohesive procedure.Â  In other words, we do not believe it may fairly be\r\n  presumed that the Legislature would have passed the Election Provision\r\n  independent of the unconstitutional Freeholder Provision.Â  See Fairway Ford,\r\n    Inc. v. Timmons, 281 S.C. 57, 60, 314 S.E.2d 322, 324 (1984) (refusing to\r\n  sever where â€œ[t]he obvious intent of the Legislature to require approval of\r\n  freeholders is so dominant that it cannot be said that the statute, without the\r\n  portion declared unconstitutional, would have been enacted without the\r\n  freeholder approval requirement.â€).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that because\r\n  the Election Provision is inextricably intertwined with the Freeholder\r\n  Provision, the Election Provision may not be severed and it is therefore not\r\n  enforceable.Â  \r\nIII. Home Rule\r\nAct\r\nLastly,\r\n  Sojourner argues that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-7-40 (2004), enacted as part of the\r\n  Home Rule Act, does not properly authorize the sale of a municipal utility\r\n  independent of the Freeholder and Election Provisions.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nSection 5-7-40 provides: \r\n\r\n  All\r\n    municipalities of this State may own and possess property within and without\r\n    their corporate limits, real, personal or mixed, without limitation, and may,\r\n    by resolution of the council adopted at a public meeting and upon such terms\r\n    and conditions as such council may deem advisable, sell, alien, convey, lease\r\n    or otherwise dispose of personal property and in the case of a sale, alienation,\r\n    conveyance, lease or other disposition of real or mixed property, such council\r\n    action must be effected by ordinance.Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  Legislature did not intend, by granting particular powers to a municipality, to\r\n  thereby limit the general powers of the municipality.Â  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 5-7-10 (2004).Â  \r\nFor\r\n  the reasons stated above, Â§ 5-31-640 and Â§ 5-31-620 cannot be applied to\r\n  require the Town to hold a referendum prior to the sale of its sewer system.Â \r\n  Therefore, we look to the Home Rule Act for guidance regarding the procedures\r\n  the Town must follow to effectuate the sale.Â  Pursuant to the authority granted\r\n  in Â§ 5-7-40 in conjunction with the expressed legislative intent in Â§ 5-7-10,\r\n  the Town is fully authorized to sell its sewer system pursuant to the Ordinance.Â \r\n  In our view, to hold otherwise would completely ignore the applicable statutory\r\n  framework that the Legislature has provided for municipal matters and would\r\n  simultaneously subvert Legislative intent.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the Home\r\n  Rule Act authorizes the sale of the Townâ€™s sewer system pursuant to the\r\n  Ordinance.Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we hold that the Freeholder Provision is\r\n  unconstitutional, the Election Provision is unenforceable, and Â§ 5-7-40\r\n  authorizes the Town to enter into an agreement for the sale of the sewer system\r\n  pursuant to the Ordinance.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\nWALLER, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  Assuming that S.C. Code Â§\r\n  5-31-640 fails to meet constitutional muster and must be struck down in its\r\n  entirety,[3] I would uphold Â§ 5-31-620 and its election requirement.Â  This election\r\n  provision not only requires an election before a municipality may sell, convey,\r\n  or dispose of a sewer system but also before such a system can be constructed\r\n  or purchased.Â  As such, it effectuates the requirement found in S.C. Const.\r\n  art. VIII, Â§ 16, titled â€œAcquisition and operation of public utility systems,â€\r\n  of a majority vote of the electors in a political subdivision before a\r\n  municipality may acquire or operate a utility, including sewer systems.Â  In my\r\n  view, the legislature would not have intended to deny municipalities and their\r\n  electors the ability to exercise their constitutional right to â€œacquire [a\r\n  utility] by initial construction or purchase,â€ a right they can exercise only\r\n  through an election held pursuant toÂ§ 5-31-620. I would therefore hold that Â§\r\n  5-31-620, the Election Provision, survives the striking of Â§ 5-31-640, the\r\n  Freeholder Provision.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Town and County are hereinafter referred to together as â€œRespondentsâ€.\r\n[2] The agreement provides that the County will pay the Town $1.9 million for the\r\n  assets comprising the Townâ€™s sewer system and will obtain a non-exclusive\r\n  franchise to provide sewer service within the Town.Â  The Town will retain\r\n  ownership and operation of its water system and the legal right to extend sewer\r\n  service to customers in its boundaries, if circumstances warrant it doing so in\r\nthe future.\r\n[3] Compare Millsap v. Quinn, 785 S.W.2d 82 (Mo. 1990)(term\r\n  freeholder struck from state constitutional provision leaving the rest intact); State v. Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Co., 171 S.C. 511, 172 S.E. 857\r\n  (1933)(court will strike words and even add others or change ordinary meanings\r\nin order to uphold statute against constitutional challenge).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of David C.
