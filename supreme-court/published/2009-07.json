Syrett, both of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  In this domestic relations case, Sherrie Jean Floyd\r\n  (Mother) moved to reduce the amount of her child support payment to Richard\r\n  Morgan, Jr. (Father).Â  After the family court granted this reduction and denied\r\n  each partyâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees, Father appealed the order to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  In a divided decision, the Court of Appeals affirmed the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order.Â  Floyd v. Morgan, 375 S.C. 246, 652 S.E.2d 83 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2007).Â  This Court granted Fatherâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We\r\n  reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to family\r\n  court.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nBy\r\n  order dated August 30, 2000, the family court granted Father a divorce from\r\n  Mother on the ground of adultery.Â  Prior to the issuance of this order, the\r\n  parties entered into a custody, support, and property settlement agreement.Â  Pursuant\r\n  to this agreement, the court granted Father custody of the partiesâ€™ two minor\r\n  children, ages six and eight, and granted Mother visitation in excess of 109\r\n  overnights per year.[1] Â \r\nBecause\r\n  Motherâ€™s visitation exceeded 109 overnights per year, it satisfied the\r\n  threshold amount to constitute a shared custody arrangement.[2]Â \r\n  The parties, however, agreed to calculate Motherâ€™s child support obligation\r\n  pursuant to a sole custody arrangement which resulted in an amount of support\r\n  greater than under a shared custody calculation.Â  Specifically, this agreement\r\n  provided:Â  â€œMother shall directly pay Father the amount of $920.00 per month in\r\n  child support based upon figures set forth in the attached Child Support\r\n  Obligation Worksheet A.â€ Â The family court approved the agreement and\r\n  incorporated it into the divorce decree.Â  \r\nIn May 2004, Mother\r\n  sought sole custody of the children or, in the alternative, a shared or joint\r\n  custody arrangement.Â  Additionally, Mother requested modification of her child\r\n  support obligation.Â  \r\nIn June 2005, due\r\n  to an increase in Fatherâ€™s income and a decrease in Motherâ€™s income, the\r\n  parties agreed they would temporarily reduce Motherâ€™s child support payment\r\n  from $920 to $808 per month while the action was pending.Â  By consent order, the\r\n  court approved the partiesâ€™ agreement. \r\nIn January 2006,\r\n  Mother and Father agreed to modify their original agreement regarding the\r\n  timing of Motherâ€™s visitation.Â  They did not, however, modify the number of\r\n  Motherâ€™s overnight visits with the children.Â  The family court approved this\r\n  modification.\r\nDespite these\r\n  modifications, the parties failed to reach an agreement concerning the\r\n  following two issues:Â  (1) Motherâ€™s request to permanently reduce her child\r\n  support obligation, and (2) both Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s requests for attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs.Â  In terms of the child support reduction, the parties disputed\r\n  whether child support should be calculated in accordance with Worksheet A (for\r\n  sole custody) of the South Carolina Child Support Guidelines (the Guidelines),\r\n  as referenced in the partiesâ€™ agreement, or Worksheet C (for shared custody) of\r\n  the Guidelines.Â  \r\nAfter a hearing,\r\n  the family court[3] granted Motherâ€™s request to modify the provisions of the original divorce\r\n  decree regarding child support.Â  In so ruling, the court found the 43% increase\r\n  in Fatherâ€™s income and the elimination of child care expenses in the amount of\r\n  $544.00 per month constituted a substantial change of circumstances. \r\nThe\r\n  family court calculated Motherâ€™s new child support obligation pursuant to\r\n  Worksheet C (shared custody) of the Guidelines and reduced Motherâ€™s support\r\n  payment to $152 per month.Â  Although the court recognized the partiesâ€™\r\n  agreement specified that child support calculations would be made using\r\n  Worksheet A (sole custody), the court believed it could exercise its discretion\r\n  to choose between the two methods of calculation.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  explaining this ultimate calculation, the court considered the fact that\r\n  Motherâ€™s current visitation was 147 days and that she had spent approximately\r\n  $3,000 in expenses above her child support obligation.Â  \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the court found each party should be responsible for his or her own attorneyâ€™s\r\n  fees and costs.\r\nFather appealed the\r\n  family courtâ€™s order to the Court of Appeals.Â  In a divided opinion, the Court\r\n  of Appeals affirmed the family courtâ€™s reduction of Motherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation and denied Motherâ€™s and Fatherâ€™s requests for attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Floyd v. Morgan, 375 S.C. 246, 652 S.E.2d 83 (Ct. App. 2007).\r\nRelying\r\n  solely on this Courtâ€™s decision in Rogers v. Rogers, 343 S.C. 329, 540\r\n  S.E.2d 840 (2001),[4] the Court of Appeals found the increase in Fatherâ€™s income as compared to\r\n  Motherâ€™s, the elimination of child care expenses, and the consistent amount of\r\n  medical expenses since the divorce constituted a substantial change of\r\n  circumstances which warranted a modification of Motherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation.Â  Id. at 251, 652 S.E.2d at 86.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the Court of Appeals pointed out that at the time of\r\n  the divorce in 2000, Father earned $4,000 per month whereas Mother earned\r\n  $4,067.Â  By the time of the initial hearing in 2004, Fatherâ€™s monthly income\r\n  increased 29% to $5,150, while Motherâ€™s income only increased 18% to $4,800.Â  In\r\n  2005, Fatherâ€™s income increased to $5,421, while Motherâ€™s income decreased to\r\n  $4,785.Â  At the time of the final hearing in 2006, Fatherâ€™s income increased to\r\n  $5,700, whereas Motherâ€™s income returned to $4,800.Â  According to the family\r\n  court and the Court of Appeals, these income fluctuations represented a 43%\r\n  increase to Fatherâ€™s income since 2000 compared to only an 18% increase to\r\n  Motherâ€™s income.Â  Id. at 251, 652 S.E.2d at 86.\r\nReferencing\r\n  several provisions of section 20-7-852[5] of the South Carolina Code and the accompanying Regulations 114-4720 and\r\n  114-4730,[6] the Court of Appeals held the trial court had discretion to apply Worksheet C, the\r\n  shared custody guidelines, upon Motherâ€™s showing of a substantial change of\r\n  circumstances.Â  Id. at 254, 652 S.E.2d at 88.Â Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  Motherâ€™s visitations were approximately 147 overnights per year, which clearly\r\n  exceeded the 109 overnight visits required to put into effect the shared\r\n  parenting provisions of the Guidelines, the Court of Appeals found Worksheet C\r\n  was the appropriate method of calculating a reduction in Motherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation.Â  Id. at 253, 652 S.E.2d at 87.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the Court of Appeals acknowledged the terms of the partiesâ€™ 2000 agreement and\r\n  the family courtâ€™s incorporation of this agreement into the divorce decree, the\r\n  Court of Appeals dismissed it as inconsequential on the grounds the 2000\r\n  divorce decree:Â  1) did not explain why there was a deviation from the amount\r\n  that should have presumably been awarded by application of the Guidelines, and\r\n  2) did not bind the parties to use Worksheet A in future child support\r\n  calculations based on a change of circumstances.Â  Id. Â Citing this\r\n  Courtâ€™s decision in Moseley v. Mosier, 279 S.C. 348, 306 S.E.2d 624\r\n  (1983), the Court of Appeals explained that â€œa merged child support agreement\r\n  loses its contractual character after it is judicially decreed.â€Â  Id. at 253, 652 S.E.2d at 87.\r\nHaving\r\n  found the family court did not err in reducing Motherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation and the parties had settled the custody aspect of the case, the Court\r\n  of Appeals affirmed the denial of Fatherâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Id. at 255, 652 S.E.2d at 88.\r\nThis\r\n  Court granted Fatherâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision\r\n  of the Court of Appeals.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn appeals from the family court, the appellate court has jurisdiction to find\r\n  facts in accordance with its view of the preponderance of the evidence.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Strickland, 375 S.C. 76, 82, 650 S.E.2d 465, 468 (2007).Â  This broad scope of review, however, does not require the reviewing\r\n  court to disregard the findings of the family court. Â Id.Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.\r\nFather\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the family courtâ€™s reduction\r\n  of child support to the amount established by an application of Worksheet C of\r\n  the Guidelines.Â  If a modification of Motherâ€™s child support obligation was\r\n  warranted, Father claims any calculation should have been made pursuant to\r\n  Worksheet A in accordance with the partiesâ€™ agreement.Â  \r\nA child support award rests in the discretion of the trial judge,\r\n  and will not be altered on appeal absent abuse of discretion. Â Hallums v.\r\n    Hallums, 296 S.C. 195, 197, 371 S.E.2d 525, 527 (1988). \r\nâ€œThe family court may always modify child support upon a proper\r\n  showing of a change in either the\r\n  childâ€™s needs or the supporting parentâ€™s financial ability.â€ Â Upchurch v.\r\n    Upchurch, 367 S.C. 16, 26, 624 S.E.2d 643, 647-48 (2006); Calvert v.\r\n      Calvert, 287 S.C. 130, 336 S.E.2d 884 (Ct App. 1985) (recognizing that a\r\n  substantial or material change of circumstances must occur to warrant a\r\n  modification of child support).Â  â€œThe party seeking the modification has the\r\n  burden to show changed circumstances.â€ Â Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 26, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 648.Â  Â â€œThis burden is increased where the child support award is\r\n  based on a settlement agreement.â€Â  Id. Â â€œHowever, changes within the\r\n  contemplation of the parties at the time of the initial decree are not\r\n  sufficient bases for the modification of a child support award.â€Â  Id.Â Â  Moreover, â€œa reduction in child support cannot be based on a decrease\r\n  in the noncustodial parentâ€™s income absent a strong showing by the latter that he\r\n  or she can no longer make the support payments required by the earlier order.â€Â  Townsend v. Townsend, 356 S.C. 70, 73-74, 587 S.E.2d 118, 119-20 (Ct. App. 2003).\r\nAs evidenced by the above-cited case law, an analysis\r\n  of Motherâ€™s request for modification of a child support obligation involves two\r\n  questions:Â  (1) did Mother prove that a substantial or material change of\r\n  circumstances occurred to justify a reduction; and (2) if a reduction was\r\n  warranted, what method of calculation was appropriate?\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Court of Appeals that upon a finding of a substantial change in\r\n  circumstances the family court judge has discretion to utilize any Worksheet he\r\n  or she finds appropriate under the facts of the case.Â  However, in the case sub\r\n    judice, we disagree that a substantial change in circumstances warranting a\r\n  change in support has occurred.Â  We conclude that Mother failed to meet the\r\n  heightened burden necessary to warrant a downward modification of her child support\r\n  obligation.[7]Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  we find the Court of Appealsâ€™ reliance on Rogers was erroneous.Â  In Rogers, Mother petitioned the family court for an increase in Fatherâ€™s child\r\n  support obligation based on Fatherâ€™s increase in income.Â  In contrast, Mother,\r\n  in the instant case, petitioned the family court for a decrease in her child\r\n  support obligation based on Fatherâ€™s increase in income.Â  Because the Court of\r\n  Appeals relied exclusively on Rogers, we believe the evident factual\r\n  dissimilarities of this case undermine the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision to find a\r\n  substantial change of circumstances.\r\nAlthough\r\n  the increase in Fatherâ€™s income is of some import, this factor alone did not\r\n  warrant a downward modification of Motherâ€™s obligation absent a strong showing\r\n  that she was incapable of meeting the initial agreed-upon amount of child\r\n  support.Â  See Miller v. Miller, 299 S.C. 307, 384 S.E.2d 715\r\n  (1989) (finding Father failed to establish substantial or material change of\r\n  circumstances warranting modification of his child support obligation where\r\n  Fatherâ€™s financial declaration did not show that he was incapable of paying the\r\n  previously-ordered support even though his income had decreased, Motherâ€™s\r\n  income had increased, and her expenses had decreased); see also Penny\r\n    v. Green, 357 S.C. 583, 594 S.E.2d 171 (Ct. App. 2004) (finding decrease in\r\n  Fatherâ€™s income from $140,000 to $120,000 was not sufficient to constitute a\r\n  substantial change in circumstances to warrant a reduction of his child support\r\n  obligation); Â Kielar v. Kielar, 311 S.C. 466, 429 S.E.2d 851 (Ct. App.\r\n  1993) (concluding Fatherâ€™s involuntary resignation resulting in a salary\r\n  decrease from $300,000 to $180,000 per year did not constitute a substantial\r\n  change in circumstances given it did not impact on Fatherâ€™s standard of living\r\n  or his ability to pay his support obligations); Calvert, 287 S.C. at\r\n  138, 336 S.E.2d at 888 (finding no substantial or material change of\r\n  circumstances despite reduction in Fatherâ€™s income and stating â€œ[t]he mere fact\r\n  that a supporting spouseâ€™s salary or income has been reduced does not of itself\r\n  require a reduction of either alimony or child supportâ€).\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, Mother had to prove more than an increase in Fatherâ€™s income\r\n  to warrant a downward modification of her child support obligation.Â  Mother\r\n  failed to do so given her income actually increased 18% since the 2000 order\r\n  and, thus, she could not establish that she was incapable of meeting the\r\n  initially agreed-upon child support obligation of $920 per month. \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find the other factors relied upon by the family court and the Courts of\r\n  Appeals were within the contemplation of the parties at the time of the initial\r\n  decree.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  given the childrenâ€™s young ages at the time of the initial decree, we believe\r\n  the parties would have foreseen the eventual elimination of the $544 child care\r\n  expense used to calculate Motherâ€™s initial child support obligation.Â  Moreover,\r\n  Regulation 114-4720 points out that support payments are based on data\r\n  reflecting the average cost of rearing a child to its age of majority.Â  This\r\n  Regulation also recognizes that this cost increases as the childâ€™s age\r\n  increases.Â  27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4720 (Supp. 2006).Â  Therefore, the\r\n  reduction in child care cost is offset over time by the increase in cost\r\n  associated with the needs of an aging or maturing child.Â  Thus, it would appear\r\n  that a reduction in child care cost is expected and considered in the child\r\n  support guidelines formulation.\r\nSecondly,\r\n  the overnight liberal visitation schedule did not change. Â Clearly, the parties\r\n  could have conceived that additional expenses would arise during the childrenâ€™s\r\n  extensive visits with Mother.Â  See Upchurch, 367 S.C. at 26, 624\r\n  S.E.2d at 648 (stating â€œchanges within the contemplation of the parties at the\r\n  time of the initial decree are not sufficient bases for the modification of a\r\n  child support awardâ€).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold Mother failed to meet her burden of proving a substantial or material\r\n  change of circumstances justifying a modification of her agreed-upon child\r\n  support obligation.Â  Because a modification was not warranted, we need not\r\n  address Fatherâ€™s issue regarding the recalculation of Motherâ€™s child support\r\n  obligation.Â  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (recognizing an appellate court need not\r\n  address additional issues if the resolution of another issue is dispositive).\r\nII.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Father asserts this Court should reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals\r\n  to affirm the family courtâ€™s denial of Fatherâ€™s request for attorneyâ€™s fees and\r\n  costs.Â  Â Â \r\nBecause\r\n  we reverse the Court of Appeals on the child support issue, we also reverse and\r\n  remand to the family court the issue regarding attorneyâ€™s fees and costs.Â  See Sexton v. Sexton, 310 S.C. 501, 503, 427 S.E.2d 665, 666\r\n  (1993) (reversing and remanding issue of attorneyâ€™s fees for reconsideration\r\n  when the substantive results achieved by trial counsel were reversed on\r\n  appeal). \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  find Mother failed to satisfy her heightened burden of proving that a\r\n  substantial or material change of circumstances existed to justify a\r\n  modification of her agreed-upon child support obligation.Â  Therefore, we\r\n  reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals and remand this case to the family\r\n  court for a reconsideration of the issue concerning an award of attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  and costs.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Although the agreement did not specifically identify\r\n  the number of overnight visits allotted to Mother, it set forth a weekly,\r\n  monthly, and holiday time schedule.Â  Based on this schedule, Mother was granted\r\n  147 overnight visits per year. \r\n[2]&nbsp; See 27 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 114-4730(A) (Supp. 2007) (â€œ[S]hared physical custody\r\n  means that each parent has court-ordered visitation with the children overnight\r\n  for more than 109 overnights each year (30%) and that both parents contribute\r\n  to the expenses of the child(ren) in addition to the payment of child\r\n  support.â€).Â  \r\n[3]Â  We note the family court judge who heard the 2006\r\n  action for modification of child support was not the same judge who issued the\r\n  2000 decree of divorce. \r\n[4]Â  In Rogers, this Court found Mother was\r\n  entitled to an increase in child support based on a 21% increase in Fatherâ€™s\r\n  income and an increase in child care expenses.Â  Rogers, 343 S.C. at 333,\r\n  540 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n[5]&nbsp; The Court of Appeals referenced several subsections\r\n  of section 20-7-852 which governs the award and modification of child support.Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-852(A)-(C) (Supp. 2006).Â  We note this code section is\r\n  now designated as section 63-17-470 pursuant to the General Assemblyâ€™s\r\n  restructuring of the Childrenâ€™s Code.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 63-17-470 (2009); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-852 (Supp. 2008).Â  Because this case arose prior to the\r\n  re-codification, we use the former statutory citations.\r\n[6]Â  These Guidelines govern child support awards as\r\n  provided in section 20-7-852 of the South Carolina Code.Â  27 S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 114-4720, 114-4730 (Supp. 2006). \r\n[7]Â  While we recognize the parties agreed to reduce\r\n  Motherâ€™s child support obligation from $920 to $808 per month while the action\r\n  was pending, we do not construe this voluntary modification as an explicit\r\n  concession on the part of Father that a change of circumstances existed to\r\n  warrant a permanent reduction.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26682","title":"Berkeley County School District v.

Â§ 14-3-310\r\n  (1976), and Rule 245 (formerly Rule 229), SCACR.Â  The Court granted the\r\n  Plaintiffsâ€™ petition and now reviews the South Carolina Department of Revenueâ€™s\r\n  (the Departmentâ€™s) decision denying the Plaintiffs reimbursement from the\r\n  Homestead Exemption Fund[1] for expenses incurred under lease-purchase and installment-purchase agreement\r\n  obligations for capital improvement projects.Â  Because these expenses are used\r\n  for â€œschool operating purposes,â€ for which owner-occupied residential property\r\n  is tax exempt, we find the Plaintiffs are entitled to reimbursement for the\r\n  taxes lost as a result of this exemption.Â  Accordingly, we grant the\r\n  Plaintiffsâ€™ request for a declaratory judgment.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nIn\r\n  past years, the Plaintiffs have entered into lease-purchase agreements and\r\n  installment-purchase agreements to obtain the current use of, and as a method\r\n  of financing, new and renovated school buildings and other school-related facilities.Â \r\n  The school districts have utilized these types of agreements as alternative\r\n  financing mechanisms that do not constitute â€œgeneral obligation debt.â€[2]\r\nUnder\r\n  the lease-purchase agreements, a school district would typically lease its land\r\n  and buildings to a non-profit corporation for a long period of time.Â  After\r\n  execution of the year-to-year lease, the corporation would privately raise\r\n  funds to finance the school renovation and construction by selling certificates\r\n  of participation to investors.Â  The school districtsâ€™ payments are set at an\r\n  amount sufficient to pay the principal and interest due under the certificates\r\n  of participation and are made from the proceeds of school district taxes levied\r\n  for general fund purposes.Â  In a lease-purchase transaction, ownership of the\r\n  facilities transfers at the end of the lease term.Â  The agreements include a\r\n  non-appropriation clause that permits the school districts to decline, without\r\n  penalty, to renew the annual lease by failing or refusing to appropriate\r\n  necessary funds for payments.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of the installment-purchase agreements, the school districts convey the\r\n  existing school facilities to the non-profit corporation and lease the land on\r\n  which these facilities sit to the corporation.Â  In turn, the corporation will\r\n  then issue corporate revenue bonds to fund the renovation of the existing\r\n  facilities and the construction of new facilities.Â  The school districts,\r\n  instead of annual payments, make yearly purchases of an undivided partial\r\n  ownership interest in certain facilities at a sale price set at an amount\r\n  sufficient to pay the principal and interest due under the financial\r\n  obligations issued by the corporation.Â  Pursuant to this type of agreement,\r\n  undivided partial ownership of the facilities transfers with each installment\r\n  payment.Â  The school districts use taxes levied for general fund purposes to\r\n  make the annual installment purchases.Â  These agreements include a\r\n  non-appropriation clause.\r\nIn\r\n  1988 and 1994, this Court issued decisions holding that lease-purchase\r\n  agreements and installment-purchase agreements do not constitute general\r\n  obligation debt.Â  Redmond v. Lexington County Sch. Dist. No. Four,\r\n  314 S.C. 431, 445 S.E.2d 441 (1994) (discussing Caddell and finding\r\n  school board had authority to enter into lease-purchase agreements to build a\r\n  new school without submitting the matter to voters); Caddell v. Lexington\r\n    County Sch. Dist. No. 1, 296 S.C. 397, 373 S.E.2d 598 (1988) (holding that\r\n  lease-purchase agreements do not constitute general obligation debt under\r\n  Article X, Â§ 15 of the South Carolina Constitution).\r\nIn\r\n  1995, the General Assembly enacted, and in 2006 amended, section 11-27-110[3] to limit lease-purchase agreements and installment-purchase agreements.Â  As a\r\n  result of the 2006 amendment, the General Assembly specifically prohibited\r\n  school districts from entering into such agreements without voter approval if counting\r\n  the proposed transaction would cause the school district to exceed its\r\n  constitutional debt limit.\r\nIn\r\n  response to the General Assemblyâ€™s pronouncement, the school districts\r\n  continued to utilize different variations of these types of agreements as\r\n  financing mechanisms that did not constitute, for constitutional purposes,\r\n  general obligation debt and that did not meet the statutorily-defined criteria\r\n  that the General Assembly pronounced to limit lease-purchase transactions.Â  After\r\n  an installment-purchase agreement was specifically challenged as to its\r\n  constitutionality, this Court refined its analysis holding that such an\r\n  agreement did not constitute a â€œfinancing agreementâ€ as defined in section\r\n  11-27-110(A)(6) at the time the agreement was entered into.Â  Colleton County Taxpayers Assâ€™n v. Sch. Dist. of Colleton County, 371 S.C. 224,\r\n  638 S.E.2d 685 (2006).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  so holding, the Court noted that section 11-27-110(A)(6) dealing with lease-purchase\r\n  agreements had been substantially revised in 2006 to include and specifically\r\n  define and explain lease-purchase and installment-purchase agreements entered\r\n  into by school districts.Â  Id. at 232, 638 S.E.2d at 689.Â  Based on this\r\n  amendment, the Court concluded that â€œ[t]he portion of Â§ 11-27-110(A)(6)\r\n  currently in effect requires only that the school district use funds derived\r\n  from the issuance of general obligation debt to make payments under an installment-purchase\r\n  agreement.Â  So long as the School District abides by this requirement, they\r\n  have not violated the statuteâ€™s requirements.â€Â  Id. at 236, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  at 691.\r\nIn\r\n  order to make payments on lease-purchase agreements, the school districts have\r\n  used taxes levied on owner-occupied residential real property.Â  Between 1995\r\n  and 2006, these properties received a property tax exemption on the first\r\n  $100,000 of the propertyâ€™s fair market value for taxes â€œcalculated on the\r\n  school operating millage imposed for tax year 1995 or the current school\r\n  operating millage, whichever is lower, excluding taxes levied for bonded\r\n  indebtedness and payments pursuant to lease purchase agreements for capital\r\n    construction.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-251(A)(1) (2000) (emphasis\r\n  added).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  2006, the General Assembly increased the amount of the tax exemption for\r\n  owner-occupied residential property to â€œone hundred percent of the fair market\r\n  valueâ€ of the property and provided the property was â€œexempt from all property\r\n  taxes imposed for school operating purposes but not including\r\n  millage imposed for the repayment of general obligation debt.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-37-220(B)(47)(a) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).Â  In order to reimburse\r\n  school districts for the revenue lost as a result of the exemption, the General\r\n  Assembly imposed an additional one percent sales tax.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  12-36-1110 to -1130 (Supp. 2007) (outlining provisions for additional sales, use,\r\n  and causal excise tax and directing taxes imposed under these sections to be\r\n  credited to the Homestead Exemption Fund as established pursuant to section\r\n  11-11-155).Â  In conjunction, the General Assembly established the â€œHomestead\r\n  Exemption Fund,â€ in which the collected funds are deposited.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§\r\n  11-11-155, 12-36-1120 (Supp. 2007).Â  Section 11-11-156 sets forth a three-tier\r\n  reimbursement mechanism to reimburse school districts out of the Homestead\r\n  Exemption Fund for taxes lost as a result of various property tax exemptions.Â \r\n  At issue in this case is tier three, which provides:\r\n\r\n\tThe tier\r\n  three reimbursement is derived from revenue of the tax imposed pursuant to\r\n  Article 11, Chapter 36 of Title 12, and for fiscal year 2007-2008, consists of\r\n  an amount equal dollar for dollar to the revenue that would be collected by the\r\n  district from property tax for school operating purposes imposed\r\n  by the district on owner-occupied residential property for that fiscal year as\r\n  if no reimbursed exemptions applied, plus an amount that a district may have\r\n  received in its fiscal year 2006-2007 reimbursements pursuant to Section\r\n  12-37-251 in excess of the computed amount of that exemption from school\r\n  operating millage for that year, reduced by the total of the districtâ€™s tier\r\n  one and two reimbursements.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  11-11-156(A)(1) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).Â  A districtâ€™s tier three\r\n  reimbursement in succeeding years is fixed at the 2007-2008 amount plus\r\n  increases based on the Southeastern Consumer Price Index and population\r\n  increases as determined by the Office of Research and Statistics of the State\r\n  Budget and Control Board (ORS).Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-156(A)(1), (2), (3)\r\n  (Supp. 2007).\r\nRelying on this\r\n  Courtâ€™s decisions that lease/installment-purchase agreements do not constitute\r\n  general obligation debt and their understanding that the tax reform statutes no\r\n  longer exclude payments due under lease/installment-purchase agreements, the\r\n  county auditors and treasurers for Berkeley County School District, Orangeburg\r\n  County Consolidated School District Five, and Spartanburg County School\r\n  Districts Number One and Number Five, did not levy against or collect from\r\n  owner-occupied residential property owners in those districts the taxes that\r\n  would otherwise have been needed for the 2007-2008 payments due under the lease-purchase\r\n  and/or installment-purchase agreements.Â  Instead, they believed their school\r\n  districts would be reimbursed for the amounts not collected as a result of the\r\n  exemption from funds collected by the Department pursuant to the one-percent\r\n  increase in sales tax and deposited in the Homestead Exemption Fund.Â  \r\nIn terms of the\r\n  remaining two plaintiffs, the county auditor of Lexington County imposed on\r\n  owner-occupied residential property an amount of taxes for fiscal year\r\n  2007-2008 necessary to make payments on the agreements of Lexington County\r\n  School Districts Number One and Number Four.Â  The county treasurer collected\r\n  those taxes from owner-occupied residential property for 2007-2008 lease/installment\r\n  payments of School District Number One.Â  The portion of a county-wide one-cent\r\n  sales tax, collected pursuant to the Lexington County School District Property\r\n  Tax Relief Act allocable to School District Number Four, was sufficient to make\r\n  that Districtâ€™s annual lease/installment-agreement payments for fiscal year\r\n  2007-2008.Â  The Lexington County treasurer did not collect the taxes levied on\r\n  owner-occupied residential property for 2007-2008 lease/installment payments of\r\n  School District Number Four.\r\nIn late May 2008,\r\n  ORS informed the Department that certain school districts in the state were\r\n  seeking tier three reimbursements for expenses incurred under lease-purchase\r\n  and installment-purchase agreement obligations for capital improvement\r\n  projects. \r\nIn response, the\r\n  Department issued Property Opinion #2008-03, in which it concluded that the\r\n  tier three reimbursement under section 11-11-156(A)(1) does not include millage\r\n  imposed for payments due under the agreements.Â  Specifically, the Department\r\n  found:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  reimbursements under S.C. Code Ann. Section 11-11-156 (Supp. 2007) for school\r\n  operating purposes do not include (1) millage imposed for general obligation\r\n  debt; (2) millage imposed for financing agreements as defined in Section\r\n  11-27-110(A)(6) regardless of the date the contract for the financing agreement\r\n  was entered into; or (3) millage imposed for any other agreement which is in\r\n  substance a financing agreement for capital improvements. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  reaching this conclusion, the Department focused its analysis on the narrow\r\n  question of whether â€œproperty tax for school operating purposesâ€ includes the\r\n  millage associated with financing agreements, such as lease-purchase agreements\r\n  for capital improvements. Â The phrase â€œproperty tax for school operating\r\n  purposesâ€ is not defined in section 11-11-156 or other provisions of the South\r\n  Carolina Code. Â According to the Department, the phrase refers to amounts\r\n  required for general day-to-day operations of a school.Â  The Department found\r\n  the phrase does not include amounts for capital improvements financed either\r\n  through debt obligations such as bonds, or through other financing mechanisms\r\n  such as lease-purchase agreements. The Department further reasoned that had the\r\n  General Assembly intended for the term â€œoperatingâ€ not to be significant, it\r\n  would have used the phrases â€œschool purposesâ€ or â€œall school purposes.â€ \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the Department stated that prior to the enactment of the Property Tax Reform\r\n  Act, section 12-37-251(A) (2000) provided that the property tax exemption and State\r\n  reimbursement for $100,000 of the fair market value of legal residences did not\r\n  include bonded indebtedness or lease-purchase agreements for capital\r\n  construction.Â  Thus, the Department found no reason to believe that the General\r\n  Assembly intended to expand the exemption and State reimbursement in section\r\n  11-11-156 to include those items. \r\nThe\r\n  Department further found that its interpretation was supported by other\r\n  statutory provisions regarding millage rate increases.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  Department pointed out that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320(D) (Supp. 2007) states that\r\n  restrictions on operating millage increases do not affect millage that is\r\n  levied to pay bonded indebtedness or payments for real property purchased using\r\n  a lease-purchase agreement or used to maintain a reserve account.Â  Thus, the\r\n  Department believed that millage for those items is not considered millage for\r\n  â€œoperating purposesâ€ and school districts are still able to raise the millage\r\n  to pay bonded indebtedness and lease-purchase agreements for the purchase of\r\n  real property.Â  The Department further reasoned that property taxes from all\r\n  taxpayers, including property taxes for legal residences, continue to pay for\r\n  capital improvements.Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  the Department asserted that S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-27-110 (Supp. 2007) treats\r\n  lease-purchase agreements in the same manner as general obligation bonds\r\n  subject to the constitutional debt limit.Â  Because bonds and lease-purchase\r\n  agreements are both methods of financing capital improvements, the Department found\r\n  that reimbursing school districts that use lease-purchase agreements to finance\r\n  capital improvements and not reimbursing school districts that use bonds to\r\n  finance capital improvements would be contrary to the legislative decision to\r\n  treat these methods of financing in the same manner. \r\nThe Plaintiffs\r\n  challenge the Departmentâ€™s decision and seek a declaration from this Court, in its\r\n  original jurisdiction, that the Plaintiffs are entitled to reimbursement under\r\n  sections 11-11-156 and 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) for expenditures of capital\r\n  construction financed using lease-purchase and installment-purchase agreements.Â \r\n  Because the reimbursement under section 11-11-156(A)(1) for fiscal year\r\n  2007-2008 establishes the school districtâ€™s â€œbase amountâ€ tier three payment,\r\n  the Plaintiffs point out that subsequent yearsâ€™ tier three payments will also\r\n  be affected by the Departmentâ€™s decision.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn\r\n  challenging the Departmentâ€™s decision, the Plaintiffs contend the plain\r\n  language of section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) precludes them from levying or\r\n  collecting taxes on owner-occupied residential property for the payment of the\r\n  school districtâ€™s lease/installment-purchase obligations.Â  Given that the\r\n  General Assembly narrowed the exclusion from the tax exemption to only â€œgeneral\r\n  obligation debt,â€ which does not include lease/installment-purchase agreements,\r\n  the Plaintiffs assert that lease-purchase obligations are no longer excluded\r\n  from the exemption.Â  Conversely, the Plaintiffs claim that they may only tax\r\n  owner-occupied residential property, â€œinsofar as school taxes are concerned,\r\n  for general obligation bond debt.â€Â  Thus, if section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) provides\r\n  a tax exemption for lease/installment-purchase agreements, they assert that the\r\n  tax revenue lost due to the exemption should be reimbursed by â€œtier threeâ€ of the\r\n  Homestead Exemption Fund under section 11-11-156(A)(1).Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œA\r\n  suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined\r\n  by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  The instant case primarily involves\r\n  the interpretation of statutes, which are questions of law.Â  Colleton County Taxpayers Assâ€™n, 371 S.C. at 231, 638 S.E.2d at 688.\r\nAlthough\r\n  we do not disagree with the arguments posited by the Plaintiffs, we believe the\r\n  analysis in this case involves a narrow review of the specific statutes at\r\n  issue and not a broad-based look at the entire statutory tax reform scheme,\r\n  past and present.Â  Because this declaratory judgment action essentially\r\n  involves the statutory interpretation of sections 11-11-156(A)(1) and\r\n  12-37-220(B)(47)(a), the analysis should be confined to the specific terms of\r\n  these statutes, given the exemption at issue is limited to â€œschool operating\r\n  purposes.â€ Â See W. Va. Pulp &amp; Paper Co. v. Riddock, 225 S.C.\r\n  283, 287, 82 S.E.2d 189, 190 (1954) (analyzing county tax exemption and stating\r\n  â€œ[i]t is therefore only necessary to examine the specific wording of the\r\n  statute, or the intent of the legislature in enacting it, in order to determine\r\n  the extent of the exemptionâ€).Â  \r\nTaking\r\n  this approach, we find the key question is what is encompassed in the exemption\r\n  â€œfrom all property taxes imposed for school operating purposesâ€ under sections\r\n  12-37-220(B)(47)(a) and 11-11-156(A)(1). Â This phrase, however, is not defined\r\n  in either section or any other code provisions.Â  Accordingly, we must employ\r\n  the rules of statutory construction. \r\nâ€œThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  legislature.â€ Â Hawkins v. Bruno Yacht Sales, Inc., 353 S.C. 31, 39, 577\r\n  S.E.2d 202, 207 (2003).Â  The words of the statute must be given their plain and\r\n  ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to limit or\r\n  expand the statuteâ€™s operation.

Corp. v.\r\n    Leatherman, 309 S.C. 174, 178, 420 S.E.2d 843, 846 (1992).Â  \r\nâ€œThe construction of a statute by the agency charged with its\r\n  administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not\r\n  be overruled absent compelling reasons.â€ Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Health &amp; Envtl. Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002); see Nucor Steel v. South Carolina Pub. Serv. Commâ€™n, 310 S.C.\r\n  539, 543, 426 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1992) (recognizing that where an agency is\r\n  charged with the execution of a statute, the agencyâ€™s interpretation should not\r\n  be overruled without cogent reason).\r\nFurthermore, â€œ[t]he language of a tax exemption statute must be\r\n  given its plain, ordinary meaning and must be strictly construed against the\r\n  claimed exemption.â€Â  Hollingsworth on Wheels, Inc. v. Greenville County Treasurer, 276 S.C. 314, 317, 278 S.E.2d 340, 342 (1981). â€œWhere a word is not\r\n  defined in a statute, our appellate courts have looked to the usual dictionary\r\n  meaning to supply its meaning.â€ Lee v. Thermal Engâ€™g Corp., 352 S.C. 81,\r\n  91-92, 572 S.E.2d 298, 303 (Ct. App. 2002).\r\nRelying\r\n  on a 1979 definition of â€œoperating expensesâ€ the Department contends that â€œschool\r\n  operating purposesâ€ encompasses â€œ[t]hose expenses required to keep the business\r\n  running, e.g. rent, electricity, heat.Â  Expenses incurred in the course\r\n  of ordinary activities of an entity.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 984 (5th\r\n  ed. 1979).Â  More recently, however, Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary has expanded the\r\n  term and defined it as â€œ[a]n expense incurred in running a business and\r\n  producing output.â€Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 599 (7th ed. 1999).\r\nIn\r\n  light of these anomalous definitions, a determination of whether expenditures\r\n  for site acquisitions and capital improvements fall under the definition of\r\n  â€œschool operating purposesâ€ is susceptible to more than one interpretation as\r\n  evidenced by the partiesâ€™ divergent views.Â  Having considered both positions in\r\n  the context of a statutory construction framework, we conclude the Plaintiffsâ€™ position\r\n  is logically sound and more persuasive than that of the Department.Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of specifics, we find payments for the lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements should come within the definition of â€œschool operating purposes.â€Â \r\n  Clearly, a school would not be operational without an infrastructure which\r\n  necessarily includes school buildings.Â  Thus, the continued operation of a\r\n  school district is dependent upon the renovation and purchase of school\r\n  buildings.Â  Because the lease/installment-purchase payments or requisite â€œrent\r\n  paymentsâ€ effectuate this goal, these payments are essential for â€œschool\r\n  operating purposes.â€Â  Significantly, in the business realm, the phrase\r\n  â€œoperating expensesâ€ has been defined to â€œinclude payroll, sales commissions,\r\n  employee benefits and pension contributions, transportation and travel, amortization\r\n    and depreciation, rent, repairs, and taxes, etc.â€[4] (emphasis added). Â Furthermore, to limit the definition of â€œschool operating\r\n  purposesâ€ to only expenses incurred for the administration of a school district\r\n  would be myopic.Â  Logically, a school district cannot operate without all of\r\n  its component parts, which include school administration expenses, day-to-day\r\n  expenses, and most importantly the actual facilities which are funded through lease/installment-purchase\r\n  payments.Â  Thus, we find the payments for lease/installment-purchase agreements\r\n  would be exempt under section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) and reimbursable under\r\n  section 11-11-156(A)(1).\r\nWe believe the\r\n  legislative history of the statutes at issue supports our decision.Â  Significantly,\r\n  section 12-37-251(A), the precursor to section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) (Supp.\r\n  2007),[5] provided:\r\n\r\n\t(A)(1)The Trust Fund for Tax Relief must contain an\r\n  amount equal to the revenue necessary to fund a property tax exemption of one\r\n  hundred thousand dollars based on the fair market value of property classified\r\n  pursuant to 12-43-220(c) calculated on the school operating millage imposed for\r\n  tax year 1995 or the current school operating millage . . . excluding taxes levied\r\n  for bonded indebtedness and payments pursuant to lease purchase\r\n    agreements for capital construction.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-251(A)(1)\r\n  (2000) (emphasis added).Â  In contrast, the version of the statute that is\r\n  applicable in the instant case provides for an increased amount of the tax\r\n  exemption for owner-occupied residential property to â€œone hundred percent of\r\n  the fair market valueâ€ of the property and provided that the property was\r\n  â€œexempt from all property taxes imposed for school operating purposes but not\r\n  including millage imposed for the repayment of general obligation debt.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) (Supp. 2007).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  evidenced by the above-underlined text, the General Assembly in the 2006\r\n  amendment of 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) confined the exclusion from the tax exemption\r\n  to only â€œgeneral obligation debt,â€ i.e., bonded indebtedness.Â  By\r\n  deleting lease-purchase agreements from the current statute, the General\r\n  Assembly inferentially included these payments in the tax exemption.Â  See Vernon v. Harleysville Mut. Cas. Co., 244 S.C. 152,\r\n  157, 135 S.E.2d 841, 844 (1964) (noting it is presumed the Legislature, in adopting an amendment to a statute, intended to make some change in the\r\n  existing law); see also Denene, Inc. v. City of Charleston, 352\r\n  S.C. 208, 212, 574 S.E.2d 196, 198 (2002) (stating it must be presumed the\r\n  Legislature did not intend a futile act, but rather intended its statutes to\r\n  accomplish something); Stuckey v.

County of Charleston, 349 S.C. 378, 384, 563 S.E.2d 651, 655 (2002)\r\n  (â€œThe canon of construction â€˜expressio\r\n    unius est exclusio alteriusâ€™ orÂ  â€˜inclusio unius est exclusio alteriusâ€™\r\n  holds that â€˜to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another,\r\n  or of the alternative.

Riddock, 225 S.C. 283, 288, 82 S.E.2d 189, 190 (1954) (â€œThe\r\n  inclusion in the statute of certain specified exclusions leaves the inference\r\n  that the Legislature intended no other exclusions from the exemption.â€). Â Additionally,\r\n  this interpretation is supported by this Courtâ€™s decisions in Cadell and Colleton County Taxpayersâ€™ Association which expressly differentiated lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements from general obligation debt.Â  Accordingly, we believe it would be contrary\r\n  to the legislative intent to â€œadd back inâ€ payments for lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements when the General Assembly specifically deleted them from the\r\n  exclusion from the tax exemption.Â  See Kinard v. Moore, 220 S.C.\r\n  376, 388, 68 S.E.2d 321, 325 (1951) (â€œThe court has no right to add the words they omitted, nor to\r\n  interpolate them â€˜on conceits of symmetry and policy.â€™â€).Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  addition to our review of the legislative history of the statutes at issue, we\r\n  have also thoroughly considered the Departmentâ€™s claim that section 6-1-320\r\n  supports its position.Â  We, however, are not persuaded by this argument.Â  Instead,\r\n  we believe this section actually bolsters the Plaintiffsâ€™ position. Â Section\r\n  6-1-320 specifically states that its limitations apply to â€œgeneral operating\r\n    purposes.â€ Â S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320(A) (Supp. 2007).[6]Â \r\n  Significantly, this section provides for the limitation upon millage rate\r\n  increases to be suspended and, in turn, increased for such purposes as the\r\n  purchase of capital equipment, the purchase of undeveloped real property or of the\r\n  residential development rights, or payment for the occurrence of a catastrophic\r\n  event. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320(B)(2), (6), (7) (Supp. 2008).[7] Â Clearly, these listed items would be considered capital improvements given that\r\n  a catastrophic event such as a natural disaster would inevitably necessitate\r\n  new construction.Â  If the General Assembly did not consider these listed items\r\n  to constitute â€œoperating purposes,â€ we believe there would be no need to allow\r\n  for the suspension of the limitation upon millage rate increases for them.\r\nFurthermore,\r\n  we find the Departmentâ€™s reliance on section 6-1-320(D)[8] is also misplaced. Â This section exempts from the restrictions imposed upon\r\n  millage rate increases millage that is levied for real property purchased using\r\n  a lease-purchase agreement, payment of bonded indebtedness, or payments to\r\n  maintain a reserve account.Â  Because section 6-1-320 addresses tax millage\r\n  increases, we find it is inapplicable given the issue in the instant case\r\n  involves reimbursement for taxes uncollected pursuant to state law.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  an agencyâ€™s decision should be accorded respectful consideration, we find there\r\n  are cogent and compelling reasons for this Court to overrule the Departmentâ€™s\r\n  decision.Â  Based on the above discussion, we hold the lease/installment-purchase\r\n  payments fall within the phrase â€œschool operating purposes.â€Â  Therefore, we\r\n  declare that the Plaintiffs are entitled to the tier three reimbursements pursuant\r\n  to section 11-11-156(A)(1) for expenses incurred for the lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements entered into for capital construction improvements during the 2007-2008\r\n  fiscal year.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  are cognizant that our decision may have deleterious future financial\r\n  consequences in terms of treating traditional general obligation debt\r\n  transactions differently than alternative lease/installment-purchase agreements\r\n  and establishing the base amount for tier three reimbursements.Â  However, we\r\n  are confined by the rules of statutory construction in analyzing the question\r\n  presented by this declaratory judgment action.Â  Because our role is limited to ascertaining\r\n  and effectuating the intent of the General Assembly, we believe it is for the\r\n  General Assembly to revise the statutes at issue to address these potential\r\n  problems.[9]\r\nDECLARATORY\r\n  JUDGMENT ISSUED FOR THE PLAINTIFFS.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  J., concurs. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion. KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  dissenting in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I concur in the result reached by the majority, but\r\n  write separately as in my view we should answer the question posed based simply\r\n  on the meaning of â€œschool operationsâ€ as the term is used in property tax\r\n  statutes.Â  The phrase â€œschool operating millageâ€ is found in former S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 12-37-251 (2000), which provided for the operation of the â€œTrust Fund\r\n  for Tax Relief.â€Â Â  Section 12-37-251 (A)(1) specified that the Trust was to be\r\n  funded in an amount necessary to fund a $100,000 exemption on certain\r\n  residential property â€œcalculated on the school operating millage . . . excluding\r\n    taxes levied for bonded indebtedness and payments pursuant to lease purchase\r\n    agreements for capital construction . . . .â€ (emphasis supplied).Â  In my\r\n  view, the fact that these types of payments were to be excluded from the\r\n  â€œschool operating millageâ€ calculations necessarily means that these types of\r\n  payments are â€œschool operatingâ€ expenses.Â  When the legislature reconfigured\r\n  the property tax statutes in 2006, it eliminated Â§ 12-37-251 (A)(1)[10] but added Â§ 12-37-220 (B)(47). [11]Â \r\n  This new section provides that the full value of the qualifying residential\r\n  property is now exempt â€œfrom all property taxes imposed for school operating\r\n  purposes but not including millage imposed for the payment of general\r\n  obligation debt.â€Â  Since it is well established that debt incurred for\r\n  lease-purchase agreements or installment purchase arrangements are not general\r\n  obligation debt,[12] the effect of this statutory revision was to exempt the full value of\r\n  qualifying residential property from taxation for lease-purchase debt, but not\r\n  from that attributable to bonded indebtedness.Â  Moreover, while S.C Code Ann. Â§\r\n  11-27-110 (Supp. 2008) subjects school district lease-purchase agreements to\r\n  the constitutional limits on general obligation debt, it cannot and does not\r\n  purport to convert those obligations into general obligation debt. Cf. Â§\r\n  11-27-110 (D)(State payment under financing agreement is deemed general\r\n  obligation debt service). \r\nAccordingly, I\r\n  would hold that Homestead Fund[13] tier three reimbursement under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-156 (A)(1) (Supp. 2008)\r\n  includes payments made pursuant to lease-purchase agreements and other\r\n  non-general obligation capital construction arrangements.Â  I therefore concur\r\n  in the result reached by the majority.Â  \r\n\r\nJUSTICE KITTREDGE: Â I respectfully dissent.Â  I vote to deny tier three\r\n  reimbursements to Plaintiffs.Â  I would hold that section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a)\r\n  permits school districts, through proper taxing authorities, to tax\r\n  owner-occupied residential property to make payments on capital construction\r\n  projects financed by lease/installment-purchase agreements.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  12-37-220(B)(47)(a) (Supp. 2008).\r\nI.\r\nThere\r\n  are 85 school districts in South Carolina.Â  Six of those school districts\r\n  (Plaintiffs) filed this action, which the Court accepted in its original\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  To avoid the constitutional limit on general obligation debt,\r\n  some school districts construct capital improvements through financing\r\n  mechanisms generally referred to as lease-purchase or installment-purchase agreements.[14]Â \r\n  A key feature of these financing mechanisms is the ability of the school districts\r\n  to bypass the voters.Â  Payments made under the lease/installment-purchase are\r\n  sometimes characterized as â€œrent,â€ but this characterization is a misnomer, for\r\n  each payment results in the school district acquiring an ownership interest in\r\n  the facilities, with full ownership vesting upon the final payment.\r\nThe\r\n  question before the Court concerns the proper method for acquiring tax dollars\r\n  to pay for these capital financing arrangements.Â  In 2006, the Legislature\r\n  precluded school districts from entering into such financing arrangements if\r\n  they would cause the school district to exceed its constitutional debt limit if\r\n  considered general obligation debt.Â  Also in 2006, the Legislature increased\r\n  the tax exemption for owner-occupied residential property to â€œone hundred\r\n  percent of the fair market valueâ€ of the property and provided the property â€œis\r\n  exempt from all property taxes imposed for school operating purposes but\r\n  not including millage imposed for the repayment of general obligation debt.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) (Supp. 2008) (emphasis added).\r\nTo\r\n  offset this loss of tax revenue for school operating expenses, the Legislature\r\n  imposed a one percent sales tax to replace the property tax formerly levied on\r\n  owner-occupied residential property.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 12-36-1110-1120 (Supp.\r\n  2008).Â  The money collected pursuant to the one percent sales tax increase is\r\n  placed in the Homestead Exemption Fund and distributed to the school districts\r\n  pursuant to statutory formula.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-1120 (Supp. 2008); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-156 (Supp. 2008).\r\nOne\r\n  of the methods of distribution from the Homestead Exemption Fund is known as\r\n  â€œtier three.â€Â  Reimbursement from tier three â€œconsists of an amount equal\r\n  dollar for dollar to the revenue that would be collected by the district from\r\n  property tax for school operating purposes imposed by the district on\r\n  owner-occupied residential property for that fiscal year as if no reimbursed\r\n  exemptions applied.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 11-11-156(A)(1) (Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  seek tier three reimbursement for payments made pursuant to their respective lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements.Â  Plaintiffs contend that these payments are included in the school\r\n  operating expense exemption, and as a result, owner-occupied residential\r\n  property may not be taxed for this purpose.Â  Hence, Plaintiffs assert their\r\n  entitlement to tier three reimbursements from the Homestead Exemption Fund.\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Department of Revenue rejected tier three reimbursements and\r\n  construed the statutory scheme as excluding lease/installment-purchase agreements\r\n  from the â€œschool operating purposesâ€ exemption.Â  The Department of Revenue\r\n  issued Property Opinion #2008-03 setting forth its construction of the\r\n  statutory scheme.Â  I include that opinion in its entirety. \r\nPROPERTY OPINION\r\nOPINION #2008-03\r\n\r\n\tQUESTION:\r\n\tDo the\r\n  reimbursements for school operating purposes under S.C. Code Ann. Section\r\n  11-11-156 (Supp. 2007) include (1) millage imposed for general obligation debt;\r\n  (2) millage imposed for financing agreements as defined in Section\r\n  11-27-110(A)(6) regardless of the date the contract for the financing agreement\r\n  was entered into; or (3) millage imposed for any other agreement which is in\r\n  substance a financing agreement for capital improvements?\r\n\tANSWER:\r\n\tThe\r\n  reimbursements under S.C. Code Ann. Section 11-11-156 (Supp. 2007) for school\r\n  operating purposes do not include (1) millage imposed for general obligation\r\n  debt; (2) millage imposed for financing agreements as defined in Section\r\n  11-27-110(A)(6) regardless of the date the contract for the financing agreement\r\n  was entered into; or (3) millage imposed for any other agreement which is in\r\n  substance a financing agreement for capital improvements.\r\n\tDISCUSSION:\r\n\tIn 2006,\r\n  the Legislature enacted the Property Tax Reform Act (Act), 2006 Act No. 388.Â \r\n  This Act substantially changed the way local school districts are funded.Â \r\n  Under the Act, a portion of the funding previously provided by property taxes\r\n  on legal residences has been shifted to the State using a 1% increase in sales\r\n  tax.Â  The mechanism for the State to reimburse school districts for the loss of\r\n  property tax revenues as a result of this change is provided in Section\r\n  11-11-156.Â  Section 11-11-156(A) provides State reimbursement for fiscal year\r\n  2007-2008 in three tiers as follows:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(1) The\r\n  tier one reimbursement is based on the amount receivedÂ Â  by the district\r\n  pursuant to Section 12-37-251 ($100,000 exemption for legal residences) as\r\n  applied for fiscal year 2006-2007.Â  The tier one reimbursement is fixed at the\r\n  fiscal year 2006-2007 amount and continues into succeeding fiscal years at this\r\n  fixed amount.\r\n\t\t(2) The\r\n  tier two reimbursement is the amount to be received by the district pursuant to\r\n  the provisions of Section 12-37-270 for fiscal year 2006-2007 for the school\r\n  operating millage portion of the reimbursement for the homestead exemption\r\n  allowed pursuant to Section 12-37-250 ($50,000 homestead exemption for\r\n  residents 65 or older and individuals who are permanently disabled or legally\r\n  blind).Â  The tier two reimbursement is fixed at this fiscal year 2006-2007\r\n  amount and continues into succeeding fiscal years at this fixed amount.\r\n\t\t(3) The\r\n  tier three reimbursement consists of â€œan amount equal dollar for dollar to the\r\n  revenue that would be collected by the district from property tax for school\r\n  operating expenses imposed by the district on owner-occupied residential\r\n  property for that fiscal year as if no reimbursed exemptions applied, plus an\r\n  amount that a district may have received in its fiscal year 2006-2007 reimbursements\r\n  pursuant to Section 12-37-251 in excess of the computed amount of that\r\n  exemption from school operating millage for that year, reduced by the total of\r\n  the districtâ€™s tier one and tier two reimbursements.â€\r\n\t\r\n\tThe\r\n  question before the Department is whether â€œproperty tax for school operating\r\n  purposesâ€ includes the millage associated with financing agreements, such as\r\n  lease purchase agreements for capital improvements.\r\n\tThe term\r\n  â€œproperty tax for school operating purposesâ€ is not defined in Section 11-11-156\r\n  nor is it defined in the rest of the South Carolina Code of Laws.Â  This term,\r\n  however, does have a generally accepted meaning within the local government and\r\n  legislative community.Â  The term refers to amounts required for the general\r\n  day-to-day operations of the school.Â  It does not include amounts for capital\r\n  improvements financed either through debt obligations such as bonds or through\r\n  other financing mechanisms such as lease purchase agreements.Â  The Legislature\r\n  did not intend the term â€œoperatingâ€ to be ignored.Â  If the Legislature were\r\n  referring to all property taxes used to finance schools, they would have used\r\n  the terms â€œschool purposesâ€ or â€œall school purposes.â€\r\n\tPrior to\r\n  the enactment of the Property Tax Reform Act, S.C. Code Ann. Section 12-37-251(A)\r\n  (2000), provided the property tax exemption and State reimbursement for\r\n  $100,000 of the fair market value of legal residences.Â  That exemption and\r\n  reimbursement did not include bonded indebtedness or lease purchase agreements\r\n  for capital construction.Â  There is no reason to believe that the Legislature\r\n  intended to expand the exemption and State reimbursement in Section 11-11-156\r\n  to include these items.\r\n\tThis\r\n  interpretation is supported by S.C. Code Ann. Section 6-1-320 (Supp. 2007).Â \r\n  Section 6-1-320 provides limitations on operating millage increases.Â  Section\r\n  6-1-320(D) provides that the restrictions on operating millage increases do not\r\n  â€œaffect millage that is levied to pay bonded indebtedness or payments for real\r\n  property purchased using a lease-purchase agreement or used to maintain a\r\n  reserve account.â€Â  In other words, millage for these items are not considered\r\n  for â€œoperating purposesâ€ and school districts are still able to raise the\r\n  millage to pay bonded indebtedness and lease purchase agreements for real\r\n  property.Â  As a result, reimbursement by the State is not necessary.Â  Property\r\n  taxes from all taxpayers, including property taxes for legal residences,\r\n  continue to pay for capital improvements.\r\n\tFinally,\r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Section 11-27-110 (Supp. 2007) the Legislature expressed its\r\n  interest in treating financing agreements, including lease purchase agreements,\r\n  in the same manner as debt from bonds.Â  Both bonds and lease purchase\r\n  agreements are methods of financing capital improvements.Â  Reimbursing\r\n  districts that used lease purchase agreements to finance capital improvements\r\n  and not reimbursing districts that used bonds to finance capital improvements\r\n  is contrary to the legislative decision to treat these methods of financing in\r\n  the same manner.\r\n\tBased on\r\n  the foregoing, the reimbursements provided in Section 11-11-156 do not include\r\n  (1) the millage imposed for general obligation debt; (2) millage imposed for\r\n  financing agreements as defined in Section 11-27-110(A)(6) regardless of the\r\n  date the contract for the financing agreement was entered into; or (3) any\r\n  other agreement which is in substance a financing agreement for capital\r\n  improvements.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nPlaintiffs\r\n  challenge the Department of Revenueâ€™s statutory construction in this action.Â \r\n  If payments pursuant to the lease/installment-purchase agreements are\r\n  considered school operating expenses, Plaintiffs are entitled to tier three\r\n  reimbursements.Â  Conversely, if payments pursuant to the lease/installment-purchase\r\n  agreements are not considered school operating expenses, owner-occupied\r\n  residential property may be taxed for such purpose, and the school districts\r\n  are not entitled to tier three reimbursements.Â  A majority of the Court agrees\r\n  with Plaintiffs.Â  I do not.Â  I believe the phrase â€œschool operating purposesâ€\r\n  creates no genuine ambiguity and means what it saysâ€”operational expenses, not\r\n  capital improvements.\r\nPlaintiffs,\r\n  in their brief, assert section 12-37-220(B)(47) creates an exemption for owner-occupied\r\n  homeowners for â€œall school property taxes.â€Â  Plaintiffsâ€™ brief is misleading,\r\n  for the statute says no such thing.Â  The section 12-37-220(B)(47)(a) statutory\r\n  exemption is limited to property taxes for â€œschool operating purposes,â€ an\r\n  unambiguous term excluding capital construction projects.[15]\r\nThe\r\n  Court today accepts Plaintiffsâ€™ premise of an ambiguity, and construes the â€œschool\r\n  operating purposesâ€ exemption so broadly that we must conclude the Legislature\r\n  intended no bounds.Â  The settled principle that a tax exemption must be\r\n  strictly construed against the claimed exemption is ignored today.Â  TNS\r\n    Mills, Inc. v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, 503 S.E.2d 471,\r\n  476 (1998) (â€œThe language of a tax exemption statute must be given its plain,\r\n  ordinary meaning and must be strictly construed against the claimed\r\n  exemption.â€).Â Â Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Court takes the statutory term and exemption for â€œoperating purposesâ€ and\r\n  instructs that â€œa school would not be operational without an infrastructure\r\n  which necessarily includes school buildings.â€Â  We learn, therefore, that the\r\n  Legislature intended the acquisition of property through capital improvements\r\n  (clothed as lease/installment-purchase agreements) to be included as operating\r\n  expenses, and thus subject to tier three reimbursements.Â  \r\nI\r\n  see no reason to depart from the common understanding of â€œoperating purposes.â€Â \r\n  Moreover, I see no reason to reject the statutory construction of the\r\n  Department of Revenue.Â  See Brown v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Health &amp; Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348 S.C. 507, 515, 560 S.E.2d 410, 414 (2002) (â€œThe construction\r\n  of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the\r\n  most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling\r\n  reasons.â€) (citation omitted).Â Â  \r\nIn\r\n  my judgment, the Legislature has given no indication of an intent to broaden â€œschool\r\n  operating purposesâ€ to include expenditures for capital construction under\r\n  lease/installment-purchase agreements.Â  I believe the Legislature intends the\r\n  very opposite.Â  For example, section 6-1-320 imposes limitations on a local governing\r\n  bodyâ€™s authority to raise property tax millage rates for â€œgeneral operating\r\n  purposes,â€ but the statute expressly relieves the local government from such\r\n  restrictions for tax millage for lease/installment-purchase agreements: â€œThe\r\n  restriction contained in this section does not affect millage that is levied to\r\n  pay bonded indebtedness or payments for real property purchased using a\r\n  lease-purchase agreement . . . .â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320(D) (Supp. 2008).Â  I\r\n  find it incongruous to suggest that the Legislature expressly lifted\r\n  restrictions on increasing tax millage for payments on lease-purchase agreements\r\n  if real property is not taxable for this purpose at all.\r\nIt\r\n  is manifest in my judgment that the Legislature has authorized local governing\r\n  bodies to levy taxes on real property for the payment of capital construction\r\n  under lease/installment-purchase agreements.Â  I thus believe the Department of\r\n  Revenueâ€™s statutory construction is buttressed by a review of the taxing\r\n  statutory scheme as a whole.Â  In any event, were I to accept the premise of\r\n  ambiguity in the phrase â€œschool operating purposes,â€ I see no compelling reason\r\n  to depart from the construction assigned by the Department of Revenue. Brown,\r\n  348 S.C. at 515, 560 S.E.2d at 414.\r\nAnd\r\n  finally, I observe that two of the school district plaintiffs also agree with\r\n  the Department of Revenue and believe that lease-purchase agreements are not school\r\n  operating expenses, and consequently are not included in the exemption.Â \r\n  Plaintiffs Lexington County School Districts No. 1 and No. 4 levied taxes on\r\n  owner-occupied residential property to make payments on lease-purchase agreements\r\n  for capital construction.[16]Â \r\n  I believe Lexington County School Districts No. 1 and No. 4 acted lawfully in\r\n  taxing owner-occupied residential property to make payments on their respective\r\n  lease-purchase agreements.Â  The conduct of these school districts juxtaposed to\r\n  their position in this lawsuit is troubling, at least to me.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â S.C.

Acts 3138. \r\n[6]Â Section 6-1-320(A) provides in relevant part:\r\n\r\n\t(A)&nbsp; Notwithstanding Section\r\n  12-37-251(E) a local governing body may increase the millage rate imposed for\r\n\tgeneral\r\n    operating purposes above the rate imposed for such purposes for the\r\n  preceding tax year only to the extent of the increase in the average of the\r\n  twelve monthly consumer price indices for the most recent twelve-month period\r\n  consisting of January through December of the preceding calendar year, plus,\r\n  beginning in 2007, the percentage increase in the previous year in the\r\n  population of the entity as determined by the Office of Research and Statistics\r\n  of the State Budget and Control Board.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  6-1-320(A) (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).\r\n[7]Â In a recent amendment, the General Assembly provided for the suspension of the limitation upon millage rate increases for such purposes as the purchase of capital equipment\r\n  and the purchase of undeveloped real property or of the residential development\r\n  rights.Â  This amendment became effective\r\n  on June 25, 2008.Â  Act No. 410, 2008 S.C. Acts 4024.Â  Thus, we recognize the\r\n  Department did not have the benefit of this amendment at the time it issued its\r\n  decision.Â  Because our role is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the\r\n  General Assembly, we believe it is essential to consider this recent amendment in\r\n  our attempt to discern what the General Assembly meant by the phrase â€œschool\r\n  operating purposesâ€ given it is not defined in our code of laws. \r\n[8]Â Section 6-1-320(D) provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\tThe restriction contained in this section does not\r\n  affect millage that is levied to pay bonded indebtedness or payments for real\r\n  property purchased using a lease-purchase agreement or used to maintain\r\n  a reserve account. Nothing in this section prohibits the use of energy-saving\r\n  performance contracts as provided in Section 48-52-670.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-1-320(D)\r\n  (Supp. 2007) (emphasis added).\r\n[9]Â We respectfully disagree with the dissentâ€™s position\r\n  which advocates a denial of tier-three reimbursements to the Plaintiffs.Â  In\r\n  order to adopt such a decision, we believe is to essentially ignore our\r\n  jurisprudence regarding general obligation debt.Â  Moreover, we decline to\r\n  discount the extensive and significant legislative history of the statutes at\r\n  issue in this case.\r\n[10] 2006 Act No. 388, Pt.

Â The State argues that\r\n  the PCR court erred in ruling that Respondent\r\n  received ineffective assistance of trial counsel and appellate counsel. Â We\r\n  find that Respondentâ€™s trial counsel and appellate counsel were not ineffective\r\n  and reverse the PCR courtâ€™s grant of relief.Â  \r\nFacts/Procedural History\r\nOn the evening of October 13, 1998, Respondent was at\r\n  the home of Robert Garland (the Victim) in Marietta, South Carolina.Â  Also\r\n  present were Lisa Ward (Ms. Ward) and Respondentâ€™s wife, Elizabeth Bennett (Ms.\r\n  Bennett).Â  Respondent and the Victim drank large quantities of beer and\r\n  moonshine throughout the evening.Â  Additionally, Respondent admits to ingesting\r\n  multiple Valium pills.Â  During the course of the evening, Respondent became\r\n  violent with Ms. Bennett.Â  The Victim and Ms. Ward ejected Respondent from the\r\n  home.Â  Breaking through the front door, Respondent re-entered the Victimâ€™s home\r\n  and beat him severely.\r\nIn January 2001, Respondent was tried for assault and\r\n  battery with intent to kill (ABWIK), possession of a weapon during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime, and first-degree burglary.Â  Ms. Bennett was not\r\n  present for the trial but the trial court admitted her out-of-court\r\n  statements.Â  \r\nMs. Ward testified that while Respondent was\r\n  assaulting the Victim, Ms. Bennett hysterically screamed, â€œHeâ€™s going to kill\r\n  me.â€Â  Trial counsel objected to the admission of the statement on hearsay\r\n  grounds.Â  The trial judge ruled that Ms. Bennettâ€™s statement was an excited\r\n  utterance, and thus admissible as an exception to the rule excluding hearsay\r\n  testimony.Â  Ms. Ward continued her testimony stating that as the two women were\r\n  exiting the home, Ms. Bennett screamed, â€œ[p]lease hurry, please hurry, because\r\n  if he gets hold of me, heâ€™s going to kill me.â€Â  Trial counsel did not renew his\r\n  objection.\r\nNext, the State presented Officer Keith Morecraft to\r\n  read into evidence a statement he took from Ms. Bennett at the crime scene\r\n  ninety (90) minutes to two hours after the crime had occurred.Â  Trial counsel\r\n  objected on both hearsay and Confrontation Clause grounds.Â  The trial court\r\n  overruled the objection and allowed Officer Morecraft to read the statement\r\n  into evidence.\r\nThe jury found Respondent guilty and sentenced him to\r\n  concurrent terms of eighteen (18) years for ABWIK, five (5) years for\r\n  possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime, and eighteen\r\n  (18) years for first-degree burglary.Â  Appellate counsel filed an appeal\r\n  pursuant to Anders,[1] which the court of appeals dismissed.Â  State v. Bennett, Op. No.\r\n  2002-UP-452 (S.C. Ct. App. filed June 20, 2002).Â  Respondent filed an\r\n  application for PCR.Â  After a hearing, the PCR court granted Respondentâ€™s\r\n  request for relief.Â  The PCR court found that trial counsel provided Respondent\r\n  with ineffective assistance in failing to adequately object to the admission of\r\n  Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statements.Â  The PCR court also found that appellate\r\n  counsel provided Respondent with ineffective assistance in failing to brief\r\n  issues concerning the admission of Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statements.[2]Â  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nIn\r\n  post-conviction relief proceedings, the burden of proof is on the applicant to\r\n  prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  If the PCR courtâ€™s finding is\r\n  supported by any evidence of probative value in the record, it should be\r\n  upheld.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626\r\n  (1989).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the PCR court erred in granting relief on the grounds that trial\r\n  counsel and appellate counsel provided ineffective assistance to Respondent.Â \r\n  We agree.\r\nFor\r\n  an applicant to be granted post-conviction relief as a result of ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel, the applicant must show that 1) counselâ€™s performance\r\n  was deficient,[3] and 2) he was prejudiced by counselâ€™s deficient performance.[4]Â  See Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 104 S.Ct. 2052 (1984); Porter\r\n    v. State, 368 S.C. 378, 383, 629 S.E.2d 353, 356 (2006).Â  \r\nI.&nbsp; Trial Counsel\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in finding\r\n  trial counsel ineffective.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nWe find that trial counselâ€™s performance was not\r\n  deficient and, therefore, his assistance was not ineffective.Â  Trial counsel\r\n  clearly objected on hearsay grounds to the admission of Ms. Wardâ€™s testimony\r\n  concerning Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statement.Â  The trial court correctly\r\n  ruled that the statements were admissible as excited utterances and overruled\r\n  trial counselâ€™s objection.[5]Â \r\n  Trial counselâ€™s decision not to renew his objection to Ms. Wardâ€™s continuing\r\n  testimony as to Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statements did not constitute\r\n  deficient assistance.Â  The second statement offered by Ms. Ward was essentially\r\n  identical to the first; therefore, because the trial court had already ruled on\r\n  the issue, it was not necessary for trial counsel to renew his objection.Â  See\r\n    State v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 37, 462 S.E.2d 882, 884 (Ct. App. 1995)\r\n  (â€œso long as the judge had an opportunity to rule on an issue, and did so, it\r\n  was not incumbent upon defense counsel to harass the judge by parading the\r\n  issue before him again.â€).\r\nAdditionally, trial counsel clearly objected to the\r\n  admission of Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statement given to Officer Morecraft.Â \r\n  Trial counsel made this objection on multiple relevant grounds and argued it\r\n  forcefully.Â  Because trial counsel unmistakably represented the interests of\r\n  his client on this issue, his performance was not deficient. \r\nWe find that there is no evidence of probative value\r\n  in the record to support the PCR courtâ€™s finding that trial counselâ€™s\r\n  performance was deficient.Â  Therefore, with respect to the PCR courtâ€™s grant of\r\n  Respondentâ€™s requested relief on the grounds of ineffective assistance of trial\r\n  counsel, we reverse. \r\nII.&nbsp; Appellate Counsel\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in finding\r\n  appellate counsel ineffective.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nA criminal defendant is constitutionally entitled to\r\n  the effective assistance of appellate counsel.Â  Evitts v. Lucey, 469 U.S. 387, 398 (1985).Â  However, counsel is not required to raise every non-frivolous claim,\r\n  but may select among them in order to maximize the likelihood of a favorable\r\n  outcome.Â  Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 288 (2000).Â  \r\nGenerally, in analyzing a claim of ineffective assistance\r\n  of appellate counsel, this Court applies the Strickland test just as it\r\n  would when analyzing a claim of ineffective assistance of trial counsel.[6] Â See Southerland v. State, 337 S.C. 610, 616, 524 S.E.2d 833, 836\r\n  (1999).Â  Thus, in this case, we ask 1) whether appellate counselâ€™s performance\r\n  was deficient, and 2) whether Respondent was prejudiced by appellate counselâ€™s\r\n  deficient performance.Â  \r\nEven if appellate counselâ€™s performance was deficient,\r\n  we find that such performance did not prejudice Respondent.Â  In order to show\r\n  that he was prejudiced by appellate counselâ€™s performance, a PCR applicant must\r\n  show that â€œthere is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s\r\n  unprofessional errors, the result of the proceeding would have been\r\n  different.â€Â  Cherry, 300 S.C. at 117-18, 386 S.E.2d at 625.Â  Ms.\r\n  Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statements admitted at trial were cumulative evidence\r\n  and not necessary to prove Respondentâ€™s guilt. Â Appellate counselâ€™s performance\r\n  did not prejudice Respondent and was, therefore, not ineffective.Â  \r\nAccordingly, we find that the PCR court erred in\r\n  finding that Respondent received ineffective assistance of appellate counsel.Â  \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold that the PCR court erred\r\n  in ruling that trial counsel and appellate counsel were ineffective, and we\r\n  reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order granting relief.Â Â Â  \r\nWALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Pursuant to Anders v. California, â€œif\r\n  [appellate] counsel finds his case to be wholly frivolous, after a\r\n  conscientious examination of it, he should so advise the court and request\r\n  permission to withdraw.â€Â  386 U.S. 738, 744 (1967). \r\n[2] The issue appellate counsel briefed in the Anders appeal was unrelated to the admission of Ms. Bennettâ€™s out-of-court statements.Â  \r\n[3] In order to prove that counselâ€™s performance was\r\n  deficient, an applicant must show that his counsel failed to render reasonably\r\n  effective assistance under prevailing professional norms. Â Cherry v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. at 117-18, 386 S.E.2d at 625.\r\n[4]Â  In order to prove that he was prejudiced by his\r\n  counselâ€™s deficiency, an applicant must show that â€œthere is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.â€Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115,\r\n  117-18, 386 S.E.2d 624, 625 (1989). Â â€œA reasonable probability is a probability\r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.â€Â  Johnson v.\r\n    State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â Â Â  \r\n[5] Additionally, Respondentâ€™s own defense that he was\r\n  entering the home to protect Ms. Bennett opened the door to these statements.\r\n[6] Appellate counsel filed an Anders brief,\r\n  as opposed to a brief on the merits.Â  Even in this context, when analyzing a\r\n  claim of ineffective assistance of appellate counsel, we apply the Strickland test.Â  See Smith v. Robbins, 528 U.S. 259, 284 (2000) (finding that\r\n  even where appellate counsel believes his clientâ€™s appeal is without merit and\r\n  thus files an Anders brief, the appellant may have been entitled to a\r\n  merits brief and the challenge of appellate counselâ€™s performance should be\r\n  reviewed under Stickland.)Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26683","title":"Terry v.

Pachak, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, of\r\n  Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  This Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the post-conviction relief (PCR) judgeâ€™s order reversing\r\n  Terrence Dimingo Terryâ€™s (Respondentâ€™s) plea of guilty to criminal sexual\r\n  conduct (CSC) with a minor, first degree and two counts of lewd act upon a\r\n  child.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nAfter\r\n  Respondentâ€™s nine-year-old stepdaughter disclosed to her mother that Respondent\r\n  had sexually abused her in July 2004, Mother confronted Respondent about the\r\n  allegations.Â  During this confrontation, it was revealed that Respondentâ€™s two\r\n  other stepdaughters, ages eleven and twelve years old, had also been sexually\r\n  abused by Respondent.Â  \r\nSubsequently, a\r\n  family court proceeding brought by the Department of Social Services was\r\n  conducted wherein Respondent admitted to the allegations.Â  As a result, a\r\n  treatment plan was put into effect to address Respondentâ€™s conduct. \r\nIn February 2005, a\r\n  Greenville County grand jury indicted Respondent for two counts of lewd act\r\n  upon a child involving the older two stepdaughters and one count of CSC with a\r\n  minor, first degree regarding the allegations of the nine-year-old\r\n  stepdaughter.Â  \r\nThe next month,\r\n  Respondent pled guilty to each of the three indicted offenses.Â  At the plea\r\n  proceeding, the circuit court judge inquired about Respondentâ€™s background in\r\n  terms of his age, education level, and marital status.Â  In terms of his health,\r\n  Respondent indicated that he was currently taking medication for hypertension\r\n  but that he felt fine and had not taken any medication, drugs, or alcohol\r\n  within the twenty-four hours before the proceeding.Â  Respondent acknowledged\r\n  that he had previously been treated for â€œdrugs and psychiatric.â€Â  He did not,\r\n  however, elaborate on this treatment.\r\nAfter the\r\n  introductory questions of the plea colloquy, the judge informed Respondent of\r\n  the offenses for which he was charged[1] and the maximum possible sentences for these offenses.Â  Respondent indicated\r\n  that he understood the charges and intended to plead guilty to each of the\r\n  offenses.Â  The judge then instructed Respondent that by pleading guilty he\r\n  would waive the following constitutional rights:Â  the right to a jury trial,\r\n  the Stateâ€™s burden of proof, his right to cross-examine the Stateâ€™s witnesses,\r\n  his right to present a defense, and his right against self-incrimination.Â \r\n  Respondent stated that he understood these rights but had made the decision to\r\n  plead guilty. \r\nAfter admitting his\r\n  guilt, Respondent indicated that he was satisfied with his counselâ€™s\r\n  representation and had been given ample time to review the Stateâ€™s evidence. \r\nThe solicitor then\r\n  provided the following factual basis for Respondentâ€™s guilty plea, stating:\r\n\r\n\tOn July\r\n  4th of 2004, [Respondent] put hair grease on his penis and on the victimâ€™s\r\n  vagina and attempted to have sexual intercourse with her.Â  When he was unable\r\n  to do so he then penetrated her vagina with his finger and her anus with his\r\n  penis.Â  This victim was the [Respondentâ€™s] nine year old step-daughter.\r\n\tIn May\r\n  and June, 2004 [Respondent] also committed numerous lewd acts on his other two\r\n  step-daughters, eleven and twelve years old by kissing them on the mouth,\r\n  rubbing their breasts, vaginal areas, and buttocks, and rubbing his body\r\n  against theirs.Â  All these incidents occurred while the family resided at 1 Woodmont Lane in Greenville County.Â \r\n\t\r\n\tThe\r\n  [Respondentâ€™s] wife, the mother of all three victims confronted the\r\n  [Respondent] when the nine-year-old victim disclosed her abuse.Â  And the\r\n  [Respondent] stated that he did not know why he did it.Â  The [Respondent]\r\n  admitted guilt in the DSS family court proceedings. Â \r\n\r\nFollowing the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s recitation of the facts, the judge asked Respondent whether the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s statements were true.Â  Respondent stated that they were true.Â \r\n  Respondentâ€™s counsel then informed the judge that Respondent had admitted his\r\n  guilt, but had told him â€œonly a crazy person would do something like that.â€Â \r\n  Counsel clarified that Respondent was not insane but recognized the â€œterrible\r\n  act.â€\r\nSubsequently, the\r\n  judge sentenced Respondent to twenty years imprisonment for CSC with a minor,\r\n  first degree and fifteen years for each count of lewd act upon a child.Â  The\r\n  sentences were to be served concurrently.Â  \r\nRespondent did not\r\n  file a direct appeal of his guilty plea.Â  Eight months after the plea,\r\n  Respondent filed an application for PCR.Â  In his application, Respondent\r\n  requested relief on the following grounds:Â  prosecutorial misconduct,\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel, and the plea courtâ€™s lack of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.Â  In an amended application filed by his PCR counsel, Respondent\r\n  asserted the following additional grounds for relief:Â  his plea was not\r\n  knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently made; his plea counsel did not make\r\n  him aware of the â€œnature and crucial elements of the charge against himâ€; at the\r\n  time of the plea he was under the influence of prescribed mental health\r\n  medications that affected his ability to comprehend what he was doing; and his\r\n  plea counsel failed to inform him of the right to appeal his guilty plea. \r\nOn March 1, 2007,\r\n  the circuit court held a hearing on Respondentâ€™s PCR application.Â  At the start\r\n  of the proceeding, Respondentâ€™s counsel outlined Respondentâ€™s bases for his\r\n  request for PCR.Â  Counsel primarily focused her argument on Respondentâ€™s\r\n  allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â  \r\nSpecifically,\r\n  PCR counsel alleged that plea counsel was ineffective in the following\r\n  respects:Â  (1) he failed to bring to the courtâ€™s attention Respondentâ€™s mental\r\n  health issues, particularly the fact that Respondent was housed in the mental\r\n  health section of the Greenville County detention center for nine months prior\r\n  to the plea proceeding and was taking â€œantipsychoticâ€ medication; (2) he failed\r\n  to evaluate the Stateâ€™s evidence in that he did not make a discovery request\r\n  and he did not view the physical evidence or the â€œrape kitâ€; and (3) he failed\r\n  to offer any mitigation evidence, such as the lack of physical evidence, the\r\n  absence of the victims at the plea proceeding, the Respondentâ€™s lack of a prior\r\n  record, and the Respondentâ€™s twelve-year military history.Â  Additionally, PCR\r\n  counsel emphasized that Respondentâ€™s plea counsel failed to review the meaning\r\n  of â€œsexual batteryâ€ with Respondent prior to the plea.Â  Counsel asserted that\r\n  the failure to review a crucial element of the offense was particularly\r\n  significant given Respondentâ€™s competency was in question. \r\nPCR counsel then\r\n  called Respondent as a witness. Â Respondent testified that he met with plea\r\n  counsel only once, the day of the plea proceeding, for a ten-minute\r\n  consultation.Â  He further stated that plea counsel never provided or reviewed\r\n  discovery with him.Â  Because he did not review any discovery materials,\r\n  Respondent claimed he was unaware of the SLED report stating that no physical\r\n  evidence was found on the clothing of the nine-year-old victim.Â  Although\r\n  Respondent acknowledged that he pled guilty, he claimed that he did not\r\n  understand the nature of the charges, particularly the meaning of â€œsexual\r\n  battery.â€Â  Respondent stated that his plea counsel did not explain the meaning\r\n  of this term.Â  He further testified that had he known the definition of â€œsexual\r\n  battery,â€ he would not have pled guilty. \r\nThroughout\r\n  his direct examination, Respondent repeatedly emphasized that he was unable to\r\n  adequately comprehend the plea proceeding due to his mental health issues and\r\n  the medications he was taking to treat these issues.Â  Respondent contended that\r\n  he admitted to the truth of the solicitorâ€™s factual recitation at the plea\r\n  proceeding because he lacked the ability to comprehend and adequately defend himself\r\n  at that time. \r\nAlthough\r\n  Respondent specifically denied committing a sexual battery on the nine-year-old\r\n  victim, he admitted there was inappropriate touching.Â  Despite the Stateâ€™s\r\n  assertion that Respondent admitted to committing a sexual battery during the\r\n  family court proceeding, Respondent testified he could not recall such an\r\n  admission.Â  Respondent acknowledged that the family courtâ€™s order included a\r\n  treatment plan stemming from a finding of sexual abuse.Â  Respondent, however,\r\n  noted that there was no finding of sexual battery or CSC with a minor.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Respondent maintained that he did not inform the plea judge\r\n  of the extent of his mental health problems because the â€œpsychiatric medication\r\n  . . . rendered [him] incompetent to speak for [himself].â€Â  Although Respondent\r\n  acknowledged that he was aware of the plea proceeding, he contended he did not\r\n  want to plead guilty and only did so due to his diminished â€œmental\r\n  capabilities.â€ \r\nRespondentâ€™s plea\r\n  counsel was the second and final witness to testify.Â  Counsel testified that he\r\n  could not recall how many times he met with Respondent prior to the plea\r\n  proceeding.Â  He did remember that â€œhe went over the materials [he] had in his\r\n  possession.â€Â  Plea counsel explained that he did not file a discovery motion\r\n  because the solicitor had an open file policy and he copied the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  file.Â  Counsel, however, was not aware of the SLED report which indicated that\r\n  there was no physical evidence found regarding the CSC with a minor offense.Â \r\n  Counsel testified he was aware that Respondent had gone to a family court\r\n  hearing, but he did not appear with Respondent because he did not know about\r\n  the hearing at the time it was conducted.Â  Plea counsel further stated that\r\n  prior to the plea proceeding he went over the allegations with Respondent who\r\n  told him that â€œsomething happened.â€Â  Plea counsel testified Respondent was\r\n  evasive and remorseful but never said he was not guilty.Â  Based on this\r\n  discussion, plea counsel was â€œsatisfied that it happenedâ€ but Respondent did\r\n  not want to say he did it.Â  When questioned whether Respondent appeared\r\n  confused about the plea proceeding, plea counsel explained:\r\n\r\n\tThe only\r\n  thing that I would say that heâ€”he wanted to admit without admitting that he did\r\n  this act. Â You know.Â  He danced around it but Iâ€™m going to plead guilty.Â  You,\r\n  know Iâ€™m going to plead guilty.Â  But, you know, when you get into specifics as\r\n  to what he did, he would kind of be evasive but something happened.Â  And thatâ€™s\r\n  what he told me.Â  I said, â€œWell youâ€™re going to plead guilty to it?â€Â  And he\r\n  said, Yes. \r\n\r\nOn cross-examination,\r\n  plea counsel testified that at the time he was appointed he was not aware that\r\n  Respondent was being housed in the mental health section of the Greenville County detention center.Â  He further stated that his file did not reflect that\r\n  he had met with Respondent prior to the day of the plea hearing.Â  In terms of\r\n  the contents of his file, plea counsel testified that he had the â€œdiscovery\r\n  packageâ€ provided by the solicitorâ€™s office.Â  Counsel, however, acknowledged\r\n  that this package did not include the SLED examination and he did not go to the\r\n  law enforcement center to review the evidence.Â  Â According to plea counsel, the\r\n  package included the family court order in which there was a finding of sexual\r\n  abuse. Â When asked why he did not object to the solicitorâ€™s statement that\r\n  Respondent admitted his guilt in the family court proceeding, plea counsel\r\n  stated, â€œTo me itâ€™s all the same . . . sexual conduct.Â  Misconduct.Â  I didnâ€™t\r\n  make that distinction.â€Â  When specifically questioned as to whether sexual\r\n  abuse is the same as sexual battery, plea counsel responded â€œItâ€™s all the\r\n  same.â€Â  \r\nWith respect to his\r\n  pre-plea discussions with Respondent, plea counsel stated that he told\r\n  Respondent what the allegations against him were and that Respondent understood\r\n  the charges.Â  Plea counsel admitted that he did not discuss the SLED report,\r\n  the rape kit, or the victimâ€™s statement.Â  Instead, counsel â€œtalked about\r\n  [Respondent] appearing in court to plead guilty and that he was guilty.â€Â \r\n  Counsel believed he had enough time to go over the discovery, the plea judgeâ€™s\r\n  questions, and whether or not Respondent wanted to plead guilty.Â  Counsel\r\n  maintained that Respondent wanted to plead guilty.Â  \r\nBy order dated\r\n  March 26, 2007, the PCR judge granted Respondentâ€™s application and, in turn,\r\n  reversed and remanded his convictions for CSC with a minor, first degree and\r\n  two counts of lewd act upon a child.Â  In so holding, the PCR judge found plea\r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to advise Respondent regarding the meaning\r\n  of â€œsexual battery.â€[2]Â \r\n  The judge noted that plea counsel â€œadmitted that he did not review the meaning\r\n  of sexual battery with the [Respondent] saying that lewd act and criminal\r\n  sexual conduct with a minor are basically the same thing, messing with\r\n  children.â€Â  Based on plea counselâ€™s testimony, the judge found counsel\r\n  â€œdemonstrated a lack of knowledge of the nature of the crimes for which he\r\n  represented the [Respondent].â€Â  In light of this testimony and Respondentâ€™s\r\n  testimony, the judge concluded that plea counsel did not advise Respondent of\r\n  â€œthe meaning of sexual battery and the significance of penetration as it\r\n  relates to criminal sexual conduct with a minor in the first degree.â€Â Â Â  The\r\n  judge further found that plea counselâ€™s error was not cured by the plea\r\n  colloquy.Â  Ultimately, the judge held that plea counselâ€™s performance fell\r\n  below reasonable and prevailing professional norms given counsel did not advise\r\n  Respondent of the elements of CSC with a minor and did not ensure that\r\n  Respondent understood the nature of the offense.Â  Finally, the judge found that\r\n  Respondent proved he was prejudiced by plea counselâ€™s deficient performance\r\n  given Respondent demonstrated that he would have insisted on going to trial had\r\n  he known the definition of â€œsexual battery.â€Â  \r\nThe PCR judge\r\n  denied the Stateâ€™s motion to alter or amend the order.Â  Subsequently, this\r\n  Court granted the Stateâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR\r\n  judgeâ€™s order.Â Â Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge erred in finding\r\n  Respondent would not have pled guilty if plea counsel had explained the\r\n  definition of a â€œsexual battery.â€Â  Because plea counsel reviewed the pending\r\n  charges and the discovery material with Respondent prior to the plea\r\n  proceeding, the State contends counselâ€™s failure to use the term â€œsexual\r\n  batteryâ€ did not render counselâ€™s performance deficient.Â  Even if counselâ€™s\r\n  performance was deficient, the State claims that Respondent did not prove\r\n  prejudice given he had admitted his misconduct and any error was cured by the\r\n  plea colloquy.Â  Ultimately, the State seeks a reversal of the PCR judgeâ€™s\r\n  decision to grant Respondent a new trial on all of his convictions. \r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  â€œThere is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.â€Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318,\r\n  331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596 (2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 370 (2007).Â Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he or she\r\n  is entitled to relief.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525 S.E.2d\r\n  514, 517 (2000).Â  â€œIn the context of a guilty plea, the court must determine\r\n  whether 1) counselâ€™s advice was within the range of competence demanded of\r\n  attorneys in criminal cases- i.e. was counselâ€™s performance deficient, and 2)\r\n  if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the\r\n  defendant would not have pled guilty.â€ Smith v. State, 369 S.C. 135,\r\n  138, 631 S.E.2d 260, 261 (2006) (citing Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-58 (1985)).Â  \r\nâ€œWhen\r\n  considering an allegation on PCR that a guilty plea was based on inaccurate\r\n  advice of counsel, the transcript of the guilty plea hearing will be considered\r\n  to determine whether information conveyed by the plea judge cured any possible\r\n  error made by counsel.â€ Â Burnett v. State, 352 S.C. 589, 592, 576 S.E.2d\r\n  144, 145 (2003).Â  â€œSpecifically, the voluntariness of a guilty plea is not\r\n  determined by an examination of a specific inquiry made by the sentencing judge\r\n  alone, but is determined from both the record made at the time of the entry of\r\n  the guilty plea, and also from the record of the PCR hearing.â€ Â Roddy v.\r\n    State, 339 S.C. 29, 31, 528 S.E.2d 418, 420 (2000).\r\nÂ â€œThis\r\n  Court gives great deference to the post-conviction relief (PCR) courtâ€™s\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.â€Â  Dempsey v. State, 363 S.C.\r\n  365, 368, 610 S.E.2d 812, 814 (2005).Â  In reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, an appellate court is concerned\r\n  only with whether any evidence of probative value exists to support that\r\n  decision.&nbsp; Smith, 369 S.C. at 138, 631 S.E.2d at 261.Â  This Court\r\n  will uphold the findings of the PCR court when there is any evidence of\r\n  probative value to support them, and will reverse the decision of the PCR court\r\n  when it is controlled by an error&nbsp;of law.&nbsp; Suber v. State, 371\r\n  S.C. 554, 558-59, 640 S.E.2d 884, 886 (2007).\r\nSection 16-3-655 of the South Carolina Code outlines the crime of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor as follows: Â Â â€œA person is guilty of criminal sexual conduct in the\r\n  first degree if the actor engages in sexual battery with the victim who is less\r\n  than eleven years of age.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-655(1) (2003).[3]Â  \r\nâ€œSexual batteryâ€ means â€œsexual\r\n  intercourse, cunnilingus, fellatio, anal intercourse, or any intrusion, however\r\n  slight, of any part of a personâ€™s body or of any object into the genital or\r\n  anal openings of another personâ€™s body, except when such intrusion is\r\n  accomplished for medically recognized treatment or diagnostic purposes.â€Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-651(h) (2003).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast to â€œsexual battery,â€ â€œsexual abuseâ€ has been defined as â€œ(a) actual or\r\n  attempted sexual contact with a child; or (b)\r\n  permitting, enticing, encouraging, forcing, or otherwise facilitating a childâ€™s\r\n  participation in prostitution or in a live performance or photographic representation\r\n  of sexual activity or sexually explicit nudity; by any person including, but\r\n  not limited to, a person responsible for the childâ€™s welfare, as defined in\r\n  Section 20-7-490(5).â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-135(B)(2) (2003 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2008).\r\nThe\r\n  term â€œsexual abuseâ€ has been used to generally describe conduct which\r\n  precipitates a charge of CSC with a minor.Â  See, e.g., State v.\r\n    Ladner, 373 S.C. 103, 644 S.E.2d 684 (2007) (affirming conviction for\r\n  first-degree CSC with a minor and discussing victimâ€™s statement and medical\r\n  evidence indicating victimâ€™s injuries were consistent with sexual abuse).Â  This\r\n  general use, however, has never equated â€œsexual abuseâ€ with â€œsexual battery.â€Â  \r\nClearly, a severe incident of child sexual abuse may constitute a\r\n  â€œsexual batteryâ€ and, in turn, CSC with a minor.Â  However, one who sexually\r\n  abuses a child is not necessarily guilty of CSC with a minor.Â  For example, an\r\n  inappropriate touching of a child without penetration of the childâ€™s â€œgenital\r\n  or anal openingsâ€ would constitute sexual abuse, but would not necessarily rise\r\n  to the level of a â€œsexual batteryâ€ and a charge of CSC with a minor.Â  Instead,\r\n  such sexual abuse would warrant a charge of lewd act upon a child.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-15-140 (2003) (â€œIt is unlawful for a person over the age of\r\n  fourteen years to wilfully and lewdly commit or attempt a lewd or lascivious\r\n  act upon or with the body, or its parts, of a child under the age of sixteen\r\n  years, with the intent of arousing, appealing to, or gratifying the lust or passions\r\n  or sexual desires of the person or of the child.â€).Â  Thus, the terms â€œsexual\r\n  abuseâ€ and â€œsexual batteryâ€ are not synonymous.\r\nIn the instant case, plea counsel testified at the PCR hearing\r\n  that he believed the terms were the same.Â  Because plea counsel did not\r\n  differentiate between the two terms or correctly explain them to Respondent,\r\n  there is evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s decision that plea counselâ€™s\r\n  performance was deficient.Â  Given plea counsel did not comprehend this\r\n  distinction and did not inform Respondent of a crucial element of the offense\r\n  of CSC with a minor, first degree, we agree with the PCR judge that counselâ€™s\r\n  representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness.Â  \r\nWe find, however, plea counselâ€™s deficient performance was cured\r\n  by the plea colloquy even though there was no specific discussion of the term\r\n  â€œsexual battery.â€Â  Notably, the PCR judge found that any allegations regarding\r\n  Respondentâ€™s competency were not meritorious.Â  In light of this decision, the\r\n  PCR judge implicitly found that Respondent had the requisite mental capacity to\r\n  comprehend the plea proceeding.Â  \r\nAt the plea proceeding, the judge read the indictments and\r\n  Respondent acknowledged that he understood these charges.Â  The indictment for\r\n  CSC with a minor, first degree identified the elements of the offense which\r\n  included a reference to a â€œsexual battery.â€Â Â  After Respondent affirmatively\r\n  stated that he understood the charges and admitted his guilt, the solicitor\r\n  gave a detailed factual basis for the charges.Â  In his factual recitation, the\r\n  solicitor identified conduct which would constitute the elements of\r\n  first-degree CSC with a minor.Â Â  Specifically, the solicitor conveyed that\r\n  Respondent had penetrated the nine-year-old victimâ€™s vagina with his finger and\r\n  her anus with his penis.Â  Both of these acts clearly meet the definition of a\r\n  â€œsexual battery.â€Â  Respondent admitted that the solicitorâ€™s statement of facts\r\n  was true.Â  Therefore, we find Respondent knowingly and voluntarily entered a\r\n  plea as to the charge of CSC with a minor, first degree.Â  See Roddy,\r\n  339 S.C. at 33-34, 528 S.E.2d at 421 (recognizing that for a guilty plea to be\r\n  voluntarily and knowingly entered into, the record must establish the defendant\r\n  had a full understanding of the consequences of his plea and the charges\r\n  against him (citing Boykin v. Alabama, 395 U.S. 238 (1969)).\r\nIn\r\n  view of our decision, we further conclude the PCR judge erred in granting\r\n  Respondent a new trial for the two counts of lewd act upon a child.Â  As\r\n  previously stated, the PCR judgeâ€™s primary reason for granting Respondentâ€™s\r\n  petition for relief was plea counselâ€™s failure to correctly inform Respondent\r\n  of â€œsexual battery,â€ an element of CSC with a minor, first degree.Â  Given a\r\n  â€œsexual batteryâ€ is not an element of lewd act upon a child and Respondent\r\n  admitted to inappropriately touching his stepdaughters, the two charges for\r\n  lewd act upon a child should not have been affected by plea counselâ€™s deficient\r\n  performance with regard to the definition of a â€œsexual battery.â€Â  Accordingly,\r\n  we find there is no evidence to support the PCR judgeâ€™s decision to grant\r\n  Respondentâ€™s relief on these two convictions.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  terms of Respondentâ€™s conviction for CSC with a minor, first degree, we find\r\n  any deficient performance by plea counsel was cured by the plea colloquy.Â  As\r\n  to the remaining two charges, we hold there is no evidence to support the PCR\r\n  judgeâ€™s reversal of the two counts of lewd act upon a child given any deficient\r\n  performance by plea counsel regarding his failure to inform Respondent of the\r\n  term â€œsexual batteryâ€ would not have affected Respondentâ€™s plea of guilty to\r\n  the charges of lewd act upon a child.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the PCR\r\n  judge is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; The judge read excerpts from the indictments.Â  In\r\n  terms of the charge of CSC with a minor, first degree the judge informed\r\n  Respondent that the indictment â€œalleges you did in Greenville County July 4,\r\n  â€™04 engage in sexual battery with child-victim #3, less than eleven years of\r\n  age.â€Â Â  \r\nAs to one of the\r\n  charges of lewd act upon a child, the judge stated that the indictment â€œalleges\r\n  you did in Greenville County on or about - - between June 1st and\r\n  June 25th, â€™04 being over the age of fourteen willfully and lewdly\r\n  committed a lewd and lascivious act upon the body or its parts of child-victim\r\n  #2, a child under the age of sixteen with the intent of arousing, appealing to,\r\n  gratifying the lusts, passions, or sexual desires of yourself or the child.â€Â  The\r\n  judge reiterated this language as to the second count of lewd act upon a child\r\n  with the exception that the date of the offense was May 31, 2004, and involved\r\n  child-victim #1. \r\n[2]&nbsp; The PCR judge found Respondentâ€™s remaining\r\n  allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel, prosecutorial misconduct, and\r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction to be without merit.Â  \r\n[3]Â  Because the alleged sexual misconduct occurred in July\r\n  2004, we cite to this version of the statute given there have been substantive\r\n  changes made to section 16-3-655 in subsequent years.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26684","title":"State v.

Dicapua, 373\r\n  S.C. 452, 455-56, 646 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We\r\n  granted a writ of certiorari.Â  We affirm.\r\nI.\r\nThe Horry County\r\n  Police Department and the Myrtle Beach Police Department conducted a drug sting\r\n  in a hotel.Â  One hotel room was a control room where the officers observed the\r\n  suspects and the informant.Â  The adjoining hotel room served as the transaction\r\n  room, which was set up with separate video and audio recording devices.Â  On the\r\n  day in question, the audio equipment malfunctioned.\r\nThe\r\n  hotel room was initially searched by the police for drugs, and the informant\r\n  was searched as well.Â  The informant was given one hundred and eighty dollars\r\n  in marked money by the police.Â  The informant and another woman in the hotel\r\n  room were arrested earlier that day for prostitution.\r\nThe informant briefly\r\n  left the room and reentered with Dicapua.Â  The informant counted out the money\r\n  and placed it on the bed.Â  Next, Dicapua counted the money and appeared to drop\r\n  something on the bed.Â  The informant then placed an unknown substance in her\r\n  pocket.Â  After the police entered the transaction room, the police searched Dicapua\r\n  and found drugs.Â  The police also located drugs on the informant for a total of\r\n  2.4 grams of crack cocaine.Â  Dicapua admitted the informant gave him one\r\n  hundred and sixty dollars.\r\nDicapua was tried\r\n  for and convicted of distribution of crack cocaine and possession with intent\r\n  to distribute crack cocaine.Â  At trial, Dicapua did not object to the admission\r\n  of the videotape.Â  Following the Stateâ€™s case, Dicapua made multiple motions:\r\n  for a dismissal and a mistrial due to the lack of a link between the drugs\r\n  found on the informant and Dicapua, for a directed verdict due to the â€œtotalityâ€\r\n  of the Stateâ€™s case, and for dismissal due to entrapment.Â  Notably, these\r\n  motions did not refer to the admission of the videotape.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the juryâ€™s guilty verdicts, Dicapua moved to set aside the verdict as there was\r\n  no evidence Dicapua intended to sell additional drugs and â€œthe objections and\r\n  request going back to the [informant], the chain, and all those things.â€Â  Again,\r\n  these motions did not implicate the admission of the videotape.Â  The trial\r\n  court sentenced Dicapua to thirty months for both charges to run concurrently.\r\nThe\r\n  next day the trial court sua sponte ordered a new trial because of\r\n  concerns about the videotape.Â  The trial court additionally ordered, â€œit is the\r\n  decision of this Court to suppress the introduction of the videotape in any new\r\n  trial to be had on the charges.â€[1]Â \r\n  The State served its notice of appeal.Â  The trial court subsequently held a hearing\r\n  to supplement the record and further explain its decision.[2]\r\nThe State appealed\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s sua sponte order.Â  The court of appeals reversed.Â  State\r\n    v. Dicapua, 373 S.C. 452, 456, 646 S.E.2d 150, 152 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  The\r\n  court of appeals majority found an abuse of discretion by the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  granting of a new trial for a waived issue, the admission of the videotape.Â  Id. at 455, 646 S.E.2d at 152.Â  One panel member of the court of appeals concurred,\r\n  addressing the matter of appealability.Â  Id. at 457, 646 S.E.2d at 153.Â \r\n  This Court granted Dicapuaâ€™s petition for certiorari.\r\nII.\r\nWe first address\r\n  the threshold matter of appealability. Â â€œThe State may only appeal a new trial\r\n  order if, in granting it, the trial judge committed an error of law.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Johnson, 376 S.C. 8, 10, 654 S.E.2d 835, 836 (2007).Â  To determine if an\r\n  error of law occurred, it is necessary to examine the merits of the case.Â  Id. at 11, 654 S.E.2d at 836.Â  We find an error of law occurred when the trial court\r\n  granted a new trial on the basis of evidence admitted with Dicapuaâ€™s consent.Â \r\n  Because of the error of law, the matter is appealable.\r\nWe\r\n  now turn to the legal issue which resolves this caseâ€”may a trial court in a\r\n  criminal case sua sponte order a new trial on a ground not raised by a\r\n  party?Â  We answered this question â€œnoâ€ in the context of a civil proceeding in Southern Railway Co. v. Coltex, Inc., 285 S.C. 213, 214, 329 S.E.2d 736,\r\n  736 (1985) (â€œThe sole issue is whether a trial judge ex mero motu[3] can grant a new trial on a ground not raised by a party. Â We hold he cannot.â€).[4]Â \r\n  We hold the same result must follow in a criminal case.[5]Â \r\n  Moreover, to affirm the grant of a new trial on a waived issue in a criminal\r\n  case would lend this Courtâ€™s imprimatur to a trial courtâ€™s impromptu grant of\r\n  post conviction relief.\r\nBy\r\n  consenting to the admission of the videotape evidence, Dicapua waived any\r\n  direct challenge to the admission of the evidence.Â  Concomitantly, the trial\r\n  court lacked authority to grant relief on the basis of a ground not raised by\r\n  Dicapua.Â  We hold the granting of a new trial sua sponte on a ground waived\r\n  by a party is an error of law.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Counsel\r\n  for Dicapua conceded at oral argument that it was error to preemptively\r\n  suppress the videotape at a new trial.\r\n[2]&nbsp; Because\r\n  the filing of the appeal deprived the trial court of jurisdiction, we may not\r\n  consider the trial courtâ€™s post-appeal explanation.\r\n[3]&nbsp; Ex\r\n  mero motu is a synonymn for sua sponte.Â  Blackâ€™s Law Dictionary 596\r\n  (7th ed. 1999).\r\n[4]&nbsp; As in the case at hand, in Southern Railway, Southern waived the ground\r\n  on which the trial court sua sponte granted a new trial.Â  285 S.C. at 215-16, 329 S.E.2d at 737-38.Â \r\n  Specifically, the trial court in Southern Railway stated that â€œ[t]his new trial is not granted on the\r\n  grounds as contended by [Southern] . . . .â€ Â Id. at 215, 329 S.E.2d 737.\r\n  Â In reversing the sua sponte grant of a new trial, we held â€œSouthern\r\n  waived the right to claim the omitted charge was error by not objecting to its\r\n  omission at the trial level.Â  Therefore, the omitted charge was not properly\r\n  before the trial court, the Court of Appeals, or this Court.â€ Â Id. at 216, 329 S.E.2d at 737-38.\r\n[5]&nbsp; We\r\n  acknowledge Rule 59(d), SCRCP, allows a civil trial court to order a new trial\r\n  within ten days of the entry of judgment for â€œany reason for which [the trial\r\n  court] might have granted a new trial on motion of a party.â€Â  We further\r\n  acknowledge that when a civil trial court exercises its\r\n  discretionary right to sit as a thirteenth juror and grants a new trial when\r\n  the verdict is contrary to the evidence, its decision will be upheld if\r\n  there is any evidence to support it.

Gregory, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26685\r\nHeard April 22, 2009 - Filed July 13, 2009 \r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tW.\r\n  Grady Jordan, of Olson, Smith, Jordan &amp; Cox, of Easley, for Petitioners.\r\n\t\t\t\tJ.\r\n  J Wilkes, of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  Respondents filed an\r\n  action seeking a declaratory judgment that in using their land for commercial\r\n  purposes, Petitioners were acting in violation of the restrictive covenants.Â \r\n  The trial court found that Petitioners were in violation of the covenants and\r\n  issued an injunction prohibiting Petitioners from using two lots for commercial\r\n  purposes.Â  The court of appeals affirmed, Buffington v. T.O.E. Enters.,\r\n  Op. No. 2007-UP-252 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 24, 2007), and this Court granted\r\n  a writ of certiorari to review that decision.Â  We affirm as modified. \r\nFactual/Procedural\r\n  Background\r\nForest Acres is a subdivision located in Easley, South\r\n  Carolina, which was developed in 1958.Â  The restrictive covenants provide that, â€œ[n]o lot shall be used except for\r\n  residential purposes,â€ but the covenants only apply to 62 of the 110 lots of\r\n  the subdivision. Â Respondents own lots in Forest Acres, and Petitioners\r\n  operate a Toyota dealership that borders the subdivision.Â  In 2003 and 2004,\r\n  Petitioners purchased lots 9, 10, 11, and 12 located across from the dealership\r\n  and within the subdivision.Â  Petitioners intended for the lots to be used for\r\n  additional parking and began developing the land.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\nRespondents\r\n  brought an action seeking to enjoin Petitioners from using lots 9, 10, and 12[1] for commercial purposes.Â  The trial court found that lots 10 and 12 were\r\n  subject to the restrictive covenants and thus could only be used for\r\n  residential purposes.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court ruled that Petitioners failed to show that they were entitled\r\n  to use the property for commercial purposes under an equity theory and that\r\n  Petitioners failed to show that a change of conditions \r\n\r\nexisted to warrant the\r\n  release of the restrictive covenants.Â  Accordingly, the trial court issued an\r\n  injunction prohibiting Petitioners from using the land for parking purposes.Â  The\r\n  court of appeals affirmed.\r\n\r\n\tWe granted a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the following issue:[3]\r\n\tDid the court of appeals err\r\n  in holding that a court is not required to balance the equities before\r\n  enforcing a restrictive covenant, but that even if it were to balance the\r\n  equities, equity favored enforcement?\r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nAn action to enforce restrictive covenants by injunction is\r\n  an action in equity. Â South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Natural Res. v. Town of McClellanville, 345\r\n  S.C. 617, 622, 550 S.E.2d 299, 302 (2001). Â On appeal from an equitable action, an appellate court may find\r\n  facts in accordance with its own view of the evidence. Â Townes Assoc. v.\r\n    City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1976).Â Â  While\r\n  this standard permits a broad scope of review, an appellate court will not\r\n  disregard the findings of the trial court, which saw and heard the witnesses\r\n  and was in a better position to evaluate their credibility.Â  Tiger, Inc. v. Fisher Agro, Inc., 301\r\n  S.C. 229, 237, 391 S.E.2d 538, 543 (1990).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue that the court of appeals erred in holding that\r\n  the equities favored the enforcement of the restrictive covenants.Â \r\n  Respondents, on the other hand, argue that a court is not required to balance\r\n  the equities in deciding whether to enforce restrictive covenants, but regardless,\r\n  the equities favor enforcement.Â  \r\nA restriction on the use of the property must be created in\r\n  express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such\r\n  restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of\r\n  the free use of property.Â  Hardy v. Aiken, 369\r\n  S.C. 160, 166, 631 S.E.2d 539, 542 (2006).Â \r\n  Thus, courts tend to strictly interpret restrictive covenants, and to enforce a\r\n  restrictive covenant, a party must show that the restriction applies to the property\r\n  either by the covenantâ€™s express language or by a plain and unmistakable\r\n  implication.Â  Id.; Sea Pines Plantation Co. v. Wells, 294 S.C.\r\n  266, 269, 363 S.E.2d 891, 894 (1987).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  first address whether courts must balance the equities in determining whether\r\n  to enforce a restrictive covenant.Â  In affirming the trial courtâ€™s injunction\r\n  against Petitioners, the court of appeals stated that, pursuant to Siau v. Kassel,\r\n  369 S.C. 631, 641, 632 S.E.2d 888, 893 (Ct. App. 2006) and Houck v. Rivers,\r\n  316 S.C. 414, 418, 450 S.E.2d 106, 109&nbsp;(Ct. App. 1994), once the court\r\n  finds that a restrictive covenant has been violated, it is not required to balance the equities of the\r\n  parties before enforcing a covenant.Â  However, a review of this Courtâ€™s\r\n  decisions on this issue reveals that this statement is contrary to our\r\n  precedent.Â  \r\nIn Circle Square Co. v. Atlantis Dev. Co., 267 S.C. 618, 230 S.E.2d 704 (1976), the Court first determined that the\r\n  defendantâ€™s proposed use of the land violated the restrictive covenants and\r\n  then held that the plaintiffs were not barred from seeking an injunction pursuant\r\n  to laches, waiver, or estoppel.Â  In Rabon v. Mali,\r\n  289 S.C. 37, 344 S.E.2d 608 (1986), this Court engaged in an equitable analysis\r\n  and found that the defendant established laches as a defense to using his land\r\n  for commercial purposes in violation of the restrictive covenants.Â  Finally, in Janasik v. Fairway Oaks Villas Horizontal Prop. Regime, 307 S.C. 339, 415 S.E.2d 384 (1992),\r\n  the Court held that although the trial court erred in allowing the homeowners\r\n  to offensively assert equitable defenses, the homeowners still prevailed under\r\n  equitable considerations and thus the restrictive covenants could not be\r\n  enforced against them.Â  \r\nAccordingly, while there is no formulaic balancing\r\n  test, we find that this Court has consistently held that\r\n  courts should consider equitable doctrines when determining whether to enforce\r\n  a restrictive covenant and enjoin a landowner from using their land in a manner\r\n  that violates the covenant.Â  Indeed, an action to enforce a restrictive\r\n  covenant is an action in equity, and to hold that a court must issue an\r\n  injunction as a matter of law upon a finding that a restrictive covenant has\r\n  been violated is erroneous.Â  We therefore hold that Siau and Houck are\r\n  overruled to the extent they hold otherwise.Â  \r\nTurning\r\n  to the merits of this case, we hold that the restrictive covenants are\r\n  enforceable.Â  Petitioners admitted that using the land for parking violated the\r\n  restriction that the land may only be used for residential purposes.Â  However,\r\n  Petitioners testified that they have expended over $700,000 on improvements to\r\n  the land, that Toyota will require them to relocate if they are not able to\r\n  expand the business, and that using the lot for commercial purposes will not\r\n  negatively impact Respondentsâ€™ property value since lots 10 and 12 are located\r\n  between unrestricted lots and other businesses are located in close proximity\r\n  to the lots.Â  Respondents testified that\r\n  the commercial development of Lots 10 and 12 created additional light and noise\r\n  pollution and adversely affected their property values.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find that the Petitioner cannot prevail under an equity theory.Â  In our view,\r\n  it would be inequitable to consider Petitionersâ€™ financial loss in purchasing\r\n  and improving the land since they were on notice of the covenants when they\r\n  purchased the property. Â To find\r\n  otherwise would indicate that any business could defeat a restrictive covenant\r\n  by spending a significant amount of money developing the land.Â  Moreover, Petitioners\r\n  cannot show that Respondents have waived their rights or that Respondents may\r\n  be estopped from enforcing the covenants.Â  The lots have never been used for\r\n  commercial purposes, and Respondents brought suit as soon as Petitioners began\r\n  developing the lots.Â  The record contains no evidence to support lifting the\r\n  covenants based on equitable doctrines.Â  In our view, to ignore the restrictive\r\n  covenants in the absence of such evidence would eliminate a homeownerâ€™s\r\n  justified reliance on property restrictions.Â  Therefore, we find that equity\r\n  does not weigh in Petitionersâ€™ favor and the restrictive covenants are\r\n  enforceable.[4]\r\nAccordingly, we hold that, upon a finding\r\n  that a restrictive covenant has been violated, a court may not enforce the\r\n  restrictive covenant as a matter of law.Â  Rather, the court must consider\r\n  equitable doctrines asserted by a party when deciding whether to enforce the\r\n  covenant.Â  \r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision as modified.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James R. Barber, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Lot 11 is not subject to the restrictive covenants.\r\n[2] The trial court found that lot 9 was not subject to the restrictive covenants.Â \r\n  Respondents did not appeal this ruling.\r\n[3] We denied certiorari to review the change of circumstances issue.Â Â  \r\n[4] Because we denied certiorari to review the court of appealsâ€™ decision as to\r\n  changed conditions, we are not considering facts and arguments related to that\r\n  issue in deciding this case.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26686","title":"In the Matter of David Arthur Braghirol","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26686","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary matter.","date":"2009-07-13","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of David Arthur Braghirol, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26686\r\nHeard June 10, 2009 - Filed July 13, 2009Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M. Williams,\r\n  Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tDavid Arthur Braghirol, of Columbia, pro se.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) filed three separate sets of formal\r\n  charges against respondent, David\r\n  Arthur Braghirol.Â  After two hearings, the\r\n  Panel recommended that respondent be suspended from the practice of law for six\r\n  months, with conditions, and be required to pay the costs of the proceedings. Â We\r\n  agree a definite suspension, with conditions, is the appropriate sanction, but\r\n  we impose a nine-month suspension. \r\n\r\nPROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  first two sets of formal charges were filed in November 2007 and February 2008;\r\n  these charges represent three separate matters.Â  Respondent failed to answer\r\n  the charges, and default orders were entered.Â  On May 29, 2008, a hearing was\r\n  held before the Panel; respondent appeared and made a statement in mitigation.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  was placed on interim suspension on June 24, 2008.Â  On June 26, 2008, ODC filed\r\n  the third set of charges regarding two additional matters.Â  Respondent again\r\n  failed to respond and was held in default.Â  The Panel held a second hearing on\r\n  October 28, 2008, and subsequently issued its report finding that respondent\r\n  had violated various Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  The Panel recommended that\r\n  respondent be definitely suspended for six months, retroactive to his interim\r\n  suspension date of June 24, 2008.Â  Additionally, the Panel recommended that\r\n  respondent:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\tbe ordered to pay the award from\r\n  the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t&nbsp;be required to work with a South Carolina attorney serving as respondentâ€™s mentor for 24 months;[1]\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tbe required to seek psychological\r\n  counseling, at his own expense, for 24 months, and submit quarterly updates\r\n  from the psychologist to the Office of Commission Counsel;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tmake appropriate restitution to\r\n  complainants; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\tbe ordered to pay the costs of the\r\n  disciplinary proceedings.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nODC\r\n  objects to the six-month suspension and requests a definite suspension for a\r\n  longer time period.[2]Â Â Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe formal\r\n  charges alleged five separate matters.Â  We also note the various mitigating and\r\n  aggravating circumstances of this case, as well as respondentâ€™s prior\r\n  disciplinary history.\r\n1.Â  Wren Matter\r\nRespondent\r\n  was appointed to represent complainant Wren in a criminal matter.Â  He attended\r\n  a preliminary hearing at which respondent told Wren he would return within a\r\n  day or two to meet with him.Â  Respondent, however, failed to meet with Wren or\r\n  contact him after the preliminary hearing.Â  Wren wrote to respondent on three\r\n  separate occasions inquiring about the status of his case.Â  Respondent failed\r\n  to respond to Wren.\r\nRespondent\r\n  was notified by the Solicitorâ€™s Office that Wrenâ€™s case was dismissed on August\r\n  4, 2006.Â  Respondent failed to notify Wren about the August 2006 dismissal.Â \r\n  There was, however, an error in Wrenâ€™s discharging paperwork, and Wren remained\r\n  incarcerated until April 2007, unaware that his criminal charges had been\r\n  dismissed approximately eight months earlier.Â  Respondent failed to recognize\r\n  the error with the discharging paperwork or take any action to correct the\r\n  error until a copy of Wrenâ€™s complaint was mailed to respondent by ODC in April 2007.\r\nAdditionally, respondent failed to respond to ODCâ€™s\r\n  initial inquiries about this matter, and he failed to respond to the notice of\r\n  full investigation subsequently served upon him.\r\n2.Â  Fee Dispute Matter\r\nThe South Carolina\r\n  Bar Resolution of Fee Disputes Board (â€œBoardâ€) ordered respondent to pay\r\n  $500.00 to a former client.Â  Respondent failed to comply with the order of the\r\n  Board.Â  As a result, the Board issued respondent a Certificate of\r\n  Non-Compliance and sent a copy to ODC on August 7, 2007.\r\nRespondent failed\r\n  to respond to ODCâ€™s repeated inquiries about this matter, and he failed to\r\n  respond to the notice of full investigation subsequently served upon him.Â  As\r\n  of the May 2008 hearing, respondent still had not paid the award as ordered by\r\n  the Board.\r\n3.Â  Sheppard Matter\r\nOn\r\n  September 10, 2007, respondent requested the production of a criminal trial\r\n  transcript from a court reporter.Â  On September 21, 2007, the court reporter\r\n  notified respondent that the transcript was complete and mailed an invoice for\r\n  $229.25.Â  In October and November 2007, the court reporter mailed respondent\r\n  overdue notices.Â  In addition, the court reporter left telephone messages with\r\n  respondent.Â  On November 30, 2007, South Carolina Court Administration mailed\r\n  respondent a letter advising respondent of his overdue court reporter invoice.\r\nODC served a supplemental notice of full investigation, but respondent failed to\r\n  respond or otherwise communicate with ODC on this matter.Â  Respondent finally paid\r\n  the court reporter in January or February 2008.\r\n\r\n4.Â  Isphording\r\n  Matter\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained in 2006 to represent complainant Isphording in a domestic action.Â \r\n  Respondent appeared at a temporary hearing in August 2007 where he was\r\n  unprepared and failed to competently represent Isphording.Â  A child support\r\n  hearing was scheduled for December 5, 2007.Â  Respondent called the Court three\r\n  hours after the hearing was scheduled to begin to report that he would not be\r\n  able to attend.Â  The hearing was continued until the following week, but\r\n  respondent failed to appear for the rescheduled hearing.Â  He also failed to\r\n  notify either Isphording or the court that he could not appear for the\r\n  hearing.Â  The hearing was again continued. Respondent failed to notify\r\n  Isphording of the rescheduled hearing and failed to attend the hearing.Â  He\r\n  again failed to notify either Isphording or the court that he could not appear\r\n  for the hearing.\r\nRespondent received a notarized Financial Declaration from Isphording in\r\n  January 2008 that he failed to submit to the court.Â  As a result, the court\r\n  issued a child support order without the benefit of reviewing Isphordingâ€™s\r\n  financial situation.Â  Respondent failed to notify Isphording that the court had\r\n  issued a child support order, and a Rule to Show Cause was issued against her\r\n  in March 2008 for failure to pay the court-ordered support.\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to keep Isphording reasonably informed of the status of her case and\r\n  refused to return her telephone calls.Â  She terminated respondentâ€™s services\r\n  and requested that he return her complete client file, but respondent failed to\r\n  do so and failed to refund her legal fees that were unearned by him.\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to respond to ODCâ€™s supplemental notice of full\r\n  investigation on this matter.\r\n5.Â  Glover\r\n  Matter\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained by complainant Glover in early 2004 to initiate a civil action on\r\n  her behalf against Table Rock Investments, LLC.Â  Respondent failed to keep\r\n  Glover reasonably informed regarding the status of her case and failed to\r\n  return her numerous phone calls.Â  Additionally, respondent failed to safeguard\r\n  Gloverâ€™s property in that he informed her that he had lost all of her original\r\n  documents.\r\nIn a\r\n  meeting with Glover in November 2007, respondent informed her he would be\r\n  settling her case for $5,000.00.Â  Respondent, however, has had no contact with\r\n  Glover since then, has failed to settle her case, and has failed to notify her\r\n  that he had not settled the case.Â  Respondent has failed to do any meaningful\r\n  work on Gloverâ€™s case and has failed to expedite litigation consistent with her\r\n  wishes.\r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to respond to ODCâ€™s supplemental notice of full\r\n  investigation on this matter.\r\nMitigating\r\n  Circumstances\r\nAt the\r\n  May 2008 hearing, respondent testified to the Panel about his background and\r\n  several extenuating circumstances that led to his misconduct.Â  In 2005, his\r\n  79-year-old father committed suicide in front of his mother by using a .22\r\n  pistol to shoot himself in the head.Â  Respondentâ€™s mother called him.Â  When he\r\n  arrived, his mother was refusing to let EMS take the body away from her.Â \r\n  Respondent was the person who cleaned the blood off the walls.\r\nThree\r\n  days later, respondent and his wife found out she was pregnant.Â  Because of a\r\n  miscarriage a few months prior, they soon had an ultrasound and discovered she\r\n  was pregnant with twins.Â  Respondent described the pregnancy as â€œtumultuous.â€Â \r\n  The twins were born in January 2006.Â  According to respondent, his wife suffers\r\n  from depression and experienced severe post-partum depression.Â  He stated that\r\n  he was trying to â€œjuggleâ€ his wifeâ€™s depression, the care-taking of the twins,\r\n  the after-effects of his fatherâ€™s suicide, the needs of his 11-year-old\r\n  stepdaughter, and his solo practice.Â  \r\nSome\r\n  time after he was served the formal charges, he called his mother and requested\r\n  that she take care of the two-year-old twins at her home.Â  Additionally, after\r\n  he met with disciplinary counsel for an interview, he went to a physician and\r\n  found out he had type two diabetes.Â  He was placed on medication for the\r\n  diabetes, as well as anti-depressants.\r\nRespondent\r\n  also made a statement at the second hearing, which occurred in October 2008,\r\n  approximately four months after he was placed on interim suspension.Â  He told\r\n  the Panel that after the first hearing, he began seeing a psychiatrist.Â  He\r\n  stated that with counseling and medication, he had â€œregained his strengthâ€ and\r\n  he asked that he be allowed to continue to practice law.\r\nRespondent submitted an affidavit from his treating psychiatrist,\r\n  Dr. Steude.Â  Dr. Steude began treating respondent in August 2008 and diagnosed\r\n  him with Major Depressive Disorder.Â  Dr. Steude stated that with medication and\r\n  therapy, respondentâ€™s depression has gone into remission.Â  He noted respondent\r\n  has been cooperative, interactive and honest during his treatment.Â  Dr. Steude\r\n  opined that respondentâ€™s personal and marital issues, although not fully\r\n  resolved, should have â€œminimal impact, if any, on his ability to competently\r\n  practice law.â€\r\nAggravating\r\n  Circumstances / Previous Disciplinary History\r\nThe Panel considered two aggravating circumstances:Â  (1)\r\n  respondentâ€™s pattern of not responding and/or cooperating with ODC regarding these five matters; and (2) his prior disciplinary history regarding\r\n  a finding of minor misconduct in 2006 for failure to respond which resulted in\r\n  a letter of caution.\r\nIn addition, respondent has the following additional disciplinary\r\n  history.Â  On February 3, 2004, respondent was suspended by the CLE Commission;\r\n  he was reinstated on February 4, 2004.Â  On April 2, 2008, he was again\r\n  suspended by the CLE Commission; he was reinstated on April 18, 2008.Â  He was\r\n  placed on interim suspension on June 24, 2008.Â  On April 2, 2009, he was\r\n  suspended by the CLE Commission.\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is\r\n  given rests entirely with this Court.Â  In re McFarland, 360 S.C. 101,\r\n  600 S.E.2d 537 (2004); In re Long, 346 S.C. 110, 551 S.E.2d 586\r\n  (2001).Â  Under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (RLDE), respondent\r\n  is in default, and therefore, he is deemed to have admitted all factual\r\n  allegations of the formal charges.Â  See Rule 24 RLDE, in Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  The charges of misconduct against respondent likewise are deemed\r\n  admitted, and thus, the Court must only determine the appropriate sanction.Â  E.g., Matter of Thornton, 327 S.C. 193, 489 S.E.2d 198&nbsp;(1997).\r\nBased on the facts of the five matters outlined above, we find\r\n  respondent violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC), found in\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:\r\n\r\n\tRule 1.1 - Competence\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 1.2 - Scope of\r\n  Representation\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 1.3 - Diligence\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 1.4 -\r\n  Communication \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 1.15(d) -\r\n  Safekeeping of Property\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 1.16(d) -\r\n  Declining or Terminating Representation\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 3.2 - Expediting\r\n  Litigation\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 8.1(b) - Bar Admissions\r\n  and Disciplinary Matters\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 8.4(a) &amp; (e)\r\n  - Violation of RPC and Conduct Prejudicial to the Administration of Justice\r\n\r\nIn addition, we find respondent violated Rule 7(a) of the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, including: \r\n\r\n\tRule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (violating a Rule of Professional Conduct)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 7(a)(3) (knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 7(a)(5) (conduct\r\n  tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring the legal\r\n  profession into disrepute)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 7(a)(6) (violating the oath of office taken to practice law in South Carolina)\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\tRule 7(a)(10) (willfully failing to comply with a final decision of\r\n  the Resolution of Fee Disputes Board)\r\n\r\nODC argues that\r\n  respondentâ€™s pattern of not responding and not cooperating with ODC, combined\r\n  with respondentâ€™s misconduct, warrant a definite suspension of greater than six\r\n  months.Â  We agree. Â See In re Sturkey, 376 S.C. 286, 657 S.E.2d\r\n  465&nbsp;(2008) (where attorney failed respond to charges related to eight\r\n  matters in criminal cases, the Court imposed a nine-month definite suspension,\r\n  with participation in a law office management program and payment of costs); In\r\n    re Conway, 374 S.C. 75, 647 S.E.2d 235 (2007) (where attorney, inter\r\n      alia, failed to pay court reporter, failed to safeguard client files, and\r\n  failed to respond to charges, this Court accepted an agreement for a definite\r\n  suspension of nine months); In re Cabaniss, 369 S.C. 216, 632 S.E.2d\r\n  280&nbsp;(2006) (where attorney inter alia neglected or performed less\r\n  than competently on nine client matters, the Court accepted an agreement for a twelve-month\r\n  suspension, retroactive to the date of respondent's interim suspension).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we impose a nine-month definite suspension as a sanction for respondentâ€™s\r\n  misconduct.Â  The definite suspension shall be retroactive to respondentâ€™s\r\n  interim suspension. Â We further impose all the additional conditions\r\n  recommended by the Panel, i.e., restitution, as well as 24 months of mentoring\r\n  and counseling.Â  We order respondent to pay the costs of these disciplinary\r\n  proceedings to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct within 30 days of the date of\r\n  this opinion.\r\nDEFINITE\r\n  SUSPENSION.Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Report states that:\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  mentorâ€™s duties should include, at a minimum, regular meetings or interviews\r\n  with Respondent and a monthly review of Respondentâ€™s law office practices to\r\n  include Respondentâ€™s trust accounting and reconciliation practices.Â  Respondent\r\n  should be responsible for submitting quarterly reports from the mentor to the\r\n  Office of Commission Counsel for the entire twenty four (24) month period.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the Panel\r\n  also recommended that the mentor assist respondent in preparing a list of the\r\n  cases that he is handling so that he and the mentor could go over the list on a\r\n  monthly basis.\r\n[2] ODC does not object to: (1) the remaining\r\n  recommendations by the Panel; and (2) any imposed sanction being applied\r\n  retroactively to the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26687","title":"In the Matter of Derwin Thomas Brannon","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26687","description":"This is a disciplinary opinion in which the Court definitely suspended a lawyer.","date":"2009-07-13","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n  STATE OF\r\n  \r\n      \r\n  SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn\r\n  The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Derwin Thomas\r\n      Brannon, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26687\r\nSubmitted June 12, 2009 - Filed July 13, 2009Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

Young, of\r\n \r\n  Clinton,\r\n  for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\n  respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent\r\n  admits misconduct and consents to any sanction within Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  He\r\n  requests that, if the Court imposes a suspension, the suspension be made\r\n  retroactive to April 30, 2008, the date of his interim suspension.Â  In the Matter of Brannon,\r\n  377 S.C. 474, 661 S.E.2d 98 (2008).Â  We accept the agreement and impose a one year suspension, retroactive to\r\n  the date of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained to represent Complainant A in an automobile accident case where\r\n  Complainant A had previously received a settlement offer of $11,000.00 from the\r\n  insurance company.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  file suit prior to the expiration of the statute of limitations.Â  Respondent admits he failed to adequately\r\n  communicate with Complainant A regarding the case both before and after the\r\n  statute of limitations expired.Â  \r\nBy\r\n  letter from ODC dated October 15, 2007, respondent was notified of the\r\n  complaint in this matter.Â  He did not\r\n  file a response withinÂ  fifteen (15) days, as requested; instead, he asked ODC for a\r\n  fifteen (15) day extension of time in which to file a response.Â  ODC agreed to the extension, giving\r\n  respondent until November 14, 2007, to respond to the complaint.Â  No response was received.Â  On December 11, 2007, ODC sent respondent a\r\n  letter pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240\r\n  (1982), again requesting a response.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 19, 2008, respondent was served with a Notice of Full Investigation\r\n  requesting a response within thirty (30) days.Â  Respondent did not respond within thirty (30) days. Respondent filed a\r\n  response to the Notice of Full Investigation on May 16, 2008, almost two months\r\n  after his response was due.Â  \r\nMatter II\r\nIn\r\n  September 2007, Complainant B retained respondent for representation in a civil\r\n  matter.Â  Complainant B paid respondent a\r\n  $5,000.00 retainer fee.Â  Respondent\r\n  admits he failed to keep Complainant B reasonably informed regarding the status\r\n  of her case and failed to return or respond to her numerous telephone calls,\r\n  pages, and emails.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  October 30, 2007, respondent told Complainant B that he had not done any work\r\n  on her case.Â  He promised to write a\r\n  demand letter to the defendantâ€™s lawyer by the end of the week, but failed to\r\n  do so.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  instructed his staff to cancel his November 15, 2007, appointment with\r\n  Complainant B two hours prior to the scheduled meeting.Â  Respondentâ€™s staff promised Complainant B\r\n  that respondent would telephone her later on November 15, 2007, after he spoke with\r\n  defense counsel.Â  Respondent did not\r\n  contact Complainant B on November 15, 2007, as promised, and, as of December\r\n  12, 2007, he still had not made any contact with Complainant B.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  February 19, 2008, respondent was served with a Notice of Full Investigation\r\n  requesting a response within thirty (30) days.Â  Respondent failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation prior\r\n  to the expiration of the thirty (30) day period.Â  Respondent filed a response on May 16, 2008,\r\n  almost two months after his response was due.Â  Â Â \r\nMatter III\r\nOn\r\n  March 19, 2008, respondent was mailed a Notice to Appear before Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel on April 22, 2008, at 10:00 a.m., in reference to Matter I and Matter\r\n  II.Â  He was also mailed a subpoena\r\n  commanding him to bring client files in Matter I and Matter II.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to appear on April 22, 2008, and failed to communicate with Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel regarding his scheduled appointment.Â  Respondent also failed to produce the subpoenaed information on or\r\n  before April 22, 2008, and, thereby, failed to comply with the subpoena. \r\nMatter IV\r\nOn\r\n  April 17, 2006, respondent issued a check to a client in the amount of\r\n  $2,500.00 as partial reimbursement of the clientâ€™s retainer fee. Â The balance in respondentâ€™s trust account\r\n  (Account One) per the April 30, 2006 bank statement was $31,344.00.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  following year, respondent opened a new trust account (Account Two) with a\r\n  different bank.Â  Other than allowing\r\n  outstanding checks to clear Account One, respondent ceased using Account One\r\n  and began using Account Two as his active trust account.Â  The client attempted to cash the check\r\n  written on Account One, but was unable to cash the check due to insufficient\r\n  funds in Account One.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  he failed to maintain an accurate accounting and financial record of the funds\r\n  remaining in Account One and that he failed to properly reconcile his account\r\n  to insure that sufficient funds remained in Account One to satisfy all\r\n  outstanding checks written on that account.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his conduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules\r\n  of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client); Rule\r\n  1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing\r\n  client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of\r\n  matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests for information); Rule 3.2\r\n  (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite litigation consistent with\r\n  the interests of client); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safeguard client funds); Rule\r\n  8.1(b) (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for\r\n  information from a disciplinary authority); Â Â Â Â Â Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct\r\n  for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule 8.4(e) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct prejudicial to administration of\r\n  justice).Â  In addition, respondent admits\r\n  that his actions constitute grounds for discipline under the following\r\n  provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to willfully fail to appear personally as\r\n  directed, willfully fail to comply with a subpoena issued under the RLDE, or\r\n  knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to\r\n  include a request for a response or appearance under Rule 19, RLDE).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and suspend respondent from the practice of law for one\r\n  (1) year, retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  In addition, pursuant to the agreement,\r\n  respondent shall pay the costs incurred by ODC and the Commission on Lawyer\r\n  Conduct within thirty (30) days of the date of this opinion.Â  Within fifteen (15) days of the filing of\r\n  this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied\r\n  with the requirements of Rule 30 of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary\r\n  Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26688","title":"McMillian v.

Petrano, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:Â  Ervin\r\n  McMillian[1] filed a petition for a writ of certiorari seeking review of an order denying\r\n  his application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  We granted the petition to\r\n  decide the following question:Â  Was counsel ineffective for advising McMillian\r\n  that the intent to commit a crime could be inferred from the act of\r\n  trespassing, such that it would provide a factual basis to support a plea to\r\n  first-degree burglary?Â  We hold counsel was not ineffective and affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nMcMillian was\r\n  charged with first-degree burglary as a result of an incident that occurred in Columbia, South Carolina on April 10, 2004.Â  At approximately 1:00 a.m. on that date,\r\n  McMillian knocked on the door of the home of Lanelle Hicks and her adult son,\r\n  Mark Hicks.Â  Lanelle Hicks looked out a window and saw McMillian, so she went\r\n  to her sonâ€™s room to wake him.Â  At that point, McMillianâ€™s knocking turned into\r\n  beating on the door, and then he crashed the door open, damaging the door.Â  As\r\n  soon as McMillian entered the house, however, Mark Hicks took McMillian back\r\n  outside and held him there with the assistance of a neighbor until the police\r\n  arrived.Â  \r\nMcMillian\r\n  subsequently pled guilty to the charge of first-degree burglary.Â  At the plea\r\n  proceeding, McMillian stated that he â€œhad been drinking and druggingâ€ (with\r\n  crack cocaine) the night of the incident and that he thought someone was\r\n  chasing him and trying to kill him.Â  McMillian maintained he knocked on the\r\n  door of the Hicks home in order to get some help, but he admitted that he pushed\r\n  the door open to get inside the home.Â  McMillian stated he believed he â€œwas\r\n  justified in asking for help,â€ but admitted that he â€œknow[s] that [he] did\r\n  wrong.â€Â  \r\nIn contrast, the\r\n  solicitor advised the plea judge that according to the victims they never heard\r\n  McMillian ask for help and â€œhe never asked for the police.Â  All he did was kick\r\n  their door in and rip the door jam off.â€Â  Earlier in the plea proceeding, the\r\n  solicitor noted that McMillian has a criminal record dating back to 1977 that\r\n  includes prior convictions for, among other things, housebreaking, malicious\r\n  injury to real property, second-degree burglary, and strong armed robbery.\r\nIn a separate\r\n  sentencing proceeding, McMillian again admitted he â€œpushed the door open,â€ but\r\n  maintained he did not â€œgo there with the intent to take anything.â€Â  The plea\r\n  judge sentenced McMillian to nineteen years in prison for first-degree\r\n  burglary.Â  No direct appeal was taken.Â  \r\nMcMillian filed a\r\n  PCR application.Â  At the PCR hearing, McMillian asserted, among his claims,\r\n  that his attorney did not explain to him that the State must prove not only\r\n  that he had broken into the victimsâ€™ home, but that he did so with the intent\r\n  to commit a crime.Â  He maintained he would have exercised his right to go to\r\n  trial and would not have pled guilty if his attorney had properly advised him\r\n  that there was no evidence to support an inference of his intent to commit a\r\n  crime.Â Â  \r\nMcMillianâ€™s counsel\r\n  testified that she believed there was evidence of intent to commit a crime and\r\n  that she had advised McMillian of all the elements of first-degree burglary.Â \r\n  Counsel stated, â€œI explained that to Mr. McMillian, that the intent could be\r\n  inferred from the trespassing because it was not his property, and he was\r\n  illegally on someone elseâ€™s property, and he broke the door down of -- pushed\r\n  the door open.Â  I said that it could be inferred from -- trespass could be with\r\n  the intent to commit a crime.Â  Trespass could be inferred from these actions.â€Â  \r\nCounsel stated she\r\n  hired a private investigator to look into McMillianâ€™s story that he had been\r\n  chased by someone and, â€œ[a]fter a period of time . . . he [McMillian] said the\r\n  person kind of existed in his head, I guess.â€Â  She said a neighbor saw\r\n  McMillian â€œlooking in the windows of the home prior to him just bursting in the\r\n  door.â€Â  Thus, she could not substantiate McMillianâ€™s claim that he believed\r\n  someone was chasing him.Â  \r\nMcMillianâ€™s PCR\r\n  attorney contended McMillianâ€™s assertion that he was high on drugs and thought\r\n  he was being chased when he went to the home did not support a charge of\r\n  first-degree burglary, as he had no intent to commit a crime, and plea counsel\r\n  erred in advising him that intent to commit a crime could be inferred from an\r\n  act of trespass.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge\r\n  denied McMillianâ€™s application and found the allegation that there was no\r\n  factual basis to support a plea to first-degree burglary was without merit.Â \r\n  The judge noted:Â  â€œCounsel testified that had she gone to trial, intent to\r\n  commit a crime could be inferred from the act of trespassing.Â  Applicant\r\n  testified that he did not own the house and did not have permission to enter\r\n  the house.Â  Further, the evidence suggested that he physically broke the door\r\n  open to enter.Â  Accordingly, this allegation is denied and dismissed.â€Â  \r\nMcMillianâ€™s\r\n  attorney submitted a Johnson[2] petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR order.Â  This Court directed\r\n  the parties to brief the following issue:Â  Was counsel ineffective in advising\r\n  McMillian that the intent to commit a crime could be inferred from the act of\r\n  trespassing, such that it would provide a factual basis to support a plea to\r\n  first-degree burglary?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nThe Sixth Amendment\r\n  to the United States Constitution guarantees a defendant the right to effective\r\n  assistance of counsel.Â  U.S. Const. amend. VI; Strickland v. Washington,\r\n  466 U.S. 668 (1984); Lomax v. State, 379 S.C. 93, 665 S.E.2d 164\r\n  (2008).Â  \r\nThe United States\r\n  Supreme Court has announced a two-pronged test to establish ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel by which a PCR applicant must show (1) counselâ€™s performance\r\n  was deficient, and (2) the deficient performance prejudiced the defendant.Â  Strickland,\r\n  466 U.S. at 687; Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 386 S.E.2d 624 (1989).Â \r\n  Under the second prong, the PCR applicant â€œmust show that there is a reasonable\r\n  probability that, but for counselâ€™s unprofessional errors, the result of the\r\n  proceeding would have been different.â€Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 694.\r\nThe two-part test\r\n  adopted in Strickland also â€œapplies to challenges to guilty pleas based\r\n  on ineffective assistance of counsel.â€Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 58 (1985).Â  In the context of a guilty plea, the applicant â€œmust show that there\r\n  is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, he would not have\r\n  pleaded guilty and would have insisted on going to trial.â€Â  Id. at 59.Â  â€œThe\r\n  longstanding test for determining the validity of a guilty plea is â€˜whether the\r\n  plea represents a voluntary and intelligent choice among the alternative\r\n  courses of action open to the defendant.â€™â€Â  Id. at 56 (quoting North\r\n    Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 31 (1970)).\r\nâ€œIn a PCR\r\n  proceeding, the burden is on the applicant to prove the allegations in his\r\n  application.â€Â  Lounds v. State, 380 S.C. 454, 460, 670 S.E.2d 646,\r\n  649&nbsp;(2008).Â  â€œIn resolving PCR issues relating to guilty pleas, it is\r\n  proper to consider the guilty plea transcript as well as the evidence at the\r\n  PCR hearing.â€Â  Pelzer v. State, 381 S.C. 217, 222, 672 S.E.2d 790,\r\n  792&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2009).\r\nâ€œThis Court will\r\n  uphold the findings of the PCR judge when there is any evidence of probative\r\n  value to support them.â€Â  Suber v. State, 371 S.C. 554, 558, 640 S.E.2d\r\n  884, 886&nbsp;(2007).Â  â€œThis Court will reverse the PCR judgeâ€™s decision when\r\n  it is controlled by an error of law.â€Â  Id. at 558-59, 640 S.E.2d at 886.\r\nFirst-degree\r\n  burglary is a statutory offense in South Carolina that is defined as follows:Â \r\n  â€œA person is guilty of burglary in the first degree if the person enters a\r\n  dwelling without consent and with intent to commit a crime in the\r\n  dwelling, andâ€ any one of several enumerated aggravating circumstances\r\n  exists.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-311(A) (2003) (emphasis added).Â  In this case,\r\n  the aggravating circumstance is â€œthe\r\n  entering or remaining occurs in the nighttime.â€Â  Id. Â§\r\n  16-11-311(A)(3).Â Â Â  \r\nOn review,\r\n  McMillian asserts he received ineffective assistance of counsel because\r\n  â€œ[t]here is ambiguous precedent on whether one can infer intent [to commit a\r\n  crime] from trespassing.â€Â  \r\nThis Court has\r\n  previously held that for a charge under the old statute of housebreaking, i.e.,\r\n  breaking and entering into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or a\r\n  crime of a lesser grade, found in section 1139 of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  1932, the element of intent to commit a crime of a lesser grade could be\r\n  satisfied by a trespass.Â  See State v. Christensen, 194\r\n  S.C. 131, 9 S.E.2d 555 (1940).Â  In Christensen, â€œthe defendant was\r\n  convicted of breaking and entering with the intent to commit a misdemeanor, to\r\n  wit, a trespassâ€ after the defendant, who was an agent of the landlord, went\r\n  into a tenantâ€™s dwelling with the specific intent of taking personal property\r\n  to sell for overdue rent.Â  Id. at 138, 9 S.E.2d at 558.Â  \r\nThe Christensen Court cited a prior decision that stated the mere breaking and entering of a\r\n  house is not a crime under the statute prohibiting the breaking and entering\r\n  into a dwelling with the intent to commit a felony or a crime of a lesser\r\n  grade,[3] but found that if Christensen were guilty of a trespass, â€œ[i]t was for the jury\r\n  to say whether such breaking and entry under the circumstances constituted a\r\n  crime under Section 1139 and the finding of the jury on this issue will not be\r\n  disturbed by this Court.â€Â  Id. at 137-39, 9 S.E.2d at 558-59. \r\nMcMillian argues\r\n  counsel was ineffective in advising him that intent to commit a crime could be\r\n  inferred from a trespass.Â  We disagree.Â  In its general sense, to â€œtrespassâ€ is\r\n  â€œto make an unwarranted or uninvited incursionâ€ onto the property of another.Â  Websterâ€™s\r\n    Third New International Dictionary 2439 (2002).[4]Â \r\n  Â Â \r\nCertainly, a jury\r\n  would have been free to disbelieve McMillianâ€™s version of events and find that\r\n  he had the intent to commit a crime based on his conduct at the time of this\r\n  offense.Â  In State v. Haney, 257 S.C. 89, 91, 184 S.E.2d 344, 345\r\n  (1971), this Court observed that â€œproof of intent necessarily rests on inference\r\n  from conduct.â€Â  We noted the unexplained breaking and entry of a dwelling in\r\n  the night is itself evidence of intent to commit larceny:\r\n\r\n  When the\r\n    building entered is a dwelling house, the weight of authority holds that the unexplained\r\n    breaking and entry in the night is itself evidence of intent to commit larceny\r\n    rather than some other crime.Â  â€˜The fundamental theory, in the absence of other\r\n    intent or explanation for breaking and entering, is that the usual object or\r\n    purpose of burglarizing a dwelling house at night is theft.â€™Â  13 Am.Jur.2d\r\n    Burglary, Sec. 52 (1964).\r\n\r\nId. at 91-92, 184 S.E.2d at 345.Â  A similar view was\r\n  expressed by the Supreme Court of Wyoming, which stated:\r\n\r\n  The law\r\n    is well settled and widespread that where one breaks into the property of\r\n    another in the nighttime, an inference may be drawn that he did so with the\r\n    intent to commit larceny.Â  A reasonable mind recognizes that people do not\r\n    usually break into and enter the building of another under the shroud of darkness\r\n    with innocent intent and that the most usual intent is to steal. . . .Â  Direct\r\n    evidence to prove intent is not necessary. . . .Â  Proof of intent is not a\r\n    precise process.\r\n\r\nMirich v. State, 593 P.2d 590, 593 (Wyo. 1979).\r\nMoreover, even if\r\n  we interpret McMillianâ€™s argument as being that counsel was ineffective because\r\n  she referred to unlawful trespass and he did not meet the elements of an\r\n  unlawful trespass because there was no entry after notice, we find there is no\r\n  merit to this allegation.Â  There was notice against entry in this case because,\r\n  as we noted in Christensen, â€œthe presence of closed doors and locked\r\n  windows [i]s notice to the world that entry is forbidden.â€Â  Christensen,\r\n  194 S.C. at 141, 9 S.E.2d at 560. Â \r\nMcMillian was\r\n  facing a possible sentence of life in prison[5] and, based on the colloquy in the transcript, it appears he had hoped for a\r\n  suspended sentence of less than fifteen years.Â  When that did not occur, he\r\n  brought this PCR action.Â  We hold that the fact that counsel advised McMillian that\r\n  a jury could disbelieve his version of events and could find that\r\n  he entered the dwelling without consent and with the intent to commit a crime was\r\n  not erroneous advice and counsel was not deficient in her representation. Accordingly,\r\n  the PCR judge did not err in denying McMillianâ€™s PCR application.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, the order of the PCR judge is\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J. and\r\n  KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion in which\r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I agree with the majority that counsel was not\r\n  ineffective in advising petitioner that a jury could find the requisite intent\r\n  to commit a crime for purposes of burglary from his trespass into the Hicksâ€™\r\n  home.Â  I write separately, however, as I do not join the discussion of\r\n  statutory â€œtrespass after noticeâ€ as I believe it is not implicated by these\r\n  facts. See State v. Bradley, 126 S.C. 528, 120 S.E. 240 (1923); State\r\n    v. Cross, 323 S.C. 41, 448 S.E.2d 569 (Ct. App. 1994) (common law trespass\r\n  discussed). \r\nWALLER, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Ervin McMillian is also referred to as â€œErvin\r\n  Brittonâ€ in various documents in the Appendix.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Johnson v. State, 294 S.C. 310, 364 S.E.2d\r\n  201 (1988).\r\n[3]Â Â  The Christensen Court cited State v.\r\n  Clark, 85 S.C. 273, 67 S.E. 300 (1910), which provides in relevant part as\r\n  follows:Â  \r\n\r\n  The\r\n    first count of the indictment is laid under section 145 of the Criminal Code,\r\n    which is as follows:Â  â€œEvery person who shall break and enter, or who shall\r\n    break with intent to enter, in the day time, any dwelling house or other house,\r\n    or who shall break and enter, or shall break with intent to enter, in the night\r\n    time, any house, the breaking and entering of which would not constitute\r\n    burglary, with intent to commit a felony or other crime of a lesser grade,\r\n    shall be held guilty of a felony,â€ etc.Â  Under this statute, the mere breaking of a house is not a crime, nor is the mere breaking and entering of a\r\n    house, or the mere breaking with intent to enter a house any crime.Â  It\r\n    is only when there is a breaking and entering, or a breaking with intent to\r\n    enter, â€œwith intent to commit a felony, or other crime of a lesser gradeâ€\r\n    that the crime denounced by the statute is complete.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Id. at 277-78, 67 S.E. at 302 (emphasis in original). \r\n[4]Â  In contrast, an unlawful trespass, or what is\r\n  commonly called trespass after notice, is distinguishable and is prohibited by section\r\n  16-11-620 of the South Carolina Code, which provides as follows:\r\n\r\n  Any\r\n    person who, without legal cause or good excuse, enters into the dwelling house,\r\n    place of business, or on the premises of another person after having been\r\n    warned not to do so or any person who, having entered into the dwelling house,\r\n    place of business, or on the premises of another person without having been\r\n    warned fails and refuses, without good cause or good excuse, to leave\r\n    immediately upon being ordered or requested to do so by the person in\r\n    possession or his agent or representative shall, on conviction, be fined not\r\n    more than two hundred dollars or be imprisoned for not more than thirty days.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-11-620\r\n  (2003). \r\n[5] Â First-degree burglary is a felony punishable by life\r\n  imprisonment, although the court, in its discretion, may sentence a defendant\r\n  to a term of not less than fifteen years.Â  S.C.

Ravenhorst, all of Wyche,\r\n  Burgess, Freeman &amp; Parham, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â  Following litigation between\r\n  Petitioners Dan F. Williamson and Dan F. Williamson and Company (collectively\r\n  \"Williamson\") and Respondent Alfred C. Middleton (\"Middleton\"), a former\r\n  employee, the trial court awarded Middleton $35,000 in attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  The\r\n  Court of Appeals upheld the award after en banc rehearing. Â Williamson\r\n    v. Middleton, 374 S.C. 419, 649 S.E.2d 57 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We granted certiorari.Â \r\n  Williamson argues that the Court of Appeals committed various errors in hearing\r\n  the case en banc, that there is no evidence on which to affirm the\r\n  finding that Middleton would pay his attorneys, and that the attorneyâ€™s fees\r\n  are unreasonable.Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nMiddleton\r\n  worked for a number of years for Williamson as a salesman.Â  Middleton received\r\n  both an annual salary and commissions on sales contracts.Â  During his\r\n  employment, there was a dispute as to the amount of salary and commissions owed\r\n  Middleton and he eventually resigned.\r\nMiddleton went to\r\n  work with one of Williamsonâ€™s suppliers.Â  He continued to seek commissions he\r\n  was due but Williamson refused his requests.Â  Middleton then consulted with\r\n  James C. Parham of the Wyche Burgess law firm, who was a personal friend of\r\n  Middleton.Â  On behalf of Middleton, Parham attempted to secure the payment of\r\n  the commissions.Â  Ultimately, Williamson filed suit against Middleton alleging\r\n  breach of fiduciary duty, among other things.Â  Middleton timely filed an Answer\r\n  denying the allegations contained in the Complaint and asserting counterclaims\r\n  based on the alleged non-payment of the commissions and wages owed him.\r\nFrom\r\n  the beginning, Williamson hindered the progress of the case by making vague and\r\n  incomplete responses to interrogatories, cancelling multiple depositions and\r\n  mediation at the last-minute, and attempting to add new parties and causes of\r\n  action to the lawsuit despite the trial courtâ€™s denial of a motion to amend the\r\n  pleadings.Â  Williamsonâ€™s actions required Middletonâ€™s counsel to devote\r\n  additional time to the case.\r\nAt\r\n  trial, only Williamsonâ€™s cause of action for breach of fiduciary duty went to\r\n  the jury, which returned a verdict in favor of Middleton.Â  The jury also\r\n  considered Middletonâ€™s counterclaim for unpaid commissions and awarded him\r\n  $906.62 in actual damages.Â  The trial judge found Middleton was entitled to\r\n  attorneysâ€™ fees.Â  After Middleton presented records showing attorneysâ€™ fees\r\n  totaling approximately $106,000, the trial judge awarded $35,000 in attorneysâ€™\r\n  fees.Â  Williamson appealed to the Court of Appeals which reversed the award.Â  Middleton\r\n  petitioned for rehearing and the Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals en banc voted 5-4 to affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\n  Â Williamson, supra.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tI.\r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  granting and conducting rehearing en banc?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tII. \r\n\t\t\tDid the Court of Appeals err in\r\n  concluding that there was competent evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  finding that there was a fee agreement?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI.&nbsp; Court of Appeals Procedural\r\n  Issues\r\nWilliamson\r\n  argues on appeal that the Court of Appeals committed a number of procedural\r\n  errors in granting and conducting rehearing en banc.Â  We find no error.\r\nFollowing\r\n  the decision by the three-judge panel, Middleton petitioned for rehearing of\r\n  the case and the Court of Appeals granted rehearing en banc.Â  Though the endorsement letter showing that the Court\r\n  of Appeals granted rehearing en banc shows the signatures of only five\r\n  judges, six judges actually voted for rehearing.[1]Â \r\n  After rehearing, the Court of Appeals en\r\n    banc voted 5-4 to affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision. Â \r\nWilliamson\r\n  first argues that the Court of Appeals erred in granting rehearing en banc on the votes of only five judges because S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-8-90(a)(1)\r\n  requires six votes to hear a case en banc. S.C. Code Ann. 14-8-90(a)(1)\r\n  (2008).Â  As referenced above, a letter from the Clerk of the Court of Appeals\r\n  explained that the signature of Judge Williams was mistakenly omitted from the\r\n  endorsement letter.Â  In fact, the Clerk explained that six judges voted to hear\r\n  the case en banc.Â  Consequently, Williamsonâ€™s argument is without\r\n  merit.Â  Next, Williamson contends that even if six judges voted to hear the\r\n  case en banc, sufficient grounds did not exist to support rehearing\r\n  under Rule 219 of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules (SCACR).Â  We note\r\n  that while Rule 219 lists certain grounds on which rehearing en banc may\r\n  be granted, it provides only that rehearing en banc \"ordinarily will not be ordered\" except upon the listed grounds. Â Rule 219, SCACR (2007)\r\n  (emphasis added).Â  The Court of Appeals has discretion as to whether or not to\r\n  accept rehearing and we find no error in the exercise of such discretion here. \r\nWilliamson\r\n  next argues that six votes of the Court of Appeals en banc were required\r\n  to uphold the award of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Williamson notes that S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  14-8-90(b) requires six votes of the en banc panel to reverse \"the\r\n  judgment below.\"Â  In Williamsonâ€™s view, \"the judgment below\" is the opinion of\r\n  the three-judge panel rather than the decision of the trial court.Â  We disagree\r\n  and find no error. Â See Rule 202(b)(1), SCACR (2007) (defining term\r\n  \"lower court\" as \"the circuit court . . . from which the appeal is taken\"); State\r\n    v. McAteer, 333 S.C. 615, 616, 511 S.E.2d 79, 80 (Ct. App. 1998), overruled\r\n      on other grounds, 340 S.C. 644, 532 S.E.2d 865 (2000) (granting of\r\n  rehearing en banc by the Court of Appeals effectively vacates the\r\n  original panel opinion).\r\nWilliamsonâ€™s\r\n  final procedural argument is that the Court of Appeals erred in failing to\r\n  limit its review to the existence or non-existence of a fee agreement, since in\r\n  Williamsonâ€™s view, the Court of Appeals granted rehearing only as to this\r\n  issue.Â  We disagree.\r\n\r\nII.&nbsp; Did the Court of Appeals\r\n  err in concluding there was competent evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  finding of a fee agreement?\r\nThe\r\n  jury awarded Middleton $906.62 for unpaid commissions pursuant to S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 39-65-20 (2008), which requires that when a contract between a sales\r\n  representative and principal is terminated, the principal must pay all\r\n  commissions due.Â  When an employer violates Â§ 39-65-20, Â§ 39-65-30 provides\r\n  that the employer is liable for \"attorneyâ€™s fees actually and reasonably\r\n  incurred by the sales representative in the action and court costs.\" Â S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 39-65-30 (2008).\r\nWilliamson\r\n  argues that the Court of Appeals en banc erred in finding that competent\r\n  evidence supports the finding that fees were incurred.Â  We agree.\r\nMiddletonâ€™s\r\n  counsel was deposed on the issue of attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  He acknowledged that he\r\n  and Middleton were personal friends, that he had handled other legal matters\r\n  for Middleton in the past without taking a fee, and that Middleton was never\r\n  sent any statements of attorneyâ€™s fees incurred.Â  Furthermore, Middletonâ€™s\r\n  counsel answered in the negative when specifically asked if Middleton incurred\r\n  any attorneyâ€™s fees:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tQ.\r\n\t\t\tHas Mr. Middleton incurred any attorneyâ€™s fees from \r\n\t\t\tthis representation?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\tA.\r\n\t\t\tNo, technically, he hasnâ€™t because we donâ€™t have a \r\n\t\t\tfee agreement with Mr. Middleton.&nbsp; We talked about this with \r\n\t\t\tMr. Middleton to begin with and we decided that we would try to help \r\n\t\t\thim collect the monies due him and at the end of the case, we would \r\n\t\t\ttalk about a fee.&nbsp; So we donâ€™t have a fee agreement with him.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tBut some day, he might pay us a fee.&nbsp; Right now, he has no \r\n\t\t\tobligation at this point if there is no agreement.&nbsp; He might \r\n\t\t\tfeel a moral obligation.&nbsp; And when we talk at the end of the \r\n\t\t\tcase, he will have the final say.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Court\r\n  of Appeals en banc found competent evidence to support the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that attorneyâ€™s fees were incurred.Â  The majority noted that the\r\n  statement cited by Williamson could be interpreted in different ways:\r\n\r\n\tWhile Parhamâ€™s testimony . . . could be interpreted to\r\n  mean Middleton would never be required to pay a fee, it also indicates that \"at\r\n  the end of the case, [Middleton and his attorneys] would talk about a fee.\"Â  [The\r\n  trial court] adopted this latter interpretation . . . .\r\n\r\nWilliamson, 374 S.C. at 429, 649 S.E.2d at 63.\r\nWe\r\n  find no competent evidence to support the finding that Middleton incurred\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  Though Middletonâ€™s counsel did indeed indicate that he and\r\n  Middleton would \"talk about a fee\" at the conclusion of the case, he also\r\n  explained that Middleton had no obligation other than a moral obligation to pay\r\n  a fee and that Middleton would have the final say.Â  In our view, the only\r\n  logical interpretation of the statement by Middletonâ€™s counsel is that\r\n  Middleton could choose not to pay a fee to his counsel.Â  It therefore follows\r\n  that no attorneyâ€™s fees were incurred.[2]\r\nAs\r\n  evidence that attorneyâ€™s fees were actually incurred, the Court of Appeals en\r\n    banc noted that Parham testified that he was \"hired\" by Middleton in the\r\n  Spring of 2001 and had kept extensive and diligent records detailing the amount\r\n  of time spent on the case and by whom the work was done.Â  The Court of Appeals en\r\n    banc also found that it was unlikely that Middletonâ€™s second-chair\r\n  attorney, Wyche associate Patricia Ravenhorst, who had no prior relationship\r\n  with Middleton, would have volunteered her time with no expectation of being\r\n  paid.Â  We find that these facts simply cannot overcome the candid admission by\r\n  Middletonâ€™s counsel that no fees were incurred.[3]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals did not err in granting and conducting rehearing en banc.Â \r\n  On the merits, we find no evidence to support the finding of the Court of\r\n  Appeals that Middleton incurred attorneyâ€™s fees.Â  We affirm the remaining\r\n  issues under Rule 220(b), SCACR.Â  Therefore, the decision of the Court of\r\n  Appeals is\r\nREVERSED. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justices Ellis B. Drew and S. Jackson\r\n  Kimball, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The signature of Judge Bruce Williams was mistakenly omitted from the\r\n  endorsement letter.\r\n[2] At oral argument, Middletonâ€™s counsel argued that the recent opinion in Kiriakides\r\n  v. School Dist. of Greenville County, 382 S.C. 8, 675 S.E.2d 439 (2009),\r\n  governs this case.Â  We disagree.Â  In Kiriakides, we found \"no reason to\r\n  differentiate situations where a party terminates the attorney and those where\r\n  the condemnor terminates the proceeding.\"Â  Id. at 24, 675 S.E.2d at 448.Â \r\n  We therefore upheld the award of attorneysâ€™ fees where the client had a\r\n  contingency fee agreement with his attorneys and the opposing party abandoned\r\n  the condemnation action that was the subject of the litigation.Â  Id. at 25, 675 S.E.2d at 448.Â  The instant case does not concern a terminated\r\n  proceeding in which the court must consider implied fees, but rather a\r\n  completed proceeding in which the attorney testified that no fees were owed.Â Â  \r\n[3] Because we find that no evidence supports the Court of Appeals finding that\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees were incurred, we do not reach Williamsonâ€™s argument that the\r\n  fees awarded were unreasonable.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26690","title":"Skinner v.

Clawson and Margaret M.\r\n  Urbanic, both of Clawson &amp; Staubes, all of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  This is an appeal from an order granting summary\r\n  judgment to the respondents, finding they owed no duty to appellants, and also\r\n  holding that appellantsâ€™ negligence claim failed for lack of proximate cause.Â \r\n  We affirm, finding that appellants have not shown the existence of a duty and\r\n  therefore do not reach the proximate cause issue.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant Skinners\r\n  were injured when their automobile was struck head on by a car driven by\r\n  appellant Drakeâ€™s decedent (Cook) after Cookâ€™s car crossed the center line of\r\n  Highway 61.Â  Cook apparently lost control when she veered onto the highwayâ€™s\r\n  shoulder near a driveway leading to a stable and subdivision.Â  Appellants sued\r\n  the highway department and defendants.[1]Â \r\n  The defendants include the owners of the stable and driveway, persons who own\r\n  land in the subdivision accessed by the driveway, and other persons who own\r\n  land adjoining Highway 61 near the driveway.Â  Only the defendants who own the\r\n  driveway and stable are respondents in the appeal.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the circuit court erred in finding respondents did not owe a duty to\r\n  appellants?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the circuit court erred in failing to find respondents owed a common law duty\r\n  to travelers on the highway.Â  Alternatively, appellants contend the source of\r\n  respondentsâ€™ duty is found in statutes or in regulatory enactments.Â  We agree\r\n  with the circuit court that respondents did not owe appellants a duty here.\r\nWhether a duty\r\n  exists is a question of law for the Court.Â  Doe v. Greenville County Sch. Dist., 375 S.C. 63, 651 S.E.2d 305 (2007).Â  Here, appellants posit a duty owed\r\n  by landowners whose property adjoins a public highway to travelers.Â \r\n  Specifically, appellants contend that ruts in the highwayâ€™s shoulder near the\r\n  driveway entrance to respondentsâ€™ property were the result of horse trailer\r\n  traffic, and that respondents have a duty to warn travelers of this dangerous\r\n  condition or to protect them from encountering it.Â  We find no such duty.\r\nAppellants rely on\r\n  several statutes and a Department of Transportation (DOT) Handbook[2]Â \r\n  as the source of a duty owed by respondents to travelers on the highway.Â  \r\nThe DOT regulations\r\n  to which appellants point regulates the construction of private roads which\r\n  intersect with a public highway, and allow a landowner to seek an encroachment\r\n  permit to use a highway right-of-way.Â  Here, respondents did not construct a\r\n  private road, and therefore did not need to seek such a permit.Â  In addition,\r\n  DOT did not exercise its authority and require them to obtain one.Â  These\r\n  regulations are inapplicable to respondents and are not a source of any duty.Â  Moreover,\r\n  they specifically impose the responsibility for maintaining rights-of-way, such\r\n  as highway shoulders, on the Department.\r\nAppellants also\r\n  maintain that respondents have a duty arising from statute.Â  Specifically, they\r\n  rely on three statutes:\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-7-10\r\n  \"Negligent, Willful or Wanton Damage to Highways\";\r\n\t2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â§ 57-7-260 \"Liability for\r\n  Corporations for Obstructions by their Agent\"; and\r\n\t3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Â§ 57-7-50 \"Cutting Trenches or Laying\r\n  Pipes or Tracks in State Highways or Bridges.\"\r\n\r\nSection 57-7-10 imposes\r\n  criminal liability on a person who willfully, wantonly, or negligently damages\r\n  a highway.Â  Appellants do not allege, much less prove, that this statute was\r\n  intended to create a private cause of action.Â  E.g., Adkins v. South\r\n    Carolina Depâ€™t of Corrections, 360 S.C. 413, 602 S.E.2d 51 (2006) (when\r\n  criminal statute implies private duty).Â  As for Â§ 57-7-260, there is no\r\n  evidence respondents obstructed the highway, nor any evidence they laid a pipe,\r\n  tracks, or trenches as contemplated by Â§ 57-7-50.Â  We affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling that neither the regulations nor the statutes cited by appellants create\r\n  a duty owed by respondents to travelers to warn of or to protect them from\r\n  shoulder ruts.Â  Adkins, supra.\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  held that respondents owed no common law duty to travelers on the highway as respondents\r\n  neither possessed nor had control over the highwayâ€™s shoulder.[3]Â  Miller v. City of Camden, 329 S.C. 310, 494 S.E.2d 813 (1997) (\"one who\r\n  has no control [over property] owes no duty\").Â  The court held a duty could\r\n  arise to travelers where the defendant \"actually created something to cause a\r\n  defect on the highway.\"Â  We agree that South Carolina common law only imposes a\r\n  duty for highway conditions where an individual or business has undertaken an\r\n  activity that creates an artificial condition on the highway which is dangerous\r\n  to travelers.\r\nAppellants rely\r\n  heavily on this Courtâ€™s decision in Dorrell v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Trans.,\r\n  361 S.C. 312, 605 S.E.2d 12 (2004).Â  In Dorrell, the Court held a\r\n  contractor who had repaved a highway in a manner that elevated the roadway\r\n  approximately one foot above the shoulder breached its common law duty of care\r\n  to the traveling public.Â  Appellants also cite Sessions v. Dickerson, Inc.,\r\n  265 S.C. 579, 220 S.E.2d 876 (1975), where the Court found there was evidence\r\n  of \"actionable negligence,\" but not specifically a duty to travelers, on the\r\n  part of a contractor repairing a highway.Â  We agree with the trial court that a\r\n  contractor performing highway alterations owes a duty to travelers, but we find\r\n  no analogous duty on the part of an owner of property abutting a highway who\r\n  neither possesses nor controls the highway.\r\nAppellants also contend\r\n  that since respondents own the driveway, and since allegedly it is the\r\n  utilization of this driveway which led to the ruts on the highway shoulder,\r\n  respondents \"created\" a defect on the highway and thus owed a duty to\r\n  travelers.Â  We disagree.\r\nAppellants cite a number\r\n  of cases where liability has been imposed on an abutting landowner where the\r\n  conduct of the landownerâ€™s business has created an artificial hazard on\r\n  the highway.Â  Clark v. Blue Circle, Inc., 514 S.E.2d 473 (Ga. Ct. App. 1999) (material spilled on roadway); Miller v. APAC-Ga., 399 S.E.2d 534\r\n  (Ga. Ct. App. 1990) (same); and Whitaker v. Honegger, 674 N.E.2d 1274 (Ill.

however, he\r\n  admitted that he became aroused while wrestling with her and that he may have\r\n  accidentally penetrated her.Â  In his first statement, Brown explained that he\r\n  just got too close to the child and that his penis \"might have hit her a couple\r\n  of times.\"Â  In his second statement, Brown stated that it was possible that\r\n  penetration occurred but that he did not intend to penetrate her.Â  Toward the\r\n  end of the interview, Brown stated \"I came . . . into her a couple of times but\r\n  not intentionally.\" Â When questioned at trial about the incident, Brown\r\n  testified that he was tickling and wrestling with the child but denied that he\r\n  penetrated her.Â  \r\nRhonda Turner,\r\n  Brownâ€™s ex-wife and the mother of the child, testified that during the time\r\n  leading up to the incident and the day of the incident, Brown was unemployed\r\n  and had access to her daughter during the daytime.Â  In describing her\r\n  relationship with Brown, she stated that they were married for approximately a\r\n  year and had a son, who was born on July 4, 2001.Â  Rhonda admitted that she\r\n  contracted gonorrhea from Brown.Â  She testified that she learned of the STD\r\n  when her physicianâ€™s office called her and instructed her to report to the\r\n  office on the Monday following the August 4, 2001 incident between Brown and\r\n  her daughter.Â  During that phone call, Rhonda was informed that she had tested\r\n  positive for gonorrhea and needed to be seen by her doctor.Â  Rhonda delayed\r\n  this visit for one day because she took her daughter to be medically evaluated\r\n  on the Monday following the incident.Â  As a result of this evaluation, the\r\n  child was given a shot for gonorrhea.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nWhen questioned\r\n  about the incident between Brown and her daughter, Rhonda testified that she\r\n  spoke with Brown about it at the Timmonsville Police Department.Â  During this\r\n  conversation, Brown said, \"Well, I mean, I may have, you know, been playing\r\n  with her; and my penis may have fallen out of my boxers; and I may have gotten\r\n  erected; and her panties may have gone to the side.\"Â  Rhonda, however,\r\n  testified that when she spoke with Brown again during a telephone conversation\r\n  he said \"he didnâ€™t do it.\" \r\nAs part of its\r\n  case, the State presented Kathy Saunders as an expert witness in \"child sexual\r\n  assault\" and \"child sexual abuse.\"Â  Saunders testified that she examined the\r\n  child two days after the incident because she was out-of-town and unable to\r\n  evaluate the child when she was taken to the emergency room immediately after\r\n  the incident with Brown.Â  As a result of her examination, Saunders discovered \"copious\"\r\n  amounts of green discharge coming from the childâ€™s vaginal opening.Â  Saunders\r\n  characterized this finding as a \"classic\" symptom of gonorrhea.Â  Although there\r\n  was no evidence of an acute injury causing vaginal tearing or bleeding,\r\n  Saunders noted in her examination that there was redness around the childâ€™s\r\n  labia and surrounding tissue.Â  Specifically, Saunders testified \"[t]here was\r\n  some mild redness, with what appeared to be resolution of labial lesions or\r\n  just some type of contact dermatitis.\"Â  She further stated the tissue in the\r\n  surrounding area \"appeared kind of red, very thickened or swollen.\"Â Â Â  Saunders\r\n  indicated that these physical findings could be consistent with \"someone\r\n  penetrating the [childâ€™s] labia.\"Â  In addition to her physical examination,\r\n  Saunders testified the childâ€™s mother told her that the child had recently been\r\n  wetting the bed, complained of stomach aches and nightmares, and had vaginal\r\n  discharge.Â  Saunders believed these symptoms could be indicative of sexual\r\n  abuse. \r\nIn addition to\r\n  Brownâ€™s testimony and the testimony of several character witnesses, the defense\r\n  presented evidence attempting to refute that Brown could have transmitted\r\n  gonorrhea to the child during the August 4, 2001 incident. Â Specifically, the\r\n  defense presented medical records which indicated that Brown had been treated\r\n  for gonorrhea on May 23, 2001, and July 26, 2001.Â  Â Â \r\nIn\r\n  support of its theory, the defense also offered the testimony of Dr. Elizabeth\r\n  Lynn Harvey Baker-Gibbs, an expert witness on the \"diagnosis and treatment of\r\n  sexual abuse.\"Â  Dr. Baker-Gibbs testified regarding the type and effectiveness\r\n  of the medication prescribed for the treatment of gonorrhea.Â  When presented\r\n  with the facts of the instant case, she opined that if Brown had properly taken\r\n  his prescribed medication on July 26, 2001, he would not have been contagious\r\n  after July 29, 2001.Â  Based on these facts, she ultimately concluded that Brown\r\n  would not have been contagious on August 4, 2001, the date of the incident.Â  Â Â \r\nFollowing\r\n  motions from counsel, the trial concluded with closing arguments.Â  At end of\r\n  his closing argument, the solicitor stated:\r\n\r\n\tI embrace my burden because I represent the State of South Carolina.Â  And I think someone said at the beginning of this trial this is trying to\r\n  protect the rights of people.Â  Well, I tell you what.Â  Iâ€™m here to protect the\r\n  innocent.Â  Iâ€™m here to protect [child victim] a four-year-old child now.Â \r\n  Three-year-old little child at that time.Â  And I am the last person that youâ€™re\r\n  going to hear speak up for her.\r\n\tSo, I ask you, when you go back in that jury room, you\r\n  speak up for [child victim].Â  We can never put her back to where she was before\r\n  this abuse occurred.Â  But we can make sure that the perpetrator is punished.Â \r\n  So when you go back in that jury room to deliberate, ladies and gentlemen,\r\n  speak up for [child victim].Â  \r\n\r\nBrownâ€™s\r\n  trial counsel did not object to these remarks.Â  The jury convicted Brown of\r\n  first-degree criminal sexual conduct with a minor and transmitting a sexual\r\n  disease.Â  Subsequently, the trial judge sentenced Brown to twenty-five years\r\n  imprisonment for the CSC charge and a concurrent term of thirty days\r\n  imprisonment for the transmission of a sexual disease charge.Â  \r\nBrown\r\n  appealed his convictions and sentences to the Court of Appeals.Â  In an\r\n  unpublished opinion, the Court of Appeals affirmed Brownâ€™s convictions and\r\n  sentences.Â  State v. Brown, Op. No. 2004-UP-358 (S.C. Ct. App. filed\r\n  June 4, 2004).Â  \r\nFollowing\r\n  the decision of the Court of Appeals, Brown filed a timely PCR application.Â \r\n  Once represented by counsel, Brown filed an amended PCR application.Â  In these\r\n  applications, Brown alleged his trial counsel was ineffective in several\r\n  respects, including counselâ€™s failure to object to the remarks made by the solicitor\r\n  in his closing argument. \r\nAt\r\n  the PCR hearing, Brownâ€™s counsel asserted the solicitorâ€™s comments \"to speak up\r\n  for the victim\" amounted to a \"Golden Rule\" type argument that has been deemed\r\n  improper by our state appellate courts.Â  Additionally, PCR counsel contended\r\n  the improper argument was prejudicial because it appealed to the passion and\r\n  prejudice of the jury by asking the jury to be an advocate for the child\r\n  victim.Â  \r\nBrownâ€™s\r\n  trial counsel, the only witness called to testify, admitted that an objection\r\n  should have been made to the solicitorâ€™s comments.Â Â  However, he stated the\r\n  reason \"those statements were not objected to was because I didnâ€™t want to\r\n  exacerbate a bad set of facts to point out to the jury something that would\r\n  already aggravate what appeared to be a pretty bad case.\"Â  Trial counsel also\r\n  pointed out the \"gravity of the evidence\" the State presented against Brown.Â  He\r\n  further noted he did not want to give the jury a reason to dislike or hate his\r\n  client.Â  \r\nIn an oral ruling,\r\n  the PCR judge informed counsel that he was granting Brown relief in the form of\r\n  a new trial solely on the ground that trial counsel was ineffective in failing\r\n  to object to the remarks made by the solicitor during closing argument.Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  detailed written order, the PCR judge explained that trial counselâ€™s failure to\r\n  object to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was \"clearly error.\"Â  The judge\r\n  further found that \"[t]here is a reasonable probability, based upon the\r\n  evidence before this Court, that failure to object to this inappropriate\r\n  argument undermined the confidence in the outcome in this trial.\"Â  \r\nIn\r\n  terms of the evidence, the judge concluded that there was not overwhelming\r\n  evidence of guilt given it \"consisted of very questionable eyewitness\r\n  testimony, [Brownâ€™s] two statements, and the fact that at some point, although\r\n  not at the time of the incident, [Brown] had gonorrhea.\"Â  The judge\r\n  characterized the eyewitness testimony as \"questionable\" in light of defense\r\n  counselâ€™s contention at trial that due to the position of the childâ€™s bedroom\r\n  window \"there was no possible way the witnesses could have seen what they\r\n  claimed to have seen.\"Â  Additionally, the judge referenced the Stateâ€™s expert\r\n  witness testimony that the child could not have tested positive for gonorrhea\r\n  the day after the incident and the testimony that Brown could not have been\r\n  contagious on the date of the incident.Â  The judge further noted that Brown\r\n  denied sexually assaulting the child and that there was no evidence of \"tearing\r\n  or obvious injury to the childâ€™s vagina.\"Â  \r\nThe\r\n  judge also rejected the Stateâ€™s contention that the solicitorâ€™s comments were\r\n  so limited that they could not have affected the trial.Â  Specifically, the\r\n  judge stated that \"[g]iven the seriousness of the offense and the emotions involved,\r\n  these comments were more than enough to place the jury in a position of being\r\n  asked to stand up for, help, protect, and advocate for a very small child.\"Â \r\n  The judge believed that \"[i]t is clear that the Solicitorâ€™s statements\r\n  encouraged the jury to depart from neutrality and decide the case based on\r\n  passion and bias rather than the evidence, which led to the juryâ€™s verdict\r\n  being undermined.\"Â  Ultimately, the PCR judge found trial counsel was\r\n  ineffective and, as a result, granted Brown a new trial as to both of his\r\n  convictions. \r\nThe\r\n  State petitioned for and was granted a writ of certiorari for this Court to\r\n  review the PCR judgeâ€™s order.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA\r\n  defendant has the right to the effective assistance of counsel under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment to the United States Constitution.Â  Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984).Â  \"There is a strong presumption that counsel rendered\r\n  adequate assistance and exercised reasonable professional judgment in making\r\n  all significant decisions in the case.\"Â  Tate v. State, 351 S.C. 418, 425,\r\n  570 S.E.2d 522, 526 (2002).Â  \r\nIn a\r\n  PCR proceeding, the applicant bears the burden of establishing that he is\r\n  entitled to relief.Â  Butler v. State, 286 S.C. 441, 334 S.E.2d\r\n  813 (1985).Â  In order to prove that counsel was ineffective, the PCR applicant\r\n  must show that: Â (1) counselâ€™s performance was deficient; and (2) there is a\r\n  reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the result of the trial\r\n  would have been different.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. 103, 109, 525\r\n  S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000) (citing Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).Â  \"A reasonable\r\n  probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome\r\n  of the trial.\"Â  Ard v. Catoe, 372 S.C. 318, 331, 642 S.E.2d 590, 596\r\n  (2007). Â \"Furthermore, when a defendantâ€™s conviction is challenged, â€˜the\r\n  question is whether there is a reasonable probability that, absent the errors,\r\n  the fact finder would have had a reasonable doubt respecting guilt.â€™\" Id. (quoting Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 695 (1984)).\r\nThis\r\n  Court will uphold the findings of the PCR court if there\r\n  is any evidence of probative value to support them. Â Cherry v. State,\r\n  300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).Â  However, if no probative\r\n  evidence supports these findings, the Court will not uphold the findings of the\r\n  PCR court. Â Jackson v. State, 355 S.C. 568, 570, 586 S.E.2d 562,\r\n  563 (2003).Â  \"The decision of the PCR judge may be reversed when it is controlled by an error\r\n  of law.\"Â  Hiott v. State, 381 S.C. 622, 625, 674 S.E.2d 491, 492 (2009).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  State contends the PCR judge erred in granting Brown a new trial on the ground\r\n  that his trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to certain portions\r\n  of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  Initially, the State asserts that counsel\r\n  was not ineffective given he \"articulated a valid reason for not objecting when\r\n  he stated he was worried about the jury hating his client.\" Â In support of this\r\n  assertion, the State points to the testimony of trial counsel that \"there was a\r\n  lot of evidence against [Brown] and that he did not wish to aggravate an\r\n  already bad situation.\"Â  The State also references trial counselâ€™s testimony\r\n  that the solicitorâ€™s comments were limited in that they were made \"quickly.\"Â  Even\r\n  if trial counselâ€™s performance was deficient in that there was no objection to\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s comments, the State claims that Brown was not prejudiced in\r\n  view of the overwhelming evidence of guilt presented at trial.Â  \r\n\"A solicitorâ€™s closing argument must be carefully tailored\r\n  so as not to appeal to the personal biases of the jury.\" Â Von Dohlen v.\r\n    State, 360 S.C. 598, 609, 602 S.E.2d 738, 744 (2004). Â \"The argument must\r\n  not be calculated to arouse the jurorsâ€™ passions or prejudices, and its content\r\n  should stay within the record and reasonable inferences that may be drawn\r\n  therefrom.\" Â Id. at 609-10, 602\r\n  S.E.2d at 744.\r\n\"â€˜While the\r\n  solicitor should prosecute vigorously, his duty is not to convict a defendant\r\n  but to see justice done.â€™\"Â  State v. Northcutt, 372 S.C. 207, 222, 641\r\n  S.E.2d 873, 881 (2007) (quoting State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 312, 278\r\n  S.E.2d 335, 339 (1981)).Â  \"â€˜The solicitorâ€™s closing argument must, of course,\r\n  be based on this principle.â€™\"Â  Id.Â  \"A Golden Rule argument asking the\r\n  jurors to place themselves in the victimâ€™s shoes tends to completely destroy\r\n  all sense of impartiality of the jurors, and its effect is to arouse passion\r\n  and prejudice.\"Â  State v. Reese, 370 S.C. 31, 38, 633 S.E.2d 898, 901\r\n  (2006).Â  \r\n\"On appeal, the\r\n  appellate court will view the alleged impropriety of the solicitorâ€™s argument in the context of the entire record, including whether the\r\n  trial judgeâ€™s instructions adequately cured the improper argument and whether\r\n  there is overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt.\" Â Simmons v. State,\r\n  331 S.C. 333, 338, 503 S.E.2d 164, 166 (1998). Â \"Improper comments do not\r\n  automatically require reversal if they are not prejudicial to the defendant,\r\n  and the appellant has the burden of proving he did not receive a fair trial\r\n  because of the alleged improper argument.\" Â Humphries v. State, 351 S.C.\r\n  362, 373, 570 S.E.2d 160, 166 (2002).Â  \"The relevant question is whether the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s comments so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the\r\n  resulting conviction a denial of due process.\" Id.; see State\r\n    v. Hornsby, 326 S.C. 121, 129, 484 S.E.2d 869, 873 (1997) (\"A denial of due\r\n  process occurs when a defendant in a criminal trial is denied the fundamental\r\n  fairness essential to the concept of justice.\").\r\nTurning to the\r\n  facts of the instant case, we find the PCR judge correctly concluded the solicitorâ€™s\r\n  remarks were improper in that they amounted to an impermissible \"Golden Rule\"\r\n  type argument.Â  See State v. Reese, 359 S.C. 260, 271, 597\r\n  S.E.2d 169, 175 (Ct. App.Â  2004) (recognizing that a \"Golden Rule\" argument\r\n  which suggests to jurors to put themselves in the shoes of one of the parties\r\n  is generally impermissible because it encourages the jurors to depart from\r\n  neutrality and to decide the case on the basis of personal interest and bias\r\n  rather than evidence), affâ€™d in part and revâ€™d in part, 370 S.C. 31, 633\r\n  S.E.2d 898 (2006) (affirming the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that the defendant\r\n  was entitled to a new trial based on the solicitorâ€™s \"Golden Rule\" closing\r\n  argument in which he repeatedly asked jurors to \"speak\" for the murdered\r\n  victim). \r\nHere, it is\r\n  indisputable that the case was \"emotionally charged\" given it involved sexual\r\n  misconduct with a three-year-old child.Â  Thus, the solicitorâ€™s remarks\r\n  imploring the jurors to \"speak for\" the victim undeniably asked the jurors to\r\n  set aside their impartiality and, instead, consider the evidence from the\r\n  subjective position of the child victim.Â  \r\nIn view of this\r\n  improper argument, we agree with the PCR judge that it was incumbent upon\r\n  Brownâ€™s trial counsel to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing remarks.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  although we do not believe trial counsel was disingenuous in articulating a\r\n  trial strategy to explain his failure to object to these comments, we find this\r\n  \"strategy\" cannot be construed as a valid one given the evident impropriety of\r\n  the solicitorâ€™s remarks.Â  Cf. Stokes v. State, 308 S.C. 546, 548,\r\n  419 S.E.2d 778, 779 (1992) (\"Where . . . counsel articulates a valid reason for\r\n  employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed ineffective\r\n  assistance of counsel.\"); Whitehead v. State, 308 S.C. 119, 122, 417\r\n  S.E.2d 529, 531 (1992) (recognizing that \"[c]ourts must be wary of\r\n  second-guessing counselâ€™s trial tactics; and where counsel articulates a valid\r\n  reason for employing certain strategy, such conduct will not be deemed\r\n  ineffective assistance of counsel\").\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold trial counsel was deficient in failing to object to the\r\n  challenged portion of the solicitorâ€™s closing argument because it constituted a\r\n  \"Golden Rule\" argument which impermissibly appealed to the passion of the\r\n  jurors by asking them to \"speak up\" for the child victim.Â  However, we find\r\n  Brown did not satisfy his requisite burden of proving that there was a\r\n  reasonable probability that but for counselâ€™s deficient performance the result\r\n  of his trial would have been different.\r\nFirst, the\r\n  solicitorâ€™s comments came at the very end of his closing argument and were\r\n  limited in duration.Â  Thus, we find the solicitorâ€™s comments did not so infect\r\n  the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due\r\n  process.Â  See Smith v. State, 375 S.C. 507, 654 S.E.2d 523 (2007)\r\n  (concluding any impropriety in the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was not\r\n  sufficient to grant defendant post-conviction relief where solicitorâ€™s improper\r\n  use of the pronoun \"I\" was limited, did not recur throughout his argument,\r\n  there was overwhelming evidence of the defendantâ€™s guilt, and the trial judge\r\n  instructed the jury not to consider counselâ€™s statements as evidence); see\r\n    also Von Dohlen, 360 S.C. at 613-14,Â  602 S.E.2d at 746 (holding\r\n  trial counsel, during the penalty phase of a capital case, was deficient in\r\n  failing to object to solicitorâ€™s comment for the jurors to put themselves in\r\n  the victimâ€™s shoes, but finding such deficient performance was not prejudicial); cf. State v. McDaniel, 320 S.C. 33, 462 S.E.2d 882 (Ct. App. 1995) (finding solicitorâ€™s use of \"you\" forty-five times during closing argument\r\n  asking the jurors to put themselves in the place of the victim constituted\r\n  reversible error and warranted a new trial).\r\nSecondly, there was\r\n  overwhelming evidence of Brownâ€™s guilt.Â  The State presented four eyewitnesses\r\n  who testified to seeing Brown commit the sexual misconduct against the child.Â \r\n  Each of the witnesses testified they could see into the childâ€™s bedroom window\r\n  because the blinds were wide open, it was dark outside, and there was a light\r\n  on in the bedroom.Â  They further explained that they were able to see more\r\n  clearly when they approached the window to confront Brown by banging on the\r\n  bedroom window.Â  Additionally, each witness testified that when Brown opened\r\n  the door, he had an erection.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  Brownâ€™s defense counsel attempted to establish that the witnessesâ€™ testimony\r\n  differed from their written statements regarding certain details, the witnesses\r\n  were adamant that they could clearly see through the childâ€™s bedroom window.Â \r\n  They also explained that they wrote their statements for the police immediately\r\n  after witnessing the incident while sitting in the dark on top of the police\r\n  cars.Â  \r\nThe State also\r\n  presented the two audio-taped statements given by Brown in which he admitted to\r\n  \"accidental\" or \"possible\" penetration of the child.Â  Brownâ€™s ex-wife also\r\n  testified that when she spoke with Brown at the police station he admitted that\r\n  he had been playing with the child and said, \"my penis may have fallen out of\r\n  my boxers; and I may have gotten erected; and her panties may have gone to the\r\n  side.\" \r\nAdditionally, the\r\n  Stateâ€™s expert witness testified that the child exhibited physical and\r\n  psychological symptoms which were indicative of sexual abuse.Â  This expert\r\n  witness also confirmed that the child had been diagnosed with gonorrhea.Â \r\n  Although the defense presented evidence that Brown may not have been contagious\r\n  on the day of the incident, there was testimony that prior to the incident he\r\n  was diagnosed with gonorrhea and had access to the child alone during the day.\r\nFinally, the jury\r\n  only deliberated for thirty-eight minutes before finding Brown guilty of both\r\n  charges.Â  Notably, the trial judge also recognized that the evidence of guilt\r\n  was overwhelming when he stated during sentencing: \r\n\r\n\tI want to say to you also that the evidence in this\r\n  case, sir, was overwhelming, including four eyewitnesses, which is very unusual\r\n  for a crime which generally occurs in secret; your obvious and your unnatural\r\n  state of arousal when you went to the door or when you were confronted about\r\n  this; the transmission of gonorrhea to a child victim; and your own admissions\r\n  that are contained in your own statements, sir.Â  All of these are overwhelming\r\n  evidence in the view of this court.\r\n\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we hold that any impropriety in the solicitorâ€™s closing argument was\r\n  not sufficient to warrant the PCR judgeâ€™s decision to grant a new trial.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAlthough\r\n  we find the PCR judge correctly determined that trial counsel was deficient in\r\n  failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s \"Golden Rule\" closing argument, we hold\r\n  Brown failed to prove that there was a reasonable probability that but for this\r\n  error the result of his trial would have been different.Â  Accordingly, the\r\n  decision of the PCR judge is\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26693","title":"In the Matter of Lexington County Magistrate Jamie Thomas Lucas","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26693","description":"In this opinion the Court issued a public reprimand for misconduct committed by former Lexington County Magistrate Jamie Lucas.","date":"2009-07-27","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter\r\n      of Lexington County Magistrate Jamie Thomas Lucas, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26693\r\nSubmitted July 22, 2009 - Filed July 27,\r\n  2009\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.

Steedley Bogan, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â \r\n  In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant\r\n  to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits\r\n  misconduct and consents to a public reprimand.Â  Respondent has also resigned\r\n  his position and has agreed never to seek nor accept a judicial office in South Carolina without the express written permission of this Court after written notice to\r\n  ODC.Â  We accept the agreement and publicly reprimand respondent, the most\r\n  severe sanction we are able to impose under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nFacts\r\nOn January 30, 2008, respondent was arrested and charged with\r\n  petit larceny.Â  The charge stemmed from the removal of a statue from the yard\r\n  of a member of his wifeâ€™s family.Â  The charge was nolle prossed on July 17,\r\n  2008.Â  In the Agreement for Discipline by Consent, respondent does not admit\r\n  any criminal wrongdoing, but acknowledges that as a sitting judge he should not\r\n  have involved himself in his wifeâ€™s family matter because it could call into\r\n  question the integrity of the judiciary.\r\nOn February 6, 2008, an order was issued placing respondent on\r\n  interim suspension as a result of the criminal charge.Â  On November 6, 2008,\r\n  this Court found respondent in criminal contempt for violating the terms of the\r\n  order.Â  The finding of contempt was based on telephone calls made by respondent\r\n  to his former magisterial employees in an effort to obtain a continuance in a\r\n  case pending before the magistrateâ€™s court to which he was not a party.\r\nLaw\r\nBy his conduct, respondent has violated the following provisions\r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR: Canon 1 (a judge shall\r\n  observe high standards of conduct so that the integrity and independence of the\r\n  judiciary is preserved); Canon 1(A) (a judge should participate in establishing,\r\n    maintaining and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally\r\n    observe those standards so that the integrity and independence of the judiciary\r\n    will be preserved); Canon 2 (a judge shall avoid impropriety and the appearance\r\n    of impropriety in all of the judgeâ€™s activities); Canon 2(A)(a judge shall avoid impropriety\r\n  and the appearance of impropriety by acting at all times in a manner that\r\n  promotes public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary); and Canon 2B (a judge shall not allow family,\r\n    social, political or other relationships to influence the judgeâ€™s judicial\r\n    conduct or judgment and shall not lend the prestige of judicial office to\r\n    advance the private interests of the judge or others).Â  Respondent has also violated the\r\n  following provisions of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule\r\n  502, SCACR: Rule 7(a)(1)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to\r\n  violate the Code of Judicial Conduct); Rule 7(a)(2)(it shall be a ground for\r\n  discipline for a judge to willfully violate a valid order of the\r\n  Supreme Court); Rule 7(a)(7)(it shall be a ground for discipline for a judge to\r\n  willfully violate a valid court order issued by a court of this state or\r\n  another jurisdiction); and Rule 7(a)(9)(it shall be a ground for\r\n  discipline for a judge to violate the Judgeâ€™s Oath of Office\r\n  contained in Rule 502.1, SCACR).\r\nConclusion\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a\r\n  public reprimand because respondent is no longer a magistrate and because he\r\n  has agreed not to hereafter seek nor accept another judicial position in South\r\n  Carolina without first obtaining permission from this Court after due notice in\r\n  writing to ODC.Â  As previously noted, this is the strongest punishment we can\r\n  give respondent, given the fact that he has already resigned his duties as a\r\n  magistrate.Â  See In re Gravely, 321 S.C. 235, 467 S.E.2d 924\r\n  (1996)(\"A public reprimand is the most severe sanction that can be imposed when\r\n  the respondent no longer holds judicial office.\")Â  Accordingly, respondent is\r\n  hereby publicly reprimanded for his conduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26694","title":"Law Firm of Erickson v.

Boykin,\r\n  375 S.C. 204, 651 S.E.2d 606 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nSouth Carolina has\r\n  adopted a modified version of the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign Judgments Act,\r\n  codified at S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-35-900 through -960 (2005 and Supp. 2008).Â \r\n  Pursuant to Â§ 15-35-920(A), petitioner filed a properly authenticated North Carolina judgment along with the requisite affidavit with the Horry County Clerk of\r\n  Court.Â  Petitioner then served the notice required by Â§ 15-35-930(A) on\r\n  respondents.\r\nRespondents filed a\r\n  \"Motion for Relief from Enforcement of Foreign Judgment\" pursuant to Â§\r\n  15-35-940(A), alleging the North Carolina court lacked personal jurisdiction\r\n  over respondents.Â  At a hearing in circuit court respondents presented no\r\n  evidence, but relied on their attorneyâ€™s argument that their contacts with North Carolina were insufficient to support personal jurisdiction.Â  \r\nThe circuit court\r\n  upheld respondentsâ€™ challenge to petitionerâ€™s North Carolina default judgment.Â \r\n  \"It is well-settled that the party seeking to invoke personal jurisdiction over\r\n  a non-resident defendant bears the burden \"of proving personal jurisdictionâ€¦.\"Â \r\n  Next, the judge noted that while petitioner had offered a copy of the partiesâ€™\r\n  fee agreement into evidence at the hearing to show personal jurisdiction, he\r\n  declined to admit it.Â  Even if it had been admitted, the judge would have held\r\n  \"the choice of law or venue clause\" was insufficient to confer jurisdiction.Â \r\n  Finally, holding that whether the minimum contacts standard has been met is a\r\n  fact-specific inquiry, the circuit judge held petitioner failed to offer any\r\n  evidence.[2]Â  \r\nPetitioner filed a\r\n  timely motion for reconsideration, arguing essentially that the burden of\r\n  rebutting the presumption of the regularity accorded the North Carolina\r\n  judgment fell on the respondents, and that they had failed to meet this burden\r\n  since they produced no evidence at the hearing.Â  After the motion was denied,\r\n  petitioner appealed to the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n\tPetitioner raised\r\n  three issues on appeal:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\t\tThat the circuit court failed to\r\n  accord the proper presumption of correctness due the North Carolina judgment\r\n  and that respondents did not meet their burden of proof to show the judgment\r\n  was invalid;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t2) \r\n\t\t\t\tThat the circuit court erred in\r\n  signing and filing an order prepared by respondentsâ€™ counsel which contained\r\n  numerous unsupported facts; and \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t3) \r\n\t\t\t\tThat the circuit court erred in failing to take \r\n\t\t\t\tnotice of facts and documents petitioner submitted after the \r\n\t\t\t\thearing.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Court of Appeals upheld\r\n  the circuit court against all challenges.Â  Law Firm, supra.Â  We\r\n  granted certiorari to review only the first issue, whether respondents had the\r\n  burden to rebut the judgmentâ€™s validity. \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the burden of proof to show that North Carolina had personal jurisdiction over\r\n  respondents rested on petitioner?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals acknowledged, as it must, that under the Full Faith and Credit\r\n  Clause,[3] personal jurisdiction is presumed when a foreign judgment appears on its face\r\n  to be a record of a court of general jurisdiction.Â  Law Firm, supra,\r\n  citing Taylor v. Taylor, 229 S.C. 92, 91 S.E.2d 876 (1956).Â  The Court\r\n  of Appeals held, however, that Â§ 15-35-940 \"was enacted by the Legislature to\r\n  extend greater protection to South Carolina citizens in the enforcement of\r\n  foreign judgments and impacts the earlier presumption of validity laid out in\r\n  South Carolina case law.\"Â  The presumption arises not from state case law,\r\n  however, but rather from the United States Constitution.Â  E.g., Adam\r\n    v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59 (1938).Â  To read the statute in this way arguably\r\n  violates the Supremacy Clause[4] and/or the Privileges and Immunities Clause[5] of the United States Constitution.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals construed Â§ 15-35-940 to shift the burden of proving the\r\n  foreign judgmentâ€™s regularity to the creditor when the debtor challenges the\r\n  judgment in South Carolina court proceedings.Â  Section 15-35-940 provides:\r\n\r\n\tMotion\r\n  for relief from, or notice of defense to, foreign judgment; grounds; motion for\r\n  enforcement; Rules of Civil Procedure applicable; burden of proving judgment\r\n  entitled to full faith and credit.\r\n\t(A)Â \r\n  The judgment debtor may file a motion for relief from, or notice of defense to,\r\n  the foreign judgment on the grounds that the foreign judgment has been appealed\r\n  from, that enforcement has been stayed by the court which rendered it, or on\r\n  any other ground for which relief from a judgment of this State is allowed.\r\n\t(B)Â  If\r\n  the judgment debtor has filed a motion for relief or notice of defenses, then\r\n  the judgment creditor may move for enforcement or security of the foreign\r\n  judgment as a judgment of this State, if all appeals of the foreign judgment\r\n  are finally concluded and the judgment is not further contested.Â  The judgment\r\n  creditorâ€™s motion must be heard before a judge who has jurisdiction of the\r\n  matter based upon the amount in controversy as the amount remaining unpaid on\r\n  the foreign judgment.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  The\r\n  judgment creditor has the burden of proving that the foreign judgment is\r\n  entitled to full faith and credit.[6]\r\n\r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals held that the presumption of the foreign judgmentâ€™s regularity \"ends\r\n  when the judgment debtor files a motion for relief or notice of defense under Â§\r\n  15-35-940(A).\"Â  Law Firm, supra.Â Â  In making this assertion, the\r\n  Court of Appeals relied on its decision in The Jay Group, Ltd. v. The\r\n    Bootery of Haywood Mall, Inc., 335 S.C. 114, 515 S.E.2d 542 (Ct. App. 1999).Â  The Law Firm majority also cited Jay Group for the\r\n  proposition that when, as here, a judgment debtor challenges a foreign judgment\r\n  for lack of personal jurisdiction, the presumption evaporates and the burden\r\n  shifts to the creditor to show the foreign judgment is entitled to Full Faith\r\n  and Credit.Â  Finally, the majority overruled its decision in Sec. Credit\r\n    Leasing, Inc. v. Armaly, 339 S.C. 533, 529 S.E.2d 283 (Ct. App. 2000) to\r\n  the extent it is inconsistent with these holdings.Â  We hold Armaly was\r\n  correctly decided while Jay Group was not, and as explained below, we\r\n  now overrule Jay Group.\r\nIn Armaly,\r\n  the creditor filed an action to enforce its Florida default judgment against\r\n  the South Carolina debtor.Â  The debtor then moved to dismiss the action,\r\n  alleging Florida lacked personal jurisdiction over him.Â  The Armaly court held, citing Taylor, supra, which itself quoted from Cook\r\n    v. Cook, 342 U.S. 126 (1951), that the debtor challenging a foreign judgment\r\n  on the ground of lack of personal jurisdiction assumes the burden of\r\n  overcoming, by the record or by extrinsic evidence, the constitutionally\r\n  mandated presumption of the foreign judgmentâ€™s regularity.Â  \r\nIn Jay Group,\r\n  however, the Court of Appeals relied upon Â§ 15-35-940(B) to reverse a circuit\r\n  court order according a North Carolina default judgment Full Faith and Credit.Â \r\n  The court cited the statute for the proposition that the creditor bears the\r\n  burden of proving the judgment is entitled to Full Faith and Credit, analyzed\r\n  the evidence of personal jurisdiction under North Carolina law, and found it\r\n  wanting.Â  Jay Group refers only to Â§ 15-35-940(B), and not to any cases\r\n  or constitutional principles.[7]Â  \r\nThe majority in\r\n  this case relied solely on the statute and the Jay Group decision, to\r\n  affirm the circuit court.Â  The dissenters avoided the constitutional\r\n  implications of the majorityâ€™s decision and would have read the statute to\r\n  provide that only where debtor moves for relief from the judgment, and the creditor\r\n  then moves to enforce it, is the presumption of regularity removed, and the\r\n  burden shifted to the creditor.Â  See Law Firm, supra fn.\r\n  21.Â  The dissenters would have upheld Armaly and overruled Jay Group.Â  Id.\r\n\"[T]he burden of\r\n  undermining the decree of a sister state â€˜rests heavily on the assailantâ€™â€¦[who\r\n  can overcome the presumption of jurisdiction and validity afforded the judgment\r\n  by the Full Faith and Credit Clause only] by extrinsic evidence, or by the\r\n  record itself.\"Â  Cook v. Cook, 342 U.S. at 128.Â  We reverse the Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ holding that Â§ 15-35-940 shifts the burden of proving personal\r\n  jurisdiction if the debtor files a motion for relief or notice of defense and\r\n  overrule Jay Group. \r\nThe\r\n  question then becomes whether Â§ 15-35-940 is capable of being read so as not to\r\n  offend the U.S. Constitution.Â  As explained below, we find only the last\r\n  sentence of Â§ 15-35-940 (B) is offensive and sever it from the statute.Â  E.g., Sojourner v. Town of St. George, Op. No. 26680 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed June 29, 2009) (court can sever unconstitutional portion of a statute under\r\n  certain circumstances).\r\nSubsection (A) of Â§\r\n  15-35-940 permits the debtor to file a motion for relief from judgment or a\r\n  notice of defense to the foreign judgment.Â  Once a foreign judgment is properly\r\n  enrolled pursuant to Â§ 15-35-920 it \"has the same effect and is subject to the\r\n  same defenses as a judgment of this State and must be enforced or satisfied in\r\n  like mannerâ€¦.\"Â  Â§15-35-920(C).Â  In our view, a \"Motion for Relief\" refers to a\r\n  Rule 60, SCRCP, motion brought by the debtor, while a \"notice of defense\" would\r\n  be filed in a creditorâ€™s enforcement action, and raise either defenses found in\r\n  Rule 12 (b), SCRCP, or those found specifically in Â§15-35-940 (A), i.e., that\r\n  the judgment is under appeal in the rendering jurisdiction or that jurisdiction\r\n  has stayed the judgment.Â  Read this way, subsection (A) simply establishes\r\n  procedures by which a debtor can raise an objection to a foreign judgment.\r\nThe more difficult\r\n  questions arise from the language of section (B), which provides:\r\n\r\n\t(B)Â \r\n  If the judgment debtor has filed a motion for relief or notice of defenses,\r\n  then the judgment creditor may move for enforcement or security of the foreign\r\n  judgment as a judgment of this State, if all appeals of the foreign judgment\r\n  are finally concluded and the judgment is not further contested.Â  The judgment\r\n  creditorâ€™s motion must be heard before a judge who has jurisdiction of the\r\n  matter based upon the amount in controversy as the amount remaining unpaid on the\r\n  foreign judgment.Â  The South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure apply.Â  The\r\n  judgment creditor has the burden of proving that the foreign judgment is\r\n  entitled to full faith and credit.\r\n\r\nThe first three sentences,\r\n  like section (A), merely set forth procedures, and echo the more specific\r\n  information found in Â§ 15-35-920(C).Â  The last sentence, however, unequivocally\r\n  places the burden of proving the judgmentâ€™s entitlement to Full Faith and\r\n  Credit on the creditor.Â  Such a requirement violates the federal constitution, e.g. Cook v. Cook, supra, and accordingly we strike this sentence from\r\n  Â§ 15-35-940(B).Â  We find that this sentence can be severed, leaving the statute\r\n  \"complete in itself, wholly independent of that which is rejected, and [the\r\n  remainder] is of such a character that it may fairly be presumed that the\r\n  legislature would have passed it independent of that which conflicts with the\r\n  constitution.\"Â  Sojourner v. Town of St. George, supra, citing Joytime Distribs. &amp; Amusement Co., Inc. v. State, 338 S.C. 634, 648,\r\n  528 S.E.2d 647, 654 (1999).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals, hold that the last sentence of Â§ 15-35-940(B)\r\n  violates the federal constitution but is severable from the rest of the\r\n  statute, and overrule The Jay Group, Ltd. v. The Bootery of Haywood Mall,\r\n    Inc., supra, to the extent it conflicts with our decision today.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, J., and Acting Justices Timothy M. Cain and R.
