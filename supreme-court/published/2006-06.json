McIntosh, and Assistant Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, all of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\nDeputy Chief Attorney Wanda H. Carter, Office of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This Court granted certiorari to review the Post Conviction Relief (PCR) Judgeâ€™s decision to grant relief to Silas Smith (Respondent).Â  We reverse.\r\nFactual / Procedural Background\r\nRespondent pled guilty to felony DUI.Â  The trial court sentenced Respondent to twelve years imprisonment.Â  Because of the nature of the offense, Respondent had to serve eighty-five percent of the sentence without the possibility of parole.\r\nRespondent filed this action for PCR claiming that but for the erroneous advice of trial counsel, he would not have pled guilty.Â  Respondent maintains that trial counsel informed him that by pleading guilty to the charge, Respondent would be sentenced to twelve years but only have to serve half of that sentence because he would be eligible for parole in six years.Â  At the PCR hearing, Respondent testified that trial counsel informed him that he would receive credit for time served prior to the guilty plea.Â  Although Respondent stated in his PCR application that but for counselâ€™s advice, he would not have pled guilty, Respondent made no such statement at his PCR hearing.Â  Instead, as a matter of strategy, Respondent declined to testify whether he would choose not to plead guilty and face another trial in light of the plea bargain he received.\r\nThe PCR court found that because the only evidence before the court was Respondentâ€™s undisputed testimony and the averment in the PCR application, Respondent was entitled to relief.Â  The State sought certiorari from this Court.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the decision of the PCR court.Â  The following issue is before this Court:\r\nDid the PCR court err in granting relief to Respondent?\r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in granting relief to Respondent.Â  We agree.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn reviewing the PCR courtâ€™s decision, this Court is concerned only with whether there is any evidence of probative value to support that decision.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989). \r\nIn the context of a guilty plea, the court must determine whether 1) counselâ€™s advice was within the range of competence demanded of attorneys in criminal cases - i.e. was counselâ€™s performance deficient, and 2) if there is a reasonable probability that, but for counselâ€™s errors, the defendant would not have pled guilty.Â  Hill v. Lockhart, 474 U.S. 52, 56-58 (1985).Â  The defendantâ€™s undisputed testimony that he would not have pled guilty to the charges but for trial counselâ€™s advice is sufficient to prove that defendant would not have pled guilty.Â  Jackson v. State, 342 S.C. 95, 97-98, 535 S.E.2d 926, 927 (2000); Alexander v. State, 303 S.C. 539, 543, 402 S.E.2d 484, 485-86 (1991).\r\nDuring his testimony at the PCR hearing, Respondent did not indicate whether he would have pled guilty absent counselâ€™s erroneous advice.Â  However, Respondent did make such a claim in his PCR application.Â  The State did not offer any evidence to the contrary, and the State failed to provide the testimony of trial counsel at the PCR hearing.Â  Further, the PCR court did not have an opportunity to review the plea transcript because neither party presented it to the court.Â  Accordingly, the only evidence before the PCR court was Respondentâ€™s sworn statement in his PCR application that if he knew that he would have to serve eighty-five percent of the sentence he would not have pled guilty.\r\nThis Court, in Jackson and Alexander, held that the undisputed testimony of a PCR applicant is sufficient to warrant relief.Â  In Jackson and Alexander, the PCR applicants testified at the PCR hearing that they would not have pled guilty absent the errors made by trial counsel.Â  We find that the present scenario is distinguishable from Jackson and Alexander.Â  In the present case, Respondent did not testify at the PCR hearing that he would have not pled guilty absent trial counselâ€™s erroneous advice.Â  As a result, we hold that the averment in a PCR application that the applicant would not have pled guilty is insufficient to warrant relief.Â  Respondentâ€™s failure to take the stand resulted in a failure of proof - i.e. the allegation in the complaint that he would not have pled guilty was not proven because of Respondentâ€™s reluctance to testify to that assertion.Â  An applicant seeking relief from a guilty plea must present probative evidence to support the allegations in the PCR application that but for trial counselâ€™s erroneous advice, the applicant would not have pled guilty.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the above, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s decision.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Layman v.

Looney and   Nancy Ahrens, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,   Petitioners,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        The State of South Carolina and The South Carolina   Retirement System,   Respondents\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nAMENDED ORDER\r\n\r\nOn May 4, 2006, this Court issued an opinion holding   that respondents breached their contract with TERI participants who joined the   TERI program, originally enacted in 2001, prior to July 1, 2005 (old TERI   participants), by forcing them to make retirement system contributions. Layman v. State of South Carolina, Op. No. 26146 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed May   4, 2006). We further ordered that all retirement system contributions withheld   from those TERI participants be returned to them with interest and that no   further contributions from them shall be required. Id. Finally, we   remanded the issue of breach of contract as it relates to working retirees to   the trial court because the record before us does not allow us to make the   factual or legal inquiry necessary to determine if a binding contract existed   between the State and the working retirees regarding the making of further   retirement system contributions. Id. \r\n \r\nThe parties have now filed several motions. We will   address respondents&rsquo; petition for rehearing first. We deny the petition with   regard to Arguments I and II. \r\n \r\nWe also deny the petition as to Argument III, but   will analyze the arguments made therein. Respondents contend this Court impugned   the integrity of counsel by labeling as a complete misrepresentation the   assertion that the growing number of TERI participants was part of the reason   for requiring contributions from previously enrolled TERI participants. At page   26 of their brief respondents state, &ldquo;Act 153 was adopted in the face of   increasing liabilities in the Retirement System.&rdquo; The sentence is accompanied by   a reference to pages 754 and 755 of the record. Those pages in the record   contain a portion of the Milliman study describing the increase in the number of   participants corresponding to the increase in the liabilities of the retirement   system. The numbers are reflected in chart form, depicting the liabilities   increasing significantly, almost off the charts. We did not intend to impugn the   character of counsel, but we did find fault in the analysis used with respect to   the entire Milliman report. Respondent&rsquo;s reliance on the report was inaccurate   because by the time respondents prepared the briefs for presentation before this   Court, we had previously certified the plaintiff class to include only those   retirees enrolled prior to July 1, 2005. The Milliman report included both   current and future TERI participants.\r\n \r\nFurther, this Court pointed to flawed analysis by   stating that 100 percent of eligible retirees were used in arriving at the   figures in the report. This sentence, when taken out of context, is incorrect.   To clarify, the Milliman report did assume that only 80 percent of all eligible   retirees (as opposed to 100 percent of eligible retirees) would participate in   TERI. 1 \r\n \r\nIn Arguments IVA and IVB, respondents maintain the   Court should amend the class definition to exclude working retirees or, in the   alternative, decertify the entire class. Respondents state that class treatment   is not necessary because &ldquo;if the Court lets its decision stand, respondents will   comply with the law as declared and provide appropriate relief to all persons   entitled to it.&rdquo; Respondents also point out that if the class is not   decertified, class notice will be required.2 We   are persuaded by this argument. Accordingly, we grant respondents&rsquo; request to   decertify the classes in this matter. Thus, petitioners&rsquo; Motion for Approval of   Notice to Class is denied as moot.\r\nIn Argument IVC, respondents maintain the Court   failed to prescribe the procedures for making refunds pursuant to the opinion,   specifically, how or when such refunds will be made.3 Respondents state, &ldquo;This is one of the reasons that the   class definition must be amended to prevent confusion regarding who is entitled   to relief, should the Court maintain the same result in this case.&rdquo; Finally,   respondents maintain, as they have in the past, that there is a delay in   collecting the contributions and in allocating them to specific persons who are   members of the class.\r\nWe find there should be no confusion as to who is   entitled to relief in this matter &ndash; all TERI participants who joined the TERI   program, originally enacted in 2001, prior to July 1, 2005, from whom retirement   system contributions have been collected since the effective date of Act 153. As   to when such refunds are to be made, we hereby order that all retirement system   contributions withheld from the old TERI participants shall be returned to them,   with interest at the rate of 4%, within thirty (30) days of the date of this   order. Specifically how this refund will be effectuated is to be decided by   respondents, not this Court. The post judgment interest on the amounts to be   returned shall begin to accrue at the rate of 11.25%, set forth by order of this   Court dated January 4, 2006, for post-judgment interest, if not returned within   this thirty (30) day period.\r\nIn Argument IVD, respondents maintain the Court must   clarify its ruling as to the working retirees and provide for appropriate   procedures on remand to deal with whatever claims are permitted. Our opinion   orders that the issue of breach of contract as it relates to the working   retirees is remanded to the trial court. Because we have now decertified the   class, only petitioner Ahrens&rsquo; case is remanded to the circuit court,   specifically, to the Honorable John L. Breeden. Judge Breeden shall have full   authority to decide whether to certify a class or deal with the cases   individually. Judge Breeden has the authority to fully explore the issue of   whether the working retirees entered into a binding contract and all other   issues involved in the working retiree action(s).\r\nFinally, respondents assert in Argument IVE that this   Court must prescribe procedures for determining petitioners&rsquo; request for fees   and costs. We consider petitioners&rsquo; Petition for Costs to Include S.C. Code &sect;   15-77-300 Attorney&rsquo;s Fees and Motion for Attorney&rsquo;s Fees (Common Fund Doctrine)   in conjunction with Argument IVE of respondents&rsquo; petition for rehearing. We deny   petitioners&rsquo; Motion for Attorney&rsquo;s Fees (Common Fund Doctrine), as we find   attorney&rsquo;s fees in this matter should not come from the retirement contributions   made by the old TERI participants, or the interest accumulated thereon. However,   we remand petitioners&rsquo; request for costs, to include attorneys&rsquo; fees pursuant to   section 15-77-300, to Judge Breeden to determine if petitioners are entitled to   recover reasonable attorneys&rsquo; fees to be taxed as court costs against the State   of South Carolina and the South Carolina Retirement System, and if so, the   amount of attorneys&rsquo; fees they are entitled to based on the actual amount of   work performed, expenses incurred, and the benefit obtained for all of the old   TERI participants.\r\nIT IS SO ORDERED.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      s/Jean H.

This order reflects the language as amended.]\r\n\r\n1 Respondents contend in their   Introduction, that &ldquo;[t]his case represents a dramatic departure from ordinary   procedural and substantive standards&rdquo; and that [i]t is doubtful that there is   another case in the history of South Carolina jurisprudence with such a   procedural history.&rdquo; Many cases this Court has elected to entertain in its   original jurisdiction, which by their very nature involve issues of public   interest or special emergency, see Rule 229(a), SCACR, have taken the same   efficient and expeditious path as the case at hand, and have not included an   opportunity for the parties to engage in discovery. See e.g. South Carolina   State Ports Authority v. Jasper County, Op. No. 26132 (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed April   3, 2006)(order accepting matter in Court&rsquo;s original jurisdiction filed March 2,   2005; opinion issued April 3, 2006); Sloan v. Wilkins, 362 S.C. 430, 608 S.E.2d   579 (2005)(order accepting matter in Court&rsquo;s original jurisdiction filed May 14,   2004; opinion issued January 28, 2005); Sloan v. Sanford, 357 S.C. 431, 593   S.E.2d 470 (2004)(order accepting matter in Court&rsquo;s original jurisdiction filed   May 30, 2003; opinion issued February 9, 2004). The case at hand was certified   to this Court by order dated August 4, 2005. The opinion was issued on May 4,   2006, nine months later. Accordingly, this case does not mark a dramatic   departure from procedures and time periods in other similar cases before this   Court.\r\n2 By order dated November 3, 2005,   this Court deferred the issue of class notice until after a decision was   rendered in the case.\r\n\r\n3 Respondents take issue with this Court&rsquo;s statements in its opinion that the   amounts contributed by old TERI participants have been escrowed in a separate   interest-bearing account. By order dated August 31, 2005, this Court granted   respondents&rsquo; request for the escrowed funds to be held within the Retirement   Trust Fund, but subject to separate accounting for individual contributions, and   also ordered that the escrowed funds bear interest at the current rate   established by the State Budget and Control Board pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. &sect;   9-1-280 (1986). Further, we note that the description of the interest bearing   escrow account was borrowed in large part from pages 2-3 of respondents&rsquo; brief.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26164","title":"SC Public Interest Foundation v.

Carr, 369 U.S. 186, 210-11 (1962).Â \r\nâ€œDeciding whether a matter has in any measure been committed by the Constitution to another branch of government, or whether the action of that branch exceeds whatever authority has been committed, is itself a delicate exercise in constitutional interpretation, and is a responsibility of this Court as ultimate interpreter of the Constitution.â€Â  Id. at 211; See Japan Whaling Assâ€™n v. Am. Cetacean Soc., 478 U.S. 221, 230 (1986) (stating the political question doctrine, which derives from the separation of powers doctrine, excludes from judicial review those controversies which revolve around policy choices and value determinations constitutionally committed for resolution to the halls of state legislatures or to the confines of the executive branch).\r\nThe fundamental characteristic of a nonjusticiable â€œpolitical questionâ€ is that its adjudication would place a court in conflict with a coequal branch of government.Â  U.S. v. Munoz-Flores, 495 U.S. 385, 393-94 (1990).Â  Thus, the courts will not rule upon questions which are exclusively or predominantly political in nature rather than judicial.Â  Chicago &amp; S. Air Lines v. Waterman S.S. Corp. Civil Aeronautics Brd., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948).\r\nIn addition to the authority cited above, this Court has declined to opine on issues where the Constitution delegates authority to the General Assembly.Â  See Stone v. Leatherman, 343 S.C. 484, 484-85, 541 S.E.2d 241 (2001) (holding that the South Carolina Constitution provides the Senate with the authority to judge the election returns and qualifications of its own members).Â  Likewise, other state courts have declined to answer political questions when Constitutional provisions grant the power to another branch of government.Â  See Ex. Rel. Turner v. Scott, 296 N.W.2d 828, 830-31 (Iowa 1978) (holding that the determination of whether a senator was qualified to hold office because of questions regarding residency was the prerogative of the Senate pursuant to the Iowa State Constitution).Â  \r\nIn the present case, the power to determine if a person is qualified to hold judicial office is vested with the General Assembly by the State Constitution.Â  The South Carolina Constitution requires the General Assembly to establish a commission charged with the duty of determining if a person is qualified to be elected as a judge.Â  S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 27.Â  In addition, the Constitution proscribes that the General Assembly is to establish criteria for the Commission to consider when making the determination if a judicial candidate is qualified.Â  Id;Â  See also S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-19-35 (2005) (establishing the criteria for the Commission to consider when determining if a candidate is qualified to be elected to a judicial seat); and S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 2-19-20(D) (2005) (providing that the Commission can conduct the investigation into a judicial candidateâ€™s background in any manner the Commission deems appropriate).\r\nAs the above cited statute indicates, the State Constitution, in unequivocal terms, vests the power to determine the qualifications for judicial candidates in the General Assembly.Â  Were we to review this case, this Court would be delving into the decision making process of the very body that determines whether the members of this Court are qualified to seek election to the bench.Â  We decline to put the judiciary in a position that would interfere with the selection of its very own members.Â  Accordingly, we hold that the issue of whether Mullen was properly qualified is a nonjusticiable political question.\r\nThe issue presented in the present case is distinguishable from other areas in which the Court reviews the actions of another coequal branch of government.Â  For example, the South Carolina Code specifically gives this Court the power to review the decisions of administrative agencies that are under the umbrella of the executive branch.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-2-380(A) (2005) (outlining the procedures for appealing a final decision of an administrative agency).Â  In addition, this Court can review the actions of the General Assembly when the actions are unconstitutional.Â  See Hanvey v. Oconee Mem. Hosp., 308 S.C. 1, 4, 416 S.E.2d 623, 625 (1992) (stating that the Court can overturn an act of the General Assembly when the enactment is unconstitutional).\r\nUnder the present facts, the Foundation and Herring had other avenues to seek relief.Â  Specifically, the complaining parties could properly challenge the residency of Mullen as provided for in the Code:\r\n\r\n[o]nce a person is registered, challenges of the qualifications of any elector, except for challenges issued at the polls pursuant to Â§Â§ 7-13-810, 7-13-820, and 7-15-420 must be made in writing to the board of registration in the county of registration. The board must, within ten days following the challenge and after first giving notice to the elector and the challenger, hold a hearing, accept evidence, and rule upon whether the elector meets or fails to\r\nmeet the qualifications set forth in Â§ 7-5-120.\r\nWhen a challenge is made regarding the residence of an elector, the board may consider the following proof to establish residence including, but not limited to, income tax returns; real estate interests; mailing address; address on driver's license; official papers and documents requiring the statement of residence address; automobile registration; checking and savings accounts; past voting record; membership in clubs and organizations; location of personal property; and the elector's statements as to his intent.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-5-230 (Supp. 2005).\r\nAccordingly, we hold that the issue presented in this case constitutes a political question not proper for judicial review.\r\nII.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSummary Judgment\r\nThe Foundation and Herring argue the trial court erred in granting the Commissionâ€™s motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  Because we hold that the case is not justiciable we do not reach the merits of the claims.[2]\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the authority cited above, we hold that the question of whether the Commission properly determined the residence of Mullen or gave proper weight to the concerns of the Lowcountry Screening Committee presents a nonjusticiable political question that this Court should decline to answer.Â  Accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.\r\nMOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Roger M. Young, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] In addition to the separate of powers analysis, the circuit found the issue presented in the present case to be moot.Â  In our view, the political question doctrine, as opposed to mootness dictates the decision in this case.\r\n[2] While we do not delve into the decision making process of the Judicial Merit Selection Committee, we do note that Mullen was a qualified elector from the Fourteenth Judicial Circuit at the time of her election as evidence in the Appellantsâ€™ complaint.Â  Further, the legislative history of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-5-610 (Supp. 2005) does not reflect that the word â€œfromâ€ has any other meaning outside requiring that a person seeking a seat as a resident judge in a judicial circuit be a qualified elector of that circuit on the date of his or her election.

Threlkeld, of Anderson, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE HAYES: The special referee found the duration of the restrictive covenants on the partiesâ€™ property could not be extended by amendment and expired January 14, 2005.Â  This case was certified for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and we now affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1971, J. Donald King, Sr. subdivided a tract of land adjacent to Highway 81 into ten separate parcels - referred to as Lots 1-8 and Tracts A and B.Â  On September 13, 1979, restrictive covenants applying to Lots 1-7 and Tracts A and B were recorded.[1]Â  On January 14, 1980, these restrictive covenants were re-recorded. Â Â Â \r\nAmong other things, the restrictive covenants prohibited the commercial use of the land.Â  The restrictive covenants were to â€œrun with the land and [] be binding on all parties and all persons claiming under them for a period of 25 years from the date these Covenants are recorded.â€Â  Thus, the restrictive covenants were to expire January 14, 2005. \r\nOne provision in the covenants provided for amendments to the restrictive covenants as follows: \r\n\r\n  Change of Restrictions.Â  Any change or amendment of these restrictions shall be made only by an instrument in writing signed by a majority of the heads of household owning lots in said subdivision.\r\n\r\nIn 1987, King subdivided Tract A into lots A-F and designated them as the Marcdon Place subdivision. Â On May 20, 1987, a separate set of restrictive covenants was filed for Marcdon Place.Â  Among other things, these restrictive covenants prohibited the commercial use of the land until May 20, 2012.\r\nIn the 1970s, Highway 81 was a two-lane road.Â  Later, it was enlarged to four lanes to connect downtown Anderson to I-85.Â  In recent years, there has been significant commercial development along Highway 81.Â  \r\nPart of Lot 1 and Lots 5 and 7 have houses on them, and Lots 2, 3, 4, and 6 remain undeveloped.[2]Â  Five of the Marcdon Place lots have houses on them.Â  At the hearing, the current homes were described as high end homes with an average value of $500,000.Â  The respondents, the seven owners of lots 1-6,[3] have proposed developing their property for commercial use. The defendants, the eight owners of lots A-F in Marcdon Place (previously Tract A), Tract B, and Lot 7, oppose any commercial development.  [4] Â  \r\nOn December 20, 2002, the respondents filed a document purporting to cancel the restrictive covenants.Â  The document recited the amendment provision and stated the majority of the heads of household wanted to cancel the restrictive covenants.Â  Four months later, on April 25, 2003, the defendants filed a document amending the restrictive covenants by extending the covenantsâ€™ expiration date to September 13, 2029.[5]Â Â Â  \r\nThe respondents sought a declaratory judgment stating the restrictive covenants expired September 13, 2004, and thus are now unenforceable.[6]Â  Defendant/Appellant Yvonne Jeffcoat filed a cross-claim and a counterclaim requesting a declaratory judgment stating the amendment extended the restrictive covenants until September 13, 2029.Â  \r\nThe special referee found the amendment provision in the restrictive covenants ambiguous.Â  He specifically held the amendment provision in the covenants did not expressly allow the amendment of the duration of the covenants.Â  Strictly construing the amendment provision, the special referee held the restrictive covenants expired January 14, 2005, and could not be extended by agreement of less than 100% of the owners.Â  Jeffcoat appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the special referee err in finding the restrictive covenants could not be amended?\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThe appellant contends the standard of review is de novo.Â  The respondents, however, argue the standard of review is â€œany evidence.â€Â Â  We find the proper standard of review is de novo.Â  \r\nBoth sides agree â€œ[a] suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.â€Â  Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).Â  The respondents contend this actionâ€™s underlying issue is an action to construe a contract. Â However, the appellant argues the underlying issue is one to enforce restrictive covenants which is in equity.Â  \r\nâ€œThe determination of the existence of an easement is a question of fact in a law action and subject to an any evidence standard of review when tried by a judge without a jury.â€ Â Slear v. Hanna, 329 S.C. 407, 410, 496 S.E.2d 633, 635 (1998). Â However, the determination of the scope of the easement is a question in equity. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 323, 487 S.E.2d 187, 190 (1997).Â  While this action potentially may require the Court to construe a contract, the underlying action is a declaratory action to declare whether theÂ  restrictive covenants are enforceable after January 14, 2005. Â Accordingly, we hold the proper scope of review is de novo.Â  \r\nDiscussion \r\nThe special referee held the general amendment provision is ambiguous as to whether it includes the power to amend the duration of the restrictive covenants. Â He then strictly construed the amendment provision in favor of free use of the property and held the duration could not be extended. Â The appellant contends the special referee erred in finding the provision ambiguous and in holding it includes the amending of the duration of the restrictive covenants. Â We disagree.\r\nA restrictive covenant is ambiguous when its terms are reasonably susceptible of more than one interpretation. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources v. Town of McClellanville, 345 S.C. 617, 550 S.E.2d 299 (2001).Â  On one hand, the amendment provision states â€œany change or amendmentâ€ can be made.Â  (Emphasis added).Â  On the other hand, the restrictive covenants clearly state they expire in twenty-five years and there is no express provision allowing for an amendment to extend the duration of the restrictive covenants. We find the amendment provision ambiguous as to whether â€œany change or amendmentâ€ includes an extension of the duration of the restrictive covenants.[7]\r\nThe appellant then contends if the provision is deemed ambiguous, it should be interpreted to allow an amendment of the duration of the restrictive covenants.Â  WeÂ  disagree. \r\nâ€œ[A] restriction on the use of the property must be created in express terms or by plain and unmistakable implication, and all such restrictions are to be strictly construed, with all doubts resolved in favor of the free use of property.â€ Â See Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 157, 263 S.E.2d 378, 380 (1980). Â The Court is to construe any ambiguity in favor of limited duration and against restricting property. Restrictions on the use of property will be strictly construed with all doubts resolved in favor of free use of the property, although the rule of strict construction should not be used to defeat the plain and obvious purpose of the restrictive covenants. Â Taylor v. Lindsey, 332 S.C. 1, 4, 498 S.E.2d 862, 863 (1998). Restrictive covenants are contractual in nature. Â Hoffman v. Cohen, 262 S.C. 71, 75, 202 S.E.2d 363, 365 (1974). The language of a restrictive covenant is to be construed according to the plain and ordinary meaning attributed to it at the time of execution. Â Taylor, 32 S.C. at 4, 498 S.E.2d at 864.\r\nHere, the restrictive covenants had a clear expiration date, and there was no express provision for their extension. Further, strictly construing the general amendment provision and resolving any doubts in favor of the free use of the property, we hold the amendment provision does not allow extending the duration of the restrictive covenants.Â  Accordingly, the purported amendment is invalid and the restrictive covenants expired January 14, 2005.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm the special refereeâ€™s order. \r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]For some undisclosed reason, Lot 8 was not subjected to these restrictive covenants.Â  \r\n[2]Lot 1 was subdivided into two lots in 1986.Â Â Â  \r\n[3]There were seven owners because Lot 1 was subdivided into two lots.Â Â Â  \r\n[4]We note not all of the defendants are participating in this appeal. \r\n[5]Of the defendants, only Yvonne Jeffcoat appeals.\r\n[6]Plaintiffs Lawrence and Patricia Kukulski originally were the only plaintiffs.Â  The special referee realigned the parties.Â  Afterwards, in addition to the Kukulskis, the plaintiffs included Dale Hardy and Grace Stegall.Â  The defendants were Millicent and William Aiken, Virginia Baillie, Mary and Richard Ballenger, Nancy Hearn, Rozlyn and William Hood, Yvonne Jeffcoat, Deanne and Joseph Camak, Rajeev Malik, Mary Alice Terry, and Ellen Ware.Â  \r\n[7]We note that amendment provisions similar to the one here have been interpreted differently in different jurisdictions.Â  See, e.g., Allen v. Sea Gate Assâ€™n, 460 S.E.2d 197 (N.C. Ct. App. 1995)(holding the duration of restrictive covenants cannot be extended, unless the restrictive covenants clearly authorize it); and Venetian Isles Homeowners Assâ€™n, Inc., v. Albrecht, 823 So.2d 813 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2002)(holding the general power to modify restrictive covenants includes the power to extend the duration).Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26148","title":"Edwards v.

John, Circuit Court Judge\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26148\r\nHeard March 21, 2006 - Refiled June 12, 2006Â  \r\n\r\nDISMISSED\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        NataleÂ  Fata, of Surfside Beach, for Appellant.\r\n        Charles S. Altman, of Charleston, and Michael D. Hays, of Washington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  This is an appeal from an order of the circuit court granting SunComâ€™s motion to stay the action.Â  The circuit court simultaneously ordered SunCom to seek a ruling from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) as to whether an â€œearly termination feeâ€ constituted a â€œrate charged.â€[1]Â  Edwards appeals. Â We dismiss the appeal as interlocutory. \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 2000, Edwards signed a service agreement to become a SunCom cellular telephone customer.Â  She cancelled the agreement after the initial 12 month service period, and was charged a $200.00 early cancellation fee.Â  She filed this action in the circuit court alleging the cancellation fee was charged in breach of the terms of the agreement.[2]Â  SunCom moved for judgment on the pleadings or alternatively to dismiss or stay the action.Â  The trial court issued an order staying the matter and, further, requiring SunCom to petition the FCC to seek a declaratory ruling as to whether the early termination fee was a â€œrate charged.â€ Â The matter was stayed pending the FCCâ€™s ruling.Â Â  Edwards appeals.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nThe sole issue we need address is whether an order granting a stay is immediately appealable.Â  We hold that it is not.\r\nAbsent some specialized statute, the immediate appealability of an interlocutory or intermediate order depends on whether the order falls within S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330.Â  Baldwin Const. Co., Inc. v. Graham, 357 S.C. 227, 593 S.E.2d 146 (2004). Â Pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-330, the following types of orders are appealable:\r\n\r\n  1) Any intermediate judgment, order or decree in a law case involving the merits in actions commenced in the court of common pleas and general sessions, brought there by original process or removed there from any inferior court or jurisdiction, and final judgments in such actions; provided, that if no appeal be taken until final judgment is entered the court may upon appeal from such final judgment review any intermediate order or decree necessarily affecting the judgment not before appealed from; \r\n  (2) An order affecting a substantial right made in an action when such order (a) in effect determines the action and prevents a judgment from which an appeal might be taken or discontinues the action, (b) grants or refuses a new trial or (c) strikes out an answer or any part thereof or any pleading in any action; \r\n  (3) A final order affecting a substantial right made in any special proceeding or upon a summary application in any action after judgment; and \r\n  (4) An interlocutory order or decree in a court of common pleas granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing an injunction or granting, continuing, modifying, or refusing the appointment of a receiver.Â  \r\n\r\nWe find the present order does not fall into any of these categories.Â  It does not involve the merits, affect a substantial right, or prevent a judgment from which an appeal may later be taken. \r\nAn order which involves the merits is one that â€œmust finally determine some substantial matter forming the whole or a part of some cause of action or defense.â€ Mid-State Distribs. v. Century Importers, Inc., 310 S.C. 330, 334, 426 S.E.2d 777, 780 (1993).Â  Interlocutory orders affecting a substantial right may be immediately appealed pursuant to Â§ 14-3-330(2). Orders affecting a substantial right â€œdiscontinue an action, prevent an appeal, grant or refuse a new trial, or strike out an action or defense.â€Â  Id. at 335 n. 4, 426 S.E.2d at 780 n. 4.\r\nThe order here does not discontinue the proceeding.Â  It merely temporarily stays the matter pending a ruling by the FCC.Â  Accordingly, we find an order granting a stay is not immediately appealable.Â  \r\nEdwards cited Hiott v. Contracting Services, 276 S.C. 632, 633, 281 S.E.2d 224, 225 (1981), as supporting her claim that an order granting a stay is directly appealable.Â  However, Hiott adopted this rule, without discussion, citing Dill v. Moon, 14 S.C. 338 (1880).Â  Dill dealt with the refusal to stay an action and, further, is based upon broad language which this Court no longer follows.Â  The Dill court noted that the 1873 code allowed appeals from orders â€œinvolving the merits.â€ It went on to cite an 1878 case holding that an order denying a motion to transfer a case to the county of the defendantâ€™s residence, after the law upon that subject had been changed, was immediately appealable.Â  The Dill court stated, â€œ[t]he word â€˜meritsâ€™ naturally bears the sense of including all that the party may claim of right in reference to his case. . . . It may be concluded that whenever a substantial right of the party to an action material to obtaining a judgment in such action is denied, a right of appeal lies to this court.â€Â  Under Â§ 14-3-330, however, an order must affect a substantial right and prevent a judgment from which an appeal may later be taken in order to be immediately appealed.Â  Accordingly, we find Hiott and Dill are no longer good law such that they are overruled.[3]Â Â  \r\nAPPEAL DISMISSED.[4]\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and BURNETT, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  A state is preempted from regulating the entry of or the rates charged by any commercial mobile telephone service by 42 USC Â§ 332 (c)(3)(a) of the Federal Communications Act.\r\n[2]Â  The contract initialed by Edwards states, â€œMy service plan has a 12 month service contract and if terminated prior to the end of that term I will be charged a cancellation fee of $200.00 to my account.Â  I also understand that my contract automatically renews for one year past 3/24/01.Â  I understand if I do not wish for my contract to automatically renew, cancellation requires 30 days written notification prior to automatic renewal date.â€\r\n[3] Â To the extent it is inconsistent with our holding today, we likewise overrule the Court of Appealsâ€™ recent opinion in Carolina Water Svc. v. Lexington County Joint Municipal Water and Sewer Commâ€™n, Op. No. 4047, S.C. Ct. Appeals filed Jan. 20 2006 (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 5 at 65).Â Â  \r\n[4]Â  We note that, although we find no abuse of discretion in the grant of a stay in this case, Edwards is free to move the circuit court for a lift of the stay, or such other relief as may be necessary, if the matter pending before the FCC is unduly delayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26162","title":"In the Matter of Carter D.

Harrington, of Gainesville, Florida, pro se.Â  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent (Agreement) pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to an admonition, public reprimand, or sixty (60) day suspension from the practice of law.Â  See Rule 7(b), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent further agrees that, if suspended from the practice of law, he must appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness as a condition of reinstatement.Â  Â Â We accept the Agreement and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law in this state for a sixty (60) day period.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAround January 2004, respondent was retained to represent a client on a pending driving under the influence (DUI) charge.Â  Respondent informed the client that his fee would be $5,000.Â  Due to the clientâ€™s financial situation, respondent allowed the client to make regular payments towards the retainer.Â  \r\nBetween January 3 and June 8, 2004, the client made payments totaling $2,270, including a payment of $200 on April 19, 2004, and a payment of $170 on June 8, 2004.Â  Respondentâ€™s license to practice law in this state was suspended by order of the Court dated April 9, 2004 for failure to pay his 2004 license fees.Â  Respondent admits his acceptance of fees while under suspension constituted the unauthorized practice of law.Â  Â \r\nIn or about August 2004, respondentâ€™s wife informed the client that respondent was relocating his practice.Â  The client was not provided with a current address or telephone number and had no Â way to contact respondent.Â  \r\nBy letter dated January 13, 2005, ODC notified respondent of the complaint in this matter.Â  The letter requested a response within fifteen (15) days.Â  Respondent failed to respond or otherwise communicate with ODC in response to the January 13, 2005 letter.Â  On March 29, 2005, ODC sent an additional letter to respondent pursuant to In the Matter of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982), again requesting a response from respondent.Â  Respondent failed to respond.Â Â Â  \r\nRespondent represents that, during the time period addressed by the Agreement, he suffered significant medical problems, including a stroke and resulting partial paralysis.Â  Respondent required constant medical attention resulting in frequent in-patient and out-patient care.Â  Financial hardships contributed to his inability to provide effective legal representation to his clients.Â  \r\nAs a result of his health and subsequent relocation outside South Carolina to seek medical rehabilitation, respondent arranged to have his client files delivered to the office of another attorney.[1]Â  Respondent failed to notify his clients of the transfer of their files.Â  Respondent now understands it was not permissible to release client files to another attorney without the clientâ€™s prior knowledge and consent.Â  \r\nÂ Respondent acknowledges that his medical condition is not so severe as to render him unable to assist in his own defense in this matter or make an informed decision as to whether to enter into the Agreement, but agrees that his condition currently renders him unfit to practice law.Â  Respondent has expressed remorse for his conduct and represents he will strive to ensure that this situation does not recur.Â  \r\nODC agrees respondent has been forthright and cooperative throughout its investigation.Â  Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.1 (lawyer shall provide competent representation to client); Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with diligence and promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably informed about status of a matter);\r\nRule 8.1 (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand for information from a disciplinary authority); and Rule 8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent further admits his misconduct constitutes a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for a sixty (60) day period. Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  As a condition of seeking reinstatement under Rule 32, RLDE, respondent must appear before the Committee on Character and Fitness for the purpose of determining whether his health is such that he is capable of resuming the practice of law.[2]Â  Â Â \r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent represents his trust account is in good order and that no client funds have been compromised.\r\n[2] The request to appoint an attorney to protect respondentâ€™s clientsâ€™ interests is denied.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26163","title":"SCDOT v.

Power Co-op., Inc. v. Riley Stoker Corp., 901 F.2d 441, 445 (5th Cir. 1990). Â Â An abuse of discretion\r\noccurs when the ruling is based on an error of law or a factual conclusion without evidentiary support. Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 363 S.C. 460, 467, 611 S.E.2d 905, 908 (2005).Â  \r\nLaw / Analysis\r\nFirst Carolina argues that the trial court erred in allowing SCDOT to deposit the condemnation judgment funds pursuant to Rule 67, SCRCP in order to stop the accrual of post-judgment interest during the appeals process.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nThe cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the intent of the legislature.Â  Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000) (citations omitted).Â  All rules of statutory construction are subservient to the maxim that legislative intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used, and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the statute.Â  McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002).Â  Whenever possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain language of the statute itself.Â  Whitner v. State, 328 S.C 1, 6, 492 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1997).Â Â  â€œWhere the statuteâ€™s language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has no right to impose another meaning.â€Â  Hodges, 341 S.C. at 85, 533 S.E.2d at 581.Â Â  \r\nThe Eminent Domain Procedure Act (the Act) provides:\r\n\r\n[a] condemnor shall pay interest at the rate of eight percent a year upon sums found to be just compensation by the appraisal panel or judgment of a court to the condemnee. This interest shall accrue from the date of filing of the Condemnation Notice through the date of verdict or judgment by the court. Interest accruing on funds on deposit with the clerk of court must be offset against the interest computed pursuant to this section. Interest shall not accrue during the twenty-day period commencing upon the date of verdict or order of judgment. Â If the judgment is not paid within the twenty-day period, interest at the rate provided by law for interest on judgments must be added to the judgment. Thereafter, the entire judgment shall earn interest at the rate provided by law for interest on judgments.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-420(A) (2005) (emphasis added).Â  The Act also provides that â€œ[i]n the event of conflict between this act and the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, this act shall prevail.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-120 (2005).\r\nRule 67, SCRCP, allows a judgment debtor to avoid further accrual of post-judgment interest pending the resolution of an appeal from the judgment by depositing the judgment with the court.Â  Russo v. Sutton, 317 S.C. 441, 444, 454 S.E.2d 895, 896 (1995).Â  The rule provides:\r\n\r\n[i]n an action in which any part of the relief sought is a judgment for a sum of money or the disposition of a sum of money or the disposition of any other thing capable of delivery, a party, upon notice to every other party, and by leave of court, may deposit with the court all or any part of such sum or thing, whether or not that party claims all or any part of the sum or thing. Money paid into the court under this rule shall be deposited as directed by the court in any bank or institution authorized to receive public funds, and shall be withdrawn only upon the check of the clerk of court in favor of the party to whom the order of the court directs.\r\n\r\nRule 67, SCRCP.&nbsp; \r\nThe Act clearly requires post judgment interest to be added to any judgment which is not paid within the twenty day period.Â  Any deposit under Rule 67, SCRCP, would be in direct contravention of the Actâ€™s requirement that post-judgment interest be added to the condemnation judgment.Â  To resolve the inherent conflict between these provisions, we need look no further than the clear and unambiguous language of the statute.Â  Section 28-2-120 mandates that in the event of conflict, the Act prevails over the rules of civil procedure.Â  Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing SCDOT to deposit the judgment funds in order to stop the accrual of post-judgment interest. \r\nSCDOT relies on South Carolina Dept. of Trans. v. Faulkenberry, 337 S.C. 140, 522 S.E.2d 822 (Ct. App. 1999) to support its position that a deposit pursuant to Rule 67, SCRCP, does not conflict with the Act, and that the deposit should be allowed to stop the accrual of post-judgment interest.Â  This reliance is misplaced.Â  \r\nFirst, Faulkenberry is primarily a case involving pre-judgment interest.Â  In Faulkenberry, the landowner was paid $863,574 as just compensation upon SCDOTâ€™s filing of a condemnation action.Â  After trial, the jury awarded the landowner $2,396,100.Â  The landowner claimed that he was due prejudgment interest on the full jury verdict under Â§ 28-2-420 from the date of condemnation through the date of the verdict.Â  SCDOT contended that the landowner was entitled to interest only on the difference between the jury verdict and the initial payment.Â  The court of appeals held that the landowner was entitled to interest only on the condemnation award in excess of the amount he was originally paid.Â  Faulkenberry, 337 S.C. at 156, 522 S.E.2d at 830.\r\nAdditionally, Faulkenberry does not address deposits with the court pursuant to Rule 67, SCRCP.[2]Â  The only reference to deposits in Faulkenberry relates to deposits made pursuant to Â§ 28-2-90(3).Â Â  The fundamental difference between these two types of deposits is that the landowner has the right to withdraw the funds deposited under Â§ 28-2-90(3), whereas that same right does not apply under Rule 67, SCRCP.Â Â  Accordingly, Faulkenberry does not address the present issue, and can not be relied upon to show that there is no conflict between Rule 67, SCRCP, and Â§ 28-2-420. \r\nAccordingly, the clear and unambiguous language of Â§ 28-2-420(A) and Â§ 28-2-120 require post-judgment interest to accrue on any judgment not paid within twenty days of the entry of the order of the judgment.Â  Therefore, we find that the trial court abused its discretion by allowing SCDOT to deposit the judgment funds and stop the accrual of post-judgment interest.\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the foregoing, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s order granting SCDOTâ€™s motion to deposit judgment funds.\r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œDraw downâ€ refers to the condemneesâ€™ right to a portion of funds on deposit with clerk of court after the condemnor has taken possession.Â  â€œUpon written application, in form satisfactory to the clerk of court, by all named condemnees at any time after which the condemnor has taken possession, when the right to take is not contested, the clerk of court shall pay to them the amount applied for up to fifty percent of the funds deposited with the clerk of court by the condemnor in that action.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 28-2-480 (2005).Â \r\n\r\n[2] Faulkenberry cites Russo v. Sutton, 317 S.C. 441, 454 S.E.2d 895 (1995), for the proposition that compliance with Rule 67, SCRCP, would prevent the accrual of interest on a judgment debtorâ€™s deposit of funds with the court.Â  However, it is important to note the Russo is not a condemnation action; Russo is an action concerning criminal conversation and alienation of affection.Â  \r\nAdditionally, both Faulkenberry and Russo cite Horry County v. Woodward, 291, S.C. 1, 351 S.E.2d 877 (1986), for the proposition that â€œ[p]ayment of a judgment into court is deemed to be a payment of money for the use of the person entitled thereto and stops the running of judgment interest.â€Â  Woodward, 291 S.C. at 3, 351 S.E.2d at 878.Â  While this statement may be applicable to Rule 67, SCRCP, in general, it is no longer applicable in relation to the Eminent Domain Procedure Act.Â  Woodward relied on S.C. Code Ann Â§ 28-5-320 (1976), repealed by 1987 Act No. 173.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26165","title":"In the Matter of Randolph Frails","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26165","description":"This is an attorney-discipline matter.

Richardson, Jr., Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara\r\nSeymour, Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nDesa Ballard and Jason B. Buffkin, both of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney-discipline matter, Respondent concedes that he violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rules 1.1 (requiring competence), 1.3 (requiring diligence), and 5.5 (prohibiting the unauthorized practice of law).[1]Â  Because Respondent violated Rule 5.5 while he was suspended by order of this Court, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) recommends that we hold Respondent in contempt. Â We do not hold Respondent in contempt, and as recommended by the Panel of the Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Panel), we find that a sixty-day definite suspension, credited against Respondentâ€™s previously served six-month interim suspension, in addition to payment of the costs of the proceeding, is an appropriate sanction.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent is a member of the South Carolina Bar and of the Georgia Bar.Â  His office is in Augusta, Georgia, and almost all of his practice is in Georgia.Â  A small percentage of his practice has been conducting closings on South Carolina realty from his office in Georgia. \r\nAlthough he had completed the requisite hours, Respondent failed to file a Continuing Legal Education (CLE) report for 2001.Â  In addition, he failed to pay his 2002 South Carolina Bar dues.\r\nA certified letter from this Court that was sent to Respondentâ€™s Augusta address informed him that he had been administratively suspended from the practice of law in South Carolina.Â  An employee signed for this letter, but Respondent was never made aware of it.\r\nSoon thereafter, Respondent conducted a closing in Georgia for Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Williams (the Williamses) on South Carolina realty.Â  The deed was to be recorded by Respondent in Aiken County.\r\nShortly after the closing, we issued an order suspending Respondent and other members of the Bar for failing to file 2001 CLE reports.Â  The order was not served on Respondent, but it was published in the advance sheets.Â  Respondent did not subscribe to the advance sheets, so he did not become aware of the order.\r\nA few months later, Respondent realized that he was no longer receiving mailings from the South Carolina Bar, and he concluded that his South Carolina license had lapsed.Â  He made no inquiry to confirm his conclusion, nor any effort to revive his license.Â  He did not submit his already late CLE report for 2001, or pay his overdue bar dues for 2002.Â  Further, he later failed to submit a CLE report for 2002, and failed to pay his 2003 dues.\r\nRespondent continued to conduct closings on South Carolina property from his office in Georgia.Â  In connection with those closings, he continued to record deeds in South Carolina courthouses.Â  \r\nIn August 2003, ODC contacted Respondent about a complaint filed by the Williamses regarding the closing Respondent had conducted for them.Â  In the complaint it was alleged that Respondent had not recorded the deed until nine months after the closing and that Respondentâ€™s South Carolina license was not active at the time of the closing.Â  Respondent informed ODC that he believed his license was active when he conducted the closing for the Williamses.Â  Around this time, Respondent ceased conducting closings on South Carolina realty and recording documents in South Carolina courthouses.\r\nIn November 2003, ODC filed a Petition for Interim Suspension and Rule to Show Cause why Respondent should not be held in contempt for violating our suspension order by continuing to conduct closings.Â  We placed Respondent on interim suspension and issued a Rule to Show Cause.Â  After Respondent appeared before us, we decided to hold the contempt matter in abeyance until resolution of the Williams matter.\r\nIn June 2004, we granted Respondentâ€™s petition to be reinstated.Â  He had submitted all of his late CLE reports and paid all bar dues.Â  Our decision did not affect the Williams complaint or the contempt matter, which were still pending.\r\nAfter a hearing on the Williams matter, the Panel found that Respondent had failed to competently and diligently handle the Williams closing, in violation of Rules 1.1 and 1.3 of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  The Panel therefore found that Respondent was subject to discipline pursuant to Rule 7(a)(1), RLDE, Rule 413,\r\nSCACR.\r\nThe Panel also found that Respondent had violated Rule 5.5, RPC, Rule 407, SCACR, by conducting real-estate closings while his license was suspended.Â  Not only did Respondent violate the rule, but also he violated an order of this Court.Â  This all stemmed from his failure to pay bar dues as required by Rule 410, SCACR, which led to his administrative suspension pursuant to Rule 419,\r\nSCACR.\r\nBased on these findings, the Panel recommends that Respondent receive a definite suspension of sixty days.Â  The Panel further recommends that Respondent be credited for his time under interim suspension - more than six months - meaning the Panel recommends â€œthat no further period of suspension be imposed.â€Â  The Panel also recommends that Respondent be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings, five hundred forty-four dollars and fourteen cents. \r\nFINDINGS AND SANCTION\r\nNoting Respondentâ€™s agreement, we adopt the findings of the Panel concerning the violations of the Rules of Professional Conduct.Â  We do not hold Respondent in contempt for violating our suspension order, because we find that Respondent did not do so willfully.Â  See In re Brown, 333 S.C. 414, 420-21, 511 S.E.2d 351, 354 (1998) (noting that contempt requires willfull conduct) (citations omitted).Â  Respondent should have made some effort to determine whether he was engaging in the unauthorized practice of law, but we find he genuinely believed that he was not.\r\nWe also adopt the Panelâ€™s proposed sanction.Â  Respondent is definitely suspended for sixty days, but this suspension is credited against his more-than-six-month interim suspension.Â  Respondent shall pay the costs of the proceeding below, five hundred forty-four dollars and fourteen cents, within thirty days. \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Rule 407, SCACR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26166","title":"Bursey v.

App. 2004).Â  We affirm.\r\nPROCEDURAL FACTS\r\nAs part of the dam remediation project on Lake Murray, petitioner (SCE&amp;G) planned a back-up dam to be constructed by using materials that could be excavated on-site.Â  During this planning process, SCE&amp;G contacted the Department of Health and Environmental Control (DHEC) to inquire into whether it would be necessary to obtain a mine operating permit.Â  DHEC responded by informing SCE&amp;G that no permit would be needed, as the material SCE&amp;G planned on excavating would be used on-site rather than being sold or transported to another location and, thus, did not fall within the definition of â€œmining.â€Â  In response to DHECâ€™s determination, nearby resident, Brett Bursey, and the Mining Association of South Carolina (Association) individually filed appeals with the Mining Council (Council).[1]Â  The Mining Council then agreed to conduct a hearing to review DHECâ€™s decision not to require a mine operating permit.Â  Following the hearing, the Mining Council found SCE&amp;G was required to obtain a permit for the proposed actions.Â  The circuit court and Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  See Bursey, supra.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Should the decision of the Mining Council be vacated for lack of subject matter jurisdiction?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err by applying an inappropriate standard of review?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err by applying a substantial evidence standard of review to a legal determination by the Mining Council?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        IV.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err by finding respondentsâ€™ appeals to the Mining Council were timely?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI. Subject matter jurisdiction\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the Council did not have subject matter jurisdiction to entertain respondentsâ€™ appeals because appeals to the Council can be taken only from the approval or denial of an application for an operating permit and cannot be taken from a decision not to require a permit.Â  SCE&amp;G claims that such an appeal should be taken directly to the Administrative Law Court\r\n(ALC).\r\nThe South Carolina Mining Act, in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-30 (Supp. 2005), states that DHEC is responsible for administering the provisions and requirements of the Mining Act, which includes the process and issuance of mining permits.Â  Section 48-20-30 further states that DHEC â€œhas ultimate authority, subject to the appeal provisions of this chapter regulating and controlling such activity.â€Â  (Emphasis added).\r\nSouth Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-60 (Supp. 2005), provides that an appeal from a DHEC decision regarding an operating permit may be taken to the Council â€œas provided by Section 48-20-190.â€Â  Section 48-20-190 provides, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nAn applicant for a certificate of exploration or operating permit or a person who is aggrieved and is directly affected by the permit may appeal to the council from a decision or determination of the department issuing, refusing, modifying, suspending, revoking, or terminating a certificate of exploration or operating permit or reclamation plan, or imposing a term or condition on the certificate, permit, or reclamation plan.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis added).Â  This section further requires the Council to issue a written decision setting forth its findings of fact and conclusions, and authorizes the Council to direct DHEC to take any action necessary to effectuate the Councilâ€™s decision.\r\nSection 48-20-60 states that an appeal from a DHEC decision regarding an operating permit may be taken to the Council as provided by Â§ 48-20-190.Â  This section indicates that any appeal involving a decision goes to the Council, including a decision not to require a permit.\r\nA technical reading of Â§ 48-20-190, however, indicates that respondentsâ€™ appeals should not go to the Council.Â  DHECâ€™s decision did not issue a permit or refuse to issue a permit.Â  Instead, DHECâ€™s decision was a decision that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s project did not require a permit.Â  We conclude, however, that such a technical reading is strained and is not a practical interpretation of Â§ 48-20-190 that is consonant with the purpose and policy of the appeal provisions of the Mining Act.Â  See TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998) (statutes, as a whole, must receive practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation, consonant with the purpose, design, and policy of lawmakers).\r\nFurther, we find the legislatureâ€™s intent would not be effectuated by requiring that an appeal from a DHEC decision not to require a permit be taken to the ALC, as opposed to the Council, which the legislature has deemed the appropriate specialized entity for addressing appeals regarding DHECâ€™s interpretation of the Mining Act.Â  See Strother v. Lexington County Recreation Commâ€™n, 332 S.C. 54, 504 S.E.2d 117 (1998) (cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate legislative intent whenever possible).Â  \r\nAccordingly, the Mining Council had subject matter jurisdiction to hear respondentsâ€™ appeals.\r\nII. Appropriate standard of review\r\nIn reviewing the Councilâ€™s decision that DHEC should have required SCE&amp;G to obtain a permit, the circuit court applied the substantial evidence standard located in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA), which states that a reviewing court may reverse or modify a decision of an agency if the findings, inferences, conclusions, or decisions of that agency are â€œclearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(e) (2005).Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the circuit court, finding the APA required reviewing courts to apply the substantial evidence standard applicable to appeals from decisions of an administrative agency.\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the APA is not applicable to the instant appeal and that the standard of review located in Title 18, Chapter 7, of the South Carolina Code should have been applied by the lower courts.Â  In support, SCE&amp;G cites S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-200 (Supp. 2005), which states:\r\n\r\nAn appeal to the courts may be taken from any decision of the council, or its designated committee or the hearing panel, in the manner provided by Chapter 7 of Title 18 [S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 18-7-10 to -300 (1985 &amp; Supp. 2005)].\r\n\r\nSCE&amp;G claims this reference means appeals from the Council must be reviewed using the de novo standard of review set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985).[2]\r\nThe APA purports to provide uniform procedures before State Boards and Commissions and for judicial review after the exhaustion of administrative remedies.Â  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d 304 (1981).Â  We have previously used the APA standard of review when reviewing the appeal of a Mining Council decision.Â  In Waters v. S.C. Land Res. Conservation Commâ€™n, 321 S.C. 219, 467 S.E.2d 913 (1996), the South Carolina Land Resources Conservation Commission (LRCC)[3] granted a corporation a permit to mine kaolin.Â  The Council upheld LRCCâ€™s decision, and the circuit court upheld both determinations.Â  In affirming the Councilâ€™s determination, we specifically identified and applied the substantial evidence standard of review contained in the\r\nAPA.\r\nFurther, in the analogous case of Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., supra, we ruled the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission (Commission) was an agency for purposes of the APA and that the standard of review located in the APA, rather than the standard of review previously applied by the courts in workersâ€™ compensation cases, applied to appeals from the Commission.Â  The Commission and the Mining Council are similar entities.Â  The Commission has seven members who are appointed by the Governor and hears and determines all contested cases involving workersâ€™ compensation.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-3-20 (1985).Â  The Council has eleven members, nine of which are appointed by the Governor.Â  The Council hears contested cases involving mining permit decisions made by DHEC.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-21-20 and 48-20-190 (Supp. 2005).Â  In Lark, we held the Commission was an agency for purposes of the APA because it has rule making authority and hears and decides contested matters.Â  The APA defines â€œagencyâ€ as â€œeach state board, commission, department or officer . . . authorized by law to make rules or to determine contested cases.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-310(1) (2005).Â  The Council, like the Commission, falls within this agency definition because it determines contested cases.\r\nWe find the courts on appeal should defer to the findings of the Council in these matters given the Council has special expertise on mining that the appellate courts do not possess.Â  Based on the authority of Waters and Lark, we find the APA standard of review applies to appeals from Mining Council decisions.Â  Cf. S.C. Reg. 89-290(H) (Supp. 2005) (all Council hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the APA).\r\nIII. Application of appropriate standard of review\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the Court of Appeals erroneously applied the substantial evidence standard to a legal determination, that is whether the project fell within an exception to the permitting requirements, rather than examining this determination for an error of law.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(A)(6)(d) (2005) (court may reverse or modify decision if substantial rights of appellant have been prejudiced because administrative findings, inferences, conclusions or decisions are affected by other error of law).\r\nThe Mining Act, which requires a permit for all mining activities, defines â€œminingâ€ as: \r\n\r\n(a) the breaking of the surface soil to facilitate or accomplish the extraction or removal of ores or mineral solids for sale or processing or consumption in the regular operation of a business; \r\n(b) removal of overburden lying above natural deposits of ore or mineral solids and removal of the mineral deposits exposed, or by removal of ores or mineral solids from deposits lying exposed in their natural state. \r\n. . . Mining does not include excavation or grading when conducted solely in aid of on-site farming or of on-site construction.Â  . . . \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-40(1) (Supp. 2005) (emphasis added).\r\nSCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities on the project included blasting, dewatering, crushing, and stockpiling rock, as well as converting the rock into concrete.Â  All activities were to be performed on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s property.\r\nIn reviewing DHECâ€™s determination that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities did not require a permit, the Council concluded SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities constituted mining, did not fit within the on-site construction exception, and that a permit was required.Â  Both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals affirmed, finding substantial evidence existed in the record to support the Councilâ€™s decision that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s project required a permit.\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the lower courts erred by applying the substantial evidence standard of review to the determination of whether the project went beyond the scope of the exception for on-site construction.Â  They argue deference is not required to the Councilâ€™s decision because an interpretation of the requirements of the Mining Act, such as the definition of â€œexcavation,â€ is solely a matter of law.\r\nThe question of whether SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities on the project meet the exception to the permitting requirements carved out by the statute is a mixed question of fact and law.Â  There is a question of law in determining the meaning of the term â€œexcavationâ€ in the exception.Â  See Charleston County Parks &amp; Rec. Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995) (determination of legislative intent is a matter of law); Thompson v. Ford Motor Co., 200 S.C. 393, 21 S.E.2d 34 (1942) (the interpretation of the meaning of a statutory term is not a finding of fact).Â  There is also a question of fact in determining whether SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities in association with the project exceed the scope of the definition of â€œexcavationâ€ in the exception.\r\nBoth the circuit court and the Court of Appeals addressed the definition of excavation, while the Council did not.Â  The Council simply found that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities involved more than excavation.Â  The circuit court found that excavating encompasses:Â  (1) forming a cavity or hole in; (2) forming by hollowing out; (3) digging out and removing; and (4) exposing to view by or as if by digging away a covering.Â  The Court of Appeals stated that, while â€œexcavationâ€ was not defined in the statute, the parties had submitted that the literal definition is akin to that of â€œdigging.â€Â  Using the APAâ€™s â€œaffected by an error of lawâ€ standard of review, we find the lower courts did not err in their definition of â€œexcavation.â€\r\nOn the issue of whether SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activity is excavation, the appropriate standard of review, as used by the lower courts, is the substantial evidence standard of review.\r\nThe Council found SCE&amp;Gâ€™s proposed activities of blasting to create an approximately 60-acre quarry pit, dewatering the quarry pit, producing aggregate from the quarry pit, processing aggregate from the quarry pit using primary and secondary and possibly tertiary crushers and conveyors, stockpiling the crushed aggregate, and further processing the aggregate to create concrete to construct a dam necessitated that SCE&amp;G be required to obtain a mining permit.Â  The Council found these activities involved more than â€œexcavation and gradingâ€ as contemplated by the exception to the permitting requirements.Â  Both the circuit court and the Court of Appeals found there was substantial evidence to support the Councilâ€™s finding that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s project went beyond excavation solely in aid of on-site construction and amounts to mining subject to regulation under the Mining Act.\r\nAt the hearing before the Council, Craig Kennedy, the assistant director in the Mining and Solid Waste Management Division of DHEC, testified.Â  He stated the type of projects normally covered by the exception for excavation for on-site construction are for projects where a developer is bringing a site down to a certain grade to allow for construction of a structure, e.g. building a Wal-Mart parking lot, and where a person borrows material from one part of their property to be used on another part of their property.Â  He stated the exception had been used in two cases similar to the instant case and that he interprets the statutory exception to apply anytime the project is solely in aid of on-site construction.Â  Kennedy testified that, without a mining permit, SCE&amp;G will not be required to have a reclamation plan for the land once the project is complete.\r\nJames Daniel, the vice-president of Vulcan Materials Company, testified SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities exceed excavating and grading because the project is being operated like a quarry by engaging in blasting, dewatering, crushing rock, and processing the rock into concrete.\r\nA portion of the Technical Specifications of SCE&amp;Gâ€™s project was introduced at the hearing.Â  The document covered the aggregate production of turning the rock into concrete.Â  The specifications mention the excavation of overburden, blasting, aggregate crushing and handling, dewatering, and creation of concrete that will occur on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s property.Â  The specifications reference the large amounts of equipment that will be involved in the project, such as trucks, conveyors, bins, silos, bulldozers, crushers, a water storage tank, and a plant for mixing the concrete.\r\nFrom a review of the record, the Councilâ€™s decision finding SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities constituted mining and did not fall within the statutory exception to the requirement of a mining permit is not clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative and substantial evidence on the whole record.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals did not err by finding there was substantial evidence to support the Councilâ€™s decision. Â Cf. Dunton v. S.C. Bd. of Examâ€™rs in Optometry, 291 S.C. 221, 353 S.E.2d 132 (1987) (construction of a statute by the agency charged with its administration will be accorded the most respectful consideration and will not be overruled absent compelling reasons).\r\nIV. Timeliness of appeals\r\nSCE&amp;G argues respondents, Bursey and the Mining Association (Association), failed to file their appeals to the Council in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nPursuant to the Mining Act,\r\n. . . The person taking the appeal within thirty days after the departmentâ€™s decision shall give written notice to the council through its secretary that he desires to appeal and filing a copy of the notice with the department at the same time.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-190 (Supp. 2005).Â  While this language seems to require that a notice of appeal be filed within thirty days of the actual decision, the Actâ€™s regulations state that the time for giving a notice of appeal does not actually begin to run until the date of notice of the DHEC decision.Â  See 26 S.C. Code Ann. Reg. 89-290(B) (Supp. 2005) (â€œThe person taking the appeal shall within thirty days after notification of the Departmentâ€™s decision, give written notice to the Mining Council through its secretary that he desires to take an appeal, at the same time filing a copy of the notice with the Department.â€) (emphasis added).\r\nDHEC notified SCE&amp;G of its decision that no permit was required by letter dated June 5, 2001.Â  On appeal to the Council, SCE&amp;G argued Bursey and the Associationâ€™s appeals, filed October 17 and October 19, respectively, were untimely because they were filed outside of the thirty-day time period for filing appeals to the Council.Â  Craig Kennedy, of DHEC, testified at the Council hearing that he informed Bursey of DHECâ€™s decision in a telephone conversation before August 31, 2001.Â  Kennedy also testified that he informed the director of the Association of the decision on September 10, and provided a copy of DHECâ€™s written determination to an Association member on September 27, 2001.Â  Kennedy admitted that September 27 was the first time anyone with the Association was provided with a written explanation of the factual and legal basis of DHECâ€™s determination.\r\nKennedy testified that, as of September 24, the decision not to require a permit was â€œpretty final,â€ but that he could have been overruled by his supervisor at DHEC.Â  He stated, however, that whether to require the permit was his decision to make.\r\nThe director of the Association testified he was not aware of the DHEC decision not to require a permit until he received a copy of the written determination on September 27, 2001.\r\nBursey testified he became aware of DHECâ€™s decision not to require a permit at some point in June 2001.Â  He testified he submitted a Freedom of Information request to DHEC on June 29 requesting any written documentation relating to the decision, but did not receive a response from DHEC until September 26, 2001.Â  Bursey testified that when he did receive a response from DHEC, a written explanation for their decision was not included.Â  Bursey explained he did not receive what he felt to be a credible answer regarding the permitting decision until October 15, 2001, when he was informed by the project manager for SCE&amp;G that no permit would be required because the proposed actions were not â€œmining.â€Â  Prior to that time, Bursey had concluded that DHEC staff had determined SCE&amp;G did not need a permit.Â  At the time he spoke with Kennedy, Bursey testified he was unable to determine if a decision was final.\r\nThe Council concluded that DHECâ€™s final decision was not communicated to Bursey or the Association before September 27, 2001, when DHEC provided an Association member with a written copy of the decision.Â  Finding Bursey and the Association did not have notice of DHECâ€™s decision before September 27, 2001, the Council ruled their appeals of October 17 and October 19 were timely filed within the thirty-day period.Â  The circuit court and Court of Appeals affirmed, finding there was substantial evidence to support the Councilâ€™s finding that the appeals were timely filed.\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the evidence in the record establishes that both Bursey and the Association knew of DHECâ€™s final determination long before September 27.\r\nThe possibility of drawing two inconsistent conclusions from the evidence does not prevent an Administrative Agencyâ€™s finding from being supported by substantial evidence.Â  Grant v. S.C. Coastal Council, 319 S.C. 348, 461 S.E.2d 388 (1995).Â  Rather, the appellate court need only find,\r\nconsidering the record as a whole, evidence that would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative agency reached.Â  Id. \r\nWe find there is substantial evidence in the record to support the Councilâ€™s decision that respondentsâ€™ appeals were timely filed.Â  While Bursey testified he became aware of DHECâ€™s decision not to require a permit in June 2001, he stated he did not believe this was a final decision made by DHEC, but was a staff decision that could be altered.Â  Kennedyâ€™s testimony that, as of September 24, the decision not to require a permit was â€œpretty final,â€ but was a decision that could have been overruled by his supervisor, supports Burseyâ€™s analysis of the situation.Â  As for the Association, while there was conflicting evidence as to what occurred in a telephone conversation between the Associationâ€™s director and Kennedy on September 10, Kennedy admitted that September 27 was the first time anyone with the Association was provided with a written explanation of DHECâ€™s determination.Â  Further, the director of the Association testified he was unaware of the DHEC decision until he received a copy of the written determination on September 27, 2001.Â  Considering the record as a whole, there is evidence that allows reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the Council reached.Â  See Grant, supra.\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals did not err by affirming the Councilâ€™s decision on the basis there was substantial evidence in the record to support the finding that the appeals were timely filed.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find the Mining Council had subject matter jurisdiction to hear respondentsâ€™ appeals and that the APA standard of review applies to appeals from Mining Council decisions.Â  Further, we find there was substantial evidence to support the Councilâ€™s finding that SCE&amp;Gâ€™s activities constituted mining and did not fall within the statutory exception to the requirement of a mining permit.Â  Finally, we find there was substantial evidence to support the Councilâ€™s finding that the appeals were timely filed.Â  Therefore, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which BURNETT, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, the circuit court erred in applying the standard of review found in the Administrative Procedures Act (APA)[4] rather than the de novo standard found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 18-7-170 (1985).Â  I would therefore vacate both the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and the circuit courtâ€™s order and remand for reconsideration of SCE &amp; Gâ€™s appeal.Â Â Â Â  \r\nIt is well-settled that a specific statute controls over a more general one, e.g., Capco of Summerville, Inc. v. J.H. Gayle Const. Co., Inc., 368 S.C. 137, 628 S.E.2d 38 (2006), and that a more recent legislative enactment prevails over an earlier one.Â  E.g,, Town of Duncan v. S.C. Budget &amp; Control Bd., 326 S.C. 6, 482 S.E.2d 768 (1997).Â  Here, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 48-20-200 (Supp. 2005), mandating that appeals from the Mining Council be taken in the manner provided by Â§ 18-7-170, was reenacted after the adoption of the APA, and hence is the more recent statute.Â  Perhaps even more persuasive is the fact that Â§ 48-20-200 is applicable only to Mining Council appeals, and therefore is the more specific statute.Â  Further, the fact that we have applied the APA standard in a previous Mining Council appeal where the parties did not contest the standard of review does not bind us in this case where the matter is properly preserved and presented for our review.Â  E.g., Hutto v. Southern Farm Bureau Life Ins. Co., 259 S.C. 170, 191 S.E.2d 7 (1972) (â€œIt is, of course, settled law that â€˜a case cannot be considered as a binding precedent on a legal point that was not argued in the case and not mentioned in the opinionâ€); cf. Breland v. Love Chevrolet Olds, Inc., 339 S.C. 89, 529 S.E.2d 11 (2000)(fact that Court decided prior appeal on merits is not dispositive whether order is directly appealable where appealability was not raised).\r\nÂ  The ordinary rules of statutory construction dictate that the de novo standard be applied.Â  I would therefore vacate the circuit court order and the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision and remand the matter to the circuit court for a de novo appellate review.\r\nBURNETT, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]The Mining Council is established in the office of the Governor and acts as an advisory body to the Governor in considering issues relating to mining.Â  In addition, the eleven-member Council adjudicates disputes arising from permitting determinations made by DHEC.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 48-21-20 and 48-20-190 (Supp. 2005).\r\n[2]Section 18-7-170 states:Â  â€œ. . . In giving judgment the court may affirm or reverse the judgment of the court below, in whole or in part, as to any or all of the parties and for errors of law and fact.â€ \r\n[3]Previously, permits were granted or denied by LRCC.Â  Due to government restructuring, the Mining Act is now administered by DHEC.\r\n[4] S.C.

Â An autopsy revealed the victim had been shot five times in the head, including three fatal shots.Â  Â Â \r\nPolice investigators testified the town house appeared ransacked, but there were no signs of a forced entry and nothing was broken.Â  The only item missing was the victimâ€™s wallet.Â  Investigators found five spent shell casings from a .25-caliber pistol on the victimâ€™s bedroom floor. \r\nAccording to Respondent, she ate dinner and watched a movie with the victim on November 3.Â  The victim stayed at the town house and Respondent stayed at the river house that night.Â  Respondent originally asserted she did not leave the river house until she went to breakfast at 6 a.m. on November 4.Â  She asserted she went to the town house at 6:50 a.m. to go hunting with the victim.Â  Respondent eventually told police the victim had said during dinner on November 3 he wanted to file for divorce.Â  She also admitted to police she was having an affair, but she denied having any marital problems.\r\nTestimony at trial revealed the victim had plans to go to a car auction with his brother in Ravenel the morning of November 4.Â  Family members also testified Respondent generally did not hunt, and when the victim did hunt, he would go with his grandson.\r\nAccording to Respondentâ€™s boyfriend, she came to his house about 3:30 a.m. on November 4 and stayed until 5 a.m.Â  She told him the victim had brought up divorce during dinner that night and she was worried because her beauty shop was in the back of the town house.Â  Respondent also told her boyfriend that she planned to work in the yard at the river house on November 4.\r\nRespondent told police the victim owned a .357 Magnum revolver and she owned a .22-caliber derringer. Â Respondent admitted the couple owned a .25-caliber pistol when she was specifically asked by police about the gun.Â  Her sons testified Respondent possessed the coupleâ€™s .25-caliber pistol, and Respondent told police she had returned the pistol to the victim.Â  Respondent also told police she saw the .25-caliber pistol on the victimâ€™s bedside nightstand the Sunday before the murder.Â  \r\nRespondent gave her son, Tony, the keys to the river house after her arrest.Â  Ronald, the coupleâ€™s other son, made a copy of the keys and made at least three trips to the river house between March and April 1998.Â  During one visit to the river house, Ronaldâ€™s ex-wife found a bag with .25-caliber bullets and a box with a receipt for a .25-caliber pistol in a bedroom closet.Â  Ronald turned these items over to the police.Â  \r\nIn April 1999, homeowners near the river house discovered a garbage bag in the creek behind their house.Â  The bag contained another garbage bag, rocks, and a brick.Â  The second bag contained five surgical gloves, two shirts, and a pair of jeans.Â  One of Respondentâ€™s daughters-in-law identified the shirts as belonging to Respondent, the jeans as Respondentâ€™s size, and the gloves as similar to those Respondent used at her beauty shop.Â  The only hair sample found on the clothing could not be identified. \r\nPolice also discovered a cinder block in a search of the creek.Â  A .25-caliber pistol, the victimâ€™s wallet, and socks were found inside the cinder block.Â  The pistol was identified as the murder weapon through forensic testing.Â  \r\nThe State presented testimony from Eric Creech and Gary Wayne Walker to support its theory that Respondent murdered her husband.Â  During July 1997, Respondent told Creech, who did carpentry work for her, she had a rocky relationship with the victim and they hated each other.Â  When Creech asked Respondent why she did not get out of the marriage, Respondent replied she was scared she might lose some benefits or retirement, but she would stay married. \r\nWalker testified he had been an acquaintance of the Douglases since the 1970s.Â  One day in September 1997, he saw Respondent by the mailbox at the river house and stopped to talk.Â  He told Respondent he had a new job as an insurance agent and Respondent asked him about several types of insurance.Â  She then told him she was interested in life insurance on the victim and asked Walker to provide her with quotes.Â  Walker testified he saw Respondent at a later date and mentioned the quotes to her, but he never gave any actual quotes to Respondent.Â  \r\nThe State introduced evidence that Respondent was the beneficiary of two life insurance policies on the victim.Â  Respondent was the beneficiary of the victimâ€™s federal retirement benefits.Â  After the victimâ€™s death, Respondent submitted claims to receive the benefits under the life insurance policies and the victimâ€™s retirement account.Â  \r\nThe jury found Respondent guilty of murder and armed robbery.Â  The trial judge sentenced Respondent to life imprisonment for the murder charge and thirty yearsâ€™ imprisonment for the armed robbery charge, to be served concurrently.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s denial of Respondentâ€™s motion for directed verdict.Â  The Court of Appeals further found, however, that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting testimony that Respondent inquired about life insurance on the victim about two months before the murder.Â  The Court of Appeals reversed and granted Respondent a new trial.Â  Douglas, 359 S.C. 196-97, 203-06, 597 S.E.2d at 5-6, 9-11.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the trial court abused its discretion by admitting testimony that Respondent casually inquired about obtaining a life insurance policy on the victim two months before his death?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in concluding the admission of the testimony was not harmless error?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission or exclusion of evidence is a matter addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court and its ruling will not be disturbed in the absence of a manifest abuse of discretion accompanied by probable prejudice.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002); State v. Frank, 262 S.C. 526, 533, 205 S.E.2d 827, 830 (1974).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law. State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000); State v. Manning, 329 S.C. 1, 7, 495 S.E.2d 191, 194 (1997).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Admission of Testimony\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit testimony from Gary Walker that Respondent inquired about life insurance on the victim approximately two months before the murder.Â  We disagree.\r\nAll relevant evidence is admissible.Â  Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 127, 551 S.E.2d 240, 247 (2001).Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 382, 401 S.E.2d 146, 149 (1991).Â  \r\nEvidence of insurance is properly admitted when it tends to establish motive.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 311, 513 S.E.2d 606, 610 (1999); see also State v. Williams, 321 S.C. 327, 332-33, 468 S.E.2d 626, 629-30 (1996) (evidence that a month before the murder of his wife and son defendant had substantially increased life insurance benefits for them and made himself the beneficiary was some circumstantial evidence of defendantâ€™s motive).Â  Generally, evidence of a life insurance policy is properly admitted when there is evidence of the defendantâ€™s knowledge of the policyâ€™s existence, its validity, or believed validity, and that the defendant will benefit from it.Â  Beckham, 334 S.C. at 311, 513 S.E.2d at 610 (citing State v. Cole, 772 P.2d 531 (Wash. App. 1989)).Â  Our precedent does not necessarily require the existence of a policy, but does require â€œsome showing that the defendant would derive some benefit from the proceeds of the policyâ€ to be admissible.Â  State v. Vermillion, 271 S.C. 99, 100, 245 S.E.2d 128, 129 (1978); see, e.g., State v. Thomas, 159 S.C. 76, 80-81, 156 S.E. 169, 170-71 (1930) (applications for insurance on the life of a boy by his reputed father, which\r\nwere refused and on which no policies were issued, were held to be admissible as motive in the prosecution of the father for murdering the boy because they tended to show he tried to obtain an even greater amount of insurance on the life of the deceased than that which he actually procured).\r\nAt trial, defense counsel objected to Walkerâ€™s testimony as unfairly prejudicial under Rule 403, SCRE.Â  The trial court overruled the objection and allowed the testimony.Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Walkerâ€™s testimony.Â  The Court of Appeals discerned the testimony was not admissible because there was no policy from which Respondent could have received a benefit.Â  The Court of Appeals also found Respondent was prejudiced by the inference that she attempted to purchase life insurance on the victim without his knowledge.Â  Douglas, 359 S.C. at 197, 597 S.E.2d at 6.Â  \r\nRespondentâ€™s inquiry to Walker about life insurance on the victim had only slight probative value because Respondent never received a quote on the premiums, applied for, or purchased life insurance on the victim.Â  Without the existence of an application for a life insurance policy or the issuance of a policy, the evidence presented at trial does not show how Respondent would derive some benefit from the policyâ€™s proceeds.Â  Respondentâ€™s sole inquiry during a casual conversation does not establish motive, planning, or intent.Â  \r\nMoreover, the record reveals Walker did not inform Respondent she would be required to obtain the victimâ€™s permission to purchase the life insurance on him.Â  Walker testified generally that one spouse is required to obtain the other spouseâ€™s permission to be named as a beneficiary under a life insurance policy on the other spouseâ€™s life.Â  The prejudicial effect of this testimony was the inference that Respondent decided not to purchase the life insurance on the victim because she needed the victimâ€™s permission.Â  The slight probative value of Walkerâ€™s testimony did not substantially outweigh the unfair prejudice to Respondent, and the trial court abused its discretion by admitting the testimony.Â  \r\nII. Harmless Error\r\nThe State further contends if the trial court improperly admitted Walkerâ€™s testimony, the Court of Appeals erred in finding the error was not harmless.Â  We agree.\r\nGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  In determining whether an error is harmless, the reviewing court must review the entire record to determine what effect the error had on the verdict.Â  State v. Mizzell, 349 S.C. 326, 334, 563 S.E.2d 315, 319 (2002).Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â  Arnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989).\r\nThe police investigation revealed the town house had not been forcibly entered and Respondent was the only person, other than the victim, with a key to the house.Â  Respondent was the last person to see the victim alive and was the first person to discover he had been murdered.Â  Respondent told police she went to the river house on November 4 because she had plans to go hunting with the victim.Â  Yet, she told her boyfriend she planned to do yard work at the river house that day and did not intend to go into town.Â Â  Testimony at trial revealed the victim had plans to go to a car auction that morning.Â  Also, the evidence revealed Respondent was not known to hunt, and if the victim hunted, he went with his grandson; not Respondent.\r\nThe night of the victimâ€™s murder, he told Respondent he wanted a divorce.Â  Respondent told police that after returning from dinner with the victim, she did not leave the river house until the next morning when she left for breakfast.Â  However, Respondentâ€™s boyfriend told police she visited him in the early morning hours of November 4.Â  During this visit, Respondent told her boyfriend that the victim wanted a divorce and she was worried about her business if a divorce occurred.Â  Also, Respondent had previously told Creech she hated the victim and she would not divorce him because she did not want to lose her benefits.Â  \r\nRespondent regularly possessed the coupleâ€™s .25-caliber pistol, and the murder weapon was a .25-caliber pistol.Â  The murder weapon and the victimâ€™s wallet were found in the creek behind Respondentâ€™s river house. Respondentâ€™s clothing was found in the creek near the location of the murder weapon and the victimâ€™s wallet.Â  Further, two bullets fired into the victim originated from the same source or same melt of lead as several of the bullets found in the box of ammunition in Respondentâ€™s closet. Â Moreover, the admission of Respondentâ€™s inquiry about life insurance was an insubstantial error given that the State sought to establish motive through the proper admission of two life insurance policies and the victimâ€™s retirement benefits from which Respondent would benefit.Â  The trial courtâ€™s erroneous admission of Walkerâ€™s testimony did not contribute to the verdict obtained and was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that the trial court abused its discretion by admitting Walkerâ€™s testimony, but we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that this was reversible error.Â  The error was harmless and we uphold Respondentâ€™s convictions.Â  \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26168 ","title":"Jeter v.

S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 358 S.C. 528, 595 S.E.2d 827 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn July 12, 1997, Calvin Jeter was operating a motorcycle on Secondary Road 37, also known as Herbert Road, in Union County, and Phyllis Brown was driving a vehicle in the opposite direction.Â  SCDOT had recently resurfaced part of Herbert Road.Â  After entering upon a resurfaced portion of the road, Brown saw a deer on the roadside and applied the brakes.Â  She lost control of her vehicle and collided with Jeterâ€™s motorcycle.Â  Brown claimed excessive, loose gravel on the road caused her to lose control of the vehicle. \r\nJeter and his wife, Quantilla, each filed complaints in the Union County Court of Common Pleas against SCDOT under the South Carolina Tort Claims Act (SCTCA).[1]Â  The Jeters alleged SCDOT had failed to safely maintain the roadway and failed to warn drivers of its dangerous condition.Â  \r\nSCDOT filed third-party complaints against Brown, naming her as a third-party defendant.Â  SCDOT contended Brown was a necessary party to the litigation to permit apportionment of fault under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(c).[2]Â  Brown filed a counterclaim against SCDOT under the SCTCA for personal injuries she sustained from the accident.Â  \r\nAfter settling with the Jeters, Brown moved to dismiss the third-party complaints under Rule 12(b)(6), SCRCP.Â  The lower court ruled Brown was a necessary party to the action under Rule 19, SCRCP, and must remain a party to the action solely for the purposes of satisfying the statutory requirement of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(c).\r\nBrown then filed an amended answer and counterclaim, alleging venue in Union County was improper and that as a matter of right should be transferred to Fairfield County, her county of residence.Â  Brown subsequently filed a motion to change venue to Fairfield County.Â  The lower court granted Brownâ€™s motion, over SCDOTâ€™s objection, and transferred venue to Fairfield County.Â  The lower court subsequently denied SCDOTâ€™s motion to change venue back to Union County, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(b).Â  \r\nDuring the trial, the lower court ruled Brown was not negligent as a matter of law and granted a directed verdict for Brown on the issue of her negligence.Â  The lower court also granted Brownâ€™s motion for directed verdict on SCDOTâ€™s defense of unavoidable accident. Â The jury returned verdicts in favor of the Jeters and Brown.Â  \r\nSCDOT appealed to the Court of Appeals.Â  The Court of Appeals interpreted S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(b) to establish subject matter jurisdiction in the circuit court of South Carolina and venue in the county where the act or omission occurred.Â  The Court of Appeals found the lower court did not abuse its discretion by transferring venue to Fairfield County under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (2005).Â  The Court of Appeals further found the lower court erred in directing a verdict for Brown on the issue of her negligence because the SCTCA requires the jury to apportion fault among all potential tortfeasors.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the case.Â  Jeter, 358 S.C. at 532-36, 595 S.E.2d at 829-31.[3]\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in construing S.C. Code\r\n          Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(b)?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in finding the lower court did not\r\n          abuse its discretion by transferring venue to Fairfield County under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW \r\nMotions to change the venue of a trial are addressed to the sound discretion of the trial court.Â  Garrett v. Packet Motor Express Co., 263 S.C. 463, 210 S.E.2d 912 (1975).Â  This Court will not disturb the trial judgeâ€™s decision on appeal unless a manifest abuse of discretion is found resulting in an error of law.Â  Graham v. Beverly, 235 S.C. 222, 110 S.E.2d 923 (1959). Moreover, the error of law must be so opposed to the trial judgeâ€™s sound discretion as to amount to a deprivation of the legal rights of the party. Oâ€™Shields v. Caldwell, 208 S.C. 245, 37 S.E.2d 665 (1946).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Construction of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-78-100(b)\r\nSCDOT argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding Â§ 15-78-100(b) is not a statutory provision solely setting forth subject matter jurisdiction.Â  SCDOT argues this statutory provision provides that only the circuit court in the county where the act or omission occurred has subject matter jurisdiction over an action brought pursuant to the SCTCA.Â  Accordingly, the only court having subject matter jurisdiction over this particular case is the Union County Court of Common Pleas.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe issue of interpretation of a statute is a question of law for the court.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Rec. Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 459 S.E.2d 841 (1995) (holding the determination of legislative intent is a matter of law).Â  This Court is free to decide questions of law with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Moriarty v. Garden Sanctuary Church of God, 341 S.C. 320, 534 S.E.2d 672 (2000).\r\nThe Court of Appeals held Â§ 15-78-100(b) addressed subject matter jurisdiction to the extent that such jurisdiction was conferred in the circuit court.Â  The Court of Appeals further held the statutory provision established venue in the county in which the act or omission occurred.Â  Jeter, 358 S.C. at 532-33, 595 S.E.2d at 829-30.Â  Â \r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is the power to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in question belong.Â  Venue is the place or geographical location of trial.Â  The propriety of either is independent of the other. Â Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 236, 442 S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994); State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe South Carolina Constitution in Article V, Â§ 11, states, â€œThe Circuit Court shall be a general trial court with original jurisdiction in civil and criminal cases, except those cases in which exclusive jurisdiction shall be given to inferior courts, and shall have such appellate jurisdiction as provided by law.â€[4]Â  Section 15-78-100(b) states, â€œJurisdiction for any action brought under this chapter is in the circuit court and brought in the county in which the act or omission occurred.â€\r\nIn Dove, Dove appealed a workerâ€™s compensation claim to the circuit court, which dismissed his appeal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction.Â  On appeal, the Court construed S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-17-60 (Supp. 1993), which\r\nprovided in relevant part: â€œ[E]ither party . . . may appeal from the decision of the commission to the court of common pleas of the county in which the alleged accident happened, or in which the employer resides or has his principal office.â€Â  Dove, 314 S.C. at 238, 442 S.E.2d at 600.Â  The Court discerned, â€œThere is but one Circuit Court in South Carolina, with uniform subject matter jurisdiction â€˜throughout the State.â€™â€Â  Id. (citing State ex rel. Riley v. Martin, 274 S.C. 106, 111, 262 S.E.2d 404, 406 (1980); S.C. Const. art. V, Â§ 1) (emphasis in original).Â  Then, the Court construed the statutory provision as granting subject matter jurisdiction to the court of common pleas throughout the state and as designating venue in the county in which the alleged accident happened or in which the employer resides or has his principal office.Â  Id. at 239, 442 S.E.2d at 600. \r\nIn Harrison v. S.C. Tax Commâ€™n, 261 S.C. 302, 199 S.E.2d 763 (1973), overruled on other grounds by McCall by Andrews v. Batson, 285 S.C. 243, 329 S.E.2d 741 (1985), superseded by statute, the Court considered whether S.C. Code Â§ 10-2605 (1962),[5] was intended to confer subject matter jurisdiction or was a venue provision.Â  Former section 10-2605 provided in pertinent part: â€œThe circuit courts of this State are hereby vested with jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions, actions and controversies, . . . affecting boards, commissions and agencies of this State, and officials of the State in their official capacities [i]n the circuit where such question, action or controversy shall arise.â€ Â Harrison, 261 S.C. at 305, 199 S.E.2d at 764 (emphasis in original).Â  The Court found because the South Carolina Constitution granted subject matter jurisdiction to the court of common pleas in all civil cases, â€œthe [statute] could not have been intended to confer jurisdiction on it of this class of actions in the strict sense of that term.Â  The intent of the legislature must have been to fix the venue of such actions â€˜in the circuit where such question, action or controversy shall arise. . . .â€™ â€ Id. at 306, 199 S.E.2d at 764.\r\nSection 15-78-100(b) is similar to Â§ 42-17-60 and former Â§ 10-2605 in that the statutory provision references subject matter jurisdiction and venue in one sentence.Â  Because there is but one circuit court in South Carolina, with uniform subject matter jurisdiction throughout the state, Â§ 15-78-100(b) establishes subject matter jurisdiction for actions arising under the SCTCA in the circuit court throughout the state.Â  See Dove, 314 S.C. at 238, 442 S.E.2d at 600; Riley, 274 S.C. at 111, 262 S.E.2d at 406.Â  Section 15-78-100(b) also establishes venue â€œin the county in which the act or omission occurred.â€Â  See also Ellis by Ellis v. Oliver, 307 S.C. 365, 367, 415 S.E.2d 400, 401 (1992) (â€œUnder the SCTCA, venue is proper where the act or omission occurred.â€). \r\nII. Transfer of venue pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30\r\nSCDOT argues if Â§ 15-78-100(b) establishes venue in the county in which the act or omission occurred, then the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the lower courtâ€™s transfer of venue under Â§ 15-7-30 when the original venue was proper under Â§ 15-78-100(b). Â We agree.[6]\r\nUpon Brownâ€™s motion, the lower court transferred venue to Fairfield County as a matter of right, citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30;[7] McKissick v. J.F. Cleckley &amp; Co., 325 S.C. 327, 479 S.E.2d 67 (Ct. App. 1996); and Ellis, 307 S.C. at 365, 415 S.E.2d at 400.[8]Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals found that Â§ 15-78-100(b) did not prevent the lower court from considering Brownâ€™s motion to transfer venue pursuant to Â§ 15-7-30.Â  The Court of Appeals further found the lower court did not abuse its discretion by transferring venue to Brownâ€™s county of residence.Â  Jeter, 358 S.C. at 533, 595 S.E.2d at 829-30.Â  \r\nThe defendant has a substantial right to be tried in the county of his residence pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-7-30 (2005).Â  Thus, in a case involving only one defendant or multiple defendants who reside in a single county, the venue choice generally is controlled by the residence of the defendant.Â  Carroll, 302 S.C. at 177, 394 S.E.2d at 708.Â  However, where there are multiple defendants residing in different counties, the plaintiff may properly bring the action in the county where any one of the defendants resides at the time of the commencement of the action.Â  Â In such a case, the plaintiff ordinarily has the right of election as to the county in which an action will be brought.Â  Mack v. Nationwide Mut. Ins. Co., 245 S.C. 619, 623-24, 142 S.E.2d 50, 53 (1965); Rankin Lumber Co. v. Graveley, 112 S.C. 128, 99 S.E. 349 (1919).Â  \r\nâ€œWhere an action is properly commenced in any one of two or more venues and is properly brought in one of such venues, it is removable to the other proper venue only if there exists some statutory ground for removal other than the bringing of suit in the wrong venue.â€ Â 92A C.J.S. Venue Â§ 157 (2000); see also 77 Am.Jur.2d Venue Â§ 67 (1997); Slattery v. Iowa Dist. Ct. for Johnson County, 442 N.W.2d 82 (Iowa 1989); Kahn v. Gill Hills Co., 610 So.2d 1374 (Fla. App. 1992).Â  â€œThe general rule is that where an action is properly instituted in a county other than that of the defendantâ€™s residence, a defendant has no right to request a change of venue to the county of his or her residence on the ground that the action was not brought in a proper county, even if the action could also have been commenced in the county where the defendant resides.â€ Â 92A C.J.S. Venue Â§ 163; see also Tribolet v. Fowler, 266 P.2d 1088 (Ariz. 1954).\r\nWe find the reasoning of the Court of Appeals erroneous.Â  The Jeters properly instituted their actions against SCDOT by filing their actions in the Union County Court of Common Pleas pursuant to Â§ 15-78-100(b).Â  Because the actions were properly instituted, Brown, as a defendant, had no right to request a change of venue to the county of her residence based on an allegation that the actions were brought in an improper venue.[9] Â Thus, the lower court abused its discretion by transferring venue to Brownâ€™s county of residence pursuant to Â§ 15-7-30. Â Â Â  Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that Â§ 15-78-100(b) establishes subject matter jurisdiction in the circuit court of South Carolina and venue in the county where the act or omission occurred.Â  We find the lower court abused its discretion by transferring venue under Â§ 15-7-30 and reverse that part of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  Further, we find it unnecessary to address SCDOTâ€™s remaining arguments and issue on appeal related to venue.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, 311 S.C. 335, 340, 428 S.E.2d 886, 889 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when resolution of prior issues is\r\ndispositive). \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Seabrook and Folly North Partners (collectively Respondents) as guaranteed by the United States Constitution.Â  This case was certified from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nThis suit is based on the conduct of the City of Folly Beach, the Folly Beach City Council (City Council), and Folly Beachâ€™s local zoning authorities concerning a parcel of property owned by Seabrook.Â  In 1996, Seabrook sold Folly North Partners (Folly North) an option to buy an undeveloped tract of land on the east end of Folly Island.Â  The option was contingent on the property being zoned for residential use because Folly North hoped to develop the property into oceanfront lots.Â  \r\nImmediately, problems arose regarding the propertyâ€™s zoning.Â  Because the Seabrook property was located at the east end of the island, it bordered only a former United States Coast Guard Base and the water.Â  Most likely, the propertyâ€™s location led to the current confusion and dispute, since it appears most people mistakenly believed the Coast Guard owned the entire east end of the island.Â  The zoning problems immediately arose because the official map accompanying the last zoning ordinance, passed in 1993, stopped at the beginning of the Coast Guard Base and illustrated that all land beyond the baseâ€™s boundary was zoned N-1 (nature conservancy).Â  \r\nThis ambiguity came to light when L. Russell Bennett, the principal owner of Folly North, began discussing his plans to develop a residential subdivision on the property.Â  Bennett testified he â€œreserved his rightsâ€ as to the then existing zoning, and took the matter to the City Council. \r\nBennett first appeared before the City Council in May of 1996, at which time he presented an ordinance to rezone the Seabrook property from N-1 to R-1 (residential). Â The City Council passed the rezoning ordinance on first reading, but on the second reading, the ordinance failed.Â  Later, the City held a citywide referendum, pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-17-10 (2004), to rezone the Seabrook property from N-1 to R-1.Â  The referendum failed as well.Â  \r\nIn November of 1996, Bennett submitted a preliminary plat for subdivision of the Seabrook property to the city building official, Tom Hall.Â  By letter, Hall refused to accept the plat because the Seabrook property was zoned N-1.Â  Bennett appealed to the zoning board, arguing the Seabrook property was never zoned N-1 because it did not appear on the 1993 zoning map.Â  The zoning board upheld the building officialâ€™s determination.Â  Bennett appealed the zoning boardâ€™s decision to circuit court.\r\nThe circuit court reversed the zoning boardâ€™s decision.Â  The circuit court based this decision on a 1979 zoning map showing the Seabrook property as zoned R-2 (moderate density residential district).Â  The circuit court concluded that because the 1993 ordinance map did not â€œshow, delineate, describe or otherwise referenceâ€ the Seabrook property, and because neither the planning commission nor the City Council could demonstrate they intended to rezone the property in 1993, the Seabrook property retained its residential zoning classification and was never rezoned to N-1.Â  After the trial courtâ€™s decision, Bennett resubmitted his plat application which was eventually approved. [1]\r\nRespondents filed the instant action in the court of common pleas. Respondents alleged depravations of procedural and substantive due process, a violation of equal protection, gross negligence, and a temporary taking.Â  Prior to trial, all defendants except the City were dismissed, and all causes of action except due process and equal protection were abandoned.Â  Specifically, Respondents alleged: (1) that the City deprived Respondents of their â€œvested interestâ€ in having their plat approved by improperly developing an â€œofficial policyâ€ that the Seabrook property should be zoned N-1, and (2) that Respondents were members of a class of owners of property zoned R-1, but were arbitrarily treated different from all other members of the class.Â  \r\nThe trial court found the City violated Respondentsâ€™ rights to due process and equal protection.Â  The trial court found the City Council usurped the building officialâ€™s authority to enforce the zoning ordinance by adopting an â€œofficial policyâ€ that the Seabrook property was zoned N-1.Â  The trial court found this was a deprivation of due process because it obstructed the building officialâ€™s ability to offer an unbiased opinion as to the propertyâ€™s zoning and deprived Respondents of the right to have their subdivision plat processed.Â  As to equal protection, the trial court found Respondentsâ€™ rights were violated when the City Council zoned Respondentsâ€™ property without following the legislative process.Â  \r\nThis case was certified to this Court from the court of appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and the City raises the following issue for review:\r\n\r\nDid the City deny Respondentsâ€™ rights to due process and equal protection as guaranteed by the United States Constitution?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn an action at law, on appeal of a case tried without a jury, the trial judgeâ€™s factual findings will not be disturbed on appeal unless they are not reasonably supported by the evidence.Â  Townes Associates, Ltd. v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81, 86, 221 S.E.2d 773, 774 (1976). \r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Due Process\r\n\r\n\r\nIn its decision finding a due process violation, the trial court made no distinction between substantive and procedural due process.Â  Because\r\n&nbsp;the City divides its argument between substantive due process and procedural due process, we address the issues in a similar manner.\r\nA. Procedural Due Process\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€œProcedural due process imposes constraints on governmental decisions which deprive individuals of â€˜libertyâ€™ or â€˜propertyâ€™ interests within the meaning of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth or Fourteenth Amendment.â€Â  Matthews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 332 (1976). Â In this case, Respondents allege they possessed a vested property interest in having their plat application approved and in the immediate use of their property for development of a subdivision.Â  We dismiss this claim as moot.Â  Â Â Â \r\nA moot case exists where a judgment rendered by the court will have no practical legal effect upon an existing controversy because an intervening event renders any grant of effectual relief impossible for the reviewing court.Â  Mathis v. S. C. State Highway Depâ€™t, 260 S.C. 344, 346, 195 S.E.2d 713, 715 (1973).Â  Â If there is no actual controversy, this Court will not decide moot or academic questions.Â  Id. (citing Jones v. Dillon-Marion Human Res. Dev. Commâ€™n., 277 S.C. 533, 535, 291 S.E.2d 195, 196 (1982)).Â  \r\nTwo factors compel our finding Respondentsâ€™ procedural due process claim is moot.Â  First, this is not an appropriate case to award money damages under the guise of a procedural due process violation.Â  A violation of a plaintiffâ€™s procedural due process rights is typically remedied by either injunctive relief or a court order instructing that the plaintiff be afforded the process he was denied.Â  In this case, since Respondents seek relief in the form of money damages, ruling on a procedural due process claim would have no practical effect whatsoever.\r\nSecond, because the Seabrook property was rezoned and because Respondentsâ€™ plat was approved, Respondents have already received the appropriate procedural relief.Â  Respondents claim the City Council developed an â€œofficial policyâ€ that the Seabrook property would be zoned N-1, thereby depriving Respondents of the process set out in the Cityâ€™s ordinances for determining zoning disputes.Â  As a result, Respondentsâ€™ claim they were prevented from having their subdivision plat approved.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nRespondentsâ€™ position is best stated as claiming not that they were deprived of the process set by the law, but that the process set out in the law was tainted by City Councilâ€™s â€œofficial position.â€Â  The claim that the process was â€œtaintedâ€ is more akin to a substantive due process claim because at no time were Respondents prevented from going through the dispute resolution procedure. Â In fact, it was in the final stage of this procedure, appeal in the circuit court, that Respondents won their desired result. Â Since Respondentsâ€™ plat was approved, thereby purging any continuing â€œtaintâ€ in the process, any judgment on the issue of procedural due process would be a speculative and academic exercise.Â  For this reason, we reverse the trial court and find Respondentsâ€™ procedural due process claim is moot.Â  \r\nB. Substantive Due Process\r\nSubstantive due process protects a person from being deprived of life, liberty, or property for arbitrary reasons.Â  Worsley Companies, Inc. v. Town of Mount Pleasant, 339 S.C. 51, 56, 528 S.E.2d 657, 660 (2000).Â  To establish a substantive due process claim, a plaintiff must show he possessed a constitutionally protected property interest that was deprived by state action so far beyond the limits of legitimate governmental action, no process could cure the deficiency.Â  Sylvia Dev. Corp. v. Calvert County, 48 F.3d 810, 827 (4th Cir. 1998).Â  \r\nThe trial court found the Cityâ€™s actions were an unprecedented and arbitrary interference with the process of resolving zoning disputes and Respondentsâ€™ right to have their subdivision plat processed.Â  We find Respondentsâ€™ substantive due process claim is barred by a previously executed waiver.\r\nAfter the original trial court determined the Seabrook property was zoned for residential use, Bennett asked the zoning official to approve his plat.Â  After some delay in assembling the proper documents,[2] the plat was approved, but with several â€œconditions.â€Â  Specifically, the plat approval contained three limitations and contingencies regarding erosion on the coastline of the property.Â  Respondents sued the City in an attempt to have these conditions removed, and Respondents were granted summary judgment.Â  The City appealed.\r\nWhile the case was pending in this Court, the parties settled the lawsuit.Â  The release executed in the settlement discharged the City from:\r\n\r\nany and all known or unknown injuries, damages, loss of services, loss of profits, loss of income, expenses, compensation, rights, suits of whatever kind and natureâ€¦on account of, arising out of or in any way growing out of, the subdivision of the tract of property on the north end of Folly Beach commonly referred to as â€œThe Seabrook Tract,â€ . . . .\r\n\r\n(emphasis added).\r\nIn the instant lawsuit, Respondentsâ€™ complaint alleges they had a â€œvested property interestâ€ in having their plat approved and â€œto the immediate use of their property for the development of a nine (9) lot residential subdivision.â€Â  Because Respondentsâ€™ due process claims are based upon the Cityâ€™s refusal to immediately approve Respondentsâ€™ plat for subdivision, the previously signed release is directly implicated.Â  \r\nIn ruling the earlier release did not apply, the trial court incorrectly reasoned that the release applied only to the case at that time pending in this Court.Â  The language of the release clearly indicates it applies more broadly. Â Specifically, the release applies to all claims â€œon account of, arising out of or in any way growing out of, the subdivision of the tract of property.â€Â  The release does provide that these circumstances are â€œmore fully delineatedâ€ in the case at that time pending before this Court; however, the trial court improperly distinguished the instant case by stating â€œ[t]he case now before the court is not based on the actions of City officials in refusing to subdivide the Seabrook Tract, rather, it is based on the actions of City officials in adopting and implementing a policy establishing zoning outside the process set by law.â€ Â (emphasis in original). \r\nThis purported distinction ignores the plain language of Respondentsâ€™ complaint.Â  The complaint expressly rests the due process claims on the obstruction of Respondentsâ€™ right to subdivide the Seabrook tract.Â  For these reasons, we reverse the trial court and find Respondentsâ€™ substantive due process claim is waived.\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Equal Protection\r\nTo establish an equal protection violation, plaintiffs must demonstrate they were intentionally and purposely subjected to treatment different from others similarly situated.Â  Sylvia Dev. Corp., 48 F.3d at 818.Â  The trial court found the City treated Respondents differently from similarly situated property owners and that the City imposed a zoning designation on Respondentsâ€™ property outside the legislative process.Â  We dismiss this claim as moot.Â  \r\nA case becomes moot when the parties no longer possess a cognizable interest in the outcome.Â  Powell v. McCormack, 395 U.S. 486, 496 (1969).Â  The record indicates that the Seabrook property was rezoned after a slight delay in the process, and that Respondents ultimately sold the property for a sum comparable with the value of residential oceanfront property.Â  As Respondents no longer possess any claim to the property, were not delayed significantly in this process, and realized such substantial financial gains, any claim to an equal protection violation is far too tenuous for adjudication.Â  \r\nThat we dispose of this case on somewhat technical grounds should not be perceived as a license for a city or municipal authority to use last-minute rezoning to cure violations of a property ownerâ€™s rights in hopes of seeking shelter in the principles of justiciability.Â  When established zoning statutes and procedures are arbitrarily or unreasonably disregarded, several constitutional claims may arise.Â  In this case, however, any judgment of this Court on equal protection grounds would clearly lack a practical effect.Â Â  Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nThe trial court erred in finding violations of Respondentsâ€™ due process and equal protection rights.Â  We are extremely mindful of the often contentious nature of zoning and development disputes, and we recognize that, in the appropriate cases, improper actions of local administrative bodies may result in federal due process and equal protection violations.Â  \r\nUltimately, our conclusion in this case is compelled by two factors:Â  first, the fact that Respondents achieved a beneficial result after proceeding through the very process the law guaranteed; second, the fact that much of this subject matter was waived in the disposition of a previous lawsuit.\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse.\r\n MOORE, and BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice Clyde N. Davis, concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n[1]Although their plat was approved, Respondents never actually developed the Seabrook property.Â  In fact, after executing its option and purchasing the property for $500,000.00, Folly North sold the property to the Charleston County Parks and Recreation Commission for $3,956,524.01.Â  Folly North also obtained a $2,200,000.00 tax credit to defer tax on the capital gains realized by the sale.Â  \r\n[2] This delay was initially attributable to a dispute about whether the City was in possession of a valid plat application and whether Respondents needed to re-submit the plat application.Â  Once this issue was resolved, concern on the City Council about conditioning the platâ€™s approval on the satisfaction of several measures aimed at erosion control delayed the process further.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26170 ","title":"Boyd v.

App. 2004).Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nIn 1923, BellSouthâ€™s predecessor, AT&amp;T, completed construction of a three-story building on its property in Denmark, South Carolina.Â  BellSouthâ€™s original lot was bordered on the north by Otis Street (formerly Hammond Street), on the west by Carolina Highway (formerly Palmetto Avenue), and on the east by Beech Avenue.Â  At some point during BellSouthâ€™s ownership, a driveway was constructed which ran from the rear of the building to Beech Avenue.Â  A gate was erected at the end of the driveway on Beech Avenue.\r\nIn 1988, BellSouth severed the lot into two parcels and sold the western parcel with the building to the City of Denmark (Denmark).Â  Denmarkâ€™s parcel was bordered by Otis Street and Carolina Highway.Â Â  In 1991, Denmark sold its parcel to John Boyd, who later conveyed the parcel to his wife, Caroline Boyd.Â  Boyd used the building as an antique store.Â  \r\nDenmark and Boyd used BellSouthâ€™s gate and driveway to access the rear entrance of the building.Â  After September 11, 2001, BellSouth decided to construct a fence between the two parcels for security reasons.Â  This fence would prohibit Boyd from using BellSouthâ€™s existing gate and driveway to access the rear entrance of the building. Â Â Â  \r\nBoyd then brought this declaratory judgment action contending she had an easement implied by prior use,[1] implied by necessity, or by equitable estoppel over BellSouthâ€™s parcel.Â  The special referee granted BellSouthâ€™s motion for summary judgment on all claims.\r\nBoyd appealed.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed the special refereeâ€™s grant of summary judgment for BellSouth on the easement by necessity claim and reversed the grant of summary judgment for BellSouth on the claims for an easement implied by prior use and by equitable estoppel.Â  Id. at 213-17, 597 S.E.2d at 163-65.Â  Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe granted BellSouthâ€™s petition for writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision concerning the easement implied by prior use and equitable estoppel.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        &nbsp;I.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the special refereeâ€™s grant of summary judgment for BellSouth on the easement implied by prior use claim?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.Â \r\n         Did the Court of Appeals err in reversing the special refereeâ€™s grant of summary judgment for BellSouth on the easement by equitable estoppel claim?Â \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn reviewing the grant of a summary judgment motion, the appellate court applies the same standard that governs the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Under Rule 56, SCRCP, a party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law if the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact.&nbsp; In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all the inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 493-94, 567 S.E.2d 857, 860 (2002); Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 462, 560 S.E.2d 606, 610 (2002). \r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nI.Â  Easement Implied by Prior Use\r\nBellSouth argues the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the grant of summary judgment on the easement implied by prior use claim because South Carolina does not recognize this type of easement.Â  If early case law recognized the claim, then BellSouth contends it has only been recognized in the context of water drainage easements and has been subsumed by the development of easements by necessity and by prescription. Â Further, if an easement implied by prior use is currently recognized, then the Court of Appeals erred in finding a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the necessity element. \r\nThe special referee recognized a claim for easement implied by prior use, but found Boyd did not produce any evidence BellSouth intended to create an easement at the time of severance. Â He also found Boyd did not meet the element of necessity.Â  Based on those findings, the special referee granted summary judgment for BellSouth.\r\nThe Court of Appeals held an easement implied by prior use exists when: (1) the dominant and servient tracts of land originated from a common owner; (2) the use was in existence at the time the original grantor severed the tracts; and (3) the use was apparent, continuous, and necessary for enjoyment of the dominant tract.Â  Boyd, 359 S.C. at 214, 597 S.E.2d at 164 (citing Crosland v. Rogers, 32 S.C. 130, 133, 10 S.E. 874, 875 (1890) and Slater v. Price, 96 S.C. 245, 255-56, 80 S.E. 372, 374 (1913)).Â  Further, the evidence showed BellSouth was the common owner of both parcels and continuously used the apparent driveway during the time of common ownership.Â  The Court of Appeals concluded a factual issue existed as to whether the driveway is reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of Boydâ€™s property and remanded the case.Â  Boyd, 359 S.C. at 215-16, 597 S.E.2d at 164-65.\r\nA.Â  Recognition of Claim\r\nWhile other authorities plainly identify easements by prior use, necessity, and prescription as three types of easements, South Carolina case law has not clearly distinguished between these types of easements. Â See 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§Â§ 22, 30, 39 (generally describing easements by prior use, necessity, and prescription).Â  Moreover, although easements by implication have been recognized in South Carolina, an easement implied by prior use has never been explicitly recognized.Â  \r\nThe intent of the parties, as shown by all the facts and circumstances under which a conveyance was made, may give rise to an easement by implication.Â  Hamilton v. CCM, Inc., 274 S.C. 152, 158, 263 S.E.2d 378, 381 (1980).Â  Whatever easements are created by implication must be determined as of the time of the severance of the ownership of the tracts involved.Â  Clemson Univ. v. First Provident Corp., 260 S.C. 640, 652, 197 S.E.2d 914, 920 (1973). Â Easements may be implied by necessity, by prior use, from map or boundary references, or from a general plan.Â  25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§Â§ 20-22, 30 (describing the different types of implied easements); Restatement (Third) Property: Servitudes Â§Â§ 2.11-.15 (2000 &amp; Supp. 2006) (same); see, e.g., Carolina Land Co. v. Bland, 265 S.C. 98, 217 S.E.2d 16 (1975) (when a grantor lays out a tract of land in streets and lots on a plat and sells those lots by deeds referring to the plat, normally the legal effect is the creation and conveyance of implied easements in the streets to the grantees); McAllister v. Smiley, 301 S.C. 10, 389 S.E.2d 857 (1990) (easement implied where the deed described the tract of land as bounded by a street and the deed referred to the plat on which the street was indicated but the deed did not mention an easement); Brasington v. Williams, 143 S.C. 223, 141 S.E. 375 (1927) (easement implied by necessity where the grantee was without an express easement or right of way to a public highway); see generally Brasington, 143 S.C. at 245, 141 S.E. at 382 (â€œThere seems to have been nine methods recognized under the common law for the creation of an easement, namely, by grant, estoppel, way of a necessity, implication, dedication, prescription, ancient window doctrine, reservation, or condemnation.â€) (citing Davis v. Robinson, 127 S.E. 697 (1925)).Â  Â \r\nThe party asserting the right to an easement implied by prior use must establish the following: (1) unity of title; (2) severance of title; (2) the prior use was in existence at the time of unity of title; (3) the prior use was not merely temporary or casual; (4) the prior use was apparent or known to the parties; (5) the prior use was necessary in that there could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without the prior use; and (6) the common grantor indicated an intent to continue the prior use after severance of title. Â See Elliott v. Rhett, 39 S.C.L. (5 Rich.) 405 (1852) (â€œApart from all considerations of time, there is implied, upon the severance of a heritage, a grant of all those continuous and apparent easements, which\r\nhave in fact been used by the owner during the unity, though they have had no legal existence as easements. . . .â€);[2] Crosland, 32 S.C. at 133, 10 S.E. at 875 (implicitly recognizing an easement implied by prior use â€œwhere there has been a unity of possession and a subsequent sale of a portion of the land over which the easement is claimed, that said easement must have been apparent, continuous, and necessary at the time of said sale, the term â€˜necessaryâ€™ meaning that there could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without this easementâ€);[3] see also Merrimon v. McCain, 201 S.C. 76, 82, 21 S.E.2d 404, 407 (1942), overruled on other grounds by Jowers v. Hornsby, 292 S.C. 549, 551-52, 357 S.E.2d 710, 711 (1987) (plaintiff sought an easement based on three grounds: (1) the easement was visible, apparent, and appurtenant to the property, (2) the easement was implied by necessity, and (3) easement by prescription).[4]\r\nThe party asserting the right of an easement by necessity must demonstrate: (1) unity of title, (2) severance of title, and (3) necessity.Â  Kennedy v. Bedenbaugh, 352 S.C. 56, 60, 572 S.E.2d 452, 454 (2002). Â Â Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTo establish a prescriptive easement, the party asserting the right must show: (1) continued use for 20 years, (2) the identity of the thing enjoyed, and (3) use which is either adverse or under a claim of right.Â  Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 367, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993); Shia v. Pendergrass, 222 S.C. 342, 351, 72 S.E.2d 699, 703 (1952).Â  When the claimant has established that the use was open, notorious, continuous, and uninterrupted, the use will be presumed to have been adverse.Â  Poole v. Edwards, 197 S.C. 280, 283, 15 S.E.2d 349, 350 (1941).Â  \r\nA prescriptive easement is not implied by law but is established by the conduct of the dominant tenement owner; however, easements by prior use and by necessity are implied by law.Â  Clemson Univ., 260 S.C. at 652, 197 S.E.2d at 919; 12 S.C. Jur. Easements Â§ 10; 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§Â§ 22, 30.Â  An easement by necessity does not require a preexisting use during unity of title; whereas an easement by prior use does impose this requirement.Â  25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 32; 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 92.Â  An easement implied by prior use will not be extinguished if the easement is no longer necessary, but an easement by necessity will be extinguished once the necessity ends.Â  25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§Â§ 29, 35. \r\nEasements by prescription, implied by prior use, and implied by necessity have different elements and are applicable to different factual scenarios; thus, an easement implied by prior use has not been subsumed by other types of easements.Â  Regardless of whether an easement implied by prior use was originally recognized in a water drainage situation, this does not prevent its application in other circumstances.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nB.Â  Summary Judgment\r\nIf an easement implied by prior use is recognized, BellSouth contends the Court of Appeals erred in finding a genuine issue of material fact existed as to the necessity element of easement implied by prior use because the court simultaneously found Boyd did not meet the necessity element of easement by necessity.Â  \r\nThe necessity required for easement by necessity must be actual, real, and reasonable as distinguished from convenient, but need not be absolute and irresistible.Â  Jowers, 292 S.C. at 550-51, 357 S.E.2d at 711 (citing Steele v. Williams, 204 S.C. 124, 28 S.E.2d 644 (1944); Merrimon, 201 S.C. at 76, 21 S.E.2d at 404; Lawton v. Rivers, 13 S.C.L. (2 McCord) 445 (1823)).Â  The necessity element of easement by necessity must exist at the time of the severance and the party claiming the right to an easement must not create the necessity when it would not otherwise exist.Â  Clemson Univ., 260 S.C. at 652, 197 S.E.2d at 920; see also 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 96 (necessity required for easement by necessity must exist at the time of the severance and at the time of the exercise of the easement).\r\nFor an easement implied by prior use, necessity means â€œthere could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement without this easement. . . .â€Â  Crosland, 32 S.C. at 133, 10 S.E. at 875; see also 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 29 (necessity for easement implied by prior use generally means reasonable necessity which will contribute to enjoyment of the dominant estate); 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 72 (implied grant of easement by prior use requires a reasonable degree of necessity for the enjoyment of the dominant estate; it need not be absolute but must be more than mere convenience).Â  The necessity element of easement implied by prior use must be determined at the time of the severance.Â  25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 29; 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 69; see, e.g., Norken Corp. v. McGahan, 823 P.2d 622 (Alaska 1991) (remanding case for determination of whether necessity element for easement implied by prior use met at the time of severance).Â  Â \r\nWhile the necessity elements for the two types of easements obviously are similar, the need required for an easement by prior use may be less than required for an easement by necessity.Â  See Russakoff v. Scruggs, 400 S.E.2d 529, 533 (Va. 1991) (easement implied by prior use â€œrequires a showing of need which, by definition, may be less than that required for establishing an easement by necessity, but must be something more than simple convenienceâ€); Granite Props. Ltd. v. Manns, 487 N.E.2d 1230 (Ill. App. Ct. 1986) (a greater degree of necessity may be required for easement by necessity than for easement by prior use); 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 92 (same).Â  This lesser showing of necessity may stem in part from an often unspoken realization on the part of the fact finder that a prior use indicates a need for a particular easement.Â  See Michael V. Hernandez, Restating Implied, Prescriptive, and Statutory Easements, 40 Real Prop. Prob. &amp; Tr. J. 75 (2005) (â€œThe easement implied by prior use is based on the maxim . . . whatever is necessary and related is appended. . . .â€).Â Â  Â Â Â Â Â \r\nViewed in the light most favorable to Boyd, the evidence indicates BellSouth at one time commonly owned the two parcels at issue and used the driveway to access the rear entrance of the building.Â  Upon severance of the two parcels, Boydâ€™s parcel, then owned by Denmark, was bounded on two sides by public streets.Â  The evidence indicates there are two entrances to Boydâ€™s building.Â  During the past 50 years, the rear entrance and loading docks have been generally accessible from Beech Avenue by using BellSouthâ€™s driveway and have been used to deliver large items to the basement of the building.Â  There is evidence the front entrance does not provide access to the basement for the delivery of large items because the stairways and hallways are too narrow.Â  The evidence also indicates an alternate driveway to the building would be infeasible, impractical, and very costly.Â  Thus, there is a genuine issue of material fact that without this particular easement, there could be no other reasonable mode of enjoying the dominant tenement at the time of severance.Â  Crosland, 32 S.C. at 133, 10 S.E. at 875.\r\nII.Â  Easement by Equitable Estoppel\r\nBellSouth argues the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the grant of summary judgment on the claim for easement by estoppel because\r\nBoyd failed to establish the elements of equitable estoppel. Â We agree.\r\nThe essential elements of equitable estoppel as related to the party\r\nestopped are: (1) conduct which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts, or, at least, which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than, and inconsistent with, those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) intention, or at least expectation, that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; and (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the real facts.Â  As related to the party claiming the estoppel, they are: (1) lack of knowledge and of the means of knowledge of the truth as to the facts in question; (2) reliance upon the conduct of the party estopped; and (3) action based thereon of such a character as to change his position prejudicially. Â S. Dev. Land and Golf Co. v. S.C. Pub. Serv. Auth., 311 S.C. 29, 33, 426 S.E.2d 748, 750 (1993); see, e.g., Oâ€™Cain v. Oâ€™Cain, 322 S.C. 551, 473 S.E.2d 460 (Ct. App. 1996) (landowner was equitably estopped from denying adjoining landowner use of driveway).Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nâ€œA properly recorded title normally precludes an equitable estoppel against assertion of that title due to the requirement that the party raising the estoppel be ignorant of the true state of title or reasonable means of discovering it.â€Â  Binkley v. Rabon Creek Watershed Conservation Dist. of Fountain Inn, 348 S.C. 58, 71, 558 S.E.2d 902, 909 (Ct. App. 2001) (internal citation omitted).Â  â€œOne with knowledge of the truth or the means by which with reasonable diligence he could acquire knowledge cannot claim to have been misled.â€Â  S. Dev. Land and Golf Co., 311 S.C. at 34, 426 S.E.2d at 751. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe special referee determined Boyd did not establish that she and her predecessors lacked knowledge because the chain of title revealed there was no such easement.Â  Therefore, the special referee concluded Boyd and her predecessors could not have been misled by any representations BellSouth made regarding the use of the driveway and granted summary judgment for BellSouth.Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in a light most favorable to Boyd, the Court of Appeals found the evidence indicated when Boydâ€™s husband made the decision to purchase the property, he relied on a representation by BellSouth that he would have access to the driveway.Â  The Court of Appeals also found Boydâ€™s husband was acting as a joint venturer with her in the antique store during the negotiations and purchase, and concluded summary judgment was improperly granted.Â  Boyd, 359 S.C. at 216, 597 S.E.2d at 165.Â Â  \r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Boyd, Boyd assumed she would always have access to the rear of the building via BellSouthâ€™s driveway.Â  The fact that there was not an easement allowing Boyd to cross BellSouthâ€™s property was a matter of public record, which Boyd and her predecessors in title had knowledge of or at least the means to obtain the knowledge.Â  Carolina Land Co., 265 S.C. at 107, 217 S.E.2d at 20 (â€œLaw imputes to purchaser who proposes to acquire title to real estate notice of recitals contained in any properly recorded instrument in writing which forms link in chain of title to property proposed to be acquired.â€).Â  Boyd failed to show the elements of estoppel and summary judgment was properly granted to BellSouth on this claim.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of the grant of summary judgment on the easement implied by prior use and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.Â  We reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of the grant of summary judgment on the easement by equitable\r\nestoppel. \r\n AFFIRMED IN PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Â  Easements implied by prior use are also referred to as easements implied by preexisting use.Â  See 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§Â§ 22-29 (2004).\r\n[2] Â  This quote exemplifies how the language used to describe easements implied by prior use and by necessity blurred the distinctions between the two types of easements.Â  In Brasington, the plaintiff sought to establish an easement by necessity or by prescription.Â  The Court addressed only those two types of easements, but relied on and quoted Elliott in which the Court had implicitly recognized an easement implied by prior use.Â  Brasington, 143 S.C. at 240, 141 S.E. at 380.\r\n[3] Â  In Crosland, 32 S.C. at 132, 10 S.E. at 874, the Court further explained an implied easement may arise: Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nwhen the claimant has been in possession of both the dominant and\r\nthe alleged servient tenement, and while in this possession he creates the easement, or what would have been an easement had it been\r\nover anotherâ€™s land, and he afterwards sells a portion of the land over which the alleged easement runs, reserving the easement\r\neither expressly or under circumstances which implied a reservation. \r\n\r\n[4]  Â See generally 25 Am.Jur.2d Easements and Licenses Â§ 22 (â€œ[A]n easement implied from prior use is created when the servient and dominant estates were once under common ownership, the rights alleged were exercised prior to the severance of the estate, the use was not merely temporary, the continuation of this use was reasonably necessary to the enjoyment of the parcel, and a contrary intention is neither expressed nor implied.â€); Restatement (Third) of Property: Servitudes Â§ 2.12 (2000) (â€œUnless a contrary intent is express or implied, the circumstances that prior to a conveyance severing the ownership of land into two or more parts, a use was made of one part for the benefit of another, implies that [an easement] was created to continue the prior use if, at the time of the severance, the parties had reasonable grounds to expect that the conveyance would not terminate the right to continue the prior use.â€); 28A C.J.S. Easements Â§ 63Â  (1996) (Elements of an easement implied by prior use include: (1) unity of ownership and a subsequent severance of ownership, (2) the prior use must be permanent, apparent, and continuous at the time of severance, and (3) the use must be necessary after severance of title to benefit the dominant estate.); 3 Tiffany Real Property Easements Â§ 781 (Supp. 2006) (â€œThe requirements of an easement by [prior use] are: (1) title shall have been separated between two tracts, one dominant and one servient; (2) before the separation took place, the use which gave rise to the easement shall have been so long continued and so obvious or manifest as to show that it was meant to be permanent; and (3) the easement shall be necessary to the beneficial enjoyment of the land granted or retained.â€); Davis v. Peacock, 991 P.2d 362, 367 (Idaho 1999) (â€œ[T]he party asserting the easement must prove three elements: (1) unity of title or ownership and a subsequent separation by grant of the dominant estate; (2) apparent continuous use long enough before separation of the dominant estate to show that the use was intended to be permanent; and (3) the easement must be reasonably necessary to the proper enjoyment of the dominant estate.â€); Brown v. Haley, 355 S.E.2d 563, 569 (Va. 1987) (â€œWhen a landowner conveys a portion of his land, he impliedly conveys an easement for any use that is continuous, apparent, reasonably necessary for the enjoyment of the property conveyed, and in existence at the time of the conveyance.â€); Knott v. Washington Hous. Auth., 318 S.E.2d 861, 863 (N.C. Ct. App. 1984) (â€œAn easement implied from prior use is generally established by proof: (1) that there was common ownership of the dominant and servient parcels and a transfer which separates that ownership; (2) that, before the transfer, the owner used part of the tract for the benefit of the other part, and that this use was apparent, continuous and permanent; and (3) that the claimed easement is â€˜necessaryâ€™ to the use and enjoyment of the claimantâ€™s land.â€); Rinderer v. Keeven, 412 N.E.2d 1015, 1025 (Ill. App. Ct. 1980) (â€œFor an easement to arise by implication three conditions must be satisfied: (1) the dominant and servient estates must have been owned by a common grantor prior to severance of title; (2) the use prior to severance of title must have been apparent, obvious, continuous and manifestly permanent; (3) the easement must be essential to the beneficial enjoyment of the dominant estate.â€).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26171","title":"State v.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:Â  This appeal raises the novel issue of whether the three-year statute of limitations for contract actions applies to the Stateâ€™s action for the forfeiture of a bail bond in a criminal case.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nFrye Brothers Bonding (Appellant) signed as surety for a $10,000 bond on behalf of Robert McClinton in February 1997.Â  McClinton subsequently failed to appear in court as ordered and as required by his bond.Â  A bench warrant for McClintonâ€™s arrest was issued in February 1998.\r\nThe State filed a rule to show cause in August 2005 for a hearing on whether the bond should be forfeited or estreated by Appellant due to McClintonâ€™s failure to appear in court 7Â½ years earlier.Â  The circuit court subsequently found that the conditions of the bond had been violated and ordered the bond be forfeited and paid to the Lexington County Treasurer, with the proceeds to be distributed among state and local agencies as provided by statute.Â  We certified this case for review from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, to consider the following issue:\r\n\r\nDoes the three-year statute of limitations for contract actions apply to the Stateâ€™s action for forfeiture of a bail bond in a criminal case?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn a case raising a novel question of law, the appellate court is free to decide the question with no particular deference to the lower court.Â  Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 411, 526 S.E.2d 716, 719 (2000) (citing S.C. Const. art. V, Â§Â§ 5 and 9, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 14-3-320 and -330 (1976 &amp; Supp. 2005), and S.C. Code Ann Â§ 14-8-200 (Supp. 2005)); Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partnership, 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d 269, 272 (2000) (same); Clark v. Cantrell, 339 S.C. 369, 378, 529 S.E.2d 528, 533 (2000) (same).\r\nAn appellate court reviews the circuit courtâ€™s ruling on the forfeiture or remission of a bail bond for abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Holloway, 262 S.C. 552, 555, 206 S.E.2d 822, 823 (1974).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the circuit courtâ€™s ruling is based upon an error of law, such as application of the wrong legal principle; or, when based upon factual conclusions, the ruling is without evidentiary support; or, when the circuit court is vested with discretion, but the ruling reveals no discretion was exercised; or when the ruling does not fall within the range of permissible decisions applicable in a particular case, such that it may be deemed arbitrary and capricious.Â  Fontaine v. Peitz, 291 S.C. 536, 539, 354 S.E.2d 565, 566 (1987); S.E.C. v. TheStreet.Com, 273 F.3d 222, 229 n.6 (2d Cir. 2001).Â  \r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends the circuit court erred in ruling that the three-year statute of limitations for contract actions[1] does not apply in a bond forfeiture action in a criminal case.Â  Appellant asserts this Court has held that the Stateâ€™s right to estreatment or forfeiture of a bond arises from contract, which logically implicates the statute of limitations for contract actions.Â  The Stateâ€™s right to move for forfeiture of the bond accrued upon issuance of the bench warrant in February 1998 after McClinton failed to appear in court.Â  Thus, the Stateâ€™s bond forfeiture action brought 7Â½ years later is untimely and barred by the statute of limitations.Â  \r\nThe State contends Appellant is estopped from denying liability on the bond because both Appellant and McClinton derived a benefit from it - Appellant by presumably intending to profit from the transaction and McClinton by remaining free before trial.Â  The State agrees its right to move for forfeiture of the bond accrued upon the issuance of a bench warrant for the defendantâ€™s arrest, but contends no statute of limitations applies to such actions.\r\nWe have held that the Stateâ€™s right to estreatment or forfeiture of a bail bond issued in a criminal case arises from the contract, i.e., the bail bond form signed by the parties.Â  The parties to such a contract typically include the defendant; the person or company which acts as surety for the bond, if any; and the state and local government entities identified on the bond form.Â  We routinely have applied contract principles to resolve various issues arising in bond forfeiture cases.Â  See State v. Cochran, 358 S.C. 24, 27, 594 S.E.2d 844, 845 (2004) (â€œ[t]he Stateâ€™s right to estreatment is governed by contractâ€ and a â€œsuretyâ€ is â€œone who, with the defendant, is liable for the amount of the bail bond upon forfeiture of bailâ€); State v. Boatwright, 310 S.C. 281, 283-84, 423 S.E.2d 139, 140-41 (1992) (â€œit is the contract that provides the basis for the Stateâ€™s right to bond estreatmentâ€; in upholding partial estreatment of bond, Court applied the contract principle of impossibility of performance where defendant was extradited to another state, preventing surety from performing his obligation under the contract to deliver defendant to court); State v. McIntyre, 307 S.C. 363, 415 S.E.2d 399 (1992) (â€œStateâ€™s right to bond estreatment arises from contractâ€; Court applied the Statute of Frauds to negate circuit courtâ€™s oral amendment of contract of which surety asserted it had no notice); State v. White, 284 S.C. 69, 325 S.E.2d 64 (1985) (â€œStateâ€™s right to estreatment of a bond arises from contractâ€; Court held the magistrate erred in disposing of charge originally covered by bond and then continuing the bond to cover a second charge without the consent of the surety); State v. Bailey, 248 S.C. 438, 446, 151 S.E.2d 87, 91 (1966) (â€œthe right of the State to estreatment of an appearance recognizance arises from contract and is, therefore, subject to the doctrine of estoppelâ€); State v. Simring, 230 S.C. 49, 94 S.E.2d 9 (1956) (same); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-160 (2003) (identifying parties to bail bond contract); accord U.S. v. Figuerola, 58 F.3d 502, 503 (9th Cir. 1995) (â€œA bail bond is a contract between the government, the defendant, and his sureties, and is governed by general contract principles.â€); U.S. v. Martinez, 613 F.2d 473, 476 (3d Cir. 1980) (same).\r\nStatutes governing matters related to bail bonds, including the qualifications and licensing of bail bondsmen and their runners, the issuance of bonds, and the forfeiture or remission of bonds are found in Titles 17 and 38.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-15-10 to -260 (2003 &amp; Supp. 2005) and Â§Â§ 38-53-10 to -340 (2002 &amp; Supp. 2005).Â  The forfeiture of a bond after a defendant fails to appear in court as ordered is specifically addressed in two statutes.Â  In order to avoid forfeiture of the bond, the surety must bring the defendant to authorities or place a hold on the defendantâ€™s release from incarceration or commitment at another facility within thirty days of issuance of a bench warrant for the defendantâ€™s arrest.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 38-53-70 (Supp. 2005). When the conditions of a bond have been violated, the State shall immediately move for forfeiture of the bond by notifying the parties and seeking a hearing on a rule to show cause on why the bond should not be forfeited.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-15-170 (2003).\r\nThe parties have not cited, and we have not found, any statute of limitations in the various provisions contained in Titles 17 or 38.Â  The only South Carolina case which broaches the issue is State v. Cornell, 70 S.C. 409, 50 S.E. 22 (1905).Â  In that case, the Court reaffirmed its previous holding that a surety is bound on a bail bond even though the defendant did not sign the bond form.Â  The surety further argued that the State was statutorily required to move for forfeiture of the bond â€œwithout delay,â€ and the Stateâ€™s four-year delay should bar its forfeiture action as untimely. \r\nThe Court rejected the suretyâ€™s argument, finding the language requiring prompt action was merely directory and insufficient to nullify the suretyâ€™s liability.Â  The Court further reasoned â€œ[t]his is not an action upon a statute for a forfeiture or penalty on the [S]tate, so as to make applicable the two and three yearsâ€™ limitations on such an action . . . . [N]or has there been any such unreasonable delay in instituting these proceedings as would warrant the court in denying the relief sought because of laches.â€Â  Cornell, 70 S.C. at 413, 50 S.E. at 23.Â  The Court did not discuss the statute of limitations for contract actions, which in 1905 was essentially identical to the present statute except that it contained a six-year limitation period.Â  Code of Civil Procedure Â§ 112 (Vol. 2 1902).[2]\r\nThe Legislature has provided in Title 15, which contains statutes of limitation governing various causes of action, that â€œ[c]ivil actions may only be commenced within the periods prescribed in this title after the cause of action has accrued, except when, in special cases, a different limitation is imposed by statute.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-20(A) (2005).Â  A three-year statute of limitations applies to â€œan action upon a contract, obligation, or liability, express or implied, excepting those provided for in Section 15-3-520.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530(1) (2005).[3]  \r\nA statute of limitations generally begins to run on the date a cause of action accrues, and a breach of contract action usually accrues at the time a contract is breached or broken.Â  Richland-Lexington Airport Dist. v. American Airlines, Inc., 306 F. Supp. 2d 548, 566 (D.S.C. 2002); Livingston v. Sims, 197 S.C. 458, 462, 15 S.E.2d 770, 772 (1941), overruled on other grounds by Santee Portland Cement Co. v. Daniel Intl. Corp., 299 S.C. 269, 384 S.E.2d 693 (1989) (discovery rule applies in contract actions), overruled on other grounds by Atlas Food Systems &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natl. Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp., 319 S.C. 556, 462 S.E.2d 858 (1995).\r\nIn United States v. Toro, 981 F.2d 1045 (9th Cir. 1992), the court applied the federal six-year statute of limitations for contract actions to bar the governmentâ€™s action for forfeiture of a bail bond as untimely.Â  The Ninth Circuit explained that courts apply general principles of contract construction when interpreting bail bonds.Â  The governmentâ€™s motion for forfeiture of the bond was an action for money damages and, more specifically, an action for liquidated damages.Â  The Ninth Circuit rejected the governmentâ€™s argument that the district court should have moved, sua sponte, to declare the bond forfeited upon the defendantâ€™s failure to appear in court.Â  The six-year statute of limitations on a claim against a surety begins to run when the contract is breached, i.e., when a defendant breaches a bail bond condition.Â  Id. at 1047-49; accord State v. American Bankers Ins. Co., 782 P.2d 1316, 1317-18 (Nev. 1989) (where bail bond forfeiture provisions did not contain a statute of limitations, court applied general six-year statute of limitations for contract actions to bond forfeiture action, rather than two-year period for actions upon a statute for penalty or forfeiture); People v. Woodall, 271 N.W.2d 298 (Mich. App. 1978) (surety bond in criminal case is contract between government and principal and surety, and six-year statute of limitations for contract actions applies).[4]\r\nWe find persuasive the reasoning in Toro and similar cases, and conclude it is appropriate to apply the three-year statute of limitations for contracts to bail bond forfeiture actions.Â  The Legislature has not provided a specific statute of limitations in the bail bond statutes; however, nothing in those statutes indicates an intent to prohibit a reasonable deadline for the State to act.Â  In fact, the language of Sections 38-53-70 and 17-15-170 indicates the Legislature anticipated the State would move expeditiously for forfeiture of bond when necessary.Â  The Court did not definitively resolve this issue in Cornell and our conclusion is consistent with prior authority stating that bail bonds generally are governed by contract principles.\r\nWe further conclude that the statute of limitations on the forfeiture of a bail bond begins to run thirty days after the issuance of a bench warrant for a defendantâ€™s failure to appear, pursuant to the process established in Section 38-53-70.Â  We rely on the more specific process set forth in Section 38-53-70, and less on the general directive in Section 17-15-170 that the State move â€œimmediatelyâ€ for forfeiture of the bond upon noncompliance with its condition, because this language in the latter statute is merely directory.Â  See Cornell, 70 S.C. at 413, 50 S.E. at 23.Â  Moreover, we note a solicitor will retain significant control over the three-year clock because the solicitor will choose the date the clock begins to run by calling a case for disposition and seeking the issuance of a bench warrant due to a defendantâ€™s failure to appear.\r\nIn addition, the imposition of a reasonable deadline on the State in this setting is appropriate because, first, a three-year period provides ample time for the State to seek forfeiture of a bond if it desires to do so.Â  Second, statutes of limitations â€œare designed to promote justice by forcing parties to pursue a case in a timely manner. Â Parties should act before memories dim, evidence grows stale or becomes nonexistent, or other people act in reliance on what they believe is a settled state of public [or private] affairs.â€Â  State ex rel. Condon v. City of Columbia, 339 S.C. 8, 19, 528 S.E.2d 408, 413-14 (2000).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[t]here is universal acceptance of the logic of Statutes of Limitations that litigation must be brought within a reasonable time in order that evidence be reasonably available and there be some end to litigation. Â Not only do such statutes apply to suits against the State but also to suits brought by the State.â€Â  Webb v. Greenwood County, 229 S.C. 267, 276, 92 S.E.2d 688, 691 (1956); accord Santee Portland Cement Co., 299 S.C. at 271, 384 S.E.2d at 694 (one policy underlying statute of limitations is to protect defendant from false or fraudulent claims that might be difficult to disprove if brought after relevant evidence or witnesses are no longer available).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe reverse the circuit court and hold that the three-year statute of limitations for contract actions applies to actions by the State for the forfeiture of a bail bond in a criminal case.Â  The statute begins to run thirty days after issuance of a bench warrant for a defendantâ€™s failure to appear, pursuant to the process established in Section 38-53-70.Â  Accordingly, the Stateâ€™s forfeiture action in this instance, brought 7Â½ years after the issuance of a bench warrant for defendantâ€™s arrest for failure to appear in court as ordered, is barred by the statute of limitations.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Â State v. Pagan, 357 S.C. 132, 591 S.E.2d 646 (Ct. App. 2004). Â We affirm as modified.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe victimâ€™s body was discovered in a vacant lot in Florence County about 8 a.m. on December 11, 1997.Â  A police officer testified the victimâ€™s head had been severely beaten and her pants were down around her ankles.Â  Dr. Edward Proctor, a forensic pathologist, performed an autopsy on the victimâ€™s body and opined the cause of death was massive blunt force injury to the head.Â  \r\nAn investigation revealed semen found on the victimâ€™s pants and body belonged to Stephen Blathers, who lived near the vacant lot where the victimâ€™s body was discovered.Â  When confronted with the results of the investigation, Blathers admitted having sex with the victim on the night of the murder.Â  He further testified he heard screaming outside his house about 2 a.m. that night and he saw a shadow run across the yard.Â  Blathers thought the shadow was the same man he had previously seen with the victim on the night of the murder, and he later identified Petitioner as that man.Â  \r\nJessie Jones, who also lived near the vacant lot, testified that about 2 a.m. on December 11, he heard people hitting a sign outside his house, and he told the people to leave.Â  He then observed a man and a woman hitting each other with sticks, and thought they were arguing over money.Â  Jones did not think the man arguing with the woman was Blathers because Blathers is five feet tall and the man he saw was six feet tall.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nOn December 11 and 13, 1997, Monique Ellerbee Cooks called Crime Stoppers and reported she went to a club with the victim on the night of the murder.Â  Cooks reported the victim left the club with a man, gave a detailed description of the man, and said she did not see them again.Â  Cooks subsequently met with a forensic artist who drew a composite sketch of the man she saw with the victim.Â  Cooks was also shown a photographic lineup with Petitioner in it; however, she did not identify anyone.Â  \r\nAt trial, Cooks testified she was with the victim on the night of the murder.Â  Cooks went to White Sands, a bar, while the victim stayed outside to talk to a man.Â  When Cooks left the bar, she decided to follow the victim and the man because they were leaving together. Â Cooks testified she thought the victim and the man were arguing over money and drugs.Â  At some point during the walk, the victim and the man began hitting each other with sticks.Â  Cooks testified the victim and the man moved toward a vacant lot when Jones yelled for the people to stop hitting a sign.Â  The man continued hitting the victim and began dragging her.Â  Cooks testified she offered to pay the man, but he did not want her money.Â  The man then told the victim if she did not pay him, he would beat the money out of her. Â When the victim ran away, the man pursued her, caught her, then began to pull off her clothes, and beat her on the head with a board.\r\nCooks identified Petitioner in court as the man she saw beat the victim to death.Â  Cooks testified she did not originally report that she had witnessed the murder and she did not initially identify Petitioner in the photographic lineup because she was scared.Â  \r\nPetitionerâ€™s defense was alibi and he argued the evidence did not point to him as the murderer.Â  He testified his wife dropped him off at White Sands on the evening of December 10, 1997.Â  He left White Sands between 10 and 10:30 p.m. and went to the Pub, where he talked to Leroy Jones and Darren Burgess.Â  After about an hour, he called his wife to pick him up and approximately thirty minutes later she arrived at the Pub.Â  Jones, Burgess, and Petitionerâ€™s wife corroborated Petitionerâ€™s testimony regarding when he arrived and departed the Pub.Â  His wife also testified Petitioner was at home for the rest of the night. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\nPetitioner was arrested by the United States Marshals in New Jersey on February 20, 1998, and extradited to South Carolina.Â  He was subsequently released on bond.Â  \r\nTamika Lambert testified on February 16, 1999, she was walking down a street in Florence when a man named â€œDerrickâ€ picked her up in a vehicle.Â  She testified a police officer attempted to pull them over and Derrick sped away eventually wrecking the car.Â  Derrick then ran from the scene, but Lambert was detained by the police.Â  Later that night, Lambert ran into Derrick and he apologized to her.Â  He told her he ran from the police because he did not have a driverâ€™s license and â€œthey accused him of killing this girl - - Well, this girl named Monique.â€Â  She further testified he told her â€œthat he was on . . . a $100,000 bond because they had - - This girl - - They accused him of killing some girl.Â  And it was all because of some girl named Monica.â€[1]Â  After the incident, Lambert picked Petitioner out of a photographic lineup as â€œDerrick.â€Â  \r\nDefense counsel objected to Lambertâ€™s testimony.Â  The trial judge allowed the testimony as evidence of identity under Rule 404(b), SCRE.Â  The trial judge also gave the following limiting instruction: the testimony â€œrelated to the issue of identification of [Petitioner.]Â  You canâ€™t infer that he was charged with or know about a failure to stop for blue light charge, that heâ€™s necessarily guilty of murder.Â  Thereâ€™s no connection.â€Â  \r\nLavenia Helton testified to a prior altercation between the victim and Petitioner during 1997.Â  Helton testified the victim was leaving Heltonâ€™s apartment one day with a bag of crack cocaine.Â  Petitioner demanded the victim give him the bag of crack cocaine.Â  When the victim complied, Petitioner told her she would die.Â  \r\nAt trial, Petitioner denied knowing the victim.Â  He also denied ever seeing Lambert, Cooks, and Helton until they testified at trial.Â  Petitioner further denied being involved in the February 16, 1999, failure to stop for a blue light incident.Â  \r\nThe jury found Petitioner guilty of murder, and the Court of Appeals affirmed the conviction.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in affirming the trial judgeâ€™s\r\nadmission of testimony that, while Petitioner was out on bond for the current murder charge, he failed to stop for a blue light andlater explained to a passenger in the vehicle that he had fled from\r\nthe police because he was accused of killing the victim?Â  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe admission of evidence is within the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Gaster, 349 S.C. 545, 557, 564 S.E.2d 87, 93 (2002).Â  An abuse of discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.Â  State v. McDonald, 343 S.C. 319, 325, 540 S.E.2d 464, 467 (2000).\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  Evidence of Flight\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony because the testimony did not relate to flight from the charged crime.[2]Â  We agree.\r\nFlight from prosecution is admissible as guilt.Â  State v. Thompson, 278 S.C. 1, 292 S.E.2d 581 (1982), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991) Â (evidence of flight admissible to show guilty knowledge, intent, and that defendant sought to avoid apprehension).Â  The critical factor to the admissibility of evidence of flight is whether the totality of the evidence creates an inference that the defendant had knowledge that he was being sought\r\nby the authorities.Â  State v. Beckham, 334 S.C. 302, 315, 513 S.E.2d 606, 612 (1999).Â  It is sufficient that circumstances justify an inference that the defendantâ€™s actions were motivated as a result of his belief that police officers were aware of his wrongdoing and were seeking him for that purpose.Â  Flight or evasion of arrest is a\r\ncircumstance to go to the jury.Â  Id. (citation omitted).\r\nFlight evidence is relevant when there is a nexus between the flight and the offense charged.Â  See State v. Robinson, 360 S.C. 187, 195, 600 S.E.2d 100, 104 (Ct. App. 2004) (citing United States v. Beahm, 664 F.2d 414, 419-20 (4th Cir. 1981) (evidence of flight inadmissible where a defendant flees â€œafter â€˜commencement of an investigationâ€™ unrelated to the crime charged, or of which the defendant was unawareâ€); United States v. Foutz, 540 F.2d 733, 740 (4th Cir. 1976) (evidence of flight should be excluded where defendant flees while being investigated for another crime), cert. denied Nov. 2, 2005.\r\nThe Court of Appeals found Lambertâ€™s testimony was admissible as evidence of flight.Â  The Court of Appeals discerned the testimony was admissible to prove Petitioner was attempting to violate his bond provisions for the pending murder charge and he could identify the Stateâ€™s key witness.Â  Pagan, 357 S.C. at 141, 591 S.E.2d at 651.\r\nThe flight evidence is not relevant in this case because there is no nexus between the flight and the current offense of murder. Â The evidence does not create an inference that Petitionerâ€™s alleged failure to stop for a blue light was motivated by his belief that the police officer was seeking him for his pending murder charge.Â  Robinson, 360 S.C. at 195, 600 S.E.2d at 104 (â€œEvidence of flight should be excluded when the flight is clearly linked to a separate offense for which the defendant is not on trial.â€).Â  Lambertâ€™s testimony was not admissible as evidence of flight or guilty knowledge.\r\nB.Â  Corroboration Evidence\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony based on corroboration evidence because the testimony did not corroborate Cooksâ€™ testimony.Â  He argues even if the testimony was corroborative, it should have been excluded because the probative value did not substantially outweigh the unfair prejudice to him.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nAll relevant evidence is admissible.Â  Rule 402, SCRE; State v. Saltz, 346 S.C. 114, 551 S.E.2d 240 (2001).Â  Relevant evidence is defined as â€œevidence having any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is of consequence to the determination of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the evidence.â€Â  Rule 401, SCRE.Â  Relevant evidence may be excluded where its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice.Â  Rule 403, SCRE; State v. Alexander, 303 S.C. 377, 401 S.E.2d 146 (1991).Â  \r\nâ€œCorroborative testimony is testimony which tends to strengthen, confirm, or make more certain the testimony of another witness.Â  Evidence is admissible to corroborate the testimony of a previous witness, and whether it in fact corroborates the witnessâ€™ testimony is a question for the jury.â€Â  State v. Stroman, 281 S.C. 508, 510, 316 S.E.2d 395, 397 (1984) (internal citations omitted).\r\nThe Court of Appeals found Lambertâ€™s testimony admissible as corroboration evidence of Cooksâ€™ testimony.Â  The Court of Appeals asserted Lambert corroborated that Cooks was an eyewitness to the crime; Cooks was scared Petitioner would harm her; and Petitioner knew Cooksâ€™ identity prior to trial.Â  Pagan, 357 S.C. at 142, 591 S.E.2d at 651-52.\r\nLambertâ€™s testimony was irrelevant to any issue presented at trial.Â  Her testimony did not establish that Cooks was an eyewitness to the crime or that Petitioner had threatened Cooks.Â  The testimony simply revealed that Petitioner knew he had been charged with the victimâ€™s murder and he knew the name of a witness.Â  The Court of Appeals erred in affirming the admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony as corroboration evidence. \r\nC.Â  Identity under Rule 404(b), SCRE\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in affirming the admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony based on Rule 404(b), SCRE, because the testimony did not identify Petitioner as the victimâ€™s murderer.Â  We agree.Â  \r\nEvidence of other crimes, wrongs, or acts is generally not admissible to prove the defendantâ€™s guilt for the crime charged.Â  Such evidence is, however, admissible to show motive, identity, the existence of a common scheme or plan, the absence of mistake or accident, or intent.Â  Rule 404(b), SCRE; State v. Lyle, 125 S.C. 406, 118 S.E. 803 (1923).Â  To be admissible, the bad act must logically relate to the crime with which the defendant has been charged.Â  If the defendant was not convicted of the prior crime, evidence of the prior bad act must be clear and convincing.Â  State v. Beck, 342 S.C. 129, 135-36, 536 S.E.2d 679, 682-83 (2000). Â Even if prior bad act evidence is clear and convincing and falls within an exception, it must be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant.Â  State v. Braxton, 343 S.C. 629, 541 S.E.2d 833 (2001).Â  Â \r\nThe trial court and the Court of Appeals found Lambertâ€™s testimony admissible under Rule 404(b), SCRE, as evidence of identity.Â  The Court of Appeals asserted the â€œtestimony was logically relevant as evidence of [Petitionerâ€™s] identity because it connected the murder with [Petitionerâ€™s] flight from the police one year later.â€Â  Pagan, 357 S.C. at 144, 591 S.E.2d at 652.\r\nThe trial court erred in admitting the bad act evidence because the bad act did not logically relate to the murder.Â  Petitionerâ€™s alleged statement to Lambert was that he fled because a female, named Monique or Monica, had accused him of murdering someone and he was out on bond for that murder charge.Â  The failure to stop and the following explanation in no way identifies Petitioner as the person who murdered the victim.Â  This evidence merely illustrates that Petitioner, who had already been charged with the victimâ€™s murder and released on bond for that charge, knew he had been accused of murder and knew the name of a witness in the case.Â  Compare Braxton, 343 S.C. at 634, 541 S.E.2d at 836 (testimony that witness knew appellant possessed a nine millimeter pistol was relevant because it tended to identify appellant as the possessor of the murder weapon, a nine millimeter pistol); State v. Cheeseboro, 346 S.C. 526, 547, 552 S.E.2d 300, 311 (2001) (prior murder was admissible to establish appellantâ€™s identity in the prosecution of the current murder where the same weapon was used in both murders).\r\nD.Â  Harmless Error\r\nPetitioner argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding any error in the admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony was harmless error.Â  We disagree.\r\nGenerally, appellate courts will not set aside convictions due to insubstantial errors not affecting the result.Â  State v. Sherard, 303 S.C. 172, 176, 399 S.E.2d 595, 597 (1991).Â  Error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt where it did not contribute to the verdict obtained.Â \r\nArnold v. State, 309 S.C. 157, 172, 420 S.E.2d 834, 842 (1992).Â  Thus, an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless where â€œguilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that no other rational conclusion can be reached.â€Â  State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989). \r\nAlthough the trial judge erroneously admitted testimony that Petitioner failed to stop for a blue light in 1999, the error did not contribute to the guilty verdict. The 1999 failure to stop was not similar to the current murder charge and the danger of prejudice was not enhanced.Â  Compare State v. Brooks, 341 S.C. 57, 62-63, 533 S.E.2d 325, 328 (2000) (when the prior bad acts are similar to the one for which the appellant is being tried, the danger of prejudice is enhanced); State v. Gore, 283 S.C. 118, 121, 322 S.E.2d 12, 13 (1984) (same).Â  Also, the erroneous admission of bad act evidence had minimal impact when numerous other bad acts, including prior convictions for failure to stop and conspiracy to traffic crack cocaine, were properly admitted.Â  See State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991) (finding harmless error when trial judge erred in admitting prior bad act evidence where the testimony was minimal).Â  Furthermore, the trial judge instructed the jury that they could not find Petitioner guilty of murder because Petitioner was charged with failure to stop. Â Â \r\nMoreover, other competent evidence established Petitionerâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Helton testified to a prior altercation between Petitioner and the victim in which Petitioner told the victim she would die.Â  Blathers testified he saw Petitioner with the victim on the night of the murder and he later saw Petitioner running away from someone screaming.Â  Cooks gave an eyewitness account of the murder by testifying she witnessed Petitioner beat the victim to death with a board.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals erred in affirming the trial courtâ€™s admission of Lambertâ€™s testimony as evidence of flight, corroboration, and identity.Â  We conclude the error is harmless and affirm Petitionerâ€™s conviction.\r\n AFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., and WALLER, J., concur.Â  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  I agree with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that the trial judge erred in allowing Lambertâ€™s testimony; however, in my opinion, this error cannot be harmless.Â  Identity was a critical issue in this case.Â  Petitionerâ€™s failure to stop for a blue light in 1999 was irrelevant to his identity as the murderer.Â  The fact that the trial judge specifically instructed the jury it could consider this evidence for identification purposes made the erroneous admission of this evidence even more prejudicial.Â  I would reverse and remand for a new trial.\r\n PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n[1]  During Lambertâ€™s testimony, there appeared to be some confusion over whether the name was Monica or Monique.Â  \r\n[2]  Petitioner relies on McFadden v. State, 342 S.C. 637, 539 S.E.2d 391 (2000).Â  McFadden is not applicable to the current case because it involves the rule that, in a trial in absentia, the jury cannot consider the defendantâ€™s absence at trial as evidence of defendantâ€™s guilt. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26173","title":"Douglas v.

State, 263 S.C. 110, 208 S.E.2d 35 (1974).Â  As we explained in Poston v. State, 339 S.C. 37, 528 S.E.2d 422 (2000)[1] and in Legge v. State, 349 S.C. 222, 562 S.E.2d 618 (2002), White v. State is limited to situations where the PCR applicant did not knowingly and intelligently waive his right to a direct appeal.Â  Petitioner, of course, was afforded this right.\r\nWe decline to impose a duty on appellate counsel to pursue rehearing and/or certiorari following the decision of the Court of Appeals in a criminal direct appeal.Â  The imposition of such a duty would conflict with this Courtâ€™s explanation in In re Exhaustion of State Remedies in Criminal and Post-Conviction Relief Cases, 321 S.C. 563, 471 S.E.2d 454 (1990), that the Court of Appeals was created to reduce the Stateâ€™s appellate backlog.Â  A holding that certiorari must be sought whenever requested would increase this Courtâ€™s workload by increasing the number of criminal writs of certiorari to the Court of Appeals.Â  This Court â€œreviews [Court of Appeals] decisions by writ of certiorari only where special reasons justify exercise of that power.â€Â  Id.Â  We find that the decision whether to pursue certiorari is a matter left solely to the appellantâ€™s attorneyâ€™s professional discretion.Â  Cf.

Myers, of Lexington, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  This is an appeal from a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  Appellant contends the trial court committed three errors warranting reversal.Â  First, the trial court refused to allow defense counsel to ask jurors whether they would â€œstick with their vote or go with the majorityâ€ during voir dire.Â  Second, the trial court determined that certain testimony and evidence about a prior offense was not inadmissible â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence.Â  Third, the trial court ruled that remarks made by the Solicitor did not unfairly inject racial issues into the trial.Â  We affirm.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nAppellant received several criminal convictions in connection with the murder of Benton Smith (Victim).Â  The evidence established that Victim was last seen leaving his residence accompanied by Appellant.Â  After police and family members searched for Victim for several days, Appellant led police to Victimâ€™s body which was buried under wood brush behind Appellantâ€™s sisterâ€™s home.Â  Victim had been stabbed approximately seventy (70) times with a Phillips head screwdriver and died as a result of internal bleeding.Â  Appellant gave conflicting statements to police; first denying any knowledge of Victimâ€™s murder, then confessing to the murder, and finally recanting and maintaining his innocence.Â  After a sentencing proceeding, the jury sentenced Appellant to death.\r\nThis Court affirmed Appellantâ€™s convictions but reversed his death sentence.Â  State v. Bennett, 328 S.C. 251, 493 S.E.2d 845 (1997).Â  During Appellantâ€™s second sentencing proceeding, he objected to (1) the trial courtâ€™s decision to exclude a question from voir dire, (2) the introduction of testimony and evidence regarding a prior conviction for assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), and (3) comments made by the Solicitor during cross-examination of a witness and during closing arguments.\r\nSpecifically, Appellant alleged the trial court improperly excluded the â€œwill you go with the majority or hold to your decisionâ€ question from voir dire.Â  The trial court found that the question tended to suggest the possibility of a hung jury and â€œthe fact that [the juror] can hold things up.â€Â  The court held that the defense could ask a juror â€œif they understand that by their oath that [sic] they should make their own determinations of the facts . . . but certainly we cannot get into pitting them against the other jurors.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nAdditionally, Appellant alleged that the trial court allowed the mothers of the two ABHAN victims to present impermissible â€œvictim impactâ€ testimony, that the trial court improperly admitted highly prejudicial hospital photographs of the two ABHAN victims, and that the trial court improperly allowed one of the ABHAN victims to testify about a dream he had in which â€œblack Indiansâ€ were chasing him.Â  The trial court determined that the testimony and photographs were relevant to Appellantâ€™s character and admissible as details of prior criminal convictions.Â  Also, the trial court noted that the â€œblack Indiansâ€ comment was mentioned only once, was not elicited by the State, and did not prejudice Appellant.Â  \r\nFurthermore, Appellant alleged that the Solicitor improperly injected racial issues into the sentencing proceeding by making inappropriate comments while questioning a witness.Â  While cross-examining a witness about a former prison guard who had engaged in a sexual relationship with Appellant, the witness asked the Solicitor, â€œYou mean the big girl?â€Â  The Solicitor responded, â€œYou know, the blond lady?â€Â  The trial court found that this reference did not improperly inject race into the trial.Â  \r\nFinally, Appellant alleged that the Solicitor attempted to inject racial issues into the sentencing proceeding by making inappropriate remarks during the Stateâ€™s closing arguments.Â  In his closing arguments, the Solicitor compared Appellantâ€™s size and violent acts to those of â€œKing Kongâ€ and a â€œCaveman.â€Â  Appellant first objected to these comments in his motion for a new trial, and the trial court determined that these comments properly described the circumstances surrounding the murder, Appellantâ€™s character and violent background, his disregard for prison rules, his size, strength, and destructiveness, and were invited responses to Appellantâ€™s mitigating evidence and argument.Â  \r\nThis appeal followed, and Appellant raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I.\r\n         Did the trial court err in excluding the â€œwill you go with the majorityâ€ question from voir dire?Â \r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the trial court err in admitting certain evidence regarding Appellantâ€™s prior ABHAN conviction?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        \r\n        &nbsp;\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        III.&nbsp;\r\n         Did the Solicitorâ€™s comments during cross-examination of a witness or during closing arguments improperly inject racial issues into the trial?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nI.Â Â Â Â Â Â  Voir Dire\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court improperly excluded the â€œwill you go with the majorityâ€ question from voir dire.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn general, both the scope of voir dire and the manner in which it is conducted are within the sound discretion of the trial judge.Â  State v. Hill, 361 S.C. 297, 308, 604 S.E.2d 696, 702 (2004).Â  â€œTo constitute reversible error, a limitation on questioning must render the trial â€˜fundamentally unfair.â€™â€Â  Id.\r\nOur opinion in State v. Hill controls on this issue.Â  In Hill, the trial court refused to allow the defense to ask jurors whether they would â€œgive up their vote in order to go with the majority.â€Â  Id. at 308, 604 S.E.2d at 702.Â  Hill argued that this was improper because our opinion reversing Appellantâ€™s death sentence condoned the use of the â€œgo with the majorityâ€ question.Â  Id.Â  Disagreeing, this court clarified that we reversed Appellantâ€™s death sentence because the trial court improperly qualified and seated a juror who answered that he would indeed â€œgo with the majorityâ€ over his own determination.Â  Id. at 309, 604 S.E.2d at 702.Â  Ultimately, this Court held that a review of entire voir dire indicated that Hillâ€™s jurors were unbiased, impartial, and capable of following the instructions on the law.Â  Id. at 310, 604 S.E.2d at 702.Â  Relying on the highly deferential standard of review in voir dire cases, we stated: \r\n\r\n[W]hat is constitutionally mandated is the selection of a fair and impartial jury.Â  No particular formula of questions is mandated to achieve this goal.Â  In our justice system, the trial judge has the discretion and the duty to monitor the voir dire so as to ensure that the jury selected measures up to the constitutional standard.Â  The judgeâ€™s ruling in this case, disallowing defense counsel to question jurors about their propensity to go with the majority, did not render the trial â€œfundamentally unfair.â€\r\n\r\nId. at 310, 604 S.E.2d at 702-03.\r\nOur review of the entire voir dire in this case reveals that Appellant had an impartial jury.Â  As in Hill, the trial court extensively questioned each juror regarding the ability to be fair and impartial, and there is no evidence suggesting that any juror failed in these capacities.Â  Because the evidence in the record supports only the conclusion that Appellant received a fair and impartial jury, and because there is no evidence suggesting that the trial courtâ€™s voir dire limitation rendered Appellantâ€™s trial â€œfundamentally unfair,â€ we affirm the trial courtâ€™s decision.[1]\r\nII.Â Â Â Â Â  Evidence of Prior Convictions\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred in admitting the ABHAN victimsâ€™ mothersâ€™ testimonies, the hospital photographs, and the testimony about the victimâ€™s â€œblack Indiansâ€ dream because this evidence was impermissible â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence of prior crimes.Â  We disagree.\r\nIn Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991), the United States Supreme Court held that the Eighth Amendment did not prohibit a jury from considering â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence at the sentencing phase of a capital trial.Â  In Payne, a brutal double murder, the defendant challenged the admission of testimony that the child of one of the victims â€œmissed his motherâ€ and the Stateâ€™s remarks in closing arguments suggesting that the continuing effects of the crimes on the victimsâ€™ family favored imposing the death penalty.Â  Id. at 816.Â  Drawing on historical arguments and reasons of fairness, the Supreme Court held that a state was not constitutionally prohibited from allowing a capital sentencing jury to consider â€œthe specific harm caused by the defendant,â€ including the impact of the murder on the victimâ€™s family and â€œa quick glimpse of the life which the defendant chose to extinguish.â€Â  Id. at 822-26.\r\nContrary to Appellantâ€™s assertions, none of the testimony at issue in this case was â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence.Â  First, the mothersâ€™ testimonies were limited to the circumstances surrounding the ABHAN and the extent of the injuries their sons suffered.Â  This evidence was clearly not evidence of the character of the victims or the impact on their families, but rather, evidence of the physical injuries caused by Appellant.Â  That the descriptions of the victimsâ€™ injuries came from their mothers does not automatically convert factually descriptive testimony into impact testimony regarding the victimsâ€™ character or the effect on the victimsâ€™ families or community.\r\nSimilarly, there can be no question that the hospital photographs were introduced to describe the extent of the injuries the ABHAN victims suffered.Â  These photographs are easily distinguished from cases where photographs have been deemed â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence. See State v. Langley, 334 S.C. 643, 515 S.E.2d 98 (1999) (photograph of murder victim in his high school graduation regalia); see also State v. Livingston, 327 S.C. 17, 488 S.E.2d 313 (1997) (photograph of victim and her husband taken shortly before victim was involved in fatal accident).Â  Although, like in Langley Â and Livingston, the photographs in this case were certain to elicit an emotional response from the jury, these photographs were highly probative of the nature of Appellantâ€™s prior crime in that they provided the clearest picture of the aggravated nature of the assault and battery.Â  \r\nFinally, we hold the victimâ€™s testimony about his â€œblack Indiansâ€ dream was not â€œvictim impactâ€ evidence.Â  This testimony merely described the emotional injury to the ABHAN victim.Â  \r\nThough masquerading as a horse of the same color, the dissent decides an entirely different case from the one at bar.Â  At the sentencing proceeding, Appellant argued the testimony about the ABHAN victimsâ€™ injuries was â€œinappropriate victim impact type of information having nothing to do with the particular crime Mr. Bennett is on trial for now.â€Â  Likewise, it appears Appellantâ€™s objection to the hospital photographs was based on Rule 403, SCRE (excluding relevant evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice).Â  Finally, Appellant objected to the introduction the victimâ€™s dream on the grounds of relevance.Â  Before this Court, however, Appellant did not couch these objections in terms of relevance or a Rule 403 analysis.Â  Instead, the only theory Appellant presented to this Court on this issue was that this evidence should have been excluded as impermissible victim impact evidence of prior crimes.Â  \r\nBecause the evidence in this case was not victim impact evidence, Appellantâ€™s argument must fail.Â  When asked to do so, we will consider arguments regarding the types of evidence of prior crimes that should and should not be admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding.[2] Â However, we feel that the delicate task of balancing the duty to conduct a sentencing inquiry â€œbroad in scope,â€ Dawson, 503 U.S. at 164, against the need to protect a capital defendant from unfair prejudice and prevent a capital sentencing proceeding from transmuting into a sentencing referendum on all of the defendantâ€™s prior crimes is only properly performed when that case is presented.Â  Such a case would no doubt involve considerations of when the introduction of evidence renders a proceeding so unfair as to violate due process, see Payne, 501 U.S. at 831, and also would implicate our rules of evidence; rules which, at the most basic level, allow proof of character by specific instances of conduct.Â  See Rule 405, SCRE.\r\nInstead of addressing any of these topics, which would be of paramount importance when considering clarifying our relevance rules, the briefs to this Court, like Appellantâ€™s argument, concerned only victim impact evidence.Â  Under these circumstances, we feel the better course is to confine ourselves to a careful analysis of the arguments briefed and presented to us.Â  See State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 (1991) (abolishing in favorem vitae review in capital cases).Â  Although the dissent raises intriguing questions, we think it the better course to wait to decide such a case until we are asked.Â  See State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 411, 548 S.E.2d 213, 216 (2001) (appellate court will not consider issues not properly presented).\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we hold that the testimony about the ABHAN victimsâ€™ injuries and the corresponding photographs was not impermissible victim impact evidence relating to Appellantâ€™s prior crimes.\r\nIII.Â Â Â  Alleged Inappropriate Remarks\r\nAppellant argues that the Solicitorâ€™s comments during cross-examination of a witness and during closing arguments improperly injected racial issues into the trial.Â  We disagree.\r\nAs a general rule, inflammatory remarks which are calculated to appeal to the passions or prejudices of a jury should be affirmatively condemned.Â  South Carolina State Highway Depâ€™t. v. Nasim, 255 S.C. 406, 411, 179 S.E.2d 211, 213 (1971).Â  â€œ[W]hether or not the particular arguments are so prejudicial as to constitute reversible error depends upon the nature of the utterances and the circumstances under which they were made.â€Â  Id.Â  Under certain circumstances, this Court will grant a new trial despite the aggrieved partyâ€™s failure to contemporaneously object to the argument if the prejudice caused by the argument is clear.Â  Dial v. Niggel Assoc., Inc., 333 S.C. 253, 256, 509 S.E.2d 269, 271 (1998); Toyota of Florence, Inc., v. Lynch, 314 S.C. 257, 263, 442 S.E.2d 611, 615 (1994).\r\nAdditionally, a solicitorâ€™s closing arguments in a capital trial should focus on the defendantâ€™s character, his background, and the nature of the crime.Â  State v. Reed, 293 S.C. 515, 519, 362 S.E.2d 13, 15 (1987) (overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 S.C. 45, 69, 406 S.E.2d 315, 328 (1991)).Â  The arguments must be viewed in the context of the entire record, and the relevant question is whether the comments infected the trial with unfairness so as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.Â  State v. Patterson, 324 S.C. 5, 17, 482 S.E.2d 760, 766 (1997).\r\nAs a starting point, we recognize that the terms â€œblond ladyâ€ and â€œKing Kongâ€ could have racial connotations.Â  However, this courtâ€™s jurisprudence does not prohibit the use of terms with racial meanings, nor does our case law stand for the proposition that arguments or evidence in a case must be void of racial allusions.Â  Instead, this court has recognized that it is impermissible to use race to â€œinflame the passions or prejudicesâ€ of the jury.Â  Accordingly, our inquiry focuses on how these terms were used in Appellantâ€™s case.\r\nIn our view, the â€œblond ladyâ€ remark was not made to inflame the passions or prejudices of the jury.Â  If the State had sought to make the race of Appellantâ€™s former lover an issue in this case, we believe they would have elicited evidence to this effect while examining their witness who testified extensively about the affair.Â  Instead, this comment came while cross-examining a defense witness.Â  \r\nFurthermore, we find that even if this remark was inflammatory, it did not prejudice Appellant.Â  This remark is a far cry from the outrageous and inflammatory evidence and arguments seen in Nasim, Toyota, Dial, and the cases cited by Appellant.Â  The proper inquiry is not whether the Solicitorâ€™s remark was undesirable or condemnable, but whether the comment â€œso infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting conviction a denial of due process.â€Â  Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 181 (1986).Â  In this case, the Solicitor made the â€œblond ladyâ€ comment only once and never referred to Appellantâ€™s loverâ€™s race again.Â  Furthermore, this case involved a brutal murder, where guilt was clearly established.Â  Accordingly, we find no evidence of prejudice from the â€œblond ladyâ€ remark.\r\nSimilarly, the Solicitorâ€™s use of the term â€œKing Kongâ€ was not an appeal to the passions or prejudices of the jury.Â  The comment referred to Appellantâ€™s immense size, strength, and the destructiveness of his previous crimes.Â  In this case, the trial court properly determined that Appellantâ€™s size and strength were probative of the aggravating circumstance of physical torture, which the court charged to the jury.Â  In this regard, the Solicitorâ€™s use of the term â€œKing Kongâ€ was not suggestive of a giant black gorilla who abducts a white woman, but rather, descriptive of Appellantâ€™s size and strength as they related to his past crimes.\r\nAlso, Appellantâ€™s mitigation witnesses described him as â€œa gentle giant,â€ â€œa big old teddy bear,â€ â€œthe Secretary of Defense,â€ and â€œthe Mediator.â€Â  The defense used these terms to indicate Appellant was a changed man and not a threat to others.Â  In this regard, the trial court correctly found that â€œKing Kongâ€ was an invited response to Appellantâ€™s mitigation evidence.Â  \r\nFinally, the Solicitorâ€™s â€œCavemanâ€ comment was merely descriptive of two of Appellantâ€™s past violent incidents.Â  A witness to Appellantâ€™s ABHAN testified that she saw Appellant dragging the motionless body of one of the victims across a parking lot by the hair.Â  Additionally, a prison guard testified about an incident where Appellant reached into another inmateâ€™s cell and dragged the inmate out by the hair.Â  The Solicitor made this comment while describing how Appellant dragged his victims during these incidents, and, in our view, the comment was not inflammatory.\r\nBased on the above reasoning, we hold that the Solicitorâ€™s comments did not improperly inject racial issues into the trial.[3]\r\nProportionality Review\r\nAs required, we conduct a proportionality review of Appellantâ€™s death sentence.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C) (2003).Â  The United States Constitution prohibits the imposition of the death penalty when it is either excessive or disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  State v. Copeland, 278 S.C. 572, 590, 300 S.E.2d 63, 74 (1982).Â  In conducting a proportionality review, we search for similar cases in which the death sentence has been upheld.Â  Id.; S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(E) (2003).\r\nAfter reviewing the entire record, we conclude that the sentence in this case was not the result of passion, prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor.Â  Furthermore, a review of similar prior cases illustrates that imposing the death sentence in this case would be neither excessive nor disproportionate in light of the crime and the defendant.Â  See State v. Huggins, 336 S.C. 200, 205, 519 S.E.2d 574, 577 (1999) (holding that the death penalty was warranted where defendant robbed and shot the victim); State v. Hicks, 330 S.C. 207, 219, 499 S.E.2d 209, 216\r\n(1998) (holding that the death penalty was proper where the defendant robbed the victim and stabbed him numerous times in the neck, chest, and abdomen); and State v. Byram, 326 S.C. 107, 120, 485 S.E.2d 360, 367 (1997) (holding that death sentence was proper where the defendant entered the victimâ€™s home, stabbed her to death, and stole the victimâ€™s handbag and automobile).\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we affirm.\r\n MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  PLEICONES, J.,Â  dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  In 1988, twelve years before he murdered Benton Smith, appellant brutally assaulted two young men in a parking lot.Â  He pled guilty to two counts of assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN), and received a Youthful Offender Act sentence.Â  During this capital resentencing proceeding, the State introduced, without objection, graphic testimony from two eyewitnesses to the assault of the second ABHAN victim,[4] including one witness who observed appellant stomping on the unconscious victimâ€™s head.Â  The second witness testified he saw appellant drag the prostrate victim by the hair, then kneel to punch him five or six times, then rise and kick and stomp the unconscious victim.\r\nThe State then called one of the victimsâ€™ mothers to testify, and appellant objected on the grounds of relevance at a sidebar.[5]Â  The objection was overruled, and the mother testified to receiving the call telling her to come to the hospital and the injuries to her son that she observed when she arrived.Â  Over another relevancy objection, the State was permitted to introduce a photo of the victim taken while he was in intensive care.Â  The mother was permitted to testify extensively to the details of her sonâ€™s time in the hospital, his subsequent stay in a head trauma rehabilitation facility, and the lingering effects of the beating.\r\nThis motherâ€™s testimony was followed by that of her son.Â  Appellantâ€™s objection at a sidebar, again on the ground of relevancy, was overruled and the victim was permitted to relate a dream he had had while hospitalized about being chased by â€œBlack Indians.â€Â  The State then called, over another unsuccessful relevancy objection, the mother of the second victim.Â  This woman testified, as had the first mother, to her observations of her sonâ€™s injuries, recovery, rehabilitation, and residual problems.\r\nI agree with the majority that evidence of a defendantâ€™s prior criminal record is admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding because it is relevant evidence of the defendantâ€™s character.Â  The Constitution requires that the decision whether to impose a death sentence be â€œan individualized determination [made] on the basis of the character of the individual and the circumstances of the crime.â€Â  Zant v. Stephens, 462 U.S. 862, 879 (1983) (italics in original).Â  Further, I agree that, in furtherance of the juryâ€™s understanding of the defendantâ€™s character, the State should not be limited to merely presenting the fact of the prior conviction as it would be were the purpose to impeach the defendantâ€™s veracity.Â  See State v. Gregg, 230 S.C. 222, 95 S.E.2d 255 (1956).Â  I do not agree, however, that the extensive testimony admitted here, from eyewitnesses, victims, and relatives of the victims of offenses wholly unrelated to the capital offense, are relevant to the issue of the appellantâ€™s character.Â  Nor can I agree that the dream of a victim of a prior crime is, under any stretch of the imagination, relevant to â€œthe character of the individual or the circumstances of the [capital] crime.â€ Zant, supra.\r\nThe Constitution permits the sentencing authority to consider â€œthe specific harm caused by the crime in questionâ€ through the Stateâ€™s introduction of â€œevidence about the victim and about the impact of the murder on the victimâ€™s familyâ€ because such evidence is relevant to the â€œdefendantâ€™s moral culpability and blameworthinessâ€ as it relates to the capital murder.Â  Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808 (1991).Â  In other words, this type of evidence is admissible because it is relevant to the circumstances of the crime, not because it is relevant to the defendantâ€™s character.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\nI agree with the majority that the Stateâ€™s evidence in this case cannot be characterized as victim-impact evidence under Payne since it does not relate to the murder victim or his family.Â  In fairness to appellantâ€™s attorneys, however, they concede that this evidence would have been admissible under Payne if related to the capital crime rather than to these unrelated prior offenses.Â  Specifically, appellantâ€™s trial objection was to the evidence â€œas being inappropriate, victim impact type information and having nothing to do with the particular trial that [appellant] is on trial for now.â€Â  Moreover, appellantâ€™s attorney in this appeal concedes this type of evidence may be admissible as it relates to the victim of the capital crime, but argues â€œ[t]here is no language in Payne authorizing victim impact evidence on unrelated crimes â€¦.â€ Â I agree with appellant that the trial court erred in admitting this irrelevant evidence.Â  \r\nThe Constitution limits even valid victim-impact evidence where it is unduly inflammatory or renders the sentencing proceeding fundamentally unfair.Â  Payne, supra (Justice Oâ€™Connor, concurring).Â  Here, the capital sentencing jury was overwhelmed with evidence of appellantâ€™s â€œmoral culpability and blameworthiness,â€ not for the murder of Benton Smith, but for the brutal beatings of two young men.[6]Â  In my opinion, the Stateâ€™s presentation of this evidence denied appellant a fair sentencing and encouraged the jury to impose a death sentence on an improper basis.Â  Zant, supra (character of the defendant and circumstances of the capital crime are relevant to determining sentence).\r\nI therefore dissent from the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm appellantâ€™s sentence.\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant urges us to reconcile a perceived conflict between Hill and our opinion in Appellantâ€™s first appeal before this Court.Â  As we stated in Hill, Bennett did not determine the appropriateness of the â€œgo with the majority question.â€Â  Hill, 361 S.C. at 309, 604 S.E.2d 702.Â  In fact, the only issue in Bennett was whether the questioned juror was â€œunbiased, impartial, and able to carry out the law as executed.â€Â  Id.Â  Although Appellant properly points out that the court might never have discovered the juror in his first trial without the â€œgo with the majorityâ€ question, it is equally true that no amount of questioning can provide a clear picture of a jurorâ€™s biases or tendencies.Â  Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412, 424-25 (1985).Â  â€œ[T]hese veniremen may not know how they will react when faced with imposing the death sentence, or may be unable to articulate, or may wish to hide their true feelings.â€Â  Id.Â  This position is strengthened by our previous recognition of the trial judgeâ€™s duty to focus voir dire upon matters enumerated in the death penalty statutes and to eliminate excessive intrusions into the privacy of prospective jurors.Â  State v. Plath, 281 S.C. 1, 7, 313 S.E.2d 619, 622 (1984) (citing State v. Koon, 278 S.C. 528, 532, 298 S.E.2d 769, 771 (1982)).Â  \r\n[2] Academically, South Carolina has long recognized that information about prior convictions is admissible in a capital sentencing proceeding.Â  See State v. Gaskins, 284 S.C. 105, 124, 326 S.E.2d 132, 143 (1985); and State v. Plath, 281 S.C. at 9, 313 S.E.2d at 623 (stating that this rule is so fundamental that it requires no citation of authority).Â  This rule is derived from the principle that receiving evidence of prior crimes is probative of the character of the defendant and consistent with the sentencing authorityâ€™s duty to â€œconduct an inquiry broad in scope, largely unlimited either as to the kind of information he may consider, or the source from which it may come.â€Â  Dawson v. Delaware, 503 U.S. 159, 164 (1992); see also State v. Skipper, 285 S.C. 42, 47, 328 S.E.2d 58, 61 (1985) (overruled on other grounds 476 U.S. 1 (1986)).Â  Appellant has not challenged this rule, and indeed, Appellant has made no discussion of these authorities (upon which the trial court directly relied).\r\n[3] This conclusion makes an analysis of Nasim, Toyota and Dialâ€™s exception to the contemporaneous objection rule unnecessary.Â  \r\n[4]Both victims were lying motionless in the parking lot, â€œobviously injured.â€Â  The scene was quite bloody.\r\n[5] The judge later put the grounds of the objection on the record.\r\n[6] This evidence was exploited by the solicitor in his closing argument.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26175","title":"Burriss v.

[2] \r\nThe County Boardâ€™s budgetary review authority dates at least as far back as 1950.Â  See 1950 S.C. Acts 868, Â§ 38.[3]Â  This authority over the budget was referenced again in 1982 when the Legislature provided that: \r\n\r\nthe Anderson County Board of Education shall be vested with the power to review and approve the budget of the school districts and shall further be vested with the power to review an approve requests by the school districts for any increase or decrease in taxation or millage in keeping with the needs of each school district and the requirements of the â€¦ Education Finance Act.\r\n\r\n1982 S.C. Acts 510, Â§ 9.Â  That same year, another Act authorized an advisory referendum in Anderson County to determine if the electors of the County favored an elected County Board of Education with review authority over the local elected school district boardsâ€™ budgets. Â 1982 S.C. Acts 511, Â§ 1.Â  The voters overwhelmingly endorsed the County Boardâ€™s review authority. [4] \r\nNevertheless, the County Board has not often exercised its authority over the individual districtsâ€™ budgets, but instead has generally approved the budgets submitted by the districts.Â  From 1997-2002, a total of 29 budgets were submitted to the County Board by the five school districts, and the County Board approved 28 of them.Â  However, the County Board did not approve District Fiveâ€™s proposed budget for the 2001-2002 school year.Â  This proposed budget, which had been approved by District Fiveâ€™s Board of Trustees, was in the amount of $63,274,082.Â  The County Board ultimately reduced District Fiveâ€™s 2001-2002 budget by $750,000.Â  Eight of the nine County Board members voted for this reduction.\r\nIn addition to its budgetary review function, the County Board also serves other functions.Â  For example, the County operates and finances an Alternative School that is open to any child in Anderson County.Â  The Alternative School is designed to serve students with special needs such as chronic discipline and truancy problems.Â  District Five students attend the County-run Alternative School. \r\nThe County Board also administers the following programs:Â  (1) food service programs to Districts One, Two, Three, and Four; (2) mental health counseling to students in Districts One, Two, Three, and Four, as well as the Alternative School; and (3) attendance monitoring and dropout prevention services to students in Districts One, Two, Three, and Four, and the Alternative School. Â Although these programs are not administered to District Five, it appears from the Record on Appeal this is because the District has opted to provide its own district-run programs.[5]Â  \r\nFinally, the County Board administers the county-wide equalization tax.Â  This equalization tax, in practice, amounts to a levy of 14.7 mills which is imposed and collected uniformly on the Countyâ€™s assessed value and is then distributed by the County Board to the local districts based upon student average daily membership.Â  According to the County Boardâ€™s Administrator, the equalization tax is a â€œcounty-wide effort to spread the Countyâ€™s wealth in an effort to see that per pupil spending does not vary too dramatically from district to district.â€ [6] \r\nOther than their involvement with the County Board in the budget process, the five local school districts are generally autonomous in other areas of school governance, such as the hiring and firing of teachers, setting guidelines for student discipline, and creating extracurricular student activities.Â  The school districts perform these functions without interference from, or supervision by, the County Board.Â  \r\nAppellant William Mack Burriss is the chairman of the Anderson County School District Five Board of Trustees, and he resides in District Five.Â  Appellant E. Lee McPherson is the chairman of the Anderson County School District Four Board of Trustees, and he resides in District Four.Â  District Five itself is the third appellant in this case.Â  In 2002, these appellants brought a declaratory action in circuit court against the County Board, as well as the following â€œStateâ€ respondents: the Governor, the Lieutenant Governor, and the Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nAppellants and the County Board subsequently filed cross-motions for summary judgment.Â  In April 2004, the circuit court granted the County Boardâ€™s summary judgment motion and dismissed the complaint as to the County Board and the State respondents.Â  The circuit court found that the statutory scheme giving the County Board review authority over District Fiveâ€™s budget was constitutional.Â  The circuit court further ruled that Anderson Countyâ€™s two-tiered governance system did not violate the South Carolina Constitutionâ€™s bans against: (1) taxation without representation; and (2) non-uniform taxation.Â  See S.C.

Â Equal Protection\r\nAppellants argue that Anderson Countyâ€™s two-tiered school governance system creates an â€œover-inclusive franchiseâ€ which dilutes the voting rights of those residing in District Four and Five.Â  Specifically, appellants contend that because the budgets and tax rates for these districts are ultimately determined by the County Board, which contains members who are elected by voters who live outside Districts Four and Five, the strength of their own votes is diluted.Â  Appellants assert that this vote dilution runs afoul of the federal Equal Protection Clauseâ€™s[7] principle of â€œone person, one vote.â€Â  We disagree.\r\nThis Court reviews the grant of a summary judgment motion under the same standard as the trial court pursuant to Rule 56(c), SCRCP:Â  summary judgment is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.Â  E.g., Dawkins v. Fields, 354 S.C. 58, 69, 580 S.E.2d 433, 438-39 (2003).\r\nUnder the South Carolina Constitution, the Legislature is charged with â€œprovid[ing] for the maintenance and support of a system of free public schools open to all children in the State.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. XI, Â§ 3.Â  The Legislature â€œhas wide discretion in determining how to go about accomplishing [this] duty.â€ Â Horry County Sch. Dist. v. Horry County, 346 S.C. 621, 632, 552 S.E.2d 737, 743 (2001).Â  Furthermore, â€œ[a]ll statutes are presumed constitutional and will, if possible, be construed so as to render them valid.â€Â  Id. at 631, 552 S.E.2d at 742.Â  \r\nWithout question, equal protection guarantees â€œone person, one vote.â€Â  Gray v. Sanders, 372 U.S. 368, 381 (1963).Â  The United States Supreme Court has recognized that an absolute ban on the franchise is not the only way a citizenâ€™s voting right can be abridged:Â  â€œthe right of suffrage can be denied by a debasement or dilution of the weight of a citizenâ€™s vote just as effectively as by wholly prohibiting the free exercise of the franchise.â€Â  Reynolds v. Sims, 377 U.S. 533, 555 (1964).Â  Indeed, â€œvote dilution is as nefarious as an outright prohibition on voting.â€ Â Duncan v. Coffee County, Tenn., 69 F.3d 88, 93 (6th Cir. 1995).\r\nNonetheless, in the local government context, â€œnormal public policy makingâ€ of the State can include expanding the franchise beyond the required electorate provided no unconstitutional vote dilution results.Â  Id. at 94.Â  Moreover, the courts have observed that â€œoverinclusiveness is less of a constitutional evil than underinclusiveness.â€Â  Sutton v. Escambia County Bd. of Educ., 809 F.2d 770, 775 (11th Cir. 1987); accord Duncan, 69 F.3d at 98.[8]\r\nThe federal courts generally have applied rational basis review to evaluate this type of overinclusion, or expanded electorate, claim.Â  For example, the Eleventh Circuit has stated that â€œ[t]he party seeking to exclude â€¦ residents from voting in the county school board elections has the burden of demonstrating that the application of the [State] statute â€¦ is irrational or wholly irrelevant to the stateâ€™s objective of electoral participation in the selection of county school board members.â€Â  Sutton, 809 F.2d at 772; see also Duncan, 69 F.3d at 95 (discussing Sutton standard with approval).Â  But see Locklear v. North Carolina State Bd. of Elections, 514 F.2d 1152 (4th Cir. 1975) (applying compelling state interest standard).[9]\r\nThe federal courts have determined whether the State statute survives this rational basis standard by further inquiring whether the expanded electorate has a â€œsubstantial interestâ€ in the operation of the relevant school system. Â E.g., Duncan, 69 F.3d at 95; Phillips v. Andress, 634 F.2d 947 (5th Cir. 1981); Creel v. Freeman, 531 F.2d 286 (5th Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 429 U.S. 1066 (1977).Â  Moreover, the Duncan court noted that four factors have emerged to determine substantial interest:\r\n\r\n1. The degree to which one district is financing the other; \r\n2. The voting strength of the non-resident voters; \r\n3. The number of, or potential for, cross-over students; and\r\n4. The existence of any joint programs.\r\n\r\nDuncan, 69 F.3d at 96.Â  \r\nNevertheless, the Sixth Circuit in Duncan observed that the substantial interest test has been difficult â€œto apply consistently,â€ id. at 95, and the several federal cases have had divergent results.Â  Compare Duncan, Sutton, and Creel (all finding that the city residents had a substantial interest in the operation of the county school system thereby justifying their votes in county school board elections) with Hogencamp v. Lee County Bd. of Ed., 722 F.2d 720 (11th Cir. 1984), Phillips, and Locklear (all holding that the city residents did not have a substantial interest in the operation of the county school system thereby diluting the voting strength of the other county residents).Â  One commentator has noted the fact-specific nature of these cases:\r\n\r\nThe overlapping school district disputes have generated an unusual series of local voting cases in which both the stateâ€™s interest in structuring local governments and the primary local constituencyâ€™s interest in avoiding dilution have been weighed and the disputes have been resolved through a fact-sensitive consideration of the extent of city involvement in county schools.\r\n\r\nBriffault, 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 398.\r\nWe concur with the majority of federal courts that have faced this issue the appropriate inquiry in an expanded electorate case is the rational basis test.Â  Thus, to prevail, appellants must demonstrate that the Stateâ€™s decision to structure the Anderson County public education system as a two-tiered system which vests the County Board with review authority over the individual districtsâ€™ budgets is irrational.Â  See Duncan, 69 F.3d at 95; Sutton, 809 F.2d at 772.Â  Moreover, this particular rational basis review appropriately focuses on whether the out-of-district voters have a substantial interest in the operation of the relevant school system.Â  See, e.g., Duncan, 69 F.3d at 95. Â Finally, because of the fact-intensive character of these cases, we note that while the Duncan factors often may be useful for the inquiry, they are not the exclusive factors to be taken into consideration.Â  We do, however, begin our analysis with the Duncan factors.\r\n1. The degree to which one district is financing the other\r\nAppellants argue this factor weighs in their favor since they claim Districts Four and Five are net donor districts.Â  However, appellants also argue that even if these Districts are net recipient districts, the amount is negligible when compared to the districtsâ€™ overall budgets, and therefore, would not weigh in favor of finding a substantial interest for the â€œextraterritorialâ€ voters.\r\nThe federal courts have often relied heavily on this factor.Â  See, e.g., Duncan, 69 F.3d at 96 (finding that because the City provided a substantial amount from its own sales and property taxes to the County, and the funds made up a â€œsizableâ€ portion of the recipientâ€™s budget (7.28%), the City votes were supported by a substantial interest); Hogencamp, 722 F.2d at 722 (finding that the Cityâ€™s contribution of money in the amount of 2.74% of the County boardâ€™s budget did not support a finding of substantial interest).Â  Yet, financial contribution is not determinative.Â  See Sutton, 809 F.2d at 774 (where the facts did not show the Cityâ€™s financial participation in the County, but did establish a strong relationship between the two school systems, the court held that City residents had substantial interest in operation of County school system and could vote in county school board elections).\r\nIn the instant case, there is an equalization tax which, in effect, spreads the wealth in Anderson County among the individual districts.Â  The equalization levyâ€™s goal is to create a financial in-flow to the districts that need more money, which necessarily will create an out-flow from wealthier districts.Â  Moreover, because this levy represents a County-wide effort to distribute the Countyâ€™s wealth, and appellants do not object to the formula, it appears all the Anderson County districts participate in the financing of one another which, consequently, indicates that the out-of-district voters have a substantial interest in the other districts.Â  We therefore agree with the circuit courtâ€™s conclusion that the equalization tax justifies County Boardâ€™s involvement with the districtsâ€™ budgets.\r\n2. The voting strength of the non-resident voters\r\nAppellants argue that because District Four is served by only one County Board member, and District Five â€œonlyâ€ has a controlling vote for three County Board seats, this factor weighs in their favor.Â  Appellants further claim that because the County Board has review authority over each district, and out-of-district residents collectively have more County Board votes than the single district affected by the County Boardâ€™s decision, this â€œcontrolâ€ amounts to unconstitutional vote dilution.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe underlying premise of a representative government is that citizens vote for a representative and that person then represents his or her constituents in the governing body.Â  However, appellants contend that because District Four and District Five are unable to attain majority control of the County Board, the County Boardâ€™s taxation power is rendered unconstitutional.Â  On the contrary, as the County Board points out, Districts Four and Five collectively wield significant influence in a County Board election, with both districts able to completely control four seats (out of nine) on the County Board, and District Five able to cast a substantial minority vote in another three seats.Â  This factor clearly favors the County Board.\r\n3. The number of, or potential for, cross-over students\r\nThe circuit court found that because the Countyâ€™s Alternative School serves students residing in all five school districts, â€œeducationÂ  in Anderson County is a collective undertaking and â€¦ county-wide involvement is warranted.â€Â  We agree that the Alternative School demonstrates that cross-over students exist in Anderson County. Â Because voters in all the districts have a substantial interest in this county-run school, this factor favors the County Board. \r\nAppellants maintain, however, that there is no student crossover between the school districts themselves, and therefore this shows no substantial interest on the part of the â€œextraterritorialâ€ voters.Â  The basic flaw in appellantâ€™s argument is that these â€œout-of-districtâ€ voters are not voting for the districtâ€™s own trustees, but rather for seats on the County Board.Â  Hence, the relevant inquiry is whether any cross-over students exist within the County, regardless of whether that is between the districts themselves or between a district and the County.Â  Because there is some evident cross-over, this factor weighs in favor of the â€œextraterritorialâ€ votersâ€™ substantial interest.\r\n4. The existence of any joint programs\r\nThe circuit court found that the County Board administers programs related to mental health counseling, food services, attendance monitoring, and dropout prevention.Â  Appellants, however, maintain there are no joint programs.Â  Their argument relies on the facts that the County Boardâ€™s programs are not joint vis-Ã -vis the districts and District Five does not receive these services.\r\nWe hold the circuit court correctly found that the County Boardâ€™s programs regarding mental health counseling, food services, attendance monitoring, and dropout prevention are evidence in support of this factor.Â  District Five apparently has chosen not to avail itself of any of these programs, but that should not weigh against the County Board or negate the programsâ€™ existence; these programs clearly affect the overwhelming majority of the school districts.\r\nMoreover, it is undisputed that the Alternative School is run by the County Board and it serves students from all five districts.Â  This is an additional joint program; the voters from all five districts clearly have a substantial interest in the Countyâ€™s operation of the Alternative School.\r\n5.Â  Other Relevant Factors\r\nIn addition to the four Duncan factors, the circuit court also noted â€œother county-wide interests that warrant county-wide involvementâ€ in the individual school districtsâ€™ budgets.[10]Â  \r\nThe circuit court found that the County Board provided â€œa number of fiscal services for the districtsâ€ related to tax collection and distribution, including the equalization tax.Â  The circuit court also noted the County Boardâ€™s review authority over the budgets. Â Finally, the circuit court found that every resident of a South Carolina county has a substantial interest in the education of the children of that particular county. Â In support of this latter finding, the circuit court cited the testimony of Dr. James Guthrie, a professor of public policy and education.Â  \r\nDr. Guthrie, provided deposition testimony as an expert on behalf of the County Board.Â  Dr. Guthrie stated that â€œ[a]ll the residents of Anderson County hold the prospect of benefiting from the educational programsâ€ in District Five because of what economists label â€œneighborhoodâ€ or â€œspilloverâ€ effects.Â  In Dr. Guthrieâ€™s opinion, the closer oneâ€™s proximity to someone in District Five, â€œthe greater or more intense the likelihood that spillover effectâ€ would pertain to that person.\r\nDr. Guthrie also testified that virtually every State he was familiar with, with the exception of Hawaii, had an intermediate government body between a State education department and a local school district; moreover, Dr. Guthrie stated that these intermediate bodies frequently have the authority to oversee the local school districtsâ€™ budget.Â  According to Dr. Guthrie, public policy supports the use of an intermediate body because it leads to â€œeconomy-of-scale,â€ i.e., a more efficient use of â€œotherwise scarce resources.â€Â  In addition, the intermediate body serves a regulatory function as an arm of the State.Â  Dr. Guthrie explained that this is â€œa part of trying to balance remote, centralized state government with, presumably, local and locally sensitive and responsive local school boardsâ€ which he believed was â€œa reasonable activity.â€ \r\nWe agree with the circuit court that in South Carolina it is not unreasonable for County residents to have a substantial interest in the education of other County residents, even if they reside in a different school district. Â Dr. Guthrieâ€™s â€œneighborhood effectsâ€ testimony amply supports this conclusion.Â  Moreover, as recognized by the circuit court, â€œthe county unit is an essential part of every South Carolinianâ€™s existence.â€ See S.C. Const. art. VIII, Â§ 7 (establishing Home Rule).Â  The various financial functions performed by the County Board, including those ministerial functions related to the equalization levy, clearly are rationally related to the Stateâ€™s objective in giving counties home rule and also are reasonably consistent with the Stateâ€™s decision to give the County Board budgetary review authority.\r\nIn sum, we hold that the Stateâ€™s authorization of a popularly elected County school board with review authority over the individual Anderson County school districtsâ€™ budgets is neither â€œirrationalâ€ nor â€œwholly irrelevantâ€ to the Stateâ€™s goals in efficiently providing public education. Â Sutton, 809 F.2d at 772.Â  As the United States Supreme Court has noted, â€œ[t]he Constitution does not require that a uniform straitjacket bind citizens in devising mechanisms of local government suitable for local needs and efficient in solving local problems.â€ Â Avery v. Midland County, 390 U.S. 474, 485 (1968).Â  Furthermore, the Constitution should not be a â€œroadblock[] in the path of innovation, experiment, and development among units of local government.â€Â  Id.Â  The Stateâ€™s establishment of the two-tiered school governance in Anderson County does not result in vote dilution and therefore does not offend the Equal Protectionâ€™s guarantee of â€œone person, one vote.â€Â  Accordingly, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling on this issue.\r\nII.Â  No Taxation without Representation\r\nAppellants next argue that because the County Board votes on an individual school districtâ€™s budget and tax levy, yet the County Board does not directly, i.e. exclusively, represent just a single district, these tax decisions can never be â€œdirectly corrected by those who must carry the burden of the tax.â€ Â Crow v. McAlpine, 277 S.C. 240, 245, 285 S.E.2d 355, 358 (1981).Â  Appellants contend this violates Article X, Section 5 of the South Carolina Constitution.Â  We are unpersuaded by appellantsâ€™ argument.\r\nThe State Constitution provides that â€œ[n]o tax, subsidy or charge shall be established, fixed, laid or levied, under any pretext whatsoever, without the consent of the people or their representatives lawfully assembled.â€Â  S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 5.Â  This Court has held that the Legislature cannot, â€œconsistent with Article X, Section 5, delegate the unrestricted power of taxationâ€ to a County school board composed exclusively of members appointed by the Governor.Â  Crow v. McAlpine, 277 S.C. at 245, 285 S.E.2d at 358.Â  The Court in Crow v. McAlpine stated that â€œ[w]here the power is delegated to a body composed of persons not assented to by the people nor subject to the supervisory control of a body chosen by the people,â€ Article X, Section 5, is violated.Â  Id. at 244, 285 S.E.2d at 358 (emphasis added).Â  This Court has also noted that â€œ[d]elegation of the taxing power should be kept with supervisory control always vested in elective bodies.â€Â  Bradley v. Cherokee Sch. Dist. No. One of Cherokee County, 322 S.C. 181, 184, 470 S.E.2d 570, 571 (1996).\r\nIn the instant case, the taxation power at issue is vested in an elective body (the County Board) which is â€œchosen by the peopleâ€ of Anderson County.Â  Therefore, there is no violation Article X, Section 5 of the State constitution.Â  See Bradley; Crow v. McAlpine.\r\nThe County Board consists of nine seats elected by single member districts representing approximately 18,739 Anderson County residents.Â  The Legislature has authorized this popularly elected board with taxation authority.Â  See 1982 S.C. Acts 510, Â§ 9; 1950 S.C. Acts 868, Â§ 38.Â  Additionally, the people of Anderson County in the 1982 referendum overwhelmingly voted in favor of the County Board having review authority over the school districtsâ€™ budgets.Â  Finally, contrary to the appellantsâ€™ assertions, â€œthe power to fix and levyâ€ Anderson Countyâ€™s school tax has been appropriately conferred upon the County Board, which indeed is â€œa body which stands as the direct representative of the people, [such] that an abuse of power may be directly corrected by those who must carry the burden of the tax.â€ Â Crow v. McAlpine, 277 S.C. at 244-45, 285 S.E.2d at 358.\r\nRegarding this issue, the circuit court stated the following:Â  â€œThe mere fact that voters in the individual school districts directly elect fewer than all of the Board members who make decisions affecting those districts does not subject those voters to taxation without representation.â€Â  We agree and therefore affirm summary judgment on this issue as well.\r\nIII.Â  Uniform Taxation\r\nFinally, Appellants argue that the County Boardâ€™s review authority enables it to impose different tax levies on the five school districts in violation of the State Constitutionâ€™s general rule against non-uniform taxation.Â  See S.C. Const. art. X, Â§ 6.Â  We disagree.\r\nArticle X, section 6 of the South Carolina Constitution, entitled â€œAssessment and collection of taxes in political subdivisions,â€ reads as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly may vest the power of assessing and collecting taxes in all of the political subdivisions of the State. Property tax levies shall be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing such taxes; provided, that on properties located in an area receiving special benefits from the taxes collected, special levies may be permitted by general law applicable to the same type of political subdivision throughout the State, and the General Assembly shall specify the precise condition under which such special levies shall be assessed.\r\n\r\nId.\r\nAppellants maintain that because the County Board represents the political subdivision of the County, this constitutional provision prevents the County Board from making different assessments for the individual school districts which represent five different political subdivisions.Â  The County Board, on the other hand, asserts that the provisionâ€™s â€œspecial leviesâ€ exception to the uniformity requirement applies to the school districts because the districts receive the â€œspecial benefitsâ€ from the school taxes.Â  Specifically, the County Board argues that several state statutes establish the applicability of this exception, including S.C. Code Section 4-9-70, the Education Finance Act of 1977 (â€œEFAâ€), and the Education Improvement Act (â€œEIAâ€).[11]\r\nSection 4-9-70, which is part of the Home Rule Act, states that â€œthe county council shall determine by ordinance the method of establishing the school tax millage except in those cases where boards of trustees of the districts or the county board of education established such millage at the time â€¦ this chapter becomes effective.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 4-9-70 (1976) (emphasis added).Â  This Court discussed the legislative intent of section 4-9-70 in Stone v. Traynham, 278 S.C. 407, 297 S.E.2d 420 (1982): \r\n\r\nBy enacting Â§ 4- 9-70, the General Assembly attempted to insure that the taxing power for all school districts would be properly vested in some authority. The clear intent is to vest the power to determine the school tax levy in county council in all cases where it is not vested elsewhere.\r\n\r\nId. at 410, 297 S.E.2d at 422 (emphasis added).Â  This statute went into effect in 1975, well after the County Board had been authorized to set the school tax millage.Â  See 1950 S.C. Acts 868, Â§ 38.[12]\r\nBased on this Courtâ€™s statement on Section 4-9-70â€™s intent in Stone v. Traynham, it is clear the Legislature envisioned that the County Board would set different millage rates for the individual Anderson County school districts.Â  Furthermore, we agree with the County Board that both the EFA and the EIA inherently contemplate that millage rates will vary among school districts within a single county.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-30(6) (stating that one of the legislative purposes of the statute is to require each local school district â€œto contribute its fair shareâ€ relative to its â€œtaxpaying abilityâ€); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-21-1030 (local financial effort adjusted annually by inflation factor).Â  Given that these several statutes support the County Boardâ€™s argument that the special levies exception of Article X, Section 6 applies to school taxes, we affirm the circuit courtâ€™s summary judgment ruling on this issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons discussed above, the circuit courtâ€™s decision to grant the County Boardâ€™s summary judgment motion and to dismiss the complaint against all respondents is\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Anderson County School District Two extends into a part of Greenville County.\r\n[2] This is not a situation unique to Anderson County.Â  According to the Anderson County Administrator, 46 of South Carolinaâ€™s school districts must â€œgo to a higher body (legislative delegation, county council, or county board) to get their budgets approved, or to raise the millage beyond a certain point,â€ while 23 South Carolina school districts are â€œindependent.â€\r\n[3]  This section of Act 868 provides that the district Board of Trustees â€œshall certify to the County Board the amount of levy upon the taxable property in its district which â€¦ is necessary â€¦ for the proper operation of the schoolsâ€ and then â€œ[u]pon the County Board approving such levy â€¦ [the] Board shall notify the auditor of [Anderson] county the amount of such levy for such school district.â€Â  The Act further provides that if any individual school district â€œfails to certify the amount of such levy,â€ the County Board â€œshall determine the amount of such levy for such school district and notify the Auditor.â€ Â 1950 S.C. Acts 868, Â§ 38.\r\n[4] The results of the referendum were that 69 of the Countyâ€™s 74 precincts (93% of the precincts) voted yes.\r\n[5] For example, the brochure describing the County Boardâ€™s mental health program indicates it is open to District Five.Â  District Five, however, had its own pre-existing program to provide therapeutic services to students.Â  Furthermore, District Five provides its own attendance and school food service programs.\r\n[6] Appellants do not oppose the formula or the purpose of the equalization tax.Â  Appellants do, however, assert that District Five is a â€œnet donorâ€ in this equalization scheme.Â  The County Board, on the other hand, claims that District Five received more in equalization revenue than it paid in equalization taxes. \r\n[7] U.S. Const. amend. XIV, Â§ 1.\r\n[8] See also Richard Briffault, Who Rules at Home?: One Person/One Vote and Local Governments, 60 U. Chi. L. Rev 339, 396-400 (1993) (discussing â€œexpanded electorate/overlapping jurisdictionâ€ cases which involved claims that a State improperly extended the local franchise and thereby unconstitutionally diluted the primary local votes, but finding that most extensions of the franchise have been sustained).Â  \r\n[9] The strict scrutiny test employed in the Fourth Circuitâ€™s Locklear decision has not been followed by any other circuit. Â See Duncan, 69 F.3d at 94 (rejecting the Fourth Circuit standard â€œto the extent it still governsâ€).Â  Indeed, Locklear is recognized as â€œthe exception.â€Â  Briffault, 60 U. Chi. L. Rev. at 397 n.232.\r\n[10] We note that these considerations, while not contemplated by the Duncan factors, are relevant to the rational basis inquiry because, as explained above, the inquiry into the constitutionality of an expanded electorate is highly fact-specific.Â  \r\n[11] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-20-10 et seq. (2004) (EFA); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 59-21-1030 (2004) (EIA).Â  These statutes, inter alia, set minimums for local school district funding via formulas calculated annually.\r\n[12] Appellants assert that 1966 S.C. Acts 1080 establishes that the County Board did not have authority to set the school millage in 1975.Â  The 1966 Act provided that the Anderson County school districts could not increase the tax levy more than five mills in a year without a referendum.Â  We agree with the County Board that this legislative act simply set a maximum millage increase but did not affect the County Boardâ€™s review authority which was established as early as 1950 and has been subsequently referenced by the Legislature.Â  See 1950 S.C. Acts 868, Â§ 38; 1982 S.C. Acts 510, Â§ 9; see also 1989 S.C. Acts 269, Â§ 1(B) (stating that the districts shall annually â€œrecommendâ€ to the County Board the amount of tax millage needed for the budget).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26176","title":"In the Matter of Henry H.
