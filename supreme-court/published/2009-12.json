Martin, Jr., both of Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: In\r\n  this case, Petitioners challenged the results of a municipal election based on\r\n  irregularities discovered in the voting rolls.Â  The county election board voted\r\n  to hold a new election, and Respondents appealed to the State Election\r\n  Commission.Â  The Commission overturned the decision of the county election\r\n  board, and we granted Petitionersâ€™ petition for writ of certiorari to review\r\n  that decision.Â  Â Â \r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nOn\r\n  November 4, 2008, an election was held for two seats on the Bluffton Town\r\n  Council.Â  Respondents Fred Hamilton, Jr., and Allyne Mitchell (together\r\n  â€œRespondentsâ€) were declared the winners of the election with 1,553 and 1,449\r\n  votes, respectively.Â  Petitioners Jeff Fulgham and Normand Thomas (together\r\n  â€œPetitionersâ€) received 1,423 and 796 votes, respectively.Â  \r\nOn November\r\n  6, 2008, Fulgham filed a letter of protest with the Beaufort County Board of\r\n  Elections and Voter Registration (â€œCounty Boardâ€), seeking a new election.Â \r\n  Fulgham alleged that approximately one-hundred eligible voters had not been\r\n  allowed to vote.Â  A hearing was held before the County Board the next day.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Fulgham called Charlie Wetmore, candidate for Town of Bluffton\r\n  Mayor, to testify.Â  Wetmore testified that he received calls from voters\r\n  telling him they had not been allowed to vote.Â  Agnes Garvin, Executive\r\n  Director of the County Board, testified that her review of the voter rolls\r\n  after the election revealed that there were one hundred sixty-six (166)\r\n  â€œcodingâ€ irregularities.[1]Â \r\n  Garvin could not testify as to how many non-residents had been allowed to\r\n  vote.Â  No individual voters were called to testify that they had been\r\n  disenfranchised and no allegations were made regarding specific non-resident\r\n  voters who were allowed to vote in the municipal elections.Â  \r\nBased\r\n  upon this testimony, the County Board voted to hold a new election for mayor\r\n  and town council on November 18, 2008.Â  Respondents appealed to the South\r\n  Carolina State Election Commission (â€œthe Commissionâ€).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Commission held a hearing on December 3, 2008.Â  Petitioners argued that the\r\n  Commission lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review the County Board\r\n  decision, but that the evidence below supported a ruling on the merits in their\r\n  favor.Â  The Commission assumed jurisdiction and voted to sustain the election\r\n  results and reverse the County Board decision to order a new election on the\r\n  grounds that it was supported by insufficient evidence.Â  Petitioners filed a\r\n  petition for a writ of certiorari, and we granted certiorari to review the\r\n  following question:[2]\r\nDid the\r\n  Commission have subject matter jurisdiction to hear an appeal from a decision\r\n  of the County Board?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nIn municipal election cases, this Court will review the lower\r\n  decision for errors of law, and will not overturn findings of fact unless those\r\n  findings are wholly unsupported by the evidence.Â  Gecy v. Bagwell, 372\r\n  S.C. 237, 241, 642 S.E.2d 569, 571 (2007).Â  \r\nLAW/ANALYSIS \r\nPetitioners argue that the Commission lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to review the decision of the County Board when the County Board\r\n  adjudicated a municipal election dispute.Â  We agree.\r\nSubject matter jurisdiction is defined as â€œthe power [of a court]\r\n  to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings in\r\n  question belong.â€ Â Dove v. Gold Kist, Inc., 314 S.C. 235, 237-38, 442\r\n  S.E.2d 598, 600 (1994). Â Issues related\r\n  to subject matter jurisdiction may be raised at any time.Â  Carter v. State, 329 S.C. 355, 362,\r\n  495 S.E.2d 773, 777 (1998). Â The\r\n  lack of subject matter jurisdiction may not be waived, even by consent of the\r\n  parties, and should be taken notice of by this Court. Â Anderson v.\r\n  Anderson, 299 S.C. 110, 115, 382 S.E.2d 897, 900 (1989).\r\nAs a\r\n  general matter, municipal election disputes are to be adjudicated by municipal\r\n  election commissions.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-130 (2004).Â  Appeals from\r\n  municipal election commissions are heard by the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 5-15-140 (2004).\r\nCounty\r\n  boards are directed by statute to â€œdecide all cases under protest or contest\r\n  that arise in their respective counties in the case of county officers and less\r\n  than county offices, except for primaries and municipal elections.â€Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 7-17-30 (Supp. 2008).Â  However, municipalities that choose not to\r\n  establish their own election commissions are authorized to transfer the\r\n  authority to conduct their municipal elections to the county election\r\n  commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-145(A) (2004).Â  The statute requires that in\r\n  order to effectuate this transfer, the governing bodies of the municipality and\r\n  the county must agree to the terms of the transfer and enact ordinances\r\n  embodying the terms of the agreement.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-145(B) (2004).Â \r\n  The municipal ordinance must state what authority is being transferred and the\r\n  county ordinance must accept the authority being transferred.Â  Id.Â  If only a portion of the municipalityâ€™s authority for election oversight is\r\n  transferred to the county, the municipality must maintain its own election\r\n  commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-145(D) (2004).Â  \r\nBeaufort Countyâ€™s ordinance accepting the transfer of municipal\r\n  election authority from the Town of Bluffton provides: [3]\r\n(a) The [County Board] accepts the transfer of authority to\r\n  conduct all general and special elections of the Town of Bluffton.Â  The Town of\r\n  Bluffton Municipal Elections transfers to the [County Board] the following\r\n  authority, responsibilities, and agreement for reimbursement of expenses\r\n  associated with conducting the Town of Blufftonâ€™s General and Special Municipal\r\n  Elections:\r\n.Â  .Â  .Â  . \r\n(c) The [County Board] shall designate all polling places, the\r\n  inspection and visitation of polls during election day, the recruitment and\r\n  assignment of poll managers, securing telephones for the polling precincts, the\r\n  hearing of challenged \r\nballots and ruling on any protests and/or complaints regarding the\r\n  election or its procedures, and the certification of the election results.Â  \r\nBeaufort County\r\n  Code of Ordinances Â§ 30-3 (emphasis added).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  mentioned above, appeals from municipal election commissions are to be filed in\r\n  circuit court.Â  Section 5-15-140.Â  Appeals from county election boards are to\r\n  be made to the South Carolina State Election Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  7-17-60 (2004).Â  However, these statutes do not speak to the question of where\r\n  an appeal must be filed from a judgment on a municipal election dispute that is\r\n  decided by a county election board.Â Â  \r\nPetitioners\r\n  argue that there is an ambiguity in the statute and the clear intent of the\r\n  legislature in drafting these statutes was to prevent challenges of municipal\r\n  elections from being considered by the Commission.Â  Petitionersâ€™ contention can\r\n  be summarized to say that when a county board hears a municipal election\r\n  dispute pursuant to a transfer of authority, the county board â€œstands in the\r\n  shoesâ€ of the municipality.Â  \r\n Respondents\r\n  contend that because the Town of Bluffton does not have its own process for\r\n  appealing from an election, the County Boardâ€™s process controls.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  Respondents argue that they filed an appeal with the Commission at the direction\r\n  of the Executive Director of the County Board, and that Petitioners failed to\r\n  object to jurisdiction at the hearing.\r\nWe find\r\n  Petitionersâ€™ argument persuasive for two reasons.Â  First, just as subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction cannot be waived or conferred by agreement of the parties\r\n  to an action, it cannot be conferred at the direction of a county official.Â  Brown\r\n  v. State, 343 S.C. 342, 346,\r\n  540 S.E.2d 846, 848 (2001). Â Furthermore, subject matter jurisdiction may also\r\n  be raised at any time, and it is properly contested in this appeal even if it\r\n  was not raised below.Â  Id.Â  \r\n Second,\r\n  we find a statutory ambiguity exists.Â  The cardinal rule of statutory\r\n  construction is to ascertain the intent of the legislature.Â  Hodges v.\r\n  Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533 S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).Â  If a statuteâ€™s\r\n  language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\r\n  there is no occasion for employing rules of statutory interpretation and the\r\n  Court has no right to look for or impose another meaning.Â  Miller v. Doe,\r\n  312 S.C. 444, 447, 441 S.E.2d 319, 321 (1994).Â  However, where a statute is\r\n  ambiguous, the Court must construe the terms of the statute according to\r\n  settled rules of construction.Â  Lester v. S.C. Workersâ€™ Compensation Commâ€™n,\r\n  334 S.C. 557, 561, 514 S.E.2d 751, 752 (1999).Â  â€œIt is well settled that statutes dealing with the same\r\n  subject matter are in pari materia and must be construed together, if\r\n  possible, to produce a single, harmonious result.â€Â  Joiner ex rel. Rivas v.\r\n  Rivas, 342 S.C. 102, 109, 536 S.E.2d 372, 375 (2000).Â Â  \r\nOur\r\n  reading of the relevant statutes reveals a number of instances where\r\n  ambiguities arise.Â  First, although Â§ 5-15-145 establishes a clear framework\r\n  for the transfer of authority from municipalities to county election boards, it\r\n  fails to provide a procedure for protests and appeals in these circumstances.Â \r\n  Furthermore, while there are statutes setting forth the procedure for\r\n  contesting municipal election results, those statutes refer to contests filed\r\n  with, and the filing of appeals from, a municipal election system.Â  Lastly,\r\n  although a county board is authorized to assume the authority to conduct a\r\n  municipal election, it is specifically prohibited from deciding a protest or\r\n  contest arising from such an election.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-17-30.Â  \r\nWe must construe these statutes together to determine legislative\r\n  intent.Â  See Rivas, 342 S.C. at 109, 536 S.E.2d at 375.Â  We\r\n  begin our analysis with Â§ 7-17-30, which states plainly that county boards\r\n  cannot decide protests or contests arising from municipal elections.Â  Sections\r\n  5-15-130 and 5-15-140 also make it clear that the standard procedure for\r\n  contesting a municipal election is to file a protest with the municipal\r\n  election commission and thereafter seek review of that decision in the court of\r\n  common pleas.Â  \r\nThe construction urged by Respondents, in our view, would lead to\r\n  a result not intended by the legislature.Â  Specifically, Respondentsâ€™ position would\r\n  result in different methods of protest and appeal of municipal elections depending\r\n  on whether the municipalityâ€™s elections were conducted by a municipal election\r\n  commission or a county board.Â  \r\nConstruing these statutes together, we therefore hold that the\r\n  only reasonable interpretation of Â§ 5-15-145 is that it establishes a framework\r\n  whereby county boards act pursuant to authority bestowed upon them by municipal\r\n  bodies.Â  Therefore, the proper appellate court for any petitioner seeking\r\n  review of a county boardâ€™s decision made pursuant to a transfer of authority\r\n  from a municipality is the circuit court.Â  We therefore hold that Respondents\r\n  erroneously filed their notice of appeal with the Commission and hereby vacate\r\n  that decision.\r\nRecognizing the ambiguity in determining the proper appellate\r\n  tribunal in a municipal election protest initially submitted to a county board\r\n  and the fact that Respondents timely filed their notice of appeal with the\r\n  Commission, we elect to invoke Rule 204(a), SCACR.Â  Rule 204(a) provides that\r\n  â€œ[i]n the event that the notice of appeal is filed in the wrong appellate\r\n  court, the appellate court in which the matter is filed shall issue an order\r\n  transferring the case to the appropriate appellate court.â€Â  In invoking Rule\r\n  204(a), we are guided by the principle that courts should not interpret\r\n  procedural rules to create a trap for unwary lawyers.[4]Â  Vacating the judgment of the\r\n  Commission and transferring this case to the circuit court will serve the ends\r\n  of justice by ensuring that the election challenge is heard in the proper\r\n  appellate forum.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAccordingly, we declare the Commissionâ€™s decision void for lack of\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction.Â  We\r\n  vacate the judgment of the Commission and remand the matter to the Beaufort County circuit court for consideration of Respondentsâ€™ challenge to the decision of the\r\n  County Board. \r\nVACATED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In\r\n  my view, construction of the relevant statutes clearly leads to the conclusion\r\n  that the legislative intent is that county boards of elections shall not be\r\n  involved in municipal elections unless invited to do so by a particular\r\n  municipality.Â  County board involvement is limited to the extent of authority\r\n  granted by the municipality.Â  The authority granted to the county board of\r\n  elections is required to be evident in ordinances passed by both municipal and\r\n  county governing bodies.[5]\r\nI\r\n  find no ambiguity in the statutes or statutory scheme.Â  Appeals from municipal\r\n  election commissions are heard in the circuit court.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 5-15-140\r\n  (2004).Â  Appeals from county boards of elections are heard by the South\r\n  Carolina State Elections Commission.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 7-17-60 (2004).Â  The\r\n  Legislature is presumed to know that it authorized county boards to conduct\r\n  municipal elections when requested and agreed upon.Â  Yet, section 7-17-60 does\r\n  not include an exception for municipal elections appeals. \r\nThe\r\n  decision that the State Elections Commission did not have jurisdiction\r\n  disregards two points:\r\n1)Â  This\r\n  is an appeal of a county board's decision to the State Election Commission, and\r\n  there is no authority for the appeal of the county board's decision to the\r\n  circuit court.Â  The State Elections Commission has subject matter jurisdiction\r\n  to hear appeals from county boards. \r\n2)Â  The\r\n  conundrum created by section 7-17-30.Â  Bluffton does not have an elections\r\n  commission to hear protests or contests.Â  Section 7-17-30 prohibits county\r\n  boards from deciding protests and contests of municipal election.Â  Under the\r\n  majority's construction, Bluffton could transfer all aspects of its elections\r\n  process to the county board except for protests and contests.Â  Yet, section\r\n  5-15-145 authorizes a municipality to discontinue its elections commission when\r\n  it transfers all of its election functions to the county board.\r\nIn\r\n  my view, the legislative intent is that section 7-17-30's bar to county boards\r\n  deciding municipal election protests is not applicable to cases where the\r\n  municipality has transferred its elections authority to the county board.Â \r\n  Congruently, section 5-15-140 is not applicable and any appeal should be to the\r\n  State Elections Commission not to the circuit court.Â  Moreover, this is not an\r\n  appeal from a municipal election commission.Â  Section 5-15-140 only applies to\r\n  appeals from municipal elections commissions.\r\nThe\r\n  Town of Bluffton's elections were conducted by the Beaufort County Board of\r\n  Elections and Registration. Any appeal should be taken to the State Elections\r\n  Commission.Â  It is clear that the State Elections Commission has jurisdiction\r\n  to hear appeals from county boards of elections.\r\nA\r\n  holding that the State Election Commission lacked jurisdiction due to an\r\n  ambiguous statutory scheme is to create ambiguity where there is none and,\r\n  thus, complicates an otherwise clear and simple election process.\r\nI\r\n  would dismiss certification as improvidently granted. \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n[1] â€œCodingâ€ refers to the practice of denoting voters with a number to indicate\r\n  whether they lived in Bluffton and were eligible to vote in the municipal\r\n  elections.Â  \r\n[2] Petitioners also presented the question of\r\n  whether the Commission erred on the merits of its decision to overturn the\r\n  County Board.Â  However, because we find that this matter is foreclosed on the\r\n  issue of subject matter jurisdiction, we decline to answer that question here.\r\n[3] Both parties premised their arguments on the fact that the Town of Bluffton transferred all authority to conduct this municipal election to Beaufort County and that Beaufort County accepted this authority.Â  To be sure, neither party\r\n  has challenged the County Boardâ€™s authority to hear the election protest at any\r\n  point in this litigation.Â  What is at issue before us is in which tribunal\r\n  Respondents were required to file their appeal.Â  For this reason, although the\r\n  dissent is correct in stating that courts will not take judicial notice of a\r\n  municipal ordinance, this principal of law is simply not applicable under the\r\n  facts of this case.Â  Compare Harkins v. Greenville County, 340 S.C. 606,\r\n  616, 533 S.E.2d 886, 891 (2000)Â  (declining to take judicial notice of an\r\n  ordinance regarding zoning appeals which was not included in the record where\r\n  such ordinance could have invalidated the challenged ordinance) and Kincaid v. Landing Dev. Corp., 289 S.C. 89, 92-93, 344 S.E.2d 869, 872 (Ct. App. 1986) (holding the trial court erred in charging the jury that violations of a standard building code is negligence per\r\n  se where plaintiffs failed to offer evidence that the municipality passed\r\n  an ordinance adopting the building code because courts will not take judicial\r\n  notice of an ordinance).Â  \r\n[4] Elam v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772 (2004)\r\n  (holding civil procedure\r\n  and appellate rules should not be written or interpreted to create a trap for\r\n  the unwary lawyer or party); Gamble v. State, 298 S.C. 176, 178, 379\r\n  S.E.2d 118, 119 (1989) (stating rules applicable to post-conviction relief\r\n  actions should not be construed in manner which operate as a trap for the\r\n  unwary lawyer).\r\n[5]Â  The record before us does not contain a Town of\r\n  Bluffton ordinance authorizing the County Board of Elections and Registration\r\n  to conduct Bluffton's elections.Â  This is problematical to Appellant's case\r\n  given this Court is not allowed to take judicial notice of a municipal\r\n  ordinance.Â  Instead, the ordinance must be proved before the lower court or\r\n  tribunal.Â  Steinberg v.

Clinton, brought this action\r\n  alleging claims for wrongful death and survival against Ebenezer Senior\r\n  Services and Rehabilitation Center (â€œEbenezerâ€).Â  The trial court granted\r\n  summary judgment in favor of Ebenezer, finding the claims were untimely\r\n  asserted.Â  The South Carolina Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer\r\n    Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., 377 S.C. 217, 659 S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  This Court granted Hooperâ€™s petition for a writ of certiorari.Â  We now\r\n  reverse and remand.\r\nI.Â  FACTS\r\nThe facts, in the light most\r\n  favorable to Hooper, are as follows.[1]Â \r\n  Ebenezer was a nursing home located in York County.Â  In February 2003, Albert\r\n  L. Clinton was placed at Ebenezer by his family.Â  When he was admitted, Clinton had been diagnosed with short- and long-term memory deficits and impaired\r\n  decision-making ability.Â  Ebenezer was on notice that Clinton was at risk for\r\n  the development of decubitus ulcers[2] and that he had to be given proper nutrition and be repositioned every two\r\n  hours to avoid this condition.Â  \r\nWithin three weeks of his\r\n  admission to Ebenezer, Clinton developed severe decubitus ulcers.Â  In April\r\n  2003, Clinton was admitted to Piedmont Medical Center in Rock Hill, South\r\n  Carolina, where he was diagnosed with dehydration, hypernatremia[3],\r\n  and severe decubitus ulcers.Â  As a result of the allegedly negligent treatment\r\n  at Ebenezer, Clinton was transferred to another long-term care facility in May\r\n  2003.Â  Clinton died on May 15, 2003.Â Â Â  \r\nOn February 6, 2006, Hooper\r\n  filed with the York County Court of Common Pleas a summons and complaint in\r\n  which she alleged substandard care and treatment rendered by Ebenezer contributed\r\n  to Clintonâ€™s death.Â  She asserted claims for wrongful death and survival. Â It\r\n  is undisputed by the parties that the statute of limitations on these claims\r\n  began to run upon Clintonâ€™s death on May 15, 2003 and expired three years later\r\n  on May 15, 2006.Â  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-530 (2005) (providing\r\n  a three-year statute of limitations period for the claims enumerated therein).Â  \r\nAccording to an affidavit\r\n  prepared by Hooperâ€™s attorney and supporting documents, in order to effectuate\r\n  service Hooperâ€™s attorney called the number for Ebenezer and was told that the\r\n  business had been sold and it was now â€œAgape Rehabilitation.â€Â  Hooperâ€™s\r\n  attorney drove by the building where Ebenezer had been located and saw a sign\r\n  identifying the premises as â€œAgape Rehabilitation of Rock Hill.â€Â Â Â  \r\nThe attorney searched the\r\n  website for the South Carolina Secretary of State and found Ebenezer was listed\r\n  as a business in good standing with a registered agent (Jack G. Hendrix, Jr.)\r\n  located at 1415 Richland Street, Columbia, South Carolina.Â  On February 8,\r\n  2006, the attorney forwarded the pleadings to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Office for service upon the agent at the designated Columbia address.Â  At the\r\n  end of February or the beginning of March, the attorney received an Affidavit\r\n  of Non-Service from the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Office stating service was\r\n  not successful because the agent had moved to an unknown address.Â  Â Â \r\nThe attorney then hired a\r\n  private investigator, who found a personal address for the agent.Â  On March 21,\r\n  2006, the attorney mailed the pleadings to the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Office\r\n  for a second attempt at service upon the agent.Â  On April 10, 2006, the\r\n  Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Office returned the pleadings and advised the\r\n  attorney that the address was in Lexington County and therefore was not within\r\n  its jurisdiction.Â Â Â  \r\nImmediately thereafter on\r\n  April 13, 2006, approximately one month before the three-year statute of\r\n  limitations was due to expire, the attorney forwarded the pleadings to the\r\n  Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Office for service upon the registered agent.Â  The\r\n  attorney made numerous follow-up calls to the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Office\r\n  to determine the status of service and each time was told that the agent was\r\n  being served and that he would be notified when service was complete.Â  On June\r\n  12, 2006, after the statute of limitations had run, the attorney received an Affidavit\r\n  of Non-Service from the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Office informing him that they\r\n  had, in fact, been unable to effect service on the agent because â€œper [a]\r\n  neighbor [the] agt [agent] left his wife a year ago [and it is] unknown where\r\n  he lives now.â€Â  \r\nAccording to the attorney, he\r\n  then hired a private investigator to try to serve Agape Rehabilitation. Â An\r\n  Affidavit of Service and supporting documents indicate service was accomplished\r\n  on June 15, 2006 by a process server upon Janet Inkelaar, who indicated that\r\n  she was the Administrator of Agape Rehabilitation and that she was authorized\r\n  to accept service on behalf of Ebenezer.Â  Inkelaar stated Ebenezer had been\r\n  taken over by Agape Rehabilitation of Rock Hill in December 2004, but the two\r\n  businesses were â€œaffiliated.â€Â  \r\nEbenezer moved to dismiss\r\n  Hooperâ€™s action on the basis service was not completed before the running of\r\n  the three-year statute of limitations of section 15-3-530, nor within the time\r\n  limits of Rule 3(a)(2) of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure (SCRCP),\r\n  which requires that service be made within the statute of limitations or, if\r\n  made thereafter, that it be made within 120 days of filing the summons and\r\n  complaint.Â  Ebenezer alleged Hooperâ€™s decedent died on May 15, 2003; therefore,\r\n  the three-year statute of limitations expired on May 15, 2006.Â  In this case,\r\n  the summons and complaint were filed on February 6, 2006[4] and service was not effected until June 15, 2006, which was after the running\r\n  of the statute of limitations and more than 120 days after filing of the\r\n  summons and complaint.Â  \r\nThe parties submitted\r\n  affidavits and other materials, so the trial court converted the motion into\r\n  one for summary judgment.[5]Â \r\n  The trial court granted summary judgment to Ebenezer, finding Hooperâ€™s action\r\n  was not timely commenced because service did not occur within the statute of\r\n  limitations or within 120 days of filing the summons and complaint as required\r\n  by Rule 3(a)(2), SCRCP.Â Â  \r\nThe trial court rejected\r\n  Hooperâ€™s argument that the 120-day period should not begin running until the\r\n  last day of the statute of limitations, finding this conflicts with the clear\r\n  and unambiguous wording of Rule 3(a)(2).Â  The trial court also rejected\r\n  Hooperâ€™s arguments that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled\r\n  or that Ebenezer should be equitably estopped from asserting the statute of\r\n  limitations based on its failure to accurately list its registered agent for\r\n  service of process with the Secretary of State as required by state law.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed.Â  Hooper v. Ebenezer Senior Servs. &amp; Rehab. Ctr., 377 S.C. 217, 659\r\n  S.E.2d 213 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  We granted Hooperâ€™s petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\nII.Â  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â Â Â Â Â  Standard of Review\r\nRule 56(c) of the South\r\n  Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure provides that a trial court may grant a motion\r\n  for summary judgment only â€œif the pleadings, depositions, answers to\r\n  interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any,\r\n  show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving\r\n  party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  \r\nâ€œIn determining whether any\r\n  triable issues of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all\r\n  reasonable inferences that may be drawn from the\r\n  evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.â€Â  Brockbank v.\r\n    Best Capital Corp.,&nbsp;341 S.C. 372, 378-79, 534 S.E.2d 688,\r\n  692&nbsp;(2000).Â  An appellate court reviews the granting of summary judgment\r\n  under the same standard applied by the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  Id. at 379, 534 S.E.2d at 692.Â  \r\nB.Â Â Â Â Â  Equitable Tolling\r\nOn appeal, we first consider Hooperâ€™s\r\n  argument that the statute of limitations should be equitably tolled for the\r\n  delay in service that occurred while Hooper was trying to serve Ebenezerâ€™s\r\n  nonexistent agent.Â  Hooper asserts she was entitled to rely upon the public\r\n  records and Ebenezerâ€™s failure to name a viable registered agent with the South\r\n  Carolina Secretary of State as required by state law thwarted her repeated\r\n  attempts to effect service.Â  Hooper asserts that, under all the circumstances, it\r\n  would be inequitable for Ebenezer to be allowed to benefit from its conduct by\r\n  obtaining a complete dismissal of her claims.Â  We agree.\r\nâ€œâ€˜Tollingâ€™ refers to\r\n  suspending or stopping the running of a statute of limitations; it is analogous\r\n  to a clock stopping, then restarting.â€Â  51 Am. Jur. 2d Limitation of Actions Â§ 169 (2000).Â  â€œTolling may either temporarily suspend the running of the limitations\r\n  period or delay the start of the limitations period.â€Â  Id.\r\nÂ South Carolina law provides\r\n  for tolling of the applicable limitations period by statute in certain\r\n  circumstances.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 15-3-30 (2005) (stating exceptions to\r\n  the running of the statute of limitations when the defendant is out of the\r\n  state); id. Â§ 15-3-40 (providing exceptions for persons under a\r\n  disability, including being underage or insane).\r\nIn addition to these\r\n  statutory tolling mechanisms, however, â€œ[i]n order to serve the ends of justice\r\n  where technical forfeitures would unjustifiably prevent a trial on the merits,\r\n  the doctrine of equitable tolling may be applied to toll the running of the\r\n  statute of limitations.â€Â  54 C.J.S. Limitations of Actions Â§ 115Â  (2005).Â \r\n  â€œEquitable tolling is a nonstatutory tolling theory which suspends a\r\n  limitations period.â€Â  Ocana v. Am. Furniture Co., 91 P.3d 58, 66 (N.M.\r\n  2004).Â  \r\nEquitable tolling is judicially\r\n  created; it stems from the judiciaryâ€™s inherent power to formulate rules of\r\n  procedure where justice demands it.Â  Rodriguez v. Superior Court, 98\r\n  Cal. Rptr. 3d 728 (Ct. App. 2009).Â  â€œWhere a statute sets a limitation period\r\n  for action, courts have invoked the equitable tolling doctrine to suspend or extend the statutory period â€˜to ensure fundamental\r\n  practicality and fairness.â€™â€Â  Id. at 736 (citation omitted).\r\nThe party claiming the\r\n  statute of limitations should be tolled bears the burden of establishing\r\n  sufficient facts to justify its use.Â  Ocana, 91 P.3d at 65; see also 54 C.J.S. Limitations of Actions Â§ 115 (â€œThe party who seeks to invoke\r\n  equitable tolling bears the devoir of persuasion and must, therefore, establish\r\n  a compelling basis for awarding such relief.â€).Â  \r\nIt has been observed that\r\n  â€œ[e]quitable tolling typically applies in cases where a litigant was prevented\r\n  from filing suit because of an extraordinary event beyond his or her control.â€Â  Ocana, 91 P.3d at 66.Â  However, jurisdictions have considered tolling in\r\n  a variety of contexts and have developed differing parameters for its application.[6]Â  See, e.g., Irby v. Fairbanks Gold Mining, Inc.,&nbsp;203 P.3d\r\n  1138, 1143&nbsp;(Alaska 2009) (â€œUnder the doctrine of equitable tolling,\r\n  when a party has more than one legal remedy available, the statute of limitations is tolled while the party pursues one of\r\n  the possible remedies.â€); Abbott v. State,&nbsp;979 P.2d 994,\r\n  998&nbsp;(Alaska 1999) (â€œFederal precedent equitably tolls the limitations\r\n  period in three circumstances: Â (1)&nbsp;where the plaintiff has actively\r\n  pursued his or her judicial remedies by filing a timely but defective pleading; (2) where extraordinary\r\n  circumstances outside the plaintiffâ€™s control make it impossible for the\r\n  plaintiff to timely assert his or her claim; or (3) where the plaintiff, by exercising reasonable\r\n  diligence, could not have discovered essential information bearing on his or\r\n  her claim.â€ (footnotes omitted)); Kaplan v. Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.,\r\n  ___ A.2d ___, ___ (Vt. 2009) (2009 WL 2401952) (â€œEquitable tolling applies either\r\n  where the defendant is shown to have actively misled or prevented the plaintiff\r\n  in some extraordinary way from discovering the facts essential to the filing of\r\n  a timely lawsuit, or where the plaintiff has timely raised the same claim in the\r\n  wrong forum.â€ (citing Beecher v. Stratton Corp., 743 A.2d 1093, 1098\r\n  (Vt. 1999)); cf. Machules v. Depâ€™t of Admin., 523 So. 2d 1132, 1134&nbsp;(Fla.\r\n  1988) (stating the doctrine of equitable tolling, unlike equitable estoppel, does\r\n  not require deception or misrepresentation by the defendant; rather, it serves\r\n  to ameliorate the harsh results that sometimes flow from a strict, literalistic\r\n  application of administrative time limits).\r\nIn\r\n  our view, the situations described above do not constitute an exclusive list of\r\n  circumstances that justify the application of equitable tolling.Â  â€œThe equitable power of a court is not bound by cast-iron rules but exists to do fairness and\r\n  is flexible and adaptable to particular exigencies so that relief will be granted\r\n  when, in view of all the circumstances, to deny it would permit one party to\r\n  suffer a gross wrong at the hands of the other.â€Â  Hausman v. Hausman, 199\r\n  S.W.3d 38, 42&nbsp;(Tex. App. 2006).Â  Equitable tolling may be applied where it\r\n  is justified under all the circumstances.Â  We agree, however, that equitable\r\n  tolling is a doctrine that should be used sparingly and only when the interests\r\n  of justice compel its use. \r\nWe have previously tolled a statute\r\n  of limitations based on equitable considerations.Â  In Hopkins v. Floydâ€™s\r\n    Wholesale, 299 S.C. 127, 382 S.E.2d 907 (1989), a workersâ€™ compensation\r\n  case, we tolled the running of the statute of limitations for the time that the\r\n  employee was induced by the employer to believe the claim would be taken care\r\n  of without filing a claim (the â€œreliance periodâ€).Â  In reaching this result, we\r\n  considered two methods of treating the claim:Â  (1)&nbsp;requiring that the\r\n  claim be filed a â€œreasonable timeâ€ after the reliance period, or (2) tolling\r\n  the statute of limitations during the reliance period.Â  Id. at 129, 382\r\n  S.E.2d at 908-09.Â  We held the better rule was to toll the running of the\r\n  statute of limitations during the reliance period, as this â€œrule estopping\r\n  employers from asserting the statute of limitation[s]â€ provided greater certainty\r\n  and gave the employee the greatest benefit of the equitable rule.Â  Id. at 130, 382 S.E.2d at 909.\r\nIn Schriber v. Anonymous,\r\n  848 N.E.2d 1061 (Ind. 2006), a widow brought medical malpractice and wrongful\r\n  death claims arising out of the death of her husband.Â  The widow encountered\r\n  difficulties in effecting timely service because the defendant, a healthcare\r\n  facility, failed to file a certificate of assumed name for its business\r\n  designation and to conspicuously post its facility license in public view as\r\n  required by state law.Â  Id. at 1063.Â  The Indiana Supreme Court, while\r\n  deciding the case on another basis, observed that the proper procedure should have\r\n  been for the court to judicially toll the expiration of the applicable\r\n  limitations period for the time that the defendantâ€™s actions hindered the\r\n  plaintiffâ€™s discovery of the proper entity name and thus delayed her attempt to\r\n  effect service.Â  Id. at 1063-64.\r\nIn the current appeal, we\r\n  find Ebenezerâ€™s failure to properly list its registered agent for service with\r\n  the Secretary of State as required by state law hindered Hooperâ€™s pursuit of\r\n  service.[7]Â \r\n  Although Ebenezer argues it is entitled to the dismissal of Hooperâ€™s action because\r\n  she should have pursued alternative means of service, such as publication or\r\n  service upon the Secretary of State, nowhere in Ebenezerâ€™s arguments does it\r\n  acknowledge the obvious fact that the need for alternative means of service was\r\n  caused by Ebenezerâ€™s own failure to supply the correct information regarding\r\n  its agent to the Secretary of State as required by law.Â  In fact, as Hooper\r\n  noted in her brief, though several years had passed, Ebenezer still had not supplied\r\n  the name of an appropriate agent for service of process to the Secretary of\r\n  State at the time this case was initially brought before our Court.Â  Hooper was\r\n  entitled to rely on the public records and she diligently pursued service on what\r\n  turned out to be a nonexistent agent.Â  Thus, it is not equitable that Ebenezer\r\n  be the beneficiary of the drastic consequence of a dismissal. \r\nMoreover,\r\n  it is important to note that a party utilizes these alternative methods of\r\n  service only after first exercising reasonable or due diligence to effect\r\n  service on an individual or agent.Â  See e.g., S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-9-710\r\n  &amp; -730 (2005) (providing that when an individual or corporate agent,\r\n  respectively, cannot be located in this State after the exercise of due\r\n  diligence, service may be had by publication once this fact has been\r\n  established by affidavit to the satisfaction of the court); id. Â§&nbsp;33-44-111\r\n  (2006) (stating if an agent for a limited liability company cannot be found\r\n  after the exercise of reasonable diligence, service may be had upon the\r\n  Secretary of State).Â  \r\nIn\r\n  this case, Hooper first tried to effect service upon the agent named by\r\n  Ebenezer at the address it supplied to the Secretary of State.Â  When that was\r\n  unsuccessful, Hooper hired a private investigator, who found a personal address\r\n  for the agent.Â  Hooper contacted the Lexington County Sheriffâ€™s Department on\r\n  numerous occasions and was told that service was being made.Â  She was not\r\n  notified until one month after the running of the statute of the limitations\r\n  that service had been unsuccessful because the whereabouts of the agent could\r\n  not be determined.Â  \r\nHooper\r\n  finally was able to effect service after the statute of limitations had run,\r\n  only after she exercised reasonable and due diligence to serve Ebenezerâ€™s agent.Â \r\n  Under Rule 3(a)(2), SCRCP, even if the limitations period has run, service may\r\n  still be effected if it is accomplished within 120 days of filing of the\r\n  summons and complaint.Â  Unfortunately, Hooper was approximately one week past\r\n  the 120 days.Â  Thus, under the unique circumstances of this case, we conclude it\r\n  is appropriate to equitably toll the statute of limitations for the time Hooper\r\n  spent in pursuit of Ebenezerâ€™s nonexistent agent.Â  \r\nFinally, we note that public\r\n  policy and the interests of justice weigh heavily in favor of allowing Hooperâ€™s\r\n  claim to proceed.Â  The statute of limitationsâ€™ purpose of protecting defendants\r\n  from stale claims must give way to the publicâ€™s interest in being able to rely\r\n  on public records required by law.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nAs a matter of law and public\r\n  policy, we reverse the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary judgment in favor of Ebenezer\r\n  and remand for further proceedings consistent with this opinion.[8]Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.

Civ. P. 3(a) (Alaska); Rule 1-003 NMRA (New Mexico); V.R.C.P. 3\r\n  (Vermont); see also Fed. R. Civ.

Â§ 37-10-102 (1989 &amp; Supp. 1995). Â The class was certified, and\r\n  subsequently decertified by a different trial court.Â  The individual actions\r\n  brought by King and Sims continued.Â  American General was granted summary\r\n  judgment as to King's action, and Sims's claim resulted in a defense jury\r\n  verdict. Â We reverse the class decertification as well as the trial court's\r\n  holdings in the individual cases.Â  We remand this case to continue as a class\r\n  action and allow the class action to once again envelop the individual cases. \r\nI.\r\nThis case is governed by section\r\n  37-10-102(a) (1989 &amp;\r\n  Supp. 1995), the so-called\r\n  attorney preference statute, as it existed prior to May 30, 1996.[1]Â  The statute provided that &quot;[w]henever the\r\n  primary purpose of a loan that is secured in whole or in part by a lien on real\r\n  estate is for a personal, family or household purpose[,]&quot; lenders\r\n  such as American General were required to &quot;ascertain the preference of the\r\n  borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed to represent the debtor . . . and the credit application on the first page thereof must contain\r\n    information as is necessary to ascertain these preferences of the borrower.&quot;Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102(a) (1989 &amp; Supp. 1995) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe South\r\n  Carolina Department of Consumer Affairs interpreted the timing provision of\r\n  section 37-10-102(a) as follows:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  summary, the attorney and insurance agent preference need not be indicated\r\n  directly on the application form so long as the borrower is presented a clear\r\n  and conspicuous disclosure of this right prior to or contemporaneously with the\r\n  application form.Â  \r\n\r\nS.C. Dep't of Consumer\r\n  Affairs, Admin. Interpretation No. 10.102(a)-8302 (1983). \r\nRelying on the statutory language that &quot;the credit\r\n  application on the first page&quot; must ascertain the borrower's attorney preference,\r\n  together with the 1983 Department of Consumer Affairs &quot;administrative\r\n  interpretation,&quot; King and Sims allege American General violated section\r\n  37-10-102(a) by failing to provide the necessary attorney preference disclosure\r\n  at the time of their credit applications.Â  King and Sims brought this action on\r\n  behalf of themselves and those similarly situated, and they allege this action implicates\r\n  approximately five thousand loans.[2]Â  \r\nKing\r\n  and Sims each closed a loan with American General in 1995.Â  King sought a home improvement loan that was secured by her\r\n  home.Â  American General presented King with a Federal Disclosure Statement, which\r\n  stated: &quot;You are giving a security interest in your Real Estate . . . .&quot;Â \r\n  King additionally signed a &quot;Security Agreement&quot; that specifically\r\n  listed an automobile as security for her loan.Â  The &quot;Security\r\n  Agreement&quot; further stated that the &quot;mortgaged property&quot; included\r\n  &quot;[a]ll property listed as security in a certain Federal Disclosure\r\n  Statement executed by and delivered to the Mortgagor(s) on even date.&quot;Â  For\r\n  reasons that are not entirely clear, King eventually received a debt\r\n  consolidation loan that American General alleges was not secured by real estate.Â \r\n  Â \r\nUndisputedly,\r\n  Deloris Sims received a loan from American General secured by real property;\r\n  however, the document American General relied on was an undated attorney\r\n  preference statement.\r\nIn\r\n  1996, King and Sims brought this action on behalf of themselves and those similarly\r\n  situated. Â In 1998, Judge T. L. Hughston, Jr. denied American General's motion\r\n  for summary judgment and certified the class.Â  The court analyzed the proposed\r\n  class under Rule 23(a), SCRCP, and found all the following elements were satisfied:\r\n  numerosity, commonality, typicality, adequacy of King and Sims as class\r\n  representatives, and the amount in controversy exceeded one hundred dollars per\r\n  class member.\r\n\r\n\tImportantly, when discussing typicality, the court stated:\r\n\t[American General] has asserted a 'substantial compliance'\r\n  argument based upon Davis v. NationsCredit Fin. Serv. Corp., [326 S.C. 83,] 484 S.E.2d 471 (1997).Â  This argument is misplaced.Â  \r\n\tDavis dealt with an issue of form, not one of timing.Â  In Davis, the\r\n  plaintiff had received the required notice at the time of application as\r\n  required by [s]ection 37-10-102, but the notice was on a separate sheet rather\r\n  than on the first page of the application.Â  Timing is a critical issue of\r\n  informed disclosure.Â  The definition proposed by [King and Sims] excludes those\r\n  who received the form at the time of application . . . .Â  [T]he requirement of\r\n  typicality is satisfied.\r\n\tFurther,\r\n  Judge Hughston's order stated:\r\n\tThis Court therefore orders the certification of the proposed\r\n  class consisting of all persons who, since July 1, 1982, have taken a loan from\r\n  [American General] which was secured in whole or in part by a lien on real\r\n  estate in South Carolina for personal, family, or household purposes, whether\r\n  recorded or not, and\r\n\ta.Â Â Â Â Â Â  for whom the debt secured is: i) still outstanding, or\r\n  ii) (sic) payment was made on the loan within three years of the date of the\r\n  filing of this action on August 1, 1996, and\r\n\tb.Â Â Â Â Â Â  for whom [American General] failed to ascertain the\r\n  attorney or insurance preference of the borrower at the time of application in\r\n  the manner required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102.\r\n\r\nAmerican\r\n  General petitioned this Court for Writ of Mandamus and Writ of Certiorari from\r\n  Judge Hughston's order.Â  This Court denied both petitions.Â  Subsequently, this\r\n  case was designated as complex, and thereafter, it was assigned to Judge James\r\n  C. Williams, Jr.\r\nIn\r\n  2001, Judge Williams decertified the class after finding &quot;there is no such\r\n  thing as a typical plaintiff in this case&quot; because the timing of when a\r\n  loan attached to property differed among the borrowers.Â  In a later ruling, the\r\n  trial court granted summary judgment in favor of American General in King's case,\r\n  finding the loan King eventually received was not secured by real property.\r\nAdditionally, the trial court granted partial summary judgment in\r\n  favor of Sims, noting &quot;there can be no substantial compliance where the\r\n  preferences are not ascertained until closing.&quot;Â  Subsequently, the trial\r\n  court granted American General's motion to reconsider the ruling for Sims,\r\n  vacated its earlier ruling, and conducted a jury trial.\r\n\r\n\tThe\r\n  jury found for American General.Â  First, the jury was asked: \r\n\tDid the\r\n  actions of American General in this case give a clear and prominent disclosure\r\n  of the information necessary to ascertain the relevant preference of Deloris\r\n  Sims?Â  In other words, did American General substantially comply with the\r\n  statutory requirements?Â  \r\n\r\nThe jury answered &quot;yes.&quot;Â \r\n  Next, the jury was asked to determine when the disclosure was made.Â  Eleven\r\n  jurors found American General made the disclosure on the day of the closing,\r\n  and one juror found American General made the disclosure prior to the closing.Â \r\n  Judgment was entered for American General.\r\nThis\r\n  appeal of the decertification and treatment of King's and Sims's individual\r\n  cases followed.\r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nKing\r\n  and Sims argue the trial court erred in decertifying the class.Â  We agree.\r\nIt is\r\n  within a trial court's discretion whether a class should be certified.Â  Tilley v. Pacesetter Corp., 333 S.C. 33, 42, 508 S.E.2d 16, 21 (1998).Â  Additionally,\r\n  &quot;[a] court may not look to the merits when determining whether to certify\r\n  a class.&quot;Â  Id. at 43, 508 S.E.2d at 21.\r\n\r\n\tAs\r\n  discussed above, at the relevant time, section 37-10-102 stated:\r\n\tWhenever the primary purpose of a loan that is secured in whole or\r\n  in part by a lien on real estate is for a personal, family or household\r\n  purpose-\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(a) The\r\n  creditor must ascertain the preference of the borrower as to the legal\r\n  counsel that is employed to represent the debtor in all matters of the\r\n  transaction relating to the closing of the transaction . . . and the credit\r\n    application on the first page thereof must contain information as is necessary\r\n    to ascertain these preferences of the borrower. Â The creditor may require\r\n  that the attorney or agent so chosen be able to provide\r\n  reasonable security to the creditor by way of mortgage title insurance in a\r\n  company acceptable to the creditor and other insurance in a company acceptable\r\n  to the creditor. Â If title insurance is made a condition of the loan at any\r\n  point during the negotiations, it must remain a condition all the time\r\n  thereafter regardless of which attorney ultimately closes the transaction. Â Any\r\n  legal fees other than for examination and certification of the title, the\r\n  preparation of all required documents, and the closing of the transaction\r\n  required or incurred by the creditor in connection with the transaction is the\r\n  responsibility of the creditor regardless of which party pays for the title\r\n  work, document preparation, and closing.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  37-10-102(a) (1989 &amp; Supp. 1995) (emphasis added).Â  \r\nThis Court interpreted the applicable version of section 37-10-102 in Davis v. NationsCredit Financial Services Corp., 326 S.C. 83, 484 S.E.2d 471\r\n  (1997).Â  In Davis, this Court answered certified questions arising from\r\n  a mortgage loan transaction where Davis received an attorney preference\r\n  statement on a separate sheet of paper contemporaneously with her credit\r\n  application.Â  Id. at 84, 484 S.E.2d at 471.Â  The issue in Davis was one of form: whether the presentation of the attorney preference\r\n  disclosure on a separate paper from the application violated section 37-10-102.\r\nIn answering those\r\n  questions, we construed the legislative purpose of section 37-10-102 to be\r\n  &quot;to protect borrowers.&quot;Â  Id. at 86, 484 S.E.2d at 472.Â  This\r\n  Court held that a\r\n  lender may deviate from section 37-10-102 by assessing the borrower's\r\n  preference for legal counsel on a separate piece of paper, provided the\r\n  disclosure is &quot;clear and prominent&quot; and made contemporaneously with the\r\n  actual loan application.Â  The Court sanctioned such a deviation on the basis of\r\n  substantial compliance.Â  Id.\r\n  at 86, 484 S.E.2d at 472.Â  Thus, this Court held substantial\r\n  compliance may be achieved if the form of the disclosure is clear and\r\n  meaningful.Â \r\n  The timing of the attorney preference disclosure was not an issue in Davis,\r\n  as the lender provided the attorney preference statement contemporaneously with\r\n  the loan application.Â  \r\nTiming is the central issue in this case.Â  Consistent with\r\n  Judge Hughstonâ€™s ruling, we construe section 37-10-102(a) as requiring the attorney preference disclosure to occur contemporaneously with the credit\r\n  application.Â  Our construction of legislative intent flows from the clear language\r\n  of the statuteâ€”&quot;the credit application on the\r\n  first page thereof must contain information as is necessary to ascertain these\r\n  preferences of the borrower&quot;â€”and from the 1983\r\n  interpretation by the Department of Consumer Affairs.&quot;[3] \r\nThe\r\n  Court will construe legislative intent in accord with unambiguous statutory\r\n  language:\r\n\r\n\tIn\r\n  interpreting statutes, th[is] Court looks to the plain meaning of the statute\r\n  and the intent of the Legislature.Â  Furthermore, if\r\n    possible, legislative intent should be found in the plain language of the\r\n  statute itself. Â If a statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite meaning,\r\n  the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the Court has no right\r\n  to impose another meaning. Â \r\n\r\nBinney v. State, 384 S.C. 539, 683 S.E.2d 478, (2009) (internal\r\n  citations and quotation marks omitted); see also Lexington Law Firm v.\r\n    S.C. Dep't of Consumer Affairs, 382 S.C. 580, 586, 677 S.E.2d 591, 594 (2009) (noting that an\r\n  agency's construction of a statute within its purview is entitled to respectful\r\n  consideration and, absent compelling reasons, should not be rejected).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  timing feature of section 37-10-102 imposes a bright-line approach which is\r\n  manifestly at odds with the notion of &quot;substantial compliance.&quot;Â  To permit a construction of section\r\n  37-10-102 as sanctioning the lender's furnishing the borrower with the attorney\r\n  preference disclosure after the application was completed would undermine the legislative\r\n  purpose &quot;to protect borrowers.&quot;Â  Davis, 326\r\n  S.C. at 86, 484 S.E.2d at 472; see also McClanahan v. Richland County Council, 350 S.C. 433, 438, 567 S.E.2d 240, 242 (2002) (&quot;All\r\n  rules of statutory construction are subservient to the one that legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used,\r\n  and that language must be construed in light of the intended purpose of the\r\n  statute.&quot;).Â  And the suggestion that the attorney\r\n  preference disclosure may be made at closing borders\r\n  on frivolity. \r\nThe trial court correctly observed the varying times in the loan\r\n  process during which the attorney preference disclosure was made.Â  A disclosure\r\n  not made contemporaneously with the credit application is untimely.Â  The\r\n  typicality requirement of Rule\r\n  23, SCRCP, is found in the common feature of the lender failing to timely\r\n  provide the attorney preference disclosure.Â  The additional prerequisites to\r\n  class certification are similarly present, including numerosity, commonality,\r\n  and the adequacy of King and Sims as class representatives.Â  In decertifying the class, we hold the\r\n  trial court committed legal error. Â Accordingly, we reverse the class\r\n  decertification.Â  The class shall be deemed certified as of July 2, 1998,\r\n  without interruption.\r\nB.\r\nWe turn\r\n  to Sims's individual case, which involved a signed but undated attorney\r\n  preference disclosure form.Â  Sims argues the trial court erred in merging the\r\n  principle of substantial compliance with the timing element of section\r\n  37-10-102.Â  We agree.\r\nAs\r\n  discussed above, the trial court impermissibly entangled the concepts of\r\n  timeliness and substantial compliance.Â  It was error to instruct the jury on substantial\r\n  compliance with respect to the timing element of the attorney preference\r\n  disclosure.Â  As a matter of law, providing the attorney preference disclosure after\r\n  the completion of the credit application violated section 37-10-102.Â  This prejudicial\r\n  error is clear in the inconsistent jury verdict forms.Â  Accordingly, we reverse\r\n  due to the trial court's error of law in permitting the timing element in\r\n  section 37-10-102 to be satisfied by substantial compliance.\r\nC.\r\nKing\r\n  argues the trial court erred in granting American General summary judgment on\r\n  the basis that her loan ultimately was not secured by real property.Â  We are\r\n  not persuaded on the record before us that American General is entitled to\r\n  summary judgment.\r\n&quot;Summary judgment is appropriate when it is clear\r\n  that there is no genuine issue of material fact and that the moving party is\r\n  entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.&quot;Â  Cafe Assoc., Ltd. v.\r\n    Gerngross, 305 S.C. 6, 9, 406 S.E.2d 162, 164 (1991); see Koester v.\r\n      Carolina Rental Ctr., Inc., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994)\r\n  (&quot;In determining whether any triable issues of fact exist, the evidence\r\n  and all inferences which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be\r\n  viewed in the light most favorable to the non-moving party.&quot;).\r\nAs part of the December 1995 loan application, King executed a disclosure\r\n  form furnished by American General that stated: &quot;You are giving a security\r\n  interest in your Real Estate.&quot;[4]Â \r\n  As noted, King also signed a &quot;Security Agreement,&quot; which indicates King\r\n  granted American General a mortgage in &quot;[a]ll property listed as\r\n  security&quot; in the disclosure form.Â  We further point out that it appears\r\n  the King loan was initially intended to be secured by her real estate, and the law\r\n  required the attorney preference disclosure at the time of the application.Â  We\r\n  make no finding on the matter of liability and merely hold that the record\r\n  before us does not warrant summary judgment in favor of American General. \r\nIII.\r\nKing\r\n  and Sims make additional arguments that we decline to reach due to our above\r\n  holdings.Â  Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598,\r\n  613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (stating an appellate court need not discuss\r\n  remaining issues when disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nWe\r\n  reverse the trial court's rulings regarding King's and Sims's individual claims\r\n  and the decertification of the class.Â  We remand the case to proceed as a class\r\n  action effective as of the date of Judge Hughston's\r\n  original order to certify the class filed on July 2, 1998.\r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Effective May 30, 1996,\r\n  the Legislature amended section\r\n  37-10-102(a).Â  See Act No. 355, Â§ 1, 1996 S.C. Acts 2187.Â  Following this\r\n  amendment, a lender was required to notify the borrower prior to closing of the\r\n  borrower's attorney preference rights by either: (1) including the information\r\n  on or with the credit application, or (2) providing the borrower written notice\r\n  of the preference information that is &quot;delivered or mailed no later than\r\n  three business days after the application is received or prepared.&quot;Â  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 37-10-102(a) (1989 &amp; Supp. 1996).Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; Section 37-10-105 of the South Carolina Code was amended again in 1997 to preclude\r\n  class actions for subsequent violations of the attorney preference provision of\r\n  section 37-10-102.Â  See Act\r\n  No. 99, 1997 S.C. Acts 482.\r\n[3]&nbsp; As noted, section 37-10-102 was amended on May\r\n  30, 1996.Â  Notably, the amendment affects causes of action accruing on or after\r\n  May 30, 1996.Â  Act No. 355, 1996 S.C. Acts 2187. Â The amended statute requires that &quot;[t]he creditor must ascertain prior to\r\n  closing the preference of the borrower as to the legal counsel that is employed\r\n  to represent the debtor in all matters of the transaction relating to the\r\n  closing of the transaction.&quot;Â  The amended statute allows creditors to comply\r\n  by &quot;including the preference information on or with the credit application\r\n  â€¦ or [by] providing written notice to the borrower . . . no later than three\r\n  business days after the application is received or prepared.&quot;Â  The three\r\n  day post-credit application option under the 1996 amendment is not present in\r\n  the prior version of the statute which is before us today.Â  \r\n[4]&nbsp; The federal disclosure form was not\r\n  recorded.Â  Gail Laney, the manager of deeds in the county where King's home is\r\n  located, stated in her affidavit no mortgage is recorded for King's property in\r\n  the land records office.Â  The absence of recording, however, affects priority\r\n  among creditors, not the existence of a lien.Â  Epps v. McCallum Realty Co.,\r\n  139 S.C. 481, 497, 138 S.E. 297, 302 (1927) (holding as to the two parties\r\n  involved in making an instrument, recording is not necessary for the instrument\r\n  to be valid).Â  American General argues that the federal disclosure form cannot,\r\n  as a matter of law, create a security interest in real property.Â  There is,\r\n  however, additional evidence in the record (beyond the federal disclosure form)\r\n  which also points to a security interest in King's real property.Â Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26749","title":"Mikell v.

County of Charleston, 375 S.C. 552, 654\r\n  S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2007), in which the Court of Appeals held Charleston County\r\n  Council (County) properly enacted a zoning ordinance for a Planned Development\r\n  (PD) on Edisto Island.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nThe property in question is a 160 acre tract of land\r\n  on Edisto Island which is known as Peters Point Plantation, a former cotton\r\n  plantation owned by the Mikell family since 1715.Â  Â Peters Point forms a point, or peninsula, at the intersection of two tidal creeks: St. Pierreâ€™s Creek\r\n  on the north, and Fishing Creek on the south.Â  \r\nPeters Point is intersected in the middle by Peters Point Road.Â  Petitioners are I. Jenkins Mikell, Jr. and Pinkney V. Mikell, who own land on the north side of Peters Point Road; Respondents, distant family members of Petitioners, own six tracts of\r\n  land, a total of 161 acres, on the north and south of Peters Point Road.Â  The\r\n  furthermost tract borders Fishing Creek.Â Â  \r\nIn 1999, Charleston County enacted a Comprehensive Land Use Plan (Plan).Â  The Plan describes that\r\n  the â€œAgricultural Area is the outmost portion of the Rural Landscape in Charleston County.Â  Included within it are Wadmalaw Island, Edisto Island [and others].â€Â \r\n  The Plan calls for preservation of the rural community character.Â  The\r\n  preferred uses of agricultural areas include â€œfarming and resource management,\r\n  along with preservation of existing rural settlements, compatible low-density\r\n  residential development, and small-scale neighborhood commercial development.â€Â  Id.Â Â  The recommended development densities within such Agricultural\r\n  Areas of Charleston County are as follows:\r\n\r\n\t-Agricultural\r\n  Residential (AGR) - 1 dwelling per acre to 1 dwelling per 5 acres.\r\n\t-Agricultural\r\n  Preservation (AG-10) - 1 dwelling per 5 acres to 1 dwelling per 10 acres. \r\n\r\nThe Plan states â€œthe\r\n  designation of Agricultural Areas is also intended to direct residential\r\n  development to existing settlement areas and to avoid the scattering of\r\n  development into . . . Agricultural Preservation Areas.â€Â  \r\nIn 2001, County\r\n  enacted Zoning and Land Development Regulations (ZLDR) in order to implement\r\n  the Plan.Â  The ZLDR incorporate the Agricultural Areas of the Plan, and reiterate\r\n  that an AG-10 Agricultural Preservation District is subject to a maximum\r\n  density of 1 dwelling per 10 acres.Â  ZLDR Â§ 4.5.Â  However, an AG-10\r\n  district may be increased to a â€œhighest allowed densityâ€ of 1 dwelling unit per\r\n  5 acres, if a request is processed through the Planned Development process of Â§\r\n  3.5 of the ZLDR.Â  The ZLDR sets the maximum density for AGR districts at 1\r\n  dwelling per acre, in accordance with the Plan.Â  \r\nUnder the Plan and\r\n  the ZLDR, of the six tracts of land owned by Respondents, four of the tracts\r\n  were zoned AGR, and the remaining two tracts were zoned AG-10, such that the\r\n  total parcel of 161 acres was subject to maximum densities as follows:\r\n\r\n\t-106.64\r\n  Acres (2 tracts)- Zoned AG-10-Â Â  1 unit per 10 acres = total 10 units[1] \r\n\t-55\r\n  Acres (4 tracts)- Zoned AGR-Â Â  1 unit per acre = 54 total units.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, as initially\r\n  zoned, the tracts were subject to a total maximum of 64 units.\r\nIn 2003,\r\n  Respondents filed an application with County to rezone their Peters Point property to a Planned Development (PD) District.Â  The stated purpose of the\r\n  application was to allow family members to construct homes for themselves and\r\n  their children at Peterâ€™s Point Plantation; they do not intend to permit\r\n  commercial or multi-family development.Â  On May 4, 2004, County Council enacted\r\n  Ordinance # 1300 rezoning the parcels from AGR and AG-10 to a PD-103 District.Â \r\n  The Planned Development submitted by Respondents (and approved by Ordinance #\r\n  1300) had the effect of reducing the total number of units on the entire tract\r\n  from a maximum of 64, to a total maximum of 55 units.Â  However, the Ordinance\r\n  also had the effect of increasing the overall density to 1 dwelling unit per\r\n  3.8 acres.Â  As to the 106 acre tract of land which was zoned AG-10, the PD had\r\n  the effect of increasing to a maximum density of 1 unit per 2.4 acres.\r\nPetitioners\r\n  instituted this declaratory judgment action, contending the ordinance\r\n  conflicted with Countyâ€™s Comprehensive Plan and the ZLDR.Â  Petitionersâ€™ motion\r\n  for summary judgment was granted by the Master.Â  The Master held Ordinance #\r\n  1300 conflicted with the clear, unambiguous requirements of Â§ 4.5.3(B) of the\r\n  ZLDR limiting the density in an AG-10 district to a maximum of one dwelling per\r\n  five acres.Â  The Master found Â§ 4.5.3 was, at best, inconsistent with Â§ 3.5.7\r\n  of the ZLDR, such that the more specific regulation, Â§ 4.5.3, controlled.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals reversed.Â  Mikell v. County of Charleston, 375 S.C. 552, 654\r\n  S.E.2d 92 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  It held County Councilâ€™s decision to allow the PD\r\n  was at least fairly debatable, and was neither arbitrary nor unreasonable.Â Â  It\r\n  found Â§ 3.5.2 and Â§ 3.5.7 of the ZLDR authorized Countyâ€™s exercise of\r\n  discretion in approving a PD with a higher density than base zoning districts\r\n  would have allowed.Â  The Court of Appeals found no conflict existed between Â§Â§\r\n  3.5.2, 3.5.7 and Â§ 4.5.3(B).Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in reversing the Masterâ€™s grant of summary judgment to Petitioners\r\n  and reinstating Ordinance # 1300?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nAlthough summary judgment issues are generally\r\n  reviewed under a fact-based inquiry, issues involving the construction of an\r\n  ordinance are reviewed as a matter of law under a broader standard of review\r\n  than is applied in reviewing issues of fact.Â  Eagle Container LLC v. County of Newberry, 379 S.C. 564, 666 S.E.2d 892 (2008).Â  Although great deference is\r\n  accorded the decisions of those charged with interpreting and applying local\r\n  zoning ordinances, â€œa broader and more independent review is permitted when the\r\n  issue concerns the construction of an ordinance.â€Â  Id. at 568, 666\r\n  S.E.2d at 894 citing Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n\r\n    v. Somers, 319 S.C. 65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995).Â  The determination\r\n  of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  Id.[2]Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nCountyâ€™s\r\n  Comprehensive Land Use Plan establishes four distinct areas within County, and sets\r\n  forth the general types and intensities of development which should occur in\r\n  each.Â  The only areas pertinent to this case are those designated as\r\n  Agricultural, for which there are two categories:\r\n\r\n\tÂ -\r\n  Agricultural Residential (AGR) - 1 dwelling per acre to 1 dwelling per 5 acres.\r\n\t- Agricultural\r\n  Preservation (AG-10) - 1 dwelling per 5 acres to 1 dwelling per 10 acres. \r\n\r\nThe ZLDR passed by\r\n  County to implement the Plan requires an AG-10 District to have a maximum\r\n  density of 1 dwelling per 10 acres.Â  ZLDR Â§ 4.5.2.Â Â  However, this\r\n  density may be increased to a â€œhighest allowed densityâ€ of 1 dwelling\r\n    unit per 5 acres, if a request is processed through the Planned\r\n      Development process of Â§ 3.5 of the ZLDR.Â  ZLDR Â§ 4.5.3.B.Â  Â Â \r\n\r\n\tSection 3.5.7 of\r\n  the ZLDR states:\r\n\tUnless\r\n  expressly stated in this section or approved at the time of a Planned\r\n  Development approval, all applicable standards of this Ordinance shall apply .\r\n  . . . Planned Developments may provided for variations from other ordinances\r\n    and the regulations of the other established zoning districts concerning use,\r\n    setbacks, lot area, density, bulk and other requirements to accommodate\r\n  flexibility in the arrangement of uses for the general purpose of promoting and\r\n  protecting the public health, safety, and general welfare.Â  \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).[3]Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals held that inasmuch as Â§ 3.5.7 permits the Commission to approve a PD\r\n  with a higher density than other established zoning districts, the action of\r\n  the Commission in approving respondentsâ€™ application was at least â€œfairly\r\n  debatable.â€Â  The Court of Appeals also held that, because County has the\r\n  legislative power to amend its general zoning ordinance and rezone small areas,\r\n  it acted within its authority.Â  This was error.Â  \r\nThe primary rule of\r\n  statutory construction is to ascertain and give effect to the intent of the\r\n  legislature.Â  Mid-State Auto Auction of Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324\r\n  S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996).Â  When interpreting an ordinance, the legislative\r\n  intent must prevail if it can be reasonably discovered in the language used.Â  Charleston County Parks &amp; Recreation Commâ€™n v. Somers, 319 S.C.\r\n  65, 67, 459 S.E.2d 841, 843 (1995). Â Further, where two provisions deal with\r\n  the same issue, one in a general and the other in a more specific and definite\r\n  manner, the more specific prevails.Â  Capco of Summerville v. J.H. Gayle\r\n    Constr. Co., Inc., 368 S.C. 137, 628 S.E.2d 38 (2006).Â  See also Wooten\r\n      ex rel. Wooten v. S.C. Depâ€™t of Transp., 333 S.C. 464, 468, 511 S.E.2d 355,\r\n  357 (1999) (specific statutory provision prevails over a more general one); Atlas\r\n    Food Sys. &amp; Servs., Inc. v. Crane Natâ€™l Vendors Div. of Unidynamics Corp.,\r\n  319 S.C. 556, 558, 462 S.E.2d 858, 859 (1995) (general rule of statutory\r\n  construction is that a specific statute prevails over a more general one).Â \r\n  When reviewing issues involving the construction of an ordinance, the determination\r\n  of legislative intent is a matter of law.Â  Eagle Container, supra.Â Â Â Â  \r\nWe find the\r\n  legislative intent, as it relates to AG-10 districts, was to ensure a maximum density of 1 dwelling unit per 5 acres on AG-10 districts.Â  This intent is\r\n  clearly reflected in the Comprehensive Land Use Plan and the ZLDR. Â Â Â Â \r\nWe find it highly\r\n  implausible that, in setting forth a maximum density of 1 unit per 10 acres for\r\n  AG-10 Districts, and then allowing for an increase of up to 1 unit per 5\r\n  acres for a Planned Development, the County intended to authorize the approval\r\n  of a Planned Development which would completely vitiate the maximum density\r\n  requirements set forth in Â§ 4.5.3B.Â Â  Had County intended such a result, Â§\r\n  4.5.3B would have permitted a higher density to be approved if processed\r\n  as a Planned Development, without restricting it to a â€œhighest allowed\r\n    density of 1 unit per 5 acres.â€Â  We find County clearly intended to limit\r\n  those tracts zoned AG-10 to a maximum density of one dwelling per 5 acres, and\r\n  intended to preserve â€œexisting rural settlementsâ€ and â€œcompatible low-density\r\n  residential development.â€Â  It was, therefore, error to authorize maximum\r\n  densities in excess of those specifically outlined by the ZLDR.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ opinion is reversed, and the order of the Master is reinstated.Â  \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  PLEICONES, J., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. Acting Justice G.\r\n  Thomas Cooper dissenting in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nActing Justice G.\r\n  Thomas Cooper, Â (dissenting): This Court would reverse not only the Court of\r\n  Appeals, but also the Charleston County Planning and Zoning Commission and the\r\n  Charleston County Council for enactment of Ordinance #1300, the Peters Point\r\n  Planned Development.Â  Ordinance #1300 created a Planned Development, an entity\r\n  described and authorized in Section 6-29-740 of the South Carolina Code as an\r\n  independent, distinct zoning district.Â  In doing so, the majority finds:\r\n\r\n\tâ€¦ it\r\n  highly implausible that, in setting forth a maximum density of 1 unit per 10\r\n  acres for AG-10 Districts, and then allowing for an increase of up to 1 unit\r\n  per 5 acres for a Planned Development, the County intended to authorize the\r\n  approval of a Planned Development which would completely vitiate the maximum\r\n  density requirements set forth in Section 4.5.3B.\r\n\r\nHowever, that is exactly what the Act and the\r\n  Charleston County Zoning and Land Development Regulations (ZLDR) allows the\r\n  Charleston County Council to do.Â  Its decision is supported by the State\r\n  statute and the Charleston County Comprehensive Plan and the Charleston County\r\n  ZLDR.Â  To reverse the action of County Council flies in the face of this\r\n  Court's frequent pronouncement that it will acknowledge and respect the actions\r\n  of the pertinent legislative body if its actions are â€œfairly debatable.â€Â  Bear\r\n    Enterprises v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. 137, 459 S.E.2d 883 (S.C. Ct.\r\n  App. 1995); Rush v. City of Greenville, 246 S.C. 268, 143 S.E.2d 527\r\n  (1965).\r\n\r\n\tCourts have no prerogative to pass upon the\r\n  wisdom of the municipality's decision unless such decision is â€œso unreasonable\r\n  as to impair or destroy citizen's constitutional rightsâ€; and the decision\r\n  should not be overturned by a court so long as the decision is â€œfairly\r\n  debatable.â€Â  This policy of judicial restraint has been echoed in a recent decision.\r\n\tWe have long recognized the principal that\r\n  the power to zone is exclusively for the legislature and that zoning decisions\r\n  will not be interfered with when made in the exercise of the governing bodyâ€™s\r\n  police power to accomplish the desired end unless there is a plain violation of\r\n  the citizensâ€ constitutional rights.Â  \r\n\r\nKnowles v. City of Aiken, 305 S.C. 219, 224, 407 S.E.2d 639, 642 (1991)\r\n  (internal citations omitted).Â  Modern legal treatises frequently define a\r\n  â€œPlanned Districtâ€ as a â€œPlanned Unit Development.â€\r\n\r\n\tâ€œPlanned unit developmentâ€ means an area of\r\n  land, controlled by a landowner, to be developed as a single entity for a\r\n  number of dwelling units, and commercial and industrial uses, if any, the plan\r\n  for which does not correspond in lot size, bulk, or type of dwelling or\r\n  commercial or industrial use, density, lot coverage and required open space to\r\n  the regulations established in any one or more districts created, from time to\r\n  time, under the provisions of a municipal zoning ordinance enacted pursuant to\r\n  the conventional zoning enabling act of the state.\r\n\r\nJulian Conrad\r\n  Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, Land Use Planning and\r\nDevelopment Regulation\r\n  Law 283 (2007).Â  This definition is\r\n  not dissimilar to South Carolina Code Section 6-29-740.\r\nThe essential question\r\n  is, therefore, does the Charleston County Ordinance #1300 conflict with the\r\n  Charleston County Comprehensive Plan or with the ZLDR?Â  And, if so, can the\r\n  County Council enact an Ordinance which overrides the perceived conflict?\r\n\r\n\tBecause\r\n  of its flexibility as a land use approval mechanism, the PUD may create a\r\n  conflict with the formal land use and intensity designations of a comprehensive\r\n  land use plan.Â  The extent to which such a conflict is fatal depends on whether\r\n  the comprehensive plan in the particular jurisdiction is considered advisory\r\n  only, or whether state legislation mandates that local zoning regulations be\r\n  consistent with the comprehensive plan.Â  In those states in which the\r\n  comprehensive plan is advisory only, the courts have rejected arguments that\r\n  approval of a PUD was invalid because it was inconsistent with the\r\n  comprehensive plan or amounted to spot zoning.Â  \r\n\r\nBrian W. Blaesser, Discretionary\r\n  Land Use Controls: Avoiding Invitations to Abuse of Discretion 288-289\r\n  (2009 Ed.).\r\nCode Section\r\n  6-29-720 (B) requires that in adopting a zoning ordinance, the regulations must\r\n  be made in accordance with the comprehensive plan for the jurisdiction.Â  The\r\n  comprehensive plan for Charleston County clearly states that the land use plan\r\n  area designations and residential density guidelines are recommendations to the County Council (see County of Charleston Comprehensive Plan Section\r\n  3-2-5b and Section 3-2-8(4)).Â  Similarly, in Evans v. Teton County, 73\r\n  P.2d 84 (Idaho 2003), a neighbor challenged approval of a planned unit\r\n  development and subdivision on the basis of nonconformity with the local plan.\r\n  The Supreme Court of Idaho discussed the relationship as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  comprehensive plan is not a legally controlling zoning law, it serves as a\r\n  guide to local government agencies charged with making zoning decisions â€¦. The\r\n  &quot;in accordance with&quot; language of [the zoning enabling legislation]\r\n  does not require zoning decisions to strictly conform to the land use\r\n  designations of the comprehensive plan â€¦. However, a board of county\r\n  commissioners cannot ignore their comprehensive plan when adopting or amending\r\n  zoning ordinances â€¦. Whether approval of a zone change is &quot;in accordance\r\n  with&quot; the comprehensive plan is a question of fact, which can only be overturned\r\n  when the factual findings supporting the zone change are clearly erroneous.\r\n\r\nJulian Conrad\r\n  Juergensmeyer &amp; Thomas E. Roberts, Land Use Planning and\r\nDevelopment Regulation Law 283 (2007).\r\nThe court\r\n  conducted its review on the basis of a strong presumption of validity and\r\n  proceeded on the basis that it must affirm the Board of Commissioners unless it\r\n  violated constitutional or statutory standards, exceeded its statutory\r\n  authority, followed unlawful procedures, was not supported by substantial evidence,\r\n  or was arbitrary and capricious.Â  In other words the courts used the â€œfairly\r\n  debatableâ€ standard accorded to legislative decisions.\r\nI disagree with\r\n  the majorityâ€™s holding that the Charleston County Council cannot modify or\r\n  supersede its own zoning ordinance, if done within the confines of South\r\n  Carolina Code Section 6-29-740.Â  The statute plainly states:\r\n\r\n\tPlanned\r\n  development districts may provide for variations from other ordinances and the\r\n  regulations of other established zoning districts concerning use, setbacks, lot\r\n  size, density, bulk, and other requirements to accommodate flexibility in the\r\n  arrangement of uses for the general purpose of promoting and protecting the\r\n  public health, safety, and general welfare.\r\n\r\nAnd,\r\n  when adopted, the planned development district becomes a new and distinct\r\n  zoning district.\r\nOrdinance\r\n  #1300 found â€œâ€¦after thorough consideration, the County Planning Commission\r\n  recommended in favor of the proposed rezoning;â€¦the rezoning complies in all\r\n  respects with Article 3.4 of the Charleston County Zoning and Land Development\r\n  Regulations;â€¦the development plan meets the objectives of Article 3.5 the\r\n  Charleston County Zoning and Land Development Regulations;â€¦and the development\r\n  plan conforms to and implements the Charleston County Comprehensive Plan.â€\r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, the Court of Appeals correctly ruled that the County Councilâ€™s\r\n  actions were authorized and not arbitrary, unreasonable, or in devious abuse of\r\n  its discretion if the action of the Council in adopting the ordinance was\r\n  fairly debatable. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  This number could be increased to a maximum of 1\r\n  unit per 5 acres if done through Planned Development process, allowing a total\r\n  maximum of 20 units.Â Â  \r\n[2]Â  As to fact based issues, an appellate court\r\n  applies the same standard as the trial court under Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Englert,\r\n    Inc. v. LeafGuard USA, Inc., 377 S.C. 129, 659 S.E.2d 496 (2008).Â  \r\n[3] Â County also relies upon S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  6-29-740, which mimics the language of Â§ 3.5.7, relating to planned\r\n  developments and allows variations from other ordinances and regulations\r\n  concerning use, setbacks, lot size, and density.Â  For the reasons set forth\r\n  below, we find the provisions specifically relating to Countyâ€™s planned\r\n  developments, as set forth in Â§ 4.5.3B of the ZLDR, control.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26750","title":"State v.

Dewain Herring, was convicted of murder and pointing\r\n  and presenting a firearm.Â  We affirm.[1]Â  \r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nHerring\r\n  was charged with the January 29, 2006 shooting of an employee of Chastityâ€™s\r\n  Gold Nightclub (Chastityâ€™s), a strip club in Columbia.Â  The facts giving rise\r\n  to the shooting are as follows.\r\nAfter\r\n  golfing in Aiken with friends on the day of January 28, 2006, at which he had\r\n  consumed numerous beers, Herring stopped by a bar for a few drinks on the way\r\n  home, and then returned home around 7:30 p.m.Â  Herring had a couple more drinks\r\n  at his home with a golfing buddy before the friend left.Â  Herring laid down\r\n  intending to go to sleep, but got up and decided to go a Forest Acres\r\n  restaurant.Â  When the restaurant was closed, Herring changed his mind and went\r\n  to Platinum Plus, a Columbia strip club. Â He had a drink and paid a dancer for\r\n  a lap dance and left Platinum Plus.Â  On his way home, he decided to stop by Chastityâ€™s\r\n  on River Drive; he arrived shortly after 11:00 p.m.Â  According to Herring, he ordered\r\n  a drink at the bar, but he has very little recall of any events for several\r\n  hours thereafter. \r\nAccording\r\n  to witnesses and employees of Chastityâ€™s, Herring purchased a drink and paid\r\n  for a $30.00, three minute lap dance from a dancer named Mia.Â  After the lap\r\n  dance, Herring paid Mia for a $300 dance in what was known as the Champagne room.Â Â Â Â  \r\nMia\r\n  took Herring to the Champagne room and told him to wait while she went to\r\n  freshen up.Â  A bouncer, Carl Weeks, went to check on Herring a few minutes\r\n  later and found him naked and masturbating on the sofa.Â Â  The bouncer told\r\n  Herring he could not do that and told him he would have to leave.Â Â  When\r\n  Herring did not move, the bouncer got the manager, John Johnson (John John).Â \r\n  When they returned, Herring was dressed.Â  Weeks told Herring he would either\r\n  have to leave, or they would call police and have him arrested for solicitation\r\n  of prostitution.Â  According to Weeks, Herring responded, â€œNo.Â  I will fucking\r\n  shoot you.â€Â Â Â  John John and a bouncer named Donnie Hawkins escorted Herring to\r\n  the front door at 11:57 p.m.Â  John John walked outside with Herring and used a\r\n  two-way radio to call Herringâ€™s license plate number out to Weeks, who was\r\n  standing in the doorway, as Herring drove away.Â  Weeks and Hawkins watched as\r\n  Herring backed up his black SUV, and fumbled with his glove compartment with\r\n  his right hand.Â  Herring slowly pulled away, putting down the passenger side\r\n  windows as he went.Â  Hawkins, Weeks and John John had just gone inside when\r\n  they saw Herringâ€™s vehicle coming back down River Drive toward Chastityâ€™s. Â According\r\n  to Hawkins, John John was right inside the door.Â  Hawkins saw a flash of light\r\n  come from the side of the vehicle, and heard John John say, â€œOh shit!â€Â Â  John\r\n  John fell to the floor, having been hit in the left ear by a bullet which came\r\n  through the front door.Â  He died a short while later at the hospital.\r\nUpon\r\n  arriving at the scene of Chastityâ€™s, police were given Herringâ€™s license tag\r\n  number, which was registered to his office address in Columbia.Â  Police\r\n  patrolled the office parking lot, but did not find the vehicle.Â  They then\r\n  determined Herringâ€™s home address and went there at 2:10 a.m. on January 29,\r\n  2006.Â  A police officer, seeing a light on in the garage, peeked in the garage\r\n  window to see if the suspect was there.Â  Although the suspect was not there,\r\n  the officer did see the vehicle, which they realized was Herringâ€™s.Â  They\r\n  knocked on the door and rang the doorbell several times and, receiving no\r\n  answer, they returned to the police station and obtained a search warrant for\r\n  the home.[2] Â Â Â \r\nPolice\r\n  went back to Herringâ€™s residence at approximately 4:00 a.m. to execute the\r\n  search warrant.Â  They rang the doorbell several times but received no answer.Â \r\n  They entered forcibly, announcing they were police with a search warrant.Â \r\n  Officer Linfert testified that he saw Herring in the hallway and recognized him\r\n  from the photo on his driverâ€™s license.Â  Linfert told Herring to get down on\r\n  the ground, but Herring ran back down the hall toward a bedroom.Â  He followed\r\n  Herring to the bedroom, and saw Herring pull a gun from a nightstand and point\r\n  it in his direction.Â  Officer Linfert yelled at him to drop the gun and then\r\n  fired one shot at him.Â  Other officers also opened fire, and Herring was hit in\r\n  the arm.Â  Herring called 9-1-1 and told them he believed there were intruders\r\n  in his home.Â  After talking with the 9-1-1 operator, Herring surrendered upon\r\n  realizing the â€œintrudersâ€ were indeed police officers.Â  \r\nHerring\r\n  initially told police he had not left the house after returning home from Aiken;\r\n  he did not recall going to Chastityâ€™s.Â  When police told him of the video tape which\r\n  showed him entering and leaving Chastityâ€™s, he remembered only being at the\r\n  bar, having a drink, and a gunshot firing; the next memory he had was of police\r\n  bursting into his home.Â  He subsequently began remembering more details, such\r\n  as paying for a lap dance from a light skinned black woman.Â  \r\nBullet\r\n  fragments removed from John Johnâ€™s head conclusively matched a .357 Magnum Ruger owned by Herring; the Ruger was found under some clothing in his bedroom\r\n  closet during a SLED search of the home.[3]Â \r\n  Gunshot residue was found on the passenger side of Herringâ€™s vehicle.Â  A jury\r\n  convicted Herring of murder and pointing and presenting a firearm.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.Â  Did the trial court err in denying Herringâ€™s motions\r\n  to suppress evidence found during the search of his residence?\r\n\t2.Â  Did the trial court err in allowing lay witnesses to\r\n  testify as to their opinion of what could be seen on a videotape which recorded\r\n  Herring as he exited Chastityâ€™s? \r\n\r\n1.Â  SEARCH WARRANTS/SUPPRESSION OF EVIDENCE\r\nHerring\r\n  contends the trial court erred in denying his motion to suppress evidence\r\n  seized by police during the searches of his home and automobile.Â  We disagree.Â Â  \r\na. Initial\r\n  Search\r\nHerring\r\n  contends the initial peek by police into his garage (when his black Â SUV was\r\n  seen), was an illegal search, which thereby led to the issuance of a search warrant.Â \r\n  Accordingly, Herring asserts the subsequent search of his home was the\r\n  impermissible fruit of the illegal garage search, and that police otherwise had\r\n  no basis upon which to search the residence.Â  Herring also contends the\r\n  subsequent SLED search of his home was illegal inasmuch as it a) resulted from\r\n  the two prior illegal searches, and b) the SLED warrant was invalid as it was\r\n  not issued in compliance with S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140.Â  For numerous\r\n  reasons, we find the evidence seized by police was properly admitted.Â  Â Â \r\nRegarding\r\n  the initial search, Herring contends that when police crossed the curtilage of\r\n  his yard and peered into his garage windows, it constituted an illegal search.Â \r\n  The trial court agreed with Herring and held Officer Linfertâ€™s peek into Herringâ€™s garage violated Herringâ€™s\r\n  expectation of privacy. Â However, the\r\n  trial court found that since no evidence was seized as a result of that search,\r\n  there was nothing to suppress; it therefore went on to address the validity of\r\n  the other searches, which it found permissible.Â  \r\nInitially, as\r\n  discussed below, we disagree with the trial courtâ€™s conclusion that Officer Linfertâ€™s initial peek into the garage window constituted an illegal search.Â  Regardless,\r\n  however, we find the peek into the window did not lead to discovery of any further\r\n  evidence, such that it was not â€œfruit of the poisonous treeâ€ and therefore did\r\n  not taint the subsequent searches.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  noted previously, prior to going to Herringâ€™s residence, police responded to a\r\n  shooting at Chastityâ€™s nightclub at which the manager of the club was shot and\r\n  killed.Â  While at Chastityâ€™s, police were given a description of Herringâ€™s\r\n  black SUV, as well as the corresponding South Carolina license plate number\r\n  which was written down by witnesses.Â  Police watched the video which showed the\r\n  suspect as he entered and departed from the nightclub, and police were given a\r\n  color photograph of the suspect from the video.Â  \r\nPolice obtained Herringâ€™s identifying information from the license\r\n  tag number.Â  When they went to the registered address for the vehicle, a\r\n  business office, there was no black SUV in the parking lot.Â  Officer Linfert\r\n  checked the Department of Motor Vehicle website for other addresses listed for\r\n  Herring, which revealed his home address.Â  Based upon this information, police\r\n  went to the address at approximately 2:00 a.m.Â  Officer, seeing a light on in\r\n  the garage, peeked in the garage window to see if the suspect was there.Â \r\n  Although the suspect was not there, Linfert saw the black SUV, and recognized it\r\n  as the suspectâ€™s vehicle.Â  Police knocked on the door and rang the doorbell\r\n  several times; receiving no answer, they returned to the police station and\r\n  obtained a search warrant for the home.Â  \r\nPrivate residences are places in which an individual normally\r\n  expects privacy free of governmental intrusion not authorized by a warrant, and\r\n  that expectation is one society recognizes as justifiable.Â  Accordingly, searches\r\n  and seizures inside a home without a warrant are presumptively unreasonable\r\n  absent exigent circumstances.Â  United States v. Karo, 468 U.S. 705 (1984).Â  The Fourth Amendment extends that same protection to outbuildings in the\r\n  curtilage of the home.Â  United States v. Dunn, 480 U.S. 294 (1987); Rogers v. Pendleton, 249 F.3d 279, 287 (4th Cir.2001).[4] Â \r\nHowever, because the ultimate touchstone of the Fourth Amendment\r\n  is â€œreasonableness,â€ the warrant requirement is subject to certain exceptions. Katz\r\n    v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 357 (1967).Â  The United States Supreme\r\n  Court has recognized that one exigency obviating the requirement for a warrant\r\n  is the need to protect or preserve life or avoid serious injury.Â  Brigham City, Utah v. Stuart, 547 U.S. 398 (2006).Â  An action is\r\n  â€œreasonableâ€ under the Fourth Amendment, regardless of the individual officerâ€™s\r\n  state of mind, â€œas long as the circumstances, viewed objectively, justify [the]\r\n  action.â€ Â Scott v. United States, 436 U.S. 128, 138 (1978).Â  A fairly\r\n  perceived need to act on the spot may justify entry and search under the\r\n  exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement.Â  Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 770-771 (1966).Â  The likelihood a suspect will imminently\r\n  flee is also an exigency warranting such an intrusion.Â  Johnson v. United States, 333 U.S. 10, 15 (1948).Â  Protecting the safety of police officers has also been\r\n  held an exigent circumstance.Â  Chimel v. California, 395 U.S. 752 (1969).Â  A warrantless search is justified under the exigent circumstances\r\n  doctrine to prevent a suspect from fleeing or where there is a risk of danger\r\n  to police or others inside or outside a dwelling. Â Minnesota v. Olson,\r\n  495 U.S. 91, 100 (1990). Â In such circumstances, a protective sweep of the\r\n  premises may be permitted. See Maryland v. Buie, 494 U.S. 325, 337 (1990); cf. State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C. 344, 592 S.E.2d 344\r\n  (Ct. App. 2004).\r\nUnder the circumstances presented, we find the exigencies of the\r\n  situation justified Officer Linfertâ€™s look into Herringâ€™s garage at 2:00 a.m.Â \r\n  It is undisputed that police had knowledge of Herringâ€™s identity, his\r\n  residence, the make and model of his vehicle, and his license tag number.Â \r\n  Officer Linfert testified that upon arriving at the home, he saw a light on in\r\n  the garage and therefore looked through the window to see if the suspect was\r\n  inside.Â  Police officers were looking for a suspected murderer whom they knew\r\n  was likely to be armed with a deadly weapon.Â  \r\nWe find it was objectively reasonable for Officer Linfert to take\r\n  precautions to protect his own safety, and the safety of the officers around\r\n  him, by looking into the garage to see if the suspect was there.Â  When nobody\r\n  was in the garage, police followed proper procedure by knocking on the door and\r\n  ringing the doorbell.Â Â  Receiving no answer, they stationed men at the house\r\n  and went to obtain a warrant.Â  Given the exigent circumstances then and there\r\n  presenting, we find Officer Linfertâ€™s minimal intrusion was objectively reasonable\r\n  and did not constitute a Fourth Amendment violation.Â  Cf. Chimel v. California.Â  \r\nMoreover, Officer Linfertâ€™s peek into the garage yielded no\r\n  evidence against Herring.Â  Police already had knowledge of the make, model and\r\n  license plate number of the vehicle the suspect drove; they knew the automobile\r\n  was registered to Herring, and they knew his residential address was 406 Alexander Circle.Â  Officer Linfertâ€™s observation of the vehicle in the garage yielded no\r\n  evidence which further inculpated Herring.Â Â  We find the trial court erred in\r\n  holding this initial â€œsearchâ€ violated Herringâ€™s Fourth Amendment rights; the de\r\n    minimis intrusion to secure the officersâ€™ safety did not necessitate\r\n  suppression.\r\n\r\nb. Search of residence\r\nHerring next asserts the subsequently issued warrant was defective\r\n  such that the search conducted by the Richland County Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\n  (RCSD) was illegal.Â  He contends the affidavit supporting the warrant failed to\r\n  connect his residence to the crime at Chastityâ€™s; he also contends the\r\n  information in the affidavit was false because the officer who prepared the\r\n  affidavit did not actually appear before the magistrate but, instead, sent\r\n  another officer.Â  We find the warrant was supported by probable cause and was properly\r\n  issued.\r\nThe affidavit states that deputies responded to Chastityâ€™s to find\r\n  the Victim, John Johnson, who had been shot in the head and who subsequently died\r\n  upon arrival at the hospital.Â  Witnesses at Chastityâ€™s described the suspect,\r\n  the clothing he was wearing, the car he was driving as a black Toyota\r\n  Forerunner, and gave the license tag number of SC 1891.Â  Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicle records indicated the car was registered to Dewain Herring, of 1361\r\n  Landmark Drive, which was a closed business.Â  A search of Richland County records provided an additional address for Herring at 460 Alexander Circle.Â  Based upon\r\n  this information, the affidavit lists the property sought as â€œfirearms,\r\n  ammunition, burgundy sweater, white turtleneck shirt, khaki pants, eyeglasses,\r\n  black 1996 Toyota Forerunner, SC/EU1891, and any and all other evidence\r\n  associated to a shooting incident.â€Â  \r\nA\r\n  search warrant may issue only upon a finding of probable cause. State v.\r\n    Baccus, 367 S.C. 41, 625 S.E.2d 216 (2006), cert. denied 129 S.Ct.\r\n  733 (2008).Â  The duty of the reviewing court is to ensure the issuing\r\n  magistrate had a substantial basis upon which to conclude that probable cause\r\n  existed.Â  Id.; State v. Adams, 291 S.C. 132, 352 S.E.2d 483\r\n  (1987).Â  A â€œtotality-of-the-circumstancesâ€ test is utilized in probable cause\r\n  determinations:\r\n\r\n\tThe task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical,\r\n  common-sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the\r\n  affidavit before him, including the â€œveracityâ€ and â€œbasis of knowledgeâ€ of\r\n  persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that\r\n  contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.\r\n\r\nIllinois v. Gates, 462 U.S. 213, 238 (1983).Â  \r\nWe find\r\n  the affidavit sufficient to establish probable cause for police to look for\r\n  Herring, a murder weapon, and the Toyota Forerunner at his known residence.Â Â  \r\nHerring\r\n  asserts the RCSD warrant was defective because, notwithstanding the affidavit\r\n  contained the name of Officer Linfert at the top, it was actually Officer Davis\r\n  who appeared before the Magistrate.Â  However, Officer Linfert clarified that\r\n  the reason his name was listed is that Officer Davis did not have a search\r\n  warrant form on his computer, and the form was typed by Linfert on his computer\r\n  and his name was automatically inserted at the top; Linfert simply forgot to\r\n  change the name to Davis.Â  Officer Davis personally appeared before the\r\n  magistrate and swore to the information; he was familiar with the information\r\n  and background of the case, having been to Chastityâ€™s and having interviewed\r\n  the witnesses.Â  We find the fact that Linfertâ€™s name was at the top of the\r\n  affidavit did not vitiate the validity of the warrant.Â  State v. Shupper,\r\n  263 S.C. 53, 207 S.E.2d 799 (1974) (typographical error did not affect validity\r\n  of search warrant).Â  Accordingly, we find the evidence seized during the RCSDâ€™s\r\n  search of the residence was properly admitted by the trial court.\r\nc. SLED Search\r\nFinally,\r\n  Herring challenges the search performed by SLED.Â  He contends the SLED warrant,\r\n  which was obtained by facsimile, was invalid; he also asserts the methodology\r\n  employed, which was authorized by an order of the Chief Justice,[5] violates the search warrant statute, S.C.\r\n  Code Ann Â§ 17-13-140.Â Â  We find the trial court properly upheld SLEDâ€™s search\r\n  of the residence.Â Â Â  Â  Â \r\nSLED was called in to investigate after the sheriffâ€™s deputies wounded\r\n  Herring during their attempt to arrest him at the home.Â  SLED obtained a\r\n  warrant utilizing the telephone procedure set forth in the Chief Justiceâ€™s\r\n  order of July 2001.Â  Agent Lawrence testified that he had prepared the search\r\n  warrant, and faxed it to Magistrate McDuffie, who was in bond court.Â  The\r\n  Magistrate swore him over the phone.Â  Although SLED was not directly\r\n  investigating the murder, they were investigating the shooting by police\r\n  officers, and were looking for firearms, cartridges, blood, projectiles, blood,\r\n  and any evidence relating to a shooting incident at that address.Â  As a result\r\n  of the search, they found the khaki pants, white turtle neck, burgundy sweater\r\n  Herring was wearing at the time of the shooting, and two weapons, a Smith and\r\n  Wesson .357 revolver and a Ruger .357 pistol.Â  The Ruger was in the bedroom closet\r\n  under some clothes.Â  \r\n\r\n\tS.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 states, in pertinent part:\r\n\tA warrant issued hereunder shall be issued only upon affidavit sworn\r\n  to before the magistrate, municipal judicial officer, or judge of a court\r\n  of record establishing the grounds for the warrant. If the magistrate,\r\n  municipal judge, or other judicial officer abovementioned is satisfied that the\r\n  grounds for the application exist or that there is probable cause to believe\r\n  that they exist, he shall issue a warrant identifying the property and naming\r\n  or describing the person or place to be searched. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â  Herring asserts the statute requires the affiant appear before the\r\n  magistrate in person.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nContrary\r\n  to Herringâ€™s contention, the language does not state an affidavit must be sworn\r\n  in person.Â Â  It only requires the affidavit be sworn.Â  Officer Lawrence, who\r\n  prepared the affidavit, was sworn over the telephone by the Magistrate.Â  We\r\n  find this complies with the literal terms of the statute such that there was no\r\n  defect in the warrant.Â  Cf. Gay v. Ariail, 381 S.C. 341, 673\r\n  S.E.2d 418 (2009) (literal terms of statute prevail); Collins v. Doe,\r\n  352 S.C. 462, 574 S.E.2d 739 (2002) (where terms of a statute are clear, there\r\n  is no room for construction).Â  \r\nHerring\r\n  cites State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 352 S.E.2d 471 (1987) as\r\n  supporting his contention that issuance of a warrant via facsimile was\r\n  invalid.Â  In McKnight, police officers appeared before a magistrate to\r\n  obtain a warrant, but did not complete an affidavit in support thereof.Â \r\n  Notwithstanding the officers were sworn and gave oral testimony to the\r\n  magistrate, we held a â€œsearch warrant affidavit which itself is insufficient to\r\n  establish probable cause may be supplemented before the magistrate by sworn\r\n  oral testimony. . . . However, sworn oral testimony, standing alone, does not\r\n  satisfy the statute.â€ 291 S.C. at 113, 352 S.e.2d at 473 (internal citations\r\n  omitted).Â  In McKnight, we found the mandatory requirement of an\r\n  affidavit lacking, thereby requiring suppression.Â Â  The Court noted Â§ 17-13-140\r\n  imposes stricter requirements than does the Fourth Amendment, and that â€œ[a]\r\n  search warrant that would survive constitutional scrutiny may still be\r\n  defective under the statute.â€Â  Id.Â  \r\nRecently,\r\n  however, we recognized that there is a â€œâ€˜good faithâ€™ exception to the statuteâ€™s\r\n  [S.C. Code Ann. 17-13-140] requirements where the officers make a good faith\r\n  attempt to comply with the statuteâ€™s affidavit procedures.â€Â  State v. Covert,\r\n  382 S.C. 205, 675 S.E.2d 740 (2009), citing McKnight.[6] \r\nWe find\r\n  the present circumstances give rise to such a good faith exception.Â  It was\r\n  4:00 in the morning, and SLED agents were attempting to obtain a warrant to\r\n  investigate a shooting by Richland County Sheriffâ€™s deputies of a prominent\r\n  Columbia attorney.Â  We hold the officers made a good faith attempt to comply\r\n  with the affidavit procedures, and accordingly, we affirm the trial courtâ€™s\r\n  ruling.Â  Â \r\nMoreover,\r\n  even if we were to hold the SLED search illegal, we would hold any error was\r\n  harmless.Â  A videotape from Chastityâ€™s shows Herring entering and leaving the\r\n  club.Â  Several witnesses identified Herring from the videotape, and his vehicle\r\n  and license tag number were identified.Â  Two witnesses saw him drive away from\r\n  the club, and then testified they saw his vehicle returning down River Drive.Â \r\n  Donald Hawkins saw Herringâ€™s car come back into the parking lot, saw a flash\r\n  come from the side of the vehicle, heard John John say â€œoh shit,â€ and then saw\r\n  that John John had been hit by a bullet.Â  Further, although Herring denied\r\n  intentionally shooting anyone, he admitted he owns several guns, including a\r\n  .357 Ruger, which he usually carries with him in his Toyota Forerunner, and he admitted\r\n  he had some memory of a gun going off.Â  Finally, gunshot residue was found on\r\n  the passenger side of the vehicle, which was ultimately connected to Herringâ€™s\r\n  Ruger.Â  Accordingly, admission of the evidence seized in the SLED search, even\r\n  if erroneous, was harmless.Â  State v. Gillian, 373 S.C. 601, 646 S.E.2d\r\n  872 (2007); State v. Garner, 304 S.C. 220, 222, 403 S.E.2d 631, 632 (1991)\r\n  (holding improperly admitted evidence harmless error given overwhelming\r\n  evidence of guilt). Â We affirm the trial courtâ€™s ruling concerning the SLED\r\n  search.Â  \r\n2.Â  LAY\r\n  OPINIONS REGARDING VIDEOTAPE\r\nHerring\r\n  next contends the trial court should not have allowed lay witnesses to testify\r\n  as to what they could see on the videotape of Herring exiting Chastityâ€™s, because\r\n  they did not personally observe the events in question but only viewed them on\r\n  a tape; he also asserts reversible error in the denial of his motion for a\r\n  mistrial.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  admission or exclusion of testimonial evidence falls within the sound\r\n  discretion of the trial court, whose decision will not be disturbed on appeal\r\n  absent abuse resulting in prejudice.Â  State v. Holder, 382 S.C. 278, 676\r\n  S.E.2d 690 (2009).Â  Similarly, whether to grant or deny a mistrial is within\r\n  the discretion of the trial court and will not be reversed on appeal absent an\r\n  abuse of discretion.Â  State v. Sweet, 374 S.C. 1, 647 S.E.2d 202\r\n  (2007).Â  The grant of a motion for a mistrial is an extreme measure which\r\n  should be taken only where an incident is so grievous that the prejudicial\r\n  effect can be removed in no other way.

KITTREDGE, J., concurring in a separate opinion in\r\n  which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â  I concur in affirming the\r\n  convictions and sentence of H. Dewain Herring.Â  I join the majority in all\r\n  respects save its determination concerning the initial search.Â  I disagree that,\r\n  from an objective standard, exigent circumstances existed upon the arrival of\r\n  law enforcement at Herringâ€™s residence two hours after the shooting of John Johnson\r\n  at Chastityâ€™s strip club.\r\nWhat\r\n  the majority characterizes as a â€œpeek by police into [Herringâ€™s] garageâ€ was,\r\n  in my judgment, an unwarranted trespass and warrantless search.Â  Upon the\r\n  arrival of the police at Herringâ€™s residence approximately two hours after the\r\n  crime, exigent circumstances for Fourth Amendment purposes did not exist.Â  More\r\n  to the point, nothing occurred at the residence to create an exigency to\r\n  justify a warrantless search.Â  There was neither hot pursuit, nor an imminent\r\n  threat of danger to police or others, nor other conditions that reasonably fit\r\n  exigent circumstances jurisprudence. Â See State v. Abdullah, 357 S.C.\r\n  344, 351, 592 S.E.2d 344, 348 (Ct. App. 2004) (discussing\r\n  law of exigent circumstances).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  majority acknowledges that at the time of â€œOfficer Linfertâ€™s peek into the\r\n  garage â€¦[,] [i]t is undisputed that police had knowledge of Herringâ€™s identity,\r\n  his residence, the make and model of his vehicle, and his license tag number.â€Â \r\n  The police responded to this purported exigent circumstance by ringing the\r\n  doorbell.Â  When no one answered the doorbell, police â€œstationed men at the\r\n  house and went to obtain a warrant.â€Â  Even from a subjective point, it is clear\r\n  that law enforcement did not harbor the view that exigent circumstances\r\n  justified a warrantless search.Â  \r\nAlthough\r\n  I believe the peek into the garage constituted an illegal search, I agree with\r\n  the majority that the search yielded no evidence.Â  The evidence at the\r\n  residence linking Herring to the shooting was seized as a result of the\r\n  subsequent valid SLED search warrant.Â  \r\nPLEICONES, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The appeal was certified to this Court from the Court of Appeals on motion of\r\n  counsel for Herring.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Several officers remained outside the premises\r\n  while the warrant was obtained.\r\n[3] Â SLED searched the residence relative to the shooting which\r\n  occurred between police and Herring at the time of Herringâ€™s arrest.Â  \r\n[4]Â  It is equally well settled that searches and\r\n  seizures of property in plain view are presumptively reasonable.Â  What a person\r\n  knowingly exposes to the public, even in his own home or office, is not a\r\n  subject of Fourth Amendment protection.Â  California v. Ciraolo, 476 U.S. 207, 213 (1986) (quoting Katz v. United States, 389 U.S. 347, 351 (1967).\r\n[5] Â See http://www.sccourts.org/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2001-07-26-01.Â \r\n  The order was issued pursuant to Art. V, Â§ 4 of the SC CONST (Chief Justice of\r\n  the Supreme Court shall be the administrative head of the unified judicial\r\n  system).Â  The order allows for issuance of search warrants by facsimile under\r\n  controlled conditions, and sets forth the requirements therefore.Â  \r\n[6]Â  In Covert, we left open the question of\r\n  whether a good faith exception applies when â€œthe officers reasonably believe\r\n  the warrant is valid when the search is made, but is subsequently determined to\r\n  be invalid.â€Â  Id. at ___, 675 S.E.2d at 742-743.Â  Given our recognition of an exception for officersâ€™\r\n  good faith attempt to comply with the affidavit requirement, we find no reason\r\n  not to extend such a good faith exception to a warrant reasonably believed to\r\n  be valid, but later determined invalid.Â  Accordingly, even if we were to\r\n  determine the affidavit was improper, we would find the SLED agents acted in\r\n  good faith and reasonably believed the warrant valid, such that the search\r\n  should be upheld.\r\n[7]Â  The remaining issues are affirmed pursuant to\r\n  SCACR Rule 220(B)(1) and the following authorities:Â  Issue 4 (failure to charge\r\n  the law of accident)- State v.

Anderson of first-degree burglary, the trial judge sentenced him to\r\n  twenty years in prison.Â  Anderson appealed his conviction and sentence to the\r\n  Court of Appeals.Â  In his appeal, Anderson argued the trial judge erred in\r\n  admitting into evidence an unauthenticated ten-print card as maintained in the &quot;Automated\r\n  Fingerprint Identification System&quot; (AFIS).Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed\r\n  Anderson's conviction and sentence.Â  State v. Anderson, 378 S.C. 243,\r\n  662 S.E.2d 461 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  This Court granted Anderson's petition for a\r\n  writ of certiorari to review the decision of the Court of Appeals.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL HISTORY\r\nOn\r\n  August 15, 2003, Priscilla Ward returned home after work around 11:10 a.m. to\r\n  find someone had broken into her home.Â  The intruder had entered the home by\r\n  breaking a bedroom window.Â  Following the break-in, Ward and her husband\r\n  discovered several items missing from the home, which included jewelry and\r\n  firearms.Â  \r\nStephen Hardee, an\r\n  officer with the Horry County Police Department, responded to investigate the\r\n  break-in at the Wards' home.Â  During his investigation, Hardee lifted two\r\n  fingerprints from the broken window.Â  At trial, Hardee identified two lift\r\n  cards on which he transferred the latent fingerprints from the crime scene.\r\nIn an effort to\r\n  identify the intruder's fingerprints, the State offered the testimony of Sergeant\r\n  Jeffrey Gause, an expert in the field of fingerprint analysis.Â  Gause testified\r\n  he analyzed the latent fingerprints found at the Wards' home by checking them\r\n  through the AFIS.Â  In describing the AFIS, Gause explained a digital camera\r\n  takes a picture of the latent print which is downloaded into the computer.Â  The\r\n  computer then sends the picture through the AFIS, which searches the database\r\n  for fingerprints with comparable characteristics.Â  As a result of this process,\r\n  the AFIS produces twenty to thirty possible matches.Â  The operator then has to\r\n  physically review each print to compare similarities in ridge detail and the\r\n  pattern of the prints.Â  In using this technology, Gause determined that the\r\n  latent print found at the Wards' home matched a known print in the database\r\n  with the identifying number SC00454508.Â  In explaining this identification\r\n  number, Gause testified that when a person is arrested, the police or jail\r\n  personnel roll the person's fingerprints onto a ten-print card. Â These\r\n  ten-print cards are then retained on file through SLED and the FBI.Â  Gause\r\n  testified the ten-print card matching the identifying number SC00454508\r\n  belonged to Anderson.Â  \r\nImmediately after\r\n  this statement, Anderson's counsel objected to any evidence concerning Anderson's\r\n  ten-print card.Â  Counsel argued the rolled ten-print card from the database was\r\n  inadmissible given it had not been properly authenticated pursuant to State\r\n    v. Rich, 293 S.C. 172, 359 S.E.2d 281 (1987).[1]Â  \r\nAfter considering\r\n  this Court's decision in Rich, the trial judge ruled that the State, in\r\n  order to authenticate the ten-print card, had to present testimony as to when\r\n  and how it was taken.Â  In response to this ruling, Anderson's counsel asserted\r\n  the State was also required to establish by whom the fingerprints were taken. Â The\r\n  trial judge disagreed with this interpretation of Rich, finding the\r\n  State did not have to show which particular officer took the fingerprints.Â \r\n  Instead, the State was only required to present testimony as to which\r\n  correctional facility[2] took the fingerprints. \r\nFollowing the judge's\r\n  ruling, the State offered the testimony of Lieutenant Joseph Means, who is in\r\n  charge of the crime information center at SLED and oversees the AFIS. Â Means\r\n  explained that SLED maintains ten-print cards on every person who is arrested\r\n  in South Carolina.Â  According to Means, the AFIS stores all the digital\r\n  fingerprint images of every ten-print card in South Carolina.Â  In order to\r\n  positively identify each person who has been arrested, a unique state\r\n  identifying number is assigned to the person at the time of the first arrest.Â  This\r\n  identifying number remains constant regardless of the number of times the\r\n  person is arrested.Â  Means testified that the ten-print card with\r\n  identification number SC00454508 belonged to Anderson and was originated from a\r\n  law enforcement agency on April 7, 2004. Â He further stated he was the\r\n  custodian of the ten-print cards, and when a ten-print card is submitted to\r\n  SLED it is maintained in the condition in which it arrives.Â  Means emphasized\r\n  that every fingerprint is unique and that it could not be changed legally. \r\nOn\r\n  cross-examination, Means acknowledged that it was possible for a fingerprint to\r\n  be altered.Â  He further admitted that he was not present when Anderson's\r\n  fingerprints were taken for the ten-print card.Â Â Â  However, he stated Anderson's\r\n  ten-print card was sent to him and entered into the AFIS by someone in his\r\n  office. \r\nOver Anderson's objection,\r\n  the trial judge admitted into evidence Anderson's ten-print card. Â Ultimately,\r\n  the jury convicted Anderson of first-degree burglary.Â  The trial judge\r\n  sentenced him to twenty years in prison.\r\nOn appeal, Anderson challenged his conviction and sentence on the ground the trial judge erred in\r\n  admitting into evidence the ten-print card as maintained in the AFIS.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals affirmed, holding the State presented sufficient evidence to\r\n  authenticate the ten-print card as Anderson's known fingerprints.Â  State v.\r\n    Anderson, 378 S.C. 243, 662 S.E.2d 461 (Ct. App. 2008).Â  More specifically,\r\n  the Court of Appeals stated:\r\n\r\n\t[W]e\r\n  find the evidence presented by the State, showing when and where the\r\n  fingerprints were taken and how they were submitted to SLED, and describing the\r\n  process implemented by law enforcement for taking the fingerprints and\r\n  maintaining an accurate record of them in AFIS, was sufficient to authenticate\r\n  the fingerprints as Anderson's known prints.Â  \r\n\r\nId. at 249, 662 S.E.2d at 464.\r\nThis Court granted\r\n  Anderson's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the decision of the\r\n  Court of Appeals.\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAnderson argues the Court of Appeals erred in finding\r\n  the trial judge properly admitted the master fingerprint card with Anderson's known\r\n  fingerprints.Â  He contends the fingerprint card was inadmissible given the\r\n  person who actually took the fingerprints did not testify and, thus, the card\r\n  was not authenticated.Â  Because the fingerprint evidence was the only evidence\r\n  connecting Anderson to the crime scene, he contends the admission of the\r\n  fingerprint card constituted reversible error and could not be considered\r\n  harmless error.Â  \r\nÂ &quot;The admission of\r\n  evidence is within the discretion of the trial court\r\n  and will not be reversed absent an abuse of discretion.&quot;Â  State v.\r\n    Pagan, 369 S.C. 201, 208, 631 S.E.2d 262, 265 (2006). Â &quot;An abuse of\r\n  discretion occurs when the conclusions of the trial court either lack\r\n  evidentiary support or are controlled by an error of law.&quot;Â  Id.\r\nThe\r\n  analysis regarding the admissibility of the fingerprint card involves a\r\n  two-prong approach.Â  The initial question is whether the fingerprint card was\r\n  testimonial in nature and, if so, fell within an exception to the hearsay\r\n  rule.Â  If a hearsay exception is applicable, then the next consideration in\r\n  assessing admissibility is authentication.Â  \r\nRegarding the first\r\n  question, Anderson never challenged the admissibility of the fingerprint card\r\n  on the ground that it constituted inadmissible hearsay.Â  Thus, we confine our analysis\r\n  solely to a determination of the authenticity of the fingerprint card. [3] \r\nAs\r\n  recognized by the Court of Appeals, the decision in the instant case is governed\r\n  by an interpretation and application of State v. Rich, 293 S.C. 172, 359\r\n  S.E.2d 281 (1987).[4] Â \r\nIn Rich,\r\n  the defendant was convicted of second-degree burglary, grand larceny, and\r\n  failure to stop for a blue light stemming from a break-in at a pharmacy.Â  At\r\n  trial, the SLED agent who lifted the latent fingerprints at the crime scene\r\n  testified regarding his comparison of the these fingerprints with the &quot;inked\r\n  impressions&quot; of a set of fingerprints on file.Â  Id. at 173, 359\r\n  S.E.2d at 281.Â  Over the objection of Rich, the trial judge admitted the\r\n  testimony.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Rich contended the inked impressions were erroneously admitted into evidence\r\n  because the State failed to lay the proper foundation.Â  Id.Â  This Court\r\n  agreed with Rich and reversed his convictions and sentences.Â  \r\nInitially,\r\n  this Court recognized the admission of police fingerprint records is generally\r\n  considered not to violate the prohibition against hearsay, either under the\r\n  public records exception[5] or the business record exception.[6]Â  Id. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 281.Â  We, however, emphasized that the\r\n  proponent of the evidence must still comply with authentication requirements.Â  Id.Â  \r\nGiven\r\n  the State neither attempted to lay a foundation that the fingerprints on the\r\n  master file card were in fact those of Rich, nor sought to introduce the master\r\n  file card, this Court found the police fingerprint records should have been\r\n  excluded from evidence.Â  Id. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 282.Â  We explained\r\n  that the testimony regarding the police fingerprint records was inadmissible &quot;'without\r\n  evidence as to when and by whom the card was made and that the prints on the\r\n  card were in fact those of [the] defendant.'&quot;Â  Id. at 174, 359\r\n  S.E.2d at 282 (quoting State v. Foster, 200 S.E.2d 782, 793 (N.C. 1973)).Â  \r\nBecause\r\n  the SLED agent should not have been allowed to testify about data contained in\r\n  an unauthenticated document, which was crucial to the State's case, we found\r\n  the admission of the evidence constituted reversible error.Â  Id. at 174,\r\n  359 S.E.2d at 282.\r\nThe\r\n  facts in Anderson's case provided the Court of Appeals an opportunity to\r\n  interpret and apply this Court's decision in Rich.Â  As will be\r\n  discussed, we find the Court of Appeals correctly held the State presented\r\n  sufficient evidence to authenticate the ten-print card.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  discussed by the Court of Appeals, Rich does not establish an\r\n  authentication requirement that necessitates the testimony of the actual person\r\n  who took the fingerprints on the master fingerprint card.Â  Instead, it merely\r\n  requires &quot;'evidence as to when and by whom the card was made and\r\n  that the prints on the card were in fact those of this defendant.'&quot;Â  Anderson,\r\n  378 S.C. at 248, 662 S.E.2d at 464 (quoting Rich, 293 S.C. at 174, 359\r\n  S.E.2d at 282).Â Â  \r\nHere,\r\n  through the testimony of Gause and Means, the State provided evidence that: Â Anderson's\r\n  known ten-print card was taken at a correctional facility on April 7, 2004; it\r\n  was submitted to SLED; it was maintained in the condition in which it arrived;\r\n  and it was stored in the AFIS.Â  Thus, we agree with the Court of Appeals that\r\n  the State satisfied its burden of authentication under Rich.Â  Additionally,\r\n  we find the instant case is readily distinguishable from Rich given the\r\n  State introduced into evidence Anderson's known fingerprint card and provided\r\n  testimony which substantiated the process used in obtaining and maintaining\r\n  this fingerprint card.\r\nBecause this Court\r\n  decided Rich prior to our state's adoption of the Rules of Evidence,[7] we believe it is necessary to supplement the analysis in Rich with an\r\n  application of the pertinent Rules of Evidence as well as subsequent appellate\r\n  decisions.Â  Given the significance this Court has placed on the Rules of\r\n  Evidence, we take this opportunity to clarify our decision in Rich.\r\nIn\r\n  terms of initial admissibility,[8] Rule 901(a) provides: Â &quot;[t]he\r\n  requirement of authentication or identification as a condition precedent to\r\n  admissibility is satisfied by evidence sufficient to support a finding that the\r\n  matter in question is what its proponent claims.&quot;Â  Rule 901(a), SCRE.Â  Although not exhaustive, Rule 901 further provides\r\n  examples of authentication or identification which conform with the\r\n  requirements of the rule.Â  Rule 901(b), SCRE.Â  We find several of these illustrations\r\n  are applicable in the instant case.Â  \r\nFirst,\r\n  subsection four provides that a proponent of physical evidence may satisfy the\r\n  threshold authentication requirement of Rule 901(a) by &quot;internal patterns, or other distinctive\r\n  characteristics, taken in conjunction with circumstances.&quot;Â  Rule\r\n  901(b)(4), SCRE. Â Here, Sergeant Gause, an expert in the field of\r\n  fingerprint analysis, analyzed the latent fingerprints found at the Wards' home\r\n  by checking them through the AFIS.Â  Using this technology and comparing the characteristics\r\n  of the latent fingerprints with those of the known prints, Gause determined\r\n  that Anderson's known prints matched the latent prints. Â Gause further\r\n  explained that the prints on the master fingerprint card were taken at a\r\n  correctional facility, on a specific date, and assigned a unique state\r\n  identifying number.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  find this testimony regarding the distinctive characteristics of the ten-print\r\n  card was sufficient to support a finding that the fingerprint card was properly\r\n  authenticated.Â  See State v. Lee, 577 So. 2d 1193, 1196 (La.

Patterson,\r\n  277 F.3d 709, 713-14 (4th Cir. 2002) (holding, pursuant to Federal Rule of\r\n  Evidence 901(b)(4), government provided sufficient authentication of a\r\n  Tenprinter image where testimony that one of the fingerprints recorded by the\r\n  Tenprinter matched the fingerprint recovered from the crime scene evidence); United\r\n    States v. Lauder, 409 F.3d 1254, 1265-66 (10th Cir. 2005) (referencing\r\n  Federal Rule of Evidence 901(b)(4) and finding government presented sufficient\r\n  evidence that fingerprint card generated by the &quot;live-skin&quot; method\r\n  accurately reflected defendant's fingerprints where evidence was presented\r\n  that:Â  defendant's known fingerprint was properly recorded; the &quot;live-skin&quot;\r\n  method functioned properly when it recorded the defendant's print; and the\r\n  chain of custody was maintained).\r\nSecond,\r\n  subsection seven, the public records example, provides for authentication by &quot;[e]vidence that a writing authorized by law to be\r\n  recorded or filed and in fact recorded or filed in a public office, or a\r\n  purported public record, report, statement, or data compilation, in any form,\r\n  is from the public office where items of this nature are kept.&quot; Rule\r\n  901(b)(7), SCRE.Â  Here, Lieutenant Means and Sergeant Gause testified that law\r\n  enforcement takes the fingerprints of every person who is arrested in this\r\n  state.[9]Â \r\n  SLED then receives and maintains these known prints on the ten-print card in\r\n  the condition in which it arrives.Â  The AFIS stores all of the digital\r\n  fingerprint images of every ten-print card in South Carolina.Â  We conclude this\r\n  testimony established the fingerprint card of Anderson constituted a public\r\n  report or record[10] given its production was authorized by law to be recorded or filed at SLED. Â See State v. DuBray, 77 P.3d 247, 259-60 (Mont. 2003) (concluding, based\r\n  on Rule 901(b)(7), that known fingerprint card of person that defendant\r\n  attempted to cast suspicion upon was properly authenticated given it was taken\r\n  and preserved by law enforcement and, thus, constituted a &quot;public report\r\n  or record&quot;); Rule 901(b)(7), SCRE, cmt. (citing Rich and providing\r\n  for authentication of police fingerprint records under this subsection); see\r\n    also State v. Carruth, 166 S.W.3d 589, 591 (Mo. Ct. App. 2005)\r\n  (holding AFIS fingerprint card was admissible under business records exception\r\n  to the hearsay rule where witness, who did not take the actual prints,\r\n  established the standard procedures used by the jurisdiction to collect and\r\n  maintain fingerprints and testified regarding her determination that the latent\r\n  prints and the known prints came from the defendant).\r\nThird,\r\n  as referenced by the Court of Appeals, subsection nine provides for\r\n  authentication by &quot;[e]vidence\r\n  describing a process or system used to produce a result and showing that the\r\n  process or system produces an accurate result.&quot;Â  Rule 901(b)(9), SCRE.Â  The\r\n  State in this case presented evidence regarding:Â  when and where Anderson's\r\n  fingerprints were taken; how they were submitted to SLED; the process\r\n  implemented by law enforcement for taking the fingerprints; and how an accurate\r\n  record of them was maintained in the AFIS.Â  We hold this testimony satisfied\r\n  the authentication requirement of Rule 901.\r\nEven\r\n  if the evidence presented by the State did not precisely fit within one of the enumerated\r\n  examples provided in Rule 901, we find Anderson's known ten-print card was,\r\n  nevertheless, authenticated under a more generalized approach to Rule 901.Â  The\r\n  State provided expert testimony which linked the latent fingerprints with\r\n  Anderson's known prints.Â  Sergeant Gause, who was qualified as an expert in the\r\n  field of fingerprint analysis, testified regarding the method and technology in\r\n  which he analyzed the latent fingerprints with the known prints.Â  This\r\n  testimony included a thorough explanation of how an arrestee's fingerprints are\r\n  taken, stored, and maintained.Â  Using the officially-maintained known\r\n  fingerprints, Gause opined that the latent print found at the Wards' home\r\n  matched Anderson's known print in the AFIS database.Â  Thus, this expert\r\n  testimony was sufficient &quot;to support a finding that the matter in question\r\n  [was] what [the State] claim[ed].&quot;Â  Rule 901(a), SCRE; see State\r\n    v. Foreman, 954 A.2d 135, 153-62 (Conn. 2008) (concluding State established\r\n  proper foundation for admission of &quot;live-scan&quot; fingerprint card identified\r\n  as that of defendant under Rule of Evidence 901 where &quot;highly trained&quot;\r\n  latent fingerprint examiner testified regarding the methodology used to compare\r\n  known and unknown fingerprints and his conclusion that the print from defendant's\r\n  finger was a &quot;100 percent match&quot; with the unknown print obtained from\r\n  the crime scene).\r\nAs\r\n  we interpret Anderson's argument, he is primarily concerned with whether the\r\n  known fingerprints could have been tampered with or altered in some way.Â  In\r\n  order to alleviate this concern, Anderson contends that Rich should be\r\n  strictly construed to require the person who actually took his fingerprints to\r\n  testify regarding the reliability or authenticity of the ten-print card.Â  \r\nTo\r\n  require this type of testimony would create an unrealistic standard and, at\r\n  times, an insurmountable obstacle for the State.Â  Given the thousands of\r\n  fingerprints on file with SLED, it would be difficult to locate and procure\r\n  testimony from the actual person.Â  There may be instances where the person has\r\n  changed jobs, has relocated out of state, or may be deceased.Â  If the actual\r\n  person is unavailable for any of these reasons, then the State could never\r\n  definitively establish the authenticity of a suspect's fingerprint card.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIn\r\n  view of these factors, we find the Court of Appeals correctly interpreted Rich as not requiring such a strict authentication requirement.Â  Thus, based on the\r\n  foregoing, we conclude the State presented sufficient evidence to satisfy the\r\n  authentication requirements pursuant to Rich and, more specifically,\r\n  Rule 901.Â  \r\n\r\nAccordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals is\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â State v. Rich, 293 S.C. 172, 359 S.E.2d 281\r\n  (1987) (holding admission of fingerprint comparison without proper\r\n  authentication required reversal of conviction given crucial nature of evidence\r\n  to the State's case).\r\n[2]Â  Although Anderson's counsel still maintained his\r\n  objection to the testimony, he consented to the State's use of the term &quot;law\r\n  enforcement agency&quot; as opposed to a state &quot;correctional facility&quot;\r\n  apparently in an effort to avoid any possible inference of a prior conviction.Â \r\n  Because any issue regarding the admission of prior bad act evidence was not\r\n  raised at trial, we express no opinion as to whether this type of evidence was\r\n  properly admitted. \r\n[3]Â  Even assuming that Anderson raised a hearsay\r\n  challenge, such an argument would be without merit.Â  In Rich, this Court\r\n  definitively held that police fingerprint cards do not violate the prohibition\r\n  against hearsay given they fall within the business records exception or the public\r\n  records exception.Â  Rich, 293 S.C. at 173, 359 S.E.2d at 281.Â  Notably,\r\n  appellate courts have continued to recognize this principle and have emphasized\r\n  that fingerprint cards are not &quot;testimonial&quot; and, thus, do not\r\n  violate the rule in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U.S. 36 (2004).Â  See United States v. Thornton, 209 Fed. Appx. 297, 299 (4th Cir. 2006) (relying on decisions of the Fifth, Sixth, and Ninth Circuits\r\n  and concluding that fingerprint cards are not &quot;testimonial,&quot; and that\r\n  the admission of such business or public records does not violate the rule in Crawford).\r\n[4]Â  In his brief, Anderson relies on this Court's\r\n  decision in State v. Cribb, 310 S.C. 518, 426 S.E.2d 306 (1992).Â  In Cribb,\r\n  this Court reversed a felony driving under the influence (DUI) conviction on\r\n  the ground the State failed to establish the chain of custody regarding the\r\n  blood sample at issue given no testimony was provided as to the identity of the\r\n  persons handling the blood sample.Â  Because the instant case does not involve\r\n  an issue regarding the chain of custody of a fungible item, we find Cribb is inapposite.\r\n[5]Â  Rule 803(8), SCRE. \r\n[6] Rule 803(6), SCRE; see S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  19-5-510 (1985) (providing for evidence which falls within the &quot;Uniform\r\n  Business Records as Evidence Act&quot;). \r\n[7]Â  The South Carolina Rules of Evidence became\r\n  effective on September 3, 1995.Â  Rule 1103(b), SCRE.\r\n[8]Â  We use the term &quot;initial&quot; admissibility\r\n  because this rule only relates to the authentication of evidence.Â  Even if\r\n  properly authenticated, the evidence must still be assessed for relevance as\r\n  well as probative versus prejudicial value.Â  Rule 403, SCRE (&quot;Although relevant, evidence may be excluded if its\r\n  probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice,\r\n  confusion of the issues, or misleading the jury, or by considerations of undue\r\n  delay, waste of time, or needless presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;).\r\n[9]Â  Section 23-3-120 of the South Carolina Code mandates\r\n  this procedure.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-120(B) (Supp. 2008) (&quot;A person subjected to a lawful custodial\r\n  arrest for a state offense must be fingerprinted at the time the person\r\n  is booked and processed into a jail or detention facility or other location\r\n  when the taking of fingerprints is required.Â  Fingerprints taken by a law\r\n  enforcement agency or detention facility pursuant to this section must be submitted to the State Law Enforcement Division's Central Record Repository\r\n  within three days, excluding weekends and holidays, for the purposes of\r\n  identifying record subjects and establishing criminal history record\r\n  information.&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\n[10]Â \r\n  A public record or report under this provision only requires that the document\r\n  be produced and maintained in a public office.Â  The fact that the general\r\n  public does not have access to the document, i.e., fingerprint cards,\r\n  does not negate this method of authentication.Â  See S.C.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tDesaÂ \r\n  Ballard, of West Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter, the\r\n  Commission on Lawyer Conduct (the Commission) investigated allegations\r\n  involving two methods used by Respondent to promote his services as a real\r\n  estate attorney.Â  A Hearing Panel of the Commission found no misconduct and\r\n  recommended dismissal of the first allegation involving his distribution of\r\n  discount coupons for attorney's fees to realtors and lenders.Â  In the second\r\n  allegation, which involved using forms of the words &quot;expert&quot; and\r\n  &quot;specialist&quot; in the attorney biographies on his website, the Hearing\r\n  Panel found Respondent had violated Rule 7.4(b) of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (RPC), Rule 407, SCACR by using these words when neither\r\n  he nor his colleagues were certified as specialists by the Supreme Court of\r\n  South Carolina.Â  For this violation, the Hearing Panel recommended that\r\n  Respondent receive a Letter of Caution with a finding of minor misconduct and\r\n  that he pay the costs of these proceedings.Â  We agree in full with the Hearing\r\n  Panel's findings and recommendations and hereby dismiss the first allegation\r\n  and issue a Letter of Caution to Respondent as to the second allegation.\r\nFACTS\r\nPrior\r\n  to attending law school, Respondent worked in the real estate field for nearly\r\n  thirty years.Â  Respondent obtained his license to practice law in South\r\n  Carolina in 2001.Â  Since that time, he has worked at his own law firm, which\r\n  has several offices and a total of five attorneys, including Respondent.Â \r\n  Respondent primarily performs real estate closings, which is also the firm's\r\n  predominant practice.Â  \r\nFormal\r\n  Charges.Â  The Office of Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel (ODC) filed formal charges against Respondent in 2009 alleging the\r\n  following misconduct:\r\n\r\n\ti.Â \r\n  Respondent engaged in, or attempted to engage in, direct, in-person\r\n  solicitation of prospective clients in violation of Rule 7.3(a) by delivering\r\n  coupons to realtors and lenders with the expectation that they would be passed\r\n  on to persons known to be in need of legal services.\r\n\tii.\r\n  Respondent published a website on the Internet promoting his legal services\r\n  using forms of the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;specialist&quot; in\r\n  violation of Rule 7.4(b).Â  \r\n\r\nHearing\r\n  Panel.Â  The Hearing Panel conducted a\r\n  hearing regarding the two allegations, where they considered the following\r\n  evidence.\r\n\r\nFirst\r\n  Allegation:Â  Distribution of Discount Coupons.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Respondent testified that he began distributing discount coupons\r\n  in 2005.Â  The coupons provided discounts of $100 off for his legal services for\r\n  those buying or refinancing property, or $50 off for those selling property.Â  The\r\n  regular charges for this work before the application of any discounts were also\r\n  specified on the coupons.Â  According to Respondent, he initially put the coupon\r\n  only on his website, but realtors and lenders who were printing them out to\r\n  give to clients started asking him for printed versions, so he printed them up\r\n  as a paper coupon.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  put the printed coupons into plastic display cases to give to realtors who\r\n  wanted them, with the hope that they would put them in their office lobbies,\r\n  and the majority of them did so.Â  Respondent also put the display cases and\r\n  coupons in various locations around the area so that people could pick them up,\r\n  and he included them in newspaper advertisements, as well as made them\r\n  available for download from his website.Â  Respondent also occasionally\r\n  incorporated the coupon into his brochures.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  also mailed coupons directly to realtors and lenders with a cover letter.Â  Respondent\r\n  stated the realtors and lenders who received the coupons were not on his\r\n  payroll and they were not under his supervision.Â  He did not keep records of\r\n  the number of coupons that he gave to each realtor and track their return, and\r\n  he did not attempt to manage or control to whom the coupons were distributed.Â \r\n  Respondent estimated that approximately one-half of one percent of the coupons\r\n  printed were redeemed.Â  \r\nODC\r\n  asserted there was nothing wrong per se with issuing coupons; rather, ODC took\r\n  exception to the method of delivery of the coupons and the intended\r\n  recipients.Â  ODC stated distributing a coupon through the internet or in a\r\n  newspaper or some other manner of general distribution &quot;is perfectly acceptable.&quot;Â \r\n  ODC maintained that &quot;Welcome Wagon&quot; or &quot;ValPak&quot;\r\n  distributions, which give out information from a variety of businesses, are\r\n  also acceptable because the intended recipients were not selected based on\r\n  &quot;the fact that they are known to be in need of legal services.&quot;Â  \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, ODC argued, &quot;[d]istribution of the coupon through realtors and\r\n  lenders [was] done with the intent of reaching people who are known to be in\r\n  need of legal services, people buying and selling homes.&quot;Â  ODC further\r\n  argued &quot;that the intent of [Respondent] in sending the coupons to realtors\r\n  and lenders was to have them personally deliver those coupons to the\r\n  clients.&quot;Â  ODC alleged this conduct violated Rule 7.3(a) of the RPC, which\r\n  generally prohibits an attorney from making a direct, in-person solicitation\r\n  for professional employment with a prospective client.Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  contended the coupons were simply advertising that was governed by the\r\n  requirements of Rule 7.2 of the RPC as he had no control over what happened to\r\n  the coupons once they were given to the realtors and lenders, and he did not\r\n  violate Rule 7.3(a) as alleged by ODC.\r\nSecond\r\n  Allegation: Use of Forms of &quot;Expert&quot; &amp; &quot;Specialist.&quot;\r\nODC's second\r\n  allegation was that Respondent had used forms of the words &quot;expert&quot;\r\n  and &quot;specialist&quot; to describe himself and two other attorneys in the\r\n  biographical portion of his law firm's website when neither he nor his\r\n  associates were certified as specialists by this Court.Â  ODC asserted this\r\n  conduct violated Rule 7.4(b), RPC, governing the Court's certification of\r\n  specialists.\r\nAt\r\n  the hearing, Respondent acknowledged that neither he nor the other two\r\n  attorneys were specialists in any field certified by this Court.Â  He further\r\n  acknowledged that there is currently no certification available for the particular\r\n  fields mentioned on his website. \r\nAfter\r\n  this allegation came up, Respondent immediately changed the disputed language\r\n  to refer to his &quot;experience&quot; rather than his &quot;expertise,&quot;\r\n  and he also changed the wording of his associate's biographies to refer to\r\n  their &quot;concentration&quot; or &quot;emphasis&quot; in certain fields of\r\n  law, rather than their &quot;specialization&quot; in certain fields.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nODC takes exception\r\n  to the Hearing Panel's recommendation of dismissal of the allegation concerning\r\n  Respondent's distribution of a discount coupon.Â  Respondent maintains he\r\n  committed no misconduct in this regard.Â  He does not challenge the finding of\r\n  minor misconduct and the issuance of a Letter of Caution for the allegation\r\n  concerning his website.Â  \r\n&quot;The\r\n  authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the discipline is\r\n  given rests entirely with this Court.&quot;&nbsp; In re Tullis, 375 S.C.\r\n  190, 191, 652 S.E.2d 395, 395&nbsp;(2007).&nbsp; The Court &quot;has the sole\r\n  authority . . . to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of\r\n  the record.&quot;&nbsp; In re Thompson, 343 S.C. 1, 10, 539 S.E.2d 396,\r\n  401 (2000).&nbsp; &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's recommendation\r\n  and may make its own findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;&nbsp; In\r\n    re Hazzard, 377 S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102, 106&nbsp;(2008).&nbsp; \r\nA\r\n  disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing evidence.&nbsp; In\r\n    re Greene, 371 S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006); see also Rule 8, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;Charges of misconduct or incapacity shall\r\n  be established by clear and convincing evidence, and the burden of proof of the\r\n  charges shall be on the disciplinary counsel.&quot;).\r\n(1)Â  Discount Coupon &amp;\r\n  Rule 7.3(a).\r\nODC contends Respondent's distribution of the discount\r\n  coupons to realtors and lenders violated Rule 7.3(a) of the RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR, which provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA\r\n  lawyer shall not by in-person, live telephone or real-time electronic contact\r\n  solicit professional employment from a prospective client when a significant\r\n  motive for the lawyer's doing so is the lawyer's pecuniary gain, unless the\r\n  person contacted:Â  (1) is a lawyer; or (2) has a family, close personal, or\r\n  prior professional relationship with the lawyer.Â  \r\n\r\nODC\r\n  asserts Respondent's purpose in sending the discount coupons to lenders and\r\n  realtors was to target customers who were in need of legal services by using\r\n  the third-parties to make direct contact with the clients, which he is\r\n  prohibited from doing under Rule 7.3(a).\r\nRespondent\r\n  testified that before using the coupons he spoke to several attorneys that he\r\n  knew, and they suggested that he review the Ethics Advisory Opinions, so he did\r\n  and found what he referred to as &quot;the Welcome Wagon opinions.&quot;Â  Specifically,\r\n  Respondent reviewed and relied upon Ethics Advisory Opinions 93-08 and 96-27,\r\n  and he testified that he thought what he was doing was the same as in those\r\n  cases.Â  \r\nIn Ethics Advisory\r\n  Opinion 93-08, issued in 1993, an attorney was approached by a corporation\r\n  about becoming one of the sponsors included in a &quot;Welcome Wagon&quot;\r\n  program.Â  Essentially, a hostess would make appointments with people who had\r\n  just moved to the area to greet them and make them aware of services from businesses\r\n  in the area by presenting gifts, brochures, etc.Â  The hostess was paid a\r\n  nominal fee of $2.00 per sponsor for each presentation.Â  The Ethics Advisory\r\n  Committee concluded an attorney may advertise through a Welcome Wagon program\r\n  without violating the RPC.Â  The Committee commented that this did constitute\r\n  advertising that would be subject to the restrictions of Rule 7.2, and\r\n  &quot;since some of the contacts involve solicitation, Rule 7.3 would apply in\r\n  those cases.&quot;Â  The Committee further commented that &quot;[a]ny written\r\n  materials would consequently have to satisfy the requirements of Rules 7.1, 7.2\r\n  and 7.3.&quot;\r\nEthics Advisory\r\n  Opinion 96-27, issued in 1996, additionally addressed whether an attorney could\r\n  include a discount coupon for his or her professional services as part of the\r\n  Welcome Wagon presentation.Â  The Committee concluded, &quot;A discount coupon\r\n  or an offer of a special discounted fee for a new client, while perhaps\r\n  undignified, may not be a substantive violation of the rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, so long as it is not false or misleading,&quot; citing Rule 7.1.Â \r\n  However, attorneys should not follow up with persons who did not respond to the\r\n  attorney's advertising material because that has the potential to violate Rule\r\n  7.3(b).\r\nIn\r\n  2007, sometime after Respondent had already been distributing his coupons,\r\n  Ethics Advisory Opinion 07-09 came out, which addressed an attorney's proposal\r\n  to issue discount coupons to prospective clients by providing them to mortgage\r\n  loan originators and real estate agents.[1]Â \r\n  In that scenario, the mortgage loan originators and the real estate agents were\r\n  going to personally give the coupons to homebuyers at the time the homebuyers\r\n  were asked to choose a lawyer to close the real estate transactions.Â  The\r\n  Committee stated, &quot;The difference in this case is that the lawyer here\r\n  knows that each prospective client will be in need of legal services in a\r\n  particular matter, whereas the lawyer in [Ethics Advisory Opinion] 96-27 was\r\n  giving a coupon to all new homeowners in case any of them might need legal\r\n  services in the future.&quot;Â  \r\nThe\r\n  Committee stated disclaimer language would have to be included, which could be\r\n  impractical for coupons:Â  &quot;Rule 7.3(d) also requires extensive specific\r\n  language to be contained in '[e]very writing directed to someone known to be in\r\n  need of legal services on a particular matter.'Â  Unless the coupon contains all\r\n  the language required by subparts 1 through 3 of Rule 7.3(d), which does not\r\n  seem practicable on a coupon, the coupons will violate this rule.&quot; Â (Alteration\r\n  in original.)Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  testified Opinion 07-09 did not come out until after the Commission's\r\n  investigation of him began in 2006, and he thought this decision &quot;seemed\r\n  to be so inconsistent with the [Welcome Wagon] cases.&quot;Â  We agree and find that\r\n  Opinion 07-09 does not present a correct interpretation of Rule 7.3(a).\r\nThe\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States has concluded that a state may not\r\n  categorically prohibit attorneys from soliciting clients for pecuniary gain by\r\n  sending truthful and non-misleading communications to those known to be in need\r\n  of legal services:Â  \r\n\r\n\t[M]erely\r\n  because targeted, direct-mail solicitation presents lawyers with opportunities\r\n  for isolated abuses or mistakes does not justify a total ban on that mode of\r\n  protected commercial speech.

Â The State can regulate such abuses and\r\n  minimize mistakes through far less restrictive and more precise means, the most\r\n  obvious of which is to require the lawyer to file any solicitation letter with\r\n  a state agency, id., at 206, 102 S.Ct., at 939, giving the State ample\r\n  opportunity to supervise mailings and penalize actual abuses.\r\n\r\nShapero v. Kentucky Bar\r\n  Ass'n, 486 U.S. 466, 476 (1988).\r\nIn\r\n  the current case, ODC made no allegation that Respondent's coupons were\r\n  misleading or otherwise improper. Â Respondent indicated both the amount of the\r\n  discount and the amount of the regular charges on his coupons, and he testified\r\n  that he did, in fact, give the appropriate discounted rates to those who\r\n  presented the coupons.Â  Although Respondent attempted to send his coupons to a\r\n  targeted audience of persons interested in real estate, not all of the persons\r\n  who received his coupons were in need of legal services.Â  However, whether or\r\n  not the intended recipients were in need of legal services is irrelevant.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  agree with the Hearing Panel's findings that &quot;[t]he coupons . . . were\r\n  distributed randomly by real estate agents and lenders, similar in fashion to\r\n  the common practice of leaving business cards for distribution.&quot;Â \r\n  Furthermore, &quot;[b]ecause the lawyer is not physically present . . . , there\r\n  is no insistence upon immediate retention or 'importuning of the trained\r\n  advocate.'&quot;Â  As Respondent testified, the realtors and lenders were not\r\n  under his control and could have thrown away the coupons or let people take\r\n  them like other business cards that were available for the public.Â  Thus, there\r\n  was no insistence upon immediate action thrust upon the recipients and we agree\r\n  with the Hearing Panel that Respondent committed no misconduct in this regard\r\n  and dismissal of the charge is proper.\r\n(2)Â  Use of Forms of &quot;Expert&quot; &amp; &quot;Specialist&quot;\r\n  &amp; Rule 7.4(b). \r\nRule 7.4(b) limits\r\n  an attorney's use of any form of the words &quot;expert&quot; and\r\n  &quot;specialist&quot; to avoid confusion with this Court's program for\r\n  certifying specialists.Â  The rule provides as follows:\r\n\r\n\tA lawyer who is not certified as a specialist but who\r\n  concentrates in, limits his or her practice to, or wishes to announce a\r\n  willingness to accept cases in a particular field may so advertise or publicly\r\n  state in any manner otherwise permitted by these rules.Â  To avoid confusing or\r\n  misleading the public and to protect the objectives of the South Carolina\r\n  certified specialization program, any such advertisement or statements shall be\r\n  strictly factual and shall not contain any form of the words\r\n  &quot;certified,&quot; &quot;specialist,&quot; &quot;expert,&quot; or\r\n  &quot;authority&quot; except as permitted by Rule 7.4(d) [regarding admiralty\r\n  practice].\r\n\r\nRule 7.4(b), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR (emphasis added).\r\nAt\r\n  the panel hearing, Respondent's counsel argued that Respondent's use of forms\r\n  of the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;specialist&quot; were meant to refer\r\n  to Respondent's extensive experience in the real estate field before becoming\r\n  an attorney, and to refer to the previous experience of two of his associates.Â \r\n  Counsel argued Respondent did not mean to imply they were certified specialists\r\n  and that the way the &quot;words were used on the website was not written in\r\n  such a way as it could possibly have been misconstrued or confused with the\r\n  Bar's certified specialist program[.]&quot; \r\nRespondent's\r\n  use of the words, as outlined in the report of the Hearing Panel, clearly\r\n  violated Rule 7.4(b), which expressly prohibits use of &quot;any form&quot; of\r\n  the words &quot;expert&quot; and &quot;specialist.&quot;Â  However, in\r\n  mitigation, we note that Respondent immediately removed the disputed words from\r\n  his website when they were challenged, and there is no evidence that anyone was\r\n  actually misled or harmed by Respondent's use of the words on his website.Â  Neither\r\n  Respondent nor ODC has raised any challenges to the Hearing Panel's findings\r\n  and conclusion with regard to this particular allegation.Â  We agree with the\r\n  Hearing Panel that Respondent violated Rule 7.4(b) and committed minor\r\n  misconduct by using these terms improperly and hereby issue this Letter of\r\n  Caution to Respondent to observe the provisions of Rule 7.4(b).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nIt\r\n  is clear from the transcript of the hearing in this matter that Respondent researched\r\n  the Ethics Advisory Opinions, that he was very cooperative with ODC, and that\r\n  he made immediate efforts to make changes in his conduct when this disciplinary\r\n  action arose.Â  We agree with the Hearing Panel that dismissal of the allegation\r\n  regarding distribution of the discount coupons is appropriate, and we issue\r\n  this Letter of Caution, with a finding of minor misconduct, for Respondent's\r\n  violation of Rule 7.4(b) for his inappropriate use of forms of the words &quot;expert&quot;\r\n  and &quot;specialist&quot; on his website.\r\nDISMISSAL\r\n  AND LETTER OF CAUTION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Respondent stated he was not the person who\r\n  requested this opinion.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26753","title":"LaSalle Bank v.

Cox, of Cox Law Firm, of Goose Creek, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tD.\r\n  Randolph Whitt, of Fleming &amp; Whitt, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:Â Â Â Â Â  This is an appeal from a judgment in a mortgage foreclosure\r\n  proceeding.Â  The question before the Court is whether the failure of the judge\r\n  to attend the final court hearing violated Appellants'\r\n  constitutional guarantee to\r\n  procedural due process.Â  We answer in the affirmative and hold that an attempt to conduct a hearing without a judge\r\n    violates due process and is a nullity.Â  We vacate the judgment of the trial\r\n    court and remand for a hearing.Â  \r\nI.\r\nIn\r\n  September 2004, in two transactions, DHI Mortgage Company (&quot;DHI&quot;)\r\n  loaned Appellants Edward and Sheryl Davidson $42,386 and $169,542 to purchase a\r\n  home in Summerville, South Carolina.Â  Both loans were secured by recorded\r\n  mortgages.Â  The Davidsons defaulted on their May 2006 mortgage paymentâ€”one\r\n  month after the interest rate increased from 6.625 percent to 11.375 percent.Â \r\n  Upon default, the outstanding balance on the larger loan was $166,694.35. \r\nOn\r\n  December 19, 2006, DHI assigned the smaller mortgage to WCRSI, LLC.Â  On October\r\n  12, 2007, DHI assigned the larger mortgage to Respondent LaSalle Bank National\r\n  Association (&quot;LaSalle&quot;).[1]Â \r\n  LaSalle initiated a mortgage foreclosure action shortly after the assignment\r\n  and notified the Davidsons they then owed $198,766.75.Â  In its complaint,\r\n  LaSalle asked the court to: &quot;Declare [its] [m]ortgage a purchase money\r\n  first mortgage lien on the subject property, and render judgment and\r\n  foreclosure for the amount so found to be due and owing thereon, together with\r\n  any taxes or insurance premiums which may be due, with reasonable attorney's\r\n  fees, and for the costs of this action.&quot;Â  The complaint additionally\r\n  alleged that all other liens on the Davidsons' property were &quot;junior or\r\n  subsequent to&quot; LaSalle's mortgage.Â  After the Davidsons and the other lien\r\n  holders failed to respond to the complaint, LaSalle filed an affidavit of\r\n  default.Â  The Dorchester County Clerk of Court referred the case to the Master-in-Equity\r\n  and notified the parties that a final hearing would be held on March 6, 2008.Â \r\n  The Order of Reference stated the Master would take testimony, enter a final\r\n  judgment, and &quot;hear all matters arising from or reasonably related\r\n  to&quot; the case.Â  \r\nOn\r\n  March 6, 2008, LaSalle's attorney[2] appeared in court for the hearing.Â  Sheryl Davidson appeared pro se for\r\n  the hearing.Â  The Master, however, failed to attend and no court reporter was\r\n  present.Â  In the Master's absence, LaSalle's counsel attempted to proceed with\r\n  a hearing against the pro se defendant.Â  LaSalle's counsel then\r\n  presented a proposed order, which the Master signed and filed on March 18,\r\n  2008.Â  In the final order, &quot;Judgment of Foreclosure and Sale,&quot; the\r\n  Master referenced the March 6 hearing and made findings based on the phantom\r\n  testimony and evidence presented.Â  The order found the Davidsons' secured debt\r\n  was $212,034.16, which included attorneys' fees of $4,500.Â  \r\nAlso\r\n  on March 18, 2008, a Record of Hearing[3] was filed with the court.Â  This Record stated a hearing in the Davidsons' case\r\n  was held before the Master on March 6, 2008.Â  The Record indicated that the\r\n  only party attending the hearing was LaSalle's attorney; however, as noted,\r\n  Sheryl Davidson also was present.Â  Moreover, the Record states that LaSalle's\r\n  attorney was duly sworn, testimony was given, and documents were placed into\r\n  evidence.Â  \r\nThe Davidsons filed a notice of appeal from the March\r\n  18, 2008 order.Â  On appeal, the Davidsons argue the Master's order, which\r\n  followed a final hearing conducted without a presiding judge, violated their\r\n  constitutional guarantees to procedural due process, substantive due process,\r\n  and equal protection.Â  After jurisdiction over the case had vested in the\r\n  appellate court, the Master attempted to vacate the order by filing an order on\r\n  May 15, 2008.Â  The May 15 order, entitled &quot;Sua Sponte Order Vacating\r\n  Judgment,&quot; stated: &quot;[D]ue to unavoidable circumstances, I was not\r\n  present at the hearing.&quot;Â  The Supreme Court certified the case pursuant to\r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rule 204(b).\r\nII.\r\nFor purposes of the narrow issue presented, &quot;[d]ue\r\n  process of law requires that a person shall have a reasonable opportunity to be\r\n  heard before a legally appointed\r\n  and qualified impartial tribunal before any binding decree, order, or judgment\r\n  can be made affecting his rights to life, liberty, or property.&quot;Â  State\r\n    v. Brown, 178 S.C. 294, 300, 182 S.E. 838, 841 (1935).Â  The Davidsons\r\n  contend their rights to procedural due process were violated when the Master\r\n  issued an order of mortgage foreclosure and sale following a judicial\r\n  proceeding he failed to attend.Â  We agree.\r\nWhile\r\n  LaSalle acknowledges the judge's absence from the hearing &quot;may well have\r\n  been an error,&quot; it contends we should view the absence of the judge from\r\n  the hearing as simply the failure to conform to an &quot;empty ritual.&quot;Â \r\n  We do not view the presence of the judge in the courtroom as an &quot;empty ritual.&quot;Â \r\n  We similarly do not adopt LaSalle's assertion that the error here is not\r\n  reversible because the outcome to the Davidsons would have been the same with,\r\n  or without, a judge in the courtroom.Â  LaSalle contends: \r\n\r\n\tAppellants'\r\n  default as to the allegations of the foreclosure [c]omplaint sealed their fate\r\n  as to the outcome of a judgment of foreclosure being issued.Â  Appellants have\r\n  failed to show how any changes in the quality or extent of the hearing in this\r\n  matter would have produced a different result.Â  \r\n\r\nWe\r\n  categorically reject LaSalle's contention that the absence of the judge at the\r\n  hearing was a harmless error.Â  The law recognizes two kinds of errors: trial\r\n  errors and structural defects.Â  The former are subject to &quot;harmless\r\n  error&quot; analysis while the latter are not.Â  In State v. Mouzon, this\r\n  Court quoted a leading United States Supreme Court case, Arizona v.\r\n    Fulminante, 499 U.S. 279 (1991), in explaining that &quot;trial errors []\r\n  are subject to harmless error analysis&quot;; however, &quot;structural defects\r\n  in the constitution of the trial mechanism [] defy analysis by harmless error\r\n  standards.&quot; Â 326 S.C. 199, 204, 485 S.E.2d 918, 921 (1997).Â  \r\n\r\n\t[Trial errors] occur during\r\n  the presentation of the case to the jury, and may therefore be quantitatively\r\n  assessed in the context of other evidence presented in order to determine\r\n  whether its admission was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Â Structural\r\n  defects affect the entire conduct of the trial from beginning to end. Â \r\n\r\nId. at 204, 485 S.E.2d at 921 (quoting Fulminante,\r\n  499 U.S. at 308-09) (internal citations and quotation marks omitted).Â  See\r\n    also Sullivan v. Louisiana, 508 U.S. 275, 282 (1993) (explaining deprivation\r\n  of the criminal defendant's right to a jury trial, &quot;with consequences that\r\n  are necessarily unquantifiable and indeterminate, unquestionably qualifies as 'structural error'&quot;).Â  \r\nWe\r\n  hold that the absence of a judge at a court hearing is a structural defect.Â \r\n  The Court is troubled by LaSalle's trial counsel's efforts to proceed without a\r\n  presiding judicial officer as well as the submission of the erroneous proposed\r\n  order to the judge.Â  The purported hearing was a nullity, and the resulting\r\n  order must be vacated.Â  The judge's absence from the hearing deprived the\r\n  Davidsons of the opportunity to be heard and, thus violated their\r\n  constitutional guarantee of procedural due process.\r\nThe\r\n  final matter we address is the Davidsons' request that we remand the case to a\r\n  different judge.Â  We decline this request.Â  While the execution of LaSalle's\r\n  counselâ€™s proposed order was unfortunate, we discern nothing in the record\r\n  warranting mandatory disqualification of this Master.Â  Moreover, had the\r\n  Davidsons filed a motion asking the Master to reconsider his order, we believe\r\n  the Master would have vacated the order and conducted a proper hearing, as he\r\n  attempted to do after jurisdiction had transferred to the appellate court.Â \r\n  While it may be difficult to understand how an order was issued from a hearing\r\n  that never happened, we put the matter into context by recognizing the enormous\r\n  caseloads handled by our state's excellent Masters, especially with respect to\r\n  mortgage foreclosures.Â  \r\nIII.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we vacate the March 18, 2008 Order of Foreclosure and Sale and remand for a de novo hearing on the merits.Â  We need not reach the remaining\r\n  assignments of error raised by Appellants.\r\nVACATED\r\n  AND REMANDED. \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; LaSalle is trustee for certificate holders of Bear Sterns\r\n  asset-backed-securities.Â  \r\n[2]&nbsp; The attorney representing LaSalle on appeal did not represent LaSalle at\r\n  the foreclosure hearing.\r\n[3]&nbsp; The Record on Appeal does not indicate who prepared or filed the Record\r\n  of Hearing.

Hoover Universal\r\n    Inc., 379 S.C. 181, 666 S.E.2d 247\r\n  (2008) to the extent it expands the narrow exception to the economic loss rule\r\n  articulated in Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335,\r\n  384 S.E.2d 730 (1989).\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL\r\n  BACKGROUND\r\nI.&nbsp; Sapp Appeal\r\nIn 2004, Appellant\r\n  Jeffrey M. Sapp purchased a 2000 Ford F-150 truck from Atlantic Coast\r\n  Construction for $5,000.Â  The truck had 190,000 miles on it at the time of sale\r\n  and Sapp bought it &quot;as is.&quot;Â  On May 16, 2005, while Sapp was driving\r\n  the truck, the cruise control stopped working, and the truck caught fire\r\n  shortly after Sapp parked.Â  \r\nThe fire did not\r\n  injure Sapp or damage any property other than the vehicle itself.Â  He filed a\r\n  claim with his insurance company, and approximately three months later, the\r\n  truck was repaired and returned to him.Â  The repair costs were approximately\r\n  $7,000.Â  \r\nSapp filed suit\r\n  against Ford alleging causes of action for negligence, strict liability, breach\r\n  of warranty, and fraud/misrepresentation.Â  Sapp alleged Ford knew of a design\r\n  defect in the cruise control switch, which would short circuit and cause a fire\r\n  in the engine compartment.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment as to all\r\n  causes of action and specifically found that the economic loss rule precluded\r\n  the tort claims.\r\nII.&nbsp; Smith Appeal\r\nOn January 31,\r\n  2006, Appellant Bryan D. Smith's 2000 Ford F-150 truck caught fire and was\r\n  completely destroyed.Â  Smith filed suit against Ford alleging causes of action\r\n  for negligence, strict liability, breach of warranty, and negligent\r\n  misrepresentation.Â  Smith alleged Ford knew of the same design defect alleged\r\n  in Sapp's complaint.Â  The master-in-equity dismissed Smith's tort claims\r\n  pursuant to the economic loss rule.Â Â  \r\n\r\nStandard of Review\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate where there is no genuine issue of material fact and\r\n  it is clear that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of\r\n  law.Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP.Â  In determining whether any triable issues of fact\r\n  exist, the evidence and all inferences that can be reasonably drawn from the\r\n  evidence must be viewed in the light most favorable to the nonmoving party.Â  Koester\r\n    v. Carolina Rental Ctr., 313 S.C. 490, 493, 443 S.E.2d 392, 394 (1994).Â  \r\nAny party may move\r\n  for a judgment on the pleadings under Rule 12(c), SCRCP.Â  A judgment on the\r\n  pleadings is proper where there is no issue of fact raised by the complaint\r\n  that would entitle plaintiff to judgment if resolved in plaintiff's favor.Â  Russell\r\n    v. City of Columbia, 302 S.C. 86, 89, 406 S.E.2d 338, 339 (1991).Â  \r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nAppellants\r\n  argue the trial courts erred in granting summary judgment based on the economic\r\n  loss rule.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe\r\n  economic loss rule is a creation of the modern law of products liability.Â \r\n  Under the rule, there is no tort liability for a product defect if the damage\r\n  suffered by the plaintiff is only to the product itself. Â Kennedy v.\r\n    Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299 S.C. 335, 341, 384 S.E.2d 730, 734\r\n  (1989).Â  In other words, tort liability only lies where there is damage done to\r\n  other property or personal injury.Â  Id. Â \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the economic loss rule is to define the line between recovery in\r\n  tort and recovery in contract.Â  Contract law seeks to protect the expectancy\r\n  interests of the parties.Â  Tort law, on the other hand, seeks to protect safety\r\n  interests and is rooted in the concept of protecting society as a whole from\r\n  physical harm to person or property.Â  In the context of products liability law,\r\n  when a defective product only damages itself, the only concrete and measurable\r\n  damages are the diminution in the value of the product, cost of repair, and\r\n  consequential damages resulting from the product's failure.Â  Stated\r\n  differently, the consumer has only suffered an economic loss.Â  The consumer has\r\n  purchased an inferior product, his expectations have not been met, and he has\r\n  lost the benefit of the bargain.Â  In this instance, however, the risk of\r\n  product failure has already been allocated pursuant to the terms of the\r\n  agreement between the parties. On the other hand, the parties have not\r\n  bargained for the situation in which a defective product creates an\r\n  unreasonable risk of harm and causes personal injury or property damage.Â \r\n  Accordingly, where a product damages only itself, tort law provides no remedy\r\n  and the action lies in contract; but when personal injury or other property\r\n  damage occurs, a tort remedy may be appropriate. \r\nIn Kennedy,\r\n  we held the economic loss rule does not preclude a homebuyer from recovering in\r\n  tort against the developer or builder where the builder violates an applicable\r\n  building code, deviates from industry standards, or constructs a house that he\r\n  knows or should know will pose a serious risk of physical harm.Â  Such an\r\n  exception was and still remains necessary to protect homeowners.Â  As explained\r\n  in Kennedy, the mechanics of home purchasing have evolved and\r\n  drastically changed over the past two hundred years and, accordingly, courts\r\n  have shifted from following the doctrine of caveat emptor (&quot;let the\r\n  buyer beware&quot;) to the doctrine of caveat venditor (&quot;let the\r\n  seller beware&quot;).[1]Â \r\n  A home is typically an individual's single largest investment and is a\r\n  completely different type of manufactured good than any other type of product\r\n  that a consumer will buy.Â  Moreover, courts have recognized that the\r\n  transaction between a builder and a buyer for the sale of a home largely\r\n  involves inherently unequal bargaining power between the parties.Â Â Â  For these\r\n  reasons, we created this narrow exception to the economic loss rule to apply solely\r\n  in the residential home context.\r\nThe\r\n  rule announced in Kennedy followed a long line of South Carolina cases\r\n  directed toward protecting consumers only in the residential home building\r\n  context,[2] and we noted that this holding followed cases from\r\n  around the country expanding protections afforded to homebuyers and imposing\r\n  tort liability on residential homebuilders.[3]Â  \r\nIn Colleton\r\n  Preparatory Academy, Inc. v. Hoover Universal Inc., 379 S.C. 181, 666\r\n  S.E.2d 247 (2008), this Court was faced with the issue of whether to expand the Kennedy exception to the economic loss rule beyond the residential home\r\n  building context to all manufacturers.Â  The majority held that the economic\r\n  loss rule will not preclude a plaintiff from filing a products liability suit\r\n  in tort where only the product itself is injured when the plaintiff alleges\r\n  breach of duty accompanied by a clear, serious, and unreasonable risk of bodily\r\n  injury or death.Â  The dissent argued that this decision not only broadly\r\n  expanded the exception to the economic loss rule, but also completely altered\r\n  the law on products liability in South Carolina.Â  In our view, the traditional\r\n  economic loss rule provides a more stable framework and results in a more just\r\n  and predictable outcome in products liability cases.Â  Accordingly, we overrule Colleton\r\n    Prep to the extent it expands the narrow exception to the economic loss\r\n  rule beyond the residential builder context.Â  \r\nFurthermore, like\r\n  the dissent in Colleton Prep, we, too, are cautious in permitting\r\n  negligence actions where there is neither personal injury nor property damage.Â \r\n  Imposing liability merely for the creation of risk when there are no actual\r\n  damages drastically changes the fundamental elements of a tort action, makes\r\n  any amount of damages entirely speculative, and holds the manufacturer as an\r\n  insurer against all possible risk of harm.Â  Carolina Winds Owners' Ass'n,\r\n    Inc. v. Joe Harden Builder, Inc., 297 S.C. 74, 87, 374 S.E.2d 897, 905 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1988).\r\nThe Kennedy opinion did not signal a watershed moment in products liability law\r\n  in South Carolina, nor did it alter the application of the economic loss rule\r\n  in products liability cases.Â  The Kennedy court specifically noted that &quot;[t]he 'economic loss rule' will still apply where duties are\r\n  created solely by contract. In that situation, no cause of action in\r\n  negligence will lie.&quot;Â  Kennedy, 299 S.C. at\r\n  347, 384 S.E.2d at 737. Several opinions from the federal courts that were\r\n  issued prior to Kennedy found South Carolina's economic loss rule\r\n  precluded a negligence action against a manufacturer,[4] and subsequent cases found that, in light of and notwithstanding Kennedy,\r\n  the economic loss rule prohibited negligence actions against a manufacturer\r\n  where duties were created solely by contract and where the product only injured\r\n  itself or where the damage was contemplated by the parties' contract.[5]Â \r\n  We conclude the federal courts were correct in this regard.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  the time of our decision in Kennedy, we had no intention of the\r\n  exception extending beyond residential real estate construction and into\r\n  commercial real estate construction.Â  Such a progression was in error and we\r\n  now correct that expansion.Â  Much less did we intend the exception to the economic\r\n  loss rule to be applied well beyond the scope of real estate construction in an\r\n  ordinary products liability claim.Â  We emphasize the exception announced in Kennedy is a very narrow one, applicable only in the residential real estate\r\n  construction context.\r\nTurning to the\r\n  merits of the instant appeals, we hold the trial courts properly granted\r\n  judgment in favor of Ford on Appellants' tort claims.Â  The only damage caused\r\n  by the defect in the trucks was damage to the trucks themselves - purely an\r\n  economic loss to Appellants.Â  Therefore, the economic loss rule precludes\r\n  Appellants' recovery in tort.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the above\r\n  reasons, we affirm the ruling of the trial courts.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

BEATTY, J.,\r\n  concurring in result only in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY (concurring in result): Â Â Â Â  I\r\n  concur but write separately.Â  This Court heralded a change in its view of the\r\n  economic loss rule in Kennedy v. Columbia Lumber &amp; Mfg. Co., 299\r\n  S.C. 335, 384 S.E.2d 730 (1989).Â  The Court gave no indication that its new\r\n  analytical framework was limited to residential housing construction.Â  In\r\n  proclaiming its new framework, the Court set about a review of the Court of\r\n  Appeals' economic loss analysis in Carolina Winds Owners' Ass'n v. Joe\r\n    Harden Builder, Inc., 297 S.C. 74, 374 S.E.2d 897 (Ct. App. 1988).Â  In\r\n  rejecting the opinion of the Court of Appeals, this Court concluded that the\r\n  traditional analysis of the economic loss rule was problematical.Â  The Court,\r\n  referring to the analysis of the Court of Appeals, stated:\r\n\r\n\tWhere a\r\n  purchaser's expectations in a sale are frustrated because the product he bought\r\n  is not working properly, his remedy is said to be in contract alone, for he has\r\n  suffered only &quot;economic&quot; losses.Â  Conversely, where a purchaser buys\r\n  a product which is defective and physically harms him, his remedy is in either\r\n  tort or contract.Â  This is so, the analysis provides, because his losses are\r\n  more than merely &quot;economic.&quot;\r\n\tWe find that this legal framework generates\r\n  difficulties.Â  This is so because the framework's focus is on consequence, not\r\n  action.Â  Builder &quot;A&quot; and\r\n  Builder &quot;B&quot; can be equally blameworthy, and build equally shoddy\r\n  housing, but because Builder &quot;A&quot;'s negligence happened to be discovered\r\n  early enough, no one was harmed.Â  It hardly seems fair that Builder\r\n  &quot;A&quot; should profit from a diligent buyer's discovery, or because he\r\n  was fortunate.Â  \r\n\tThe framework we adopt focuses on activity, not\r\n  consequence.Â  If a builder performs\r\n  construction in such a way that he violates a contractual duty only,\r\n  then his liability is only contractual.Â  If he acts in a way as to violate a\r\n  legal duty, however, his liability is both in contract and in tort.\r\n\t. . .\r\n\tÂ A builder is no less blameworthy in such a case where\r\n  lady luck has smiled upon him and no physical harm has yet occurred.Â  We\r\n    discounted the necessity of showing physical harm in Terlinde, 275\r\n  S.C. 395, 271 S.E.2d 768 (1980), in which we considered and declined to adopt\r\n  arguments asserting the &quot;economic loss&quot; rule contained in the Terlinde briefs.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\r\nKennedy, 299 S.C. at 345-46, 384 S.E.2d at 736-37 (emphasis\r\n  added).\r\nToday, this Court\r\n  would overrule Colleton Preparatory Acad., Inc. v. Hoover Universal, Inc.,\r\n  379 S.C. 181, 666 S.E.2d 247 (2008).[i]Â  Colleton adheres to the Kennedy analysis framework.Â  If it is\r\n  wrongly decided, then Kennedy should be overruled as well and this Court\r\n  should simply say that the economic loss rule is not applicable to residential\r\n  home building.Â  Of course, this would not explain the negative treatment of the\r\n  rule in other areas such as professional services.Â  See Tommy L.\r\n    Griffin Plumbing &amp; Heating v. Jordan, Jones &amp; Goulding, Inc., 320\r\n  S.C. 49, 55, 463 S.E.2d 85, 88-89 (1995) (finding design professionals,\r\n  including engineers, may have a duty separate and distinct from contractual\r\n  duties such that the economic loss doctrine would not prohibit a tort action); Beachwalk\r\n    Villas Condo.

Walters, 276\r\n  S.C. 223, 226, 277 S.E.2d 888, 889 (1981) (finding an attorney liable for\r\n  economic loss to a corporate shareholder when attorney breached a duty to the\r\n  corporation); but see McCullough v. Goodrich &amp; Pennington\r\n    Mortgage Fund, Inc., 373 S.C. 43, 53, 644 S.E.2d 43, 49 (2007) (rejecting\r\n  the notion of a special duty in the secured transactions arena).Â  \r\nThe\r\n  inconsistent treatment of the doctrine, by use of varying analytical\r\n  frameworks, does not provide the bench and bar guidance in the proper\r\n  application of the doctrine.Â  The Court should simply pronounce a list of areas\r\n  to which public policy prohibits the application of the economic loss doctrine and\r\n  forego any legal analysis.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] A more complete history of the evolution of the law in this area, along with\r\n  several additional useful sources, can be found at Kennedy, 299 S.C. at\r\n  342-44, 384 S.E.2d at 735-36.\r\n[2] See Roundtree Villas Ass'n, Inc. v. 4701 Kings\r\n  Corp., 282 S.C. 415, 321 S.E.2d 46 (1984)\r\n  (holding that where the lender undertook to repair defects in the housing units\r\n  in order to facilitate further sales, the lender could be held liable in tort\r\n  for negligent repairs); Terlinde v.

Casey Manning, Circuit Court Judge\r\nOpinion No.Â  26755\r\nSubmitted November 18, 2009 - Filed\r\n  December 21, 2009Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tAppellate\r\n  Defender Kathrine H. Hudgins, of South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense,\r\n  of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tAttorney\r\n  General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John W. McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Assistant Attorney General Brian T.\r\n  Petrano, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: We granted a writ of certiorari to perform an Austin v.\r\n  StateÂ  review of the denial of Petitioner Gina Dervinâ€™s application for post\r\n  conviction relief (PCR).Â  We reverse and remand for resentencing.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nDervin was indicted for trafficking cocaine.Â Â  The indictment\r\n  alleged she had trafficked between 200-400 grams of cocaine.Â  During her trial,\r\n  the court twice instructed the jury that Dervin could be convicted of\r\n  trafficking if she was in actual or constructive possession of ten grams or\r\n  more of cocaine.Â  The jury found her guilty.Â  \r\nAt\r\n  sentencing, Dervin requested the judge sentence her to the minimum possible\r\n  sentence, to which the court responded:\r\n\r\n\tTrafficking in cocaine -- and in this case trafficking in cocaine\r\n  in a substantial amount -- the amount in this case is from 200 grams - more\r\n  than 200 grams but less than 400 grams.Â Â  And that I will tell you is the\r\n  second highest category or volume of traffic of cocaine provided for in the\r\n  trafficking statute. . . . \r\n\tOur Legislature has mandated a sentence in a trafficking case, and\r\n  that is a mandatory 25-year sentence and a mandatory $100,000 fine.Â  So I have\r\n  no choice other than to impose the sentence required by law.\r\n\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  Dervin was sentenced to twenty-five years and a $100,000 fine for trafficking.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals affirmed her convictions and sentences on direct appeal.Â  State\r\n    v. Dervin, Op. No. 2003-UP-484 (S.C. Ct. App. filed August 20, 2003).\r\nDervinâ€™s\r\n  first PCR application was denied, and no appeal was filed.Â  Dervin filed this\r\n  subsequent PCR application in May 2007, alleging PCR counsel was ineffective in\r\n  failing to appeal the denial of the first PCR application.Â  Â The court held Dervin\r\n  was entitled to a belated review of the denial of her first application\r\n  pursuant to Austin v. State, 305 S.C. 453, 409 S.E.2d 395 (1991), and we\r\n  granted certiorari.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWas trial counsel\r\n  ineffective in failing to object to Dervinâ€™s twenty-five year sentence for\r\n  trafficking more than 200 grams of cocaine when the trial judge only charged\r\n  the jury to consider whether petitioner was guilty of trafficking ten or more\r\n  grams of cocaine?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nDervin\r\n  contends trial counsel was ineffective in failing to object to imposition of a\r\n  twenty-five year sentence for trafficking between 200-400 grams of cocaine,\r\n  because the jury was only required to determine she trafficked ten or more\r\n  grams of cocaine, but that it did not necessarily determine she possessed over\r\n  200 grams.Â  Dervin contends the United States Supreme Courtâ€™s decisions in Apprendi\r\n    v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466 (2000) and Blakely v. Washington, 542\r\n  U.S. 296 (2004) require the amount of drugs to be submitted to the jury to be\r\n  proven beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  We agree.Â Â Â  \r\nIn Apprendi\r\n  v. New Jersey, 530 U.S. 466, 490, 120 S.Ct. 2348, 2362-63, 147 L.Ed.2d 435\r\n  (2000), the United State Supreme Court held that \"[o]ther than the fact of a\r\n  prior conviction, any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the\r\n  prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury, and proved beyond a\r\n  reasonable doubt.\"Â  See also Blakely v. Washington, 542\r\n  U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004) (court explained that\r\n  \"statutory maximum\" for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may\r\n  impose solely on the basis of the facts reflected in the jury verdict or\r\n  admitted by the defendant). \r\nThe state asserts there is no Apprendi violation because the\r\n  twenty-five year sentence imposed here is within the statutory maximum.Â  While\r\n  the state is correct in asserting thatÂ  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) permits up to a thirty year sentence and a $200,000 fine for trafficking over\r\n  400 grams of cocaine, the only amount actually charged to the jury here was\r\n  that it could convict Dervin if it found she possessed \"more than 10 grams.\"Â  There\r\n  is no indication in the juryâ€™s verdict that it found anything more than this\r\n  amount.Â  Accordingly, given the trial courtâ€™s instruction, the applicable\r\n  sentence for possession of ten grams falls under Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2)(a)(1) and is a maximum of ten years and a $25,000 fine.Â  Accord United States\r\n    v. Booker, 543 U.S. 220 (2005) (statutory maximum for Apprendi purposes is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of the\r\n  facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant).Â  \r\nDue\r\n  process requires the State to prove every element of a criminal offense beyond\r\n  a reasonable doubt.Â  State v. Brown, 360 S.C. 581, 602 S.E.2d 392 (2004)\r\n  (citing In re Winship, 397 U.S. 358 (1970)).Â  A defendant,\r\n  therefore, cannot \"be exposed to a greater punishment than that authorized by\r\n  the juryâ€™s guilty verdict.\"Â  United States v. Page, 232 F.3d 536, 543\r\n  (6th Cir. 2000).Â  \r\nIn Blakely\r\n  v. Washington, 542 U.S. 296, 124 S.Ct. 2531, 159 L.Ed.2d 403 (2004), the\r\n  Supreme Court reiterated its holding in Apprendi that, under the Sixth\r\n  Amendment, all facts used to increase a defendantâ€™s sentence beyond the\r\n  statutory maximum must be charged and proven to a jury.Â Â  542 U.S. at ----, 124\r\n  S.Ct. at 2536.Â  The relevant \"statutory maximum\" is not the maximum sentence a\r\n  judge may impose after finding additional facts, but the maximum he may impose\r\n  without any additional findings.Â  Simpson v. United States, 376 F.3d 679\r\n  (7th Cir. 2004).Â  See also United States v. Booker, 375\r\n  F.3d 508Â  (7th Cir. 2004).Â  Under Blakely, the relevant statutory\r\n  maximum \"is the maximum sentence a judge may impose solely on the basis of\r\n  facts reflected in the jury verdict or admitted by the defendant.\" 542 U.S. at\r\n  303-304, 124 S.Ct. at 2537.\r\nWe find\r\n  the maximum permissible sentence here, pursuant to Apprendi and Blakely,\r\n  is controlled by the amount which was specifically submitted to the jury, i.e.,\r\n  that it could convict Dervin of trafficking if it believed she possessed ten or\r\n  more grams of cocaine.Â  Accordingly, the maximum sentence in the present case\r\n  should have been that for trafficking between 10-28 grams, which is 3-10 years,\r\n  and a $25,000 fine.Â  Therefore, the trial courtâ€™s imposition of a twenty-five\r\n  year sentence for trafficking between 200-400 grams of cocaine violated Apprendi because the jury did not find beyond a reasonable doubt that Dervin possessed\r\n  that amount of cocaine.Â  Further, we find counsel was ineffective in failing to\r\n  object to impostion of a 25 year sentence.Â  We reverse the denial of PCR and\r\n  remand for resentencing.[1]Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED FOR RESENTENCING.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Although an Apprendi error may be deemed\r\n  harmless, Washington v. Recuenco, 548 U.S. 212 (2006), we do not find\r\n  the error harmless in the present case.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"}]
