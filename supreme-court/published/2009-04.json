Houston, Jr., Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26626\r\nHeard March 3, 2009 - Filed April 6, 2009Â Â  \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley\r\n  M. Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis, Jr., Senior Assistant\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tGordon\r\n  H. Garrett, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  This\r\n  is an attorney discipline case involving admitted misconduct in the\r\n  administration of trust accounts.Â  The Commission on Lawyer Conduct Panel\r\n  (Panel) recommended that Charles E. Houston, Junior (Respondent): (1) receive a\r\n  Public Reprimand; (2) be required to retain the services of a Certified Public\r\n  Accountant to oversee the management of his trust account; (3) be required to\r\n  attend a minimum of four hours of Continuing Legal Education (CLE) seminars;\r\n  and (4) be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings.Â  The Office of\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) challenges the Panelâ€™s recommendation and urges a\r\n  harsher sanction.Â  Finding no reason to deviate from the Panelâ€™s\r\n  recommendation, we impose the recommended sanctions.\r\n\r\nFACTS\r\nActing\r\n  on an anonymous phone call, ODC conducted an investigation into Respondentâ€™s\r\n  administration of his trust account.Â  Before formal charges were filed,\r\n  Respondent and ODC entered into a Stipulation and Affidavit As To Facts, in\r\n  which Respondent admitted misconduct. In the Affidavit, Respondent admitted non-compliance\r\n  with the South Carolina Rules of Professional Conduct (RPC) regarding\r\n  recordkeeping and use of a trust account, including: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1. \r\n\t\t\t Unidentified Deposits - â€œRespondent stated that he routinely made deposits\r\n  using counter deposit tickets provided by the bank; however, Respondent failed\r\n  to identify the deposits with a file name, number, or case caption, and failed\r\n  to maintain a copy of the deposit ticket for his records.Â  Respondent stated\r\n  that he relied on his memory to recall whose funds were in his trust account at\r\n  any given time.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2.\r\n\t\t\t Unidentified Withdrawals - â€œThis review also revealed numerous â€˜counter\r\n  withdrawalsâ€™ using counter checks provided by the bank.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  identify the purpose of the withdrawals with a file name, number, or case\r\n  caption.â€\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3. \r\n\t\t\tLack of Recordkeeping - â€œRespondent admitted that he failed to maintain a\r\n  register, log, or document to reflect an accurate accounting of accumulated\r\n  attorneyâ€™s fees held in, or disbursed from the trust account.â€\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe Affidavit also\r\n  noted that after the investigation began, Respondent took certain corrective\r\n  measures to ensure future compliance with the Rules of Conduct, including\r\n  attending CLE seminars dealing with office management issues, installing new\r\n  office management software, and retaining the services of a certified\r\n  accountant.\r\nFollowing a\r\n  hearing, the Panel found that Respondent violated RPC Rules 1.15, safekeeping of\r\n  property, and 8.4, violating the Rules of Professional Conduct, and Rule 417,\r\n  SCACR, failure to maintain appropriate financial records.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe findings of the\r\n  Panel are entitled to great weight. In re Johnson, 380 S.C. 76, 80, 668\r\n  S.E.2d 416, 418 (S.C. 2008). Â However, this Court may make its own findings of\r\n  fact and conclusions of law and is not bound by the Panelâ€™s recommendation. In\r\n    re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 371, 520 S.E.2d 804, 806 (1999).Â  This Court has\r\n  the ultimate authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the\r\n  discipline is given rests entirely with this Court. In re Long, 346 S.C.\r\n  110, 112, 551 S.E.2d 586, 587 (2001).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nâ€œThis Court has\r\n  made it abundantly clear that an attorney is charged with a special\r\n  responsibility in maintaining and preserving the integrity of trust funds.â€ Matter\r\n    of Padgett, 290 S.C. 209, 349 S.E.2d 338 (1986).Â  Respondentâ€™s admitted\r\n  failure to maintain adequate records is a serious matter.Â  We note, however, that\r\n  the misconduct is limited to recordkeeping.Â  No clients complained, no client\r\n  funds were lost, Respondentâ€™s account was never overdrawn, and ODC does not claim\r\n  that Respondent misappropriated funds.Â  Moreover, as noted by the Panel,\r\n  Respondent has already taken corrective measures to ensure future compliance\r\n  with the rules regarding trust accounts.Â  \r\nConsidering\r\n  all of the circumstances as well as Respondentâ€™s disciplinary history, we agree\r\n  with the Panel that a public reprimand is appropriate.Â  We therefore publicly\r\n  reprimand Respondent for his misconduct and additionally require that\r\n  Respondent (1) retain the services of a Certified Public Accountant to oversee\r\n  the management of his trust account; (2) attend a minimum of four hours of\r\n  CLEs; and (3) pay the costs of the proceedings.[1]\r\nPUBLIC\r\n  REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] ODC argues that Respondent violated Rule 3.1 of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct by arguing in his Motion to Dismiss and at the hearing that ODC engaged\r\n  in racial profiling.Â  While we agree with the Panel that Respondentâ€™s claim was\r\n  meritless, we decline to find a violation of Rule 3.1.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26627","title":"State v.

McIntosh, Assistant\r\n  Deputy Attorney General Salley W. Elliott, Senior Assistant Attorney General\r\n  Harold M. Coombs, Jr., all of Columbia, and David Michael Pascoe, Jr., of\r\n  Orangeburg, for Petitioner.\r\n\t\t\t\tChief\r\n  Appellate Defender Joseph L. Savitz, III, of South Carolina Commission on\r\n  Indigent Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  PLEICONES:Â  Respondent Clinton\r\n  Roberson (Respondent) was tried in absentia and without counsel and was\r\n  convicted by a jury for failing to register as a sex offender.Â  He was\r\n  sentenced to 90 days in prison.Â  The trial court denied Respondentâ€™s motion for\r\n  a new trial on grounds that Respondent waived the right to counsel by his\r\n  actions.Â  Respondent appealed the trial courtâ€™s denial of his motion for a new\r\n  trial, contending that he was deprived of his right to counsel, and the Court\r\n  of Appeals reversed. State v. Roberson, 371 S.C. 334, 638 S.E.2d 93 (Ct.\r\n  App. 2006).Â  We granted certiorari and now reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent\r\n  was convicted for committing a lewd act with a minor and consequently was\r\n  required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 23-3-450 (1999) to register as a sex offender.Â \r\n  Respondent was further required by Â§ 23-3-460 to re-register annually and by Â§\r\n  23-3-470 to notify the sheriff if he changed addresses.Â  He was arrested for\r\n  failure to register as a sex offender in violation of Â§ 23-3-470(B)(1) (1999).\r\nRespondent was\r\n  released on bond the day after his arrest after signing a bail form, which\r\n  provided that he was released on the condition that he would appear at St.\r\n  George, South Carolina courthouse on the date set for trial.Â  As the date approached,\r\n  two letters of â€œNotice of Appearance for Courtâ€ were mailed to Respondentâ€™s\r\n  last known address, requiring him to appear at court.\r\nRespondent did not\r\n  appear for trial and a trial was conducted in his absence.Â  A jury found\r\n  Respondent guilty of failing to register as a sex offender and the judge\r\n  sentenced him to 90 days imprisonment.Â  The judge then sealed the verdict until\r\n  Respondent could be brought before the court.\r\nOver three years\r\n  later, Respondent was present for sentencing at the St. George courthouse, but\r\n  the court granted a motion by Respondentâ€™s counsel for a continuance in order\r\n  to allow him to consult a transcript to determine whether Respondent was\r\n  represented at the February trial.Â  A motions hearing was then held, at which\r\n  time Respondentâ€™s counsel moved for a new trial, on the ground that (1)\r\n  Respondent did not receive notice of the trial and so, did not make a knowing\r\n  and intelligent waiver of his right to appear, and (2) Respondent was deprived\r\n  of his right to counsel.Â  The sentencing judge denied the motion for a new\r\n  trial and imposed the sealed sentence.\r\nRespondent appealed\r\n  to the Court of Appeals, which reversed, finding that Respondentâ€™s failure to\r\n  appear did not constitute an affirmative waiver by conduct of his right to counsel. Roberson, supra.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in finding that Respondentâ€™s failure to appear did not\r\n  constitute an affirmative waiver of his right to counsel and reversing the\r\n  circuit court?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe\r\n  Sixth Amendment to the Constitution requires that in all criminal prosecutions,\r\n  the accused shall have the right to the assistance of counsel. U.S. Const. amend. VI.Â  Courts have recognized three ways in which a defendant may\r\n  relinquish his right to counsel: (1) waiver by an affirmative, verbal request;\r\n  (2) waiver by conduct; and (3) forfeiture. State v. Boykin, 324 S.C.\r\n  552, 556, 478 S.E.2d 689, 690 (Ct. App. 1996).Â  The record is clear that\r\n  Respondent did not waive counsel through an affirmative verbal request,\r\n  therefore if Respondent relinquished his right to counsel, it must have been\r\n  through waiver by conduct or forfeiture.\r\nWe held in State v. Cain, 277 S.C. 210, 284 S.E.2d 779\r\n  (1981), that a waiver of the right to counsel may be inferred from a\r\n  defendantâ€™s actions.Â  In that case, this Court noted that the appellant failed\r\n  to fulfill the conditions of his appearance bond and neglected to keep in\r\n  contact with the court, though he was aware of his impending trial date. Id. at 210-11, 284 S.E.2d at 779.Â  In the instant case, evidence established that\r\n  Respondent was advised at the bond hearing that he was to appear at court on\r\n  the trial date, he signed a bond form stating the same, and twice a letter of â€œNotice of Appearance for Courtâ€ was mailed to his\r\n  last known address.Â  Additionally, Respondentâ€™s background shows a familiarity\r\n  with the court system.\r\nWe\r\n  find that given Respondentâ€™s criminal history, his disregard for the\r\n  instructions of the court, and his inexcusable absence from trial, a waiver by\r\n  conduct of the right to counsel is inferable.\r\nIn\r\n  reversing the trial court, the Court of Appeals held that to find any waiver by\r\n  conduct, the requirements of Faretta v. California, 422 U.S. 806, 95 S.Ct. 2525, 45 L.Ed.2d 562 (1975), must be met. Roberson, 317 S.C. at\r\n  337, 638 S.E.2d at 94-95.Â  The Court of Appeals therefore reversed since â€œthere\r\n  is no evidence in the record establishing that a trial judge advised Roberson\r\n  of his right to counsel and warned him of the dangers of self-representation.â€ Id., citing Prince v. State, 301 S.C. 422, 423-24, 392 S.E.2d 462, 463\r\n  (1990).\r\nWe\r\n  find both Prince and Faretta inapplicable to the instant case.Â  Both\r\n  cases addressed defendants who elected self-representation, and therefore the\r\n  trial court was required to (1) advise the accused of his right to counsel, and\r\n  (2) adequately warn the accused of the dangers of self-representation. Prince,\r\n  301 S.C. at 423-24, 392 S.E.2d at 463; Faretta, 422 U.S. at 835, 95 S.Ct. at 2541, 45 L.Ed.2d at 581-82.Â  In the instant case, Respondent gave no\r\n  indication that he wished to proceed pro se and instead failed to appear\r\n  for trial.Â  Consequently the Faretta requirements are irrelevant and\r\n  pose no bar to waiver. See Jackson v. State, 868 N.E.2d 494, 500\r\n  (Ind. 2001) (warnings as to the perils of self-representation are irrelevant\r\n  where defendant did not indicate a desire to represent himself).\r\nWe\r\n  find that a waiver by conduct of the right to counsel is inferable from\r\n  Respondentâ€™s actions.Â  Therefore, the Court of Appeals erred in reversing the\r\n  trial court.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice E.

App. filed September 20, 2006).Â  The sole issue on certiorari is whether the Court of\r\n  Appeals properly upheld the trial courtâ€™s denial of Robinsonâ€™s Batson[1] motion.Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nRobinson is the personal representative of the estate\r\n  of his deceased wife, Brenda, who passed away while under the care of\r\n  Respondents on September 19, 2000.[2]Â \r\n  Robinson brought wrongful death and survival actions against the hospital and\r\n  treating physicians.Â Â  The trial commenced on March 21, 2005. \r\nDuring jury\r\n  selection, counsel for the defense struck four potential jurors: three black\r\n  females and one white male.Â  The jury was ultimately composed of five white\r\n  males, seven white females, one black female alternate, and one white female\r\n  alternate.Â  Robinson made a Batson motion to set aside the stateâ€™s\r\n  strikes of the three black potential jurors.Â  \r\nIn response,\r\n  defense counsel explained the rationale for his strike of Juror No. 12 stating,\r\n  she was â€œa 53-year-old black female would more identify with the 52-year-old\r\n  decedent in this case than she would any other party.â€Â  Defense counsel also\r\n  gave his reasons for striking the other black female jurors being that one had\r\n  limited education and limited life experience due to her youth, and the other was\r\n  too young and unemployed. \r\nThe trial court held\r\n  the explanations given were race neutral such that Robinson had not met his\r\n  burden of demonstrating purposeful discrimination; the Court of Appeals\r\n  affirmed.Â  Robinson v. Bon Secours St. Francis Health Sys. Inc., Op. No.\r\n  2006-UP-333 (S.C. Ct. App. filed September 20, 2006).Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in affirming the denial of Petitionerâ€™s Batson motion?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth\r\n  Amendment prohibits the striking of a venire person on the basis of race or\r\n  gender.Â  McCrea v. Gheraibeh, 380 S.C. 183, 669 S.E.2d 333 (2008).Â  A Batson hearing must be held when members of a cognizable racial group or gender are\r\n  struck and the opposing party requests a hearing.Â  State v. Adams, 322\r\n  S.C. 114, 124, 470 S.E.2d 366, 372 (1996).Â  At the hearing, the proponent of\r\n  the strike must offer a facially race-neutral explanation for the strike.Â  Once\r\n  the proponent states a race-neutral reason, the burden is on the party\r\n  challenging the strike to show the explanation is mere pretext, either by\r\n  showing similarly situated members of another race were seated on the jury or\r\n  that the reason given for the strike is so fundamentally implausible as to\r\n  constitute mere pretext despite a lack of disparate treatment.Â Â  State v.\r\n    Evins, 373 S.C. 404, 415, 645 S.E.2d 904, 909 (2007), cert. denied,\r\n  --- U.S. ----, 128 S.Ct. 662, 169 L.Ed.2d 521 (2007); McCrea v. Gheraibeh.Â  \r\nAn explanation for\r\n  a jury strike will be deemed race-neutral unless a discriminatory intent is\r\n    inherent.Â  Purkett v. Elem, 514 U.S. 765, 768, (1995); Adams,\r\n  322 S.C. at 123, 470 S.E.2d 471 (emphasis supplied).Â  Where the stated reason\r\n  is inherently discriminatory, the inquiry ends and a pretext inquiry is\r\n  obviated.Â  McCrea, 380 S.C. at ___, 669 S.E.2d at 335.Â  On two\r\n  occasions, this Court has found the stated reason for a juror strike facially\r\n  discriminatory.Â Â  In Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 56, 495 S.E.2d 205,\r\n  208 (1998), we held a peremptory challenge based upon a characterization of the\r\n  juror as a â€œredneckâ€ was facially discriminatory, and therefore violative of Batson.Â \r\n  Most recently, in McCrea, we found a solicitorâ€™s â€œuneasinessâ€ over a\r\n  potential jurorâ€™s dreadlocks was insufficient to satisfy the race-neutral\r\n  requirement.Â  \r\nHere, defense\r\n  counsel stated the reason he struck the juror was that she was a â€œ53-year-old\r\n  black femaleâ€ who â€œwould more identify with the 52-year-old decedent in this\r\n  case than she would any other party.â€ Â The reason is, on its face, inherently\r\n  discriminatory.[3]Â \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court erred in proceeding to the next step of the\r\n  inquiry, i.e., whether the stated reason was pretextual.Â  Accord McCrea (trial court must first elicit race-neutral reason for strike before proceeding\r\n  with pretext inquiry).Â  We hold the trial court erred in denying Robinsonâ€™s Batson motion.Â  The case is reversed and remanded for a new trial.\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.Â Â  \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. \r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n[2]Â  Brenda Robinson was a fifty-two year old\r\n  epileptic who had a shunt implanted in August 2000 to drain fluid from her\r\n  brain.Â  She went to the St. Francis Hospital Emergency Room on September 11,\r\n  2000 after a seizure where she was evaluated and discharged.Â Â  As a result of\r\n  this evaluation, Robinson was subsequently advised she had a urinary tract\r\n  infection and was proscribed antibiotics.Â  She went home and began having\r\n  seizures several days later.Â  She returned to the hospital on September 15,\r\n  2000, and became comatose.Â Â  She died four days later.\r\n[3]Â  We are unpersuaded by the claim that the reason\r\n  for the strike was a similarity in age, as opposed to race.Â  At best, the\r\n  age factor provides an alternate motivation for the strike.Â Â  This Court,\r\n  however, has specifically rejected a dual motivation analysis in the context of\r\n  a Batson claim.Â  Payton v. Kearse, 329 S.C. 51, 59, 495 S.E.2d\r\n  205, 210 (1998) (notwithstanding validity of remaining explanations, one\r\n  racially discriminatory reason vitiates strike).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26630","title":"In the Matter of George Theisen","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26630","description":"Issue on appeal is whether 8 month statute of limitation in S.C.

Shipman, of Nelson, Mullins, Riley &amp; Scarborough, and\r\n  Robert C. Wilson, Jr., all of Greenville, for Appellants.\r\n\t\t\t\tFrank\r\n  S. Holleman, III and Lesley R. Moore, both of Wyche, Burgess, Freeman &amp;\r\n  Parham; John A. Hagins, Jr., and Stephen R. H. Lewis, both of Covington,\r\n  Patrick, Hagins, Stern &amp; Lewis, all of Greenville, for Respondents.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  WALLER: Â This is a family dispute\r\n  concerning the will of George Theisen, who died on November 16, 2004.Â  Appellant,\r\n  Lisbeth Theisen, filed an action in February 2006 challenging the validity of\r\n  the will. The trial court granted summary judgment to Respondents, holding the\r\n  action was barred by the eight month statute of limitations set forth in S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108(3). Â We affirm.Â  Â \r\nFACTS\r\nLisbeth Theisen and Clifford Theisen (Appellants) are\r\n  children of the decedent, George Theisen.Â  Theisen was also survived by 3 other\r\n  children, Claude, Susan and Eva Marie, as well as his wife Joan, who are\r\n  Respondents in this matter.Â  Approximately two months after Theisenâ€™s death, on\r\n  January 11, 2005, Joan Theisen filed a will dated June 7, 1993, and two\r\n  codicils dated 1996 and 1998, requesting informal probate in Essex County, New Jersey.[1]Â \r\n  Notice of admission of the will to probate in New Jersey was simultaneously\r\n  sent to Georgeâ€™s children.Â  The Personal Representatives of the Estate (Joan\r\n  Theisen and Richard Doris) filed certified copies of the Essex County Probate\r\n  proceeding with the Greenville County Probate Court on January 27, 2005.Â  \r\nOn March 3, 2005, Lisbeth Theisen, a New Jersey resident, filed a complaint in the Greenville\r\n  County Probate Court requesting â€œDesignation of Forum for Primary Probate of\r\n  Estate.â€Â  The Probate Court held that since no probate proceeding was pending\r\n  in South Carolina, principles of comity required the New Jersey Court to\r\n  determine any jurisdictional issues.Â  \r\nApproximately one\r\n  year later, on February 3, 2006, Lisbeth filed a Petition for Formal Testacy in\r\n  Greenville County Probate Court challenging the validity of her fatherâ€™s will\r\n  and codicils, contending they were executed at a time when he lacked\r\n  testamentary capacity and was subject to undue influence.Â  The matter was\r\n  removed to circuit court, and Respondents filed for summary judgment contending\r\n  Lisbethâ€™s petition was untimely and was barred by the statute of limitations.Â \r\n  Lisbethâ€™s brother, Clifford joined her opposition to the motion for summary\r\n  judgment.[2]Â \r\n  The trial court held two hearings in August 2006, after which an order was\r\n  entered granting Respondents summary judgment.Â  The trial court held the eight\r\n  month statute of limitations of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108 (3) barred Lisbethâ€™s\r\n  action.Â  Lisbeth and Cliffordâ€™s Rule 59(e) SCRCP motions were thereafter\r\n  denied.Â  This appeal follows. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.Â \r\n  Did the circuit court err in holding the action barred by the eight month\r\n  statute of limitation set forth in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108?\r\n\t2.Â \r\n  Does the statute of limitation begin to run upon admission of a will to\r\n  probate, or upon closing of the estate?\r\n\t3.Â \r\n  Does the application of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108 violate due process and equal\r\n  protection?\r\n\r\n\r\n1.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  62-3-108\r\n\r\n\tS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-108 states, generally:\r\n\tNo\r\n  informal probate or . . . formal testacy or appointment proceeding, other than\r\n  a proceeding to probate a will previously probated at the testatorâ€™s domicile .\r\n  . . may be commenced more than ten years after the decedentâ€™s death.Â \r\n  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nHowever, the statute sets\r\n  forth certain exceptions, including:\r\n\r\n\tÂ (1)\r\n  if a previous proceeding was dismissed because of doubt about the fact of the\r\n  decedentâ€™s death, . . . proceedings may be maintained at any time thereafter\r\n  upon a finding that the decedentâ€™s death occurred prior to the initiation of\r\n  the previous proceeding and the applicant or petitioner has not delayed unduly\r\n  in initiating the subsequent proceeding and if that previous proceeding was\r\n  commenced within the time limits of this section;Â  \r\n\t(2)\r\n  appropriate probate, appointment, or testacy proceedings may be maintained in\r\n  relation to the estate of an absent, disappeared, or missing person for whose\r\n  estate a conservator has been appointed, at any time within three years after\r\n  the conservator becomes able to establish the death of the protected person;Â \r\n  and \r\n\t(3) a proceeding to contest an informally probated will and to secure appointment of the\r\n  person with legal priority for appointment in the event the contest is\r\n  successful may be commenced within the later of eight months from the\r\n    informal probate or one year from the decedentâ€™s death.Â  \r\n\r\nEmphasis supplied.[3]Â  \r\nThe trial court\r\n  ruled that since Theisenâ€™s will was admitted to informal probate in New Jersey\r\n  on January 11, 2005, Lisbethâ€™s action, commenced on February 3, 2006, was\r\n  barred by the eight month statute of limitations in subsection (3) above. Â We\r\n  agree.Â  \r\nAppellants contend\r\n  the 8-month limitation is inapplicable here for two reasons: first, they\r\n  contend the statute applies only to informal probates which occur in this\r\n    state; second, they contend South Carolina law requires a decedentâ€™s\r\n  will first be filed for informal probate in the county of the decedentâ€™s\r\n  domicile.Â  We disagree.\r\nThe plain and\r\n  unambiguous language of Â§ 62-3-108 (3) plainly applies to any informal\r\n  probate.Â Â  Anderson v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 314 S.C.\r\n  140, 442 S.E.2d 179 (1994) (words of a statute should be accorded their plain\r\n  and ordinary meaning without resorting to subtle or forced construction to\r\n  limit or expand statuteâ€™s operation).Â  There is simply no language in the\r\n  statute which implies it excludes an informal probate conducted in another\r\n  state.Â  If the Legislature had intended the eight month limitation period to\r\n  apply only to wills which were informally probated in this state, it\r\n  could have included such language in the statute.Â  Estate of Guide v.Â \r\n    Spooner, 318 S.C. 335, 457 S.E.2d 623 (Ct. App. 1995) (if Legislature\r\n  intended statute to apply to certain proceedings, it could have done so by\r\n  including such language).Â  We find no persuasive arguments as to why Â§ 62-1-308\r\n  (3) should be construed to apply only to wills probated in South Carolina.[4]Â  \r\nLisbeth and\r\n  Clifford also contend that under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-201,[5] the proper venue for the first informal or formal testacy proceeding was Greenville County, the county of Theisenâ€™s domicile.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nAppellants cannot\r\n  escape the eight month statute of limitation of Â§ 62-3-108 (3) by raising a\r\n  venue statute. Â Â The remedy to challenge venue was to raise the issue within\r\n  the statutory period (which they did via the â€œDesignation of Forum Petitionâ€);[6] however, Appellants failed to perfect an appeal from that order and instead\r\n  waited until after the expiration of the eight month limitations period to file\r\n  a challenge to the validity of the informal probate.Â  Appellants cannot now\r\n  complain that venue was proper only in Greenville.Â  Plum Creek Dev. Co. v. City of Conway, 334 S.C. 30, 34, 512 S.E.2d 106, 109 (1999). (res\r\n    judicata bars subsequent actions by same parties when the claims arise out\r\n  of the same transaction or occurrence that was the subject of a prior action\r\n  between those parties).Â  Â Â \r\nMoreover, Theisenâ€™s will\r\n  specifically directs that it be probated in New Jersey, and the Probate Court there\r\n  found informal probate of the will was proper under New Jersey law,\r\n  specifically N.J. St. Ann. Â§ 3B:3-28, which provides:\r\n\r\n\tWhere the will of any individual\r\n  not resident in this State at his death has not been admitted to probate in the\r\n  state, jurisdiction or country in which he then resided and no proceeding is\r\n  there pending for the probate of the will, and he died owning real estate\r\n  situate in any county of this State or personal property, or evidence of the\r\n    ownership thereof, situate therein at the time of probate, the Superior Court\r\n    or the surrogate's court may admit the will to probate and grant letters\r\n  thereon.Â  (Emphasis added).[7]\r\n\r\nThe Probate Court found\r\n  Theisen owned a bank account and stock certificates which were situate in New Jersey at the time of his death.Â  Accordingly, venue was proper under New Jersey law.Â  \r\nLastly, Appellants\r\n  cite Albert Moses, The South Carolina Probate Practice Manual, Â§ 3-5 (4th Ed. 2001) for the proposition that the time limitations set forth in Â§ 62-1-308\r\n  (3) do not apply to a will probated elsewhere.Â  The Probate and Practice Manual\r\n  states:\r\n\r\n\tTime\r\n  limitations on formal proceedings.Â \r\n  Formal proceedings to contest an informally probated will (and for appointment\r\n  of a personal representative) must be commenced within the later of 8 months\r\n  from the informal probate or 1 year of death.Â  Otherwise, formal proceedings\r\n  (and informal proceedings for probate and appointment must be commenced within\r\n  10 years of decedentâ€™s death.Â  These time limitations neither apply to a\r\n    will probated elsewhere nor to the estates of persons absent, disappeared, or\r\n    missing. \r\n\r\n(Emphasis supplied).Â  The highlighted\r\n  language appears to relate to subsections (1) and (2) of Â§ 62-1-308.Â  Those sections\r\n  alter the normal statute of limitations for probate proceedings in cases in\r\n  which the death of the decedent was in doubt, or when an individual was absent,\r\n  disappeared, or missing, and their death has been recently discovered.Â  The\r\n  Probate Manualâ€™s statement that the time limitations are inapplicable to the estates\r\n  of persons missing, absent, disappeared or whose death is in doubt are\r\n  supported by the language of the statute itself.Â  However, there is no language\r\n  in the statute which would demonstrate that the limitations period therein was\r\n  not intended to apply to wills â€œprobated elsewhere.â€Â  Accordingly, we are not persuaded\r\n  by the language of the Probate Manual.Â  We hold the trial court properly applied\r\n  the statute of limitations of Â§ 62-1-308 (3).\r\n2.Â  INFORMAL PROBATE\r\nAppellants next\r\n  contend that, even if the eight month limitations period of Â§ 62-3-108 (3) is\r\n  applicable, the statute does not begin to run until an informal probate is closed,\r\n  rather than when the will is admitted to probate.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nThis Court has\r\n  previously recognized that the time limitation runs from the time the will is\r\n  admitted to probate, and that fixing such a time is within the province of the\r\n  Legislature.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 235 S.C. 228, 110 S.E.2d 922\r\n  (1959).Â  In Wooten, a will was admitted to probate on March 8, 1957, and\r\n  the petitioner attempted to challenge the will on January 27, 1958.Â  The Court\r\n  held the action barred by the six month limitation period set forth in S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 19-255 (1952) (the predecessor to Â§ 62-3-108) such that the\r\n  petitionerâ€™s attempt to challenge the will on grounds of undue influence and\r\n  improper execution could not be considered.Â  See also Jackson v.\r\n    Cannon, 266 S.C. 198, 222 S.E.2d 494 (1976) (under Â§ S.C. Code Â§ 19-255,\r\n  anyone contesting the validity of a will must commence an action to have the\r\n  will proved in solemn form within six months after the will was admitted to\r\n  probate).Â  It is clear from the caselaw that the statute begins to run from the\r\n  date of the willâ€™s admission to probate.\r\nMoreover, the\r\n  language of S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 62-3-301 et seq. clearly envisions a will\r\n  is â€œinformally probatedâ€ upon admission by the court.Â Â  See e.g.,\r\n  Â§ 62-3-302 (upon receipt of application requesting informal probate, court\r\n  shall issue a written statement of informal probate); Â§ 62-3-303 (findings\r\n  required to admit will to informal probate); Â§ 62-3-305 (if court is not\r\n  satisfied will is entitled to be informally probated, court may decline\r\n  application).Â  \r\nLastly, as noted by\r\n  the trial court, the legal treatises are in accord that the time limitations in\r\n  which to challenge a will run from the time it is admitted to probate.Â  See 95 CJS Wills Â§ 533 (time limitation on right to seek review of a will\r\n  commences from the date of its proof, or, in other words, the date that it was\r\n  admitted to probate or refers to the act of the clerk accepting the will for\r\n  probate, rather than date upon which the estate is closed); 80 AmJur Wills Â§ 808 (notice of probate of a will, or of the admission of a will to probate,\r\n  may start an applicable time limitation for bringing a will contest).Â  \r\nHere, there is no\r\n  dispute but that the will was admitted to probate by the New Jersey Court on\r\n  January 11, 2005.Â  Accordingly, Lisbethâ€™s petition, filed in February 2006, was\r\n  barred under the 8 month statute of limitations.Â  Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â Â \r\n3.Â  EQUAL PROTECTION/DUE\r\n  PROCESS\r\nLastly, Appellants\r\n  contend application of the 8-month limitation period violates their due process\r\n  and equal protection rights.[8]Â Â \r\n  We disagree.\r\nDue process is\r\n  violated when a party is denied fundamental fairness. City of Spartanburg v. Parris, 251 S.C. 187, 191, 161 S.E.2d 228, 230 (1968).Â  Due process is\r\n  flexible and calls for such procedural protections as the particular situation\r\n  demands.Â  Sloan v. S.C. Bd. Of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, 370 S.C. 452,\r\n  636 S.E.2d 598 (2006).Â  The fundamental requirement of due process is the\r\n  opportunity to be heard at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.Â  S.C.\r\n    Depâ€™t. of Soc. Servs. v. Beeks, 325 S.C. 243, 246, 481 S.E.2d 703, 705\r\n  (1997).\r\nThe requirements of\r\n  equal protection are met if: (1) a classification bears a reasonable\r\n  relationship to the legislative purpose sought to be effected; (2) the members\r\n  of the class are treated alike under similar circumstances; and (3) the\r\n  classification rests on a reasonable basis.Â  The constitutional guaranty of\r\n  equal protection of the law requires all members of a class to be treated alike\r\n  under similar circumstances and conditions, and that any classification not be\r\n  arbitrary but bear a reasonable relation to the legislative purpose sought to\r\n  be effected.Â  Sloan v. S.C. . Bd. Of Physical Therapy Examâ€™rs, supra, citing Broome v. Truluck, 270 S.C. 227, 230, 241 S.E.2d 739\r\n  (1978).\r\nThe circuit courtâ€™s\r\n  application of the statute of limitations simply did not deprive Appellants of\r\n  due process or equal protection.Â Â  They had notice of the proceedings, and they\r\n  had opportunities to object to them both in South Carolina and in New Jersey.Â Â  They failed to perfect their appeal from the Probate Courtâ€™s Order denying\r\n  their â€œDesignation of Forumâ€ petition; they failed to timely file a petition\r\n  for formal testacy within the applicable statute of limitations in South Carolina, and they failed to object to the informal testacy proceedings in New Jersey.Â  We find Appellants have suffered neither a due process nor an equal protection\r\n  violation.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe trial court\r\n  properly applied the 8 month statute of limitation contained in S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Â§ 62-3-108 (3) to find Appellantsâ€™ challenge to the will of their deceased\r\n  father was untimely.Â  Accordingly, the trial courtâ€™s ruling is affirmed.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  BEATTY, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Â \r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Â Theisenâ€™s will specifically directs that it be\r\n  probated in New Jersey.Â  The will and codicils were drafted by New Jersey law firms, and instruct:\r\n\r\n\tAlthough\r\n  I am currently domiciled in the State of South Carolina, a portion of my\r\n  property and estate is located in the State of New Jersey. . . .

It is my express intention and unequivocal desire\r\n  that the laws of the State of New Jersey shall apply.Â  \r\n\r\nTheisen began his\r\n  business, T&amp;S Brass and Bronze Works in New York City in 1947; he moved the\r\n  headquarters to Travelerâ€™s Rest, SC, in 1978.Â  Theisen was the majority\r\n  shareholder, and the stock certificates were held in the offices of his New Jersey attorneys.Â  \r\n[2]Â  Theisenâ€™s will and codicils bequeath all of his\r\n  shares in T &amp; S to his wife, Joan, son Claude, and daughters Eva-Marie and\r\n  Susan while leaving no stock to Lisbeth or Clifford.Â  The will and codicils\r\n  exclude Lisbeth and Clifford as his issue.Â  \r\n[3]Â  The statute is taken directly from the language\r\n  of the Uniform Probate Code Â§ 3-108.Â  However, the UPC Â§ 3-108 (3) permits up\r\n  to twelve months from the date of informal probate or three years from the date\r\n  of decedentâ€™s death to contest an informally probate will.Â  \r\n[4] Â Appellants contend most states do not have\r\n  either informal probate proceedings or do not require notice for informal\r\n  probate.Â  It is uncontested however, that New Jersey does have informal probate\r\n  proceedings, and that Appellants were given written notice.Â  See N.J.\r\n  Rules of Court, R. 4:80-6.\r\n[5]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-201 requires venue for the first informal or formal testacy or\r\n  appointment proceedings after a decedentâ€™s death be either (1) in the county\r\n  where the decedent had his domicile at the time of his death; or (2) if the\r\n  decedent was not domiciled in this State, in any county where property of the\r\n  decedent was located at the time of his death.\r\n[6]Â  Alternatively, they could have timely filed a\r\n  will contest in South Carolina within the eight month limitations period.\r\n[7]Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 62-3-201 (a) (2) has an\r\n  analogous provision that venue is proper: â€œ(2) if the decedent was not\r\n  domiciled in this State, in any county where property of the decedent was\r\n  located at the time of his death.â€\r\n[8]Â  U.S. Const. amend XIV, Â§ 1; S.C.

Covert, 368 S.C. 188, 628 S.E.2d 482 (Ct. App. 2006)[1] and now affirm, as modified, that\r\n  courtâ€™s decision to grant respondent a new trial.Â  In a split decision, Judges\r\n  Short and Anderson found reversible error in the juryâ€™s possession of a statute\r\n  during deliberations; in addition, Judge Short found that evidence should have\r\n  been suppressed, and Judge Anderson found reversible error in the verdict form.\r\nWe hold, as did Judge Short, that an unsigned search warrant is\r\n  invalid, and agree with Judge Anderson that when a verdict form is submitted to\r\n  a jury in a criminal case, it must affirmatively offer a â€œnot guiltyâ€ option.Â \r\n  Finally, while we agree with Judges Short and Anderson that it was error to\r\n  permit this jury to have a written version of the trafficking statute with it\r\n  during deliberations, we would not find sufficient prejudice from that error\r\n  alone to warrant reversal.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\tDid Judge Short err in holding that an unsigned \r\n\t\t\tsearch warrant is invalid?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\tDid Judge Anderson err in finding the verdict form \r\n\t\t\there was so prejudicial as to require reversal?\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3)\r\n\t\t\tDid permitting the jury to have a written version \r\n\t\t\tof the trafficking statute with it during deliberations require \r\n\t\t\treversal?\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n1.Â  Warrant\r\nThe search warrant in this case is signed by the\r\n  magistrate, and dated September 28, 2002; the accompanying two-page affidavit\r\n  is signed by her on each page, and both these signatures are dated September\r\n  26, 2002.Â  The return is signed and dated September 27, 2002.Â  It is undisputed\r\n  that the warrant was obtained and served on September 26, 2002.\r\nAt trial,\r\n  respondent contended that the warrant was unsigned when it was served, that it\r\n  was therefore invalid, and that accordingly the evidence seized pursuant to the\r\n  search should be suppressed.Â  Respondent argued that, without the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  signature, the warrant was not issued within the meaning of South Carolinaâ€™s\r\n  search warrant statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-140 (1985).Â  The trial judge\r\n  refused to suppress the evidence even though he found the warrant had not been\r\n  signed before it was served, holding that the search warrant statute was\r\n  subject to a â€œgood faithâ€ exception, and that such an exception was applicable\r\n  here. \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Judge Short held that the search warrant was not issued within the\r\n  meaning of the statute because it lacked a timely signature.Â  Judge Short also\r\n  held there was a good faith exception to the statutory warrant procedures, but\r\n  that it was inapplicable here.Â  We agree that the absence of the magistrateâ€™s\r\n  signature at the time the warrant was served invalidates it, but do not reach\r\n  the issue whether there exists a â€œgood faithâ€ exception to the statutory\r\n  warrant requirements since we find, as explained below, that no warrant was\r\n  ever issued.\r\nWe have held, in\r\n  the context of an arrest warrant, that such a warrant is not lawful where the\r\n  issuing judicial officer failed to sign the warrant on the space provided on\r\n  the warrant form.Â  Davis v. Sanders, 40 S.C. 507, 19 S.E 138\r\n  (1894).Â  Although the State would characterize such an omission as merely\r\n  procedural or ministerial, we disagree.Â  The Davis Court gave a\r\n  persuasive explanation of the signature requirement, albeit in the context of\r\n  an arrest warrant:\r\n\r\n\t[W]hen\r\n  it is remembered that a sheriff or other officer, who undertakes to arrest a\r\n  citizen under a warrant, is bound to show his warrant, if demanded, to the\r\n  person proposed to be arrested, and if he refuses to do so the arrest may be\r\n  lawfully resisted [internal citation omitted], we think it would be very dangerous\r\n  to the peace of society for the court to hold that a paper, which shows on its\r\n  face that it is an unfinished paperâ€¦would be a sufficient justification for an\r\n  arrest.\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  same policy considerations apply to a search warrant, [2] and thus the lack of the issuing officerâ€™s signature is not excusable as merely\r\n  procedural or ministerial, but rather negates the existence of a warrant,\r\n  creating instead â€œan unfinished paper.â€Â  As the Davis Court went on to\r\n  hold, the fact that the issuing officer intended to sign the warrant and had in\r\n  fact signed the back was not sufficient to validate it, nor was the arrest\r\n  legal despite the fact the officers who executed the arrest pursuant to the\r\n  â€œwarrantâ€ were â€œentirely innocent of any intentional wrong.â€\r\nThe Davis requirement that a warrant must be signed by the issuing judicial officer in\r\n  order to be complete is a common law decision predicated on public policy\r\n  considerations.Â  The signature is the assurance that a judicial officer has\r\n  found that law enforcement has made the requisite probable cause showing, and\r\n  serves as notice to the citizen upon whom the warrant is served that it is a\r\n  validly issued warrant.Â  Without the signature, it is merely an â€œunfinished\r\n  paper.â€ Â Davis, supra; see also DuBose v. DuBose,\r\n  90 S.C. 87, 72 S.E. 645 (1911) (â€œBut it has been decided [in Davis]\r\n  that, when an officer is performing the ministerial duty of issuing a paper on\r\n  compliance with certain conditions prescribed by law, his signature at the foot\r\n  of the paper he intended to sign is necessary to its validityâ€).\r\nWe consider also whether the unsigned warrant can be\r\n  upheld in the face of Â§ 17-13-140, the general search warrant statute.Â  The\r\n  statute contains requirements different from those mandated by the Fourth\r\n  Amendment, and is in some ways â€œmore strictâ€ than the federal constitution.Â  State\r\n    v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 352 S.E.2d 471 (1987).Â  While we have recognized\r\n  a â€œgood faithâ€ exception to the statuteâ€™s requirements where the officers make\r\n  a good faith attempt to comply with the statuteâ€™s affidavit procedures, McKnight, supra, explaining State v. Sachs, 264 S.C. 541, 216 S.E.2d 501\r\n  (1975), we have left open the question whether a good faith exception would be\r\n  applied where â€œthe officers reasonably believe the warrant is valid when the search\r\n  is made, but is subsequently determined to be invalid.â€Â  McKnight, supra.Â \r\n  Here, we do not reach the question whether there exists a good faith exception to\r\n  the statute where a defective warrant is issued, since under South Carolina law\r\n  an unsigned warrant is not a warrant, and is not capable of being issued within\r\n  the meaning of Â§ 17-13-140.Â  See also Davis, supra (officers good faith irrelevant where warrant is not signed).\r\nThe circuit court erred in refusing to suppress the\r\n  evidence seized pursuant to the unsigned â€œwarrant.â€Â  Respondent is therefore\r\n  entitled to a new trial.\r\n2.Â  Verdict Form\r\nIn this case, the jury was given a verdict form which\r\n  tracked the provisions of the trafficking statute, but did not specifically\r\n  allow the jury to return a â€œnot guiltyâ€ verdict.Â  We agree with Judge Anderson\r\n  that this was error and hold that henceforth, any verdict form given to a jury\r\n  for use in a criminal case must specifically include as an option â€œnot guilty.â€Â \r\n  We therefore overrule State v. Myers, 344 S.C. 532, 544 S.E.2d 851 (Ct. App. 2001) to the extent it holds that a jury charge can negate prejudice from the lack\r\n  of a â€œnot guiltyâ€ choice on a verdict form.\r\n3.Â  Trafficking Statute\r\nJudge Short and Judge Anderson found reversible error in\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s submission to the jury of the trafficking statute, while\r\n  Judge Goolsby found no error.Â  Since this case was tried and the appeal decided\r\n  by the Court of Appeals, we have held that it is within the trial judgeâ€™s\r\n  discretion to â€œsubmit its instructions on the law to the jury in writing.â€Â  State\r\n    v. Turner, 373 S.C. 121, 644 S.E.2d 693 (2007).Â  We caution the bench\r\n  again, as we did in Turner, that this practice should be used sparingly,\r\n  and only where it will aid the jury and where it will not prejudice the defendant.Â \r\n  It is never appropriate, however, to give only part of the charge to the jury\r\n  as was done in this case.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe Court of Appeals decision reversing respondentâ€™s\r\n  convictions and sentences is\r\nAFFIRMED AS MODIFIED.\r\nWALLER,\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., concurring\r\n  in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nChief Justice Toal:Â Â Â Â  Although I concur in the decision to affirm the\r\n  court of appealsâ€™ decision reversing Covertâ€™s conviction, I write separately\r\n  because I would reach this decision on different grounds.Â  \r\nAs\r\n  a primary matter, I do not find that Davis v. Sanders, 40 S.C. 507, 19\r\n  S.E. 138 (1894) controls this case. Â Davis was decided over one hundred\r\n  years ago, prior to the passage of Â§ 17-13-140.Â  Moreover, the Davis  Court, in the absence of any statutory authority, relied on prior case law in\r\n  declaring that a warrant must be signed.[3]Â  See State v. Vaughn, 16 S.C.L. (Harp.) 313 (1824)\r\n  (holding that a warrant that was signed but not sealed was nevertheless a valid\r\n  warrant).Â  Moreover, I find it significant that the parties in Davis conceded that a warrant had to be signed, thereby leaving only the issue of\r\n  whether the magistrateâ€™s notation on the warrant constituted a signature for\r\n  the Courtâ€™s determination.Â  Accordingly, I believe that Davis is\r\n  somewhat irrelevant to the facts of this case and that we must solely look to Â§\r\n  17-13-140 to determine the validity of this warrant.Â  \r\nSection 17-13-140 does not specifically require the\r\n  magistrate to sign the warrant, but rather, merely requires that a magistrate\r\n  â€œissueâ€ the warrant.Â  Nonetheless, a magistrateâ€™s signature indicates that she\r\n  has made the necessary probable cause finding required before issuing the\r\n  warrant.Â  Even assuming that an unsigned warrant is defective, I do not believe\r\n  that this alone necessarily renders the warrant void ab initio.Â  \r\nThis Court has held that the good faith exception to\r\n  the exclusionary rule applies in cases where officers make a good faith attempt\r\n  to comply with the statuteâ€™s affidavit requirements.Â  See State v. McKnight, 291 S.C. 110, 112-13, 352 S.E.2d 471, 472 (1987) (refusing to\r\n  apply the good faith exception where the officers failed to attempt to comply\r\n  in good faith to the affidavit requirements); State v. Sachs, 264 S.C.\r\n  541, 559, 216 S.E.2d 501, 510 (1975) (allowing evidence to be admitted pursuant\r\n  to the good faith exception where officers attempted in good faith to comply\r\n  with the statutory requirements).Â  In my view, the policy reasons for applying\r\n  the good faith exception to the exclusionary rule in other cases are applicable\r\n  in this case.Â  See State v. Harvin, 345 S.C. 190, 194, 547 S.E.2d 497, 500\r\n  (2001) (recognizing that the main purpose of the exclusionary rule is the deterrence\r\n  of police misconduct).Â  Covert does not\r\n  allege that the officers knew the warrant was unsigned or deliberately obtained\r\n  the warrant without a signature, and the record contains no evidence that he\r\n  was prejudiced by the statutory violation.Â  Therefore, I would hold that the\r\n  officers attempted in good faith to comply with Â§ 17-13-140â€™s requirements and\r\n  the exclusionary rule should not render the evidence inadmissible.\r\nIn my view, the fatal flaw in the Stateâ€™s case is its\r\n  failure to present any evidence at trial that the magistrate made a probable\r\n  cause finding.Â  As the majority observes, the signature on the warrant\r\n  indicates that a judicial officer found that law enforcement made the requisite\r\n  probable cause showing, a finding clearly required before a warrant may be\r\n  issued.Â  The State bore the burden of proving the validity of the warrant and,\r\n  in my view, while the absence of a magistrateâ€™s signature may be a factor in\r\n  determining whether the warrant was issued upon probable cause, it is not\r\n  dispositive of the determination.Â  However, by failing to call the magistrate\r\n  to testify that she issued the warrant upon finding probable cause, the State\r\n  failed to present any evidence to show the warrant was valid and therefore did\r\n  not carry its burden.Â  See Sachs, 264 S.C. at 555, 216 S.E.2d at 508 (recognizing\r\n  that â€œall that is necessary to justify the issuance of a warrant is probable\r\n  causeâ€); see also U.S. Const. amend. IV and S.C. Const. art. I\r\n  (mandating that a warrant must be supported by probable cause). Â \r\nFor these reasons, I would hold that the good faith exception is applicable \r\nunder these circumstances, but that the State failed to carry its burden of \r\nproving the magistrate issued the warrant upon finding probable cause.&nbsp; \r\nAccordingly, I concur with the majorityâ€™s decision to affirm as modified the \r\ncourt of appealsâ€™ opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The facts are fully reported in that opinion, and the verdict form is\r\n  reproduced in Judge Andersonâ€™s concurring opinion.\r\n[2] See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-13-150 (2003) (copy of warrant and affidavit\r\n  shall be furnished to person served)\r\n[3] Specifically, the Davis Court found that the lower court properly\r\n  charged the jury that â€œa warrant need not be under seal, yet it must be in\r\n  writing, and signed by the officer issuing.â€Â  Id. at 509, 19 S.E. at\r\n  139.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26633","title":"Battle v.

To the\r\n  extent that the State relies on circumstantial evidence, it must prove all the\r\n  circumstances relied on beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  These circumstances must in\r\n  every way perfectly be consistent with one another; and they must point\r\n  conclusively, that is, to a moral certainty, to the guilt of the accused to the\r\n  exclusion of every other reasonable hypothesis or explanation.[2]Â  In other words, the circumstances\r\n  must be absolutely inconsistent with any other reasonable hypothesis or\r\n  explanation than the guilt of the accused.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nShortly\r\n  after the jury began deliberating, the foreman sent a note requesting a\r\n  transcript of the jury charges.Â  The trial court refused, but told the jury it\r\n  would recharge portions of the instructions.Â  The foreman then asked, â€œThere\r\n  was a portion about reasonable person.Â  Could there be another scenario\r\n  possible: Would a reasonable person consider that something else happened\r\n  instead of whatâ€™s claimed by the prosecution?â€Â  The trial court responded:\r\n\r\n\tOkay.Â  Iâ€™m not sure if what youâ€™re asking about was what I\r\n  discussed or mentioned when I was talking about two types of evidence, the two\r\n  ways that we classify evidence . . . As I said, there are two types of evidence\r\n  from which a jury may properly find the truth as to the facts of a case.Â  One\r\n  is direct evidence, such as testimony of a witness.Â  The other is indirect or\r\n  circumstantial evidence, the proof of a chain of circumstances pointing to the\r\n  existence or nonexistence of certain facts; thatâ€™s what weâ€™re talking about\r\n  when I talk about circumstantial evidence.Â  \r\n\t. . . \r\n\tYou can have proof of circumstances that\r\n  lead to that conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt, as Iâ€™ve defined that for\r\n  you.\r\n\tSo thatâ€™s what Iâ€™m talking about when Iâ€™m\r\n  talking about circumstantial evidence.Â  But the circumstances proved by the\r\n  State must be complete.Â  They must lead to that conclusion beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt.\r\n\tAnd in the evaluation of circumstantial\r\n  evidence, you must search for, consider, any other reasonable hypothesis or\r\n  explanation than that which the State advances and the claim made by the\r\n  State.Â  You have to examine every other reasonable hypothesis or explanation\r\n  other than the guilt of the accused when considering circumstantial evidence.Â  \r\n\t\r\n\tThatâ€™s the essence, I think, of my\r\n  instructions to you on circumstantial evidence.Â  Itâ€™s not necessary to prove\r\n  every fact that the State has to prove in order to be entitled to a verdict of\r\n  guilty by direct evidence.Â  They can prove it by circumstantial evidence, but\r\n  it must be a complete chain; that is, all the circumstances that the State\r\n  relies on, other than direct testimony, all the circumstances that the State\r\n  relies on to establish an element, some part thatâ€™s necessary to prove the\r\n  defendant guilty, some part of the crime that he is accused of committing, they\r\n  must establish all those circumstances, as I said beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\n\tAnd in consideration of that, itâ€™s your\r\n  duty to examine any other reasonable hypothesis or explanation than the guilt\r\n  of the accused.Â  And if there is another reasonable explanation for the\r\n  circumstance, then you cannot rely on that circumstance in finding the\r\n  defendant guilty.\r\n\r\nTrial\r\n  counsel did not object to any portion of the charges.Â  The jury returned a\r\n  guilty verdict, and the court of appeals affirmed.Â  State v. Battle, Op. No. 2003-UP-348 (S.C. Ct. App. filed May 20, 2003).Â  \r\nRespondent\r\n  filed an application for PCR and alleged that trial counsel was ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the portion of the jury charges on reasonable doubt and\r\n  circumstantial evidence.Â  Although the PCR court found that the first portion\r\n  of the reasonable doubt charge was constitutional, it found that other portions\r\n  of the charges were improper.Â  Specifically, the PCR court expressed concern\r\n  over the trial courtâ€™s use of the â€œmoral certaintyâ€ language and the portion of\r\n  the charge requiring the jury to â€œsearch forâ€ or â€œseekâ€ a reasonable\r\n  explanation other than Respondentâ€™s guilt.Â  Accordingly, the PCR court ruled\r\n  that, viewed in its totality, the charge diluted the Stateâ€™s burden to prove\r\n  Respondent guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.\r\nWe\r\n  granted the Stateâ€™s request for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR courtâ€™s\r\n  order granting relief to review the following issue:\r\n\r\n\tDid the PCR court err in finding trial counsel ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the jury charges?\r\n\r\nStandard\r\n  of Review\r\nÂ The burden of proof is on the applicant in post-conviction\r\n  proceedings to prove the allegations in his application.Â  Butler v. State, 286\r\n  S.C. 441, 442, 334 S.E.2d 813, 814 (1985).Â  On certiorari, the PCR courtâ€™s ruling should be upheld if\r\n  it is supported by any evidence of probative value in the record.Â  Cherry v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119,\r\n  386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989).\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThe\r\n  State argues that the PCR court erred in finding trial counsel ineffective for\r\n  failing to object to the jury charges.Â  We agree.\r\nIn\r\n  order to prove counsel was ineffective, a PCR applicant must show that\r\n  counselâ€™s performance was deficient and that he suffered resulting prejudice.Â  Strickland\r\n    v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984).Â  Â Â In determining whether a\r\n  defendant was prejudiced by improper jury instructions, the court must find\r\n  that, viewing the charge in its entirety and not in isolation, there is a\r\n  reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the improper instruction in way\r\n  that violates the Constitution.Â  Todd v. State, 355 S.C. 396, 399, 585\r\n  S.E.2d 305, 306 (2003).Â  \r\n\r\nTrial\r\n  courts should avoid using â€œseekâ€ language in instructing the jury because such\r\n  language is unnecessary and runs the risk of unconstitutionally shifting the\r\n  burden of proof.Â  State v. Needs, 333 S.C. 134, 155, 508 S.E.2d 857, 867-68 (1998).Â \r\n  Additionally, â€œmoral certaintyâ€ language, although not per se reversible\r\n  error, is disfavored.Â  See State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119,\r\n  131, 410 S.E.2d 547, 554 (1991) (recognizing that courts have affirmed\r\n  convictions where the trial court did not use â€œmoral certaintyâ€ language in\r\n  conjunction with â€œsubstantialâ€ or â€œgraveâ€ doubt in defining reasonable doubt).\r\nIn our view, there is not a\r\n  reasonable likelihood that the jury applied the trial courtâ€™s instruction in a\r\n  way that violated the Constitution.Â  The trial court repeatedly emphasized that\r\n  the State retained the burden to prove Respondentâ€™s guilt beyond a reasonable\r\n  doubt in its initial instruction.Â  The trial court mentioned â€œmoral certaintyâ€ in explaining\r\n  circumstantial evidence, but he also stated that the circumstances must point â€œconclusivelyâ€\r\n  to the defendantâ€™s guilt, and that guilt must be shown to the exclusion of\r\n  every other reasonable hypothesis.Â  See Todd, 355 S.C. at 403, 585\r\n  S.E.2d at 309 (upholding a similar charge and recognizing that the â€œâ€˜moral\r\n  certaintyâ€™ language cannot be sequestered from its surroundingsâ€).Â  While we\r\n  recognize that the trial court employed the â€œsearch forâ€ language in a\r\n  supplemental instruction,[3] the court used â€œsearch forâ€ only one time and\r\n  emphasized that the State retained the burden to prove Respondentâ€™s guilt\r\n  beyond a reasonable doubt.Â  Therefore, we find that this language did not shift\r\n  the burden to Respondent to put forth a reasonable hypothesis which would\r\n  exculpate him.Â  Finally, we believe that any portion of the charge reflecting\r\n  an Edwards instruction favored Respondent.Â  Accordingly, we hold that when\r\n  read as a whole, in its entirety, the jury instructions did not violate\r\n  Respondentâ€™s due process rights.\r\n\r\nConclusion\r\nFor these reasons, we reverse the PCR courtâ€™s order\r\n  granting Respondent relief.Â  \r\nWALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Floyd, Nelson, and Respondent are all cousins.\r\n[2] This portion of the charge reflects the traditional\r\n  circumstantial evidence charge as articulated in State v. Edwards, which\r\n  provides that when the State relies upon circumstantial evidence to prove its\r\n  case, the jury may not convict the defendant unless:\r\n\r\n\tEvery\r\n  circumstance relied upon by the State be proven beyond a reasonable doubt; and\r\n  . . . all of the circumstances so proven be consistent with each other and\r\n  taken together, point conclusively to the guilt of the accused to the exclusion\r\n  of every other reasonable hypothesis.\r\n\r\n298 S.C. 272, 275, 379\r\n  S.E.2d 888, 889 (1989)\r\n  (citing State v.\r\n    Littlejohn, 228 S.C. 324, 89 S.E.2d\r\n  924, 926 (1955)).Â  At the time this case was tried, although the Edwards circumstantial evidence charge was acceptable, the Court recommended a\r\n  different circumstantial evidence charge.Â  See State v.\r\n    Grippon, 327 S.C. 79, 489 S.E.2d 462 (1997).Â  However, in 2004, a majority\r\n  of the Court held that the Grippon charge was the sole and exclusive\r\n  charge to be given in circumstantial evidence cases.Â  State v. Cherry, 361\r\n  S.C. 588, 606 S.E.2d 475 (2004) (Toal, C.J., dissenting).\r\n[3] See Lowry v. State, 376 S.C. 499, 507, 657 S.E.2d 760, 754 (2008) (finding the\r\n  fact that the improper charge occurred in a supplemental instruction relevant\r\n  to the analysis due to the prominence of the charge).Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendment to Rule 402(d)(1), SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2009-04-10-01","description":"Pursuant to Article V, Â§ 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, Rule 402(d)(1), SCACR, is amended.","date":"2009-04-13","type":"order","text":"\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nIn re: Amendment to Rule 402(d)(1), SCACR\r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Article V, &sect; 4, of the South Carolina Constitution, Rule 402(d)(1), SCACR, is amended.

Tex Davis Jr., Senior Assistant Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tIrby E.\r\n  Walker, Jr., of Conway, for respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel\r\n  (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent\r\n  pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits\r\n  misconduct and agrees to either the imposition of an admonition or public\r\n  reprimand.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts,\r\n  as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nOn or about October 26, 2006, Complainant\r\n  retained respondent to represent him in a divorce action.Â  Respondent admits\r\n  that, between October 2006 and October 2007, there were periods of time when he\r\n  did not return Complainantâ€™s telephone calls. Â He further admits that he failed\r\n  to act diligently in connection with the handling of Complainantâ€™s domestic\r\n  action.Â  \r\nOn October 5, 2007, respondent\r\n  informed Complainant via e-mail that he had spoken with the family court judge\r\n  who had indicated she would sign an order approving service by publication and\r\n  that the documents would be sent out the following week.Â  This information to\r\n  Complainant was premature as respondent had not presented an order to the\r\n  family court judge. \r\nOn December 13, 2007, Complainant\r\n  sent respondent an e-mail stating that it had been over a year since respondent\r\n  had been retained.Â  Complainant inquired whether the divorce had been\r\n  finalized. Â Respondent replied via e-mail that â€œ[t]he Judge has signed the\r\n  order approving publication and we are in the process of serving her by\r\n  publication.â€Â  This statement was a fabrication as no order of publication had\r\n  been signed.Â  \r\nOn or about February 15, 2008,\r\n  respondent received notice from the Clerk of Court that Complainantâ€™s case had\r\n  been pending for 365 days and was subject to dismissal.Â  Respondent failed to\r\n  inform Complainant of this development.Â  Instead, when Complainant e-mailed\r\n  respondent on March 12, 2008 expressing frustration with the progress of the\r\n  case, respondent responded by repeating his earlier misrepresentation about the\r\n  status of the case.Â  Respondent stated, â€œâ€¦the judge has approved the service by\r\n  publication.â€Â  Respondent knew that this statement was completely false.Â  \r\nOn March 17, 2008, respondent\r\n  requested a status conference with the family court judge to discuss\r\n  Complainantâ€™s case and to obtain permission to serve the defendant by\r\n  publication.Â  This request was denied.Â  \r\nOn March 18, 2008, respondent sent\r\n  an e-mail to the family court judge stating that Complainantâ€™s case had\r\n  â€œslipped through the cracks on me.â€Â  Respondent requested additional time to\r\n  serve the defendant by publication.Â  \r\nOn March 19, 2008, respondent\r\n  received a written response from the family court judge denying the request for\r\n  service by publication and giving respondent thirty (30) days to effect service\r\n  or the matter would be dismissed.Â  Respondent did not inform Complainant about\r\n  this development.\r\nOn April 21, 2008, respondent\r\n  received notice that Complainantâ€™s case had been dismissed.Â  Respondent failed\r\n  to inform Complainant of the dismissal.Â  Complainant did not learn of the\r\n  dismissal until May 9, 2008 when he went to the Clerk of Courtâ€™s office seeking\r\n  information on the status of his case.\r\nRespondent has been cooperative\r\n  with ODC throughout this investigation. \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by his misconduct\r\n  he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR,\r\n  particularly Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing client), Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client\r\n  reasonably informed about status of matter and promptly comply with reasonable\r\n  requests for information), Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to\r\n  expedite litigation consistent with interests of client), and Rule 8.4 (it is\r\n  professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in conduct involving dishonesty,\r\n  fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).Â  Respondent acknowledges that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer\r\n  Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall\r\n  be ground for discipline for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, BEATTY\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26636","title":"In the Matter of Michael James Sarratt","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26636","description":"This is an opinion definitely suspending a lawyer.","date":"2009-04-20","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      <!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN\"\r\n   \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- meta anti cache-->\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--\r\nbody{\r\nfont-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;\r\n}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Michael James Sarratt, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No.Â  26636\r\nSubmitted March 9, 2009 - Filed April 20, 2009Â  \r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex Davis Jr., Senior Assistant Deputy Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel. \r\n\t\t\t\tPeter D.\r\n  Protopapas of Lewis &amp; Babcock, LLP, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER\r\n  CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary\r\n  matter, respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered\r\n  into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â  In the Agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to a\r\n  public reprimand or the imposition of a definite suspension not to exceed four\r\n  (4) months.Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a four (4) month suspension\r\n  from the practice of law.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request to impose the\r\n  suspension retroactive to September 12, 2008, the date of respondentâ€™s interim\r\n  suspension.Â  In the Matter of Sarratt, 379 S.C. 607, 667 S.E.2d 266\r\n  (2008).Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nOn March 11, 2008, while traveling on\r\n  I-85 North and I-26 West, respondent was stopped by the Spartanburg County\r\n  Sheriffâ€™s Department.Â  According to the incident report filed by the Sheriffâ€™s\r\n  Department, respondent was stopped for driving 140 mph in a 70 mph zone.Â \r\n  Respondent was placed under arrest for reckless driving and issued a citation.Â \r\n  On September 25, 2008, respondent pled guilty to speeding 94 mph in a 70 mph\r\n  zone and the reckless driving charge was marked nolle prosequi.\r\nMatter II\r\nOn September 21, 2007, respondent took\r\n  his dog to a veterinary clinic for treatment.Â  Later the same day, respondent\r\n  called the clinic to speak with the veterinarian.Â  The office manager informed\r\n  respondent that the veterinarian was with a customer and unable to take his\r\n  telephone call.Â  According to the office manager, respondent used vile and\r\n  profane language during the conversation.Â  The office manager filed an incident\r\n  report with the police department and, as a result, respondent was charged with\r\n  unlawful use of a telephone.Â Â  \r\nOn November 19, 2008, respondentâ€™s case\r\n  was heard before a Spartanburg Magistrate.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel moved to\r\n  dismiss the charge arguing that an unlawful use of telephone charge required\r\n  that the telephone call be made with the intent and sole purpose of conveying\r\n  an unsolicited obscene or imminently threatening message or to harass the\r\n  recipient.Â  Respondentâ€™s counsel asserted the purpose of respondentâ€™s telephone\r\n  call to the veterinary clinic was neither unsolicited nor made for the sole\r\n  purpose of harassing or threatening the office manager.Â  The magistrate\r\n  dismissed the charge against respondent.Â  \r\nRespondent admits he used some\r\n  inappropriate language during his telephone conversation with the office\r\n  manager.Â  He represents that, at the time of the incident, he was very emotional\r\n  due to the condition of his pet.Â  Respondent apologizes for his conduct.Â  \r\nMatter III\r\nOn July 11, 2008, respondent was\r\n  driving a vehicle belonging to his girlfriend on Highway 74 in Polk County, North Carolina.Â  Respondentâ€™s girlfriend was a passenger in the vehicle.Â  An\r\n  officer with the Polk County Sheriffâ€™s Department stopped respondent.Â  During a\r\n  search, police discovered marijuana and drug paraphernalia on respondentâ€™s\r\n  girlfriend.Â  The police questioned respondent and his girlfriend.Â  According to\r\n  respondentâ€™s counsel, respondent â€œoffered to take the charges as a matter of\r\n  consideration for [his girlfriend].â€Â  Respondent was issued a citation charging\r\n  him with possession of less than Â½ ounce of marijuana and knowingly possessing\r\n  with intent to use drug paraphernalia.Â  \r\nOn November 5, 2008, the drug charges\r\n  against respondent were brought to trial.Â  After the district attorney\r\n  presented its case, the trial court granted respondentâ€™s motion to dismiss the\r\n  charges.Â  \r\nRespondent represents that the\r\n  marijuana and drug paraphernalia found by the Polk County Sheriffâ€™s Department\r\n  did not belong to him; however, in hindsight, he now admits that certain\r\n  statements made during the traffic stop may have misled the police into\r\n  believing that respondent was admitting that the marijuana and drug paraphernalia\r\n  belonged to respondent.Â  Respondent now understands that, as an officer of the\r\n  court, he has an obligation to ensure he is careful in all communications to\r\n  avoid any misleading statements.Â  \r\nMatter IV\r\nDuring its investigation of the marijuana\r\n  and drug paraphernalia charges, ODC learned that, on January 20, 2008,\r\n  respondent had been charged with speeding in Rutherford County, North\r\n  Carolina.Â  According to respondentâ€™s counsel, due to unique procedural rules in\r\n  North Carolina, respondent had to plead guilty in District Court and appeal\r\n  the matter to Superior Court in order to obtain a jury trial.Â  After a jury\r\n  trial on October 6, 2008, respondent was convicted of speeding 93 mph in a 65\r\n  mph zone.Â  Respondent was ordered to pay a $100 fine and $254.50 in court\r\n  costs, and was placed on unsupervised probation for one year.Â  \r\nMatter V\r\nOn October 5, 2008, respondent was\r\n  charged with speeding 92 mph in a 70 mph zone in Columbia County, Florida.Â  He completed a driver improvement course.Â  Accordingly, under Florida law,\r\n  adjudication of the ticket has been held in indefinite abeyance.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that\r\n  his misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct\r\n  of lawyers) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  engage in conduct tending to bring the legal profession into disrepute or\r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).Â  In addition, respondent\r\n  admits he has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Â Rule 8.4(a)\r\n    (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n    Conduct) and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engage in\r\n    conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation). Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a four (4) month suspension from\r\n  the practice of law.Â  We deny respondentâ€™s request to impose the suspension\r\n  retroactive to the date of his interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days\r\n  of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk\r\n  of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BEATTY and\r\n  KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.

Grice, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  opinion in Taylor v. SC Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles, 368 S.C. 33, 627 S.E.2d\r\n  751 (Ct. App. 2006).Â  We affirm.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nPetitioner, Suchart Taylor, was involved in an automobile\r\n  collision on I-26 in Berkeley County.Â  A police officer arrived on the scene to\r\n  find Taylor in his pickup truck being treated by paramedics.Â  The officer\r\n  smelled alcohol inside the vehicle and, when he attempted to speak with him, Taylor seemed disoriented and had heavy mouth injuries; he was unable to stand or perform\r\n  field sobriety tests.\r\nTaylor was\r\n  taken to the emergency room, where he was advised of his Miranda rights and\r\n  arrested for DUI.Â  The officer determined Taylorâ€™s mouth injuries would prevent\r\n  him from taking a breath test, so he requested a blood sample.Â  The officer\r\n  read the implied consent form aloud to Taylor, but did not provide him with a\r\n  written copy of the form.Â  Taylor refused the blood sample and refused to sign\r\n  the implied consent form; he was therefore issued a notice that his driverâ€™s\r\n  license would be suspended for ninety days.Â  \r\nTaylor filed\r\n  for an administrative hearing to challenge the license suspension.Â  The hearing\r\n  officer upheld the suspension.Â  Taylor petitioned for judicial review\r\n  contending the license suspension was invalid because he had not been provided\r\n  with a written copy of the implied consent law, as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2951 (2006).Â  The trial court agreed and reversed the license suspension.Â \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed the trial courtâ€™s ruling; it held Taylor was not prejudiced by the lack of a written copy of the implied consent form\r\n  because he was read those rights aloud.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of Appeals properly hold that Taylor was not\r\n  prejudiced by the lack of written notice of the implied consent law?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe Implied Consent Statute, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a) (2006),\r\n  provides that a person who drives a motor vehicle in South Carolina is\r\n  considered to have given consent to chemical tests of his breath, blood, or\r\n  urine to determine whether the person was driving a motor vehicle while under\r\n  the influence of alcohol, drugs, or a combination of alcohol and drugs.Â  The\r\n  statute provides, in pertinent part: \r\n\r\n\tNo tests may be administered or samples obtained unless\r\n  the person has been informed in writing that: \r\n\t(1) he does not have to take the test or give the samples, but\r\n  that his privilege to drive must be suspended or denied for at least ninety\r\n  days if he refuses to submit to the tests and that his refusal may be used\r\n  against him in court; \r\n\t(2) his privilege to drive must be suspended for at least thirty\r\n  days if he takes the tests or gives the samples and has an alcohol\r\n  concentration of fifteen one hundredths of one percent or more; \r\n\t(3) he has the right to have a qualified person of his own\r\n  choosing conduct additional independent tests at his expense; \r\n\t(4) he has the right to request an administrative hearing within\r\n  thirty days of the issuance of the notice of suspension; and \r\n\t(5) if he does not request an administrative hearing or if his\r\n  suspension is upheld at the administrative hearing, he must enroll in an\r\n  Alcohol and Drug Safety Action Program.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  56-5-2950(a).Â  (Emphasis supplied).Â  Subsection 56-5-2950(e) provides that the\r\n  failure to follow policies or procedures set forth in Â§ 56-5-2950 will result\r\n  in the exclusion from evidence of any tests results, â€œif the trial judge or\r\n  hearing officer finds that such failure materially affected the accuracy or\r\n  reliability of the tests results or the fairness of the testing procedure.â€Â  Notably,\r\n  neither section (a) nor section (e) addresses the issue of license suspension\r\n  for the failure to comply with the procedures set forth therein.Â  \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(a), governs the Department of Motor\r\n  Vehicleâ€™s (DMV) suspension of a driverâ€™s license for refusing to submit to a\r\n  test or for certain levels of alcohol concentration.Â  The statute states that\r\n  the DMV â€œshall suspend the driverâ€™s license . . . of . . . a person who drives\r\n  a motor vehicle and refuses to submit to a test provided for in Section\r\n  56-5-2950;â€ the statute gives an offender thirty days in which to request an\r\n  administrative hearing.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951 (B) (2).Â  The hearing must\r\n  be held within thirty days and is limited to a determination of whether the\r\n  person:\r\n\r\n\t(1) was lawfully arrested or detained; \r\n\t(2) was advised in writing of the rights enumerated in Section\r\n  56-5-2950; \r\n\t(3) refused to submit to a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950; or \r\n\t(4) consented to taking a test pursuant to Section 56-5-2950 (and\r\n  several conditions relating to administration of the test). \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2951(F) (1-4). Â We find nothing in section\r\n  56-5-2951 which mandates re-issuance of the driverâ€™s license if one, or all of\r\n  the Â above factors is not met.Â  If the Legislature had intended the lack of\r\n  written notice (or any other factor) to be a fatal defect, it could have said\r\n  so in the statute.Â  Giannini v. SC Depâ€™t of Transportation, 378 S.C.\r\n  573, 664 S.E.2d 450 (2008) (if Legislature had intended certain result in a\r\n  statute it would have said so).Â  Accord S.C. Depâ€™t of Motor Vehicles\r\n    v. Nelson, 364 S.C. 514, 523, 613 S.E2d 544, 549 (Ct. App. 2005) (requirements\r\n  for suspension for refusal to consent do not include written notice of implied\r\n  consent statute).\r\nWe hold the criterion in Â§ 56-5-2951(f) are simply factors which\r\n  the DMV may consider in determining whether to uphold a suspension, i.e., a\r\n  prejudice analysis.Â  Given that nothing in Â§ 56-5-2951 provides for mandatory\r\n  re-issuance of a driverâ€™s license upon review of these factors, we find an\r\n  examination of the four factors with an eye toward prejudice is the proper\r\n  inquiry.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appeals properly applied a prejudice\r\n  analysis.Â Â  Given that it is undisputed Taylor was advised of the implied\r\n  consent warning, the Court of Appeals properly found he suffered no prejudice\r\n  from the officerâ€™s lack of written notice.Â  Accordingly, the Court of Appealsâ€™\r\n  opinion is affirmed.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., and Acting Justice Billy A. Tunstall, concur. BEATTY,\r\n  J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:Â Â Â  I respectfully dissent.Â \r\n  Section 56-5-2950(a) of the South Carolina Code specifically states no tests\r\n  may be administered or samples obtained unless the person has been informed in\r\n  writing of certain provisions of the section.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2950(a).Â \r\n  It is undisputed that Taylor was not â€œinformed in writing.â€Â  In my view, the\r\n  Department of Motor Vehicles cannot suspend a driverâ€™s license because driver\r\n  refused to take a test that the law enforcement officer was not authorized to\r\n  administer.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Legislature specifically set forth a pre-condition that must be\r\n  met before any tests may be administered.Â  Section 56-5-2950 is unambiguous and\r\n  its meaning and intent are clear.Â  The Court may not simply ignore it.Â  I would\r\n  reverse the decision of the Court of Appeals.\r\nPLEICONES,\r\n  J., concurs.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26638","title":"Home Medical Systems v.

(Taxpayer).Â  We reverse.Â  \r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL\r\n  HISTORY\r\nTaxpayer is a retailer of durable medical equipment, medical\r\n  supplies, and other medical products.Â  At issue in the instant case is whether\r\n  the following categories of products are exempt from sales tax:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1.&nbsp; \r\n\t\t\t Continuous Positive\r\n  Airway Pressure (CPAP) and Bi-level Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) devices.Â  These medical devices are approved by the\r\n  federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Â  The CPAP provides positive air\r\n  pressure to patients who suffer from a variety of diseases including sleep\r\n  apnea and acute respiratory failure.Â  The BiPAP provides differing pressure\r\n  during inhalation to patients who suffer from sleep apnea and acute respiratory\r\n  failure.Â  Both devices are used to provide a patient with proper breathing and\r\n  require a physicianâ€™s prescription.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2. \r\n\t\t\t Ventilator devices.Â  The ventilator is used by a patient to\r\n  assist in breathing and is normally connected to the patient through a\r\n  tracheotomy tube.Â  In its simplest form, a ventilator consists ofÂ  a\r\n  compressible reservoir, an oxygen air mixture, and a compressor.Â  \r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3.\r\n\t\t\t Nasal Intermittent\r\n  Positive Pressure Ventilation (NIPPV) devices.Â  This is used by a patient to assist in\r\n  breathing and is normally connected to the patient through the nasal cavity.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4. \r\n\t\t\t Nebulizer devices.Â  A nebulizer is a specialized air\r\n  compressor.Â  The compressor forces pressurized air into a breathing cup into\r\n  which medication is drawn.Â  The nebulizerâ€™s pressure mixes with the medication\r\n  to ease the introduction of the medication into the patientâ€™s lungs.Â  The\r\n  nebulizer does not force the medication into the lungs, but rather vaporizes\r\n  the medication so the medication is effectively inhaled.Â  This device is used\r\n  to treat bronchiospasms and other respiratory diseases.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5.\r\n\t\t\t Enteral Nutritional\r\n  formulas.Â  These are\r\n  prescribed for patients who, due to an illness or disease, are unable to\r\n  consume food products orally.Â  The formula prescribed is selected by the\r\n  physician based on the caloric and metabolic needs of the individual patient.Â \r\n  The formulas may include specific nutrients to treat specific metabolic\r\n  disorders such as sodium imbalances and protein needs.Â  Enteral formulas are typically\r\n  administered by:Â  (1) a gravity feed bag and tubing connected to a feeding tube\r\n  inserted in the patient, or (2) an electronic pump which also requires bags and\r\n  tubing and connects to a feeding tube or catheter inserted in the patient.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nTaxpayer sold the above items to customers who had a Certificate\r\n  of Medical Necessity (CMN).Â  A CMN is a standard form used by Medicare and\r\n  Medicaid; it is signed by a physician and details the customerâ€™s diagnosis and\r\n  medical necessity for the item.\r\nAfter an audit by the DOR, Taxpayer was assessed sales taxes on\r\n  retail sales of the above-listed medical devices and products.[1]Â  The DORâ€™s Final Agency Determination\r\n  ruled there was no tax exemption because:Â  (1) the items listed in categories\r\n  1-4 above are not â€œprosthetic devicesâ€ since they do not replace a body part;\r\n  and (2) the enteral nutritional formulas (category 5) were not actually sold\r\n  pursuant to a prescription, and do not require a prescription to be sold.\r\nTaxpayer asserted the sales were exempt from sales tax and filed\r\n  for a contested case hearing.Â  After discovery, the parties filed cross-motions\r\n  for summary judgment.[2]Â \r\n  Following a hearing on the motions, the ALC granted summary judgment in favor\r\n  of Taxpayer.Â  \r\nThe DOR filed a motion for reconsideration with the ALC, which was\r\n  denied, and thereafter filed a Notice of Appeal.Â  Taxpayer filed a motion to\r\n  dismiss the appeal based on failure to timely serve the Notice of Appeal.Â  This\r\n  Court certified the case for review pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR, and\r\n  deferred ruling on the motion to dismiss until after full briefing on the issue\r\n  and oral argument.Â Â Â Â  \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n\t1.&nbsp; Did the DOR timely\r\n  serve the Notice of Appeal? \r\n\t2.&nbsp; Did the ALC err by\r\n  finding that the sales tax exemption applies to all items and granting summary\r\n  judgment in favor of Taxpayer?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n1.Â  Timeliness\r\n  of Notice of Appeal\r\nTaxpayer argues we should dismiss the instant appeal because the\r\n  DOR failed to timely serve the Notice of Appeal.Â  This raises a novel issue\r\n  regarding the intersection of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and\r\n  the ALC Rules.\r\nThe ALCâ€™s summary judgment order was dated August 28, 2007, and\r\n  the DOR received the order on August 30, 2007.Â  On September 10, 2007, the DOR\r\n  filed a â€œMotion for Reconsideration and to Alter or Amend Judgment Pursuant to\r\n  ALC Rule 29(D), ALC Rule 68, and Rule 59(e), SCRCPâ€ (Post-Order Motion).Â  The\r\n  ALC denied the Post-Order Motion on October 1, 2007.Â  The DOR then served the\r\n  Notice of Appeal on October 9, 2007.\r\nTaxpayer contends that under the ALC rules, the DORâ€™s Post-Order\r\n  Motion was improper because ALC Rule 68 does not permit a Rule 59(e), SCRCP,\r\n  motion.Â  Therefore, according to Taxpayer, the Post-Order Motion did not toll\r\n  the time period for serving the Notice of Appeal.[3]Â  Stated differently, Taxpayer argues\r\n  Rule 59(e), SCRCP, does not apply to ALC actions.Â   Â \r\nThe ALC\r\n  rules contemplate a â€œmotion for reconsiderationâ€ under ALC Rule 29(D):\r\nMotion\r\n  for Reconsideration. Any party may move for reconsideration of a final\r\n  decision of an administrative law judge in a contested case, subject to the\r\n    grounds for relief set forth in Rule 60(B) (1 through 5), SCRCP, as\r\n  follows: \r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  Within ten (10) days after notice of the order concluding the matter before the\r\n  administrative law judge, a party may move for reconsideration of the decision,\r\n  provided that a petition for judicial review has not been filed. \r\n\t(2) The\r\n  administrative law judge shall act on the motion for rehearing within thirty\r\n  (30) days after it is filed, and if no action is taken by the administrative\r\n  law judge within that period, the inaction shall be deemed a denial of the relief\r\n  sought in the motion.\r\n\t(3) The\r\n  filing of a motion for reconsideration shall not, of itself, stay the order of\r\n  the administrative law judge or excuse or delay compliance with the order of\r\n  the administrative law judge. \r\n\t(4) The\r\n  time for appeal for all parties shall be stayed by a timely motion for\r\n  reconsideration, and shall run from receipt of an order granting or denying\r\n  such motion, or if no order is filed regarding the motion, thirty (30) days\r\n  after notice that the motion was filed. \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  filing of a motion for reconsideration is not a prerequisite to filing a notice\r\n  of appeal from a final decision of an administrative law judge. \r\n(Emphasis added).\r\nTaxpayer maintains that because ALC Rule 29(D) only allows a\r\n  motion for reconsideration when there are grounds for relief under Rule 60(b),\r\n  SCRCP,[4] a motion to alter or amend the judgment pursuant to Rule 59(e), SCRCP, is not\r\n  permitted in an ALC case.Â  The DOR, on the other hand, argues the ALC rules\r\n  specifically allow the Rules of Civil Procedure to apply.Â  ALC Rule 68 provides\r\n  as follows:Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\n\tThe South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure and the South Carolina\r\n  Appellate Court Rules may, where practicable, be applied in proceedings before\r\n  the Court to resolve questions not addressed by these rules.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added).Â  The DOR points out there is no ALC rule akin to Rule 59(e), SCRCP,[5] and thus, ALC Rule 68 authorizes a\r\n  Rule 59(e) motion. Â Moreover, the DOR contends that because issue preservation\r\n  rules apply to an appeal from an ALC action, there is a need for a Rule 59(e) type motion.Â  We agree with the DORâ€™s\r\n  position.\r\nAlthough a Rule 59(e) motion may effectively seek a\r\n  reconsideration of issues and arguments, this type of motion is often required for issue preservation purposes. Â See Elam v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Transp., 361 S.C. 9, 602 S.E.2d 772&nbsp;(2004).Â  We explained in Elam that â€œthere is nothing inherently unfair in allowing a party one\r\n  final chance not only to call the courtâ€™s attention to a possible\r\n  misapprehension of an earlier argument, but also to revisit a previously raised\r\n  argument.â€Â  Id. at 22, 602 S.E.2d at 779. Indeed, â€œit is inherently\r\n  unfair to disallow such an opportunity.â€Â  Id. \r\nThe Elam Court further stated that a â€œparty must file [a Rule 59(e), SCRCP] motion\r\n  when an issue or argument has been raised, but not ruled on, in order to\r\n  preserve it for appellate review.â€Â  Id. at 24, 602 S.E.2d at 780.Â  In Iâ€™On,\r\n    L.L.C. v. Town of Mt. Pleasant, 338 S.C. 406, 422, 526 S.E.2d 716,\r\n  724&nbsp;(2000), we discussed the policy underlying this rule:\r\n\r\n\tIf the\r\n  losing party has raised an issue in the lower court, but the court fails to\r\n  rule upon it, the party must file a motion to alter or amend the\r\n  judgment in order to preserve the issue for appellate review. Â Imposing this\r\n  preservation requirement on the appellant is meant to enable the lower court to\r\n  rule properly after it has considered all relevant facts, law, and\r\n  arguments.\r\n\r\n(Emphasis\r\n  added, citations omitted).\r\nPut simply, Rule 59(e) motions serve a vital purpose for proper\r\n  issue preservation.Â  As in other appellate matters, we require issue\r\n  preservation in administrative appeals.Â  See, e.g., Brown v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Health and Envtl.\r\n    Control, 348 S.C. 507, 519, 560\r\n  S.E.2d 410, 417&nbsp;(2002) (issues not raised\r\n  to and ruled upon by the ALC are unpreserved for appellate review); Carson\r\n    v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Res.,&nbsp;371 S.C. 114, 120, 638 S.E.2d\r\n  45, 48&nbsp;(2002) (court sitting in appellate capacity may not consider issues\r\n  not raised or ruled on by administrative agency); Kiawah Resort Assoc. v. South Carolina Tax Commâ€™n, 318 S.C. 502, 458 S.E.2d 542 (1995) (same).Â  We therefore\r\n  hold Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions are permitted in ALC proceedings.Â  Accordingly,\r\n  the DORâ€™s Post-Order Motion tolled the time period for filing an appeal, and\r\n  the Notice of Appeal was timely served.Â  We deny Taxpayerâ€™s motion to dismiss.\r\n2.Â  Application of the\r\n  Sales Tax Exemption\r\nThe\r\n  DOR argues the ALC erred in finding Taxpayer is entitled to the sales exemption\r\n  for the above-categorized products.Â  \r\nState law sets the retail sales tax on tangible personal property\r\n  at five percent.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-910(A) (2000).Â  By statute,\r\n  however, there is a sales tax exemption for â€œmedicine and prosthetic devices sold by prescription.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120(28)(a) (2000\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2008).Â  \r\nâ€œTo\r\n  assist in the administration of this exemption,â€ the\r\n  DOR promulgated a regulation which defines both medicine and prosthetic\r\n  devices:\r\n\r\n\tâ€œMedicineâ€\r\n  - a substance or preparation used in treating disease.â€œProsthetic Deviceâ€ - an artificial device to replace a missing part of the\r\n  body.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Reg. Â§ 117-332\r\n  (Supp. 2008).Â  The regulation further provides as follows, in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n\r\n\tThe sale\r\n  of prescription lenses that replace a missing part of the eye are\r\n\texempted from the tax, as for example eyeglasses prescribed\r\n  for a person whose natural lenses have been surgically removed.Eyeglasses, contact lens, hearing aids and orthopedic appliances, such as braces,\r\n  wheelchairs and orthopedic custom-made shoes, do not come within the exemption\r\n  at Code Section 12-36-2120(28). \r\n\r\nId.\r\nIn a 2003 Revenue\r\n  Ruling, the DOR issued an advisory opinion on this exemption, and opined as\r\n  follows, in relevant part: \r\n\r\n\tMedicine\r\n  sold by prescription. In order for\r\n  this exemption to be applicable, the medicine must be of a type that requires a\r\n  prescription, the sale must require a prescription, and must actually be sold\r\n  by prescriptionâ€¦.\r\n\tProsthetic\r\n  devices sold by prescription. In order\r\n  for this exemption to be applicable, â€¦ the sale must require a prescription and\r\n  the device must actually be sold by prescription and the device must replace a\r\n  missing part of the body.&nbsp; A device that merely replaces a missing\r\n    function is not exempt.\r\n\r\nS.C. Rev. Rul. #03-02 (2003)\r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nDespite the DORâ€™s\r\n  long-standing construction of this exemption,[6] the ALC found that the departmentâ€™s policies had â€œcontorted the plain language\r\n  of the statute to severely limit the scope of the exemption.â€ Â The ALC stated\r\n  that â€œthe definition of prosthetic device has been updated as the field of\r\n  medicine has progressedâ€ and therefore found all of the devices at issue in the\r\n  instant case are prosthetic devices.Â  Furthermore, the ALC held that Regulation\r\n  117-332â€™s definition of â€œprosthetic deviceâ€ was inconsistent with â€œcurrent\r\n  medical definitions and as such should be rejected as contrary to the intent of\r\n  the General Assembly to provide an exemption for â€˜prosthetic devices sold by\r\n  prescription.â€™â€Â  \r\nThe\r\n  DOR argues the ALC erred in invalidating the agencyâ€™s definition of prosthetic\r\n  device and by improperly broadening the definition.Â  We agree.\r\nThe\r\n  language of a tax exemption statute must be given its plain, ordinary meaning\r\n  and must be strictly construed against the claimed exemption. Â TNS Mills,\r\n    Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, 331 S.C. 611, 620, 503 S.E.2d 471,\r\n  476&nbsp;(1998); see also Southeastern-Kusan, Inc. v. South\r\n    Carolina Tax Commâ€™n,&nbsp;276 S.C. 487, 489, 280 S.E.2d 57, 58&nbsp;(1981)\r\n  (â€œAs a general rule, tax exemption statutes are strictly construed against the\r\n  taxpayer.â€).Â  Moreover, â€œ[r]egulations authorized by the Legislature have the\r\n  force of law.â€Â  Goodman v. City of Columbia, 318 S.C. 488, 490, 458\r\n  S.E.2d 531, 532&nbsp;(1995).Â  Nonetheless, a regulation may not alter or add to\r\n  a statute. Id.\r\nThe sales tax exemption enumerated in section 12-36-2120(28)(a) is\r\n  for â€œmedicine and prosthetic devices sold by prescription.â€Â  Taxpayer\r\n  submitted a multitude of definitions for â€œprosthetic devicesâ€ and â€œprosthesisâ€\r\n  in support of its motion for summary judgment.Â  Based on our review of the\r\n  record, we agree with the DORâ€™s observation that many of these definitions have\r\n  as a primary definition one that is consistent with the regulatory definition,\r\n  e.g. â€œan artificial replacement of a body part.â€Â  Accordingly, we find\r\n  Regulation 117-332 reasonably defines â€œprosthetic devices.â€Â  \r\nMoreover,\r\n  while it is clear that one current, accepted definition in the medical\r\n  community is a broad one which encompasses not only a device to replace a\r\n  missing part of the body, but also a device to replace missing functionality,\r\n  we emphasize that simply because another definition exists does not mean the\r\n  ALC is empowered to invalidate an otherwise proper regulatory definition. Â See Drummond v. State, Depâ€™t of Revenue,&nbsp;378 S.C. 362, 370, 662 S.E.2d\r\n  587, 591&nbsp;(2008) (because the ALC is part of the executive branch, it has â€œno\r\n  authority to rule on the facial validityâ€ of a regulation); cf. Goodman, supra (unless a regulation improperly alters or adds to a statute, a\r\n  court may not invalidate it).Â  \r\nFinally,\r\n  we note the ALCâ€™s ruling that the regulatory definition was not sufficiently\r\n  expansive goes against the rule that a statutory tax exemption must be strictly\r\n  construed against the taxpayer.Â  TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of\r\n    Revenue, supra.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we hold that the ALC erred in applying its own, broad definition of\r\n  prosthetic device to find that Taxpayerâ€™s durable products were prosthetic\r\n  devices.\r\nRegarding the enteral nutritional formulas, the ALC found they were â€œmedicine sold by\r\n  prescription.â€[7]Â \r\n  The DOR argues that because the formulas are â€œover the counterâ€ (OTC) products[8] which do not require a prescription, the ALC erred.Â  Furthermore, the\r\n  DOR contends that CMNs are not equivalent to a prescription.Â  We agree.\r\nAs discussed above,\r\n  the DOR has set forth a definition for â€œmedicine by prescriptionâ€ - the\r\n  medicine must be of a type that requires a prescription, the sale must require\r\n  a prescription, and it must actually be sold by prescription.Â  Taxpayer argues\r\n  that a prior legislative version (a 1970 reimbursement statute) more explicitly\r\n  stated the requirement - â€œmedicines required by law to be sold only by\r\n  prescriptionâ€ - and therefore, the current language is not exclusively for medicines that require a prescription.Â  In our opinion, however, the\r\n  current statutory language - â€œmedicine â€¦ sold by prescriptionâ€ - clearly evidences\r\n  a legislative intent that the exemption be only for those medicines requiring a\r\n  prescription.Â  See TNS Mills, Inc., supra (tax exemption\r\n  statute must be given its plain, ordinary meaning and must be strictly\r\n  construed against the claimed exemption).[9]\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe\r\n  hold the ALC rules allow a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion, and therefore deny\r\n  Taxpayerâ€™s motion to dismiss the appeal. Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  Additionally, we reverse the\r\n  ALCâ€™s decision which found Taxpayerâ€™s products tax exempt.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The audit covered Taxpayerâ€™s sales from July 1, 2000\r\n  through June 30, 2003.Â  The proposed assessment was for $299,207.81 in sales\r\n  taxes, and $ 92,285.51 in interest, for a total of $391,493.32.Â  \r\n[2] The DORâ€™s motion was for partial summary judgment.\r\n[3] The ALCâ€™s order was received on August 30, 2007.Â  An\r\n  appeal from the ALC must be filed within 30 days.Â  See Rule 203(b)(6),\r\n  SCACR.Â  If the time period was not tolled, the deadline for filing in this case\r\n  would have been Monday October 1, 2007 (because the 30th day fell on Saturday, September 29, 2007).Â  See Rule 234(a), SCACR.\r\n[4] Â Rule 60(b), SCRCP, states:\r\nOn motion and upon such terms as are just,\r\n  the court may relieve a party or his legal representative from a final\r\n  judgment, order, or proceeding for the following reasons:\r\n\r\n\t(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable\r\n  neglect;\r\n\t(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence\r\n  could not have been discovered in time to move for a new trial under Rule\r\n  59(b);\r\n\t(3) fraud, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an\r\n  adverse party;\r\n\t(4) the judgment is void;\r\n\t(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or\r\n  discharged, or a prior judgment upon which it is based has been reversed or\r\n  otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment should have\r\n  prospective application.\r\n\r\n[5] Under Rule 59(e), SCRCP, a\r\n  motion â€œto alter or amend the judgmentâ€ may be made within ten days of receipt\r\n  of written notice of the entry of the order.Â  \r\n[6] These regulatory definitions have been in continuous\r\n  use since 1978.Â  \r\n[7] We recognize the ALC found that all the items at\r\n  issue - even the durable devices - were medicine sold by prescription.Â  In\r\n  making this determination, the ALC relied on the definition of medicine for\r\n  pharmacists found in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-43-30(16).Â  We agree with the DOR that\r\n  this definition has no application to the definition of medicine in the sales\r\n  tax exemption statute found in section 12-36-2120(28)(a).Â  See Â§ 40-43-30 (where statute specifies that the definitions are for\r\n  â€œpurposes of this chapterâ€) (emphasis added).\r\n[8] One example the DOR highlights is PediaSure with\r\n  Fiber which can be purchased at a grocery store.\r\n[9] Moreover, in another section of the sales tax\r\n  exemption statute, the Legislature seems to have made a distinction between\r\n  prescription and OTC medicines. Â The statute provides the following exemption:\r\n\r\n\t(63)\r\n  prescription and over-the-counter medicines and medical supplies, including\r\n  diabetic supplies, diabetic diagnostic equipment, and diabetic testing\r\n  equipment, sold to a health care clinic that provides medical and dental care\r\n  without charge to all of its patients.\r\n\r\nÂ§ 12-36-2120.Â  Thus, if the\r\n  Legislature had intended to include OTC medicines in the exemption at issue\r\n  here, it could have used language evidencing that intent.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26639","title":"Gissel v.

App. 2007).Â  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn the summer of 2003, Petitioners, the Gissels and\r\n  McEachern, filed separate complaints against Homes America Inc., Southern\r\n  Showcase Housing, Inc, Charles Hart, Gene Hart, and Amery English.[1]Â \r\n  The complaints alleged Charles Hart and Gene Hart were agents, servants, and\r\n  employees of Homes America, Inc, and that Homes America had sold them both mobile\r\n  homes in early 2001.[2] Â Petitioners alleged they were advised by the Harts that they could finance\r\n  land/home packages with concrete footings included in the purchase price.Â \r\n  However, upon delivery, the mobile homes were improperly installed and had\r\n  numerous deficiencies which were never remedied.Â  The complaints alleged causes\r\n  of action for negligence, fraud, and breach of contract with fraudulent intent\r\n  against Homes America, Southern Showcase Housing, Charles Hart, Gene Hart, and\r\n  Amery English.Â  Each of the complaints alleged the deficiencies were the result\r\n  of the negligence and recklessness of the defendants â€œjointly, severally or in\r\n  the alternative.â€ Â The complaints sought actual and punitive damages.Â  \r\nSouthern Homes\r\n  moved to dismiss the complaint and refer the matter to arbitration as required\r\n  by the partiesâ€™ contract.Â  Thereafter, Charles Hart and Gene Hart, who were\r\n  individually named in the complaints, filed a separate motion to dismiss and\r\n  moved to refer the matter to arbitration.Â  \r\nBy orders dated\r\n  January 13, 2004, the motions to compel arbitration were granted.Â  Judge\r\n  Jefferson found the contractâ€™s arbitration provision, which was contained on\r\n  the top of the first page of the contract (Form 500) in bold type, underlined\r\n  capital letters, binding.Â  It states: \r\n\r\n\tNOTICE\r\n  OF ARBITRATION PROVISION: THIS CONTRACT CONTAINS A BINDING AGREEMENT TO\r\n  ARBRITRATE ALL CLAIMS, DISPUTES AND CONTROVERSIES ARISING OUT OF OR IN\r\n  CONNECTION WITH THIS CONTRACT.\r\n\r\nAfter an\r\n  arbitration hearing, Southern Homes settled with the Gissels and McEachern,\r\n  leaving the Harts as sole defendants.Â  The arbitrator then entered awards in\r\n  favor of the Gissels and McEachern against the Harts.Â  The Gissels were awarded\r\n  $55,000.00 actual, consequential and incidental damages against Charles Hart\r\n  and Gene Hart, jointly and severally; they were awarded $45,000.00 punitive\r\n  damages against Charles Hart, individually, and $45,000.00 punitive damages\r\n  against Gene Hart individually.Â  McEachern was awarded $53,000.00 actual,\r\n  consequential and incidental damages against Charles Hart and Gene Hart,\r\n  jointly and severally, and $45,000.00 punitive damages against Charles Hart,\r\n  individually, and $45,000.00 punitive damages against Gene Hart individually.Â  \r\nThe Harts appealed\r\n  to the circuit court and moved to vacate the arbitratorâ€™s award, contending\r\n  there was no evidence presented to the arbitrator that they had acted outside\r\n  the scope of their employment for Homes America.Â  The circuit court denied the\r\n  Hartâ€™s motion to vacate and confirmed the arbitratorâ€™s award.Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals vacated the arbitratorâ€™s award against the Harts; it found the\r\n  complaints did not clearly assert claims against the Harts in their individual\r\n  capacities, such that there was no basis on which to predicate an award of\r\n  punitive damages.Â  The Court affirmed the awards to the extent they imposed\r\n  damages against the Harts in their representative capacities as agents,\r\n  servants and employees of Homes America.Â  The Court of Appeals denied\r\n  rehearing, and this Court granted certiorari.\r\n\r\nISSUE\r\nDid the Court of\r\n  Appeals err in ruling there was no basis upon which to impose individual\r\n  liability against the Harts?\r\nSCOPE OF REVIEW\r\nThe determination\r\n  of whether a claim is subject to arbitration is subject to de novo review.Â  Nevertheless, a circuit court's factual findings will not be reversed\r\n  on appeal if any evidence reasonably supports the findings.Â  Aiken v. World\r\n    Finance Corp. of South Carolina, 373 S.C. 144, 644 S.E.2d 705 (2007).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nArbitration is a\r\n  favored method of settling disputes in South Carolina.Â  Unless a court can say\r\n  with positive assurance that an arbitration clause is not susceptible to any\r\n  interpretation that covers the dispute, arbitration should generally be\r\n  ordered.Â  Aiken v. World Finance Corp., infra; Zabinski v.\r\n    Bright Acres Assocs., 346 S.C. 580, 596-97, 553 S.E.2d 110, 118-19 (2001).Â \r\n  However, arbitration is a matter of contract and a party cannot be required to\r\n  submit to arbitration any dispute which he has not agreed to submit. Â Id. at 596, 553 S.E.2d at 118.Â  Courts generally hold broadly-worded arbitration\r\n  agreements apply to disputes in which a â€œsignificant relationshipâ€ exists\r\n  between the asserted claims and the contract in which the arbitration clause is\r\n  contained.Â  Id. at 598, 553 S.E.2d at 119 (quoting Long v. Silver,\r\n  248 F.3d 309 (4th Cir.2001)).Â  \r\nWhen a dispute is\r\n  submitted to arbitration, the arbitrator determines questions of both law and\r\n  fact. Â Generally, an arbitration award is conclusive and courts will refuse to\r\n  review the merits of an award. Â An award will be vacated only under narrow,\r\n  limited circumstances.Â  Pittman Mortgage Co. v. Edwards, 327 S.C. 72,\r\n  75-76, 488 S.E.2d 335, 337 (1997).Â  An arbitratorâ€™s award may be vacated when\r\n  the arbitrator exceeds his or her powers and/or manifestly disregards or\r\n  perversely misconstrues the law.Â Â  Technical College v. Lucas\r\n    and Stubbs, 286 S.C. 98, 333 S.E.2d 781 (1985); S.C. Code Ann. Â§\r\n  15-48-130(a).Â  \r\nHowever, for a\r\n  court to vacate an arbitration award based upon an arbitratorâ€™s manifest\r\n  disregard of the law, the governing law ignored by the arbitrator must be well\r\n  defined, explicit, and clearly applicable.Â  Id.; Trident Technical College v. Lucas and Stubbs, 286 S.C. 98, 333 S.E.2d 781 (1985).Â  Case law\r\n  presupposes something beyond a mere error in construing or applying the law.Â \r\n  Even a â€œclearly erroneous interpretation of the contractâ€ cannot be disturbed.Â  Id. at 108, 333 S.E.2d 787.Â  The focus is on the conduct of the\r\n  arbitrator and presupposes something beyond a mere error in construing or\r\n    applying the law.Â  Id. at 108, 333 S.E.2d at 787. (Emphasis\r\n  supplied).Â Â  Accord Harris v. Bennett, 332 S.C. 238, 503 S.E.2d\r\n  782 (Ct. App. 1998).Â  An arbitratorâ€™s â€œmanifest disregard of the law,â€ as a basis\r\n  for vacating an arbitration award occurs when the arbitrator knew of a\r\n  governing legal principle yet refused to apply it.Â  Weimer v. Jones, 364\r\n  S.C. 78, 610 S.E.2d 850 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  Factual and legal errors by\r\n  arbitrators do not constitute an abuse of powers, and a court is not required\r\n  to review the merits of a decision so long as the arbitrators do not exceed\r\n  their powers.Â  Pittman, supra.Â  \r\nHere, the Court of\r\n  Appeals recognized the four statutory grounds on which an arbitratorâ€™s award\r\n  may be vacated, to wit:\r\n\r\n\t(1)\r\n  where the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or undue means;\r\n\t(2) where\r\n  there was evident partiality or corruption in the arbitrators, or either of\r\n  them;\r\n\t(3)\r\n  where the arbitrators were guilty of misconduct in refusing to postpone the\r\n  hearing, upon sufficient cause shown, or in refusing to hear evidence pertinent\r\n  and material to the controversy; or of any other misbehavior by which the\r\n  rights of any party have been prejudiced; or\r\n\t(4)\r\n  where the arbitrators exceeded their powers, or so imperfectly executed them\r\n  that a mutual, final, and definite award upon the subject matter submitted was\r\n  not made.Â  \r\n\r\n9\r\n  U.S.C.A. Â§ 10(a) (1)-(4) (West Supp.2006).[3]Â  \r\nThe Court of\r\n  Appeals did not rule specifically on any of the above grounds, but noted the\r\n  Hartsâ€™ argument that the arbitrator exceeded his powers inasmuch as there was\r\n  no basis for an award of damages against them individually.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appeals then looked to the allegations of the complaint in order to\r\n  determine whether the award was proper.Â  This was error.Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Harts\r\n  effectively concede an arbitrator may apportion punitive damages between\r\n  joint tortfeasors citing D.E. Ytreberg, Apportionment of punitive or\r\n    exemplary damages as between joint tortfeasors 20 ALR3d 666 (1968) (indicating\r\n  that a majority of jurisdictions permit apportionment of such damages).Â \r\n  However, the Harts nonetheless contend it was proper for the Court of Appeals\r\n  to review the factual basis of the complaint to determine whether they were, in\r\n  fact, individual parties to the action.Â  We disagree.Â  Â Â \r\nThe complaint is\r\n  irrelevant to the determination of whether or not the arbitrator manifestly\r\n  disregarded the law.Â  What is dispositive is the fact that the Harts\r\n  specifically filed their own motion to dismiss and moved to have the matter\r\n  sent to arbitration.Â  They clearly did not dispute that they were named as\r\n  defendants, and they did not contend they should be dismissed as parties at\r\n  that time.Â  They should not now be permitted to complain on appeal.Â  Erickson\r\n    v. Jones St. Publishers, LLC, 368 S.C. 444, 476, 629 S.E.2d 653, 670 (2006)\r\n  (party may not complain on appeal of error which his own conduct induced).\r\nMoreover, in\r\n  holding the Harts were not individually sued as parties, the Court of Appeals\r\n  cited cases concerning whether defendants were sued in their individual, rather\r\n  than official capacities. Â The cited cases, however, deal with claims\r\n  against state agencies, counties, school boards, etc., and involve\r\n  public official immunity under state tort claims acts.Â  See e.g., Urquhart\r\n    v. Univ. Health Sys. of E. Carolina, Inc., 566 S.E.2d 143, 145 (N.C.\r\n  Ct. App. 2002); Paquette v. County of Durham, 573 S.E.2d 715, 719 (N.C.\r\n  Ct. App. 2002); McKagen v. Windham, 59 S.C. 434, 38 S.E. 2 (1901).\r\nThe present case,\r\n  however, does not involve tort claims immunity.Â  Even if the Harts were acting\r\n  as agents of Homes America, there is nothing preventing them from being held\r\n  independently liable for torts committed in the scope of their employment.Â Â  Cf. Dickert v. Metropolitan Life Ins., 311 S.C. 218, 428 S.E.2d 700 (1993)\r\n  (co-employee may be held individually liable for intentional tort committed\r\n  while acting within the scope of employment).Â  \r\nMoreover, the\r\n  complaints here specifically named the Harts as individual defendants, and\r\n  alleged they were jointly and severally liable, or liable in the alternative.Â  It\r\n  is clear that the Harts were named as individual defendants, and the Court of\r\n  Appeals erred in looking to the complaint to determine otherwise.Â  The Court of\r\n  Appealsâ€™ opinion is reversed and the arbitratorâ€™s award is reinstated.Â Â Â  \r\nREVERSED.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  Homes America was merged into Southern Showcase\r\n  Homes, Inc in April 2000.

Chandler meets the definition of a sexually violent predator\r\n  under the South Carolina Sexually Violent Predator Act.[1]Â \r\n  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn\r\n  December 2003, Chandler entered a negotiated plea of guilty to one count of assault\r\n  and battery of a high and aggravated nature (ABHAN).Â  He was sentenced under\r\n  the Youthful Offender Act (YOA)[2] to an indeterminate sentence of one to six years, suspended upon the service of\r\n  two years of probation and enrollment in counseling.Â  The victim alleged Chandler sexually assaulted her in February 2003 by pulling her into an unoccupied\r\n  classroom at school and forcing her to have intercourse.Â  At the time of the\r\n  offense, Chandler was 18 and the victim was 15.Â  \r\nWhile\r\n  on probation for this offense, Chandler, then 19, was arrested on an allegation\r\n  of criminal sexual conduct (CSC) with a minor in the second degree for having\r\n  sex with a 13-year-old girl on two occasions in February or March 2004.[3]Â \r\n  On both occasions, Chandler came to the victimâ€™s home at night and had\r\n  intercourse with her while her parents were asleep.Â  In December 2005, Chandler was allowed to plead guilty to one count of CSC in the third degree, and he received\r\n  a second YOA sentence of commitment for one to six years.[4]Â Â Â  \r\nBefore\r\n  Chandler entered his plea to the above-described charge, he was arrested in\r\n  April 2005 for CSC with a minor in the second degree after he was observed having\r\n  sex with a 13-year-old girl behind a school building.Â  He was 20 years old when\r\n  he committed this offense.Â  There is nothing in the record regarding the\r\n  disposition of this charge.\r\nIn\r\n  June 2006, prior to Chandlerâ€™s release from detention, a multidisciplinary team\r\n  appointed by the Director of the South Carolina Department of Corrections reviewed\r\n  Chandlerâ€™s case and determined there was probable cause to believe Chandler was\r\n  a sexually violent predator as defined by the Act and referred his case to the prosecutorâ€™s\r\n  review committee.Â  The prosecutorâ€™s review committee issued a report agreeing with\r\n  the finding of probable cause.Â  \r\nThereafter,\r\n  on August 9, 2006, the State filed a petition in the circuit court alleging Chandler met the statutory requirements for civil commitment as a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  The State alleged that Chandlerâ€™s conviction for CSC in the third\r\n  degree was a qualifying sexually violent offense under the Act, and that Chandler has a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes it likely he will\r\n  engage in acts of sexual violence again if he is not confined in a secure\r\n  facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â Â Â  \r\nOn August\r\n  14, 2006, a preliminary finding was made by a circuit court judge that the\r\n  State had set forth sufficient evidence to establish probable cause.Â  The\r\n  matter proceeded to a probable cause hearing in the circuit court before Judge\r\n  Markley Dennis in which Chandler was allowed to contest the probable cause\r\n  finding.Â  After the hearing, the circuit court issued an order dismissing the\r\n  Stateâ€™s petition and finding there was no probable cause to believe Chandler met the statutory definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  The State appeals,\r\n  arguing the circuit court considered inappropriate factors and erred in failing\r\n  to find the State established probable cause in this case.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.Â  South Carolina Sexually\r\n  Violent Predator Act\r\nThe Act provides for\r\n  the involuntary civil commitment of an individual deemed to be a sexually\r\n  violent predator, which is defined under the Act as a person who (a) has been\r\n  convicted of a sexually violent offense, and (b)&nbsp;suffers from a mental\r\n  abnormality or personality disorder that makes the person likely to engage in\r\n  acts of sexual violence if the person is not confined in a secure facility for long-term\r\n  control, care, and treatment.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(1) (Supp. 2008). \r\nThe\r\n  procedures of the Act are initiated when a person is about to be released from\r\n  confinement.Â  At that time, a multidisciplinary team appointed by the Director\r\n  of the South Carolina Department of Corrections reviews the relevant records,\r\n  including the personâ€™s â€œcriminal offense record,â€ to assess whether or not the\r\n  person meets the statutory definition of a sexually violent predator.Â  Id. Â§&nbsp;44-48-50.Â  \r\nUpon\r\n  referral from the multidisciplinary team, the prosecutorâ€™s review committee examines\r\n  whether probable cause exists to believe the person is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-60.Â  If so, the Attorney General must file a\r\n  petition in the circuit court asking the court to rule on the issue of probable\r\n  cause.Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-70.\r\nIn\r\n  the event the circuit court makes an initial determination that probable cause\r\n  exists, the person must be taken into custody if he is not already confined.Â Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-80(A).Â  Thereafter, the person is allowed the opportunity to appear in\r\n  person at a hearing to contest probable cause.Â  Id. Â§&nbsp;44-48-80(B).Â \r\n  Once a probable cause determination is made by the circuit court, the person is\r\n  required to undergo an evaluation by a court-approved expert.Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-80(D).Â  A trial is then held in the court of common pleas to conclude whether\r\n  the person is, in fact, a sexually violent predator as defined by the Act.Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-90.Â  The State must prove the allegation beyond a reasonable doubt to either\r\n  the court or a jury.Â  Id. Â§&nbsp;44-48-100(A).Â  \r\nB.Â  Circuit Courtâ€™s Order\r\nIn\r\n  the current case, the circuit court dismissed the Stateâ€™s petition after the\r\n  hearing to contest probable cause, concluding â€œ[p]robable cause does not exist\r\n  to order further evaluation and commitment pending trial.â€Â  The court found the\r\n  State had established Chandler was convicted of a qualifying offense under the\r\n  Act, but did not establish that Chandler suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\r\n  in the future.Â  The court stated â€œ[i]t may be possible that the Respondent will\r\n  not commit further offenses.â€Â  \r\nIn\r\n  reaching this determination, the court noted that Chandler was given a YOA\r\n  sentence, â€œwhich indicates that both the court and consenting prosecution\r\n  believed his acts were substantially caused by youthful poor judgment and\r\n  impulsiveness.â€Â  The court further noted that â€œ[i]t does not appear clear from\r\n  the record that actual physical violence was used in committing these crimes.â€Â \r\n  The court stated Chandler has taken some courses related to his offense while\r\n  at the Department of Corrections, and his being on probation and listed on the\r\n  sex offender registry â€œprovide sufficient opportunity for [Chandler] to\r\n  rehabilitate himself as well as permanent protection of the public.â€Â  The court\r\n  stated it â€œmust weigh this case in view of the Stateâ€™s limited resources for\r\n  treatment and finds that commitment under the [A]ct is a substantial\r\n  infringement on [Chandlerâ€™s] ability to earn a living and contribute\r\n  productively to society while the resources used to continue his treatment may\r\n  be better used to protect the community in other ways . . .&nbsp;.â€Â  \r\nC.Â  The Stateâ€™s Appeal\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the State argues the circuit court erred in dismissing its petition and\r\n  finding there was no probable cause to believe Chandler is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  The State contends the circuit court considered inappropriate\r\n  evidence, including the facts that Chandler received a YOA sentence and would\r\n  be on probation after his release.Â  The State asserts the court should have\r\n  allowed this matter to proceed to a full evaluation of Chandler and a trial on\r\n  the merits of the petition.\r\nâ€œOn\r\n  review, the appellate court will not disturb the hearing courtâ€™s finding on\r\n  probable cause unless found to be without evidence that reasonably supports the\r\n  hearing courtâ€™s finding.â€Â  In re the Care and Treatment of Tucker, 353\r\n  S.C. 466, 470, 578 S.E.2d 719, 721&nbsp;(2003); accord In re the Care\r\n    and Treatment of Beaver, 372 S.C. 272, 278, 642 S.E.2d 578, 582 (2007).Â  Thus,\r\n  we must consider whether any evidence reasonably supports the courtâ€™s ruling.\r\nThe\r\n  Act contains a two-pronged test to determine whether a person is a sexually\r\n  violent predator.Â  The circuit court found the first prong was satisfied and\r\n  there is no dispute in this regard.Â  Chandler was convicted of CSC in the third\r\n  degree, which is specifically listed as a qualifying offense under the Act.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-30(2)(c) (Supp. 2008) (listing CSC in the third degree\r\n  as a violent offense for purposes of the Act).Â  This case turns on the second\r\n  prong, i.e., whether Chandler suffers from a mental abnormality or personality\r\n  disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if he is not\r\n  confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.Â  \r\nUnder\r\n  the Act, â€œmental abnormalityâ€ is defined as â€œa mental condition affecting a\r\n  personâ€™s emotional or volitional capacity that predisposes the person to commit\r\n  sexually violent offenses.â€Â  Id. Â§ 44-48-30(3); see also In re\r\n    the Care and Treatment of Kennedy, 353 S.C. 394, 397 n.2, 578 S.E.2d 27, 28\r\n  n.2 (Ct. App. 2003) (defining â€œmental abnormalityâ€ as used in the statute).Â  \r\nAs\r\n  this Court has previously noted, the State cannot require a mental evaluation\r\n  of an offender until a court has found probable cause after a hearing;\r\n  therefore, the State is generally unable to produce mental health information\r\n  at the probable cause hearing, but this does not preclude a finding of probable\r\n  cause:\r\n\r\n\tPursuant to the SVP Act, and particularly S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§&nbsp;44-48-80(D) (Supp. 2006), the State is not able to require a mental\r\n  examination of the offender until a judge, after a hearing, has found that\r\n  there is probable cause to believe the offender is a sexually violent\r\n  predator.Â  Therefore, the State is generally unable to produce any mental\r\n  health information at the probable cause hearing because probable cause must\r\n  first be found by a judge at the hearing before such evidence can be obtained. Â The\r\n    Stateâ€™s inability to provide mental health evidence does not prevent a finding\r\n    of probable cause.Â  \r\n\r\nIn re the Care and\r\n  Treatment of Beaver, 372 S.C. at 278,\r\n  642 S.E.2d at 582 (emphasis added). \r\nâ€œIn\r\n  the context of probable cause to believe someone to be a sexually violent\r\n  predator, probable cause requires that the evidence presented would lead a\r\n  reasonable person to believe and conscientiously entertain suspicion that the\r\n  person meets the definition of a sexually violent predator.â€Â  In re the Care\r\n    and Treatment of Brown, 372 S.C. 611, 620, 643 S.E.2d 118, 122-23 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  â€œProbable cause â€˜does not demand any showing that such a belief be\r\n  correct or more likely true than false.â€™â€Â  Id. at 620, 643 S.E.2d at 123\r\n  (quoting Texas v. Brown, 460 U.S. 730, 742 (1983)).Â  â€œThe very term\r\n  itself, â€˜probable cause,â€™ does not import absolute certainty.â€Â  Id. at 619, 643 S.E.2d at 122.\r\nOne of the findings\r\n  of the circuit court is that â€œ[i]t does not appear clear from the record that\r\n  actual physical violence was used in committing these crimes.â€Â  At the hearing Chandlerâ€™s counsel argued two of the offenses, the ones involving the two 13-year-old\r\n  victims, were consensual; as for the remaining offense, which involved the\r\n  alleged forcible assault of the victim and Chandlerâ€™s plea to ABHAN, counsel\r\n  opined that â€œin all probability this was also a consensual act.â€Â  Chandlerâ€™s counsel asserted he did not â€œthink this is a matter of a man in denial.Â  It is\r\n  - this is a case of immaturity and impulsiveness, such as is not unusual to see\r\n  in a nineteen or twenty-year-old man; taking advantages of girls who, frankly,\r\n  wanted to be taken advantage of.â€Â  On appeal, Chandler asserts â€œ[a]ll of the\r\n  evidence indicates that the three acts were consensual.â€Â  \r\nContrary\r\n  to counselâ€™s assertion, the record indicates that in one of the incidents,\r\n  which resulted in Chandlerâ€™s plea to ABHAN, the victim reported that force was\r\n  used.Â  As for the other two offenses involving 13-year-old girls, the victims\r\n  were underage and could not legally give consent.Â  In any event, physical\r\n  violence is not a prerequisite under the Act.Â  As noted in the case of In re\r\n    the Care and Treatment of Brown, to qualify as a sexually violent offense,\r\n  the actions do not have to be violent in the sense of being physically injurious\r\n  or destructive, and many of the listed offenses do not require an act of\r\n  physical violence.Â  Id. at 621, 643 S.E.2d at 123 (â€œThat Brown was not\r\n  violent, per se, toward any of his victims is of no consequence.Â  . . .Â  Many\r\n  of the listed offenses [in the Act] do not require an overt act of violence.â€).\r\nConsideration\r\n  of a personâ€™s past criminal history is directly relevant to establishing\r\n  whether a person has been convicted of a sexually violent offense under section\r\n  44-48-30(1)(a), which in turn bears directly on whether one suffers from a\r\n  mental abnormality under section 44-48-30(1)(b).Â  In re the Care and\r\n    Treatment of Ettel, 377 S.C. 558, 562, 660 S.E.2d 285, 287 (Ct. App.\r\n  2008).Â  As the State points out, Chandler has been involved in three known offenses\r\n  of a sexual nature involving young girls, which indicates Chandler has\r\n  developed a pattern of engaging in inappropriate conduct.Â  He committed some\r\n  acts even while he was already on probation for similar conduct.Â  \r\nIn December\r\n  2003, Chandler pled guilty to ABHAN, and the victim alleged force was used when\r\n  Chandler assaulted her.Â  In early 2004, while still on probation for this\r\n  offense, Chandler, then 19, had intercourse with a 13-year-old on two\r\n  occasions, for which he was allowed to plead guilty to CSC in the third\r\n  degree.Â  Chandler received a YOA sentence for both charges.Â  Before he entered\r\n  his plea to this last charge, however, Chandler was again brought to the\r\n  attention of authorities for having intercourse with a 13-year-old minor in\r\n  April 2005.Â  At that time, Chandler was 20 years old.Â  \r\nThe\r\n  record indicates Chandler was aware that his conduct was inappropriate, as he\r\n  told the responding officers that he was already on probation for the â€œsame\r\n  thingâ€ and he denied having sex with the last 13-year-old victim, despite the\r\n  reports of eyewitnesses and the victim herself.Â  The victim told the responding\r\n  officers that Chandler knew she was 13 years old.Â  Chandler was arrested for\r\n  CSC with a minor in the second degree, but there is no record of a disposition\r\n  on that charge.Â  Although Chandler contends only the conviction for the CSC in\r\n  the third degree is relevant since it is a qualifying offense enumerated in the\r\n  Act, there is no merit to this contention.Â  Under the Act, a personâ€™s â€œcriminal\r\n  offense recordâ€ includes convictions for criminal sexual offenses as well as\r\n  evidence of criminal sexual offenses not resulting in convictions.Â  In re\r\n    the Care and Treatment of Ettel, 377 S.C. at 562, 660 S.E.2d at 287; In\r\n      re the Care and Treatment of White, 375 S.C. 1, 649 S.E.2d 172 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).\r\nAs\r\n  to the circuit courtâ€™s other considerations, i.e., that Chandlerâ€™s receipt of\r\n  sentencing under the YOA indicated the sentencing judge and the prosecutor\r\n  thought Chandler could be rehabilitated, and the provision for probation gave\r\n  the public adequate protection, these factors are not determinative of the\r\n  probable cause issue.Â  Rehabilitation is a goal of all concerned; however, the\r\n  positive potential for rehabilitation does not negate probable cause for a\r\n  mental evaluation and a hearing on the merits.Â  Moreover, there are a variety\r\n  of reasons why the State would negotiate a plea with Chandler, ranging from the\r\n  ability of the State to acquire the necessary evidence to the possibility that\r\n  testifying might be difficult for the victims.Â  The severity of punishment\r\n  imposed in the criminal matter may give rise to closer scrutiny of the facts,\r\n  but it is not determinative in this civil proceeding to evaluate whether there\r\n  is probable cause to believe that Chandler suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder.Â  Chandler was twice the recipient of a YOA sentence, but\r\n  he committed a third sexual offense, so the sentence Chandler received was not\r\n  a reliable indicator of his propensity to commit future acts of sexual violence.Â  \r\nIn In\r\n  re the Care and Treatment of Beaver, we held the circuit court erred in\r\n  finding the State had not set forth sufficient evidence of probable cause.Â \r\n  Beaver pled guilty to aggravated sexual battery and incest; a few years later, after\r\n  his release from prison, he performed a lewd act upon a 10-year-old girl.Â  372\r\n  S.C. at 274, 642 S.E.2d at 579-80.Â  We noted, â€œHis behavior reveals a\r\n  propensity to commit acts of sexual violence to such a degree as to pose a\r\n  menace to the health and safety of young girls.â€Â  Id. at 278, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  at 582.Â  We observed that the State is not able to require a full evaluation of\r\n  a subject until probable cause is found, and we concluded the circuit court\r\n  erred in ruling the State had failed to provide sufficient evidence that Beaver\r\n  suffered from a mental abnormality or personality disorder that makes him\r\n  likely to engage in acts of sexual violence if not confined.Â  Id. at\r\n  278-79, 642 S.E.2d at 582.Â  Chandlerâ€™s record likewise demonstrates he has a\r\n  propensity to commit inappropriate acts with young girls.\r\nWe\r\n  hold the State has met its burden of establishing probable cause.Â  As the State\r\n  points out, Chandler has not completed his treatment program while at the\r\n  Department of Corrections.Â  It is important to note also that â€œa finding of\r\n  probable cause at the probable cause hearing does not . . . finally decide the\r\n  question of whether that person is a sexually violent predator.â€Â  Id. at 275 n.2, 642 S.E.2d at 580 n.2.Â  Thus, once Chandler has a complete\r\n  evaluation, he will still have the opportunity to refute the Stateâ€™s allegation\r\n  that he meets the definition of a sexually violent predator at a trial on the\r\n  merits.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThere\r\n  is no evidence to support the circuit courtâ€™s finding that the State failed to\r\n  establish probable cause.Â  Consequently, we reverse the circuit courtâ€™s order and\r\n  remand this matter for further proceedings in accordance with the Act,\r\n  including a psychiatric evaluation and a trial on the merits. \r\nREVERSED\r\n  AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., KITTREDGE, J., concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in\r\n  which Waller, J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:Â  I respectfully dissent.Â  In my opinion, there is\r\n  evidence in the record which supports the probable cause hearing judgeâ€™s\r\n  conclusion that respondent does not suffer from â€œa mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual violence\r\n  if not confined in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and\r\n  treatment.â€Â  S.C.

App. 2007) (any evidence scope of review on appeal from\r\n  probable cause determination).\r\nIn finding that\r\n  respondent did not suffer from the requisite mental abnormality or personality\r\n  disorder, the circuit court relied upon the following findings of fact:\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t1)\r\n\t\t\tRespondent was offered a Youthful Offender Act (YOA) sentence for the predicate offense based on a plea\r\n  negotiated by a solicitor noted for careful protection of the public interest\r\n  in sexual offense cases;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t2)\r\n\t\t\tThe negotiated plea was accepted by a trial judge \r\n\t\t\twho is also known for this kind of protective attitude;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t3) \r\n\t\t\tRespondent turned himself in, and pled guilty, \r\n\t\t\tthereby accepting responsibility for his actions;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t4)\r\n\t\t\tA YOA sentence indicates both the\r\n  plea judge and the prosecutor believed respondentâ€™s criminal acts were\r\n  substantially caused by youthful poor judgment and impulsiveness, a conclusion\r\n  concurred in by the hearing judge after review of the facts of all respondentâ€™s\r\n  offenses;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t5) \r\n\t\t\tIt does not appear that actual physical violence \r\n\t\t\twas involved in any of respondentâ€™s offenses;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t6) \r\n\t\t\tWhile incarcerated, respondent has completed \r\n\t\t\tseveral courses related to his offense;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t7) \r\n\t\t\tProbation and registration as a sex offender, with \r\n\t\t\tthe concomitant monitoring and supervision provide both an \r\n\t\t\topportunity for respondent to rehabilitate himself and permanent \r\n\t\t\tprotection for the public; and\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t8)\r\n\t\t\tRespondent has not been previously \r\n\t\t\tincarcerated for this type of conduct, nor has he received prior \r\n\t\t\ttreatment or counseling.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  majority takes issue with certain evidence cited by the hearing judge.Â  For\r\n  example, the majority notes that there could be a variety of reasons why the\r\n  State would offer Chandler a YOA sentence.Â  I agree with the majority in this\r\n  regard, but note that on appeal, â€œthis court is concerned with the existence of\r\n  evidence, not its weight.â€ In re Matter of Brown, 372 S.C. at 616, 643\r\n  S.E.2d at 121.Â  In my view, whether the offender was offered a negotiated plea,\r\n  a lesser sentence, and/or probation is relevant to the question of probable\r\n  cause to believe the offender is among the â€œmentally abnormal and extremely\r\n  dangerous group of sexually violent predators who require involuntary civil\r\n  commitment in a secure facility for long-term control, care, and treatment.â€Â \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-48-20 (Supp. 2007).Â Â Â  While certainly factors other than\r\n  the seriousness of the offenses and the offenderâ€™s potential threat to the\r\n  public play a role in these considerations, the post-arrest decisions made by\r\n  law enforcement professionals and prosecutors with intimate knowledge of the\r\n  circumstances, which result in an alleged SVP serving a YOA, a probationary\r\n  sentence, or no sentence at all, have evidentiary value in deciding whether an\r\n  offender is more immature than dangerous. In my opinion, these prosecutorial\r\n  and sentencing decisions provides evidentiary support for the probable cause\r\n  hearing judgeâ€™s conclusion that respondent was more immature than abnormal.\r\nThe\r\n  State alleged the following facts in support of its allegation that there was\r\n  probable cause to believe respondent was a sexually violent predator: \r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(1) \r\n\t\t\tChandler pled guilty in December 2003 to one count \r\n\t\t\tof ABHAN\r\n  and was sentenced under the YOA. The victim stated that she was forced to have\r\n  intercourse with Chandler.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(2) \r\n\t\t\tChandler pled guilty to one count of CSC in the \r\n\t\t\tthird degree based on two occasions on which he had intercourse with \r\n\t\t\ta 13-year-old girl.&nbsp; He was sentenced under the YOA.\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t(3)\r\n\t\t\tChandler was arrested in April 2005 based on an \r\n\t\t\tallegation that he had intercourse with a 13-year-old girl.&nbsp; He \r\n\t\t\tdenied the offense and was not charged.\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  hearing judge found that actual physical violence was not involved in any of\r\n  the crimes, which he viewed as a factor in determining whether there is\r\n  probable cause to believe respondent suffers from a mental abnormality or\r\n  personality disorder. \r\nThe\r\n  majority rejects, as lacking in evidentiary support, the finding that physical\r\n  violence was not involved in any of respondentâ€™s offenses.Â  The record contains\r\n  the following evidence which support this finding:\r\n\r\n\t(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offense A\r\n\t\r\n\t\tThis\r\n  offense involved intercourse between 18 year old respondent and a 15 year old\r\n  victim in February 2003.Â  Although the victim stated she was â€œforcedâ€ to have\r\n  intercourse, she did not report the incident and was a reluctant witness,\r\n  expressing concern that she would be sent away from home for â€œgetting in\r\n  trouble again.â€Â  The incident occurred in a classroom during the school day but\r\n  was not discovered until a week later when the victimâ€™s sister was overheard\r\n  yelling at respondent and others that the sister â€œwas going to have [victim]\r\n  tell everybody that she was raped.â€Â  There was no evidence of physical violence\r\n  on the part of respondent in â€œforcingâ€ the sexual encounter.\r\n\t\tRespondent\r\n  received a YOA sentence, suspended to two years probation, after pleading to\r\n  Assault and Battery of a High and Aggravated Nature.\r\n\t\r\n\t(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offense B\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn\r\n  March 2004, respondent, aged 19, had consensual intercourse with 13 year old\r\n  victim at her home.Â  Respondent told officers that the victim had lied about\r\n  her age.\r\n\t\tRespondent\r\n  received a YOA sentence after pleading guilty to Criminal Sexual Conduct with a\r\n  Minor in the Third Degree (CSCM 3rd).\r\n\t\r\n\t(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Offense C\r\n\t\r\n\t\tIn\r\n  2005, 20 year old respondent was arrested and charged with Criminal Sexual Conduct\r\n  with a Minor in the Second Degree for having consensual intercourse with a 13\r\n  year old.Â  No charges were lodged.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nIn\r\n  my opinion, there is evidence to support the finding that no physical violence\r\n  was involved in any of respondentâ€™s three offenses.Â  Like the majority, I note\r\n  that physical violence is not necessary in order for an offense to qualify as\r\n  â€œsexually violent.â€Â  I agree with the circuit judge, however, that the absence\r\n  of such violence may be probative the respondent suffers from a mental abnormality\r\n  or personality disorder that makes him likely to engage in acts of sexual\r\n  violence unless confined long term in a secure facility. Â Â \r\nFinally,\r\n  the majority suggests that respondentâ€™s record of offenses is comparable to\r\n  that of the respondent in In the Matter of Beaver, 372 S.C. 272, 642\r\n  S.E.2d 578 (2007).Â  Beaverâ€™s arrest record consisted of four counts of\r\n  aggravated rape of a child, two counts of aggravated sexual battery, and two\r\n  counts of incest arising from his molestation of his eight and ten year old\r\n  daughters, charges which Tennessee authorities allowed him to plead down to one\r\n  count of aggravated sexual battery and one count of incest.Â  Following his\r\n  release from prison in Tennessee, Beaver was charged in South Carolina with\r\n  committing a lewd act on a child under sixteen (in this case, ten) and one\r\n  count of communicating obscene messages to her.Â  He was permitted to plead to\r\n  the lewd act charge and the obscene message charge was dropped.Â  In my opinion,\r\n  the criminal history of respondent is not comparable to that of Beaver. \r\nBased on the above,\r\n  it is my opinion that there is evidence in the record which supports the\r\n  probable cause judgeâ€™s finding that respondent is an immature person rather\r\n  than an extremely dangerous sexual predator.Â  I would therefore affirm.Â  In\r\n    the Matter of Brown, supra.Â  \r\nWALLER, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â  S.C.

Osmanâ€™s conduct in performing a surgical\r\n  procedure warranted the issuance of a public reprimand, the imposition of\r\n  costs, and the proviso that Dr. Osman must meet certain requirements to\r\n  reestablish her competency if she ever returned to the practice of surgical\r\n  obstetrics in South Carolina.Â  On appeal, the Administrative Law Court (ALC)\r\n  upheld the public reprimand and costs but struck the competency requirement\r\n  holding the requirement was an â€œanticipatory suspension.â€Â  The Board and Dr.\r\n  Osman filed cross-appeals.Â  We affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nI.\r\nDr.\r\n  Osman is a physician licensed by the State Board of Medical Examiners to\r\n  practice family medicine in South Carolina.Â  In July 2002, she was practicing\r\n  in Allendale, South Carolina.Â  One of Dr. Osmanâ€™s patients was expecting her\r\n  third child.Â  The thirty-nine year old patient and her husband wanted the child\r\n  to be born in Allendale, apparently to minimize the inconvenience and\r\n  disruption to the husbandâ€™s motel business during a busy holiday season. Â Dr.\r\n  Osman acquiesced in this request, although the patient suffered from placenta\r\n  previa, which is an anterior, low-lying placenta possibly covering a portion of\r\n  the opening to the womb.\r\nDr.\r\n  Osman began the Caesarean section (hereinafter C-Section).Â  Epidural anesthesia\r\n  was attempted multiple times without success.Â  Therefore, general anesthesia\r\n  was administered.Â  Unbeknownst to Dr. Osman, the Certified Registered Nurse\r\n  Anesthetist (CRNA) was unable to intubate the patient.Â  During the surgery, the\r\n  placenta bled heavily and hampered Dr. Osmanâ€™s ability to deliver the baby.Â  This\r\n  difficulty caused Dr. Osman to lengthen her incision multiple times.Â  The baby\r\n  was successfully delivered, but one of the lengthening incisions injured the\r\n  patientâ€™s uterine artery.Â  This injury was not detected by Dr. Osman during the\r\n  surgery.Â  The damage to the artery and the placenta abnormality led to\r\n  significant bleeding and declining vital signs.\r\nAs\r\n  the patientâ€™s vital signs deteriorated, Dr. Osman instructed staff to contact\r\n  Dr. Ross, a local surgeon.Â  Dr. Ross, however, was away on a planned vacation.Â \r\n  Dr. Osman failed to ensure the availability of a surgeon in case of\r\n  complications.Â  Due to the deteriorating circumstances, Dr. Osman contacted Dr.\r\n  Johnson at MUSC.Â  The patient was transferred to MUSC by helicopter.Â  At MUSC,\r\n  Dr. Johnson conducted an ultrasound and immediately began operating on the\r\n  patient.Â  While operating, significant bleeding was observed.Â  A total\r\n  abdominal hysterectomy was performed.Â  The patient remained at the hospital for\r\n  seven days following surgery and was discharged.Â  Despite the positive results,\r\n  all parties agree, the patient was very close to death.\r\nThis\r\n  disciplinary action followed when the Board filed a formal complaint against Dr. Osman alleging approximately\r\n  thirteen deviations from the standard of care. Â Dr. Osman filed a pro se response admitting to three instances of misconduct alleged in the complaint:\r\n  inappropriately performing the surgery in a community county hospital with\r\n  limited resources, failing to ensure surgical backup, and failing to obtain\r\n  proper written consent.\r\nBoth\r\n  the Disciplinary Panel for the Board and Board found misconduct as to those matters\r\n  conceded by Dr. Osman. Â In its report, the panel recommended no sanction be\r\n  issued. Â However, the Board elected to publically reprimand Dr. Osman, require\r\n  Dr. Osman to pay the assessed costs associated\r\n  with adjudicating the case, and restrict\r\n  Dr. Osman from the practice of surgical obstetrics until Dr. Osman proves she\r\n  has the appropriate education and training.Â  Dr. Osman returned to her native Lebanon.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, the ALC affirmed the public reprimand and imposition of costs.Â  The ALC,\r\n  however, deleted the provision requiring Dr. Osman to establish competency in\r\n  surgical obstetrics on the basis that â€œan anticipatory suspension is a sanction\r\n  that the Board does not have the authority to impose.â€Â  The Board and Dr. Osman filed cross appeals challenging\r\n  the ALCâ€™s order.Â  These appeals are before us pursuant to Rule 204(b)\r\n  certification.\r\n\r\nII.\r\nThe Boardâ€™s Appeal\r\nThe Board argues\r\n  the ALC erred in striking the reestablishment of competency condition.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nSection 40-1-120(A)(3) of the South Carolina Code (2001)\r\n  authorizes the Board to â€œplace a licensee on probation or restrict or suspend\r\n  the individualâ€™s license for a definite or indefinite time and prescribe\r\n  conditions to be met during probation, restriction, or suspension including,\r\n  but not limited to, satisfactory completion of additional education, of a\r\n  supervisory period, or of continuing education programs.â€Â  The Boardâ€™s order contained\r\n  the following competency reestablishment clause:\r\n\r\n\tIf [Dr. Osman] should ever return to active practice\r\n  in the State of South Carolina, [Dr. Osman] shall be restricted from the\r\n  practice of surgical obstetrics until such time as [Dr. Osman] provides proof\r\n  that is satisfactory to the Board that she has appropriate education and\r\n  training in this area.\r\n\r\nThis sanction fits\r\n  squarely within the parameters of the Boardâ€™s statutory authority.Â  Therefore,\r\n  the ALC erred when it struck the reestablishment provision after improperly\r\n  finding the Board did not have the authority to levy this sanction.Â  We note,\r\n  however, were Dr. Osman to provide the Board with proof of her competence, the\r\n  decision to find this proof to be satisfactory should be made objectively and\r\n  reasonably.Â  Approval cannot be unreasonably withheld.\r\nAs the Board did\r\n  not exceed its statutory authority in imposing this sanction, we reverse the ALC on this issue and reinstate the competency reestablishment provision.[1]\r\nIII.\r\nDr. Osmanâ€™s Appeal\r\nIn\r\n  her cross-appeal, Dr. Osman argues the ALC erred in imposing a public reprimand\r\n  and responsibility for the costs of the proceedings because her actions did not\r\n  violate the rules of ethical conduct and there is no substantial evidence in\r\n  the record to support these sanctions.Â  We disagree as there is substantial\r\n  evidence to support the Boardâ€™s findings.\r\nA party aggrieved\r\n  by the decision of the Board may appeal to the ALC.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-1-160\r\n  (2001).Â  The review is governed by section 1-23-380 of the Administrative Procedures\r\n  Act (APA).Â  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing &amp; Regulation\r\n    v. Girgis, 332 S.C. 162, 166, 503 S.E.2d 490, 491-92 (Ct. App. 1998).Â \r\n  Under the APA, the reviewing court may not substitute its judgment for that of\r\n  the agency on questions of fact, but may reverse the agencyâ€™s decision if the\r\n  decision is clearly erroneous in view of the substantial evidence.Â  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. Â§ 1-23-380(5) (Supp. 2008).\r\nHere, Dr. Osman, in\r\n  a letter to the Board, agreed with three of the Boardâ€™s allegations: use of a\r\n  hospital with inadequate resources, failure to ensure proper surgical backup,\r\n  and failure to provide written informed consent.Â  Specifically, Dr. Osman\r\n  agreed, â€œit was inappropriate . . . to perform a primary C-Section in a\r\n  community county hospital setting without adequate resources immediately\r\n  available, i.e.: blood products and surgical backup.â€Â  Additionally, Dr. Osman\r\n  agreed that she â€œfailed to have surgery stand-by at the bedside in the event\r\n  that hysterectomy became necessary.Â  When Dr. Ross was called by [Dr. Osman] .\r\n  . . it was learned that Dr. Ross was away on vacation and not available.Â \r\n  Therefore, Dr. Osman essentially had no surgical backup in the event that a\r\n  hysterectomy became necessary.â€Â  Lastly, Dr. Osman agreed she â€œdeviated from\r\n  the appropriate standard of care by failing to provide written informed consent\r\n  to [a] patient . . . as to the possible complications and difficulties which\r\n  can occur with C-Section in a patient with placenta previa.â€\r\nAlthough\r\n  Dr. Osman disputed the many other allegations made by the Board in the\r\n  complaint, Dr. Osmanâ€™s three concessions constitute substantial evidence in\r\n  support of the Boardâ€™s actions.Â  Further, the Disciplinary Panel for the Board\r\n  and the Board both limited the finding of misconduct to the three admitted\r\n  deviations from the standard of care.\r\nWhen\r\n  reviewing the Boardâ€™s opinion, the ALC observed:Â  â€œThe Boardâ€™s public reprimand\r\n  of [Dr. Osman] for her lack of good judgment is well within its sanctioning\r\n  authority under Section 40-47-200,[2] and [Dr. Osman] has not demonstrated that, in exercising that authority, the\r\n  Board acted arbitrarily or discriminatorily.â€Â  The ALC concluded that Dr. Osman\r\n  â€œha[d] not established any sufficient grounds upon which to disturb the\r\n  sanction imposed by the Board.â€\r\nWe\r\n  agree with the conclusion of the ALC that substantial evidence supports the\r\n  Boardâ€™s decision.Â  While we recognize Dr. Osmanâ€™s overall competence and her\r\n  understandable desire to avoid the public reprimand, the sanction imposed by\r\n  the Board is well within the Boardâ€™s statutory authority.Â  Because Dr. Osman\r\n  has shown no basis for overturning the Boardâ€™s decision, we affirm this issue.\r\nIV.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the ALCâ€™s holding that substantial evidence supports the public\r\n  reprimand and costs.Â  We reverse the ALCâ€™s striking of the reestablishment of\r\n  competency provision, and we reinstate the provision.Â  The judgment of the ALC\r\n  is \r\nAFFIRMED IN\r\n  PART; REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  WALLER, PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]Â \r\n  The Board also disputed whether Dr. Osman initially appealed the imposition of\r\n  the competency provision to the ALC. Â The Board therefore argued the ALC\r\n  improperly struck the provision sua sponte. Â Dr. Osman seized upon this\r\n  allegation and countered that if the competency provision were not part of her\r\n  appeal from the Board, then the Board failed to preserve this issue in a motion\r\n  for reconsideration. Â Upon careful review and a fair reading of the record, we\r\n  hold this issue was properly preserved for our review.\r\n[2]Â  The ALC cited section 40-47-200 of the South\r\n  Carolina Code (Supp. 2005).Â  This section has been amended and a similar\r\n  provision that allows the Board to order additional training is now found at\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 40-47-120(A) (Supp. 2008).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26642","title":"State v.

Â State v. White, 372 S.C. 364, 642 S.E.2d 607 (Ct. App. 2007).Â  We affirm the court of appeals in result.\r\nI.\r\nThis case arises from an armed robbery of a convenience\r\n  store in Columbia, South Carolina.Â  After midnight on April 19, 2004, Gary\r\n  White and Anthony Morris were riding in a car driven by Roy Wiggins.Â  As\r\n  Wiggins drove past a convenience store, White told Wiggins to turn around and\r\n  go back to the store.Â  Wiggins complied.Â  Wiggins drove to the store and parked\r\n  behind it.Â  White and Morris exited the car, with Wiggins staying behind in the\r\n  driverâ€™s seat.Â  White was carrying a gun.Â  \r\nWhite and Morris\r\n  entered the convenience store.Â  Gwen Anthony, the store manager, was restocking\r\n  the grill area when White and Morris entered suddenly.Â  Anthony described the\r\n  robbersâ€™ entry as a â€œflash.â€Â  \r\nWhite, armed with\r\n  the gun, grabbed Anthony, put his arm around her, and pointed the gun to her\r\n  neck.Â  Morris moved through the store stealing cash, lottery tickets and an\r\n  18-pack of beer while White continued to hold Anthony at gunpoint.Â  While Morris\r\n  was at the beer cooler, White, while standing up, apparently lost\r\n  consciousness. Â \r\nAnthony testified that\r\n  Whiteâ€™s head fell to her shoulder, and the gun dropped from her neck.Â  Although\r\n  he was unconscious for only a few seconds, Anthony observed that Whiteâ€™s breath\r\n  smelled like alcohol, his gun was black with a silver top, and his jeans were\r\n  baggy and dark in color.Â  With the 18-pack of beer in hand, Morris ran up the\r\n  aisle toward the door and screamed at White, waking him.Â  White, still holding Anthony,\r\n  returned the gun to her neck and began to move toward the door, forcing her to\r\n  accompany him.Â  As they exited the store, White pushed Anthony away and ran in\r\n  the opposite direction.Â  At that very moment, Officer Rouppasong of the\r\n  Columbia Police Department pulled into the store parking lot on a routine\r\n  break.Â  \r\nUpon his arrival on\r\n  the scene, Officer Rouppasong saw two people: Anthony, waving and flagging him\r\n  down and another person running away from the store.Â  Rouppasong described the\r\n  man he saw running as a black male, wearing a white t-shirt and dark colored\r\n  pants, holding or carrying something in one of his hands.Â  Rouppasong remained\r\n  in his vehicle and followed White.Â  As he followed him around the corner of the\r\n  store, Rouppasong saw a car parked on the street.Â  Rouppasong saw a black male\r\n  (later identified as White) exit the car on the passenger side and flee.Â  Rouppasong\r\n  did not give chase; instead, he stayed with the vehicle and Wiggins.Â  Officer\r\n  Gunter, with the K9 unit, was called to the scene to search for the suspect.Â  \r\nOfficer Gunter\r\n  arrived on the scene approximately thirty minutes after the robbery.Â  Once\r\n  there, Rouppasong relayed the necessary information that allowed Gunter to know\r\n  where to initiate the track. Â Gunter and his tracking dog, Aurie, began\r\n  tracking and soon found White nearby sleeping next to some bushes, gun in hand.Â \r\n  Rouppasong testified that the man he saw lying by the bushes, asleep, was the\r\n  same man he saw exiting the store and fleeing the crime scene.Â  There were two\r\n  other in-court eyewitness identifications of White.Â  Wiggins testified that\r\n  White left his car with a gun, returned to his car a short time later, and then\r\n  fled when police arrived.Â  The second identification came from Morris.\r\nWhite was convicted\r\n  of two counts of armed robbery and kidnapping; he was sentenced to life without\r\n  parole.[1]Â \r\n  The court of appeals affirmed, rejecting the contention that dog tracking evidence\r\n  must satisfy the standard for â€œscientific basedâ€ expert testimony under State\r\n    v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979).Â  The court of appeals noted\r\n  a distinction between two types of expert testimony, â€œscientific evidence\r\n  versus experience-based knowledge.â€ Â White, 372 S.C. at 381, 642 S.E.2d\r\n  at 615.Â  With regard to nonscientific expert testimony (which includes dog\r\n  tracking evidence), the court of appeals found that â€œquestions about the reliability\r\n  of [the dog handler] go only to the weight [of his testimony], but not\r\n  admissibility.â€Â  Id. at 376, 642 S.E.2d at 613.Â  Because of the\r\n  suggestion that an initial determination of reliability is not part of the\r\n  trial courtâ€™s gatekeeping role, we granted Whiteâ€™s petition for a writ of\r\n  certiorari.[2]Â Â  \r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nA trial courtâ€™s decision to admit or exclude expert\r\n  testimony will not be reversed absent a prejudicial abuse of discretion.Â  State\r\n    v. Price, 368 S.C. 494, 498, 629 S.E.2d 363, 365 (2006).Â  \r\nWhite concedes the dog handler met the Rule 702, SCRE, qualifications\r\n  due to his experience and training.[3]Â \r\n  White contends the trial court failed in its gatekeeping role to vet the\r\n  reliability of the dogâ€™s tracking skills, thus leaving the jury to speculate\r\n  about the dogâ€™s reliability.Â  We agree with Whiteâ€™s premise that all expert\r\n  testimony under Rule 702, SCRE, imposes on the trial courts an affirmative and\r\n  meaningful gatekeeping duty.Â  To the extent the court of appeals opinion may be\r\n  construed as excluding a gatekeeping role for trial courts in connection with nonscientific\r\n  (or experienced based)[4] expert testimony, such construction is rejected.\r\nAll expert testimony must satisfy the Rule 702 criteria, and that\r\n  includes the trial courtâ€™s gatekeeping function in ensuring the proposed expert\r\n  testimony meets a reliability threshold for the juryâ€™s ultimate consideration.Â \r\n  Rule 702 provides:\r\n\r\n\tIf scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will\r\n  assist the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in\r\n  issue, a witness qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience,\r\n  training, or education, may testify thereto in the form of an opinion or\r\n  otherwise.\r\n\r\nâ€œThis language\r\n  makes no relevant distinction between â€˜scientificâ€™ knowledge and â€˜technicalâ€™ or\r\n  â€˜other specializedâ€™ knowledge.Â  It makes clear that any such knowledge might\r\n  become the subject of expert testimony. . . .Â  Hence, as a matter of language,\r\n  the Rule applies its reliability standard to all â€˜scientific,â€™ â€˜technical,â€™ or\r\n  â€˜other specializedâ€™ matters within its scope.â€Â  Kumho Tire Co., Ltd. v.\r\n    Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137, 147 (1999).Â  Reliability is a central feature of\r\n  Rule 702 admissibility, and our jurisprudence is in complete accord.Â  State\r\n    v. Jones, 343 S.C. 562, 572, 541 S.E.2d 813, 818 (2001) (finding error in\r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit â€œunreliableâ€ expert evidence); State v.\r\n    Council, 335 S.C. 1, 20, 515 S.E.2d 508, 518 (1999) (noting that before\r\n  expert evidence is admitted the trial court must determine it is reliable). \r\nWith regard to dog tracking evidence, this Courtâ€™s jurisprudence (even\r\n  prior to the adoption of the South Carolina Rules of Evidence in 1995) speaks\r\n  to the reliability foundational requirement of such evidence.Â  State v.\r\n    Childs, 299 S.C. 471, 476-77, 385 S.E.2d 839, 842-43 (1989) (finding no\r\n  abuse of discretion in trial courtâ€™s admission of dog tracking testimony where a\r\n  deputy sheriff had â€œâ€˜runâ€™â€ bloodhounds for eleven years and finding of\r\n  reliability supported by â€œdogs . . . characteristics of acuteness in scent as\r\n  well as the power of discrimination between human and other scentsâ€); State\r\n    v. Brown, 103 S.C. 437, 444, 88 S.E. 21, 23 (1916) (finding trial courtâ€™s\r\n  admission of dog tracking evidence constituted an abuse of discretion where\r\n  evidence established that the dog tracking occurred outside the â€œperiod of\r\n  efficiencyâ€ and was therefore unreliable).Â Â  Â \r\nWhile we agree with White concerning the important gatekeeping\r\n  role of the trial court in determining the admissibility of expert testimony\r\n  under Rule 702, the trial court properly discharged its duty in this case.Â  As\r\n  noted, White concedes the qualifications of Officer Gunter as a dog handler.Â \r\n  Whiteâ€™s argument is that the dog tracking evidence is unreliable.Â  The trial\r\n  court permitted a thorough examination of all matters relating to\r\n  admissibility, including reliability. \r\nBeyond Officer Gunterâ€™s extensive training and experience, there\r\n  was ample evidence concerning the training and reliability of the dog, Aurie.Â \r\n  Aurie is a German shepherd that descended from a bloodline of known police and\r\n  military working dogs.Â  Through testing, Aurie has been certified in several\r\n  areas of tracking, yet Aurieâ€™s strongest skill is tracking people.Â  Officer\r\n  Gunter and Aurie, as of the trial, had been â€œpartnersâ€ in excess of seven years\r\n  and had accomplished approximately 750 tracks together.Â  The finding of\r\n  reliability is well supported by the record, and we find no abuse of discretion\r\n  in the admission of the dog tracking evidence.\r\nIn addition to the trial courtâ€™s discharge of its gatekeeping role\r\n  in assessing the admissibility of the dog tracking evidence, the court properly\r\n  instructed the jury that â€œyou are to give his testimony such weight and\r\n  credibility as you deem appropriate as you will with any and all witnesses that\r\n  will testify in this trial.â€\r\nB.\r\nThe court of appeals is commended for its thorough analysis of our\r\n  countryâ€™s jurisprudence concerning dog tracking evidence.Â  While foundational\r\n  requirements vary, â€œan overwhelming number [of jurisdictions] allow admission\r\n  of dog tracking evidence in a criminal case to prove identity.â€Â  White,\r\n  372 S.C. at 378, 642 S.E.2d at 614.Â  To provide uniformity, we think it\r\n  advisable to adopt the following evidentiary framework to guide our bench and\r\n  bar concerning dog tracking evidence.Â  By extrapolating from our case law and\r\n  other authorities, we conclude a sufficient foundation for the admission of dog\r\n  tracking evidence is established if (1) the\r\n  evidence shows the dog handler satisfies the qualifications of an expert under\r\n  Rule 702; (2) the evidence shows the dog is of a breed characterized by an\r\n  acute power of scent; (3) the dog has been trained to follow a trail by scent;\r\n  (4) by experience the dog is found to be reliable; (5) the dog was placed on\r\n  the trail where the suspect was known to have been within a reasonable time;\r\n  and (6) the trail was not otherwise contaminated. &nbsp;See State v. Childs, 299 S.C. at 476-77, 385 S.E.2d at 842-43; State v. Brown, 103 S.C. at 443-45, 88 S.E. at 22-23; see also State\r\n    v. Taylor, 447 S.E.2d 360, 368-69 (N.C. 1994); Jay M. Zitter, Annotation, Evidence of Trailing by\r\n      Dogs in Criminal Cases, 81 A.L.R. 5th 563 (2000).\r\nC.\r\nThe case before us may appear straightforward, especially in light\r\n  of the overwhelming evidence of guilt.Â  Yet on appeal the State has persisted\r\n  with the argument that reliability need not be shown for the admission of\r\n  nonscientific expert testimony.Â  Because the court of appeals in this case has\r\n  approvingly cited State v. Morgan, 326 S.C. 503, 485 S.E.2d 112 (Ct. App.\r\n  1997) in support of the Stateâ€™s position, we believe clarification of the\r\n  analytical framework for the admissibility of nonscientific expert testimony is\r\n  warranted.\r\nAt oral argument, the State argued this Court need not concern\r\n  itself with the issue of reliability because the case only involves\r\n  nonscientific expert testimony.Â  Presumably, the State relies on the court of\r\n  appealsâ€™ decision in State v. Morgan, which held â€œ[i]f the expertâ€™s opinion does not fall within [the] Jones[5] [standard for scientific expert testimony], questions about the reliability of\r\n  an expertâ€™s methods go only to the weight, but not admissibility, of the\r\n  testimony.â€ Morgan, 326 S.C. at 513, 485 S.E.2d at 118.Â  This is an\r\n  incorrect statement of law.Â  \r\nWe\r\n  overrule Morgan to the extent it suggests that only scientific expert\r\n  testimony must pass a threshold reliability determination by the trial court\r\n  prior to its admission in evidence.[6]Â \r\n  The familiar tenet of evidence law that a continuing challenge to evidence goes\r\n  to â€œweight, not admissibilityâ€ has never been intended to supplant the\r\n  gatekeeping role of the trial court in the first instance in assessing the\r\n  admissibility of expert testimony, including the threshold determination of\r\n  reliability.Â  Nonscientific expert testimony must satisfy Rule 702, both in\r\n  terms of expert qualifications and reliability of the subject matter.\r\nCourts\r\n  are often presented with challenges on both frontsâ€”qualifications and\r\n  reliability.Â  The party offering the expert must establish that his witness has\r\n  the necessary qualifications in terms of â€œknowledge, skill, experience,\r\n  training or education.â€ Â Rule 702, SCRE.Â  With respect to qualifications, a\r\n  witness may satisfy the Rule 702 threshold yet the opponent may still challenge\r\n  the amount or quality of the qualifications.Â  It is in this latter context that\r\n  the trial court properly concludes that â€œdefects in the amount and quality of\r\n  education or experience go to the weight to be accorded the expertâ€™s testimony\r\n  and not its admissibility.â€ State v. Myers, 301 S.C. 251, 256, 391\r\n  S.E.2d 551, 554 (1990). Â Turning to the reliability factor, a trial court may\r\n  ultimately take the same approach, but only after making a threshold\r\n  determination for purposes of admissibility.\r\nState\r\n  v. Council, 335 S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508 (1999) is often cited for the gatekeeping role of the trial\r\n  court with regard to expert testimony under Rule 702, as well as the standard\r\n  reliability factors for scientific evidence.[7]Â \r\n  The foundational reliability requirement for expert testimony does not lend\r\n  itself to a one-size-fits-all approach, for the Council factors for scientific\r\n  evidence serve no useful analytical purpose when evaluating nonscientific\r\n  expert testimony.Â  We have set forth above foundational requirements for Rule\r\n  702 expert testimony concerning dog tracking evidence.\r\nWe\r\n  do not pretend to know the myriad of Rule 702 qualification and reliability\r\n  challenges that could arise with respect to nonscientific expert evidence.Â \r\n  Consequently, we offer no formulaic approach that will apply in the generality\r\n  of cases.Â  Yet the trial court in the discharge of its gatekeeping role in\r\n  determining admissibility must initially answer the always present threshold\r\n  questions of qualification and reliability.\r\nIII.\r\nWe\r\n  hold that the trial courts of this state have a gatekeeping role with respect\r\n  to all evidence sought to be admitted under Rule 702, whether the evidence is\r\n  scientific or nonscientific.Â  In the discharge of its gatekeeping role, a trial\r\n  court must assess the threshold foundational requirements of qualifications and\r\n  reliability and further find that the proposed evidence will assist the trier\r\n  of fact.Â  The familiar evidentiary mantra that a challenge to evidence goes to\r\n  â€œweight, not admissibilityâ€ may be invoked only after the trial court has\r\n  vetted the matters of qualifications and reliability and admitted the evidence.\r\nWe\r\n  affirm the court of appeals in result.Â  The trial court properly discharged its\r\n  gatekeeping role in assessing the dog tracking evidence under Rule 702, as to\r\n  qualifications and reliability.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN RESULT.Â  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., WALLER, PLEICONES, JJ., and Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]&nbsp; Whiteâ€™s criminal history triggered a life without parole sentence\r\n  pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003).\r\n[2]&nbsp; White also asked the court of appeals to grant him a new trial based on\r\n  newly discovered evidence.Â  It appears the new trial motion was not presented\r\n  to the trial court.Â  Moreover, White did not ask the court of appeals to remand\r\n  the new trial motion to the trial court.Â  See State v. Mercer, 381 S.C.\r\n  149, 165-66, 672 S.E.2d 556, 564-65 (2009) (recognizing that a motion for a new\r\n  trial based upon after discovered evidence must be presented to the trial court\r\n  in the first instance).Â  The court of appeals declined to address the issue\r\n  â€œbecause it ha[d] not been raised to and ruled on by the trial court and [wa]s\r\n  not properly before th[e] court.â€Â  White, 372 S.C. at 387, 642 S.E.2d at\r\n  619.Â  We affirm the court of appeals on this issue.Â  Rule 220(b)(1), SCACR.Â \r\n  The disposition of this issue is without prejudice to White seeking such relief\r\n  in the trial court.\r\n[3]&nbsp; There is likewise no challenge to the Rule 702 criteria that the\r\n  evidence â€œwill assist the trier of fact to understand\r\n  the evidence or to determine a fact in issue.â€ \r\n[4]&nbsp; We note that case law uses the terms nonscientific expert testimony and\r\n  experienced based expert testimony interchangeably.Â  For consistency, we will\r\n  use the term nonscientific expert testimony.\r\n[5]&nbsp; State v. Jones, 273 S.C. 723, 259 S.E.2d 120 (1979).\r\n[6]&nbsp; Morgan relies on this Courtâ€™s opinions in State v. Schumpert,\r\n  312 S.C. 502, 435 S.E.2d 859 (1993) and State v. Whaley, 305 S.C. 138,\r\n  406 S.E.2d 369 (1991) to support its finding that only scientific expert\r\n  testimony includes reliability as part of the foundation for admission in\r\n  evidence.Â  Schumpert and Whaley stand for no such proposition.Â  Schumpert addressed the qualifications of a proposed mental health professional and her\r\n  ability to give expert testimony on rape trauma syndrome.Â  Whaley dealt\r\n  with the admissibility of a proposed expert in eyewitness identifications.Â \r\n  Because the area of expertise was â€œdistinguishable from â€˜scientificâ€™ evidence,â€\r\n  the State v. Jones scientific framework was not appropriate.Â  Whaley,\r\n  305 S.C. at 142, 406 S.E.2d at 371-72.Â  The Whaley Court further\r\n  observed, â€œ[a]lthough we are of the opinion that this type of testimony need\r\n  not be subjected to the Jones test, we reject any contention that it\r\n  does not comport with Jones.â€Â  Id. at 142 n.2, 406 S.E.2d at 372\r\n  n.2.Â Â  Whaley then proceeded to analyze the matter of reliability and\r\n  held, in the factual context presented, the trial court abused its discretion\r\n  by excluding the expertâ€™s testimony.Â  Id. at 143, 406 S.E.2d at 372.Â  In\r\n  short, neither Schumpert nor Whaley contains the slightest hint\r\n  that a trial court may ignore the question of reliability when considering the\r\n  admissibility of nonscientific expert testimony. \r\n[7]&nbsp; The State v. Council factors for scientific expert testimony are: (1) the\r\n  publications and peer review of the technique; (2) prior application of the\r\n  method to the type of evidence involved in the case; (3) the quality control\r\n  procedures used to ensure reliability; and (4) the consistency of the method\r\n  with recognized scientific laws and procedures.Â  \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26643","title":"In the Matter of Clyde A.
