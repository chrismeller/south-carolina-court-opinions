Blackmon, of Sumter, pro se.\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The Office of Disciplinary Counsel \r\n  (ODC) and respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct \r\n  and agrees to either a public reprimand or definite suspension not to exceed \r\n  thirty (30) days.Â  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The \r\n  facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn March 1998, complainant retained an attorney to represent \r\n  her in a child support and custody action.Â  Following that attorneyâ€™s suspension \r\n  from the practice of law, complainant consulted with respondent about assuming \r\n  representation.Â  Respondent agreed to accept the case in October 1998.Â  The \r\n  action filed by the original attorney was administratively stricken from the \r\n  roster in November 1998.Â  \r\nRespondent obtained an order restoring the case to the \r\n  roster and requested a hearing.Â  The hearing was scheduled for October 1999, \r\n  but the matter was continued because respondent was required to appear in another \r\n  court.Â  Respondent filed amended pleadings in November 1999, adding claims for \r\n  divorce and equitable distribution.\r\nOther than an attempt to serve the defendant with the amended \r\n  pleadings, respondent took no action for nearly sixteen months.Â  Respondent \r\n  did not file for a new hearing until March 2001.Â  By that time, however, the \r\n  case had been administratively stricken from the roster for a second time. \r\nRespondent did not communicate with complainant from \r\n  November 1999 until June 2002.Â  Respondent took no further action on complainantâ€™s \r\n  behalf until he received notice of the grievance in June 2002.Â  He subsequently \r\n  had the case restored to the roster and secured a hearing date.Â  Prior to the \r\n  hearing, complainant contacted respondent and informed him that all issues with \r\n  her husband had been resolved and that she wanted her case dismissed.Â  Respondent \r\n  has now completed the case and has neither charged nor accepted a fee.Â  \r\nRespondent is a solo practitioner.Â  He acknowledges \r\n  he did not have adequate case management and calendaring systems and procedures \r\n  in place at the time of his representation of complainant.Â  Respondent represents \r\n  that he has since completed a thorough review and assessment of his office management \r\n  practices with attorney Steedley Bogan who has assisted him in updating and \r\n  improving the processes through which his cases are handled.Â  Respondent represents \r\n  that he is now taking steps to ensure, to the best of his ability, that similar \r\n  problems will not occur in the future.Â Â  \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent acknowledges that his misconduct constitutes \r\n  grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, \r\n  Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline \r\n  for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Respondent admits that \r\n  by his misconduct he has violated the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, \r\n  SCACR, particularly Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and \r\n  promptness in representing a client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall keep client reasonably \r\n  informed about status of a matter and promptly comply with reasonable requests \r\n  for information); Rule 3.2 (lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to expedite \r\n  litigation consistent with interests of the client); and 8.4(a) (it is professional \r\n  misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Misconduct).Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants a public \r\n  reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and \r\n  publicly reprimand respondent for his misconduct.\r\n PUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., not participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25904","title":"Glover v.

Ferrara, of North \r\n  Charleston, for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER: Appellants, [1]  property owners in Charleston \r\n  County, brought this action alleging the Countyâ€™s newly implemented Unified \r\n  Development Ordinance (UDO) effectively re-zoned their property, depriving them \r\n  of due process and equal protection, and resulting in a taking of their property \r\n  without just compensation.Â  The trial court granted summary judgment to respondents \r\n  (collectively County).Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1994, the General Assembly passed \r\n  the South Carolina Local Government Comprehensive Planning Enabling Act of 1994 \r\n  requiring local governments to develop a comprehensive planning plan.Â  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 6-9-310 through Â§ 6-29-1200 (2004).Â  Pursuant to the act, Charleston \r\n  County formed a Joint Planning Policy Committee which, between 1997-1998, held \r\n  fifteen advertised public meetings to solicit input on the development of the \r\n  Charleston County Comprehensive Plan (Plan).Â  In conjunction with adoption of \r\n  the Plan, [2]  County referred a Unified Development \r\n  Ordinance (UDO) to the newly created Charleston County Planning Commission for \r\n  review.Â  \r\nThe Planning Commission recommended several \r\n  amendments to the UDO.Â  Thereafter, County Council advertised in the local newspaper \r\n  and held numerous public hearings between June and November 2000.Â  As a result \r\n  of the hearings, Council approved various amendments to the UDO in February \r\n  2001.Â  In November 2001, after three additional public hearings and 40,000 notices \r\n  were sent to property owners, Council adopted the UDO by Ordinance No. 1202.Â  \r\n\r\nIn November 2000, prior to adoption of \r\n  Ordinance No. 1202, appellants filed a complaint challenging the proposed \r\n  UDO.Â  The complaint sought an injunction and alleged the proposed UDO would \r\n  â€œreclassifyâ€ every parcel of real estate in the unincorporated areas of the \r\n  county.Â  Appellants maintained the alleged â€œreclassificationâ€ was accomplished \r\n  without conspicuous notice which they contended was required by S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 6-9-760 (2004).Â  The complaint further alleged due process and equal protection \r\n  violations, and that the UDO effected an unconstitutional taking of their property. [3] Â  \r\nBoth sides moved for summary judgment.Â  After \r\n  a hearing, Judge Rawl granted summary judgment to County.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting summary judgment to County?\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nSummary judgment is appropriate only \r\n  if there is no genuine issue of material fact and the moving party is entitled \r\n  to judgment as a matter of law.Â  Cunningham ex rel. Grice v. Helping Hands, \r\n  Inc., 352 S.C. 485, 575 S.E.2d 549 (2003).Â  In determining whether any triable \r\n  issues of fact exist for summary judgment purposes, the evidence and all inferences \r\n  which can be reasonably drawn from the evidence must be viewed in the light \r\n  most favorable to the nonmoving party. Id.Â  The opposing party may not \r\n  rest upon mere allegations, but must respond with specific facts showing a genuine \r\n  issue.Â  City of Columbia v. Town of Irmo, 316 S.C. 193, 447 S.E.2d 855 \r\n  (1994).Â  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\n  a.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lack of notice  \r\nInitially, Appellants assert they were denied due process because they were \r\n  not provided with conspicuous notice as required by S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 6-29-760 \r\n  (2004), which provides, in pertinent part:\r\nBefore enacting or amending any zoning regulations \r\n  or maps, the governing authority or the planning commission, if authorized by \r\n  the governing authority, shall hold a public hearing on it, which must be advertised \r\n  and conducted according to lawfully prescribed procedures.Â  If no established \r\n  procedures exist, then at least fifteen days' notice of the time and place \r\n  of the public hearing must be given in a newspaper of general circulation \r\n  in the municipality or county.Â  In cases involving rezoning, conspicuous \r\n  notice shall be posted on or adjacent to the property affected, with at \r\n  least one such notice being visible from each public thoroughfare that abuts \r\n  the property.Â  (emphasis supplied).Â  \r\nWe find Countyâ€™s adoption of \r\n  the UDO was merely the enactment of an ordinance, such that the newspaper publication \r\n  was sufficient.Â  Contrary to appellantsâ€™ contention, this simply was not a rezoning.Â  \r\n  Accordingly,Â  â€œconspicuousâ€ notice by posting was not required.Â  State v. \r\n  Blackmon, 304 S.C. 270, 273, 403 S.E.2d 660, 662 (1991) (when terms of statute \r\n  are clear and unambiguous, court must apply them according to their literal \r\n  meaning.Â  Furthermore, in construing a statute, words must be given their plain \r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit \r\n  or expand the statute's operation).Â Â Â  \r\nAppellantsâ€™ reliance upon the \r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Brown v. County of Charleston, 303 S.C. \r\n  245, 399 S.E.2d 784 (Ct. App. 1990) is misplaced.Â  In Brown, the Court \r\n  of Appeals dealt with the effect of a zoning amendment which changed the plaintiffâ€™s \r\n  right to operate an outdoor gun range from a use of right to a use which required \r\n  a permit.Â  The Court of Appeals noted it was uncontested that the manner \r\n  of notice in that case, i.e., newspaper publication, complied with the statutory \r\n  requirements concerning time, place, and manner.Â  303 S.C. at 247, 399 S.E.2d \r\n  at 785.Â  The Court went on to hold, however, that the published newspaper advertisement \r\n  lacked sufficient specificity to warn the plaintiff he could be affected by \r\n  the amendments.Â  Accordingly, finding no evidence the plaintiff had either constructive \r\n  or actual notice of the character of the action posed, the Court of Appeals \r\n  found the amendment void.\r\nBrown is simply inapposite.Â  \r\n  Appellants here have not challenged the sufficiency of the notice published \r\n  in the newspaper.Â  On the contrary, they claim only that they were entitled \r\n  to â€œconspicuous noticeâ€ via posting.Â  Further, it is patent that each of the \r\n  plaintiffs had actual notice of the proposed UDO, as evidenced by the \r\n  fact that they brought suit in November 2000, they attended public hearings \r\n  on the matter, and at least one appellant, Glover, received one of the 40,000 \r\n  mailed notices concerning the UDO.Â  We find appellantsâ€™ actual notice sufficient.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, the trial court properly found no due process or equal protection \r\n  violations resulted from the alleged lack of notice.\r\nb.Â  Unconstitutional Taking\r\nAppellants next assert \r\n  the trial court improperly granted summary judgment on their takings claims.Â  \r\n  We disagree.Â  \r\nIf a land-use regulation \r\n  substantially advances legitimate government interests and does not deny the \r\n  owner of all economically viable use of his land, it does not constitute a taking.Â  \r\n  Westside Quik Shop, Inc. v. Stewart, 341 S.C. 297, 305-06, 534 \r\n  S.E.2d 270, 274, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 1029 (2000).Â  Regulatory delay \r\n  does not normally give rise to a temporary taking claim.Â  First English Evangelical \r\n  Lutheran Church v. Los Angeles County, 482 U.S. 304 (1987).Â  â€œSimilarly, \r\n  although a property owner who successfully challenges the applicability of a \r\n  governmental regulation is likely to have suffered some temporary harm during \r\n  the process, the harm does not give rise to a constitutional taking.â€Â  Sea \r\n  Cabins v. City of North Myrtle Beach, 345 S.C. 418, 36, 548 S.E.2d 595, \r\n  604 (2001).Â  Moreover, a zoning classification is not unconstitutional simply \r\n  because a developer is deprived of a more profitable use of his property.Â  Bear \r\n  Enterprises v. County of Greenville, 319 S.C. 137, 459 S.E.2d 883 (Ct. App. \r\n  1995).Â Â Â  \r\nWe find no evidence \r\n  of a taking in this case.Â  Appellants simply have not demonstrated that they \r\n  were, even temporarily, denied all economically viable use of their land.Â  Appellantsâ€™ \r\n  complaint alleges only that they can not sell their property for fair market \r\n  value, and that the ordinance severely restricts subdivision.Â  It is patent \r\n  appellants have not been denied all economically viable use of their land, such \r\n  that the trial court properly granted summary judgment on their takings claim.Â Â  \r\n  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 (2002) (summary judgment \r\n  is proper when there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and the moving \r\n  party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law).Â  \r\n  c.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Equal Protection/Wealth \r\n  based classification  \r\nAppellants next \r\n  assert County divided all of the citizens in the unincorporated areas of Charleston \r\n  into unlawful racial groups, in violation of equal protection.Â  This argument \r\n  was first raised at the summary judgment hearing, and was quite different from \r\n  the allegations of their complaint, which essentially alleged it was an equal \r\n  protection violation to treat people in unincorporated areas differently than \r\n  those in corporate limits, and that the ordinance required those people in unincorporated \r\n  areas to spend exorbitant sums to comply with the UDO.Â  Further, the circuit \r\n  court did not specifically rule on appellantsâ€™ assertions concerning the â€œsettlement \r\n  areas.â€ Accordingly, this argument is not preserved for review.Â Â Â  State \r\n  v. 192 Coin-Operated Video Game Machines, 338 S.C. 176, 525 S.E.2d 872 (2000) \r\n  (equal protection argument not preserved for review where lower court did not \r\n  address it and appellant did not raise it in motion to reconsider). \r\nMoreover, there is simply no \r\n  evidence in the record bearing out appellantsâ€™ assertions that the ordinance \r\n  is based upon impermissible race or wealth-based classifications.Â  We find summary \r\n  judgment was properly granted.\r\nThe judgment below is \r\n AFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Â Joseph Glover died during the pendency of this \r\n    appeal.Â  His estate was never substituted as a party such that neither he, \r\n    nor his sister Emily Gaillard, no longer have any interest in this case.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] Â  The Plan was adopted by Ordinance No. 1095 in \r\n    April 1999.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Â  According to the parties and the circuit courtâ€™s \r\n    order, Judge Lockemy granted a temporary injunction in July 2001; however, \r\n    the court stayed the order for ninety days in order for the County to either \r\n    adopt the ordinance or stop enforcing the UDO.Â  Before the order was signed, \r\n    appellants withdrew their motion for a preliminary injunction, and the court \r\n    rescinded its prior order.Â  County then adopted the ordinance on November \r\n    20, 2001.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25905","title":"In re: Estate of Prioleau","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25905","description":"In this case, the Court held the probate judge erred in interpreting the words â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ in two wills to include those grandchildren born after the testatorâ€™s death but prior to distribution.","date":"2004-12-06","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\nPrioleau\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn re: Estate of Roberta Maybank Prioleau and Estate of William F.\r\nPrioleau.\r\nMs. Elizabeth deRosset Prioleau, Petitioner,\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nv.\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nMr. William F.

Prioleau (William) and Roberta Maybank \r\n  Prioleau (Roberta). Roberta died on September 24, 1995, and William died on \r\n  January 27, 1997.Â Â  In each of their wills, the Prioleaus provided that a share \r\n  of his/her estate was to be given to their â€œthen-living grandchildren.â€Â  \r\nSpecifically, Roberta divided her residual estate \r\n  into two shares:Â  Share A was to go to William if he survived her and was drafted \r\n  in a manner to take advantage of the maximum tax deduction in a marital share; \r\n  and Share BÂ  was to be divided into five equal shares with one share going to \r\n  each of the coupleâ€™s four children and one share to the coupleâ€™s â€œthen-living \r\n  grandchildren.â€ Further, Share B was to be held and administered as the Prioleau \r\n  Family Trust until distribution which was to occur after the deaths of both \r\n  Roberta and William. Williamâ€™s will, executed after the death of Roberta,Â  has \r\n  a similar provision with Shares A-1 and B-1.Â  It is unclear to whom Share A-1 \r\n  was to be given. [1] Â Â  Apparently, \r\n  as a result of the failure of Share A-1 in Williamâ€™s will, the entire residual \r\n  estate is now to pass as Share B-1 to the coupleâ€™s children and the â€œthen-living \r\n  grandchildren.â€Â  Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nElizabeth Prioleau (Elizabeth) is co-personal representative \r\n  along with her brother William F. Prioleau, Jr. (Will) for their father Williamâ€™s \r\n  estate. [2] Â Â  Subsequent to Williamâ€™s \r\n  death,Â  two grandchildren were born -- one on August 17, 1998, and the other \r\n  on July 7, 2000. [3] Â  After the second grandchild \r\n  was born, Elizabeth petitioned the probate court for an order regarding the \r\n  phrase â€œthen-living grandchildren.â€ The probate court appointed two guardians \r\n  ad litem, one for the grandchildren born after Williamâ€™s death and the other \r\n  for those grandchildren living at Williamâ€™s death.\r\nLooking at extrinsic evidence, the probate court held \r\n  that the phrase â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ in the wills created a latent ambiguity \r\n  as to whether it refers to those grandchildren living at the death of William \r\n  or the date of distribution.Â  Then the probate court, looking at extrinsic evidence, \r\n  interpreted the phrase to include those grandchildren living at the time of \r\n  distribution.Â Â  \r\nISSUE\r\nWhat does the phrase â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ mean in the \r\n  Prioleausâ€™ wills?\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThere are two possible interpretations of the phrase \r\n  â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ in the Prioleausâ€™ wills:Â  1) the grandchildren living \r\n  when the testators died; or 2)Â  the grandchildren living when the estate is \r\n  distributed at some point in the future.Â  Relying on extrinsic evidence, the \r\n  probate court agreed with the respondents and held the phrase created a latent \r\n  ambiguity.Â  Then she determined that Roberta and William intended to include \r\n  all of their grandchildren living at distribution.Â  The appellants contend the \r\n  phrase refers to the grandchildren living when the testators died. \r\nIt is elementary that a testator's intention, as \r\n  expressed in his will, governs the construction of it if not in conflict with \r\n  law or public policy and intent is to be ascertained upon consideration of the \r\n  entire will.Â  Gist v. Brown, 236 S.C. 31, 113 S.E.2d 75 (1960).Â Â  In \r\n  construing the provisions of a will, every effort must be made to determine \r\n  the intentions of the testator and carry out such intentions. Citizens &amp; \r\n  S. Natâ€™l BankÂ  v. Cleveland, 200 S.C. 373, 20 S.E.2d 811 (1942). Further, \r\n  the court must always first look to the language of the will itself.Â  Pate \r\n  v. Ford, 297 S.C. 294, 299, 376 S.E.2d 775, 778 (1989).Â  The court â€œmust \r\n  give the words contained in the document their ordinary and plain meaning unless \r\n  it is clear the testator intended a different sense or such meaning would lead \r\n  to an inconsistency with the testator's declared intention.â€Â  Bob Jones Univ. \r\n  v. Strandell, 344 S.C. 224, 230, 543 S.E.2d 251, 254 (Ct. App. 2001).Â  \r\nAmbiguities may be patent or latent.Â  â€œ[T]he distinction \r\n  being that in the former case the uncertainty is one which arises upon the words \r\n  of the . . . instrument as looked at in themselves, and before any attempt is \r\n  made to apply them to the object which they describe, while in the latter case \r\n  the uncertainty arises, not upon the words of the . . . instrument as looked \r\n  at in themselves, but upon those words when applied to the object or subject \r\n  which they describe.â€Â  In re Estate of Fabian, 326 S.C. 349, 353, 483 \r\n  S.E.2d 474, 476 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Jennings v. Talbert, 77 \r\n  S.C. 454, 456, 58 S.E. 420, 421 (1907)). A court may admit extrinsic evidence \r\n  to determine whether a latent ambiguity exists. Id. at 353, 483 S.E.2d \r\n  at 476.Â  Once the court finds a latent ambiguity, extrinsic evidence is also \r\n  permitted to help the court determine the testator's intent. Id.\r\nAfter looking at both of the wills in their entirety \r\n  and the extrinsic evidence, we hold the phrase is not ambiguous. Robertaâ€™s will \r\n  provides: â€œUpon the death of the survivor of my said husband or me, my \r\n  trustees shall divide and distribute this Trust as then constituted as follows: \r\n  . . . (e) One-fifth (1/5) to be divided among my then-living grandchildren in \r\n  equal shares.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Likewise,Â  Williamâ€™s will provides: â€œUpon \r\n  my death, my Trustees shall divide and distribute this Trust as then constituted \r\n  as follows . . .Â  (e) one-fifth (1/5) to be divided among my then-living grandchildren \r\n  in equal shares.â€Â  (emphasis added).Â  Thus, the shares were to be divided and \r\n  distribution was to take place upon the death of William as he survived Roberta.Â  \r\n  We also note that both wills provided for distribution of the income from the \r\n  Trust â€œ[c]ommencing with the date of [] death . . .â€Â  The wills themselves do \r\n  not support a finding of ambiguity.\r\nFurthermore, the extrinsic evidence also does not \r\n  support such aÂ  finding. Specifically, the probate court noted that Roberta \r\n  and William were generous, gave to charity, and placed a great deal of importance \r\n  on family.Â  The probate court then noted that inclusion of the grandchildren \r\n  in the will â€œin and of itself was evidence of the importance of familyâ€ to Roberta \r\n  and William.Â  Further, the probate court held that based upon all of the testimony \r\n  and evidence of intent before the court and the fact that the assets have not \r\n  yet been distributed and the trust has not been funded, the phrase â€œthen living \r\n  grandchildrenâ€ includes those living at the time of the funding and distribution \r\n  of the trust. \r\nHowever, there is no specific testimony in the \r\n  record regarding the intent of Roberta and/or William to include after born \r\n  grandchildren.Â  There was opinion testimony that had Roberta and William known \r\n  of the two grandchildren born after his death, they would have wanted all of \r\n  their grandchildren to have been included. [4] Â  However, this is not evidence \r\n  that they intended in drafting their wills and referring to â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ \r\n  to mean those grandchildren living at the time of distribution. See Estate \r\n  of Toland, 434 A.2d 1192, 1194 (1981) (holding the duty of the court is \r\n  not to determine what the testator might or should have said in light of subsequent \r\n  events but, rather, the actual meaning of the words used).Â  \r\nIn conclusion, the phrase is not ambiguous.Â  The \r\n  class of â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ closed at Williamâ€™s death excluding any \r\n  after-born grandchildren.Â  Â \r\n REVERSED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Although Roberta had obtained legal advice in \r\n    drafting her will, apparently William used Robertaâ€™s will as a guide in drafting \r\n    his own will.Â Â  Roberta died before William executed his will and he had not \r\n    remarried.Â  Therefore, he could not take advantage of a marital deduction \r\n    as Roberta had done in her will with Share A.\r\n\r\n \r\n    [2]  Will was the successor personal representative \r\n    for Robertaâ€™s estate and after Williamâ€™s death, he assumed the personal representative \r\n    role for her estate.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  Only one of William and Robertaâ€™s children does \r\n    not have any children, Elizabeth.Â  The other three children of William and \r\n    Roberta have a total of seven children:Â  Mary Prioleau Wesley has three children; \r\n    William Prioleau has two children; and Roberta Prioleau Moran hasÂ  two children, \r\n    both born after Williamâ€™s death.Â  The issue of Elizabethâ€™s standing was raised \r\n    belowÂ  but is not an issue on appeal.Â  Furthermore, Elizabeth contended below \r\n    that she was seeking an interpretation of the phrase â€œthen-living grandchildrenâ€ \r\n    so that she could fulfill her obligations as co-personal representative.Â Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] \r\n    Even under the respondentsâ€™ view, it is possible that one or more grandchildren \r\n    might be born in the future and be excluded if born after distribution.Â  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25906","title":"In the Interest of Jeremiah W.","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25906","description":"This case involves the issues of whether the Court of Appeals erred by finding a directed verdict should have been entered on the charges of breach of peace and threatening a public official.","date":"2004-12-06","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Interest of Jeremiah W., a minor under the age of seventeen,\r\nRespondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\r\nTO THE COURT OF \r\n  APPEALS\r\n\r\nAppeal From Florence County\r\nÂ Mary E.

App. \r\n  2003).Â  We now affirm in part and reverse in part.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        I. Did the Court of Appeals err by finding a directed verdict should have been \r\n  entered on the charge of breach of peace?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n        II. Did the Court of Appeals err by finding a directed verdict should have \r\n  been entered on the charge of threatening a public official?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nI\r\nRespondent was arrested after an encounter with Officer Mickey Cooke, who was \r\n  working off-duty as a security officer for Magnolia Trace Apartments.Â  As Officer \r\n  Cooke and another officer, Gloria Howard, were sitting at the front of the complex, \r\n  respondent walked by from inside the complex.Â  Officer Cooke testified Officer \r\n  Howard informed him she thought respondent had already been given a trespassing \r\n  warning.Â  Officer Cooke stated he then attempted to call respondent over to \r\n  the car, but respondent answered by saying, â€œFuck you, man.Â  I ainâ€™t got to \r\n  come over thereâ€ and continued to walk on.Â  Officer Cooke stated he got out \r\n  of his car and intercepted respondent.Â  When Officer Cooke reached him, respondent \r\n  pulled his pants up and said, â€œWhat?â€ with his arms bowed out in a backward \r\n  position.Â  At the time, there were several people standing in front of the complex \r\n  about thirty to forty feet away.Â  Officer Cooke testified he then told respondent \r\n  he was placing him under arrest for breach of peace for being loud and boisterous \r\n  and using profanity in public.\r\nA majority of the Court of Appeals found respondentâ€™s conduct did not constitute \r\n  a breach of peace and, therefore, that his arrest was illegal.Â  We find the \r\n  Court of Appeals properly held the trial court should have granted a directed \r\n  verdict in respondentâ€™s favor on the breach of peace charge.Â  See State \r\n  v. Perkins, 306 S.C. 353, 412 S.E.2d 385 (1991) (First Amendment protects \r\n  a significant amount of verbal criticism and challenge directed at police officers; \r\n  State may not punish a person for voicing an objection to a police officer where \r\n  no fighting words are used); State v. Poinsett, 250 S.C. 293, 157 S.E.2d \r\n  570 (1967) (breach of peace is a violation of public order, a disturbance of \r\n  the public tranquility, by any act or conduct inciting to violence); State \r\n  v. Peer, 320 S.C. 546, 466 S.E.2d 375 (Ct. App. 1996) (although breach of \r\n  peace includes acts likely to produce violence in others, actual violence is \r\n  not an element of breach of peace).Â  \r\nII\r\nThe State argues the Court of Appeals erred by finding a directed verdict should \r\n  have been entered on the charge of threatening a public official. [1] \r\nOfficer Cooke placed respondent, who was handcuffed, into the back of the patrol \r\n  car.Â  During the ride, respondent refused to answer Officer Cookeâ€™s questions \r\n  and used profanity.Â  He also leaned forward through the opening of the plexi-glass \r\n  separating the front from the rear of the patrol car and yelled at the officer.Â  \r\n  After Officer Cooke told respondent to sit back, Officer Cooke testified respondent \r\n  made a gesture as if he was going to spit at Officer Cooke.Â  The officer then \r\n  sprayed the back seat with pepper spray.Â  At the time of the spraying, Officer \r\n  Cooke testified respondent stated he had a gun, and he was â€œgoing to come blow \r\n  my â€˜f-ingâ€™ head off.â€\r\nThe Court of Appeals, after finding respondent was unlawfully arrested \r\n  on the charge of breach of peace; found that the charge for threatening a public \r\n  official was not a new and distinct crime.Â  The Court of Appeals, finding State \r\n  v. Nelson, 336 S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999) distinguishable, found that \r\n  the actions that led to respondentâ€™s charge for threatening a public official \r\n  were part of a continuous flow of action and conduct emanating directly from \r\n  his unlawful arrest for breach of peace.Â  As a result, the court reversed respondentâ€™s \r\n  conviction on the threat charge.\r\nIn State v. Nelson, \r\n  supra, an officer attempted to stop Nelson, who was driving at the time, \r\n  to inquire about a previous altercation Nelson had with a person in the community.Â  \r\n  During the attempted stop, the officer flashed his lights in order to get Nelsonâ€™s \r\n  attention.Â  However, Nelson did not respond but allegedly rolled through a stop \r\n  sign and began speeding.Â  The officer then decided to stop Nelson for running \r\n  a stop sign and speeding through a residential neighborhood.Â  This Court stated, \r\n  â€œeven assuming [the officerâ€™s] initial attempt to stop [Nelson] was unlawful, \r\n  [Nelsonâ€™s] acts of running the stop sign and speeding through the neighborhood \r\n  constituted new and distinct crimes for which [the officer] had probable cause \r\n  to stop [Nelson].â€Â  Nelson, 336 S.C. at 194, 519 S.E.2d at 790.\r\nIn Nelson, we \r\n  held that new and distinct criminal acts do not qualify as â€œfruit of the poisonous \r\n  treeâ€ [2]  merely because such \r\n  acts were causally connected to police misconduct.Â  We stated, â€œâ€˜There is a \r\n  strong policy reason for holding that a new and distinct crime, even if triggered \r\n  by an illegal stop, is a sufficient intervening event to provide independent \r\n  grounds for arrest.â€™â€Â  Id. at 194, 519 S.E.2d at 790 (quoting United \r\n  States v. Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613, 619 (4th Cir. 1997)). \r\nThe question, therefore, is whether respondentâ€™s threat to Officer \r\n  Cooke constituted a new and distinct crime that provided independent grounds \r\n  for his arrest.Â  While the Court of Appeals believed respondent was merely challenging \r\n  the officerâ€™s ability to arrest him, the language used by respondent in the \r\n  police car went further and constituted a new and distinct offense of threatening \r\n  a public official.Â  The language used by respondent did not challenge the officerâ€™s \r\n  authority to arrest him, but was a willful communication â€œwhich contain[ed] \r\n  a threat to take the life of or to inflict bodily harm upon [Officer Cooke]. \r\n  . .; [a threat which was] directly related to [Officer Cookeâ€™s] . . . professional \r\n  responsibilities.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-1040(A) (2003).\r\nSimply because respondentâ€™s threat was causally connected to police misconduct \r\n  does not therefore mean that the threat qualifies as â€œfruit of the poisonous \r\n  tree.â€Â  See Nelson, supra.Â  While it is true the second \r\n  offense would not have arisen but for the unlawful arrest for the first offense, \r\n  as stated in Nelson, there is a strong policy reason for holding that \r\n  a new and distinct crime, even if triggered by an unlawful arrest, is a sufficient \r\n  intervening event to provide independent grounds for arrest.Â  See United \r\n  States v. Sprinkle, 106 F.3d 613 (4th Cir. 1997) (if suspectâ€™s \r\n  response to illegal stop is itself a new and distinct crime, then police constitutionally \r\n  may arrest suspect for that crime); United States v. Bailey, 691 F.2d \r\n  1009 (11th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 461 U.S. 933 (1983) (same).\r\nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals erred by finding respondentâ€™s threat \r\n  to Officer Cooke, although made after he was unlawfully arrested for breach \r\n  of peace, was not a new and distinct crime for which he could be arrested.Â  \r\n  Accord United States v. Waupekenay, 973 F.2d 1533 (10th \r\n  Cir. 1992) (although police entered suspectâ€™s home illegally, suspect commenced \r\n  new illegal activity when he aimed semi-automatic rifle at police); State \r\n  v. Windus, 86 P.3d 384 (Ariz. App. 2004) (although officers unlawfully entered \r\n  defendantâ€™s yard, officers did not exploit their unlawful entry to provoke defendantâ€™s \r\n  new, distinct criminal conduct consisting of an aggravated assault and resisting \r\n  arrest); Clark v. United States, 755 A.2d 1026 (D.C. 2000) (even if defendant \r\n  was under unlawful arrest when he threatened police officer with bodily harm, \r\n  evidence of that crime would not be suppressed as â€œfruit of the poisonous tree,â€ \r\n  as the commission of the threat was an intervening act that purged any taint \r\n  associated with the unlawful arrest); State v. Miskimins, 435 N.W.2d \r\n  217 (S.D. 1989) (where defendantâ€™s response to unlawful action by police is \r\n  itself a new, distinct criminal act, there are sound policy reasons for not \r\n  suppressing this evidence).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision finding the trial court \r\n  should have granted a directed verdict on the charge of breach of peace.Â  However, \r\n  we reverse the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision finding the trial court should have \r\n  granted a directed verdict on the charge of threatening a public official.Â  \r\n  Therefore, the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision is\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\n\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] S.C. \r\n    Code Ann.

Juror Qualification\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by excusing potential juror Smith, a \r\n  black female, for cause.\r\nDuring voir dire by the trial court, Smith stated she could carefully \r\n  consider the law and find appellant either guilty or not guilty.Â  However, she \r\n  stated she could not, under any circumstances, impose the death penalty.Â  Further, \r\n  she stated that her firm view on the death penalty was that there is not any \r\n  crime or situation where the death penalty would be appropriate.Â  She classified \r\n  herself as someone who would always vote for life imprisonment.\r\nDefense counsel then conducted voir dire of Smith.Â  The following \r\n  occurred:\r\n\r\nDefense counsel:Â  And you agree with me, I would suspect, that the jury \r\n  in a case . . . should be made up of a cross section of the community?\r\nSmith:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nDefense counsel:Â  You should have young people, old people, black people \r\n  and white people, rich people, poor people, protestants, catholics.Â  In other \r\n  words, the jury should be a cross section of everyone.Â  Do you agree with that?\r\nSmith:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nDefense counsel:Â  If you were on a jury and you had participated in the \r\n  conviction of this person and then you had heard evidence from the prosecution \r\n  where he is requesting that you impose the death penalty, and you have heard \r\n  . . . information from the defendant, when he says, â€œI would prefer that you \r\n  give me a life sentence,â€ would you take into consideration the request of the \r\n  prosecution and give meaningful consideration to the imposition of the death \r\n  penalty in any case?\r\nSmith:Â  Yes, sir.\r\nDefense counsel:Â  You would?\r\nSmith:Â  I will.\r\n\r\n. . .\r\n\r\nDefense counsel:Â  Could you vote for the death penalty if you thought \r\n  it was the proper penalty under those circumstances?\r\nSmith:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe trial court then questioned Smith:\r\n\r\nCourt:Â  Ms. Smith, what happened - five, ten minutes ago before [defense \r\n  counsel] got up, why did you tell me that you would never give the death penalty \r\n  and all of a sudden weâ€™re ready to give it?Â  What happened?\r\nSmith:Â  Well, in different situations.Â  It, to me, just all depends.Â  \r\n  I donâ€™t know.\r\nCourt:Â  Well, earlier you were so adamant to me.Â  . . . I asked you if \r\n  there was any situation, anything that would warrant the death penalty, and \r\n  you cut me off.Â  No way.Â  And now Iâ€™m talking to a different person.Â  What happened?\r\nSmith:Â  I have no idea.\r\n\r\nThe State then questioned Smith:\r\n\r\nThe State:Â  . . . based on [defense counselâ€™s] appeal to you to serve \r\n  on this jury to make it demographically and racially balanced and all of that, \r\n  is that what led you to change your statement as to you felt that you could \r\n  impose the death penalty?\r\nSmith:Â  Yes, sir.\r\n\r\nThe trial court then found Smith was not qualified to be a juror.Â  The court \r\n  stated that Smith acknowledged the only reason she changed her testimony was \r\n  because she felt a duty to be on the jury.Â  The court further stated, â€œTo suggest \r\n  that she can come in here and take that type of pandering examination and the \r\n  light bulb goes off that she as a black must serve on this jury so she can vote \r\n  for life imprisonment, Iâ€™m not going to permit something so utterly transparent.â€\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by disqualifying Smith as \r\n  a prospective juror.\r\nIn a capital case, the proper standard in determining the qualification \r\n  of a prospective juror is whether the jurorâ€™s views on capital punishment would \r\n  prevent or substantially impair the performance of his duties as a juror in \r\n  accordance with his instructions and his oath.Â  State v. Council, 335 \r\n  S.C. 1, 515 S.E.2d 508, cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1050 (1999).Â  See also \r\n  State v. Longworth, 313 S.C. 360, 438 S.E.2d 219 (1993), cert. denied, \r\n  513 U.S. 831 (1994) (citing S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3- 20(E) (2003)) (in capital \r\n  case, juror may not be excluded for her attitude against capital punishment \r\n  unless it would render juror unable to return a verdict according to law).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\n\r\nWhen reviewing the trial courtâ€™s qualification or disqualification \r\n  of prospective jurors, the responses of the challenged jurors must be examined \r\n  in light of the entire voir dire.Â  Id.Â  The ultimate consideration is \r\n  that the juror be unbiased, impartial, and able to carry out the law as explained \r\n  to him.Â  Id.Â  On review, the trial courtâ€™s disqualification of a prospective \r\n  juror will not be disturbed where there is a reasonable basis from which the \r\n  trial court could have concluded that the juror would not have been able to \r\n  faithfully discharge his responsibilities as a juror under the law.Â  State \r\n  v. Green, 301 S.C. 347, 392 S.E.2d 157, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 881 \r\n  (1990).\r\nWhen reviewing the entire voir dire of Smith, it is apparent the \r\n  trial court did not err by disqualifying Smith as a prospective juror.Â  Initially, \r\n  Smith was adamant she could not vote for the death penalty in any situation.Â  \r\n  However, after questioning from defense counsel, Smith changed her mind and \r\n  stated she could consider the death penalty and could vote for that punishment.Â  \r\n  When the trial court asked Smith what changed her mind, she said she had no \r\n  idea.Â  However, when the State asked Smith if defense counselâ€™s appeal to her \r\n  to serve on the jury to make it demographically and racially balanced led her \r\n  to change her statement so that she could impose the death penalty, Smith answered \r\n  yes. \r\nFrom the trial courtâ€™s comments, it is clear the trial court felt \r\n  Smith should be excluded for her views on capital punishment because they would \r\n  prevent or substantially impair the performance of her duties as a juror.Â  See \r\n  State v. Council, supra.Â  The court, when determining Smith to be \r\n  disqualified, was in the best position to view Smithâ€™s demeanor.Â Â  See \r\n  Wainwright v. Witt, 469 U.S. 412 (1985) (there will be situations where \r\n  trial court is left with definite impression that prospective juror would be \r\n  unable to faithfully and impartially apply the law and this is why deference \r\n  must be paid to trial court who sees and hears the juror).Â  The trial court \r\n  had a reasonable basis to conclude that Smith could not faithfully carry out \r\n  her duty under the law.Â  We hold the evidence supports the trial courtâ€™s decision \r\n  finding Smith disqualified from jury service.Â  See State v. Council, \r\n  supra (determination of whether juror is qualified to serve on death \r\n  penalty case is within sole discretion of trial court and is not reviewable \r\n  on appeal unless wholly unsupported by the evidence).\r\nII. Voluntary Manslaughter Charge\r\nAppellant argues the trial court erred by refusing to charge voluntary \r\n  manslaughter to the jury.Â  Appellant requested a voluntary manslaughter charge \r\n  based on the fact that Trooper Nicholson conducted an aggressive stop whereby \r\n  the moped had no other direction to go than to hit the patrol vehicle, the curb, \r\n  or the bushes.Â  Counsel argued appellant could reasonably have feared for his \r\n  safety.Â  The trial court denied the request on the basis there was no legal \r\n  provocation.\r\nVoluntary manslaughter is the unlawful killing of a human being in \r\n  sudden heat of passion upon a sufficient legal provocation.Â  State v. Ivey, \r\n  325 S.C. 137, 481 S.E.2d 125 (1997).Â  Heat of passion alone will not suffice \r\n  to reduce murder to voluntary manslaughter.Â  Id.Â  Where there are no \r\n  actions by the deceased to constitute legal provocation, a charge on voluntary \r\n  manslaughter is not required.Â  Id.Â  The exercise of a legal right, no \r\n  matter how offensive to another, is never in law deemed a provocation sufficient \r\n  to justify or mitigate an act of violence.Â  Id.\r\nIn State v. Linder, 276 S.C. 304, 278 S.E.2d 335 (1981), Linder \r\n  fled from an officer.Â  Linder alleged that the officer bumped his motorcycle \r\n  with his patrol car, thereby knocking him to the ground. Â Linder alleged the \r\n  officer then began to fire on him and that he reached for his weapon and returned \r\n  the fire.Â  We held that, based on Linderâ€™s version of events, he was entitled \r\n  to a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\nIn Linder, we stated that a lawful arrest or detention in \r\n  a lawful manner by an officer will not constitute an adequate provocation for \r\n  heat of passion reducing the grade of the homicide to manslaughter.Â  This is \r\n  precisely the situation in the present case.Â  There is no evidence that Trooper \r\n  Nicholson acted in an unlawful manner in discharging his duties.Â  There is no \r\n  evidence, as there was in Linder, that Trooper Nicholson bumped appellantâ€™s \r\n  moped or that he fired upon appellant before appellant shot him multiple times.\r\nAccordingly, because there was no evidence of sufficient legal provocation, \r\n  appellant was not entitled to a voluntary manslaughter charge.\r\nIII. Constitutionality of S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 16-3-20 (2003)Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nAppellant asserts Ring v. Arizona, 536 U.S. 584 (2002), renders \r\n  unconstitutional the requirement in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) (2003) that \r\n  the sentencing proceeding be held before the judge when a defendant pleads guilty \r\n  to murder. \r\nAs we recently stated in State v. Downs, S.C. Op. No. 25884(Sup. \r\n  Ct. filed October 25, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 42 at 54), the capital-sentencing \r\n  procedure invalidated in Ring does not exist in South Carolina.Â  Arizonaâ€™s \r\n  statute required the judge to factually determine whether there existed an aggravating \r\n  circumstance supporting the death penalty regardless whether the judge or a \r\n  jury had determined guilt.Â  Ariz. Rev. Stat. Â§ 13-703(C) (2001) (amended 2002); \r\n  Ring, 536 U.S. at 597.Â  In South Carolina, conversely, a defendant convicted \r\n  by a jury can be sentenced to death only if the jury also finds an aggravating \r\n  circumstance and recommends the death penalty.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(B) \r\n  (2003); Sheppard v. State, 357 S.C. 646, 652, 594 S.E.2d 462, 466 (2004).Â  \r\n  As we noted in Downs, Ring did not involve jury-trial waivers \r\n  and is not implicated when a defendant pleads guilty.Â  Other courts have also \r\n  reached this conclusion.Â  See, e.g., Leone v. Indiana, \r\n  797 N.E.2d 743, 749-50 (Ind. 2003); Colwell v. Nevada, 59 P.3d 463, 473-74 \r\n  (Nev. 2003); Illinois v. Altom, 788 N.E.2d 55, 61 (Ill. App. 2003), app. \r\n  denied, 792 N.E.2d 308 (Ill. 2003).Â  Therefore, appellantâ€™s argument is \r\n  without merit.\r\nIV. Subject Matter Jurisdiction\r\nAppellant argues the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to sentence \r\n  him to death because the murder indictment did not allege an aggravating circumstance. [1] Â  He argues that Ring v. Arizona, \r\n  536 U.S. 584 (2002), holds that aggravating factors are elements of the offense \r\n  of capital murder that must be charged in the indictment.\r\nWe recently addressed this issue in State v. Downs, S.C. Op. \r\n  No. 25884 (Sup. Ct. filed October 25, 2004) (Shearouse Adv. Sh. No. 42 at 54).Â  \r\n  In Downs, we held that South Carolina law, rather than federal law, governs \r\n  indictments for state law crimes.Â  Under South Carolina law, aggravating circumstances \r\n  need not be alleged in an indictment for murder.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-19-30 \r\n  (2003); State v. Butler, 277 S.C. 452, 290 S.E.2d 1, cert. denied, \r\n  459 U.S. 932 (1982). [2] Â  The aggravating circumstances listed in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-20(C)(a) (2003) are sentencing factors, not elements of murder.Â  \r\n  See Butler, 277 S.C. at 456-67, 290 S.E.2d at 3-4.Â  Therefore, \r\n  the indictment in the instant case is valid.\r\nPROPORTIONALITY REVIEW\r\nUnder State law, S.C.Code Ann. Â§ 16-3-25(C)(3) (1985) requires this Court to \r\n  determine in a death case â€œ[w]hether the sentence of death is excessive or disproportionate \r\n  to the penalty imposed in similar cases, considering both the crime and the \r\n  defendant.â€Â  There is no requirement the sentence be proportional to any particular \r\n  case; however, death sentences have been imposed in similar cases.Â  See State \r\n  v. Hughes, 336 S.C. 585, 521 S.E.2d 500 (1999), cert. denied, 529 \r\n  U.S. 1025 (2000); State v. Johnson, 306 S.C. 119, 410 S.E.2d 547 (1991), \r\n  cert. denied, 503 U.S. 993 (1992); State v. South, 285 S.C. 529, \r\n  331 S.E.2d 775, cert. denied, 474 U.S. 888 (1985).Â  Further, after reviewing \r\n  the entire record, we conclude the death sentence was not the result of passion, \r\n  prejudice, or any other arbitrary factor, and the juryâ€™s finding of a statutory \r\n  aggravating circumstance is supported by the evidence.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  16-3-25 (2003).Â  Accordingly, appellantâ€™s sentence is not disproportionate under \r\n  State law.\r\nAFFIRMED. \r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] The \r\n    indictment charging appellant with murder states:\r\n  \r\n  That JOHN RICHARD WOOD did in Greenville County, on \r\n    or about the 6th day of December, 2000, unlawfully and with malice \r\n    aforethought kill Eric Nicholson by means of shooting him, and that Eric Nicholson \r\n    died as a proximate result thereof.Â  This is in violation of Â§ 16-3-10 of \r\n    the South Carolina Code of Laws (1976) as amended. \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n     [2]  Overruled on other grounds by State \r\n    v.

Office \r\n  of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE TOAL:Â  \r\n  Respondent Raymond Magazine was arrested for criminal sexual conduct in the \r\n  first degree (CSC).Â  He was indicted on charges of kidnapping, attempted murder, \r\n  assault and battery with intent to kill, CSC, and possession of a weapon.Â  The \r\n  post-conviction relief (PCR) judge granted a new trial after finding that Respondent \r\n  was not personally served with a copy of the indictment and that counsel was \r\n  ineffective for (1) failing to intelligently evaluate each juror during jury \r\n  selection and (2) failing to request a charge on assault and battery of a high \r\n  and aggravated nature (ABHAN) as a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  After granting \r\n  Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari, we reverse.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nLate one night, the victim was \r\n  walking along Highway 15 in Sumter after a fight with her boyfriend.Â  She and \r\n  her boyfriend were on their way to Lee County; he pulled the car over; she got \r\n  out; and after she refused to get back into the car, he drove away.Â  The victim \r\n  testified that Respondent appeared shortly thereafter, pulled her into a ditch, \r\n  beat her up, put a knife to her throat, and raped her.Â  The victim also testified \r\n  that Respondent forced her to walk with him into the woods and later to an area \r\n  behind a motel.Â  Along the way and behind the motel, he raped her at least two \r\n  more times and forced her to perform oral sex.Â  The victim was eventually released \r\n  and called 911 from the motel.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nAt a bond hearing before trial, \r\n  Respondent said that he did not know the victim and that he was out of town \r\n  on the day of the alleged crime.Â  At trial, Respondent did not testify but maintained \r\n  that he was innocent. \r\nThe first trial resulted in a \r\n  hung jury.Â  In the second trial, Respondent was found guilty of kidnapping, \r\n  CSC, and ABHAN.Â  He was sentenced to thirty years for CSC and ten years for \r\n  ABHAN, to be served consecutively.Â  He was also sentenced to thirty years for \r\n  kidnapping, to be served concurrently.Â  The same defense counsel represented \r\n  Respondent in both trials. \r\nRespondent appealed and his appeal \r\n  was dismissed.Â  Respondent then applied for PCR on eleven grounds.Â  After a \r\n  hearing, the PCR judge found that three of the grounds had merit and granted \r\n  a new trial.Â  This Court granted certiorari to review the PCR judgeâ€™s decision.\r\nThe State raises the following issues for review:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n         I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling that Respondent did not receive proper notice \r\n  of the charges against him? [1] \r\n      \r\n      \r\n         II.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling counsel was ineffective for failing to use eight \r\n  peremptory jury strikes?\r\n      \r\n      \r\n         III.&nbsp;\r\n         \r\n  Did the PCR court err in ruling that trial counsel was ineffective for failing \r\n  to request a jury charge for ABHAN, a lesser-included offense of CSC?\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n Law/Analysis\r\nStandard of Review\r\nThis Court gives great deference to the PCR courtâ€™s \r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  Caprood v. State, 338 S.C. \r\n  103, 109, 525 S.E.2d 514, 517 (2000).Â  On review, a PCR judgeâ€™s findings will \r\n  be upheld if there is any evidence of probative value to support them.Â  Cherry \r\n  v. State, 300 S.C. 115, 119, 386 S.E.2d 624, 626 (1989). Â If no probative \r\n  evidence exists to support the findings, this Court will reverse.Â  Pierce \r\n  v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 144, 526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000).Â  \r\nTo establish a claim that counsel was ineffective, a PCR \r\n  applicant must show that (1) counselâ€™s representation fell below an objective \r\n  standard of reasonableness, and (2) but for counselâ€™s errors, there is a reasonable \r\n  probability that the outcome of the trial would have been different.Â  Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 688 (1984); Johnson v. State, 325 S.C. 182, \r\n  186, 480 S.E.2d 733, 735 (1997).Â  â€œA reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcomeâ€ of the trial.Â  Strickland, \r\n  466 U.S. at 694. \r\n  I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIndictment \r\n   \r\nThe State argues that the \r\n  PCR court erred in ruling that Respondent did not receive proper notice of the \r\n  charges against him.Â  We agree.\r\nIn a criminal case, the \r\n  defendant has the right â€œto be fully informed of the nature and cause of the \r\n  accusationâ€ against him.Â  S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 14.Â  The right to be fully informed \r\n  is a personal right, and therefore the defendant himself, not just his attorney, \r\n  must be fully informed of the charges against him.Â  State v. Green, 269 \r\n  S.C. 657, 661, 239 S.E.2d 485, 487 (1977) (citation omitted).Â  In Green, \r\n  the defendant was not served with an arrest warrant or indictment, was not arraigned, \r\n  and was never informed of the charges against him.Â  Id.Â  If he received \r\n  any notice at all, it was from his attorney.Â  Id.Â  The Court held that \r\n  notice from the attorney was inadequate, and therefore the defendantâ€™s constitutional \r\n  rights were violated.Â  Id.\r\nIn the present case, Respondent \r\n  was initially arrested for CSC.Â  He was subsequently indicted on four additional \r\n  charges.Â  Respondent did not receive a copy of the indictment listing all of \r\n  the charges until after the first trial.\r\nAt the PCR hearing, Respondent \r\n  testified that before the first trial began, he knew only of the CSC charge \r\n  and not the other four.Â  He admitted that later, once the trial began, the trial \r\n  judge read aloud all five charges.Â  He also admitted that he knew he was facing \r\n  serious charges and substantial jail time.Â  Moreover, counsel told Respondent \r\n  about the charges and about the possibility that Respondent may be imprisoned \r\n  for life.Â  At trial, counsel did not challenge the indictment issue.\r\nThe PCR judge found that \r\n  Respondent received notice of the CSC charge but not the other four charges.Â  \r\n  The judge explained that Respondent should have been â€œpersonally served with \r\n  the warrants or indictment.â€Â  Accordingly, the PCR judge reversed all convictions \r\n  except the conviction for CSC.Â Â Â  \r\nUnlike the defendant in \r\n  Green, Respondent was personally informed of the charges against him.Â  \r\n  At the beginning of the first trial, the judge read aloud all five charges in \r\n  the indictment.Â  The trial ended in a mistrial.Â  At the beginning of the second \r\n  trial, the charges were read aloud once again.Â  Consequently, Respondent was \r\n  notified, on at least two occasions, of the charges against him.Â  \r\nTherefore, the PCR court \r\n  erred in ruling that Respondent was not notified of the charges against\r\nhim.&nbsp; \r\n\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Jury selection\r\nThe State argues that the PCR court erred in ruling \r\n  that trial counselâ€™s failure to use all available peremptory strikes during \r\n  jury selection prejudiced Respondentâ€™s case.Â  We agree.\r\nWhen the PCR court is reviewing a counselâ€™s performance, \r\n  there is a strong presumption that counsel â€œrendered adequate assistance and \r\n  made all significant decisions in the exercise of reasonable professional judgment.â€Â  \r\n  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 690.Â  Consequently, courts apply a â€œhighly deferentialâ€ \r\n  standard of review.Â  Strickland, 466 U.S. at 689.Â  Counsel may avoid \r\n  a finding of ineffectiveness if he articulates a valid reason for using a certain \r\n  strategy.Â  Ingle v. State, 348 S.C. 467, 470, 560 S.E.2d 401, 402 (2002).Â  \r\n  Counselâ€™s strategy will be reviewed under â€œan objective standard of reasonableness.â€ \r\n  Id.\r\nSouth Carolina courts have not directly addressed \r\n  the issue of whether a failure to use all available peremptory strikes gives \r\n  rise to a finding that counsel was ineffective.Â  Our courts have found, however, \r\n  that the process of jury selection inherently falls within the expertise and \r\n  experience of trial counsel.Â  Palacio v. State, 333 S.C. 506, 517, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d 62, 68 (1999).Â  In Palacio, this Court reviewed a finding that \r\n  counsel was ineffective for failing to use a peremptory strike as her client \r\n  instructed.Â  Id. at 516, 511 S.E.2d at 67-68.Â  In holding that counsel \r\n  was ineffective, the PCR court found that jury selection was a defendantâ€™s \r\n  right and not trial strategy.Â  This Court reversed the PCR court, finding that \r\n  jury selection is within the ambit of trial strategy.Â  Id. at 517, 511 \r\n  S.E.2d at 68; see also Wilcher v. State, 863 So.2d 719, 754-55 (Miss. \r\n  2003) (holding that counsel was not ineffective for failing to use all of the \r\n  available peremptory challenges).Â  In addition, the Court noted that â€œa criminal \r\n  defendant has no right to a trial by any particular jury, but only a right to \r\n  a trial by a competent and impartial jury.â€Â  Id. at 516, 511 S.E.2d at \r\n  68.Â Â Â  Finding no evidence that defendantâ€™s right to a trial by a competent \r\n  and impartial jury was violated, the Court reversed.Â  Id.  \r\nIn the present case, counsel initially used seven \r\n  of his ten available peremptory strikes.Â  The State made a Batson [2]  motion, and the trial judge ruled \r\n  that counsel did not have racially neutral reasons for striking certain jurors.Â  \r\n  The jury was re-drawn, and during the second round of jury selection, counsel \r\n  used only two peremptory strikes. \r\nAt the PCR hearing, counsel testified that he did \r\n  not use all available strikes because he had â€œjust gotten shot down on the first \r\n  jury selectionâ€ and he felt â€œlike [he] was boxed in.â€Â  He also testified that \r\n  after the Batson motion was granted, he abandoned his initial trial strategy \r\n  to select â€œblack female[s].â€ [3] Â  Counsel admitted that his focus \r\n  was on the racial composition of the jury.Â  The jury ultimately consisted of \r\n  nine white and three black jurors.Â  \r\nThe PCR judge found that counsel â€œdid not intelligently \r\n  evaluate each juror and did not have a plan or theory in striking the jury.â€Â  \r\n  Moreover, the judge found that counselâ€™s use of only two of his ten available \r\n  strikes supported the conclusion that counsel was ineffective.Â  The judge did \r\n  not, however, explain how the outcome in Respondentâ€™s trial would have been \r\n  different if Respondent had used all available strikes.Â  Instead, the judge \r\n  merely said that he was concerned that the racial composition of the jury was \r\n  significantly different than that of the first jury.Â  The judge pointed out \r\n  that jury selection was â€œvery important,â€ especially given the fact that the \r\n  first trial ended in a mistrial.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â \r\nThe PCR judge correctly found that counsel failed \r\n  to properly evaluate and select jury members.Â  Counsel admitted that he gave \r\n  up his initial strategy and ended up selecting jurors that he had struck the \r\n  first timeâ€”jurors whose names he had written â€œNoâ€ next to.Â  In other words, \r\n  counsel did not even show that he had a trial strategy for jury selection.Â  \r\n  Nevertheless, Respondent did not present any evidence to support a finding that \r\n  counselâ€™s error resulted in a violation of Respondentâ€™s right to a trial by \r\n  a competent and impartial jury.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, the PCR court erred in finding counsel ineffective \r\n  for failing to use all available peremptory strikes.\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jury charge\r\nThe State argues that the PCR judge erred in finding \r\n  counsel ineffective for failing to request an ABHAN charge as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of CSC.Â  We agree.\r\nABHAN is a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  State \r\n  v. Primus, 349 S.C. 576, 582, 564 S.E.2d 103, 106 (2002).Â  A trial judge \r\n  must charge the jury on a lesser-included offense if there is any evidence from \r\n  which it could be inferred that the defendant committed the lesser rather than \r\n  the greater offense.Â  Brightman v. State, 336 S.C. 348, 350-51, 520 S.E.2d \r\n  614, 615 (1999).Â  Evidence that a physical fightâ€”instead of rapeâ€”occurred warrants \r\n  a charge of ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  State v. Pressley, \r\n  292 S.C. 9, 10, 354 S.E.2d 777, 777-78 (1987).Â  In Pressley, the victim, \r\n  who was the defendantâ€™s fourteen-year-old daughter, testified that the defendant \r\n  jumped on her, put his hands around her throat, straddled her, slapped her, \r\n  and then raped her.Â  Id. at 9-10, 354 S.E.2d at 777.Â  The defendant, \r\n  on the other hand, testified that he and his daughter argued, he slapped her, \r\n  shook her, and when she tried to get away, he grabbed for her, tearing off her \r\n  clothes.Â  Id.Â  The Court held that because the defendantâ€™s testimony, \r\n  if believed, would establish that he was guilty of only the lesser-included \r\n  offense, the trial judge should have charged the jury on ABHAN.Â  Id. \r\n  at 10, 354 S.E.2d at 778.Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nIn the present case, the trial judge charged the jury \r\n  with ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of assault and battery with intent to \r\n  kill.Â  The judge did not, however, charge the jury with ABHAN as a lesser-included \r\n  offense of CSC in the first degree.Â  Moreover, counsel did not request that \r\n  the judge charge the jury with ABHAN as a lesser-included offense of CSC.Â  \r\nAt the PCR hearing, counsel testified that he was \r\n  not aware that, under certain circumstances, ABHAN was a lesser-included offense \r\n  of CSC.Â  He also testified that he could not remember whether he had researched, \r\n  at that time, the elements of the various offenses with which his client was \r\n  charged. \r\nThe PCR judge ruled that according to the facts and \r\n  evidence, Respondent was entitled to the ABHAN charge.Â  Moreover, the judge \r\n  ruled that Respondentâ€™s case was prejudiced by counselâ€™s failure to request \r\n  the charge.Â  Therefore, the PCR judge found that the conviction for CSC in the \r\n  first degree should be reversed.\r\nAt the bond hearing, Respondent denied the charges \r\n  and said he was out of town on the day of the alleged crime.Â  At trial, Respondent \r\n  did not testify or present any witnesses to refute the victimâ€™s testimony or \r\n  to suggest that something other than rape occurred.Â  Moreover, Respondentâ€™s \r\n  counsel did not present any evidence from which it could be inferred that Respondent \r\n  committed ABHAN rather than CSC.Â  Later, at the PCR hearing, Respondent testified \r\n  that he was not with the victim on the night in question and that he did not \r\n  rape the victim.Â  In sum, the record did not contain any evidence warranting \r\n  the lesser charge.Â Â Â  \r\nTherefore, the PCR court erred in finding counsel \r\n  ineffective for failing to request an ABHAN charge as a lesser-included offense \r\n  of CSC.Â Â \r\nConclusion\r\nBecause there is no evidence \r\n  of probative value sufficient to support the PCR courtâ€™s ruling, we REVERSE.\r\nMOORE, WALLER, BURNETT \r\n  and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]  In its brief, the State frames this issue as one concerning arraignment. \r\n    But the PCR judge explicitly acknowledged that arraignment was not a statutory \r\n    right.Â  Instead, the judge granted relief on the basis that Respondent was \r\n    not notified of the charges against him; therefore, we have framed the issue \r\n    accordingly.Â  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  Batson v. Kentucky, 476 U.S. 79 (1986).\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [3]  Respondent is black and the victim is white.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25909","title":"State v.

Swerling, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nACTING JUSTICE MYERS: Â This is a cocaine-trafficking case.Â  Larry Dean \r\n  McCluney (Respondent) was convicted of trafficking in more than 400 grams of \r\n  cocaine in violation of South Carolina Code section 44-53-370(e)(2)(e). [1] Â  The circuit court sentenced Respondent to \r\n  twenty-five years of imprisonment and a fine of $200,000.Â  The Court of Appeals \r\n  reversed, holding the circuit court should have granted Respondentâ€™s motion \r\n  for a directed verdict.Â  State v. McCluney, 357 S.C. 560, 593 S.E.2d \r\n  509 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  We granted a writ of certiorari to review the Court of \r\n  Appealsâ€™ decision.Â  We reverse and remand.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent was charged under section 44-53-370(e)(2)(e) with trafficking in \r\n  more than 400 grams of cocaine.\r\nAt trial the State presented evidence that Respondent agreed with two other \r\n  persons to purchase over 400 grams of cocaine from a fourth person, who happened \r\n  to be a police informant.Â  The State also presented evidence that in a reverse-buy \r\n  operation conducted by police with the help of the informant, Respondent and \r\n  the other two persons purchased over 400 grams of imitation cocaine, thinking \r\n  it was real.\r\nISSUE\r\nWhether Respondent was entitled to \r\n  a directed verdict.\r\nANALYSIS\r\nA defendant is entitled to a directed verdict when the State fails to present \r\n  evidence of the offense charged.Â  State v. McHoney, 344 S.C. 85, 97, \r\n  544 S.E.2d 30, 36 (2001).\r\nThe Court of Appeals held that Respondent was entitled to a directed verdict \r\n  because a transaction involving imitation cocaine â€œdoes not fall under the purview \r\n  of the trafficking statute.â€Â  State v. McCluney, 357 S.C. 560, 565, 593 \r\n  S.E.2d 509, 511 (Ct. App. 2004).Â  According to the court, â€œthe only indictable \r\n  offense applicable to imitation cocaine would be under S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-390(a)(6) \r\n  (2002).â€ [2] Â  McCluney, \r\n  357 S.C. at 564, 593 S.E.2d at 511.Â  We disagree.Â  \r\nTrafficking is not limited to the substantive offenses of purchasing, \r\n  possessing, and selling large amounts of controlled substances.Â  Conspiring \r\n  and attempting to do those acts also constitute trafficking.Â  The part of the \r\n  trafficking statute pertinent to this case is as follows: â€œAny person who knowingly \r\n  â€¦ attempts[] or conspires to â€¦ purchase â€¦ ten grams or more of cocaine â€¦ is \r\n  guilty of a felony which is known as â€˜trafficking in cocaine.â€™â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 44-53-370(e)(2) (2002).Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â  \r\nThe Court of Appeals errantly focused on the facts that only imitation cocaine \r\n  was present at the transaction and that purchasing imitation cocaine does not \r\n  constitute trafficking.Â  In doing so, the court relied heavily on Murdock \r\n  v. State of South Carolina, 311 S.C. 16, 426 S.E.2d 740 (1992), which is \r\n  irrelevant to Respondentâ€™s case.Â  \r\nThe court should have focused on the Stateâ€™s evidence that Respondent conspired \r\n  and attempted to purchase real cocaine.Â  Section 44-53-370(e)(2) plainly states \r\n  that conspiring and attempting to purchase ten grams or more of real cocaine \r\n  constitute trafficking.Â  The presence of only imitation cocaine at the transaction \r\n  is irrelevant to Respondentâ€™s intent and thus irrelevant to the Stateâ€™s conspiracy \r\n  and attempt arguments.Â  Respondent was not entitled to a directed verdict.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe State introduced evidence that Respondent knowingly agreed with at least \r\n  one other person to purchase real cocaine and took a substantial step toward \r\n  fulfilling his intention.Â  Because conspiring and attempting to purchase ten \r\n  grams or more of real cocaine constitute trafficking, the Court of Appeals erred \r\n  by holding that Respondent was entitled to a directed verdict.Â  Due to this \r\n  error, the Court of Appeals declined to address the other two issues before \r\n  it.Â  Accordingly, the decision of the Court of Appeals and the case are respectivelyÂ  \r\n\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp; TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  S.C.

Suttonâ€™s \r\n  (Petitioner) post-conviction relief (PCR) application as barred by the statute \r\n  of limitations.Â  We affirm.\r\nFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nPetitioner was convicted in 1991 of murder and was sentenced \r\n  to life in prison.Â  We affirmed.Â  State v. Sutton, Op. No. 93-MO-197 \r\n  (S.C. Sup. Ct. filed July 19, 1993) (unpublished decision).\r\nPetitioner filed his first PCR application on May 8, 2001, \r\n  and later amended it.Â  He alleged the one-year statute of limitations should \r\n  not bar his application because his trial and appellate attorneys failed to \r\n  inform him of his right to seek collateral review of his conviction on grounds \r\n  not available in a direct appeal.\r\nThe PCR judge dismissed Petitionerâ€™s application as untimely \r\n  without an evidentiary hearing because it was filed nearly five years after \r\n  July 1, 1996 - the deadline to file an application for all persons convicted \r\n  before the effective date of the statute of limitations contained in S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).Â  See Peloquin v. State, 321 S.C. 468, \r\n  469 S.E.2d 606 (1996).\r\nWe granted Petitionerâ€™s writ of certiorari to address a \r\n  novel issue:\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in summarily dismissing Petitionerâ€™s \r\n  PCR application as untimely, where Petitioner alleged he did not file a timely \r\n  application because neither his trial nor his appellate attorneys informed him \r\n  of the statutory right to file an application?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nDismissal of a PCR application without a hearing is appropriate \r\n  only when (1) it is apparent on the face of the application that there is no \r\n  need for a hearing to develop any facts and (2) the applicant is not entitled \r\n  to relief.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-70(b) and (c) (2003).Â  When considering the \r\n  Stateâ€™s motion for dismissal of an application, where no evidentiary hearing \r\n  has been held, the circuit court must assume facts presented by an applicant \r\n  are true and view those facts in the light most favorable to the applicant.Â  \r\n  Similarly, when reviewing the propriety of a dismissal, we must view the facts \r\n  in the same fashion.Â  See S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003) (PCR \r\n  actions are governed by usual rules of civil procedure); Wilson v. State, \r\n  348 S.C. 215, 559 S.E.2d 581 (2002); Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, \r\n  364, 527 S.E.2d 742, 747 (2000).\r\nIn a case raising a novel issue of law, the appellate court \r\n  is free to decide the question of law with no particular deference to the trial \r\n  court.Â  Osprey, Inc. v. Cabana Ltd. Partn., 340 S.C. 367, 372, 532 S.E.2d \r\n  269, 272 (2000); Iâ€™On, L.L.C. v. Town of Mt.

State, 357 S.C. 646, \r\n  651, 594 S.E.2d 462, 465 (2004); Pierce v. State, 338 S.C. 139, 145, \r\n  526 S.E.2d 222, 225 (2000). \r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nPetitioner argues the PCR judge erred in dismissing his \r\n  application as untimely because neither trial nor appellate counsel informed \r\n  him of the availability of PCR following his conviction and unsuccessful appeal.Â  \r\n  We disagree.\r\nA person convicted or sentenced for a crime has a statutory \r\n  right to file a PCR application.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 17-27-10 to -160 (2003).Â  \r\n  In a PCR proceeding, â€œthe focus usually is upon alleged errors made by trial \r\n  or plea counsel. . . . The applicant attempts to show that his or her attorney \r\n  erred in a manner that a reasonably proficient attorney would not, and that \r\n  the error prejudiced his case.â€Â  Al-Shabazz v. State, 338 S.C. 354, 363-364, \r\n  572 S.E.2d 742, 747 (2000) (explaining the history and basic principles of the \r\n  PCR process, and holding that PCR generally is limited to collateral attacks \r\n  on the validity of a conviction or sentence). \r\nA PCR action is a civil action generally subject to rules \r\n  and statutes that apply in civil proceedings.Â  Wade v. State, 348 S.C. \r\n  255, 263, 559 S.E.2d 843, 846-847 (2002); S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003).Â  \r\n  A PCR application ordinarily â€œmust be filed within one year after the entry \r\n  of a judgment of conviction or within one year after the sending of the remittitur \r\n  to the lower court from an appeal or the filing of the final decision upon an \r\n  appeal, whichever is later.â€Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-45(A) (2003).Â  After the \r\n  Legislature enacted the statute of limitations in 1995, we held that all persons \r\n  convicted before the statuteâ€™s effective date had one additional year to file \r\n  an application.Â  Consequently, the application of persons such as Petitioner \r\n  had to be filed by July 1, 1996.Â  Peloquin v. State, 321 S.C. 468, 469 \r\n  S.E.2d 606 (1996).\r\nAbsent extraordinary circumstances, such as when a defendant \r\n  inquires about an appeal, there is no constitutional requirement that a defendant \r\n  be informed of the right to a direct appeal from a guilty plea.Â  Weathers \r\n  v.

(International Paper) for \r\n  construction of new S.C. Highway 22, the Conway Bypass.Â Â  The project included \r\n  the new highway and relocation of a portion of the public Watertower Road, a \r\n  logging road that had been maintained by the county and used by the public for \r\n  years.\r\nIn March 1994, International Paper sold 160 acres to Apache \r\n  Group II, an entity owned by Hinson.Â  Apache Group II had notice of the anticipated \r\n  condemnation proceeding involving Highway 22 and relocation of Watertower Road \r\n  from the condemnation and lis pendens notices filed with the clerk of court \r\n  and a pre-sale survey of the property.Â  Apache Group II subsequently conveyed \r\n  the property to Hinson in 1999. [1] \r\n  \r\nIn June 1994, DOT and International Paper settled the condemnation \r\n  action.Â  The settlement was based on a 1993 appraisal and included payment for \r\n  a 25 percent diminution in the value of adjoining property owned by International \r\n  Paper.Â  The appraiser reduced the value of the adjoining property because Highway \r\n  22 (running north-south) would divide it, and access to the new highway and \r\n  the relocated Watertower Road would be reduced. \r\nA second appraiser hired by DOT in 1993 valued the acreage taken \r\n  and the impact on remaining parcels, but did not specify any diminution in value \r\n  due to a loss in right of access to public roads from the property at issue \r\n  in the present case.Â  In fact, the second appraiser stated no â€œuneconomic remnantâ€ \r\n  would exist after construction of Highway 22 and, although various parcels would \r\n  be divided, â€œthe remaining portions can be accessed from relocated [Watertower \r\n  Road].â€Â  The acreage purchased by Hinson included the adjoining property for \r\n  which DOT had compensated International Paper for diminished value because of \r\n  reduced access to public roads.\r\nIn September 2000, DOT began condemnation proceedings to purchase \r\n  approximately 88 acres of Hinsonâ€™s property for construction of new S.C. Highway \r\n  31 (running east-west), the Carolina Bays Parkway, and an interchange with Highway \r\n  22.Â  DOT informed appraiser John Wilkins that it had fully compensated the previous \r\n  property owner (International Paper) in 1994 for loss of the right of access \r\n  to public roads as a result of the condemnation action related to the construction \r\n  of Highway 22.Â  DOT took the position that Hinson had purchased the acreage \r\n  from International Paper knowing it was without access to public roads.\r\nHinsonâ€™s property lies on both sides of Highway 22:Â  an \r\n  eastern portion of 132 acres and a western portion of 28 acres.Â  The highest \r\n  and best use of the non-wetland acreage was as residential resort property, \r\n  which appraiser Wilkins valued at $13,000 per acre.Â  Hinsonâ€™s property is located \r\n  near Barefoot Resort, a mixed-use residential community north of the Intracoastal \r\n  Waterway and east of Highway 22.Â  The appraiser, accepting DOTâ€™s assertions, \r\n  concluded the eastern portion of the property was landlocked before the taking \r\n  and valued non-wetland portions of it at $1,300 per acre - a ninety percent \r\n  reduction from the market value for non-landlocked property.Â  \r\nHinson moved for partial summary judgment on the issue of \r\n  whether the eastern portion of the property was landlocked.Â  Hinson argued (1) \r\n  DOT neither paid it nor International Paper for loss of all right of access \r\n  to public roads, indicating DOT did not believe or try to assert the property \r\n  was landlocked until realizing that position might allow it to pay less for \r\n  Hinsonâ€™s property in the 2000 condemnation action; and (2) the eastern portion \r\n  was not landlocked when Hinson purchased it in 1994 or as of September 2000 \r\n  because it bordered old Watertower Road which, while no longer maintained by \r\n  the county, had not been formally abandoned and was still publicly accessible.Â  \r\n  Hinson relied in its arguments on the 1993 appraisals and affidavits and correspondence \r\n  from county, International Paper, and DOT officials involved in the previous \r\n  condemnation action.\r\nIn response, DOT presented similar affidavits from five DOT officials \r\n  or subcontractors who set forth the history of events related to the 1994 transactions \r\n  and construction of Highway 22.Â  The affiants stated Hinson had knowingly purchased \r\n  a parcel of property landlocked by Highway 22 and the relocation of Watertower \r\n  Road.Â  The affiants and DOT further asserted that, as of September 2000, Hinsonâ€™s \r\n  acreage was landlocked because the parcel did not include a strip of land 100 \r\n  feet wide that lies between the north end of the eastern portion of Hinsonâ€™s \r\n  land and the relocated Watertower Road.Â  International Paper retained that strip \r\n  of land in the 1994 transaction, but subsequently sold it to another entity.Â  \r\n  The appraiser also relied on the fact Hinson did not own the 100-foot strip \r\n  in concluding the eastern portion was landlocked.\r\nDOT contended that even if Hinson had access to old Watertower \r\n  Road in 1994, Hinson did not have access when DOT filed notice of the condemnation \r\n  action in September 2000 because the old road was closed and abandoned in late \r\n  1999 when the relocated road was opened.Â  DOT argued there was a factual dispute \r\n  on whether the eastern portion was landlocked, making summary judgment inappropriate.\r\nThe circuit court granted Hinsonâ€™s motion for partial summary \r\n  judgment, concluding Hinsonâ€™s property was not made completely inaccessible \r\n  by the 1993 condemnation action.Â  Although DOT compensated International Paper \r\n  for a 25 percent diminution in value due to reduced access, old Watertower Road \r\n  never had been abandoned under the statutory process and so remained publicly \r\n  accessible.Â Â  â€œ[I]t is clear to the Court the subject parcel enjoyed some access \r\n  [to public roads] on the date the Highway 31 Condemnation Notice was filedâ€ \r\n  in September 2000, the circuit court stated.\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when \r\n  â€œthe pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, \r\n  together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as \r\n  to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as \r\n  a matter of law.â€Â  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 \r\n  S.C. 318, 487 S.E.2d 187 (1997).Â  In determining whether any triable issues \r\n  of fact exist, the court must view the evidence and all reasonable inferences \r\n  that may be drawn from the evidence in the light most favorable to the non-moving \r\n  party.Â  Manning v. Quinn, 294 S.C. 383, 365 S.E.2d 24 (1988).Â  On appeal \r\n  from an order granting summary judgment, the appellate court will review all \r\n  ambiguities, conclusions, and inferences arising in and from the evidence in \r\n  a light most favorable to the appellant, the non-moving party below.Â  Williams \r\n  v. Chesterfield Lumber Co., 267 S.C. 607, 230 S.E.2d 447 (1976).\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the circuit court err in granting Hinsonâ€™s motion for \r\n  partial summary judgment because a genuine factual dispute exists on whether \r\n  old Watertower Road has been formally abandoned?Â  \r\n\r\nLAW AND ANALYSIS\r\nDOT contends the circuit court erred because this case presents a \r\n  genuine issue of material fact:Â  whether Horry County abandoned the portion \r\n  of old Watertower Road which abutted Hinsonâ€™s property when the road was relocated \r\n  in late 1999 during construction of Highway 22.Â  We disagree. \r\n  [2] \r\nS.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-9-10 provides, â€œany interested person, the State \r\n  or any of its political subdivisions or agencies may petition a court of competent \r\n  jurisdiction to abandon or close any street, road or highway whether opened \r\n  or not.â€Â  Notice must be given to the public by newspaper advertisements and \r\n  to abutting landowners by mail.Â  Section 57-9-10. Â The court must determine \r\n  if it is in the best interest of all concerned to abandon or close the street, \r\n  and determine in whom the title to property comprising the former street shall \r\n  be vested.Â  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 57-9-20 (1991).\r\nâ€œBy creating a formal judicial procedure for terminating \r\n  a public right of way over land, [Section 57-9-10] removes the uncertainty attending \r\n  the common law of dedication and abandonment.Â  It also ameliorates the rigor \r\n  of the common law rule requiring strict proof of intent to abandon a public \r\n  right of way before that right can be extinguished.â€Â  Hoogenboom v. City \r\n  of Beaufort, 315 S.C. 306, 319, 433 S.E.2d 875, 884 (Ct. App. 1992).Â  DOT \r\n  and the local municipality are indispensable parties that must be joined in \r\n  an action to abandon a public road.Â  Without their inclusion, they would not \r\n  be bound by the decision or discharged from their maintenance duties or other \r\n  obligations and liabilities.Â  BancOhio Natl. Bank v. Neville, 310 S.C. \r\n  323, 426 S.E.2d 773 (1993).\r\nWatertower Road is an admittedly public road, although the \r\n  record does not reveal whether it became public by dedication or through prescriptive \r\n  or long-established use.Â  It is undisputed that no interested person has instituted \r\n  an action under the statutory process to effect an abandonment of old Watertower \r\n  Road.Â  Moreover, an affidavit and letter from an Horry County official show \r\n  the county had ceased maintaining, but had not abandoned, the portion of old \r\n  Watertower Road abutting Hinsonâ€™s property.Â  In light of these facts, conclusory \r\n  assertions by DOTâ€™s affiants regarding the allegedly landlocked nature of Hinsonâ€™s \r\n  property are insufficient to create a genuine issue of material fact.Â  The circuit \r\n  court correctly concluded old Watertower Road remains publicly accessible because \r\n  no formal action has been instituted to abandon it pursuant to Sections 57-9-10 \r\n  and -20.Â  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the circuit courtâ€™s ruling old Watertower Road \r\n  remains publicly accessible.Â  Accordingly, as a matter of law, Hinsonâ€™s property \r\n  was not landlocked as a result of the 1994 condemnation action or the relocation \r\n  of Watertower Road in 1999.Â  We remand this case for further proceedings consistent \r\n  with this opinion.\r\nWe decline to address the additional sustaining ground \r\n  raised by Respondents regarding the propriety of an implied, appurtenant easement \r\n  by necessity.Â  See Whiteside v. Cherokee County School Dist. No. One, \r\n  311 S.C. 335, 428 S.E.2d 886 (1993) (appellate court need not address remaining \r\n  issue when resolution of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nAFFIRMED.

ODC sent \r\n  a â€œTreacyâ€ letter in which ODC pointed out that respondentâ€™s failure to respond \r\n  to the complaint would constitute lawyer misconduct.Â  See In the Matter \r\n  of Treacy, 277 S.C. 514, 290 S.E.2d 240 (1982).Â  Respondent failed to respond \r\n  to the second request from ODC.\r\nODC then served respondent with a Notice of Full Investigation.Â  See \r\n  Rule 19, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.Â  Respondent failed to respond to the Notice \r\n  of Full Investigation.Â  ODC then had the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division \r\n  serve a subpoena on respondent directing that he appear at a specific time and \r\n  place for an on-the-record and under oath interview and to bring documents with \r\n  him for inspection.Â  Respondent failed to appear as directed, but did contact \r\n  ODC and reschedule the interview.Â  Respondent subsequently appeared for the \r\n  rescheduled interview and provided ODC with the subpoenaed documents.Â Â  \r\nAs a result of the above misconduct, respondent was publicly reprimanded in \r\n  his capacity as a lawyer.Â  In the Matter of McFarland, 301 S.C. 101, \r\n  600 S.E.2d 537 (2004).Â  This reprimand constituted the fourth time respondent \r\n  had been disciplined for professional misconduct as a lawyer.Â  \r\nLAW\r\nBy his misconduct, respondent has violated the following Canons of the Code \r\n  of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:Â  Canon 1 (judge shall uphold integrity \r\n  of the judiciary); Canon 1A (judge should participate in establishing, maintaining, \r\n  and enforcing high standards of conduct, and shall personally observe those \r\n  standards so that the integrity of the judiciary will be preserved);Canon 2 \r\n  (judge shall avoid impropriety in all activities); Canon 2A (judge shall respect \r\n  and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that promotes \r\n  public confidence in the integrity of the judiciary); and Canon 4(A)(2) (judge \r\n  shall conduct all extra-judicial activities so that they do not demean the judicial \r\n  office).Â  By violating the Code of Judicial Conduct, respondent has also violated \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) of the Rules for Judicial Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 502, SCACR \r\n  (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to violate the Code of Judicial \r\n  Conduct).Â  In addition, he has violated Rule 7(a)(2), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR \r\n  (it shall be ground for discipline for judge to willfully fail to appear personally \r\n  as directed, willfully fail to comply with a subpoena, or knowingly fail to \r\n  respond to a lawful demand from a disciplinary authority to include a request \r\n  for a response or appearance).Â Â  \r\nCONCLUSION \r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent and issue a public reprimand.Â  \r\n  Accordingly, respondent is hereby reprimanded for his misconduct.Â  \r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

App. 2000).Â  The Court of Appeals held that a party \r\n  to an action is not entitled to mileage and a witness fee for attending a deposition.Â  \r\n  We reverse. \r\nÂ FACTS\r\nPetitioner, Murphy, filed suit against Respondent, NationsBank (Bank), alleging \r\n  Bank had filed a negative credit report against him.Â  During discovery, Bank \r\n  noticed Murphyâ€™s deposition.Â  Counsel notified Bank that Murphy expected a witness \r\n  fee of $25.00 plus mileage.Â  NationsBank filed a motion to enforce discovery \r\n  and, after a hearing, Judge Hayes ordered Murphy to appear at the deposition \r\n  without being paid a witness fee and/or mileage.Â  Murphy appealed to the Court \r\n  of Appeals which affirmed the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Murphy was not entitled \r\n  to the fee and mileage.\r\nISSUE\r\n \r\n  \r\n    Is a party to an action entitled to a witness fee and mileage for attending \r\n      a deposition?\r\n  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nIn Perry v. Minit Saver Food Stores, 255 S.C. 42, 177 S.E.2d 4 (1970), \r\n  this Court answered the precise question before us.Â  There, we held the word \r\n  â€œwitness,â€ as used in Circuit Court Practice Rule 87, included a party such \r\n  that the plaintiff was entitled to a witness fee and mileage.Â  We stated, â€œ[w]e \r\n  are of the view that there is no ambiguity whatever in Rule 87 as to the meaning \r\n  of the word â€˜witnessâ€™ . . . and that the word â€˜witnessâ€™ was intended to mean \r\n  all witnesses whose depositions are taken pursuant to the rule, whether or not \r\n  the witness, perchance, be a party.Â  The word â€˜witnessâ€™ is used at various other \r\n  places in Rule 87 to denote all witnesses, including parties, without making \r\n  any distinction between witnesses who happen to be parties and those who are \r\n  not.â€Â  255 S.C. at 45, 177 S.E.2d at 5.\r\nCircuit Court Rule 87 was repealed and replaced with Rule 30(a)(2), SCRCP, \r\n  effective July 1, 1985.Â Â  The pertinent provision of Rule 30(a)(2) provides, \r\n  â€œ[a] witness attending any deposition held pursuant to these rules shall receive \r\n  for each day's attendance and for the time necessarily occupied in going to \r\n  and returning from the same, $25.00 per day, and mileage for going from and \r\n  returning to his place of residence, in the same amounts as provided by law \r\n  for official travel of state officers and employees.â€ \r\nThe Court of Appeals held that, because other sections of Rule 30(a)(2) differentiate \r\n  between a witness and a party, the section pertaining to payment of a witness \r\n  fee was just that, requiring payments only to witnesses, but not parties.Â  The \r\n  Court of Appeals noted that portions of Rule 30(a)(2) set forth certain limitations \r\n  on depositions, to wit: \r\n\r\n  A witness (excluding a party) may be compelled to attend only in the \r\n    county in which he resides or is employed or transacts his business in person, \r\n    or at such other convenient place as is fixed by an order of the court.Â  The \r\n    second paragraph states:Â  â€˜The deposition of any party or witness may \r\n    only be taken one time in any case except by agreement of the parties through \r\n    their counsel or by order of the court for good cause shown.\r\n\r\n354 S.C. at 496-497, 581 S.E.2d \r\n  at 849-850 (emphasis in original).Â  Because the first paragraph of the rule \r\n  deals with witnesses and excludes parties, and the second paragraph deals with \r\n  both witnesses and parties, the Court of Appeals concluded that the third \r\n  paragraph, dealing with payment of witness fees, applied only to witnesses \r\n  and not to parties.Â  Id. at 497, 581 S.E.2d at 850.Â  This holding is \r\n  in direct conflict with this Courtâ€™s opinion in Perry, holding that for \r\n  purposes of the rule requiring payment of a witness fee, a party is a witness \r\n  as well as a party.Â Â  \r\nMoreover, the Court of Appeals overlooked the fact that former Circuit Court \r\n  Rule 87, upon which this Court relied in Perry, contained the identical \r\n  provisions as Rule 30(a)(2).Â  Rule 87(A) specifically stated that â€œ[a] witness \r\n  (excluding a party) may be compelled to attend only in the county in which he \r\n  resides or is employed or transacts his business in person, or at such other \r\n  convenient place as is fixed by an order of the Court.â€Â  The rule went on to \r\n  state that, â€œ[t]he deposition of any party or witness may only be taken one \r\n  time in any case except by agreement of the parties through their counsel or \r\n  by order of the Court for good cause shown.â€Â  We nonetheless held in Perry \r\n  that a party witness is entitled to mileage and a witness fee.Â  Accordingly, \r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in holding Perry inapplicable to this case.\r\nWe hold a party to an action who is required to attend a deposition is entitled \r\n  to a witness fee and mileage pursuant to Rule 30(A)(2).Â  The Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion is reversed.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., PLEICONES, J., and Acting Justices Edward B.

Elliott, \r\n          all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â Â  We granted the petitionerâ€™s petition to review the \r\n  denial of relief in this post-conviction relief (PCR) action.Â  The PCR court \r\n  found trial counsel was not ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s \r\n  closing argument.Â  We reverse and remand.Â  \r\nFACTS\r\nAt approximately 3:00 a.m. on April 10, 1997, Deputy \r\n  Reggie Widener (â€œOfficer Widenerâ€) was parked in a high crime area.Â  He noticedÂ  \r\n  a car circle the area twice.Â  The petitionerâ€™s girlfriend was driving the car \r\n  and the petitioner was the passenger. After Officer Widener approached the patrol \r\n  car, the vehicle drove away at a faster rate of speed.Â Â  Officer Widener followed \r\n  the car which parked in the driveway of a completely dark house.Â  \r\nAfter driving around the block, Officer Widener \r\n  saw the petitioner on the front porch with the petitionerâ€™s girlfriend in the \r\n  car, and he noticed the house was still dark.Â  Because there had been many complaints \r\n  about burglaries in the neighborhood, Officer Widener and back-up Officer Reid \r\n  approached the petitioner and his girlfriend and asked the petitioner for identification \r\n  and why he was at the house.Â  Officer Widener then asked the petitioner for \r\n  permission to pat him down for guns which the petitioner granted.Â  The petitioner \r\n  testified that he informed Officer Widener that he had several knives and a \r\n  marijuana joint in his pocket.Â  Officer Widener testified that the petitioner \r\n  did not admit to possessing any drugs prior to the search.Â  During the pat down, \r\n  Officer Widener testified he felt some knives.Â  While removing the knives from \r\n  the petitionerâ€™s pocket, Officer Widener testified he discovered a bag of marijuana. \r\n\r\nOfficer Widener arrested the petitioner and then \r\n  conducted a search incident to the arrest. Officer Widener testified that during \r\n  this search he found an empty cigarette pack which contained thirteen small \r\n  bags of methamphetamines in the petitionerâ€™s coat pocket. At trial, the petitioner \r\n  admitted he possessed marijuana.Â Â  However, he denied ever possessing any methamphetamines.Â Â  \r\n\r\nThe petitioner was convicted of possession of marijuana and possession with \r\n  intent to distribute (PWID) crank and sentenced to one year and fined $1,000 \r\n  for the possession charge and sentenced to twenty years and fined $100,000 for \r\n  the PWID crank charge.Â  The petitioner timely filed an application for PCR raising, \r\n  inter alia, the claim that his trial counsel was ineffective for \r\n  failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument.Â  Following a hearing, \r\n  the PCR court denied the petitioner relief and dismissed the petitionerâ€™s PCR \r\n  application.Â  The petitioner filed a motion to reconsider which the PCR judge \r\n  also denied.Â  \r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Was trial counsel ineffective for failing to object to the solicitorâ€™s closing \r\n    argument stating what uncalled witnesses would have testified to?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nÂ â€œ[A] PCR applicant has the burden of proving counsel's \r\n  representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness and, but for \r\n  counsel's errors, there is a reasonable probability that the result at trial \r\n  would have been different. . . .Â  A reasonable probability is a probability \r\n  sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome of trial.&quot;Â  Johnson \r\n  v. State, 325 S.C. 182, 186, 480 S.E.2dÂ  733, 735 (1997) (citing Strickland \r\n  v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668 (1984)).\r\nThe petitioner contends trial counsel was ineffective for failing toÂ object \r\n  to the solicitorâ€™s closing argument stating what uncalledÂ  witnesses would have \r\n  testified to and vouching for Officer Widener, the Stateâ€™s only eyewitness to \r\n  testify at trial.\r\nDuring closing arguments, the petitionerâ€™s trial \r\n  counselÂ  stated:\r\n \r\n  What I would like you all to remember, who else we didnâ€™t hear from that \r\n    was there.Â  There was another officer there, Mr. Reid.Â  Obviously he didnâ€™t \r\n    see anything because he is not here.\r\n  There was a ride along in the car with Mr. Widener.Â  Sheâ€™s not here obviously \r\n    because she didnâ€™t see anything.Â  Eddie testified he didnâ€™t see any methamphetamines \r\n    out there at the trailer.Â  Ivy Roussos was out there.Â  She didnâ€™t see any.Â  \r\n    The only person that saw any methamphetamines out there that night, April \r\n    10th, was Officer Widener.Â  . . . \r\n  They had the evidence man, the SLED guy, and I think an expert on - - one \r\n    of the drug agents here.Â  But nobody else.Â  They had three people at the scene \r\n    who testified.Â  Just Officer Widener, he [sic] the only one that saw that \r\n    out at the scene.Â  Thatâ€™s just one thing I want you to think about.Â  The \r\n    government has the burden of proof.Â  The government must prove their case.Â  \r\n  \r\n  And in this case, with all the other people that were there, they rely solely \r\n    on this one man, that one man that says he saw the drugs out there.Â  Where \r\n    did they come from?Â  I donâ€™t know.Â  I donâ€™t have a clue.Â  I wasnâ€™t there that \r\n    night.Â  I do know that there were five people there.Â  Three with the police \r\n    officer, with the sheriffâ€™s department, the ride along, Widener and Reid, \r\n    Eddie and Ivy.Â  Now, out of all those people, only one person saw drugs \r\n    out there.Â  I want you all to think about that. \r\n\r\n(emphasis added).Â  \r\nThe solicitor then gave her closing statement and stated:\r\n \r\n  The defense attorney wants to know why I didnâ€™t call the other witnesses \r\n    to this case.Â  When I get a case I interview everybody who is involved.Â  I \r\n    ask them, I donâ€™t prompt them, I say what did you observe?Â  I take notes on \r\n    it.Â  Iâ€™m a minimalist when it comes to trying a case.Â  Your time is valuable, \r\n    the Judgeâ€™s time is valuable, the clerkâ€™s time is valuable, my time is valuable.Â  \r\n    If everybody is going to say the same thing, there are no differences, then \r\n    Iâ€™m not going to make them come up here and testify. Thatâ€™s duplicative testimony.\r\n  And in fact, if everybody takes the stand and says the very same thing, the \r\n    defense attorney can object to it.Â  We have a rule of evidence that says you \r\n    cannot put in duplicative testimony.Â  Now, he says if those people had seen \r\n    meth, they would have been here.Â  Let me put it to you this way, the defense \r\n    attorney has the power of subpoena.Â  He can have any single person he wants \r\n    to here to testify.\r\n  I donâ€™t know if he talked to the first officer, but I do know that he subpoenaed \r\n    the ride along and has talked to her.Â  We called this case to trial previously, \r\n    and she was up here, and they discussed it with her.Â  Donâ€™t you think if she \r\n    was going to say, I didnâ€™t see any meth, she would have taken the stand.Â  \r\n    He could have subpoenaed her and put her up there, but he didnâ€™t.\r\n  The reason I didnâ€™t put them up there is because theyâ€™re going to say the \r\n    very same thing that my officer did.Â  .Â  .Â  . Now apparently what weâ€™re going \r\n    for here is that the officer planted those drugs.Â  I will be the first person \r\n    to admit that there are officers who will take the stand and lie.Â  That is \r\n    the reality of life.Â  Everyone who takes an oath does not tell the truth.Â  \r\n    I have to my knowledge never put someone up there that would do that. . . \r\n    . \r\n  The officer had no reason to lie, and it is not necessary for me to bring \r\n    other people here to corroborate his testimony when theyâ€™re going to say the \r\n    same thing.Â  But if they werenâ€™t going to say the same thing, I would guarantee \r\n    you that the defense would have had them on the stand because they can subpoena \r\n    whoever they like. \r\n\r\nThe State's closing arguments must be confined \r\n  to evidence in the record and the reasonable inferences that may be drawn from \r\n  the evidence. State v. Copeland, 321 S.C. 318, 324, 468 S.E.2d 620, 624 \r\n  (1996).Â  Furthermore, a prosecutor cannot vouch for a witnessâ€™ credibility.Â  \r\n  State v. Shuler,Â  344 S.C. 604, 630, 545 S.E.2d 805, 818 (2001).Â  A prosecutor \r\n  improperly vouches for a witnessâ€™ credibility and places the government's prestige \r\n  behind a witness by making explicit personal assurances, or indicating that \r\n  information not presented to the jury supports the testimony.Â  Id.\r\nAlthough it would have been improper for the solicitor to vouch for Officer \r\n  Widener, or initiate an argument about the testimony of the absent witnesses, \r\n  the situation is entirely different when the defendant opens the door to the \r\n  subject.Â  United States v. Robinson, 485 U.S. 25 (1988)(holding solicitor's \r\n  closing argument that defendant &quot;could have taken the stand and explained \r\n  it to you&quot; did not violate defendant's Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination \r\n  because prosecutor's reference to defendant's opportunity to testify was fair \r\n  response to claim made by defendant in closing argument that government had \r\n  not allowed defendant to explain his side of story).Â  Conduct that would otherwise \r\n  be improper may be excused under the &quot;invited reply&quot; doctrine if the \r\n  prosecutor's conduct was an appropriate response to statements or arguments \r\n  made by the defense.Â  As explained in United States v. Young, 470 U.S. \r\n  1, 13 (1985), the idea of an invited response is used not to excuse improper \r\n  comments, but to determine their effect on the trial as a whole.Â Â  \r\nOnce a defendant opens the door, the relevant question in \r\n  determining if a defendantâ€™s rights were violated is whether the solicitor's \r\n  comments &quot;so infected the trial with unfairness as to make the resulting \r\n  conviction a denial of due process.&quot;Â  Donnelly v. DeChristoforo, \r\n  416 U.S. 637, 642 (1974).Â  In Darden v. Wainwright, 477 U.S. 168, 182 \r\n  (1986), the United States Supreme Court held that comments by a solicitor failed \r\n  to meet the test set out in Donnelly,Â  because 1) the comment was an \r\n  &quot;invited response&quot; to defense counsel's argument, 2) the evidence \r\n  against the defendant was overwhelming, and 3) the trial court instructed the \r\n  jury several times that its decision was to be made on the basis of evidence \r\n  alone and the arguments of counsel were not evidence.Â  See also \r\n  State v. Hawkins, 292 S.C. 418, 357 S.E.2d 10 (1987).\r\nHere, if not for the lack of evidence, we might agree that \r\n  the solicitor was merely responding to the petitioner's argument. [1]  The petitionerâ€™s trial counsel argued that \r\n  the State had failed to call witnesses who would testify that there were no \r\n  methamphetamines found on the petitioner that night.Â  Thus, the petitioner &quot;opened \r\n  the door&quot; to some response from the solicitor. But See State \r\n  v. Engel, 592 A.2d 572 (N.J. Sup. Ct. 1991)(holding prosecutor did not express \r\n  personal belief as to defendant's guilt or improperly vouch for credibility \r\n  of police investigators when, in response to defense counsel's lengthy summation \r\n  characterizing State's case as a &quot;big lie,&quot; he defended integrity \r\n  of investigation and prosecutor's remarks, taken in context, did not unfairly \r\n  prejudice defendants.)Â  Furthermore, here, the trial court instructed the jury \r\n  that they were to consider only the testimony that they heard at trial.\r\nHowever, other than Officerâ€™s Widenerâ€™s testimony, there \r\n  was no other evidence that the petitioner possessed the methamphetamines. While \r\n  the petitionerâ€™s argument may have invited some response, the solicitorâ€™s response \r\n  was unfair and prejudiced the petitioner, in light of the lack of evidence of \r\n  his guilt on the PWID charge.Â  See State v. McFadden, 318 S.C. \r\n  404, 415, 458 S.E.2d 61, 68 (1995) (holding that given the ample other evidence \r\n  of guilt in the record, the solicitor's comments did not infect the trial with \r\n  unfairness to the extent that his conviction was a denial of due process).Â  \r\n\r\nFurthermore, we note that approximately fifteen minutes \r\n  after beginning deliberations, the jury sent the trial judge a question.Â  The \r\n  jury wanted to see the â€œtestimonyâ€ ofÂ  the other officer, or more correctly \r\n  the dispatcher, Poulsom, who had been riding with Officer Widener.Â  However, \r\n  Poulsom did not testify at trial.Â  The trial judge instructed the jury that \r\n  they were to consider only the testimony and evidence received during the trial. \r\n  [2] Â  While the trial judge correctly instructed the jury to consider only \r\n  the evidence received during the trial, the jurors were obviously concerned \r\n  with the witnesses who did not testify and the arguments about them probably \r\n  only added to their concern.\r\nWe find the solicitorâ€™s comments prejudiced the petitioner \r\n  and trial counsel was ineffective for failing to object. [3]  Accordingly, the PCR court erred \r\n  in denying him relief.Â  \r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] The petitioner argues that the State cannot assert \r\n  trial strategy as aÂ  valid reason for failure to object to the solicitorâ€™s comments \r\n  citing Matthews v. State, 350 S.C. 272, 565 S.E.2d 766 (2002). Â While \r\n  at the PCR hearing, trial strategy was raised, on appeal the State does not \r\n  argue this as a ground to affirm.Â Â Â  \r\n [2]  Poulsom testified at the PCR hearing that she \r\n  really did not recall the arrest in any detail.\r\n [3] In deciding the prejudice prong in this PCR action, \r\n  the Court is to examine the same factors as those analyzed in deciding on direct \r\n  appeal whether a similar error is harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. Edmond \r\n  v. State, 341 S.C. 340, 348, 534 S.E.2d 682, 686 (2000).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25915","title":"Willis v.

Â§Â§ \r\n  44-41-10 to -85 (2002) (prohibiting abortions after the twenty-fourth week of \r\n  gestation unless two unrelated physicians certify in writing it is necessary \r\n  to preserve the life or health of the mother).\r\nSpecifically, Child alleges Physician was negligent in failing to timely perform \r\n  or comprehend the significance of ultrasound examinations which indicated the \r\n  presence of hydrocephalus in the fetus, a congenital defect that in Childâ€™s \r\n  case had devastating consequences.Â  Childâ€™s medical experts testified Physician \r\n  and his ultrasound technician failed to diagnose Childâ€™s condition and inform \r\n  Mother in time for her to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy.\r\nChild was born with maximal hydrocephalus, a condition in which the cerebral \r\n  hemispheres of his brain are missing.Â  Those areas of the brain control thinking, \r\n  motor control, the ability to speak and move voluntarily, and the ability to \r\n  interact with others.Â  A CT scan of Childâ€™s head at birth showed a very large \r\n  head filled with fluid, with brain tissue seen only in the frontal and temporal \r\n  lobes and a brain stem.Â  Physicians placed a shunt in Childâ€™s head at birth \r\n  to drain the fluid and prevent his head from growing larger.\r\nMother is the primary caregiver for Child, who is now eight years old.Â  Child \r\n  receives various forms of therapy at home and school.Â  He will never be able \r\n  to care for himself independently.Â  His physical condition and mental abilities \r\n  are about the same as they were at the age of a few months.\r\nThe circuit court granted Physicianâ€™s motion for summary judgment on the wrongful \r\n  life action, ruling South Carolina does not recognize it.Â  Child appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Does South Carolina recognize a common law cause of action for â€œwrongful \r\n    lifeâ€ brought by or on behalf of a child born with a congenital defect?\r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nA trial court may properly grant a motion for summary judgment when â€œthe pleadings, \r\n  depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with \r\n  the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material \r\n  fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.â€Â  \r\n  Rule 56(c), SCRCP; Tupper v.

Dwivedi, 733 N.E.2d \r\n  1161, 1163 (Ohio 2000) (recognizing â€œoverreliance on terms such as â€˜wrongful \r\n  lifeâ€™ or â€˜wrongful birthâ€™ creates the risk of confusion in applying principles \r\n  of tort law to actual cases, and may compound or complicate resolution of the \r\n  caseâ€); Reed v. Campagnolo, 630 A.2d 1145, 1150 (Md. 1993) (explaining \r\n  the term â€œwrongful lifeâ€ is not instructive, as any wrongfulness is in the negligence \r\n  of the physician, not the life of the child; any harm is not the birth itself, \r\n  but the effect of the defendantâ€™s alleged negligence resulting in the denial \r\n  of the parentâ€™s right to decide whether to bear a child with a genetic or other \r\n  defect); Lininger by Lininger v. Eisenbaum, 764 P.2d 1202, 1204 n.2 (Colo. \r\n  1988) (en banc) (â€œuse of the terms â€˜wrongful lifeâ€™ and â€˜wrongful birthâ€™ more \r\n  often serves to obscure the issues than to elucidate them; unfortunately the \r\n  labels are so entrenched in normal usage that it is difficult to entirely abstain \r\n  from their useâ€); Siemieniec v. Lutheran Gen. Hosp., 512 N.E.2d 691, \r\n  695 (Ill. 1987) (â€œBecause the courts and the commentators have been less than \r\n  precise in their utilization of these terms, the legal and theoretical distinctions \r\n  between the torts often have been blurred.Â  Hence, thoughtful analysis of the \r\n  validity of wrongful birth and wrongful life as emerging legal concepts requires, \r\n  in the first instance, a clear understanding of the alleged wrong upon which \r\n  the cause of action is predicated.â€).Â  Regardless, the terms have become embedded \r\n  in the law since the mid-1970s and most courts appear to endorse the following \r\n  definitions:\r\nA â€œwrongful lifeâ€ action is brought by or on behalf of the child himself.Â  \r\n  The child alleges, because of the defendantâ€™s negligence, his parents either \r\n  decided to conceive him ignorant of the risk of an impairment or birth defect, \r\n  or were deprived of information during gestation that would have prompted them \r\n  to terminate the pregnancy.Â  The child alleges, but for the defendantâ€™s negligence, \r\n  he would not have been born.Â  The birth defect or impairment itself occurred \r\n  naturally, i.e., it was not directly caused by an act or omission of the defendant \r\n  health care provider.\r\nA â€œwrongful birthâ€ action is brought by the parent of a child born with an \r\n  impairment or birth defect.Â  The parent alleges that the negligence of those \r\n  charged with prenatal testing or genetic counseling deprived them of the right \r\n  to make a timely decision regarding whether to terminate a pregnancy because \r\n  of the likelihood their child would be born physically or mentally impaired.Â  \r\n  The birth defect or impairment itself occurred naturally, i.e., it was not directly \r\n  caused by an act or omission of the defendant health care provider.Â  \r\nA â€œwrongful pregnancyâ€ or â€œwrongful contraceptionâ€ action is brought by the \r\n  parent of a healthy but unplanned child, seeking damages from a health care \r\n  provider who allegedly was negligent in performing a sterilization procedure \r\n  or abortion, or from a pharmacist or pharmaceutical manufacturer who allegedly \r\n  was negligent in dispensing or manufacturing a contraceptive prescription or \r\n  device.Â  Kush v.

[1] \r\nA.Â  CURRENT SOUTH CAROLINA LAW\r\nIn a negligence action against a physician or other health care provider in \r\n  which medical malpractice is alleged, plaintiff generally must demonstrate a \r\n  duty is owed because a physician-patient relationship existed, physician failed \r\n  to exercise the degree of care and skill which ordinarily is employed by the \r\n  profession under similar conditions and like circumstances, physicianâ€™s failure \r\n  proximately caused harm or injury to plaintiff, and plaintiff suffered damages \r\n  as a result of the harm or injury.Â  See, e.g. Pearson v. Bridges, \r\n  344 S.C. 366, 544 S.E.2d 617 (2001); Gooding v. St. Francis Xavier Hosp., \r\n  326 S.C. 248, 487 S.E.2d 596 (1997); Roberts v. Hunter, 310 S.C. 364, \r\n  426 S.E.2d 797 (1993); Bramlette v. Charter-Medical-Columbia, 302 S.C. \r\n  68, 393 S.E.2d 914 (1990); Fields v. Regional Medical Center of Orangeburg, \r\n  354 S.C. 445, 581 S.E.2d 489 (Ct. App. 2003); Daves v. Cleary, 355 S.C. \r\n  216, 584 S.E.2d 423 (Ct. App. 2003).Â  Thus, the analysis in a medical malpractice \r\n  action tracks the familiar duty-breach-causation-damages analysis employed in \r\n  a typical tort action.\r\nIt is well established in South Carolina that a viable fetus harmed in utero \r\n  by the act or omission of another, including a physician or other health care \r\n  provider, may seek damages from the negligent tortfeasor.Â  See Rush \r\n  v. Blanchard, 310 S.C. 375, 426 S.E.2d 802 (1993) (affirming jury verdict \r\n  for parents and child in medical malpractice action brought against physician \r\n  who negligently performed an amniocentesis and harmed infant while he was in \r\n  the womb, and injured infant was later born alive); Crosby v. Glasscock Trucking \r\n  Co., 340 S.C. 626, 532 S.E.2d 856 (2000) (nonviable fetus may not maintain \r\n  wrongful death action where fetus was stillborn after a vehicle wreck); West \r\n  v. McCoy, 233 S.C. 369, 105 S.E.2d 88 (1958) (same); Fowler v. Woodward, \r\n  244 S.C. 608, 138 S.E.2d 42 (1964) (unborn child, a viable fetus, is capable \r\n  of suffering legal wrong and may maintain action for wrongful death where mother \r\n  and fetus perished in vehicle wreck); Hall v. Murphy, 236 S.C. 257, 113 \r\n  S.E.2d 790 (1960) (unborn child, a viable fetus, may maintain wrongful death \r\n  action where vehicle wreck resulted in premature birth and infant died four \r\n  hours later).\r\nThis authority, however, provides minimal guidance in the present case.Â  Wrongful \r\n  life and wrongful birth actions differ from a typical medical malpractice action \r\n  because the negligent act or omission of the health care provider did not actually \r\n  cause the impairment or defective condition.Â  Instead, the impairment or defective \r\n  condition occurred and the health care provider failed to predict or diagnose \r\n  it, resulting in the birth of a child with a congenital defect.Â  See \r\n  Walker v. Rinck, 604 N.E.2d 591, 594 (Ind. 1992) (distinguishing cases \r\n  in which the defendantâ€™s alleged negligence actually caused an abnormality in \r\n  a fetus or infant who otherwise would have been born normal from cases alleging \r\n  wrongful life or wrongful birth actions); Procanik v. Procanik v. Cillo, \r\n  478 A.2d 755, 760 (N.J. 1984) (same); Taylor v. Kurapati, 600 N.W.2d \r\n  670, 674-75 (Mich. App. 1999) (same). [2] \r\nIn Phillips v. U.S., 508 F. Supp. 537 (D.S.C. 1980), the court predicted \r\n  this Court would not adopt a wrongful life action.Â  The district court rejected \r\n  the notion, as expressed by other courts, that damages were too difficult to \r\n  ascertain because of the Hobsonâ€™s choice between non-existence and an existence \r\n  with a defective condition.Â  The court also rejected the notion that causation \r\n  was a problem, noting plaintiffâ€™s argument was not that physician caused the \r\n  defect, but his failure to predict or diagnose it deprived his parents of the \r\n  opportunity to decide whether to terminate the pregnancy.\r\nThe Phillips court considered but largely discounted other reasons for \r\n  rejecting the action, such as an increase in litigation, the perceived difficulty \r\n  in proving it, that such a decision is better left to the legislature, and that \r\n  the unfathomable theological or philosophical nature of the issue remove it \r\n  from the realm of justiciability.Â  Instead, the Phillips court rejected \r\n  a wrongful life action primarily because recognizing it would violate the fundamental \r\n  public policy of preserving the sanctity and preciousness of human life.Â  Phillips, \r\n  508 F. Supp. at 542-44.Â  \r\nB.Â  ARGUMENTS AGAINST A WRONGFUL LIFE ACTION\r\nTwenty-seven states, by judicial opinion, statute, or both, have either refused \r\n  to recognize or limited a wrongful life action. [3] Â  Three states, discussed below, have allowed \r\n  such a cause of action.Â  Twenty-one jurisdictions, including South Carolina, \r\n  have not addressed the issue.Â  \r\nMost courts refusing to recognize a wrongful life actionÂ  have done so primarily \r\n  for two reasons.Â  First, these courts reason being born is not a legally cognizable \r\n  injury, regardless of the severity of the defective condition afflicting the \r\n  infant or child.Â  Such courts believe it is asking too much to expect any court \r\n  or jury to weigh the fact of being born with a defective condition against the \r\n  fact of not being born at all, i.e., non-existence.Â  Therefore, it is legally \r\n  and logically impossible to calculate damages allegedly suffered by the child.Â  \r\n  E.g., Elliott v. Brown, 361 So.2d 546, 548 (Ala. 1978); Walker \r\n  by Pizano v. Mart, 790 P.2d 735, 740 (Ariz. 1990); Lininger by Lininger \r\n  v. Eisenbaum, 764 P.2d 1202, 1209-10 (Colo. 1988 (en banc); Garrison \r\n  v. Medical Center of Delaware, Inc., 581 A.2d 288, 293-94 (Del. 1990); Kush \r\n  v. Lloyd, 616 So.2d 415, 423 (Fla. 1992); Siemieniec v. Lutheran Gen. \r\n  Hosp., 512 N.E.2d 691, 697-700 (Ill. 1987); Cowe by Cowe v. Forum Group, \r\n  Inc., 575 N.E.2d 630, 634-35 (Ind. 1991); Bruggeman by Bruggeman v. Schimke, \r\n  718 P.2d 635, 639-42 (Kan. 1986); Grubbs ex rel. Grubbs v. Barbourville Family \r\n  Health Center, 120 S.W.3d 682, 689 (Ky. 2003); Kassama v. Magat, \r\n  792 A.2d 1102, 1114-24 (Md. 2002); Wilson v. Kuenzi, 751 S.W.2d 741, \r\n  742 (Mo. 1988); Greco v. U.S., 893 P.2d 345, 347-48 (Nev. 1995); Smith \r\n  v. Cote, 513 A.2d 341, 352-55 (N.H. 1986); Azzolino v. Dingfelder, \r\n  337 S.E.2d 528, 532-33 (N.C. 1985); Nelson v. Krusen, 678 S.W.2d 918, \r\n  924-25 (Tex. 1984).\r\nThe reasoning of these courts often is expressed along the following lines:\r\n \r\n  This judicial reticence [to recognize a wrongful life action] stems partially \r\n    from the fact that the theory amounts to a repudiation of the value of human \r\n    life.Â  The contention of wrongful life plaintiffs is not that they should \r\n    not have been born without defects, but rather, that they should not have \r\n    been born at all.Â  The essence of such claims is that the childâ€™s very life \r\n    is â€œwrongful.â€\r\n  We . . . decline to adopt the doctrine which would recognize such a cause \r\n    of action.Â  Basic to our culture is the precept that life is precious.Â  As \r\n    a society therefore, our laws have as their driving force the purpose of protecting, \r\n    preserving and improving the quality of human existence. To recognize wrongful \r\n    life as a tort would do violence to that purpose and is completely contradictory \r\n    to the belief that life is precious.Â  The fact that Dessie Blake will live \r\n    in a severely disabled condition is unquestionably a tragedy; nevertheless, \r\n    we agree with the New Jersey Supreme Court in that life - whether experienced \r\n    with or without a major physical handicap - is more precious than non-life.Â  \r\n    Thus, because Dessie Blake has suffered no legally cognizable wrong by being \r\n    born, she has no cause of action.\r\n  Even if we were to hold that wrongful life were a legally cognizable injury \r\n    in Idaho, the impossibility of measuring damages would in any event preclude \r\n    recognition of the cause of action. . . . The primary purpose of tort law \r\n    is that of compensating plaintiffs for the injuries they have suffered wrongfully \r\n    at the hands of others.Â  As such, damages are ordinarily computed by comparing \r\n    the condition plaintiff would have been in, had the defendants not been negligent, \r\n    with plaintiffâ€™s impaired condition as a result of the negligence.Â  In the \r\n    case of a claim predicated upon wrongful life, such a computation would require \r\n    the trier of fact to measure the difference in value between life in an impaired \r\n    condition and the utter void of nonexistence.Â  Such an endeavor, however, \r\n    is literally impossible.Â  As Chief Justice Weintraub noted, man, who knows \r\n    nothing of death or nothingness, simply cannot affix a price tag to non-life.\r\n\r\nBlake v. Cruz, 698 P.2d 315, 321-22 (Idaho 1984) (citations and quotes \r\n  omitted).\r\n\r\n  Whether it is better never to have been born at all than to have been born \r\n    with even gross deficiencies is a mystery more properly to be left to the \r\n    philosophers and the theologians.Â  Surely the law can assert no competence \r\n    to resolve the issue, particularly in view of the very nearly uniform high \r\n    value which the law and mankind has placed on human life, rather than its \r\n    absence.Â  Not only is there to be found no predicate at common law or in statutory \r\n    enactment for judicial recognition of the birth of a defective child as an \r\n    injury to the child; the implications of any such proposition are staggering.Â  \r\n    Would claims be honored, assuming the breach of an identifiable duty, for \r\n    less than a perfect birth?Â  And by what standard or by whom would perfection \r\n    be defined?\r\n\r\nBecker v. Schwartz, 386 N.E.2d 807, 812 (N.Y. 1978).\r\nThe second reason some courts reject a wrongful life action is that the physician \r\n  did not actually cause the congenital impairment or defect, which would make \r\n  it improper under established tort principles to hold the physician liable for \r\n  alleged damages.Â  E.g. Walker, 790 P.2d at 740; Lininger, \r\n  764 P.2d at 1212; Garrison, 581 A.2d at 293; Azzolino, 337 S.E.2d \r\n  at 536.\r\nSome courts rejecting both wrongful life and wrongful birth actions have concluded \r\n  the decision on whether to adopt such a cause of action is better left to the \r\n  legislature.Â  E.g. Atlanta Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group v. Abelson, \r\n  398 S.E.2d 557, 560 (Ga. 1990); Gale v. Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology Group \r\n  of Atlanta, P.C., 445 S.E.2d 366 (Ga. App. 1994); Siemieniec, 512 \r\n  N.E.2d at 702; Cowe, 575 N.E.2d at 635; Azzolino, 337 S.E.2d at \r\n  537.\r\nC.Â  ARGUMENTS IN FAVOR OF A WRONGFUL LIFE ACTION\r\nThree states - California, New Jersey, and Washington - have recognized a wrongful \r\n  life action by judicial opinion. [4] \r\nIn Turpin v. Sortini, 643 P.2d 954 (Cal. 1982), the child plaintiff \r\n  alleged physician was negligent in failing to diagnose a hereditary ailment \r\n  that had afflicted her older sister, depriving her of the â€œfundamental right \r\n  of a child to be born as a whole, functional human being without total deafness.â€Â  \r\n  Id. at 960.Â  The California Supreme Court questioned the validity of \r\n  a key rationale used by many other courts to reject a wrongful life action.\r\n \r\n  Although it is easy to understand and to endorse these decisionsâ€™ desire \r\n    to affirm the worth and sanctity of less-than-perfect life, we question whether \r\n    these considerations alone provide a sound basis for rejecting the childâ€™s \r\n    tort action.Â  To begin with, it is hard to see how an award of damages to \r\n    a severely handicapped or suffering child would â€œdisavowâ€ the value of life \r\n    or in any way suggest that the child is not entitled to the full measure of \r\n    legal and nonlegal rights and privileges accorded to all members of society.\r\n  Moreover, while our society and our legal system unquestionably place the \r\n    highest value on all human life, we do not think that it is accurate to suggest \r\n    that this stateâ€™s public policy establishes - as a matter of law - that under \r\n    all circumstances â€œimpaired lifeâ€ is â€œpreferableâ€ to â€œnonlife.â€ . . .\r\n  In this case, in which the plaintiffâ€™s only affliction is deafness, it seems \r\n    quite unlikely that a jury would ever conclude that life with such a condition \r\n    is worse than not being born at all.Â  Other wrongful life cases, however, \r\n    have involved children with much more serious, debilitating and painful conditions, \r\n    and the academic literature refers to still other, extremely severe hereditary \r\n    diseases.Â  Considering the short life span of many of these children and their \r\n    frequently very limited ability to perceive or enjoy the benefits of life, \r\n    we cannot assert with confidence that in every situation there would be a \r\n    societal consensus that life is preferable to never having been born at all.\r\n\r\nId. at 961-63.Â  \r\nThe Turpin court held the child plaintiff could not recover general \r\n  damages, in part endorsing the reasoning of courts which have concluded it is \r\n  impossible to award damages because what the â€œplaintiff has â€˜lostâ€™ is not life \r\n  without pain and suffering, but rather the unknowable status of never having \r\n  been born.â€Â  Id. at 964.Â  However, the court further held the child plaintiff \r\n  could recover extraordinary expenses necessary to treat the defective condition.Â  \r\n  Id. at 965.Â  See also Harbeson v. Parke-Davis, Inc., 656 \r\n  P.2d 483, 494-97 (Wash. 1983) (en banc) (agreeing with Turpin and holding \r\n  child may maintain a wrongful life action to recover extraordinary expenses \r\n  to be incurred during childâ€™s lifetime as result of childâ€™s congenital defect); \r\n  Procanik by Procanik v. Cillo, 478 A.2d 755 (N.J. 1984) (child may maintain \r\n  wrongful life action to recover extraordinary medical expenses related to his \r\n  defective condition, where parents were unable to bring a wrongful birth action, \r\n  which previously had been recognized in that state, because their claim was \r\n  barred by the statute of limitations).\r\nD.Â  THE PRESENT CASE\r\nWe agree with Physician a wrongful life action does not present an ordinary \r\n  tort case and it is difficult, if not impossible, to apply a traditional duty-breach-causation-damages \r\n  analysis to it.Â  We acknowledge, as many courts have done, the formidable theological \r\n  and philosophical issues surrounding such an action.\r\nWe assume, for the sake of argument, Physician owed a duty to Child in utero \r\n  and breached his duty, proximately causing Child to be born with a severe congenital \r\n  defect.Â  A purported lack of causation is not fatal to the case because Child \r\n  is not asserting physician caused the defect, but rather Physicianâ€™s failure \r\n  to predict or diagnose defect deprived mother of the opportunity to decide whether \r\n  to legally terminate the pregnancy.Â  See Phillips, 508 F. Supp. \r\n  at 542.Â  \r\nWe embrace the reasoning espoused by a majority of courts rejecting a wrongful \r\n  life cause of action, and conclude that being born with a naturally occurring \r\n  defect or impairment does not constitute a legally cognizable injury in such \r\n  an action.\r\n We recognize the extremely severe nature of Childâ€™s impairment.Â  It is difficult \r\n  even to begin to describe the nature of Childâ€™s loss within the dry confines \r\n  of a judicial opinion.Â  Nevertheless, we find untenable Childâ€™s argument that \r\n  a child who already has been born should have the chance to prove it would have \r\n  been better if he had never have been born at all.\r\nIn deciding whether to render a verdict in Childâ€™s favor or what damages, if \r\n  any, to award in a case brought by Child, a jury necessarily would face an imponderable \r\n  question:Â  Is a severely impaired life so much worse than no life at all that \r\n  Child is entitled to damages?Â  The minority of courts allowing a wrongful life \r\n  action have not focused on this question.Â  Our civil justice system places inestimable \r\n  faith in the ability of jurors to reach a fair and just result under the law, \r\n  but even a jury collectively imbued with the wisdom of Solomon would be unable \r\n  to weigh the fact of being born with a defective condition against the fact \r\n  of not being born at all, i.e., non-existence.Â  It is simply beyond the human \r\n  experience.Â  Perhaps, as the court mused in Phillips, â€œscientific and \r\n  technological advances, together with the changes in moral attitudes that often \r\n  accompany such advances, may eventually provide a new perspective from which \r\n  to analyze this position.â€Â  Phillips, 508 F. Supp. at 543.Â  Nevertheless, \r\n  we find it persuasive in the instant case and we decline to recognize a cause \r\n  of action for wrongful life brought by or on behalf of a child born with a congenital \r\n  defect.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe decline to recognize a common law cause of action for wrongful life brought \r\n  by or on behalf of a child with a congenital defect.\r\nAFFIRMED.Â  \r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER, J., and Acting Justice Edward B. Cottingham, concur.Â  \r\n  PLEICONES, J., concurring in result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Â  Mother also brought a â€œwrongful \r\n  birthâ€ action on her own behalf in which she seeks damages from Physician in \r\n  connection with Childâ€™s condition.Â  Whether to recognize a cause of action for \r\n  wrongful birth is not before us, and we express no opinion on it.Â  \r\n [2] Â  This result may be different if medical knowledge \r\n  were such that a fetus could be treated prior to birth to cure or alleviate \r\n  Childâ€™s congenital defect.Â  Such a case would resemble prenatal injury cases \r\n  similar to those just described.Â  See Phillips, 508 F.

Zelenka, \r\n          Assistant Attorney General Derrick K. McFarland, all of Columbia, and \r\n          Robert M. Ariail, of Greenville, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE WALLER:Â  Appellant, Freddie Eugene Owens, was convicted of murder, \r\n  armed robbery, use of a firearm in the commission of a violent crime, and conspiracy \r\n  to commit armed robbery; he was sentenced to death.Â  This Court affirmed the \r\n  murder and armed robbery convictions, [1]  but remanded the matter to the circuit court \r\n  for a new sentencing proceeding due to counselâ€™s inability to fully investigate \r\n  a statement made by Owens the day before his sentencing proceeding. [2] Â  State v. Owens, 346 S.C. \r\n  637, 552 S.E.2d 745 (2001).Â  At resentencing, Owens elected a bench trial.Â  \r\n  After a hearing, the trial judge sentenced him to death. \r\nFACTS \r\n  [3] \r\nAt the resentencing proceeding, Owens indicated to the trial court that he \r\n  did not wish to testify.Â  The court advised Owens that if he had a jury trial, \r\n  the jury would be required to unanimously agree on a sentence of death, repeatedly \r\n  telling him that it only took one vote to get a sentence of life.Â  The court \r\n  went on to advise Owens as follows:\r\n\r\n  I want to tell you that itâ€™s not uncommon, and Iâ€™ve had it happen, where \r\n    a potential juror will come in and lie to me about getting on the jury.Â  Some \r\n    of those individuals will come in and lie to me about getting on the jury.Â  \r\n    Some of those individuals will claim to support the death penalty in hopes \r\n    of getting on the jury.Â  Yes [sic], in reality such a juror is opposed to \r\n    the death penalty and would never vote for the death penalty.Â  And they, when \r\n    theyâ€™re selected and the time comes, they refuse to vote for the death penalty \r\n    and will only vote for life.Â  Thatâ€™s happened. . . .\r\n\r\nOwens then indicated his belief that the opposite could also happen, to which \r\n  the trial judge responded, â€œI guess in theory thereâ€™s a chance for that to happen.Â  \r\n  I can tell you what I have described to you is more common, and in fact, has \r\n  happened.Â  And I just leave it at that.Â  It has actually happened.Â  And Iâ€™m \r\n  just being as honest with you as I can.â€Â  \r\nAfter a bench trial, Owens was sentenced to death.Â  He now appeals.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n  Do the trial courtâ€™s comments concerning Owensâ€™ waiver of his right to a \r\n    jury trial constitute reversible error?Â  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nOwens asserts the trial courtâ€™s comments concerning capital sentencing juries \r\n  were fundamentally erroneous, requiring reversal.Â  We agree.\r\nIn State v. Gunter, 286 S.C. 556, 335 S.E.2d 542 (1985), the defendant \r\n  argued the trial court had coerced him into testifying by advising him that, \r\n  if he did not testify, the jury would hold it against him.Â  286 S.C. at 558, \r\n  335 S.E.2d at 543.Â  Although the trial judge advised Gunter he would instruct \r\n  the jury that it could not hold his failure to testify against him, Gunter was \r\n  repeatedly told that the jury was nonetheless likely to do so.Â  Id.Â Â  \r\n  On appeal, this Court held that although a trial judge should establish the \r\n  voluntariness of a defendantâ€™s decision not to testify, â€œ[t]his inquiry must \r\n  be limited in scope, and it is impermissible for the judge to express his opinion, \r\n  although the opinion may be based upon his experience and best judgment. . . \r\n  . How a jury may or may not view a defendant's decision not to testify is not \r\n  an appropriate subject for comment by the court.â€Â  286 S.C. at 559, 335 S.E.2d \r\n  at 543.Â  We found the trial courtâ€™s comments constituted reversible error.\r\nThereafter, this Court decided State v. Pierce, 289 S.C. 430, 346 S.E.2d \r\n  707 (1986), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, 305 \r\n  S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991), and State v. Cooper, 291 S.C. 332, 353 \r\n  S.E.2d 441 (1986), overruled on other grounds by State v. Torrence, \r\n  305 S.C. 45, 406 S.E.2d 315 (1991).Â  In Pierce, the trial judge had similarly \r\n  instructed criminal defendants that if they failed to testify, the jury would \r\n  use it against them.Â  Notably, however, the defendant in Pierce had already \r\n  made up his mind not to testify, and did not change his decision after the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s comments.Â  The state argued that, because Pierce had elected not to \r\n  testify, he had not been influenced by the trial courtâ€™s erroneous comments, \r\n  such that there was no prejudice.Â  We rejected the stateâ€™s contention, stating, \r\n  â€œ[a]lthough Pierce did not testify, he had the right to make that decision free \r\n  of any influence or coercion from the trial judge.Â  It is virtually impossible \r\n  to determine the actual effect the judge's improper statements had on Pierce.â€Â  \r\n  Pierce,Â  289 S.C. at 434, 346 S.E.2d at 710.Â  The facts in Cooper \r\n  are virtually identical to Pierce.Â  See Cooper 291 S.C. at 336-337, \r\n  353 S.E.2d at 443.Â  \r\nSubsequently, in Butler v. State, 302 S.C. 466, 397 S.E.2d 87 (1990), \r\n  we granted a writ of habeas corpus based upon identical comments.Â  There, although \r\n  we specifically noted that neither of the defendants in Cooper or Pierce \r\n  had been swayed by the trial courtâ€™s comments, we nonetheless declined to find \r\n  harmless error, stating that â€œ[in Pierce and Cooper], [w]e rejected \r\n  the suggestion that these types of comments could ever constitute harmless \r\n  error, noting, â€˜[t]he comments by the judge were erroneous, improper and contrary \r\n  to South Carolina law.â€™â€Â Â  Butler, 302 S.C. at 467, 397 S.E.2d at 87 \r\n  (emphasis added).\r\nAs in those cases, the comments here were improper and contrary to South Carolina \r\n  law.Â  Although the trial court must strive to ensure that a criminal defendantâ€™s \r\n  waiver of the right of a jury trial is knowing and voluntary, the court should \r\n  never inject its personal opinion into that decision.Â  The comments here impermissibly \r\n  did so.Â  Accordingly, Owensâ€™ sentence is reversed and the matter remanded for \r\n  a new sentencing proceeding.\r\nREVERSED AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, BURNETT, JJ., and Acting Justice A. Victor Rawl, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n [1] Â  The possession of a weapon during commission \r\n  of a violent crime conviction was vacated pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 16-23-490(A) \r\n  (Supp.2000) (five-year sentence does not apply in cases where death penalty \r\n  orÂ  life sentence without parole is imposed for violent crime).\r\n [2] Â  On January 15, 1999, the day Owens was convicted \r\n  of the murder in question, he was taken back to his jail cell for the night \r\n  to allow the statutory 24-hour waiting period before his sentencing.Â  That evening, \r\n  Owensâ€™ cellmate, Christopher Lee, was brutally murdered in his cell; Owens confessed \r\n  to the murder and gave a very incriminating statement to police.Â Â  Owens \r\n  I, 346 S.C. at 655-657, 552 S.E.2d at 754-755.\r\n [3] Â  The charges in this case stem from the November \r\n  1, 1997, armed robbery of a Speedway convenience store and the fatal shooting \r\n  of the store's clerk, Irene Graves.Â  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Cletus K.
