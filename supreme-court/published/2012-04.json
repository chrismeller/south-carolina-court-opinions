Dept. of Revenue, of Columbia, for\r\n          Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN: \r\n  The State Law Enforcement Division (SLED) conducted a sting operation on the\r\n  Blue Moon Sports Bar, a private club operated by Blue Moon of Newberry, Inc.  After\r\n  SLED's investigation, the Department of Revenue concluded Blue Moon's guest\r\n  policy violated Section 7-401.4(J) through (K) of the South Carolina Code of\r\n  Regulations and revoked Blue Moon's liquor license.  The Administrative Law\r\n  Court (ALC) reinstated Blue Moon's license, and the court of appeals reversed. S.C.\r\n    Dep't of Revenue v. Blue Moon of Newberry, Inc., 387 S.C. 467, 473, 693\r\n  S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 2010).  We granted a writ of certiorari and now reverse\r\n  the decision of the court of appeals.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nBlue Moon is a sports bar located in Newberry, South Carolina, and\r\n  it is incorporated as a nonprofit corporation.  As such, it is subject to the\r\n  provisions concerning the sale of alcoholic beverages by nonprofit organizations\r\n  found in Regulation 7-401.4.  Specifically, the regulation states that\r\n  &quot;[o]nly bona fide members and bona fide guests of members of such\r\n  organizations may consume alcoholic beverages . . . upon the licensed\r\n  premises.&quot; 1 S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 7-401.4(J) (2011).  The regulation\r\n  further provides, &quot;Bona fide guests shall be limited to those who\r\n  accompany a member onto the premises or for whom the member has made prior\r\n  arrangements with the management of the organization.&quot; Id. § 7-401.4(K).\r\nTo test Blue Moon's compliance with these regulations, SLED\r\n  conducted an operation wherein Agent Quincy Ford went undercover and attempted\r\n  to gain access to Blue Moon as a guest.  Agent Ford's first attempt was\r\n  rebuffed by Blue Moon's bouncer when Agent Ford admitted he was not a member of\r\n  the organization.  However, the bouncer directed Agent Ford's attention to a\r\n  sign which contained a telephone number and told Agent Ford that he would be\r\n  allowed to enter if he called that number.[1]\r\nAgent\r\n  Ford called the number as directed, which was the telephone number for Blue\r\n  Moon.  Steve Malone, who is both a member and employee of Blue Moon, answered\r\n  Agent Ford's call.  It is undisputed that Agent Ford did not know Malone or\r\n  have any prior relationship with him whatsoever.  However, Denise Polifrone,\r\n  who is Blue Moon's owner and license holder, had given Malone authority to\r\n  admit people who called as his guests.[2] \r\n  Approximately two to three minutes after he spoke with Malone and gave Malone\r\n  his name, Agent Ford returned to the door.  He showed the bouncer his civilian identification\r\n  and said he had called the number on the sign.  The bouncer then let Agent Ford\r\n  enter the bar after he paid a small cover charge.\r\nOnce\r\n  inside, Agent Ford ordered an alcoholic beverage, paid for it, and consumed a\r\n  small portion of it.  He subsequently called in Agent James Causey, the SLED agent\r\n  in charge of the operation.  Agent Causey arrived and issued Polifrone a\r\n  citation for permitting someone who was not a bona fide member or guest to\r\n  consume alcohol on-premises.  As a result, the Department revoked Blue Moon's\r\n  liquor license.[3]\r\nBlue\r\n  Moon requested a contested case hearing before the ALC, and the only issue\r\n  before the court was whether Agent Ford was a bona fide guest within the\r\n  meaning of Regulation 7-401.4(K).  In finding that he was, the ALC concluded\r\n  there is no requirement that the prior arrangement with management for the\r\n  admission of the guest be made any specific period of time in advance.  The ALC\r\n  also cited the prior administrative law case of South Carolina Department of\r\n    Revenue v. Mir, Inc., No. 04-ALJ-17-0409-CC (S.C. Admin. Law. Ct. May 31,\r\n  2005), for the proposition that there also need not be any pre-existing social\r\n  relationship between the member and the guest.  Accordingly, the ALC found\r\n  Agent Ford's conversation with Malone constituted a prior arrangement with\r\n  management and Agent Ford was thus a bona fide guest within the literal meaning\r\n  of Regulation 7-401.4(K).  The ALC therefore denied the Department's request to\r\n  revoke Blue Moon's license.\r\nOn the\r\n  Department's appeal to the court of appeals, a majority of the panel first\r\n  distinguished Mir, Inc. on the ground that it concerned whether the\r\n  member accompanied the guest onto the premises, not whether prior arrangements\r\n  were made with management. Blue Moon, 387 S.C. at 472, 693 S.E.2d at\r\n  23.  The court further held the ALC examined the term &quot;prior arrangement&quot;\r\n  without regard to the regulation's purpose. See id.  According to the\r\n  court, &quot;[t]he stated purpose of the regulation is to ensure that only bona\r\n  fide members of private clubs and their bona fide guests purchase and consume\r\n  alcoholic beverages at those clubs.&quot; Id. at 472-73, 693 S.E.2d at\r\n  24.  When read in this context, the court held giving Regulation 7-401.4(K) the\r\n  broad reading given to it by the ALC &quot;would eviscerate that purpose.&quot; Id. at 473, 693 S.E.2d at 24.  Hence, the court found the ALC erred in\r\n  concluding Agent Ford was a bona fide guest and granted the Department's\r\n  request to revoke Blue Moon's license. Id.  Judge Pieper dissented,\r\n  writing that the Department must abide by the plain language of the regulation\r\n  it promulgated. Id. at 474, 693 S.E.2d at 24 (Pieper, J., dissenting).\r\nWe\r\n  granted a writ certiorari to review the decision of the court of appeals.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nBlue\r\n  Moon argues the court of appeals erred in holding Agent Ford did not meet the\r\n  definition of a bona fide guest in Regulation 7-401.4(K).  Because we believe\r\n  the court of appeals erred in going beyond the regulation's plain language, we\r\n  agree.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  construction of a regulation is a question of law to be determined by the\r\n  court.&quot; 2 Am. Jur. 2d Administrative Law § 245.  We will correct\r\n  the decision of the ALC if it is affected by an error of law, S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  1-23-380(5)(d) (Supp. 2010), and questions of law are reviewed de novo, Town\r\n    of Summerville v. City of N. Charleston, 378 S.C. 107, 110, 662 S.E.2d 40,\r\n  41 (2008).  Although our review of these questions is de novo, we will\r\n  generally give deference to an agency's interpretation of its own regulation. Brown\r\n    v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 354 S.C. 436, 440, 581 S.E.2d 836, 838 (2003). \r\n  Nevertheless, we will reject the agency's interpretation if it is contrary to\r\n  the regulation's plain language. See id.\r\nRegulations\r\n  are construed using the same canons of construction as statutes. S.C.\r\n    Ambulatory Surgery Ctr. Ass'n v. S.C. Workers' Comp. Comm'n, 389 S.C. 380,\r\n  389, 699 S.E.2d 146, 151 (2010).  Accordingly, &quot;[t]he words of a\r\n  regulation must be given their plain and ordinary meaning without resort to\r\n  subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the regulation's\r\n  operation.&quot; Byerly v. Connor, 307 S.C. 441, 444, 415 S.E.2d 796,\r\n  799 (1992).  Furthermore, the regulation must be construed as a whole rather\r\n  than read in its component parts in isolation. Spruill v. Richland Cnty.\r\n    Sch. Dist. 2, 363 S.C. 61, 64, 609 S.E.2d 524, 526 (2005).  However, if\r\n  applying the regulation's plain language would lead to an absurd result, we\r\n  will interpret the regulation in a manner which avoids the absurdity. See\r\n    Cabiness v. Town of James Island, 393 S.C. 176, 192, 712 S.E.2d 416, 425\r\n  (2011).  &quot;A merely conjectural absurdity is not enough; the result must be\r\n  'so patently absurd that it is clear that the [General Assembly] could not have\r\n  intended such a result.'&quot; Id. (quoting Harris v. Anderson Cnty.\r\n    Sheriff's Office, 381 S.C. 357, 363 n.1, 673 S.E.2d 423, 426 n.1 (2009)).\r\n\r\nThe\r\n  South Carolina Constitution grants the General Assembly the power to issue\r\n  alcoholic beverage licenses to two types of establishments: (1)\r\n  &quot;businesses which engage primarily and substantially in the preparation\r\n  and serving of meals or furnishing of lodging,&quot; and (2) &quot;certain\r\n  nonprofit organizations with limited membership not open to the general\r\n  public.&quot; S.C. Const. art. VIII-A, § 1.  The General Assembly has in turn\r\n  defined a nonprofit organization for these purposes as &quot;an organization\r\n  not open to the general public, but with a limited membership and established\r\n  for social, benevolent, patriotic, recreational, or fraternal purposes.&quot;[4] S.C. Code Ann. § 61-6-20(6) (2009).  Similarly, the General Assembly provided\r\n  that &quot;[a] nonprofit organization which is licensed by the [D]epartment\r\n  pursuant to the provisions of this article may sell alcoholic liquors by the\r\n  drink.  A member or guest of a member of a nonprofit organization may consume\r\n  alcoholic liquors sold by the drink upon the premises . . . .&quot; Id. § 61-6-1600(A).\r\nThe\r\n  Department has interpreted[5] section 61-6-1600 as being evidence of the General Assembly's intent\r\n\r\n  that a\r\n    license shall not be granted to or held by an organization which is, or has\r\n    been, organized and operated primarily to obtain or hold a license to sell\r\n    alcoholic beverages, but only to bona fide nonprofit organization with limited\r\n    membership to which the sale of alcoholic beverages is incidental to the main\r\n    purpose of the organization.\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  7-401.4(A) (2011).  \r\nTo\r\n  that end, the Department promulgated the two subsections of Regulation 7-401.4\r\n  at the heart of this case:\r\n\r\n  J. Only bona fide members and bona\r\n    fide guests of members of such organizations may consume alcoholic beverages .\r\n    . . upon the licensed premises.\r\n  K. Bona fide guests shall be limited\r\n    to those who accompany a member onto the premises or for whom the member has made\r\n    prior arrangements with the management of the organization.\r\n\r\nThe question presently before\r\n  us is whether Agent Ford was a bona fide guest when he was able to call a\r\n  number posted near the door and obtain permission to enter from a member with\r\n  whom he had no prior relationship.\r\nBased on the plain\r\n  language of Regulation 7-401.4(K), we hold Agent Ford was a bona fide guest. \r\n  Subsection (K) specifically prohibits on-premises consumption of alcohol by a\r\n  non-member unless he is either personally accompanied onto the premises by a\r\n  member or a member has made a prior arrangement with management for him.  By\r\n  its own terms, Regulation 7-401.4(K) imposes no other requirements.  In this\r\n  case, Agent Ford was not accompanied into Blue Moon by a member.  Instead, prior\r\n  to entering the premises and consuming his drink, he spoke with a member who\r\n  was authorized by management to permit guests to enter.  Thus, Agent Ford was a\r\n  bona fide guest within the letter of the regulation.\r\nThe Department does\r\n  not dispute the ALC's conclusion that Agent Ford technically had a prior\r\n  arrangement with management.  Instead, it argues subsection (K) does not\r\n  actually define who is a bona fide guest.  The Department's view is that it\r\n  merely limits admission to a certain subset of bona fide guests, i.e., one must\r\n  be a bona fide guest and either be accompanied by a member or make prior\r\n  arrangements with management.  In our opinion, subsection (K) does no such\r\n  thing but rather simply defines what constitutes a bona fide guest.  \r\nFurthermore,\r\n  the regulation's plain language is wholly consistent with the definition of\r\n  bona fide.  Bona fide means &quot;[m]ade in good faith&quot; and &quot;without\r\n  fraud or deceit,&quot; or &quot;sincere&quot; and &quot;genuine.&quot; Black's\r\n  Law Dictionary 75 (3d pocket ed.).  As the court recognized in Mir, Inc.,\r\n  &quot;the regulation precludes a private club from accepting the 'word' of an\r\n  individual that he is a guest of a member without verification from the member,\r\n  but allows the club to accept a person as a bona fide guest if his status is\r\n  confirmed by the presence or prior notification of a member.&quot; No.\r\n  04-ALJ-17-0409-CC.  Thus, the requirement that a guest be bona fide is to\r\n  ferret out those who might feign the approval of a member by mandating that the\r\n  guest either be accompanied by a member or have the member personally make\r\n  prior arrangements for him with management.  If he meets either of these\r\n  criteria, he is a true guest—he has his bona fides[6] by actually being invited by a member—and not someone who has faked a member's\r\n  invitation.\r\nNevertheless,\r\n  the Department contends the term bona fide implies that the guest have some\r\n  degree of familiarity or camaraderie with the member, as does the dissent, or\r\n  an allegiance to the organization's purpose.  However, the plain language of\r\n  the regulation contains no support for this, and the ordinary definition of\r\n  bona fide does not require it.  Thus, adopting the Department's and the\r\n  dissent's view would be an improper narrowing of the regulatory definition\r\n  based on some notion of what a bona fide guest should be, not what the\r\n  regulation actually provides. See Byerly, 307 S.C. at 444, 415 S.E.2d at\r\n  799 (1992) (&quot;[T]he words of a regulation must be given their plain and ordinary\r\n  meaning without resort to subtle or forced construction to limit or expand the\r\n  regulation's operation.&quot;).  For us to do so therefore would require the\r\n  abdication of our role as the interpreter of a regulation and the assumption of\r\n  the position of a drafter.\r\nMoreover,\r\n  such a construction would prove utterly unworkable.  Because Regulation\r\n  7-401.4(K) uses the term bona fide generally, we would only be able to adopt\r\n  the vague standards above.  Accordingly, we would be in no position to say how\r\n  much of a relationship is sufficient or what quantum of adherence to the\r\n  organization's mission passes muster.[7] \r\n    Additionally, the oral arguments before us amply demonstrated that this\r\n  interpretation would undoubtedly lead down the slippery slope of the Department\r\n  assessing the subjective relationship between the member and his guest or the\r\n  guest's adherence to the mores and values of the organization.[8] \r\n  Under the Department's view, each private club's guest policy thus would be\r\n  subject to the uncertain whim of the Department as to what threshold of\r\n  connection is necessary.  This would be of little comfort to organizations\r\n  which are trying to ensure their practices comply with controlling regulations.\r\nWe\r\n  therefore agree with the sentiment expressed by Judge Pieper in his dissent at\r\n  the court of appeals: \r\n\r\n  If the\r\n    Department of Revenue has an issue with how the regulation itself defines\r\n    &quot;bona fide guest,&quot; then it may promulgate a new regulation as\r\n    appropriate upon proper notice to the public.  Until then, other businesses\r\n    which follow the unambiguous language of the regulation should not be punished\r\n    as a result.\r\n\r\nBlue Moon, 387 S.C. at 474, 693 S.E.2d at 24 (Pieper, J.,\r\n  dissenting).  As he correctly points out, many organizations have relied upon\r\n  the plain language of Regulation 7-401.4(K) and it would be improper for us to\r\n  come in now and alter its terms. \r\nAccordingly,\r\n  we hold Blue Moon has complied with the plain language of the regulation, and\r\n  we are not in a position to judicially engraft the requirements sought by the\r\n  Department.  However, the court of appeals held that to give bona fide guest\r\n  this broad reading would &quot;eviscerate&quot; the purpose of the regulation,\r\n  which is to limit those who may consume alcohol on the premises of private\r\n  clubs. Id. at 473, 693 S.E.2d at 24 (majority opinion).  In essence, the\r\n  argument is that sanctioning Blue Moon's guest policy would be an absurd result\r\n  as it effectively allows a private club to be open to the public.  While we are\r\n  cognizant of the fact that the plain language of Regulation 7-401.4(K) may\r\n  permit some organizations to push the envelope on what it means to be\r\n  &quot;private,&quot; we are not convinced the result is so absurd that we can\r\n  ignore the regulation's plain language.\r\nWithout\r\n  a doubt, the current statutory and regulatory scheme evinces a policy of\r\n  restricting who can consume alcohol on the premises of a private club. See S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 61-6-20(6) (defining nonprofit organization as one &quot;not open\r\n  to the general public, but with a limited membership and established for\r\n  social, benevolent, patriotic, recreational, or fraternal purposes&quot;); S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. Regs. 7-401.4(A) (stating licenses shall be granted only to those\r\n  nonprofit organizations &quot;with limited membership to which the sale of alcoholic\r\n  beverages is incidental to the main purpose of the organization&quot; and not\r\n  to one &quot;which is, or has been, organized and operated primarily to obtain\r\n  or hold a license to sell alcoholic beverages&quot;).  Our constitution also\r\n  draws a distinction between private clubs, and restaurants and hotels serving\r\n  the public. S.C. Const. art. VIII-A, § 1 (&quot;[L]icenses may be granted to\r\n  sell and consume alcoholic liquors and beverages on the premises of businesses\r\n  which engage primarily and substantially in the preparation and serving of meals\r\n  or furnishing of lodging or on the premises of certain nonprofit\r\n  organizations with limited membership not open to the general public . . .\r\n  .&quot; (emphasis added)).\r\nHowever,\r\n  the statutes and regulations also envision guests being able to participate in\r\n  the functions of a private club. See S.C. Code Ann. § 61-6-1600(A)\r\n  (&quot;A member or a guest of a member of a nonprofit organization may consume\r\n  alcoholic liquors . . . .&quot;); S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 7-401.4(J) (&quot;Only\r\n  bona fide members and bona fide guests of members of such organizations may\r\n  consume alcoholic beverages . . . .&quot;).  Indeed, guests play an important\r\n  part in any private club, not only through the possibility that they may join\r\n  and increase the membership rolls but also in that they routinely participate\r\n  in the organization's functions and support its missions.  We also cannot\r\n  lose sight of the fact that the consumption of alcohol is supposed to be\r\n  incidental to the main purpose of the organization.  A strict guest rule aimed\r\n  solely at curbing the consumption of alcohol, a secondary objective, may\r\n  prevent others from participating in the organization's activities and actually\r\n  hinder the achievement of its primary goals.  We are therefore not convinced\r\n  that permitting a liberal guest policy is so patently absurd that the General\r\n  Assembly would not have intended it or it would run afoul of the constitution.  \r\nIn\r\n  conclusion, we hold the court of appeals erred in going beyond the plain\r\n  language of the regulation.  Based on the literal terms of Regulation\r\n  7-401.4(K), Agent Ford was a bona fide guest because a member made prior\r\n  arrangements with management.  Contrary to the dissent's assertion, we do not\r\n  &quot;sanction&quot; Blue Moon's practice; we merely hold its policy comports\r\n  with the plain language of the regulation.  If the Department desires stricter\r\n  standards, it is certainly at liberty to revise Regulation 7-401.4(K)\r\n  accordingly.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the foregoing\r\n  reasons, we reverse the decision of the court of appeals and find Blue Moon\r\n  complied with the plain language of Regulation 7-401.4(K).  Accordingly, we\r\n  deny the Department's request to revoke Blue Moon's license.  Because our\r\n  resolution of this question is dispositive, we decline to address the other\r\n  issues on which we granted certiorari.\r\nPLEICONES and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur. KITTREDGE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  KITTREDGE:  Because I believe the\r\n  court of appeals correctly analyzed and decided this case, I respectfully\r\n  dissent.  The question presented is whether Agent Quincy Ford was a &quot;bona\r\n  fide&quot; guest of a member of the Blue Moon Sports Bar when he gained entry\r\n  to the private club.  In my judgment, Agent Ford clearly was not a bona fide\r\n  guest.  As the majority of the court of appeals noted, construing the\r\n  applicable regulation as giving Agent Ford the imprimatur of a bona fide guest\r\n  &quot;would eviscerate&quot; its purpose.  S.C. Dep't of Rev. v. Blue Moon\r\n    of Newberry, Inc., 387 S.C. 467, 473, 693 S.E.2d 21, 24 (Ct. App. 2010).  I\r\n  agree and would affirm the court of appeals.\r\nThe\r\n  facts are not in dispute.  Blue Moon\r\n  placed an advertisement outside its door indicating the telephone number to\r\n  call for admission.  Agent Ford was stopped by the doorman when he attempted to\r\n  enter the bar.  The doorman instructed Agent Ford to call the telephone number posted\r\n  so that Agent Ford could gain permission to enter the bar.  Agent Ford called\r\n  the number and spoke to Steve Malone, who is a Blue Moon employee and member. \r\n  Malone gave Agent Ford, a complete stranger, permission to enter the bar.  The\r\n  doorman allowed Agent Ford into the bar, and Agent Ford purchased and drank an\r\n  alcoholic beverage.\r\nIn\r\n  reversing the court of appeals, rejecting the agency's interpretation of its\r\n  own regulation and holding that Agent Ford was a bona fide guest, the Court\r\n  claims it is applying the plain language of the regulation.  I believe the\r\n  plain language and meaning of Regulation 7-401.4(K) compels a finding that\r\n  Agent Ford was not a bona fide guest.  Although I do not disagree with the\r\n  majority regarding the potential &quot;slippery slope of the Department\r\n  assessing the subjective relationship between the member and his guest,&quot;\r\n  this case is far removed from any slippery slope.  The fact that applying the\r\n  regulation may prove problematic in another case does not justify reversal of\r\n  the court of appeals under these facts.  Here, we need not struggle with\r\n  notions of &quot;subjective relationship&quot; or otherwise, for Agent Ford and\r\n  Malone had no relationship at all.  \r\nThe\r\n  agency's interpretation of Regulation 7-401.4(K) is not only entitled to\r\n  deference, it is also in accord with common sense when applied to the\r\n  undisputed facts of this case.  Moreover, the agency's interpretation of the\r\n  regulation is consistent with the South Carolina Constitution.  See S.C.\r\n  Const. art. VIII-A, § 1 (&quot;[L]icenses may be granted to sell and consume\r\n  alcoholic liquors and beverages . . . on the premises of certain nonprofit\r\n  organizations with limited membership not open to the general public . . .\r\n  .&quot;).  Yet today, the Court sanctions a sham practice that effectively\r\n  transforms a purported private, nonprofit establishment into one open to the\r\n  public.  \r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The sign read, &quot;If You Are Not A Member Call\r\n  Before You Get To The Door 276-****.&quot;\r\n[2] Polifrone testified that she discussed this set-up\r\n  with individuals from SLED and the Department, all of whom said this\r\n  arrangement was permissible.\r\n[3] It appears this was Blue Moon's third offense.  Blue\r\n  Moon did not challenge the prior two offenses because its liquor license was\r\n  not at stake and it was easier to just pay the fine.\r\n[4] Before the ALC, the Department attempted to elicit\r\n  testimony from Polifrone that Blue Moon was not a valid nonprofit for alcoholic\r\n  beverage purposes.  However, the court prevented the Department from\r\n  doing so upon Blue Moon's objection that this question was not before it.  The\r\n  Department did not appeal this issue to the court of appeals, and therefore we\r\n  must assume Blue Moon meets these requirements.\r\n[5] Section 61-2-60 of the South Carolina Code (2009)\r\n  grants the Department authority to promulgate regulations under Title 61.\r\n[6] &quot;Vernon here's got a job.  Vernon's got\r\n  prospects.  He's bona fide.  What are you?&quot; O Brother, Where Art Thou?\r\n  (Touchstone Pictures 2000).\r\n[7] Enforcement of this latter requirement would pose a\r\n  particularly vexing challenge for organizations, as an undercover officer entering\r\n  solely to investigate their guest policies, as Agent Ford did at Blue Moon,\r\n  could never be a bona fide guest because he would not share in their beliefs.\r\n[8] The dissent's contention that we need not enter this\r\n  fray because Agent Ford and Malone were complete strangers presupposes some\r\n  prior relationship is required under Regulation 7-401.4(K).  For the reasons\r\n  stated above, we disagree.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27107","title":"16 Jade Street v.

Freeman, both of Griffith, Sadler &amp; Sharp,\r\n          of Beaufort, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE HEARN:  This case presents the novel question of whether a member of a\r\n  limited liability company can be held personally liable for torts committed\r\n  while acting in furtherance of the company's business.  We hold the General\r\n  Assembly did not intend the LLC act to shield a member from liability for his\r\n  own torts.  \r\n\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nCarl R.\r\n  Aten, Jr., and his wife are the only members of R. Design Construction Co., LLC. \r\n  R. Design's primary business is building houses for spec, and Aten holds a\r\n  residential home builder's license.  In this particular case, R. Design\r\n  selected a lot in Beaufort, South Carolina, on which it planned to build a\r\n  four-unit condominium project.  When Aten could not secure the necessary financing,\r\n  he approached Dennis Green about entering into a contract for R. Design to\r\n  construct the building.  Green ultimately formed 16 Jade Street, LLC for this\r\n  purpose, and R. Design entered into an agreement with Jade Street for the\r\n  construction of the condominium.\r\nAs part\r\n  of the deal, Aten was to receive a $150,000 fee to serve as the general\r\n  contractor for the project, and he alone was in charge of choosing\r\n  subcontractors.  One of the subcontractors selected by R. Design was Catterson\r\n  &amp; Sons Construction.  Michael Catterson is the sole shareholder of\r\n  Catterson &amp; Sons, and he is a specialty subcontractor with a special\r\n  license for framing in addition to holding his general contractor's license. \r\n  Catterson &amp; Sons' scope of work accordingly was focused primarily on\r\n  framing and AAC block[1] installation.\r\nAs the\r\n  general contractor, it was Aten's job to supervise the project.  Thus, whenever\r\n  Catterson had a question about the work he was to perform or any issues that\r\n  arose, he would ask Aten.  Furthermore, Catterson &amp; Sons was to implement\r\n  the design standards set by Aten and R. Design.  Catterson himself, however,\r\n  did not actually perform any construction but served mainly as the liaison\r\n  between the foreman and his own workers.\r\nA\r\n  couple months into construction, problems arose concerning the AAC block\r\n  construction and the framing.  Green called Kern-Coleman, the structural\r\n  engineer of record, to perform an inspection of the property.  The initial\r\n  inspection identified four defects, but Green pressed on following Aten's\r\n  assurances that these problems would be addressed.  However, the problems did\r\n  not abate.  Following a progress payment dispute, Catterson &amp; Sons left the\r\n  job site and did not return.  In the ensuing months, Aten's relationship with\r\n  Green deteriorated as Aten tarried in fixing the defects, and the construction\r\n  eventually ground to a halt.  R. Design subsequently left the project, never replacing\r\n  Catterson &amp; Sons nor adequately addressing the defects.\r\nThe day\r\n  after R. Design left the project, Kern-Coleman conducted another inspection of\r\n  the property.  This time, it identified thirty-four defects in addition to the\r\n  original four, which had not yet been remedied, for a total of thirty-eight. \r\n  Anchor Construction was retained as the new general contractor, and its own inspection\r\n  revealed sixty defects in the original construction.  After Anchor began\r\n  working on the project, more defects surfaced.\r\nJade\r\n  Street subsequently sued R. Design, Aten, Catterson &amp; Sons, and Catterson\r\n  for negligence[2] and breach of implied warranties.  Jade Street also filed a breach of contract\r\n  claim against R. Design and Aten.[3] \r\n  Following a bench trial, the circuit court found in favor of Jade Street as\r\n  follows: (1) against R. Design for breach of contract, negligence, and breach\r\n  of implied warranties; (2) against Catterson &amp; Sons for negligence and\r\n  breach of contract; and (3) against Aten personally for negligence.  As to Aten\r\n  personally, the circuit court concluded that despite the fact he was a member\r\n  of an LLC, he is personally liable because he holds a residential home\r\n  builder's license.  In particular, the court concluded the statutes pertaining\r\n  to the license create civil liability for the licensee.  The court imposed no\r\n  liability against Catterson himself.  The court ultimately awarded Jade Street\r\n  $925,556 in damages for its claims.  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES PRESENTED\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Did the circuit court err in\r\n  finding Aten can be held personally liable for negligent acts he committed\r\n  while working for an LLC of which he was a member?\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II. \r\n    Did the circuit court err in not\r\n  finding Catterson personally liable for the tort obligations incurred by\r\n  Catterson &amp; Sons?\r\n  \r\n\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nI. ATEN'S PERSONAL\r\n  LIABILITY\r\nAten argues the provisions of the Uniform Limited Liability\r\n  Company Act, as enacted in South Carolina, shield him from personal liability\r\n  for ordinary negligence he committed while working for R. Design.  While we\r\n  agree the language of the LLC act appears to insulate a member from personal\r\n  liability, we hold that such a sweeping liability shield was not intended by\r\n  the General Assembly.\r\n&quot;The\r\n  cardinal rule of statutory construction is to ascertain and effectuate the\r\n  intent of the legislature.&quot; Hodges v. Rainey, 341 S.C. 79, 85, 533\r\n  S.E.2d 578, 581 (2000).  Where the words in the statute are clear and\r\n  unambiguous, we cannot give them a different meaning. Id.  If the\r\n  statute is in derogation of a common law right, it &quot;must be strictly\r\n  construed and not extended in application beyond clear legislative intent. \r\n  Therefore, a statute is not to be construed in derogation of common law rights\r\n  if another interpretation is reasonable.&quot; Doe v. Marion, 361 S.C.\r\n  463, 473, 605 S.E.2d 556, 561 (Ct. App. 2004).  However, the statute must also\r\n  be read as a whole and in harmony with its purpose. State v. Sweat, 386\r\n  S.C. 339, 350, 688 S.E.2d 569, 575 (2010).  In that vein, &quot;[a] statute as\r\n  a whole must receive a practical, reasonable, and fair interpretation consonant\r\n  with the purpose, design, and policy of the lawmakers.&quot; Browning v.\r\n    Hartvigsen, 307 S.C. 122, 125, 414 S.E.2d 115, 117 (1992).  Similarly, we\r\n  are to construe a statute so &quot;that no word, clause, sentence, provision or\r\n  part shall be rendered surplusage, or superfluous.&quot; In re Decker,\r\n  322 S.C. 215, 219, 471 S.E.2d 462, 463 (1995).  In the end, however, we will\r\n  reject any interpretation which would lead to a result so absurd that the\r\n  General Assembly could not have intended it. Sweat, 386 S.C. at 351, 688\r\n  S.E.2d at 575.\r\nThe statute\r\n  at issue in this case is Section 33-44-303 of the South Carolina Code (2006),\r\n  which reads as follows:\r\n\r\n  (a) Except as otherwise provided in\r\n    subsection (c), the debts, obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability\r\n    company, whether arising in contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts,\r\n    obligations, and liabilities of the company.  A member or manager is not\r\n    personally liable for a debt, obligation, or liability of the company solely by\r\n    reason of being or acting as a member or manager.\r\n  (b) The failure of a limited liability\r\n    company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to\r\n    the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a\r\n    ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for liabilities\r\n    of the company.\r\n  (c) All or specified members of a\r\n    limited liability company are liable in their capacity as members for all or\r\n    specified debts, obligations, or liabilities of the company if:\r\n  \r\n    (1) a provision to that effect is\r\n      contained in the articles of organization; and\r\n    (2) a member so liable has consented\r\n      in writing to the adoption of the provision or to be bound by the provision.[4]\r\n  \r\n\r\nThe record before us does not\r\n  contain the articles of organization for R. Design, so we are unable to\r\n  determine whether subsection (c) would impose liability on Aten.  The question\r\n  thus becomes whether the General Assembly intended subsection (a) to generally\r\n  shield members from personal liability for acts they commit in furtherance of\r\n  the company's business.\r\nThis is a question of first impression in this State.  We note\r\n  that a majority of states to examine similar statutory language have concluded\r\n  that a member is always liable for his own torts and cannot rely on his status\r\n  as a member of an LLC as a shield.[5] See, e.g, Hoang v. Arbess, 80 P.3d 863, 867 (Colo. App. 2003); Ventures v.\r\n    Goodspeed Airport, LLC, 881 A.2d 937, 963-64 (Conn. 2005); Milk v. Total\r\n      Pay &amp; HR Solutions, Inc., 634 S.E.2d 208, 213 (Ga. Ct. App. 2006); Allen v. Dackman, 991 A.2d 1216, 1228-29 (Md. 2010); Rothstein v. Equity\r\n        Ventures, LLC, 750 N.Y.S.2d 625, 627 (App. Div. 2002); d'Elia v. Rice\r\n          Dev., Inc, 147 P.3d 515, 525 (Utah Ct. App. 2006).  Additionally, many\r\n  scholars opine that LLC statutes do not insulate a member from tort liability\r\n  primarily due to the common law concept that one is always liable for his\r\n  torts. See Matthew G. Doré, What, Me Worry? Tort Liability Risks for\r\n    Participants in LLCs, 11 U.C. Davis Bus. L.J. 267, 271 (2011); Karin\r\n  Schwindt, Limited Liability Companies: Issues in Member Liability, 44\r\n  UCLA L. Rev. 1541, 1548 (1997); Jeffrey K. Vandervoot, Piercing the Veil of\r\n    Limited Liability Companies: The Need for a Better Standard, 3 DePaul Bus.\r\n  &amp; Com. L.J. 51, 56 (2004).  In their view, the liability shield erected is\r\n  one against vicarious liability for non-tortfeasor members, such as Aten's wife\r\n  in this case. See Doré, supra, at 285-86.  No party in this\r\n  matter contends that section 33-44-303 does not at least provide this cover.\r\nOn\r\n  the other hand, a few courts appear to have concluded that their states' LLC\r\n  statutes do shield a member from personal liability for at least some of his\r\n  own tortious conduct. See, e.g., Puleo v. Topel, 856 N.E.2d 1152,\r\n  1157 (Ill. App. Ct. 2006); Barone v. Perkins, No. 2007-CA-000838-MR,\r\n  2008 WL 2468792, at *4 (Ky. Ct. App. 2008) (unpublished); Curole v. Ochsner\r\n    Clinic, L.L.C., 811 So. 2d 92, 97 (La. Ct. App. 2002); Brew City Redev.\r\n      Grp., LLC v. The Ferchill Grp., 714 N.W.2d 582, 590-91 (Wis. Ct. App.\r\n  2006); see also Jeffrey S. Quinn, Allen v. Dackman: Doing Away with\r\n    Limited Liability in Maryland, 70 Md. L. Rev. 1171, 1210 (2011) (stating\r\n  that the Allen court &quot;mistakenly disregarded the economically\r\n  important liability shield of an LLC by inappropriately making Dackman\r\n  personally liable for what is essentially the tortious conduct of the\r\n  LLC&quot;).\r\nWe begin our analysis by examining the plain language of section\r\n  33-44-303(a) and the intent\r\n  of our General Assembly with respect to the common law right to sue one's\r\n  tortfeasor.  We acknowledge that the statute's\r\n  language may be read to shield a member from personal liability for torts he\r\n  commits in furtherance of the LLC's business.  Although Section 33-44-201 of the South Carolina Code (2006) provides\r\n  that an LLC and its members are separate entities, because an LLC is a\r\n  fictional person it can only operate through its agents, who oftentimes are its\r\n  members.  Accordingly, any debt, obligation, or liability the LLC incurs can\r\n  only arise from the actions of an agent.  Using R. Design as an example, if it\r\n  incurs a tort liability, it can only be through a tort committed by Aten or his\r\n  wife, assuming the LLC has no other employees or agents.  Section 33-44-303(a)\r\n  states that a member or manager is not personally liable for these obligations\r\n  &quot;solely by reason of being or acting as a member or manager.&quot;[6]  This is the source of the protection against vicarious liability, meaning\r\n  Aten's wife would not be personally liable for Aten's negligence—which is an\r\n  LLC obligation—just because she happens to be a member of R. Design.\r\nAdditionally,\r\n  section 33-44-303(a) provides that these obligations are &quot;solely&quot;\r\n  those of the company.  Because R. Design could only incur a tort obligation\r\n  through a tort committed by Aten or his wife, this language suggests R. Design\r\n  alone is responsible for torts committed by Aten in the course of the company's\r\n  business.[7] Accord S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-301(a)(2) (&quot;An act of a member which is\r\n  not apparently for carrying on in the ordinary course of the company's business\r\n  or business of the kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was authorized by the other members.&quot; (emphasis added)); id. § 33-44-301(b)(2) (&quot;An act of a manager which is not apparently for\r\n  carrying on in the ordinary course of the company's business or business of the\r\n  kind carried on by the company binds the company only if the act was\r\n  authorized under Section 33-44-404.&quot; (emphasis added)).  Thus, section\r\n  33-44-303(a) arguably insulates a member from personal liability in these\r\n  situations. \r\nNevertheless,\r\n  the right to sue one's tortfeasor is a long-standing right in our legal system,\r\n  and we will only find it abrogated by statute through &quot;clear legislative\r\n  intent.&quot; See Doe, 361 S.C. at 473, 605 S.E.2d at 561. Stated differently,\r\n  &quot;[s]tatutes will not be held in derogation of the common law unless the\r\n  statute itself shows that such was the object and intention of the lawmakers,\r\n  and the common law will not be changed by doubtful implication.&quot; 82 C.J.S. Statutes § 534.  &quot;Therefore, a statute is not to be construed in\r\n  derogation of common law rights if another interpretation is reasonable.&quot; Doe,\r\n  361 S.C. at 473, 605 S.E.2d at 561.  While construing section 33-44-303 to\r\n  limit personal liability may be a permissible reading of the statute, we are\r\n  not persuaded that this was the intent of the General Assembly.  First, it is\r\n  the interpretation afforded to similar language by a majority of courts and\r\n  reflects the prevailing interpretation of an LLC's limitation of liability. See\r\n    Hoang, 80 P.3d at 867; Ventures, 881 A.2d at 963-64; Milk,\r\n  634 S.E.2d at 213; Allen, 991 A.2d at 1228-29; Rothstein, 750\r\n  N.Y.S.2d at 627; d'Elia, 147 P.3d at 525; Doré, supra, at 271; Schwindt, supra, at 1548; Vandervoot, supra, at 56. Furthermore, it\r\n  comports with the comments to section 33-44-303[8] and section 33-44-303's kin in the Revised Limited Liability Company Act.[9]\r\nMore\r\n  importantly, this also has long been the rule with respect to shareholders and\r\n  officers of corporations, an organizational structure from which LLCs borrow\r\n  heavily. See S.C. Code Ann. § 33-6-220(b) (&quot;[A] shareholder of a corporation is not personally liable for the acts\r\n  or debts of the corporation except that he may become personally liable by\r\n  reason of his own acts or conduct.&quot;); see also Hoang, 80 P.3d at\r\n  867 (stating parties did not dispute that corporate liability principles apply\r\n  to LLCs); Ventures, 881 A.2d at 964 (holding that Connecticut's LLC\r\n  statute &quot;merely codifies&quot; established liability principles of\r\n  corporate law); Allen, 991 A.2d at 1228 (applying general liability rule\r\n  from corporations to LLCs); d'Elia, 147 P.3d at 525 (&quot;We are\r\n  persuaded by those authorities that hold that both limited liability members\r\n  and corporate officers should be treated in a similar manner when they are\r\n  engaged in tortious conduct.&quot;).  Indeed, Judge Posner once observed,\r\n  &quot;You don't buy immunity from suits for your torts by being a member of a\r\n  business corporation.&quot; Hoagland ex rel. Midwest Transit, Inc. v.\r\n    Sandberg, Phoenix, &amp; von Gontard, P.C., 385 F.3d 737, 744 (7th Cir.\r\n  2004). We can find no evidence the General Assembly intended to abandon this\r\n  rule with respect to LLCs.\r\nAt\r\n  first blush, this appears to strip away one of the main reasons why a person\r\n  chooses to form an LLC. See Quinn, supra, at 1216 (&quot;The\r\n  economic justifications and, specifically, the concept of limited liability\r\n  support an interpretation of the [LLC act] that protects members from personal\r\n  liability when acting in good faith service of the LLC.&quot;).  Our concern\r\n  with concluding section 33-44-303(a) only protects against vicarious liability\r\n  for torts of others becomes particularly acute with respect to single-member\r\n  LLCs which have no other employees.  In one of these single-member LLCs, there\r\n  simply is no one to protect from vicarious liability as one cannot be\r\n  vicariously liable for his own actions.  However, there are myriad other\r\n  benefits available to those who choose to form an LLC, and we are not persuaded\r\n  that limiting the shield of section 33-44-303(a) to just vicarious liability\r\n  would undermine the core of this business entity.  Accordingly, we find this interpretation\r\n  reasonable and no clear intent by the General Assembly to restrict the common\r\n  law.  While the language of the statute may be subject to other interpretations,\r\n  we believe it is highly questionable whether the General Assembly intended to\r\n  limit a member's personal liability for his torts.  Therefore, given the\r\n  principle that we strictly construe statutes in derogation of common law rights\r\n  and they only do so through clear legislative intent, we hold section 33-44-303(a)\r\n  does not limit the right of a plaintiff to sue his tortfeasor.\r\nIn\r\n  sum, we conclude that section 33-44-303(a) only protects non-tortfeasor members\r\n  from vicarious liability and does not insulate the tortfeasor himself from personal\r\n  liability for his actions.  We accordingly find the circuit court did not err\r\n  in finding Aten personally liable for torts he committed in furtherance of R.\r\n  Design's business.  We note the circuit court did not reach Aten's argument\r\n  that section 33-44-303(a) removed any personal liability on his part and\r\n  instead found Aten's residential home builders' license rendered him personally\r\n  liable.  While we disagree with the circuit court's findings regarding Aten's\r\n  license, the scope of section 33-44-303 was raised to the trial court and is an\r\n  additional sustaining ground. See Rule 220(c), SCACR (&quot;The\r\n  appellate court may affirm any ruling, order, decision or judgment upon any\r\n  ground(s) appearing the Record on Appeal.&quot;).\r\nII. CATTERSON'S\r\n  PERSONAL LIABILITY\r\nJade Street appeals the circuit court's conclusion that Catterson\r\n  himself is not personally liable for the actions of Catterson &amp; Sons.  We\r\n  affirm pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 33-6-220(b) (&quot;[A] shareholder of a\r\n  corporation is not personally liable for the acts or debts of the corporation\r\n  except that he may become personally liable  by reason of his acts or\r\n  conduct.&quot;); Aaron v. Mahl, 381 S.C. 585, 591, 674 S.E.2d 482, 485 (2009)\r\n  (&quot;In an action at law, tried by a judge without a jury, the findings of\r\n  the trial court must be affirmed if there is any evidence to support\r\n  them.&quot;).\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor\r\n  the foregoing reasons, we affirm as modified the circuit court's holding that\r\n  Aten is personally liable for his negligence.  We also affirm the court's\r\n  finding that Catterson is not personally liable for the acts of Catterson &amp;\r\n  Sons.\r\nPLEICONES\r\n  and KITTREDGE, JJ., concur. BEATTY, J., concurring in part and dissenting in\r\n  part in a separate opinion in which TOAL, C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE\r\n  BEATTY:  I concur in part.  I concur\r\n  in that part of the majority's opinion that affirms the circuit court's\r\n  conclusion that Catterson is not personally liable for the actions of Catterson\r\n  &amp; Sons.  However, I am compelled to dissent in that part of the majority's\r\n  opinion that concludes that Aten is personally liable for torts committed in\r\n  furtherance of the business of 16 Jade Street, LLC.\r\nThe\r\n  conclusion reached by the majority, though appealing, cannot be reached by use\r\n  of statutory construction.  As the majority recognizes, it is axiomatic that\r\n  the cornerstone of statutory construction is the ascertainment of the\r\n  Legislature's intent.  It is also axiomatic that where the words of the statute\r\n  are clear and unambiguous, the court cannot assign them a new and different\r\n  meaning.  Section 33-44-303 states:\r\n\r\n  (a) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (c), the debts,\r\n    obligations, and liabilities of a limited liability company, whether arising in\r\n    contract, tort, or otherwise, are solely the debts, obligations, and liabilities\r\n    of the company.  A member or manager is not personally liable for a debt,\r\n    obligation, or liability of the company solely by reason of being or acting\r\n      as a member or manager.\r\n  (b) The failure of a limited liability\r\n    company to observe the usual company formalities or requirements relating to\r\n    the exercise of its company powers or management of its business is not a\r\n    ground for imposing personal liability on the members or managers for\r\n    liabilities of the company.\r\n  (c) All or specified members of a limited\r\n    liability company are liable in their capacity as members for all or specified\r\n    debts, obligations, or liabilities of the company if:\r\n  \r\n    (1) a provision to that effect is\r\n      contained in the articles of organization; and \r\n    (2) a member so liable has consented in\r\n      writing to the adoption of the provision or to be bound by the provision.\r\n  \r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-303 (2006) (emphasis added).\r\nThis statute is\r\n  clear and unambiguous and, in my view, is not amenable to an interpretation\r\n  that a member tortfeasor of an LLC is personally liable for torts committed in\r\n  the furtherance of the LLC's business.  Although we may find fault in the\r\n  wisdom of the statute, we have no authority to re-write it.  See State\r\n    v. Jacobs, 393 S.C. 584, 713 S.E.2d 621 (2011) (recognizing that where a\r\n  statute's language is plain and unambiguous, and conveys a clear and definite\r\n  meaning, the rules of statutory interpretation are not needed and the court has\r\n  no right to impose another meaning).\r\nSection 33-44-303\r\n  is clear and unambiguous; the common law must yield.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] AAC block stands for aerated autoclave concrete block.  These blocks are\r\n  preformed concrete blocks with cavities that, when stacked, permit rebar and\r\n  grouting mortar to be poured in and provide structural support. \r\n[2] The negligence claim against Aten and R. Design was an ordinary construction\r\n  defect claim coupled with negligent supervision.\r\n[3] R. Design brought cross-claims against Catterson and\r\n  Catterson &amp; Sons for equitable indemnity and breach of contract.  Aten\r\n  also filed a third-party complaint against Kintz Electric, an electrical\r\n  subcontractor.  Issues relating to these claims are not raised on appeal. \r\n[4] Prior to the adoption of the Uniform Limited Liability Act in 1996, South\r\n  Carolina had a statutory scheme governing LLCs which specifically preserved the\r\n  personal liability of individual members who committed tortious conduct\r\n  pursuant to a professional licensing statute. See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  33-43-304(B) (repealed 1996).  \r\n[5] Some courts which have found personal liability have done so based on substantially\r\n  different language in their LLC statutes.  For example, in Estate of\r\n    Countryman v. Farmers Cooperative Ass'n, 679 N.W.2d 598 (Iowa 2004), the\r\n  Supreme Court of Iowa held a member was personally liable for his torts. Id. at 605.  However, Iowa's LLC statute at the time specifically stated,\r\n  &quot;Nothing in this section shall be construed to affect the liability of a\r\n  member of a limited liability company to third parties for the member's\r\n  participation in tortious conduct.&quot; Iowa Code § 490A.603(3) (2004)\r\n  (repealed 2009).\r\n[6] Some of the courts espousing the majority rule with statutes similar to ours\r\n  focus on this use of the word &quot;solely&quot; in the statute. See, e.g.,\r\n    Allen, 991 A.2d at 1229 (citing Md. Code Ann., Corps. &amp; Ann'ns §\r\n  4A-301).  Their logic is that finding a member liable for a tort he commits\r\n  while working for the company is imposing liability because he was the actual\r\n  tortfeasor, not solely because he is a member. Id.  Were this all\r\n  the statute provided, we would be inclined to agree.  However, as discussed\r\n  below, the statute also makes the company (and not any member) exclusively\r\n  liable for certain tort obligations.  Thus, the statute on its face appears to\r\n  limit a member's personal liability for torts he commits.\r\n[7] Subsection (c) provides further support for the\r\n  notion that section 33-44-303's liability shield is more than just a protection\r\n  against vicarious liability.  In particular, it states a member obligates\r\n  himself to pay for such LLC debts when there is a provision so providing in the\r\n  articles of organization and the member expressly has agreed to be bound by it.\r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-303(c).  Because the statute expressly provides how a\r\n  member can become personally liable, it therefore stands to reason that the\r\n  general rule is he is not otherwise personally liable. See also Hodges,\r\n  341 S.C. at 86, 533 S.E.2d at 582 (&quot;The canon of construction 'expressio\r\n    unius est exclusio alterius' or 'inclusio unius est exclusio alterius'\r\n  holds that 'to express or include one thing implies the exclusion of another,\r\n  or of the alternative.'&quot; (quoting Black's Law Dictionary 602 (7th ed.\r\n  1999)). \r\n[8] The comments provide, &quot;A member or manager, as an agent of the company, is\r\n  not liable for the debts, obligations, and liabilities of the company simply\r\n  because of the agency.  A member or manager is responsible for acts or\r\n  omissions to the extent those acts or omissions would be actionable in . . .\r\n  tort against the member or manager if that person were acting in an individual\r\n  capacity.&quot; S.C. Code Ann. § 33-44-303 cmt.  We believe this is evidence of\r\n  the General Assembly's intent that he should be liable for his torts.\r\n[9] These comments similarly note that nothing in the current version of the\r\n  provision under scrutiny in this case was intended to ameliorate the common law\r\n  principle that a tortfeasor is always responsible for his own tortious conduct.\r\n  Revised Unif. Lim. Liab. Co. Act § 304 cmt. (&quot;This paragraph shields\r\n  members and managers only against the debts, obligations and liabilities of the\r\n  limited liability company and is irrelevant to claims seeking to hold a member\r\n  or manager directly liable on account of the member's or manager's own\r\n  conduct.&quot;).  Importantly, this provision is nearly identical to section 33-44-303;\r\n  the only substantive difference is that there is no equivalent to subsection\r\n  (c).\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27108","title":"State v.

Green appeals his convictions for criminal solicitation of a minor[1] and attempted criminal sexual conduct (&quot;CSC&quot;) with a minor in the\r\n  second-degree.[2] \r\n  In challenging his convictions, Green contends the trial judge erred in:  (1) denying his motion to dismiss the charge of criminal\r\n  solicitation of a minor on the ground the statute is unconstitutionally\r\n  overbroad and vague; (2) denying his motions to dismiss and for a directed\r\n  verdict on the charge of attempted CSC with a minor in the second-degree; (3)\r\n  admitting certain photographs; and (4) denying his request for a jury charge on\r\n  attempted assault and battery of a high and aggravated nature\r\n(&quot;ABHAN&quot;).  We affirm.\r\nI.&nbsp;Factual/Procedural History\r\nOn October 13, 2006 at 5:38 p.m., Green entered a\r\n  Yahoo! online chat room under the screen name &quot;blak slyder&quot; and initiated\r\n  an online chat with &quot;lilmandy14sc&quot; (&quot;Mandy&quot;).  On Mandy's\r\n  profile page was a picture of a female sitting on a bed.  Unbeknownst to Green,\r\n  Mandy was actually an online persona created by Investigator Tommy Platt of the\r\n  Aiken County Sheriff's Office as part of the Internet Crimes Against Children\r\n  Task Force.  \r\nIn response to Green's initial question, Mandy\r\n  answered &quot;i hooked up with a 16 year old.&quot;  Green then asked Mandy,\r\n  &quot;how young are you?&quot;  to which Mandy stated, &quot;14.&quot;  Green\r\n  countered that he was &quot;21.&quot;[3] \r\n  Immediately thereafter, the chat turned sexual in nature with Green asking\r\n  Mandy whether she would have sex with him.  During the chat, Green sent Mandy\r\n  two pictures of his penis and stated that he could &quot;show it to [her] in\r\n  person.&quot;[4] \r\n    Green then arranged to meet Mandy at 7:30 p.m. on a secluded road in Beech\r\n  Island, South Carolina, which is located in Aiken County.  \r\nWhen Green arrived at the predetermined location, he\r\n  was met by several law enforcement officers who arrested him.  In response to\r\n  the officers' questions, Green admitted that &quot;he was there to meet a\r\n  14-year-old girl.&quot;  A search of Green's vehicle revealed a cell phone, a bottle\r\n  of alcohol, two DVDs, condoms, male enhancement cream and drugs, and\r\n  handwritten directions to the location.  \r\nSubsequently, Green was indicted and ultimately\r\n  convicted by a jury for criminal solicitation of a minor and attempted CSC with\r\n  a minor in the second-degree.  Green appealed his convictions to the Court of\r\n  Appeals.  This Court certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to\r\n  Rule 204(b) of the South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\nII. Discussion\r\nA. Constitutionality of Criminal\r\n  Solicitation of a Minor Statute\r\nIn a pre-trial hearing and at the conclusion of the State's case,\r\n  Green moved for the trial judge to declare unconstitutional section 16-15-342, the criminal solicitation of a minor\r\n  statute, on the grounds it is overbroad and vague.  Specifically, he claimed\r\n  the statute is not narrowly tailored and, as a result, &quot;chills free\r\n  speech.&quot;  The judge summarily denied the motion.\r\nOn appeal, Green challenges section 16-15-342 as facially\r\n  overbroad because one can be found guilty under the statute &quot;when he\r\n  contacts a minor for any one of six activities under 16-15-375(5) or any one of\r\n  at least twenty-nine activities under 16-1-60.&quot;  Because the statute does\r\n  not identify what forms of communication are prohibited, Green claims the\r\n  content of any communication would &quot;trigger a violation of the\r\n  statute.&quot;  Ultimately, Green claims the statute is &quot;so overbroad that\r\n  it ensnares&quot; protected speech.  \r\nIn a related argument, Green asserts this lack of specificity\r\n  demonstrates that the statute is vague.  Green contends the provisions of the\r\n  statute are vague as to &quot;what forms of communications and what content of\r\n  such communications would be criminalized as solicitations.&quot;  Because the\r\n  statute is not sufficiently definite, Green avers that &quot;[a] person of\r\n  ordinary intelligence would not know what speech, expression or contact would\r\n  result in a violation of the statute.&quot; \r\n&quot;When the issue is the constitutionality of a statute, every\r\n  presumption will be made in favor of its validity and no statute will be\r\n  declared unconstitutional unless its invalidity appears so clearly as to leave\r\n  no doubt that it conflicts with the constitution.&quot;  State v. Gaster,\r\n  349 S.C. 545, 549-50, 564 S.E.2d 87, 89-90 (2002).  &quot;This presumption\r\n  places the initial burden on the party challenging the constitutionality of the\r\n  legislation to show it violates a provision of the Constitution.&quot;  State\r\n    v. White, 348 S.C. 532, 536-37, 560 S.E.2d 420, 422 (2002).\r\nApplying these well-established rules regarding the constitutionality\r\n  of a statute, our analysis begins with a review of the text of the challenged\r\n  statute.  Section 16-15-342 provides in pertinent part:\r\n\r\n  (A) A person eighteen years of age or older commits the offense of\r\n    criminal solicitation of a minor if he knowingly contacts or communicates with,\r\n    or attempts to contact or communicate with, a person who is under the age of\r\n    eighteen, or a person reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen, for\r\n    the purpose of or with the intent of persuading, inducing, enticing, or\r\n    coercing the person to engage or participate in a sexual activity as defined in\r\n    Section 16-15-375(5) or a violent crime as defined in Section 16-1-60, or with\r\n    the intent to perform a sexual activity in the presence of the person under the\r\n    age of eighteen, or person reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen.\r\n  (B) Consent is a defense to a prosecution\r\n    pursuant to this section if the person under the age of eighteen, or the person\r\n    reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen, is at least sixteen years\r\n    old.\r\n  (C) Consent is not a defense to a\r\n    prosecution pursuant to this section if the person under the age of eighteen,\r\n    or the person reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen, is under the\r\n    age of sixteen.\r\n  (D) It is not a defense to a prosecution\r\n    pursuant to this section, on the basis of consent or otherwise, that the person\r\n    reasonably believed to be under the age of eighteen is a law enforcement agent\r\n    or officer acting in an official capacity.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  16-15-342 (Supp. 2011).  Section 16-15-375 defines &quot;sexual activity&quot;\r\n  by identifying six acts, which include &quot;vaginal, anal, or oral intercourse&quot; and\r\n  &quot;touching, in an act of apparent sexual stimulation or sexual\r\n  abuse.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-375(5) (2003).\r\n1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Overbroad[5]\r\n&quot;It has long been recognized that the First Amendment needs\r\n  breathing space and that statutes attempting to restrict or burden the exercise\r\n  of First Amendment rights must be narrowly drawn and represent a considered\r\n  legislative judgment that a particular mode of expression has\r\n  to give way to other compelling needs of society.&quot;  Broadrick v.\r\n    Oklahoma, 413 U.S. 601, 611-12 (1973).  \r\nIn\r\n  discussing the overbreadth doctrine, the United States Supreme Court (&quot;USSC&quot;)\r\n  has stated:  \r\n\r\n  According to our First Amendment overbreadth doctrine,\r\n    a statute is facially invalid if it prohibits a substantial amount of protected\r\n    speech.  The doctrine seeks to strike a balance between competing social costs.\r\n    On the one hand, the threat of enforcement of an overbroad law deters people\r\n    from engaging in constitutionally protected speech, inhibiting the free\r\n    exchange of ideas.  On the other hand, invalidating a law that in some of its\r\n    applications is perfectly constitutional—particularly a law directed at conduct\r\n    so antisocial that it has been made criminal—has obvious harmful effects.  In\r\n    order to maintain an appropriate balance, we have vigorously enforced the\r\n    requirement that a statute's overbreadth be substantial, not only in an\r\n    absolute sense, but also relative to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep. \r\n    Invalidation for overbreadth is strong medicine that is not to be casually\r\n    employed.\r\n\r\nUnited States v. Williams, 553 U.S. 285, 292-93 (2008) (citations omitted)\r\n  (emphasis in original).  &quot;To put the matter another way, particularly where conduct and not merely speech is involved, we believe\r\n  that the overbreadth of a statute must not only be real, but substantial as\r\n  well, judged in relation to the statute's plainly legitimate sweep.&quot;  Broadrick,\r\n  413 U.S. at 615.\r\nIn\r\n  analyzing Green's constitutional challenge to section 16-15-342, we initially\r\n  note that speech used to further the sexual exploitation of children has been\r\n  routinely denied constitutional protection as the State has a compelling\r\n  interest in preventing the sexual abuse of children.  In fact, the USSC has expressly\r\n  stated that &quot;[o]ffers to engage in illegal transactions are categorically\r\n  excluded from First Amendment protection.&quot;  Williams, 553 U.S. at 297. \r\n  Moreover, &quot;[c]ourts have recognized that speech used to further the sexual\r\n  exploitation of children does not enjoy constitutional protection, and while a\r\n  statute may incidentally burden some protected expression in carrying out its\r\n  objective, it will not be held to violate the First Amendment if it serves the\r\n  compelling interest of preventing the sexual abuse of children and is no\r\n  broader than necessary to achieve that purpose.&quot;  Cashatt v. State,\r\n  873 So. 2d 430, 434-35 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2004); see New York v.\r\n    Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, 756-57 (1982) (recognizing that the prevention of\r\n  sexual exploitation of children and abuse of children constitutes a government\r\n  objective of surpassing importance).  \r\nIn view of this\r\n  compelling interest, the question becomes whether section 16-15-342 is narrowly\r\n  tailored to achieve the interest for which it was intended.  As will be\r\n  discussed, we find the statute is narrowly drafted to prohibit criminal conduct\r\n  rather than protected speech.\r\nSignificantly, the\r\n  statute includes the term &quot;knowingly.&quot;  Thus, it affects only those individuals\r\n  who intentionally target minors for the purpose of engaging or participating in\r\n  sexual activity or a violent crime.  Conversely, it does not criminalize any\r\n  inadvertent contact or communications with minors.  See United State\r\n    v. Bailey, 228 F.3d 637, 639 (6th Cir. 2000) (concluding that statute\r\n  proscribing knowing efforts to persuade minors to engage in illegal sexual\r\n  activity did not violate First Amendment); State v. Ebert, 263 P.3d 918,\r\n  922 (N.M. Ct. App. 2011) (concluding that statute criminalizing child\r\n  solicitation by electronic communication device was not constitutionally\r\n  overbroad as &quot;[t]ailoring [was] primarily accomplished through the\r\n  'knowingly' scienter requirement&quot;; noting that &quot;the statute does not\r\n  restrict adults from communicating about sex to children, nor does it restrict\r\n  adults from soliciting sex from one another over the internet,&quot; in fact,\r\n  &quot;the statute prohibits only that conduct necessary to achieve the State's\r\n  interest&quot;); State v. Snyder, 801 N.E.2d 876, 883 (Ohio Ct. App.\r\n  2003) (finding statute that prohibited adults from using telecommunications\r\n  device to solicit minor for sexual activity is not &quot;aimed at the\r\n  expression of ideas or beliefs; rather, it is aimed at prohibiting adults from\r\n  taking advantage of minors and the anonymity and ease of communicating through\r\n  telecommunications devices, especially the Internet and instant messaging\r\n  devices, by soliciting minors to engage in sexual activity&quot;).  \r\nBecause\r\n  the statute does not criminalize protected speech and is narrowly tailored to\r\n  achieve a compelling state interest, we find the statute is not\r\n  unconstitutionally overbroad as any alleged overbreadth is unsubstantial when\r\n  considered in relation to &quot;its plainly legitimate sweep.&quot;        \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vague\r\nIn\r\n  view of our finding, the analysis turns to a determination of whether the\r\n  statute is void for vagueness.\r\n&quot;The concept of vagueness or indefiniteness rests on the\r\n  constitutional principle that procedural due process requires fair notice and\r\n  proper standards for adjudication.&quot;  City of Beaufort v. Baker, 315\r\n  S.C. 146, 152, 432 S.E.2d 470, 473 (1993) (quoting State v. Albert, 257\r\n  S.C. 131, 134, 184 S.E.2d 605, 606 (1971)).  &quot;The constitutional standard\r\n  for vagueness is the practical criterion of fair notice to those to whom the\r\n  law applies.&quot;  Huber v.\r\n    S.C. State Bd. of Physical Therapy Exam'rs, 316 S.C. 24, 26, 446 S.E.2d 433,\r\n  435 (1994).   A law is unconstitutionally vague if it forbids or requires the\r\n  doing of an act in terms so vague that a person of common intelligence must\r\n  necessarily guess as to its meaning and differ as to its application.  Toussaint\r\n    v. State Bd. of Med. Exam'rs, 303 S.C. 316, 400 S.E.2d 488 (1991).  &quot;[O]ne\r\n  to whose conduct the law clearly applies does not have standing to challenge it\r\n  for vagueness as applied to the conduct of others.&quot;  In re Amir X.S.,\r\n  371 S.C. 380, 391, 639 S.E.2d 144, 150 (2006) (citing Village of Hoffman\r\n    Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 495 (1982)).\r\nAs\r\n  an initial matter, we find that Green does not have standing to assert a facial\r\n  challenge for vagueness as the statute provided adequate notice that his\r\n  conduct fell within that proscribed by section 16-15-342.   Green, who was\r\n  twenty-seven years old at the time of the offense, knowingly initiated an online\r\n  chat with a female he reasonably believed to be fourteen years old.  As\r\n  evidenced by the text of the chat, Mandy represented her age to be 14, Green\r\n  acknowledged that she was too young to drive his vehicle, and admitted to the\r\n  arresting officers that he was there to meet a fourteen-year-old girl. \r\n  Moreover, Green's sexually-explicit conversation was intended for no other\r\n  purpose than to persuade Mandy to engage in sexual activity as defined in\r\n  section 16-15-675(5). \r\nEven\r\n  assuming standing, we find that Green's challenge is without merit.  We hold\r\n  that section 16-15-342 is sufficiently precise to provide fair notice to those to\r\n  whom the statute applies. The criminal solicitation statute specifically\r\n  identifies the following distinct elements: &quot;(1)\r\n  the defendant is eighteen years of age or older; (2) he or she knowingly\r\n  contacts or communicates with, or attempts to contact or communicate with; (3)\r\n  a person who is under the age of eighteen, or a person reasonably believed to\r\n  be under the age of eighteen; (4) for the purpose of or with the intent of\r\n  persuading, inducing, enticing, or coercing the person to engage or participate\r\n  in a sexual activity as defined in Section 16-15-375(5) or a violent crime as\r\n  defined in Section 16-1-60; or (5) with the intent to perform a sexual activity\r\n  in the presence of the person under the age of eighteen, or person reasonably\r\n  believed to be under the age of eighteen.&quot;  State v. Reid, 383 S.C.\r\n  285, 301, 679 S.E.2d 194, 202 (Ct. App. 2009), aff'd, 393 S.C.\r\n  325, 713 S.E.2d 274 (2011).  \r\nAlthough\r\n  each of these terms is not defined, we believe a person of common intelligence\r\n  would not have to guess at what conduct is prohibited by the statute.  We also\r\n  find the Legislature purposefully did not define &quot;contacts&quot; or\r\n  &quot;communicates,&quot; as we believe it sought to encompass all methods of\r\n  communications.  Unlike the solicitation statutes found in other jurisdictions,\r\n  the South Carolina statute does not confine the method of solicitation strictly\r\n  to computers.[6] \r\n  Instead, one charged with this crime could have used a letter, a telephone, a\r\n  computer, or other electronic means to communicate with or contact the minor\r\n  victim.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude that Green has not satisfied his burden to prove\r\n  that section 16-15-342 violates the First Amendment of the Constitution.\r\nWe\r\n  note that other jurisdictions, which have analyzed statutes similar to this state's,\r\n  have also determined that the statutes are neither unconstitutionally overbroad\r\n  nor vague.  See, e.g., Cashatt v. State, 873 So. 2d 430 (Fla. Dist.\r\n  Ct. App. 2004); People v. Smith, 806 N.E.2d 1262 (Ill. App. Ct. 2004); LaRose\r\n    v. State, 820 N.E.2d 727 (Ind. Ct. App. 2005); State v. Penton, 998\r\n  So. 2d 184 (La. Ct. App. 2008); State v. Pribble, 285 S.W.3d 310 (Mo.\r\n  2009) (en banc); State v. Rung, 774 N.W.2d 621 (Neb.\r\n  2009); State v. Snyder, 801 N.E.2d 876 (Ohio Ct. App. 2003); Maloney\r\n    v. State, 294 S.W.3d 613 (Tex. Ct. App. 2009); State v. Gallegos,\r\n  220 P.3d 136 (Utah 2009).  See generally Marjorie A. Shields and Jill M.\r\n  Marks, Annotation, Validity, Construction, and Application of State Statutes\r\n    Prohibiting Child Luring as Applied to Cases Involving Luring of Child by Means\r\n    of Electronic Communications, 33 A.L.R. 6th 373, §§ 4-10 (2008 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2012) (analyzing state cases that have determined state child-luring statute\r\n  was constitutionally valid).\r\nHaving\r\n  rejected Green's constitutional challenges, the question becomes whether the\r\n  trial judge erred in declining to grant Green's motions to dismiss or for a\r\n  directed verdict as to the charged offenses.\r\nB.&nbsp;Motions to Dismiss and for\r\n  a Directed Verdict \r\nPrior\r\n  to trial, Green moved to dismiss the charged offenses.  In support of this\r\n  motion and his directed verdict motion, Green claimed it was legally impossible\r\n  to &quot;carry out the criminal sexual conduct&quot; because the alleged victim\r\n  was not a minor but, rather, a fictitious person created by Investigator Platt.\r\n   During trial, Green also established that the picture on Mandy's profile page was\r\n  actually that of Lynda Williamson, a twenty-four-year-old former probation\r\n  officer who provided the photograph to an investigator with the Aiken County\r\n  Sheriff's Office.  Because the woman in the picture was &quot;over the age of\r\n  consent,&quot; Green claimed he could not be convicted of attempted CSC with\r\n  minor in the second-degree.\r\nAs an\r\n  additional ground, Green asserted the State failed to prove his specific intent\r\n  to commit CSC with a minor in the second-degree and an overt act in furtherance\r\n  of the crime.  During his argument, Green pointed to the text of the online\r\n  chat where he stated that he would not pressure Mandy to do anything that she\r\n  did not want to do and that she could change her mind about having sex.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Green reiterates these arguments in support of his contention that the\r\n  trial judge erred in denying his motions to dismiss and for a directed verdict. \r\n  In addition, Green elaborates on his claim of legal impossibility.  Citing United\r\n    States v. Frazier, 560 F.2d 884 (8th Cir. 1977), Green explains that this\r\n  defense applies &quot;where the impossibility of a defendant's successfully\r\n  committing a crime eliminates the culpability of his having tried to do\r\n  so.&quot;  According to this statement, Green claims he should not have been\r\n  convicted of the charged offenses as he &quot;could not commit criminal sexual\r\n  conduct with a fictitious person.&quot;\r\n1. Legal Impossibility\r\n&quot;[L]egal impossibility occurs when the actions that the\r\n  defendant performs or sets in motion, even if fully carried out as he or she desires,\r\n  would not constitute a crime, whereas factual impossibility occurs when the\r\n  objective of the defendant is proscribed by the criminal law but a circumstance\r\n  unknown to the actor prevents him or her from bringing about that objective.&quot;  21 Am. Jur. 2d Criminal\r\n    Law § 156 (2008).  &quot;According to some authorities, legal impossibility\r\n  is a defense to a charge of attempt, but factual impossibility is not.&quot;  Id. \r\n  In view of this distinction and Green's arguments, we have confined our\r\n  analysis of this issue to the defense of legal impossibility.\r\nAs we\r\n  interpret Green's trial and appellate arguments, his claim of legal\r\n  impossibility encompasses both the solicitation charge and the CSC charge. \r\n  Specifically, the intent element in the solicitation statute and the necessary\r\n  intent for the attempted CSC charge warrant a similar analysis with respect to\r\n  Green's challenge that no actual minor was involved.  Accordingly, we address\r\n  Green's claims as to both charges.\r\nSection\r\n  16-15-342(D) definitively discounts Green's arguments with respect to the\r\n  solicitation charge as this provision states, &quot;It\r\n  is not a defense to a prosecution pursuant to this section, on the basis of\r\n  consent or otherwise, that the person reasonably believed to be under the age\r\n  of eighteen is a law enforcement agent or officer acting in an official\r\n  capacity.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-15-342(D) (Supp. 2011).  Thus, based on\r\n  the plain language of the statute, the Legislature clearly intended to\r\n  eliminate the defense of impossibility as to the charge of criminal\r\n  solicitation of a minor if a law enforcement officer impersonated the minor.  State\r\n    v. Dingle, 376 S.C. 643, 659 S.E.2d 101 (2008) (recognizing that in\r\n  interpreting statutes, appellate courts look to the plain meaning of the\r\n  statute and the intent of the Legislature).\r\nSimilarly, the fact that an actual minor was not the subject of\r\n  Green's intent did not preclude his prosecution and conviction for attempted\r\n  CSC with a minor in the second-degree.  \r\nA person is guilty of CSC with a minor in the second-degree if &quot;the\r\n  actor engages in sexual battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or\r\n  less but who is at least eleven years of age.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-655(B)(1)\r\n  (Supp. 2011).  &quot;A person who commits the common law offense of attempt, upon\r\n  conviction, must be punished as for the principal offense.&quot;  S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 16-1-80 (2003).  &quot;Thus, the elements of attempted CSC with a minor\r\n  in the second degree are:  (1) an attempt; (2) to engage in a sexual battery;\r\n  (3) with a victim; (4) who is fourteen years of age or less; (5) but who is at\r\n  least eleven years of age.&quot;  Reid, 383 S.C. at 292, 679 S.E.2d at\r\n  197.\r\nIn\r\n  discussing attempt crimes, this Court has stated, &quot;In the context of an 'attempt' crime, specific intent means that the\r\n  defendant consciously intended the completion of acts comprising the choate\r\n  offense.&quot;  State v. Sutton, 340 S.C. 393, 397, 532 S.E.2d 283, 285\r\n  (2000).  Accordingly, &quot;[t]o prove attempt, the State must prove\r\n  that the defendant had the specific intent to commit the underlying\r\n  offense, along with some overt act, beyond mere preparation in\r\n  furtherance of the intent.&quot;  State v. Reid, 393 S.C. 325, 329, 713\r\n  S.E.2d 274, 276 (2011) (emphasis in the original).\r\nBased on the above-outlined definitions, we find Green's actions\r\n  were sufficient to prove the offense of attempted CSC with a minor in the\r\n  second-degree.  As noted, an attempt crime does not require the completion of\r\n  the object offense.  Thus, Green was not required to complete the sexual\r\n  battery in order to be prosecuted and convicted of the offense.  Accordingly, the\r\n  fact that the intended victim was not an actual minor was irrelevant as the\r\n  State was only required to prove Green had the specific intent to commit a\r\n  sexual battery on a victim between the ages of eleven and fourteen years\r\n  old coupled with some overt act toward the commission of the offense.  See State v. Curtiss, 65 P.3d 207 (Idaho Ct. App. 2002) (holding that\r\n  impossibility did not constitute a defense to charge of attempted lewd conduct with\r\n  a minor under the age of sixteen in a case where detective posed as a\r\n  fourteen-year-old girl in online chat room); Hix v. Commonwealth, 619\r\n  S.E.2d 80 (Va. 2005) (holding that the fact defendant was communicating with an\r\n  adult law enforcement officer posing as a child was not a defense to the charge\r\n  of attempted indecent liberties with a minor).\r\nA decision to this effect is consistent with our state's limited\r\n  jurisprudence regarding Internet sex crimes.  See Reid, 383 S.C.\r\n  at 300, 679 S.E.2d at 201-02 (recognizing &quot;the policy goal of stopping\r\n  dangerous persons through earlier intervention by law enforcement by punishing the\r\n  attempted conduct as a crime, especially in any cybermolester type cases where\r\n  the conduct also clearly manifests or strongly corroborates the intent to\r\n  commit such a dangerous object crime&quot;).  \r\nFinally, other state jurisdictions have concluded that a defendant\r\n  may be prosecuted for criminal solicitation of a minor, as well as attempted sexual\r\n  offenses, where the online persona is an undercover officer and not an actual\r\n  minor.  See, e.g., Karwoski v. State, 867 So. 2d 486 (Fla. Dist.\r\n  Ct. App. 2004); People v. Thousand, 631 N.W.2d 694 (Mich. 2001); State\r\n    v. Coonrod, 652 N.W.2d 715 (Minn. Ct. App. 2002); Shaffer v. State,\r\n  72 So. 3d 1070 (Miss. 2011); Johnson v . State, 159 P.3d 1096 (Nev.\r\n  2007); State v. Robins, 646 N.W.2d 287 (Wis. 2002).[7]\r\nC.&nbsp;Sufficiency of the Evidence\r\n  As to Specific Intent and Overt Act in Furtherance of Attempted CSC with a\r\n  Minor\r\nFinding\r\n  that an actual minor was not required for the prosecution of the charge of\r\n  attempted CSC with a minor, the question becomes whether the State proved that\r\n  Green possessed the requisite intent and that he engaged in some overt act in\r\n  furtherance of the charge.\r\nViewing the evidence in the light most favorable to the State, we conclude the trial judge properly denied Green's\r\n  motion for a directed verdict as to the charge of attempted CSC with a minor in\r\n  the second-degree.  Green clearly expressed his specific intent to have a\r\n  sexual encounter with Mandy, a fourteen-year-old female.  A review of the\r\n  online chat reveals that Green was not dissuaded by the fact that Mandy stated\r\n  she was fourteen years old.  Instead, Green continued the sexually explicit\r\n  conversation and sent Mandy pictures of his genitals.\r\nIn\r\n  furtherance of his specific intent, Green committed an overt act in\r\n  orchestrating a meeting for the sexual encounter.  Green asked Mandy whether\r\n  her parents would let her out after dark and whether he could meet her at her\r\n  home.  Ultimately, Green arranged to meet Mandy on a secluded street that night\r\n  at a specific time.  Green then traveled to the predetermined location where he\r\n  was arrested and found to be in possession of alcohol, condoms, and male\r\n  enhancement products.  Accordingly, the trial judge properly submitted the\r\n  charge to the jury.  See  State v. Reid, 393 S.C. 325, 713 S.E.2d\r\n  274 (2011) (finding attempted second-degree CSC with a minor charge was\r\n  properly submitted to the jury where appellant, who through a chat with an\r\n  online persona created by a law enforcement officer, clearly communicated his\r\n  desire to have a sexual encounter with a fourteen-year-old girl, arranged to\r\n  meet the fictitious minor at a designated place and time, and travelled to that\r\n  location); State v. Weston, 367 S.C. 279, 292, 625 S.E.2d 641, 648 (2006)\r\n  (recognizing that if there is any direct evidence or any substantial\r\n  circumstantial evidence reasonably tending to prove the guilt of the accused,\r\n  the appellate court must find the case was properly submitted to the jury). \r\nD. Admission of Photographs \r\nIn a\r\n  pre-trial hearing and during the trial, Green objected to the admission of the two\r\n  photographs of his penis.  Green contended the photographs were more\r\n  prejudicial than probative and, thus, should be excluded.  In response, the\r\n  Solicitor offered the photographs &quot;to show the furtherance of the conduct\r\n  to solicit sex from the underage child as a form of grooming, as a form of\r\n  soliciting sex.&quot;  The trial judge rejected Green's motion, finding the\r\n  photographs were &quot;highly relevant&quot; and that &quot;any prejudicial\r\n  effect&quot; was outweighed.  \r\nOn\r\n  appeal, Green contends the trial judge erred in allowing the jury to view these\r\n  photographs as &quot;the prejudicial value of a visual of [his] computer screen\r\n  name of [&quot;blak slyder&quot;] through pictures of the same far outweighed\r\n  its probative value.&quot;  Although Green concedes the &quot;sexual\r\n  conversation&quot; in the chat room was relevant, he contends the photographs\r\n  should have been excluded as they were &quot;inflammatory to both male and\r\n  female&quot; jurors.  He characterizes the admission of these photographs as an\r\n  &quot;exceptional circumstance&quot; that warrants reversal of his convictions\r\n  as he was deprived of his constitutional right to a fair trial. \r\n&quot;All relevant evidence is admissible, except as otherwise\r\n  provided by the Constitution of the United States, the Constitution of the\r\n  State of South Carolina, statutes, [the South Carolina Rules of Evidence], or\r\n  by other rules promulgated by the Supreme Court of South Carolina.&quot;  Rule\r\n  402, SCRE. Evidence is\r\n  relevant if it has &quot;any tendency to make the existence of any fact that is\r\n  of consequence to the determination\r\n  of the action more probable or less probable than it would be without the\r\n  evidence.&quot;  Rule 401, SCRE.  &quot;Although relevant,\r\n  evidence may be excluded if its probative value is substantially outweighed by\r\n  the danger of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, or misleading the\r\n  jury, or by considerations of undue delay, waste of time, or needless\r\n  presentation of cumulative evidence.&quot;  Rule 403, SCRE.\r\nThe relevancy, materiality, and admissibility of photographs as\r\n  evidence are matters left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  State\r\n    v. Kornahrens, 290 S.C. 281, 350 S.E.2d 180 (1986).   If the offered\r\n  photograph serves to corroborate testimony, it is not an abuse of discretion to\r\n  admit it.  State v. Todd, 290 S.C. 212, 349 S.E.2d 339 (1986).  To\r\n  warrant reversal based on the wrongful admission of evidence, the complaining party must prove resulting prejudice.  Vaught\r\n    v. A.O. Hardee &amp; Sons, Inc., 366 S.C. 475, 480, 623 S.E.2d 373, 375\r\n  (2005).  Prejudice occurs when there is reasonable probability the wrongly\r\n  admitted evidence influenced the jury's verdict.  Id.\r\nWe find the trial judge did not abuse his discretion in admitting\r\n  the photographs. Although clearly offensive, the photographs corroborated\r\n  Investigator Platt's testimony and served to establish Green's intent to\r\n  solicit the minor to engage in sexual activity.  Furthermore, the photographs\r\n  negated Green's claim that he did not intend to have sex with a minor.  After\r\n  sending the photographs, Green commented that &quot;I can show it to you in\r\n  person.&quot;    This comment in conjunction with the photographs provided the\r\n  jury with evidence of Green's specific intent as to the charged crimes.  Accordingly,\r\n  we agree with the trial judge that the photographs were relevant and that their\r\n  probative value outweighed any prejudicial impact.  See State v. Martucci,\r\n  380 S.C. 232, 249, 669 S.E.2d 598, 607 (Ct. App. 2008) (finding no abuse of\r\n  discretion where trial judge admitted photographs that were relevant and\r\n  necessary and were not introduced with the intent to inflame, elicit the sympathy\r\n  of, or prejudice the jury; recognizing that a trial judge is not required to\r\n  exclude evidence because it is unpleasant or offensive).\r\n          Moreover,\r\n  even if the judge erred in admitting the photographs, we find any error to be\r\n  harmless given that the text of the online chats, the testimony of the\r\n  investigating officers, and the evidence found in Green's car conclusively\r\n  established the elements of the crimes for which Green was charged.  See State v. Bailey, 298 S.C. 1, 5, 377 S.E.2d 581, 584 (1989) (recognizing\r\n  that an insubstantial error not affecting the result of the trial is harmless\r\n  where &quot;guilt has been conclusively proven by competent evidence such that\r\n  no other rational conclusion can be reached&quot;); State v. Knight, 258\r\n  S.C. 452, 454, 189 S.E.2d 1, 2 (1972) (&quot;[A] conviction will not be\r\n  reversed for nonprejudicial error in the admission of evidence.&quot;).\r\nE.&nbsp;Request to Charge ABHAN \r\nAt the conclusion of the State's case, Green requested\r\n  the judge charge the lesser-included offense of attempted ABHAN.  The trial\r\n  judge denied Green's request on the ground there was &quot;no evidence [or]\r\n  conduct that could have been construed as an ABHAN.&quot;  \r\nOn appeal, Green asserts the trial judge erred in\r\n  denying his request to charge as the evidence warranted a charge on attempted\r\n  ABHAN.  Because he believed Mandy was actually a woman in her twenties, based\r\n  on the online profile picture, and that he did not intend to engage in sexual\r\n  activity once he met Mandy,[8] Green claims he was entitled\r\n  to a charge on the lesser-included offense of attempted ABHAN. \r\n&quot;The law to be charged must be\r\n  determined from the evidence presented at trial.&quot;  State v. Knoten,\r\n  347 S.C. 296, 302, 555 S.E.2d 391, 394 (2001).  A trial judge is required to charge\r\n  the jury on a lesser-included offense if there is evidence from which it could\r\n  be inferred the lesser, rather than the greater, offense was committed.  State\r\n    v. Drayton, 293 S.C. 417, 428, 361 S.E.2d 329, 335 (1987).\r\n&quot;ABHAN is a lesser included offense\r\n  of ACSC, notwithstanding that technically ACSC does not contain all of the\r\n  elements of ABHAN.&quot;  State v. Geiger, 370 S.C. 600, 606, 635 S.E.2d\r\n  669, 672 (Ct. App. 2006); see 3 S.C. Jur. Assault and Battery §\r\n  26 (Supp. 2012) (discussing cases involving a jury instruction for ABHAN as a\r\n  lesser-included offense).  &quot;ABHAN is the unlawful act of violent injury to\r\n  another accompanied by circumstances of aggravation.&quot;  State v. Fennell,\r\n  340 S.C. 266, 274, 531 S.E.2d 512, 516 (2000).  &quot;Circumstances of\r\n  aggravation include the use of a deadly weapon, the intent to commit a felony,\r\n  infliction of serious bodily injury, great disparity in the ages or physical\r\n  conditions of the parties, a difference in gender, the purposeful infliction of shame and\r\n  disgrace, taking indecent liberties or familiarities with a female, and\r\n  resistance to lawful authority.&quot;  Id. at 274, 531 S.E.2d at 516-17.[9]\r\nAs previously stated, a person is guilty\r\n  of CSC with a minor in the second-degree if &quot;the actor engages in sexual\r\n  battery with a victim who is fourteen years of age or less but who is at least\r\n  eleven years of age.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 16-3-655(B)(1) (Supp. 2011). \r\nWe find the trial judge properly declined\r\n  to charge attempted ABHAN.  As evidenced by the text of the online chat,\r\n  Green's clear intent was to engage in sexual activity with Mandy, who he\r\n  believed to be fourteen years old.  After Mandy responded that she was fourteen\r\n  years old, the conversation turned sexual in nature with Green asking Mandy\r\n  about her previous sexual experiences, whether she would have sex with him, and\r\n  sending her the explicit pictures.  Moreover, when Mandy asked Green, &quot;u\r\n  aint like gonna kill me or kidnap me r u?&quot;, Green responded &quot;lol hell\r\n  no.&quot;  Thus, Green intended only to &quot;engage in sexual battery with a\r\n  victim who is fourteen years of age or less.&quot;  Accordingly, there was no\r\n  evidence demonstrating that Green was guilty of the lesser-included offense of\r\n  attempted ABHAN rather than the crime of attempted CSC with a minor in the\r\n  second-degree.  \r\nIII.&nbsp;Conclusion\r\nIn conclusion, we affirm Green's convictions for\r\n  criminal solicitation of a minor and attempted CSC with a minor in the second-degree\r\n  as:  (1) the criminal solicitation of a minor statute is not unconstitutionally\r\n  overbroad or vague; (2) the use of a law enforcement officer to impersonate a\r\n  minor victim was legally permissible to support both convictions; (3) Green had\r\n  the requisite specific intent and committed an overt act in furtherance of the CSC\r\n  charge under Reid; (4) the challenged photographs were relevant and\r\n  their probative value outweighed any prejudicial effect; and (5) there was no\r\n  evidence to support Green's request to charge attempted ABHAN.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  S.C.

Friedman, of Columbia, for Petitioner.\r\n        David B.\r\n          Tarr, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE BEATTY:  In this Post-Conviction Relief (PCR) case, Robert\r\n  Bayly was issued a uniform traffic ticket for simple possession of marijuana. \r\n  Prior to trial, Bayly paid the required fine and did not appear in court on the\r\n  trial date.  Bayly did not appeal his conviction but, instead, filed a PCR\r\n  application in which he alleged the magistrate court was without subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to convict him as no arrest warrant had been issued.  The PCR\r\n  judge granted the petition and vacated Bayly's conviction.  This Court granted\r\n  the State's petition for a writ of certiorari to review the PCR judge's order. \r\n  We reverse.\r\nI.\r\nBayly, a licensed truck driver, was traveling from his\r\n  home in Delaware to Florida when he was pulled over for speeding in Hampton\r\n  County, South Carolina.  At that time, the officer found marijuana in the glove\r\n  compartment of Bayly's vehicle.  As a result, the officer issued Bayly a\r\n  uniform traffic ticket for simple possession of marijuana.  The ticket noted\r\n  that Bayly was to appear before a magistrate in Varnville, South Carolina on\r\n  February 25, 2009 at 10:00 a.m.  Bayly, however, mailed in the fine in the\r\n  amount of $570 and did not appear for trial.  The magistrate court judge\r\n  convicted Bayly in his absence.  Bayly did not appeal his conviction.  \r\nTwo months later, Bayly received a letter from the\r\n  South Carolina Department of Motor Vehicles stating his license was suspended\r\n  in South Carolina for six months.  Shortly thereafter, Bayly received a letter\r\n  from the Delaware Division of Motor Vehicles informing him that his license was\r\n  suspended in Delaware for two years.\r\nBayly filed a PCR application in which he primarily\r\n  contended his conviction was void as the magistrate court lacked subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction to hear his case.  During the PCR hearing, Bayly argued that, pursuant\r\n  to section 22-3-710 of the South Carolina Code,[1] all proceedings in magistrate court must be commenced under issuance of a\r\n  warrant and under oath.  In support of this assertion, Bayly cited Town of\r\n    Honea Path v. Wright, 194 S.C. 461, 9 S.E.2d 924 (1940), wherein this Court\r\n  interpreted the precursor to section 22-3-710.  Based on Wright, Bayly\r\n  claimed that any conviction without the issuance of a warrant was a nullity. \r\nBayly acknowledged that section 56-7-10,[2] which was enacted in 1971, listed numerous exceptions where the magistrate\r\n  court is vested with jurisdiction pursuant to a uniform traffic ticket rather\r\n  than a warrant.  However, Bayly pointed out that simple possession of marijuana\r\n  is not identified within the listed exceptions.  Bayly indicated that he\r\n  believed the uniform traffic ticket was sufficient for an arrest but not\r\n  sufficient to confer subject matter jurisdiction on the magistrate court.  \r\nAt the conclusion of the PCR hearing, the judge ruled\r\n  the magistrate court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to convict Bayly of\r\n  simple possession of marijuana because no arrest warrant was issued as required\r\n  under section 22-3-710.  The judge noted that section 56-7-10 listed exceptions\r\n  to this requirement; however, because simple possession of marijuana is not\r\n  listed as an exception, he found that a warrant was required.  Based on Wright,\r\n  the PCR judge found a proceeding in summary court is a nullity if commenced\r\n  without the issuance of a warrant.\r\nThe State petitioned this Court for a writ of\r\n  certiorari to review the PCR judge's order.  This Court granted the State's\r\n  petition.\r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nThe State argues the PCR judge's reliance on Wright was misplaced as this case was decided prior to the existence of uniform\r\n  traffic tickets and before the enactment of sections 56-7-10 and 56-7-15.  The\r\n  State directs the Court's attention to the following provisions of section\r\n  56-7-15:\r\n\r\n  (A) The uniform traffic\r\n    ticket, established pursuant to the provisions of Section 56-7-10, may be used\r\n    by law enforcement officers to arrest a person for an offense committed in the\r\n    presence of a law enforcement officer if the punishment is within the\r\n    jurisdiction of magistrates court and municipal court . . . .\r\n  (B) An officer who effects an arrest, by\r\n    use of a uniform traffic ticket, for a violation of Chapter 25, Title 16 shall\r\n    complete and file an incident report immediately following the issuance of the\r\n    uniform traffic ticket.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-7-15 (Supp.\r\n  2010).\r\nBased\r\n  on the plain terms of the statute, the State avers that a literal reading of\r\n  section 56-7-15 provides for the use of a uniform traffic ticket for any\r\n  offense that falls within the jurisdiction of the magistrate court and is\r\n  committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer.  \r\nThe State further\r\n  asserts that section 56-7-15(B) &quot;broadens the range of offenses in which a\r\n  uniform traffic ticket may be used in lieu of an arrest warrant.&quot;  In\r\n  interpreting this code section, the State contends the General Assembly\r\n  &quot;clearly anticipated that a uniform traffic ticket could be used for a\r\n  violation of § 16-25-10 through § 16-25-125 (the criminal domestic violence\r\n  chapter).&quot;  In view of this construction, the State claims that section\r\n  56-7-15(B) would be rendered meaningless if the uniform traffic ticket could be\r\n  used only for a statute listed in section 56-7-10 because &quot;no statute in\r\n  Chapter 25 of Title 16 is listed there.&quot;\r\nB.\r\n Initially, it is\r\n  instructive to consider the fundamental principles of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.  In State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005),\r\n  this Court clarified that &quot;subject matter jurisdiction is the power of a\r\n  court to hear and determine cases of the general class to which the proceedings\r\n  in question belong.&quot;  Id. at 100, 610 S.E.2d at 498.  Based on this\r\n  clarification, we conclusively recognized that an indictment, which is a notice\r\n  document, does not confer subject matter jurisdiction on a circuit court.  Id. at 102, 610 S.E.2d at 500.  Thus, an arrest warrant, similar to an indictment,[3] does not operate to vest a magistrate or municipal court with subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.  Instead, the General Assembly establishes the jurisdiction of\r\n  these courts in a legislative pronouncement.  \r\nIn terms of\r\n  magistrate courts, our state Constitution authorizes the General Assembly to\r\n  provide for their civil and criminal jurisdiction.  S.C. Const. art. V, § 26.  Pursuant\r\n  to this authority, the General Assembly enacted Title 22 of the South Carolina Code\r\n  to establish the jurisdiction of magistrate courts and the proceedings utilized\r\n  to exercise this jurisdiction.  S.C. Code Ann. §§ 22-1-10 to 22-8-50 (2007\r\n  &amp; Supp. 2010).\r\nSpecifically,\r\n  section 22-3-540 provides for the general jurisdiction of the magistrate court,\r\n  stating:\r\n\r\n  Magistrates shall have exclusive\r\n    jurisdiction of all criminal cases in which the punishment does not exceed a\r\n    fine of one hundred dollars or imprisonment for thirty days, except cases in\r\n    which an offense within the jurisdiction of a magistrate is included in the\r\n    charge of an offense beyond his jurisdiction or when it is permissible to join\r\n    a charge of an offense within his jurisdiction with one or more of which the\r\n    magistrate has no jurisdiction.  Magistrates shall have concurrent but not\r\n    exclusive jurisdiction in the excepted cases.  The provisions of this section\r\n    shall not be construed so as to limit the jurisdiction of any magistrate whose\r\n    jurisdiction has been extended beyond that stated above.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 22-3-540\r\n  (2007).  A magistrate court's jurisdiction, however, is not limited to the\r\n  provisions of this code section as the last sentence indicates that the General\r\n  Assembly may extend the jurisdiction of the magistrate court beyond what is set\r\n  forth in section 22-3-540.  See, e.g., S.C. Code Ann. § 22-3-550(A)\r\n  (2007 &amp; Supp. 2010) (providing that, in general,\r\n  magistrates have criminal jurisdiction &quot;of all offenses which may be\r\n  subject to the penalties of a fine or forfeiture not exceeding five hundred\r\n  dollars, or imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or both&quot;).\r\nWe find section\r\n  56-7-10 was enacted to serve a two-fold purpose.  First, this code section expands\r\n  the general jurisdiction of the magistrate court by identifying certain\r\n  offenses beyond the statutory limits of section 22-3-540.  Secondly, section\r\n  56-7-10 eliminates the need for an arrest warrant and authorizes the use of a\r\n  uniform traffic ticket to notify an accused and commence judicial proceedings\r\n  in the magistrate court.  We find that it is not the service of the uniform\r\n  traffic ticket that confers subject matter jurisdiction to the magistrate but,\r\n  rather, the General Assembly's purposeful identification of certain offenses\r\n  for which the magistrate is authorized to hear.\r\nThus, in accord\r\n  with our pronouncement in Gentry, we find that neither a uniform traffic\r\n  ticket nor an arrest warrant operates to confer subject matter jurisdiction on\r\n  the magistrate court.  Conversely, the absence of a uniform traffic ticket or\r\n  arrest warrant does not render a magistrate's court conviction a nullity.\r\nBased on the\r\n  foregoing, we disagree with the PCR judge's reliance on Wright as the\r\n  lack of a warrant under section 22-3-710 does not negate the jurisdiction of\r\n  the magistrate court.[4] \r\n  As will be discussed, we find the reasoning in Wright is flawed and has\r\n  been implicitly overruled by subsequent decisions issued by this Court.\r\nIn Wright,\r\n  which was decided in 1940 prior to the enactment of sections 56-7-10 and\r\n  56-7-15, the defendant was convicted before the Mayor's Court in the Town of\r\n  Honea Path of driving under the influence.  Wright, 194 S.C. at 463, 9\r\n  S.E.2d at 925.  The defendant appealed, arguing his conviction was a nullity\r\n  because no warrant was issued setting forth the nature and grounds of the\r\n  accusations against him.  Id. at 466, 9 S.E.2d at 926.  In response, the\r\n  Town contended it was not necessary to issue a warrant in a municipal court\r\n  where the arrest was made for an offense committed in the presence and view of\r\n  police officers.  Id.\r\nAnalyzing the\r\n  precursor to section 22-3-710, this Court rejected the Town's contention and\r\n  reasoned:\r\n\r\n  There is a marked difference between the arrest of an\r\n    offender by an officer without a warrant, and proceedings before a magistrate\r\n    which include formal charges supported by oath, bail, and trial.  Nor does the\r\n    provision in Section 930, to the effect that proceedings before magistrates\r\n    shall be summary, dispense with the very process which gives them\r\n    jurisdiction.  Without doubt, the administration of the law, and the rights of\r\n    persons charged with crime can best be served by a due observance of statutory\r\n    requirements.  It is the constitutional right of a person charged with a\r\n    criminal offense to be fully informed of the nature and cause of the\r\n    accusation.  Article I, Section 18 of the Constitution.  When a warrant is\r\n    issued, substantially setting forth the offense, and the verdict of the jury,\r\n    or that of the magistrate, is endorsed thereon, this paper becomes original\r\n    evidence, and prevents any possibility of the prisoner being again tried for\r\n    the same offense.  And this was no doubt one of the reasons which moved the\r\n    Legislature to require that all prosecutions be commenced by the issuance of a\r\n    warrant.  And because the rights of the accused are not only of interest to\r\n    him, but concern the state, the statutory requirement may not be waived.\r\n\r\nId. at 468-69, 9 S.E.2d at 927.[5]\r\nThirteen years\r\n  later, this Court recognized the flawed analysis in Wright when it\r\n  issued its opinion in State v. Langford, 223 S.C. 20, 73 S.E.2d 854\r\n  (1953), overruled on other grounds by State v. Gentry, 363 S.C.\r\n  93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005).  In Langford, the defendant was arrested\r\n  without a warrant for DUI after the alleged offense was committed in view of\r\n  the arresting officers.  Id. at 23, 73 S.E.2d at 855.  The defendant was\r\n  released on bond.  When the defendant failed to appear before the municipal\r\n  court, the defendant's bond was forfeited and the violation was reported to the\r\n  State Highway Department.  Approximately three years later, the defendant was\r\n  arrested and charged as a second offender.  Id. at 24, 73 S.E.2d at\r\n  855.  During the trial of this offense, the defendant moved for a directed\r\n  verdict on the grounds the first offense was a nullity as the municipal court\r\n  did not have jurisdiction and there had never been a lawful forfeiture of bail\r\n  to constitute a first offense.  Id.  After the trial judge granted the\r\n  defendant's motion, the State appealed.  Id.\r\nThe primary issue\r\n  on appeal involved the question of whether there can be a valid forfeiture of\r\n  bail where no arrest warrant had been issued.  This Court, however, also\r\n  discussed the jurisdictional implications of the precursor to section\r\n  22-3-710.  Id. at 26, 73 S.E.2d at 856-57.  In prefacing its discussion,\r\n  this Court noted the distinction between subject matter jurisdiction and\r\n  jurisdiction over the person.  Id.  In doing so, this Court expressed\r\n  its disagreement with the holdings in Wright and Praser. \r\nAlthough this Court\r\n  acknowledged that it was not &quot;called upon now to pass upon the legality of\r\n  the trial and conviction of an accused without a warrant,&quot; it nevertheless\r\n  espoused the following:\r\n\r\n  There is no constitutional requirement in this State\r\n    that criminal prosecutions in inferior courts shall be commenced by the\r\n    issuance of a warrant.  The provision in Section 930 of the 1942 Code that all\r\n    proceedings in such courts 'shall be commenced on information under oath * * *\r\n    upon which, and only which, shall a warrant of arrest issue', cannot reasonably\r\n    be construed as forbidding any steps in the judicial process until an\r\n    information under oath is filed. \r\n\r\nId. at 31, 73 S.E.2d at 859.\r\nTwo decades later,\r\n  this Court issued a series of opinions that appear to implicitly overrule the Wright decision.  See State v. Prince, 262 S.C. 89, 91, 202 S.E.2d 645,\r\n  646 (1974) (analyzing precursor to section 56-7-10 and rejecting defendant's\r\n  contention that the magistrate court was without jurisdiction of his person to\r\n  hear DUI case because no arrest warrant had been issued as the statute\r\n  &quot;expressly provides that service of the uniform traffic summons 'shall vest\r\n  all traffic courts with jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the charge for\r\n  which such ticket was issued and served'&quot;; finding authorities relied upon\r\n  by defendant were inapplicable &quot;because they involved trials antedating\r\n  the 1971 statute&quot;); State v. Fennell, 263 S.C. 216, 220, 209 S.E.2d\r\n  433, 434 (1974) (citing Praser, Wright, and Langford and\r\n  stating &quot;[t]he issuance of either a uniform traffic ticket or a\r\n  warrant charging the respondent with the offense of reckless driving was\r\n  necessary to give the magistrate jurisdiction to dispose of that particular\r\n  offense&quot; (emphasis added)); State v. Biehl, 271 S.C. 201, 203, 246\r\n  S.E.2d 859, 860 (1978) (recognizing that section 56-7-10 &quot;does not repeal\r\n  [section] 22-3-710 . . . [i]t merely provides a method of acquiring\r\n  jurisdiction in traffic cases tried in 'all traffic courts'&quot;; finding\r\n  issuance of a uniform traffic ticket vests jurisdiction in the traffic court to\r\n  hear a case involving an offense which the officer, who issued the summons, did\r\n  not actually see, and, &quot;[t]he issuance of the uniform traffic ticket\r\n  merely summons the accused person to appear before a magistrate, where he may\r\n  submit any contention relative to the preservation of his rights&quot;); see\r\n    also City of Goose Creek v. Brady, 288 S.C. 20, 21, 339 S.E.2d 509,\r\n  510 (1986) (citing Biehl and finding issuance of a uniform traffic ticket\r\n  was sufficient and an arrest warrant unnecessary under section 22-3-710 in\r\n  order to charge and try defendant in municipal court with DUI and driving left\r\n  of center; recognizing that a uniform traffic ticket complied with constitutional\r\n  mandates where it apprised the defendant of the charge as well as the time,\r\n  date, and place the offense allegedly occurred).\r\nIn 1990, the\r\n  General Assembly enacted section 56-7-15, which specifically references section\r\n  56-7-10, to expand the list of offenses for which a uniform traffic ticket may\r\n  be used to arrest a person and to authorize the magistrate court to hear these\r\n  offenses.  This enactment, however, did not operate to increase the subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction of the magistrate court as the punishment for the offense\r\n  for which the traffic ticket is issued must be &quot;within the jurisdiction of\r\n  magistrates court and municipal court.&quot;  Id. § 56-7-15(A).\r\nBased\r\n  on the above-outlined case and statutory evolution, we find the PCR judge's\r\n  reliance on Wright was erroneous as was his ultimate decision to vacate\r\n  Bayly's conviction.  Section 56-7-15 authorized the officer to issue a uniform\r\n  traffic ticket for simple possession of marijuana as this offense was committed\r\n  in his presence and the punishment for this offense fell within the purview of\r\n  the magistrate court.  Specifically, simple possession of marijuana is\r\n  classified as a misdemeanor that is punishable by not more than thirty days'\r\n  imprisonment or a fine not less than $100 or more than $200.  S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  44-53-370(d)(4) (Supp. 2010).  As previously stated, section 22-3-540 provides\r\n  for magistrate courts to have exclusive jurisdiction of all criminal cases in\r\n  which punishment does not exceed a fine of $100 or imprisonment for thirty days\r\n  and section 22-3-550(A) increases the amount of the maximum fine to $500.  Thus,\r\n  we find no procedural or jurisdictional defects that operated to invalidate\r\n  Bayly's conviction.\r\nIII.\r\nAccordingly, we\r\n  reverse the PCR judge's order as it was controlled by an error of law.  See Bailey v. State, 392 S.C. 422, 709 S.E.2d 671 (2011) (recognizing that\r\n  this Court will reverse the decision of the PCR judge when it is controlled by\r\n  an error of law).\r\n\r\nREVERSED.[6]\r\nTOAL, C.J., KITTREDGE and\r\n  HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in a separate opinion.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I concur in result but write separately because I\r\n  would not employ the reasoning of State v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610\r\n  S.E.2d 494 (2005), in determining this case, as I believe it inapposite.  I\r\n  believe the Constitution and statutory law govern.\r\nUse\r\n  of a uniform traffic ticket is authorized for offenses “committed in the\r\n  presence of a law enforcement officer if the punishment is within the\r\n  jurisdiction of magistrates court and municipal court.”  S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  §56-7-15(A) (Supp. 2011).  The jurisdiction of magistrates court is limited to those\r\n  offenses subject to fines or forfeitures not exceeding five hundred dollars,\r\n  imprisonment not exceeding thirty days, or both.  S.C. Code Ann. § 22-3-550(A)\r\n  (Supp. 2011).  Thus, a uniform traffic ticket may be issued for any offense\r\n  that is both committed in the presence of a law enforcement officer and subject\r\n  to a maximum penalty of no more than thirty days’ imprisonment and a five\r\n  hundred dollar fine.\r\nIn\r\n  this case, a traffic ticket was issued for simple possession of marijuana when\r\n  the law enforcement officer discovered the marijuana in respondent’s\r\n  constructive possession.  The offense was thus committed in the presence of a\r\n  law enforcement officer.  As the majority recognizes, the maximum penalty for\r\n  conviction under § 44-53-370(d)(4) for possession of one ounce or less of\r\n  marijuana is thirty days’ imprisonment and a fine of $200.  Thus, issuance of a\r\n  uniform traffic ticket was permissible under §§ 56-7-15(A) and 22-3-550(A).\r\nA\r\n  magistrates court has jurisdiction over offenses for which valid arrest\r\n  warrants have issued pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. § 22-3-710.  A uniform traffic\r\n  ticket may substitute for the arrest warrant pursuant to S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  56-7-10 (Supp. 2011) (“The service of the uniform traffic ticket shall vest all\r\n  traffic, recorders’ and magistrates’ courts with jurisdiction to hear and to\r\n  dispose of the charge for which the ticket was issued and served.”).  As noted\r\n  above, § 56-7-15(A) allows the use of uniform traffic tickets in lieu of the\r\n  arrest warrant required under § 22-3-710.  See also S.C. Const. art. V,\r\n  § 26 (“The General Assembly shall provide for [magistrates’] terms of office\r\n  and their civil and criminal jurisdiction.”).  Thus, a properly issued uniform\r\n  traffic ticket vests magistrates court with jurisdiction to hear and dispose of\r\n  the related charge, and I agree with the majority that the magistrates court\r\n  had jurisdiction to hear and dispose of the offense in this case.  \r\nI\r\n  disagree that the General Assembly’s grant of general subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction in §§ 22-3-540 and 22-3-550 is sufficient to confer the authority\r\n  to exercise jurisdiction in the face of the requirements of §§ 22-3-710,\r\n  56-7-10, and 56-7-15(A).  \r\nThe majority cites State\r\n  v. Gentry, supra, for the proposition that an indictment is not\r\n  necessary to confer subject matter jurisdiction on a circuit court; by analogy,\r\n  neither an arrest warrant nor a uniform traffic ticket is necessary to vest a\r\n  magistrates court with jurisdiction.  Recently this Court, in rejecting a\r\n  subject matter jurisdiction argument, clarified that “Gentry merely held\r\n  that a defendant must challenge an indictment prior to the swearing of the\r\n  jury.  Because the sufficiency of the indictment is not at issue here, Gentry is inapposite.”  State v. Dickerson, 395 S.C. 101, 120, 716 S.E.2d 895,\r\n  905-06 (2011).  Since we have no challenge to the sufficiency of the uniform\r\n  traffic ticket here, Gentry is inapposite.  Moreover, the General\r\n  Assembly provided for indictment or waiver.  See S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  17-23-130 (2003).  It has not chosen to provide for a defendant’s ability to\r\n  waive the warrant or ticket.  See Town of Honea Path v. Wright,\r\n  194 S.C. 461, 9 S.E.2d 924 (1940).  Whether couched as an issue of subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction or as the court’s jurisdiction, I believe a magistrates\r\n  court conviction obtained without one of the specified charging documents is a\r\n  nullity.  Id.\r\nI\r\n  therefore concur only in the result reached by the majority.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  Section 22-3-710 states, &quot;All proceedings before magistrates in criminal cases shall\r\n  be commenced on information under oath, plainly and substantially setting forth\r\n  the offense charged, upon which, and only which, shall a warrant of arrest\r\n  issue.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. § 22-3-710 (2007).\r\n[2]  Section 56-7-10 states, &quot;There will be a uniform traffic ticket used by all law\r\n  enforcement officers in arrests for traffic offenses and for the following\r\n  additional offenses:  [list of offenses] . . . .&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  56-7-10 (Supp. 2010).\r\n[3]  See 5 Am. Jur. 2d Arrest § 21 (2007)\r\n  (&quot;The purpose of stating the offense on an arrest warrant is to provide\r\n  notice to the person being taken into custody of the charges alleged against\r\n  him or her.&quot;).\r\n[4]  Furthermore, it is of some import that section\r\n  22-3-710 is contained within the &quot;Criminal Procedure&quot; section of\r\n  Title 22 and not the &quot;Criminal Jurisdiction&quot; section.\r\n[5]  Notably, the Court in reaching its decision relied\r\n  primarily on the case of State v. Praser, 173 S.C. 284, 175 S.E. 551\r\n  (1934), wherein the defendant was convicted in municipal court for breach of\r\n  the peace and vagrancy.  On appeal, this Court vacated the defendant's\r\n  conviction for vagrancy on the ground that no warrant had been issued for this\r\n  offense as the defendant was orally charged during the proceedings for the\r\n  breach of the peace offense.  Id. at 286, 175 S.E. at 551.  We believe Praser should not have served as the basis for the Wright decision due to the\r\n  significant factual differences.  Unlike the defendant in Praser, Wright\r\n  was on notice of the charged offense as he was apprised of the DUI charge at\r\n  the time the officers arrested him.\r\n[6]  Justice Pleicones disagrees with our reliance on State\r\n  v. Gentry, 363 S.C. 93, 610 S.E.2d 494 (2005) in analyzing the question\r\n  regarding subject matter jurisdiction.  He opines that Gentry is\r\n  inapposite because Gentry merely concerned the appropriate time to raise\r\n  a challenge to the sufficiency of an indictment.  He is correct that Gentry reiterates that the insufficiency of an indictment must be raised prior to the\r\n  swearing of the jury.  However, he overlooks the fact that the primary issue in Gentry was a challenge to the subject matter jurisdiction of the circuit\r\n  court.  Specifically, the subject matter jurisdiction challenge was based on an\r\n  alleged insufficiency in the indictment, not the timeliness of the challenge to\r\n  the insufficiency in the indictment.  Justice Pleicones acknowledged this fact\r\n  when he authored the opinion in State v. Dudley, 364 S.C. 578, 614\r\n  S.E.2d 623 (2005), wherein he relied almost exclusively on Gentry to\r\n  find that extraterritorial jurisdiction is not a component of subject matter\r\n  jurisdiction.  Indisputably, Gentry is the seminal case in our\r\n  jurisprudence that deals in concert with subject matter jurisdiction and the\r\n  sufficiency of an indictment. We would note that, aside from his disagreement\r\n  with the import of Gentry, the concurrence merely restates the majority\r\n  opinion. \r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27110","title":"State v.

McIntosh, and Assistant\r\n          Attorney General Ashley A. McMahan, all of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  After\r\n  a bench trial, appellant was convicted of possession of a firearm during the\r\n  commission of the crime of trafficking in marijuana.  On appeal, he contends\r\n  that the trial court erroneously convicted him without finding that a nexus\r\n  existed between his possession of firearms and his drug trafficking.  While we agree\r\n  that a nexus between the possession of the firearm and the underlying violent\r\n  crime must be established, we find that the trial judge made a factual finding\r\n  that such a nexus existed in this case and that the finding was supported by\r\n  evidence in the record.  We therefore affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn December 2007, appellant was arrested in the\r\n  parking lot outside his apartment after authorities received information\r\n  identifying him as a marijuana dealer.  After appellant’s arrest, law\r\n  enforcement personnel recovered marijuana from his person; a pistol from the\r\n  door panel of his car; marijuana in jars and bags, scales, smoking pipes, and\r\n  other drug paraphernalia from his apartment; and approximately twenty pounds of\r\n  marijuana and a .357 caliber pistol along with a few other items from a safe appellant\r\n  owned.  Appellant pleaded guilty to two marijuana trafficking charges.  After a\r\n  bench trial at which the statements of several witnesses were admitted into the\r\n  record, he was found guilty of possession of a firearm during commission of a\r\n  violent crime in violation of S.C. Code Ann. § 16-23-490(A) (2003).  This\r\n  appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  1. Does the\r\n    crime of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime\r\n    require proof of a nexus between possession of the firearm and the violent\r\n    crime?\r\n  2. Was such a\r\n    nexus established in this case?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant contends that the crime of possession of a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime requires proof of a nexus\r\n  between the possession and the violent crime, so that mere proof of\r\n  constructive possession of a firearm is insufficient to support a conviction.  We\r\n  agree, and hold that the State must prove a nexus between the predicate offense\r\n  and the defendant’s actual or constructive possession of a firearm during its\r\n  commission.\r\nSection 16-23-490(A) imposes a penalty, in addition to\r\n  the penalty for the underlying offense, on those convicted of possessing a\r\n  firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  It provides, in pertinent\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n  (A) If a\r\n    person is in possession of a firearm or visibly displays what appears to be a\r\n    firearm or visibly displays a knife during the commission of a violent crime\r\n    and is convicted of committing or attempting to commit a violent crime as defined\r\n    in Section 16-1-60,[1] he must be imprisoned five years, in addition to the punishment provided for\r\n    the principal crime. \r\n\r\nAppellant argues, and we agree, that the statute must\r\n  be interpreted as requiring a nexus between the underlying violent crime and\r\n  the possession of a firearm.\r\n“In the interpretation of statutes, our sole function\r\n  is to determine and, within constitutional limits, give effect to the intent of\r\n  the legislature, with reference to the meaning of the language used and the\r\n  subject matter and purpose of the statute.”  State v. Ramsey, 311 S.C.\r\n  555, 561, 430 S.E.2d 511, 515 (1993).  The words of the statute must be given\r\n  their ordinary meaning unless something in the statute indicates that the\r\n  legislature intended a different meaning.  Mid-State Auto Auction of\r\n    Lexington, Inc. v. Altman, 324 S.C. 65, 69, 476 S.E.2d 690, 692 (1996). \r\n  “In interpreting a statute, the language of the statute must be read in a sense\r\n  that harmonizes with its subject matter and accords with its general purpose.”  Town of Mt. Pleasant v. Roberts, 393 S.C. 332, 342, 713 S.E.2d 278, 283\r\n  (2011).\r\nThe subject matter and general purpose of the statute lead\r\n  us to conclude that the General Assembly intended to penalize possession of a\r\n  firearm only when possession furthers or is intended to further a violent\r\n  crime.  The statute punishes the visible display of a knife or an object that\r\n  appears to be a firearm during the commission of a violent crime.  Visibly\r\n  displaying a knife or an object that appears to be a firearm furthers the\r\n  criminal’s objectives by increasing the cost of resistance or interference.  Thus,\r\n  a nexus is inherent in this prohibited conduct.\r\nThe statute also criminalizes the possession[2] of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime even if not visibly\r\n  displayed. Because a firearm has greater power to inflict harm, its mere\r\n  presence at the scene of the crime is a greater threat than that of a knife or\r\n  an object that appears to be a firearm.  Thus, the General Assembly determined\r\n  that merely possessing a firearm in furtherance of a violent crime warrants a\r\n  penalty.  \r\nHowever, the fact that the General Assembly sought to\r\n  deter even the possession of a firearm in connection with a violent crime does\r\n  not suggest that it intended to criminalize any possession of a firearm, no\r\n  matter how unrelated, during the commission of a violent offense.[3] \r\n  The General Assembly’s evident purpose was to increase the penalty of engaging\r\n  in more dangerous conduct, whether that conduct is displaying a knife, firearm,\r\n  or object that appears to be a firearm or possessing a firearm in furtherance\r\n  of a violent offense.  The General Assembly’s purpose would not be furthered by\r\n  penalizing possession of a firearm that is entirely unrelated to the violent\r\n  offense.  Indeed, finding that no nexus is required may raise constitutional\r\n  questions in some cases, since the Second Amendment protects the possession of\r\n  lawful firearms by ordinary citizens.  See District of Columbia v.\r\n    Heller, 554 U.S. 570 (2008); McDonald v. Chicago, 561 U.S. 3025\r\n  (2010).  We have no reason to suppose that the General Assembly intended to\r\n  create constitutional questions, and our interpretation of the statute avoids\r\n  them.  Ramsey, supra.\r\nIn sum, we find that the General Assembly’s purpose in\r\n  enacting this statute was to penalize defendants who actually or constructively\r\n  possess a firearm in order to further a violent crime and who thereby increase\r\n  the attendant risk of harm.  We therefore hold that such a nexus must be\r\n  established in order to convict a defendant for possessing a firearm during the\r\n  commission of a violent crime.  Other courts have arrived at the same\r\n  conclusion when they have interpreted similar statutes.  See Arizona\r\n    v. Petrak, 198 Ariz. 260, 264, 266, 8 P.3d 1174, 1178, 1180 (Ariz. Ct. App.\r\n  2000); Wright v. Virginia, 53 Va. App. 266, 280, 282, 284, 670 S.E.2d\r\n  772, 779-81 (Va. Ct. App. 2009); see also Louisiana v. Blanchard,\r\n  776 So.2d 1165, 1171 (La. 2001); Collins v. Alaska, 977 P.2d 741, 753 (Alaska\r\n  Ct. App. 1999) (Mannheimer, J., concurring in opinion adopted by majority). \r\nA nexus may be established by showing that the firearm\r\n  furthered, advanced, or helped in the commission of the crime.  See Wright,\r\n  53 Va. App. at 283, 670 S.E.2d at 780.  A nexus between possession of a firearm\r\n  and drug trafficking would exist if the firearm is accessible to the trafficker\r\n  and thereby “provides defense against anyone who may attempt to rob the\r\n  trafficker of his drugs or drug profits.”  Similarly, “possessing a gun, and\r\n  letting everyone know that you are armed, lessens the chances that a robbery\r\n  will even be attempted.”  Id. at 283, 670 S.E.2d at 780 (quoting United\r\n    States v. Ceballos-Torres, 218 F.3d 409, 412 (5th Cir. 2000)).  \r\nAppellant pleaded guilty to two charges of trafficking\r\n  in marijuana.  At the conclusion of a bench trial on the charge of possession\r\n  of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime, the judge found him\r\n  guilty.  The trial judge interpreted section 16-23-490(A) as not requiring the\r\n  showing of a nexus and found appellant guilty based upon his finding that\r\n  appellant constructively possessed the firearms that were located in his car\r\n  and safe during the commission of his trafficking offenses.  \r\nAppellant argues that this naked finding was\r\n  insufficient to support a conviction because it failed to establish a nexus,\r\n  and we agree.  However, these were not the judge’s only findings.  The judge\r\n  also found a sufficient nexus from evidence that appellant ordinarily carried a\r\n  pistol for the purpose of letting others know that he was armed while dealing\r\n  drugs.  Appellant argues that this finding was not supported by the evidence in\r\n  the record.  When a defendant is tried without a jury, the judge’s findings of\r\n  fact are entitled to the same deference as a jury’s findings of fact and will\r\n  not be disturbed unless no evidence reasonably supports them.  State v. Hill,\r\n  286 S.C. 283, 284, 333 S.E.2d 789, 790 (Ct. App. 1985).  The trial court’s\r\n  finding was based on a witness’s statement that was admitted into evidence. \r\n  Thus, evidence in the record supports the judge’s finding that a nexus was\r\n  established in this case.  We find no error.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nA nexus between possession of the firearm and the\r\n  underlying violent crime must be established in order for a defendant to be\r\n  convicted of possession of a firearm during the commission of a violent crime. \r\n  In this case, the trial judge found that a nexus existed.  His factual findings\r\n  are entitled to great deference and are based upon competent evidence in the\r\n  record.  We therefore AFFIRM.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] S.C. Code § 16-1-60 (Supp. 2007) provides that drug trafficking as defined in §\r\n  44-53-370(e) is a violent crime.\r\n[2] The element of possession required under the statute is unaffected by our\r\n  holding today.  We have held that the term “possession” embraces actual or\r\n  constructive possession.  State v. Halyard, 274 S.C. 397, 400, 264\r\n  S.E.2d 841, 842 (1980).  In Halyard, this Court held that the appellant\r\n  was not entitled to a directed verdict on a charge of possessing a firearm\r\n  during the commission of a violent crime despite the fact that all of the\r\n  eyewitnesses to the robbery testified that the appellant was not the person\r\n  carrying the firearm.  Id. at 399-400, 264 S.E.2d at 842.\r\n[3] We note that the definition of a violent offense in § 16-1-60 includes boating\r\n  under the influence resulting in death, vessel operator’s failure to render\r\n  assistance resulting in death, failure to stop when signaled by a law\r\n  enforcement vehicle resulting in death, and felony driving under the influence.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27111","title":"Young v.

Paylor, of Rosen Rosen &amp; Hagood, of Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nCHIEF JUSTICE\r\n  TOAL:  Creola Young (Appellant)\r\n  appeals the order of the circuit court, upholding the\r\n  Charleston County School Board's (Board) decision not to renew Appellant's\r\n  employment contract, on the ground that the Board violated Appellant's\r\n  procedural due process rights.  We reverse and remand for further proceedings.\r\nFACTS/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nAppellant taught\r\n  fifth grade at E.B. Ellington Elementary School (School) in Charleston County\r\n  for six years.  During Appellant's tenure there, she received multiple warnings\r\n  and feedback about inappropriate conduct and poor judgment with students, and\r\n  her failure to provide instruction in a satisfactory manner.[1] \r\n  On May 14, 2009, the Associate Superintendent of the Charleston County School District\r\n  (District) recommended the Board not renew Appellant's teaching contract.  Appellant\r\n  made a timely request for a hearing before the Board concerning the\r\n  recommendation.  The Board delegated the hearing function to a three-member\r\n  committee comprised of Board members.  The committee convened for a hearing on\r\n  the renewal recommendation on June 22 and 25, 2009.  Appellant was represented\r\n  by counsel at this hearing and testified before the three-member panel.  Following\r\n  the hearing, the panel voted to uphold the recommendation of non-renewal by a\r\n  vote of two to one.  On July 7, 2009, the committee reported to a quorum of the\r\n  Board during a special telephonic executive session held for the express\r\n  purpose of deciding whether to renew two teaching contracts, one of which was\r\n  Appellant's contract.[2] \r\n  Appellant was not present at this meeting.[3] \r\n  The Board did not have the opportunity to review the hearing transcript as it\r\n  was prepared after the Board issued its written order dismissing Appellant from\r\n  her position.    At the end of the executive session, the Board reconvened in\r\n  open session and voted to accept the committee's recommendation not to renew\r\n  Appellant's contract by a vote of four to three.\r\nOn\r\n  August 3, 2009, the Board issued a formal, written decision, finding the School\r\n  submitted substantial evidence that Appellant incompetently provided\r\n  instruction to her students, failed to obey a district directive and order of\r\n  her supervisor, acted unprofessionally in carrying out her job duties, and was\r\n  unfit for her position.  Consequently, the Board decided not to renew\r\n  Appellant's teaching contract for the 2009-2010 school year.  Appellant filed a\r\n  timely appeal to the circuit court, and the circuit court affirmed the decision\r\n  of the Board.[4] \r\n  This case is before the Court pursuant to Rule 204(b), SCACR.\r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    I.\r\n    Whether the Board's review of\r\n  Appellant's non-renewal appeal hearing violated Appellant's procedural due\r\n  process rights guaranteed by the state's constitution and statutes. \r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    II.\r\n    Whether the Board violated Appellant's\r\n  due process rights by not convening a quorum to hear Appellant's non-renewal\r\n  appeal.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    III.\r\n    Whether the Board's failure to\r\n  issue a decision within ten days of the hearing on the matter violated section\r\n  59-25-470 of the South Carolina Code.\r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThis Court's scope of review when reviewing decisions of school boards\r\n  is governed by the Administrative Procedures Act (APA),   S.C. Code Ann. §\r\n  1-23-380 (Supp. 2011).  Lee Cnty. Sch. Bd. of Trs. v. MLD Charter Sch. Acad.\r\n    Planning Comm., 371 S.C. 561, 565, 641 S.E.2d 24, 26 (2007).  A &quot;review\r\n  of the administrative law judge's order must be confined to the record.&quot; \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2011).  In this case, the Court is not\r\n  called to review the substantive determinations of the Board, but only whether\r\n  Appellant was afforded the procedural due process prescribed by our laws and\r\n  our constitution.  As such, the Court may  \r\n\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if substantive rights of the petitioner\r\n    have been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is:\r\n  \r\n    (a)&nbsp;in violation of\r\n      constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n    (b) in excess of the\r\n      statutory authority of the agency;\r\n    (c) made upon unlawful\r\n      procedure; \r\n    . . . .\r\n  \r\n\r\nId. § 1-23-610(B).\r\nANALYSIS\r\nAppellant contends that the process afforded her was\r\n  constitutionally deficient in one of two ways.  First, Appellant asserts that due\r\n  process requires a quorum of the Board to be present at the non-renewal\r\n  hearing, and therefore, the hearing before a three-member panel of the Board\r\n  violated her rights.  Alternatively, Appellant asserts that a quorum of the Board\r\n  must have the opportunity to weigh the credibility of the witnesses, make\r\n  evidentiary rulings, or review the record, and here, a quorum of the Board did\r\n  not have that opportunity.  Without reaching the delegation issue, we find that,\r\n  at a minimum, a quorum of the Board must engage in a meaningful review\r\n  of the evidence and testimony presented at the dismissal hearing.  Such a\r\n  review did not take place in this case.  Therefore, we reverse and remand for\r\n  further proceedings.\r\n In Board of\r\n  Regents of State Colleges v. Roth, 408 U.S. 564, 578 (1972), the United\r\n  States Supreme Court recognized that public school teachers have a property\r\n  interest in continued employment and, commensurate with that property interest,\r\n  the state must provide notice and an opportunity to be heard before a teacher\r\n  may be deprived of the right to continued employment.  Accordingly, the General\r\n  Assembly has fixed a &quot;mode of procedure&quot; to be followed in teacher\r\n  dismissal matters through the enactment of the Teacher Employment and Dismissal\r\n  Act (TEDA).  See S.C. Code Ann. §§ 59-25-410 to -530 (2004 &amp; Supp.\r\n  2011).  Specifically, section 59-25-470 provides: \r\n\r\n  Within fifteen days after receipt of notice of suspension or\r\n    dismissal, a teacher may serve upon the chairman of the board or the\r\n    superintendent a written request for a hearing before the board. If the teacher\r\n    fails to make such a request, or after a hearing as herein provided for, the\r\n    District Board of Trustees shall take such action and shall enter such order as\r\n    it deems lawful and appropriate. The hearing shall be held by the board not\r\n    less than ten nor more than fifteen days after the request is served, and a\r\n    notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be given the teacher not less\r\n    than five days prior to the date of the hearing. The teacher has the privilege\r\n    of being present at the hearing with counsel and of cross-examining witnesses\r\n    and may offer evidence and witnesses and present any and all defenses to the\r\n    charges. The board shall order the appearance of any witness requested by the\r\n    teacher. The complainants shall initiate the introduction of evidence in\r\n    substantiation of the charges. Within ten days following the hearing, the board\r\n    shall determine whether the evidence showed good and just cause for the notice\r\n    of suspension or dismissal and shall render its decision accordingly, either\r\n    affirming or withdrawing the notice of suspension or dismissal.\r\n\r\nId. § 59-25-470.   \r\nPromulgated\r\n  before the passage of TEDA, section 59-19-110 of the South Carolina Code grants\r\n  a school board general rule-making authority and states:\r\n\r\n  This rule-making power shall specifically include the right, at\r\n    the discretion of the board, to designate one or more of its members to conduct\r\n    any hearing in connection with any responsibility of the board and to make a\r\n    report on this hearing to the board for its determination.\r\n\r\nId. § 59-19-110 (2004).   The\r\n  Board relies upon this provision for its authority to delegate the hearing\r\n  function to a three member sub-committee of the Board.\r\nThis\r\n  Court's decision in Pettiford v. South Carolina State Board of Education,\r\n  218 S.C. 322, 62 S.E.2d 780 (1950), elucidates the requirement that, at a\r\n  minimum, a quorum of a school's board of education must review the evidence\r\n  presented at a non-renewal or dismissal hearing in a meaningful way.  In Pettiford, the Court considered the question of whether the\r\n  State Board of Education violated the petitioner's due process rights when only\r\n  two members of the State Board of Education heard the testimony of the\r\n  witnesses rather than a quorum of that body.  218 S.C. at 341, 62 S.E.2d\r\n  at 788-89.  The Court held that the petitioner's due\r\n  process rights were not violated by the delegation of the fact-finding function\r\n  to hearing officers, so long as they presented their findings to the full\r\n  board, and the full board then based its decision on such facts: \r\n\r\n  [D]ue process requires that an administrative board, or body, when\r\n    acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, must consider all the evidence before rendering its decision upon any particular question. This does not mean\r\n    that this administrative board, or body, must itself hear the evidence, but\r\n      it must have the evidence before it, and consider such evidence when\r\n    rendering its decision.\r\n\r\nId. at 345-6, 62 S.E.2d at 791 (emphasis added).[5]  \r\n  The Court continued, &quot;The record and evidence shows that this requirement\r\n    has been met in rendering its decision . . . .&quot;  Id. at 346, 62\r\n    S.E.2d at 791.\r\nAssuming\r\n  arguendo that the delegation authority given school boards in section 59-19-110\r\n  extends to dismissal or non-renewal hearings, this code section requires those\r\n  persons designated to conduct a hearing &quot;to make a report on this\r\n  hearing to the board for its determination.&quot;  S.C. Code Ann. 59-19-110\r\n  (2004) (emphasis added).  The Record in this case is devoid of any evidence\r\n  that such a report was made to a quorum of the Board.  What is clear to this\r\n  Court is that a meaningful review, as contemplated by Pettiford, could\r\n  not have taken place.  It is undisputed that the hearing transcript was not\r\n  available at the July 7, 2009 specially-called telephonic meeting of the Board.[6]  The only evidence in the Record of\r\n  the Board's review was the minutes recorded from this meeting.  The minutes\r\n  state that &quot;[t]he public and the media were duly notified of the meeting,\r\n  in compliance with the South Carolina Freedom of Information Act.&quot;  However,\r\n  an e-mail read at oral argument reflected that Appellant was informed of the\r\n  meeting by the Board's in-house counsel just fifteen minutes before the meeting\r\n  took place.  This notice was insufficient to allow Appellant to be present and,\r\n  importantly, to be represented by counsel before the full Board.   The minutes\r\n  do not reflect that the hearing committee provided the Board a\r\n  &quot;report,&quot; as required by section 59-19-110.  Rather, the minutes\r\n  state that the Board merely &quot;approved the recommendation of the hearing\r\n  committee to uphold the non-renewal&quot; of Appellant’s contract.  Without a\r\n  transcript to recount the evidence, and without the presence of Appellant or Appellant’s\r\n  counsel to represent her interest, the Board could not have properly considered\r\n  the evidence.[7] \r\n  However, the Board's final order states, &quot;After considering the\r\n    evidence presented and the arguments of counsel, the Board has determined\r\n  that the recommendation to not renew [Appellant’s] contract for the 2009-2010\r\n  school year should be upheld.&quot; (emphasis added).  In our opinion, this is\r\n  a disingenuous representation of the procedure that actually took place.   \r\nThe\r\n  Board maintains the review consisted of an oral recitation of the arguments\r\n  made at the non-renewal hearing by the three-member sub-committee that\r\n  conducted the hearing.  Even assuming such colloquy took place, an oral\r\n  recitation of the hearing proceedings by Board members that voted against\r\n  renewal, outside the presence of Appellant and her counsel, is inherently prone\r\n  to bias.  An indispensible component of procedural due process is that the\r\n  persons legally responsible for making a decision must be informed and\r\n  unbiased.  See Garris v. S.C. Reinsurance Facility, 333 S.C. 432, 453,\r\n  511 S.E.2d 48, 59 (1998) (&quot;Due process requires an administrative board,\r\n  when acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, to consider all the evidence before\r\n  deciding a particular question.&quot;).  Accordingly, we find that a meaningful\r\n  review requires some showing that the Board made an informed decision based on\r\n  the evidence presented by both parties.  Anything less deprives school district\r\n  employees the rights afforded them under TEDA to have a dismissal or\r\n  non-renewal recommendation adjudicated by the Board.  See S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  § 59-25-470 (Supp. 2011) (following a hearing, the Board is responsible for\r\n  rendering a decision).  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe review\r\n  undertaken by the Board of Appellant's non-renewal hearing was insufficient to\r\n  satisfy the due process requirements of our constitution and of TEDA. \r\n  Therefore, we reverse the Board's decision to uphold the District's\r\n  recommendation of non-renewal of Appellant's teaching contract and remand the\r\n  case for proceedings that are in-line with statutory and constitutional\r\n  prescriptions.   This issue being dispositive, we decline to reach the\r\n  additional issues brought by Appellant.  See Futch v. McAllister Towing of\r\n    Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999) (appellate court need not address remaining issues when\r\n  disposition of prior issue is dispositive).\r\nREVERSED AND\r\n  REMANDED.\r\nBEATTY and HEARN, JJ.,\r\n  concur. PLEICONES, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which KITTREDGE, J.,\r\n  concurs.\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I respectfully dissent, and would affirm the circuit\r\n  court's order.\r\n I agree that a\r\n  public school teacher must be afforded procedural due process before she can be\r\n  dismissed from employment.  I would hold that S.C. Code Ann. § 59-19-110 (2004)\r\n  permits respondent (Board) &quot;to designate one or more of its members to\r\n  conduct any hearing in connection with any responsibility of the board and to\r\n  make a report on this hearing to the board for its determination.&quot; \r\n  Finally, I agree that due process entitled appellant to (1) adequate notice;\r\n  (2) adequate opportunity for a hearing; (3) the right to introduce evidence;\r\n  and (4) the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses.  E.g., In\r\n    re Vora, 354 S.C. 590, 582 S.E.2d 413 (2003).  As I understand this case,\r\n  appellant was afforded all these rights at her committee hearing.  See also S.C. Code Ann. § 59-25-470 (2004).\r\n The majority\r\n  reverses the circuit court order upholding appellant's dismissal based upon a\r\n  finding that the committee's oral report to the Board was inadequate to permit\r\n  the Board to make a dismissal decision consonant with due process.  I\r\n  disagree.  In Pettiford v. South Carolina State Bd. of Educ., 218 S.C.\r\n  322, 62 S.E.2d 780 (1950), this Court adopted the circuit court order finding a\r\n  teacher had been afforded due process before having her teaching certificate\r\n  revoked.  That order notes:\r\n\r\n  As\r\n    pointed out by Mr. Chief Justice Wolfe, there has been considerable\r\n    misconception of the doctrine announced in Morgan v. United States, 298 U.S.\r\n    468, 56 S.Ct. 906, 912, 80 L.Ed. 1288.  The Morgan case does not hold, as it is\r\n    sometimes cited as holding, that the administrative agency which renders a\r\n    decision, in a quasi-judicial proceeding, must actually hear the evidence and\r\n    see the witnesses.  It does hold that the administrative agency which makes the\r\n    findings must address itself to the evidence, and upon the evidence before it\r\n    must conscientiously reach a conclusion which it deems such evidence to\r\n    justify.  In announcing this rule, however, the Supreme Court of the United\r\n    States, speaking through Mr. Chief Justice Hughes, says: 'This necessary rule does\r\n    not preclude practicable administrative procedure in obtaining the aid of\r\n    assistants in the department.  Assistants may prosecute inquiries.  Evidence\r\n    may be taken by an examiner.  Evidence thus taken may be sifted and analyzed by\r\n    competent subordinates.  Argument may be oral or written.  The requirements are\r\n    not technical.  But there must be a hearing in a substantial sense.  And to\r\n    give the substance of a hearing, which is for the purpose of making\r\n    determinations upon evidence, the officer who makes the determinations must\r\n    consider and appraise the evidence which justifies them'.\r\n  . . . . \r\n  As\r\n    I construe the doctrine, due process requires that an administrative board, or\r\n    body, when acting in a quasi-judicial capacity, must consider all the evidence\r\n    before rendering its decision upon any particular question.  This does not mean\r\n    that this administrative board, or body, must itself hear the evidence, but it\r\n    must have the evidence before it, and consider such evidence when rendering its\r\n    decision.\r\n\r\nPettiford, at 344-346, 62 S.E.2d at 790-791.\r\nHere, the Board's\r\n  minutes show that the Board was in executive session for twenty minutes to\r\n  discuss two personnel matters before voting to uphold the hearing committee's\r\n  recommendation not to renew appellant's teaching contract.  The majority\r\n  concludes that because there was no written transcript of the hearing at the\r\n  time the Board met, that because the minutes do not use the word 'report,' and\r\n  because neither appellant nor her counsel were there to represent her interests,\r\n  &quot;the Board could not have properly considered the evidence.&quot;  This\r\n  conclusion ignores the circuit court judge's finding that, based upon these\r\n  same minutes, &quot;a report and recommendation were presented . . . .&quot; \r\n  We may not overturn this factual finding which is supported by substantial\r\n  evidence in the record.  E.g., Risher v. South Carolina Dep't of\r\n    Health and Enviro. Control, 393 S.C. 198, 712 S.E.2d 428 (2011) (scope of\r\n  review in APA appeals).  \r\nThe majority\r\n  further finds that the Board's written order stating its decision was made\r\n  &quot;[a]fter considering the evidence presented and the arguments of counsel .\r\n  . . . is a disingenuous representation of the procedure that actually took\r\n  place.&quot;  (emphasis removed).  Unlike the majority, I have no special insight\r\n  into what the Board considered during its executive session when it received\r\n  the hearing committee's report, but would take it at its word that it\r\n  considered both the evidence and the legal arguments.  \r\nAppellant was\r\n  afforded procedural due process at her evidentiary hearing.  The Board\r\n  represents it considered the evidence and arguments during its executive\r\n  session, at a meeting for which proper public notice was given,[8] and I, like the circuit court, accept their statement as true.  See Felder\r\n    v. Charleston Cty. School Dist., 327 S.C. 21, 489 S.E.2d 191 (1997)\r\n  (&quot;school board members are clothed with a presumption of honesty and\r\n  integrity in the discharge of their decision-making responsibilities&quot;).  I\r\n  would therefore affirm the circuit court order.\r\nKITTREDGE, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Appellant's indiscretions included throwing a chair\r\n  at a student, pulling a student's hair, leaving her class unsupervised during\r\n  which time a student was injured during a fight, and the consistently poor\r\n  standardized test scores of her students.\r\n[2] Eight of the nine Board members participated in the\r\n  July 7th meeting, with six of those members participating by phone.  One member\r\n  who was participating by phone left the meeting at 10:30 a.m. and did not\r\n  participate in the vote.  \r\n[3] At oral argument, Appellant's counsel read from\r\n  an e-mail sent by the Board's in-house counsel to Appellant, notifying her of\r\n  the meeting just fifteen minutes before the meeting took place.  \r\n[4] Appellant appealed the Board's grounds for dismissal\r\n  to the circuit court, claiming her dismissal was not supported by substantial\r\n  evidence in the Record.  The circuit court found there was substantial evidence\r\n  to support Appellant's dismissal.  Appellant has not appealed the propriety of\r\n  this portion of the circuit court's decision, and therefore, Appellant's\r\n  dismissal on substantive grounds is the law of the case. \r\n[5] In reciting this portion of Pettiford we make\r\n  no decision as to the legitimacy of the Board's delegation in this case.  Pettiford was decided over twenty years before the General\r\n  Assembly promulgated TEDA and addresses the invalidation of teaching certificates\r\n  rather than the dismissal of a teacher.\r\n[6] The hearing transcript was prepared two months later\r\n  on September 7 and 8, 2009.  \r\n[7] The dissent contends the circuit court judge's\r\n  finding that &quot;a report and recommendation were presented&quot; to a quorum\r\n  of the Board was supported by substantial evidence in the record.  Reviewing\r\n  the same minutes relied upon by the circuit court judge, we do not find\r\n  substantial evidence that Appellant's interests were represented before this\r\n  tribunal, as due process requires.\r\n[8] S.C. Code Ann. § 30-4-80 (2007).  I am unaware\r\n  of any special notice requirements applicable to appellant or her attorney.\r\n\r\n","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27112","title":"Fairchild v.

App. 2009).  The Court of Appeals affirmed in\r\n  part, reversed in part, and remanded for a new trial a negligence action\r\n  arising from a motor vehicle accident.  In relevant part, the Court of Appeals determined (1) Marilee\r\n  Fairchild's claim for punitive damages should have been submitted to the jury,\r\n  (2)&nbsp;the trial court should have charged the jury on the intervening\r\n  negligence of a treating physician, and (3) the trial court did not abuse its\r\n  discretion in denying William Leslie Palmer's motion under Rule 35, SCRCP for\r\n  an independent medical examination (IME) to be performed by Dr. James\r\n  Ballenger.  We affirm.\r\nI.  FACTS\r\nThis action arises out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred\r\n  on March 1, 2001 while several vehicles were traveling south on Interstate 95\r\n  in South Carolina.  \r\nJust before the accident, James Rabb, an employee with the South\r\n  Carolina Department of Transportation (SCDOT), was driving a dump truck with an\r\n  attached trailer transporting a backhoe.  Rabb was traveling in the left lane\r\n  of the southbound traffic (closest to the median) when he pulled in to a paved\r\n  &quot;cross-over&quot; in the median so he could turn around and enter the\r\n  northbound lanes of I-95.  While Rabb was stopped waiting for the northbound\r\n  traffic to clear, the back of his trailer allegedly protruded into the left\r\n  traffic lane on the southbound side.  \r\n Several\r\n  cars traveling south in the left lane directly behind Rabb saw Rabb's trailer\r\n  and simultaneously switched to the right lane.  When those cars moved over,\r\n  Marilee Fairchild, who was behind them driving a minivan, saw Rabb's trailer partially\r\n  blocking the left lane where she was traveling.  Fairchild &quot;flashed&quot;\r\n  her brakes and then continued to brake while staying ahead of the vehicle behind\r\n  her.  Fairchild managed to avoid Rabb's trailer, but she was struck by a truck\r\n  traveling behind her that was driven by William Leslie Palmer.  \r\n Palmer,\r\n  whose truck also had an attached trailer (which contained a motorcycle), hit\r\n  his brakes and swerved to the right when he came upon Fairchild.  However,\r\n  Palmer struck Fairchild's minivan, and the force of the impact with Palmer's\r\n  large vehicle caused Fairchild's minivan to flip over and roll before landing\r\n  in the median.  Rabb's truck was not hit in the accident.  \r\n On\r\n  February 26, 2003, Fairchild[1] brought this negligence action against SCDOT, Palmer, and Palmer Construction\r\n  Co., alleging she sustained physical injuries and property damage in the\r\n  accident.  She sought both actual and punitive damages.  Fairchild thereafter\r\n  entered into a covenant not to sue with SCDOT, and SCDOT was dismissed as a\r\n  party.  \r\n At trial,\r\n  the jury returned a verdict in favor of Fairchild for $720,000.  Both parties\r\n  appealed.  The Court of Appeals affirmed in part, reversed in part, and\r\n  remanded.  We thereafter granted Palmer's[2] petition for a writ of certiorari.  \r\nII.  LAW/ANALYSIS\r\nA.&nbsp; Punitive Damages\r\n Palmer first argues\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in holding the trial court should have submitted\r\n  Fairchild's claim of punitive damages to the jury based on its determination that\r\n  the evidence and its reasonable inferences created a factual question as to\r\n  whether he had acted recklessly.\r\nThe\r\n  trial court granted Palmer's motion for a directed verdict on Fairchild's claim\r\n  for punitive damages on the basis there was no evidence of reckless\r\n  conduct by Palmer.  However, the trial court did conclude that two statutes\r\n  governing traffic safety were implicated in this case and charged the jury on\r\n  the same.   The first, section 56-5-1520(A), provides general rules as to\r\n  maximum and safe speeds and states when lower speeds may be required: \r\n\r\nA person shall not drive a vehicle on a highway at a\r\n  speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions and having\r\n  regard to the actual and potential hazards then existing.  Speed must be so\r\n  controlled to avoid colliding with a person, vehicle, or other conveyance on or\r\n  entering the highway in compliance with legal requirements and the duty of a\r\n  person to use care.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 56-5-1520(A)\r\n  (2006).\r\n In addition, the\r\n  trial court charged the jury on section 56-5-1930(a), which prohibits following\r\n  too closely:\r\n The\r\n  driver of a motor vehicle shall not follow another vehicle more closely than is\r\n  reasonable and prudent, having due regard for the speed of such vehicles and\r\n  the traffic upon and the condition of the highway.\r\nId. § 56-5-1930(a).\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals found the grant of a directed verdict on the claim for\r\n  punitive damages was error as the evidence and its reasonable inferences created\r\n  a factual question as to whether Palmer had acted recklessly.  Fairchild,\r\n  385 S.C. at 353, 683 S.E.2d at 823.  The court agreed with Fairchild that,\r\n  based on Palmer's conduct, which included driving a large commercial truck[3] into heavy traffic just before the accident without any reduction in his rate\r\n  of speed, and his alleged statutory violations, the jury should have been\r\n  permitted to consider whether Palmer acted recklessly.  Id.   \r\nCiting\r\n  long-standing South Carolina precedent, the Court of Appeals held the violation\r\n  of a statute constitutes negligence per se, and negligence per se is some evidence\r\n  of recklessness and willfulness that requires submission of the issue of\r\n  punitive damages to the jury.  Id. at 354, 683 S.E.2d at 823.  The Court\r\n  of Appeals cited this Court's decision in Wise v. Broadway, 315 S.C.\r\n  273, 433 S.E.2d 857 (1993) as well as additional authorities to this effect:\r\n\r\nWise\r\n  v. Broadway, 315 S.C. 273, 276, 433\r\n  S.E.2d 857, 859 (1993) (&quot;The causative violation of a statute constitutes\r\n  negligence per se and is evidence of recklessness and willfulness, requiring\r\n  the submission of the issue of punitive damages to the jury.&quot;); Rhodes\r\n    v. Lawrence, 279 S.C. 96, 97-98, 302 S.E.2d 343, 344 (1983) (&quot;In these\r\n  circumstances, a jury question as to punitive damages was clearly presented\r\n  given the well settled rule that a showing of statutory violation can be\r\n  evidence of recklessness and willfulness.&quot;); Austin v. Specialty\r\n    Transp. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 314, 594 S.E.2d 867, 875 (Ct. App.\r\n  2004) (&quot;A factual question as to punitive damages is presented when there\r\n  is evidence of a statutory violation.&quot;). \r\n\r\nId.   The\r\n  Court of Appeals noted &quot;[t]hese cases limit their holdings to creating a\r\n  jury question only and not recklessness per se.&quot;  Id.  The court referenced\r\n  the express limitation pronounced by this Court in Wise:   \r\n\r\nViolation of a statute does not constitute\r\n  recklessness, willfulness, and wantonness per se, but is some evidence\r\n  that the defendant acted recklessly, willfully, and wantonly.  It is always for\r\n  the jury to determine whether a party has been reckless, willful, and wanton. \r\n  However, it is not obligatory as a matter of\r\n  law for the jury to make such a finding in every case of a statutory violation.\r\n\r\nId. at 354, 683 S.E.2d at 823-24 (quoting Wise,\r\n  315 S.C. at 276-77, 433 S.E.2d at 859 (internal citations omitted)).  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals concluded that there was evidence Palmer was negligent per se\r\n  in causing the accident, which consisted of following another vehicle too\r\n  closely and speeding; consequently, a jury could have found Palmer violated\r\n  sections 56-5-1930(a) and 56-5-1520(A), and the finding of a statutory\r\n  violation may be considered by the jury as evidence of recklessness.  Id. at 357, 683 S.E.2d at 825.  As a result, the court reversed the grant of a\r\n  directed verdict on punitive damages and remanded for a new trial.  Id.\r\nOn\r\n  appeal to this Court, Palmer asserts this was error, and that &quot;evidence of\r\n  a statutory violation alone, without more, is generally insufficient to send\r\n  the issue of punitive damages to the jury.&quot;  He contends the two statutes at\r\n  issue codify the common law standards for\r\n  safe speeds and following distances, and they do not establish bright-line\r\n  standards; therefore, they should not form the basis for an award of punitive\r\n  damages without other supporting evidence.  \r\nIn\r\n  reviewing a ruling on a motion for a directed verdict, this Court must view the\r\n  evidence and all reasonable inferences from the evidence in the light most\r\n  favorable to the party opposing the motion.  Weir v. Citicorp Nat'l Servs., Inc., 312 S.C. 511, 435 S.E.2d 864 (1993).  A case should be submitted to\r\n  the jury when the evidence is susceptible of more than one reasonable\r\n  inference.  Unlimited Servs., Inc. v. Macklen Enters., Inc., 303 S.C.\r\n  384, 401 S.E.2d 153 (1991).   It is not\r\n  the duty of the trial court to weigh the testimony in ruling on a motion for a\r\n  directed verdict.  Young v. Bost, 241 S.C. 289, 128 S.E.2d 118 (1962).\r\nPunitive damages are recoverable where there is evidence the\r\n  defendant's conduct was reckless, willful, or wanton.  Cartee v. Lesley,\r\n  290 S.C. 333, 350 S.E.2d 388 (1986).  Recklessness is the doing of a negligent\r\n  act knowingly; it is a conscious failure to exercise due care, and the element\r\n  distinguishing actionable negligence from a willful tort is inadvertence.  Berberich\r\n    v. Jack, 392 S.C. 278, 287, 709 S.E.2d 607, 612 (2011).  The terms\r\n  &quot;willful&quot; and &quot;wanton&quot; when pled in a negligence action are\r\n  synonymous with &quot;reckless&quot; and import a greater degree of culpability\r\n  than mere negligence.  Id. at 288, 709 S.E.2d at 612.  &quot;Evidence that\r\n  the defendant's conduct breached this higher standard entitles the plaintiff to\r\n  a charge on punitive damages.&quot;  Id. (quoting Marcum v. Bowden,\r\n  372 S.C. 452, 458 n.5, 643 S.E.2d 85, 88 n.5 (2007)); see also S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 15-33-135 (2005) (&quot;In any civil action where punitive damages are\r\n  claimed, the plaintiff has the burden of proving such damages by clear and\r\n  convincing evidence.&quot;). \r\n&quot;Ordinarily, the test is whether the tort has been committed\r\n  in such a manner or under circumstances that a person of ordinary reason or\r\n  prudence would have been conscious of it as an invasion of the plaintiff's\r\n  rights.&quot;  Cartee, 290 S.C. at 337, 350 S.E.2d at 390.  &quot;The\r\n  test may also be satisfied by evidence of the causative violation of an\r\n  applicable statute.&quot;  Id.  &quot;However, before punitive damages\r\n  may be submitted to the jury, there must be evidence the statutory violation\r\n  proximately contributed to the injury.&quot;  Id.  &quot;Ordinarily,\r\n  whether or not the statutory violation contributed as a proximate cause to the\r\n  injury is a question for the jury.&quot;  Id.  \r\n&quot;There must be some inference of a causal link between the\r\n  statutory violation and the injury to warrant submitting the issue of punitive\r\n  damages to the jury.&quot;  Id. at 337-38, 350 S.E.2d at 390.  For\r\n  example, in Cartee the Court noted that if, in a case by beneficiaries\r\n  against trustees for mismanaging assets, the trustees had been guilty of\r\n  driving without their driver's licenses, they would have been guilty of\r\n  violating a statute; however, that violation could have nothing to do with the injuries\r\n  claimed by beneficiaries and would not justify a charge on punitive damages\r\n  because &quot;[s]ome inference of causation must be shown.&quot;  Id. at\r\n  338 n.3, 350 S.E.2d at 390 n.3; see also Austin v. Specialty Trans. Servs., Inc., 358 S.C. 298, 594 S.E.2d 867 (Ct. App. 2004)\r\n  (stating the causative violation of a statute constitutes negligence per se and\r\n  is evidence of recklessness and willfulness, requiring submission of the issue\r\n  of punitive damages to the jury).\r\nIn Copeland\r\n  v. Nabors, 285 S.C. 340, 329 S.E.2d 457 (Ct. App. 1985), the Court of\r\n  Appeals found the record contained evidence from which the jury could have\r\n  inferred that Nabors violated one or more statutes relating to maximum speed\r\n  limits and to overtaking and passing vehicles proceeding in the same direction\r\n  and that Nabors thereby engaged in conduct warranting an award of punitive\r\n  damages.  Likewise, in Field v. Gregory, 230 S.C. 39, 94 S.E.2d 15\r\n  (1956), this Court found evidence of the violation of at least three applicable\r\n  traffic statutes, which resulted in a traffic collision, warranted the submission\r\n  of punitive damages to the jury.  We stated, &quot;The violation of an\r\n  applicable statute is negligence per se, and whether or not such breach\r\n  contributed as a proximate cause to [the] plaintiff's injury is ordinarily a\r\n  question for the jury.&quot;  Id. at 44, 94 S.E.2d at 18 (citation\r\n  omitted).  We observed that &quot;[c]ausative violation of an applicable\r\n  statute constitutes actionable negligence and is evidence of recklessness,\r\n  willfulness and wantonness.&quot;  Id. at 46, 94 S.E.2d at 19 (citing Morrow\r\n    v. Evans, 223 S.C. 288, 295, 75 S.E.2d 598, 601 (1953)); accord Padgett\r\n      v. Colonial Wholesale Dist. Co., 232 S.C. 593, 103 S.E.2d 265 (1958); Vernon\r\n        v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 221 S.C. 376, 70 S.E.2d 862 (1952); Ralls\r\n          v. Saleeby, 178 S.C. 431, 182 S.E. 750 (1935); Lumpkin v. Mankin,\r\n  136 S.C. 506, 134 S.E. 503 (1926). \r\nIn Daniels\r\n  v. Bernard, 270 S.C. 51, 240 S.E.2d 518 (1978), this Court held that\r\n  testimony that a witness saw two vehicles traveling north on Highway 52, that\r\n  Bernard's vehicle was trailing the vehicle driven by Daniels and gaining on\r\n  Daniels's vehicle, and that the Bernard automobile rammed into the rear of\r\n  Daniels's vehicle was evidence from which the jury could have reasonably\r\n  inferred that Bernard was following too closely and was failing to maintain a\r\n  proper lookout.  Id. at 55, 240 S.E.2d at 519-20.  The Court noted\r\n  following too closely was a violation of section 56-5-1930 and &quot;the\r\n  violation of a statute is negligence per se and is evidence of recklessness and\r\n  willfulness, requiring the submission of the issue of punitive damages to the\r\n  jury.&quot;  Id. at 55, 240 S.E.2d at 520 (citing Jarvis v. Green,\r\n  257 S.C. 558, 186 S.E.2d 765 (1972) and Still v. Blake, 255 S.C. 95, 177\r\n  S.E.2d 469 (1970)).  The Daniels Court concluded the trial court erred\r\n  in holding there was no evidence of recklessness to sustain an award for\r\n  punitive damages.  Id. at 56, 240 S.E.2d at 520.\r\n Similarly, in the\r\n  current appeal, we find the trial court\r\n  erred in granting a directed verdict on the issue of punitive damages.  It is\r\n  not the duty of a trial court to weigh the evidence.  Viewing the evidence and\r\n  its reasonable inferences in the light most favorable to Fairchild, as both the\r\n  trial court and this Court are required to do, we hold there is evidence to\r\n  create a jury question as to whether or not Palmer acted with recklessness, thus\r\n  requiring submission of the issue of punitive damages to the jury.  \r\nPalmer\r\n  was driving a commercial-sized truck, towing a 28-foot trailer, and hauling a\r\n  motorcycle, and his combined weight exceeded eight and one-half tons.  Palmer\r\n  knew he was approaching an area of merging traffic and possible congestion on\r\n  I-95 near several rest areas, and he acknowledged that it was an area\r\n  &quot;where a lot of accidents happen.&quot;  Palmer further described the\r\n  traffic around his truck prior to the collision as &quot;typical crazy\r\n  interstate 95 traffic, you know, everybody running together.&quot;  He also was\r\n  aware of the potential that traffic could slow down to a crawl due to a wreck\r\n  or other conditions, and he knew of the need to maintain a safe stopping\r\n  distance for such a large vehicle.\r\n Palmer acknowledged\r\n  that he maintained a &quot;pretty steady speed&quot; of 65 to 70 miles per hour\r\n  to avoid &quot;giving distance&quot; that would let other vehicles cross into\r\n  his lane ahead of him.  He also stated he was &quot;maybe a hundred feet or\r\n  more&quot; behind Fairchild when she first applied her brakes.  Palmer\r\n  maintained he did not even notice Fairchild until right before the impact.  \r\nWe\r\n  further agree with the Court of Appeals that there is evidence that Palmer\r\n  might have violated section 56-5-1520(A) (circumstances requiring a reduction\r\n  in speed) and section 56-5-1930(a) (following too closely), and there is an\r\n  inference that the violations of these statutes were the proximate cause of the\r\n  accident.  Therefore, Fairchild's claim for punitive damages should have been\r\n  submitted to the jury.  \r\n Moreover, even\r\n  where the trial court has submitted the issue of punitive damages to a jury, the\r\n  defendant still has an opportunity to challenge the propriety of any resulting punitive\r\n  damages award.  The trial court has the authority to review the punitive\r\n  damages award and if the court finds the award is inappropriate or excessive,\r\n  it has the discretion to order a new trial or remittitur.  See generally Mitchell\r\n    v. Fortis Ins. Co., 385 S.C. 570, 686 S.E.2d 176 (2009) (stating a\r\n  reviewing court should consider the following set of factors in conducting a\r\n  post-judgment review of an award of punitive damages:  (1) the degree of\r\n  reprehensibility of the defendant's conduct, (2)&nbsp;the disparity between the\r\n  actual or potential harm suffered by the plaintiff and the amount of the\r\n  punitive damages award, and (3) the difference between the punitive damages\r\n  awarded by the jury and the civil penalties authorized or imposed in comparable\r\n  cases). \r\nB.&nbsp; Intervening Negligence of Third Party  \r\n Palmer next contends the Court of Appeals erred in determining\r\n  the trial court should have charged the jury on the intervening negligence of a\r\n  third party.\r\nFairchild\r\n  submitted three proposed instructions (Plaintiff's Requests to Charge #11, #12,\r\n  &amp; #13) regarding intervening negligence, which included several variations\r\n  on the following principles:\r\n\r\nThe intervening negligence of a third party will not\r\n  excuse the original wrongdoer if such intervention ought to have been foreseen\r\n  in the exercise of due care.  \r\nIt is the law in South Carolina that the negligence of\r\n  a treating doctor is reasonably foreseeable.  It is the general rule that if an\r\n  injured person uses ordinary care in selecting a physician for treatment of his\r\n  injury, the law regards the aggravation of the injury resulting from the\r\n  negligent act of the doctor as part of the immediate and direct damages which naturally\r\n  flow from the original injury.  \r\n\r\nThe\r\n  trial court declined to give the requested instructions on the basis there was\r\n  no evidence of negligent treatment by an attending physician.  \r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals held this was error, noting that during the trial Palmer had\r\n  stressed the side effects of the drugs prescribed for Fairchild during\r\n  treatment for her injuries and had suggested that she was overmedicated.  Fairchild,\r\n  385 S.C. at 352, 683 S.E.2d at 822.  Palmer had implied that the\r\n  overmedication, rather than his own negligence, was the source of many of\r\n  Fairchild's ailments.  Id.  The Court of Appeals additionally noted\r\n  that, to support this theory, &quot;Palmer called and questioned several\r\n  doctors and nurses to discuss Fairchild's course of treatment.&quot;  Id. \r\n  The Court of Appeals found that &quot;[t]he following statement by [Palmer's]\r\n  counsel made during closing arguments, in particular, was convincing that the\r\n  charges were relevant:  'So ask yourself, is it the chronic post-traumatic\r\n  headache that is the disabling headache, or is it the medication over-use that\r\n  is the disabling headache?'&#8202;&quot;  Id. at 352, 683 S.E.2d at\r\n  822-23.  The court concluded it was error to refuse to give the requested\r\n  instruction and further found that, &quot;given the jury's verdict and the amount\r\n  of damages at issue,&quot; the ruling could have impacted the jury's verdict,\r\n  resulting in prejudice.  Id. at 352, 683 S.E.2d at 823. \r\n Palmer acknowledges\r\n  that the proposed charges correctly state the current law in South Carolina,[4] but maintains\r\n  there were no references made at trial to a negligent act or omission by a treating\r\n  physician.  Palmer also states that he did not seek a charge on whether the\r\n  intervening negligence of a third party severed the causal connection between\r\n  Palmer's negligence and Fairchild's injury, and this is an affirmative defense,\r\n  citing Small v. Pioneer Machinery, Inc., 316 S.C. 479, 450 S.E.2d 609\r\n  (Ct. App. 1994) (holding the defense of a third-party's intervening acts of\r\n  negligence does not break the causal chain if the acts are foreseeable).    \r\n &quot;Ordinarily, a trial judge has a duty to give a\r\n  requested instruction that correctly states the law applicable to the issues\r\n  and evidence.&quot;  Ross v. Paddy, 340 S.C. 428, 437, 532 S.E.2d 612,\r\n  617&nbsp;(Ct. App. 2000).  &quot;Where a request to charge is timely made and\r\n  involves a controlling legal principle, a refusal by the trial judge to charge\r\n  the request constitutes reversible error.&quot;  Id.  &quot;Moreover,\r\n  when general instructions to the jury are insufficient to enable the jury to\r\n  understand fully the law of the case and issues involved, a refusal to give a\r\n  requested charge is reversible error.&quot;  Id.\r\n It is the court's duty to instruct the jury on the\r\n  law, and &quot;[t]he jury ought not to be left to cut a way through the woods\r\n  with no compass to guide it.&quot;  Collins-Plass Thayer Co. v. Hewlett,\r\n  109 S.C. 245, 253-54, 95 S.E. 510, 513 (1918), cited in Eaddy v.\r\n    Jackson Beauty Supply Co., 244 S.C. 256, 259, 136 S.E.2d 297, 298 (1964).\r\n To warrant\r\n  reversal, the refusal to give a requested jury charge must be both erroneous\r\n  and prejudicial.[5]  Cole v.

App. 1985).\r\nWe\r\n  find the charge requested by Fairchild was necessary to allow the jury to\r\n  properly evaluate proximate cause and resulting damages, and its omission\r\n  resulted in prejudice to Fairchild.  There was an abundance of testimony\r\n  elicited by Palmer on the allegation that overmedication by Fairchild's\r\n  physicians was a possible cause of many of Fairchild's ailments.  Palmer's\r\n  message throughout the trial was that he should not be held responsible for any\r\n  resulting symptoms in Fairchild that might have been caused by or exacerbated by\r\n  overmedication or the treatment of Fairchild's physicians.  \r\n For example, Palmer\r\n  called Dr. James Ballenger, a psychiatrist, as an expert witness for the\r\n  defense.  Dr. Ballenger testified &quot;that the most likely reason [Fairchild's]\r\n  headaches got so much worse from '02 to at least '05 or maybe into '06, was\r\n  that . . . a decision was made to go into big-time medications. \r\n  Oxycontin was the first one.&quot;  (Emphasis added.)  He opined that\r\n  Fairchild's difficulties were likely linked to &quot;rebound headache syndrome\r\n  . . . meaning you have the headache; you take very strong medicines; it goes\r\n  away, it comes out of your system, and you get a headache ultimately caused by\r\n  taking the medicine.&quot;  Although Palmer also states there was testimony\r\n  that the overmedication could also be based on Fairchild's own conduct, the\r\n  implication here clearly was that a treating physician made the decision\r\n  &quot;to go into big-time medications&quot; and that this was not the best\r\n  course of treatment.  Palmer also called Dr. Robert Richey, an internist who\r\n  had treated Fairchild.  Dr. Richey asserted Fairchild &quot;was on a cornucopia\r\n  of medicine,&quot; and he expressed reservations about several drugs, including\r\n  Sulfasalazine and Indocin, prescribed by Fairchild's other physicians and he detailed\r\n  the potential side effects from these drugs.\r\nFurther,\r\n  in cross-examining Fairchild's witnesses, Palmer repeatedly questioned the type\r\n  of medical treatment she had received and whether she had suffered adverse\r\n  effects, such as increased pain and medical &quot;intoxication,&quot; from the\r\n  prescribed treatment.  The clear purpose of Palmer's repeated line of\r\n  questioning in this regard was to reduce the assessment of damages by distinguishing\r\n  any harm he believed was caused by Fairchild's medical treatment and alleged\r\n  overmedication from any harm he allegedly caused in the motor vehicle collision. \r\nUnder\r\n  these particular circumstances, where Fairchild's treatment and medical\r\n  condition were the focus of so much of the testimony, the charge should have\r\n  been given to avoid confusion for the jury and to aid it in properly evaluating\r\n  proximate cause and damages.  We agree with the Court of Appeals that the\r\n  failure to give the requested charge was error warranting reversal.  See,\r\n    e.g., Eaddy, 244 S.C. at 259, 136 S.E.2d at 298 (concluding where\r\n  the request to charge was of a controlling principle of law and was timely\r\n  made, the refusal of the charge was error requiring reversal and a new trial).  \r\nC.&nbsp; Palmer's Motion\r\n  for an IME by Dr. James Ballenger    \r\nPalmer\r\n  next contends the Court of Appeals erred in holding the trial court did not\r\n  abuse its discretion in denying his motion for an IME to be performed by Dr.\r\n  James C. Ballenger.  \r\nPalmer\r\n  filed a pretrial motion, pursuant to Rule 35 of the South Carolina Rules of\r\n  Civil Procedure, for an IME to be performed on Fairchild by Dr. Ballenger.  Dr.\r\n  Ballenger is a psychiatrist who had been retained by Palmer as an expert\r\n  witness regarding Fairchild's alleged injuries. \r\nFairchild\r\n  did not oppose an IME, but objected to Dr.&nbsp;Ballenger being designated the\r\n  examining physician because he had a pre-existing relationship with Palmer. \r\n  Specifically, Fairchild asserted the following:  (1)&nbsp;some four months\r\n  earlier, Palmer had named Dr. Ballenger as an expert witness for the defense\r\n  and had paid him a retainer; (2) Dr. Ballenger had already examined some of\r\n  Fairchild's medical records that were sent to him by Palmer; (3) Dr. Ballenger\r\n  had already formed opinions about her condition prior to an IME; (4) Dr.\r\n  Ballenger was expected to testify as a defense witness at trial; and (5) Dr.\r\n  Ballenger had been referred to Palmer by another expert who had also been\r\n  retained by Palmer to question the extent of Fairchild's injuries.  \r\n The trial court denied\r\n  Palmer's motion to have Dr. Ballenger perform an IME.  The trial court found Dr.\r\n  Ballenger's prior work on Fairchild's case as a retained expert for the defense\r\n  and the fact that Palmer had sent Dr. Ballenger not only Fairchild's medical\r\n  records, but also the transcripts of depositions of some of Fairchild's\r\n  treating physicians in advance of his request for an IME, formed the basis for a\r\n  reasonable objection to the appointment of Dr. Ballenger.  The trial court further\r\n  stated that, upon being instructed to submit a list of alternative physicians\r\n  for the court to consider for the IME, Palmer had informed the court that he\r\n  was unwilling to pay for an examination to be made by any physician other than\r\n  Dr. Ballenger.  The trial court concluded that, &quot;given this election by [Palmer],\r\n  [it was] left with no alternative other than to deny the motion.&quot; \r\n The Court of\r\n  Appeals determined the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying\r\n  Palmer's motion to have Dr. Ballenger perform an IME on Fairchild.  Fairchild,\r\n  385 S.C. at 360, 683 S.E.2d at 827.  Palmer argues this was error, as Fairchild\r\n  did not assert a &quot;reasonable objection&quot; under Rule 35(a), SCRCP to\r\n  the appointment of Dr. Ballenger.  Palmer contends a physician's prior\r\n  relationship with the defendant and his or her familiarity with the case should\r\n  not preclude the physician from being selected by the defendant to perform the examination.[6]  Both parties\r\n  have observed that there are no South Carolina decisions specifically\r\n  addressing the provision for a &quot;reasonable objection&quot; under Rule 35(a),\r\n  SCRCP.\r\n&quot;In\r\n  interpreting the meaning of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure, the\r\n  Court applies the same rules of construction used to interpret statutes.&quot;  Maxwell v. Genez, 356 S.C. 617, 620, 591 S.E.2d 26, 27&nbsp;(2003).  &quot;If\r\n  a rule's language is plain, unambiguous, and conveys a clear meaning,\r\n  interpretation is unnecessary and the stated meaning should be enforced.&quot;  Id.; see also Stark Truss Co. v. Superior Constr. Corp., 360 S.C.\r\n  503, 508, 602 S.E.2d 99, 102 (Ct. App. 2004) (stating where the language of a\r\n  court rule is clear and unambiguous, the court is obligated to follow its plain\r\n  and ordinary meaning without resort to forced construction to limit or expand\r\n  the rule); cf. Muci v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 732\r\n  N.W.2d 88, 93 (Mich. 2007) (&quot;The interpretation of court rules and\r\n  statutes presents an issue of law that is reviewed de novo.&quot;).\r\nA\r\n  trial court's rulings in matters related to discovery generally will not be\r\n  disturbed on appeal in the absence of a clear abuse of discretion.  Dunn v.\r\n    Dunn, 298 S.C. 499, 381 S.E.2d 734 (1989); Creighton v. Coligny Plaza\r\n      Ltd. P'ship, 334 S.C. 96, 512 S.E.2d 510 (Ct. App. 1998).  An abuse of discretion occurs when the trial court's\r\n  order is controlled by an error of law or when there is no evidentiary support\r\n  for the trial court's factual conclusions.  Sundown Operating Co. v. Intedge\r\n    Indus., Inc., 383 S.C. 601, 681 S.E.2d 885 (2009).\r\nRule\r\n  35 of the South Carolina Rules of Civil Procedure governs requests for physical\r\n  and mental examinations and provides in relevant part as follows:\r\n\r\nIn any case in which the amount in controversy exceeds\r\n  $100,000 actual damages, and the mental or physical condition (including the\r\n  blood group) of a party, or of a person in the custody or under the legal\r\n  control of a party, is in controversy, the court in which the action is pending\r\n  may order the party to submit to a physical or mental examination by a\r\n  physician or to produce for examination the person in his custody or legal\r\n  control.  The order may be made only on motion for good cause shown . .\r\n  .&nbsp;.\r\nThe physician of the party to be examined\r\n  may be present at the examination.  Unless the parties agree, or the court for\r\n  good cause shown determines otherwise, the examination shall be in the county\r\n  where the person to be examined, or his physician, resides.  . . .  Upon reasonable\r\n    objection to the physician designated to make the examination, and if the\r\n  parties shall fail to agree as to who shall make the examination, the court may\r\n  designate a physician; but the fact that a physician was so designated shall\r\n  not be admissible upon the trial.\r\n\r\nRule 35(a), SCRCP (emphasis\r\n  added).  The official Notes to Rule 35(a), SCRCP observe that the first\r\n  paragraph of Rule 35(a) is based on the Federal Rule on this subject, but the\r\n  second paragraph is not included in the Federal Rule.  The second paragraph was\r\n  specifically added by this Court to establish limits on the use of this\r\n  procedure.[7]  \r\n Under the plain language of Rule 35(a), the defendant\r\n  clearly does not have the right to unilaterally select the examining physician;\r\n  rather, the court alone has the right to make the appointment.  The rule\r\n  contemplates that the parties will confer on this point to make suggestions,\r\n  but where a &quot;reasonable objection&quot; has been interposed and the\r\n  parties cannot agree, the court will make the selection.  See Rule\r\n  35(a), SCRCP (providing upon reasonable objection and &quot;if the parties\r\n  shall fail to agree as to who shall make the examination, the court may\r\n  designate a physician&quot;); see also Rule 11(a), SCRCP (stating\r\n  motions should generally contain an affirmation that the movant's counsel\r\n  communicated with opposing counsel prior to filing the motion to make a good\r\n  faith effort to resolve the matter).  \r\nA\r\n  &quot;reasonable objection&quot; in this context simply means the reason for\r\n  the objection must not be frivolous.  What is reasonable will depend on the\r\n  individual facts and circumstances of the case, which is precisely why the\r\n  determination of this matter, as in other discovery and evidentiary disputes,\r\n  is best left to the sound discretion of the trial court.  See generally LeBlanc\r\n    v. Cambo, 223 A.2d 311 (Conn. C.P. 1966) (observing what is a reasonable\r\n  objection to a particular physician named to perform a physical examination is\r\n  a matter that must of necessity be left to the trial court's inherent discretion). \r\nThe\r\n  purpose of the rule for an IME is to materially aid the jury, not just the\r\n  defendant, in evaluating the actual damages sustained and arriving at a just\r\n  verdict.  This purpose was recognized long before South Carolina law permitted\r\n  such examinations.  See Best v. Columbia Elec. St. Ry., Light &amp;\r\n    Power Co., 85 S.C. 422, 428, 67 S.E.1, 3 (1910) (Woods, J., dissenting) (stating\r\n  nothing can be more helpful to the jury in reaching a just estimate of the\r\n  damages in a personal injury suit than knowledge of the true nature of the\r\n  injury, and whenever it appears to the circuit court that an examination by\r\n  impartial experts would materially aid the jury, the circuit court should order\r\n  such examination to be made by disinterested experts).  Thus, the better rule is that the physician should not be\r\n  affiliated with either party in order to serve the purposes of Rule 35. \r\nIn Richardson v. Johnson, 444 S.W.2d 708, 710 (Tenn. Ct.\r\n  App. 1969), the Tennessee court, echoing these sentiments, listed a series of\r\n  guidelines regarding court-ordered physical examinations, including, &quot;The\r\n  physician must be selected by the court, not the defendant, and must be competent\r\n  and disinterested.&quot;  The court stated &quot;it is clear that the power so vested in the court is a\r\n  discretionary power, and not an absolute right in the applicant, and that the\r\n  physician or physicians so appointed act as officers of the court, and not as agents\r\n  of either party.&quot;  Id. at 712.  The court further observed that where claims concern injuries or\r\n  disabilities that are based upon the subjective complaints of the plaintiff,\r\n  &quot;an impartial physician may have objective means of testing the\r\n  subjective claims of the plaintiff[.]&quot;  Id. As is further explained\r\n  in a case from a Missouri court:\r\n\r\nThe law invests the trial court with authority to\r\n  appoint physicians to make [a] physical examination of the plaintiff in a\r\n  physical injury suit.  The defendant cannot demand it as a matter of right, but\r\n  the court in its discretion may do it in the furtherance of justice.  When the\r\n  court makes such an appointment, [it] does so because [it] determines in [its]\r\n  discretion that the case calls for the opinion of disinterested and unbiased\r\n    physicians, not friends of either parties, whose testimony is likely to be\r\n  biased.\r\n\r\n\r\nAtkinson v.\r\n  United Rys. Co., 228 S.W.\r\n  483, 485 (Mo. 1921) (emphasis added) (internal citations omitted).  The\r\n  Missouri court also recognized that a &quot;court could not compel [a]\r\n  plaintiff to submit to [a physical] examination by the witnesses for the other\r\n  side,&quot; and &quot;[t]he physicians appointed in such cases are the officers\r\n  of the court.&quot;  Id.\r\nIn\r\n  the current appeal, the finding of the trial court that Fairchild had\r\n  interposed a reasonable objection to Dr. Ballard's designation as the examining\r\n  physician was a proper exercise of the trial court's inherent discretion to\r\n  rule on discovery matters and is amply supported by the record.  Dr. Ballenger\r\n  was retained as a defense witness and had reviewed not only Fairchild's medical\r\n  records, but also the deposition testimony of other potential witnesses, and it\r\n  was alleged that he had already formed adverse opinions regarding Fairchild's injuries\r\n  before the IME was requested.[8] \r\n  Under the circumstances present here, we agree with the Court of Appeals that Palmer\r\n  has shown no abuse of discretion in this regard.\r\nIV.&nbsp; CONCLUSION\r\n We affirm the\r\n  decision of the Court of Appeals, which found reversible error in the trial\r\n  court's failure to submit the issue of punitive damages to the jury and to\r\n  charge the jury on the intervening negligence of a treating physician, and\r\n  found the trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying Palmer's motion\r\n  for an IME to be performed by Dr. Ballenger.\r\nAFFIRMED.\r\n TOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE, JJ., and Acting Justice James E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] \r\n  Fairchild's husband was also a plaintiff, but he is not a party to this appeal.\r\n[2]\r\n  &quot;Palmer&quot; shall also include his construction company, where\r\n  applicable.\r\n[3]  Palmer's truck weighed 13,740 pounds, the trailer\r\n  weighed 2,760 pounds, and the motorcycle he was transporting was 655.6 pounds.  \r\n[4]  See, e.g., Graham v. Whitaker, 282 S.C. 393, 321 S.E.2d 40 (1984); Young\r\n  v. Tide Craft, Inc., 270 S.C. 453, 242 S.E.2d 671 (1978).\r\n[5] \r\n  The Court of Appeals correctly cited this standard in its opinion.  However, Palmer\r\n  takes issue with one case the court cited, Wells v. Halyard, 341 S.C.\r\n  234, 237, 533 S.E.2d 341, 343 (Ct. App. 2000), which states:  &quot;An alleged\r\n  error is harmless if the appellate court determines beyond a reasonable doubt\r\n  that the alleged error did not contribute to the verdict.&quot;  Palmer\r\n  contends the &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; reference is a criminal\r\n  standard that is not applicable in this civil case.  We agree, but find the citation\r\n  to Wells did not affect the propriety of the conclusion reached by the\r\n  Court of Appeals in Fairchild.\r\n[6] \r\n  Palmer cites, e.g., Timpte v. District Court, 421 P.2d 728, 729 (Colo.\r\n  1966) (&quot;So long as a plaintiff may select his own doctor to testify as to\r\n  his physical condition, fundamental fairness dictates that a defendant shall\r\n  have the same right, in the absence of an agreement by the parties as to who the\r\n  examining physician will be.&quot;).  The Timpte case applying Colorado state\r\n  court rules, as well as other authority cited by Palmer applying Rule 35 of the\r\n  Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, are inapposite because those rules do not\r\n  contain the same provision present in Rule 35(a), SCRCP.  Further, we do not\r\n  agree that a plaintiff chooses his or her own physician.  See John E.\r\n  Parker &amp; Jack L. Nettles, Automobile and Truck Accidents, in 1 The South Carolina Practice Manual 199 (William Howard, Sr. &amp; E.&nbsp;Warren\r\n  Moise eds., 2000) (noting the plaintiff usually did not choose his or her\r\n  physician; instead, treatment was provided by the physician on call at the\r\n  hospital or the person was referred to the physician by another physician).\r\n[7]  A somewhat similar procedure exists under workers'\r\n  compensation law, which allows the appointment of &quot;a disinterested and\r\n  duly qualified physician or surgeon&quot; to examine the injured claimant.  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. §&nbsp;42-17-30 (Supp. 2011). \r\n[8]  Fairchild notes that, immediately after the denial of the motion for an IME, Palmer\r\n  supplemented his discovery responses with a listing of adverse opinions regarding\r\n  Fairchild's injuries that Dr. Ballenger planned to testify to at trial.  Thus, Dr.\r\n  Ballenger must have already formed these adverse opinions prior to the time an\r\n  IME could have been scheduled.  Further, Dr. Ballenger did testify at trial as\r\n  a defense witness for Palmer in accordance with these adverse opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27113","title":"City of North Myrtle Beach v.

Battle, of Battle, Vaught &amp; Howe, of Conway,\r\n  for Respondents.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  Appellant\r\n  East Cherry Grove Realty Co., LLC, appeals from a jury verdict finding that the\r\n  State of South Carolina holds title to disputed canals in North Myrtle Beach. \r\n  The question was submitted to the jury on three theories: that two quitclaim\r\n  deeds established title in the canals; that the canals had been dedicated to\r\n  the public; and that the State of South Carolina holds title to the canals in\r\n  trust for the public.  The jury returned a verdict for the State on all three\r\n  theories.  Appellant argues that the trial court erred when it denied\r\n  Appellant’s motions for directed verdict on each theory.  We find that the question\r\n  of ownership under the quitclaim deeds was properly submitted to the jury and\r\n  therefore affirm.[1]\r\nFACTS\r\nIn 1961, the State of South Carolina (State) filed\r\n  suit against the predecessors in interest of East Cherry Grove Realty, LLC\r\n  (collectively, East Cherry Grove), seeking to establish its title to all tidal\r\n  lands in the East Cherry Grove area of North Myrtle Beach.  In 1963, a consent\r\n  order stipulated that certain property was not a subject of the suit and exempt\r\n  from a temporary injunction that prevented East Cherry Grove from selling any\r\n  property below the mean high-water mark.[2] The order provided in relevant part that\r\n\r\nSince this\r\n  action was filed[,] the title to certain property not intended by the [State]\r\n  to be included in this suit, has been questioned . . . . In order that the\r\n  title to this property (that above the unquestioned mean high water mark) could\r\n  be quieted a survey was made . . . .\r\nOrdered[,] that all the land lying between said . . .\r\n  “estimated line of Demarcation between upland and marsh land” . . . and the\r\n  Atlantic Ocean is hereby released and is declared not to be involved in nor\r\n  within the scope of the above entitled action as it is and was above the mean\r\n  high water mark of the adjacent tidal water prior to any alleged artificial\r\n  changing of the level of the land or of the waterway.   \r\n\r\nAfter a bench trial, the trial judge ruled in favor of\r\n  East Cherry Grove.  However, in 1969, while the case was on appeal to this\r\n  Court, the parties negotiated a settlement.  As part of the settlement, the\r\n  parties exchanged quitclaim deeds.  These deeds defined an “agreed-on mean high\r\n  water mark” by metes and bounds, which appeared as a bold line enclosing an\r\n  area of marshlands on the related plat.  The agreed mean high-water mark\r\n  referred to in these deeds is not coterminous with the “Estimated Line of\r\n  Demarcation” used in the 1963 order.  The deeds quitclaimed all of the land “below”\r\n  that mark, i.e., the land within the bold line (State’s Land), to the State and\r\n  all of the land “above” that mark, i.e., the land between the marshlands and\r\n  the oceanfront (East Cherry Grove’s Land), to East Cherry Grove.  The deed from\r\n  East Cherry Grove to the State contains additional language as follows:\r\n\r\nThat all areas lying below the\r\n  agreed mean high water mark on Northeast Canal, Nixon Canal, proposed Nixon\r\n  Canal Extension, Main Channel, Nye Cut and all other existing canals are\r\n  quit-claimed to the State of South Carolina, except that:  It is understood and\r\n  agreed that Nye Cut will remain open until Main Channel (“proposed relocation\r\n  of Creek”) between 25th Avenue and Nixon Canal has been cut, at which time C.\r\n  D. Nixon, et al, will have the right to build a bridge at either 22nd Avenue or\r\n  23rd Avenue across Main Channel, and close Nye Cut, all as shown on the said\r\n  plat; and title to land proposed to be closed will remain in C. D. Nixon, et\r\n  al.\r\nThat all areas that become\r\n  areas lying below the mean high water mark as the result of excavation above\r\n  the agreed mean high water mark are quit-claimed to the State of South\r\n  Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe quitclaim deeds were approved and made part of a\r\n  1969 court order ending the original litigation.  The 1969 order also stated\r\n  that it did not affect the 1963 order.\r\nThe parties agree that the canals have been open to\r\n  public use at all times since their construction.\r\nRespondent City of North Myrtle Beach (City) brought the\r\n  present lawsuit against East Cherry Grove, LLC (Appellant), and the State to\r\n  settle title to the canal bottoms located in the property deeded to East Cherry\r\n  Grove in the 1969 settlement.  The City asserted that the State held title to\r\n  the canal bottoms, a position in which the State concurred.  (Hereinafter the\r\n  City and State are jointly designated Respondents.)  At the conclusion of a\r\n  jury trial, the trial court denied Appellant’s motions for a directed verdict. \r\n  The jury returned a special verdict with separate findings that the State has\r\n  title in the canals based on the quitclaim deeds; that East Cherry Grove had\r\n  dedicated the canals to the public; and that the State holds title to the\r\n  canals in trust for the public.  This appeal followed.\r\nISSUES\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      1.\r\n       Did the trial court err when it failed to find the 1963 order conclusive\r\n  on the issue of ownership and found the quitclaim deeds ambiguous?\r\n        \r\n      \r\n    \r\n    \r\n      2.\r\n       Did the trial court err when it failed to find that the State is\r\n  estopped to deny the 1963 order?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\r\nThe nature of the underlying issue determines the\r\n  nature of a suit for declaratory judgment.  Felts v. Richland County,\r\n  303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991).  The determination of title to\r\n  real property is an action at law.  Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 367\r\n  S.E.2d 156 (1988).  In reviewing an action at law tried to a jury, the Court’s\r\n  jurisdiction extends only to the correction of errors of law, and a factual\r\n  finding of the jury will not be disturbed unless a review of the record\r\n  discloses that there is no evidence that reasonably supports the jury’s\r\n  findings.  Townes Associates, Ltd., v. City of Greenville, 266 S.C. 81,\r\n  221 S.E.2d 773 (1976).  Questions of law are decided with no particular\r\n  deference to the trial court.  Wiegand v. U.S. Automobile Association,\r\n  391 S.C. 159, 163, 705 S.E.2d 432, 434 (2011).\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erroneously\r\n  refused to grant it a directed verdict because title to the canals was unambiguously\r\n  established in East Cherry Grove in the court-approved settlement of prior\r\n  litigation.  We disagree.\r\nOn the first theory submitted to it, the jury found\r\n  that the State owns the canals under the quitclaim deeds.  Appellant argues\r\n  that the trial court erred when it denied Appellant’s motion for a directed\r\n  verdict and submitted this question to the jury.  Appellant argues in the\r\n  alternative that the trial court should have found that the 1963 order was\r\n  conclusive on the issue of ownership; that the quitclaim deeds unambiguously\r\n  quitclaimed all interest in the canals to East Cherry Grove; and that the State\r\n  is estopped by the 1963 order from claiming ownership of the canals.  We find\r\n  no error.\r\n\r\n1.&nbsp; Did the trial court err when it failed to find the 1963 order\r\n  conclusive on the issue of ownership and found the quitclaim deeds ambiguous?\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the 1963 order is conclusive on\r\n  the issue of ownership under the quitclaim deeds because it effectively\r\n  eliminates contradictory language from the quitclaim deeds, rendering them\r\n  unambiguous, or, in the alternative, that the language of the quitclaim deeds\r\n  unambiguously conveys all interest in the canals to East Cherry Grove.  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n“As a general rule, judgments are to be construed like\r\n  other written instruments.  The determinative factor is the intent of the\r\n  court, as gathered, not from an isolated part thereof, but from all the parts\r\n  of the judgment itself.  Hence, in construing a judgment, it should be examined\r\n  and considered in its entirety.  If the language employed is plain and\r\n  unambiguous, there is no room for construction or interpretation, and the\r\n  effect thereof must be declared in the light of the literal meaning of the\r\n  language used.”  Weil v. Weil, 299 S.C. 84, 90, 382 S.E.2d 471, 474 (Ct.\r\n  App. 1989) (citations and internal quotation marks omitted).  \r\nIn this case, the original suit was ultimately settled\r\n  by the 1969 order, which incorporated the parties’ quitclaim deeds and stated\r\n  that it did not affect the 1963 order.  Thus, the 1963 order and quitclaim\r\n  deeds must be interpreted as parts of a single, court-approved settlement\r\n  agreement.  \r\nThe 1963 consent order does contain language arguably implying\r\n  that most property in the area of East Cherry Grove’s Land as established in\r\n  the deeds is titled in East Cherry Grove.  Appellant construes this language as\r\n  both the State’s admission that it had no claim to that land in 1963 and the\r\n  court’s ratification in 1969 that none of East Cherry Grove’s Land would be\r\n  quitclaimed to the State by virtue of the settlement agreement.  We disagree.\r\nViewed in isolation, the 1969 reference to the 1963\r\n  order is susceptible of this interpretation.  As explained below, however,\r\n  construing all of the documents together we find the settlement at least\r\n  ambiguous as to ownership of the canal bottoms.  First, this argument ignores\r\n  the fact that the land was divided by one line, the Estimated Line of\r\n  Demarcation, in the 1963 order and by a different line, the agreed-on mean high\r\n  water mark, in the deeds.  Second, Appellant’s argument ignores the fact that\r\n  when parties settle a lawsuit, either may include property or other concessions\r\n  not a part of the original suit.  In other words, whatever land was involved in\r\n  the original suit, the settlement was not necessarily limited to that\r\n  property.  The court might have approved East Cherry Grove’s quitclaim of any\r\n  property to the State as consideration to settle the suit without believing such\r\n  a transfer would conflict with the 1963 order.  The court’s purpose for stating\r\n  in the 1969 order that the settlement did not affect the 1963 order could have\r\n  been nothing more than to avoid any taint on the title to lots sold by East\r\n  Cherry Grove to third parties between 1963 and 1969.\r\nAn examination of the quitclaim deeds bears out such\r\n  an interpretation.  The first paragraph of the quitclaim deed from East Cherry\r\n  Grove to the State quitclaims all right to “All of that certain area . . .\r\n  shown on a plat . . . to be below the agreed mean high water mark as delineated\r\n  on said plat” and proceeds to describe this agreed line by metes and bounds. \r\n  Had the parties intended the Estimated Line of Demarcation established in the\r\n  1963 order to finally settle title, the delineation of an agreed mean\r\n  high-water mark in the deeds would have been unnecessary.  Moreover, the agreed\r\n  mean high-water mark replicates the Estimated Line of Demarcation in only a\r\n  small fraction of its length. \r\nIn addition, in a subsequent paragraph the deed\r\n  quitclaims to the State “all areas lying below the agreed mean high water mark\r\n  on Northeast Canal, Nixon Canal, proposed Nixon Canal Extension, Main Channel,\r\n  Nye Cut and all other existing canals . . . .”  The plat shows that all of the\r\n  existing and proposed canals were located on East Cherry Grove’s Land.  \r\nFurther, the quitclaim deed to the State specifically\r\n  excludes certain items on the plat from its ambit.  The plat can be\r\n  characterized as a rectangle, the top of which (west) is given to the State\r\n  without reservation and the bottom of which is deeded generally to East Cherry\r\n  Grove.  Within the area deeded generally to East Cherry Grove, however, certain\r\n  parts, mostly waterways, are singled out for special treatment.  First, an area\r\n  to the left of the lower portion (south), the “Recreational Lake,” is\r\n  specifically excluded from the deed.  Similarly, an area to the right of the\r\n  lower portion (north), is also excluded.  In the center portion of the plat\r\n  deeded to East Cherry Grove, however, the existing canals “are quit-claimed to\r\n  the State of South Carolina,” as are any future canals.  The only exception to\r\n  the title in the canals going to the State is found in reference to Nye Cut, where\r\n  the deed specifically envisions future changes involving the filling of that\r\n  waterway and the vesting of title in that future highland in East Cherry\r\n  Grove.  While the affirmation of the 1963 order in the 1969 settlement arguably\r\n  can be read to reaffirm title in East Cherry Grove in the whole of the lower\r\n  portion of the plat, such a reading renders all of the specific exceptions and\r\n  exemptions in this quitclaim deed meaningless. \r\nAppellant argues in the alternative that the quitclaim\r\n  deed’s references to the canals were not to the whole of the canals but to the\r\n  junctures of the canals with the State’s Land or that this language constituted\r\n  a promise that East Cherry Grove would not dam the canals.  Even if these\r\n  interpretations are possible, they are not apparent from a straightforward\r\n  reading of the deed’s language.  At a minimum, this language permits the\r\n  interpretation that East Cherry Grove intended to quitclaim title to the\r\n  bottoms of these canals to the State.\r\nA later dispute between East Cherry Grove and a resident\r\n  who had purchased a lot on the Recreational Lake was heard by the same judge,\r\n  who concluded “That the area comprising Recreational Lake is not now and never\r\n  was owned by [East Cherry Grove].”  This finding is inconsistent with\r\n  Appellant’s interpretation of the settlement agreement.  Rather, it confirms\r\n  that the 1963 order was not included with the 1969 order for the purpose of\r\n  affirming that East Cherry Grove had title to all of the area comprising East\r\n  Cherry Grove’s Land and gives effect to the quitclaim deed’s exclusion of the\r\n  Recreational Lake from what remained East Cherry Grove’s Land.\r\nWe find that the 1963 order and quitclaim deeds,\r\n  interpreted as parts of the 1969 settlement agreement and court order, do not\r\n  unambiguously quitclaim all interest in the canals to East Cherry Grove.  Thus,\r\n  the trial court did not err when it refused to rule that the 1963 order\r\n  conclusively established title to the canals in East Cherry Grove and found the\r\n  quitclaim deeds ambiguous.\r\n\r\n2.&nbsp; Did the trial court err when it failed to find that the State is\r\n  estopped to deny the 1963 order?\r\n\r\nAppellant argues that the trial court erred when it\r\n  denied Appellant’s motions for nonsuit and directed verdict on the basis that\r\n  the State is judicially estopped from denying that East Cherry Grove owned all\r\n  of the area containing the disputed canal bottoms based upon the 1963 order.  We\r\n  disagree.\r\n“Judicial estoppel is an equitable concept that\r\n  prevents a litigant from asserting position inconsistent with, or in conflict\r\n  with, one the litigant has previously asserted in the same or related\r\n  proceeding. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure the integrity of the\r\n  judicial process, not to protect the parties from allegedly dishonest conduct\r\n  by their adversary.”  Cothran v. Brown, 357 S.C. 210, 215, 592 S.E.2d\r\n  629, 631 (2004) (citations omitted).  \r\nIn this case, the 1963 order fails to demonstrate a\r\n  definite position taken by the State with regard to canal bottoms located\r\n  within East Cherry Grove’s Land.  Even if it did, principles of judicial\r\n  estoppel would not apply where a contrary position as to title is premised on\r\n  intervening documents such as the quitclaim deeds here.  Permitting the State\r\n  to argue that it has title to the canals certainly does not threaten the\r\n  integrity of the judicial process. \r\nWe find that the elements of judicial estoppel are not\r\n  met, the State is not estopped to assert title to the canal bottoms, and the\r\n  trial court did not err when it denied Appellant’s motions for nonsuit and\r\n  directed verdict.\r\nBecause the State is not estopped to claim title to\r\n  the canal bottoms under the 1963 order, the 1963 order does not answer the\r\n  question of ownership, and the quitclaim deeds were ambiguous, the trial court\r\n  did not err when it denied Appellant’s motion for nonsuit and directed verdict\r\n  and submitted the question of ownership under the quitclaim deeds to the jury.  \r\nAppellant’s remaining exceptions are disposed of\r\n  pursuant to Rule 220(b), SCACR, and the following authorities: North\r\n    Greenville College v. Sherman Construction Co., Inc., 270 S.C. 553, 557,\r\n  243 S.E.2d 441, 442 (1978) (trial court has broad discretion to determine the\r\n  admissibility of evidence, and its decisions are reversed only when they\r\n  constitute an abuse of discretion that amounts to an error of law); Rule 403,\r\n  SCRE; Richardson v. Donald Hawkins Construction, Inc., 381 S.C. 347,\r\n  352, 673 S.E.2d 808, 811 (2009) (permitting exclusion of evidence that would\r\n  mislead or confuse the jury, constitute undue delay or waste of time, or be cumulative); State v. Rabon, 275 S.C. 459, 461, 272 S.E.2d 634, 636 (1980) (judge’s\r\n  charge to the jury must correctly state the law, but reversal is not warranted\r\n  “when considered as a whole, [the charge] adequately cover[s] the applicable law\r\n  under the facts of the case”); Hardin v. South Carolina Dept. of Transp.,\r\n  371 S.C. 598, 609 n.4, 641 S.E.2d 437, 443 n.4 (2007) (“Government action can\r\n  effect no taking unless it has deprived an owner of a property interest.”).  \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons given above, the jury verdict is AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN,\r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Under the two-issue rule, we need not reach the questions whether the other two\r\n  theories were properly submitted to the jury.  Smoak v.

(2) the controlling\r\n  legislation applicable to the PUSD and the RIF policy; (3) Appellants'\r\n  constitutional rights with respect to employment; and (4) Appellants' rights as\r\n  &quot;covered employees&quot; with respect to the RIF policy.  Based on these\r\n  alleged errors, Appellants assert they are entitled to reinstatement to\r\n  employment as well as back pay and benefits.  We affirm in part, reverse in\r\n  part, and remand.\r\n\r\nI.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\nIn\r\n  1981, the South Carolina Legislature established a &quot;special statewide\r\n  unified school district&quot; within the SCDC known as the Palmetto Unified\r\n  School District No. 1.[2]  The PUSD was designed to &quot;enhance the quality and scope&quot; of inmate\r\n  education with a goal of reintegrating offenders into the community.[3] \r\n  The PUSD operates nine high schools, which are located in correctional\r\n  institutions throughout the state, serving students between the ages of 17 and\r\n  21 years old.  In addition, the PUSD offers inmates older than 21 the\r\n  opportunity to receive adult education if they wish to pursue their GED while\r\n  incarcerated.  The PUSD also oversees a vocational program that offers 53\r\n  vocational and career technology classes designed to furnish inmates with basic\r\n  technical skills to aid them in securing gainful employment upon their\r\n  release.  \r\nAs a\r\n  sanctioned school district, the PUSD must meet standards set by the State Board\r\n  of Education.[4] \r\n  The PUSD has its own superintendent and school board[5] that are responsible for operating the PUSD &quot;under the supervision of the\r\n  State Department of Corrections.&quot;[6] \r\n  By statute, &quot;[t]he superintendent of the district [PUSD] and all other\r\n  educational personnel shall be employed, supervised, and terminated according\r\n  to the South Carolina Department of Corrections' personnel policies and\r\n  procedures.&quot;[7]\r\nIn\r\n  January 2003, Jon Ozmint was appointed as the Executive Director of the SCDC. \r\n  Faced with budget cuts and an ongoing budget deficit, Ozmint presented\r\n  Reduction-in-Force policy ADM-11.05 dated March 14, 2003, to the State Office\r\n  of Human Resources (OHR) for its approval.[8]  The policy outlined the procedures to be utilized in effectuating the RIF plan\r\n  and the employees' respective rights.\r\nAs\r\n  part of the plan, the SCDC was divided into &quot;competitive areas,&quot;[9] which were delineated by eleven circular regions throughout the state that included\r\n  &quot;entire groups of institutions and divisions within a reasonable\r\n  geographic area to accommodate the realistic opportunity for staff relocation,\r\n  . . . recall and reinstatement.&quot;  Under the RIF policy, a &quot;covered\r\n  state employee&quot;[10] whose position was eliminated as a result of the RIF was permitted to\r\n  &quot;bump&quot;[11] another &quot;employee with the lowest RIF Service Date in the same job\r\n  classification and pay band with the same or lower pay level.&quot;    A\r\n  &quot;covered employee,&quot; however, could only exercise this right within\r\n  his or her designated competitive area.[12]    \r\nAdditionally,\r\n  the RIF policy provided for &quot;Recall and Reinstatement Rights of\r\n  Employees.&quot;[13] \r\n  Specifically, the policy provided in pertinent part:\r\n\r\nWhen a vacancy occurs in an employee's competitive\r\n  area which is (1) in the same job class, pay band, pay level or\r\n    lower, and functionally similar as the position held prior to the\r\n  lay off, downward bumping, or reassignment and (2) within a reasonable\r\n  geographic distance (30 mile radius) of the work location of the employee, then\r\n  the eligible employee will be offered the vacancy provided s/he meets the\r\n  minimum training and experience qualifications. \r\n\r\nIn\r\n  his letter addressed to the Director of the OHR, Ozmint stated that he had made\r\n  the decision to eliminate &quot;148 non-security&quot; positions from\r\n  headquarters management and administrative support staff, non-essential inmate\r\n  support programs, and certified education and support staff.\r\nOn\r\n  March 28, 2003, the OHR approved the RIF plan after determining the plan was\r\n  &quot;procedurally correct.&quot;  The OHR, however, clarified that its\r\n  approval did not &quot;include the determination of the geographic locations in\r\n  the competitive areas, competitive classes, competitive class series, bumping\r\n  rights, the positions to be eliminated, or any exceptions included in the plan,\r\n  since these are solely the responsibility of SCDC management.&quot;  \r\nThe\r\n  SCDC notified its employees of the RIF on April 1, 2003.  On June 1, 2003, the\r\n  day the RIF plan went into effect, 148 employment positions were eliminated\r\n  from the SCDC.  The PUSD lost 84 positions, which included Appellants and represented\r\n  56.75% of the RIF.\r\nOn\r\n  July 16, 2003, Ozmint notified SCDC employees of a &quot;Retirement\r\n  Opportunity&quot; that had been established to further reduce costs.  Under\r\n  this plan, the SCDC would permit employees to retire from the agency between\r\n  August 1 and October 1, 2003.  Once retired, the employee was required to\r\n  &quot;experience a 15 calendar-day break in service&quot; and then could be\r\n  rehired in their present position but in a temporary capacity.  A temporary\r\n  employee[14] did not receive benefits other than &quot;retiree benefits&quot; and was paid\r\n  for hours actually worked.  \r\n Appellants, who\r\n  were certified educators with the PUSD and &quot;covered employees,&quot;\r\n  timely filed grievances with the SCDC regarding their separation from employment\r\n  as a consequence of the RIF.[15] \r\n  The SCDC denied each of the grievances without a hearing.  Subsequently, each\r\n  of the Appellants appealed the SCDC's denial of their grievances to the State\r\n  Human Resources Director.  After Appellants received the final, unfavorable\r\n  decision of the State Human Resources Director, Appellants filed a consolidated\r\n  complaint and petition for judicial review in the circuit court.  \r\nAfter\r\n  several procedural hearings and rulings involving discovery, a circuit court\r\n  judge found that material issues of fact existed regarding Appellants'\r\n  contention that the SCDC inconsistently or improperly applied its RIF policy\r\n  and plan in 2003.  As a result, the judge remanded the matter to the OHR for\r\n  disposition by hearing before the State Employee Grievance Committee\r\n  (&quot;Committee&quot;).\r\nFollowing\r\n  ten days of hearings, the Committee issued its final decision denying Appellants'\r\n  request for relief and upholding the June 1, 2003 RIF plan as implemented by\r\n  the SCDC.  The Committee found there was &quot;insufficient evidence to support\r\n  Appellants' allegations that the RIF policy or plan was improperly or\r\n  inconsistently implemented.&quot;   Additionally, the Committee concluded there\r\n  was &quot;no credible evidence presented that the elimination of educator\r\n  positions in the PUSD was motivated by a desire for retaliation for an earlier\r\n  lawsuit[16] that resulted in the increase of educators' salaries.&quot;  Instead, the\r\n  Committee found the RIF plan was developed to &quot;maximize[] savings while\r\n  retaining as many employees as possible in essential areas.&quot;  The\r\n  Committee noted that &quot;[t]he education program was one area where\r\n  significant cost-saving opportunities existed&quot; as opposed to such areas as\r\n  &quot;security, housing, clothing, food, and healthcare&quot; where further\r\n  budgetary cuts could not be &quot;tolerated.&quot;  \r\nIn\r\n  reaching its conclusion, the Committee found the SCDC &quot;followed proper\r\n  protocol and did not violate any policies, procedures, or statutes.&quot;  \r\n  Specifically, the Committee found that:  (1) educators were not unfairly\r\n  targeted for termination or terminated based on a belief by other employees or\r\n  members of management that educators were &quot;overpaid&quot; but, rather, as\r\n  the result of &quot;cost-saving principles&quot; due to the high salaries of\r\n  most educators as compared to other personnel; (2) the development of the\r\n  competitive areas did not violate the RIF policy as the manner in which these\r\n  areas are designated is left to the discretion of the Executive Director of the\r\n  SCDC and neither state law nor the RIF policy required the PUSD to be treated as\r\n  a single, competitive area to afford agency-wide bumping rights; (3) the SCDC\r\n  management was not obligated by statute or policy to consult with the PUSD\r\n  School Board or obtain its approval before implementing the RIF as the PUSD is\r\n  not a separate entity but exists as a unit under the purview of the SCDC; (4) the\r\n  retirement opportunity offered by the SCDC after the RIF was designed to\r\n  further reduce operating costs by permitting employees to retire from their\r\n  full-time positions and return to their positions in a temporary capacity, a\r\n  position for which recall rights were inapplicable; and (5) the hiring of\r\n  temporary employees before the RIF and the retention of certain temporary\r\n  employees after the RIF did not violate the approved RIF policy as these positions\r\n  were less costly than full-time positions given that the positions were hourly\r\n  and without benefits. \r\nAppellants\r\n  appealed the Committee's final decision to the ALC.  Following a hearing, the\r\n  ALC affirmed the Committee's decision.  In a detailed order, the ALC denied each\r\n  of Appellants' claims by reiterating and elaborating on the Committee's\r\n  conclusions of law.  Additionally, the ALC rejected Appellants' supplemental\r\n  argument regarding an alleged equal protection violation.  Specifically, the ALC\r\n  found the SCDC had a rational basis &quot;by which to both implement its RIF\r\n  through the establishment of 11 competitive areas and to offer its retirement\r\n  opportunity to those employees unaffected by the RIF who were retirement\r\n  eligible.&quot;\r\nAppellants\r\n  appealed the ALC's final decision to the Court of Appeals.  This Court\r\n  certified the appeal from the Court of Appeals pursuant to Rule 204(b) of the\r\n  South Carolina Appellate Court Rules.\r\nII.\r\nA.\r\nThe Administrative Procedures Act\r\n  establishes this Court's standard of review for cases decided by the ALC and is\r\n  set forth in section 1-23-610(B) of the South Carolina Code, which provides:\r\n\r\nThe review of the administrative law\r\n  judge's order must be confined to the record.  The court may not substitute its\r\n  judgment for the judgment of the administrative law judge as to\r\n  the weight of the evidence on questions of fact.  The court of appeals may\r\n  affirm the decision or remand the case for further proceedings; or, it may\r\n  reverse or modify the decision if the substantive rights of the petitioner have\r\n  been prejudiced because the finding, conclusion, or decision is:\r\n(a)  in violation of constitutional or statutory provisions;\r\n  (b)  in excess of the statutory authority of the agency;\r\n(c)  made upon unlawful procedure;\r\n(d)  affected by other error of law;\r\n(e) clearly erroneous in view of the reliable, probative, and    substantial\r\n  evidence on the whole record; or\r\n(f)  arbitrary or\r\n  capricious or characterized by abuse of discretion or clearly unwarranted\r\n  exercise of discretion.\r\n\r\nS.C. Code Ann. § 1-23-610(B) (Supp. 2011).  \r\nB.\r\nIn\r\n  challenging the legitimacy of the RIF policy and plan, Appellants raise\r\n  multiple arguments through the presentation of factual issues, RIF policy\r\n  provisions, statutory law, and constitutional law.  Rather than address these\r\n  points separately, we find the most logical approach to analyzing these\r\n  arguments is to categorize the issues into Appellants' claims regarding the creation,\r\n  implementation, and effectuation of the RIF. \r\nC.\r\nBecause the PUSD is statutorily defined as a\r\n  &quot;unified,&quot; statewide school district, Appellants contend the PUSD\r\n  should not have been included in the RIF as it is a separate entity of the SCDC. \r\n  In the alternative, Appellants claim the PUSD's Superintendent and Board should\r\n  have been consulted and actively involved in the creation of the RIF policy and\r\n  plan.  In support of this claim, Appellants direct this Court's attention to Superintendent\r\n  Wendell Blanton's testimony wherein he stated that he only heard about the RIF\r\n  plan shortly before it was implemented.  \r\nIn addition to these procedural challenges, Appellants\r\n  assert the SCDC, via Ozmint and John Near,[17] exceeded its authority in dividing the agency into eleven competitive areas as\r\n  these geographic regions were arbitrarily drawn solely for the purpose of\r\n  eliminating &quot;bumping&quot; rights for senior PUSD employees.  Appellants\r\n  claim these geographic regions had &quot;no bearing on administration or delivery\r\n  of educational services&quot; and ultimately deprived Appellants of the\r\n  opportunity to compete for vacant positions throughout the state rather than only\r\n  in their limited geographic region, which encompassed a thirty-mile radius. \r\nAs will be discussed, we conclude the ALC properly\r\n  affirmed the Committee's decision regarding the SCDC's creation of the RIF\r\n  policy and resultant plan. \r\n1.\r\nAlthough section 24-25-40 of the South Carolina Code authorizes\r\n  the Superintendent and the Board to operate the PUSD, they do not operate\r\n  independently as this code section also states that this division is\r\n  &quot;under the supervision of the State Department of Corrections.&quot; \r\n  Furthermore, as previously identified, section 24-25-90 of the South Carolina\r\n  Code specifically includes the PUSD and all other educational personnel within\r\n  the SCDC and subjects them to the agency's personnel policies and procedures\r\n  regarding employment and termination.\r\nIn addition to this legislative mandate, there is\r\n  evidence in the record that the PUSD operates and is viewed as a functional\r\n  subsidiary of the SCDC.  John Near testified regarding the organizational\r\n  structure of the SCDC.  Near stated the SCDC has twenty divisions, which include\r\n  the Education Division.  Geraldine Miro, the Deputy Director for the SCDC's\r\n  Programs and Services, classified the PUSD as a component of the Division of\r\n  Education within the SCDC.  Additionally, Wendell Blanton the PUSD's\r\n  Superintendent testified that the PUSD &quot;encompasses education in the\r\n  Department of Corrections.&quot;  He added that he not only reported to the\r\n  PUSD Board but also to Miro.  He also admitted that the PUSD, unlike a regular\r\n  school board, had &quot;limited power.&quot;  Finally, several witnesses\r\n  testified that the PUSD does not have its own finance office, payroll\r\n  department, or human resource office as these are centrally located and\r\n  operated in the SCDC's headquarters in Columbia.\r\nBecause the PUSD exists as merely a division under the\r\n  purview of the SCDC's Executive Director and not as a separate entity, it was properly\r\n  included in the RIF.  By the same reasoning, there is no statutory authority to\r\n  support Appellants' position that its Superintendent or Board should have been\r\n  consulted and involved in the creation of the RIF policy and plan.\r\n2.\r\nAs the record reflects, all divisions of the SCDC were\r\n  included in and affected to some extent by the RIF.   Like the other divisions,\r\n  the PUSD was subject to the authority of Ozmint.  In this capacity, Ozmint was\r\n  authorized with broad discretion to create an RIF policy and plan to reduce\r\n  costs within the SCDC.   As recognized by the OHR's approval of the RIF policy,\r\n  Ozmint legitimately identified the education division as being less essential\r\n  compared to those divisions involving security, housing, clothing, food, and\r\n  healthcare.  Although a disproportionate number of PUSD positions were\r\n  eliminated as compared to other divisions, we agree with the ALC that Ozmint did\r\n  not exceed his authority by creating the eleven competitive areas to effectuate\r\n  the RIF plan.\r\nAccording to the applicable regulations, the SCDC is specifically\r\n  authorized to determine the &quot;competitive areas&quot; according to the\r\n  &quot;critical needs&quot; of the agency.  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs.\r\n  19-719.04(B)(2)(b) (Supp. 2010).  Furthermore, contrary to Appellants'\r\n  assertions, the geographic limitation of a thirty-mile radius is specifically\r\n  provided for in paragraph 7.2 of the RIF Policy and appears to be validly\r\n  derived from section 8-17-320 definitional provisions and the OHR's regulatory\r\n  provision 19-700, which defines an &quot;involuntary reassignment&quot; as\r\n  &quot;the movement of an employee's principal place of employment in excess of\r\n  thirty miles from the prior work station at the initiative of the agency.&quot;\r\n   See S.C. Code Ann. § 8-17-320(13) (Supp. 2011) (defining\r\n  &quot;involuntary reassignment&quot; of an agency employee); 23A S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 19-700 (Supp. 2010) (same).\r\nMoreover, each competitive area included at least one\r\n  correctional institution and, in turn, at least one school.  Because each\r\n  correctional institution has its own organizational structure, we reject\r\n  Appellants' contention that the designation of the eleven areas violated the\r\n  terms of the RIF policy as the staff within each correctional institution and\r\n  school are &quot;separately organized and clearly distinguishable from the\r\n  staff in other areas.&quot;  \r\nThere is also evidence in the record that the eleven\r\n  geographic areas were reasonable based on financial and employee\r\n  &quot;bumping&quot; considerations.  Near, who was directed by Ozmint to create\r\n  the competitive areas, testified he and his staff developed these areas based\r\n  on the threshold understanding that an involuntary reassignment of an agency\r\n  employee is limited to a thirty-mile radius.  Near claimed the creation of the\r\n  geographic areas was the best option to provide eliminated SCDC employees with\r\n  the &quot;biggest opportunity to bump&quot; in a confined area so that they\r\n  would not have to relocate to another area of the state.  Ozmint also testified\r\n  the regions were drawn to minimize bumping which, in turn, would result in cost\r\n  savings.  Jon Davis, the Director of Audits for the SCDC, testified the areas\r\n  were allocated in such a way that &quot;when the RIF took place, it would be a\r\n  reasonable area for people to bump into and they wouldn't have such a huge\r\n  commute to have to go all the way across the state.&quot;  Davis compared the\r\n  small geographic area to that of a &quot;normal school district.&quot;  \r\nBased on the foregoing, we agree with the ALC that\r\n  there were no procedural or statutory violations committed by the SCDC in\r\n  creating the RIF.  The RIF policy and plan complied with the requisite\r\n  administrative and legislative provisions and was approved by the OHR as\r\n  &quot;procedurally correct&quot; prior to its implementation.\r\nIn view of our decision, the question becomes whether\r\n  the SCDC properly implemented the RIF plan.\r\nD.\r\nAppellants\r\n  contend the SCDC's method of reassigning employees to temporary positions and\r\n  rehiring retirees in a temporary capacity to provide educational services violated\r\n  the provisions of the RIF policy.  Based on the SCDC's utilization of temporary\r\n  employees before and after the RIF, Appellants assert their rights as\r\n  &quot;covered employees&quot; were violated given they were precluded from\r\n  being &quot;recalled&quot; into positions that were filled by temporary\r\n  employees or briefly vacated when employees retired. Additionally, those\r\n  Appellants who retained employment with the SCDC after the RIF assert they received\r\n  a correctional officer's pay, which was &quot;significantly below the statutory\r\n  teacher pay schedule&quot; despite performing essentially the same educational duties\r\n  as they did prior to the RIF. \r\n1.\r\nWe\r\n  find Appellants are correct in their assessment of the SCDC's utilization of\r\n  temporary employees.  \r\nThere\r\n  is no dispute that Appellants were &quot;covered employees&quot; at the time\r\n  the SCDC implemented the RIF on June 1, 2003.  As &quot;covered\r\n  employees,&quot; Appellants were entitled to be recalled for a period of one\r\n  year (June 1, 2003 through May 31, 2004) if a position for which they were\r\n  eligible became vacant.  23A S.C. Code Ann. Regs. 19-719.04(B)(4)(a) (Supp.\r\n  2010).   \r\nAs\r\n  the record reflects, several employees retired pursuant to the SCDC's\r\n  &quot;Retirement Opportunity&quot; on July 16, 2003 and were then rehired by\r\n  the SCDC in a temporary capacity.  Although the SCDC was statutorily authorized\r\n  to rehire these retirees, this optional decision should not have nullified\r\n  Appellants' recall rights.  \r\nOnce\r\n  retired, the SCDC employees were required to &quot;experience a 15 calendar-day\r\n  break in service&quot; and could be rehired in their present positions but in a\r\n  temporary capacity.  Because these employees experienced a &quot;break in\r\n  service&quot;[18] when they retired, their positions became vacant.  Furthermore, at the point of\r\n  their retirement, these employees lost any &quot;right&quot; to re-employment\r\n  as this decision is within the discretion of the SCDC.  See S.C. Code\r\n  Ann. § 9-11-90(4)(a) (Supp. 2011) (outlining retirement provisions for PORS and\r\n  stating, in part, that &quot;[a] retired member of\r\n  the system who has been retired for at least fifteen consecutive calendar days\r\n  may be hired and return to employment covered by this system or any system\r\n  provided in this title without affecting the monthly retirement allowance he is\r\n  receiving from this system&quot;); Ahrens v. State, 392 S.C. 340,\r\n  709 S.E.2d 54 (2011) (noting textual similarities between SCRS (section\r\n  9-1-1790) and PORS statutes and recognizing that an\r\n  employee's decision to return to work after retiring was optional, as was an\r\n  employer's decision to re-hire that employee).    \r\nIn\r\n  contrast, Appellants had statutory and policy priority over the retirees to be\r\n  recalled into the vacant position.  See S.C. Code Ann. § 8-11-185(C) (Supp.\r\n  2011) (&quot;An agency seeking to fill a vacancy or a\r\n  new position must obtain information from the Office of Human Resources'\r\n  reduction in force applicant pool provided to the office pursuant to subsection\r\n  (A).  An agency shall provide priority consideration to employees terminated\r\n  due to a reduction in force for any vacancy or new position in the same\r\n  classification, classification series, or position category held at the time of\r\n  layoff. An agency is prohibited from filling the position if the agency does\r\n  not first seek to fill the position from among these qualified employees\r\n  provided by the Office of Human Resources.&quot;).\r\nThus,\r\n  Appellants were entitled to be recalled for the vacant positions.  By implementing\r\n  the &quot;Retirement Opportunity&quot; and immediately &quot;recasting&quot;\r\n  the vacant positions as temporary positions, the SCDC deprived Appellants of\r\n  their recall rights.   Furthermore, there is evidence in the record that some\r\n  of the rehired retirees were retained for more than one year in clear violation\r\n  of the statutory definition of a &quot;temporary employee,&quot; which in essence\r\n  converted the temporary position to a Full-Time Equivalent (FTE) position.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we conclude the ALC erred as a matter of law in analyzing the\r\n  temporary employee issue.  Accordingly, we reverse this portion of the ALC's\r\n  order.\r\n2.\r\nThe\r\n  record reflects that four Appellants were retained as employees after the RIF, but\r\n  were classified and paid as correctional officers rather than certified\r\n  educators despite performing nearly identical duties as those assigned before\r\n  the RIF.\r\nJames\r\n  Bell testified that, prior to the RIF, he was employed as a vocational\r\n  carpentry teacher at Perry Correctional Institution.  He received his\r\n  certification for vocational carpentry in 1977 and was first employed with the\r\n  PUSD beginning in 1992.  Bell lost this position due to the RIF, but was\r\n  rehired in January 2006 to teach carpentry at the same location.  Although he\r\n  performed the same duties as before the RIF, Bell testified that he received\r\n  approximately $13,000 less than he was making in June 2003.  \r\nNancy\r\n  Glenn testified she was employed as a librarian for approximately eleven years\r\n  prior to the RIF.  After the RIF, Glenn lost her position but accepted a job as\r\n  a correctional officer.  According to Glenn, she performed the same librarian\r\n  duties in the new position with &quot;some additional duties as officer.&quot; \r\n  She further stated that she worked in the same building before and after the\r\n  RIF.  Glenn, however, received approximately &quot;one-half&quot; her previous\r\n  salary.  Glenn served in this position for almost two years before being hired\r\n  as classroom teacher and librarian at Trenton Correctional Institution.\r\nMary\r\n  McCabe testified that she was employed as a library/media specialist in the\r\n  education department located at Perry Correctional Institution prior to the\r\n  RIF.  After the RIF, McCabe accepted a position as a correctional officer in\r\n  order to avoid losing her insurance and other state employee benefits.  McCabe\r\n  did not go through officer training and still performed her duties as the\r\n  library/media specialist.  McCabe testified that she received a $2,100\r\n  reduction in pay.  One month later, McCabe was offered the option of being\r\n  called back into the position of library/media specialist on the condition that\r\n  she would be transferred to the Tyger River Correctional Institution.  McCabe\r\n  accepted the offer with the understanding that she would be paid according to\r\n  the teachers' pay schedule.  Although McCabe was responsible for two libraries,\r\n  she testified that her pay did not increase but remained at the &quot;same teacher\r\n  scale pay&quot; in the amount equal to her salary before the RIF.      \r\n Beverly McClanahan\r\n  testified that prior to the RIF she was employed to teach vocational\r\n  horticulture at Broad River Correctional Institution.  After the RIF,\r\n  McClanahan accepted a position as a correctional officer with a $23,000\r\n  reduction in pay.  In August 2004, McClanahan was asked to &quot;come back and\r\n  teach vocational horticulture but as a lieutenant.&quot;  In this position,\r\n  which was entitled &quot;vocational trainer,&quot; McClanahan performed duties\r\n  that &quot;were exactly the same&quot; as those that she had done prior to the\r\n  RIF.  In June 2005, McClanahan accepted a position at the Department of\r\n  Juvenile Justice to teach horticulture and science.  In this position,\r\n  McClanahan was compensated according to the teachers' pay schedule.              \r\nIn\r\n  view of this evidence, we find the SCDC effectively circumvented the Court of\r\n  Appeals' decision in Abraham as the affected Appellants were certified\r\n  educators performing educational duties; thus, they were entitled to a salary\r\n  that was commensurate with the teachers' pay schedule as established in Abraham.  See Abraham v. Palmetto Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1, 343 S.C. 36, 49,\r\n  538 S.E.2d 656, 663 (Ct. App. 2000) (interpreting section 24-25-70(7) of the\r\n  South Carolina Code and concluding that &quot;the plain language of 'teachers'\r\n  pay schedule based on the state and average school supplement pay scales' means\r\n  that, in addition to the state mandatory minimum, [the PUSD] Employees are\r\n  entitled to additional compensation equal to the mathematical average of all\r\n  salary supplements paid by school districts across the state&quot;). \r\nOur\r\n  decision is guided by our recent opinion in Grimsley v. South Carolina Law\r\n    Enforcement Division, 396 S.C. 276, 721 S.E.2d 423 (2012).  In Grimsley,\r\n  Appellants were rehired employees of the South Carolina Law Enforcement\r\n  Division (&quot;SLED&quot;) and members of the Police Officers Retirement\r\n  System.  As part of this process, SLED required Appellants to sign a form,\r\n  which provided that Appellants &quot;will have a reduction of 13.6% in [their]\r\n  salary to cover the amount it will cost SLED to pay the employer portion of\r\n  retirement.&quot;  Id. at 279, 721 S.E.2d at 425.  Appellants brought a\r\n  takings claim on the ground this provision was contrary to section 9-11-90(4)(b)\r\n  of the South Carolina Code, which assigns the responsibility for the employer\r\n  portion of retirement to the employer.  Id.  We agreed with Appellants,\r\n  finding their &quot;takings claim [was] predicated on their entitlement to\r\n  retain the percentage of their salary--13.6%--that was used to pay the employer\r\n  portion of the retirement contributions.&quot;  Id. at 285, 721 S.E.2d\r\n  at 428.  Accordingly, we concluded that section 9-11-90 provided a basis for Appellants\r\n  to assert a cognizable property interest rooted in state law that was\r\n  sufficient to survive Respondent's motion to dismiss.  Id.  \r\nSimilar\r\n  to the employees' statutory right in Grimsley, Appellants as\r\n  &quot;covered employees&quot; were statutorily entitled to be recalled to\r\n  vacant positions for a period of one year following the RIF.  Furthermore,\r\n  those employees who were retained after the RIF and performed the same\r\n  educational duties were entitled to a salary based on the teachers' pay schedule\r\n  established in Abraham.  The SCDC could not, through an internal policy,\r\n  deprive Appellants of these interests rooted in state law.[19]  \r\nE.\r\nFinally,\r\n  Appellants contend the RIF deprived them of the constitutionally protected\r\n  right to continuing employment in violation of due process of law and the equal\r\n  protection of laws.  Specifically, Appellants explain that &quot;[a]s 'covered\r\n  employees,' [they] enjoyed the right to retain employment unless removed for\r\n  cause or by proper reduction in force.&quot;\r\nAs\r\n  previously discussed, we find Appellants were arbitrarily and capriciously\r\n  denied a right to employment pursuant to their recall rights and a property\r\n  interest as to their compensation established in Abraham.  Thus, our\r\n  decision to reverse the ALC with respect to the temporary employee issue and\r\n  the salary issue is determinative that Appellants' substantive due process\r\n  rights were violated.\r\nWe\r\n  decline to address Appellants' remaining constitutional arguments as a decision\r\n  would be inconsequential given our prior rulings.  See Futch v.\r\n    McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335 S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591,\r\n  598 (1999) (holding an appellate court need not address\r\n  remaining issues when disposition of a prior issue is dispositive); see also Arnal v. Fraser, 371 S.C. 512, 523, 641 S.E.2d 419, 424 (2007) (&quot;It\r\n  is our firm policy to decline to rule on constitutional issues unless such a\r\n  ruling is required.&quot;).\r\nIII.\r\nBased\r\n  on the foregoing, we find the SCDC properly created the RIF policy and\r\n  submitted it to the OHR for approval.  Because the OHR deemed the RIF\r\n  &quot;procedurally correct,&quot; the ALC correctly affirmed the Committee's\r\n  decision regarding the inclusion of the PUSD in the RIF and the designation of\r\n  the eleven competitive areas.  We, however, conclude that the SCDC violated\r\n  statutory law in precluding Appellants from exercising their priority right to\r\n  recall as to the positions vacated by the retirees.  Because the\r\n  &quot;Retirement Opportunity&quot; offered by the SCDC required a fifteen-day\r\n  break in service before rehiring, we find that &quot;window&quot; constituted a\r\n  vacancy for which Appellants should have been offered the opportunity for\r\n  employment.  In a related issue, we find the SCDC violated the Abraham decision by retaining certified educators after the RIF but paying them as\r\n  correctional officers as they were entitled to be compensated commensurate with\r\n  the teachers' pay schedule.  Accordingly, we affirm in part, reverse in part,\r\n  and remand this case to the Committee to determine the appropriate relief.\r\nAFFIRMED\r\n  IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., PLEICONES, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]  &quot;'Reduction in force'\r\n  means a determination made by an agency head to eliminate one or more filled\r\n  positions in one or more organizational units within the agency due to\r\n  budgetary limitations, shortage of work, or organizational changes.&quot;  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 8-17-320(21) (Supp. 2011).\r\n[2]  S.C.

Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 19-700 (Supp. 2010).  Subsection six of this regulation delineates a move\r\n  &quot;from a full-time (FTE) position to a temporary, temporary grant, or\r\n  time-limited position&quot; as constituting a &quot;break in service.&quot;  Id.   \r\n[19]   As previously noted, the Regulations regarding RIFs\r\n  were amended and became effective of May 28, 2010.  Of import is a provision\r\n  that states, \r\n\r\nWhen a covered employee is assigned lower level responsibilities\r\n  or demoted as a result of a reduction in force implemented due to budgetary\r\n  reductions, the employee's salary may be reduced on the effective date of the\r\n  reduction in force.  The agency head or his designee, at his discretion, may\r\n  reduce the employee's salary to a salary either between 0%-15% below the\r\n  employee's current salary or between the employee's current salary and the\r\n  midpoint of the lower pay band.  In exercising this discretion, the agency head\r\n  or his designee may use the option which results in the greatest cost savings.\r\n\r\n1 S.C. Code Ann.\r\n  Regs. 19-719.04(A)(5) (2011).  We find this provision is inapplicable in the\r\n  instant case as:  (1) it post-dates the June 2003 RIF; and (2) the affected\r\n  Appellants were not assigned lower level responsibilities but, rather,\r\n  performed nearly identical duties to those assigned prior to the RIF. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"27115","title":"Hook Point v.

BCS Life Ins. Co., 367 S.C. 540,\r\n  544, 627 S.E.2d 687, 689 (2006).  “An abuse of discretion occurs when the\r\n  decision of the trial court is unsupported by the evidence or controlled by an\r\n  error of law.”  Peek v. Spartanburg Reg’l Healthcare Sys., 367 S.C. 450,\r\n  454, 626 S.E.2d 34, 36 (Ct. App. 2005).  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBB&amp;T contends that the circuit court erred when it\r\n  granted the preliminary injunction.  We agree.\r\n“A preliminary injunction should issue only if necessary to\r\n  preserve the status quo ante, and only upon a showing by the moving party that\r\n  without such relief it will suffer irreparable harm, that it has a likelihood\r\n  of success on the merits, and that there is no adequate remedy at law.”  Poynter\r\n    Investments, Inc. v. Century Builders of Piedmont, Inc., 387 S.C. 583,\r\n  586-87, 694 S.E.2d 15, 17 (2010).  \r\nOn the second element, likelihood of success on the merits, BB&amp;T\r\n  argues that the grounds for refusing to honor a letter of credit are\r\n  exceedingly narrow and that Hook Point has failed to show it is likely to\r\n  succeed on the merits under that standard.  Thus, BB&amp;T argues that the\r\n  circuit court erred when it found that Hook Point had sufficiently established\r\n  this element.  We agree.\r\nA letter of credit is a financial instrument designed to\r\n  reduce the need for counterparties in a transaction to trust one another by\r\n  adding an  intermediary bank to the transaction.  This intermediary bank\r\n  extends credit to one party (typically the buyer in a sales transaction[2])\r\n  so that the other need not do so.  In a sales transaction, the letter of credit\r\n  typically requires a seller to represent that he has shipped goods under a\r\n  sales contract and to document this representation with a bill of lading in\r\n  order to draw on the LC provided by the buyer.  This arrangement entails risk\r\n  to the buyer, who is vulnerable to loss should the seller present fraudulent\r\n  documents or deliberately ship nonconforming goods.  Nevertheless, the\r\n  usefulness of a letter of credit depends on its being the virtual equivalent of\r\n  cash.  The judicial doctrine that has developed around letters of credit\r\n  reflects courts’ understanding of this background and the importance to\r\n  commerce of respecting the terms of this financial instrument so that it\r\n  remains available as a reliable means of shifting financial risk.  \r\nSpecifically, this understanding is embodied in the\r\n  independence principle, under which courts recognize that the obligations\r\n  created in the letter of credit are independent of the obligations of the\r\n  underlying contract.  See, e.g., Intraworld Industries, Inc. v.\r\n    Girard Trust Bank, 461 Pa. 343, 357, 336 A.2d 316, 323 (Pa. 1975) (“The\r\n  primary purpose of a letter of credit is to provide assurance to the seller of\r\n  goods . . . of prompt payment upon presentation of documents. A seller who\r\n  would otherwise have only the solvency and good faith of his buyer as assurance\r\n  of payment may, with a letter of credit, rely on the full responsibility of a\r\n  bank. Promptness is assured by the engagement of the bank to honor drafts upon\r\n  the presentation of documents. The great utility of letters of credit flows\r\n  from the independence of the issuer-bank’s engagement from the underlying\r\n  contract between beneficiary and customer. Long-standing case law has\r\n  established that, unless otherwise agreed, the issuer deals only in documents.\r\n  If the documents presented conform to the requirements of the credit, the\r\n  issuer may and must honor demands for payment, regardless of whether the goods\r\n  conform to the underlying contract between beneficiary and customer.”); Itek\r\n    Corp. v. First Nat’l Bank of Boston, 730 F.2d 19 (1st Cir. 1984) (Breyer,\r\n  J.) (“Parties to a contract may use a letter of credit in order to make certain\r\n  that contractual disputes wend their way towards resolution with money in the\r\n  beneficiary’s pocket rather than in the pocket of the contracting party. Thus,\r\n  courts typically have asserted that such letters of credit are ‘independent’ of\r\n  the underlying contract. . . . And they have recognized that examining the\r\n  rights and wrongs of a contract dispute to determine whether a letter of credit\r\n  should be paid risks depriving its beneficiary of the very advantage for which\r\n  he bargained, namely that the dispute would be resolved while he is in\r\n  possession of the money.” (citations omitted)); Roger J. Johns and Mark S.\r\n    Blodgett, Fairness at the Expense of Commercial Certainty: The International\r\n    Emergence of Unconscionability and Illegality As Exceptions to the Independence\r\n    Principle of Letters of Credit and Bank Guarantees, 31 N. Ill. U. L. Rev. 297, 309 (2011) (“[T]he\r\n  common concern among all stakeholders is that as the ease with which letters of\r\n  credit . . . can be enjoined increases their commercial utility decreases.”).\r\nNevertheless, courts have carved out a very narrow exception\r\n  to the independence principle.  Aside from permitting the intermediary bank to\r\n  refuse to honor forged documents presented in order to draw on the letter of\r\n  credit, courts enjoin the payment of LCs for “fraud in the transaction” when\r\n  “the beneficiary’s conduct has so vitiated the entire transaction that the\r\n  legitimate purposes of the independence of the issuer’s obligation would no\r\n  longer be served.”  Itek, 730 F.2d at 25 (internal quotation marks and\r\n  citations omitted).  \r\nPut simply, the cases in which the “fraud in the\r\n  transaction” exception has been applied are those in which the underlying\r\n  transaction or the demand for payment is clearly a sham, and it is apparent\r\n  that rigid adherence to the independence principle would facilitate what\r\n  amounts to a scheme to defraud.  In the case that established the fraud in the\r\n  transaction exception, the beneficiary made an actual shipment so that the\r\n  shipping documents were real, but substituted “rubbish” in place of salable\r\n  bristles.  Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., 177 Misc. 719, 31\r\n  N.Y.S.2d 631 (Sup. Ct. 1941).  In another leading case, the beneficiary was not\r\n  permitted to collect on the LC because the fall of the Iranian government so\r\n  altered conditions that the contract for military equipment could not be\r\n  completed, and thus there was no possibility that the original purpose of the\r\n  transaction of which the LC was a part could be accomplished.  In addition, no\r\n  other legal recourse was available to the applicant, and the applicant had\r\n  cancelled the underlying contract in compliance with its force majeure\r\n  provisions, which called for cancellation of the LC upon cancellation of the\r\n  underlying contract.  Itek, supra.  \r\nSeveral other cases also illustrate the narrowness of the fraud\r\n  in the transaction exception.  See Intraworld Industries, Inc. v.\r\n    Girard Trust Bank, 461 Pa. 343, 357, 336 A.2d 316, 361 (Pa. 1975) (“We\r\n  conclude that, if the documents presented by [the beneficiary of the LC] are\r\n  genuine in the sense of having some basis in fact, an injunction must be\r\n  refused. . . . [N]either the trial court nor this Court may attempt to\r\n  determine [the beneficiary’s] actual entitlement to payment under the lease.”); see also Roman Ceramics Corp. v. Peoples Nat. Bank, 714 F.2d\r\n  1207, 1209 (3d Cir. 1983) (permitting issuing bank to dishonor LC when it knew\r\n  underlying invoice had been paid and that contrary certification was false); Dynamics\r\n    Corp. of Am. v. Citizens &amp; S. Nat. Bank, 356 F.Supp. 991, 999 (D.C. Ga.\r\n  1973) (describing court’s role as limited to ensuring that the defendant could\r\n  not “run off with plaintiff’s money on a pro forma declaration which has\r\n  absolutely no basis in fact”); Mid-America Tire, Inc. v. PTZ Trading Ltd.,\r\n  95 Ohio 367, 392, 768 N.E.2d 619, 641 (Ohio 2002) (affirming injunction against\r\n  honor of LC where defendants repeatedly lied to and misled plaintiffs about the\r\n  tires available for sale in order to pressure them into making the LC available\r\n  before they “could discover the truth”).\r\nThe Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) incorporated this\r\n  judicially developed doctrine into Article 5, the UCC formulation of the law\r\n  governing letters of credit.  Thus, South Carolina’s adoption of the UCC\r\n  incorporated into South Carolina law the same independence principle and narrow\r\n  exception limiting the enjoinment of payment of LCs to instances of egregious\r\n  fraud that operates to vitiate the entire transaction.  In particular, UCC\r\n  Article 5, S.C. Code §§ 36-5-101 through -119, governs letters of credit.  S.C.\r\n  Code Ann. § 36-5-109(b) (2003) sets forth the conditions under which a court\r\n  may enjoin honor of a letter of credit as follows, in relevant part:\r\n\r\nIf an applicant claims\r\n  that a required document is forged or materially fraudulent or that honor of\r\n  the presentation would facilitate a material fraud by the beneficiary on the\r\n  issuer or applicant, a court of competent jurisdiction may temporarily or\r\n  permanently enjoin the issuer from honoring a presentation or grant similar\r\n  relief against the issuer or other persons only if the court finds that:\r\n. . .\r\n(3) all of the\r\n  conditions to entitle a person to the relief under the law of this State have\r\n  been met; and\r\n(4) on the basis of the information\r\n  submitted to the court, the applicant is more likely than not to succeed under\r\n  its claim of forgery or material fraud . . . .\r\n\r\nFor purposes of a preliminary\r\n  injunction, subsection (3) effectively incorporates the requirements of the\r\n  common law related to injunctions generally: that the movant show that\r\n  irreparable harm will result and that no adequate remedy at law exists if the\r\n  court refuses the injunction.  Poynter Investments, supra.  \r\nSubsection (4) codifies not only\r\n  the general common law requirement that the movant show a likelihood of success\r\n  on the merits but also the special rule for letters of credit allowing only a\r\n  narrow exception for fraud in the transaction, as discussed above.  The\r\n  Official Comment makes this codification explicit.[3] \r\nIn the present case, Hook Point\r\n  argues that BB&amp;T is not entitled to draw on the LC because the commitment\r\n  letter described the LC as “to be used as last resort for interest carry.” \r\n  Hook Point also seeks to construe as fraudulent BB&amp;T’s demand on the LC.  The\r\n  LC, however, by its terms requires only that BB&amp;T represent that “[t]he\r\n  Borrower has failed to perform its obligations . . . under the Loan Agreement\r\n  and Promissory Note” and that “[t]he amount of the draft does not exceed the\r\n  amount due to the Beneficiary under the obligation.”  Thus, contrary to Hook\r\n  Point’s arguments, the plain language of the LC permitted BB&amp;T to use it if\r\n  Hook Point defaulted under any obligation of the loan agreement and note,\r\n  including an acceleration clause.  Furthermore, no term in the loan agreement\r\n  or note to which the LC refers limits BB&amp;T’s use of the LC to interest\r\n  due.  Thus, it is incontrovertible that BB&amp;T had some basis in fact for the\r\n  representations it made when it drew on the LC.  \r\nIf there is any validity to Hook\r\n  Point’s argument that the commitment letter limited the utilization of the LC\r\n  exclusively to interest, that is an ordinary contract dispute that raises no implication\r\n  of fraud by BB&amp;T sufficient to trigger the narrow fraud exception.  Dynamics\r\n    Corp., supra.  In fact, $500,000 had been reserved by BB&amp;T from\r\n  the original $5.1 million loan for the purpose of drawing down interest carry. \r\n  A more plausible explanation for the “last resort” language in the commitment\r\n  letter is that it was intended merely as an accommodation to the principals\r\n  that BB&amp;T would not seek to draw on the LC for interest until the reserve\r\n  had been exhausted.  That language, whatever it meant, is a red herring in this\r\n  case as the draw on the LC was sought not only to recoup interest but as a\r\n  result of multiple defaults that caused BB&amp;T to invoke the acceleration of\r\n  the entire debt.\r\nIndeed, Hook Point’s admission that\r\n  BB&amp;T was entitled to any draw on the LC for past due interest was\r\n  conclusive as to the issue whether honor of the LC should be enjoined, since BB&amp;T’s\r\n  entitlement to past due interest is alone some basis in fact on which BB&amp;T could\r\n  demand payment under the LC.  Moreover, the strict standard required under §\r\n  36-5-109(b)(4) is that the alleged fraud vitiate the entire transaction, that\r\n  is, it deprives Hook Point of any benefit from the transaction.  In this case, there\r\n  is no dispute that Hook Point received $5.1 million from BB&amp;T.  These facts\r\n  hardly parallel the receipt of “rubbish” instead of bargained-for salable bristles.  See Sztejn v. J. Henry Schroder Banking Corp., supra.\r\nThus, there is no evidence Hook\r\n  Point is more likely than not to succeed on a claim of material fraud so\r\n  egregious as to vitiate the entire transaction as required under §\r\n  36-5-109(b)(4), and the circuit court failed to evaluate the evidence under the\r\n  strict standard required for injunctions against the honor of LCs.  Under the\r\n  proper standard, it is clear that BB&amp;T had a sufficient basis in fact upon\r\n  which to demand payment under the LC.  Thus, the circuit court’s finding was\r\n  based upon an error of law.\r\nBecause this issue is dispositive\r\n  of the case, we need not address BB&amp;T’s remaining issues.  Rule 220(b),\r\n  SCACR; e.g., Futch v. McAllister Towing of Georgetown, Inc., 335\r\n  S.C. 598, 613, 518 S.E.2d 591, 598 (1999).\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe standard under which a fraud in the transaction claim\r\n  must be measured when deciding whether to enjoin honor of a letter of credit\r\n  requires that the beneficiary have no colorable claim or basis in fact for\r\n  asserting its rights under the letter of credit.  In this case BB&amp;T has, in\r\n  our view, not only a colorable claim but an undeniable basis in fact for\r\n  asserting its rights under the letter of credit.  Therefore, the circuit court\r\n  erred when it granted the preliminary injunction.  REVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, HEARN, JJ., and Acting Justice James\r\n  E. Moore, concur.\r\n\r\n[1] A person who applies for a letter of credit is the applicant (in this case,\r\n  Hook Point).  The bank that issues the LC on behalf of the applicant is the\r\n  issuer (First Reliance Bank).  The entity that has the right to draw on the LC\r\n  is the beneficiary (BB&amp;T).\r\n[2] Courts do not distinguish between types of LCs for purposes of analyzing\r\n  whether a court should grant an injunction against honoring them.  See New\r\n    York Life Ins. Co. v. Hartford Nat’l Bank &amp; Trust Co., 173 Conn. 492,\r\n  499-500, 378 A.2d 562, 566 (Conn. 1977).\r\n[3] The Official Comment states:\r\n\r\nMaterial fraud by the beneficiary occurs only\r\n  when the beneficiary has no colorable right to expect honor and where there is\r\n  no basis in fact to support such a right to honor. The section indorses\r\n  articulations such as those stated in Intraworld Indus. v. Girard Trust Bank,\r\n  336 A.2d 316 (Pa. 1975), Roman Ceramics Corp. v. People’s Nat. Bank, 714 F.2d\r\n  1207 (3d Cir. 1983), and similar decisions and embraces certain decisions under\r\n  Section 5-114 that relied upon the phrase “fraud in the transaction.” Some of these\r\n  decisions have been summarized as follows in Ground Air Transfer v. Westate’s\r\n  Airlines, 899 F.2d 1269, 1272-73 (1st Cir. 1990):\r\nWe have said throughout that courts\r\n  may not “normally” issue an injunction because of an important exception to the\r\n  general “no injunction” rule. The exception, as we also explained in Itek, 730\r\n  F.2d at 24-25, concerns “fraud” so serious as to make it obviously pointless\r\n  and unjust to permit the beneficiary to obtain the money.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and C. Tex\r\n  Davis, Jr., Senior Assistant Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.  \r\nKenneth Gary Cooper, of Summerville, pro se Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary action, the Commission\r\n  on Lawyer Conduct (&quot;the Commission&quot;) considered Formal Charges filed\r\n  against attorney Kenneth Gary Cooper (&quot;Respondent&quot;) alleging\r\n  misconduct in four matters.  A Hearing Panel of the Commission found Respondent\r\n  had admitted all of the factual allegations in his Answer to the Formal Charges\r\n  and that the sanctionable misconduct was the result of Respondent's alcoholism\r\n  and addiction to prescription drugs.\r\nThe Hearing Panel recommends\r\n  that Respondent receive an Admonition, be ordered to pay the costs of the\r\n  disciplinary proceedings, and be required to enter into a contract with\r\n  Lawyers' Helping Lawyers (&quot;LHL&quot;) and to file quarterly treatment\r\n  compliance reports with the Commission for a period of three years.  Neither\r\n  Respondent nor the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (&quot;the ODC&quot;) has\r\n  filed a brief taking exception to the Panel Report.  We suspend Respondent from\r\n  the practice of law for a period of six (6) months with conditions as\r\n  recommended by the Panel.\r\nI.&nbsp; Factual/Procedural History\r\nA.&nbsp;  Background\r\nRespondent was admitted to the\r\n  practice of law in South Carolina on November 18, 1997.  The ODC filed Formal\r\n  Charges against Respondent on September 21, 2010, alleging misconduct in the\r\n  following four matters:\r\n1.&nbsp; Connor Matter (03-1280)\r\nOn May 31, 2003, Client was arrested and charged with an\r\n  open container and simple possession of marijuana.  On June 16, 2003, Client\r\n  appeared in court and requested a jury trial.  Although Client identified his\r\n  attorney as &quot;Milton Stratoes,&quot; Client did not provide an address for\r\n  Stratoes.  It was later discovered that Client had never retained Stratoes as\r\n  his attorney.  Subsequently, the court forwarded two copies of all documents to\r\n  Client's address so that one copy could be provided to Client's counsel. \r\n  Client did not appear for his scheduled trial and was ultimately tried in his\r\n  absence and found guilty.\r\nShortly thereafter, Client hired Respondent to\r\n  represent him.  In turn, Respondent requested a new trial on Client's behalf.  After\r\n  this motion was denied, Respondent faxed a Notice of Intent to Appeal to the\r\n  court.  Respondent, however, never filed the Notice of Appeal with the clerk's\r\n  office and never notified the court that he would not pursue the appeal.  The\r\n  presiding magistrate reported the incident to the ODC.  \r\nIn explaining his actions, Respondent testified the\r\n  Client &quot;never came back and he never retained me after I went ahead and\r\n  notified the judge that I wanted to reopen the case.&quot;  Respondent further\r\n  stated that he &quot;just kind of forgot about not notifying the court to\r\n  withdraw the stuff that I had done to reopen the case.&quot;\r\n2.&nbsp; Self-Report Matter (04-379)\r\nOn March 23, 2004, Respondent was arrested for\r\n  Criminal Domestic Violence of a High and Aggravated Nature (&quot;CDVHAN&quot;)[1] based on an altercation between Respondent and his girlfriend.  At the time of\r\n  the incident, Respondent and his girlfriend began living together on and off\r\n  for several months after separating from their respective spouses.  Respondent\r\n  testified the charge arose out of his girlfriend's claim that Respondent\r\n  &quot;touched her [and] threw her down&quot; during an argument.  Although\r\n  Respondent admitted that he argued with his girlfriend, he denied ever\r\n  &quot;touching&quot; her.  Respondent, however, took &quot;full responsibility&quot;\r\n  for the situation.  Respondent attributed his actions to his addiction to\r\n  alcohol and prescription drugs.  \r\nOn November 5, 2004, Respondent was accepted into the\r\n  Pre-Trial Intervention (&quot;PTI&quot;) program.  He successfully completed\r\n  this program on August 9, 2005. \r\nIn another criminal matter, Respondent pled guilty on\r\n  April 9, 2010 to possession of unlawful prescription drugs, first offense.[2] \r\n  The offense, which occurred between May 8, 2008 and August 15, 2008, stemmed\r\n  from Respondent knowingly obtaining a quantity of Oxycodone (a schedule II\r\n  controlled substance) from two separate practitioners.  Respondent failed to\r\n  inform the practitioners that he had received prescriptions for drugs of like\r\n  therapeutic use in a concurrent time period from another practitioner.\r\nAs a result of his conviction, Respondent was\r\n  sentenced to a term of six months' imprisonment, which was suspended without\r\n  the imposition of probation.  Respondent, however, was assessed costs and\r\n  ordered to complete substance abuse counseling and consent to random drug\r\n  testing. \r\n3.&nbsp; Self-Report Matter (05-1490)\r\nOn November 9, 2005, Respondent was charged with one\r\n  count of trespassing,[3] two counts of simple assault,[4] and one count of pointing and presenting a firearm.[5]  \r\nThe charges arose out of Respondent's attempted\r\n  intervention into the relationship between his fifteen-year-old son and his\r\n  son's girlfriend.  According to Respondent, his son ran away from home to stay\r\n  at his girlfriend's home.  When Respondent went to the girlfriend's home in\r\n  search of his son, an argument ensued that resulted in the girlfriend's parents\r\n  initiating a charge of trespassing against Respondent.  A few days later, while\r\n  still looking for his son, Respondent got into an argument with the girlfriend's\r\n  parents, which resulted in the simple assault charges.  Following this\r\n  incident, the girlfriend alleged that Respondent pointed a gun at her when he\r\n  was inquiring about his son's whereabouts.  \r\nOn June 2, 2008, Respondent pled guilty to a charge of\r\n  trespass and disorderly conduct.  The remaining charges were nolle prossed. \r\n4.&nbsp; Wolfe Matter (08-809)\r\nIn April 2008, Respondent was appointed to represent Complainant\r\n  through his contract with the Dorchester County Public Defender's office.  During\r\n  the case, Respondent received discovery materials from the solicitor's office.  While\r\n  in court on another matter, Respondent was approached by Complainant's\r\n  cellmate. The cellmate informed Respondent that Complainant wanted Respondent\r\n  to send the discovery materials via the cellmate.  Respondent complied with the\r\n  request and gave the discovery materials to the cellmate.  Respondent did not\r\n  have written permission from Complainant instructing him to give the discovery\r\n  materials to the cellmate and had not spoken directly with Complainant\r\n  regarding this transmission.  After Respondent's contract with the Public\r\n  Defender's office expired on June 30, 2008, new counsel was appointed to\r\n  represent Complainant.   Respondent admitted that his actions were improper.  \r\nB.&nbsp;&nbsp;  Hearing Panel's Report\r\nAfter conducting a hearing on\r\n  July 14, 2011, the Panel issued its report on October 25, 2011.  The Hearing\r\n  Panel found Respondent &quot;basically admitted all of the allegations in the\r\n  Formal Charges&quot; in his Answer to the Formal Charges.  \r\n1.&nbsp; Findings of Misconduct\r\nThe Hearing Panel found that Respondent's admitted\r\n  acts constituted misconduct and that he had violated the following Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (&quot;RPC&quot;) contained in Rule 407, SCACR:  Rule 1.3\r\n  (&quot;A lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and promptness in\r\n  representing a client.&quot;); Rule 1.6(a) (&quot;A lawyer shall not reveal\r\n  information relating to the representation of a client unless the client gives\r\n  informed consent, the disclosure is impliedly authorized in order to carry out\r\n  the representation or the disclosure is permitted by paragraph (b).&quot;); Rule\r\n  8.4(a) (&quot;It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate or attempt\r\n  to violate the Rules of Professional Conduct, knowingly assist or induce\r\n  another to do so, or do so through the acts of another.&quot;); Rule 8.4(b)\r\n  (&quot;It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to commit a criminal act that\r\n  reflects adversely on the lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness as a\r\n  lawyer in other respects.&quot;); Rule 8.4(e) (&quot;It is professional misconduct\r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice.&quot;).\r\nAdditionally, the Hearing Panel concluded Respondent's\r\n  conduct constituted grounds for discipline under the following provisions of\r\n  the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (&quot;RLDE&quot;) contained in\r\n  Rule 413, SCACR:   Rule 7(a)(1) (&quot;It shall be a ground for discipline for\r\n  a lawyer to violate or attempt to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR, or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers.&quot;); Rule 7(a)(5) (&quot;It shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the\r\n  administration of justice or to bring the courts or the legal profession into\r\n  disrepute or conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law.&quot;).\r\n2.&nbsp; Aggravating and Mitigating\r\n  Factors\r\nIn aggravation, the Hearing Panel considered that\r\n  Respondent had committed several criminal offenses over an extended period of\r\n  time.  Specifically, the Panel noted that Respondent:  (1) was charged with\r\n  CDVHAN in 2004; (2) pled guilty to trespass and disorderly conduct in June\r\n  2008; and (3) pled guilty to possession of unlawful prescription drugs in April\r\n  2010.  \r\nIn mitigation, the Panel noted that Respondent had no\r\n  prior disciplinary history and had a &quot;cooperative attitude&quot;\r\n  throughout the proceedings.  Additionally, the Panel took into consideration\r\n  that Respondent admitted he is an alcoholic and prescription drug addict and\r\n  that Respondent attributed his misconduct to that addiction.  The Panel also\r\n  recognized that Respondent was sober from January 1991 through July 2001, but thereafter\r\n  experienced a relapse that lasted for several years, during which time this\r\n  misconduct occurred.  \r\nThe Panel further found that Respondent's addiction to\r\n  alcohol and drugs was the causative factor in his misconduct.  Accordingly, the\r\n  Panel considered Respondent's subsequent rehabilitation as a factor in\r\n  mitigation.  In support of this finding, the Panel referenced the testimony of\r\n  William B. Waters and J. Robert Turnbull, Jr.\r\nWaters stated that he had known Respondent for\r\n  approximately forty years.  He testified that in June 2009 he received a\r\n  telephone call from Respondent during which Respondent confided that he was\r\n  addicted to prescription drugs.  Waters further testified that he has remained\r\n  close with Respondent throughout his recovery period and is confident that\r\n  Respondent is currently sober.  \r\nTurnbull, who is the Director of LHL, testified that\r\n  Respondent has been in frequent contact with him since June 2009 when\r\n  Respondent called and admitted his prescription drug problem.  Turnbull\r\n  testified he believed Respondent is sober and that his rehabilitation is going\r\n  well.  He further testified that Respondent is willing to enter into a contract\r\n  with LHL so that his continued rehabilitation can be monitored.  \r\n3.&nbsp; Recommended Sanction\r\nThe Hearing Panel recommended that Respondent:  (1)\r\n  receive an Admonition; (2) be ordered to pay the costs of the proceedings; and\r\n  (3) be required to enter into a contract with LHL and to file quarterly\r\n  treatment compliance reports with the Commission for a period of three years.  \r\nII.&nbsp; Discussion\r\nA.&nbsp; Standard of Review\r\nThis Court has the sole authority to discipline\r\n  attorneys and to decide the appropriate sanction after a thorough review of the\r\n  record.  In re Welch, 355 S.C. 93, 96, 584 S.E.2d 369, 370 (2003). \r\n  &quot;The Court is not bound by the panel's recommendation and may make its own\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.&quot;&nbsp; In re Hazzard, 377\r\n  S.C. 482, 488, 661 S.E.2d 102, 106&nbsp;(2008).  &quot;Although this Court is\r\n  not bound by the findings of the Panel and Committee, these findings are\r\n  entitled to great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the\r\n  testimony depend on the credibility of the witnesses.&quot;  In re Marshall,\r\n  331 S.C. 514, 519, 498 S.E.2d 869, 871 (1998); see In re Longtin,\r\n  393 S.C. 368, 376, 713 S.E.2d 297, 301 (2011) (&quot;[T]he findings and\r\n  conclusions of the Panel are entitled much respect and consideration.&quot;).\r\nB.&nbsp; Imposition of Sanction\r\nThe parties, by not filing briefs, have accepted the\r\n  findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations of the Hearing\r\n  Panel.  Rule 27(a), RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR.  Thus, this Court must determine\r\n  whether the recommended sanction is appropriate.\r\nWe recognize that, throughout these proceedings,\r\n  Respondent has been cooperative, admitted to his misconduct, and taken\r\n  &quot;full responsibility&quot; for his actions.  Respondent self-reported two\r\n  of the four allegations of misconduct and has actively sought treatment for his\r\n  alcohol and prescription drug addiction.  He also offered evidence that he\r\n  completed an intensive outpatient drug treatment program and is now sober.  \r\nHowever, because Respondent's misconduct involved\r\n  multiple criminal offenses, the disclosure of confidential client information,\r\n  and the failure to diligently pursue an appeal, we find a six (6) month definite\r\n  suspension from the practice of law is warranted.  See In re Ervin,\r\n  387 S.C. 551, 694 S.E.2d 6 (2010) (finding attorney's involvement in a\r\n  &quot;road rage&quot; incident resulting in his arrest for pointing and\r\n  presenting a firearm warranted a six-month suspension retroactive to the date\r\n  of his interim suspension); In re Brown, 387 S.C. 305, 692 S.E.2d 536\r\n  (2010) (concluding that six-month suspension was appropriate where attorney's\r\n  admitted misconduct arose out of his abuse of alcohol); In re Green, 371\r\n  S.C. 506, 640 S.E.2d 463 (2007) (imposing a six-month suspension, which was\r\n  retroactive to the date of attorney's interim suspension, where attorney:  (1)\r\n  pled guilty to DUI of methamphetamine; (2) was arrested for possession of\r\n  methamphetamine, but pled guilty to disorderly conduct; (3) was arrested for\r\n  DUI of drugs and possession of methamphetamine but completed PTI).\r\nIn addition to the suspension, we order Respondent to\r\n  pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings and to enter into a contract\r\n  with LHL and to file quarterly treatment compliance reports with the Commission\r\n  for a period of three years.  See In re Atwater, 385 S.C. 257, 262,\r\n  684 S.E.2d 557, 559 (2009) (&quot;The imposition of\r\n  costs and the determination of their amount are within this Court's\r\n  discretion.&quot;); Rule 27(e)(3), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (&quot;The Supreme\r\n  Court may assess costs against the respondent if it finds the respondent has\r\n  committed misconduct.&quot;); Rule 7(b)(6), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR (stating\r\n  sanctions for misconduct may include the &quot;assessment of the costs of the\r\n  proceedings, including the cost of hearings, investigations, prosecution,\r\n  service of process and court reporter services&quot;); see also In re\r\n    Newton, 366 S.C. 276, 621 S.E.2d 657 (2005) (adding a two-year monitoring\r\n  contract with LHL and the taking of the new attorney oath as conditions of attorney's\r\n  reinstatement).\r\nIII.&nbsp; Conclusion\r\nWe find that Respondent's misconduct warrants a\r\n  suspension from the practice of law for a period of six (6) months from the\r\n  date of this opinion.  Additionally, within thirty (30) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, Respondent shall (1) pay the costs of these disciplinary proceedings\r\n  in the amount of $895.71, and (2) enter into a contract with LHL and file\r\n  quarterly treatment compliance reports with the Commission for a period of\r\n  three years.  \r\nWithin fifteen (15) days of the date of\r\n  this opinion, Respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court\r\n  showing that he has complied with the requirements of Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR (regarding an attorney's duties following suspension or disbarment).\r\n\r\n    DEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., PLEICONES, BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]   S.C.

Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel,\r\n  and Barbara M. Seymour, Deputy  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nMichael E. Atwater, of Rock Hill, pro se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  After receiving a complaint from Edward Boulware that his case\r\n  went nearly ten years without resolution, the\r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) conducted an investigation and filed\r\n  formal charges against his attorney, Michael Atwater.  Following a hearing, a\r\n  Panel from the Commission on Lawyer Conduct found Atwater violated various\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct and recommended Atwater receive an admonition and\r\n  pay the costs of the proceedings.  ODC took exception to the Panel's report,\r\n  arguing it should have found Atwater violated additional Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct.  Additionally, ODC argues a sanction harsher than an admonition is\r\n  warranted.  We agree.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nI.&nbsp; BOULWARE MATTER\r\nShortly after a water main adjacent to Boulware's\r\n  property ruptured in January 2000, Boulware retained Atwater to bring a suit\r\n  against the City of Rock Hill.  At their initial meeting and in the following\r\n  months, Boulware provided Atwater with several documents related to this\r\n  matter, including estimates of the damage, pictures of the flooding, Boulware's\r\n  recent tax returns, and the City's letter rejecting Boulware's claim.  With\r\n  this information in hand, Atwater filed a complaint against the City in May\r\n  2000.  In February 2001, the water main broke again and flooded Boulware's\r\n  property a second time.  Atwater accordingly filed an amended complaint\r\n  reflecting this additional damage.  \r\nAt this stage, it is undisputed that Atwater engaged\r\n  in at least some discovery. For example, he responded to interrogatories and\r\n  requests for production from opposing counsel, and he deposed and interviewed\r\n  various witnesses.  By the time the case was called for trial in June 2003,\r\n  Atwater believed he had enough evidence to move forward and try the case. \r\n  However, just as the case was called for trial, it was removed from the circuit\r\n  court docket and set for binding arbitration.  The matter was scheduled to be\r\n  arbitrated in 2003, and Atwater met with Boulware to prepare an arbitration\r\n  packet in anticipation of the proceeding.  \r\nThis arbitration ultimately fell through.  Atwater's\r\n  work on the matter subsequently diminished precipitously, and he never resolved\r\n  the case.  Atwater's main contention as to why he was unable to proceed was a\r\n  lack of evidence to support Boulware's claims.  However, in the six and a half\r\n  years after the case was to be arbitrated, Atwater interviewed at most only a\r\n  handful of witnesses, took just a few depositions, and only visited the\r\n  property three times.  Rather than actively investigating Boulware's claims\r\n  himself, Atwater instead primarily relied on Boulware to come forward with\r\n  evidence on his own initiative.  \r\nAs a prime example, Atwater's chief evidentiary\r\n  concern was a lack of proof as to the damages Boulware incurred.[1] \r\n  However, he never asked Boulware for copies of the cancelled checks he wrote\r\n  for repairs to substantiate his claim of damages.  It was not until opposing\r\n  counsel requested them in 2005, five years after the flooding, that Atwater\r\n  received them.  Only then did Atwater ask Boulware for more information about\r\n  his expenditures.  Unfortunately, Boulware was unable to provide anything more\r\n  specific to Atwater because so much time had passed since he wrote the checks;\r\n  had Atwater told him to keep better records from the start, Boulware testified\r\n  he would have done so.  Furthermore, Atwater never had his own estimate of\r\n  Boulware's damages performed despite his reservations about the estimate\r\n  Boulware provided.[2]\r\nAlso during these six and a half years, the evidence\r\n  before us shows Atwater sent only a few letters and e-mails, and made only a\r\n  few telephone calls, to Boulware. Atwater testified, however, that he was\r\n  routinely in contact with Boulware and many of his meetings also were in\r\n  person.  On the other hand, Boulware offered copies of his telephone records to\r\n  show the numerous calls he made to Atwater, the vast majority of which Boulware\r\n  claims went unanswered or unreturned.[3] \r\n  In fact, Boulware wrote multiple e-mails and letters to Atwater expressing his\r\n  frustration in reaching his attorney and the slow progress of his case.[4]  \r\nOver the years, the settlement offers tendered by the\r\n  City ranged from $15,000 to $22,000, with an assurance that the City could go\r\n  up to $25,000 if necessary.  Boulware rejected each of these, claiming he\r\n  needed at least $30,000 to adequately cover the necessary repairs.  Also during\r\n  this time period, the matter was set to be arbitrated on at least three\r\n  different occasions, each of which fell through.[5] Unsatisfied with Atwater's progress on his case after eight years, Boulware\r\n  requested his file from Atwater in 2008.  He made a second request a few months\r\n  later and copied ODC in his letter.  In the fall of 2009, when Atwater was\r\n  suspended by this Court in another matter,[6] Boulware retained a different attorney to handle his case.  He settled the case\r\n  seven months later for $22,000, claiming this sum was now acceptable only\r\n  because the age of the case had diminished its value.  ODC subsequently filed\r\n  formal charges against Atwater.\r\nII.&nbsp; PANEL REPORT\r\nBased on the foregoing, the Panel concluded Atwater violated\r\n  the following Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: Rule 1.1\r\n  (competence); Rule 1.3 (diligence and promptness); and Rule 3.2 (duty to\r\n  expedite litigation).  However, the Panel found ODC had not set forth clear and\r\n  convincing evidence that Atwater violated Rule 1.2 (scope of representation and\r\n  allocation of authority), Rule 1.4 (communication), Rule 3.1 (meritorious\r\n  claims and contentions), and 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial to the administration\r\n  of justice), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.  \r\nIn particular, the Panel found Atwater violated Rule\r\n  1.1 by exhibiting a lack of thoroughness and preparation.  While the Panel did\r\n  note that Atwater possesses the necessary legal skill and knowledge to practice\r\n  law, it nevertheless found his lack of investigation and preparation\r\n  constituted a violation of Rule 1.1.\r\nAs to Rules 1.3 and 3.2, the Panel similarly found\r\n  that Atwater failed to diligently prosecute the claims he brought on Boulware's\r\n  behalf.  While the Panel agreed that some delays are inevitable and outside of\r\n  an attorney's control, it was extremely concerned with Atwater's refusal to\r\n  accept any responsibility for the numerous delays that caused a case\r\n  &quot;uncomplicated both factually and legally&quot; to drag on for nearly ten\r\n  years.  As the Panel found, there was much Atwater could have done to advance\r\n  the matter even if there were obstacles to his progress along the way. \r\n  Although Atwater maintained he thoroughly investigated the case, the Panel\r\n  found no evidence to support this contention and resolved this credibility\r\n  issue in favor of Boulware.\r\nWith respect to Rules 1.2 and 1.4, the Panel noted\r\n  there was a factual dispute as to the extent Atwater maintained contact with\r\n  Boulware.  In the end, the Panel found credible Atwater's testimony that he\r\n  routinely discussed the case with Boulware in person and over the telephone. \r\n  Atwater's &quot;shortcoming,&quot; according to the Panel, was instead with\r\n  &quot;his failure to adequately document his client file to reflect those\r\n  discussions and meetings.&quot;  The Panel therefore found ODC failed to meet\r\n  its burden in proving Atwater violated Rules 1.2 and 1.4.\r\nAs to Rule 3.1 regarding meritorious claims and\r\n  contentions, the Panel summarily found ODC presented no evidence as to any\r\n  violation of this rule.  In a similarly summary fashion, the Panel also\r\n  concluded that Atwater's conduct did not violate Rule 8.4(e) and therefore was\r\n  not prejudicial to the administration of justice.  \r\nIn aggravation, the Panel considered Atwater's failure\r\n  to acknowledge any wrongdoing, his prior disciplinary history, and his pattern\r\n  of misconduct.  First, as noted previously, Atwater failed to take any\r\n  responsibility for the delays in prosecuting Boulware's case, instead laying\r\n  the blame primarily on Boulware for not coming forward with evidence on his own\r\n  and other individuals for cancelling the scheduled arbitrations.  \r\nWith respect to Atwater's prior history, he has been\r\n  sanctioned twice in the past for misconduct.  In 2003, he received a public\r\n  reprimand for violating Rules 1.1; 1.3; 1.4(b); 1.5(b)-(c) (fee agreements);\r\n  3.2; 3.3(a) (making false statements of material fact); 3.7 (lawyer acting as a\r\n  witness at trial); 8.1 (making false statements of material fact in connection\r\n  with disciplinary proceedings); 8.4(d) (engaging in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation); and 8.4(e), RPC, Rule 407,\r\n  SCACR. In re Atwater, 355 S.C. 620, 625-27, 586 S.E.2d 589, 592 (2003) (Atwater\r\n    I).  Additionally, Atwater received a six-month definite suspension in 2009\r\n  for multiple violations of Rule 8.1(b), RPC, Rule 407, SCACR (failing to\r\n  cooperate with ODC).[7] Atwater II, 385 S.C. at 262, 684 S.E.2d at 559-60.\r\nOf particular concern to the Panel were Atwater's\r\n  actions in Atwater I.  In that case, among other things, Atwater failed\r\n  to respond to the opposing party's motion for summary judgment. Atwater I,\r\n  355 S.C. at 623, 586 S.E.2d at 591.  As a result, his client's claims were\r\n  dismissed. See id.  The Panel accordingly viewed his prior dilatory\r\n  representation as demonstrating a pattern of misconduct.  Furthermore, Atwater\r\n  received this public reprimand in Atwater I during his representation of\r\n  Boulware, and more specifically, at the very time when he essentially ceased\r\n  working on Boulware's case.\r\nIn mitigation, the Panel considered Atwater's lack of\r\n  dishonest or selfish motive.  The Panel found that Atwater did not personally\r\n  benefit in any way from his misconduct as he took this case on contingency and\r\n  received no fees for his work.\r\nUltimately, the Panel recommended that we give Atwater\r\n  an admonition and order that he pay the costs of the proceedings.\r\nLAW/ANALYSIS\r\nODC takes exception to the Panel's report and requests\r\n  that we find Atwater violated both Rules 1.4 and 8.4(e).  In addition, ODC asks\r\n  us to impose a more severe sanction than an admonition regardless of whether\r\n  Atwater also violated Rules 1.4 and 8.4(e).  \r\n&quot;The findings of the panel are entitled to great\r\n  weight, particularly when the inferences drawn from the testimony in the record\r\n  depend largely on the credibility of the witnesses.&quot; In re Johnson,\r\n  380 S.C. 76, 80, 668 S.E.2d 416, 418 (2008).  In the end, however, we have the\r\n  sole authority to discipline attorneys for misconduct. In re Greene, 371\r\n  S.C. 207, 216, 638 S.E.2d 677, 682 (2006).  Thus, we are not bound by the\r\n  Panel's findings and recommendations, and we make our own findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law. Id.  Furthermore, we are to impose the sanction we\r\n  deem appropriate. Id.  ODC bears the burden of proving any allegation of\r\n  misconduct by clear and convincing evidence. Id.\r\nAtwater has not filed a brief taking exception to the\r\n  Panel's findings and recommendations, and he is therefore bound by them.  See Rule 27(a), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  Furthermore, we concur in the Panel's\r\n  findings that Atwater violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, and 3.2.  ODC has not taken\r\n  exception to the Panel's findings that Atwater did not violate Rules 1.2 and\r\n  3.1.  We agree with the Panel that ODC presented no evidence Atwater violated\r\n  Rule 3.1.  However, we believe the Panel's analysis of Rule 1.2 is subsumed\r\n  within ODC's challenge to the Panel's findings regarding Rule 1.4 and discuss\r\n  it below.[8]\r\nI.&nbsp; COMMUNICATION\r\nODC contends the Panel erred in finding Atwater did\r\n  not fail to adequately communicate with Boulware.  Because the Panel based this\r\n  holding on a finding that Atwater's testimony was credible, we defer to the\r\n  Panel.\r\n\r\nRule 1.4(a) states, in pertinent part,\r\nA lawyer shall\r\n  \r\n . . . .\r\n(2)&nbsp; reasonably consult with the client\r\n  about the means by which the client's objectives are to be accomplished;\r\n(3)&nbsp; keep the client reasonably\r\n  informed about the status of the matter; [and]\r\n(4)&nbsp; promptly comply with reasonable\r\n  requests for information. \r\n  \r\n\r\nRule\r\n  1.2(a) similarly requires that &quot;a lawyer shall abide by a client's\r\n  decisions concerning the objectives of representation and, as required by Rule\r\n  1.4, shall consult with the client as to the means by which they are to be\r\n  pursued.&quot;  \r\nIn our opinion, ODC has set forth a colorable claim\r\n  that Atwater violated these rules.  Throughout the hearing, Boulware detailed\r\n  his attempts to reach Atwater to discuss the case and his frequent inability to\r\n  actually do so.  Boulware bolstered his claims by providing phone records\r\n  demonstrating his efforts to contact Atwater and various letters he wrote\r\n  complaining of Atwater's failure to respond.  Additionally, Boulware\r\n  specifically instructed Atwater to proceed with the evidence he already had,\r\n  which Atwater clearly did not do.  In sum, these claims reveal a complete breakdown\r\n  of communication between Boulware and Atwater, even with Boulware's\r\n  instructions to proceed despite the perceived evidentiary deficiencies.\r\nAtwater, on the other hand, maintained he was\r\n  frequently in contact with Boulware either over the telephone or in person. \r\n  The Panel agreed, finding his testimony credible and noting that Atwater's\r\n  problem really was just a failure to adequately document these communications. \r\n  While we are troubled by ODC's allegations and the lack of a documentary record\r\n  supporting Atwater's contentions, we nevertheless give deference to the Panel's\r\n  finding that Atwater's testimony was credible.  Accordingly, we find ODC has\r\n  not submitted clear and convincing evidence to show Atwater violated Rules 1.2\r\n  and 1.4.  In the future, though, it would greatly behoove Atwater and other\r\n  members of the Bar to adequately document their communications with clients to\r\n  avoid similar problems.\r\nII.&nbsp; CONDUCT PREJUDICIAL TO THE\r\n  ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE\r\nODC next argues the Panel erred in finding Atwater did\r\n  not violate Rule 8.4(e), which prohibits engaging in conduct prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice.  We agree.\r\nOur Rules of Professional Conduct do not provide any\r\n  specific guidance as to what constitutes conduct prejudicial to the\r\n  administration of justice.  While our previous cases citing Rule 8.4(e) cover a\r\n  wide range of conduct, they do include instances where an attorney has\r\n  neglected a case he was hired to prosecute.  E.g., In re Brannon, 383\r\n  S.C. 374, 377, 680 S.E.2d 776, 777 (2009); In re Sims, 380 S.C. 61, 64,\r\n  668 S.E.2d 408, 409 (2008); In re Allen, 366 S.C. 174, 177, 621 S.E.2d\r\n  356, 358 (2005); In re Ruff, 366 S.C. 1, 5, 620 S.E.2d 323, 326 (2005); In\r\n    re Rast, 360 S.C. 96, 99, 600 S.E.2d 534, 536 (2004); In re Starks,\r\n  344 S.C. 29, 30-31, 542 S.E.2d 726, 727 (2001); see also In re\r\n    Johnson, 329 S.C. 363, 366, 495 S.E.2d 777, 779 (1998) (&quot;Respondent\r\n  has neglected legal matters entrusted to him and has engaged in conduct which\r\n  brings the legal profession into disrepute.  His conduct has been prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice and adversely reflects on his fitness to\r\n  practice law.&quot;).\r\nIn this matter, the Panel, despite concluding Atwater\r\n  did not violate Rule 8.4(e), found &quot;there is no evidence to suggest any\r\n  meaningful effort on [Atwater's] part to resolve this case&quot; after\r\n  consenting to mediation in 2003.  The Panel also concluded that &quot;[i]t is\r\n  difficult to imagine any circumstances in which such a matter would take nearly\r\n  a decade to resolve.&quot;  We completely agree and believe this finding is at\r\n  odds with the Panel's summary conclusion that Atwater did not violate Rule\r\n  8.4(e).  To use an oft-quoted phrase, justice delayed is justice denied. \r\n  Although this saying is often invoked in the criminal context, it is no less\r\n  applicable to civil cases.  The evidence before us demonstrates that Boulware\r\n  was unable to provide some of the evidence Atwater claimed was necessary for\r\n  the case as a result of Atwater's dilatory practices.  Moreover, the evidence\r\n  Boulware could have procured may have increased his eventual recovery.  Thus,\r\n  the delays Atwater occasioned prejudiced Boulware's case and potentially\r\n  reduced the damages to which he was entitled.\r\nFurthermore, &quot;[p]erhaps no professional\r\n  shortcoming is more widely resented than procrastination.&quot; Rule 1.3 cmt.3,\r\n  RPC, Rule 407, SCACR.  &quot;Even when the client's interests are not affected\r\n  in substance, however, unreasonable delay can cause a client needless anxiety\r\n  and undermine confidence in the lawyer's trustworthiness.&quot; Id.  Thus,\r\n  even without prejudice and accepting that Boulware ultimately settled the case\r\n  for the same amount Atwater could have, the amount of time Atwater spent on a\r\n  relatively simple matter itself casts a shadow over the profession.    Atwater\r\n  even continued to delay the case despite Boulware's obvious frustration with\r\n  Atwater's slow progress.  It is also particularly disconcerting to us that\r\n  Atwater claimed he was ready to proceed to trial in June 2003, while at the\r\n  same time premising his defense now on a lack of evidence to support Boulware's\r\n  claims.\r\nIn our opinion, this evidence readily demonstrates\r\n  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice.  We therefore find ODC\r\n  met its burden in proving Atwater violated Rule 8.4(e).\r\nIII.&nbsp; SANCTION\r\nIn sum, we find there is clear and convincing evidence\r\n  that Atwater violated the following Rules of Professional Conduct: Rule 1.1,\r\n  Rule 1.3, Rule 3.2, and Rule 8.4(e).  Accordingly, Atwater is subject to\r\n  discipline under the following provisions of Rule 7, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR:\r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5)\r\n  (engaging in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice and\r\n  bringing the profession into disrepute).\r\nODC takes exception to the Panel's recommendation that\r\n  we give Atwater an admonition, and we agree based on the aggravating\r\n  circumstances found by the Panel.  In particular, we share the Panel's grave\r\n  concern with respect to Atwater's failure to acknowledge any responsibility for\r\n  the delays in Boulware's case. See In re Hendricks, 319 S.C. 465, 468,\r\n  462 S.E.2d 286, 287 (1995) (noting that failure to accept personal\r\n  responsibility for conduct is an aggravating factor).  Without a doubt, delays\r\n  arise in litigation, and the fact that a case may take longer than initially\r\n  expected is simply a reality all clients must face.  In the case before us,\r\n  unquestionably there were delays and setbacks beyond Atwater's control. \r\n  Nevertheless, these do not account for failing to resolve a relatively simple\r\n  case for nearly ten years.  There were myriad other things Atwater could have\r\n  done to advance Boulware's case despite any roadblocks he may have encountered. \r\n  Alternatively, he could have withdrawn from the representation if the case\r\n  became too problematic.  In other words, he should have fished or cut bait.\r\nInstead of doing so, Atwater sporadically worked on\r\n  and investigated Boulware's claims, unnecessarily prolonging the case.  Before\r\n  this Court, just as he did before the Panel, Atwater refused to accept any responsibility\r\n  for these delays, instead finding someone else to blame for the case's slow\r\n  progress at almost every turn.  Furthermore, Atwater feigned surprise at\r\n  Boulware's complaint, claiming he never had any prior problems with Boulware despite\r\n  Boulware's numerous communications expressing his concerns.  In fact, Atwater\r\n  callously told us Boulware's complaint to ODC was just Boulware taking his\r\n  frustrations regarding the weaknesses of his case out on Atwater.[9] \r\n  This inability to recognize that he bears at least some responsibility for\r\n  failing to advance this case and letting it languish for almost a decade is cause\r\n  for great concern.  We also find it spurious for Atwater to complain of a lack\r\n  of evidence to support Boulware's case when Atwater himself never sought to\r\n  fill these gaps.\r\nAdditionally, not only does Atwater have a prior\r\n  disciplinary history, but that history reflects a pattern of similar misconduct. See In re Sturkey, 376 S.C. 286, 290, 675 S.E.2d 465, 467 (2008)\r\n  (stating panel considered prior disciplinary history and pattern of misconduct\r\n  in aggravation).  As previously noted, Atwater received a public reprimand in\r\n  2003 for violating the rules regarding competence, diligence and promptness,\r\n  expediting litigation, and conduct prejudicial to the administration of\r\n  justice. Atwater I, 355 S.C. at 625-27, 586 S.E.2d at 592.  These are\r\n  the exact same rules he violated in this case.   More troubling is the fact\r\n  that he received this public reprimand during his representation of Boulware. \r\n  Even more troubling is the fact that his work on Boulware's case began to\r\n  dwindle right after he was sanctioned for doing just that in Atwater I.\r\nIn mitigation, we do agree with the Panel that\r\n  Atwater's lack of personal gain and dishonest motive is a relevant mitigating\r\n  factor. See In re Larkin, 336 S.C. 366, 371, 520 S.E.2d 804, 806\r\n  (1999).   Nevertheless, while Atwater may not have been malintentioned, the\r\n  delays occasioned by his actions potentially prevented the discovery of relevant\r\n  evidence supporting Boulware's case.  In our opinion, this prejudice to\r\n  Boulware's case, coupled with Atwater's pattern of misconduct and inability to\r\n  accept responsibility for his actions, warrants a sanction harsher than an\r\n  admonition. \r\nUnder these facts, we find a six-month definite\r\n  suspension is appropriate. See Sims, 380 S.C. at 64-65, 668 S.E.2d at 409-10\r\n  (imposing a ninety-day suspension for violating the rules regarding diligence\r\n  and promptness, communication, expediting litigation, not responding to ODC,\r\n  and engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); In re\r\n    Sturkey, 376 S.C. 286, 291, 657 S.E.2d 465, 467-68 (2008) (finding a\r\n  nine-month suspension was warranted for failing to communicate with clients,\r\n  comply with disciplinary proceedings, and pursue litigation); In re Cabaniss,\r\n  369 S.C. 216, 218, 632 S.E.2d 280, 281 (2006) (imposing a twelve-month\r\n  suspension for violating the rules regarding competence, diligence and\r\n  expediting litigation, communication, responding to ODC investigation, and\r\n  conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); In re Davis, 352\r\n  S.C. 29, 31-32, 572 S.E.2d 285, 287 (2002) (finding a sixty-day suspension\r\n  appropriate for not providing competent representation, failing to diligently\r\n  and expeditiously pursue litigation, failing to communicate with client, and\r\n  engaging in conduct prejudicial to the administration of justice); In re\r\n    Smith, 337 S.C. 582, 586-87, 524 S.E.2d 616, 618 (1999) (ordering attorney\r\n  be suspended for twelve months when his neglect of a client matter prejudiced\r\n  client, he did not cooperate with ODC, and he had a prior disciplinary record); cf. Hendricks, 319 S.C. at 468, 462 S.E.2d at 287 (&quot;We decline to\r\n  accept the assertions of impairment as mitigation in view of the serious\r\n  misconduct committed and in light of respondent's failure to accept personal\r\n  responsibility for his conduct.&quot;).  We also order Atwater pay the costs of\r\n  these proceedings.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n We\r\n  hold Atwater has violated Rules 1.1, 1.3, 3.2, and 8.4 of the Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct.  Accordingly, Atwater is subject to discipline under\r\n  Rules 7(a)(1) and 7(a)(5) of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement. \r\n  Based on the facts of this case and particularly in light of Atwater's prior\r\n  history and failure to accept responsibility for his conduct, we order Atwater\r\n  be definitely suspended for a period of six months and pay the costs of these\r\n  proceedings.  Within fifteen days of the filing of this opinion, Atwater shall\r\n  file an affidavit demonstrating he has complied with the requirements of Rule\r\n  30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nTOAL, C.J., BEATTY, KITTREDGE and HEARN, JJ., concur. PLEICONES, J., concurring in\r\n  result only.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Boulware spent approximately $14,000 out of pocket to\r\n  perform some repairs to the building.  He testified further repairs were\r\n  needed, but he could not afford them.  Atwater's concern was that Boulware's\r\n  damages estimate was inflated and that his actual expenses included payments\r\n  for items other than flooding damage.  He was also concerned that the estimate\r\n  Boulware tendered was performed by an old friend of Boulware's, not an\r\n  independent contractor.\r\n[2] Atwater claimed that Boulware would not let him get his\r\n  own estimate.  The Panel found this assertion &quot;entirely lacking in\r\n  credibility.&quot;\r\n[3] These records were used only to show the telephone\r\n  calls Boulware made to Atwater, not whether Atwater returned any telephone\r\n  calls.\r\n[4] For example, Boulware wrote a letter to Atwater in\r\n  2005 expressing his desire to just get the matter behind him given how long it\r\n  had taken to resolve.  In 2007, he wrote, &quot;Let's just proceed with what we\r\n  have.&quot;  By 2008, his frustration had grown: &quot;I cannot phantom [sic]\r\n  any civil case of this nature taking over eight years to reach settlement.  I\r\n  do not understand why I have been unable to obtain basic information concerning\r\n  this matter, or why the case has not and is not being settled.&quot;\r\n[5] There is evidence to suggest Atwater was not at fault\r\n  in these cancellations.  However, Boulware testified Atwater failed to keep him\r\n  fully apprised of them.  Additionally, Atwater points to these cancellations as\r\n  being a contributing factor for why Boulware's case took ten years to resolve.\r\n[6] In re Atwater, 385 S.C. 257, 262, 684 S.E.2d 557, 559-60 (2009) (Atwater\r\n  II).\r\n[7] In Atwater II, Atwater was charged with five\r\n  complaints of misconduct. 385 S.C. at 258, 684 S.E.2d at 558.  The Panel found\r\n  he committed misconduct in three of the complaints but his conduct was not\r\n  sanctionable. Id  The remaining two complaints were dismissed. Id. \r\n  However, the Panel found Atwater failed to cooperate with ODC during its\r\n  investigation of these complaints and this alone was sanctionable. Id. at 258-59, 684 S.E.2d at 558.\r\n[8] The Panel discussed Rules 1.2 and 1.4 in tandem,\r\n  noting they impose similar ethical obligations.  ODC, however, only challenges\r\n  the Panel's conclusion with respect to Rule 1.4.  Because these obligations are\r\n  similar in this case, we will discuss them both under our de novo standard of\r\n  review.\r\n[9] Atwater's one statement that he believes there was\r\n  more he should have done and perhaps he should have withdrawn is utterly\r\n  unconvincing.  Immediately after he made this statement, he backtracked by pointing\r\n  out Boulware did not receive a better result after retaining a new attorney and\r\n  mentioning once again that Boulware was just aggravated because he had a weak\r\n  case.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"}]
