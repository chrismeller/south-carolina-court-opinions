Seymour, Assistant Deputy\r\n  Disciplinary Counsel, both of Columbia, for Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\tLawrence\r\n  E. Richter, Jr., of the Richter Law Firm, LLC, of Mount Pleasant, for\r\n  respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Â The Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) and\r\n  respondent have entered into an Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to\r\n  Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, in which respondent admits misconduct and\r\n  agrees to the issuance of either an admonition or a public reprimand.Â  We\r\n  accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.Â  The facts, as set forth in\r\n  the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFACTS\r\nMatter I\r\nIn 1998, respondent was hired to\r\n  represent Complainant A in a criminal matter.Â  In 2000, just days before the\r\n  hearing on the motion to suppress, Complainant A consulted with another lawyer\r\n  (Lawyer) about assisting with the case. Â Lawyer agreed to assist Complainant\r\n  A.Â  Lawyerâ€™s understanding was that respondent would remain involved in the\r\n  case.Â  Respondentâ€™s understanding was that Lawyer would be taking over the case\r\n  and she would no longer be involved.Â   \r\nAlthough aware of the upcoming motion hearing,\r\n  respondent did not appear.Â  Lawyer appeared and informed the court that he\r\n  believed respondent was to be helping him with the case.Â  Lawyer requested a\r\n  continuance because respondent did not appear and he was unable to proceed\r\n  without her assistance.Â  The judge telephoned respondent from his chambers and outside\r\n  the presence of Complainant A and Lawyer.Â  When the judge returned to the\r\n  courtroom, he announced he was relieving respondent from the case.Â  He then\r\n  denied the motion to suppress and informed Lawyer he had ten days to prepare\r\n  for trial.Â   \r\nWhen the case was called for trial, Complainant A\r\n  pled guilty and was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment.Â  His decision to\r\n  do so was based on Lawyerâ€™s inability to proceed without respondentâ€™s\r\n  assistance.Â  Complainant Aâ€™s subsequent post-conviction relief petition was\r\n  granted on a finding of ineffective assistance of counsel.Â   \r\nMatter II\r\nRespondent\r\n  was retained to represent Complainant B in a criminal matter.Â  During that\r\n  representation, respondent learned that someone had misappropriated funds from\r\n  Complainant Bâ€™s bank account.Â  In addition to the criminal case, respondent\r\n  agreed to represent Complainant B in a civil case against the bank. Â At some\r\n  point, respondent also became involved in defending a civil action filed by\r\n  Complainant Bâ€™s landlord and the sale of Complainant Bâ€™s mobile home.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  failed to accurately account for funds she received on Complainant Bâ€™s behalf.Â \r\n  She did not comply with Complainant Bâ€™s repeated requests for an accounting of\r\n  funds and itemization of fees incurred.Â  Respondent refused to provide\r\n  Complainant with copies of canceled checks related to transactions on his\r\n  behalf, asserting they were confidential and he was not entitled to them.Â  On\r\n  advice of counsel, respondent subsequently produced copies of the checks.Â \r\n  Respondent had no written fee agreement in any of the cases handled for\r\n  Complainant B.Â  At least one of the matters was handled on a contingency\r\n  basis.Â   \r\nMatter III\r\nRespondent failed to adequately train and\r\n  supervise staff members who were responsible for bookkeeping and maintaining\r\n  trust account records.Â  Errors in respondentâ€™s records included unidentified\r\n  deposit entries, check entries which did not identify the client to whom they\r\n  were associated, checks which did not contain a meaningful description or\r\n  client reference, checks inadvertently issued twice, deposits into the wrong\r\n  account, payments from the trust account on behalf of clients in excess of\r\n  funds those clients had on deposit, and resulting bank charges to the trust\r\n  account due to the errors.Â  Respondentâ€™s recordkeeping errors violated Rule\r\n  417, SCACR.Â   \r\nIn addition, respondentâ€™s failure to\r\n  properly reconcile her trust account, maintain accurate client ledgers, and\r\n  supervise her staff resulted in errors causing negative balances in some of her\r\n  clientsâ€™ trust accounts.Â  On several occasions, respondent issued checks from\r\n  her trust account payable to cash and delivered the cash to clients or their\r\n  designees.Â  Respondent did not maintain any documentation of these\r\n  transactions.  \r\nRespondent commingled her personal funds\r\n  with client funds when she deposited proceeds of her own insurance claim and\r\n  her own tax refund into her trust account.Â   \r\nThere is no evidence respondent profited\r\n  personally from her mismanagement of her trust account.Â  Prior to the\r\n  commencement of this investigation, respondent had recognized problems with her\r\n  management of her trust account and had already begun taking steps to remedy\r\n  those problems.Â  Since notice of this investigation, respondent has retained\r\n  the services of an experienced accounting professional who has reconciled her\r\n  account, corrected her errors, accounted for client funds, assisted her in\r\n  restoring client balances, and established an accounting system for her\r\n  office.Â Â Â  Â Â Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that by her misconduct she\r\n  has violated the following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct,\r\n  Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.3 (lawyer shall act with reasonable diligence and\r\n  promptness in representing client); Rule 1.4 (lawyer shall promptly comply with\r\n  reasonable requests for information); Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall hold client\r\n  property separate from her own property); Rule 1.16 (lawyer may withdraw from\r\n  representation if withdrawal can be accomplished without material adverse\r\n  effect on the interest of the client); and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional\r\n  misconduct for lawyer to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Further,\r\n  respondent agrees her misconduct violated the recordkeeping provisions of Rule\r\n  417, SCACR.Â  Respondent acknowledges that her misconduct constitutes grounds\r\n  for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â Â Â Â Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe find that respondentâ€™s misconduct\r\n  warrants a public reprimand.Â  Accordingly, we accept the Agreement for\r\n  Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for her misconduct.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26387","title":"In the Matter of Dane A.

[1]Â  We accept the Agreement and impose a\r\n  definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the date of respondentâ€™s\r\n  interim suspension.Â  The facts, as set forth in the Agreement, are as follows.Â  \r\n \r\nFACTS\r\nOn February 3,\r\n  2005, respondentâ€™s membership in the South Carolina Bar was suspended due to his\r\n  non-compliance with continuing legal education (CLE) requirements for 2002.Â \r\n  Respondent represents he failed to comply with the CLE requirements due to\r\n  financial difficulties.Â  On March 6, 2003, respondentâ€™s membership in the South\r\n  Carolina Bar was suspended due to non-payment of his 2003 license fee.Â \r\n  Respondent represents he failed to pay the license fee due to financial\r\n  difficulties.Â  On April 11, 2003, the Court issued an order suspending\r\n  respondent from the practice of law due to his failure to correct the foregoing\r\n  requirements for membership in the Bar.Â   \r\nNotwithstanding\r\n  his suspensions, respondent continued to work for an attorney through November\r\n  2003.Â  Respondent represents his job consisted of clerical duties as he did not\r\n  appear in court or sign letters or pleadings.Â  From mid-December 2003 to\r\n  January 2, 2004, respondent was employed as a contract attorney for Nextra\r\n  Litigation Solutions, LLC, on a document review project.Â   \r\nThereafter, respondent worked as a\r\n  paralegal for a law firm from April 26, 2004, to June 11, 2004.Â  Respondent\r\n  represented to the firm that his law license was on inactive status when, in\r\n  fact, he was suspended.Â  Respondent represents that he misunderstood the rules\r\n  at the time and honestly believed that his license was inactive due to the fact\r\n  that he had been administratively suspended as opposed to suspended for an\r\n  ethical violation. Â Further, respondent represents he\r\n  was unaware at the time that Rule 34, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR, prohibits a\r\n  suspended lawyer from working in any capacity connected with the law.Â   \r\nRespondent was reinstated to the practice\r\n  of law on June 28, 2004.Â  On August 4, 2004, respondent was served with a\r\n  Notice of Full Investigation requiring him to respond to the allegations within\r\n  thirty (30) days pursuant to Rule 19(c)(3), RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.Â  Respondent\r\n  failed to respond to the notice within thirty (30) days.Â  Although he contacted ODC before he received the Notice of Full Investigation, respondent now\r\n  realizes that this did not excuse him from responding to the notice.Â \r\n  Respondent represents he was depressed over his financial situation and, as a\r\n  result, failed to properly respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent remained unemployed until\r\n  March 7, 2005, when he accepted a position as an associate attorney with a law\r\n  firm.Â  Respondent immediately advised his supervisor of his March 11, 2005\r\n  interim suspension.[2]Â \r\n  He is no longer employed by the firm.Â  Â Â Â \r\nRespondent was\r\n  admitted to the Ohio Bar in 1986[3] and the South Carolina Bar in 1999.Â  He has no prior disciplinary history in\r\n  this state.Â  Since being placed on interim suspension, respondent has fully\r\n  cooperated with ODC.Â  Respondent represents that he is no longer suffering from\r\n  any meaningful depression.Â  Â \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent admits that his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 413, RLDE,\r\n  specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for lawyer to\r\n  violate the Rules of Professional Conduct or any other rules of this\r\n  jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers); Rule 7(a)(3) (it shall\r\n  be a ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate an order of the\r\n  Supreme Court or knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline for lawyer\r\n  to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to\r\n  bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or conduct\r\n  demonstrating an unfitness to practice law); and Rule 7(a)(7) (it shall be a\r\n  ground for discipline for lawyer to willfully violate a court order).Â  In\r\n  addition, respondent admits he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 5.5(a) (lawyer shall not\r\n  practice law in violation of regulations of the legal profession); Rule 8.1(b)\r\n  (lawyer shall not knowingly fail to respond to a lawful demand from a\r\n  disciplinary authority); Rule 8.4(a)\r\n    (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n    Conduct); and Rule 8.4(d) (it is professional misconduct for lawyer to engaging\r\n    in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit, or misrepresentation).Â  Â Â Â Â \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and impose a definite suspension of two years, retroactive to the date\r\n  of respondentâ€™s interim suspension.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this\r\n  opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing\r\n  that he has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J.,\r\n  MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES and \r\nBEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n[1] Respondent was placed on interim suspension on March\r\n  11, 2005.Â  In the Matter of Bonecutter, 363 S.C. 110, 610 S.E.2d 503\r\n  (2005).Â   \r\n[2] The interim suspension stemmed from respondentâ€™s\r\n  failure to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.Â  Rule 17(c), RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.Â   \r\n[3] The Supreme Court of Ohio suspended\r\n  respondent on April 8, 2005 for non-compliance with Ohio CLE requirements and\r\n  failure to pay a fine for non-compliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26388","title":"Widdicombe v.

Charleston, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM: Petitioner has filed a petition asking\r\n  this Court to review the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion in Widdicombe v. Tucker-Cales, 366 S.C. 75,\r\n  620 S.E.2d 333 (Ct. App. 2005).Â  We grant the petition, dispense with further\r\n  briefing, and vacate the portion of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion supporting\r\n  the family courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction in this case pursuant to the doctrine\r\n  of unclean hands, but affirm the opinion on all other grounds.\r\nFACTUAL/PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND\r\nThe\r\n  family court issued an emergency ex parte order granting\r\n  respondent (Father) custody of the partiesâ€™ minor child.Â  Subsequently,\r\n  petitioner (Mother) and Father entered into a temporary consent order granting\r\n  Father sole care, custody, and control of the child.\r\nMother\r\n  then moved for relief from the prior custody orders, alleging the family court\r\n  was without jurisdiction to modify the original custody order.Â  The family\r\n  court denied Motherâ€™s motion to dismiss, finding the family court had\r\n  continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.Â  The Court of Appeals affirmed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tDid the Court of Appeals err in further justifying the family\r\n  courtâ€™s continued exercise of jurisdiction over the partiesâ€™ dispute pursuant\r\n  to the doctrine of unclean hands?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nMother\r\n  contends the Court of Appeals erred in justifying the family courtâ€™s continued\r\n  exercise of jurisdiction over the partiesâ€™ dispute pursuant to the doctrine of\r\n  unclean hands based on her failure to give Father 60 daysâ€™ notice before moving\r\n  out of state.Â  Mother argues this finding is not supported by the record.Â  We\r\n  agree.\r\nThe\r\n  Court of Appeals held Mother was a resident of South Carolina pursuant to the Parental\r\n  Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), 28 U.S.C.A. Â§ 1738(A) (1988) and the Uniform\r\n  Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA), S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 20-7-782, et seq.\r\n  (1985), and, therefore, the family court had subject matter jurisdiction over\r\n  the case.\r\nAs additional support for the family\r\n  courtâ€™s exercise of jurisdiction in\r\n  this case, the Court of Appeals noted other states have applied the doctrine of\r\n  unclean hands to jurisdictional issues raised pursuant to the PKPA and UCCJA.Â \r\n  Noting the original custody order in this case required Mother to provide 60\r\n  daysâ€™ notice before taking the child out of the jurisdiction, and finding the\r\n  record indicated no such notice was provided, the Court of Appeals held they\r\n  would not consider Motherâ€™s sudden move to North Carolina on the eve of\r\n  Fatherâ€™s filing of his complaint for custody, without notice to Father, as a\r\n  change of residence under the PKPA.We hold the record does not support the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ finding that\r\n  Mother failed to give proper notice to Father of her move to North Carolina.Â \r\n  Rather, Fatherâ€™s affidavit, submitted in support of an emergency change of\r\n  custody, stated Mother provided notice to him in August 1998 of her plan to\r\n  move to North Carolina.Â  Sometime between September and October 1998, Mother\r\n  moved to North Carolina.Â  However, the ex parte order was not\r\n  entered until August 2000.Â  See Wooten v. Wooten, 364 S.C. 532,\r\n  615 S.E.2d 98 (2005) (in appeals from family court, an appellate court has the\r\n  authority to find the facts in accordance with its own view of the\r\n  preponderance of the evidence).Â  Accordingly, we vacate that portion of the\r\n  Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion further supporting the exercise of jurisdiction in\r\n  this case pursuant to the doctrine of unclean hands.Â  However, we affirm the\r\n  remainder of the opinion holding the family court properly found it had subject\r\n  matter jurisdiction to entertain the dispute.Â  \r\nAFFIRMED IN PART; VACATED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.Â  BEATTY, J., not\r\n  participating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26389","title":"In the Matter of Carroll Ansell Gantt","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=26389","description":"This is an attorney disciplinary opinion in which the Court imposed a definite suspension from the practice of law.","date":"2007-11-05","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tIn the Matter of Carroll Ansell\r\n      Gantt, Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 26389\r\nSubmitted September 28, 2007 - Filed November 5, 2007Â Â  \r\n\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\tLesley M.\r\n  Coggiola, Disciplinary Counsel, and Ericka M.

Leeds\r\n  Barroll, IV, of Columbia, for respondent.Â  \r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â Â  In this attorney disciplinary matter,\r\n  respondent and the Office of Disciplinary Counsel (ODC) have entered into an\r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR.Â  In the agreement, respondent admits misconduct and consents to any\r\n  sanction ranging from a public reprimand to a definite suspension not to exceed\r\n  six (6) months.Â  We accept the agreement and definitely suspend respondent from\r\n  the practice of law in this state for six (6) months.Â  The facts, as set forth\r\n  in the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS[1]\r\nMatter I\r\nRespondent\r\n  prepared a contract of sale for the purchase of an unimproved lot.Â  The deed\r\n  was prepared for a total consideration of $90,000.00.Â  At some point after the\r\n  sale and prior to recording, respondent changed the consideration stated on the\r\n  deed to reflect a sales price of $10,000.Â  The deed was then recorded with the\r\n  incorrect amount to assist respondentâ€™s clients with a reduced recording fee.\r\n \r\nMatter II\r\nA\r\n  Construction Company which was solely owned by one individual entered into a\r\n  contract of sale to purchase three (3) lots in the I-77 Business Park.Â  An\r\n  informal agreement between the owner of the Construction Company and four other\r\n  individuals provided that the Construction Company would acquire a specified\r\n  lot, Party 2 would acquire a specified lot, and the remaining three individuals\r\n  (Party 3) would acquire the third specified lot.Â  Since the contract of sale\r\n  reflected that the Construction Company alone was purchasing all three lots,\r\n  the bank required written acknowledgment of Party 3â€™s right to the specified lot\r\n  before it would finance that portion of the purchase.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  prepared a document entitled â€œAssignmentâ€ in which the Construction Company\r\n  purported to transfer and assign the specified lot to Party 3.Â  Respondent\r\n  signed the Construction Company ownerâ€™s name to the document as a true\r\n  signature, witnessed the signature, and then forwarded the document to the\r\n  bank.Â  Respondent represents that he was furthering his clientâ€™s objectives and\r\n  that his client gave him the authority to prepare and submit the document to\r\n  the bank.Â  Respondent represents that Party 3 obtained financing based on Party\r\n  3â€™s individual credit and the document forwarded to the bank was only used to\r\n  confirm the Construction Company ownerâ€™s intent to sell the specified lot to\r\n  Party 3.Â   \r\nRespondent\r\n  also prepared a document entitled â€œAssignmentâ€ in which the Construction\r\n  Company purported to transfer and assign the specified lot to Party 2.Â \r\n  Respondent signed the Construction Company ownerâ€™s name to the document and\r\n  then witnessed the signature.Â  Respondent also signed his secretaryâ€™s name as a\r\n  witness to the signature although she did not witness the signing of the\r\n  document.Â  Respondent states that this second document was never presented to\r\n  the Bank or any other agency or institution.Â   \r\nMatter III\r\nOn\r\n  October 18, 2004, respondent signed a document entitled â€œName Affidavitâ€ on\r\n  behalf of his clients, Husband and Wife.Â  Lawyer signed both Husbandâ€™s and\r\n  Wifeâ€™s names on the affidavit and submitted it to a mortgage company.Â \r\n  Respondent also notarized the false signatures.Â  The purpose of the document\r\n  was for Husband and Wife to acknowledge a typographical error in the spelling\r\n  of their last name prior to the disbursement of any funds by the mortgage company.Â \r\n \r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by his misconduct he has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 4.1 (in course of\r\n  representing a client, lawyer shall\r\n    not knowingly make false statement of material fact to a third person); Rule\r\n    8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct); and Rule\r\n    8.4(d) (lawyer shall not engage in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit,\r\n    or misrepresentation).Â  In addition, respondent admits his\r\n  misconduct constitutes grounds for discipline under Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413,\r\n  SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct or any other rules of this jurisdiction regarding\r\n  professional conduct of lawyers).Â   \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and definitely suspend respondent from the practice of law for six (6)\r\n  months.Â  Within fifteen days of the date of this opinion, respondent shall file\r\n  an affidavit with the Clerk of Court showing that he has complied with Rule 30,\r\n  RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nMOORE, A.C.J., WALLER,\r\n  PLEICONES and BEATTY, JJ., concur.Â  TOAL, C.J., not participating.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  The agreement provides that respondent\r\n  has been forthright and cooperative with the investigation of these matters. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy;

Â Respondentâ€™s request to make the suspension retroactive is\r\n  denied.Â  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn March\r\n  2006, respondent filed a self-report in which she stated she had failed to\r\n  comply with the requirements set forth in Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Specifically,\r\n  respondent did not maintain client trust ledgers or sufficient copies of\r\n  receipts and disbursements to and from her trust account, she did not maintain\r\n  or have her trust account bank statements in a readily accessible location, and\r\n  she was not reconciling her trust account statements on a monthly basis.Â  Due\r\n  in part to respondentâ€™s failure to comply with Rule 417, SCACR, as of March\r\n  2006, at least $18,000 in client funds were unaccounted for and respondent did\r\n  not have sufficient funds in her trust account to cover the client funds.Â \r\n \r\nRespondent\r\n  requests the Court consider her diagnosis of bipolar affective disorder in mitigation\r\n  of her misconduct.Â  According to the agreement, respondent has been fully\r\n  cooperative and forthright with ODC throughout the investigation.\r\nLAW\r\nRespondent\r\n  admits that by her misconduct she has violated the following provisions of the\r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR:Â  Rule 1.15 (lawyer shall safekeep client property); and Rule\r\n    8.4(a) (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct).Â  Further,\r\n    respondent admits her misconduct violated Rule 417, SCACR.Â  Â Â In addition, respondent admits her misconduct constitutes\r\n  a violation of Rule 7, RLDE, of Rule 413, SCACR, specifically Rule 7(a)(1)\r\n  (lawyer shall not violate Rules of Professional Conduct or any other\r\n  rules of this jurisdiction regarding professional conduct of lawyers).Â   \r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe accept the Agreement for Discipline by\r\n  Consent and indefinitely suspend respondent from the practice of law.Â  The\r\n  suspension shall not be retroactive to the date respondent was transferred to\r\n  incapacity inactive status. Â Before she may file a Petition for Reinstatement\r\n  respondent shall make full restitution to all persons and entities which have\r\n  been harmed by her misconduct.Â  Similarly, prior to filing a Petition for\r\n  Reinstatement, respondent shall fully reimburse the Lawyersâ€™ Fund for Client\r\n  Protection should it pay any claims on her behalf.Â  Within fifteen days of the\r\n  date of this opinion, respondent shall surrender her certificate of admission\r\n  to practice law in this state to the Clerk of Court and shall file an affidavit\r\n  with the Clerk of Court showing that she has complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule\r\n  413, SCACR.\r\nINDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, PLEICONES\r\n  and BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26391","title":"Marlar v.

Dudek, South Carolina Commission on Indigent Defense, Division of Appellate Defense, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  The State seeks a writ of certiorari to\r\n  review the decision of the Court of Appeals vacating the order of the circuit\r\n  court denying respondentâ€™s application for post-conviction relief (PCR).Â  Marlar v. State, 373 S.C. 275, 644 S.E.2d 769 (Ct. App.\r\n  2007).Â  We grant the petition\r\n  for a writ of certiorari on the Stateâ€™s Questions I and II, dispense with\r\n  further briefing, and reverse the opinion of the Court of Appeals.Â  The\r\n  petition is denied on the Stateâ€™s Questions III and IV.\r\nPursuant\r\n  to S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-27-80 (2003), the PCR judge must make specific findings of fact and state expressly the\r\n  conclusions of law relating to each issue presented.Â  The failure to\r\n  specifically rule on the issues precludes appellate review of the issues.Â  Pruitt v. State,\r\n  310 S.C. 254, 423 S.E.2d 127 (1992).Â  The order of the PCR judge in this matter\r\n  fails to specifically address any of the allegations raised by respondent.Â \r\n \r\nAlthough\r\n  the Court of Appeals initially indicated the order failed to comply with Â§\r\n  17-27-80 and should be remanded for specific findings of fact and conclusions\r\n  of law, the court later held respondentâ€™s allegations were preserved for\r\n  appellate review.Â  In making this determination, the Court of Appeals\r\n  apparently relied on the following language in the PCR judgeâ€™s order:\r\n\r\n\tAs to any allegations raised in the application or at\r\n  the hearing not specifically addressed by this Order, this Court finds that the\r\n  applicant failed to present any evidence regarding such allegations.Â \r\n  Accordingly, this Court finds that the applicant failed to meet his burden of\r\n  proof regarding them.Â  Therefore, any and all allegations not specifically\r\n  addressed in this Order are hereby denied and dismissed.\r\n\r\nThis\r\n  paragraph does not constitute a sufficient ruling on any issues since it does\r\n  not set forth specific findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  This language\r\n  should not be included in a PCR order unless there are allegations\r\n  contained in the application and/or mentioned at the PCR hearing about which\r\n  absolutely no evidence is presented.\r\nThe Court\r\n  of Appeals rejected the Stateâ€™s argument that none of respondentâ€™s allegations\r\n  were preserved for appellate review because respondent failed to make a Rule\r\n  59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend the judgment to include specific\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law.Â  See Humbert\r\n    v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 548 S.E.2d 862\r\n  (2001); Pruitt v. State, supra.Â  In discussing this argument, the\r\n  Court of Appeals noted this Court has remanded PCR actions to the PCR judge for\r\n  specific rulings, despite the fact there were no Rule 59(e) motions.Â  The court\r\n  then pointed to the more recent case of Humbert v.\r\n    State, supra, in which this Court held an issue was not preserved\r\n  for appellate review because it was not addressed in the PCR order and no Rule\r\n  59(e) motion was filed. Â The Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion then states, â€œIt does not appear that Humbert overruled the prior\r\n  cases, and it is not clear whether, in light of Humbert, an appellate\r\n  court may still take the extraordinary action of overlooking the failure to\r\n  file a Rule 59(e) motion and remanding matters so that specific orders may be\r\n  issued by the PCR court.â€\r\nThe\r\n  cases this Court remanded for specific findings were unique cases in which the\r\n  Court attempted to remind circuit court judges and parties that: (1) specific\r\n  findings of fact and conclusions of law were required; and (2) a Rule 59(e)\r\n  motion must be filed if issues are not adequately addressed in order to\r\n  preserve the issues for appellate review.Â  Although the cases apparently have\r\n  not accomplished the Courtâ€™s goal, they do not change the general rule that\r\n  issues which are not properly preserved will not be addressed on appeal.Â  In\r\n  fact, in Pruitt, this Court stated in a footnote, â€œIn vacating and remanding in this case,\r\n  we are not abandoning the general rule that issues must be raised to, and ruled\r\n  on by, the post-conviction judge to be preserved for appellate review. Â The\r\n  extraordinary action we take today is necessary only because our opinion in McCray [v. State, 305\r\n  S.C. 329, 408 S.E.2d 241 (1991)] is not\r\n  being followed.â€ Â Pruitt v. State, 310 S.C. at 255, 423 S.E.2d at\r\n  128.Â   \r\nBecause respondent did not make a Rule\r\n  59(e) motion asking the PCR judge to make specific findings of fact and\r\n  conclusions of law on his allegations, the issues were not preserved for\r\n  appellate review, and the Court of Appeals erred in addressing the merits of\r\n  the issues and remanding the matter to the PCR judge. Â Humbert v. State,\r\n    supra; Pruitt v. State, supra.\r\nWe take\r\n  this opportunity to reiterate our admonition that â€œ[c]ounsel preparing proposed\r\n  orders should be meticulous in doing so, opposing counsel should call any\r\n  omissions to the attention of the PCR judge prior to issuance of the order, and\r\n  the PCR judge should carefully review the order prior to signing it. Â Even\r\n  after an order is filed, counsel has an obligation to review the order and file\r\n  a Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motion to alter or amend if the order fails to set forth\r\n  the findings and the reasons for those findings as required by Â§ 17-27-80 and\r\n  Rule 52(a), SCRCP.â€Â  Pruitt v.

Camden Lewis, of Lewis &amp; Babcock, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â \r\n  In this attorney disciplinary matter, Dennis Rhoad (respondent) was charged\r\n  with possession of cocaine and later encouraged others to make misleading\r\n  statements to two of his clients.Â  The Commission on Lawyer Conduct\r\n  (Commission) recommended that this Court impose the sanction of an admonition\r\n  plus costs.Â  We sanction respondent with a ninety-day definite suspension plus\r\n  costs.Â   \r\nFACTS\r\nIn the early\r\n  morning hours of June 21, 2003, respondent became intoxicated at a bar.Â  He and\r\n  his friends walked to a fraternity party, where some attendees were snorting\r\n  lines of cocaine from the surface of a framed poster on a pool table.Â \r\n  Respondent inhaled one or possibly two lines of\r\n  cocaine.[1]Â  A police\r\n  officer observed the activity through the window from the porch of the house\r\n  across the street.Â  Six people, including respondent, were arrested for\r\n  possession of cocaine.\r\nAfter Disciplinary Counsel petitioned for\r\n  an interim suspension on July 2, 2003, respondent informed them that he had\r\n  been diagnosed with an â€œaddictive illnessâ€ in the form of an alcohol disorder.Â \r\n  Respondent opposed the interim suspension, arguing he was voluntarily placing\r\n  himself in a rigorous rehabilitation program and that his wife, also an\r\n  attorney, could handle his cases while he was absent.Â  On July 3, 2003, respondent\r\n  wrote a detailed memorandum regarding the status of every clientâ€™s case.Â  In\r\n  the memorandum, respondent instructed his wife and his staff to inform two of\r\n  his clients that other attorneys would be handling their cases because\r\n  respondent would be away â€œworking on a big case.â€Â  Respondent admitted this\r\n  statement was untruthful, but he indicated he was merely trying to keep private\r\n  the fact that he would be attending in-patient treatment for his addictive\r\n  illness.Â  There is no evidence that respondentâ€™s wife or his staff ever made\r\n  those representations to the clients.Â   \r\nRespondent was placed on interim suspension on July 8, 2003.Â \r\n  While on interim suspension, respondent completed the six week in-patient\r\n  treatment program and participated in a pre-trial intervention (P.T.I.)\r\n  program.Â  He attended psychological counseling and Alcoholics Anonymous\r\n  meetings for his addictive illness.Â  Following the dismissal of the possession\r\n  of cocaine charge pursuant to P.T.I., respondent was reinstated by this Court\r\n  in December 2003.Â  He cooperated fully in the investigation by Disciplinary\r\n  Counsel.Â   \r\nThe\r\n  Commission[2] found\r\n  respondentâ€™s â€œone time admitted use of cocaineâ€ violated various Rules of\r\n  Professional Conduct (Rule 407, SCACR): Â Rule 8.4(a), RPC (providing that it is\r\n  misconduct for a lawyer to attempt to violate the Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct); Rule 8.4(b), RPC (stating it\r\n  is misconduct for a lawyer to commit a\r\n  criminal act that reflects adversely on the lawyerâ€™s honesty, trustworthiness\r\n  or fitness as a lawyer in other respects); and Rule 8.4(c), RPC (providing it\r\n  is misconduct to commit a criminal act involving moral turpitude).Â  The\r\n  Commission also found respondentâ€™s instructions to his wife and staff to\r\n  provide false information to two clients regarding his whereabouts violated\r\n  Rule 8.4(d), RPC (stating it is misconduct to engage in conduct involving\r\n  dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation).Â  The Commission noted,\r\n  however, that no clients were harmed or intended to be harmed by the\r\n  violation.Â  The Commission further found respondentâ€™s actions constituted\r\n  grounds for discipline under the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR:Â  Rule\r\n  7(a)(1), RLDE (violating a Rule of Professional Conduct); and Rule 7(a)(5),\r\n  RLDE (conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or bringing the\r\n  legal profession into disrepute).Â  The Commission recommended a sanction of an\r\n  admonition and payment of costs of the proceedings.Â   \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondent does not complain about the finding of misconduct or\r\n  the recommended sanction.Â  Disciplinary Counsel, however, maintains the recommended\r\n  sanction is not sufficient.Â  Thus, the only matter for this Court to determine\r\n  is whether the recommendation of an admonition is the appropriate sanction.

Â The jury found Lee\r\n  guilty, and he received an aggregate sentence of forty-five years\r\n  imprisonment.Â  The Court of Appeals vacated Leeâ€™s convictions, finding the\r\n  excessive pre-indictment delay violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth\r\n  Amendment.Â  State v. Lee, 360 S.C. 530, 602 S.E.2d 113 (Ct. App. 2004).Â \r\n  We granted the Stateâ€™s petition for certiorari and now affirm.\r\nFACTS\r\nLee married the\r\n  mother of the two alleged victims in 1982.Â  Lee, his wife, and the two\r\n  stepdaughters moved into a home together.Â  In 1988, the Department of Social\r\n  Services (DSS) investigated allegations that Lee sexually abused his\r\n  stepdaughters.Â  These allegations arose during a juvenile criminal\r\n  investigation involving the stepdaughters.Â  DSS removed the stepdaughters from\r\n  the home and placed them in the custody of their aunt, but DSS returned the\r\n  stepdaughters to the home with Lee within several months.  \r\nThe solicitorâ€™s\r\n  office represented DSS during the family court hearings in 1988 which involved\r\n  the allegations against Lee. Â According to the State, the procedure used at\r\n  that time was for an assistant solicitor to prosecute family court cases on\r\n  behalf of DSS.Â  After the family court proceedings, the State took no further\r\n  action until Lee was indicted in 2001.\r\nISSUE\r\nDid\r\n  the Court of Appeals err in vacating Leeâ€™s convictions due to excessive pre-indictment\r\n  delay in violation of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment?\r\nANALYSIS\r\nThe\r\n  State argues the Court of Appeals erred in vacating Leeâ€™s convictions based on\r\n  the excessive pre-indictment delay.Â  We disagree.\r\nWe have adopted a\r\n  two-prong inquiry when pre-indictment delay is alleged to have violated a\r\n  defendantâ€™s due process rights.Â  State v. Brazell, 325 S.C. 65, 72-73,\r\n  480 S.E.2d 64, 68-69 (1997) (citing U.S. v. Lovasco, 431 U.S. 783\r\n  (1977)).Â  First, the defendant must prove that the delay caused substantial\r\n  actual prejudice to his right to a fair trial.Â  Id.Â  The second prong\r\n  requires the court to consider the reason for the Stateâ€™s delay and to balance\r\n  the justification for the delay against the prejudice to the defendant.Â  Id.Â  The State contends that the Court of Appeals erred by finding Lee satisfied\r\n  both parts of the inquiry.\r\nSubstantial Actual\r\n  Prejudice\r\nThe State argues\r\n  the Court of Appeals erred in holding that Lee met his burden of proving\r\n  substantial actual prejudice because Lee presented only non-specific,\r\n  conjectural possibilities of prejudice.Â  We disagree.\r\nTo prove\r\n  substantial prejudice, Lee must show that he was â€œâ€˜meaningfully impaired in his\r\n  ability to defend against the [S]tateâ€™s charges to such an extent that the\r\n  disposition of the criminal proceeding was likely effected [sic].â€™â€ Brazell,\r\n  325 S.C. at 73, 480 S.E.2d at 69 (quoting Jones v. Angelone, 94 F.3d\r\n  900, 907 (4th Cir. 1996)).Â  Prejudice to the defense of a criminal\r\n  case may result from the shortest and most necessary delay, but every\r\n  delay-caused detriment to a defendantâ€™s case should not abort a criminal\r\n  prosecution. Â U.S. v. Marion, 404 U.S. 307, 324-325 (1971).Â  To\r\n  accommodate the sound administration of justice to the rights of the defendant\r\n  to a fair trial will necessarily involve a delicate judgment based on the\r\n  circumstances of each case.Â  Id. at 325.\r\nTo meet his burden\r\n  of showing substantial prejudice, the defendant must identify the evidence and\r\n  expected content of the evidence with specificity, as well as show that he made\r\n  serious efforts to obtain the evidence and that it was not available from other\r\n  source.Â  Brazell, supra.Â  The State argues that Lee cannot prove\r\n  the alleged exculpatory evidence with specificity, and it contends that the\r\n  missing evidence is just as likely to be inculpatory instead of exculpatory.Â  The\r\n  Stateâ€™s argument is without merit.\r\n\r\n\tThe Court of\r\n  Appeals determined:\r\n\t\r\n\t\tLee did\r\n  more than merely rely on the length of the delay to establish substantial\r\n  actual prejudice. As Leeâ€™s counsel pointed out, the delay of twelve years\r\n  presented a significant obstacle in preparing an adequate defense and receiving\r\n  a fair trial. Â All the records from the family court case have been destroyed. Â No\r\n  records contemporaneous with the alleged offenses are available, particularly\r\n  those explaining why the stepdaughters were placed back into Leeâ€™s home after\r\n  being removed. Â Leeâ€™s efforts to acquire the same information from other\r\n  sources were likewise unavailing.Â  Leeâ€™s original attorney could not be\r\n  located, and the DSS investigator could recall no specifics about the\r\n  investigation.Â  Without this information, Leeâ€™s counsel could not adequately\r\n  cross-examine the victims and other family members regarding the alleged\r\n  incidents and the juvenile investigation that prompted DSS to become involved. Â Moreover,\r\n  Leeâ€™s counsel was also prevented from refuting the delayed disclosure evidence\r\n  presented by the State through its expert witness.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nLee, 360 S.C. at 538, 602 S.E.2d at 117-118.\r\nAmple evidence\r\n  supports the Court of Appealsâ€™ conclusion that Lee suffered actual substantial\r\n  prejudice from the pre-indictment delay.Â  Lee had no record of the previous DSS\r\n  investigation into the alleged abuse.Â  He could not gain access to evidence\r\n  concerning the Department of Juvenile Justice investigating officer or records\r\n  from the family court proceedings.Â  Because Lee never had access to\r\n  these records, it was admittedly difficult for him to accurately identify specific\r\n  pieces of evidence that would have exonerated him.Â  Nonetheless, the absence of\r\n  any contemporaneous evidence prejudiced Leeâ€™s ability to defend himself, as he\r\n  had no ability to cross-examine the Stateâ€™s witnesses nor obtain items of\r\n  exculpatory evidence. Â The missing evidence, although possibly damaging, on\r\n  balance would have likely benefited Lee because it would have revealed the\r\n  Stateâ€™s justification for placing the stepchildren back in the home with Lee\r\n  and revealed why the State did not prosecute him in 1988 or 1989.Â   \r\nFor\r\n  these reasons, the Court of Appeals did not err in determining Lee proved he\r\n  suffered substantial actual prejudice due to the pre-indictment delay.\r\nJustification for Delay\r\nThe State argues\r\n  that Lee cannot satisfy the second prong of the due process analysis for\r\n  pre-indictment delay because there is no evidence that the State acted\r\n  intentionally to gain a tactical advantage over Lee.Â  The State also argues\r\n  that the twelve year delay was justified when compared to the purported prejudice\r\n  to Lee.Â  We disagree, as the absence of any prosecutorial bad faith motive is\r\n  not fatal to Leeâ€™s Fifth Amendment claim.\r\nBrazell sets\r\n  forth the test for excessive pre-indictment delay under the Fifth Amendment.Â \r\n  In Brazell, we adopted the Fourth Circuit standard[1] for the second prong of the due process analysis.Â  The State argues that Brazell did not adopt the Fourth Circuit test because the Brazell court declined\r\n  to consider the second part of the test after Brazell failed to establish substantial\r\n  actual prejudice.Â  We disagree.Â  Although Brazell did not specifically acknowledge\r\n  the adoption of the Fourth Circuit rule, the Court clearly adopted the Fourth\r\n  Circuitâ€™s test for pre-indictment delay by citing Howell and Automated\r\n    Med. Laboratories when it discussed the two-part inquiry.\r\nRegardless,\r\n  we find the Fourth Circuit standard to be the better rule.Â  Requiring a higher\r\n  burden of proof in proving improper motives on the part of the prosecution\r\n  would put an almost impossible burden on defendants to maintain a Fifth\r\n  Amendment due process claim in pre-indictment delay cases.Â  See Howell, supra at 895 (holding that to require proof of prosecutorial bad faith\r\n  would mean that no matter how egregious the prejudice to a defendant, and no\r\n  matter how long the pre-indictment delay, if a defendant cannot prove improper\r\n  prosecutorial motive, then no due process violation has occurred and that this\r\n  conclusion, on its face, would violate fundamental conceptions of justice, as\r\n  well as the communityâ€™s sense of fair play).\r\nAccordingly,\r\n  the second part of the due process inquiry requires the court to consider the\r\n  prosecutionâ€™s reasons for the delay and balance the justification for delay\r\n  with any prejudice to the defendant.Â  Brazell, supra. Â When\r\n  balancing the prejudice and the justification, the basic inquiry then becomes\r\n  whether the governmentâ€™s action in prosecuting after substantial delay violates\r\n  â€œfundamental conceptions of justiceâ€ or â€œthe communityâ€™s sense of fair play and\r\n  decency.â€ Id. (quoting U.S. v. Automated Med. Laboratories, Inc., supra at 404).Â  \r\n \r\nWith the balancing\r\n  test in mind, the Court of Appeals correctly held that the State offered no\r\n  valid explanation for the delay in indicting Lee, and thus, in light of the\r\n  prejudice to the defendant, the prosecution of Lee twelve years later violated\r\n  fundamental concepts of justice and the communityâ€™s sense of fair play. The\r\n  only explanation ever given by the State involved its reason for indicting Lee\r\n  in 2001, namely that other allegations and charges of similar conduct with\r\n  other alleged victims had surfaced.Â  However, this rationalization does not\r\n  explain the delay from 1988 to 2001, nor does it justify the substantial\r\n  prejudice to Leeâ€™s ability to defend against these charges.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nFor the reasons previously\r\n  stated, the Court of Appeals did not err in vacating Leeâ€™s convictions due the\r\n  excessive pre-indictment delay of twelve years.Â   \r\nAFFIRMED.\r\nMOORE\r\n  and WALLER, JJ., concur. TOAL, C.J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which\r\n  Acting Justice E. C. Burnett, III, concurs.\r\nChief Justice Toal: I respectfully dissent.Â  In accordance with the\r\n  majority of the federal circuits that have addressed the issue, I would hold\r\n  that pre-indictment delay does not violate the Fifth Amendmentâ€™s due process\r\n  clause unless a defendant can show both actual prejudice and that the State has\r\n  intentionally delayed the issuance of an indictment in order to gain an unfair\r\n  tactical advantage.Â  See Jones v. Angelone, 94 F.3d 900, 905 (4th Cir.\r\n  1996) (recognizing that this test applies in every federal circuit save the\r\n  Fourth and the Ninth).Â   \r\nBut leaving this aside, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s\r\n  analysis of how the facts presented here interact with the majorityâ€™s\r\n  interpretation of this Courtâ€™s decision in State v. Brazell, 325 S.C.\r\n  65, 480 S.E.2d 64 (1997).Â  In contrast to the specific showing of prejudice Brazell purports to require, there is no specific showing of prejudice in the\r\n  instant case.Â  See id. at 73, 480 S.E.2d at 69 (providing that when the\r\n  claimed prejudice is caused by the unavailability of a witness, courts require\r\n  that the defendant identify the witness he would have called; demonstrate, with\r\n  specificity, the expected testimony; establish that the defendant made serious\r\n  attempts to locate the witness; and show that the information the witness would\r\n  have provided was not available from another source).Â  Although the court below\r\n  broadly asserted that â€œ[n]o records contemporaneous with the alleged offenses\r\n  are available . . . [and Appellantâ€™s] efforts to acquire the same information\r\n  from other sources were likewise unavailing,â€ State v. Lee, 360 S.C.\r\n  530, 538, 602 S.E.2d 113, 117-18 (2004), the record in this case reveals only\r\n  that Appellantâ€™s attorney tried (unsuccessfully) to subpoena documents from the\r\n  Department of Social Services, and that the persons the attorney sought to\r\n  interview did not recall these specific incidents.Â  In my view, this is a\r\n  showing totally devoid of specificity.Â   \r\nThe record does not contain any evidence of an attempt\r\n  to view the family courtâ€™s file regarding the prior incidents.Â  Furthermore,\r\n  there is no evidence demonstrating that other purportedly sought evidence, such\r\n  as the alleged victimsâ€™ school records, could not be obtained from alternate\r\n  sources; nor is there evidence that the information purportedly contained in\r\n  school records or in the minds of potential witnesses could not be obtained\r\n  through interviewing other family members or acquaintances. Finally, there is\r\n  no specific assertion as to how any of this information would be beneficial to\r\n  Appellant.Â  No Court may justifiably ask a litigant to prove a negative - that\r\n  is to say, no Court may ask a party to specifically establish the contents of a\r\n  document that the party has never seen or the substance of testimony a party has\r\n  never heard - but Appellantâ€™s arguments are, at bottom, utter speculation\r\n  regarding the possible content of documents that may never have even existed.Â \r\n  In my view, Brazell requires substantially more in the way of\r\n  specificity.\r\nAs a final aside, I would dismiss the lower courtâ€™s\r\n  assertion that the State offered no substantial reason for the pre-indictment\r\n  delay as completely out of place given this caseâ€™s posture.Â  Id. at 539,\r\n  602 S.E.2d at 118.Â  At trial, the court adopted the Stateâ€™s position that the\r\n  court could not find a due process violation absent a showing that the State\r\n  intentionally delayed the issuance of an indictment in order to gain an unfair\r\n  tactical advantage.Â  Thus, at trial, there was no need for the State to offer\r\n  any justification for the delay whatsoever.Â  We ought not ask the parties to\r\n  make any kind of an evidentiary showing in this Court that they did not make\r\n  below.Â  If Brazell requires reversal of the trial courtâ€™s decision\r\n  because the court applied the wrong legal standard, we ought to remand to the\r\n  trial court for application of the correct one.Â   \r\nFor the foregoing reasons, I respectfully dissent.  \r\nActing Justice\r\n  E. C. Burnett, III, concurs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] The Fourth Circuit is one of two federal circuits\r\n  that does not currently require a showing that the government intentionally\r\n  delayed the indictment so as to gain a tactical advantage.Â  See U.S. v.

Code Ann. Â§ 18-9-130 (Supp. 2006) if it wishes to enforce its judgment\r\n  during the pendency of respondentâ€™s (the judgment debtorâ€™s) appeal of an order\r\n  denying respondentâ€™s Rule 60, SCRCP, motion to set aside the judgment.Â  We\r\n  reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nAppellant obtained\r\n  a default judgment for approximately $1.3 million against respondent in January\r\n  2005.Â  Respondent filed a timely motion to set aside the default under Rule\r\n  60(b)(2) and(4), SCRCP, in March 2005.Â  Respondent did not, however, ask the circuit\r\n  court for relief pursuant to Rule 62(b), SCRCP, which provides, in relevant\r\n  part:\r\n\r\n\tIn its\r\n  discretion and on such conditions for the security of the adverse party as are\r\n  proper, the court may stay the execution of or any proceedings to enforce a\r\n  judgment pending the dispositionâ€¦of a motion for reliefâ€¦made pursuant to Rule\r\n  60â€¦.\r\n\r\nSince no stay was sought\r\n  pursuant to this rule, appellant was entitled to enforce its judgment despite\r\n  the pendency of respondentâ€™s Rule 60 motion.\r\nIn August 2005, the\r\n  circuit court denied respondentâ€™s Rule 60 motion, and in January 2006, denied\r\n  respondentâ€™s Rule 59 motion to reconsider the Rule 60 denial.Â  Respondent then\r\n  filed an appeal on the merits of the 60(b) motion.Â  That appeal has been\r\n  decided by the Court of Appeals, which affirmed.Â  Stearns Bank Natâ€™l Assâ€™n\r\n    v. Glenwood Falls, LP, 373 S.C. 331, 644 S.E.2d 793 (Ct. App. 2007).Â \r\n  Respondent is seeking a writ of certiorari to review that decision.\r\nMonths after\r\n  respondent appealed the denial of its Rule 60(b) motion, it filed a motion in\r\n  circuit court seeking to stay the underlying default judgment pending\r\n  disposition of the appeal.Â  Following a hearing, the circuit judge issued an\r\n  order refusing respondentâ€™s request that he stay appellantâ€™s right to execute\r\n  on the judgment during the Rule 60 appeal, but holding that if appellant wished\r\n  to do so, it must post a bond or undertaking pursuant to Â§ 18-9-130.Â  The order\r\n  goes on to provide that should appellant comply with the statute by posting a\r\n  bond, then respondent in turn could stay the execution by posting its own bond\r\n  under Â§ 18-9-130.Â  This appeal follows.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\n\tWhether\r\n  the circuit court erred in holding that Â§ 18-9-130 applied to an appeal from an\r\n  order denying a Rule 60(b) motion?\r\n\r\nANALYSIS\r\n\r\n\tSection\r\n  18-9-130 provides:\r\n\t\r\n\t\t(A)(1)\r\n  A notice of appeal from a judgment directing the payment of money does not stay\r\n  the execution of the judgment unless the presiding judge before whom the\r\n  judgment was obtained grants a stay of execution.\r\n\t\r\n\r\nThe predicate for 18-9-130 is\r\n  that a money judgment has been appealed.Â  Here, respondent, having defaulted,\r\n  was barred from such a direct appeal, e.g. Winesett v. Winesett,\r\n  287 S.C. 332, 338 S.E.2d 340 (1985), and instead sought and was denied an\r\n  opportunity to set that money judgment aside.Â  An order denying the Rule 60(b),\r\n  SCRCP, motion is simply not â€œa judgment directing the payment of money.â€Â  See\r\n    also Raby Constr., LLP v. Orr, 358 S.C. 10, 594 S.E.2d 478 (2004)\r\n  (Rule 60 order separate and distinct from underlying judgment).Â  An appeal from\r\n  a 60(b) denial does not stay the original judgment.Â  Id.\r\nThe filing\r\n  of a Rule 60(b) motion â€œdoes not affect the finality of a judgment or suspend\r\n  its operation.â€Â  Rule 60(b).Â  If the debtor wishes to stay enforcement of the\r\n  judgment pending the trial courtâ€™s disposition of the debtorâ€™s Rule 60(b)\r\n  motion, the burden is on it to make the motion under Rule 62(b), SCRCP.Â \r\n  Whether to grant such a stay rests in the courtâ€™s discretion â€œon such\r\n  conditions for the security of the [creditor] as are properâ€¦â€Â  Rule 62(b).Â  The\r\n  policy expressed in Rule 60 and in Rule 62(b) favors the creditor over the\r\n  debtor.  \r\nMoreover, when a\r\n  debtor appeals the denial of its 60(b) motion, Rule 225, SCACR, which governs\r\n  stays on appeal, comes into play.Â  The general rule is that an appeal acts as\r\n  an automatic stay of the relief granted below, subject to certain exceptions.Â  Id.Â  Rule 60(b) denials are not subject to an exception, nor is there any logical\r\n  reason why they would be.Â  The denial of such a motion grants no relief: Â that\r\n  â€œno reliefâ€ is automatically stayed leaves the parties in the exact position\r\n  they were in before the 60(b) motion and appeal, that is, the original judgment\r\n  is unaffected.Â  Accordingly, absent the grant of some extraordinary relief to\r\n  the debtor by the appellate court during the pendency of such an appeal, the\r\n  creditor is entitled to enforce its judgment.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nThe circuit court\r\n  order applying Â§ 18-9-130 to the appellantâ€™s judgment is  \r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER and\r\n  BEATTY, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"In the Matter of Thomas D.

Camden Lewis and Peter D. Protopapas, of Lewis &amp; Babcock, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n\t\t\t\tBarbara\r\n  M. Seymour, Assistant Deputy Disciplinary Counsel, of Columbia, for the Office\r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:Â  In\r\n  this attorney disciplinary matter, the sub-panel and full panel recommend an\r\n  admonition and costs of $564.38.Â  We impose a sixty day suspension.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent graduated from law school in 2001.Â Â  He went to work\r\n  for attorney Jack Schoer in September 2002, performing three to four\r\n  residential real estate closings per week.Â Â  For four months, Respondent would\r\n  go to Schoerâ€™s office, pick up a closing packet, attend a closing and review\r\n  the documents with the borrower.Â  He would then return the closing packet to\r\n  Schoerâ€™s office.Â  If a second witness was not present at the closing,\r\n  Respondent would witness the signatures himself and return the packet to Schoer\r\n  without a second witnessâ€™ signature or notarization.Â Â  Respondent was aware\r\n  that at some point after the documents were returned, someone who was not\r\n  actually at the closing would sign as a witness to the documents and would sign\r\n  as notary.Â   \r\nIn January 2003, Respondent ceased working for Schoer and began\r\n  working as a judicial law clerk/staff attorney at the Court of Appeals.Â Â  In\r\n  late January 2003, while employed as a staff attorney, Respondent began\r\n  conducting two to three closings per month for Schoer, in the same manner as\r\n  described above.Â  He continued this practice through April 2005, at which time\r\n  he left his position with the Court of Appeals and went to work full time for\r\n  Schoer.\r\nFormal charges were filed against Respondent in March 2006.Â  The\r\n  complaint alleged Respondent had engaged in the practice of law while working\r\n  as a law clerk, and that he had assisted non-lawyers in the unauthorized\r\n  practice of law.Â  After a hearing, the sub-panel found Respondent had engaged\r\n  in misconduct in regard to practicing law while employed as a law clerk in\r\n  violation of Canon 5(D) of the Code of Conduct for Staff Attorneys and Law\r\n  Clerks, Rule 506, SCACR.Â  However, the sub-panel did not find misconduct with\r\n  regard to assisting non-lawyers in the unauthorized practice of law.Â  The\r\n  sub-panel found that Respondentâ€™s actions regarding the real estate closings\r\n  were wrong, but were not dishonest and did not amount to a misrepresentation\r\n  such that they did not violate Rule 8.4(d).[1]Â Â \r\n  It also found Respondentâ€™s character and inexperience mitigating, as well as\r\n  the fact that he accepted full responsibility for his actions and was sincerely\r\n  remorseful.Â  The sub-panel recommended an admonition, and the full panel\r\n  adopted the sub-panelâ€™s report and concurred with the recommended sanction.Â  We\r\n  disagree with the recommended sanction and impose a sixty day suspension.Â  Â \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe authority to discipline attorneys and the manner in which the\r\n  discipline is given rests entirely with the Supreme Court. Â In re Yarborough,\r\n  337 S.C. 245, 524 S.E.2d 100 (1999).\r\nCanon 5(D), Rule 506, SCACR (the Code of Conduct for Staff\r\n  Attorneys and Law Clerks), prohibits a staff attorney or law clerk from â€œundertak[ing]\r\n  to perform legal services for any private client in return for remuneration.â€Â  By\r\n  practicing law while employed as a law clerk, Respondent has engaged in the\r\n  unauthorized practice of law in violation of Rule 5.5, Rules of Professional\r\n  Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR.Â   \r\nFurther, we find Respondentâ€™s conduct in conjunction with the real\r\n  estate closings constitutes a violation of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Â Rule\r\n  407, SCACR.Â  In allowing the closing documents to be returned un-signed by a\r\n  second witness, without proper notarization, with the knowledge that some other\r\n  person who was not at the closing would subsequently sign as a witness and\r\n  notarize his signature, we find Respondent violated Rule 8.4(d) (conduct\r\n  involving dishonesty or misrepresentation) and Rule 8.4(e) (conduct prejudicial\r\n  to the administration of justice).Â Â   \r\nWe find Respondentâ€™s actions in this matter warrant a sixty day\r\n  suspension from the practice of law.Â Â  See In re Poff, 366 S.C.\r\n  542, 623 S.E.2d 642 (2005) (attorneyâ€™s actions in representing title insurance\r\n  company and not attending closings, but in signing and notarizing closing\r\n  documents as if he had been witness warranted sixty day suspension);Â  In re\r\n    Lattimore, 361 S.C. 126, 604 S.E.2d 369 (2004) (attorneyâ€™s misconduct,\r\n  which included closingÂ  residential real estate loans in â€œflippingâ€\r\n  transactions and allowing non-lawyers he supervised to notarize signatures they\r\n  had not witnessed and to conduct real estate closings, warranted disbarment). \r\n \r\nAccordingly, Respondent is definitely suspended from the practice\r\n  of law for sixty days. Â Furthermore, we order respondent to pay the costs of\r\n  these disciplinary proceedings to the Commission on Lawyer Conduct within 30\r\n  days of the date of this opinion. Â Respondent shall file an affidavit with the\r\n  Clerk of Court, within 15 days of the date of this opinion, showing that he has\r\n  complied with Rule 30, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.\r\nDEFINITE SUSPENSION.\r\nTOAL,\r\n  C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BEATTY, JJ., and Acting Justice Dorothy Mobley Jones,\r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n[1]Â  It is professional misconduct for a lawyer to engage\r\n  in conduct involving dishonesty, fraud, deceit or misrepresentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"26396","title":"State v.
