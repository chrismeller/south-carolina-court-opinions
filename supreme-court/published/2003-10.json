Simons Collins, both of Asbill &amp; Beck, of Charleston, \r\n  for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n CHIEF JUSTICE TOAL: This Court \r\n  granted Rural Metro Corporationâ€™s (â€œRural Metroâ€) petition for certiorari to \r\n  review whether its employee can recover Workersâ€™ Compensation benefits for an \r\n  accidental gunshot wound that occurred while the employee was on a smoke break.    \r\n\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nWhile working as a paramedic for Rural \r\n  Metro, Richard Dukes (â€œDukesâ€) and his co-worker took a smoke break.  Dukes \r\n  did not need to â€œclock-outâ€ for such breaks and received compensation for the \r\n  breaks.   While on break, Dukesâ€™ co-worker went to her car and returned with \r\n  the pistol she had recently acquired to bring back and show Dukes.  She handed \r\n  the pistol to Dukes, who examined it and gave it back to her.  The gun then \r\n  accidentally discharged, shooting Dukes in his upper thigh.  \r\nThe Workersâ€™ Compensation Commissioner \r\n  found that Dukesâ€™ injury did not arise out of his employment with Rural Metro \r\n  and denied his claim for benefits.  The Commissionâ€™s appellate panel reversed, \r\n  finding that Dukes suffered a compensable injury during â€œdown time,â€ which was \r\n  part of his job.  The Circuit Court affirmed the panel, holding that the gunshot \r\n  accident arose out of Rural Metroâ€™s employment of Dukes, and the Court of Appeals \r\n  affirmed.  Dukes v. Rural Metro Corp., 346 S.C. 369, 552 S.E.2d 39 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).  Rural Metro petitions the Court to review the following issue:\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in finding that Dukesâ€™ \r\n  injury was compensable?\r\n\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nThis Court will not overturn a decision \r\n  by the Workersâ€™ Compensation Commission unless the determination is unsupported \r\n  by substantial evidence.  Lark v. Bi-Lo, Inc., 276 S.C. 130, 276 S.E.2d \r\n  304 (1981).  â€œSubstantial evidence is evidence which, considering the record \r\n  as a whole, would allow reasonable minds to reach the conclusion that the administrative \r\n  agency reached to justify its action.â€  Howell v. Pacific Columbia Mills, \r\n  291 S.C. 469, 354 S.E.2d 384 (1987).\r\nAn employee may recover workerâ€™s compensation \r\n  benefits if he sustained an â€œinjury by accident arising out of and in the course \r\n  of employment.â€  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 42-1-160 (1985).  Rural Metro argues that \r\n  the statute does not contemplate Dukesâ€™ injury.  We agree.\r\nThis Court has held that an accidental \r\n  injury that occurs during a routine break from work is compensable under the \r\n  personal comfort doctrine.  In Mack v. Branch No. 12, Post Exchange, \r\n  Fort Jackson, 207 S.C. 258, 35 S.E.2d 838 (1945), this Court gave the \r\n  following rationale about why the worker is covered for an injury that occurs \r\n  during a routine personal break:\r\n\r\nSuch acts as are necessary to the life, comfort, and convenience \r\n  of the servant while at work, though strictly personal to himself, and not acts \r\n  of service, are incidental to the service, and injury sustained in the performance \r\n  thereof is deemed to have arisen out of the employment.  A man must breathe \r\n  and occasionally drink water while at work.  In these and other conceivable \r\n  instances he ministers unto himself, but in a remote sense these acts contribute \r\n  to the furtherance of his work. . . .  That such acts will be done in the course \r\n  of employment is necessarily contemplated, and they are inevitable incidents.  \r\n  Such dangers as attend them, therefore, are incident dangers.  At the \r\n  same time injuries occasioned by them are accidents resulting from the \r\n  employment.\r\n\r\nMack, 207 S.C. at 264-265, 35 S.E.2d at 840 (citation \r\n  omitted) (emphasis added).  In Mack, we held the employee was entitled \r\n  to compensation resulting from injuries suffered during a smoke break, when \r\n  his pant leg caught fire after cigarette lighter fluid spilled on it.  Similarly, \r\n  in McCoy v. Easley Cotton Mills, 218 S.C. 350, 62 S.E.2d 772 (1950), \r\n  we held an employee on a smoke break who was injured after turning and accidentally \r\n  walking into a piece of copper piping held by a co-employee was entitled to \r\n  compensation.  The copper piping was used in the air conditioning of the mill, \r\n  and the employees had, immediately prior to the accident, been discussing using \r\n  the piping in order to make a travis key, which was used by the claimant in \r\n  his employment as a doffer.  \r\nMack and McCoy are distinguishable from the \r\n  instant case.  In both of those cases, the injuries which occurred were occasioned \r\n  by the dangers that attended to the smoke breaks, e.g., in Mack, the \r\n  very fact of smoking was the attendant danger, and in McCoy, it was the \r\n  copper piping used at the mill which caused the injury.  Unlike those cases, \r\n  Dukes was injured by a gun, which was not naturally found on his employerâ€™s \r\n  premises, and was in no way connected to his employerâ€™s business.  Accordingly, \r\n  it was not such a danger as attended his employment.  Cf. Bright v. \r\n  Orr Lyons Mills, 285 S.C. 58, 59, 328 S.E.2d 68, 70 (1985) (employee shot \r\n  while walking from the building where he worked toward his car was â€œin the course \r\n  of his employmentâ€ but his injury did not arise out of his employment because \r\n  the accident bore no â€œlogical causal relationâ€ thereto; to be compensable, accident \r\n  â€œmust appear to have had its origin in a risk connected with the employment \r\n  and to have flowed from that source as a logical consequenceâ€).  \r\nWe find that Dukesâ€™ injury did not â€œarise out ofâ€ his employment \r\n  with Rural Metro because there was no nexus connecting his job as a paramedic \r\n  to his colleagueâ€™s handgun that they were examining during a smoke break.  Osteen \r\n  v. Greenville County School Dist., 333 S.C. 43, 50, 508 S.E.2d 21, 25 (1998) \r\n  (â€œThe injury arises out of employment when there is a causal connection between \r\n  the conditions under which the work is required to be performed and the resulting \r\n  injury.â€).  \r\nOur decision is in accord with Professor Larsonâ€™s view that \r\n  the personal comfort doctrine does not cover Dukesâ€™ injury:\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the personal comfort doctrine is to allow employees \r\n  to attend to their biological personal requirements.  People need to take breaks, \r\n  go to the bathroom, even smoke a cigarette.  Do employees need, however, to \r\n  play with guns?   Allowing an employee to go to the bathroom, to walk outside \r\n  to clear his or her head, or to take other short breaks is good for the employerâ€™s \r\n  business.  Injuries sustained during those activities should be compensable.  \r\n  Injuries sustained while handling a privately owned pistol should not.  Allowing \r\n  the employment to be expanded so as to include the type of activity found in \r\n  Dukes seems to go far beyond the original intent of the doctrine.\r\n\r\nArthur Larson, Larsonâ€™s Workersâ€™ Compensation Law, \r\n  Â§ 21.08[4][a] (2002) (analyzing the Court of Appealsâ€™ Dukes decision).\r\nConclusion\r\nBased on the reasoning above, we REVERSE \r\n  the Court of Appeals and find that Dukesâ€™ injury did not â€œarise out ofâ€ his \r\n  employment with Rural Metro. \r\n MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, \r\n  JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25731","title":"Robinson Laundry v.

We affirm.\r\n  &nbsp;FACTS\r\nRobinson, a provider of dry cleaning and laundering services, brings this action \r\n  alleging portions of the Sales and Use Tax Act (the â€œActâ€), S.C. Code Ann. Â§ \r\n  12-36-910 (1976) et seq., violate the equal protection clauses \r\n  of the United States and South Carolina Constitutions. [1]   \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n       I.\r\n       \r\n  Did the lower court err in holding the imposition of a sales tax on dry cleaning \r\n  does not violate the equal protection clause?\r\n    \r\n    \r\n       II.&nbsp;\r\n       \r\n  Did the lower court err in holding the number and character of exemptions within \r\n  the Act did not render the Act violative of the equal protection clause?\r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\nI\r\nImposition of the sales tax upon dry cleaners\r\nRobinson argues the sales tax violates the equal protection \r\n  clause because it is not imposed upon all service providers, only dry cleaners.\r\nBoth parties agree this Court is charged with applying \r\n  the rational basis test to determine whether the tax offends the equal protection \r\n  clause.  Under the test the Court is tasked with determining: 1) whether the \r\n  law treats â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ entities different; 2) if so, whether the Legislature \r\n  has a rational basis for the disparate treatment; and 3) whether the disparate \r\n  treatment bears a rational relationship to a legitimate government purpose.  \r\n  Lehnhausen v. Lake Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 93 S. Ct. 1001, \r\n  35 L. Ed. 2d 351 (1973); Bibco Corp. v. City of Sumter, 332 S.C. 45, \r\n  504 S.E.2d 112 (1998).  \r\nRobinson bears the burden of proving the tax is \r\n  unconstitutional and it must overcome this Courtâ€™s mandate to sustain a legislative \r\n  enactment if there is â€œany reasonable hypothesis to support it.â€  D.W. Flowe \r\n  &amp; Sons, Inc. v. Christopher Constr. Co., 326 S.C. 17, 482 S.E.2d 558 \r\n  (1997).\r\nThe fundamental disagreement between Robinson and \r\n  the State focuses on the first prong of the test.  Specifically, each side views \r\n  the composition of those â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ differently.  \r\nRobinson asserts those businesses â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ \r\n  to it are all service-oriented businesses, while the State asserts â€œsimilarly \r\n  situatedâ€ businesses are only dry cleaners.  The State, therefore, defines the \r\n  class in terms of a distinct trade as opposed to Robinsonâ€™s formulation of a \r\n  broad economic sector.  A class may be constitutionally confined to a particular \r\n  trade.  See Armour Packing Co. v. Lacy, 200 U.S. 226, 26 S. Ct. \r\n  232, 50 L. Ed. 451 (1906); State v. Byrnes, 219 S.C. 485, 66 S.E.2d 33 \r\n  (1951).                    \r\nAs Robinson does not claim the State taxes dry cleaners, i.e. those â€œsimilarly \r\n  situated,â€ differently it fails to prove a violation of the equal protection \r\n  clause.  See TNS Mills, Inc. v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Revenue, \r\n  331 S.C. 611, 503 S.E.2d 471 (1998).  \r\nAssuming, arguendo, Robinsonâ€™s definition of â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ is correct, \r\n  the argument fails because the State has a rational basis for treating dry cleaners \r\n  differently.  The Stateâ€™s rational basis for treating dry cleaners differently \r\n  from other service providers serves a legitimate government interest.\r\nTo find both the legitimate government interest and the rational basis for \r\n  treating dry cleaners differently, we view the Act in its entirety.  See \r\n  South Carolina Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics Comâ€™n, \r\n  306 S.C. 41, 410 S.E.2d 245 (1991) (in interpreting a law a court must look \r\n  to its language and its meaning in conjunction with the purpose of the whole \r\n  statute and the policy of the law).   \r\nIn reviewing the entire Act we note the code provides dry cleaners with a tax \r\n  exemption for supplies and machinery used to perform their services.  See \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120 (24).  As noted by the circuit court, â€œ[u]nlike \r\n  most service industries, dry cleaners have high startup costs as a result of \r\n  expensive machinery and equipment . . . [b]y exempting machinery purchased by \r\n  dry cleaners and, in turn, taxing their sales, the Legislature makes it less \r\n  expensive for individuals to start this type of business.â€  \r\nThe Stateâ€™s rational basis for treating dry cleaners differently from other \r\n  trades in the service industry is to promote the legitimate governmental interests \r\n  of fostering economic development in a particular segment of the economy.  The \r\n  Legislature achieves this goal by exempting dry cleaners from paying sales taxes \r\n  on expensive machinery necessary to start the business in exchange for allowing \r\n  the payment of sales taxes based on later-earned receipts.\r\nSignificantly, the State argued below the dry cleaning \r\n  process involves the use of chemicals and other products posing a threat of \r\n  environmental harm.  The tax may be a method to defray the cost of such harm.\r\nII\r\nExemptions\r\nRobinson argues the sheer number and nature of the \r\n  exemptions in Â§ 12-46-2120 renders the Act special legislation and unconstitutional \r\n  in its entirety.           \r\nRobinson asserts the Act, which has sixty exemptions, [2]  violates equal protection because it treats some sectors of \r\n  the service economy more beneficially than others.  Robinson further asserts \r\n  the nature of the categorical exemptions renders it arbitrary and special legislation. [3] \r\nRobinsonâ€™s argument that â€œ[t]he sheer number of exemptions \r\n  demonstrates the exemptions are arbitraryâ€ is without merit.  We are concerned \r\n  not with size or volume but with content.\r\nRobinson complains the exemptionsâ€™ content is not \r\n  natural or reasonable.  For example, Robinson asserts that providing tax exemptions \r\n  for dental prosthetic devices but not for wheelchairs may be arbitrary in the \r\n  political sense.  Robinson may be correct in noting such exemptions belie a \r\n  misunderstanding of economics, and are therefore unwise in an economic sense.  \r\n  Robinson is not correct in asserting, however, that the exemptions are arbitrary \r\n  in the constitutional sense.  The fact a classification may result in an inequity \r\n  or may be unwise in an economic sense does not render it unconstitutional.   \r\n  Davis v. County of Greenville, 313 S.C. 459, 443 S.E.2d 383 (1994)\r\nRobinsonâ€™s assertions notwithstanding, we must give great deference to the \r\n  General Assemblyâ€™s classification decisions because it presumably debated and \r\n  weighed the advantages and disadvantages of the legislation at issue.  Lee \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Natural Resources, 339 S.C. 463, 467, 530 S.E.2d \r\n  112, 114 (2000).  We agree with the circuit court the State has identified major \r\n  categories of exemptions and provided a rational basis for each; while Robinson \r\n  has failed to carry its burden of showing the exemptions are unconstitutional. [4] \r\nAccordingly, we AFFIRM.\r\nMOORE and WALLER, JJ., concur.  TOAL, C.J., dissenting \r\n  in a separate opinion in which Acting Justice Diane S. Goodstein, concurs. \r\n Chief Justice Toal:  I respectfully \r\n  dissent because I disagree with the majority on both issues I and II.  In my \r\n  opinion, there is no rational basis for treating dry cleaning services differently \r\n  from other services.  I would also find that when viewed in the light most favorable \r\n  to Robinson, a genuine issue of material fact exists as to whether the sixty-one \r\n  exceptions to the sales tax are arbitrary and capricious and thus violate the \r\n  Equal Protection Clause.  Fleming v. Rose, 350 S.C. 488, 567 S.E.2d 857 \r\n  (2002).   \r\nI\r\nIn my view, the sales tax violates the \r\n  rational basis test and thus violates equal protection.  Lehnhausen v. Lake \r\n  Shore Auto Parts Co., 410 U.S. 356, 93 S. Ct. 1001, 35 L.Ed.2d 351 (1973); \r\n  Bibco Corp. v. City of Sumter, 332 S.C. 45, 504 S.E.2d 112 (1998).  Because \r\n  I believe that dry cleaning services are part of the same class as other service \r\n  providers, I would hold that the statute treats â€œsimilarly situatedâ€ entities \r\n  differently.  Further, I would hold that there is no rational basis for singling \r\n  out dry cleaners - to the exclusion of other services - for sales tax purposes.  \r\n  Finally, I am not persuaded by the assertion that since the sales tax statute \r\n  exempts dry cleanersâ€™ start-up machinery and equipment costs, S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 12-26-2120(24), dry cleaners are obligated to pay a sales tax on their services.  \r\n  While the trial judgeâ€™s statement that the majority quoted, â€œ[u]nlike most service \r\n  industries, dry cleaners have high startup costs as a result of heavy machinery \r\n  and equipmentâ€ may have been true in the 1950â€™s, [5]  it certainly is not the case in todayâ€™s economy.  \r\n  All service industries incur significant startup costs, whether they \r\n  come in the form of equipment, labor, rent, or other overhead costs.  I find \r\n  no reason today for singling out dry cleanersâ€™ startup costs as a justification \r\n  for imposing a sales tax upon their services when all other services also are \r\n  faced with high costs to enter the marketplace, yet a sales tax is not levied \r\n  on their services.  Therefore, in my view, segregating dry cleaning services \r\n  from all other services does not rationally relate to a legitimate government \r\n  purpose.\r\nII\r\nI would also find that Robinson raised \r\n  a genuine issue of material fact as to whether the 61 exemptions found in S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-46-2120, in toto, amount to an arbitrary classification \r\n  of different entities for tax purposes that is unconstitutional.  See City \r\n  of Laurens v. Anderson, 75 S.C. 62, 64, 55 S.E. 136, 137 (1906) (for a law \r\n  to be deemed constitutional, it  â€œmust possess two indispensable qualities: \r\n  [f]irst, it must be framed as to so extend to and embrace equally all persons \r\n  who are or may be in the like situation and circumstances; and secondly, the \r\n  classification must be natural and reasonable, not arbitrary and capricious.â€).  \r\n  Although this Court ruled in 1951 that the then 19 exemptions to the sales tax \r\n  were not a â€œtyrannical exercise of arbitrary power,â€ it is my view that they \r\n  would conclude that 61 exemptions would rise to that level.  State ex rel. \r\n  Roddey v. Byrnes, 219 S.C. 485, 515, 66 S.E.2d 33, 46 (1951).  \r\nThe State attempted to pigeonhole 33 of the exemptions \r\n  into six neat categories for tax classification purposes in an effort to illustrate \r\n  that the exemptions are not arbitrary and capricious.  In my opinion, the whimsical \r\n  nature of the other 28 exemptions renders this legislation arbitrary and capricious.  \r\n  For example, broadcasting companies fare well under the statute, as â€œall supplies, \r\n  technical equipment, machinery, and electricity sold to radio and television \r\n  stations, and cable television systems, for use in producing, broadcasting, \r\n  and distributing programsâ€ are exempted from the sales tax.  S.C. Code Ann. \r\n  Â§ 12-36-2120(26).  The same purchases are tax-free for motion picture companies.  \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120(43).  Vacation time-sharing plans are exempt.  S.C. \r\n  Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120(31).  Promotional direct mail advertising materials are \r\n  also exempt.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120(58).   \r\nBased on the foregoing reasoning, I would \r\n  hold that the legislature had no rational basis for singling out dry cleaners \r\n  from other services for sales tax purposes, and I would reverse the trial judgeâ€™s \r\n  grant of summary judgment and remand the exemption issue to determine whether \r\n  the entire retail tax exemption statute is unconstitutional based on its whimsical \r\n  treatment of various entities for tax purposes.  \r\nActing Justice Diane S. Goodstein, concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    U.S. Const. amend. XIV; S.C. Const. art. I, Â§ 3.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [2]There are currently sixty-one exemptions.  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 12-36-2120 \r\n    (Supp. 2002).  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]\r\n  We note that even if we were to find the exemptions unconstitutional it would \r\n    not render Robinsonâ€™s tax burden unconstitutional.

Taggart, S.C. Office of Appellate Defense, \r\n  of Columbia, for Respondent/Petitioner.\r\nAttorney General Henry Dargan McMaster, Chief Deputy Attorney General John \r\n  W.

Myers, of Lexington; for Petitioner/Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  This matter is before the Court on both partiesâ€™ petitions \r\n  for a writ of certiorari seeking review of the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision in \r\n  State v. Dunbar, 354 S.C. 479, 581 S.E.2d 840 (2003).  We deny respondent/petitionerâ€™s \r\n  (â€œDunbarâ€) petition for certiorari and grant petitioner/respondentâ€™s (â€œStateâ€) \r\n  petition for certiorari.  We dispense with further briefing and vacate a portion \r\n  of the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion because they reached unpreserved grounds in \r\n  addressing the search warrant obtained in this case.\r\nFactual/Procedural Background\r\nInvestigators with the Lexington \r\n  County Sheriffâ€™s Department set up a controlled buy with Dunbar and his co-defendant, \r\n  Smalls, based on information received from a confidential informant.  The informant, \r\n  in the presence of Officer Rainwater, the lead investigator of the case, called \r\n  the men at their hotel room to setup the buy for five ounces of powder cocaine.  \r\n  The informant told Rainwater he was to meet Dunbar and Smalls, black males, \r\n  at a gas station that afternoon and they would be driving a blue Cadillac with \r\n  wire rims.\r\nWith officers surrounding the scene, the informant waited \r\n  at the gas station for Dunbar and Smalls to arrive.  Dunbar and Smalls arrived \r\n  at the gas station approximately 30 minutes after the phone conversation.  They \r\n  were driving a blue Cadillac with wire rims.  The informant got into the back \r\n  seat of the car and stayed about 15 seconds before getting back out of the vehicle; \r\n  this was a pre-arranged visual signal to the officers there were drugs in the \r\n  vehicle.  The driver, Smalls, then fled the scene and was captured after a 100-yard \r\n  chase.  Dunbar, who remained in the front passenger seat of the vehicle, was \r\n  arrested and removed from the vehicle.  An open brown paper lunch bag was found \r\n  sitting upright by Dunbarâ€™s left foot.  After both Smalls and Dunbar were arrested, \r\n  the vehicle was searched, and the officers found five ounces of powder cocaine \r\n  inside the brown paper bag.\r\nAfter retrieving the cocaine \r\n  from the vehicle, Rainwater noticed a hotel room key on the key chain left in \r\n  the carâ€™s ignition.  The key was inscribed with a room number.  Based on the \r\n  informantâ€™s previous dealings with Dunbar, he knew Dunbar stayed at a hotel \r\n  while in Columbia.  The informant had alerted Rainwater to this fact and told \r\n  him to look for a hotel key.  When asked, Dunbar informed Rainwater he and Smalls \r\n  were staying at the Ramada Inn in West Columbia.\r\nBased \r\n  on the seizure of the cocaine and the information concerning the hotel room, \r\n  Rainwater sought a warrant to search the room.  Rainwater telephoned the magistrate \r\n  and discussed the probable cause to issue the search warrant.  Rainwater did \r\n  not, however, proceed to the magistrateâ€™s office to obtain the warrant, but \r\n  instead sent another officer from his investigation team, Oâ€™Quinn.  Oâ€™Quinn \r\n  testified, â€œIt was my duty to get [the search warrant] back to the agents on \r\n  the scene in an expeditious manner so that hopefully if anybody was in the room \r\n  that none of the evidence would be . . . destroyed.â€  While Oâ€™Quinn went to \r\n  retrieve the search warrant, the investigative team went to the hotel and waited \r\n  for Oâ€™Quinnâ€™s arrival.\r\nWhen \r\n  Oâ€™Quinn arrived at the magistrateâ€™s office, the magistrate was on the telephone \r\n  with Rainwater.  Oâ€™Quinn testified the magistrate drafted the search warrant \r\n  and affidavit based on information received over the telephone from Rainwater.  \r\n  Oâ€™Quinn was sworn by the magistrate, [1]  reviewed the warrant and signed the affidavit accompanying \r\n  the search warrant.  Although Oâ€™Quinn did not see a majority of the events that \r\n  took place, he was part of Rainwaterâ€™s investigative team and had personal knowledge \r\n  that a narcotics deal had occurred.  Oâ€™Quinn also had knowledge of the facts \r\n  contained in the affidavit from the information Rainwater told him in the course \r\n  of the investigation. [2] \r\nDunbar \r\n  made a pre-trial motion to suppress the evidence based on the Fourth Amendment \r\n  of the United States Constitution and the South Carolina Constitution.  During \r\n  the in camera hearing to determine the admissibility of the evidence, \r\n  Dunbarâ€™s search warrant argument centered on the fact that the issuing magistrate \r\n  was not neutral and detached.  He also argued the affidavit lacked probable \r\n  cause because Oâ€™Quinn signed it without personal knowledge and the credibility \r\n  of the informant was not stated.  Dunbar cited Nathanson v. United States \r\n  [3]  as his sole authority for the affidavit argument.  The trial court \r\n  rejected Dunbarâ€™s arguments and allowed the evidence to be admitted.  Using \r\n  a totality of the circumstances approach, he found the informantâ€™s information \r\n  was corroborated and exigent circumstances required the action taken.  The Court \r\n  of Appeals reversed the trial judge, finding the search warrant did not comply \r\n  with the warrant statute.\r\nThe Court of Appeals addressed the search warrant, and its \r\n  underlying affidavit, by analyzing the issue under S.C. Code Ann. Â§17-13-140 \r\n  (2003), even though the statute was not argued during the trial.  The State \r\n  now contends the Court of Appeals erred by basing their decision to reverse \r\n  the trial court on the warrant statute.  We agree.\r\nLaw/Analysis\r\nIn order for an issue \r\n  to be preserved for appellate review, it must have been raised to and ruled \r\n  upon by the trial judge.  Issues not raised and ruled upon in the trial court \r\n  will not be considered on appeal.  Humbert v. State, 345 S.C. 332, 548 \r\n  S.E.2d 862 (2001).  A party need not use the exact name of a legal doctrine \r\n  in order to preserve it, but it must be clear that the argument has been presented \r\n  on that ground.  State v. Russell, 345 S.C. 128, 546 S.E.2d 202 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001).  A party may not argue one ground at trial and an alternate ground \r\n  on appeal.  State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 548 S.E.2d 213 (2001); State \r\n  v. Benton, 338 S.C. 151, 526 S.E.2d 228 (2000)(argued one ground in support \r\n  of circumstantial evidence charge at trial and another ground in support of \r\n  the charge on appeal).  No point will be considered which is not set forth in \r\n  the statement of issues on appeal.  Rule 208(b)(1)(B), SCACR; State v. Bray, \r\n  342 S.C. 23, 535 S.E.2d 636 (2000)(it is error for an appellate court to consider \r\n  issues not raised to it); State v. Prioleau, 345 S.C. 404, 548 S.E.2d \r\n  213 (2001).  An issue that was not preserved for review should not be addressed \r\n  by the Court of Appeals, and the courtâ€™s opinion should be vacated to the extent \r\n  it addressed an issue that was not preserved.  Hendrix v. Eastern Distribution, \r\n  Inc., 320 S.C. 218, 464 S.E.2d 112 (1995).\r\nDuring trial, Dunbar never made mention of the warrant statute.  His written \r\n  motion makes mention of the United States and South Carolina constitutions only.  \r\n  During the in camera hearing, Dunbar cited only one federal case \r\n  in support of his affidavit argument.  It is not clear whether Dunbar based \r\n  his argument on federal or state grounds, but nowhere in the record does Dunbar \r\n  cite or make reference to the warrant statute.  The Court of Appeals addressed \r\n  the warrant statute sua sponte and was incorrect to base its decision \r\n  on the statute.\r\nAccordingly, because the warrant statute argument was not raised to the trial \r\n  court below for a ruling and, thus, is not preserved for appellate review, we \r\n  vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ opinion to the extent it addresses the search warrant \r\n  and the underlying affidavit at issue.\r\nConclusion\r\nFor the foregoing reasons, we vacate the Court of Appealsâ€™ \r\n  opinion reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision to admit evidence obtained pursuant \r\n  to the search warrant at issue and remand this issue to the Court of Appeals \r\n  so it may address the United States and South Carolina constitutional issues \r\n  Dunbar raised on appeal.\r\n VACATED IN PART AND REMANDED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ.,\r\nconcur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  There is no testimony whether Rainwater was sworn \r\n    by the magistrate.

Bray v. Marathon Corp., 347 \r\n  S.C. 189, 553 S.E.2d 477 (Ct. App. 2001).  We affirm in part and reverse in \r\n  part. \r\nFACTS\r\nBaron Blackmon was a maintenance mechanic at General Electricâ€™s manufacturing \r\n  plant located in Florence, South Carolina.  Bray and Blackmon had been co-workers \r\n  for approximately fifteen years.  On March 5, 1994, Blackmon was inside a Ram-Jet \r\n  Trash Compactor [1]  manufactured \r\n  by respondent/petitioner Marathon and leased to General Electric by respondent/petitioner \r\n  American Refuse Systems, Inc. (hereinafter collectively referred to as Marathon).  \r\n  When Bray approached the trash compactor to discard a bag of trash, Blackmon \r\n  asked Bray to start the compactor.  Because Blackmon was inside the compactor, \r\n  Bray declined until Blackmon assured her it was safe to do so.\r\nBray pressed the â€œstartâ€ button, which caused the ram to move toward \r\n  Blackmon instead of away from him.  Bray attempted to stop the compactor, but \r\n  the ram would remain stopped only as long as she maintained continuous pressure \r\n  on the â€œstopâ€ button.  Blackmon was pinned inside the compactor, so Bray released \r\n  the button and ran for help.  Upon her return, she found Blackmon blue and unconscious.  \r\n  Blackmon subsequently died from his injuries. \r\n  [2]   \r\nBray filed this products liability action against Marathon for breach \r\n  of implied and express warranty, strict liability, and negligence. [3]   She alleged she suffered serious and permanent \r\n  physical injuries caused by the emotional trauma of witnessing her co-workerâ€™s \r\n  death.\r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to Marathon on all causes \r\n  of action.  The court found Bray was not in direct danger from the operation \r\n  of the compactor and her alleged injuries were the result of observing Blackmonâ€™s \r\n  injuries.  The court noted that any claim Bray had would have to be analyzed \r\n  under Kinard v. Augusta Sash &amp; Door Co., 286 S.C. 579, 336 S.E.2d \r\n  465 (1985). [4]   However, the \r\n  court found Bray could not recover as a bystander because Blackmon and Bray \r\n  were not closely related.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision granting \r\n  summary judgment on Brayâ€™s negligence claim and reversed the decision granting \r\n  summary judgment on her strict liability claim.  Further, the court found that \r\n  because Bray did not present an argument regarding the warranty claims, that \r\n  issue was deemed abandoned.\r\nISSUE I\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by reversing the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision granting summary judgment on Brayâ€™s strict liability claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nThe strict liability action for defective products was established by the Legislature \r\n  in S.C. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 15-73-10 to -30 (1976).  Section 15-73-10 (1) provides:  \r\n  â€œOne who sells any product in a defective condition unreasonably dangerous to \r\n  the user or consumer or to his property is subject to liability for physical \r\n  harm caused to the ultimate user or consumer . . .â€\r\nBray was a user of the trash compactor because she operated the controls \r\n  on the compactor in an effort to assist Blackmon.  See Restatement (Second) \r\n  of Torts Â§ 402A, cmt. l (1965) (â€œuserâ€ includes those who are utilizing the \r\n  product for purpose of doing work upon it); \r\n  [5]  Curcio v. Caterpillar, Inc., 344 S.C. 266, 543 S.E.2d 264 (Ct. \r\n  App. 2001) (employee performing maintenance on equipment was â€œuserâ€ of product).  \r\n  Further, under Padgett v. Colonial Wholesale Distrib. Co., \r\n  232 S.C. 593, 103 S.E.2d 265 (1958), Brayâ€™s alleged physical injuries arising \r\n  from emotional trauma constitute physical harm. \r\nA products liability plaintiff must prove the product defect was \r\n  the proximate cause of the injury sustained.  Small v. Pioneer Machinery, \r\n  Inc., 329 S.C. 448, 494 S.E.2d 835 (Ct. App. 1997) (citing Livingston \r\n  v. Noland Corp., 293 S.C. 521, 362 S.E.2d 16 (1987) (proof must be sufficient \r\n  to show defect was direct and efficient cause of plaintiffâ€™s injury)).  Proximate \r\n  cause requires proof of both causation in fact and legal cause, which is proved \r\n  by establishing foreseeability.  Id.  Marathon contends the Court of \r\n  Appeals erred by finding Brayâ€™s injuries were foreseeable given her strict liability \r\n  claim arose from injuries to another.\r\nWe find the Court of Appeals properly concluded that the bystander \r\n  analysis of Kinard does not apply to a strict liability cause of action.  \r\n  A user of a defective product is not a mere bystander but a primary and direct \r\n  victim of the product defect.  Accord Kately v. Wilkinson, 195 \r\n  Cal. Rptr. 902 (Cal. Ct. App. 1983) (plaintiff, who was owner and driver of \r\n  boat that killed daughterâ€™s friend, allowed to proceed on products liability \r\n  claim as user of product); Gnirk v. Ford Motor Co., 572 F. Supp. 1201 \r\n  (D.S.D. 1983) (manufacturer owed independent legal duty to plaintiff due to \r\n  status as user of car involved in accident, rather than as bystander).  Because \r\n  Â§ 15-73-10 limits liability to the user or consumer, there is no need for a \r\n  limitation on foreseeable victims to avoid disproportionate liability as was \r\n  found necessary in the bystander setting.  It is not unreasonable to conclude \r\n  the user of a defective product might suffer physical harm from emotional damage \r\n  if the use of the product results in death or serious injury to a third person, \r\n  irrespective of the relationship between the user and third person. [6] \r\nWe find there is a genuine issue of fact regarding whether the event \r\n  in which Brayâ€™s co-worker lost his life was the proximate cause of Brayâ€™s physical \r\n  harm.  See Conner v. City of Forest Acres, 348 S.C. 454, 560 S.E.2d \r\n  606 (2002) (summary judgment appropriate only if no genuine issue of material \r\n  fact).  Therefore, we affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ reversal of the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision granting summary judgment on Brayâ€™s strict liability claim.\r\nISSUE II\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by affirming the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision granting summary judgment on Brayâ€™s negligence claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nBray asserts a products liability claim for negligence under Padgett v. \r\n  Colonial Wholesale Distrib. Co., supra.  The Padgett court \r\n  held that a plaintiff may recover for a physical or bodily injury that results \r\n  from mental and emotional trauma in the absence of physical impact.  See \r\n  also Spaugh v. Atlantic Coast Line R. Co., 158 S.C. 25, 155 S.E. \r\n  145 (1930) (suffering from nervous breakdown, as result of defendantâ€™s negligence, \r\n  would support verdict for plaintiff); Mack v. South-Bound R. Co., 52 \r\n  S.C. 323, 29 S.E. 905 (1898) (defendant liable for injuries sustained as result \r\n  of mere fright and mental disturbance caused by its negligence).  Because Padgett \r\n  allows recovery for injuries sustained as a consequence of shock, fright, and \r\n  emotional upset, Bray may be able to recover for her alleged injuries that arose \r\n  from the sudden fright she felt when the machine she was operating crushed her \r\n  co-worker.\r\nBray further argues the Court of Appeals erred by finding her strict liability \r\n  claim could survive a summary judgment motion but her negligence claim could \r\n  not on the element of proximate cause.  She argues that, under either claim, \r\n  she was a foreseeable victim.  While proceeding on one theory of recovery under \r\n  products liability and not proceeding on another is permissible, see \r\n  Bragg v. Hi-Ranger, Inc., 319 S.C. 531, 462 S.E.2d 321 (Ct. App. 1995), \r\n  if a person is considered a â€œdirect victimâ€ for the purposes of one products \r\n  liability cause of action, this person must be a direct victim for all causes \r\n  of action.  It is too fine a distinction to say Bray is a user and therefore \r\n  a foreseeable plaintiff under a strict liability theory, but that she is not \r\n  a â€œdirect victimâ€ and not a foreseeable plaintiff under a negligence cause of \r\n  action.  Therefore, the trial court improperly granted Marathonâ€™s summary judgment \r\n  motion on Brayâ€™s negligence claim and the Court of Appeals is reversed on this \r\n  issue.\r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision regarding Brayâ€™s strict liability \r\n  claim and reverse the decision regarding her negligence claim.  We further affirm \r\n  the courtâ€™s ruling that Bray abandoned her breach of warranty claims.  See \r\n  First Sav. Bank v. McLean, 314 S.C. 361, 444 S.E.2d 513 (1994) (issue \r\n  not argued in brief deemed abandoned and precludes consideration on appeal).\r\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER and BURNETT, JJ., concurs.  PLEICONES, J., \r\n  concurring in part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\nJUSTICE PLEICONES:  I concur in part and dissent in part, and would \r\n  affirm the decision of the Court of Appeals as written.\r\nI agree with the majority that a bystander who is the user of the \r\n  allegedly defective product, and who suffers physical harm from directly witnessing \r\n  injury to another, may maintain a strict liability claim.  See S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 15-73-10 (1) (1976); see e.g., Gnirk v. Ford Motor Co., \r\n  572 F. Supp. 1201 (D.S.D 1983).  Accordingly, I agree that we should affirm \r\n  the Court of Appealsâ€™ decision reversing the trial courtâ€™s grant of summary \r\n  judgment on Brayâ€™s strict liability claim.\r\nI disagree, however, with the majorityâ€™s decision to reinstate Brayâ€™s \r\n  negligence claim.  Fundamentally, I disagree with the majorityâ€™s holding that \r\n  if a plaintiff is considered a â€œdirect victim for the purposes of one products \r\n  liability cause of action, [then the plaintiff] must be a direct victim for \r\n  all [products liability] causes of action.â€  When pursuing a products claim \r\n  under a negligence theory, the plaintiff is subject to all the requirements \r\n  and defenses of an ordinary negligence claim.  See Hubbard and Felix, \r\n  The South Carolina Law of Torts 245-246 (2nd ed. 1997).  Where, \r\n  as here, the negligence claim is predicated on bystander liability, then I would \r\n  hold, as did the Court of Appeals, that the plaintiff must satisfy the foreseeability \r\n  requirements set forth in Kinard v. Augusta Sash and Door Co., 286 S.C. \r\n  579, 336 S.E.2d 465 (1985).  Bray seeks to recover for the injury she suffered \r\n  from witnessing the death of another: this claim brings her squarely within \r\n  Kinard.  She does not claim, as did the plaintiff in Padgett v. Colonial \r\n  Wholesale Distrib. Co., 232 S.C. 593, 103 S.E. 265 (1958), that her injuries \r\n  resulted directly from the defendantâ€™s negligence.  Bray cannot satisfy the \r\n  Kinard requirements and is therefore not a foreseeable victim.  The trial \r\n  court properly granted summary judgment on this theory, and the Court of Appeals \r\n  correctly affirmed that decision.\r\nAs the majority points out, the legislature has defined the class \r\n  of plaintiffs entitled to bring a strict liability products claim and we are \r\n  bound by the terms used in that statute.  When, however, the defective product \r\n  claim is predicated on negligence, and the plaintiff is merely a bystander, \r\n  then â€œthere isâ€¦need for a limitation on foreseeable victims to avoid disproportionate \r\n  liabilityâ€¦.â€  Policy requires that we limit foreseeable victims where the defective \r\n  product claim sounds in negligence. \r\n For the reasons given above, I would affirm the decision \r\n  of the Court of Appeals.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1] Blackmon \r\n    was allegedly inside the compactor for the purpose of repairing it. \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] A \r\n    report by the Engineering Design &amp; Testing Corporation indicated the machine \r\n    malfunctioned due to a defect in the manufacture of the compactor and a defect \r\n    in the compactorâ€™s design.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [3] Petitioner/respondent \r\n    Allan Bray also filed a loss of consortium claim.  However, because his claim \r\n    is dependent on his wifeâ€™s claims, only wifeâ€™s claims will be discussed.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4] The Kinard court \r\n    found that a bystander may have a cause of action for negligent infliction \r\n    of emotional distress.  The court adopted the cause of action with the following \r\n    elements:  (1) the negligence of the defendant must cause death or serious \r\n    physical injury to another; (2) the plaintiff bystander must be in close proximity \r\n    to the accident; (3) the plaintiff and the victim must be closely related; \r\n    (4) the plaintiff must contemporaneously perceive the accident; and (5) the \r\n    emotional distress must both manifest itself by physical symptoms capable \r\n    of objective diagnosis and be established by expert testimony.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [5] Section \r\n    15-73-30 provides that the comments to Â§ 402A of the Restatement of Torts, \r\n    Second, are incorporated as the legislative intent of the Defective Products \r\n    Act.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [6] In any event, we are without authority \r\n    to graft the Kinard bystander analysis on Â§ 15-73-10.  Where the legislature \r\n    has, by statute, acted upon a subject, the judiciary is limited to interpretation \r\n    and construction of that statute.  Barnwell v. Barber-Colman Co., 301 \r\n    S.C. 534, 393 S.E.2d 162 (1989) (finding punitive damages are not recoverable \r\n    under Defective Products Act); Schall v. Sturm, Ruger Co., Inc., 278 \r\n    S.C. 646, 300 S.E.2d 735 (1983) (absent clear legislative direction, strict \r\n    liability cause of action under Â§ 15-73-10 does not exist in South Carolina \r\n    where product entered stream of commerce prior to enactment of statute and \r\n    is alleged to have caused injury thereafter).  If the Act is to be amended \r\n    so as to provide for the requirement of a close relationship in the context \r\n    of a strict liability cause of action, this must be accomplished by the legislature, \r\n    not the court.  \r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25734","title":"In the Matter of Foster","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/opinions/displayOpinion.cfm?caseNo=25734","description":"In this opinion, Robert Paul Foster is publicly reprimanded for failing to supervise a non-lawyer employee who was handling real estate closings.","date":"2003-10-13","type":"opinion","text":"\r\n      \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n<!--\r\n.Normal\r\n\t{font-size:12.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteText\r\n\t{font-size:10.0pt;\r\n\tfont-family:\"Times New Roman\";}\r\n.MsoFootnoteReference\r\n\t{vertical-align:super;}\r\n-->\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA\r\nIn The Supreme Court\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nIn the Matter of Robert Paul Foster, Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nOpinion No. 25734\r\nSubmitted September 30, 2003 - Filed \r\n  October 13, 2003\r\n\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\nHenry B. Richardson, Jr., and Michael S. Pauley, both of Columbia, for the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nR. Davis Howser, of Columbia, for Respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RLDE, Rule 413, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the imposition of any of the sanctions set \r\n  forth in Rule 7(b), RLDE.  We accept the agreement and issue a public reprimand.  \r\n  The facts, as set forth in the agreement, are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent permitted a non-lawyer employee to perform real estate closings \r\n  in his absence and without his supervision, and he tacitly allowed her to sign \r\n  his name to the applicable real estate documents in each of the transactions.  \r\n  As a result of respondent's failure to supervise the non-lawyer employee, he \r\n  was not aware of inaccuracies in HUD-1 Settlement Statements prepared in a number \r\n  of the closings.  The HUD-1 Settlement Statements in these matters did not reflect \r\n  the complete transaction, nor did they accurately reflect the disbursements \r\n  being made in conjunction with the transactions.  Respondent recognizes that \r\n  the HUD-1 Settlement Statement is required by the Federal Truth in Lending Act \r\n  and that the incorrect information provided by the non-lawyer employee was at \r\n  variance with the purposes of the Act. \r\nRespondent also allowed the non-lawyer employee to be responsible for reconciliation \r\n  of the real estate escrow account for respondent's law firm.  Respondent failed \r\n  to properly maintain or supervise the reconciliation of the account in accordance \r\n  with Rule 417, SCACR, for over a year.\r\nRespondent represents that no client funds were misappropriated \r\n  as a result of the HUD-1 inaccuracies or his failure to reconcile the real estate \r\n  trust account.  In fact, respondent sought an independent audit of his law firm's \r\n  real estate escrow account which verified that no client funds were missing \r\n  from the account.  \r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that by his conduct he has violated the \r\n  following provisions of the Rules of Professional Conduct, Rule 407, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 1.1 (a lawyer shall provide competent representation to a client); Rule \r\n  1.2(a)(a lawyer shall abide by a client's decisions concerning the objectives \r\n  of representation and shall consult with the client as to the means by which \r\n  they are to be pursued); Rule 5.3(a)(a partner in a law firm shall make \r\n  reasonable efforts to ensure that the firm has in effect measures giving reasonable \r\n  assurance that the person's conduct is compatible with the professional obligations \r\n  of the lawyer); Rule 5.3(b)(a lawyer having direct supervisory authority over \r\n  the non-lawyer shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that the person's conduct \r\n  is compatible with the professional obligations of the lawyer); Rule \r\n  5.5(b)(a lawyer shall not assist a person who is not a member of the bar in \r\n  the performance of activity that constitutes the unauthorized practice of law); \r\n  and Rule 8.4(a) (it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to violate the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct).\r\nRespondent also admits that he has violated the following \r\n  provisions of the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement, Rule 413, SCACR: \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (it shall be a ground for discipline for a lawyer to violate the \r\n  Rules of Professional Conduct) and Rule 7(a)(5) (it shall be a ground for discipline \r\n  for a lawyer to engage in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice \r\n  or to bring the courts or the legal profession into disrepute or to engage in \r\n  conduct demonstrating an unfitness to practice law).\r\nConclusion\r\nRespondent has cooperated fully in the investigation of \r\n  this matter. [1]   Respondent \r\n  represents that he has implemented procedures and safeguards within his law \r\n  firm to prevent not only mistakes of this nature from happening again, but also \r\n  to prevent future violations of any of the Rules of Professional Conduct, particularly \r\n  as they relate to supervision of non-lawyer staff and account reconciliation, \r\n  including the institution of appropriate checks and balances.  Finally, respondent's \r\n  firm no longer handles real estate closings.\r\nAfter considering these mitigating circumstances, we find \r\n  a public reprimand is the appropriate sanction in this matter.  See In \r\n  re Lester, 353 S.C. 246, 578 S.E.2d 7 (2001).  Accordingly, we accept the \r\n  Agreement for Discipline by Consent and publicly reprimand respondent for his \r\n  actions.\r\nPUBLIC REPRIMAND.       \r\n TOAL, C.J., MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., \r\n  concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  Respondent and his partner in his law firm self-reported \r\n    these violations after discovering irregularities in HUD-1 Settlement Statements \r\n    in several files.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25735","title":"Davis v.

Verenes, of Fox &amp; Verenes, of Aiken, for Guardian Ad\r\nLitem.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT:  Charles Edward Davis (â€œFatherâ€) \r\n  appeals the decision of the court below awarding custody of Child to Mary Lu \r\n  Davis (â€œMotherâ€).  Davis v. Davis, Op. No. 2001-UP-360 (Ct. App. filed \r\n  July 12, 2001).  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nFather and Mother were married in December 1992.  \r\n  Child was born in March 1995.  During the first 26 months of Childâ€™s life, Father \r\n  and Mother mutually agreed Mother would remain home as Childâ€™s primary caregiver.  \r\n  Father continued work outside of the home, but remained actively involved in \r\n  Childâ€™s life.  Father assumed a greater caregiver role upon Motherâ€™s returning \r\n  to work outside the home.\r\nFather and Mother separated in October 1997.  Mother \r\n  retained temporary custody of Child while Father had visitation rights including \r\n  custody of the Child every other weekend.  Additionally, Mother worked amicably \r\n  with Father to ensure he could see his son during the week.\r\nAt the final custody hearing, Mother stated she intended \r\n  to move to Beaufort if she won custody to be nearer to relatives.  She testified \r\n  she would not move if Father were awarded custody.\r\nThe Child has lived in Aiken since birth; attended \r\n  the same day care for several years; had a network of regular friends with whom \r\n  he played; and his doctors were in the Aiken area.  \r\nBoth the court-appointed psychologist and the guardian \r\n  ad litem testified the decision to award custody was an extremely close question.  \r\n  Ultimately each concluded the Mother should be granted custody of Child, provided \r\n  she remain in Aiken.  If she returned to Beaufort, both determined it would \r\n  be in Childâ€™s best interest that custody be granted to Father.  The psychologist \r\n  noted moving to Beaufort would not be in Childâ€™s best interest because it would \r\n  limit contact with Father, resulting in a negative impact on their relationship \r\n  and, thus, a negative impact on Child.\r\nThe family court awarded custody to Father, and granted \r\n  liberal visitation rights, telephone access, and records access to Mother.  \r\n  The Court of Appeals reversed.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err in reversing the family courtâ€™s\r\ngrant of custody to Father because it relied on Motherâ€™s testimony that she would move out of the area if\r\ngranted custody?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nWhile child custody cases are always difficult, the \r\n  process is often further eroded by the actions of the parents who seek to place \r\n  their own interests over those of their child.  This is not so with the case \r\n  before us.  With few exceptions this case has been noted for its lack of acrimony \r\n  between Father and Mother, with each parent striving to do what is in their \r\n  sonâ€™s best interests.  The parents present this Court with the rare case where \r\n  we can be assured that either parent is capable of providing a safe, stable, \r\n  and loving home for the child.  \r\nWe are guided by several principles in reviewing a custody order.  First, an \r\n  appellate court may find facts in accordance with its own view of the preponderance \r\n  of the evidence.  Rutherford v. Rutherford, 307 S.C. 199, 414 S.E.2d \r\n  157 (1992).  \r\nSecond, the appellate court need not disregard the findings of the family court \r\n  or ignore the fact the family court judge, who observed the witnesses, was in \r\n  a better position to judge their credibility and assign comparative weight to \r\n  the testimony.  Cherry v. Thomasson, 276 S.C. 524, 525, 280 S.E.2d 541, \r\n  541 (1981).  This degree of deference is â€œespecially true in cases involving \r\n  the welfare and best interests of children.â€  Dixon v. Dixon, 336 S.C. \r\n  260, 262-63, 519 S.E.2d 357, 358-59 (Ct. App. 1999).         \r\nThird, â€œ[t]he welfare of the child and what is in his/her best interest is \r\n  the primary, paramount and controlling consideration of the court in all child \r\n  custody controversies.â€  Cook v. Cobb, 271 S.C. 136, 140, 245 S.E.2d \r\n  612, 614 (1978); cf.  South Carolina Depâ€™t of Soc. Servs. v. Vanderhorst, \r\n  287 S.C. 554, 340 S.E.2d 149 (1986).   \r\nThe Court of Appeals concluded the family court erred \r\n  in awarding custody to Father because Mother was the primary caregiver of their \r\n  son.  The Court of Appeals also relied on the psychologistâ€™s and guardian ad \r\n  litemâ€™s testimony that Mother should be the custodial parent.  \r\nImportantly, the court agreed with Mother that the \r\n  family court penalized her for her stated desire to move to Beaufort if she \r\n  were awarded custody of the Child.  The Court of Appeals wrote:\r\n\r\nWe find it troublesome that Mother, who was [Childâ€™s] primary caregiver for \r\n  all four years of his life until the time of the final hearing, was recommended \r\n  to be the custodial parent by both the guardian and the court-appointed psychologist, \r\n  yet she was denied custody based on a contingency, i.e., a move that has never \r\n  occurred.  Mother has never moved to Beaufort and has continued to live in Aiken \r\n  to be near her son since the final custody hearing.  \r\n. . . .\r\nWe find . . . that it would be unjust under the circumstances to penalize Mother \r\n  based on a contingency that has not transpired and that Mother should have been \r\n  awarded custody.  \r\n\r\nDavis, supra at 5-6.\r\nInitially we note this is not a case where a custodial parent requests a modification \r\n  of a custody order to move the child from a particular area.  See, e.g., \r\n  McAlister v. Patterson, 278 S.C. 481, 299 S.E.2d 322 (1982); Rice \r\n  v. Rice, 335 S.C. 449, 517 S.E.2d 220 (Ct. App. 1999); Eckstein v. Eckstein, \r\n  306 S.C. 167, 410 S.E.2d 578 (Ct. App. 1991); Cf. S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(30) \r\n  (Supp. 2000).  Rather this case presents us the novel question whether a parentâ€™s \r\n  avowed desire to move if awarded custody may be a factor in determining custody.  \r\n  We believe it may be.\r\nMotherâ€™s stated desire to move if granted custody \r\n  becomes one of many factors the family court must consider when determining \r\n  whether it is in the Childâ€™s best interest to be in the custody of Mother or \r\n  Father.  Her desire to move is simply one factor in a constellation of relevant \r\n  factors that a family court judge must consider when making the paramount determination \r\n  of the best interest of the child.  \r\nIn cases where custody is a close question, as here, \r\n  it may become the deciding factor.  That it may be the deciding factor causes \r\n  no more of a constitutional infirmity than if the deciding factor is based upon \r\n  one parent having been the childâ€™s primary caregiver.\r\nBoth the court-appointed psychologist and guardian ad litem testified it would \r\n  be in Childâ€™s best interest to be with Mother.  However, their recommendations \r\n  changed when they considered Motherâ€™s desire to move to an area several hours \r\n  away.  [1]   Under such a scenario both recommended \r\n  Father receive primary custody of Child.\r\nEach expressed concern that moving Child away from Father would impair the \r\n  critical father-son bond which was strongly present in the two.  In other words, \r\n  such a move would not be in the childâ€™s best interest. \r\n  [2] \r\nA courtâ€™s paramount concern \r\n  in determining which parent shall have custody is to protect the best interest \r\n  of the child.  The preponderance of the evidence demonstrates that it is in \r\n  Childâ€™s best interest to be with Father in Aiken.  \r\nWe REVERSE. \r\nTOAL, C.J., and WALLER, \r\n  J., concur.  MOORE, J., dissenting in a separate opinion in which PLEICONES, \r\n  J., concurs.\r\n JUSTICE MOORE:  I respectfully dissent.  Mother should not \r\n  be penalized for her intention to move.  As provided in S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 20-7-420(30) \r\n  (Supp. 2002), a custodial parent cannot be prohibited from moving absent a compelling \r\n  reason:\r\n\r\n[T]he court may not issue an order which prohibits a custodial \r\n  parent from moving his residence to a location within the State unless the court \r\n  finds a compelling reason or unless the parties have agreed to such a prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe custody decision here essentially turned on the single factor of Motherâ€™s \r\n  expressed intention to move.  Rather than prohibit the move, the family court \r\n  simply denied custody, a decision that in my opinion violates the spirit of \r\n  Â§ 20-7-420(30).  \r\nThe preponderance of the evidence does not indicate a compelling reason to \r\n  deny Mother custody because of her intent to move.  Accordingly, I would affirm \r\n  the Court of Appeals and award Mother custody.\r\nPLEICONES, J., concurs.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  The Court of Appeals opinion \r\n    improperly relies on the fact that Mother had not moved to Beaufort.  The \r\n    courtâ€™s reliance on this matter is improper for two reasons.  First, the fact \r\n    is outside of the record and therefore should not be considered.  Rule 210(h), \r\n    SCACR.  Second, Mother testified that she would stay in Aiken if Father were \r\n    granted custody.  Since the family court awarded custody to Father, Motherâ€™s \r\n    presence in Aiken is neither surprising nor relevant to the issue of whether \r\n    Mother would move to Beaufort if granted custody of the Child.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [2] A host of other factors further supported \r\n    the family court in determining Childâ€™s best interests was served by remaining \r\n    in the Aiken area.  Child had lived in the area his entire life.

Owens, Toni C. Yarber, Ron Thomas, Candace \r\n  R. Thomas, James Waldon, Lela Waldon, Reginald Perry, Jeanette Perry, Theodore \r\n  Cole, Susan Irwin, Mike Irwin, Webb Thompson, and Diane Thompson (Claimants) \r\n  against co-defendants Carl Brazell Builders, Inc., Essex Homes Southeast, Inc., \r\n  Rex Thompson Builders, Inc., Marc Homebuilders, Inc., and Henry O. Jacob Builders, \r\n  Inc. (Corporate Defendants or Contractors).  \r\nUnderlying Litigation [1] \r\nBefore 1990, \r\n  American Newland Associates began developing  the Summit Development, an upscale \r\n  multi-use planned residential subdivision, in Columbia, South Carolina.  Ultimately, \r\n  the developers subdivided the Summit and sold the sites to residential contractors, \r\n  including Contractors, who then sold property to Claimants. \r\nIn August 2001, Claimants filed \r\n  an amended complaint in state court against Contractors asserting claims for \r\n  class certification, negligence, gross negligence, recklessness, willful/wanton \r\n  conduct, negligent misrepresentation, fraudulent concealment, and violations \r\n  of the South Carolina Unfair Trade Practices Act.  They alleged the Summit construction \r\n  site was once called â€œthe Pontiac Precision Rangeâ€ and was used by the United \r\n  States Department of Defense (DOD) as a training site for aerial bombing during \r\n  World War II.  The DODâ€™s assessment and evaluation of the Pontiac Precision \r\n  Range disclosed the presence of potentially hazardous materials on the property.  \r\n  Claimants alleged that, in spite of the presence of potentially hazardous materials, \r\n  the development continued and developers sold lots to residential contractors, \r\n  including Contractors.   \r\n The following \r\n  is specified in the Order of Certification:\r\n\r\nAll of the plaintiffsâ€™ allegations \r\n  in the underlying Amended Complaint arise out of the theory that the contractors \r\n  and homebuilders, including the corporate defendants, knew of the presence of \r\n  hazardous materials at the Summit property and failed to disclose information \r\n  prior to each claimantâ€™s purchase of their respective homes.  All of the damages \r\n  claimed in the underlying case are economic in nature and some of the damages \r\n  arise out of the diminution in value of the plaintiffsâ€™ respective properties \r\n  caused by the potential presence of the allegedly hazardous materials.  \r\n\r\nInsurers are \r\n  defending Contractors in the underlying state court litigation under a reservation \r\n  of rights.  They assert in the current action that the CGL policies issued to \r\n  Contractors preclude coverage for the claims in the underlying litigation.  \r\n\r\nThe subject CGL policies provide, \r\n  in part, as follows:\r\nSECTION I - COVERAGES UNDER COVERAGE A -BODILY INJURY \r\n  AND PROPERTY DAMAGE LIABILITY.\r\nParagraph 1, designated Insuring Agreement, \r\n  as follows:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    We will pay those sums that the insured \r\n  becomes legally obligated to pay as damages because \r\n  of â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ to which this \r\n  insurance applies.  We will have the right and duty \r\n  to defend any â€œsuitâ€ seeking those damages.  We may, at our \r\n  discretion, investigate any â€œoccurrenceâ€ and settle any claim \r\n  or â€œsuitâ€ that may result. \r\n  \r\n    This insurance applies to â€œbodily injuryâ€ and â€œproperty\r\n    damageâ€ only if: \r\n    \r\n    (1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ is caused \r\n  by an â€œoccurrenceâ€ which takes place in the â€œcoverage territoryâ€ ; and\r\n    \r\n    (2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€\r\n    occurs&nbsp;during the policy period.\r\n    . . .\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exclusions.\r\nThis insurance does not apply to:\r\n\r\n  \r\n    â€œbodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ expected or \r\n  intended from the standpoint of the insured.  This exclusion does not apply \r\n  to â€œbodily injuryâ€ resulting from the use of reasonable force to protect persons \r\n  or property.     \r\n\r\n\r\n. . . \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    (1)  â€œBodily injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ \r\n  arising out of the actual, alleged or threatened discharge, dispersal, seepage, \r\n  migration, release or escape of pollutants: \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      At or from any premises, site, or location which \r\n  is or was at any time owned or occupied by, or rented or \r\n  loaned to any insured;\r\n    \r\n      At or from any premises, site, or location which \r\n  is or was at any time used by or for any insured or others \r\n  for the handling, storage, disposal, processing or treatment of waste;\r\n    \r\n      Which are or were at any time transported, handled,\r\n      stored, treated, disposed \r\n  of, or processed as waste by or for any insured or \r\n  any person or organization for&nbsp; whom you may be legally \r\n  responsible; or\r\n    \r\n      At or from any premises, site or location on which \r\n  any insured or any contractors or subcontractors working directly or indirectly \r\n  on any insuredâ€™s behalf are performing operations: \r\n  \r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        if the pollutants brought on or to the premises, site or location in connection \r\n  with such operations by such insured, contractor or subcontractor; or\r\n        \r\n      \r\n        if the operations \r\n  are to test for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat, detoxify, or neutralize, \r\n  or in any way respond to or assess the effects of pollutants. \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n                    \r\n\r\n  \r\nSubparagraphs (a) and (d)(i) do not apply to â€œbodily \r\n  injuryâ€ or â€œproperty damageâ€ arising out of heat, smoke or fumes from a hostile \r\n  fire.\r\nAs used in this exclusion, hostile fire means one which \r\n  becomes uncontrollable or breaks out from where it was intended to be.  \r\n  \r\n(2)     Any loss, costs or expense arising out of any:\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      \r\n        Request, demand or order that any insured \r\n  or others test&nbsp;for, monitor, clean up, remove, contain, treat,\r\n        detoxify,&nbsp;or neutralize, or in any \r\n  way respond to, or assess the effects of pollutants; or     \r\n        \r\n      \r\n        Claim or suit by or on behalf of a governmental\r\n        authority for damages because of testing from, monitoring, \r\n  cleaning up, removing, containing, treating, detoxifying or neutralizing, or \r\n  in any way responding to, or assessing the effects of pollutants. \r\n    \r\nPollutants mean any solid, liquid, \r\n  gaseous, or thermal irritant or contaminate including \r\n  smoke, vapor, soot, fumes, acids, alkalis, chemicals and waste.  \r\n  Waste includes materials to be recycled, reconditioned, \r\n  or reclaimed.  \r\n  \r\n\r\nSECTION VÂ­ - DEFINTIONS AS FOLLOWS:\r\n          . . . \r\n\r\n  \r\n    â€œOccurrenceâ€ means an accident, including continuous \r\n  or repeated exposure to substantially the same general harmful conditions.\r\n\r\n            . . . \r\n\r\n  \r\n    â€œProperty damageâ€ means:\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n    \r\n      Physical injury to tangible property, including \r\n  all resulting loss of use of that property.  All such loss of use shall be deemed \r\n  to occur at the time of the physical injury that caused it; or\r\n      \r\n    \r\n      Loss of use of tangible property that is not physically\r\n      injured.  All such loss of use shall be deemed to occur \r\n  at the time of the â€œoccurrenceâ€ that caused it. \r\n  \r\n\r\n                    \r\nThe Court \r\n  accepted the following four certified questions from the United States District \r\n  Court for the District of South Carolina:\r\n\r\nI.      Do the subject CGL policies obligate the plaintiffs \r\n  to indemnify and defend the corporate defendants for the claims of the claimants \r\n  which are economic in nature and based solely on the diminution in value of \r\n  the claimantsâ€™ respective properties?\r\n  II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do the corporate defendantsâ€™ actions or inactions as alleged by the claimants \r\n  qualify as an â€œoccurrenceâ€ under the terms and conditions of the subject liability \r\n  policies?\r\n  III.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does the intentional act exclusion preclude coverage?\r\nIV.    Does the pollution exclusion \r\n  preclude coverage?  \r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\n\r\nI.  Do the subject CGL policies obligate the plaintiffs \r\n  to indemnify and defend the corporate defendants for the claims of the claimants \r\n  which are economic in nature and based solely on the diminution in value of \r\n  the claimantsâ€™ respective properties?\r\n\r\nInsurance policies are subject \r\n  to the general rules of contract construction.  B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc. \r\n  v. First Financial Ins. Co., 334 S.C. 529, 514 S.E.2d 327 (1999).  The Court \r\n  must give policy language its plain, ordinary, and popular meaning.  Id.  \r\n  When a contract is unambiguous, clear, and explicit, it must be construed according \r\n  to the terms the parties have used.  Id.  â€œQuestions of coverage and \r\n  the duty of a liability insurance company to defend a claim brought against \r\n  its insured are determined by the allegations of the third-partyâ€™s complaint.â€  \r\n  Isle of Palms Pest Control Co. v. Monticello Ins. Co., 319 S.C. 12, 16, \r\n  459 S.E.2d 318, 320 (Ct. App. 1994), affâ€™d 321 S.C. 310, 468 S.E.2d 304 \r\n  (1996). \r\nAs noted in the Order of Certification, \r\n\r\n\r\nAll of the plaintiffsâ€™ allegations in the underlying \r\n  Amended Complaint arise out of the theory that the contractors and homebuilders, \r\n  including the corporate defendants, knew of the presence of hazardous materials \r\n  at the Summit property and failed to disclose that information prior to each \r\n  claimantâ€™s purchase of their respective homes.  All of the damages claimed in \r\n  the underlying case are economic in nature and some of the damages arise out \r\n  of the diminution in value of the plaintiffsâ€™ respective properties caused by \r\n  the potential presence of the allegedly hazardous materials.   \r\n\r\nThe CGL policies provide coverage for â€œproperty \r\n  damageâ€ caused by an â€œoccurrence.â€  Â§ I (b)(1).  â€œProperty damageâ€ is defined \r\n  as either â€œ[p]hysical injury to tangible property, including all resulting loss \r\n  of use of that propertyâ€ or â€œ[l]oss of use of tangible property that is not \r\n  physically injured.â€  Â§ V (12).  The first definition of property damage is \r\n  applicable here. [2]   \r\nWe find the amended complaint in the underlying \r\n  action does not allege any physical injury which meets the definition of â€œproperty \r\n  damageâ€ provided in the CGL policies.  According to the Order of Certification, \r\n  Claimants do not allege any physical injury to their property, but solely economic \r\n  damages, particularly the diminished value of their property, as a result of \r\n  Contractorsâ€™ knowing sale of homes located on property containing hazardous \r\n  materials.  Under the unambiguous language of the policies, there is no property \r\n  damage and, therefore, no covered occurrence.  B.L.G. Enterprises, Inc., \r\n  v. First Financial Ins. Co., supra.  \r\nOur conclusion is consistent with decisions \r\n  in other jurisdictions.  Most courts hold the diminished value of tangible property \r\n  does not constitute property damage within the meaning of CGL policies which \r\n  define property damage as physical injury.  Hartford Accident and Indem. \r\n  Co. v. Pacific Mutual Life Ins. Co., 861 F.2d 250 (10th Cir. \r\n  1988) (recognizing that 1973 revision to standard CGL policies amending definition \r\n  of property damage from â€œinjuryâ€ to â€œphysical injuryâ€ was intended to preclude \r\n  coverage for intangible injuries such as diminution in value); State Farm \r\n  Fire and Cas.

Pope, of York, for Respondent-Appellant.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n JUSTICE WALLER:  \r\n  In February 2001, Willie Edward Gordon was convicted of trafficking in crack \r\n  cocaine and sentenced to thirty years.  He appeals, contending his conviction \r\n  is barred by double jeopardy.  The state appeals the trial courtâ€™s refusal to \r\n  sentence Gordon to life imprisonment without parole (LWOP) under the Two-Strikes \r\n  law.  We affirm both appeals.\r\nFACTS\r\nIn May 1997, \r\n  a seven-count indictment was handed down against Gordon.  On June 9-12, 1997, \r\n  the state proceeded to trial solely on count five of the indictment, trafficking \r\n  in crack cocaine in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 44-53-375(c). \r\n  [1]   Count five of the indictment reads:\r\n\r\nThat WILLIE E. GORDON, AKA â€œJRâ€ \r\n  AND TOMMY JAMES RHINEHART did Traffick in Crack Cocaine in York County, \r\n  on or about September 21st through September 23rd, \r\n  1996 by either: knowingly selling, delivering or distributing; or did purchase, \r\n  or bring into this State; or provide financial assistance or did otherwise aid, \r\n  abet, or attempt to sell, or deliver, or purchase, or bring into this State; \r\n  or did possess, either actually or constructively, twenty-eight grams or \r\n  more of crack cocaine, a Schedule II controlled substance under provisions \r\n  of Section 44-53-100 et. seq., . . . such conduct not having been authorized \r\n  by law and is a violation of Section 44-53-375(c)- Trafficking in Crack Cocaine.  \r\n  (emphasis supplied).\r\n\r\nNotably, count five does not \r\n  allege that Gordon in any way conspired to traffic crack.  Further, although \r\n  the trial court instructed the jury the statutory language of Â§ 44-53-375(c), \r\n  it did not give the jury a separate jury instruction concerning the law \r\n  of conspiracy.  The jury found Gordon guilty of trafficking, and he was sentenced \r\n  to thirty years.  \r\nThereafter, in October \r\n  2000, another indictment was issued against Gordon charging him with trafficking \r\n  crack cocaine, as follows:\r\n\r\nThat on or about September \r\n  27, 1996, in York County, South Carolina, the Defendant, Willie Edward Gordon, \r\n  Jr. AKA Jr. Gordon, did wilfully, unlawfully and knowingly sell and/or deliver \r\n  and/or bring into the State of South Carolina and/or provide financial assistance \r\n  and/or otherwise aid or abet and/or conspire with Spencer L. Gordon \r\n  to sell and/or was knowingly in actual or constructive possession of more \r\n  than 10 grams but less than 28 grams of Crack Cocaine as defined \r\n  in Sections 44-53-110, 44-53-210 (b)(4) and as such did Traffick Crack Cocaine, \r\n  in violation of Section 44-53-375, Code of Laws of South Carolina (1976, as \r\n  amended).  \r\n\r\n(emphasis supplied). \r\n  [2]     \r\nThe charges from the \r\n  2000 indictment were called for trial in February 2001.  Counsel for Gordon \r\n  moved to dismiss the 2000 indictment, contending the charges therein were all \r\n  part of â€œone continuing transaction,â€ essentially one conspiracy to traffic, \r\n  for which Gordon was convicted in 1997.  Accordingly, he contended the subsequent \r\n  prosecution was barred by double jeopardy.  The trial court ruled there were \r\n  two separate and distinct offenses and allowed the state to proceed on the 2000 \r\n  indictment.  The jury found Gordon guilty of trafficking.  \r\nIn light of Gordonâ€™s \r\n  1997 trafficking conviction, the state moved for a sentence of LWOP under the \r\n  Two-Strikes law, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (Supp 2002). [3]   The trial court declined to \r\n  impose a LWOP sentence, finding the crime charged in the 1997 indictment (September \r\n  21-23, 1996), and the one charged in the 2000 indictment (September 27, 1997), \r\n  were so closely connected in point of time as to come within the purview of \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50. [4]   Accordingly, the court held Gordon was not subject to a recidivist \r\n  sentence under the Two-Strikes law; he was sentenced to thirty years, concurrent \r\n  to the sentence imposed for his 1997 trafficking conviction. \r\nISSUES\r\n\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial \r\n  court err in refusing to quash the 2000 indictment on the ground that a subsequent \r\n  prosecution was barred by double jeopardy?  (Gordonâ€™s appeal)\r\n  \r\n    Did the trial \r\n  court err in refusing to sentence Gordon to LWOP? (Stateâ€™s appeal)\r\n\r\n  1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDOUBLE JEOPARDY  \r\nGordon asserts the conduct for \r\n  which he was convicted of trafficking in 1997 was â€œpart of a continuing course \r\n  of conduct that constituted one criminal act,â€ and was a continuing conspiracy \r\n  which continued through the events alleged in the 2000 indictment, such that \r\n  the 2001 prosecution was barred by double jeopardy. [5]   We disagree.  \r\nThe Double Jeopardy \r\n  clause protects against: (1) a second prosecution for the same offense after \r\n  acquittal; (2) a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction; and \r\n  (3) multiple punishments for the same offense.  State v. Nelson, 336 \r\n  S.C. 186, 519 S.E.2d 786 (1999); State v. Easler, 327 S.C. 121, 489 S.E.2d \r\n  617 (1997).  A substantive crime and a conspiracy to commit that crime are not \r\n  the &quot;same offense&quot; for double jeopardy purposes.  United States \r\n  v. Felix, 503 U.S. 378 (1992).  Conspiracies and the substantive offenses \r\n  committed in the course of those conspiracies may be charged separately.  United \r\n  States v. Love, 767 F.2d 1052, 1062 (4th Cir. 1985) citing Callanan \r\n  v. United States, 364 U.S. 587 (1960); Iannelli v. United States, \r\n  420 U.S. 770 (1975).  \r\nGordon argues his \r\n  1997 prosecution essentially involved the same conspiracy as the 2001 prosecution, \r\n  such that the latter is barred by double jeopardy.  We disagree.  Initially, \r\n  we note that the 1997 indictment charged Gordon with â€œtrafficking,â€ rather \r\n  than â€œconspiracy to traffic,â€ and there is absolutely no language whatsoever \r\n  in that indictment alleging Gordon in any way conspired to traffic cocaine.  \r\n  Moreover, although the trial court charged the jury the language of the trafficking \r\n  statute at the 1997 trial, it did not charge the jury concerning the elements \r\n  necessary to establish the offense of â€œconspiracy.â€ [6]   We find the 1997 trial was clearly a prosecution for a single \r\n  substantive offense of trafficking in cocaine, which occurred between September \r\n  21-23, 1996.  \r\nThe 1997 prosecution \r\n  involved events, details, and persons completely separate from the event proven \r\n  at Gordonâ€™s 2001 trial.  The 1997 indictment listed a very discrete period of \r\n  time (Sept. 21-23, 1996), alleged a different amount of cocaine than the 2000 \r\n  indictment (28 grams or more, as opposed to between 10-28 grams), and alleged \r\n  Gordon had trafficked with a different individual (Tommy James Rhinehart in \r\n  1997 indictment; Spencer Gordon in the 2000 indictment).  Moreover, the evidence \r\n  presented at the 1997 trial clearly demonstrated the substantive offense of \r\n  trafficking.  At that trial, the state proved that on September 23, 1996, police \r\n  were investigating Tommy Rhinehart, a suspected drug dealer.  Rhinehart left \r\n  his home and went down an alley toward Gordonâ€™s home, which was 50-75 yards \r\n  away.  When Rhinehart returned, police executed a search warrant on his home \r\n  and discovered two bags of crack cocaine, and a pill bottle also containing \r\n  crack.  Rhinehart decided to cooperate with police and told them he had gotten \r\n  the crack from Gordon.  Rhinehart testified Gordon had given him two bags of \r\n  crack, on Sat. Sept. 21, 1996, in the alley between their homes.  Rhinehart \r\n  sold that crack between Saturday and Monday, and paid Gordon $500.00 to pay \r\n  for it on Monday (Sep. 23rd), at which time Gordon gave him two more \r\n  bags.  We find this evidence clearly demonstrates the substantive offense \r\n  of trafficking, for which Gordon was convicted.  Accordingly, we find the 1997 \r\n  prosecution did not result in a conspiracy conviction, such that there is no \r\n  double jeopardy violation.\r\nNonetheless, Gordon \r\n  asserts that because the trial court charged the jury the language of the trafficking \r\n  statute at his 1997 trial, to wit, that a person who â€œaids, abets, attempts \r\n  or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, purchase, or bring [crack \r\n  cocaine] into this State . . . [is guilty of trafficking],â€ that his 2001 prosecution \r\n  was prohibited. We disagree. [7]   \r\nGordonâ€™s basic contention \r\n  is that, because the word â€œconspiresâ€ was included in the judgeâ€™s charge covering \r\n  the trafficking statute, Â§ 44-53-375(C), his 1997 trial was essentially rendered \r\n  a â€œconspiracyâ€ trial.  We disagree.  As noted previously, Gordon was not indicted \r\n  for conspiracy, and the jury was not charged on the law of conspiracy \r\n  at the 1997 trial.  Simply because the trial court instructed the jury the language \r\n  of the trafficking statute did not thereby transform his trafficking trial into \r\n  one for conspiracy.  As noted previously, a substantive crime and a conspiracy \r\n  to commit that crime are not the &quot;same offense&quot; for double jeopardy \r\n  purposes, and a defendant may be separately indicted for both offenses.  United \r\n  States v. Felix, supra; see also State v. Wilson, 311 \r\n  S.C. 382, 391, 429 S.E.2d 453, 458 (1993) (Toal, J. concurring, and noting that \r\n  conspiracy â€œis a completely separate offense from the substantive offenses which \r\n  are the objects of the conspiracy.â€).  Accordingly, even if we accept Gordonâ€™s \r\n  contention that he was tried for conspiracy in 2001, there is no double jeopardy \r\n  violation since he was properly tried and convicted of the substantive offense \r\n  of trafficking in 1997.  The circuit court properly ruled there were two separate \r\n  and distinct offenses.  \r\n2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCONTINUOUS COURSE OF CONDUCT\r\nGordon asserts the trial court \r\n  properly refused to impose a sentence of LWOP pursuant to the recidivist statute, \r\n  S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (a/k/a the Two-Strikes law), [8]  on the ground that his two trafficking offenses were committed \r\n  so closely in point of time as to be treated as one offense under S.C. Code \r\n  Ann. Â§ 17-25-50. [9]   The state, \r\n  citing this Courtâ€™s recent opinion in State v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, \r\n  579 S.E.2d 289 (2003), contends a trial court may not consider Â§ 17-25-45 in \r\n  conjunction with Â§ 17-25-50 in determining whether a recidivist sentence is \r\n  warranted under the Two-Strikes law.  We agree with Gordon that these statutes \r\n  must be construed together.  Accordingly, we overrule Benjamin and affirm \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s ruling that Gordonâ€™s two offenses were properly treated as \r\n  one for purposes of sentencing under the Two-Strikes law.  \r\nIn Benjamin, supra, \r\n  a majority of this Court held that the recidivist statute must be considered \r\n  independently of any other statute. [10]   It found the introductory \r\n  language to Â§ 17-25-45, to the effect that â€œNotwithstanding any other provision \r\n  of law [certain defendants] shall be sentenced to life in prison,&quot; barred \r\n  consideration of Â§ 17-25-50 in determining whether the defendant qualifies for \r\n  a Two-Strikes recidivist sentence.  353 S.C. at 445, 579 S.E.2d at 291.  We \r\n  find this holding contrary to both the legislative intent and prior precedent \r\n  of this Court.  \r\nStatutes which are part of the \r\n  same legislative scheme should be construed together.  Stardancer Casino, \r\n  Inc. v. Stewart, 347 S.C. 377, 556 S.E.2d 357 (2001).  In construing statutory \r\n  language, the statute must be read as a whole, and sections which are part of \r\n  the same general statutory law must be construed together and each one given \r\n  effect, if it can be done by any reasonable construction.   State v. Alls, \r\n  330 S.C. 528, 500 S.E.2d 781 (1998).  Furthermore, the court should not consider \r\n  the particular clause being construed in isolation, but should read it in conjunction \r\n  with the purpose of the whole statute and the policy of the law.  South Carolina \r\n  Coastal Council v. South Carolina State Ethics Comm'n, 306 S.C. 41, 44, \r\n  410 S.E.2d 245, 247 (1991).  Courts will reject the plain and ordinary meaning \r\n  of statutory language when to accept it would lead to a result so absurd that \r\n  it could not possibly have been intended by Legislature, or would defeat plain \r\n  legislative intention;  if possible we will construe a statute so as to escape \r\n  an absurd result and carry the legislative intention into effect.   Joseph \r\n  v. State, 351 S.C. 551, 571 S.E.2d 280 (2002).  Moreover, we are constrained \r\n  to strictly construe penal statutes in the defendant's favor.  State v. Blackmon, \r\n  304 S.C. 270, 403 S.E.2d 660 (1991).\r\nThis Court has previously \r\n  recognized that the predecessor to Â§ 17-25-45 (17-25-40) and Â§ 17-25-50 must \r\n  be construed together.  See State v. Stewart, 275 S.C. 447, 452, \r\n  272 S.E.2d 628, 631, n. 2 (1980) (recognizing that section 17-25-50 must be \r\n  read in conjunction with section 17-25-40, the predecessor to section 17-25-45).  \r\n  We have also recognized that Â§ 17-25-45 and Â§ 17-25-50 are part of an overall, \r\n  legislative scheme for recidivist sentencing.  See also State v. Muldrow, \r\n  259 S.C. 414, 192 S.E.2d 211 (1972) (statute directing trial court to treat \r\n  as one offense any number of offenses committed at times so closely connected \r\n  in point of time that they may be considered as one offense is applicable only \r\n  for purpose of sentencing under recidivist statute); Legare v. State, \r\n  333 S.C. 275, 509 S.E.2d 472 (1999) (recognizing that Â§ 17-25-50 is part of \r\n  the recidivist sentencing scheme).\r\nThe Benjamin \r\n  majority ignores these precedents and holds, under the guise of statutory construction, \r\n  that it is no longer appropriate or necessary to harmonize or reconcile Â§ 17-25-45 \r\n  with Â§ 17-25-50.  353 S.C. at 445, 579 S.E.2d at 291.  Under the majorityâ€™s \r\n  rationale, however, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 is rendered a nullity. \r\n  [11]   This cannot have been the intent of the Legislature; if it had intended \r\n  to repeal Â§ 17-25-50, it could have plainly said so.  Stardancer Casino v. \r\n  Stewart, supra; Tilley v. Pacesetter, 333 S.C. 33, 508 S.E.2d \r\n  16 (1998) (if legislature had intended certain result in statute it would have \r\n  said so).\r\nMoreover, we are persuaded \r\n  by the dissenting position in Benjamin, to wit:\r\n\r\nA recidivist is &quot;a habitual \r\n  criminal.  A criminal repeater.  An incorrigible criminal.  One who makes a \r\n  trade of crime.&quot;  Black's Law Dictionary, 1269 (6th Ed.1990).  Recidivist \r\n  legislation attempts to encourage offenders to stay out of trouble and punishes \r\n  those who refuse to be deterred even after a conviction.  Commonwealth v. \r\n  Eyster, 401 Pa.Super. 477, 585 A.2d 1027, 1031 (Pa.1991).  Recidivists are \r\n  persons who continue to commit criminal, antisocial behavior after incarceration \r\n  for an earlier offense.  Recidivist statutes aim at punishing those who have \r\n  shown they are incorrigible offenders.  Shannon Thorne, One Strike and You're \r\n  Out: Double Counting and Dual Use Undermines the Purpose of California's Three-Strikes \r\n  Law, 34 U.S.F.L.Rev. 99 (1999).  The purpose of requiring separate offenses \r\n  is to ensure that those offenders being sentenced under the harsh provisions \r\n  of a recidivist sentencing statute have not been classified as habitual offenders \r\n  because of multiple convictions arising from a single criminal enterprise; it \r\n  provides the state with some certainty that the offender has participated in \r\n  multiple criminal trials and, despite these opportunities to understand the \r\n  gravity of his behavior and abide by the law, has continued to engage in criminal \r\n  conduct.  Daniel Rogers, People v. Furman and Three Strikes: Have the Traditional \r\n  Goals of Recidivist Sentencing Been Sacrificed at The Altar of Public Passion?, \r\n  20 Thomas Jefferson L.Rev. 139, 156 (Spring 1998).\r\n\r\n353 S.C. at 446, 579 S.E.2d at \r\n  291.  \r\nWe find the recidivist \r\n  statute is aimed at career criminals, those who have been previously sentenced \r\n  and then commit another crime, not at those whose recidivist status is premised \r\n  solely upon acts which occur at times so closely connected in point of time \r\n  that they may be considered as one offense.  Accordingly, we hold Â§ 17-25-45 \r\n  and Â§ 17-25-50 must be construed together in determining whether crimes committed \r\n  at points close in time qualify for a recidivist sentence.  We overrule State \r\n  v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003), and affirm the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  consideration of 17-25-50 in refusing to impose a sentence of LWOP under the \r\n  facts of this case. [12] \r\nCONCLUSION\r\nWe affirm the \r\n  trial courtâ€™s ruling that Gordon was not placed in double jeopardy as a result \r\n  of his 2001 prosecution.  We also affirm the trial courtâ€™s consideration of \r\n  Â§ 17-25-50 in refusing to impose a sentence of LWOP.  The judgment below is  \r\n\r\n AFFIRMED.\r\nTOAL,\r\nC.J., MOORE, \r\n  J., and Acting Justice Marc H. Westbrook, concur.  BURNETT, J., concurring in \r\n  part and dissenting in part in a separate opinion.\r\n JUSTICE BURNETT (concurring in part; dissenting in part):  \r\n  I agree Gordon has suffered no double jeopardy violation.  However, I disagree \r\n  with the majorityâ€™s conclusion that South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45 (2003) \r\n  must be read in conjunction with South Carolina Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-50 (2003).  \r\n\r\nAs fully explained by this Court a few months ago, the \r\n  language of Â§ 17-25-45, specifically the introductory phrase â€œ[n]otwithstanding \r\n  any other provision of law,â€ demonstrates the General Assembly unequivocally \r\n  intended the statute to be read independently of other provisions, including \r\n  Â§ 17-25-50.  State v. Benjamin, 353 S.C. 441, 579 S.E.2d 289 (2003).  \r\n  The Court considered and rejected the very same arguments presented by Gordon \r\n  today.  \r\nFurther, the principle of stare decisis compels the majority \r\n  follow State v. Benjamin, id.  â€œStare decisis exists to â€˜insure \r\n  a quality of justice which results from certainty and stabilityâ€™.â€  State \r\n  v. One Coin-Operated Video Game Mach., 321 S.C. 176, 181, 467 S.E.2d 443, \r\n  446 (1996) (internal citations omitted).  Prosecutors, those charged with crimes, \r\n  and the general public alike benefit from the predictability associated with \r\n  the Courtâ€™s decisions.  Ultimately, no one benefits when the Court issues opinions \r\n  which diverge from month to month.  Accordingly, even when a judge dislikes \r\n  the result, stare decisis behoves him to follow precedent.  See State \r\n  v. Hudgins, 319 S.C. 233, 460 S.E.2d 388 (1995) (wherein Chief Justice Finney \r\n  concurred with majorityâ€™s holding with which he did not agree as he recognized \r\n  stare decisis bound him to the result).  Moreover, adhering to stare decisis \r\n  where we have previously interpreted a statute does not result in rigid application \r\n  of the law as the General Assembly may correct any misinterpretation on our \r\n  part.  State v. One Coin-Operated Video Game Mach., supra.  \r\nIn my opinion, State v. Benjamin, supra, \r\n  is dispositive.  I would affirm Gordonâ€™s LWOP sentence.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1]   Section 44-53-375(C) provides, in part: \r\n  \r\n  A person who knowingly sells, manufactures, delivers, \r\n    purchases, or brings into this State, or who provides financial assistance \r\n    or otherwise aids, abets, attempts, or conspires to sell, manufacture, deliver, \r\n    purchase, or bring into this State, or who is knowingly in actual or constructive \r\n    possession or who knowingly attempts to become in actual or constructive possession \r\n    of ten grams or more of ice, crank, or crack cocaine, . . . is guilty of a \r\n    felony which is known as &quot;trafficking in ice, crank, or crack cocaine. \r\n    . .â€  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]   This indictment was substantially the same as \r\n    count seven of the 1997 indictment charging Gordon with trafficking; however, \r\n    at the 1997 trial, count seven was nol prossed with the right to restore.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]   Under the Two-Strikes law, S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 17-25-45(B), \r\n    upon a conviction for a â€œserious offense,â€ a person must be sentenced to LWOP \r\n    if he/she has two or more convictions for a â€œseriousâ€ or â€œmost seriousâ€ offense \r\n    or a combination thereof.  Here, Gordon had one prior â€œmost seriousâ€ offense \r\n    of armed robbery, and his 1997 trafficking in crack conviction is a â€œserious \r\n    offense.â€  As the current offense is also a â€œseriousâ€ offense, Gordon is subject \r\n    to LWOP unless the current crime occurred so closely in point of time with \r\n    the events leading to his 1997 conviction that the trial court properly treated \r\n    it as one offense under Â§ 17-25-50.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]   Section 17-25-50 requires the sentencing court \r\n    to â€œtreat as one offense any number of offenses which have been committed \r\n    at times so closely connected in point of time that they may be considered \r\n    as one offense.â€  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [5]    S.C. CONST. art. I, Â§ 12;  U.S. CONST. Amend \r\n    V.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [6]    A conspiracy is a combination or agreement between \r\n    two or more persons for the purpose of accomplishing a criminal or unlawful \r\n    object, or of achieving by criminal or unlawful means an object that is neither \r\n    criminal nor unlawful.  State v. Ameker, 73 S.C. 330, 53 S.E. 484 (1906).  \r\n    The gravamen of the offense of conspiracy is the agreement or combination.  \r\n    State v. Dasher, supra.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [7]   Gordonâ€™s reliance on State v. Amerson, 311 S.C. 316, 428 \r\n    S.E.2d 871 (1993), is misplaced.  Amerson involved a case in which \r\n    the defendant was indicted for conspiracy to traffic marijuana.  Similarly, \r\n    State v. Dasher, 278 S.C. 454, 298 S.E.2d 215 (1982) was also a conspiracy \r\n    case.   Here, both the 1997 and 2000 indictments were for the substantive \r\n    offense of trafficking rather than conspiracy to traffic.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [8]   See footnote 3.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [9]   See footnote 4.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [10]   The majority opinion in Benjamin was \r\n    joined by Justice Pleicones, Justice Burnett, and Judge Cottingham.  Justice \r\n    Waller and Justice Moore dissented.   \r\n\r\n \r\n   [11]   The only exception would be if a defendant \r\n    is tried simultaneously for numerous offenses.  If, however, the state elects \r\n    separate trials to prosecute a defendant for multiple crimes, such that the \r\n    he or she has a qualifying â€œprior conviction,â€ then the trial court is prohibited \r\n    from consideration of whether the offenses were committed at points so close \r\n    in time as to be one offense.  We find this an absurd result, clearly not \r\n    intended by the legislature.\r\n\r\n \r\n   [12]    We note this does not mean Gordon is not subject \r\n    to separate sentences for these offenses, merely that he is not subject to \r\n    a recidivist LWOP sentence as a result of his second trafficking conviction.  \r\n    For the benefit of bench and bar, we note that our decision in this matter \r\n    is to be given retroactive application.  Cf. Pinckney v. Warren, \r\n    344 S.C. 382, 544 S.E.2d 620 (2001)(retroactivity may be extended when justice \r\n    requires and innocent persons will not be adversely affected).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25738","title":"Andrade v.

Merrifield, all of Kiker &amp; Douds, \r\n  PA, of Beaufort, for respondent.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nJUSTICE MOORE:  We granted certiorari to determine whether the Court \r\n  of Appeals erred by reversing the trial courtâ€™s decision granting South Carolina \r\n  Electric &amp; Gas (SCE&amp;G) a directed verdict on respondentâ€™s negligence \r\n  claim.  Andrade v. Johnson, 345 S.C. 216, 546 S.E.2d 665 (Ct. App. 2001).  \r\n  We reverse.\r\nFACTS\r\nRespondent contacted Sea Island Air for an estimate on replacing her heating, \r\n  ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system in her townhouse.  She called \r\n  Sea Island because of the large SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer insignia in its phone \r\n  book advertisement. \r\nSea Islandâ€™s president, Jimmy Johnson, visited respondent and emphasized \r\n  his SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer designation.  He also elaborated on the virtues \r\n  of the Quality Dealer program and SCE&amp;Gâ€™s financing program that was available \r\n  only to purchasers who used a Quality Dealer for installing an HVAC system.\r\nFollowing the meeting, respondent obtained a brochure that explained \r\n  the Great Appliance Trade-Up Program.  The brochure explained that to qualify \r\n  for a special rebate or credit toward the monthly electric bill, a customer \r\n  must be an SCE&amp;G electric customer on certain rates and have a high-efficiency \r\n  unit installed by an SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer.  The brochure further explained \r\n  that SCE&amp;G-certified Quality Dealers are the only contractors whose installation \r\n  work qualifies for rebates in their Great Appliance Trade-Up Program, as well \r\n  as for special energy rates.  Respondent testified the brochure confirmed Johnsonâ€™s \r\n  statements to her.\r\nRespondent agreed to have two new HVAC systems installed in her home.  \r\n  After several delays in the installation, a crew finally completed the work.  \r\n  Respondent immediately observed difficulties with the operation of the system \r\n  and informed Johnson of the deficiencies.  However, she signed the financing \r\n  forms authorizing SCE&amp;G to pay Sea Island for the work.  The financing agreement \r\n  included the statement:  â€œCustomer further acknowledges that SCE&amp;G has no \r\n  warranty liability in connection with the Property or its installation.â€\r\nBecause the HVAC system was not working properly, respondent was forced to \r\n  buy electric heaters to warm her house.  At respondentâ€™s request, the Beaufort \r\n  codes department inspected the installation and listed approximately fifteen \r\n  code violations committed by Sea Island. [1]&nbsp; Prior to completing a full inspection of the \r\n  HVAC systems, respondent had to remove the floor of her third floor room to \r\n  allow a proper inspection.\r\nRespondent also arranged to have Jeff Kleckley, the head of the local \r\n  SCE&amp;G Quality Dealer program, inspect the installation, even though SCE&amp;G \r\n  indicated it normally did not do inspections.  SCE&amp;G suggested to respondent \r\n  that she pay Sea Island $500 to bypass the third floor so that she could get \r\n  heat into the second floor bedrooms.  This was suggested as a temporary fix \r\n  until respondent installed insulation in the third floor and replaced the floor \r\n  of the third floor room.  Respondent did not take this advice because she received \r\n  the Codes inspection report mentioned previously and did not want to put more \r\n  money into the faulty system. [2] \r\nRespondent met with the general manager of SCE&amp;Gâ€™s Beaufort office \r\n  and asked him to intervene with Johnson and Sea Island to remedy the problems.  \r\n  The general manager stated, although it was not something he normally dealt \r\n  with, he would speak with Sea Island to see if Sea Island could get her system \r\n  in working order.  Finally, respondent was forced to hire another contractor \r\n  to remove and replace the systems installed by Sea Island.\r\nPrior to trial on her claims, respondent settled with Johnson and executed \r\n  a covenant not to sue in his favor.  The covenant expressly reserved any and \r\n  all claims respondent had against SCE&amp;G. \r\nThe trial court granted summary judgment to SCE&amp;G on respondentâ€™s \r\n  Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act (UTPA) claim and on her claims based \r\n  on SCE&amp;Gâ€™s vicarious liability.  The court directed a verdict in SCE&amp;Gâ€™s \r\n  favor on respondentâ€™s remaining causes of action alleging negligence and misrepresentation.\r\nThe Court of Appeals affirmed in part and reversed in part.  The \r\n  court affirmed the trial courtâ€™s decision granting summary judgment to SCE&amp;G \r\n  on all claims based upon SCE&amp;Gâ€™s vicarious liability on the basis the covenant \r\n  not to sue released both Johnson and SCE&amp;G.  The court reversed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision granting SCE&amp;Gâ€™s summary judgment motion on the basis SCE&amp;G \r\n  was exempt from the UTPA.  Finally, the Court of Appeals reversed the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision granting SCE&amp;G a directed verdict on respondentâ€™s negligence \r\n  claim.  On this issue, the court found the evidence raised an inference that \r\n  SCE&amp;G owed a duty of care to respondent to ensure the proper installation \r\n  of the HVAC systems.  The court found the Quality Dealer Agreement provided \r\n  evidence of a contractual duty undertaken by SCE&amp;G to oversee the proper \r\n  installation of HVAC systems and to address customer complaints regarding improper \r\n  installation.  While all of the Court of Appealsâ€™ findings were appealed, we \r\n  granted certiorari solely on the issue concerning respondentâ€™s negligence claim.\r\nISSUE\r\n\r\nDid the Court of Appeals err by reversing the trial courtâ€™s \r\n  decision granting SCE&amp;Gâ€™s directed verdict motion on respondentâ€™s negligence \r\n  claim?\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION\r\nRespondent alleged SCE&amp;G was negligent for failing to properly supervise \r\n  its Quality Dealer program, failing to properly train, qualify, and investigate \r\n  its quality dealers, failing to act reasonably in responding to customer complaints, \r\n  and failing to exercise reasonable care in the certification of its quality \r\n  dealers.  Respondent argues SCE&amp;Gâ€™s implementation, operation, and conduct \r\n  of its Quality Dealer program gave rise to a duty of care.\r\nSea Island was an SCE&amp;G certified quality dealer.  The guidelines of the \r\n  Quality Dealer Program state the program is\r\n\r\ndesigned to encourage proper installation of high efficiency heating and cooling \r\n  systems.  The program incorporates high standards of system design, installation, \r\n  and maintenance.  . . . Contractors who elect to participate and install new \r\n  systems . . . must meet the Quality Dealer Program standards.\r\n\r\nThe Quality Dealer Program Agreement provided that Sea Island must \r\n  adhere to all dealer requirements, installation requirements, mediation procedures \r\n  in responding to customer complaints, and to SCE&amp;Gâ€™s inspection policy.  \r\n  SCE&amp;G, in turn, agreed to assist in developing prospective customers, provide \r\n  promotional materials, provide reasonable assistance and opportunities for training, \r\n  and promote Quality HVAC installations to their customers. \r\nTo become a Quality Dealer, the dealer must agree to establish certain \r\n  customer service practices.  Further, the dealer must annually participate in \r\n  a SCE&amp;G orientation covering the program guidelines and basic design and \r\n  installation requirements.  Under the Agreement, the dealer was required to \r\n  meet and adhere to a detailed list of installation requirements.  The installation \r\n  requirements stated that the dealer must â€œselect and install systems and accessory \r\n  equipment in accordance with all local, state and national codes.â€\r\nThe Agreement also outlines mediation procedures for when SCE&amp;G \r\n  receives a complaint from a customer dissatisfied with an installation by a \r\n  Quality Dealer.  The mediation procedures state that if the complaint is not \r\n  resolved when the customer contacts the dealer, the SCE&amp;G representative \r\n  will notify the appropriate distributor and meet with the dealer and customer \r\n  to inspect the system and investigate the complaint.  The mediation procedures \r\n  further provide:\r\n\r\nThe [SCE&amp;G] representative will inspect the system for program compliance \r\n  and capacity measurements.  The [SCE&amp;G] representative will work with the \r\n  dealer to find a solution to the complaint.  If the problem can not, or will \r\n  not, be resolved by the dealer, the manufacturerâ€™s and/or distributorâ€™s technical \r\n  representative will be contacted to inspect the system.\r\n\r\nIf a dealer refuses to correct a justifiable customer complaint in a timely \r\n  manner, the dealer will be suspended from the program for a minimum of one year.\r\nUnder the Agreement, SCE&amp;G reserved the right to inspect or verify \r\n  all installations for which a dealer or customer receives a rebate or special \r\n  rate consideration.  Inspections could be random or at a customerâ€™s request.  \r\n  The Agreement notes these inspections are used â€œto determine compliance with \r\n  [their programs.]â€\r\nSCE&amp;G argues the Court of Appeals erred by reversing the trial \r\n  courtâ€™s decision granting their directed verdict motion on respondentâ€™s claim \r\n  of negligence.\r\nWhen reviewing the denial of a motion for directed verdict, we must \r\n  view the evidence and all reasonable inferences in the light most favorable \r\n  to the non-moving party.  Wintersteen v. Food Lion, Inc., 344 S.C. 32, \r\n  542 S.E.2d 728 (2001).  If the evidence as a whole is susceptible of only one \r\n  reasonable inference, no jury issue is created and a directed verdict motion \r\n  is properly granted.  Id.\r\nIn a negligence action, a plaintiff must show the (1) defendant owes \r\n  a duty of care to the plaintiff, (2) defendant breached the duty by a negligent \r\n  act or omission, (3) defendantâ€™s breach was the actual and proximate cause of \r\n  the plaintiffâ€™s injury, and (4) plaintiff suffered an injury or damages.  Steinke \r\n  v. South Carolina Depâ€™t of Labor, Licensing and Reg., 336 S.C. 373, 520 \r\n  S.E.2d 142 (1999). \r\n A tort-feasor may be subjected to tort liability for injury to a \r\n  third party arising out of the tort-feasorâ€™s contractual relationship with another, \r\n  despite the absence of privity between the tort-feasor and the third party.  \r\n  Barker v. Sauls, 289 S.C. 121, 345 S.E.2d 244 (1986) (citation omitted).  \r\n  The tort-feasorâ€™s liability exists independently of contract, and rests upon \r\n  the tort-feasorâ€™s duty to exercise due care.  Id.\r\nThe key inquiry is what duty, if any, is owed by the tort-feasor \r\n  to the third party.  Id.  It is essential to liability for negligence \r\n  that the parties have some relationship recognized by law to support the duty \r\n  owed by the tort-feasor.  Id.  This duty may be derived from the tort-feasorâ€™s \r\n  contractual relationship with another.  Id.\r\nSCE&amp;G did not owe a duty to respondent to ensure that its Quality \r\n  Dealer properly installed her HVAC system.  From the language of the Agreement, \r\n  it is clear SCE&amp;G did not owe such a duty to respondent, an SCE&amp;G customer.\r\nWhile an SCE&amp;G customer receives some benefit from the agreement \r\n  through the ability to participate in the Great Appliance Trade-Up Program and \r\n  receive special electric rates, financing for the installation of a Quality \r\n  HVAC system, and ensuring the HVAC system that is installed meets the Quality \r\n  Dealer Program requirements, this does not thereby mean SCE&amp;G has a duty \r\n  to ensure a customer receives good service from one of its quality dealers.  \r\n  Further, the language in the SCE&amp;G financing agreement signed by respondent \r\n  evidences SCE&amp;G did not have a duty to ensure the proper installation of \r\n  the HVAC system.  The agreement states:  â€œCustomer further acknowledges that \r\n  SCE&amp;G has no warranty liability in connection with the Property or its installation.â€ \r\n\r\nTherefore, we conclude the Court of Appeals erroneously reversed \r\n  the trial courtâ€™s decision directing a verdict in SCE&amp;Gâ€™s favor because \r\n  SCE&amp;G did not owe a duty to respondent to ensure Sea Island Air performed \r\n  satisfactory work when installing respondentâ€™s HVAC system.\r\nREVERSED.\r\nTOAL, C.J., WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n \r\n   \r\n    [1] Twenty-six other codes violations were discovered during the inspection.  \r\n    Most of these violations concerned respondentâ€™s attempt to have her attic \r\n    turned into a habitable third floor room.  Respondent had not obtained a permit \r\n    for any of the third floor work and this work was partially completed when \r\n    Sea Island arrived to install the HVAC systems.\r\n\r\n \r\n  [2] Subsequently, after receiving a letter from respondent, Kleckley, \r\n    on behalf of SCE&amp;G, sent her a letter reiterating that respondent needed \r\n    to repair the third floor subfloor that had been removed, that adequate insulation \r\n    should be installed in the third floor, and that the third floor should be \r\n    properly ventilated.  He further wrote that SCE&amp;G could not guarantee \r\n    comfort since there were a number of factors that impacted overall comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"25739","title":"Hedgepath v.

Hall, II, of Calhoun Falls, Pro Se.\r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\nPER CURIAM:   In this judicial disciplinary matter, respondent and the \r\n  Office of Disciplinary Counsel have entered into an Agreement for Discipline \r\n  by Consent pursuant to Rule 21, RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.  In the agreement, respondent \r\n  admits misconduct and consents to the issuance of an admonition or a public \r\n  reprimand or the imposition of a definite suspension for a period to be determined \r\n  by this Court.  We accept the agreement and impose a one year suspension.  The \r\n  facts as set forth in the agreement are as follows.\r\nFacts\r\nRespondent was ticketed for failing to use turn signals \r\n  during lane changes in violation of S.C. Code Ann. Â§ 56-5-2150.  At the trial \r\n  on the charges, respondent made untruthful statements regarding statements made \r\n  to him by the arresting officer.  Respondent attempted to exclude audio and \r\n  video recordings of the traffic stop that showed the officer did not make the \r\n  statements attributed to him by respondent.  Finally, respondent was held in \r\n  contempt for his gestures and behavior during the prosecution's closing argument \r\n  after being admonished earlier for making signs of agreement or disagreement \r\n  with questions asked or statements made during the proceeding.\r\nLaw\r\nRespondent admits that he has violated the following provisions \r\n  of the Code of Judicial Conduct, Rule 501, SCACR:  Canon 1 (a judge shall uphold \r\n  the integrity and independence of the judiciary) and Canon 2(A)(a judge shall \r\n  respect and comply with the law and shall act at all times in a manner that \r\n  promotes public confidence in the integrity and impartiality of the judiciary).  \r\n  Respondent also admits that these allegations constitute grounds for discipline \r\n  pursuant to Rules 7(a)(1) and (7), RJDE, Rule 502, SCACR.\r\nConclusion\r\nWe find respondent's misconduct warrants a suspension from \r\n  judicial duties.  We therefore accept the Agreement for Discipline by Consent \r\n  and impose a one year suspension.\r\n DEFINITE SUSPENSION.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n    s/Jean H.

Richardson, Jr., and Senior Assistant Attorney General James G. Bogle, \r\n  Jr., both of Columbia, for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel.\r\nJack T. Flom, of Jacksonville, Florida, pro se.  \r\n      \r\n    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n PER CURIAM:  In this attorney disciplinary matter, \r\n  the Commission on Lawyer Conduct concluded respondent committed misconduct and \r\n  recommended disbarment.  We agree and disbar respondent.  \r\nInitial Formal Charges \r\n  [1] \r\nMatter I  \r\nAfter transmission \r\n  repairs were performed by a mechanic on their Ford truck, Mr. and Mrs. Doe continued \r\n  to have transmission difficulties and retained respondent.  On June 28, 1994, \r\n  respondent sent a letter to the mechanic explaining the situation and demanding \r\n  relief.  He then submitted a bill for this letter to UAW-Ford Legal Services.  \r\n  By letter dated July 15, 1994, the mechanic replied to respondent and denied \r\n  liability.\r\nAlthough respondent drafted \r\n  a Summons and Complaint, he did not serve the documents.  The statute of limitations \r\n  against the mechanic and other potential defendants expired.  Respondent did \r\n  not advise the Does about the expiration of the statute of limitations.  \r\n  After receipt of the Doesâ€™ \r\n  complaint, the Commission on Lawyer Conduct sent respondent a March 23, 1999, \r\n  letter requesting a response within fifteen days.  Respondent did not respond.  \r\n  The Commission again wrote respondent on May 4, 1999, requesting a response \r\n  and advising that failure to respond was grounds for discipline.  Respondent \r\n  replied on May 18.\r\nOn July 9, 1999, a staff \r\n  attorney at the Office of Disciplinary Counsel wrote respondent requesting additional \r\n  information and a response within fifteen days.  Respondent did not reply.\r\nBy letter dated August 25, \r\n  1999, Deputy Disciplinary Counsel again requested the information sought by \r\n  the staff attorney and reminded respondent that failure to respond was grounds \r\n  for discipline.  Respondent did not reply. \r\n  [2]   \r\nA Notice of Full Investigation was sent to respondent in December.  Respondent \r\n  did not reply.   \r\nMatter II \r\nClient A retained \r\n  respondent in March 1998 after she was served with a Summons and Complaint seeking \r\n  a reduction in child support.  At the same time, Client Aâ€™s ex-husband reduced \r\n  his child support payment and refused to provide medical insurance for the partiesâ€™ \r\n  son as previously ordered by the family court.  The retainer agreement between \r\n  Client A and respondent states a rate of $125/hour for out-of-court time and \r\n  $150/hour for in-court time.  \r\nAlthough Client \r\n  A contacted respondent weekly, months passed without any action by respondent.  \r\n  Respondent told Client A he was waiting for a court date to be scheduled by \r\n  her ex-husbandâ€™s attorney.  During this time, Client A received the reduced \r\n  child support payments and her ex-husband made no payments towards their sonâ€™s \r\n  medical bills.  \r\nSeveral letters from the ex-husbandâ€™s attorney indicate \r\n  a willingness to discuss settlement.  Although Client A made it clear she could \r\n  not accept a lower child support payment, respondent did not file an Answer \r\n  or take other action.\r\nThe ex-husband hired a new attorney in December 1998. The \r\n  attorney filed a new action against Client A.  A court date was set for April \r\n  19, 1999.  After she took time off from work and went to the courthouse to appear \r\n  at the hearing, Client A discovered the hearing had been postponed by agreement \r\n  of the attorneys but she had not been notified.\r\nAfter a hearing in June 1999, the family court ordered \r\n  full reimbursement of the back-due child support and reinstated the original \r\n  support requirement.  The family court held the insurance issue and respondentâ€™s \r\n  request for attorneyâ€™s fees in abeyance because the ex-husband had filed for \r\n  bankruptcy shortly before the hearing.  Respondent had submitted an affidavit \r\n  for attorneyâ€™s fees asserting his charge was based on rates of $150/hour for \r\n  out-of-court work and $175/hour for in-court work. \r\nIn late June 1999, respondent received a check from Client \r\n  Aâ€™s ex-husband which represented the back-due child support.  Respondent withheld \r\n  $1735 from the check as his attorneyâ€™s fees.  Again, respondent determined this \r\n  fee based on $150/hour out-of-court work and $175/hour for in-court work although \r\n  the retainer agreement specified a lesser hourly rate.   \r\nThe Commission advised respondent of Client Aâ€™s October \r\n  1999 complaint and requested a response.  Respondent did not reply.          \r\n            \r\nBy letter dated November 22, 1999, the Commission again \r\n  wrote respondent requesting a response and advising him that failure to cooperate \r\n  was grounds for discipline.  The Commissionâ€™s Notice of Full Investigation was \r\n  sent to respondent by certified mail in February but returned unclaimed\r\nby the postal service.  \r\nMatter III \r\nIn December \r\n  1999, Client B retained respondent to file a post-conviction relief (PCR) action \r\n  on behalf of her husband who was incarcerated in Florida. Client B signed a \r\n  retainer agreement, gave respondent $1500, and agreed to pay $200 per month \r\n  towards the $5,000 retainer fee.   \r\nBetween December \r\n  1999 and April 2000, Client B contacted respondent on numerous occasions and \r\n  inquired whether the PCR action had been filed.  Although respondent told Client \r\n  B the petition had been filed and copies had been mailed, neither Client B nor \r\n  her husband received a copy of the petition.  \r\nClient B contacted \r\n  the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office and the Horry County Clerk of Court and determined \r\n  no action had been filed.  Client B again contacted respondent; he again asserted \r\n  he had filed the action.  Client B told respondent that she intended to take \r\n  legal action against him unless he provided proof by the next day, April 7, \r\n  2000, that the action had in fact been filed.  \r\nAt 4:00 p.m. \r\n  on April 7, Client B telephoned respondent and told him she had not received \r\n  any proof of the filing.  Although respondent asked if Client B would wait until \r\n  Monday, she refused.  Shortly thereafter, respondent faxed Client B a copy of \r\n  a document captioned with the name of Client Bâ€™s husband and civil action number \r\n  2000-CP-26-999.  The application bore respondentâ€™s signature, was dated March \r\n  3, 2000, and was stamped as filed with the Horry County Clerkâ€™s Office on March \r\n  8, 2000.    \r\nRespondent \r\n  gave Client B false information.  Civil Action No. 2000-CP-26-999 was actually \r\n  a lawsuit which had been filed against respondent personally.  Respondent had \r\n  removed the filing stamp from the previously-filed suit and placed it on the \r\n  PCR action before faxing it to Client B.  \r\nAlthough the \r\n  Commission sent respondent a copy of Client Bâ€™s complaint and asked for a response, \r\n  respondent did not reply.  In June 2000, the Commission again wrote respondent \r\n  requesting a response and advising him that failure to cooperate was grounds \r\n  for discipline.  Respondent did not reply.  In August 2000, the Commission sent \r\n  respondent a Notice of Full Investigation requiring a response in thirty days.  \r\n  After the Attorney Generalâ€™s Office subpoenaed respondentâ€™s client file, respondent \r\n  replied to  Client Bâ€™s complaint.  \r\nSecond Formal \r\n  Charges [3] \r\nMatter \r\n  IV  \r\nClient C retained \r\n  respondent to represent him in two different matters.  Respondent failed to \r\n  take any action regarding either matter.  \r\nClient C retained \r\n  respondent in a third matter.  Although he wrote the defendant a demand letter, \r\n  respondent failed to take any further action.  \r\nRespondent \r\n  received the Notice of Full Investigation from the Commission.  He did not file \r\n  a response.  \r\nMatter \r\n  V  \r\nClient D retained \r\n  respondent to file a lawsuit concerning causes of action which had occurred \r\n  in 1995.  After respondent filed suit in 1997, the defendant filed an answer \r\n  and interrogatories.  After not receiving interrogatory responses for three \r\n  months, defense counsel wrote respondent seeking responses.  Six months later, \r\n  defense counsel filed a motion to compel discovery.  After the motion was placed \r\n  on the docket, respondent and defense counsel reached an agreement resolving \r\n  the motion.  In August 2000, Client Dâ€™s case was voluntarily dismissed from \r\n  the docket without participation of the defendant and without notice to Client \r\n  D.  \r\nShortly thereafter, \r\n  the parties agreed to restore the matter to the docket, but respondent failed \r\n  to prepare the consent order.  Defense counsel then wrote respondent in August \r\n  and again in November 2000 requesting a consent order to restore the case; he \r\n  never received an order.  The statute of limitations expired.  \r\nClient D made \r\n  repeated telephone calls to respondent concerning the status of the case and \r\n  was told there would be a delay before the hearing.  When she checked the courthouse \r\n  records, she learned the case had been dismissed.  When Client D visited respondentâ€™s \r\n  office and informed him of the dismissal, respondent advised the statute of \r\n  limitations would not apply to the refiling of her case.  \r\nAfter respondent \r\n  closed his office, Client D had difficulty locating him.  When she did locate \r\n  him, respondent reassured her that her case would go to court.  \r\nClient D filed \r\n  a complaint with the Commission.  She was unable to obtain her file from respondent.\r\nA Notice of \r\n  Full Investigation was sent by certified mail to respondent.  The document was \r\n  returned unclaimed after three attempts at service. \r\nTHIRD FORMAL \r\n  CHARGES\r\nMatter VI \r\nRespondent \r\n  prepared a will for Client Eâ€™s husband in 1983.  Respondent kept the original \r\n  will.  After her husband passed away in 2001, Client E contacted respondent \r\n  to obtain the original will.  Respondent could not locate the will.\r\nClient E met \r\n  respondent in Georgetown who took her to a storage warehouse which contained \r\n  his locked safe.  After he was unable to unlock the safe, respondent gave the \r\n  safe to Client E.  Client E took the safe to a locksmith in Myrtle Beach where \r\n  it was opened.  The safe contained 50 or more sealed envelopes, most labeled \r\n  â€œLast Will and Testamentâ€ with a clientâ€™s name.  Client Eâ€™s husbandâ€™s will was \r\n  not among the documents.  Ultimately, the safe and documents were returned to \r\n  respondent.\r\n  \r\nA Notice of \r\n  Full Investigation requiring a thirty day response was served upon respondent.  \r\n  He did not reply. [4]   \r\nFourth \r\n  Formal Charges\r\nMatter \r\n  VII  \r\nClient F retained \r\n  respondent to obtain a divorce.  She paid him a fee of approximately $1,000.  \r\n  Although he filed a Summons and Complaint seeking alimony, child support, and \r\n  other relief, he failed to seek all this relief at the final hearing.  Respondent \r\n  failed to prepare and file the divorce decree.\r\nClient F retained \r\n  new counsel.  The new attorney was unable to locate respondentâ€™s file and was \r\n  required to listen to the taped recording of the family court hearing in order \r\n  to prepare the final decree.  \r\nBy letter \r\n  dated August 13, 2001, the Office of Disciplinary Counsel wrote respondent about \r\n  this matter, requesting a response in fifteen days.  Respondent did not reply.  \r\n  Disciplinary Counsel sent respondent a second letter dated September 1, 2001.  \r\n  Respondent did not reply. \r\nOn January 31, 2002, \r\n  the Notice of Full Investigation was mailed to respondent.  Although this notice \r\n  required a response within thirty days, respondent did not reply.  \r\nMatter \r\n  VIII \r\nA fee dispute \r\n  complaint was filed by a client against respondent.  An agreement was reached \r\n  wherein respondent would refund $450 to client.  \r\nWhen respondent failed to refund \r\n  the money within the stated deadline, the Fee Dispute Board notified the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.   Disciplinary Counsel notified respondent of the complaint \r\n  and requested a response within fifteen days.  Respondent did not reply.  Respondent \r\n  also failed to respond to the Notice of Full Investigation.  \r\nMatter \r\n  IX  \r\nIn 1999, Client \r\n  G hired respondent to represent him in a divorce and child custody case.  Respondent \r\n  failed to fully research his clientâ€™s case, failed to gather pertinent files \r\n  and records, and neglected the matter such that the client relinquished his \r\n  parental rights.  Respondent failed to return Client Gâ€™s telephone calls, failed \r\n  to take necessary action to enforce Client Gâ€™s right to visitation, and failed \r\n  to notify his client that his office was being closed and his telephone number \r\n  changed.  \r\nAfter \r\n  considering the testimony and exhibits from the hearing, the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct concluded respondent breached the Rules of  Professional Conduct (Rule \r\n  407, SCACR), specifically Rule 1.15 (failure to safeguard clientâ€™s property), \r\n  Rule 1.3 (failure to act with reasonable diligence and promptness in representing \r\n  a client), Rule 1.4 (failure to keep a client reasonably informed about the \r\n  status of a matter and comply promptly for requests for information; failure \r\n  to explain matter to client to extent reasonably necessary to permit client \r\n  to make informed decisions), Rule 1.1 (failure to represent a client competently), \r\n  Rule 1.2 (failure to consult with a client as to objectives of representation \r\n  and means by which they are to be achieved), Rule 1.5 (charged an unreasonable \r\n  fee), Rule 1.16 (failure to provide reasonable notice of termination of representation), \r\n  Rule 8.1(a) (knowingly make a false statement of material fact in connection \r\n  with a disciplinary matter), Rule 8.1(b) (failure to respond to a lawful demand \r\n  for information from a disciplinary authority), Rule 8.4(a) (violated the Rules \r\n  of Professional Conduct), and Rule 8.4(e) (engaged in conduct that is prejudicial \r\n  to the administration of justice).  In addition, the Commission concluded respondent \r\n  breached the Rules for Lawyer Disciplinary Enforcement (Rule 413, SCACR), specifically \r\n  Rule 7(a)(1) (violating the Rules of Professional Conduct), Rule 7(a)(3) (failure \r\n  to respond to request for appearance before disciplinary authority), Rule 7(a)(5) \r\n  (engaged in conduct tending to pollute the administration of justice or to bring \r\n  the courts or legal profession into disrepute and engaged in conduct demonstrating \r\n  unfitness to practice law), and Rule 7(a)(6) (violate oath of office).  \r\nDISCUSSION\r\nAlthough this \r\n  Court is not bound by the Commissionâ€™s findings, its findings are entitled to \r\n  great weight, particularly when the inferences to be drawn from the testimony \r\n  depend on the credibility of witnesses.  Matter of Moore, 329 S.C. 294, \r\n  494 S.E.2d 804 (1997); Matter of Yarborough, 327 S.C. 161, 488 S.E.2d \r\n  871 (1997).  Nonetheless, the Court may make its own findings of fact and conclusions \r\n  of law.  Id.  A disciplinary violation must be proven by clear and convincing \r\n  evidence.  Id.\r\nWe conclude \r\n  the record establishes by clear and convincing evidence that respondent engaged \r\n  in numerous acts of misconduct.  On several occasions, respondent failed to \r\n  handle client matters diligently and competently, failed to adequately communicate \r\n  with clients, and failed to respond to requests for information from the Office \r\n  of Disciplinary Counsel.   Respondent failed to appear at the hearing before \r\n  the Subpanel.  In addition, he lied to a client about the filing of a legal \r\n  document and prepared a fictitious document to bolster his misrepresentation.  \r\n  Respondent misplaced a clientâ€™s original will and then gave a third party unfettered \r\n  access to other clientsâ€™ confidential documents.  Finally, respondent charged \r\n  a client a fee which was in excess of the hourly rate agreed upon in the written \r\n  retainer.  \r\nWe find that \r\n  respondentâ€™s misconduct warrants disbarment.  Within fifteen days of the date \r\n  of this opinion, respondent shall file an affidavit with the Clerk of Court \r\n  showing that he has complied with Rule 30 of Rule 413, SCACR, and shall also \r\n  surrender his Certificate of Admission to the Practice of Law to the Clerk of \r\n  Court.  In addition, respondent is ordered to pay the costs of the disciplinary \r\n  proceeding ($563.60).  This amount shall be remitted to the Commission on Lawyer \r\n  Conduct in accordance with Rule 413, SCACR.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nDISBARRED.\r\n TOAL,\r\nC.J., \r\n  MOORE, WALLER, BURNETT and PLEICONES, JJ., concur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n   [1]  \r\n    Although he did file a response to the Initial Formal Charges, because respondent \r\n    did not appear at the hearing, he is deemed to have admitted the factual allegations \r\n    in the complaint and to have conceded to the merits of any recommendation \r\n    at the hearing.  Rule 24(b), Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [2]  \r\n    In his Response to Formal Charges, respondent asserted he telephoned Deputy \r\n    Disciplinary Counsel and told her he would be responding.  However, before \r\n    he responded, he received the complaint in a second matter.  At the hearing, \r\n    a witness for the Office of Disciplinary Counsel testified the Deputy Disciplinary \r\n    Counsel did not grant respondent an extension of time to file a response.     \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [3]  \r\n    Respondent did not file an answer to the Second, Third, or Fourth Formal Charges.  \r\n    His failure to file an answer constitutes an admission of the factual allegations \r\n    in those charges.  Rule 24(a) of Rule 413, SCACR.  In addition, because he \r\n    failed to appear at the panel hearing, he is deemed to have admitted the factual \r\n    allegations of these three charges and to have conceded the merits of the \r\n    recommendation considered at the hearing.  Rule 24(b) of Rule 413, SCACR.  \r\n  \r\n\r\n \r\n   [4]  \r\n    An Attorney to Protect was appointed and is in the process of returning the \r\n    original wills to respondentâ€™s clients.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_uacct = \"UA-2058248-1\";\r\nurchinTracker();\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  &copy; 2000-2014 South Carolina Judicial Department\r\n\r\n\t  \r\n\t","court":"Supreme"},{"id":"ORDER","title":"Amendments to Rule 410(e), SCACR","url":"http://www.judicial.state.sc.us/courtOrders/displayOrder.cfm?orderNo=2003-10-22-01","description":"This amendment to Rule 410(e)(SCRCP) adds languange to ensure that changes of Bar members' addresses will be sent to the South Carolina Bar's address and adds a requirement that attorneys also supply the Bar with the member's e-mail address.","date":"2003-10-27","type":"order","text":"\r\n  The Supreme Court of South Carolina\r\nRE:&nbsp; Amendments to   Rule 410(e), SCACR \r\n \r\n\r\nORDER\r\n\r\nPursuant to Art.
